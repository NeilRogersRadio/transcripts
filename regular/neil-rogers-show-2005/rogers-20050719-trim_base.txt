Music
Sounds like deals in the house.
What?
That's not the thing.
You should have been talking to Jack.
Good.
Thank God.
I was talking about how miraculous it is.
The Internet, which was off the three days, miraculously is repaired 15 minutes before you come on the air.
The rest of us can't get it done.
It was the dump mysteer.
It came in and waved his magic wand.
You fell in all of a sudden by the beam.
That's what he was wearing.
He was waving something around.
Oh man.
What are we going to do about those Israelis by the way?
I know that car is a car with that one.
I wasn't talking about that today.
What about Israelis?
I heard I had a fire report even though I said nothing to do with my thing.
Some of us shy isn't Israeli.
You're a board off producer, whatever you want.
He is Israeli extraction.
Well, how sad.
I had an experience with a group of Israelis that were so disgusting and loud and obnoxious and pushy and just, oh, many.
They're very aggressive people.
Aggressive my ass.
Don't you know the old line that they were going to put in there for LL?
Oi!
Visit Israel before it visits you.
Yeah, right.
Man, oh, man.
Pushy and just all over my back and all over, just disgusting.
I don't want to tell the whole story eventually.
I don't want to take up your valuable time with it.
What do you mean we're on your time now?
Oh, that's right.
Like I said, I'll save it.
Yeah, thank God we got that fold fake.
I wasn't looking too promising.
I was thinking about going back to bed when I came into this morning about 820.
This place is good.
This place.
Or accident-wing to happen.
Four days with no internet.
Four.
Yep.
Mm-hmm.
And I mean, you know, this part of this operation depends on the dissemination of news in a certain area.
The dissemination of news?
What is that?
That's dark.
Was it a war of pull-up change?
Oh, I see.
So I also understand we have a little problem with the direct TV too.
I wonder if they haven't paid their grill on that thing.
Oh, that's out too.
I do believe.
I don't know.
As long as they get that the Univision Weather Girl on, we're okay.
And then this week we got the hockey deal finally.
I just forget about it already.
We need to please all your hockey people.
I'm not forgetting that.
Wow, the thing is huge.
You're not the only one on that.
So I won't even, I was prepared to bring it up with you at some point, but don't.
You're not into it.
It's not even waste our time on this.
That's a good plan.
My time's over.
And it's just talk about getting led down to Garden Panth, man.
Players are playing up 24% of the salary.
Really?
Just, yeah.
See, the whole thing is based on trying to keep alive a bunch of phonie franchises.
That's what sports become.
So including the Florida panthons.
I think you could apply that to baseball.
Yeah.
There's franchises that have absolutely no reason to exist anymore.
Yep.
They don't have the money.
They aren't growing people.
The word Florida coming in.
Even like, you know, Buffalo, I'm on Pittsburgh.
Franchises have been around for a long time.
But they just, they can't support it.
They just, the markets are too small.
Yep.
And I don't know.
I guess there was also the fact that they keep moving into Sun Valley areas.
Right.
Where they're not supported.
Like Atlanta, where they fail the first time.
And they come back the second time.
And like Nashville and like Florida and like Carolina.
Nothing could be fine if into a get out of Carolina.
So the answer to all of this is add more franchises.
That's it.
That's a great idea.
Instead of 31, I'd have 100.
And then they all make the playoffs.
Yes.
Gotta get our Supreme Court justice appointee today.
Looks like this woman is what's her name?
I got to hear somewhere.
Let's see.
Her name is Edith Clement.
She's a US court of appeal judge in Nulleen.
And of course, it's been accelerated not because they want to cover up the Carl Robes.
That is why they've accelerated it.
Yeah, I thought he was going to take his time on this.
Yeah.
That's what they were saying on the right.
I think Brian is urgent to get this on the agenda, right?
Now, Friday was going to take this time.
And today it's or yesterday,
Oh, we got to do it right away.
Exactly.
But kind of a cover up.
That's an ongoing thing in that.
Well, let's see.
Deaf was telling me a week from the tomorrow.
Let's see.
Next Wednesday is the 27th.
And there's the book comes out.
The spring book.
Oh, I'm really looking forward to that.
What does that mean?
Well, I have two, two else think.
Oh, trends.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Also, the odds are that you're doing for it.
I'm asking that all over.
Do for a shot, right?
Right.
Do for a good shot.
Well, see.
What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to say?
I don't want to say anything.
Whatever it will be.
That's the way it is.
Now, if you'd speak all the, uh,
speak an eponnie a little while,
I'm going to show you.
You'd go sit up there.
I would do what?
Oh, yeah.
Speak it in the right language.
I've showed it.
Oh, I see.
You're sitting in Dave County right now.
Yeah.
One thing here, man, they all speak English.
So I should move up there.
My numbers would go up.
Even that is really group.
Oh, and actually, they were not speaking English.
They were talking in Hebrew.
And just, oh, man, I just, oh, can't even explain to you
how obnoxious and disgusting.
And the woman, the reason that this all transpired
was very early in the morning.
There were only two of us playing.
Me and this other very nice lady.
She just had a thousand bucks on the wheel.
And she's sitting there waiting to get paid.
And only a muzzle club here comes this guy with his entourage.
Muscle club.
And she was very impressed by that because she was Jewish.
So obviously she was easy.
Oh, are you Jewish?
Yeah.
I might have, but maybe I'll move.
But am I in there all Jewish?
And they're all, you know, I'm Jewish to the point of being obnoxious about it.
And now they all sit down.
And they're like putting on this disgusting act next to me.
The two machines to my left, which says nobody playing.
And they're not playing either.
This sitting there, taking off space,
empowering over my shoulder and her shoulder.
And the place is empty.
Finally, I leaned over to her and I said,
I can speak some words to them too, but not the word to you.
No, are you Jewish too?
I said, yeah, but what does that have to do with being Israeli?
So just say, talks of voice.
And then she says, she says, oh, but they have to be very aggressive over there.
You know, they just have to, I said, what does that have?
See, this is the thing about ethnic, you know, they're all saying about birds of a feather flock together.
That's exactly correct.
So in other words, Cubans in Miami,
whether it's Jews from anywhere,
whether it's blacks with OJ and everything is a racial thing,
birds of a feather stick together and just makes me one of barbs.
Cub.
I said to her, I said, what's there, what does that have to do with the way you behave in public?
The fact that they have to be aggressive.
First of all, they're not over there right now.
They're here.
Number one, and number two, that's just an excuse for a rude barbaric behavior.
So I think of what I'm going to oversee a contest.
The most obnoxious ethnic group, whether it's the Korean-flavored Indian crowd,
whether it's the Russians who are also, or the old Italians,
also loud and obnoxious,
or now the Israelis who have thrown their big hat into the ring.
They threw their kippah into the ring.
Is there any kind of Islamic population up there?
Are you kidding me?
Is there any kind of Islamic population?
Holy!
Holy moly, man!
You never got the cab here?
Yeah, well, that's everywhere.
The cab drivers.
Well, believe me, we've got terrorists in waiting all over the place.
And see that, that's the thing.
That's why people are so stupid.
Like, we saw the pictures of these four guys in London, you know?
Yeah.
And there are even sitting people here who look just like that.
They look exactly like that, or like the 19 on the 9-11.
Now that crowd.
I mean, so how do you know by looking at somebody, right?
Mm-hmm.
Of course, the British were there bringing intelligence over there.
They said, oh, yeah, we looked at the one guy, and he said it wasn't worth pursuing.
And then they lowered the terror alert in June.
Tell me where to be right on top of it.
When you get on an airplane today,
do you guys take a look at the people who are getting on the plane?
Not anymore.
And I would say for about a year after 9-11, for about a year,
I looked very with three raised eyebrows at all of the people I would survey each one of them.
And think to myself, oh, that looks like a terrorist to me.
I still have a tendency to do that.
You know, I travel so much, you know, I get on my mind.
I'm watching these people, you know what I'm saying?
Well, can I handle this guy?
Yeah.
I'm done.
I'm finished.
Not if he looks like Ronald Martinez.
Oh, no.
But he doesn't look like a terrorist.
He just looks like a thug.
Yeah.
Well, thugs are in in Hylia.
Well, what's happening?
I wouldn't know.
I haven't been to Hylia.
There are two places I haven't been to in several years.
I haven't been to Hylia since that incident with Rauou.
And I also haven't been south of Carl Gable since Andrew.
That's a good idea.
Oh, no.
What's happening with a slot thing, in closing, before we run into my first break there?
What's happening with the slots?
There's nothing recent.
There's no new way out.
How is that possible?
It's the 20th of July tomorrow.
I haven't seen the word or heard a word about it.
So I keep scouring the internet to see if I can find anything.
I've been there.
I've been scouring the internet here.
It's been down a little less.
Now, I'm gonna see on the back.
So now you got it back.
Just leave it to me.
It's all you.
Pass, okay.
Stop wading your magic wand.
Yeah.
Just like that.
There it is.
And the wand, too.
Right.
Well, listen, that's Tuesday.
So you probably have a pretty good assortment of places you can plunge your guts on Tuesday.
No, I'm plungey.
My guts on a new television today.
What is that?
Oh, you're buying a new TV?
Yeah.
What kind?
Uh, I'm gonna get...
EG, of course.
Hey, yes, definitely HD.
The guy's coming over from Sound Advice to make sure I get something that fits the...
Well, what brand?
I'm not talking about the size.
What brand?
It's Samsung.
Oh, uh, Mitsubishi.
Oh.
And what time is this going to start?
Well, actually I'm looking at two.
I'm looking at a Mitsubishi.
And I'm looking at the Sony.
Uh, let me just...
Oh, the Sony is, uh, it's not HD.
What do they call the Sony thing?
Uh, yeah, but I want...
I told them I want HD.
What do they call that, George?
I don't know.
Bill.
Yeah, you do.
Bill.
Fill it off your park at 1225, called it at 1254, Eerie.
Collotto, you know what?
Perimetto's Mountain Near Park.
Harness racing from Mohawk at 720, George and Downs in Australia, 10 tonight.
Let me tell you something.
I have a weapon in my pocket, okay?
Really?
Yes.
I have it.
I have it.
I have it.
I have it.
You hear the one.
Anyway, I have a ticket from Sunday.
Yeah.
From Hollywood, I left early.
And I hit the late pit tree there for four digits.
Really?
Yeah.
So it's a signer.
And so when I go back to the side...
It's not going to be finer than the cash in a big signer.
Yeah, but I'm going to wait for Saturday.
I'm not going out there during the week.
Did I mention you do not ever go...
I think I originally touted you to go there.
Don't ever go to Fallsview Casino and I will find you.
Yeah, you told me about it.
Don't tell me about it.
Clip joint.
Yep.
Did they respond to you?
You wrote to them, didn't you?
Yeah, they called.
She called me twice and we love to have you come back.
And even if you don't want to gamble, we'd like to count the room into meals.
And I feel so bad.
Now why would I go slip all the way to Niagara Falls to see water fishing over a bunch of rocks again?
I'm going to see them in a million times.
You know, what's to see at once?
It's very nice to see.
And that's it.
You know, what do I need to see that?
So go back there for free meals.
They did so.
They did so.
They did so.
They called me twice.
Good for them.
Yeah.
Scrum.
Listen, and send it back to Israel, by the way.
Oh, brother, those are Israelis.
I'm telling you right now.
It's enough to make me stand up for the PL.
Oh!
Have a great day.
Don't lose them.
Like, in the Samsung, give it a think about it.
I looked at the Samsung.
Oh, boy.
Happy to.
We love the crew.
It's a great set, man.
I'll tell you.
When you watch your...
Now, this is your first HD set?
Yes.
When you watch a live sporting event on HDTV, man, it's just...
It's a different experience.
It's breathtaking.
Yeah, that's what I'm looking forward to.
And, as a matter of fact, and I see you...
The problem is, you won't be home.
Because you're going to be our cover-in-a-games,
but like a football game.
I mean, hockey is fantastic, and baseball is amazing,
but an NFL game in HD is just unbelievable.
If I can watch the opening Thursday night game on it.
There you go.
That's the whole idea.
If I watch the Patriots on it, I'm going to wait another Super Bowl.
Seven and a half over the Raiders, the first game.
Yeah, there you go.
Lions already lost their hand.
The Lions are already lost.
I think we lost those Dolphin Whites just in time, by the way.
I'm not going to knock your friend Jimmy Cipolis again
because I put you in a bad position, but...
I still... I'm still pissed off about that, because it's so outrageous.
It's so degrading.
The whole thing is lying in Friday's...
Oh, it's him, it's him, it's him, it's nothing but a...
And I know, he's not a one of your buddies.
I guess you have to ask about this one line that he had inside Friday's paper.
Did you see it?
I saw the line about the TV guy, which wall is it about?
He wrote the now that they've added Matt Moore to the...
Oh, that's it.
So now they have Matt Moore, Jimmy Cephalo, and Joe Rose.
Right.
And he said...
He said, all they're missing is a play by play guy.
Was that what he said?
Yeah.
Well, it's about Tommy Roodle line.
Hey, starting your a tub of crap, man.
And by the way, quick play, and what's that 760 in Palm Beach that he's all whipped up about?
Got me.
That was the week you go Friday, Roodle column.
Oh, I was out of town.
I was out of town.
Oh, man.
Just go back into another, you got the internet spec.
Go back and do a search on that thing on Sony.
We do week you go Friday's calling.
He wrote about...
Oh, that guy.
The best afternoon sports in South Florida is on 760 and West Palm and this guy's this guy.
I mean, I'm going to figure something.
But this respect that our people get in these newspapers.
Now that they take Catherine Harris, very jackass and Jim Cerny and put them all in a very
tricky small plane.
Maybe the one at JFK Jr. was a sort of flying.
God, why was you put Jim Sarny in there?
Why not?
He's the antichrist.
Oh.
He's a suck up.
Okay.
Jim is Jimmy's syphilist, all your buddies.
And Jimmy the Greek, too, even though he's still dead.
Have a great day and pick the Samsung.
Trust me.
I'll see you.
Bye.
I can't endure.
I'm constantly stressed, my pleasure.

up by cooking and splendid cups for the kids
That's right and like he said that just this morning he's gonna change you in every day
First of all if anybody like you know
Bleed the name then they were gonna be out and they said if anybody committed a crime now
He said this morning if they murdered at least five people
Then they're gonna be out and he'll think about it right by the way
Do you want this seven page facts about actors who served in the military and those who didn't?
No, why do I care about that?
Well, why is that of any interest?
That's what happens when I get it to go to the bathroom. I can't can't know is this include actors who served in the military
Like I went over there and made like their propaganda movies like John Wayne don't add them to the marine
How do you like them? Well good for him get smart Don
Now here's the facts that says since I'm a little bit. I realized that that top-of-business was gonna be even more than
No idea business no, but big
Cosmo top-of-the-oe-o-carreo
Pantro from the Cisco kid was real career. We know that the Cisco kid though, which we did not know was dumping Ronaldo
That brings back some memories. See school poncho. Thank God that TV doesn't stereo type minorities, you know
I
Know that's your favorite TV thing so I crank it up
probably
You know you had your aim as an Andy and then of course you got this now queer queer eye for the
Frag guy and all these other horror all these screaming mincing. Oh god. You think I watch those? Oh no
Well, you know this folk they wouldn't put a show on called queer right for the straight guy then have a couple of
You know none queer acting guys. Oh, I see what would be the point? Let's see. What was the movie?
I'm trying to think who's that great actor see
I can't think of who he is either face of all birds no
But in the same category great actor who played in some a fag movie
And anyway, I always the boys in a band the real straight looking one. I can't think of his name right now
What a shame look up boys in a band again. Maybe a cast please Josh it with it. Let him get that on it
The dog of St. Bernard was named Neil on top of it
Forget that one. I just remember when the guy told me two minutes ago my birthday too
That's why I played the birthday thing and he regulations to multiply them. He's the birthday boy. Okay. Here's what we got so far four hundred and thirty eight people have
done our survey thing our little sex survey
You don't have to lie because they're not tracing these all of them. Maybe they are
Which of these applies to you? I'm a 100% heterosexual male
No, yes, furances yet
265 I couldn't relate my horror house 50
I'm a heterosexual male who's had at least one sexual experience with a male 50
I'm a heterosexual female no gay experiences 12
I'm really a bisexual male do you believe us oh really 12
I'm a gay male who's had sex with a woman nine. I'm a gay male never had sex with a woman six
So let's see three point three percent of the audience is uh gay. How do you like that? Do you believe that?
I thought it was like 10% when you took this before
I'm a lesbian is that they're all going now. I missed a beat of firton
I'm a lesbian who's had sex with the five just as you said that I'm really
One I have to interrupt because I just threw away another fact from spending about the beat of firton being done to bed
I'm really a bisexual female five. I'm a lesbian never had sex with a man four and I'm a heterosexual female who has had lesbian sex for
So let's see you take your your dikes. I mean
2% and what we got three point so five about five percent of the audience is gay. How do you like that?
Contrary to popular rumour
Certain people like to spread
Certain trained monkeys like to spread
Don't don't don't
You're not getting to my pile here at all
We've been ashamed of that to carry these over for Thursday
Top AIDS to President Bush and vice president Dick Cheney were intensely focused on discrediting former ambassador Joseph C Wilson
And they's after he wrote that op-ed article for New York Times suggesting the administration manipulated intelligence
To justify going to war in Iraq federal investigation has been told and of course that was the thing smear and smear
Whether it was Richard Clark whether it was Scott Ritter whether it was Hans Blitz whether it was Paul O'Neal or whether of course
It was Joe Wilson smear and smear
Prosecutors investigating whether administration officials illegally leaked the identity of Wilson's wife the CIA officer
Would have worked undercover have been told that Bush's top political strategist Carl Rove and Cheney's keep the staff
Lewis Scooter Libby was specially intent on undercutting Wilson's credibility according to people familiar with the inquiry
Although remember I told her this is just the beginning and they can try to cover it up right now
But meanwhile the grand jury is still doing their thing. I'm holding my breath
Although lower level White House staffers typically handled most contacts with the media
Rove and Libby began personally communicating with reporters about Wilson prosecutors were told
Assurge directly familiar with information provided two prosecutors said
Rove's interest was so strong that it prompted questions in the White House
When I asked at one point why he was pursuing the diplomats so aggressively
Rove reportedly responded he's a Democrat
Rove then cited Wilson's campaign donations which leaned toward Democrats the person from into the case said
So here you go when did that cheer him out
And the media man the CNN I'm gonna say it again for the 80 minute time they need to be taken right off the air
When did that take them out CNN take off the tower take off the satellite
They put such garbage on they had some bimbo on there yesterday who was
Supporcially having a debate or discussion
About Scott McClellan about the older questions from the media about curl rope. She had a summer public an operative on there from the RNC
And then she had Jack Valendi on there, you know the screenwriters of the Hollywood guy, okay
It was just the same the same thing is the other guy while you know press secretaries always have to like be loyal to their president
And it's a tough job
It was just pathetic
It was just pathetic
Bubblehead bimbo is asking the really tough questions on CNN MSNBC MSNBC now they got revolving bimbo's some of no look too bad
But that really that's the new deal now let the guy bother. Oh, you don't even know who lester hold is so what tell you know who
I just I'm shocked by that. I don't watch it. You know who Chris Matthews is okay? Maybe who talks out of the side of his mouth
Oh that guy yeah, and you know who Joe Starbroy is from a Florida congressman right when
Real remember the personality like a dead man. I guess if I sell it
You can't complain about the personality on MSNBC because they don't have them and then they got Ronnie Wagen Jr
Hey Ronnie too fairy that little a screamer
It's a pretty sad we could put our own news never come and put some pro interesting people on, you know
but
Talk to Greg about it's because I know we're very news intensive on QA
20 since past 11. Oh before we do the break
It's been a crawl row just a quarter of Americans think the White House is fully cooperating with the federal investigation of that leak of
Valerie planes name a number that's declined sharply since the investigation began and three quarters
75% say that a presidential advisor crawl row was responsible for leaking class of that information. It should cost him his job
There's nothing worse than a bad leak
It's kind of like when it burns you know it burns skepticism about the administration's cooperation is jump as the initial investigation began and said oh
And I forgot to mention something a handkerchief mind me Thursday morning a magical word. You know what the word is for blood sugar? I get a cinnamon
Or a cinnamon yeah, let's say cinnamon they were closed
Mm-hmm, but not don't put sugar on it though. Well, that makes it best skepticism about the administration's cooperation is jump as the initial investigation began in September
2003 nearly half the public 47% believe the White House was fully cooperating that felt a 39% a few weeks later and now
Lower still only 25% who also want to buy the Brooklyn Bridge and some property in the Everglades real chief
They believe that the cooperating as opposed to covering up stonewalling up this skating lying through their teeth
Etc. All of these things
27 past 11 and five 60
WQM probably be good idea if I did the right spot
Yeah, well, I guess a whip talk about this crap especially have only these two days a week to iracculate

That's because there's no violence in there.
That's all for his wife.
That's because I never did every one I got.
People always say,
story,
No joy today, man. We got the guilty for maybe gully into a couple of
the boys today. It's just a ton of dollars from them for between two and full.
What do you think? All right, I'm gonna come on. Gully were requesting a few
boys. Anyway, oh, here's that story. I finally had a check of writers. I scoured
the internet and I finally found this story and we saw it on CNN but they didn't
feel it was important enough to put on their website or to even buy the repeating.
Gunman shot dead three suini Arab members of the team drafting a
reaction to constitution today, striking a blow against the body scene as the
best hope for providing a political end to the insurgency.
Drawing suini Arabs on to the committee do deliver a new constitution of
August 15th was the chorus tone of the U.S. Act's strategy of persuading
members of the arrested minority to move off the streets and into peaceful
polymers but three of them now. The fish is mortal, man. Oh, speaking of
death, this here's the most important story. It's a damn good thing you're
going back into my pile. Okay, this may be the most important story and be a
good idea for a poll question someday. All right. Did you look up boys in the band
by the way? Yeah, in the cast. Yeah, which one you want. I don't know who they
were. How about Frederick Holmes? No. How about Leonard Frey? No. How about
Cliff Gorman? No. How about Kenneth Nelson? No. Maud Adams? No. Ruben Green? No.
Robert Lattornix? No. That's the great. Lawrence Lockingdale? No. Keith
French. Maybe the one thinking I wasn't in that movie. We only got one more
Peter White. No. No. No. What's in that movie? What's another gay movie? I
guess. And the idol, it'll come back to me. Firm tied to freezing Ted Williams
head to open and boitten beach. This is the most important story and it would
lead to a great poll for you to take some day. Whose head would you like to think
we ought to freeze? That's good. Not a good poll idea? Yeah. A company
associated with the Arizona firm that froze the head of baseball legend
Ted Williams plans to open a crash facility in Boiton Beach. Oh God. Talk about
the petrified forest. Point and beach. Oh. Suspended animation. That's the name of
the outfit. Expect to open in August. The facility was approved for one by
Boiton Beach commissioners in March after being repeatedly rejected by
vocal officials. Plus. That's the movie is if there's Bellalagosi in it. Where
they have. No, I don't think so. Where they hate he saves the woman gets killed
as well. It's killed in the car crash and he saves her head. Oh. What's the
thing? You see that? Have it's yet the head that wouldn't die or something. Yeah.
Something like that and then her head is alive. He's got the. The tubes that
going into with the blood is flowing. Her head is like a Vincent price. No. I
saw just a couple of school. Okay. It is really bad. It's one of those grades.
You movies, but it's camp. It's fun. You know, I love that. It's something like having
your head on a table. And she's seen an eye and got nobody which is kind of cute.
I was thinking on TV shows. This one all excuse you maybe I'll check the
deck. They come to the first season.
This is more. It's not a set of file.
If you pick it onvertward again, that's the word I was thinking of a lot. Anyway,
the facility was approved for one after being repeatedly rejected by Boko.
First of all, the boy in B said, here we got plenty of dead heads here. Why not?
The company's manager used to work for our core life extension foundation with
reportedly severed Williams head. Oh God. Is that enough to make me want to play
that severed head bit or what? Oh my God. It's a severed head. Yes, severed head.
The new fabric sweeping animation. Everyone who's anyone has got a severed head.
And if you think it's not for you, then just listen to this drama-pods version of an
actual letter sent to us by a satisfied severed head customer. Okay, that makes $623 for all
your Halloween candies. $623. Isn't that a lot for a bag of candy? Well, it's our finest
mixture. You two get the caramel corn balls, the tapioca sugar daddy's and the two spilled
wax pump gifts. Well, I guess it isn't good deal. It's severed head in the middle of
the Zangnut bar. Sweet for geez. I'm so sorry. Please let me give you all this
Halloween candy for free. You better. Yes, a severed head is your ticket to thousands
of millions in freebies worldwide. So pick up yours today and remember if it's not dead,
it's not severed head. The company came to use to work for our core life extension foundation,
which reportedly severed Williams head and stored the body parts in a steel bin in Arizona
after we died in July 2002. Cryonix supporters claim that future scientific breakthroughs
will allow doctors to bring frozen dead bodies back to life, but more scientists contend
that it's highly unlikely and will happen anytime soon. It's out of the question the
foreseeable future said, Mehmet Tone, who are a Harvard biomedical engineer, who's
now-and-that was hysterical when Hank asked me this morning, do we have any Muslims
here? Oh, God! We got more ragheads here than you can shape your thing out.
You can shape your magic wand at, though. We can't even freeze and revive individual organs,
let alone freeze a whole human being, said Mr. Toner, where about the feeding morality
said Charles Platte 68 mortality and mortality. Said Charles Platte, a science fiction
writer with no medical background who will manage the lab, type was out course, keep operating
orificer. The soft-flutter laboratory primarily acts as a processing facility of freeze-dead
bodies, Platte said it will not store bodies. There's just going to be freezing.
We're freezing over here. Isn't that great? Lovely. I still think that's a good poll
idea. Whose head would we have frozen so we can bring them back sometime? And then
of course they'll all say, oh me? Yeah. You? No, I don't think so. No, not me, me, but
me isn't them. 560-705-60, pound 5-60. We're not going to make our thousand things
on here today, John, not even a chance. Just slow it under a crawl. 488, that's not so
great. We need to get to like about 600 by noon and have a shot. Don't you think?
Maybe. Which of these applies to you? 491. I'm 100% heterosexual male, no gay experience
297. Over 60%. I'm a heterosexual male who has had at least one sexual experience with
a male 65. With a male man. I couldn't get laid in the warehouse 54. I'm a heterosexual
female, no gay experience 26. I'm really a bisexual male even though George doesn't
believe in 13. I'm a gay male who has had sex with a male. I don't want to love a
male. Just relax. I'm a gay male. Never had sex with a woman 7. So what does that
like for a few years, 0.6% gay men? I'm a lesbian who's had sex with a man 5. I'm
really a bisexual female 5. I'm a lesbian, never had sex with a man 4. And I'm a heterosexual
female who has had lesbian sex 4. Got to just get complicated or what? And I can't even
keep track. He had diaphragm. It's that number two that I don't believe. Number two,
I'm a heterosexual male. Guess what? We don't care.
When it comes to a gay man, he's new blood, he's new blood, he's new blood.
He's a gay man.
Our Snoop Dogg, that's what I'm here to talk about me and the Disney. Let's go to some
calls. New Orleans, Louisiana, hello. Do you know how to roll a bun? Oh, definitely.
That's cool. Do you go to come to that night? That's got meetings and since I had a
trip, I'll have you back. Overland Park, Kansas, hello. Hey, can you come to know a
lady for a quarter pound of COEAT? I'm down to do that. I need to get some money from
you. I'm even the parking lot after the show. And then we're roll from there.
Hey, Stargay, the bomb. Las Vegas, hello. I noticed you've been following that joint
night. Take a hit already. Exactly.
That's the proper way. Thank you. Thank you for having me, Larry. It's 1145. I didn't know Larry
had him. And how hard work by the way is the actor I was thinking about. I had a
lucid moment there during the break. How hard work? Okay. And the movie was a TV movie,
a certain summer 1972 with him, sure, or as you'd think about the young man whose father
comes turns out to be. And of course, how hard work is about a straight looking and acting
as anybody. And how about Michael Ankeen, right? Making love, remember that movie with the
Janet Jackson, with Janet Jackson, and Kate Jackson too? I remember that. Yes, I do. Michael Ankeen.
Harry, I was trying to look at that in the end. I beg your pardon? Wasn't Harry Hamlin
with that movie? Harry Hamlin, sure. She looked awfully, ever since then, I was starting
Harry Hamlin with when he got married to Nicolay Sheridan, which didn't last forever,
but nevertheless I thought, oh, sure, right. There's also that Greek movie. Really?
I didn't know he was into. Yeah, a clash with the Titans.
How the whole book, who is always considered, in fact, isn't a timely because he played
D-Tro in all the Presidents men. Huh. See how all of these things kind of wake up
like a big jigsaw puzzle? And I'm trying to figure the movie out. I guess it was in fame,
where Lee Roy's girlfriend had a big ass, you know, a bitch who's rare,
little tights, bobo. What is it about black women and big, sloppy asses? You know, what is that?
Genetics. Never thought that is? Sure. No, you know what I'm talking about?
What is that? I'm talking about a big old ass. I'm not talking about a big old ass.
A big old ass. Like a lot of you who is like, I'm talking about a sloppy big old ass.
Huh? Cornbread. Corn home?
Hi, ranking security and intelligence officials. Oh,
we're having a movie out.
Hi, ranking security and intelligence officials warned in the weeks before the London
bombings that the war in Iraq had increased. The risk of terrorism in Britain. It was reported
that it had increased the war in Iraq, okay? Are you following this boys and girls? I don't
understand how that could work. A report by the joint terrorist amalization center,
which includes officials from MI5, MI6, GCHQ, NGLX, and all these others, and the police
explicitly linked US to let involvement in Iraq with terrorist activity in the UK,
although it concluded that no group currently had the intent to keep a bill of demand
of the attack the New York Times said, which of course did that turn out to be right?
Events in Iraq are continuing to warrant this motivation and a focus of a range of terrorist
related activity in the UK. The report, a copy which was leaked to the paper by a foreign
intelligence agency BCAN. The legal embarrassed Prime Minister Tony Blair and other ministers who
yesterday, bluntly rejected a think tank reports conclusion that the Iraq conflict had increased
the terror threat to the UK. It doesn't take a genius to finger that out. We don't need to bring
back Shiloh Comes. Both Downing Street and the Foreign Office refuse to comment on today's claims.
We do not comment on leaked documents that Prime Minister's official spokesman said.
A foreign office spokesman added, we do not comment on alleged leaks, whatever they are. I remember
what I said before, nothing worse than a bad leak. The New York Times reported that the secret
J-PAC report was sent to British government agencies and foreign governments in mid-June
had said, in mid-June, at present there is not a group with both the current intent and the
capability to attack the UK. The J-PAC report was written about three weeks before,
four suicide bombers launched attacks on three London tomb trains,
QPE and a bus currently 56. The report prompted the government to lower its formal
threat assessment by one level from severe defiance as substantial as reported by the Guardian
on the day after the July 7th attacks. Security officials insisted that I'm creating a threat level
without a perfective response to the police and emergency services through the blast. How do you
like that? They are so out to lunch, man. They're just, uh, listening. I don't understand how
attacking people, you know, increase as a threat. How about you, Farton?
Well, you tax someone. How come they don't, you know, just love you after that?
How I see you, how I see you. Yeah, like I said, it takes Charlotte Holmes and Dr. Watson to figure
that one out. And maybe Miss Marple threw her ass in there. Leo Carillo. Carroyo.
A group called Floridians for a stem cell research in Cures launched a California style initiative
yesterday. I'm sure you talk about this at length. Oh, yeah, yeah. When its leaders pledging to
seek taxpayer money, not only for research on embryos, but also for therapeutic cloning.
The group is starting a statewide campaign to raise one and a half million dollars at
Fonda Bert-Erenson, a Palm Beach County commissioner. The money would be used to collect these
six under 11,000 signatures needed to put the constitutional amendment before voters in the
September 2006, uh, Goober, an interior primary. I still have to go, boy, just see if they make
it a constitutional amendment. And then these fat ass right winners like Jeff Bush can't say,
oh, no, can't do that. See that? I see it. I mean, is there any doubt about it?
5 6 7 0 5 60, calm 5 60, they've risen in singular wireless lines. Any minute now,
we're going to get the name of that to Nusapin Courthierge appointee. What did I do?
I already tossed that. I tossed it because I read it on when Hank and I were doing the crossover.
When we did our 45 minute crossover, I guess he did some abroad, some circuit court judge from
Nalines, who is a okay with Roe v Wade. But if they were pissed off about Gonzalez,
Jose M. In his gun, they're really going to be pork off about this all in right winners.
All of the other side was a kid in his. Oh, it's interesting that I'm starting to have like a real
conflict and I'm sure which group of people I despise more if I'm missing a go at him or those
as railies. Oh, I can't even describe you there. Their behavior was like it. It was like the first
day out of the house, you know what I mean? Okay, maybe some people do not know how to behave when
they're let out of the house. They can't intermingle with other human beings. They are lacking in
social skills, if you catch my drift. This is really people. They were like, oh god.
W.A.M. Hello. Yes, sir. What makes a world women so holy and so easy?
Somebody Q.A.M. Hello. How you doing?
I'm coming about your ice cream cold earlier today. Yeah. Was that all taken by just old people
because old people are the only one that's still like plain flavors? No, that was nationwide man.
That was among all people. Young, old and between fetuses. I mean, you name it. Crazy man. Yeah.
Lucky road roads. Hey man, I love rocky road. Man, I bet my own taste. Okay, Fowler, go get some.
Nothing like traveling in a rocky road. It is really rock solid. Yeah.
Why are we going to start with the ice cream crap again? I can't do that.
Oh, I don't want to admit to Josh that I've fallen off the wagon a couple of times.
Oh, you don't have to sit here? Yeah, you already know. Oh, sit him when I was starting to say
before. You know what is really this is a miracle. I better not suggest this.
What cinnamon toast bread? Bread is one of those things that you just don't metabolize well.
It turns to sugar immediately and even if you do the cinnamon toast. No, I saw a blurb on TV so I
googled it. Cinnamon and blood sugar. Okay. And come to find out. Now be very careful when you go
under your supermarket because they also in the room in the herb section in the spice rack.
They have cinnamon mixed with sugar. You do not want to want to be buy an apple.
Pretty convenient to sprinkle. Yeah, but just paying grounds cinnamon which who doesn't like cinnamon?
Let's face it. No, what I know. Now I'm going to say something here and you're going to you're
going to laugh at me but it's true. I've tried it twice. Josh don't listen, put your fingers in your
rear. But they already were there. But Hagen Das banana nut which you know I'm addicted to that.
If you do your melting in a microwave 99 seconds, I know that sounds like an awful lot but it is
when you buy it. It's rock solid. It's like a brick. Anyway, you take your Hagen Das banana nut and
you like melted, you know, however much you like a little bit and then you take your cinnamon,
your grounds cinnamon and you shake on a lot which see ordinarily it would be I mean there's
certain things that wouldn't mix the flavor of your bad. It wouldn't make it. It wouldn't cold
mingle. But the cinnamon and the banana nut is a real nifty mix. It's great. You swirl it all
through there. Okay. Okay. And the amazing part of this is at least I can always think from my
own personal experience is that your blood sugar was up a little bit and then like magic,
way that little magic wand you got there like magic, it starts going down again.
And so what I've been doing is I like take my cinnamon and what I'll do when I'm watching TV,
I have a red on my little coffee table in living room. And I'll take the cinnamon and like shake
a bunch of it into my into the palm of my hand. You know, I just lick it off, you know. I mean you can
do with a spoon but that's not fun. No, it's a little bitter though, isn't it? No. Cinnamon is bitter?
Well, when you take it straight like that. Isn't it a little harsh? I never took it straight.
No, that's what I heard. No, it is non-harish. I'm going to give me some during the break and
I'm going to give my little jar of cinnamon. Right. If you don't believe me, go on a line and read
about just do a Google on cinnamon and blood sugar and you'll find zillions of articles. Now,
they do also recommend like apple pie because it's made with cinnamon. I don't buy that. I'm sorry.
Pie. That's what it says. Now, maybe for some people depending on their own metabolism, maybe some
people can eat apple pie. It's got a lot of cinnamon on it and then study your sugar, go
to the scar walk and then you can actually go down because I tried the cinnamon toast thing.
I got some nice rye bread which rise not like the glycemic level isn't all that bad like white
bread. I got some rye bread and I shared some butter on there after I toasted it. I put on some
cinnamon and now then work here. Sugar still goes zooming. Not good. But a hot gondas, banana,
nut. Now, you might want to try to have some different flavor. I'll check my blood sugar next
time I have some. No, you won't. I'm dying on the hand. I keep crying and why don't you get
corralled at me and do something with me? I don't think I can do about it. Wait, wait, wait,
I just want to be easier to like restrain and rest on it. If all of you get the oil
or give them a little.. what do they call that? What is it? The kid of blood sugar kid, right?
All right, someone on the compact head. What about you later? Yeah, whatever it is. The acute
check. Yeah, acute check, right? You were thinking of it. Okay, here's what we got so far.
speaking of sex which of course is all anybody cares about me what else are we going to do about this
Our economy
No, this is your fearless leader
He's meeting with Australian Prime Minister Howard you know Howard

There's no way that this young girl is prepared
For the life where she's married to Tom
She's like she's not crying nothing in her cupboard

Mmm, how can you say that? What do you do, car?
Better. No. What's better about cinnamon?
What is by itself? That's why people make it with sugar
No. No, they miss anything with sugar just because of my fat, much sweeter
No, this is really good
In fact, I can feel my blood sugar plummeting, I may just hit the floor any second
There you go
So I googled it and I did, I don't want to bore everybody with all this
Because most people are not diabetic, although a lot of you are
Many of you aren't, you're either in denial or you're just a full of it
First of all, you shouldn't be nice cream anyway, you fast-slime, you're gonna be dead
Yeah, someday, you know, we have a spoonful of cinnamon bit

One thing about that cinnamon, oh, it's a little... it's a little...
Oh, yeah, I feel like, oh, wait
Okay, now what am I missing about that? What is it supposed to be about?
I think it has to do with Don't Forget the Cheese
Really? That's what I inferred
I say it sounds like something gay to me, leave it to you
Anyway, Cathy Wong who's an MD, well what's that MD?
a naturopathic doctor at naturopathy?
Oh, well, I'll take your work for it.
No, there's not a real doctor.
Kathy Wong writes on a website called Alternative Medicine,
one of the easiest things you can do to improve blood sugar
and increase insulin is to add up to a half a teaspoon of cinnamon
to your diet each day.
That's not a whole lot.
Half a teaspoon, is it?
No, it's not.
Some of my research highlights about the cinnamon
blood sugar connection are and it's got a long thing on here.
A human study published in diabetes care looked at 60 people with type 2 diabetes,
30 men, and 30 women, and 30 men, with an average age of 52,
they were divided into six groups, groups 1, 2, and 3, consume 1, 3, or 6 grams of cinnamon daily,
respectively, groups 4, 5, and 6 were given placebo capsules,
corresponding to the number of capsules consumed for the three levels of cinnamon.
After 40 days, all three levels of cinnamon intake reduced,
fasting blood glucose ranging from 18 to 29 percent
to aglycerized 23 to 30 percent.
Dr. D. Man.
LDL cholesterol, that's the bad stuff, 7 to 27 percent,
and total cholesterol, 12 to 26 percent.
And also, not only do they do that, but they also have antioxidant activity cinnamon.
Okay, good.
The active compounds are not lost with heating so you can try adding cinnamon to water
before heating and boiling them together.
You can do you like to put in your cinnamon tea.
If you don't like to look or texture teammate with ground cinnamon,
try making a tea bringing water to a boil with a piece of cinnamon bark added to it.
Where do you get cinnamon bark?
They have that, you can bite in jars.
Have you ever seen cinnamon bark?
Yeah, for price, great.
It's sprinkling cinnamon on salads.
Open your writing a bit to chicken or meat before cooking.
Don't use more than a half teaspoon a day in the month
that appears to be safe for most people.
Well, your mama, I'll use that over much I want.
Cinnamon increases vitality and balances energy.
Especially good for people who tend to have hot upper body and colder lower body.
Cinnamon also improves the digestion of fruits,
melts another dairy product.
It's all I also for you, very important,
very important thing since you're an IBS guy now.
You got that irritable bowel.
And they're right.
Cinnamon is also good for bloating, gas,
poor digestion are throtticinemia,
pain-flementsal periods, and diarrhea.
How do you like that?
All right then.
I've started sharing it right now for you.
I'm going to go get some.
I'm going to get it right there at your public.
In the spices in the spice doing.
Be sure not to get the one with a sugar all on your case.
I'm going to do that.
Don't get the one with a sugar one.
That's kind of productive.
Don't be taking poison in your cinnamon.
I'll use sugar in the nutrients wheat or something.
What a cinnamon in the nutrients wheat.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,
tongue 5, 60, and they've arrived in singular wireless lines.
They're aeg operative recognition
and what sort of a crime constitutes a firing offense?
You know, I appreciate your opinion.
That my answer really hadn't changed.
For 24 hours ago, it's the same answer.
Now I'll be glad to answer another question if you got one.
I'll be glad to repeat what I said yesterday.
But do it.
Which is there's an ongoing investigation and people shouldn't.
What?
Don't be confused.
I was in the principal.
The investigation is over.
I think the investigation is over.
I'll deal with it.
If you have another question, I don't want a short change, you honor.
What do you think the Edith's come on?
Pardon me?
Edith's come on for the court.
Oh, well, I think it's important.
Let me refer you back to the first question.
What are you talking about?
They're all yucking it up.
I'm a good friend.
Nothing.
Just the people are serious about this guy.
What?
You know any of those people?
No, I don't.
I don't need to thank John.
I'm actually very serious about it.
If someone's from a woodbine the other day,
in fact, they should have been hanging out
at the burning bush.
5.6705.60.5.
60.8.
Verizon.
Singular wireless line.
WDQAM.
Hello.
OK.
Three very quick but important points.
Yes.
We're going to see how the media is manipulated by these people
with this diversion with Supreme Court.
See how they really are?
Because they're already warning the residents
of the business.
Let's see what they really do.
Another thing.
We have people like Yadda Ross-Wayne
going into their air return.
There are a lot of thought.
She's talking about terrorism, terrorism, terrorism.
And when one of those do,
you know that guy they caught on my enemy.
She's defending him all over.
Was there a
conspiracy or anyone on all of his panic cases?
A third point.
So I saw on the target magazine for 2005.
This is to have a
as a
one of the 8000 great talks of all time run.
The four million that greatest talks of your host ever in.
It's ridiculous.
It is not.
But I just really would like to know how these people,
they warned the media that this is what they're going to do.
Let's see what they do to combat that.
Because that's what they're doing.
OK.
That's
another thing.
How
did you hear you say when they asked them a question about the
the real thing?
How people started laughing at that
and that's the person of this country
and that the right hand house was stupid.
Yeah, people are dying and we're laughing.
OK, good luck you pal.
Yes.
Can't because people demand additional freedoms.
So it's an economic interest.
I think it's in the world's interest.
I mean, seriously, how can anybody with a straight face look at this and say
if this is the leader of the free world, this is our president, this is a man who's
oh brother, that was a straight face.
No, come on with a case.
Yes.
Somebody QA and hello.
OK, nobody on that line.
Will I tell you a little swim and grim?
You know what?
Somebody QA and hello.
Hey, yes, Nuneo.
Yes, sir.
You know, I was listening to the article that you read about the escalation of violence.
And I was I had it, you know, you know, you remember General Boykin?
Sure.
And he said our God is better than your God and we were in a Christian country.
I like it when he said,
dear God, that was my favorite.
Well, as I say,
but I mean, that that basically I have three things against me.
I'm white American and Jewish.
Well, you're done for, man.
Don't go to Israel, by the way.
My mom's going.
I'm fighting with her.
Yeah, packer is a lot of sandwich.
OK, packer is some still halva.
That's unbelievable.
She's fighting.
Now she says she's sick.
She's more scared to go to having sure a mall at night than to go to Israel.
Yeah.
Exactly.
You know, she's never been scared.
I don't want her to be so I don't want her to go.
You know, just keep her off the bus.
All right, I'm going to be safe.
Good luck to him.
Happy Shivuas, by the way.
5, 6, 7, 5, that's what I wanted to say.
Those Israelis there, OK?
Two things.
Number one, happy Shivuas and number two,
Kasa Houss and number three get lost.
Get out of here.
Get off my shoulder.
Get away from me.
Get off everybody here.
Go act civilized, even if you have to put out a big act.
God will they're disgusting.
Come in if you want to.
Hello.
Hey, Leo.
Good to hear you back again.
Yes, sir.
This is for Josh.
Man, instead of out eating a sheet to put it,
just sprinkle it up on the blonde and then just enjoy.
Kick back and slow it on, man.
There you go.
All right.
Come in if you want to.
Hello.
Two.
I am.
Hello.
We'll splash the gas in here right now.
Q.A.M.
No time.
Come in if you want to.
Hello.
I got two questions.
Yes, sir.
One.
Do you know any place where this guy says this for a few days?
Yeah, I want the second question.
Okay, we don't work on it.
Okay, like I said, getting back to my pile here.
Why?
I thought I'd give it a shot.
Lee, at least there's some different proposals today.
I'll say that.
Oh, it's great.
You kidding me?
This is some heavy duty craft we got going on here today.
I'd love to do it.
Zero.
Yeah, I like why I like that.
See this?
That?

One time ago, I can still remember when I first saw
American pie.
And I knew if I had my chance,
that I'd try to get right in her pants and maybe try to date her for a while.
Her nude scene really made me Randy.
I choked on my popcorn and my candy.
I'll be at her doorstep and better to get on dress.
I can't remember if I cried when I read that she became a bride.
A breath of relief I did find the day.
She left that guy.
So high, high, Miss American pie.
Fancy a season she would date me,
would just buy in the sky.
Since I was just a boy,
I wish that I was your guy.
I had no chance and held at least I tried.
My proposition has been denied.
Okay, COVID-19 at 5.60 WDQAM.
Whatever you're saying, the number of Iraqi civilians
on my violent death in the two years after the US-Land invasion was today put at 24,865
by an independent research team.
But who's counting?
The figures compiled from Iraqi and international media reports found
US and coalition military forces were responsible for 37% of the deaths
with anti-occupation forces and insurgents responsible for 9%.
A further 36% were blamed on criminal violence.
So I just like to kind of place that we'd like to hang out, right?
Right.
It's cool enough.
So where would you like to hang out,
bad dad or televised?
What are we saying?
No seriously, I think it's good.
People say to me,
what do you travel all over the world?
You go to Europe all the time and how come you never go to Israel?
And my immediate thought is,
Oh, for what?
To put myself in jeopardy?
The hotel's there.
Yeah, no thanks.
And the food there is from hunger.
So then even the Arab safe fair.
So then that's attributed to US and coalition military forces
peaked in the invasion period from March to May 2003,
which accounts for 30%.
About 30, man.
Most of it indecent to your period,
but the longer term trend has been for increasing numbers to die
at the hands of insurgents.
What do you like more?
Better detergents or insurgents?
Figures of tantalized me from the Iraqi interior ministry
put the average civilian and police officer
debtroller and insurgent tax from August 2004 to March 2005
at 800 a month.
That's like about 10,000 a year.
It sounds like to me.
John Slebotta, now I take you here this.
John Slebotta of the Iraq Body Count Project.
What was co-authored the report with Oxford Research Group said
the Iraqi civilian debt toll was the forgotten cost
of the decision to go to war in Iraq.
On average, 34 Iraqis every day have met violent debts
since the invasion he said.
Our data shows that no sector of Iraqi society has escaped.
We sincerely hope this research will help to inform
the decision makers around the world about the real needs
of the Iraqi people as they struggle to rebuild
this country, the one that you bombed in this revision,
and the risk of the reins and shut off the electric
and the water and the oil, etc.
Getting to something much more serious.
A 27-year-old married man was arrested and charged
leaving threatening notes on women's cars
demanding that they remove their panties
and leave them in the space where their vehicle was parked.
Police told Channel 6.
How do you like that?
Did it work?
Investigators said Nicholas Cogrid 27 could wait until
a woman would exit a vehicle in a parking lot
at Celebration Health in Oslo,
a county, and other locations.
Then leave a note between the front drivers
and rear passengers around the windshield.
If the door was unlocked, he would also leave the note on a car seat.
Cogrid demanded that the woman remove their underwear
and taste the garment in the parking space
where he presumably would pick it up later.
Local 6 news reported an anti-alverist
that I'm assuming this is Channel 6 in Orlando.
If they didn't comply, he threatened to find them
and perform various sex acts.
I mean, this is whatever it's a crappy channel.
Does it say what's the name?
What?
Which act?
No, not yet.
The first incident of threatening notes
is reported in 2000, but no reliefs appeared
till last May.
Several months of surveillance at a parking lot led
deputies to the arrest of Cogrid.
After questioning he admitted to the crimes,
and now faces 6 felony counts of written threats
to killer DuBotel injury,
police at Cogrid's also struck in St. Cog,
Cassini and Orlando.
Later, similar to Cogrid's or found on cars
at a home depot on Highway 192 in St. Cog,
a nearby Windixi and a target's door
on North Violin Street in Cassini,
sheriff detectives are looking to speak
to additional women in the mayhem.
Just look for someone right in the round with Opanizo.
That's gonna give you the first clue, right?
Oh, it's speaking of Israel.
This is one of my favorite stories of all time.
See, I think the one that really bothered me was that woman,
you know, seeing that we need to pay her $1,000.
She was so impressed by the fact that these Israelis were Jewish, you know.
Like, first of all, it's a novelty here.
There's nothing novel about being Jewish in Toronto, okay?
That's number one.
And number two, it's just, it kinders up that whole thing
about the birds of a feather flock together like a whole hanged.
It's annoying.
Their behavior is obnoxious.
They're acting like a bunch of barbarians.
And you're impressed because they're Jewish.
I'd be embarrassed.
How is humiliated?
That's it like a bunch of vile animals.
Anyway, foreign sokolov was among the legions of consumers who had turned
to Canadian pharmacies,
purchasing tablets to increase the strength of her bones
because the medication was cheaper in Canada
than her home in Fort Lauderdale.
Then she saw an advertisement in a Jewish magazine
that offered another alternative.
Now, Sokolov 74 goes on the internet and offers her orders of medication
from Israel where she can find lower prices than those of Canadian pharmacies
and where she prefers to spend her money.
There were enough companies that have been strangled
and not doing business with Israel because of the little boycotts.
And if I can do anything at all in my small way, I'll do what she said.
She was trellin as she said that I'm sure.
Tiver Krell all the time.
Israel companies such as
see this is spelled M-A-G-E-N so I'm assuming it's Megan David Medz.
Megan David Medz, not Logan.
Megan David Medz.com, isramedz.com,
court the prescription drug market by advertising
in national Jewish newspapers and magazines,
often fission lower prices in solidarity.
Megan David Medz.com ads tell shoppers they're going to be saving money
and supporting the Israeli economy at the same time.
For her first order, placed in May,
MeganDavidmedz.com tried so called off $115.80
for a dozen 70-mg tablets of phyza max.
What is that?
Harder.
For bones I guess.
Plus $9.99 for shipping.
The same order would cost $210.79 at a Walgreens in Tamarack
and $133.23 from Canada prescription plus
an online supplier for prescription drugs.
So if you save $18, almost.
I can't even much a Western year
of the Israeli government establishes drug prices
rather than allowing them to be saved by the free market
as in the US, rather than allowing the public to be raked
by the pharmaceutical companies such as the US.
The prices are as much as 70% lower in Israel.
MeganDavidmedz.com claims some brand drug named drugs
are identical in Israel,
others are generic products that have the same chemical ingredients.
But critics say Americans who buy from other countries
are compromising safety for cost
and you know what we're concerned about in America, don't you?
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
You got it. Safety, safety, safety.
Many Canadian pharmacies have disclaimers that if you're hurt
you have the right to sue them,
so tell them again as the FDA's director of pharmacy affairs.
If anything goes wrong with prescription drugs sold in the US,
he said consumers have recourse with the state pharmacy
board on the FDA.
It's more of a threat to public health of US citizens
because we don't know anything about these medications,
how they were made, how they were stored,
how they were shipped as opposed to your state licensed pharmacy.
They were in Florida, he said.
Soak a lot of say she's not swayed by arguments that US drugs are safer.
The American drug companies are rovers, she said.
They're not very straight with us, they're greeny.
I'm sure the drug companies that Canada don't wish to poison their people,
Israel does not wish to poison its people.
Nice going, Frank Florence, whatever you need.
So she's fine from Israel to support the Israelis.
They're nice, lovely.
And to save a few bucks.
Nobody ought to be able to talk to her.
Why not? You can do both.
There you go.
26 past noon at 5.
60 WDQ AM.
Got Moe off today.
Duh, duh, duh, duh.
And I said, so I'm going such a good mood today.
The ghost of Moe ain't lingering over.
He'll be back tomorrow though, Moe.
And look at all that Lenny Martez on this schedule.
First, the advert came in before to show this morning for his usual meat and
greek. Then everything's insolent, and of course,
but you know, a little meat and greek.
I said, how come Lenny Martez is all over the schedule?
And he said,
27 after noon at 5.
See if you made it. That's the reason, Troy.
Maybe that's the ideal deal.
The ammo cost is for this number one.
Ancient gourmet buffet.
That's not just my opinion, as I well know,
having eaten their decision times.
But also, the opinion of Zagat restaurant review.
U.S. Fortenau every Friday through Sunday night lobster faces back
by popular demand that ammo cost featuring main lobster,
served thermidor style.
And you can still enjoy crab fest every night with less than
snow crab legs, dungeon is crab, and Jonah stone crabs.
The menu still includes oysters on a half shell, and a sushi bar with over 30
but 30 men.
Different items.
In addition, the ammo cost his handcar,
a primary cook, just the way you like it, and from their flaming grill,
succulent New York steaks too.
Top off dinner with the Zod at the unbelievable 40-inch chocolate
fund, where you can hand it to your own strawberries,
marshmallows, other deck and treats,
which are a little cinnamon on it too, by the way.
And don't forget the ammo cost, and what's healthy living,
cooking all their fine cuisine with cholesterol,
free canola oil, no MSG, no headaches, no cornstarch, no crab.
So book your reservations at the NAMO cost relocations there in sunrise,
sunny-als, beach and tempered pines, for the NAMO cost call 954-572-3822,
when you're in the mood for a real pig out of real face.
This is the place the NAMO cost Chinese buffet.

I'm an epic fan here.
I'm an epic fan.
It seemed to me an academic at that going right.
You know, so that was right along the edge there.
That bit right on the razor's edge.
Right, that's okay.
It has my squeal of approval.
Here's the appol so far.
I'm telling you, we might actually make it to 700 votes by two o'clock,
right?
Probably not.
Now, it's 602.
Pretty, pretty weak.
Pretty weak, especially when we're not even asking for an opinion.
Maybe that's the reason.
Maybe if we said, what do you think about Neapolitan or
strawberry or vanilla chocolate or butter or a pecan?
Or maybe there's categories we left off like animals and machines.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, machines like that one guy.
Oh yeah.
It's a good machine, man.
Anyway, which of these applies to you?
I'm 100% heterosexual male with no-day experience.
It's been in 61, about 60%.
I'm a heterosexual male who's had at least one sexual experience with a male
84.
I couldn't get late in the horror house 62.
Yeah, we've met most of you guys.
I had a sexual female.
Located experience is 38.
So that's 6.8% of this audience is heterosexual female.
Okay?
Okay.
In fact, add that to the, uh, whatever.
I'm really a bisexual male.
You believe us?
16.
I'm a gay male who has had sex with a woman 11.
I'm a gay male who never had sex with a woman 10.
I'm really a bisexual female.
I'm a lesbian who's had sex with a man 5.
I'm a heterosexual female who's had lesbian sex 5.
And I'm a lesbian never had sex with a man 4.
Put that thing away.
Oh, here's the thing from Israel.
El too.
Most of the people who came to this protest
have only packed enough food, supplies, and water for a day.
We'll take off our silly caps.
Okay, you crazy bastards.
They're ordered from Ariel Shirondi, Israeli Prime Minister.
He has caught-
When in doubt, get the hell out.
Okay, go back where you belong already and cut the crap.
Oh, speak of the crazy people, the NRA.
Oh, yeah, my favorite, my favorite crazy people.
How come I got this in cranked-up so damn loud today?
Man, this is just a woman, can you tell?
Yeah.
Well, I like it.
Right.
The National Rifle Association say the S today
is pulling its 2007 National Convention out of Columbus, Ohio
because of that city's ban on assault weapons.
The city council passed a ban to lie 12 outlawing
the several possessive semi-automatic rifles
with pistol grips and detangible magazines.
The gun owners organization have planned to hold its annual
three-day event-expected draw as many as 16,000 people
at the Greater Columbus Convention Center.
Uh, Charlton Hester was supposed to show up pretty forgot.
The party is canceled because last week you said,
just can't stop thinking about him with a blue spandex
pants on and he would walk just shuffling away from life or more.
I just can't stop thinking of that scene.
The party is canceled because last week your city council
unanimously voted to revoke the constitutional rights of law
abiding citizens in Columbus,
by banning perfectly legal firearms,
NRA executive, as president,
the certifiable Wayne Lockheer said.
Hey Wayne, crazy person.
City officials said the NRA had been told there was a potential
for the ban.
Public policy decision, especially those affecting the safety
of our citizens, could not be influenced by any
narrow interest group that happens to visit.
Council president Matt Heybash and councilman Michael
Mantell said in the statement,
they both sound a little...
Oh, I made it.
Federal lawsuits have over two and two previously
attempts by Columbus to ban assault weapons.
The latest law attempts to avoid that by spelling out a
distinction between legal sporting weapons and military
style assault weapons.
The NRA also considered Portland or again on Reno
Nevada for the 2007 event.
See this whole idea about sporting uh, uh, weapons
uh, why?
Why, why, why, why do we need to do that?
Well, let's look at the points.
Can you put it out of those bad things?
And I stand with all this other sports shooting.
I mean, granted judge, Celia and the
tenure probably have to stay home more often, but nevertheless,
they'll probably both get special dispensation.
5670560, pound 562, we've arrived in
singular wireless line.
Don't forget we got 50 naked pictures of Katie Holmes
on the website today.
I'm beaty right.
Good with the pony.
Right.
How many QA and hello?
They're good today.
How many QA and hola?
My friend died.
Okay.
Probably happy about it.
How many QA and hello?
QA and?
That's it.
That was a medley of our call.
How many QA and hello?
Jamba!
5670560, pound 562, we've arrived in
singular wireless line.
I should know it was almost one o'clock.
That's right.
And some of our near and dear friends, you know,
the first couple hours that were like we said,
some crap, but some really different crap.
It was.
It was great.
And now we got nothing.
There is absolutely nobody on there.
How many QA and hello?
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, Neil.
Can I tell you what America and Israel has in common?
How many?
They're both sitting on stolen land.
Yeah.
That's awesome.
Okay, great.
Like I said, don't call us.
We'll call you.
Somebody QA and hello?
Hey, it's Valley.
Yeah.
Why don't you start 69 at Jamba, Jurgah?
And then him.
Now let me ask you something.
In other words, that got out of the ear?
No, we heard it.
Mahogad and he heard it.
Oh, that's a very good question.
Scary question.
Yes, it's a scary question.
It makes me wonder about this square little yellow button that I'm sitting here.
I mean, not that we don't have any, you know,
doubts about our technical capabilities here at QAAM.
I mean, that's possibly the anything,
you know, malfunction of the junction or her.
When I stop and think about all the times I've hit that thing.
So you might just both want to keep that in mind.
Okay.
Because I'm not sure that this thing is working.
I'll try a little bit during Geldy's show.
I'll cater the few times.
And see what happens.
How else can that be if you heard it?
That's right.
We could test it.
Yeah.
And how are you going to hear the ear?
Well, I got this little video over here if the battery's having died.
No, get out of here.
That thing, that's, you crazy?
Yes.
That's some of the story.
So many QAAM, hello.
I'm here.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I've been in Miami for six years and I'm sorry to say,
I only listened to you for the last ten years.
Yeah.
You know, that's pretty good.
So I think to advise, I'm moving to
Strathburg, Pennsylvania,
which is equally distant between New York City and Philadelphia.
Right.
I don't want to know who I'm going to listen to when the radio.
Probably who's never on.
I've always said before, whenever I'm going to go somewhere,
wherever I'm going to live, I always wonder,
who am I going to listen to on the radio?
Oh, God.
You sure in download your radio listening guy.
What is he trying to say?
I have no life.
As I was leaving, as you're going to be leaving town, sir,
why would you take your radio and flush it down the toilet?
Okay, put it in the bottom of a pool, whatever.
Who is he going to be listening to on the radio?
Probably whoever you enjoy, or if you don't enjoy anybody,
probably nobody, or maybe both of you, but I have no idea.
And guess what?
And couldn't care less.
Does that...
Oh, look at this guy.
We're going to miss him off the next guy's family.
Oh, I know.
I know.
I shouldn't have come, God.
He's a better family.
So one part of the solution is,
his mom's taking a very hard line against extremism.
Oh, his mama.
That's what they say in the Middle East, his mama.
Five, six, five, six, seven.
I'm telling you, man, I've been telling you this from the day one,
and I'm going to keep telling you,
and because nobody wants to say it, religious people are all crazy.
Thank God we're not fighting those tribal wars anymore,
like they used to do, like back in the early day,
and on back in the day, over pieces.
Scrubby, through.
Right.
Now that's what it's all about, tribal wars.
Mm-hmm.
You've got the tax doons and the cuckabooons and the, uh, oh, please.
It's just...
That's what it really is all about.
They don't want to grow up.
Can't have handled death.
And then now they're really going to have a duty about this thing
with the suicide bombers, again,
not that they've made a comeback and started up in Europe.
And then it's all about sex.
It's all about those 72 virgins.
So if we stop having so many horny young Muslims,
maybe we wouldn't have so many suicide bombers.
They're all just jones in for those 72 virgins
that they're going to be doing as soon as they get the reward in heaven.
And then they showed the, um, I don't know if you've seen the clips.
I'm sure you have.
When they had these midrasses in Pakistan,
and they showed the little kids like five and six years old,
and they're...
You know how they, you know how they do with the, like, the Orthodox Jews,
they dove in and they got away.
Wait a minute.
And these kids are diving like, like they're on speed.
They're like, have a bouncing up in them.
They're like bouncing off the tables.
Okay.
The faster you dove in, the closer you get to God.
Is that what it is?
Or the quicker you get to 72 virgins, one or the other.
And of course, if you got 72, you probably have to do it faster too.
1241 at 560 WQM, the Gellie Wormov Sheriff on QAN.
The clip comes to an end here.
It's a blue light.
You're still light.
You're still in the names.
It's a blue light.
A tear of fantastic joy.
Oh, you're hot.
But thank you for you.
And I'm not afraid to cross.
Yes, it can seem sense.
Enormous pain or stars in.
Why is it called chicken by the spear in the scene?
Fantastic to which you can look at that breath.
And find the most erratic part of a woman needs to booby.
I've been looking at your breath.
I've got to put a wide load sign on those babies.
I sort of ordered you to get there.
Fantastic to ready to be cut.
They're a proven margin puzzle.
Pretty shocking, like I have the results of this poll.
So far only a little over 3% of this audience gave me.
I don't know why that is.
Why is that?
They all move here.
Who I say?
Well, there's 14% go pretty bad.
Those in there.
14% or what?
All right.
Look, we're not interested in your aim.
It's a reason I took the poll.
We've heard your cock amaming crap for long enough.
And I don't know.
Let's put them in a given stair lie.
And their opinion.
By the way, here it is.
Everybody agrees with me except the gay guys.
Right.
A Christian.
You know, of course they do because they're all going to see that.
That's at any rate.
My wife and father.
It's like being a dead horse.
There's a man who's an expert on something
that he knows nothing about.
OK.
A Christian adoption agency speaking of good old time religion
that receives money from choose life license plates
said it doesn't place children with Roman Catholic couples
because they're religion conflicts
with the agency statement of faith.
Paul Bethany.
Are you pardon?
Just I was just taking it back by that.
I see.
Bethany Christian services stated the policy and led into a
Jackson couple this month.
And another message of a couple said it will rejected
for the same reason last year.
It's like good old time religion, baby.
It's been our understanding that Catholicism does not agree with our
statement of faith.
Bethany State Director Karen Stewart wrote.
Our practice not to accept applications from
Catholics was an effort to be good stewards of an adopted
applicant's time.
Money and emotional energy.
Sandy and Robert Stedman who learned of Bethany's
decision in New July, if let her said they're
pre-stolened in the faith statement,
did not conflict with Catholic teaching.
L'Oreal Williams of nearby Ridgeline said
that she and her husband West had a similar experience
when they started a pursuing adoption
September of last year.
I can't believe an agency that's nationwide would act like this,
L'Oreal said.
There was an agency who was Christian based but wasn't willing to help people
across the board.
Bethany based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which by the way is a horrible place,
has 75 offices in 30 states,
not Jordan, man, including three orifices in Mississippi.
The orifices are independently incorporated or affiliated with various religions.
Folks from in John Van Backenberg said from
agency headquarters, he wouldn't say whether any work Catholic affiliated.
Jackson Opus is affiliated with Presbyterian Church of America.
Glenn Demott's president, Bethany, said on Friday that the
policies open into interpretation.
He said the National Office doesn't ban adoptions to Catholic families,
but does allow each branch to establish rules for the
placement of children based on the agency's statement of faith.
As the Savior, Jesus takes away the sins of the world of statement
servant part. Jesus is the one in whom we are called to put our hope, our only hope for forgiveness
of sin and for reconciliation of God and with one another.
Sandy said, and she was hurt and disappointed,
that Bethany received from the true life car license plates.
I know a lot of Catholics who get those tags, she said,
soccer is,
yet if it's okay to accept money,
should be okay to open your home to us.
That's what I'm saying.
We're all surprised, Sandy.
We're out.
We're going to try to warn them.
I'm going to try to warn the Catholics that the fundamentalist hate them,
but you know, they're going to be like Bob Jones.
That's right.
I see.
What can this is, and I can't make it said,
Virgin Mary thing.
A few people would let go of the Virgin Mary and stop
rubbing them damn beads and put all them chascus down.
Maybe the fundamentalist Christians would've gotten to you,
but I doubt it.
Wouldn't be any fun.
No, and stop saying them,
Hail Mary is over and over again.
And I started on the thing before the break with the Madras.
There is a classic example.
Every time I see that,
that's what you need to know about religion.
This is what you are doing to your children.
Maybe not in exactly the same way,
but in some way, in some way,
or in that way,
in other ways,
in other ways,
just as insidious.
Because you don't slumping them out of church,
slumping them to shul,
sticking the bees on their heads,
forcing them to read a lot of mumbo jumbo,
but it's all manwritten crap.
A lot of written.
Of course, teaching them to hate anybody
who doesn't share their particular brand of crap.
I mean, when is the day coming?
We're going to start, you know,
the Frankl American crowd against the Shafoyard Ikroud.
You know, we don't like your kin to the pastis it,
therefore you must be, I think, least though.
You die here.
We're going to kill your ass
because you eat new on kind of canned crapola.
Well, it's all about your crapola anyway.
And they're dobbling and they're rocking.
And they're about to be put about.
They've got their magic carpet in there.
And by the time they're like,
eight, 19 years old,
no wonder they're doing the suicide bombings.
They're crazy.
They're a bedbug at that point.
They're going to see a bedbug in a fine carpet.
That lately.
For us, right in Iraqis,
we're actually, I've got a whole pile of stuff here.
I've been wasting my time.
Why didn't you tell me to stop with a stupid call?
I'm sorry.
Hey, so I'm going to be good though.
Q-A-M.
K-A-M-B-R.
Now you hit it.
Now you hit it.
He needs to be murdered.
He really does.
We need to do away with that one.
He needs to be taken out as they say.
Iraqis have begun burying themselves in their homes
and forming neighborhood militias
in an effort to end off
relentless suicide attacks.
Residents in the Capitol say yesterday.
Sounds like everything is fine.
Oh, we're fine.
The measures come amid waning confidence
in the Iraqi police and other security forces.
As they struggle to get on top of the two-year-old in surgency.
In the latest attack, 98 people were killed by a suicide truck
bomb south of Baghdad Saturday.
Well, this is the latest.
That's before the ones that we talked about earlier in the show.
I mean, the latest is whatever happened five minutes ago.
A senior member of Iraq's parliament on Sunday
called for popular militias to be created
as an extra line of defense
against the militants and criticize the government
for failing to stop the bombs.
The plans of the Interior and Defense Ministry
to impose security in Iraq have failed.
Qadur al-Quza'i told parliament
during a heated session following the latest blast.
We need to bring back popular militias
he said with understanding.
Then the good tourist login for a Baghdad.
Visit Iraq. It's a blast.
While there was some backing for his proposal,
there are concerns militias formed along
Santorio lines to lead the country
even closer to civil war
with Shi'id and Sunni Air Force already involved in
tit for tat killings.
Despite that fear, you heard it.
Despite that fear, local militias already
have informed the civil Baghdad areas
and at least two Shi'id militant movements
have their own powerful private army.
Sounds like civil war to me.
But what do I know?
Otherwise, there's no something here now.
I just see a machine that is passing.
No, no, glad to ask.
Fire?
No.
It smells like an open link.
Subtit tank.
Really?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Oh, don't tell me,
Santorio came by again.
Like, you know, when the gas traffic
and your bathroom isn't working right?
Right.
Yeah, like that.
Oh, don't tell me.
Maybe it's the spillage,
or maybe they're anticipating
the book will be from tomorrow.
Oh yeah, there's going to be a lot
of wild, diarrhea in that place.
It is going to be incredible.
I don't know.
You know, his Hank was kind of like,
like, why did I buy the mask?
I shouldn't have brought that up.
There was insensitive on my part.
And he could pull it out.
He could have a big jewel.
He could never know.
He could never know.
Are you a Hank people?
You better hop on it, man.
You better get over it.
And stuff like hanging a monster.
Of course, now that we got the basketball find the over,
we got that iron off there.
That certainly can only be a bonus.
Oh, God.
Please, please, clearance.
Stop it already.
He needs to be kidnapped.
Clarence.
He needs to be taken away
so that the rest of us can be safe.
639.
You think we're going to make 800?
What do you say?
Yeah, that's got to be our new goal.
We have to, like, down, down side.
You'll die.
Oh,�合 for sure, today's been put down here.
The song that the singer is terribly commanding.
It's probably an outstanding class tonight.
It's that broad.
It's that you know, punker.
Yeah, the, uh, what is school-lating school feature?
Whatever.
Yeah, the school feature.
You know, I've been up on the, uh, station.
There's our, uh, end of the year.
It's probably the way you're taking the show.
So, why don't we do that?
Yeah, so you're taking another place.
So, why don't we do our best?
So, why don't we do our best?
How's that, I can't teach?
We've been down down to the stage.
Everybody knows who plays.
We all know us now, why don't we do our best?
How's what the best?
I love you.
I love you.
There's nobody around.
bit too easy to come when I take a foot in my bed.
People think I take their times.
But if yeah I was crying over there.
Wait till I'm ridden enough it's every minute I can.

Your not on the AirGush for some reason.
How about now?
We have to reset, got back.
No, no.
We have to reset, got back.
My bad.
I have to reset or something.
The whole board would reset.
You call this a radio station
You're gonna hit a spot. I don't know what time it is
But if it's time for the 12 after break we could just play that and I'll play the one spot that we need to play
Yeah, the break we missed I see
Well, it wouldn't you know what you don't have a clock in there. It's no heaven. We just reset
So it's right it clocks a zero. I'm not resetting
I'm like my wife is pouring right along like it always does. It's one oh seven. It's poor. I'll write along
So in other words you want to incorporate that one minute in the yeah, whatever just take the break at 12 after and the only spot
I really need to play is that one we missed so well good. I'll play in this fine
We're just fine. Of course that kind of like I was hoping for about maybe 140 right because I don't like to be an

He said he had hoped to settle the case with a plea agreement not only for Debbie's sake, but for the young man's sake
She was crazy. She didn't know what she was doing. She'd know right from long
State attorneys office spoke from in Pam Bondi. I wonder she's keen to dig beyond the or viola Bondi

I'm surprised speaking of being off here.
I'm surprised that Clarence and somebody didn't come rushing in there and in the
reprint in the middle of our broadcast there's just a couple of minutes ago.
One or why?
Big news from Dolphin Camp.
Really.
Ricky Williams is expected to report to the dolphins for the first day of training camp
going to NFL.com.
Is this incredible or what?
For the number four official conversation for the new sounder at least.
Yeah.
You have them there?
Do I have a walk there?
New sounders.
A beer.
A free chance.
They're a buyer.
Oh no, that's not it.
What about this?
This is CBS.
For the record official conversation regarding his reinstitent will take place in the sleep.
But you want to be the yellow one.
From the polling news.
I got it.
I'm going to have to start over yet.
Ricky Williams, baby.
And we can dig out all those old Ricky Williams bits again.
What a joke.
Well they're desperate.
You know, they got to welcome him back with open arms and legs up as they're desperate.
Plus he's got the good stuff, you know.
That's what we hear.
How would he go?
Oh, to be fair.
Ricky Williams is expected to report to the dolphins for the first day of training camp
going to NFL by chance.
According to the report, a social conversation regarding his reinstitent.
We'll take place later this week.
But Williams is expected to be cleared by the NFL to report to training camp on Sunday
with the rest of his teammates in preparation for the first day of on field.
He'll drill the following day, two days from the one year anniversary that Williams abruptly retired.
He turned his back on him just like a Shane Corson.
Partying.
The report also says, don't give me star with that hockey stuff now.
This is the week for hockey and isn't it appropriate we are going to gel the on today, huh?
He's just gagging on it.
It's worth it.
According to the telephotoial event he told her at the loss of.
Turning out, Randy, you think that's what that's the only one?
Sorry, what?
You see, we got to get some hockey going, man.
Let's book a hockey show.
As a three-time offender of the league's substance abuse policy,
Ricky Williams faces the one year suspension and he pails the Mrs. drug test.
The offense first year coach Nick Sabin is welcome in the return of Williams and his confident it won't be this reaction.
I think it's going to be up to the team not allowed to be a circus and the focus is on what we need to focus on as a team to be successful.
Sabin said during a week's interview with a local media, it will also only matter if we let it matter.
Whatever that means.
It doesn't matter if you let it matter.
Okay, what is it about?
Nice going Nick, whatever you say.
Boy, they're going to have a brutally year with it without Ricky Williams.
They may be better off the son of Ricky Tickley, at least he plays cheaper anyway.
Here's a low test story just in.
A lot of stuff going on today, although it doesn't always take a lot of those really good calls.
12-year-old Juro sexually assaulted an elevator at Universal Studios Resort in Orlando.
A man followed a 12-year-old tourist onto an elevator at Universal Studios Resort and sexually assaulted her official today.
Orange County Sheriff Sergeant Richard Mankowicz, heavy assault happened 1130 last night.
After the suspect followed the girl who was alone looking for her mother from the parking lot into the enclave suites.
How did that happen, I wonder?
A key is required, how did what happened?
That she was alone and looking for her mother.
It's called incompetent parents.
Right.
A key is required to enter the hotel.
Mankowicz said the man followed the girl closely enough to enter after she unlocked the door.
Once on the elevator, the attacker told the girl he wanted to have sex investigators said he then told her to remove her shirt and when she refused,
reached under her shirt and touched her stomach.
He also said that it's a good thing he didn't do that to what's her name on guiding light.
What's her name?
Diana.
Nothing to be finer than to find out that Diana ain't pregnant.
She's wearing a thing.
He also touched the girl's genitals over her shorts.
Mankowicz said it appeared the man who carefully chosen the girl because he saw an opportunity to be alone with her.
The girl told the investigator she bit the man after he put his hand over his mouth to suffer from screaming.
Mankowicz said the suspect did not allow the girl off on the thick floor where her room was.
At some point the girl pushed the elevator's emergency button and went out of the elevator when it stopped on the eighth floor.
Detected Samara Mellage wouldn't release specific details about the girl accepting it from a brawn and her family recently arrived in the US and her mother's incompetent.
However, the girl had taken the stuff the fence course just to which police credited with helping her end the attack.
Always a good idea.
All your foreigners out there before you come to the US take yourself to the fence course because it's a jungle out there.
She was extremely shaken. She was just trying to calm down Mellage said.
She said the girl and her family intended to stand in the land of for up to two weeks.
She said the family wasn't fighting short the vacation because they wanted the state to help enforce them prosecute the man.
Investigated as distributed still photos captured from security cameras and the man leading the elevator.
No camera was in the elevator.
Universal Studios didn't take it over their mom to go far.
I understand.

A federal jury yesterday convicted Sandy goes new acting mayor and a city councilman
of taking payouts from a strip club owner to help repair a no touching law at new clubs.
The latest blow to a city of Washington scandal.
Oh, they got problems.
Michael Zouquette, who became interim mayor over the weekend, was found fairly of conspiracy
extortion and fraud on his first day of business in office.
He was immediately suspended from the position.
Councilman Raff in Nunza, who was convicted of the same charges, was also suspended, suspended
a sentence.
The jury also returned to early verdicts against former club candidate of the committee, Lance
Malone, who worked for strip club owner Michael Galardi to repeal Sandy, who was banned,
preventing new dances and payments from touching each other to repeal a hurt failed.
It is still unclear who will succeed.
Zouquette is commissionally the city rudderless of one of the most trouble points in his history.
Mayor Dick Murphy resigned left office Friday, a month into a second term cut short by mounting
problems.
It sounds like they're mounting a lot of things out there.
They have mounting problems.
And everyone, they're certain that people on our poll today also have the same thing.
They have mounting problems.
Eric Burman in the nation writes, first versus science.
That Bill Frissman, he walks out, anybody who's in the fristing, look out.
Last night, the Republican nominee at House of Representatives voted to loosen President Bush's
limits on embryonic stem cell research, allowing scientists to study cells derived from
sooner-be-discorded embryos at fertility clinics.
Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans could pass them over legislation as soon as this
week.
Could serve as realized they were opposing a popular policy that could be used against them as a
wedge issue in midterm elections next year and again in 2008.
So Senate Majority Leader Bill Fist has divided an alternative that undermines science
while scoring political points.
In 2001, Fist came out in support of embryonic research calling the science a promising,
an important line of inquiry.
But a month later under pressure from Christian conservatives, President Bush learned federal
funding to already existing stem cell lines, which are few and number often already contended,
that first quickly fell in line.
Now, his so-called alternative would bypass ethical constraints by obtaining stem cells without
destroying embryos.
Only this method remains entirely unproven and is yet to appear in a Major Scientific
Medical Journal or clearly peer review process.
Even scientists exploring this approach call the choice between supporting the bipartisan
legislation co-sponsored by Tom Harkin, our own inspector and Fist alternative, an old
brainer.
We need to pass the Harkin Spectre Bill, Robert Lanza, West President of Medical and
Scientific Research for Advanced Health Technology, Fold the Senate.
I don't think we should keep the scientific community or the patient community waiting.
The House may not have enough votes over why President Bush is fed a veto, which would be
the first, the Senate might.
As the undergoes chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, Spectre says he's manner than hell,
watching Republican scholars legislation that can help researchers discover an eventual cure for cancer,
Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease.
For a few chemotherapy treatments and see how you feel, Spectre told the AP, dismissing
opposition from the GOP's morning and Christian base, the potential for stem cells has been held in a
bandage much too long.
And for once he happens to be...
I mean, that single magic bull is there we didn't work all too good, but this one may have
a stomonet.
Finally.
You're not looking to good these days, are you?
No, I saw with that.
That hairy looks like a chemo with therapy patient or something.
That's because he is.
I see.
Oh.
Quad City's morning, Harkin.
Now this couldn't be an employee of Clear Channel, couldn't it?
Huh?
Absolutely.
J. Scott, who co-hosted the top read morning show at Clear Channel's country, WLR Quad City,
Iowa, Illinois.
His off the year following his arrest on the number of felony child sexual abuse charges,
the 50...
The 50-70-year-old Scott, whose real name is Aubrey Starcher, turned himself into Scott County,
Iowa law enforcement officials last week.
He faces two felony counts of lacivious acts with a child, and misdemeanor counts of an
decentist portion of the exhibition of obscene material to a minor, according to the molding
Illinois Dispatch.
The child in question is described as a seven-year-old female relative.
Okay.
Scott apparently asked the station for leave last week to attend personal issues, whereas
Scott off-guarded and shocked as anybody else, WLR GM Larry Roman Rasmillo told the news
analyst, the morning show for WLR, the market's top rating station is being hosted by Starcher's
co-host, Danielle.
A seven-year-old relative, no less.
I mean, you know, as you read each word, it became a little bit more grotesque.
Sure.
Well, maybe that's that radio pedophile ring we keep hearing about.
I was out of it.
It is.
After call, bloody evidence, and find out.
Hey, buddy, how's it going?
You're fair.
You're simple, didn't you?
You idiot.
You're quizzling.
What do we got?
Seven?
Seven thirty nine.
I don't think we're going to make it.
We don't make anything.
We're going to be divorced by two o'clock.
I'm out the rest of the week.
Now, that's a promise.
I mean, because this isn't even a vote.
This isn't even asking to put your thinking cap on, like a census.
And it's just a census.
It's a survey.
Our survey says, think this don't care enough this into great birth.
Or best worst, whatever.

Doug Thompson who writes the rant on capital Hill.blue.
Your very favorite website.
Got a good article as usual.
When I say capital Hill on blue.com,
is that what I say is either that.
Yes, that's what I should have said.
More dishonesty from an dishonest president he writes today.
President George W. Bush got another chance Monday to prove he was his
bitters his word.
Once again, he failed to keep a promise made to the American people.
In September 2003, Bush said he would fire anyone in the White House called
linking the name of CIA operative Valerie Plain to the media.
He repeated the promise in June 2004 saying flat out that any administration
official founder will talk to the press about Plain will be dismissed immediately.
That however was before his closest advisor, Carl Rove, got caught by the
mayor of giving the information to time magazine reporter Matthew Cooper,
who also identified vice president Richard Cheney's chief of staff as the
secondary source for the league.
Scooter Libby.
Now, dubiousing in a different tune, upping the stated by saying he'll
fire anyone convicted of a crime.
Anyone who knows the devil's standard of justice in Washington knows there's
little chance he'd roped for anybody else in the administration getting
hauled into a courtroom much less convicted.
So, Bush who promised Americans the most ethical administration history gives
Rove and the rest of his gang a walk for linking classified information to a
reporter as part of a Plain White House plot of revenge against a public
critic of the president.
It appears that the administration of came to office promising honesty and integrity
and will avoid legalisms as not defining ethical standards downwards that
representative John Carmier's emission in his White House and currently no
able be fired or forced to resign unless and until the jail cell doors locked behind him.
Bush has a long history of association with criminals from Enron Conman,
Kenny Lay, to scandal-widden House Majority Leader Tom Delay.
His vice president still underinvestigates in Europe for bribery and payoffs while serving
a CEO of Halliburton, the same Halliburton that's ripped off the U.S. government
with millions of dollars in overcharges through its no-big contracts in Iraq.
Honesty is a foreign concept of Bush.
He lied to Congress and the American people to try to justify an illegal invasion of Iraq
or to the Environmental Protection Agency if lied to New Yorkers about toxic substances
in the air after the Align Love of the Tax and lied again when he promised to
not have any one card leaking information on the wife of Ambassador Joseph Wilson,
a career diplomat whose only crime was looking objectively as the administration's
high claims about a recruiting purchase in Africa and saying the president croaked the facts.
A new poll for ABC News is only about 25% of the American people believe Bush is
being honest about the claim affair down from 50% when the investigation began.
Think of it. Only a quarter of Americans out there think the president of the United States
is honest, then making three quarters of them know Bush for what he is, a liar.
I can't speak for the rest of you, but I don't much like the idea of a liar occupying the White House.
I don't like the fact that a liar who did everything in his part to avoid serving his country in a war zone
now sends Americans to fight and die in a war based on lies.
It pushes not going to keep his word and fire Carl Roe for any other
administration official caught him in a shameful, Valerie Plain affair.
There's still one thing left he can do to serve the best interest of the American people, fire himself.
Holding your breath now, right? Everybody inhale.
Funny. That's why I go say inhale.
What's speaking of inhaling and van Haling?
Amsterdam police arrest the swimming burglar.
Okay. Amsterdam police arrested a fugitive burglar after he attempted to escape by
diving into a canal in the early hours of yesterday.
Oh man!
Woo! Talk about desperate. If you could see the water with those canals, their tails.
I mean brown. There's only one thing in the world is brown well anyway.
Amsterdam's scenic canals are flushed nightly and not believed to harbor diseases,
but people are strongly discouraged from swimming in them.
We go in the water if we absolutely have to, but we'd rather not,
since spokesman Leo Dirtland in this case it wasn't necessary.
A paraplegic on patrol recognized the 21-year-old man whose name was that released on the street,
they were interviewing about an unserved prison sentence when he suddenly died in the canal.
He attempted to elude arrest by swimming underwater and surfacing in unexpected places
at one point he climbed out of the roof of a flower booth bordering the canal,
then dive back into the water when police approached.
In the end, in the end, back home he surrendered a lot of self-to-be,
and he was placed out of the water.
Wow, what a disgusting thought. Talk about subject time.
Maybe that's what that aroma is in the building. Is it still stink?
It seems to have passed.
Oh, so to speak, no pun intended.
Fairfax Virginia, the woman who allegedly kept almost 500
we had this story a few last week I think.
The woman who allegedly kept nearly 500 cats in two Fairfax County houses,
agreed yesterday not to have any more pets.
Oh, thank goodness. Ruth Canoven, 82, agreed to sign a quarter-order in district court yesterday
that bands are promoting any animals.
Canoven spoke only once during the hearing, but she asked the judge to let her make a statement
because criminal charges are pending the judge said, don't do it.
She laid a decline to speak to reporters.
During raids this month, a convict's mother in a home
and her daughter's townhouse in Burke Fairfax County,
police found 488 cats nearly half of them dead.
Oh, that's a good news. The rest were so ill they had to be put to sleep.
So we turned to court in October.
I don't know, she...
Yeah, there's...
I'm gonna call Peter on her.
Peter...
I'm gonna call Peter Boulger, they deserve him.
After Colin Ferrell, the suey woman for allegedly trying to distribute and profit
from a sex tape he says that she recorded with the agreement that they would never make it too big.
The lawsuit filed yesterday in Superior Court in LA,
she's general and compensatory damages,
as well as a temporary restraining order and injunction
for herding the cell and exploitation of the videotape.
Ferrell 29 accuses Nicole Narein, a private distributor, to take through an intermediary,
that she had an intimate relation two and a half years ago
and both agreed to 15 minutes tape that shows the couple having sex
would be jointly owned by them, would remain private, corner-to-soup.
Narein cannot be reached for comment.
A call to a phone number listed for her revealed that number has been disconnected.
How unusual.
A message was referrals attorney was named by a media to reach her Monday.
The lawsuit also accused a 30-winner of working with the owner of Internet pornography business
and contacting the news media about the tape.
Defendants out of range of the time to capitalize on the celebrity of plaintiff Colin Ferrell
through their unauthorized commercial hospitalization
the highly private and confidential videotape exceeds all bonds of common human decency laws who have said it.
Ferrell who starred in SWAT, Alexander, decided to appear in the New World and Miami Vice
if the name were to be sexist men alive by people magazine and has a son with model Kim,
bored, bored and obv, is that her name?
I don't know.
Bored a Kim, bored, or like that.
He's been named more the sexist men alive by people magazine, which means he probably,
and he actually is, pretty or ugly.
And he can't act.
Other than that, he's dynamite, dynamite.
One of the best customers at the Chocolate Moose Restaurant in Farman, Indiana has never been inside the door.
Missy Joe, a 60-pound bulldog mess, comes with owner Tony Mills 51 of the restaurant for a daily treat of plain cheeseburgers
and vanilla milkshakes on the patio.
The tradition started seven years ago when Mills was moving his father's lawn,
noticed a barking dog nest during the town 50 miles east of Muncie.
Mills took a break and walked out of the restaurant, ordered a dog of cheeseburger and fed her over the fence, the barking stopped.
Eventually, Mills became acquainted with the dog's owners and for three years,
every time he moved his father's lawn or went over to visit, he took a cheeseburger along for Missy Joe.
In June, in 2001, the dog's owner's moved and couldn't take the dog to their new home,
so Mills asked if he could have her and the owner's agreed.
All of the dog may like the special treats, and Mills vet doesn't approve.
He doesn't think it's the best idea in the world he said, but Missy Joe acts like she's just fine.
Oh, where far?
She has an oil clog in the arteries and just clops over dead.
So if there's a barking dog in the hood, just give it a cheeseburger.
Oh, I see that cheeseburger.
They screwed him up, but didn't we know there was a least?
You see that?
No, I did that.
So not only did Vick and Herbs go the way to Lin.
But she's a herchiever, who wants you to know more?
Can you read there?
No.
I've eaten the pound.
And?
It's good.
I got my picture on the wall.
It was good.
Yeah.
Then have we known your least?
Did you hear what I just said?
I'll have to see, because there's one right there in Coralspring.
Oh, I'll be there.
Oh, maybe this is the one for Lauderdale.
So maybe it's just one.
So lamenté, uno.
