Well, you don't have an overhead there like I have in my studio.
I don't know.
That's an overhead.
The overhead speaker that lets you hear yourself in the callers.
What are you listening to the callers through? You wear headphones?
Oh, geez. That's not good for you.
We're very contemporary here.
No, you know, I know that's not contemporary. It's not healthy.
No. It kind of compresses your head. You know, and you've got a fat head.
You know, like a flat head.
No, a fat head.
So having those headphones on a fat head like kind of compresses,
like, like we're in one of those things where you're to lose weight.
You put around your waist, you know, to push all your feet together.
Oh, yeah, those white belts.
Right. Same thing with your head.
Maybe your head will lose some weight.
Yeah.
The incredible shrinking head.
Yeah.
Let me ask you something.
Did your head lose weight when you remove your hair piece?
See, how long did it take?
I haven't mentioned one word about my close best personal friend.
And there we go again.
What man, you think I was talking about powdered wings like Dolly Madison?
That's sinful. That's disgraceful.
Although you got to give me credit though, I embarrassed him out of it.
I embarrassed Steve Zivert, tossed his piece at IOD and then the same with your buddy Moe here,
with that awful, mostly muskrat used to wear it.
That was incredible.
And then he used to talk about my baggy pants and how to how to how to how do you leave the house looking that way?
How does anybody leave the house with a muskrat on their head?
And that's what I like to know.
Forgetting about picking the bingelberries, that's another story.
Boy, you got to admit, boys, here's been a colorful period of time.
There's no question about that.
Not enjoyable, but colorful.
Yes. It certainly has been.
You'd have to go a long way to match the kind of swill that's been then of course.
One of the world's biggest BS artists.
I kicked Howard's ass in New York, I didn't even.
I'll tell you, if Farrell was as successful as he claims he is, he'd be making 50 million a year.
He'd be like right up there with Stern.
He's had a lot of jobs.
The A-Shure has.
Job of the week.
I think he's working blessed already was in Atlanta.
No, no, that's long run.
He's been doing Fox Sports, whatever.
Oh, that's right. He's doing late overnight.
Whatever, they had that Atlanta thing.
They changed format.
After you got there, they got the format.
He has a habit of doing that.
No.
Not a bad person.
Just a little nuts.
Yeah.
So, but he's not the only one.
So, most overrated personalities.
Okay.
Celebrities, not personalities.
Most overrated celebrities.
I mean, we've done this, the mid-autumn, like Rosie O'Donnell and Rose Ann Bar, people that are just disgusting and have no talent.
Bill Mars, another one I just can't stand him.
Yeah.
Okay.
We'll work on that.
I'll work on that for a while.
Yeah, I'm not talking about actors and talk show hosts forever.
Well, what do you mean you're not talking about actors?
How can you have celebrities and they not be actors?
Well, there are celebrities who are celebrities because for whatever reason,
like, they're making a movie on either side, which is like polls, please, because you're just not a poll creator.
No.
How do you do a, how do you word a poll like this?
Most overrated celebrities.
Celebrities who aren't actors.
But, E.D. says, because they're making a movie about it.
You know who she is?
I have no idea.
She was a person hung out with Andy Warhol.
She was part of the session.
How could that tomato soup can?
Making a movie of her life.
She was loving me.
Well, how about him?
What the hell was he?
Hey, Andy.
Too fairy.
Other than that.
Give me a break.
That's part of that whole sued culture, you know.
Yeah, exactly.
Well, we're just not intellectual enough to understand that.
It's way over our heads.
So, it's just correct.
So, the guys like Ernest Tendingwey, they used to hang out in the bar, you know,
all their whole life, every waking moment, where like, their liver was just petrifying by the second.
They would understand any Warhol's art.
We're just old zoo slabs hanging out of the track.
Yeah.
Trying to cache a bet.
Trying to get that slot machine to ring a ding-ding.
Well, what's the story on that?
We hear any more about that or what's the deal?
May 1st.
May 1st was.
Slot machines.
Where?
There'll be an all four.
Well, I'll be dead.
I might just have to make the summertime visits to Pompato Park, you know what?
I think some of them are trying to get it done earlier, but I know that's what Gulfstream's target date is.
By the way, they changed the name of Hollywood dog track.
Yeah, Hollywood dog in the can, and slots or whatever it is.
Well, I heard a commercial for it.
They don't even mention Hollywood dog.
They talk about this place, this entertainment complex in Halendale.
What's it called, Jay?
I forgot.
It's a very catchy name, whatever it was.
Like festival or something like that.
I'll be dead.
Marty Gras.
It's Marty Gras.
Are they going to have early bird dinners there too?
That'll bring me Gras from Hollywood.
It came up with a very clever name.
It's Marty Gras.
And in September, it will be wiped out by a hurricane.
Marty Gras, you got the connection?
Oh, boy.
Wait.
I think we're moving along.
Yeah, that's enough.
I think you're out of material now.
You're right about that.
Then once you're out of material, they're going to start moving into areas that are not good.
Okay.
Not safe.
Yeah.
Well, you have a nice day.
Easy for you to say.
We'll see if we can go.
That streaming is up.
Oh, my God.
The streaming on the internet.
At least it looks like it anyway.
Are we making progress or what?
Go talk to Duff.
Maybe he'll tell you some stuff.
Okay.
Before you leave.
I will.
I don't want you to be in the dark.
Yeah, exactly.
Now I hear you.
And I know what I want to talk about tomorrow.
Yeah.
Because we don't have time today.
And that's our Stiffy, the sales manager, which you give him that name.
Yes.
And at the time, I was, because I, you know, I've only seen a guy, I think, twice in my life.
Like the last time I was there, he went running the other way.
So I'd become to the door.
But that's, that's a perfect name.
Well, he must be very busy today.
Because we don't have any spots on the air.
Yeah, exactly.
Well, it's kind of hard to sell when you're not talking to the talent when you don't communicate with him.
It's kind of hard to be involved in the sales department.
He's like back in a little cocoon there.
He must have, oh, and I'm going to say this to you, which will be a shock to you of all people speaking to your suspensions.
Yeah.
But screw in, aside from the personal stuff, and she was a miserable bitch.
But aside from that stuff, she was 100 times the sales manager, manager, or whatever that we got now.
Even you would have to agree with that.
Come on.
Screw in?
Screw in.
We had spots on the law when screw in was there.
You, you might have.
Oh.
She, okay, I said have a great day.
Not have a great day.
Okay.
I was going to say something.
But don't.
Okay.
The less said the better.
I'm being quiet.
Say goodbye.
Bye.
See you.
Just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just tell me what your problem is.
The picture yet, act as if I'm loud.
The government is still in your face.
They poke their nose where it don't belong.
So they can, even drop on you.
All your civil rights are gone away.
They can put a camera in your room.
Our four, five, there's one beast that's proud.
The bullet is in the grave now.
Now you'll know it's everybody's pride.
To lose your bill I'll drive.
With the preamble they've wiped their hiding.
Raccoon.
Okay, search to her stop.
But my grandma's having now tied up.
My phone calls can be tapped.
But top of my seat, they can do that.
Get a friend of sin.
Boops around and there ain't nothing she can do.
To find out what it's like.
To have no private life.
Total, total.
10-14, happy yet to be to this, every 27th of all,
was nice, so, confedulating with muff briefly this morning.
And I guess we got a couple of engineers in there, right?
Yeah, we got a couple of people in the station.
Couple of people in there, not too many.
They don't want to overdo it because this is a week for screwing off.
And we're making the big transition now.
We don't know the transition to what, we're making the transition.
I think the format changes in order.
Is that right?
Yeah, music.
What are you laughing about?
All right, I'll start preparing our music.
Here I can go out there and buy all kinds of good crap.
The music of your life on WQAM.
Nothing like music on AM, man.
Sounds like it's coming to a strainer.
Oh, and speaking of music, obviously, a lot of people.
I should have probably put that on there on the poll about satellite radio.
What?
People have it because of the music.
For example, we've got 80 people are going to get serious for Howard.
That's Howard Stern, by the way.
9% of the audience is going to subscribe for Stern.
So you see right there for that one guy, that radio guy that called yesterday,
give me a lecture about, well, Howard's not going to be happy.
Yeah, yeah.
That 100 million a year will keep me pretty happy for a while anyway.
Whether without the ego.
Anyway, it's already time for a break.
10.15 a.k.a.M.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 5.62 a.k.a.M.
And now it's time for our longest is dedication.
It's from Hank Goldberg.
Any rights?
Please play the air that I breathe.
And dedicate it to my Kim Bassinger Blu-Abdol.
In theaters now, from the director of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.
What's the next poll that's out there?
It's George Bush and the Goblet of Fire.
Not the moments you've all been waiting for.
Rarely is the question asked.
Is our children learning?
No more questions.
So not any more questions.
But sort of the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world.
And it will be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen.
But I can't learn.
There's an old saying in Tennessee.
I know it's in Texas probably in Tennessee.
There's this fool me once.
Shame on you.
The fool me can't get fooled again.
That was bloody brilliant.
Then again, I don't have a lot of intelligence to accept that.
George Bush and the Goblet of Fire.
Well, I think I need to learn to communicate better.
Goodbye, the end.
Twenty past ten.
We could only wish.
It's, you know, the crossover is yesterday and today.
Maybe I'm off my feet because I'm recuperating from my trip.
What about him?
This is a week, very weak.
Hank and me very weak.
And those are all the appauses that did here.
We just, that's because the whole place is in limbo now.
So there's not too much to talk about.
Right.
We do think that's got to be it.
It's got to be it.
Could be.
I brought those Patriots by the way.
I think it's coasted and everything got out of first gear last night.
I'd be rolled on by the jets.
I beg your pardon.
I said, I sure hope so.
You hope so.
What?
I'd sure hope so.
Well, the adults didn't coast on by the jets.
They had a struggle to pull it out of their ass right at the end of the game.

You know, you people out there with your parrots radio stations, you need mental help.
Okay, there's something basically wrong with this whole concept.
Well, I'm just going to start a radio station for my hood, you know?
Yeah.
Although the FCC called the Vibez Radio a parrots operation, a never acted one like one says
Durand Simon writes in a hero.
Instead of a clandestine operation, tucked away in a back alley of Perman had a website
and a Miramar orifice.
For almost five years, Vibez DJ's broadcast music community service announced Vincent
Commentary and Caribbean Polities and Immigration Issues.
But the FDLE shut down the Poverty Caribbean theme station in October, banning it for
operating without an FCC license.
Oh Bob, we don't need no FCC license.
We're just going to go on a year and play radio.
I mean, look at QA and we don't kind of FCC license.
We're playing radio, kind of, right?
Right?
So it goes to show you.
Vibez representatives said they hope to return to their waves and wouldn't broadcast
until they have a license.
I see.
It's like the community has lost at listener-or-rain Francis 41 of Miramar, probably
kind of Arlene Francis.
Now they don't know what's going on around them.
Well, open the window and look outside.
You'll see what's going on around.
You all kinds of fun stuff.
Vibez offered him music and news from Jamaica, a man and other parts of the Caribbean
Francis said the family has hooked on shows like Point Blank, a two-hour talk show,
and the Sunday rice and peas they separated old school music show.
He said, oh, they were playing an old school style.
They were kicking it old illegal style.
They give you more than music.
They informed me of Francis and said, when I listen to Vibez, it's like I'm writing
Jamaica on.
Vibez representatives said they were surprised when the FCC shut them down.
How do you like that?
Surprise, huh?
And then there's an Al Firaun, I guess, is the founder of this thing.
His company in vibration, one construction permits from the FCC.
In a 2004 auction for $1.3 million to build two FM stations in Periancedar,
Key to North Florida towns.
They hoped to lease time on a South Florida station for Vibez, apply for license for the North Florida
stations, and transfer that signal to South Florida.
But in vibration defaulted on a down payment in December 2004 and lost the permit FCC record show.
Firaun said the company didn't have the full amount by the deadline paid 70 grand
based on advice from their attorney.
It was enough to cover the payment for one station Firaun said, in vibration is appealing.
But the FCC said the station has lost a chance to appeal in vibration owed about 60 grand
according to the FCC papers.
Pirate stations like Vibez could undergo more scrutiny in the future, thank God.
A new anti-piracy law that took effect last summer makes it a third degree felony to broadcast
about a license or interfere with signals of license, public or commercial stations in Florida.
The legislation empowers law enforcement to arrest pirates and seize their equipment.
No one from Vibez was arrested but equipment was seized and a partridge in a fair tree.
Many of South Florida's pirate stations, by the way, FN pirates, have Caribbean programming on.
John Jaubone, host of South Florida speaks out, a talk show on WSRF1581 of the two Caribbean owned stations in South Florida.
Said Caribbean people feel their issues are ignored by other radio stations.
The Caribbean community is still searching for its voice, Jaubone said.
They're searching for their voice.
Well, there it is.
So in other words, we'll put our own station on.
We'll just do whatever we want.
We'll stick our own thing on it.
Great.
It's kind of like making up as we go along.
By the way, Jeff Hyde called during the break and he's still alive.
He's still alive.
He's still here and he said...
His birthday is actually Christmas day.
How many couldn't care less?
The only bad news is he celebrated another one.
And by the way, a nice job on a copy.
He's a one other spirit on December 16th.
On his way to Armstrong Ford right now.
Is he really?
That's right.
Well, I'm sure that's going to do us a hell of a lot of good bye at the end of the day today.
Let's see, are they running a spot today?
Probably not.
Oh, yes, they are.
Well, he's got an hour and a half to get that all taken care of, which I'm sure he won't.
Yeah, this is the Department.
We read, I know the audience.
Probably tires of hear me bitch and moan and scream about that.
And many other things too, but too bad.
It's my show.
And it's just we reach crisis beyond crisis levels with this crowd.
It's just it's pathetic what's going on here or what is not going on.
And then what you told me yesterday or what somebody told me, I don't think it was you or somebody sounded like you.
Yeah, about people back there in the eye.
Yeah, I mean, they're not selling because the rates are so high and the station doesn't get anybody any results.
I'm sure the people across the street be delighted to hear that.
Be sure and buy 790 because QA don't get anybody any results.
And their rates are like 50 cent a hour.
It used to be a dollar a hour.
They couldn't sell that.
So now it's more like about 40 cent about 30 cents a hour.
About a 30 cents a hour.
I think it's three for a dollar if you want a hour.
I'm about to write 790.
So let's get back to this poll now because I'm in the bag still from that trip.
This is the worst that I've never had taken me days to like recover.
I feel like I'm in a coma.
In fact, maybe somebody ought to like disconnect my tube.
56670560.
Who is today's most overrated celebrity?
Somebody who's big now, very popular now, but we don't know why.
Let me put Bill Maher on there too.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm going to make this list.
And then I'll facetare it later on, maybe around one o'clock.
Because the thing with a satellite deal, I think we've already pretty much,
but we'll leave that up for a couple hours.
Kill some good time.
Who is today's most overrated celebrity?
Here's what I got so far.
Paris Hilton, and she's ugly and she has no talent, but other than that, she's great.
I have no idea what she does.
I've spent a lot of daddy's money.
She's got a nice allowance.
Donald Trump, nice hair, Martha Stewart.
She bases some fantastic brownies.
Howard Stern, got a lot of people in this crowd like Howard a lot,
and they will pay to hear him on serious, but they're also a lot of people.
I wonder where's the beef.
They have listened and they would like to get paid for listening.
Jessica Simpson.
So, and I was at Hank that said she didn't look all that great.
Yeah, Hank doesn't think she's...
I don't agree.
Me neither.
I think she looks just fine.
She's not as pretty as Tom Brady, for example.
Well, I'd say one thing.
He sure looked good last night.
He shaved all that schmutz office face.
He looked nice and clean for the Super Bowl.
He's clean enough his act a little bit.
What?
What?
For the Super Bowl?
What are you laughing at?
Nothing.
They're rounding into shape now, although Teddy Bruskegan,
her last night, didn't help any, but they're rounding into form.
In case you haven't noticed, I noticed.
In fact, you should probably have noticed a couple of weeks ago when it played your team,
but never less.
And Bill Marr, a legend in his own mind.
He leaves me so cold and limp, and there's so many people out there including in this audience.
Oh, man.
He says all the stuffy, it rips bush, you know, and he's like, yeah.
Whatever.
He's just a twerp.
How about Terri?
Who the hell is Terri?
I probably don't know who she is, but she's been in the American Pie movies and she has a show on E.
I know who that is.
Is that our E.E.D.
lies in Greg Reed?
Our E.I.D.
Our E.I.D.
The separate that, so we wouldn't be confused with Greg Reed.
Right.
Don't do that.
Who's leaving W.Q.A. am at the end of the air?
We wish him all the best, and we hope he leaves very, very fast.
Because he did it his way.
Don't forget about that.
He's doing it his way.
And he is doing it his way.
Is it supposed to have like a little bit of class and saying, hey, guess what?
Here's what the deal is.
And here's the look.
Let's keep everybody in the dark, okay?
So that tells me because of that fact that's probably all those rumors that we heard before.
It's probably not his choice, you know.
Somebody has probably showed him where that door was.
And hey, Greg, here's the door.
See ya.
Like that.
W.Q.A. am.
Hello.
Not there.
I'm lying to you.
Not a good start.
Yesterday was fantastic on the phone.
I don't know why.
Neither.
We may not duplicate that again for a long time.
W.Q.A. am.
Hello.
Richard Simmons.
W.Q.A. am.
Hello.
That's just a deal.
Yes sir.
I got one for the poll.
I'll bet.
Jennifer Lopez.
I think that bitch.
Okay.
I'll put her on her, but she's like old news.
And she's like, what does she do now?
She's still making some crappy movies, but she's old news.
I'll put her on her.
I'll put anybody on her who's like a popular now, or at least semi-popular.
I guess we could put Ben Affleck on her too, huh?
Okay.
That works.
Does that work for you?
Yeah.
So many.
I mean, you just see these people on them.
Of course, there are all those entertainment shows, you know, ET and inside addition and all.
And the very latest and the greatest on who they're doing and what they're doing.
And they wonder, well, who really cares?
I mean, why would I care?
Why would anybody care about that?
Why would even those people care about it?
I wish I could answer that question.
But nobody can.
Is it me?
Because we're supposed to.
The media tells us we're supposed to care about that.
And like I've been telling you for a long time, that's the new deal with the media.
They tell us what stories like the chicken and rubah.
Oh, you've got to be whipped up into a frenzy about that.
Well, she disappeared.
Where the hell is that bitch?
Don't know.
Don't care.
Kind of like Jeff Heist birthday.
Well, there was a young decent looking white girl.
So, you know, you know, like, I see.
Suppose it would have been old like old Anciomama.
Then we wouldn't have cared so much, I guess.
No.
We got Moa too this afternoon speaking of old Moa.
Not as old as I am, but he's getting there.
In fact, he's going to pass me like I'm standing still.
Old Moa too.
Curtis Stevenson for the Mad Dog.
Mad Dog's finished up with his hard work for the year.
Won't see him no Moa this year.
Hurricane's warm up at seven o'clock.
And then the Stetson Hatters.
I wonder if they're keen to the Mad Hatters.
The Stetson Hatters at the Hurricane's basketball 930.
And I thought it would be a tremendous number of people.
The third man.
And for that crap.
And Jesse Agre follows the basketball game until two o'clock in the morning.
That just about says it all.
This is New Rogers.
This is 560 QAL.
It's the holidays.
Everyone loves Christmas Carol.
But until now, no one has ever written holiday songs about that other big holiday this time of year.
That's right.
I said until now, introducing Punika Carol's on TV.
Punika is always my Christmas.
It's ain't something new.
It's new, jitters.
Now we spend your night with you.
Punika Carol's on TV.
Spins like a cradle as it gives you hours and hours of holiday music to get you into the other spirit of the season.
On the 8th day of time, recall my mother gave her bed.
8 pounds chopped with a seven slabs of cornbread sticks, but 8 blocks of fire.
There's no gift.
If you're tired of the old traditional song of the holidays, there's a whole new tradition you'll get tired of almost before you know it.
You better buy gifts.
And then the man say, oh, you know how we hate to pay retail.
I let my eyes come in.
Show time.
Punika Carol's on TV.
It's the holiday collection.
You just can't pass over.
1046.
Happy Chinooka.
All you folks out there celebrating, lighting the candles and giving the gifts every day into the whole thing with the menorah and the kinaura.
We got 995 votes on the pool.
Our goal is a thousand.
What?
Yeah, I think we got a shot of that.
Panthers play a fairly pretty tough lifestyle that lost in the shootout.
Damn, three to two.
I'll be dang.
They were, they had one nothing and then it was one one one and then it was a two one panthers and it was doose doose.
And then they know no scoring the overtime and they lost in the shootout.
And that's just any interest there.
It looks like there were a few people there last night.
You didn't go, huh?
I did not.
Now, would you be going tomorrow for the Bruins game?
Yes.
To put in a couple hours there so you can scan.
I mean, get a little goose up your, that's right.
Or hours, right?
Good thinking.
And then get there a lot of every four to games there.
Now there's a team ready for the pickings.
The panthers are to kick their ass tomorrow.
The Bruins think.
Panthers are to kick their ass.
567-0560, pound five, 60 leave, Verizon and singular wireless line.
Who is today's most overrated celebrity?
These phones are to be smoking right now.
There's like thousands of people out there that we hear about just, I'll give you another one.
How about Sarah Jessica Parker?
I agree with that.
Totally.
She just, in every way, not just to her parents, which speaks for itself, but just in every way she grosses me out.
I find her an objectionable creature, but it starts with the appearance.
I mean, she really looks like a witch.
Yeah.
But she's not.
Oh, yeah, I just saw a blurb here for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
You know I'm a big Johnny Depp fan.
I mean, he was on my TV on a plane.
You know, you have your individual TV and business class.
Yeah.
And for some reason I was watching, I don't know, too much of it.
And I just, I know it's a kids movie, but God, it's just so bad, yeah.
Yeah, well, yeah, I didn't see it because it just looked really weird.
Well, no, it's not for you.
It's a kids movie. It's not for me either.
I mean, I like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or Willy Wonka, you know, back in the day.
Yeah.
But yeah, this one, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory just looked very strange.
Week.
Really weak.
But you know, it gives Johnny another opportunity to play a really goofy looking creature.
And that seems to be his main hair.
Yeah.
He likes to play.
I mean, he's very good in movies like Donnie Brasco where he looks like Johnny Depp.
And the one about to, what's the one that is something at the window?
That pretty secret window.
Secret window.
It's a good movie.
Have you seen Blow?
I beg your pardon?
Seriously.
Yes, I have seen Blow.
Okay.
That's his best movie.
Yeah.
I tell you we're going to say it blows.
Nope.
Somebody Q.I.M.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Sarah Jessica Parker is a real Parker.
She leaves me to limp.
Yeah.
How about Bob Barker?
How's he leaving you?
Would it smile on your face?
Somebody Q.I.M.
Hello.
Hey, good to meet you.
Yes, sir.
Is Neil?
This is Neil.
Oh, you happy to have that?
Yeah.
Um, wrestling on.
No, he doesn't get it.
Doesn't get it.
See, yeah, look, there's a big segment of this audience.
To make them happy, every day we take a poll and the answer would be either George Bush or Rush Limbaugh.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
There's the top.
Rush Limbaugh is not in a celebrity category.
We don't see anything about Rush Limbaugh except when he was doing his pill popping and stuff like that.
But, you know, you don't see him on entertainment tonight inside edition.
He's a radio Nazi, okay?
Get with it.
Get with it.
When are you people going to hear?
So that's one of the reasons I hate talk radio.
I mean, I hate it.
I despise it.
Can't stand it.
All the political animals out there, everything has to be.
It has to come back to the same crap again, okay?
It's the holiday season.
I know it's not easy.
We got people dying like flies over there in Iraq, but just for once in your life, just to suspend all of that crap and just a little bit on the lighter side.
Just rip somebody else and ask.
You know, just send your venom in a different direction, your venom in South Florida.
Besides poor Rush.
Pop it out of the one Rush.
That's it.
WDQAM, hello.
QAM.
Hey, QAM format change.
Go Caribbean.
All right.
Now we're talking Yaman.
That's the answer.
And everybody can smoke a big fat one while they're on the airman.
Roll it up in the newspaper.
Certainly not the Harold.
God, would you want to smoke anything in the Harold I don't think so.
WDQAM, hello.
Any other I agree with you, that?
Good.
WDQAM, hello.
I love the way he affects that voice, so it takes like about a half a second and you know who it is, aren't?
QAM.
QAM.
WDQAM, hello.
Not there.
Boy, these are good.
I told you to don't start it out with a bang here.

No, like yesterday I knew that would not happen again any time soon.
That happens like maybe once, oh, I've been around every 60 years.
WDQAM, hello.
Yes, sir.
All right, speak, Neil.
Speaking.
Hey, Neil.

It's good for you.
You'll kill what else you're in.
You too.
Turn your liver into like a sawdust.
WDQAM, hello.
Good morning, Neil.
When is the end?
I think that was...
As far as yesterday's pull, I would never pave a radio.
Not as long as you're on the radio.
And for today's pull, I would probably say somebody like...
I can't understand how anybody could stand...
J horn or Melissa Rivers.
Yeah, they're both around.
In fact, I had to miss Forksin' because I couldn't sleep at night in Amsterdam.
My body clock was all screwed up.
Three o'clock in the morning, there's the Larry King show with J horn Rivers sitting and talking about suicide.
Oh, God.
I was in maybe want to blow my brains out
Of course also had Melissa on there with her okay
Joan rivers and Melissa River. Let's put them under individual, huh? Yeah good picks
Yeah, she had Melissa on her too and of course she had our link letter on her whose daughter committed sausages
Melissa rivers what what an uplifting show for the holidays a show on suicides nice going Larry
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 need Verizon and singular wireless lives. We got Mo. Howard data to Curtis Stevenson and for a bunch of hurricane basketball crap after that
And Jesse Agler at 9 30 or whenever the game ends and you'll find out he's no anymore test now
What's the story on him do I ever heard him Jesse Agler? Yeah, he's actually good. He he does the pre
the pre game on the pan� post came in the panthers and he does Barlin's extra
I don't know so he actually like a real broadcast. Yeah, well, how do you like that?
So we alternate Monday through Thursday last night it was Lenny Martez tonight
We got Jesse Agler Lenny's back tomorrow in a Jesse Agler on Thursday now why we don't have Lenny
Jesse on all four nights like if he's really a broadcaster
I have no idea but Lenny Martez must have some of those naked pictures of Greg and the Billy goat
It got to be because let now Lenny's a good guy. He's one of the really good people around the building
Yes, he is but he just don't pull long on here
That's all can look to read across me of Q.A.M. You can't speak WQ. I am hello. I want to play some jingle
WQ. I am hello
Dr. Phil that has protégé overwampering his protégé, okay
I guess Oprah's she's still on I don't ask me why I'll put that bitch on her to a doctor field out of there
It's from real swill doctor Phil
See he's another one at this audience would like to have on every poll
But in this case rightfully so one of the biggest frauds one of the biggest con artists and then he writes a book about
Diting and he happens to be fat but other than that even he's got a fat head like Hank
Dr. Phil's got a fat head
You notice that I did the bad part about it here is that
CFT and new CFT O news, which is the best local channel for news. I watched them every night religiously at six o'clock
Right before their news case is Dr. Phil
And so I try to make I try to time it so that they're in the last commercial before in other words
He doesn't come back on because I just don't want to see him runes by day
WQ. I am hello
WQ. I am hello
Yeah, Neil you were talking a little bit about
Oh
About bow
I
Was
I was waiting to see what that one would go about bow
Yeah, a little bow people. Okay. Take a peek at this WQ. I am hello. What about those see you next time on the view?
No
WQ. I am hello. Neil. Yes, perfect name for your poll Tom
Okay, Tom crew is overrated
Screamer and Tom Hanks
Is he still around I guess I think he's still alive I'm not sure I don't know he's alive, but okay Tom. How is it working?
He's oh, that's right. He's one of those goose steppers. Yes, he is
Thank you, paly. Yeah, that's right very hard to figure that out kind of like a Robert Griefer, you know
One of those self-hating deals. I was just like break two minutes. Is that what I'm seeing?
Yeah, but I made three. Oh, because the first two minutes are trade-outs. Is this gonna be an all trade-out sweep coming up?
Yes, it is okay all trade-outs in this break. Okay, mark it down
This is Neil Rogers
This is 5.62
This is the Neil Rogers show
Any questions
This is there some stations will give you can some stations will give you can but not this station because this station is going to give you a chance to redeem the sins of all mankind
That's right. We're going to crucify you
Neil you did a gruff be a big hero
Start your own religion even have a little magnetic dashboards that you made in your image
Just be the 10th color when you hear this
And we'll set a bunch of angry Romans to drag you up
Put you up and nail you down if you've got a hammer and nail we'll put you up for the night
This station except no responsibility for we know not what we do
Redeem the sins of all mankind
People listening for your chance to win. Why sure like that this station except no responsibility for we know not what we do
All I can say is amen to that
Yeah
1337 votes our goal was a thousand so we're way over the top. Oh look at that one killed in six wounded and Canadian shooting spray ain't
Search for the new journey then they just kind of like slough right over that
Who cares about those Canadians anyway you idiots on CNN hope you all croak
What's your take on subscription radio we asked 1337 votes?
This is our this is the current poll not to be confused with tomorrow's poll
And then the one for a Thursday
I'd never pay for radio 439. I don't blame you 42.3% I wouldn't either the crap that's on who to help with pay for radio
I'm considering subscribing
235 I've got serious 150 14 and a half percent of this audience are serious
We'll get serious for how it's firm 98 that's a little over 9%
I've got XM 92 that's 8.8% SM I guess this for redneck truck drivers is what it's really basically for
Yeah, I don't know about that. Did you know that? Well, that's what Joe Castello told me he had to know he works for XM
Well, he does the NASCAR that's why they didn't want me on theirs because oh they just couldn't imagine and truck drivers listen at
Faggot near Rogers on the air. Oh my god. We don't want to aim on XM
We don't want some Jew Faggot like that from Miami or wherever the hell he is
Yeah, I'm telling you that was the my name got tossed around there too, but oh no, no, no, we don't want that
Him that old boy's ain't got a condom that crap
So 92 with XM 150 with serious you see that almost double I had XM and dropped at 16
I had serious and drafted seven so more than double drop so XM sucks and serious
I guess the words had according to these even though serious as they got only like a lesson half the subscriber so far
Well when you consider that over 9% of this audience says they're gonna get serious when Stern goes on there
Which they better get serious pretty soon because he's going on January 9th is it? Yes
How do I know that if I seem it like how many thousand times in last couple weeks?
It's kind of like ingrained in my every show that you turn on right. Yeah, that's right
Even on the cartoons on the kitty channel even on Nickelodeon even on the old-e shows there he is. There's Howard
The King of all hype make no mistake about it
Nobody Q. I am hello
Pretty good sir
Hey, listen to him. People need to get serious and get over as far as paying for
Serious radio. I think a lot of people are just curious to hear what how it's from just gonna scream out or
Say on the mic
More than actually being serious about listening to the radio for your poll
The gentleman or lady what everyone to call it
Kevin is that the name that's on the catch to beneath the hood?
You know what I mean Kevin Fetterline. Yeah, what is that?
I'm reading yeah, I understand that but he's they they got
Okay, well if you understand that the full question was who was today's most overrated celebrity?
So when he says I understand that but you right though. I mean they've made him okay, okay?
I mean that's totally disagreeable because it's the holidays and because I'm like a still recover
From my ill-fated trip Kevin Fetterline all he's unlocked up a couple girls and well
He's not a celebrity though, but I guess on a celebrity shows. He's a celebrity and I guess maybe that's exactly like I said
I apologize to the caller you got your thumb right on it baby. I
Mean if Josh agrees who the hell am I what do I know an old toad like me? What do I know about Kevin Fetterline?
Other than he's ugly and schmutzy and grotesque and she sure ought to be doing a lot better than that. Oh, man
She she could be doing anybody of course for all we know maybe she is
You know I'm saying maybe it's not his baby. That's correct
She could be doing any guidance you wanted she could be doing a chip that you wanted she could be doing like anything a lie any animal
trees

I don't know what she's on, but she's the big, she's like supposed to be the next Brittany
and she's like, oh yeah, I know this.
Hillary Duff.
Hillary Duff.
Get off your Duff, Hillary.
And she's not good looking.
No, she's a gross little punk.
Nasty bitch.
Hillary Duff.
Can she sing?
No.
Can she sing?
No.
Can she hide?
No.
But he got any talent?
No.
Not that we know of.
Hillary Duff.
Get off your Duff, Hillary.
You must know the right people.
That must be it.
She must know and whatever.
The right people.
Look at that.
Our goal is 1100 votes.
We got a 1085 on a serious and the exact same thing.
I guess about noon, I'll put this thing up.
I'll fix it, Derek.
Okay.
I'll fix it, Derek, about the 20-till noon.
I'll give him plenty of time.
The fact that he can actually hear us.
We're streaming today.
A little incoherent still from that awful trip.
Yeah, my head is foggy.
That's not good.
I need to clear my head.
Another thing, I think it's the change in me.
Because in Amsterdam, it's very, very humid.
It's damp.
Yeah?
And it's this constant.
It's like always, like this type of dirges,
I call it the Amsterdam drip.
It doesn't usually rain really hard.
It can for periods of time.
In fact, the day that I got there, we could go a Saturday.
It was like drizzling and then it was like half-snaping.
It was snowing a little bit and then it was like snow pellets.
There was like a little bit of everything.
Ooh.
Yeah, nasty.
And that was really, really nasty.
But the other day, it's like, during the day, it's like Sunday turns the faucet on
and it starts dripping up in the sky.
And just that little drip that annoying, you know what I mean?
That raining hard.
You know we need an umbrella.
Just your tuk.
Sounds miserable.
Yeah, exactly.
Now I think you got your thumb on.
This is Neil Roberts.
This is by 62A.
If there's a butt, I smell it.
Billy, time for your animal.
On Steve's mom, not another animal.
Kids just hate getting animals.
And mom's a giving them.
But now there's a brand new animal that kids just love.
Introducing you in an animal.
The candy coated chocolate animal that makes getting cleaned out fun.
Hey mom, can I have another animal?
I don't know Billy, that makes your third animal today.
Please, well, okay.
Cool.
And this time, I want a green one.
Oh, sorry son, I took all the green ones.
I did my two boys.
New, M and Anomas.
Mails in your butt.
Not in your hand.
Let them.
Tell.
It damn near kill them.
Okay, 1117, too much of that, uh,
Let them stuff, okay?
That one guy's going to be calling back in from my voicemail.
Let's play all the voicemails again and not, not creep them out.
Or not.
Is the case maybe?
Yeah.
I should have asked Hank what that sponsor was that he got suspended for knocking.
567, 0560.
Town 560 and leave Verizon and Singular Rhinocelines.
That's a good idea.
Let's work on getting suspended for the rest of the year.
Then we can do like everybody else there.
I just screw off.
Like Clarence, there's another one with his Jaguar.
I, you know, there are a couple of times last night.
It just popped into my mind that you told me that.
And I just started chuckling like out loud to myself.
Luckily, I was, you know, sitting alone in the room there.
But just, I just can't even conceive of that.
Yeah, he got one when screwing left.
It would be like, are you mean the Jaguar?
Yeah.
It would be like trying to envision McCulloch, McCulloch,
as driving a Jaguar, you know?
I'm talking about when he was like 10 years old,
sleeping with Michael Jackson.
Now, how about him?
Should we put him on air?
Is he doing any movies?
What about his pain in the ass kid brother?
I mean, I don't think they do anything.
Do they?
I don't know.
I'm not, I'll wait.
Somebody QAM, hello.
Hello.
Somebody QAM, hello.
Hi.
Is this the radio show?
What show is that?
Sports radio.
You're calling a sports show or the new Roger show?
Yeah, right.
Yes, him.
Him.
I want to say, I think Cindy Sheehan, this year,
is the most overrated person.
And why is that?
Oh, God.
Cindy Sheehan.
Yeah.
Do you know her?
Of course.
Why is she overrated?
Because she had balls, which obviously a lot of other people don't.
Because she's upset that her son got made into a human sacrifice.
Her son, him listed honey.
Yeah.
Okay.
He enlisted, he dropped off the sign on it.
Get out of here.
I'm not interested in your brother.
How are your mother, your mama, bitch?
Her son enlisted.
Last time I checked so that everybody else enlisted,
okay, we don't have any draft going on honey.
Isn't that nice?
Cindy Sheehan, she don't like because her son enlisted.
So we deserve to die in a war based on lies.
Of course.
Don't you know?
What a bitch.
And happy holidays too, by the way, bitch.
She wants to talk to sports show.
Yeah, yeah, him.
Yeah, him.
So you see what I mean?
Have we been talking politics?
No.
No.
We've been saying like anything like it.
You just can't.
Who did moral for the same community?
Cindy Sheehan or this bitch that was just on the phone.
Who did moral?
How about Cindy Crawford?
She is still around?
Yeah, I think she does something here and there.
She's okay.
Yeah.
I was just trying to think of a Cindy that was over there.
It could be good for the poll.
Yeah, you got me.
Now, can't think of one.
Somebody Q.A.M.
Hello.
Well, good morning and happy everything to you, sir.
Happy all these silly ass holidays to you, right?
What a bunch of crap.
Yeah, I just heard the voice of that nicotine latent witch you just called.
Yeah, that bitch.
Yeah, I got to tell you the best press and I got this holiday season
was a picture of George 41.
And the caption I was, I shouldn't have pulled out.
Let me tell you something.
I'm a highlight of my Christmas.
Well, good.
And you know something.
This is the sports radio stage style.
Believe you with this.
These people call and scream when the team loses the change managers.
Well, we're getting screwed around in Iraq.
Why can't anybody understand we need to change managers there too.
Yeah, okay.
Have a nice life, Fally.
See what I mean?
Oh, good.
God Almighty.
Hate talk shows can't stand them.
Fight what?
Oh, nothing.
What do you think that like in my spare time I listen to talk shows?
Even if I forget about it, I'm burnt out on talk shows.
I said this one.
I don't blame you.
And the only reason for that being it makes for a big fat paycheck.
But good God.
Give it a rest already.
Would you please give it a freaking rest and he's not going to have bitch to call before?
One, dimensionless.
All you know, okay?
And even though I agree with everything he says, but I don't want to hear it.
I would like a rest room at this week.
Okay, give it a rest.
Just like all those dead soldiers over there.
They're taking a long rest.
Give it a rest.
I mean, what do you want?
Rumsfeld went over there and gave him some nice plastic.
Turkey, what more could he do?
W.C.Y.M. Hello.
Shaving cream or tail?
I wonder if maybe he'll get the bird flu, you think?
Rumsfeld?
W.C.Y.M. Hello.
You know, I got three people that are definitely some doodies.
Carrotop, Fred, Dirt, and Polly Shore.
Okay, Carrotop is the final.
Polly Shore, where do we see Polly Shore?
I'm sooner than going to walk down the sunset, other than it was the hottest chicken hour.
I am trying to hate, but this guy is definitely a turd.
Overrated.
Overrated.
Okay, I'll take your word for it.
He ain't trying to hate.
Right, but he'll make an exception in this case.
And I'll blame him.
I'll put Carrotop on there.
Just one.
Not who are today's 55 most overrated.
Give me one, because the list is going to be name of it anyway.
So many overrated people in so little time, you know what I'm saying?
That's right.
Overrated people, celebrities, okay?
Celebrities, not Cindy Sheen, not George W. Bush, not Donald Herman Gearing Rumsfeld,
not Dick Cheney, no, celebrities, not politicians.
God.
WQAM, hello.
QAM.
Yeah, hi.
You got a yacht across Bono, after this, and right in for the poll, William Hahn, that guy said, ball.
Overrated people, celebrities.
How many QAM, hello?
You're learning, thank you for your time.
Yes, sir.
Very good.
She's the first one on there, sir.
Very good.
How about Dr. Philly, like to add him on there too?
Yeah.
And how about Donald Trump?
See, that's my bad.
I should probably do the break, I'll fix this, Eric, and we could like, let's go.
Yeah, he said, he said sooner or the better.
Oh, in other words, he's got probably fish to eat.
I mean, fry.
He's got stuff to do.
Thousands said, oh, well, I'll tell you what I'll do right now.
I'll let you read the poll.
Oh, you're going to read the poll?
No.
What's your take on subscription radio?
We have a 1079, both our goals 1100.
So once we get to 1100, I'll fax it to many, see what I'm saying?
We'll do it.
In fact, I'm refreshing now, and it's not coming back up.
Oh, 1081.
So vote on that one now and get it out of your system.
I'd never paid for radio or 452%.
And like I said, I don't, I just, I don't know.
I see that with me, I don't listen to the radio anyway.
I don't listen to radio.
Here, I try.
Here, there, anywhere.
I just, I don't listen to it.
As far as music is concerned, I'll listen to my own music.
I've got CDs.
I mean, you know, it's just, I don't, I don't need somebody else to play music that I don't want.
Maybe one out of every five.
I might want to hear it again someday.
You know, that's, that's the idea of enjoying music.
But hey, that's just me.
What do I know?
42% would never pay for radio and I'm with them.
I mean, what's so great that you'd pay to listen to it?
I'm considering subscribing to 44.
And you know, the guy that called yesterday was talking about, you know, playing your own CDs.
He's heard them all a million times.
They have these amazing things called CD burners that have been out for like 8,000 years now.
And you can make your own, you know, compilations and you can make like Zidians of them.
You know, correct.
Whatever you're in the mood for, you hop in the car and whatever you want to listen to.
Do you follow what I'm saying?
Are you saying you download music for free?
I, I just got through sand.
I don't listen to a period.
I'm talking about you people, all you thieves out there.
And addition to which I'm not talking about downloading music.
I'm talking about taking your collection of stuff and burning CDs.
See, you've got a villainous mind.
You're talking about Stephen Crap.
I'm talking about making your own compilations.
Is it really stealing?
I'm considering subscribing to 244.
22.5%.
I don't let's find out.
Let's, let's call you in right now.
Let's, let's call up the authorities and say,
George Cordis is downloaded 85 million songs from the Internet.
Is it stealing?
What do you think?
We're not.
We just haven't been there for me to take though.
Right.
He's, he's downloaded 44 trillion songs.
Some that have been written yet.
Okay, considering subscribing to 244.
That's a lot.
I've got serious 156.
We'll get serious for Howard Spurm 101.
9.3%.
We'll get serious.
I got XM 101.
We'll good for you.
Probably truck drivers.
I had XM drop that 17.
Had serious and dropped that 7.
Out of 1090.
We need just 10 more votes.
So during the break I'll, uh,
fax the new poll to where I work.
I'll have like a little,
a little something to do there.
A little, keep these people off the streets.
This is the new Roger's.
This is 516.2.8.
The most talked about film over the year.
Is now the musical event of the year.
The broke back mountain soundtrack.
Is rain man.
Is rain man.
Is rain man.
Is rain man.
The songs you love.
From the movie you're afraid to admit you love.
Oh, no, no.
I will try.
And I'll try to have a look.
I know I'll fail.
Strap on your leather chops and yell,
write them cowboy.
The broke back mountain soundtrack.
It's fun to stay at the YMCA.
The they have everything.
Recome and you enjoy.
You can hang out with all of them.
Oh, they love the old Sam's goodies.
It's 11.31.29 till noon at QAM.
Why did that strike me so amusing?
I don't know.
I did it.
I don't know because we got 113 votes on there.
And I just faxed the new poll.
The new one.
11.03.
So we'll leave that up for one more.
I mean till Eric gets this other one.
So fat boy had a birthday yesterday.
He was still alive for it.
What a shame.
That's right.
We still got a lot of work to do.
It was actually Christmas day.
But I'll be damned.
Okay.
The birth of our lord.
5670560.5060.
They've arrived in a singular wireless line.
That's the fact he uses to you by the way.
Fat boy.
I just cranked this thing up and I can hear myself now.
I feel a little bit better.
Maybe the fact that I had to like, kind of like, money, you know?
And I was like talking money.
You think that was it?
That was it.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
What the...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wouldn't you?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Good one.
Excellent job, Polly.
Keep bringing that phone.
5670560.
You see I just cranked that thing up so I can hear it a little bit.
Now I sound like almost animated.
That's all it takes.
As compared to before.
Am I not?
Or is it just my imagination?
You're very animated.
Animated.
Like that M&M, M&M, M&M, M&M, M&M.
Oh, there's another one.
Oh, let's put him on right away.
M&M.
You know, I mean, if you want to be black, do we like, uh, Al Jolson and Larry Parks did.
Put some black face on, you know?
If you want to be black.
Ain't going to work, but, uh, he's a pathetic.
Come in to QYM, hello.
Hey, Nila, how you doing?
How are you doing, Polly?
How are we doing?
How about for the poll, Ellen DeGeneres?
She leaves me very limp.
Yeah, Limp is not the word.
I have a good one, buddy.
And back to you, Ellen DeGeneres is good for nothing.
And there actually are people who like her, of course, they're all gay, but nevertheless.
I don't see what the deal is there.
There is no talent whatsoever.
Is she funny?
No.
Does she look really great?
No.
Is she, uh, nothing?
Well, maybe that's what it was.
Nobody, she danced?
Huh?
That said, maybe that's what it was.
Nobody liked her.
So she said she was gay and that she has that population.
No, no, I don't think so.
If you don't have this one, I'll say that.
Somebody QYM, hello.
Hello, Neil.
Did they propose?
Okay.
Uh, Professor Ditty or P. Daddy, whatever they do.
Whatever his name is this week, okay?
I don't know what the hell he ever did, but make him the fan at all.
He sucks.
Amen.
Stop.
All right, buddy.
Yeah.
Now, how do we put him on her?
P. A. Ditty, daddy.
P. Ditty.
P. Ditty.
Uh-huh.
Ditty.
Just Ditty?
P. Ditty.
Oh, P.
Ditty or Ditty?
Ditty would have P.
Yeah.
P. Ditty.
Ditty would have P.
Ditty, Ditty, Ditty, Ditty, Ditty, Ditty, Ditty, Ditty.
And I think Ditty is the operator word.
He sucks.
Although he supposedly was doing jail, she's another one of those faghags, you know?
Ben Affleck, P. Ditty.
She's been around the block.
Yeah.
And then she was also, she was married to that ballet dancer who I think was going out with Ron Reagan Jr.
The ballet dancer.
That's nice.
She's just a fag magnet.
Okay, we got that pool.
I don't know how long it's going to take her.
Oh, look at that.
Nice job, Eric.
Man, he must have been in a big hurry for lunches.
I mean, for doing that work.
Okay.
So I don't even need to print the other one out.
Do you care about the other way?
I just gave the result.
Yeah.
Hey, we got over 1,000.
Hey, how old was it?
We got over 1,100.
Okay, there is now we can do the other one.
Who is today's most overrated celebrity today?
I'm trying desperately to get this back on air and I want to, why is this not going back?
Oh, there it is.
Well, I'd scare the crap out of me.
Who is today's most overrated celebrity today?
Not somebody from 100 years ago.
Not somebody who's a politician.
Celebrity, or at least according to the media.
Now, this is going to be a tough one.
How do I decide who to vote for?
Oh, good question.
Huh?
I said, that's a good question.
I'm going to vote for, say, I'm not going to vote for Tom Cruise because he at least did make some good movies.
Yeah.
On time ago, huh?
He's a good actor.
That's the...
At times.
Hey, Tommy.
Too far away.
But nevertheless, he's annoying and full of crap and hyperventilating.
Donald Trump.
I'm going to say Peris Hilton.
The argument there.
I mean, well, she's got no talent.
None.
Zero.
Oh, and I'm going to give you another one, too.
And along the same vein.
Of course, you're going to have to add these honors.
Now, I don't have to write these out.
Thank God.
Okay.
That's up to you.
Victoria Gotti.
Oh, yeah.
I mean, who are we, Kidden?
I mean, the pain in the ass kids...
I think I'm going to vote for her.
Actually.
Yeah, Victoria Gotti.
The fact that A&E puts that on here.
It's just nauseating.
So, wonder they put those infomercials on for Kevin Chudo, you know?
I'm with you, though, like, why A&E?
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
Why?
I mean, there's so many great shows that such a freaking good network.
That's what everybody wants to know.
Why?
You put the Victoria Gotti on there, growing up Gotti on your...
prestigious network.
It makes no sense to me.
Just...
I just don't get it.
We'd be like putting Larry King's show on CNN.
Oh, by the way, you know he's gone on tonight?
Because he's out of the promos.
Remembering Rick Nelson.
Now, you don't remember Rick Nelson because you're not old enough.
Right?
You remember Rick Nelson?
I don't.
You know who he is?
Was?
I don't think so.
Really?
Really?
Oh!
Could I...?
I got to dig into my music now.
I bet you I got some here somewhere.
I don't know where the hell it is.
Huh?
It's doing a break, maybe I'll find it.
Okay.
You're on lucky.
Ozzy and Harriet, before you were born, there was a very boring show on TV.
Ozzy and Harriet, and they had two sons, Ricky and David.
And Ricky became a pop singer, a big star, a superstar.
And they had had an airplane crash.
Toward the ass end, the way his career was basically over.
And everybody had had an airplane crash.
And they were doing a little blow on the plane crash.
And it blowed up for something like that, playing the crash.
He's dead.
His brother, David, on the other hand, went into the lake behind the camera.
Or something.
He's still alive.
Ozzy and Harriet, though, were very boring and very bland.
They're dead.
Okay, is that kind of for you in?
Yeah, I'm...
Well, no, Rick Nelson was a big pop star.
He was like traveling man and...
What's some of the other...
Sure, I've heard a little something.
Bebop baby, all the other margillon.
He did on walk in which pissed me off because I love fat stamina.
So really frosted my ass.
But I liked Rick Nelson alive.
That should take you something.
He was kind of a pretty boy.
Yeah, I wonder if David Cassidy maybe.
Hey David!
You're fairy.
Well, the one good thing is that I say good thing not to make a difference.
But Rick Nelson at least was straight.
In fact, he was married to Tom Harmon's daughter.
Oh, Tom Harmon.
I'm great at football player.
Tom Harmon, you have no idea who that is.
You know Tom Harmon from Donnie Harmon, the harness driver.
You know, Tom Ratman.
Well, Mark Harmon, you've got to know who Mark Harmon is.
Do I?
Huh?
You don't know who Mark Harmon is.
He's the actor he played Ted Bundy in the Bundy movie.
He's still around.
I'm going to prove anybody besides Hillary Duff and Duff Lindsay.
Come on.
You don't know Mark Harmon.
He was Tom Harmon's son.
Well, anyway, Tom Harmon's daughter, who was a real hot number by the way,
she was married to Rick Nelson once upon a time.
And then they had those two twin sons, the Nelson's, whatever the hell they're name.
But the long hair, the long blonde hair looked really gay.
Yeah, never less.
Okay.
So that's on tonight.
Maybe you want to watch Hillary King instead of going to...
Oh, by the way, I know Mark Harmon.
I just googled him.
I just, you know, I don't know him by name.
Well, why not?
He's not really on my mind.
Mark Harmon and not only was an actor, but before that,
and UCLA actor, he still is.
Yeah, I understand it.
But he was the quarterback he used to UCLA in his youth.
Is that right?
He was a great quarterback at UCLA.
And he also happened to be, when back in that day,
one fine-looking, new young man.
Now, what happened?
I mean, nature, it takes its course.
But he was a big star.
By the way, did I say he was still acting?
He hasn't done anything since OFO.
OFO?
OFO.
Yeah.
But that's all right.
But he's still around.
You'll see him once in a while.
You'll see some of those other movies he was in.
He can be seen.
Somebody QAM, hello.
Yeah, Neil, how about Tom Arnold?
There's an excellent choice.
Although, I don't know.
He's not still doing anything.
Is he?
Tom Arnold, is he still around?
Yeah, he does the best stand sports show.
Oh, Tom Arnold put him on there right away.
He's in...
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
Not anymore.
I'm sorry, not anymore.
Oh, what put him on anyway?
Yeah, who cares?
Now, speaking of Tom Arnold, there's some of this...
Oh, and what's the guy that's on that pat...
Oh, geez.
The guy had the drinking product.
He's on that inside edition.
The glass is pat...
Right now!
On inside edition, you know what I'm talking about?
I'm thinking...
You know who it is.
You've seen him.
Right now!
On inside...
He's like a drunk.
Anyway, it'll come to us.
We've got to get him on too.
And, of course, all of the people on those entertainment shows,
anybody that watches them, you need mental help.
Oh, so it's like the Brits, you know, with the Elton and David and David and Elton
and all this other crap.
Why do we care about such nonsense?
Okay.
Who cares?
David Frost.
David Frost, your ass.
What does David Frost have to do with this?
David Frost is a British interviewer.
He, I guess, he's still on the BBC, but where did that come from, David Frost?
Inside edition.
Is David Frost?
Yeah.
No.
Really?
Really.
Okay.
David Frost?
I'm telling you.
That's what IMVB says.
Yeah.
Well, what do they know?
What's that?
Why you laughing?
Because if you knew who their famous David Frost was,
it's most amusing to think that he would be on inside edition.
He would be like saying,
Alistair Cook is on entertainment tonight.
You know?
And by the way, what happened to Alistair Cook's bones?
Did you see that?
No.
They sold his bones.
My tea till noon at QAM.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 516 QAR.
With a quick editorial, here's Pat Robertson.
Hello.
This is Reverend Pat Robertson.
Now, many of you have been criticizing me because I called for the assassination of
Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez.
Now, before you try casting the first stone, let me clarify my statement so you don't label
me some religious deli.
As decent, God-fearing Christians, it's our job to cleanse the earth of all the evil dictators,
even those who pose no imminent threat towards us.
For if we do the right thing by killing people we don't like,
we'll be rewarded when Jesus comes down on a gold-studded chariot giving out those boxes of raisinets
to all the good girls and boys, so they won't have to pay those overinflated concession prices.
The next time they see some crappy Rob Schneider flick, which I don't even know if that piece of crap is that on DVD yet.
Excuse me, Pat.
Yes, stifle yourself.
Okie-dokie then.
This is Pat Robertson and you have a great day.
Well, we know what network he watches now.
He's watching Bob Ciefer with that Okie-dokie crap.
I think it's Pat O'Brien.
Is that the Drunken Grat as one of those inside-edition shows?
He's still in my-
How do I-
How do I-
But he has- I don't think he does inside-edition.
Well, it's one of those shows.
Does it make a difference which show it is?
Well, you said inside it.
Well, maybe it's outside-edition.
I don't know what that one it is.
There's eight minutes of those shows on ET.
Who knows?
But you do know who Pat O'Brien is.
Yes, of course.
Well, that's good.
Who is today's most overrated celebrity?
We got the new pull up there.
Hallelujah, baby.
Here's a little something for you to think you're just a teeth-indoo.
There you go.
Rick Nelson remembered.
What makes a self-buddy?
I don't know.
Just the way you look, I guess.
And to bring this for you is I have no Rick Nelson music here.
I better go out and buy some today.
That's good news for me.
You don't want to hear it.
And the audience doesn't either.
It's not good.
Now, he was- he was okay.
You'd recognize some of the music.
I'm trying to think traveling, man.
That was the most- his most-
Well, do- do a Google on it.
Google Rick Nelson.
Lonesome town.
Kind of morbid and depressing.
And then he did Garden Party.
Don't you remember Garden Party?
And his big comeback?
Of course not.
See, this is great the fact I'm doing a show with Josh and we got no intermediate.

Sick and unforgettable.
All time favorites for Toronto.

The first video, the first music video.
Your plan right there.
That was the first ever.
Traveling man.
With Ozzy here.
Ozzy Nelson invented it.

Don't know my story.
A man who's a war with the universe will be along it too.
We got crudest for the man dog at 4 and then the hurricane stuff.
Jesse Agler after Hurricane Vanceyball took about 2 in a morning.
And you tell me he's really damn good.
He's good, yeah.
So if you were agonizing with Lenny Martez last night,

It'll make you like a couple extra candles.
WQAM, hello.
QAM.
Yeah, Neil.
Yes sir.
The name of the show is the insider.
Bobado Bryan is on CBS.
OK, thanks, Pali.
You're welcome sir.
I was close.
I had at least one word right there.
The Hollywood insider or some stupid.
There's like 45 of those damn shows on now.
It's pure edition, recent edition, inside, whatever.
Hey, well, I said CBS.
So what does that mean?
He's on CBS.

What does that mean?
The young and the hornies on CBS.
Bob Barker is on CBS.
Well, what does that have to do with what network he's on?
At least we got to show the, I think it's the Hollywood insider.
Right now.
You know who he is.
Of course I do.
He's a new drunk.
He's a cheap drunk.
He's a piece of crap.
He used to do NFL work today.
Exactly.
And what I just said before I said he used to be a sports nerd guy.
And I'll say another one who does, who still does the games
because they're very sure I'm played by play.
Oh, he's not bad.
And does one of those shows is Don Cricky.
What?
He's all right.
I didn't say he was great.
I said he's about 100 years old, first of all.
But he still does NFL play by play.
And he also does one of those entertainment, those glitz shows.
I don't know.
I think it's outside, underside edition.
Yeah, that's it.
Yeah.
W-D-Q-I-M. Hello.
Hi, I'm Gideon.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, that was Fatal Brian.
Yeah.

Yeah, all of these in my bucket's got a hole in it.
I said something else.
That was one of his big songs.
My bucket's got a hole in it.
I'll be damned.
I would have sworn he said something else.
Okay.
Now, see how you would get all panicky because you don't know the song.
No, I don't.
My bucket's got a hole in it.
Well, I'd play it for you.
In fact, maybe if you can, where did you find the other one?
Is that true?
I'd Google them and I went to, right when he comes up, you'll see his greatest hit CD,
and I just clicked it and I started playing.
It started playing.
Well, how about my bucket's got a hole in it.
It's a little more upbeat than traveling, man.
Is it on here?
Man, that wasn't that big of a hit.
It was a hit, but not like a major gigantic hit.
I'm sorry, you wanted me to go back to that site?
Yeah, go ahead and see if we can play like about five notes.
We can name that tune in five notes.
That's my bucket's got a hole in it.
Dominic, QA& Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hi, I'm calling from Winter Haven and we couldn't catch you yesterday.

Yeah, but I don't think so.
Yeah.
He said a bad word.
Uh-huh.
He talked to him.
No, thanks.
560, 560, could be in so Jewish, please.
Palm 560, and he verized in singular way.
I hope you're a menorah.

Dominic, QA& Hello.
QA&.
That outline sounds really good.
Really nice and quiet.
Dominic, QA& Hello.
We're on a roll now.
Did you find my bucket's got a hole in it?
No, because you really have no choice of what you're hearing here.
Oh, in other words, you just click and it pops up anything, comes on.
Would you want back to the travel and man?
Kind of like our calls.
WQA& Hello.

Nobody knows from Ricky Martin no more.

Yeah, right.
He's living La Vida, Polka.
5, 6, 7, we got that.
I don't know if I can play any of that stuff.
What was that one called?
Because most of it's got a lot of sexual innuendo in there.
Like, you can fare it.
Living La Vida, Polka.
Is that what it's called?
There's a living La Vida, Gary Confit.
Who's Gary Confit?
I think that's supposed to be Gary Confit.
Are you actually looking at it?

He's a ponderous man, he's just pathetic
Okay, here's a couple of facts, is one is Jennifer Aniston, I mean Aniston

First of all, if you got a problem with Happy Gilmore, I mean he just got no sense of humor
I gotta tell you, that's the one with Bob Barker
You didn't like that, did you see it?

Put him on there. Come to Q-A-M. Hello. Hello, Neil. Oh, and speak to that. I'm sorry,
hung up on that car. Speaking of that, yeah. Oh, remember how I said before vacation that ABC
news has reached new depths to the religious channel now? They had a segment because like a 330
in the morning over there were in a wee hours in the morning. One, the BBC shows CBS,
anything news and Sky News shows ABC evening. Well, one will be other. So they got the ABC evening
news and I can't sleep. I'm lying there and I'm watching. I'm watching. The last segment is about
Christian wrestling. I'm sorry. Have you heard of this? I have not. This is the truth. Christian
wrestling. I mean, they have their own music that goes along with it and they got the whole deal
and they're all sitting around saying prayers before the wrestling match. Christian wrestling.
And then they go out there and you know, they put on this big act like they're beating the crap
out of each other. It's just, I mean, pretty soon there's going to be like Christian
vowel movements. What is it going to be next? You got to create Christian music. You got Christian
yellow pages and now we have Christian wrestling. Oh, yeah, it's actually the CWF Christian wrestling
federal. I told you. And leave it to ABC to do a segment on Christian wrestling. You people
ABC newsman did I think Disney Mickey Mouse is somebody's spiked his punch. Something is really
wrong over there. Here every single night. It's there's some Getz-Goo thing on there. WQAM. Hello.
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I'd like to know that we carried on the great Irish tradition of having
a Christmas dinner followed by a huge family fight of cursing and pushing in front of the kids
and everything. So I just want to and I want to add for the poll. Yes. A Harry Reesiner.
Oh, God. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 16. I see you don't even know who that was. Yeah, you're right. Now,
Harry Reesiner was one of the, in fact, he used to be on 60 minutes when he was alive. He was one
of the anchors on the ABC evening news about a hundred years ago. Harry Reesiner then he was on
CBS and he was on 60 minutes and then he died. Has a way going around. He died.
Can you correct you in the news on CBS? That would be the ultimate blow to anybody with an IQ
larger than their thumbnail. Okay, that would be like a real slap in the face. Speaking of people with
low IQs, I see Fatboy didn't give me any new copy. Did he? As I predicted, huh? Royal, you knew
that was going to happen. Maybe tomorrow. What do you think? Maybe. See if something looked
forward to. I got a good Reesiner rollout of it in the morning, nice and early. See that new piece
of copy come sliding right off one of my two beautiful facts machines here. And you'd be pleased
to know it's a good machine. From it has passed noon at five sixty WQA and you're soon to be
out of business station, but we got some real service here, man. We got, we are in the middle of

you Paul. Okay, I've got Steve. Is this celebrity today? Click, click, Al Goldstein, click,
that's very sad, talk about kicking the guy when he's down, Al is hardly a celebrity anymore,
he's a former celebrity. Well, what was that all about? What is the point in that? What's the
purpose just to get a little shot in there? You know, just to take a shot from somebody, hey,
I know what you're saying. That's the holiday season. I'm a fat Jew. Yeah, that's all. Oh,
speaking of fat Jews, yes, Troy came in and said that he's going to have balance, he's trying to
get balance for life back on with us next week, and he's going to put the beast back on that diet,
maybe have him lose some weight for his wedding. You're looking for glory holes.
What would you do if I just stopped talking now? What would I do? What would you do?
If I just set back in the chair and just laid out, I'd be like, I just go home, I guess,
I'd play something and just go home. Yeah, you know, let Duff come run the back home,
I guess he's probably left the building already, hasn't he? He's on vacation. Well, it's lunchtime,
isn't that kind of ironic though? I mean, Duff is on vacation this week and clearance is on
vacation and Greg is either on the way out or we just don't know for sure. We've got to be here,
because time sheets were due today in his office. Yeah, I mean, I told him that the
old, I mean, the clearance is there. I haven't seen them, but I threw my time sheet under
a story. He better be here. I thought he's on vacation all this week. Well, then why would you
really think you're going to get paid like on the 10th? You really believe that on January 10th?
Is it going to be a paycheck for you? I need to get that, I don't want to get that idea.

No.
I'm fighting to like it.
You're gonna keep it under fire?
I'm gonna keep it.
Because it's a nice look.
You know what?
It's a nice conversation, please.
Okay, cool.
Thank you.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 5.60 Q.A.
My name is Earl.
Comes a new comedy about a man who's cleansing his karma.
One mistake at a time.
It's my name is George.
Attention, threats.
Sorry about Thor.
Cross-Avenopoulos.
My name is George.
He's quitting his past in the past.
Hey, Paul.
Uh, Neoromus.
Uh, my bad.
My bad.
The biggest mistake of all would be to miss.
My name is George.
Somebody get me Harriet Myers on the phone.
Drop 31.
Uh, Ray Romano.
There's one for the pool.
Okay.
And who's the guy that plays Joey?
Uh,
You know what I'm talking about, Joey.
Yeah, for instance.
About the Joey Show.
Mad LaBlanc.
Mad LaBlanc.
There's two of them.
They ought to be right near the top.
They ought to pass Paris open like she's laying out prone.
Mad LaBlanc and, uh, Ray, uh, whatever her name is.
What's her name?
Romano.
Ray Romano.
There you go.
Uh, now we got a new hobby.
Now we not only have planes with emergency landings,
we now also have people dropping kids from burning buildings.
Remember that one a couple of weeks ago?
Maybe it was while I was invocation.
When I kept the show and it over and over.
The baby being thrown out of the burning building?
Yeah, good times.
Well, guess what?
A lot of times we put an extra rule on there she did.
A mother and father who were caught in a burning apartment building
dropped their two children in the arms of an LA County Sheriff's Deputy early in the day.
No one was seriously injured.
Thanks God.
Deputy Jeff Kim and a colleague were flagged down by the Watts neighborhood
at 250 in the A&M by a truck driver
who saw flames coming from the building said Sergeant Ed Lovano, whatever his name is.
Kim first caught a one year old girl who was dropped by the mother from a second four-winner.
We could make this into an Olympic sport.
Baby dropping.
And Michael Jackson could like participate.
Then the children's father appeared and he dropped a nine year old boy right out the window.
Kim suffered smoke inhalation and apparent mouth injury from falling down another way of the older child.
He was at the right time to right place and all that said Lovano was at the scene.
The kids and parents appeared to be un-interested.
They said that the mother also jumped from the second floor.
Well, second floor is no big deal, is it?
No.
You know, they're going to have to do a lot better than that.
I'll tell you another guy that just leaves me limp.
He was the host on the one where we did Hollywood squares.
The one with whoopi goldberg on it.
And now he's on this one of these funniest video shows.
In fact, the guy from the first funniest video show, but he's not on anymore.
He was really annoying.
Well, the first America's funny was Bob Sagitt.
Bob Sagitt, my faggot.
Oh, God, why hate him.
But he's not around the world.
No.
But this guy's name is Tom Sumpen.
You know what I'm talking about?
No, but I can...
I think I do.
America's funny is video.
Just Google it and I'm sure his name will pop up.
Tom Sumpen, whether he tries so hard to be funny and he's joe.
He's just so lame.
He's so bad.
He's weak.
You'll find it, believe me.
You'll know it'll hit you like a lightning bolt.
56670560, pound 560 in the Verizon Singular Rottos Lines.
WQAM, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I have one for your poll.
Yes.
Well, actually, Jim Carey and Barbara Streisand.
I mean, I guess she's still around.
We see her all the time.
She's a...
Can't get away from that nose.
Jim Carey, do we want to put Jim Carey on there?
I mean, I'm tired of him, but I wouldn't say he's made some good movies, right?
Yeah, absolutely.
He's on the same league with these other people.
Barbara Streisand, I mean, the nose nose.
Okay, put her on here.
One out of two for this guy.
Okay.
Make him feel good.
By the way, that's Tom Bergeron.
That's it.
Tom Bergeron.
I do know you mean, though.
He's so annoying.
Good.
God, is he just obnoxious?
Put his ass on this pool.
Tom Bergeron, my ass.
Sounds like a French hockey player.
Man, what a jerk.
I don't understand what people are thinking about.
You know, they put stuff on the air and like I said yesterday, Richard Quest.
How could...
Now, he's not a celebrity, but I mean, how could he be on the air anywhere?
Forget about England.
How could he then put him on the air in the USA?
Richard Quest with his huge donkey teeth.
And then over-affected British...
Oh, man.
Just obnoxious.
You know who that is, though, right?
Not really.
Good.
Don't even look it up.
You don't want to know.
It'll ruin your whole week.
Don't worry.
Actually, when you find out that you're a...
You're a pacelip, you're a thing, and it isn't your time sheet.
No, pretty sure it's here.
I saw his door open.
I mean, I saw the door was open.
I peaked out during the break.
I didn't say that.
And, Claris might be in the building.
How do you like that?
Better get on there, mind our peas and queues now.
You better watch it when you're dealing with a guy who drives a Jaguar.
You know what Jag Rhymes would, don't you?
What's that?
567-0560, pound-560, and they've arrived in Singapore.
Fireless lines.
WQAM, hello.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Hey, I have one for the poll.
Okay.
How about Big Chin, Jay Leno?
He knows V8.
He is bad, man.
He's weak.
Weak.
Very weak.
And...
Go ahead.
I was going to request...
Could I request the Johnny Cash song with Howard Dean, Jimmington?
You got it.
Thanks.
See you, Pally.
Hi, I've been everywhere.
Is that Johnny Cash song or is it like somebody else don't know?
I think that's Johnny Cash.
Is that Johnny Cash?
Call him up and ask him.
Hey, Johnny, was that you?
I'll walk the line.
Let's see.
It's called, I've been everywhere.
It's something that goes like...
I've been everywhere.
That's Johnny Cash.
I've been everywhere.
It's a speck of light that had my fear, man.
I've been everywhere.
I've been to read those cargo's cargo.
Minnesota Buffalo Toronto, West Los Angeles.
So, the winter, don't know, don't know.
I'm home from the Tampa Paddle, Nevada, a lot of them.
We're going to South Carolina.
And up for Homa.
And Arizona.
I know it's Dakota.
And you're going to go.
And Texas, and New York.
I see it.
Where, man, I've been everywhere.
We're going to California.
And New York.
We're going to South Carolina.
And Oregon.
And I'm going to New York.
And I see it, man.
I've been everywhere.
I'm going to Dakota.
I do Mexico.
It's a bolster.
I'll stay with you.
And Oregon.
We're going to California.
And Texas.
And the main dollar goes to Blirro.
Black Rock, a little rock off.
We're going to South Carolina.
And Michigan.
And the state of the league.
And the state of the league is going to be in a great way.
I see it.
I see it everywhere.
I see it everywhere.
I feel it everywhere.
And then we're going to Washington.
You can take back the winner's house.
Yeah, all right.
Prop 37, 231, and QIM, 232 votes.
Here's the double digit contender so far.
Who is today's most overrated celebrity?
Okay.
If I can get my mouse to, uh,
I wonder if I get a wireless mouse.
Does that make sense?
Or at least a new one?
No, I have a new one.
It's still looking work.
Huh?
And it still doesn't work?
No, no, no, no, it's not okay.
It's a question of the cord, okay?
The cord gets in the way and you have to keep pushing it, but you know what I'm talking
about.
Maybe you don't.
I do, but I mean, you know, it's a good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good
to get some cordless mouse.
Okay, do that.
Who is today's most overrated celebrity?
Paris Hilton, she's off all by herself in a leak of her own.
She's got 84.
84.
Nobody else has even got 20 yet and she's got 84.
Paris we hate you like poison and by the way, nice beak, bitch.
85, even as I spoke, she got another vote.
Probably clearance.
Dr. Phil 19, Howard Spurm 14, although they're all rushing out there to buy their serious
radio.
Donald Trump 11, Kevin Peterline 10, Tommy Cruz 10, Oprah's got 10, and Jessica Simpson 10,
Kennis, Moss Macho, Oprah or Tommy Cruz.
Think about it during a break.
So parents come in here yet and give you like a low five.
No, not a word yet.
Really?
He's probably examining that time.
She probably saw a lot of those vocals hours you put out of those hockey games.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 5.60 Q.A.
Hey, Mackinac, this is Joe Bowen, the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening
to the hockey authority, Neil God.
And God said to you, better make your mind a real quick, mad lover wants to choke her.
She fed up with our world girl and her name is sick.
Katie Curry, so will she leave and make me, once she take her mad and jail.
But frankly, I don't care.
And we say amen to that.
If you go into the other room now during the next break or whatever you get the chance,
you'll see that I just fixed my talent sheet for the month of December.
Okay, did you want me to handle that for you?
Yeah, well, I don't think it's going to handle by itself.
It's not going to slide off of the thing and I'll slide onto the door.
No, well, no, that'll give you an excuse to go into the room again.
And that's Steve, he's really there or it's just the door open.
Yeah, that's what I'm going to say.
Oh, Neil, why don't you rush this right in here?
Even though it's only the 27th of December, but I'm probably confident I'll be here the next two days.
And if not, I'll still get paid for it anyway.
Who cares?
Go five, six, seven, huh?
Good point.
Yeah, don't get a good excuse to go in here and say, oh, by the way,
I hope you got my time sheet clearance and happy holidays and the nice, nice jaguar, nice ride.
Five, six, seven, oh, five, six, eight, pound, five, six, and leave a rise in singular wireless lines.
I've heard you're clearance knows some crap, but he's not telling.
See that?
As you know, having been there long enough not to figure it out,
there are a lot of people that know some crap that's going on, but they lie a lot.
Oh, I have no idea and I haven't talked to Greg and we have no idea, you know, and a lie, of course,
because they're always sworn to, just like you had to leave the room this morning for that rather, you know,
I mean, that kind of pathetic announcement from Duff, but you had to leave the room.
Right.
And it's always though the way it goes, like everything is always top secret and then,
what I've discovered is that it's supposed to be top secret, don't tell anybody.
In the next day, it's in Barry Jackass's column in the Herald.
That's what it does.
Yeah, that's always the best.
And that's the way we program and operate the radio station.
Barry Jackass, he's still got the pipeline.
And it's right in the fact that somebody told me, oh, I don't talk to Barry anymore since he's got his head up 790s,
but, uh, the audio, the audio, the audio, but nevertheless, some people they just can't stop.
You know what's called neurotic repetition.
WQAM, hello.
Yes, just no Roger Shelf.
Sounds like me, yes.
On a whim, talking to Neil.
Yes, you are.
Ben, that's it.
Wow.
I picked up Paul on his show, man.
Hey, man, I got a good, uh, overrated celebrity for you.
Okay.
How about Regis Sullivan?
Poor Regis.
Yeah, I think they're trying to push him out.
You know, he doesn't want to be scared of trying to push him out.
He just turned 98.
98?
I thought he was older than that.
110.
Okay, thanks a lot.
There you go.
I have a hair.
You know, Regis says about that morning show.
Who does it that's on there now that the jurist thinks it's so hot and she's really very marginal?
Kelly Ripa?
Kelly Ripa.
It's big, Neil.
It's big and important.
They want you out, Regis.
You know, she's not bad looking.
I mean, she's got a bad nose.
Oh, she's not like George.
Now you sound like George.
Now you sound like George.
No, no, George is the one that's always defending her.
He thinks she's hot.
I think she's very marginal at best, at best.
But then again, George is the expert on all of these things.
And you'll find out on Friday, you can just, you know, talk about Kelly Ripa for four hours.
He's obsessed.
Five, six, seven.
Maybe he likes those skinny kind of like pointing noses, you know?
Maybe if I can be George even likes Peris Hilton, but I doubt it.
Nobody else does.
He got almost a hundred votes already.
How do you like that?
I do it.
93 and 96.
It just went zoom in up there in the middle of my sentence.
And Dr. Phyllis got only 22 and he's second place.
They hate you, period.
And of course, like she cares, right?
Yeah.
She's got more money than God.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
Hello, yeah.
Can you help me?
Speaking.
Yeah, how are you, man?
Pretty good.
I'm coming out of my coma.
I'm okay.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
Listen, I have a couple of celebrities.
They'll probably be a jar of some of your memories.
Gilbert.
Yeah.
The bird.
Yeah.
And then the salad, man.
Remember the salad, man.
Wow.
He's talking about Marcelo, the salad man.
He used to bring us the salad, my fellow.
That's great.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's your Fitz right in there, okay?
Fitz right in.
But at least to keep this guy off the street.
You can't come out of trouble.
You never know.
You get shot walking on the street, especially in downtown Toronto.
Let me say it again.
Bad mix.
Dark skin, punks with guns.
A bad, bad mix.
I'm just telling you that right now.
It's not a racial thing.
It's just a matter of fact, okay?
It's not debatable.
It's a bad mix.
And yet one other ingredient of that mix.
And it makes it an even more explosive combustible mix.
And that's called throogs, okay?
Now that's going on right in your hood?
In downtown.
Okay.
Right smack in the middle of downtown.
Like about a block away from the Eden Center,
which is the big shopping center downtown.
Mm-hmm.
Right on Boxing Day, which is about the biggest shopping day of the year.
When the city is just packed with people.
And yesterday, all these fire trucks and ambulances and police cars and, uh,
whatever the hell they were, headless horsemen all over the place.
Just amazing.
And this used to be a really civilized place once upon a time.
Your line nine is bringing it again.
Q-A-M, hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hey, Neil, you got that bitch get up, Anderson.
Hello.
Hello.
We're in my bucket garden.
We're in my bucket garden.
Oh, right.
That wasn't working else in though.
No, that was somebody else doing the song.
That's not working else.
And I know that song will leave me.
I know my Rick Nelson man, Gardener.
And that's yours.
I wasn't it.
That was a bad cover job by somebody.
5670560.
I'm guessing that I have to go out and buy some Rick Nelson music.
I think you'll have to.
I'll have to go down to Santa Record Man.
That's where the student was writing that hood.
I have to go to Santa Record Man, which is a sad old store.
And how they're still in business.
I have no idea.
But nevertheless, they don't have Rick Nelson.
But I want you to go back.
Huh?
But I want you back.
Yeah, I'm going to watch my back.
Maybe they'll have all the Rick Nelson greatest hits.
And I can play that all day tomorrow.
What do you say?
As an attribute to it must be the anniversary of his playing crash
or something.
Because otherwise, why would Larry King have that show on tonight?
I don't know.
I mean, why wouldn't you just have Joan Rivers on again to talk about suicide?
Company QAM, hello.
All right.
I have one for your poll and your list there.
Okay.
I don't know if he's great, but Mama Mama.
He's not a celebrity, but he's a jackass.
Who is he?
Mo.
Yeah.
Get out of here.
Now, see what I mean about these people?
You're so narrow, man.
Who did Mo for this poll?
This last color or anybody else with an IQ larger than their thumbnail, huh?
Pathetic.
All they want to do is let's just have a poll the first hour every day.
Who do you hate more?
George Bush, Mo Howard David Elroyo.
Who's the other one?
Or Rush Limbaugh, right?
Right.
Every day, get it out of your system, man.
Get out like having a gigantic heaving bowel movement.
Just get it out of your system.
Neurotic repetition over and over.
It's like a parakeet.
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.
I like it.
Oh, by the way, somebody needs to shove a sock into these pothans, Mo.
I watched some of that Panther Philly game last night.
I don't know how long they straight is going to put up with it.
See, Rimmer put up with it because he always bitches to me about it to these pothans.
And always did every call.
Hate that dumb frog.
Hate him.
Hate him, you know.
But just shut him up already.
You people in the Panther organization, your team is starting to finally play pretty good.
You're starting to win a few games.
You've got to point out of that game last night, which could have easily been two.
But no, they got that dumb frog in there.
And for some reason, I guess because he used to wear a jock strap and played for the islanders
when they won't understand the cups.
Therefore, automatically, he's a legend.
He's a sober star.
Guess what?
He's a dumb frog in a horrendous excuse for a broadcaster and got a big mouth and never shuts up.
Bap, bap, bap.
And guess what, then he's nobody in the US or in South Florida gives a crap about the stupid Olympic hockey team.
And then quite frankly, I don't either.
US, Canadian or any other one, A.
Another stupid act by Gary Bentman.
Right in the middle, they finally, after missing a season, they finally start building a little mo-
momentum up.
And what do we do?
Let's take the two-week break again for a tour end again for the Olympic.
So that's an act of pure stupidity that only a schmuck like Gary Bentman would come up with.
Moron.
And he's saying, Moron, that's what I said.
Moron.
Well, then, see, then, I got stuck in that hockey talk.
That was bad.
How the hell did that happen?
It must be why all those calls.
M-O-R-O-M.
See, there you go.
Moron.
He knows how to spell it.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
Hey, here's another stinking celebrity for you.
Okay.
Terrible.
Somebody beat you to it.
Ah, you know, I think.
Thanks.
Terrible, she's on there.
You got to read it.
I wonder if she is kind of Greg, would you think?
The nephew called yesterday that was don't forget.
Mentioned a Georgia on Friday.
He'll know the nephew called Chris Reed.
Terrible reads that only one vote.
So, good busy.
Matt LeBlanc has gotten none.
Oh, yeah, he's gotten none.
Look at all the people with no votes.
Matt LeBlanc and Nicole Smith.
Lindsay Lohan, Simon Cowell, Jennifer Ayniston.
I'm a seeded in the belong matter.
Paul Azon, Hillary Duff and Dakota Fanning.
All have got the big, oh, so far out of 280.
And Perice Hilton just keeps widening that lead.
She is down the road like this like secretariat.
And a face to match.
WQAM, hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
I can think of one talent that Perice Hilton has.
She gives oral to.
Okay, good.
WQAM, hello.
Hey, I know.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
We'd like to put two people on it if you can still find Bill Cosby.
And I didn't agree with this way.
He wanted to find Jesse Jackson.
There's celebrities.
Bill Cosby had all he's, he's just a political agitated now Bill Cosby.
And hasn't done anything in what?
Since the Jesus was a baby.
And Jesse Jackson's a celebrity.
No, sorry.
So, I think it's a racial thing.
No, too.
Just trying to pick on some life.
Yeah, I do.
Bad.
560, 705, 60, pound, 560 on the Verizon Singular wireless lines.
Don't be picking on them dark folks, okay.
Unless they have a gun.
WQAM, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you?
Great.
The guy from Survivor Gets, close.
I mean, you know, the only thing the guy says is that Triathlette spoke in, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
All right, thanks.
Thanks.
What's your guys name, Jeff?
I don't know.
I've never seen Survivor in my life before.
You haven't seen Survivor?
I don't really like.
Oh my God.
Coming to October, Survivor 3, Africa.
Watch if a whole new cast of characters, Viper, the title of Survivor.
Don't face their most challenging obstacles yet.
Like walking through Ethiopia, wouldn't stand with strife to their back.
And find out if your favorite mate for TV tribesmen can win immunity by putting two bolts
that are placed in their mouth and blending in with those real tribe.
Kenya is a setting this fall for Survivor 3.
And for our friends in Africa, coming this fall to CBS, it's Survivor 3, Texas style.
Ten contestants will start in Dallas, travel through Waco, Austin, San Antonio and over to Houston.
Then they'll travel that across Christy and Brown'sville.
Each contestant will be driving a pink bullbow with a bumper sticker that reads,
I'm gay, I voted for Al Gore and I'm here to confiscate your guns.
The first one to make it back to Dallas wins of Viper 3.
This fall on CBS.
We only got about 800 of those.
No, I never saw it either.
Yeah, like San O's Survivor.
One second.
I didn't know no Godfather and I never saw no survivor.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
It's the Mohawi-David and Wormup show.
How about those Patriots, baby?
The final score was no indication the game was a total blowout.
It was 31-21.
It could have been 131 to zip.
Total blowout.
Yeah.
Right there in New York, no less or in Jersey.
Close enough.
Right.
There's the jets once again.
We know what the S stands for in jets.
J-E-T-J.
How is it S?
Suck.
They really do.
They are pathetic.
You know how quiet the jets fans are.
The season man, they're not making a peep.
Not a little bow peep from the jets fans.
All them loud, obnoxious, New York type.
Well, what's the peep?
Here's your line, line nine.
Q-A-M, hello.
Yeah.
Carson Daly.
Oh, jeez.
Is he still around somewhere?
I think he does quite a lot of...
I should like to find him.
I think he's taken over for Dick Clark now.
Really?
Yeah, change.
Like every second if he followed in this footsteps
and had two massive strokes.
Wouldn't that be bad?
Okay, thanks.
It's a good choice, man.
I despise him like that.
He thinks so much of himself.
He thinks he's the greatest God's gift to the human race.
Yeah, he does like another late talk show.
How sad.
Carson Daly, man.
Maybe he can catch your appearance.
Maybe they can look together.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.
I'm actually finally coming out of that fog.
Now that I am, I realize that to that extra hour sleep is not good.
Not good.
You're groggy, man.
Groggy.
That's right.
If the jump out of bed in the morning and go again,
and I also not having that bacon was not a good idea.
I just didn't feel it was probably, I mean,
oh, you can't even begin to imagine the thrones of people
shopping downtown yesterday here.
You can't imagine it.
Why?
Why does it go on down here during Christmas?
And then all of a sudden, there is no downtown there,
though there is like in shopping malls.
Although we're here meeting the center is downtown,
but all these people are on the streets and then all the shootings going in between.
So not a good day to go like picking up your bacon.
Sounds like Miami to me.
Yeah, I felt like I was kind of at home.
12.57 a.k.a.
This is Neil Rogers.
Oh, boy.
This is 5.60.
Q.A.M.
Oh, boy.
It's the one to two hour.
Since the view of the awareness campaign, this is take nine.
Okay, wait.
Wait.
Wait, that's your cue.
Oh, right.
Anytime you're ready.
We're ready to wait.
Oh.
This is Dwayne's dump of Black tooth, telling you.
If you do drugs this weekend, don't drive.
Wrong again, Dwayne.
It's don't do drugs.
Don't do drugs.
That's what I said.
Oh, it's not.
I've been close to what you said.
You coming in this booth, I show you how close it was, sheer luck.
We're going to do it again, Dwayne.
Say don't do drugs.
If you must drink this holiday weekend, do not drive.
Take 12.
This is Dwayne's dump.
Weekends are for drugs.
Do drugs.
Okay, Dwayne.
Thank you very much for coming in.
I think with a little editing, we've got something we can use.
Don't do drugs.
And if you must drink this holiday, we can dump drugs.
It's a 1-1-5.60.WQM.
I'm finally awake.
I'm officially awake.
All three hours, it's not bad.
It's only 1.
Now, did you go in there and confirm you had with Clarence or is he not in there?
No, but I found out that the nephew is in the building, I guess.
Yeah.
I don't know what that means.
I just...
I'm who told you that.
I got a spy report.
I thought he wasn't going to come and see Greg.
Is Greg in the building?
That's what he said yesterday.
I don't know.
I haven't been over on that side.
Good idea.
Good thinking.
So, otherwise, Clarence is not in there.
Did he drop off my hat?
That's not in there.
But I gave your talent.
I thought he'd get the duck.
The duck is still there.
I thought the duck was on vacation this week before he...what every day.
He happens to be a busy little bee right now, I guess.
Really?
Well, I'll be damned.
5.6.705.60.
Pound 5.60.
Leave a rise for rights and singular wireless lines.
What a laugh and a joke, man.
A few folks only knew.
If you have any idea.
WQM.
Hello.
Hey, me.
How are you doing, Chief?
Pretty good, Pallie.
Listen, be me a flavor, okay?
Tell your friends over there, Power 96, whatever, that it's not me back.
It's Mawbock, okay?
Yeah.
All right.
If I hear another rap song or they impromptu...
I think I'm gonna stop myself like a million times.
Okay, well, give it a good shot.
It works.
Like we have something to do with Power 96.
We have nothing to do with them, okay?
They don't want anything to do with us because we're a bunch of AM Slabs.
They're on FM.
They got 100,000 Watts Class CFM.
They got all those young pumps listening with guns.
You know what I'm saying?
So, there you go.
Good luck to you.
Like we have nothing to do with them whatsoever.
It's about the only thing I will say is that they offered that pizza that time.
And even after somebody stole their pizza, the Power 96 guys.
Even after some outrageous pizza refeef came along and stole the pizza.
WQAM, hello.
Hey, Neil, I got a name for you, Liz.
Yes.
That play my ass is A.K. and A.K. and Man in the World.
Oh, God.
It's from the A.K. and Man in the World.
That's from the A.K. and Man in the World.
That's from the A.K. and Man in the World.
That's from the A.K. and Man in the World.
That's from the A.K. and Man in the World.
Yeah.
That's from the A.K. and Man in the World.
That's from the A.K. and Man in the World.
That's from the A.K. and Man in the World.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, that was a Tray.
It was just a T.
It was just a T.
Just a T.
Just a little T.
Tray.
You're fair, right?
That's Tray.
We're not Tray's transfer, of course.
So Tray's transfer is back with his old buddy again.
Always going back to the well, okay?
Going back to the well, well, well, well.
It just, I don't know what to say.
I'm just speechless with that outfit back there.
What is going on back there?
I don't know what it is, but it has nothing to do with sales.
How many QAM, hello?
Hey, how are you, sir?
I'm okay, sir, aren't you?
Wonderful.
I was just calling to let you know that I've poofed to my pants.
Okay.
Congratulations.
Okay.
I'd walk around with a sandwich board on Lincoln Road Mall.
Clear the area out in ten minutes.
W.A.K.Y.M. Hello.
Hello, Mr. Neal.
Yes, sir.
Anything.
Go to your back, I was starting to farm local George.
Yeah.
Hey, I'm going to go out with your friend, Tori Schaffer,
and McGatuchee last night.
Yeah.
And person who is speaking programming is not bad.
Yeah.
I love you, Neal.
Okay.
That's the first reference, boyfriends,
so I take back whatever I said about Tori Aikman.
567-0560, pound 56, and they've horizon singular rightless lines.
W.A.K.Y.M. Hello.
Good afternoon, Neal.
And back to you.
Two things.
Overrated celebrity.
I would have to say overwintering.
Uh-huh.
And can you please play the phone call,
it puts the lotion in the basket?
Oh.
You mean that body augmentation, right?
The one that I put the lotion in the basket with the guy called the office.
You mean this one like this?
This is Debbie.
Hello, Debbie.
I'm in the student getting some operations done.
Okay.
And some body contouring and some liposuction.
Uh-huh.
And I was wondering if you had some tummy talk?
To be honest with them, I'm going to really tear that, aren't you?
Yeah, I'm pretty done with it.
And lip augmentation, cosmetic compresses, scissors, facet, all of these things.
Uh-huh.
And those wondering...
More like steroids.
Well, I need to get everything done.
Probably the first thing I'd like to have removed is my thing.
Okay, we don't do that.
No. Could you do breast implants, though?
Uh, I can't be done, but I don't know if they would do right away.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Uh-huh.
How much?
Uh, 5,000.
Excellent.
I'd like to have my skin resurfaced, too.
Uh-huh.
And there's the surgery.
Uh-huh.
Have the lambs stop crying yet, mommy?
Excuse me?
Don't hurt mommy's little baby.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I'd like to get the liposuction that I saw on TV.
Okay.
Can you make me look more like a woman?
Well, we'll have to see you first.
And if I'm looking at you, we can tell you that when we see you.
Should I wear my skin suit made of body parts, mommy?
Uh, if you'd like to.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Or should I make an appointment?
Yes.
Okay.
Um, there is a $100 consultation fee.
That's fine.
Okay.
Okay.
Um, my name is Buffalo Bill.
Okay, let me give you a little information from you.
Okay.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I understand.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Do you want to come in for a consultation
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Okay.
Would you like to make an appointment?
Or do you want to call me back?
You put the lotion in the basket.
I understand.
I got my skin suit in your bottle...
Heh.
Uh, no you don't.
Bill.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I understand.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Ok.
you like to make an appointment? It puts the lotion in the basket. Okay, I will talk to you
in the time, okay? It puts the lotion in the basket. Hello? How it places the lotion in
the basket? Oh, and now you were asking me yesterday about violent movies named One that I liked
there, there's one. Okay, you don't think Silence Alam was a violent movie when like
bit the guys face off? It was, yeah. Yeah, it was. And then last night I was sitting there
watching the hockey games. I wish I would have made notes and written a list and there
must be a hundred different very violent movies than I like a lot. What's the one with California
with Brad Pitt? Okay, where he goes around blowing all the people away. Remember that?
Yeah, it's a great movie. So I don't know what you're talking about. All right, hey, sorry
to jump to conclusion. What was the movie that you were saying I won't watch because there's
violence in it? City of God. Oh, City of God, but I never got to that point. So what would
the violence have to do with it? I never got to any violent. Here's all I'm saying. Never
got to any story. Right, right, right. But here's what I'm saying. Yes, what are you saying?
If you watch this movie and see the story, that's true. You will love the movie. I guarantee
it. Okay. So you know what that reminds me of Apocalypse Now, which is why I finally sent
that very expensive. Well, if you're said, you don't like war movies. No, I mean, there's
some more movies I like. I can't knew it was a war story. Right? I didn't see that. Oh,
yeah. And it's fine. It's just pondering at the beginning of it, man. I just can't get
past it. It's not because of the violence. It's just so slow and so long and depressing.
And I don't think it's great. I think it's okay. I can't get past it. Okay. Sorry. I just can't
take it into it. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60. And they've arrived in Singular Routes
Times. You'd like a movie. That's a movie you actually would watch. And you wouldn't
fall asleep and you'd like it. And it's a very acting is very good. Just keep my attention.
That's all. There you go. W-D-Q-Y-M. Hello. Hey, can I speak to Neil? Speaking.
Neil. Yeah. Hey, I'm so I'm listening to the radio. Hey, I've got a name for your poll.
Okay. How about Lindsey Lohan and that whole Lohan family? She's on there, man.
I agree. I can't believe she's on there with a Gatsomish Pukka as the Chinese say.
Thank you very much. Very, very, very welcome. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. How's she doing? Oh, Lindsey Lohan.
Lindsey Loh Life. Let's take a look at how we're doing. We got 309 vote on the poor. Our
number is 400. Well, this is tomorrow's poll. We started early. See, I know. I got... I think
this is your early idea, yourself. I mean, yeah, I'm getting way ahead of myself because I'm
going to be on there at noon for Christ's sakes. Let's play Eric Ford. He's the one that put the
Bums rush on it. 124 for Paris Hilton, the most overrated celebrity two-day. 124. Keeping in mind,
it's he's almost 100 votes ahead of Dr. Phil who's got 27. And we just hate Dr. Phil. And rightfully,
so what a phony. What a con artist. What a faker. What a Yahoo, man. Oh, I got another good one
for you. What do you got? Speaking of people with phony Southern draws, Nancy Grace. Oh, my God.
And she's on every network. She's even on a freaking comedy channel. She's everywhere.
She's on Hockey Night in Canada. Nancy, freaking Grace, man. She's like glued inside your TV.
And you can't get her out of there. It's like a disease.
Anyway, Dr. Phil 27, Howard Spurm is moving up 20. The Howard Bashar's out there. I don't,
you know, I don't, well, come see Come Saw, whatever. Donald Trump 18, Tom Cruise 14,
Oprah 13, Jessica Simpson 12, Kevin Feverline 11, Sarah Jessica Parker 9. If you look up the
expression, Miyas Kite in the dictionary, you'll see her picture. Martha Stewart 9, that's the
check of the rocket, by the way. Victoria Gotti 8, Jennifer Lopez 8, J. Low. How low can you go,
J. Low? Ashton Kucci, Kucci is got six. Adam Sandler 5. No, I did not see happy Gilmore.
Do it. Oh, now wait, I'm thinking maybe I actually did see happy Gilmore on TV. I mean,
that's the movie with the Bob Barker. No, I know that. I know that. And I have a feeling I did
see it. I have a feeling it may have been very funny and sput to him. But I still can't stand him,
though. Adam Sandler, he just, he's just horrible. He's an evil human being. The Olsen twins 5,
Ben Affleck 5, Ashley Simpson 4, can she sing or what? Katie Kurek 4, Bill Marre 4, Nicole
Richie 3, Bono 3. He's going to save the world from itself. You watch that Bono. Maybe you can
save the world for some more of that bad U2 music. Terry Spelling 3 in Tom Hanks 3 in Melissa
Way Hanks was not really eating donuts yesterday. Was he please tell me no? Okay, he wasn't eating donuts.
He was. Yeah. No comments. You know, you do the best you can. So it's all we can. Any of us can do.
Probably it's after one. Where we're going to get the piano case, though. We use the other one
for fat rich. Where we're going to get the one for the Humper. And then fat boy,
can you believe that yesterday that he was born on Christmas Day? It goes to show it. There's no
God. Anybody out there believes there's a God? Jeff High, fat boy was born on December 25th.
The day they live in infamy. He's here doing it. Nice job. I'd copy by the way, fat boy. You are
doing it. You and a whole lot of sales crew over there. I don't know why I keep dwelling on them,
but boy, they're like to talk about a human cancer. That whole operation back there is like
I can smell it all the way up here. Must be Curtis. What's his name? Curtis Raymond Burr. Yeah,
it and value. Those are the three ingredients that everybody with a half of brain is looking for.

coach strats are true and the commercial name in it. Don't leave it out that's Chick-fil-A by the way.
While I'm wearing stand-expants I'm kind of shrippy. My shoes will be. I had a series of big hits
and that was back in 76 now. No one wants to hear. They only laugh and sneer. They won't
admit. They own my albums. My songs are queer. Got a nose shape like a banana. My two fans both live
in my town. Got a nose shape like a banana. Of my nose you can fit half of the city of Atlanta.
I write the song. I got a nose. I got a heart girl. The size of young girls.
When I get it stuffed up nose I be dressed in your hoes but now on the chase my life is back in place
and so I'm singing again I'm singing. My smiles in your face got a nose shape like a banana.
My two fans both live in my town. Got a nose shape like a banana.
Of my nose you can fit half of the city of Atlanta.
I write the song.
I got a nose. I got a nose. I got a heart girl.
You're fair. I got a nose. I got a heart girl.
I'm sure some kind of curious what they sound like.
Trevor your team was depending on you to shred right to sleep to the namax bro but in the end you geeked out hard.
This is a top one. Trevor your bogus.
Okay tonight on an all-in-no-longer wedge, Nick and Jessica. Nick I hate you. I'm gonna flat my wings like a buffalo and fly out of here.
You'll never leave me Jessica. You're too scared. Are you crying yet, Tina? Stop it! Stop making sense. I know is it.
No longer wits. Nick and Jessica only on MTV to no longer music channel.
No that's been for you. All right this shouldn't hurt a bit. You're gonna feel just a little pinch.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh?
That was the fat butt oxygen.
I never saw that spot.
You had to be there.
What is this?
I want to show one.
Let's see.
And then of course there are ones from the cowboy ones.
Oh, no one on that.
I will survive.
It won't matter how little.
I still want to play live.
I got all my life to live.
I got all my life to give.
And I'll survive.
I will survive.
Or then there's always.
It's raining man.
Halloween is raining man.
It's raining man.
I'm going to out.
I'm going to out.
It's absolutely soaking weary.
It's raining man.
Halloween is...
Or in last and the probably least.
Here it is.
It's fun to stay at the YMCA.
It's fun to stay at the YMCA.
They have everything.
Recon, men who enjoy.
You can hang out with all of them.
Hey.
I guess you're happy to be seeing that movie.
I think that just like you said, I don't want to see movies with a lot of violence.
You don't want to see a movie with a lot of gay stuff in it.
Right.
That's what you're afraid of.
You're afraid you might actually like the movie and have to admit it.
I wouldn't say I'm afraid of it more than I'm just not interested in it.
Oh.
Then guess what?
What's that?
Neither am I.
5670 or 5660.
I mean, it's just, you know, I guess if it comes on TV eventually or somebody sends me a stolen bootleg DVD.
I'll be glad to watch it when I got some time to kill.
Right after I watched City of God.
It was...
5670, 5660, pound, 5660.
Did I dream that I did those first three hours?
Man, that was bad.
No, you even made the comment that I sounded like it was in the bag like in coherent.
You were definitely grudgy.
I groggy.
That's what I was very groggy because I'm still recovering with this time lag thing.
Don't go to Europe unless you go see I never do this.
I made a bad, bad mistake.
In the last several vacations what I've done has come back like on a Saturday.
So I have Sunday off to recuperate and recover and get my body back into sync with the time zone and the radio.
And then go back to work on Monday.
It didn't do that.
Came back Sunday after that traumatic experience with KLM.
Hey, guess what, KLM?
Up yours.
Man, do they know how to board a flight or what?
Got a good take your seats.
Is that the thing I like about KLM?
Is that the one that kept in the seat?
Got a good take your seats.
That's about the only that's to highlight for me.
Because it means either you're going to take off or you're going to be landing.
One or the other.
And the agony will end soon.
That's one of the height zones.
That is it.
WNQA and hello.
Hey, me all the day going.
Pretty good.
I received serious professiveness and it is great.
So I turned it on.
It's only clock all the employees because you're on.
I got a request.
OK.
Johnny Cash, my ass is on fire.
OK, and now you're going to figure out what their let's call cash.
Ring of fire.
No, not ring of fire.
Pass of fire.
It burns.
Good.
That's how I appreciate it.
No, I think it's called acid.
I got it.
I got it, man.
Welcome, Janet.
That's it.
My butt is burning.
My butt has...
Has a big red ring.
Oh, right.
Is water the side?
It goes my ass.
Feels like it's on fire.
Welcome.
It feels like my ass is on fire.
I'll have to get this one of those inflatable tires.
Because it burns, burns, burns.
Like my ass is on fire.
Oh!
One thing that we could do is squirting through the old tube.
Burn it from what you thought was cash.
And the tubes from out of your head.
Tube.
And the tube.
It feels like my ass is on fire.
I'll have to get this one of those inflatable tires.
Because it burns, burns, burns.
Like my ass is on fire.
Absolutely.
My ass is on fire.
It feels like my ass is on fire.
I'll have to get this one of them inflatable tires.
It burns, burns, burns.
Like my ass is on fire.
My ass is on fire.
My ass is on fire.
My ass is on fire.
Oh, oh.
That was just a raspberry by the way.
It was just a raspberry there.
Don't get all done out of here.
I dumped it anyway.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
That was just a little tiny raspberry, man.
Listen, it made me laugh.
Be good with some whipped cream on it.
Yeah, see, that's an audio when people request this stuff
that we haven't played in a long time.
And you have to say, okay, well, what is it called?
Can I find it?
That's number one.
And then number two, can we play it?
That's the big question.
See, I would rather play it and dump it, like we just did.
Oh.
Sorry.
I rather just played it.
Right.
But, I mean, you know, your ass is on the line.
And it's on fire.
You know, it does pop in in here, you know, saying, huh?
I let it go.
Yeah, if you let it go, clearance would have come right in.
And you're playing bush boss.
I'm not going to let you drive my Jaguar this weekend now.
Yeah, once you're asking if you can borrow the Jaguar.
No, how about the Vento?
Troy has always bugging me about the vet.
Now, I'm not the nobody's driving those vets, okay?
Just forget about it.
So, Troy's transferred his back with his buddy Troy again, huh?
I wouldn't be surprised if Troy's trying to sign up pomp and opar 2.
Just, it just amazes me.
And just shocking for the development's vector and sales.
Talk about Stale Rogers, man.
The staleest place in that building is back there in that sales department.
You could smell the crust on the underwear.
Those are the people in the back in sales.
Probably even Berkeley left a little pile behind.
Now, is she something or what?
I'll talk about a walking pile.
She was something.
Bye, bye Berkeley.
Nice job, sweetheart.
That'll teach you to hang out with those wise guys too much.
1,1,1,2,7.
And what a shame, too, they could have brought a really bright end.
A whole bunch of pizza for some guys to steal.
You know what I'm saying?
I'm not interested in pan out.
I'll tell you what does pan out.
That's one of the fine restaurants anywhere in town.
The Emerald Coast Florida's number one Asian gourmet buffet is rated by Ziggat Restaurant Review.
And now every Friday through Sunday night you can enjoy lobster fest at the Emerald Coast featuring delicious main lobster served thermator style.
And every night at the Emerald Coast's crab fest would last in snow crab legs, dungeon this crab, and Jonah Stone crabs.
And the menu still includes fresh oysters on a half-cell and a great half-shell and a sushi bar with over 30.
But turn them in.
The Emerald Coast also serves juicy, delicious New York steaks cooked over to the way you love them and hand-car prime rib too.

This is Neil Rogers. This is 560-Q-A-A-A.
Neil.
Yeah.
From Peter Jackson, director of the Oscar-winning Lord of the Rings trilogy, an epic adventure that will overwhelm your senses.
Being a pawn.
Peter Trevor's a rolling stone calls being pawn.
A back-and-forth adventure that will keep you guessing.
David Anson of Newsweek says, being pawn will fuck up your neck and hearing the rules of eight-it-go news asks, what's the score?
No, seriously, does anyone know the score?
On December 14th.
King.
Home version, oh, that'll look came out like on the video game on Atari 2600.
Okay, so the King Kong really need to be remade.
I asked, did you see that?
Yeah, it was really good.
Was it good?
Yeah.
Did you see the original one with Faye Ray?
I did.
And Link Ray?
I mean, technically the same thing, but it just looks a lot better.
Yeah, well, of course, because now they can do all of these things, you know, that they couldn't do back then.
Oh, it was amazing.
Yeah, I was amazing.
Well, that's good. I'm glad to hear that.
So let's see, after City of God, and then what's the other one I'm going to watch?
Happy Gilmore.
Happy Gilmore.
I already saw that, and it was okay.
In fact, if I actually watched all the way through it, because then I recognized the scene with Bob Barker.
Where I see that, a million times was it the hockey games, the Panther games.
Yeah.
And they still use that?
I don't know.
They still use that corny thing on the scoreboard where they show that scene where Bob Barker comes in his knocks.
Just pushes him right in the head, just by knocks his head off.
I just call it old Bob.
But then he rate, about one in 20 adults in the US is not literate in English, meaning 11 million people like this goes to handle many of them.
Everyday tasks, they federal study be shown.
About one in 20.
I think they're underestimating if he asked me.
From 92 to 2003 adults made no progress in their ability to read sentences and for a graph.
Or understand other printed materials such as bus schedules or prescription labels.
From 92 to 2003, 11 years, no progress, zero as in, oh,
Divinity Dura like our friends across the street with the big O. They got nothing, nada.
I'm just shocked that you told me the nephew was in the building.
That's right.
But then he tells yesterday that he wasn't going to come down and see his uncle.
He wasn't going to be, oh, yeah, he couldn't stay away.
Maybe he's going to be the new GM Chris Reed.
The adult population did make gains in handling tasks that involve maths such as calculating numbers on tax forms or bank statements.
But even in that area, the typical adults showed only enough skills to perform simple daily activities like King Kong, like a chimp, like a smirking chimp.
Perhaps most of the bring was that adult received dropped or was flat across every level of education from people with graduate degrees to those who dropped out of high school.
So even as more people get a formal education, the literacy rate in the U.S. is not rising.
A federal official say this trend is puzzling and worthy of research.
Adults for the ability to perform challenging and complex reading tests made an average yearly salary of 50,700 bucks in 2003.
That's 28,000 more than those who like basic skills.
So aren't you glad that you like graduated high school?
I'm so glad.
Yeah, because you're making like a lot more than that.
No? Yeah.
The adult seemed a little bit English and well, how about that raise?
Did you go into clearance and jump up and down on the desks?
It's almost the first of the year. How's that raise coming up?
How's it coming?
Let's go.
Well, let's go. Let's get the show on the road and quit dallying.
Okay? They blew out rape period. They got some other people there that are like being demoted to janitor.
Let's get the show on the road and start taking care of our people.
The way that they nickel and dime, nickel and dime, they got all these damn tradeouts.
They got Rolex watches and Jaguar and all that.
Living like a bunch of kings, man.
You got a bunch of queens in there. Living like a bunch of kings.
That's what I don't get.
Okay, let me get worked up about it.
Okay, work out.
The adults being illiterate in English include people who may be fluent in Spanish or another language.
But cannot comprehend English level. It's English and text at its most simple level.
How do you like that?
Unless it's when it's convenient for them.
You know people like that who...
I have your ears, your skulls.
They most be getting laced. Unless, of course, you're talking about them.
We're competing at the moment. And then all of a sudden, hey, I heard what you said.
You bestardo.
Bestardo. Or I did better at that time.
Sometimes you get your tongue caught on that, well, one tooth, not good.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
See now I know I'm back out of that fog that I was in before because I'm just rambling.
I just spewing a lot of crap.
Speaking of spewing crap, Mohawi David had two.
Curtis for the Mad Dog at four.
We got Keynes basketball, baby.
The pregame to warm up at seven.
And the Keynes and the Stetson headers at 7.30.
The Stetson headers, that just makes me want to...
Just pee in my pants.
Just the aggro after the basketball game.
WQAM, hello.
Yes, I'm Neil.
Yeah, okay.
What a funny voice.
Yes, it is.
Once you try different, make the New Year's resolution that in the New Year,
it's not going to be such a tip off.
You're not going to have a telegraph it.
To me and the rest of the audience that it's always the same on my misfit.
And his boyfriend.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Tom 5, 60, and he Verizon and Simulator Wireless Lines.
WQAM, hello.
QAM.
QAM.
WQAM, hello.
Hey, this is...
I love you.
I'm just going to stand.
Turn that radio off.
Please.
Pretty please.
Okay, sorry.
Go ahead.
All right.
I'm just...
I've got a comment about the whole English and literacy thing.
And we just sort of cater to it.
Like, we put everything in Spanish.
We're not helping anybody to understand English.
So until we make them, that number's not going to get up.
Uh-huh.
That's all.
Okay.
Happy holidays to you.
All right.
Thanks for joining us.
Thank you.
All right.
All right.
Adios.
We've been here.
Shalom.
Dos Vidaña.
Espaciva.
Oh, sorry.
Toxins.
Do we?
You know, back in the day, and then this went on for years, of course,
the whole bilingual thing, back during the Maria-al-boat lift, and for long afterward.
You know, you have a few women callers we get on this show?
Yeah.
If you want to get, when you start doing your own show, you want to get women callers,
just bring up bilingualism.
They are obsessed.
I mean, obsessed with that topic.
That's all in a-
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, and there she is.
I don't know where.
I mean, just, you know, here we go again with that.
I mean, I just happened to read that story because it was in my pile,
which, you know, I'm not having much of a pile this week,
because I don't want to sit here like, uh, read in lecture,
and, uh, I want to keep it a little on the aferbulous side, you know?
Well, the calls are so great, too.
And I'd like to have been this week phenomenal, man.
Two out of two yesterday, and today, I mean, today has been beyond description.
But, uh, no, seriously, they're just obsessed with this whole thing.
Speaking of this thing, you know, it's just another excuse to hate people, you know?
See, women come off as pretending to be so much more gentile and gentile,
and not as vicious and dangerous as men, and all of a-
Well, maybe from a standpoint of physical strength, that's true.
But the fact of the matter is that when it comes to good old-fashioned hate,
women are right there with men, and maybe even beyond.
Passes like we were standing still, I think.
Speak it in English, speak it in English, okay?
It was the killbins, the killbins.
I wonder if any sheafers croaked it.
Let's check that out.
56670560, pound 560 in the Verizon Singular Rival's line.
Got a long way to go here. We still got 22 minutes.
So, don't catch your calls before we hatch.
How about you, QAM? Hello?
Is QAM changing format?
Yes.
When?
Uh, today.
Okay. Thanks.
Okay, right in your diary, Mike.
What?
I said, have a great, uh, New Year.
You too.
Now, didn't you tell me Waxi's getting sold?
Yeah.
To whom?
To Lincoln blood casting.
Well, who the hell is that?
I have no idea. It was, they announced it.
Well, what?
What's that going to do to $790 then?
Don't know yet.
Oh my God. Well, keep us posted.
And FYF is, uh, also being sold and magic, maybe.
Oh my God. Well, my, my, my, and bye-bye.
Look out now.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
And you're knocking the calls.
Man.
Oh.
George is going to be sorry.
He was on vacation this week.
He's missing the good stuff.
Oh, yeah, he is.
He is missing the best.
Wouldn't that be something if Waxi got sold?
Who the hell is Lincoln blood casting anyway?
Man.
And then what we have, what we have to complain about?
Oh, gee.
What are we going to do about those guys across the street?
They stole Joe Rose.
They didn't steal anybody.
Okay.
Somebody pushed Joe Rose out the door and lied through their teeth to him.
Okay.
Which is why he hates certain people in his building like Poison.
Greg.
Not to mention no names.
But other than that, they're like, you know, they're like, non-existence.
So that would be something poor, Joel.
Fineberg.
What's he going to do then with?
He'll find some other price to waste daddy's money on him.
This is Neil Rogers.
A blue miss is 5.16.
Q.A.
You know what I would say?
With a holiday season upon it, you can't be an eye of this sighting to do step out of
character and spread the legs of Joyce around you.
You come to the peak, there's your cup of pink, there's your sub-bond order now.
My mummy would have owned their lives into my mouth.
Turn the party or it's going out for me again!
What do you want to do?
One's going to get him into bed.
Maybe I will out we buzzed fingers!
Now he has a pussy for a child to trample him whole-day.
But I've been carrying it all the time.
No!
Don't trust me.
It's all new, that lion goats or to your heart,
I don't touch that heart hook.
Don't touch that fish.
Don't touch that fish.
Don't touch that fish.
Don't touch that fish.
Don't touch that fish.
Don't touch that fish.
Don't touch that fish.
Don't touch that fish.
Don't touch that fish.
Don't touch that fish.
Don't touch that fish.
Don't touch that fish.
Don't touch that fish.
Don't touch that fish.
Do, do, do, do.
Do, do, do, do, do, go, go, go!
Don't touch that fish.
Do, do, do, go, go, go!
That's right.
The way to get away.
And back that voice.
Go, do do, do do!
And Necess...
Are you ready?
I can see you there.
One of the fighters on the side of the色is.
Most probably I couldn't know.
to Zipity Duda. Then next week you're going to have to face the music.
Let's start preparing.
405 votes who is today's most overrated celebrity, Pericelton 147. 147.
There's nobody else got even more than 31. How do you like that? 147, man.
She has got a lot of money and that's fine. A lot of people are born into rich families
and have her money, but why do they have to always be in our face? That's the question.
Dr. Phil 31. Erzatz. Howard Stern 23, Donald Trump 22. Tom Cruise 15. Tom A.
You're fair. Oprah 15. Jessica Simpson 14. Kevin Feederline 12.
Sarah Jessica Parker 11. Jennifer Lopez 11. J. Lowe. Martha Stewart 10. Victoria Gotti 9.
Ashton Kuchi Kuchi Kuchi 8. Adam Sandler 6. The Olsen 26. Van Aflach 5. Bill Marr 5.
Nicole Richie 4.
Ashley Simpson 4.
Four for Anna Cole Smith. Katie Kirk Bono and Melissa Rivers.
Three for Carson Daly Lindsay Lohan and Torrey Spelling and Tom Hanks.
A pair for Jay Leno, Barbara Streisand, the Rock, Ryan Seacrest,
Carrotop Joe Rivers. One Solomon Thauno for Nancy Grace,
where Zatzatz scandalists. She had like one million.
One for Clay Aiken, Tom Bergeron, Matt LeBlanc, Ray Romano and Jimmy Kimmel and Tara Reed,
and zero the big four. Simon Cowell, Jennifer Aniston, Paul Paulazone,
Hillary Duff and Dakota Fanny.
I'll be honest with you, and it's probably a good thing. I don't think most of our audience
watch this CNN. Good choice, by the way. Excellent.
Speaks very highly for the taste of this audience. Do not watch CNN. It'll poison your brain.
It'll turn into jello. And then when you least expect it, they'll throw a wiki-tiki
Sanchez under because he's on the payroll and they got to figure out something to do with his ass.
You notice how they keep him like out of prime time most of the time now?
Yeah, they do. They threw him there in the morning for a little while,
kind of like a trial balloon. And then, oh boy, they went over like a hot air balloon with a hole in it.
Not good. I don't even see what's your name. Kura Phillips on today. Maybe it's a reprieve for
me for the holidays. Eat it. Eat the ball. Ossas. There's a germany.
Yeah. All right. Woo.
That is really something. The people... I think they just go out in the sweet corners and they
pick these people up and they put them on there. How'd you like to be on CNN? If you're
worksheet, but just read the news off the monitor. They're just just reading a school. No problem.
In English. WQA and hello. Daniel, how you doing this, Jack? Pretty good, Pally.
I'd like to possibly add somebody from the local scene onto that pole.
Yeah. And I find this person nauseating, obnoxious, totally inept, and just completely incompetent.
And this person makes me nauseous. And the name is Belkis Nare.
Belkis Nare. I don't think she's like, today's overweight celebrity. We're talking about
big time. I'm not local, the locals. Belkis Nare. I agree with her. She gives me
Belkis too, but it's just... You know what I'm saying? Yeah. When we say we're talking about big,
big famous people who are splashed all over the TV, all of a sudden she is on your TV, but
no thanks. Plus you don't want to have to worry about how to spell it anyway, right?
I actually know how to spell it. But we don't want to put her on. There's so many holes.
No, no, no. She's been on plenty of other upholstery. Ripper asks. We'll do a poll next week
for you. Let her do your Ripper asks. Hey, Spelky, they hate you baby. Disgusting.
WQAM, hello. Okay, Pally. I want to ask somebody to do the boy. Okay.
Ashley Simpson. She's not in there. Okay. And another thing is, what you really think,
you start your oldest parody of Christmas and all that. It's kind of ridiculous. I'm sick of it.
Hey, didn't you get your, didn't you get your frankincense in Mour this year?
I'll send you some in a sack, man. All right, Pally. Okay, don't feel left out at frankincense in Mour.
Yeah, all this, all these fairy tales that all let's say with a Christmas and the tree, you know,
okay, it's fine. It's fun. People with the gifts and a feel of obligated to spend a lot of money.
It's good for commerce, you know, Hanukkah, Christmas, all those other crap.
So a bunch of bull crap. It's just a man made a bunch of fairy tales. In fact, it was on the
KLM flight that they had a thing about the finish in Finland is where they invented the first Santa
Club and then the Dutch picked it up and they called him Sartre Claus or something like that.
And it was kind of an interesting thing. They have like a whole history of this crap where it came
from. They answered this guy's question. I didn't watch it close enough to be able to relate
it to in the vision of which it's boring, but nevertheless, it's something to do, you know,
because people like ritual, they like, oh, it's a certain day of the month. Therefore, we must do
this. It's a certain time of year. Therefore, we must eat this and we must not eat that and
fill in the blanket. It's just a way of controlling people, of orchestrating your emotions, your actions,
your finances, everything that we do. People need to be controlled. I look what a great job
religion is done, keeping people, you know, decent to each other. What a fine job we've done for
eating with each other as humans and with the animal world and the planet that we live on. We've
done a fabulous job of destroying all of these. All of these things. Pretty sad, isn't it?
Yes. So that's why we don't think about it too much. Don't get too serious because you'll probably
turn on that John River show and blow your brains out. Next time she sits in for the king.
Would John and Melissa and Art Link Letter, who else did she have on there? Hemningway. Isn't
Miriel Hemningway or I get her confused with the one I actually killed herself?
Whichever one it is. And there was some other people on there. Like I said, it was so depressing,
right in the middle of the holiday season. Was it up to make you blow your brains out? So I guess
that's what they wanted to accomplish. Probably. I would think.
This pigeon of wanting to blow your brains out. He's coming up next. Here's your line
nine again QAM Joshua Curtis line. Hello. I'm one for the pole. Yes sir. Happy. Okay.
WQAM. Hello. Hey Neil, how you doing? Okay, palmy. I got one for your pole. Uh huh. Don Anus.
Okay, that's good. He's still on the year. I know it's amazing, but
it's good. Oh, it's too late. You know, Don Anus. Don Anus. Come on. I know, Don Anus. Let's get
with it. I miss it. So, wait a minute. What's better than a live radio show every morning on TV?
Well, just about anything. But that hasn't stopped him as NBC from cheating up with radio's
original bad boy who now looks like an ass-be-old lady. Listen, Bernie. I miss how that
internist's coffee sucks. Yes, every morning. See, I miss. Listen to a tape of other people's
Calibis. Why, Bob? The air. I did not hammered a bite into this muffin just so many of you
missed. Press one plate. I do. See his wild behind the scenes at it. I have to wait. I have to
find my man. You're a walrus. Cook, cook, and chew. Now get me some fresh coffee or your fire.
I miss. He's irreverent. So, uh, what's the deal with the pole? He's topical. Uh, what's the deal with
his water game? He's incoherent. I'll tell you what. That, uh, is it double or what? What's the
deal? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure.
This is Neil Rogers. This is 5'16". It's Dave. Hi. My name is Dave.
I'm a good student at 5'16". WQM. Here's a little number. I wrote the other day while not duck hunting with a judge.
What?
So how it's done must go. At her, me general, Ashcroft doesn't like strong words and so. He's charging twice as much as all the drugs for rushly moat.
So, you want so very much. So, for you very much, dear Mr. Bush.
For your rowy curly sitting on your tush. Rack them. For Haliburton. And wrong all the companies.
So, Haliburton. Let's send them a clear signal. Amstic marker straight in jail. She's a number two rich bitch. And at least she isn't.
So, for you also very much. So, you take her to tell me to. You and everything you do. Your pacemaker must be a fake.
You haven't got a mark. As far as I'm concerned you're just a face to face don't fall. And as for con delis, she's a little intellectual. So, for you also very much.
So, for you very much, be EPA. For giving all the laskers oil away. It really is a bummer when I can't fill my hunger.
The ozone. And now goes on. Now that animals hear the same. The nuclear intercaime. I'm going to tape left in LA.
So, for you also very much. So, what the planet fails. Let's save the great white males. You also very much.
It's 158. Look at that. Almost out of time. Can you believe that? Almost. Mollmysk are coming up next. Now, I'm looking through the DCS here. And you know we got about 85,000 different bits. Most of which I haven't played in a long time.
And I have one in here. I was thinking about the way you would respond especially after that little dump that you did before.
Right. Not much of a Johnny Cash pit. It's called Leanne Farts. Remember Leanne Rhymes?
Yes. And the whole thing, the whole bit, is her farting to the tune of different songs.
Not for better. Let me hear it. And I'm thinking about it. So, I could just see you lucky we had 16 different dump buttons. Just hoppin' on it.
You want to hear just like a little bit of it? Yeah, that's just a little bit or not. Not a good idea.
I'm trying to tell you what I'll let you play it on whenever you do your show. Well, let you play it.
And then, in fact, they can be the first. Leanne Farts. Listen to it in Q after the show is over. You'll find it. I'm thinking most amusing.
Anyway, speaking of most amusing, the mulmice. He's coming up next. Curtis Stevens in for the mad dog. He's out.
Mad dog is out until the new year. He's done. Yeah, he's headed. So we got Curtis Ford at 7, which is always a fine change.
And we got Hurricane Crab basketball coming up. Pre-game at 7 o'clock, 7 30 to game time. And Jesse Agler was highly touted by Josh Cordis.
Jesse Agler at 9 30 to 2. Highly touted. Wouldn't you agree? Yeah, he's good.
You're the one who said it. He's pretty damn good. He wouldn't be surprised to be got a full time gig pretty soon.
I don't know what time. Who's today's most overrated celebrity? I just give you the double digits.
Okay, because that's all the time we got. We certainly don't want to move into most time. Parasilton 156. Dr. Phil 32.
I mean, she is so far out in front. She's like in a different racetrack. Howard sperm 26, Donald Trump 23.
All for 16. Tommy Cruz 15. Jessica Simpson 14. Kevin Peterline 13. Sarah Jessica Parker 12.
Jelo 12. And Martha Stewart that. How many white bitches got 10? Bye, bye, bye.
