Damn. Did he say it kills the mow?
Go, go, go, go.
Boy. What's man?
You know.
All right.
Time to go to Toronto.
Literally.
Really?
Gotta get out of here and go someplace.
I don't think so.
I think there's a, you got a stop name.
Yeah.
You got a stop miss one in all of your,
they haven't got a clue.
They don't know where it's going.
Because they, now they're saying, well,
it's still going to do west.
And we don't understand that and,
I'm going to beat the, the boot, the debuff.
I think it's going to go over to Yucatan
and then just zip out of the gulf and go straight
toward New Orleans again.
You know, they didn't get the message
the first two times to clean up their act
and the Lord wants them to cut the crap.
Well, hey, maybe this warning us
against those slot machines here.
I mean, any, any, uh,
town has got a, the main drag is called Bourbon Street.
What does that tell you about the,
what kind of a,
a slow-moly course ball placed in?
I don't like that city at all.
I liked it.
I hated it.
Well, you like it because you like the fairgrounds probably.
No, I actually don't like the fairgrounds that.
Really?
Never been there.
I have.
Won't be going to the fairgrounds or Las Vegas
at any time in the future.
In fact, when you were getting up to, uh,
a horizontal fairground.
I was just dragging my ass in from Woodbine.
Can you believe that?
This morning?
Yeah.
You were there all night.
I had a, uh, long session.
And, not only it was, I mean,
it was a good rush.
It made all my money back with one, uh,
a little bit.
How do you like that?
That's the best.
That's the best when you go back.
I couldn't leave because, I mean,
I got a hot machine mine,
so I couldn't leave.
So you stayed all night?
Till, uh, about 2.30.
Wow.
Yeah.
So if I sound a little bit out of it,
it's because I'm a little bit out of it.
Too bad.
I did not win the, uh,
15, uh, the, uh, 25 million lotto.
Last night, but the good news is nobody else
did either.
So Saturday, it's up to 30.
About 30 million.
So if I should win that Saturday,
I'll see you all postcard from anywhere.
Anywhere I want to go.
That's true.
Anywhere I feel like going.
Well, and I see this broad
that won the power ball, 340 million.
Yeah.
And that little bit of overkill,
wouldn't you say, 340 million?
Did you get it all at once?
Oh, I doubt it.
It's a US thing.
So she probably got to pay tax and all, you know.
Although I take it.
Yeah.
It's a rip off,
but I like that check, you know.
Yeah.
I win the lotto here.
You go, in fact, that time I had 5 out of 6,
and I got the 16 hundred bucks.
I just got in the cab and I went over to the lotto place
and they showed you your ID and you give them the ticket.
And they write you, you said,
sit down for a couple of minutes,
and they write you out of check and, uh,
have a nice day, and that's it.
Well, let's just then,
I reported this earlier that I've heard from one of my network sources
that the Doffins Kansas City Game might be played tomorrow night here.
Tomorrow night.
So I thought maybe somebody should call the other station
and say, hey, you might have to go on here tomorrow,
like at 730 or something,
because they probably don't know.
Well, they're going to be saying,
cottage over there by that time,
anyway, with the book coming out tomorrow,
and all those all over the place.
I'm telling you, it's going to be a very ugly scene for them.
Astro is going to the World Series.
Does anybody care?
I sure don't.
I don't care.
I like the Astro.
Is there okay?
I like to fact that Craig Bidjo has been playing here since he was like five years old
about a hundred years,
and he's trying to go over the World Series.
That's good.
He's a good guy.
Yeah.
So Saturday night.
What?
The World Series.
That's what you think.
Now, is that going to be in the Chicago or Houston?
Chicago.
Well, it's a good thing for that,
because who knows you this?
This thing that may go to her in Houston again.
We don't know.
They haven't got any ID.
Nobody has any idea where this thing is going.
This is one of the most mysterious and bizarre things,
and it's going to the West Men.
It's supposed to make this loopy loop,
and they're not getting less sure by the minute.
Now, there was a notice in my building that said that if we had to evacuate,
that they would turn the power off in the building.
Yeah.
Why didn't they do that?
Well, what floor do you live on?
The fourth.
Oh, and that's not too bad.
No.
So why would they turn the power off?
You're asking me?
Well, maybe they want to decrease the population in there.
Maybe you've got some old gears in there who might croak walking down the civil flights as soon as possible.
When I left to come to work this morning,
there were people in their cars leaving.
Now, did you finally put food in a refrigerator or not?
I don't think this thing's coming either.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Oh, guess who had a heart attack?
Who?
Probably one of your favorite actresses, Fat Shelley Winners.
God, I know she went to Hawaii.
Two of... I thought she was dead too.
She went to Academy Awards, was nominated two more times.
She suffered a heart attack yesterday.
Well, I guess she's suffered it Friday, but she's a coming back.
She's doing... she's only 85.
Yeah.
And then, the son that beside an adventure, all of these are things.
She was... when she was real young, yeah, she was a looker, yeah.
She was kind of...
What George was saying before?
Yeah.
She was kind of a dish.
And then, of course, she got a little...
She's been so much time hovering over the dish.
But too much food in a refrigerator and look what happened to her.
It's not her what it was.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Yeah, when you have a lot of food in a refrigerator, you have it.
Well, I will admit to that, and that is on those rare occasions,
when I used to really go to the supermarket and stock up with stuff,
then I'd go home and I'd sample everything.
You know, oh gee, I got this and I got to try that.
And I go, oh yeah, and I got that.
Tomorrow I'll be stocking up.
Huh?
I'll stock up tomorrow just again.
Here's what they're saying now.
The one thing to notice, the storm is slowing down,
and it's likely to re-intensify before it approaches the eukitent
sometime today into tomorrow.
That means it could get back to category five strength before it either
makes landfall on the eukitent or just skirts it either way,
if likely, that brings you strong wind and heavy down force to that region.
And the more interacts with land, of course, the worst off it is for Mexico,
the better it is for the U.S. mainland because that interaction with land
will likely weaken the storm.
But the track still contains the movement to the right.
We're seeing that sharp right turn and eventually landfall.
Yeah, just like the country, it's taking a sharp turn to the right.
You see that?
See all these things fit together in the part of life?
Yeah, so all part of the grand plot.
Yeah, part of God's plan.
So anyway, Shelley Wooders is still alive.
That's a good news.
Oh, that's good news.
At least in Astro as I go to the World Series for the first time.
I guarantee that it will start to thrilled about this.
Chicago is number three market, right?
Yeah, third.
Yeah.
And Houston is like number 7,000 or something.
Oh, he has a big market.
Doesn't seem like a really sexy matchup to me.
I mean, it is nice that there's two teams that never get there, but nevertheless.
Could be a very interesting story.
Well, I don't think there will be a lot of fans in this game.
I hope you enjoyed a lot.
The World Series?
I will not be watching it.
Unomomento, not one.
Not one second.
If there's racing going on, I probably won't be watching it.
Really?
If there is racing going on.
I'm not sure if there's a racing going on.
I'm not sure if there's a racing going on.
I'm not sure if there's a racing going on.

Actually, I'm going out to the Marlin's press conference to meet Joe Joradi.
Oh, I'm going out to Joe Joradi.
Joe Joradi.
Come on, you know those ex-cubs.
That was a great year.
Damon, very ill, and Joe Joradi.
Yeah, with the two catchers.
It'll be interesting to see what he does.
But where is he managed so far, minor league?
Never.

The winks you and they who came to come to your faith
You come home in the house of the church
Where they come to lay
The beef made from off the fire
The gears little prince can't lay
They'll all be doing some time
It's just a matter of where it's with my crew
We'll reach the kids in the sofa
The children be gathering down by the jail yard
It's a grand old party here at the jail yard
A morning fritz fight which is our hot topic tonight
It would be maker break time for president
To advise your car all roads
Bush and brain will face a grand jury for the fourth time
The senate ethics committee
Investigate senator fritz
It could do their own investigation
Along with the securities and exchange commission
And the US attorney got that
The way it's posted post-accessive that we two of them
Has been invited in connection with his kids
For a left-swoivy SEC is involved
Under fire in the CIA lead case
In a couple of days the commentator overwaking
Is to play for the silly lead
Go to the right for right once you're delivered by time
They're all over the cover of his week
Love their own railway
I don't know where they're going
They're on their way
There's two in time before the two of us share
Good night, Carl!
The leader came to the sofa
See the children be gathering down by the jail yard
Or they'll try to fool you but play in the fear card
Absolutely
They'll try to distract you but play in the fear card
Historians expect the president to be unloved by the heat
And I'm going to talk about the investigation
It's completely investigation, it's completely completely
This is Neil Rogers
This is 5.69 am
We're in the Banana Republic baby
Only in Miami
Even after his fact, we're in a huge
With all the soldiers of a massive faculty in the arms
There's information they don't want you to know
So the peer factor keeps you under control
We accept the views as what they're in the view
With all the soldiers of a massive faculty in the arms
Through the day and over soon to share in the show
In the very yellow box of wood
That's not something you'll see on the news
With all the soldiers of a massive faculty in the arms
Through the orientation of the global champion
Let by a simple, kindred artist play
Fancy comic practices with Dave on the two
With all the soldiers of a massive faculty in the arms
I'm dying out of here
10.21, Tippie Hebron is a little bit concerned
Mark Twain for the poll, somebody faxed it
He's not even having a chat anywhere near today yet
We got a lot of fish to fry today
We got the look coming out tomorrow
Looks like the indictments in Plaingate won't be until maybe early next week now
Maybe
We're not sure of that, but I'm just to have been reading these things
Anyway, I'm sure that the audience is just
Jones didn't know about Hurricane Wilma
Whether they should crawl into the bed
They should put up the shutter
They should think about it and they should go out and buy a bunch of lumber
And by the way, now that it is after October 1, keep this in mind
Here's some good news for you
For Hurricane seasons in the future
And that is that your fat ass governor gives you the green light
If you go to one of the stores where you're buying your lumber
And your plywood or maybe just your bottled water in the supermarket
And somebody like cuts in front of you and tries to grab your stuff
Just roll them away because they're jeopardizing your family's livelihood
And their welfare and being
Don't jostle me
That's right, if somebody jostles you
Or looks at you like they're going to grab that bottle of water
But a bing, that's also a sure way to get your fair share
From a quick draw
And the fat ass governor will come in and probably give you a golden medal and a purple jelly bean or something like that
Or maybe some milk coke
Hurricane Wilma weekends to category 4 may not reach South Florida until Monday
But of course, like you were just here and before
It's probably going to get back to a 5 and then the 4 and a 3 and 1
And it's like a Lawrence Well-Currican, a 1 and a 2
They don't know
They haven't got a clue
Much of Florida went on high alert as Wilma exploded
And the most intense hurricane on record yesterday but the storm began to slow
It may not reach South East Florida till Monday morning they're seeing now when it's winds as high as 120 miles an hour in driving rains
But then again on the other hand
Because of the slow moving storm officials and the key change the mandatory evacuation from the day until tomorrow
Friday
And South Florida coastal residents and those in mobile homes might be ordered to evacuate by tomorrow
Might be
A small ray of hope emerged
Defoella continues on its current path and rams in Mexico as Yucatan Peninsula
It's anticipated where it turned toward this region could be altered in the system strength weekend
The National Hurricane Center be saying
If it just goes 20 or 30 miles
30 miles and the coral could be destroyed
Center can't specialisticity stew it a lot of the pen on the exact track
You know like whether it's a calder or like the fairgrounds or Santa Anita
Eight o'clock this morning Wilma which has already left at least 13 people dead
An unlucky number for them was about 1795 miles southeast of Kazumel, Mexico slowly churning west northwest at seven miles an hour with sustained winds of 145 miles an hour
Which is nothing to see Zad now it says here west northwest but they've been saying it's a lot more west
Have you been watching it? Yeah, how can you not? Yeah, it's under like every seven second sure
The expected turn to the northwest hadn't happened yet keeping the storm on a track toward the Yucatan
The eye wall of Wilma was going through a weakening phase kind of like the numbers over there for Joel
Oh weakening phase where they replacement forming within 24 hours and the hurricane going through another strengthening
It's up. It's down. It's in and out. It's strong. It's weak. They're after a portion of the circulation will be interacting with the Yucatan peninsula
And they'll be increasing winds here
Wilma should then begin a steady weakening trend of hurricane center said in a statement
Which of course can clicks with what they're telling us now about how it's going to become a five again before who knows
It's kind of like you know reminds me of maybe this could be the John Kerry hurricane remember
He was against it before he was for it or was it was for it before it was against it and this is a weakening before
Restraintening yeah, it's a waffling a hurricane forget out your waffles and to have a good time under
The current forecast track the system was struck near Naples on Sunday right over Joyce's head oh god
In fact, I would be surprised if the eye of that thing would blow right through Joyce's back though wouldn't that be sweet?
Oh there oh man what a big target hurricane center meteorologist Jennifer Prowgo
Whoever that is you know who that is nope. Oh, how you doing Jennifer sending pictures naked place
Said it was no longer expected to be major hurricane after making it slow pass over the Yucatan
Oh, that's contradictory
We expected to be a category two at landfall of Florida. Well that they are saying
Cat 2 have winds of 96 110 miles an hour remember when Katrina came in how they totally blew that and they said oh it's only going to be a category one
And about 75 miles an hour and then it came in like at about 95 mile an hour
And it left an enormous amount of rent and did a lot of damage mostly indeed where God has really pissed off that they turned that
Slotting down in the referendum that they're all following goose stepping along with your fat ass governor
Anyway, then it would roll through the north end of Palm Beach County early Mondays a cat 1 or 2 hurricane
It would again keep in mind that all of this is so strictly speculative right now so I don't want to be you know I
Want to be hanging this like a toy coming in around Monday's oh gee really messed up on this one again try
I'm not a meteorologist. Okay. I know we had that great crack news staff at Q.A.M. The severe weather expected to be widespread because
Wilma's expected to grow in size with its strongest winds likely to extend more than a hundred miles from its center
Hurricane winds now extend 90 miles from the center
This is going to be a big hurricane with all the nasty conditions including strong winds and storms
Stirred a stirred to what's said no matter how you slice it. It's going to be bad this weekend
It's going to be bad she said after the storm clears out cooler dryer conditions will prevail in South Florida
It could be the nicest weather the seasons said Eric Blake meteorologist at the hurricane center so I was to show you before you had the good weather you have to put up with you know a little service
Right big big bad hurricane five more degrees not to be in South Florida not to be in the sunshine state
What the hell's that got to do with sunshine anyway?
Hey, I mean he's also my yesterday's pool what tall Greg because it might be very interesting factly sent but we can't read it
So Greg read center facts no I know he doesn't speak to us
Hey Greg, I'm sorry he sent your facts in a such a way that it can be read or what is it about?
I don't know if you'll find it can't be read see it's like well how do you know it's interesting if I don't I'm giving in the benefit of it I see
Okay anyway, I wanted to mention log on to wqm.com and 11 o'clock this morning for a live broadcast is the Florida Marlins introduced new manager Joe Jalarda
A Jorari former Cubs catcher who else did he play for after the Cubs they created him away he played he was around I think he was a janky
That's right absolutely correct he was the Yankees and then the Jor Torrey took him under his wing that is correct
But Joe Jorari at least in my book best known for being the when it comes to that great year what was it 89?
Yeah, he's best known for the flat top
Like I said if anybody cares just go to qm.com and by the way speaking of that very very weak website
Josh Cordis is personally taken it over and is going to make it a hell of a lot better than the embarrassing piece that it is right now
Even more than the same writers he speaks like that
1622
I was working in this ten-seller research lab with new thousand and that thing is like what I give it a star
There's more reckless kids for the world to be always all right there in my George P3 bowl
I do stem cells for the school for the school for the school for the school for the science and for the science
With nice and steady search for the thoughts that's waiting for me
I can store my name in books
You will bring me to the world's day if I can take a understood
That's what I'm going to tell you about the day I told you about the same thing
He asked me to only put a stop to all this
Is there anything you can do about my Lynn Greve?
Nick said, George, it's not this thing
I asked for it to be this way
Well, if you insist, he drove it home to show his kids
It may have been an empirical call sandwiching
I do stem cell research
New more pupils were the first to stem
It's either me or the third
I do stem cell research
Oh, that's what you can call me
It's not this way
Hey, thanks a lot
I'm a man again
I just showed a couple of you folks in Brown County run out there getting your plywood
Slip it on your pickup trucks and I'm going to tell you to do it
You know what the fat boy says an ounce of a prevention is worth 400 pounds
Is that what he says?
In England I think something like that can be else is worth 400 pounds
What do you face to me here?
Oh, something like that?
Well, I can just barely read the art that I could do
It's scouting for camel toads at pools and?
Yes
Boy, this is a bad copy, it's dark, it's skin-ster man
That's as good as it gets
And what is it about?
Camel toads
Oh, camel toads
Well, I'll put it down here at the bottom of my pile and eventually maybe later on but I doubt it
Here's yesterday's pool result
You see how far behind we are because of the fact that we can family with the Humper a lot
And he continues bashing my good friend Moe badly keep it up Hank
Because we're a couple of old Jews, you're taking over the back fence and ripping and tearing and detuing and clawing and whatever
And we know somebody is listening out there
I know you're going to play that drop in I just it's just a matter of moments I can count
Who knows those three
Who are what best to minimize as America's celebration of mediocrity was our podium yesterday?
1703 vote
George W. Bush 808, like I said yesterday that would be fine if he were only mediocre if we could only pray he would reach that level
But unfortunately he's many notches beneath that but he want to pull hands down 808
The education system 199 of course he epitomizes that
The Democratic Party 129, WIMPS, WEEK, just spineless
TV 85, it is so bad
Paracelotin 52 speaking of TV, Harriet Myers 44
In fact I prefer Oscar and Chuck Myers over Harriet any day
I prefer Harriet Hillier myself
I bet you most people didn't know that there was Ozzy Nelson and Harriet Hillier
Why did she have a different last name?
I don't know, a lot of people do that
In show business especially
Ashley Simpson 40, the NFL 40
I see a strong correlation there
Maybe she can go on a Super Bowl next year
For a little booby flap
Brownie Brown, heck of a job by one, heck of a incompetent man 39
Converse 36 John Kerry 32, the old waffle man
I wonder if John Kerry has a waffle iron you think
Rackney, you know how in some restaurants they name dishes after like athletes or politicians things like that
Like the Neely Burgers that they're right
Well maybe some Washington restaurant can have like the John Kerry waffles
They can have Belgian waffles
Right
Rackney is a 29 and that's again mediocre is way much of a compliment for that
Condoleezza 28 maybe your next vice president
Condoleezza with a really bad teeth
We could you see you know the interesting part of it is that if Condoleezza does run against Hillary in 2008
It guarantees a bold-eyed president vice president
Right?
Wouldn't that be something that would be a first?
I think so
Al Gore 25, Julie Bremen 22 speaking of WIMPS J-Leno 16 very weak in J-Low 13
Anything with a J-G
You look at it, you got Julie Bremen J-Leno in J-Low
Victoria Gotti 10, Regis Filman 9
It's big Regis, Rita Cosby 8
And that's just one of those mysteries
Al Frank and 8, Ben Avril, 8
Al Michael 7, I forgot to tell Hank about that, he'd be wild about that
Who did Hank get to see the mad dog thing?
No, he said he had to go to the press conference so he'll have to see it tomorrow
What are we going to do about him?
Nothing?
No, seriously, what are we going to do about the Humper, right?
He needs to see that
Don't you think he would like just about what is pancier than what something absolutely?
Yeah, well what's the big deal with this stupid ass press conference?
Who cares about it?
So, Joe Gerardi is going to be the new Marlins manager, former catcher for the Cubs in the Yankees
A few other joints, it was like a mediocre at best, right handed hitter
He platoon with Damon Berryhill in the 89 Cubs drive for the pennant
Which of course they lost
Let's see, Al Michael 7, the NBA 7, Nancy Grace, Grace Nancy has got 6 friend
Thank you, friend
John Laguziamo, I have no idea who that is
Like another, lucky actor too
And George Lucas won
I believe he is
You're right, but I hope that this is the one thing
They've turned on him like a cornered rat
Okay, now let's see, now is this, see, this one from John, I don't know if this is for yesterday's pull
Or today's pull
Take a pic
Huh?
Well, the fact that he's been dead for a few years now, I think it's got to be for, is this man serious?
His all-time favorite American was Bob Hope
John, and you spent too much time in South Carolina with those far-bison of Goya, man
I tried to ward out
Huh?
I tried to warden people about South Carolina
Bob, I hope my ass
Good, Goli, and somebody else, well today's pull is, now you're gonna say, well you've done this, no we haven't
We've asked you, who is your, who is the greatest all-time American, and there's a big difference between that, and who's your all-time favorite American
It could be like soupy sales, you know, it could be anybody who's your favorite, and that could be somebody great, or it didn't have to be the greatest, a very, very big difference
I probably like a minor difference in your mind, but to me, believe me, it's another easy pull
So that's the question to your all-time favorite, and we got another pull, it said, I, I, I, I, I, I'd like to nominate
Sakka Goya, who the hell is that? Sakka Goya, they explained it on the back
The Indian shit guy who kept Lewis and Clark entertained Rob to discover the West, she got her own postage stamp
Sakka Goya, they would have died without her
Sakka Goya, is, huh?
Well good, just stick around there
Sakka Goya, post-billed, and on the pull
Anyway, here's what we got so far in our pull today, and don't forget to logout to QM.com and love it at the clock, it's come out for only minutes from now for that big, big, big Marlon press conference
Joe Gerardi, you're never still afraid to any, he's a good guy, I like Joe Gerardi, not a lot, but he's all right, good at training boy
Somebody's gonna call and say, well he's not a tag in the, oh yeah, oh and you know something?
No, I think he ought to put him on here right now, Joe Gerardi?
No, on our pull today, Joe Gerardi, no, you want me to give you a clue who it's gonna be?
All right, your gay
Yeah, put Reverend Jones on the pull because if we don't he'll call in, you know?
Well, they hold on to Reverend Jones, oh yeah, put him on there just for kicks, it'll give him and his boyfriend something to do
408 votes so far, that's not, it's okay, not up to our standard this week so far, but you know, a lot of you people are busy doing stuff trying to save your lives
and we'll get let you off though for that for all time's sake.
Who is your all-time favorite American Bill Clinton, 88, good choice, I didn't vote for Bobo, but good choice, JFK 40 and other good choice didn't vote for him either.
Ben Franklin 39, FDR 35, Hugh Hefter is tied with Thomas Jefferson, they have...
They both had slaves, 8-22, Ronnie both had sex slaves, Ronnie Reagan 20, Tom Edison 16, Albert Einstein 15, Al Goldstein 13, you see that, a Jewish Al by any other name, Einstein Goldstein, Glickstein, right?
Right, that's fantastic.
Oh wait, every time I think Einstein, I always think Al Goldstein the same breath, don't you really know?
George Washington 10, Mark 29, Teddy Roosevelt 9, Elvis 9, George W's got 6, that makes me want a puke, Thomas Payne, that's why voted for 5.
In fact, it's not interesting that T.W. is up there, probably the biggest Payne in history and Tom Payne is right under his ass, with 5.
Dr. Ruth Scott for Alfred Kinsey III, Pervert, Rush Limbaugh III, Marilyn Monroe II, and Bob Hope just went on her and so far, old ski-nos has got and deservedly so the big...
Oh! This is Neal Rogers, this is 5-62-A-F.
New bits, New Strat, New Horror.
Every morning at the chando, I can see elevated down, and on my way to the car when I put my golden basket out, I give a free condo paper.
I'm set to go on your back and tell us why you love me.
I've got a whole new sport old food. I know everything that's going on in tattoos, why I even know all the new Maja rules.
I've been to the gym, Daddy O'Rees.
You've had your door locked down high, you've said that it's you and I take you place. I know I ain't no way clearly me, but when they drop high boys will change.
1048-560W-QAM, we're just minutes away from that big Marlon's press conference on, not on a station, but on our website, on their website, qm.com.
I don't want to do that, even Josh don't want to be associated with that one. When it gets to be new and improved, he'll take credit.
Any day now. But in the meantime, here's the 11 o'clock advisory on Hurricane Wilma.
Sit on the edge of your seat, put your knees together very tightly, stick your finger way down your throat on your right hand, take your left hand, take the middle digit and stick it deep inside your back bone.
And just hang on tight. Another good idea? Excellent idea. And it's just practice for a teacher, you know, when the government gets yelled with deputy or friends, he would love them on those phonia terrorist alerts.
Okay, Hurricane Wilma extended southward on the Yucatan. At 11 o'clock this morning, the government of Mexico has extended the Hurricane Wilma to Tadamal, whatever that is. Oh, there's my favorite music.
Hurricane Wilma is now in effect from Sant Elipe to Tadamal on the Yucatan Peninsula, including Kazimella, Minerbar Islands. Hurricane Wilma is also in effect for Swan Island.
A travel of storm warning in Hurricane Wilma is in effect from west of Sant Elipe to Salistun. What happened in my music? Oh, a travel of storm warning remains in effect for Belize from the border with Mexico, southward to Bailey City.
A travel of storm warning is in effect for the provinces of La Habana. Uh oh, see you that way, how they La Habana. Pinard del Rio and the Isle of Youth.
A hurricane watcher means in effect in Cuba for the provinces of Montanza, westward through Pinard del Rio and to the Isle of Youth.
A travel of storm warning remains in effect for Honduras from the Honduras, Nicaragua border westward to Cabo Camarón. All interest in the Florida Keys and the Florida Pininsula should closely monitor the progress of extremely dangerous, extremely dangerous Hurricane Wilma.
Not just dangerous, not just kind of sort of dangerous, but it says here from the National Hurricane Center, extremely dangerous Hurricane Wilma. Oh, my God.
Exactly. Uh, the center at the 11 o'clock this morning center for it's interesting that they're saying this because this came over like five minutes ago and it was recorded while I'm well or close.
The center of Hurricane Wilma was located near latitude 18.4 north, longitude 85.5 west or about 170 miles south southeast of Carzano, Mexico.
Wilma is moving toward the west northwest at near seven miles an hour, a turn toward the northwest is expected later today.
Maximum sustained winds near 145 miles an hour with higher gusts. Wilma is a cat for Hurricane on the surface and scale.
Some restrank the thing is forecast during the next 24 hours. See, I don't understand why they keep doing that. Some events about miles wreaking.
Some restrank the thing is forecast during the next 24 hours. And then after that. Yeah, who knows Hurricane forced winds extend outward up to 90 miles from the center and tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 260 miles.
The estimated minimum central pressure is 915 millibar 27.0 to which is not the the dashed or the number was yesterday, but that's still up to good.
Coastal storm surge flooding is 7 to 10 feet above normal tide levels along with large and dangerous battering waves can be expected nearer to the north of where the center makes landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula.
Wilma is expected to produce 10 to 20 inches of rain through Saturday across forces of western Cuba and the Yucatan with isolated amounts of 40 inches possible, especially over higher to Indian western Cuba.
They're going to get soaked in Cuba, man. I bet you're having a lot to be happy about this additional rainfall accumulations of two to four inches with isolated amounts of eight inches are possible across the Cayman Islands, Swan Island portions of Honduras through Friday.
The next intermediate advisory will be at two o'clock, so I'm probably a quarter of a check on there and we'll pass it along.
Pass it all stone and pass the morning along. So the best thing is even say anything about Florida this one because they just they don't know, you know, it's supposed to make that you turn supposed to go through the Yucatan and then make that right that sharp turn to the right like America has politically and then about a bing, you know, right through Naples, right over rejoices desk.
Yeah, see God is really P.O. to you, Joyce. You know what I just printed out you mean I'm not going to get it panicky. I'm not going to waste your time with it today. What up?
No, let me reach back here and grab it because it's 12 pages long. Oh, good God. The motion picture code, production code of the 1930s, the Hayes code, which of course the Catholic church, your muscle, the way in with the Hollywood people to control what the content. When you hear this, I will take one day. I might spend the whole day on a one day.
Not coincidentally, that's when the thing started sucking really hard. Yeah, because they used to be fun like in the 70s. I mean, I bet I mean the things that they just just, for example, let me find the thing about obscenity and word gesture reference song joke read them by suggestion.
Even when likely to be only understood by part of the audience is forbidden. Sound familiar Joyce, this is 1930. The treatment of low disgusting on pleasant, though not necessarily evil, Sunday should always be some of the dictates of good taste in regard for the sensibilities of the audience pointed.
The idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea
of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of
an art and as a beautiful form of expressing human emotions, but dances which suggest
or represent sexual actions, whether it performs solo or with two or more, dances extend
to excite the emotional reaction of an audience, dances with movement of the breast, excessive
body movements while the feet are stationary, violate the agency and are wrong.
How do you like that?
Okay, so make sure to move your feet.
And one more religion.
The reason why ministers of religion may not be comic characters or villains is simply
because the attitude taken toward them may easily become the attitude taken to a religion
in general.
Religion is lowered in the minds of the audience because of the lowering of the audiences
respect for a minister.
How do you like that?
Oh, sorry, that's wrong.
Yeah, so that's just a little tidbit on the board.
Just a little piece.
Okay, let's get a whole bunch more names on here and don't forget in six minutes you got
that big Joe Gerardi.
Welcome to South Florida, Marlon's Manager, stuff on qm.com.
Anybody interested?
How many people are going to be checking that out?
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60.
Five, 60 in the Verizon and Singular wireless line.
I see Reverend Jones already has a vote.
See, I told you.
No problem.
WQA in, hello.
Thank you.
How you doing?
Pretty good, Pali.
Good, listen, I was going to this conspiracy website last night.
Here's the latest that they say our government is checking out.
They believe that these terrorists, these Muslims, right, are doing something to warm the
water over.
That was as well as it's being in the water over there, which is causing...
Yeah, did we get a mark?
Let's write the terrorists are being in the water.
That's where this global warming has come from.
That's where we got these big hurricanes.
I think that's possible.
Keep them out of the pool.
Tea in the water.
I just had two of the soak on the water.
I can hear a book of Brian's bit right now where I can't hear.
Two of the water matches.
Oh, you water.
It sure doesn't increase that temperature.
Especially like in a small pool.
It's a dynamite.
Save a lot on heating that baby.
WQA in, hello.
Steve Perry.
There you go.
Let's put Steve Perry on there.
What do you say?
That's the garbage in the hole.
Do we have to spell it that way though?
Yeah.
Steve Perry.
I like that.
No.
There's no way.
I like that.
I like that.
I like that.
I like that.
I like that.
I like that.
I like that.
I like that.
There are five, six hundred million among friends, right?
Maybe a couple of trillion.
Another few thousand dead people, Americans and Brits.
And of course another one, maybe three, four hundred thousand schmataes.
We don't really care about them anyway.
President Boss is a man devoted to peace.
Oh, there you go.
Peace of this and a piece of that.
Maybe a piece of punky pie too.
1057 at 560 QAM.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 560 QAM.
We'll be starting momentarily.
And when it does WQAM.com will take you live to doff and stadium for the announcement and introduction of the Marlon's new skipper.
Don't go anywhere.
The press conference will be underway shortly.
It's the lotion and the basket.
They put the lemon in the Pepsi and they do this back out.
They put the lemon in the Pepsi, but it's not there any more.
They put the lemon in the Pepsi and they do this back out.
They put the lemon in the Pepsi every three.
When they do it out, I say, Mommy.
I don't like it with the lime.
I said, Mommy.
I feel a lot less like it was with the mommy.
Yeah, I haven't felt this sad.
Mommy, since they just couldn't do you, Chad.
They put the lemon in the Pepsi and they took it all away.
They put the lime in the Pepsi, but it doesn't taste the same.
I used to drink lemon Pepsi with my shoes, with my legs.
And then I would hover in my hero and please go go in and ask her for a lime.
Mommy.
I prefer lime.
Maybe a dog better.
Pepper would be better.
Mommy.
Dog better.
That'd be a pepper too.
Dog better.
Business is from the business.
Mommy.
Dog better.
I can advise you for a break.
Sometimes I wish I was great.
They put the lemon in the Pepsi, but they took it all away.
Sorry, that's not what Greg requested, but you know something after reading this facts a second time.
I realized Greg's a little on the pushy side here.
Why do you like to show Greg and that you're listening and your kids and your mother-in-law
and everybody else but cut the crap.
They don't have to do.
Please play the classic lotion in the basket, soon in the time of lime in the coconut.
It's been five years since I've heard it.
Not the lemon in the Pepsi that I just played, but the body argumenter.
I have no idea what he's talking about.
The lotion in the basket, so.
Oh, lotion.
Yeah.
It's not called the lotion, it's well called this.
Loathe.
That's the lime in the coconut.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
It mixes it all up.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
It puts them both together.
It puts the lotion in the basket where the eyeball falls out, but puts the lotion in the basket.
That it has to hold it out.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
It's what I have to do.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
It's the rubber that does my front.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I have to try to eat my skin so it puts the lotion in the basket.
I just thought, uh, I switch my TV.
It by legs I say, uh, uh.
I like to dance around his ways.
Follow me.
Follow the left.
Follow me.
Follow me.
I want to look more like a wolf.
My name is Pablo Ville.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
It makes it for my skin.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I hold it by TV.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
How much does it go?
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I got my skin so people like me.
I'm the best.
I'm the best.
I'm the best.
I'm the best.
I'm the best.
I'm the best.
I'm the best.
I'm the best.
And as a fat guy's in the mouth.
Yeah.
I think this is a funny fact.
He went all these websites on here.
Very says lastly, my 12-year-old daughter is on the show.
Please play sugar shoppers for them.
He wants, you know, he's going to like program the whole rest of the show here.
Let's wait for them.
And then he says, I was really down on Tuesday when I couldn't listen to the podcast from Monday on your website.
I was in forward of the show daily, regardless of who is the host.
God, this baseball crap is terminal.
What does that mean?
We don't have no ball game on Monday.
I guess we were down on the internet stream.
I don't know.
No, we were not.
We were.
Okay.
One day we have no other dropouts.
What does that have to do with baseball?
All he's talking about today, I asked.
Yeah.
Which by the way, that's over.
Yeah.
They switched us back during the break.
Ask me if I care.
Can you say it?
Sounds like a good lawsuit to me.
Oh, Greg, it's a suit.
Just said that he could duck going again because he's such a whooist.
By the way, if you ever call him here again, Duff or Clarence, you're going to hear.
You know what they're going to hear right away?
Let me give you a preview.
All right.
That's what they're going to hear.
All right.
I will not talk to them.
They just cut the cord today.
This was over and above.
If they just would have given us a heads up and said, okay, well, go on a year and you're not going to.
Yeah, all because how did we know?
We didn't have any idea that our streaming was going to be affected by their stupid ass cheesy website.
Well, there's a max headroom.
The panel very early in Saudi.
Connesty boring.
And then as it turns towards the Northeast, the there's certainly some uncertainty on the exact.
You were that's from the go.
But I mean, it's not about appears that most of the malls are still showing an impact on the 40 keys and the southern four to peninsula.
The timing is such that we would.
We really need to help the wind.
The wind.
Don't do that.
I see it on the other hurricane.
The hurricane fourth wind 60 now about 90 miles away.
I'm sure we expect man.
And they talk storm 40 keys.
Two and 60 miles.
So it's got a larger hurricane not quite as intense as yesterday, but still something.
There's one of your guys.
Yes, he must have been in a very large area.
So I think there's four.
I don't know if that one.
I was going to talk to you about that.
Yeah, I'm going to be in your guys.
Not the folks in this.
There's some guy that's in the row.
That's the probability of time would you know north of between the hurricane and the high or it could be farthest away from the 40 key.
The fact that it sets a large or the 40.
So the large area.
The most likely scenario here up we're close.
What is he doing there?
Do you see that?
That was like that thing on our website.
The change in his book.
I talked to Dr. Fortran and the key.
Yeah.
And even here.
Oh man.
I think we don't have very early Saturday.
He was twisting it.
I'm sorry.
I don't want to hear about it.
It's named for it.
Have the warnings.
No, right of the Saturday morning.
Oh god.
He is so ponderous this max headroom.
Jesus.
By the time he gets in the middle of the first sentence, you're already nodding off into a coma.
Even if he had anything significant to say, which obviously he does not, we don't be nodding off.
He's okay.
So there you go.
Oh, and by the way, Greg.
You take it.
What's real bad for you, but tastes real good.
Yeah.
He went into the excess energy to drive Mom crazy.
Yeah.
So what breakfast, Ariel?
Will you tell Mom to buy?
Next time she goes shopping.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Two super sugarcoated sugar shoppers are little bits of raw cane to trench them honey and coated with powdered sugar.
Glucose, glucose, corn syrup and other natural sweeteners.
And it tastes just like sugarcoated sugar.
Right.
Because there's no yetky vitamins or minerals to spoil your fun.
Yeah.
And how does it make you feel?
Like I'm vibrating.
I'm looking for chocolate.
I'm looking for ice cream.
I'm looking for ice cream.
And mom, the love sugar shoppers too.
Because inside everybody there's a free bottle of new Flintstones Truelville Valley.
So try new super sugarcoated sugar jahari from your friends at Irresponsible Foods.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 5.62 AF.
You f-
Holy macken on.
Yeah.
This is Joe Bohr and the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the Hockey Authority, Neil God.

But love was glad in love and to give baby in the oven.
Now the one your is missing from number three.
Barely speak the word of freaking English.
That's every married man's perfect wife.
And now the line is filled, they sing in rich.
She's that for life.
I bet she wishes she were dead every time she climbs into bed.
With the billion man who has lifted cat hair.
Oh, don't don't don't.
All right.
But with all that money I guess she always came.
Absolutely.
11.45, 15-dolloni.
I keep thinking about this thing.
It's like stuck in my crawl, whatever my crawl is.
I don't know what a crawl is.
It's stuck there.
Right by your gizzard.
And I recall saying when we first were probably having the hootspotter
giving us promo to put this on here to like compete with us with ourselves.
I would be super.
Remember when Clarence was booking guests for Stubox when he was on the other station.
He was on Fox or whichever one he was on.
No, I don't remember.
Yes you do, of course.
Our program director was booking guests for the competition because he's his boyfriend from UM.
So I would be surprised probably next week will be running.
In fact, maybe we'll be running promos tomorrow.
Oh, the dolphin game has been rescheduled for tomorrow.
And I wish we were still waiting to hear about that by the way the kids are sitting again.
But if it is, we'll be running promos.
Oh, it's been switched over to Friday nights and be sure to tune in the 790 attention such a time.
Tear Joe and Jimmy and all those other glam.
I heard we're very wide audio on our stream.
Yeah, that's that's an hell of a good idea.
Joe, there you go.
There's your chance.
In fact, wouldn't surprise me if that happens by noon.
Anybody listening online, we want to apologize profusely for the unbelievable insensitivity and slack in the face.
What you got from that was parents' idea by the way.
Duff made sure to put in a little mention that.
He's always getting his ass off the hook.
Well, not always.
I don't like it.
Anyway, oh, police briefing next few hours in the Vatali murder case.
I have no idea who that is or what that's all about.
Oh, that's not that there isn't a Rosenstein guy.
I think I don't know on this.
Horowitz?
Whatever.
Oh, police.
You people, let's see it.
And you need a life.
You need to help.
You're crazy people.
Nobody knows who that is.
For a minute, I thought it was Dick Vitale got murdered.
Maybe there were a lot.
Then we had to look at a party.
Who?
Dick Vitale asked Josh there.
He'll tell you.
Yeah, baby.
Hey, baby.
Oh, baby.
Maybe the most obnoxious person on the face of the globe.
Oh, thank you for calling Dick Vitale's hot sex life.
Yeah, that's the one.
626 votes, a little off our feed.
I apologize for the fact that she was really gone in the pits now.
I'm not getting any of my stuff here.
Very important stuff.
Senators reject Myers replies to questions.
Important stuff.
Robyn, let me discuss reporter information.
UN fails to stop sex abuse by peace troops.
Sequence evasions and classified reports of Newsweek, which is really a hell of a fly opener.
Second, Cheney Aid Cooperity and League probe.
All of this stuff, a rest ward issued for Tom Delay.
They're going to book him, Dano.
Film roles as troops burned dead in Afghanistan.
They were burning the Taliban.
Mother refused to tossing three kids into the bay and stand for Tham Francisco.
And Donizia covered up bird flu outbreak.
For two years, there was maniacs there in Southeast Asia.
Crazy.
But a little bit like that.
They covered it up long enough so could start spreading to other countries not over the world because well, it's sorry, back for business, whatever.
Just like the SARS thing, same thing was going on over there.
Michael Jackson called for jury service, Homeland Security, it's just more than I can handle.
15th is covert action from Pompein.com.
Ridesmaids ripped off at two weddings.
That's probably a story that everybody's sitting on.
An attack on American girl dolls by the right wingers.
I'm going to put that right on top of my pile, okay?
Because speaking of that 1930 business with the movies, the Hayes Autos.
Yeah.
The Hayes Commission.
I wonder if Gabby Hayes was involved in that.
Purple Hayes.
Did I read the thing about FEMA?
Why didn't you get to that yet?
No, you're all so diagnosed with narcolepsy.
I've got stories that will tickle your tonsils man.
That will tickle your inner zitle.
Make new hair grow inside your body.
Correct.
Go over the inside of your body and protect you from all sorts of disease.
Because when you got them long follicles in your colon man,
it's pretty interesting what's rolling through your colon and how it's rolling.
Pretty hairy.
In fact, some people might even be bowling in your colon.
Sometimes it feels like that, isn't it?
That does.
Maybe the righty meal.
Maybe the nuns are bowling.
Anyway, FEMA officials said boss ignored warnings.
I'm still, yeah, I can't begin to convey to you.
It may sound, maybe I'm nitpicking and some people, wow, what's a big deal?
It is a big deal because it's insensitive and it's rudeness obnoxious.
Look, it's only a big deal if you care about the audience and the radiation.
Yeah, right.
And we're tired of being treated on this show like, you know, we don't deserve it.
We've been curing this thing on our ass for like the last almost eight years now.
And every chance they get to do it with us, they do it.
Every single chance.
Oh, well, we got a press conference.
I wouldn't be surprised if we got a press conference with Reverend Jones.
I'd rather at least that might be funny to put on the ear.
Somebody might tune in for that.
Especially if we can, he got shot by his boyfriend, maybe by us.
Whatever.
We're going to really dick find, dick find, that's our buddy at top of the pro.
Not sure if he confused with Joe find, but that would really be a bunch of it.
That would be bad.
Anyway, can I get to the story or what?
No, it's just, it's just not right.
That's all it was done badly like they always do things.
And then OG Neel's really upset.
I can't imagine why.
And about a thousand people online are pretty PO2.
How do you like that?
All over the country, all over the world.
From pillar to post and coast to coast.
From the North Pole to Antarctica.
How do you like that?
Duff.
You quizzling, you invasille.
You fare anyway.
Top FEMA agency officials did not respond to repeated warnings that the situation in the world
was growing dire in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
The first FEMA official to arrive in the city said today,
Marty Bahamunday, or is that Bahamunday?
Don't you enjoy Bahamunday down in the keys?
That's my favorite.
Would you be buffet?
Marty Bahamunday, regional director of FEMA, told a Senate panel investigating the government's responsibly the disaster.
And that's the operative word.
But after the storm hit August 29, he gave regular updates to them, FEMA director, downtown Mickey Brownie.
On the worst in situation at the super dome or many of the evacuaries were shouted,
medical care was lacking, and so are basic needs such as food, water, and toilet paper,
just like that you'll end the end, which by the way they're getting the toilet paper.
Bahamunday said,
that's another story I got to get to, they're getting the toilet paper, and I bet you we had a lot of people sleep with us about that all night long.
Right.
I told them that the super dome conditions were deplorable, that we definitely needed food and water.
Bahamunday said in testimony the Senate Homeland Security panel,
I believe that the time and still believe today that I was confirming the worst case scenario that everyone always had talked about regarding New Orleans.
His testimony contradicts Brownie, who was said he didn't learn the conditions until days later,
and that local officials were most responsible for these sluggish response,
you quizzling, you lying sack of crap.
I say, let's hire Mickey, a downtown Brownie Brown, when he's too collecting his 147 grand year from the government.
Let's hire him to be in management of QAM.
He fit in like a rubber glove in Uranus.
Man is he pathetic.
Brownie, my ass, what I heard.
635 votes on a poll.
That's way way off our usual phenomenal number.
You see that? See how we've been throwing off our course today?
I do.
We'll be lucky to get 636 the way the show is going out.
And it's my bad for allowing these idiots to, I shouldn't just ignore it.
You know what I mean?
I'll show you a front.
That's the part that bothers me.
You would have said a fit apart. You would have said no way, don't do that. You would have pitched a fit up front.
No.
If they would have said upfront so that we could alert the people listening online,
then it wouldn't have been good.
At least that would have been like showing a little consideration for the audience.
But why do we want to do that?
Why do we want to do that?
Because we just expect, like with a sponsor, to just give us the money.
But a lot of these spots in here and all these dropouts, is that just me or what's that all about?
That's not just you.
Is that the audio fault, acting up? Is that the spots are bad? Is it the...
Yeah.
And all kinds of crap.
All of those things.
And all you sponsors out there, when that bill comes, just pay it.
Okay, don't we ask any questions? Did it get on the air?
Was it like cutting in and out? Did the audience understand what you're trying to pedal?
Did you get your money's worth? We don't care about that.
Just give us the F in money, okay? That's the Q&A and don't forget it.
No wonder Berkeley couldn't sell her ass.
Oh man.
Couldn't sell her left cheek for 50 cents.
Speaking of that, an attack on American girl, editor-il in the Madison Capitol Times.
This is just...
This epitomizes what's happening in America, speaking of the Hayes Commission.
We are just taking huge...
The Flat Earth Society's taken over now in America.
When they're not attacking Harry and Myers, the President's nominee,
the Supreme Court, for being insufficiently biased, or at least insufficiently public about her biases,
right wingers are going after American girl.
Some of the largest radical-right organizations in the nation are threatening to launch a boycott against the American girl line of dolls,
which got its start of the Madison area in his not successful subsidiary of the Mattel Toy Company.
It's swell if it's Mattel. And if you don't like it, go to hell.
Conservative activists groups don't like an American girl campaign that directs proceeds from the sales of popular...
I can't risk bands to support girls' ink.
A national nonprofit organization that describes its mission as inspiring girls to be strong, smart, and bold.
With roots going back to the 1860s, girls' ink serves up roughly 800,000 girls a year, most of whom are from low-income families.
The group helps these girls, many of whom are African-American and Hispanic, improve their skills in math and science,
get involved in athletics and develop leadership skills.
Our philosophy is that women should have the right to make decisions for themselves to enjoy its rich president of girls' ink. What a horrible concept.
According to the Mississippi-based American Family Association, that's American Family-A-S Association,
one of the largest, fanatical, right-wing, nut job religious groups in the country,
helping girls to be strong, smart, and bold translates into pro-abortion pro-lesbian advocacy.
American Family Association is urging its members to fresh American girl to stop supporting girls' ink,
while the Chicago-based pro-life action-lig is threatening both a boycott of merciless girls' products
and picketing outside American girls' stores in Chicago and New York. How do you like that?
The group's gone American girl to stop aiding girls' ink until the organization gets rid of an advocacy page on its website
that says girls have a right to have access to contraception, and that girls' dealing with issues of sexual orientation
can be respected and supported. All these good religions don't all respect them and support them and support them.
Burn them, burn them, burn them. Burn them at the stake.
Or maybe take them out for a good stake.
The American girl on the dolls are motivated to book a attempt to inspire girls to grow up smart, strong, and bold.
These values and ideals have been appreciated by parents across the political spectrum, at least until now.
It's clear these conservative groups aren't scared simply by a position described on a website.
What scares them is the notion that strong, smart, and bold women and girls not going to have control over their bodies, their careers, and their lives.
Girls' ink sounds like a perfect partner for the American girl line.
Hopefully, Mattel will not bother the pressure from the arrogant headline-grabbing moralists who are always looking for a way to impose their warp-world view on the rest of us.
That is the best line that sums it up in a nutshell.
Headline-arrogant headline-grabbing moralists who are always looking for a way to impose their warp-world view on the rest of us.
Go to South Carolina, go into the hills, crawl up into the tree with your banjo, and do whatever you want.
Leave the rest of us alone, please.
This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.69.

Take care!
Christian values are what you say, and your promise to remember me is they're writing here.
Christian has got a hold on you, waiting for this instant cash-sale of prison.
Oh, you're an unethical bomb!
Yeah!
Whoa!
With no answer on, no one can save you down the lake you are dead.
God find a love, but you take no blame.
You give repositions to play-layin'
Loving play their pride and the love to change.
You give cash in to play-layin'
Loving play their pride and the love to change.

We just don't know what we want to be.
Do we want to be a sports station? Do we want to be a yuck in a fun-of-game station?
We don't know what we want. Speaking of all over the place?
Yes, George's in out in there.
Oh no, he's in here. I'm just breaking the hang-called and said,
he wanted us to break that the dolphin game is tomorrow at 7.
All right, Humber, nice going!
A hammer! And I'm sure he's about to hammer, but not the same hammer.
The dolphin game will be tomorrow and I went in since 70, do you say?
That's right. I wasn't paying any attention.
Thanks a lot, Humber.
Well, wait until he finds out that they put that streamed that thing on our website.
He's going to be fine. He's probably coming in punch-regnant mouth tomorrow.
That's incredible to me.
Yeah, well, he's already suffered the wrath of the Humber knows about the wrath of the Marlins organization.
We thought that it might temper a little bit once John Henry and that crowd of Barbison left town.
It went up to Boston, but no!
No! And guess what, Marlin organization?
There ain't going to be no stadium, okay?
No taxpayer money is going to build you a billionaires of stadium.
Sorry. Bye-bye.
So, speaking of time delay, so the dolphin game is going to be at 7 o'clock tomorrow.
We broke that story. We headed first.
Just there? I believe so.
Thanks to Hank Goldberg who had to be treated with a hell of a lot more respect on this radio station, okay?
Especially by management instead of using him like a big fat whipping boy all the time.
P-valley him all over the place.
He barks the wrong flavor. You're suspended.
If he looked at SCRUANN around with a cross-eyed, you're suspended.
Man.
They've headed in for him. I don't know for how long.
Before we came there, but boy, certainly since we've been there.
What a kid.
They've headed in for the big man.
And of course, they have it in for us, which goes without saying.
And of course-
Oh, boy, boy.
I guess the only one they don't have it in for is the mad dog.
Yes. He'll do something.
Please, please, that tomorrow morning show Hank that the thing, please.
Let's show it to him.
Pretty pleased.
And the video-
He'll put him in a good mood before the numbers come out.
A Texas court issued a warrant yesterday for a former House Majority Leader, Tom Delay,
to appear for booking.
We're likely to face the fingerprinting and photo munchot he had hoped to avoid.
Oh, I can't wait to see this.
Bale was initially set at 10, grand as a routine step before his first court appearance on conspiracy and money laundering charges.
Travis County Court officials said Delay was ordered to appear at the Fort Bend County Court.
A.J.L. for booking.
Maybe Dr. Ben Dover will be there to examine him at Fort Bend.
The warrant was a matter of routine and bottle be posted, delay attorney Dic DeGurren said.
The lawyer declined to say when Delay would surrender to authorities but said the lawmaker would make his first court appearance tomorrow morning.
The charges against the Texas Republican, while we know about that, he's charged with this.
But the effort had major political consequences.
First, by helping Republicans take control of the Texas Legislature in the 2002 elections.
That's his illegal activities.
The legislature then re-druke Congressional bond, re-secor into a delay inspired plan, took him out of the state's U.S. House delegation and helped the GOP retain its U.S. House majority.
All through his skulls are going to be on your legal behavior.
Okay?
Other Democrats were sitting back and ruling over his usual, saying, hey, do it again.
684 votes.
We better get a lot more names than this poll. That's the problem.
I don't think I took one call last hour, so whipped up into a frenzy.
I think so.
Do we take any calls last hour? I don't believe so.
684, and the poll question, who is your all-time favorite American?
Not the greatest American, not the most talented American, not the best violinist like Yasha Hyphids.
Who's your all-time favorite American? Not the favorite, not the best cellist like Yo-Yo Ma.
Yo-Mama.
Bill Clinton, 144. No, they say Yo-Yo Ma.
Is what they've been seeing now.
Yo-Yo.
Bill Clinton, 144. Ben Franklin, 72. Look at the way Bubba's way out in front, man.
He's got a huge lead.
Just like we're going to have tomorrow when numbers come in.
No thanks to certain management people.
Okay, wimpy, wimpy, oh man, scared of their own shadow people.
Like that.
Pop had Genko. Look what we've got.
Hey, Duff, you're fairy.
Bill Clinton, 144. Ben Franklin, 72. JFK 61.
Who have near 51? Thomas Jefferson, 51.
I'm getting an email right now. But I'm not being from there all it's not.
Jefferson, 51. FDR 46. Ablink in 41. Rani. Ragan, 31.
He was sure smooth, wasn't he?
He's an old smoothie. That's what Nancy said.
Albert Einstein and Tom Edison, 23, a piece. Good combo there.
What would be it done without them?
Well, maybe without Einstein, we would have had the bomb.
Mark 20, 20, Elvis 17, Al Goldstein 16, a giant in the porn industry.
George Washington 16, you know, the fly I think about the fact I don't think I've ever seen those porn movies that he actually performed in.
Oh, you haven't seen that, have you?
One, but he didn't. It's not what you think.
Oh, he was in it but he wasn't doing it.
Oh, goodness.
We're just like George Washington 16, Tiger, Al Goldstein, both fathers of our country.
Teddy Roosevelt 12, Thomas Payne 12, George W. Bush 12, Reverend Jones is God seven.
I might have to change my vote and reconsider.
Muhammad Ali, six, Walt Disney five, Sakajwiyah has five.
What?
Merlin Monroe five, Steve Perry four, Bob Hope four, Dr. Ruth four, Alfred Kinsey three, Rush Limbaugh has got three.
Out of six, 94, almost 700.
No, we're a little off. We're not going to get anywhere near a thousand a day and we know what we don't want to.
We know a lot of thousand.
We're going to a thousand today. I'm leaving.
Let's see. Here's one. Oh, yeah. Here's one from LA.
Somebody faxes from Los Angeles. Thanks for joisting the audience clearance.
Didn't it occur to you that some of us listening on the internet aren't in Florida?
Thank you God. What a bunch of crap.
Yeah, that's right. Most of the people listening on the internet, there are some in town who might actually have diaries
and listen to them because they get a better reception online.
And then there are people all over the country who don't give a flying crap about them. Marlins.
Okay, they care about all the intense hysterical stuff I'm talking about, which is not sports.
That's why they're listening. Okay.
Now, maybe they only think they do care about in Florida is Hurricane Wilma because they're worried about whether we're all going to get blown away or whatever is going on with that.
Maybe they don't even care about that. And they're entitled. They got their own earthquake and mudslides to worry about.
Clarence, see, this is what happens when you hand the keys to the kingdom over a silly little sports nerd kid from UM, man.
Another hurricane. You think that Wilma's a hurricane. We got to worry about the hurricane. We got to worry about is in the Gables.
That's what we got to worry about. Maybe black Gable or whatever that is. Car Gable.
Jesus. He is so. I mean, he is. Let me say it again. He is the programming. Remember what I said to Hank about Joyce.
Clarence is the programming this radio station. What Harriet Myers is to the Supreme Court.
He is so far over his head. He is drowning in a sea of an attitude. I'll tell you what.
Why don't you go over across the street and join your boyfriend's new guts over there Clarence. You'd be an excellent pair.
You can both of your guests. I don't even know if he's got a show. Does he do a show? He does a show with Dan Levittard.
He does the lavash to show and he's supposed to be the general manager. Wait a minute. I want you to run them by me again. Maybe I can understand.
Maybe we got a bad connection here when I'm in. The general manager of the radio station always with his rich stride.
Does a show on the radio with Dan Levittard? That's correct. Is that when you just told me? I just told you.
You have to be smittenly, man. That would be like Greg Reed doing a show with the maid on. Well, excuse me. I don't want to compare it with maid on Dan Levittard.
That is absolutely a chocken. Yeah, that's the air. She was going to like people.
Man, Stu got my ass. Does he? No. Does he got it in the box? Yeah, or in a chart? What's in the box? It's a big fat ass. It's not connected anything. It's just an ass.
Secret. Do I have time to do this? This is news we think this is very long and it's really good stuff. We could pick up. We could read it on our website tomorrow because I'm sure that. Oh, yeah, I got this story too. I'll do this one first because this is short. This is cute.
Got a short without that prisoner. Sue's God. Sounds like a lawsuit. Greg a Romanian prisoner. We're suing God for failing to save him from the devil. Maybe we ought to sue God for not saving us from bush. You think? I think there's a case.
The inmate named is Pavel M in media reports accused God of cheating abuse and traffic of influence. Excellent. I'm on an I'm on like a sign on that. His complaint reads I the understand Pavel M currently jailed Timisio so our penitentiary serving a 20 year sentence for murder request legal action against God resident in heaven and represented here by the Romanian Orthodox Church for committing the following crimes cheating concealment abuse against people's interest taking broads and traffic of influence.
The inmate argue that his baptism was a contract between him and God who was supposed to keep the devil away and keep him out of trouble. He had a God even claimed and received from me various goods and prayers and exchanged for forgiveness in the promise that I be rid of problems and have a better life. But on the contrary, I was left in the devil's hands. How do you like that? I mentioned Marty Brodure could probably come is right with this guy.
The complaint was sent to the Timisor court of just Timisaurus court of justice and for the prosecutor's office. The prosecutor said it would probably be dropped and they were unable to subpoena God to go to court.
He's got bigger face to fry. He's got to set the odds of this weekend ballgame and of course with the Dalton Kansas singing tomorrow night now at seven o'clock. He's got a really a get up to it. In fact, if God hops to a real big them, I have another earthquake somewhere. Maybe that's what was going on. Maybe God was hot to and maybe God was hop singing it. You think? Remember hop sing? I do. What was that? Was that on the Danza? God spoke or the Danza. I think you're wrong. I think he was a good. You're right. Huh? I think you're right. It was but it was boy. You Lauren Green is rolling over in his grave and Dan Blocker. I think you're right. I think you're right. It was but it was boy. You Lauren Green is rolling over in his grave and Dan Blocker. I think you're right. I think you're right. It was but it was boy. You Lauren Green is rolling over in
and you will give him who else was on that. He was busy eating the bark. Michael Aydis bark was worse than poor Michael Landon. Where's the guy? Did you know that he was Jewish? Yeah. He was another one who was and he was like all these different religions. I think that's why little house on the prairie never mentioned Jesus and any of the preacher serving. That's right. I remember that biography. I saw that which is law third and Andy Williams. I want to take it back. I really didn't watch that. I guess you did. I didn't watch that. That's embarrassing. You love his music. Who's that?
Michael Landon? Yeah. He actually didn't put an album out I believe. Everybody puts everybody's on TV. He puts an album out. Don't they? That's Eddie Murphy put an album out. Yeah. You know that was I'm not really so sure what was the low point Eddie Murphy's career is when he got caught in a car with that transsexual or whatever it was or when he was making those records and thinking that he really could sing. He was like the full runner to Will Smith. He was the dude that thought he could like he was funny and he could sing all of these things. He was no Chris Rock. I'll take it back.
No. But then who is? Yeah. We love Chris Rock a lot. Oh look at this. This Taliban fighters. Oh yeah. We got that story coming. Okay. Just relax. Just relax there at the Pentagon. Okay. We got that. We're all over it. Like stink on Greg. Like stink on clearance. Oh excuse me for redundancy. Okay. Because stink in clearance. It's a synonymous. If you look up stink in the dictionary you'll see clearances. Push right next to it. Hey. When you think about mattresses you think of a silly posture.

Sunday morning in Southeast Florida they say residents on the Southeast Coast of Florida could be
in feeling tropical storm force winds by Sunday morning of co-ordination of Hurricane
Center Director Max Mayfield and his briefing of 11 through two this morning they could
understand that the Sun Central, what he was saying because he was like, well, what he's doing
is that I'm a straight team now he's just a mumbler. Maybe that makes him a little bit hunger by
being a mumbler you think. They feel emphasized the importance of focusing on the wind field rather
than the exact location of Wilma Center because Hurricane Winds extend 90 miles and tropical
storm winds reach 260 miles from the center. I agree as a Florida from Tampa to the Florida
Keys are still in danger from the storm Mayfield said whatever that means. There is danger
looking everywhere. Oh my god. All under the bed the boogie man is coming.
Blind up a big fat one. We'll let you know all I want to come out.
Chris, if you'd like him a big fat one and the SWAT team will come in and just blow your
head off a scale in the house. That's right. I'm talking about a scale the way your drugs
on. We're talking about like a bathroom scale or a fish scale. A fish scale would be good?
Yeah. Like the one that you scrape off the side of a bass.
Anyway 750 votes you know I'm telling you right now don't overdo it on this poll because if we
get a thousand votes today we might just come back and terrorize you again tomorrow.
Especially with those numbers. Well terrorized Joel. I hate to admit this but I'll tell you
right now. Yeah. At this moment I am much less concerned about I'm starting to get like a
management which is very scary thing because I don't want to be in any way connected with those
but I don't care that much about what we do. I just want to see them do really really bad.
Oh I don't know. Because from everything that we're hearing and man I'll tell you you talk about
you talk about a sieve. The inferred inside info from that joint is leaking out like water through
a sieve through a through a cheese cloth. Man. There is some serious consternation and
constipation going on in that place. So we're just we're just because we would do anything to
hurt them. I don't think about it. Joel was right about that. That's the first thing he's ever
said that was right. We'll do anything to trample them to stop on them and by the way Joe Rose
hates you not us Joel. Uh-huh believe me. I heard it right from the horses ass. Hate you.
Wish you would die a wicked death and of course this arrogant thing. Well the host and our station
they can attack each other but not me. We don't play that game over here. Right. Because you're a
big shot man. You're Mr. Ha Ha Chot. Big potatoes. 752 votes. Who is your all-time favorite American

But not lucky to have be on our pull with 13 votes.
You know what I'm saying?
Here's the fastest. Please add the next president to your pull, Al Gore.
Okay?
Got no problem with that. He's butched up a lot.
Got that. And built up a lot too.
So how about putting Al Gore 08.com as a link on your website?
No.
I mean, that would be fun with me if he was a candidate.
I think he kicked some serious ass.
He kicked John McCain's ass sideways to from here to where the moon.
Plus John McCain's got that, you know, those cheeks.
Yeah.
When you got cheeks like that, Matt, and I got a story here.
I'm going to read it down here, but take still midnight.
Good.
Joseph came in from thecomandream.org.
Jim Loeb from the Interpress Service writes,
Powell a blast, rice, chaney, rumsfeld, cabal.
Never miss cabal? Oh, that's right.
As top officials in the White House and vice president,
Dick Taney's office weighed possible criminal diamonds for their efforts to
destroy the da whistleblower.
A top aid to former secretary, state colon, Powell,
yesterday accused a cabal led by Taney and Don Rumsfeld of hijacking
US foreign policy by circumventing or ignoring formal decision-making channels,
like Channel 467 and 10.
Lawrence Wilkerson, who served as policy for staff from 2001 to 5,
and when Powell was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff at the US Armed Forces
during the administration of George Herbert Walker Bush, that's Bush 41,
also charged as national security adviser.
Condoleezza was part of the problem by not ensuring that the policymaking
process was open to all relevant participants.
In some cases, there was real dysfunctionality, said Wilkerson,
who spoke of the New America Foundation of Prominent Washington Think Tank,
but in most cases, she rice made a decision that she would side with the president
to build her intimacy with the president.
The case that I saw for four years plus, he said,
was the case that I have never seen in my studies of aberrations,
basheredizations, and perturbations in the national security policymaking process.
He said, I'm not sure we can even say some of those words.
What I saw was a cabal between the vice president of the U.S. Dick Cheney
and the Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on critical issues that made decisions
that the bureaucracy didn't even know was being made.
Wilkerson also stressed that the extremely powerful influence of what he called
the Oval Office Cabal of Cheney in Rumsfeld, both former secretaries of defense
for longstanding personal and professional relationship,
adding that both members of the military industrial complex that former president
Eisenhower warned the nation against in a 61-fair-will-address,
don't you think that they aren't among us today in a concentration of power
that's just unparalleled, he asked.
That's what Eisenhower said, and he was right.
One of the few things he said that made sense, all he had a lot of interest.
Wilkerson's remarks came as the administration's VCs
by record-low approval ratings and anticipation that a special prosecutor
will hand down indictments to top aides of both Bush and training,
including Bush's political advisor, Carl Rowe,
and Cheney's chief of staff, Iluas Scooter-Libby,
a connection with efforts to discredit which had ambassador Joseph Wilson.
This is very long.
In July 2003, Wilson publicly challenged the administration's
people-oriented picture of Iraq's alleged nuclear weapons program,
and especially its assertion that Baghdad had talked about
your rating yellowcake from these years,
and assertion that Wilson is self-investigated and rejected
in early 2002 after traveling to these years as part of a CIA mission.
White House officials, including Rowe and Libby Total reporters
had Wilson's wife worked for the CIA and played a role in selecting him for the mission.
On Wednesday, Capitol Hill was wife of the rumors that Cheney himself may also be indicted
or resigned over the scandal that were given more credence by an anecdote
that Powell had told a prominent Republican senator that Cheney had become fixated
on a relationship between Wilson and his wife, Valerie Plame,
after he and Bush learned about it directly from Powell.
Since his departure from the administration, Powell has declined to publicly
criticize US policy or his former cabinet colleagues until now Wilkerson
is also a keptist counsel, although he publicly opposed John Bolton's confirmation
as he went ambassador.
At that time, most analysts believed that Wilkerson reflected Powell's
private views on Bolton.
That would not be surprising as Wilkerson worked directly with or for Powell
for some 16 years out of their 30-
Not 30 minutes!
...to your military and government careers.
At the same time, Wilkerson said he had paid a high cost in his personal relationship
with Powell for publicly speaking up.
Wilkerson embodies Powell and Powell's deputy director of the Secretary of State, Richard Armadage,
who is also a retired military officer, Steve Clemens, who has organized
Wilkerson's NAF appearance tool, IPS.
That's how his remarks should be seen.
If so, it appears that Powell and Armadage have little but disdain
for Rice's performance as National Security Advisor, although Wilkerson was more
complimentary about a work of the State Department and a relative success he's
enjoyed in steering US policy and a less confrontational direction
compared to the frustrations that Doug Powell, he attributed her success to several factors,
including your intimacy with the President and the fact that the administration
filed itself in some fairly desperate straits politically and otherwise.
Most of his remarks, however, high ever, had directly described as
National Security Policymaking Apparatist that was made dysfunctional by secrecy,
compartmentalization and distress as well as the machinations of the
Cheney-Remesfeld Cabal.
Oh, I'm going to interrupt right there and put a thing and ask to risk a bookmark
at Thumbtack.
Yeah, Thumbtack, a thing.
I'm going to stick a thing in it because I've got to do the break.
And I'm not going to go rushing to Russia to the rest, you know what I'm saying?
What the hell?
Russian is in Kami Pinkle.
Kami Nista, Kami Nista, it's really.
Thank you.
Hey, grow up some of you people.
Wait a minute, please.
Are they going to grow up now?
At least brush your teeth.
790, 690.
You know something?
I hate to say this, but I think they're playing with us again today.
I think we're going to get close to a thousand.
We don't even want to.
Please don't get us a thousand both because then we'll come back again tomorrow.
We'll give the powers to be a chance to screw with our Internet streaming again tomorrow.
I think if I live to be a hundred, I'll never get over that.
I'll pulle and inekly that was done.
That could have been a piece of cake, you know?
Act like a bench.
Act like a bench.
Come in.
Give us the straight load on it.
Let us give us the info that heads up so we can pass it out of the audience.
Those people who are just desperately trying to hear the show all over the freaking world.
People in Saudi Arabia.
People over there out.
So Sam is listening in Afghanistan.
Right on the packy board of there.
In this cave.
Some of them forced slupers from the earthquake over there trying to hear it on the Internet.
Jesus, God and Joseph, man, the lack of...
And you want to know why they don't understand anything about this show.
They haven't got a clue.
They wouldn't know the show if you stuffed the whole four hours into their ear,
or they call the U-station tube.
You know what I'm saying?
Shoo!
Yeah, that one.
Or some, or maybe some other.
Shoo!
Or this station tube.
Is that what they call it?
When you're less than a QAM, our station tube.
Sports the Amulacote.
This floor is number one Asian Dwarmey buffet.
That's not just Neel's opinion.
That's as rated by Zagat Restaurant Review and they really know their stuff.
Now every Friday through Sunday night, you can still enjoy lobster fest.
They dream they lobster served thermidor style.
And every single night is pet fest night at the Amulacote with the last and snow crab legs.
Dungeon is crab and Jonas Stone crabs.
You know what they don't have on the spot anymore, Ajahn?
But you ought to just mention it once.
Some of that delicious...
See you.
Yeah, of all kinds, which you'll find there.
The menu is still in my field, like you're being left out.
The menu still includes fresh oysters on a half-cell and a sushi bar with over 30...
About 30, man!
...of different items.
Looking back at you.
The Amulacote also served New York steaks.
Delicious juicy steaks cooked to order just the way you love them.
And even hand-carb primed rib.
And all kinds of a fantastic Oriental and other delights.
And for dessert, leave room for Amulacote famous 40-inch...
Chocolate fountain.
It will leave you spellbound.
You can hand-dip your own strawberries, marshmallows, dip all kinds of decadent treats in there and just go nuts.
Don't forget the Amulacote was healthy living cooking all their fine cuisine only...
With cholesterol-free cannolo oil, no MSD, no cornstarch, no headaches, no crab.
Just a big, fat, full stomach when you walk out of there after a tremendous feast.
So book your reservations this weekend at one of Amulacote's real locations.
You'll find them in sunrise, sunny hours, beach and pepper pies.
For the Amulacote, 954-572-3822.
Before Wilma blows everybody away, have a fantastic final feast at the Amulacote Chinese buffet.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 5'16-18".
Oh, I come from trial protectors with a guitar on my knee while they died in the lazy add-up.
I race cascadilly to be open.
Oh, cut, three-not, don't put no blame on me.
Let the come from my vacation for a photo opportunity.
Swing your partner round and round.
Now do a little swim into an oralist down.
Swing to the left, to the right, here we go.
Swing a little mud up, there we go.
Oh, cut, three-not, why didn't those people flee?
This person will leave the Amulacote and it gets more Iraqi.
Oh!
I'm tired of the hair.
Oh, shiqnoor, the city of New Orleans.
That's a bullet.
Yes, some of those people down there say he failed.
Stuffs the people in the astradone like cattle.
While half the national guard was in Iraq.
He's up funding for their levies, looters causing anarchy.
In the room we made a bigger deal.
In search for Natalie Holloway, the one white girl we drained a lake.
And even asked for help from the Navy Seals.
George Bush was vacationing in Crawford, Dufairing.
I guess next year they'll be no Marty Grum.
Girls gone wild needs, the city of New Orleans.
Or they'll have to send their film to Far Without.
Okay, 1240, let's get back to this.
It's very important, which I'm sure it's putting people into a coma too bad.
It's a heavy duty stuff, man.
I'm freaking riveted.
Well, Wilkinson, what's his name is, Wilkerson says you've got this collegiality there between the secretive defense and the vice president.
And then you've got a president who's not versed in international relations and not too much interested in them either.
And so if not too difficult to make decisions in this, what I call the Oval Office Cabal.
And the decisions often that are the opposite of what you thought were made in the formal decision making process.
Why did we wait three years to talk to the North Koreans?
Why did we wait four years plus to at least back the EU-3 approach to Iran he asked?
The formal process camouflaged the efficiency of the secret decision making process so we got into Iraq.
And then when the bureaucracy was presented with those decisions and carried them out, it was printed as evident and such a disjointed and credible way.
Incredible.
Incredible.
That the bureaucracy often didn't know what it was doing as a movie carry them out.
He said, if you're not prepared to stop the feuding elements in the bureaucracy as they carry out your decisions, you're according disaster, he said.
And I would say that we courted a disaster in Iraq, in North Korea, and in Iran.
Wilkerson was especially skating about the formal undersecretary defense for policy, Douglas Fights, citing Tom and General Tommy Frank's famous description of the Neo-Conservative Idealogue,
as the Epping Stupidest Guy on the planet.
Let me testify to that, he said he was.
Sell them in my life if I made a dumb or man.
And then after the Pentagon has given control at least in the immediate post-war period in Iraq, that this man is put in charge.
Not only is he put in charge, he's given carte blanche to tell the State Department to go, screw themselves in a closet somewhere,
that's telling you how the decisions were made and how things got accomplished.
He also did this is great. He also denounced the abuse of the Tainese and St. Paul's especially upset by it.
Ten years from now, when we have the whole story, we're going to be ashamed, he said, this is not us, this is not the way we do business.
I don't think in our history we've ever had a presidential involvement, a secretary involvement, a vice presidential involvement, and a attorney general's involvement,
in telling our troops essentially, carte blanche is the way you should feel.
You shouldn't have any crimes because this is a different kind of conflict.
You don't have this kind of pervasive attitude out there unless you condoned it he added, and in that it'll take years to reverse the situation within the military.
He said it was a concrete example of the result of the way the cabal worked.
Wilkerson also contrasted Bush's diplomacy very unfavorably with his fathers.
Referring to Bush's first meeting with South Korean President Kim Da-Jung, Wilkerson noted, when you put up your feet on a hasake,
and look at the man who's won the Nobel Prize, who's currently President of South Korea, and tell him in a very insulting way that you don't agree with his assessment of what's necessary to be reconciled with the North,
that's not diplomacy, that's cowboyism.
It's very different when you walk in and find something you can be magnanimous about, that you can give him, that you can say he or she gets credit, that's diplomacy.
You don't say I'm the big mother on the block, and everybody who's not with me is against me, that's the big difference between father and son.
At the same time Bush had been wonderful in putting his foot down against the more aggressive policy on North Korea, and one point saying,
quote, in Wilkerson, I don't want to war on the Korean Peninsula.
That was very helpful Wilkerson said it helped us fight off some less desirable results.
Cheney, he said, was a good executive as defense secretary under George Herbert Walker, 41 Bush, but appeared to change his result of the 9-11 attacks.
I think he saw 9-11 in the potential for another 9-11 with nuclear weapons, and so it became so fixated on that problem that it skewed as approach workers and said adding that neither he nor Rumsfeld could be considered neo-conservatives.
On Iraq, he said he was guardedly optimistic because we may have reached the poor where actually listening to Iraqis, US troops will likely have to remain there for five to eight years, he said, however, because it's a strategic thing in the sense that Vietnam was not.
He predicted that a precipitous withdrawal without leaving something behind we can trust, we will mobilize this nation with five million women under arms to go back and take the Middle East within a decade through the US's dependence on the region's energy sources.
He disclosed that the department's policy plan, we were at a discussion about actually mounting an operation to take the oil fields in the Middle East, internationalize them under some sort of UN trusteeship, and administer the revenues in the oil accordingly.
What did I tell you about hooking up that? That's what it's all about. Here's the latest on Wilma Sunday morning. Here's the latest on Hurricane Wilma.
We're just going with 230 token on this long, Augusting at 280.
This is CNN, right? That's why he's got 20 miles for our Augusting at 180 and still pushing some.
What means he would know when it would work for the both hands?
In fact, to continue to strengthen, in fact, in 24 hours, it could get back into kind of a group of five.
Hurricane studies, so of course, we're going to keep you updated about the system.
I think of the English, baby. Come on.
What you're up with, please.
I was already were seeing some very strong swallows and also it has affected thoughts on the Caribbean.
Why am I putting that on?
Every time I'm in Europe and I watch them internationally, put these silly people on, they're talking about anything that has to do with North American weather.
They don't even know where to find these places on the map.
Pointing like a Guatemalan saying, well, in Canada today, it's a, you know, it's a clue.
So I'm sorry.
Oh, and speaking of a...
Chew!
A lot of stories about that.
Guantanamo hunger strikers say feeding Chew!
Employers torture.
We've got some heavy, heavy duty stuff here today and we wasted a whole hour because our program director and operations manager
are busy with their head up the Marlon organizations ass.
Okay? We're not even assing us.
And then they have me promote.
I still can't get over that. That's the ultimate stipend of race, you know.
Yeah, have me promote our own counter whatever that was.
That was really something.
Nice job there, deaf pull them over my eyes any years.
That's like making people dig their own grave before you're shooting.
Yeah, that's exactly right. Dig your own freaking grave.
Yes. Prisoners on hunger strike at the US Prison Camp at Gitmo reported troops forced them with dirty feeding Chew!
That have been violently inserted and withdrawn as punishment said declassified notes released yesterday by defense lawyers.
The repeated removal and insertion of the...
Chew!
Has cost striking prisoners to vomit blood and experience intense pain they've equated with torture.
The lawyers reported to us a US federal judge after visiting their clients at the Basin-E student Cuba.
Prisoners said they were taunted by troops who said the treatment was intended to persuade them to end the hunger strike that began August 9th.
The lawyers wrote an affidavit's part of a lawsuit filed in federal court Washington seeking greater access to prisoners at the high level.
The law has been executed by security jail for terror suspects.
Lieutenant Colonel Jeremy Martin, a real shul and military spokesperson for the Gitmo detention center, said all the Tainese non-gristiric are closed and monitored by medical personnel and mistreatment is not tolerated.
Though we did not know this specific procedure was for handling the feeding Chew!
Gitmo officials have said this late this hunger strike began with 70-60 Tainese protesting against their confinement.
The defense lawyers have said that other reasons as well are putting complaints about food and water, alleged abuse by guards and interrogators, and they decided to either face trial or be released.
Oh, release, don't hold your breath.
House Jose Padilla, do you mind if I still run around with that suitcase?
U.S.F. Al-Sari, 21 of Saudi Arabia, told his lawyers guards removed a nasal feeding Chew from one prisoner and re-insured it into another without cleaning it first.
Oh, God only knows where this stick in those Chew!
Welcome!
Ah, these large Chew were viewed by the Tainese as obvious torture lawyer Julia Tahrber, who's from represents Tense.
She's a woman, maybe she's a fool yet, she might be.
Represents Tense, out of the Tainese in an affidavit.
They were forcibly shoved up to detain these noses, none of their stomachs.
Well, let's get a hold of our watcher name.
The governor of FedEx, governor of his daughter.
Oh, I thought you meant Terry Shagler.
No, not too late for her, but what about her?
The man has governor of his daughter.
I'm sure she still got that tube laid around.
Yeah, she's got something up her nose. I guarantee you that.
What?
How are you going, honey?
What an outstanding, classy family, man.
The first family of Florida.
We're going to make 1,000 votes of it, and I'm pretty appealed about it.
Nice going, folks. You're doing it.
Oh, I shouldn't say that then they'll stop voting.
There should have a lot more names on here, but I just, you know, I just still got a lot of stuff here, you know?
It's not as important as...
Well, you're all rubber and drones, there's 15.
You know, not important as that.
It's right in there.
833 votes.
We're just right about where we were yesterday when we clipped St.Thousand Mark, weren't we Josh?
Yeah.
Yeah, we did right about almost the same.
And that's in spite of the fact that we got screwed over bed.
We got man-whe handled and abused.
Talk about torture.
Our program director and operations manager for about a half.
I wasn't about 35 minutes.
Right, 30 minutes.
Very fair on that.
At least half...
About 30 minutes.
Yank your cube.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 5.62.8.

Hey!
It's right to be the W.
Stay down, sir.
But you're all gonna scare the fast you've earned.
Oh, my God.
Even after a catch-back would be a huge with all the phone.
But my sister's back with a million.
There's information they don't want you to know.
So the fear factor keeps you under control.
Don't, don't, don't.
Wake some confusion's what they're in.
You, we go to the holy public night.
We've got the Indian to the day of the whole zoo.
You're sharing the zoo.
In the very jail of all the Sadduh.
That's not something you'll see under news.
We're thousand only public night.
We've got the Indian to the day of the whole zoo.
We are a nation of global cheats.
Everybody simple chimera party.
Everybody's with them under two.
We stole the holy public night.
Everybody out of the blue.
One to be run like crazy, honey.
It's a 101.
Wouldn't you also in Marnie?
That was another outfit in his god movie.
Marnie? You ever saw Marnie?
I don't think so.
Well, there's one for me to go out and buy for it.
Because I can't find North by Northwest.
Marnie.
There we go.
There we go.
Tipea, look at that.
Google it.

847 votes on the pool.
I don't know what happened here.
All of a sudden, man, there's like a big spurred from this audience.
I think that they, oh, there's your fat ass governor.
They're devastating.
Yeah, you're devastating.
All right.

And the Florida Peninsula.
But they're just sitting around somewhere in a warehouse.
Where are they?
Where are they?
It's too early to specify how strong Wilma.
Yeah, we know how strong she is.
In fact, she's probably done everybody in town.
Out of the I-4 corridor.
And in the key, she'd prepare for the possibility of the case of her.
You don't know what it's like.
You haven't got any more.
And you're talking to me.
And I do.
And to me, but a boot friend of us and the folks living in the Southwest Florida.
Many, I'm sure, will compare this storm to Hurricane Charlie and think, well, perhaps
it's very strong.
It's very strong.
It's strong as storm as Hurricane Charlie.
So therefore, we don't have to worry about it as much you do.
Every story about it will be able to be a great bit about it.
But the possibility of storm shortage, which did not.
It's very strong.
Oh, my God.
It's really is a very real threat to you.
And people need to do what they have been doing in our state.
Okay.
Enough for another him.
Boy, he did.
I just see him in my blood boils.
I'd rather have wild hysterical, sweaty sex with Maddie Bell than see your fat ass
coming.
How do you like that?
I like it.
And I'd rather be dead as a doormy old before I would even look at Maddie Bell naked.
What a thought that is.
God.
I'd rather step on him first.
840-70, you look up Barney with this thing.
Yeah, it looks very interesting.
Barney is a nice, cold, habitual thief.
He uses her looks to gain the confidence of employers.
Sounds like a typical woman to me.
He applies for a job.
Marries a guy.
He tries to help her.
Can't wait to see how it turns out.
I'll get it for you.
I'll tell you one thing.
If I went on 30 million on the 649, a lot of Saturday night, remember the Beatles song,
you won't see me.
You won't see me anyway, but especially.
Well, we've got you something.
We'll get your pick for a little one.
I said a little something, something.
All right.
Who is your all-time favorite American?
Is there a pull question?
Let's put Johnny Carson on there.
Okay.
I'm thinking of like icons, you know, TV icons.
Oh, I better not do that icon thing because I think you're an icon thing for the moral.
Is that going to be too close to this?
That's what you told me.
What?
That is too close?
No.
You know that you had an icon thing for a month.
Well, it's a variety.
You did a pull on the top 100 icons of all time of the last century.
I don't know.
It's not, well, we'll give it a shot.
I don't know what the hell do I care whether it's too much at play.
Don't get picky now with this pull stuff.
Okay.
Take whatever we give you.
The price is right.
Have fun with it.
Enjoy it.
It's swear at it.
850.
We got our real serious shot at 1,000 by two o'clock.
And if we do get to 1,000, then we all get to take the next two months off.
Yeah.
Let Greg come on to show just like Stu Goss is on it with Dan LaBeire.
I still can't get over that.
He's General Manager.
He's on a stupid ass radio show.
I think he's the program director.
No, he is not.
The program director was that the Jeff Sorenson, what was his name?
Well, I don't know.
Huh?
Josh knows Jason Saladkin or something like, no, that's not it.
What is it?
I don't know.
You know what I'm talking about.
Now he was the general manager, man, because his dad, he's got a lot of money.
He's a sports expert.
He's a maven.
I thought Joel was the general manager.
No Joel is the owner.
He's the principal.
He's the old daddy is the owner.
He's the face man.
He's going to have a long face.
It'll be like a horse at the bar.
You know, wide along face.
That's what he's going to have.
Gonna have a head that's a six feet.
Huh?
Guess who's playing the husband in Marty.
Jimmy Stewart.
No, Jimmy, I clue.
Paul Ray.
Who?
John Gale.
John Cata, he was in there.
Yeah, he's the husband.
That's right.
I guess I'm going to buy and watch it in the Nelson.
I haven't seen it in so long.
And also I haven't seen, I don't think I actually did see the one I was on before.
We were talking about before the show that I found a one of my seven million channels.
Do you want to go with West?
No, no.
Oh, Vertigo, you said.
Vertigo.
Vertigo was a vertigo.
I don't think I ever did see that.
That's also Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak.
Yes.
Didn't see it.
I watched most of the movies.
I watched a movie by now that I made a few bucks last night.
Eight hundred and fifty four votes on your Bill Clinton's got 166, Ben Franklin, 85.
I mean, nobody can touch Bobbie, Submonica.
So what was I saying before about our first bull like a president Clinton, Hillary or
Condoleezza?
Either or.
The thought of Condoleezza as president.
I mean, everybody, this thing, that article I just read you, that should be emblazoned
in your brain.
Yeah.
She's a knitwood and an income poop.
Oh, but Dr. Rice knew you can't say, yeah, right.
A simple thing.
A secretary of state, my ass.
He makes your fat ass governor look like Albert Einstein.
Visual for fairness.
I have the chance to talk to you.
Yeah, good.
Hope you had a good chat.
And by the way, Noel would like some more to blow.
Bill Clinton, 166, Ben Franklin, 85.
JFK 75, Hugh Heppner, 66.
Thomas Jefferson, 59.
Our third president who used to do the slave women, the dark slave ladies and enjoyed it.
Loved it.
See, one thing about him, you couldn't say he was a racist.
That's right.
FDR 51, who was Abe Lincoln 50, Ronnie Reagan 38, Albert Einstein 28.
Tom Edison 28.
I still like the way that those two are tied.
Oh, they should be obviously much.
I mean, the idea that they're behind Reagan, right?
Then Einstein, Edison, are behind Ronnie Reagan?
Come on you people.
What are you thinking about?
God.
Mark 2026, George Washington 22, Al Goldstein 20, Elvis 20, same person.
Only the hair has been changed.
My ham and all these 17 Thomas paint 16.
In fact, when Elvis was porken up there and it was a tight Vegas outfits that were about
to burst open.
Remember that?
Please.
He was going to look porcup a little bit like L.
It's sweaty and greasy.
Oh boy.
My ham and all these 17 Thomas paint 16, George W. Bush 15, Reverend Jones 14.
Well, Neil, I'm very pleased to see that.
Oh, Tony Roosevelt 14.
Walt Disney 8 and 8 and 8.
Marilyn Monroe 7.
Oh, no, wait a minute.
The name of the mouse was Mortimer Mouse.
Okay.
You know that?
Which mouse?
Mickey.
That was his name when he first drew it and his wife told him, that's in sound of
it, Mickey Mouse.
She's the one that came up with Mickey Mouse.
Well, how do you like that?
She must have only sailed to the Department of QIM.
And all in that pool we had the other day.
Remember that one about the, what best to minimize as America's celebration of mediocrity?
I'm thinking we left off the most obvious one as QA management because we don't want
to strive for excellence.
We don't want to do things well.
We just want to schlock our way through life.
You know, just schlock our way through and to grab whatever tradeouts we can and grab
all the glory and the ego, all of a sudden crap.
There are people who strive for excellence and really try to do a good job.
And they're just those people who show up and go through the motions.
They put the motion in your cansket and they do the kill you.
Teddy Roosevelt and Reverend Jones are tied 14 and piece I see it from end of similarity.
They're both killers.
Walt Disney 8, Marilyn Monroe 7 speaking of killed.
Bob Hope 6.
Sakajuea has got five.
I have, I still, she was an engine broad.
She was the Indian scout that helped Lewis and Clark along their expedition.
They would have failed and starved and been killed without her.
Now was that Lewis Scooter Libby in Dick Clark?
The same.
Dr. Ruth 5, Steve Perry 4, Alfred Kinsey 4, Marshall Limbaugh 4.
For example, he's got a pair Johnny Carson 1, Al Gore and Marlon Brando out of 862.
Both so far and not doing well.
This one I recently, but they're got the big one.
Oh, not doing good.
Okay, moving along.
Is it okay if I get all these in here by two o'clock?
Okay.
I know I just, I'm sorry.
I could take some more of these great calls.
WQAM, hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
I mean, I mean, I mean, WQAM, hello.
Thomas Edison was just a big jerk in a phony.
I don't even know why he's up on that list.
What does that mean?
He stole most of his ideas from Nicola Tesla and Marconi.
He stole his ideas from Rusty Klesla.
No, Nicola Tesla.
Rusty Klesla, man, oh, man, I reckon still something from him.
Place for the Columbus to straight jacket.
Get out of here.
Stole his ideas.
Next, you're going to be telling me that the, what's his name?
George Eastman stole patents, too, which you did.
You know, the Eastman House and Rochester.
Go there someday when you're really bored.
When you run your last legs.
Sorry, I'm going to be on heroin in those days.
Second, Cheney A, Cooperating and League Probe,
those close to K.C.
A second A, device president Dick Cheney is cooperating
with the special prosecutor's pro-wredding of Valerie Plain.
Those close to the investigations say,
this is from therawstory.com.
And they don't come any rar than this.
Late Monday, several sources familiar with
special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald Probe said,
John Hannah, a key A, the Dick Cheney,
and one of the architects of Iraq war,
was cooperating with the, you know, that wig thing
that White House or Iraq group, that's going to be just like creep.
The committee would be like the president.
They're going to hang that around their neck like an albatross
given by Stanley Dancer, by the way.
And Harry Harvey.
John Hannah was cooperating with Fitzgerald,
I've been told he was identified by witnesses as a co-conspirator
in the league.
Oh my God.
Sources said Hannah was not given immunity,
but was likely offered a deal in exchange for information
that could result in indictments of K.W. White House officials.
Now, those close to the investigations say,
a second Cheney A, David Wormser.
As the Worm is churning man, Wormser,
it kind of sounds like Mumser.
They must be talking about Cheney when they're saying Mumser.
David Wormser is agreed to provide the prosecution with evidence
that the league was accorded and accorded
and therefore by Cheney's office
to discredit the agent's husband.
As if there's any doubt, right?
There has been former ambassador Joe Wilson.
We know more than the most folk of critics
to the war in Iraq and all the lies
and the yellow cake or all that stuff.
Although maybe he likes him that tomato soup cake
that Grace used to make on passions.
Wormser, Cheney's Middle East advisor and assistant
to then undersecretary state firms control
and international security affairs, John Bolton,
likely cooperated because he faced criminal charges
for his role in leaking Wilson's name
on the orders of high-rups those sources said.
You put him these dots together?
I am.
Let's die.
According to those familiar with the case,
Wormser was in attendance at several meetings
of the White House Iraq group Wig.
There it is again, say a little non-cabal
of administration hawks that formed in August 2002
to publicize the threat posed by Saddam Hussein
that they were creating, fabricating,
making up and bellishing, et cetera.
Those who say they reviewed documents
obtained in the provostate that the vice president
was also present at some of the group's meetings.
Wormser, of course, in return to call seeking comment.
The sources say that Hannah and Wormser were given orders
by senior officials in Cheney's office
in June 2003 to leak claims covert status
and identity in an attempt to muzzle Joe Wilson.
Is there any question?
Does take a rocket sign
is to put these pieces together, okay?
There is a girlfriend on CNN.
I can see.
Tara, all right, Bonnie, we'll continue to check in.
Thanks so much.
You may recall the tool.
I don't know whether, bro.
It's a different one.
She's got more tracks on air than what's his name?
Hannah and his arm in the movie that you saw again.
Jared.
Jared, Jared Lido.
Oh, that's right.
Jared had the purple.
He had the purple hay in the purple blotch.
That's right.
Don't shoot in that, dear.
Oh, Jim, the source to say Hannah and Wormser
were given orders to leak the name.
The former ambassador had been a thorn
in the administration's sites in May 2003
when he began public questioning claims
that a wreck was an imminent threat to the US
and its neighbors in the Middle East.
He was another one of those whistleblowers.
He called the public there for lies.
The public don't want to listen to Joseph Wilson
or Richard Clark or Paul O'Neill or Scott Ritter
or Hans Blitzer.
Anybody else who tells the truth?
No, they want to listen to a bunch of Neocon lunatics,
a bunch of crazy people, the P-N-AC crowd,
including your fat ass governor, by the way.
8.74, what do you say?
Competence higher low.
I think we're gonna do it easy.
Okay, do it!
Oh, I'm telling you one thing.
We're not playing that David Samsung drop in today
because those Marlon people really crossed my ass.
You see they had to pacify them
because I'm wearing a Marlon station.
So what's the big deal about it?
Okay, we had the story on her yesterday.
The Humber broke the story yesterday
and also I broke the news today
about the dolphin game being put on tomorrow at seven o'clock
instead of Sunday at one.
So what we need to put some silly ass pressure,
who now wants to hear Joe Gerardi?
You know, he's got a boring guy.
He's okay.
You never stole a freight train, Joe.
We wish you all the best, but go away.
Go away until a spring training.
8.81, oh, it's gonna be a lot of fun.
We're gonna hit a thousand.
The numbers are gonna come out tomorrow morning at 11.
30, we're gonna kick some serious ass.
Joe is gonna be throwing every piece of furniture
against the wall.
That's okay, Joe, just heave it.
Just heave it, baby.
Daddy can afford to buy new.
Followed Pop Little Boy.
Crash O'Rechors for this, for the first time anywhere,
a fabulous two record collection of pop music
greatest centaurers like Pop, the turner over drive.
I'm a brave, brave, brave, brave, brave, brave,
the incomparable David Boy.
To James, yeah.
The greatest names in pop music,
centauring and centauring,
their way to the top is as one amazing record opera in the home.
You're bound up.
You're no game.
Those Jackson.
You're no game.
Prince.
No, no, no.
Three generations of great centaurers and centaurers.
And if you're back now,
Pop, O'Rechors will throw in a fabulous collection of pop
runs and runs, which James Brown.
Daddy Roger, that's the guitar.
What's the name of it?
If you try to buy me from here,
come and leave with your way.
You can only get a from Pop, O'Rechors and Brown,
plus the first and the second.
From Pop, O'Rechors, where we say,
if you'll buy this, you'll buy anything.
That's what we say.
I got one for the full Lenny Bruce.
Okay.
How about Gary Bruce?
Okay?
No.
I'm not going to do that.
I'm going to do different pull for tomorrow
because it's too similar.
And I'm going to, you know,
oh, Jamie, we just did that yesterday.
Can't we have a new play toy today?
Come on.
Okay.
We'll save that for next week one day.
That's the thing about icons.
How about Carl icon?
Who?
I know you don't do sports on the shows as a fact here.
That is absolutely and by the way,
are we ever pleased about that or what?
Thank God.
20 hours of sports crap is enough every day.
Man, it's about 18 hours too much.
Or as little as possible.
You are absolutely correct about that.
Absolutely correct.
You know, I'm your list.
There was a very good choice.
But there are a few others to,
and are you right?
Babe Ruth ought to be on there.
No?
Sure. What are you?
Joe DiMaggio.
Can you say so?
Mickey Mantle.
Okay.
Am I going too fast?
No. He says,
Willie Mays.
Willie what?
How about Billy Mays?
The guy that does those awful obnoxious commercials on TV.
Hi, this is Billy Mays for Oxy.
Whatever it is.
No, Willie Mays.
Michael Jordan.
Michael Michael motorcycle.
Frank Mahavallet.
That's where Kennedy and sorry.
Will Chamberlain.
Are you getting all these?
And he's got some golf people.
We're not for golf or OJ.
OJ is not going on.
If OJ is your favorite, by the way,
is after October 1,
I need to look personally to come to your house
and make sure we don't have to put up with your crap anymore.
If you want to vote for OJ.
In fact, if you want to vote for OJ,
you're hired at QIM.
Joe says, I think the alarm strong should be on there.
And why not?
In place of rest of them,
I don't have to be in place of anybody.
He can be on their addition too.
Joe just relax.
You got any alarm strong?
Who do you know?
And while we're at it,
how about Lance Armstrong?
Armstrong, Joe says,
not only for his accomplishments,
but for being an atheist.
Well, he's, everybody's talking about Lance Armstrong
these days, the point of nauseam is a matter of fact.
Sure.
So this, obviously, Joe is obsessed
with people named Armstrong.
What about George Armstrong?
It's Heath.
Oh, that's right, he was Canadian, eh?
What about Armstrong?
No, no, no, no, no,
he would know George Armstrong from George Rodriguez.
I'll say that right now,
if he looked in the mirror,
he would know George Armstrong.
Chief.
Number 10.
George Armstrong, so a custard?
For Stanley Cubs, baby.
Used to think was a function of bad luck.
Say there you go, there's Bill Waters on there.
Hey, who's some weight, Bill?
You and Joe Bowen, man,
your legend's a giant in the industry.
Joe is great.
Bill, he's okay.
Well, who's this?
Upturs.
And I specifically asked them,
can you send a helicopter out of a location
where I had been told?
Oh, this is Marty by the money.
That's great, my water.
But I had no idea if they were actually there.
There was just a report that they were.
You go, Marty.
And I wanted the coast guard to fly out there
to actually see and let me know
that that's where some food was.
The coast guard did fly out there, confirmed it,
landed, cut open the trucks
because there were no drivers left
with those trucks.
They were just dropped at a location.
They opened the drivers and started to put food
and water into their helicopter
and deliver to the superdo.
If that didn't happen,
there wasn't going to be any food there Tuesday night.
The moment I sent an email to the Secretary Michael Brown
Wednesday morning that week saying,
quote, sir, I know that you know the situation
is past critical.
Here are some things you might not know.
Hotels are kicking people out,
thousands gathering in the streets
with no food or water,
hundreds still being rescued from homes,
the dying patients at the DMAT tent being met effect.
Estimates are many will die within hours.
In his response, hours later,
he was forwarded this email
from Brown's press secretary,
Matt and Rouge.
Quote, it's important that time is allowed
for Mr. Brown to eat dinner,
even that that in Rouge is getting back
to normal restaurants are getting busy.
He needs much more than 20 or 30 minutes.
He's going to eat dinner.
He's going to eat dinner.
Just tell her that I just ate an MRE
and went to the bathroom in the hallway of the superdom
along with 30,000 other close friends.
So I can understand her concern about busy restaurants.
No, this one went to the bathroom as it went.
So serious senators are trying to find out
this morning why there was this massive disconnect
connected by apparently no one was willing or able
to listen to the one man they put on the ground.
I'm glad you like that.
I'm sure an arrogant Jackass who is more important
on these people were like an averted death.
People in nursing homes were like seconds from dying
and we had to wait for Brown to have his dinner
because there were backups in the restaurant.
Go and look for a boy.
They're doing a boy.
Heck of a job, Brownie.
Heck of a job.
You know something, what did I tell you a few weeks ago?
And I tell you to think,
deck of cards was all crumbling down.
Let's hope it.
Yeah, you can smell it.
Oh man.
June Allison is doing a hell of a land office
business at the White House.
They're changing under where every 30 seconds right now.
About 30 minutes right.
Now how are we doing on this pool?
See, I shouldn't have opened up a mouth.
It's only 899.
I don't know.
It's hard to figure these people inside a finger.
Is I just when it was this huge Oh 902.
We need 98 votes in 35 minutes.
It's about three just like yesterday.
It's the same story again.
They're going to drag us through this every day.
They're playing with our emotions just like your program
directing your operations.
Man, you did earlier in the show.
If you missed that boy, you're lucky.
You had enough to worry about with Wilma
and with the bird flu and all these other damn things
to worry about.
So just don't worry about them.
We'll take care of them.
Like I said, pop a jenko.
Look what we got.
Oh, brother.
The brain trust, the brain drain.
Firm rolls and film rolls as troops burn dead.
Oh no, this is in the Sydney morning here.
Remember I love Sydney?
Yes.
He died in the Atoni Randall.
I think it did.
Well, that's because he had too many babies
when he was 90 years old.
Not good.
Waste a lot energy there, Atoni.
You, US soldiers, but Jack Oya Kludman,
he's still alive, don't he?
I think so.
US soldiers in Afghanistan
hurt the bodies of dead Taliban
and counter their opponents about the corpses
in an active deeply offensive to Muslims
and in breach of the Geneva Conventions.
And investigations by SPS's Dateline program
to be aired last night, filmed the a burning of the bodies.
Well, this is an asteroid anyway.
You wouldn't have seen it.
What's SPS?
Not also that one.
That's one of their networks, I guess.
It is also filmed a US Army psychological operations unit
broadcasting a message.
A boasting of the bird corpses into a village
believed to be a harboring Taliban.
According to an SPS translation of the message,
delivered in the local language,
the soldiers accused Taliban fighters near Kandahar
of being cowardly dogs.
You allowed your fighters to be laid down,
facing west and burnt.
You were too scared to retrieve their bodies.
This just proves you are the lady-boys.
We always believed you to be the message reportedly said.
You attack and run away like women.
You call yourself Taliban,
but you're disgraced to the Muslim religion
and you bring shame upon your family.
Come and fight like men instead of the cowardly dogs you are.
The burning of a body is a deep insult to Muslims.
Islam requires burial within 24 hours.
Under the Geneva Conventions,
the burial of Hordec should be honorable
and if possible, according to the rights of the religion
to which the deceased belonged.
US soldiers said they burnt the bodies for hygiene reasons,
but two reporters, Stephen Dupont,
who I wonder if he's really the Donald Dupont,
and John Martincus said the explanation was unbelievable.
How do you like that?
Given they were in an isolated area,
SPS, at Australian Special Forces in Afghanistan,
were operating from the same bases US soldiers
in the middle of the incident,
although no Australian took part in the action.
The incident is reminiscent of the psychological
techniques used in Iraq's.
Abu Ghar-e-Rabh-Persian.
This goes on and on and on.
And we're supposed to be worried about Hyman Rosenthal,
whatever that guy's name is.
What is his name again?
The Tally, the guy whose wife got killed there.
The one at the Rosenberg shorts.
What is it?
Whatever.
Yasha Haifens, 27 past one at five, 60 WQAM.
Thank you.
Yes.
There's two new Dupont.
In that far-wind's car.
The new Dupont has its main eye.
Can tell you it's the worst remake of all.
Yezy Duke's curse.
And she would be.
Tell me how to Jessica since and get her own movie deal.
Movie's today.
They make my plot point his foul.
Ain't got no plot no more, but they're really loud.
I love the old youth forward.
We're back when I was a kid.
Only wood takes my river and shows
and turns the men to fast.
Hey man, 133.
So let's see, Marty.
What's the other one?
North and Northwest.
Vertigo.
Vertigo.
917 votes.
We need 83 in 27 minutes.
Just over 3 a minute.
I don't know.
Is it?
You could do it.
83.
27 times 3 is what?
81.
Yeah, he says so.
I'm really good with those numbers, man.
Really good.
Anyway, let's get with it.
Okay, speaking of numbers, the ratings this summer rating book
comes out tomorrow morning at 11.30.
And I will guarantee you.
I'm not going to have to be people just glued to their radio.
Is there going to have their ear, lip-paged glued right to that radio?
They're going to have that crazy glue right on it.
Am I right?
You know it.
A lot of people, a lot of great trepidation before that book comes out.
I mean to us, it's like, you know, I want to enjoy the reliability.
We'll say, hey, look, I did it again.
And, you know, and great.
I'll say, hey, I sure.
921 votes, man.
Let's hop on it.
Now, don't bring us right to the edges success here.
We reach out almost to our finger on the grass ring on that wonderful thing.
And then they pull it right away.
They ink it away, you know?
It's like that.
Speaking of that, did not mention Susan Smith yesterday.
It must have been my psychic abilities again kicking in.
We're kicking it old school, baby.
Ancient school on a show.
Ancient on this station.
We're old and we're happy about it.
How do you like that, Joel?
We're all 100 years old.
Old Jews, man.
We're hairy.
We're old.
Hairy, uh, from the neck down.
And to them.
We're still going to kick your ass.
Well, they're hippo-renda, younger and cooler.
But, remember that call?
That set of call.
One of the most incredible set up phony calls.
Well, Donald Basterd is younger.
Yeah, right.
Donald Basterd couldn't lick Jim Manage's butt, okay?
He's not the same.
To put him in the same category with a mad dog would be like putting a high-name manouche
in the same category with water, Krunkite.
And I don't even remember who the hell a high-name manouche was.
A woman who was hearing voices tossed her three young children off appear in the San Francisco Bay Authority said.
Rescueers had found one body in the other two children were feared to date.
The mother, LaShan Harris, 23 of Oakland, was booked on three counts of murder.
These San Francisco Chronicle reports into these papers.
Her children were identified as Trashan Harris six.
For VanTay Greeley, three, and Joshua Harris won.
How come for VanTay's got a different last name?
Oh, don't answer.
A child's body was found about four hours after witness reported single woman dropped the children into the bay.
Near peer seven Wednesday said Jonathan Gera of the U.S. Coast Guard.
What if he's kind to Randy Gera who used to play for his base for the Ahoracans?
Remember that?
Nope.
No.
The San Francisco Examiner reported today that the body of the three-year-old had been recovered.
While rescue research for the children, the empty stroller was visible on the pier.
A small inflatable Coast Guard boat was hugging the water fed as rescuers used handheld flashlights to search under the pier.
Larger Coast Guard and San Francisco police boats were searching the water with high-powered flashlights.
Mayor Gavin Newsom came to the scene to get briefed by authorities with only fellow reporters.
I'm sick to my stomach before leaving and two canons left.
LaShan Harris told authorities that voices had told her to throw her children into the water to chronicle reporting.
It wasn't immediately normal that she had an attorney.
She had been staying with her children at a Salvation Army Shelter in Oakland, Mary Ann Ramirez, the Social Services Manager of the Shelter Told Chronicle.
I just talked to her yesterday Ramirez said, we had our usual how you do and how's the kids.
I never would have guessed in a million years that today she would do that.
Yes, the incident happened in the Embarcadero area which draws touristy historic ferry building, Dufari.
With view of cold tower in the landmark Trans-America Pyramid.
The fishing pier offers use of San Francisco, the bay bridge shifts into bay as well as Tristan.
I don't know, I guess voices told her to take those three kids and he went to water.
Hey, if it's good enough for the authors of the Bible, there you go.
The Lord told her to do it.
Here at the very religious.
In fact, who the hell was I seeing on the other, oh, what's his name?
Franklin Grant.
The BLT, the BTK.
The BTK killer that we knew nothing about.
And they had to think about him on biography channel or on A&E, one of those.
I love those channels. I know you don't.
I do love them. What do you talk about?
I do.
But anyway, I wonder what this is.
I see a 16 year old bro, a resident that case that hurls with, I mean, don't care.
We don't care.
And we don't want to see her up close ever again on my set.
I will blow the screen. I want to guess who's on the phone.
I'm boys and I'm whisper.
You and whisper.
Thank you, friend.
You're a good post for Nancy Grayson.
I want you to like cancer. She's everywhere.
She's just like cancer.
We need an instant.
Forget about bird flu.
We need a worldwide project to eliminate Nancy Grayson.
Anyway, what do we got?
936. I don't know.
Are you refreshing it?
Yeah, open up the webpage.
What do you got?
938.
62 and 22 minutes.
That's a little under 3 now.
We're making a little progress.
These people are, they are really playing us like a fiddle, you know what?
A fiddle.
What's the difference between a violin and a fiddle?
I guess a fiddle is smaller, right?
No. They're exactly the same.
One is for country and the other one's a 9.
I see.
It's a country folk.
They play the fiddle.
They like to fiddle around.
That's what I heard.
Especially in Nashville.
You're just going to love Nashville.
All of the people in Nashville, like the New Yorkers and Jews, you know?
940.
We need 60 votes and 20 minutes.
You should be able to do that.
Folks, hop on it.
Both for some of these people who have no votes yet for crying out loud.
I mean, you sent them in, right?
Al Gore, Marlon Rally, made some of them up.
Neal Armstrong, George Armstrong.
Punch him like Bob Pouford.
Let's go.
Senators reject Myers replies to questions.
All that Harriet she's in deep, deep due to man.
Don't let me forget during this break.
I got to check on her and see if the two o'clock advisory is on her on Wilma.
All right. Don't forget.
And Fred.
The Supreme Court nominee and Varnie Robel.
The Supreme Court nomination of Harriet Myers already troubled by a lack of enthusiasm on Capitol Hill right.
And in a more rough ground yesterday, when Senators from both parties rejected her responses to a questionnaire as in?
Sufficient.
How do you like that?
A little bit of an appointment.
Sufficient.
That was pretty good.
Senators, you this year, a committee chairman Arlen Specter in the panel,
stopped Democrat Patrick Leahy of Vermont.
Complained that her answers were at best and complete at best.
Leahy said some lawmakers considered them insulting.
And that's managed to resubmit answers to some of the questions, especially those about her work in the White House as counsel to President Bush.
Senator Leahy and I took a look at it and agreed it was insufficient.
And I'll send you back a detail that are asking for application of many, many amplification.
Many, many of the items Specter said at news conference.
It was the latest problem for Myers for that Dike and the White House had a nomination that attracted much criticism and mostly lukewarm support.
How's Luke doing, by the way, even from the President's most ardent backers?
Specter said it was too soon to say Myers was in trouble, but he described her nomination processes chaotic and said it was being further confused by backdoor messages from the White House,
intended to reassure conservative leaders, some of whom went public about those discussions about what she would be like as a judge.
What I'm referring to are all of the forces which are workout here, commanding media attention and commanding public attention Specter said.
There's been more controversy before this, Dominique's uttered a formal word that I've ever heard.
What a turd.
He and Leahy asked their colleagues to withhold judgment until I've removed the confirmation hearing schedule to begin November 7th.
Morningline odds on her being confirmed 99,000 to one against.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 516 QAS.
The White House and somebody to his studio, they said he'd get paid if he pledged Bush's plans on the radio.
The White OLA pay all up.
They walked up to him offered to 40 grand.
Just been a few lives in an envelope there was pay all up.
The White OLA pay all up.
Absolutely.
The White OLA pay all up.
The White OLA pay all up.
The White OLA pay all up.
Okay, 145.
I'm just looking under to see if the two o'clock advisory on Wilma's on here and ask me if it is.
Is it other?
Not yet.
Any minute now though.
Although we do have a little bit more about your dolphin game and of course the dolphins are taken on a Kansas City cheese.
That could be really, really ugly if Kansas City shows up.
But like all the other teams in league, sometimes they show up this year and sometimes they don't.
The dolphin game originally scheduled for a Sunday against Kansas City has been moved to tomorrow nights,
Friday night at 7 o'clock at Dolphins Joe Robby P.P. Park Stadium as South Florida gears up for Hurricane Wilma, the Hurricanes.
An NFL spokesman confirmed the change in the schedule.
TV broadcast information will be announced any minute now and the course the game will be on TV.
The dolphins in CBS said this afternoon the game was to be broadcast by CBS and of course is the game sold out.
I guess it does make a difference, right?
Right.
It says it's unclear what fans will tickets but are unable to attend the game following the change will be able to do relative to refunds or rain checks.
See, that's the problem.
As in the past we recognized unusual circumstances and will address them appropriately on a case by case basis.
Dolphins Enterprise and CE Joe Bailey said in a statement released by the team.
The game has moved ostensibly to allow emergency personnel to be working a home game in fans in South Florida to prepare for Wilma,
which is expected to flow to sometimes Sunday, maybe early Monday ostensibly.
Now why don't they say that?
That's a Jason Cole right in there in the hair of, hey Jason, a little sarcasm there like you don't believe the word of your dolphin organization.
Shame on you.
What's wrong with you?
This move marks the third straight year and fifth time in the past five scenes it often has changed a contest date, time or venue.
We know about the other things.
Wildfire is forced to move in Miami's game with San Diego de Arizona one day after the original kickoff date.
The dolphins and games that have been moved are three and three.
Oh, they only wished that they're going to be three and three this year.
Trust me, ain't going to happen.
Moving the game may adversely affect the ability of two key Miami players to recover from injuries,
linebacker, junior, sayal, and defensive in Jason Taylor were hoping for the maximum recovery time for the injuries.
How's that calendar coming Jason?
I'll tell you one thing you ain't no, John Schneider.
I still am amazed at as good as he looked.
I wouldn't want to have show of you to have paid me by the second back then or now or any time.
Now that's really, that says it all about how bad that show was.
That would be like if I'm trying to figure somebody,
Halle Berry was on some TV show, a weekly show, a stark naked every week.
And the show was so bad that even then you wouldn't watch it.
You understand?
Yeah.
Well, I mean, that would take a lot.
It would take a hell of a lot, but that's how bad that show was.
Dukes are hazard by ass, but they sure had some really believable character.
Yeah, like, ain't it?
Oh, brother.
Ain't it?
I beg your pardon.
Famous, ain't it?
Was that that show?
Sounds kind of heinous to me.
Okay, let's take a look.
We got 9.74.
We need 26 and 12 minutes.
It should be okay.
We should be all right there.
All right, you should drag it us right to the air center, make us sweat, make us work.
And why are you doing that on a day when we hit all I grief?
You know, I'm thinking of my stuff right now.
Because I can tell my blood pressure is just soaring today since the 11 o'clock.
The only reason I'm still alive is because I'm not there at all in that studio, in that building.
Because stress kills, especially when you got diabetes, baby.
Stress kills.
And they are these stress inflictors.
You know what I'm saying?
What do you say?
Well, you know, I don't have to tell you.
Yeah, it's a stress.
Well, George, you said there's a new medievals pretty pressed out by that.
And then their fat boy trying to throw you under the bus.
All that crap going on.
Just avoid all of that, um, a cockroach that goes on your mans, but it's pathetic.
Just tragic.
All these people trying to throw their weight around.
One, of course, when fat boy does it, then you get to get problems.
Speaking of sick things,
Indonesia covered up bird flu outbreak experts say those people in Southeast Asia,
man, they're going to kill all the rest of us before they get through.
Jakarta, Indonesia, Indonesia officials covered up and then neglected
spreading bird flu epidemic for two years until it began to sick in humans this summer,
posing a grave threat to people while being on the country's borders,
according to Indonesian and international health experts.
Just like with SARS, baby, SARS.
Unlike Southeast Asian countries, they began to see human cases almost as soon as
Indonesia had a generous head start to run outbreak among people.
Since July, it's registered more human cases than any other country,
including three deaths confirmed by international testing.
Influenza, a specialist, agreed that the actual number of human cases is higher
and expected to rise with the approach of the rainy season.
I'm going to tell you one thing.
A lot of you religious nuts out there.
Don't be nailing no chickens to the door for a while.
That's my, that's my best suggestion.
Okay. Don't be handed into your poultry too tight.
Health experts say the Indonesian epidemic started in commercial poultry farms
spread among the tens of millions of free-range chickens raised in backyards across the country,
and then finally infected people.
At each step, the Indonesian government failed to take measures that could have broken the chain
while discouraging research into the outbreak.
As a result, specialists are concerned that the cases in Indonesia pose a worldwide threat
if the bird flu virus changes and becomes contagious among humans.
If the government and I could sooner just stamp it out, there'd be no outbreak.
They wasted so much time since I rule a need-um,
the Indonesian microbiologist to first identify the virus in his country's birds.
What terrifies me is that it just won't affect Indonesia.
I don't like that. I say let's nuke him. What do you say?
Call up Rummy and Chany and let's nuke him right now before it's too late to that.
Okay, I'm going to take the break now because I want to, hopefully,
we'll have this will-and-a-stuff and Barney and Fred and this stuff is needle Rogers.
And then we've made 20 Amarlin press conference.
Excuse me, I have time.
We need 16 votes and six minutes, man.
If we don't get there, all hell is going to break loose a QA.
And believe you mean.
You can do it!
You're fair.
I've got a hunger, the size of the armors.
When I get a stock of nose, I be trusted in a hole.
But now upon the case, my life is back in place.
And so I'm singing again and singing.
My smiles in your face got a no-shape.
Brackum.
I go for Nella.
My two fans both live in Montana.
Got a no-shape like no banana.
Of my no-shape, we can have both the city of Atlanta.
I write this all.
We need 12 votes, baby.
We've got three and a half minutes, three and a half minutes and 20 seconds to do exactly this.
This is really nail-biting time.
Archibiton now?
It's over.
Like I said, this really bites 988.
You got it?
No.
Oh, well I thought the reason you dropped that in there.
Maybe you were ahead of me.
I still got 998.
Ah-ha!
It came in there in a clump.
You see that?
Just like a big dragon getting bunch of grapes or roids.
998.
I'm going to refresh it again.
I'll guarantee you we did not.
Early in the show, especially because of that crap that went out of the oven at the clock,
which we don't want to go into again, even though it was just a disgrace,
the way that that was handled.
Poorly, inniply, just totally would like consideration for us, for our audience,
for our fantastic zidians of people, all ten of money, internet, and pathetic.
Right?
Yeah.
So that really slowed us down.
So we never even dreamed that we were going to get anywhere in your 1000 votes on a very important full of thousands.
To try to hold you, and what you think.
Oh, aye!
No sweat.
This crowd, they come through.
Not on the phone necessarily.
That's a whole different crowd.
That's your crowd.
That's the people you've attracted to those fabulous appearances that you luckily stop doing so much.
Yeah, so much.
And a very good choice.
Oh.
Okay, we could have put a lot more names on here, and I'm, you know, I should probably apologize,
even though I won't, for like taking up all this time, Randy and Raving.
I enjoyed Randy and Raving because it allowed me to vent.
And with all the anger and the hysteria and angst, especially on right on the day before the book comes out,
and they got to do something epistos off.
What is wrong with you, Doug?
And clearance, you quizzlings, you idiots.
You fairies.
Who's your all-time favorite American we ask today?
Bill Clinton, 192.
There is nobody close to Bubba.
We want a back now.
We want Bubba back.
Absolutely.
Ben, I'm thinking Al Gore and Howard Dean.
How's that for a ticket?
Oh, man.
What a fantasy ticket.
I'm just thinking about.
Ben Frank, 199, JFK 77, who have their 72?
Thomas Jefferson 65, who got more action than you.
FDR 58, Abel Hicken 55, Ronnie Reagan 44.
How I'm using that is to me.
Mark 2031, Albert Einstein and Thomas Edison each have 29,
even though Thomas stole all the patents.
George Washington 27, Muhammad Ali 24, Al Gore Dean 24,
he and Muhammad Ali, man, two great Jewish guys.
Elvis 23, Thomas Payne and George W. Bush 18, apiece.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I think the Thomas Payne, I always think of W.
Right there with him, don't you?
I always put him in the same air.
Every time I think of it, good old Thomas Payne,
because George W.
There's no more of a bigger pain than that.
10 euros of L-15, Reverend Jones 14.
Well, I think so.
I say Reverend Jones for manager at the station.
Walt Disney 11, Sakajuia 10, Merleman Roy 8, Frank Zaffa 7,
good choice.
Bob Hope 6, Dr. Ruth 5, Steve Perry 4, Alfred Kinsey 4,
Rush Limbaugh 4, Johnny Carson 2, Michael Jordan 2,
Baby Ruth 1, Lance Armstrong 1, Mickey Mendel 1,
Lady Bruce 1, and Novos yet, Solomon Pezitto.
For Neil Armstrong, Wilk Chamberlain, Willie Mays,
Dick and either, Joe Demaggio Elgor,
or the now deeply loved and deeply buried Marlon Brando.
Bye, bye, bye!
