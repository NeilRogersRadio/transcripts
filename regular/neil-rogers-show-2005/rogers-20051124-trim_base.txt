That's his own sugar!
What are you gonna do in Thanksgiving, Charlie Brown?
It ain't cool being no child.
Turkey is so close to Thanksgiving.
What kind of turkey are you looking for?
A salmon.
They can do turkey!
No, no, no, no!
Dude, we need your turkey for our land!
Right, George.
Starting to eat this turkey.
My off-board brain.
What did you expect?
A turkey?
This is a birdie.
I don't like a bird.
I don't like a bird.
I don't know how to go in.
I don't know how to go in my home.
Maybe I'll let you put your tongue in my head.
I don't like my way.
I don't know how to go in my home.
I don't know how to go in my home.
And I need you to move.
Boy, I feel a Thanksgiving.
You got a Thanksgiving.
I can't cook the Thanksgiving dinner.
All I can make is cold cereal and maybe toast.
Well, I cooked the turkey.
Why do you mean you cooked the turkey?
You didn't cook me the big finale when the turkey jumped to the ring of fire.
What kind of a Thanksgiving dinner is this?
It was the Thanksgiving dinner.
Did you see that?
I'm impossibly large bird.
For all of that wood.
I love the day you're here.
These idiots that are heat frying the turkey.
They're a stir-up of the news on that last night.
Did you see that?
I did not.
And people are burning their houses down and deep frying.
Everybody's into, well, what was wrong with the old traditional way?
Just cooking the damn thing in the oven?
Or on the flavorway would be good.
Now what?
You got to get an extended.
Get the extended.
It's like a big plastic ring and you stick your ring on the thing and you can put even a big bird in there.
That would imagine it's great.
Anyway, we're not going to waste any words today.
It's Thanksgiving Day and Josh Cordis is on the other side eating donuts.
I would eat too many of those.
Spore your appetite for mom's fantastic Thanksgiving feast.
I wouldn't worry about that.
And if she's a really good cook, they'd even say.
She is?
Good.
That's all you said the other day.
Anyway, here's the poll result from yesterday.
Who's the ugliest WQM personality?
1304 votes and a Humper.
Oh no.
I just second time in the desert.
I think four years ago, maybe five years, we took this poll last time.
And a Humper keeps winning.
Nobody can touch the Humper.
Speaking of the Humper, I actually got his breakfast order from Howeys.
You just got his breakfast order from Howeys?
That's right, because you were wondering.
Yeah, I actually got it yesterday.
Oh, but you're going to be surprised.
All he gets is a coffee and an English muffin.
And an English muffin, which is all carbs.
That's not a good idea.
You see, he'd be better off getting an omelet and maybe some bacon.
He doesn't get it.
He doesn't understand the carbs thing.
And I write, that's all right.
One of these days will all be dead.
Who's the ugliest QM personality?
Hank Goldberg, 421.
Moe Howard, David at 337, who I guess is done for the week, huh?
That's right.
He's done for the week.
It said Curtis was going to fill in for him tomorrow and now the beast.
And you just hear what he said.
He's going to be filling in for Moe.
I wonder if Moe's happy about that.
But he's a little forked off about that.
Absolutely.
Anyway, Moe comes in second.
He was given Hank a little one-fourth for Wilder.
337.
Very respectable second.
The beast comes in tied for third with Joseph Gackie.
Old Weenie Puss.
139 apiece.
Yours truly, I come in fifth, 125.
I'll work on being a little uglier if that's possible.
George Rodriguez, way down.
After the top five, it's way down.
George got 47.
Gildey's got 22 votes.
Lini Martez 15.
But then again, nobody's ever seen Lini.
Orlando Wells Aquiri's got 15.
But even though he's got 15 votes, he's still rock solid.
Maggog 15.
Eddie K. 12.
Troy Stratford.
A Curtis Stevenson 6.
And three people had to co-hones the stones to move for Big Kimbobo camper.
A big, ugly guy.
Okay, we got a pool today.
What's your take on the Marlins leaving South Florida?
Not looking too good, George.
No, he's not an arcroud.
They're not like, especially considering this is your Marlins station.
228 votes.
What's your take on the Marlins?
At least they're threatening to leave.
We're leaving.
I'll pack them a sandwich, 65.
I don't care a bit, 56.
Who cares not that they've done so much talent?
They're having to make fire sale.
28 people said to hell with them.
I missed baseball somewhat.
28.
I'm pissed off 15.
They're just bluffing 14.
They'll get a stadium 11.
They can't leave.
Josh needs that job.
8.
And I'll miss them badly.
Oh, only three.
Only three.
That's pretty weak in it.
Yeah.
So in other words, the first four categories, you got like, uh, 120.
One hundred.
By almost 150, I'll turn 28 votes like, uh, bye-bye.
Go away.
Let the door hitch in the ass on the way out.
People are getting tired of it.
At any rate, we're going to play a comedy bits today all day.
You know, we could take requests.
But first of all, Josh has got a lot of food eaten there.
So he's definitely not going to answer the phone.
And I'm sure he's not.
No.
Not showing up here on Thanksgiving Day.
And secondly, we could have your facts in you, required.
Well, we could take one WQYM.
Hello.
Take a morning, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Happy Thanksgiving.
And you too.
You know, the Marlins organization is becoming just like woodbying.
Give me the money and nothing in return.
Right.
Yeah.
OK, thanks.
Well, by the way, I told you those Panthers last night, I tried.
I tried little psychological edge there.
They're going to win.
I said four to three.
And Josh goes to the game last night.
And by the end of the first period, you could have left.
That was a tragic.
I did.
I did.
You did leave after the first period?
I told you they scored three goals in a minute.
I know that.
I tried to answer the period.
I mean, I asked the coach if you want to meet a throw of a skate sound.
Maybe I could block a few shots or something.
Well, we're going to try that next home game.
We're just going to stick your ass in the net.
OK, that's it for my comments.
I said four!
Just sit back and relax and enjoy.
Rolls it.
Crying.
I said four!
Suffer.
The Holy crap.
All is one in my life.
It came out of God as me.
Now it's windy, the greatest tree.
It is buried by ice.
Someone please cover the ice.
Silent heart.
Deadly fog.
My cheeks were spread apart.
Bracket.
Silent heart.
Full of methane.
It don't smell.
I can't be pain.
Left a cloud so stinky and green.
It cleared out the dust in the deep peace.
It ran out of my bum.
Left a cloud so stinky and green.
I said a line at the cashier.
Here the one.
I was in front of you, dear.
If you don't, you lose.
I got the tamarind glue.
I'm dynamical.
All I heard today was,
Hey, that's the hell out of my way.
Get out, oh baby, get out.
I got the tamarind glue.
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
Okay, just, from me, my friend.
It's your life, it's near the end.
Oh, the queen of earth showed with magnet.
You'll get the tamarind glue.
There's a marvelous place I know.
Oh, well, the wealthy people go.
It's where royalty play follow.
And that's what I like about Voka.
A downway he goes on never small.
A downway they say, help, call.
And every corner has a ball.
And that's what I like about Voka.
Then 10 grand on Voka's piece.
And the day in Jewish favourites,
you shall taste these delicacies.
That's what I like about Voka.
But please admit you are out of the woods.
And our BMWs are a wee fine pleasure in being rude.
That's what I like about Voka.
Who'd you built the Rolex watches?
When shoes make us so much.
If your clean will let you touch us.
And that's what I like about Voka.
We really don't care what you think.
You see, our do-do doesn't stink.
There's no coffee.
And it's only Voka.
And that's what I like about Voka.
That's what I like about Voka.
That's what I like about Voka.
It's the bloodiest movie of the year.
Help!
Just in time for Thanksgiving.
It's the Texas Turkey massacre.
What can I say?
It's a turkey.
A big fat turkey.
Go!
And set your turkey free.
The Texas Turkey massacre.
Just look at the big finale with a turkey junk to the ring of fire.
Help!
Help!
Help!

Ladies and gentlemen, this is left over at number five.
Oh, thanks, giving day, everybody ate the food that was on their plate.
We had turkey with all the fixings, grandma said, feed up, cause there's lots more in the kitchen.
I had to stop, cause there was so stuff. Five plate fools was quite enough.
I had, what me, doc me, turn up some stuff in, unbutton my pants, cause my belly was bustin'.
When it was time for me to get out of there, grandma gave me the life to tough away our full of gravy potatoes.
I'll be eating all of this until Christmas.
I did a bit of stuff and you'd say, home, I found my potatoes and turkey's bone.
A little bit of hand, I'm all laughing for, better need it up before it's fuller.
So grandma's all made of signs of cheese, with some in the fridge and the best you'd be.
A little bit of yeah, and then you'll see five.
Peaks with his sandwiches till I die.
Oh, thanks.
Let's go with number five.

This Thanksgiving, Mr. Potter, what a magical concoction have you created for us?
Return to the magic.
What do you think young Aries cooked us a right for me, Lavagery, for Harry Potter?

Until he became a soap opera star

Then he quit the soap opera
And he wasn't a pop star anymore
You do the man.
He was Rick Springfield
No one was tonight a judgey star
I'm not a judgey star

So take your I want a Grammy theory
And shove it Springfield
I don't know what to say

Was because a bunch of women wanted to get in your pants

Between the skies and clouds

As if she's always surprised
She's wiggle when she's caught

We gave a score of boys
And she pushed that shell back
She's made a wild and wise

Spoiled so I sit on the pensioned array
Waiting for the lorry busted, take me away
Or you'll get to keep me on the pensioned array
With my free time
And there it is, it's about 10 times

Where's that lorry bupkin?

Look at her nose, swing it high and throw
We can avoid any fall at all too
Sister Jean, the dance machine, ends with an open fate
She'll knock you off your feet
When you hear her well and chase me
I know that having a gun could knock around it when the music turns me on
I know it sounds happy that I'm so not bad at you
It's been in his heart
Sister Jean, a swing is enough, a shake is coming to turn a fun
That ain't bad for 85, then that gun can really fly

It sounds that you hate
But I'm in it and I think they're really great
I doubt that you can't hit a one or two
Much less or eight
Eight sound that you hate
From end from the boys they will surely separate
I tell you what they are
guaranteed you go
Yeah!
I like fingernails on a blackboard
When people crack their neck for their knuckles
When I run, style, we're both together
That just makes me shag...
Eight sound you can't dance
But you could tolerate if you were a handsome man I am
And to the list of eight
A fork and a knife scraping on a plate
Scraping on a plate
Scraping on a plate
Here's what I really love
You might want to try it
Give me teeth back
In my headphones
Ah yeah, that's more like it
Little more, little more over there
Little more, little more
Eight sound so unique
Now let's review so you can really really free
Figure nails on a blackboard
When people crack their neck for their knuckles
Rub and style we're both together
Cause it makes me shag...
I like when you sneak your darna gym floor
Rating in a lumen or a window
When a guest is just drilling my mowers
That makes me say, no
My boy singing on his record
You can't hold on for a child
If these have give you the shivers
That make you a whiner
Hey you go nuts and someone fights their fork like this
But I love it
Here I'll do it again
Do you have a nervous system left?
How about the squeegee wiping a window I crack my neck?
Surprise whips
Duffer whips

Son of a bush is a foot in your touche now saved by yoans.
That's how Georgia, while people drown, you played a round of relaxing doll flow.
Well, he was on that dash where I already eased my cup of tea that's evidento.
Oops, and no one cares to even prepare for the worst scenario.
You were the one busy having fun and that's no no.
You'll investigate at a later date, that's real bullshit.
So, I didn't get such a white to once that duck you get locked up so it don't continue.
But no one will get planes like with agent plane, no hands will roll.
Of course.
And as for this, if you slap on a wrist and no it's our just file.
What a surprise.
Because you're a liar, no one gets fired with each new messo.
Nobody, a new death toll, a slip in the poles, that's no problem.
Oh, ill fix it.
Your spin machine will deal with new warlings, because that's their job, oh.
As per usual, son of a bush is a foot in your touche, you're an asshole.
We just don't understand, you got blood on your hands, but what, no brain, no.
I'm a problem-solving.
You made it obvious that these two most of us, you have no shame, oh shame, what's that?
And what's with that smirk, you stupid jerk, when people have died old.
Son of a bitch, you should be in peach, then we mean prompt.
I knew it was all a favor, get the fuck out, you're here.
Jackass.

Excuse me, it seems father.
What is it my child?
I have something I must tell you.
What is it my daughter?
Oh father, I'm afraid to tell you.
Afraid to tell me your own father?
I fear I will be ashamed upon our family.
Nonsense, I am your father, I love you very much.
You must tell me what is wrong.
You promised you was to love me?
Of course my sweet child.
Of father's love is not erased by a simple misdeed.
Very well, I am.
I am right now.
Oh, I see.
Do you still love me father?
Of course I do.
But since you're pregnant and not married.
Yes father?
I'm afraid I must drag you down to the town square and with the help of my friends and neighbors
I'll stone you today.
My daughter, it is written that this is the punishment for what you have done.
Could you check again father?
And I should only be grounded.
The grounding is not what it is.
I must have you stone.
It's the first time that a focus is on a fundamentalist, a Middle East in Canada.
I speak with you, my esteemed husband.
What is it my wife?
Oh, I have something to tell you.
I am having an affair.
Oh, I see.
Are you going?
Out to the backyard of your collection stone.
What do you mean?
Yes, I must drag you to the town square where you will of course be stone today.
No being as much as you follow the lives of the fucknet family.
And they deal with the many problems that plague them.
Who may I speak with you, my esteemed father?
Yes, my son.
And last night I used a little drugs.
Well, what do you know?
You are one lucky boy.
Why is that father?
You are going to get stone two nights in a row.
You are one of those.

It's all free if you've got a handgun.
Some son of a bitch cheating on your girlfriend?
Kill him.
It's a simple solution of life's complex problems.
All I have to do is wait the five days for it and happiness is just around the corner.
Hell, if you don't want to wait the five days who cares?
Buy the damn thing up the street.
Just buy a lot of handguns.
It's a great alternative to working problems out and be considered a population control.
Yes, handguns.
They just might make you fans.

A good variety and a little of this, a lot of that.

Huh? I'm thinking maybe tomorrow too.
Now that you mentioned it, okay, we got 391 votes on the pool.

Oh, you? Where are we at?
Our goal was 400. We got 391.
Oh, I think we might be able to put my push in over the top.
Anyway, the question today, very important because they're threatening again.
What's your take on the Marlon's leaving South Florida?
I'll pack them all a sandwich on Route 11.
I don't care a bit 96. I've missed baseball somewhat, 48 kind of look warm.
Who cares now that they dump so much talent, 43?
I'm pissed off, 27. They'll get a stadium, 23.
They're just bluffing, 21.
They can't leave Josh needs that job, 13.
And I missed them badly, so I'm emptying the webby, only nine.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 5.16 Q.A.
Hello, everybody.
And this portion of the Neil Rogers of your 12-to-1 hour is brought to you by the Let It 12.
One group book by 6.78.11.12.
The Lices of Pizza.
All for me!
A pair of...
A pair of...
A pair of...
A pair of...
A long, long time ago,
It was 1900, and Jesse Helms was just a lad of nine.
And no one knew what was in store.
Just ended the Spanish American War,
So they ported like it was 1899.
There were events that made you shiver,
But then what times we did deliver?
A promise that was kept,
With that famous one small step,
I can't remember each event,
Or everything that man did invent.
A century we will present.
This is how it went.
My, my how the time it did fly,
Since it started some deported manatees we did cry,
For the centuries,
Time that we say goodbye,
It all happened in the blink of a night.
A hundred years have gone by.
It all started when two guys were right,
When they ported their blame into flight,
And the start of radio,
Signified had his mum to thank,
And once in theory,
And that's why,
And the Titanic, that story,
We all know.
Well, World War I,
It soon began with shooting arch-dough,
Princess Herd and Ness,
Millions died from the flu,
And play Stinky was brand new,
And then Russia had its revolution,
And a mark connected both the fioships,
And now for least we won't see again,
A hundred years have gone by.
And we were singing my,
My how the time it did fly,
Since it started some deported manatees we did cry,
For the centuries,
Time that we say goodbye,
It all happened in the blink of a night.
A hundred years have gone by.
I would add his relative a teen,
A masterpiece to the new model T,
And the birdland didn't hear family.
Then some moldy bread gave,
And a sill in Wall Street,
And the great deep ration,
And women would both like you in need.
And Germany's Chancellor was sworn in,
And World War II would soon begin,
Make your retirement land.
The project meant her 10th Annabalusian trial in Tennessee,
We caught a first one at TV,
Then the date and its in infamy,
A hundred years have gone by.
And we were singing my,
My how the time it did fly,
Since it started some deported manatees we did cry,
For the centuries,
Time that we say goodbye,
It all happened in the blink of a night.
A hundred years have gone by.
When flame went,
And they were soon be winning,
Starting with the day invasion,
But at what an appalling cause.
In Russia no one did the frost,
And Germany they find these laws,
Discovered the horrors of the Holocaust.
Fat man little boy and all the game,
Change the whole world on that very day,
Meadow had just begun,
And trying to move by the sea tongue,
The first player in baseball that was black,
Is real guy there homeland back,
Massachusetts, I like the jack of the home,
A hundred years have gone by.
And we were singing my,
My how the time it did fly,
Since it started some deported manatees we did cry,
For the centuries,
Time that we say goodbye,
It all happened in the blink of a night.
A hundred years have gone by.
Separate for evil made such a fuss,
A roasted two-time went on the bus,
Holyoke cured with a vaccine.
Then my shots get us big time,
With spot nick, our troops into Korea quick,
Discovered the double-keylet scheme.
Oh, JFK let us wait too soon,
But promise to get us all to the moon,
You're his first in space,
Yeah, the pill we did it raised,
And the French said,
And climbed into the night,
Cubusness also gave us quite a fright,
The Southeast Asia is on to fight,
A hundred years have gone by.
And we were singing my,
My how the years they did fly,
Since it started some deported manatees we did cry,
For the centuries,
Time that we say goodbye,
It all happened in the blink of a night.
A hundred years have gone by.
Niels Giants step with the big news,
Rovers way gave women right to choose,
Mixing resigns about water gates.
Got the troops at a Vietnam,
And hostages taken by Iran,
And a virus made us too scared to go day.
A test to babies held the loft,
Some guy named Bill started Microsoft,
Chernobyl explosion,
The Berlin Wall gets broken,
The USSR says goodbye,
Some students in China they did cry,
Seven died in the Florida sky,
A hundred years have gone by.
And we were singing my,
My how the time it did fly,
Since it started some deported manatees we did cry,
For the centuries,
Time that we say goodbye,
It all happened in the blink of a night.
A hundred years have gone by.
We were singing my,
My how the time it did fly,
Since it started some deported manatees we did cry,
For the centuries,
Time that we say goodbye,
Cause a hundred years have gone by.
Oh!
Oh!
Talk to me,
Tell me your name,
You blow me off like it's all the same.
You made an excuse and run,
Taking away like it's wrong.
Yes, baby.
You pay, you pay.
Oh baby, when she moves, she moves.
I go crazy, because she moves like it's wrong,
But she stays like a bee,
Like every girl in this tree.
She makes, she makes.
No words for me,
They were all the times in my head.
No words for me,
No words for me,
No words for me,
At the young children's house,
They're right we not want to grow,
That is from ourselves.
You don't know what,
What you say,
You better or else,
You're but sad,
You're but sad,
The words for me,
Are monetary,
Are ignored.
I can say,
It's time to be free.
I can say,
I hear my heart are you to disdistit,
You to get me forced,
My claim is by the power
That's gonna be in our Lord,
God's push,
The Federal Unification,
The Nation's as I'm from,
The Nation's as I'm from,
The Nation's as I'm from,
The Nation's as I am,
The Nation can't stand the life that
It wouldn't hide
If they found Shandra,
For all of those computer Jews.
Then this olive is wood, be history.
We finally put it into this mystery.
Woodliffy nice gift, they found Shandra.
In caviar and one's dead cheese.
Woodliffy nice gift, they found Shandra.
In caviar and one's dead cheese.
She could tell us about Gary Swanky.
As she laughed at hell, God, they're thinking.
Woodliffy nice gift.
I said it was really nice. We tapped our goal already.
We got four, uh, what?
Four or 14.

A lot, so now it's all gravy from here.

Well for me anyway.
Yeah.
All gravy for you.

Yeah, that's what it's the best. That's what I hear.
That's okay.
Most stuffing for this old fat slob,
I'll tend to that.

And a lot of people also are like, uh, what do they call it?
Deep frying the turkey.
I just, I can't believe you didn't see that.
Well, I mean, I was just burning down and like exploding and...
I mean, I don't have people up there.
They've got to get the flavor away with the extender plastic ring.
Right?
Right.
I agree.
Nothing like having a plastic extender ring for your thing.

Dick Cheney.
Carl Rowe, and that scuder guy.

Because of the leak. Because of the long-standing.

Let's bury our hands.

A side, a side, a side of this.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 516 Q.A.M.
God.
This is Rush Wimbaw, serving of humanity, talk show host,
and the next one is,
the next one is,
the next one is,
the next one is,
the next one is,
the next one is,
dog hunting with a judge.
Thank you very much,
the FCC.
Thank you very much for finding me.
5,000 dogs of feet.
So so am I, I'm lucky.
As more than high deflation,
you need me.
Thank you very much, the FCC.
For proving that three speeds
It's fit isn't free.
Clear channels are dear channels, so how it's turn must go.
A turny general astronaut doesn't like strong words and so.
He's charging twice as much as all the drugs for rush limo.
So food you want so very much.
Absolutely.
So you very much, dear Mr. Bush.
For your rowy curly sitting on your tush.
For Halliburton, Enron, all the companies who fail.
Let's send them a clear signal and stick Martha straight in jail.
She's an upper to you rich rich.
And into each she isn't male.
So far you also very much.
All right.
So you think she's changed too.
You and everything you do.
Your place maker must be a fake.
You haven't got a lot.
As far as I'm concerned you're just a face to face or false.
And as per calling the leaves the she's a intellectual touch.
So food you also very much.
So you very much keep me a.
For giving all the laskers oil away.
It really is a bummer when I can't fill my home up.
The ozone's and no goes out now that Arnold's here to say.
The nuclear intergame are going to take place in LA.
So you also very much.
So what the planet fails.
Let's say it's the great white males.
And you also very much.
What?
We're taking now behind the scenes as Arnold Schwarzenegger meets with political advisors.
I've only say something like I want to make California strong again by returning back.
And then going forward to the future.
That's good.
It's very important though.
I don't know whatever you say.
It has to make a lot of sense.
It's got to hit hard.
That's why I should say something like I want to make California the entertainment capital of the world bringing back the economy and moving forward.
Arnold, pilot already is the entertainment capital.
Even better.
It's already happening.
I'm only thinking it.
Wow.
Well, how about the energy crisis, Arnold?
Hey, smart man.
There is no energy crisis in California.
That was New York.
What's wrong with you?
I don't care about New York.
It's California.
California.
There's a major energy problem.
Not here.
My step to the moon's day of climate is fine.
I have power.
Let's go back to bringing California to the future.
That's a good position.
Now, Alex, actually, if you want to do that, let's think about that.
I want to take it forward.
Good.
Not backwards.
All right.
By going forward.
Should you mention, Gray Davis?
Who's that?
You know, the guy you're recalling.
I didn't call anyone.
I've been working here with you.
Well, Gray Davis.
What do you want to say about Gray Davis?
Gray Davis is not from California.
He was the dancer from the rap pack.
I'm not going to make fun of him.
What are you talking about?
The patch guy from Ocean's Nine.
You mean Ocean's Eleven.
I don't see the sequel.
I don't think sequels have any merits at all.
You're talking about Sammy Davis.
We're talking about Gray.
All you do is sequel, too, by the way.
Hey, I don't do sequels.
I'm talking about taking California to the future.
And taking down that big white sign as a Hollywood.
We need a new sign says, Hollywood.
No, that's not going to fly.
You're fired.
You're fired.
Oh.
Above you, you like my idea now, Hollywood sign?
That's a great idea.
Great idea.
California's future is about Hollywood.
Yeah, into the future.
Into the future and back.
And not back.
Not back.
Hey.
Hey.
Ah.
Take to that day to witness in the moon.

When Bill O'Reilly's dial in,
Sure he isn't wearing pants.
He'll tell you if you like your job.
Then you'll give him a last dance.
And if you tell O'Reilly,
You're not looking to be kissed.
He'll tell the pants right off you.
And for you an extortionist.
All the factors fair and balanced
But not when he calls at night.
He's looking for a lassie
Who likes it a little to the right.
When Bill O'Reilly's morning,
Sure it ain't the nose spin's long.

Anyway, George's on vacation this week.

But Jackie Robinson was an intelligent man.
And played with bowls and a major league of the children's game.
I mean, come on.
Who's the more for the black community?
Rose a pop's or Jackie Robinson?
Ah!
Jackie Robinson was my hero.
Why I can remember when I was a much younger man.
And Jackie, he was working at the shop full of nuts.
I walked up to him, shook his hand and it insended it.
You are my hero.

Hey, hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

Are you a black man?
Yes.
Oh, you can't tell a little bit of phone.
Who did more for the black community?
Rosa Parks or Jackie Robinson?
Oh, it's two separate things.
What you're doing is blurring the lies between social activists and men.
Not that I'm presuming.
Oh, he must have been disconnected.
Three no fault of my own.
On the anytime, pal, you'll want it to high thorns.
What were you having today?
You mean tell me, touch my ass and it's more for the black.
Now, now, the last lap, what I said to you today.
Now, don't get me wrong here.
It goes up to like this.
Who did more for the black community?
Rosa Parks or Nipsey Russell?
Nipsey Russell.
You don't understand what I'm saying.

Shoot.
I'm going to pay my old towel droids.
What?
I'm going to the bar.
They put the leaven in the back here.
They killed this back now.
They put the leaven in the back here.
But it's not there any more.
They put the leaven in the back here.
And they killed this back out.
They put the leaven in the back here.
Every great, me, when they took her out, I say, Mommy.
I don't like it with the limes.
I said, Mommy.
I feel a lot less likely when there's a mommy.
Yeah, I haven't felt this sad.
Mommy, since they discontinued jobs.
They put the leaven in the back here.
And they killed her door over.
They put the leaven in the back here.
But it doesn't taste the same.
I used to think they haven't wrapped you with my steam.
This week, my leg.
And then I would hover in my hero and swing,
go join an eye for a climb.
Mommy.
I prefer a lift.
Maybe Dr.
Pepper would be better.
Mommy.
Dr. Pepper.
Did I be a pepper too?
Dr.
Be easier to be busy.
Mommy.
Dr.
I cannot buy.
It just will be great.
Sometimes I wish I was straight.
They put the leaven in the back here.
They took her door over.
All right.

You're kidding me, right?
This is $100 for $100.
This ain't a million dollar question.
This is the first one.

Would you like to use a lifeline?

We are on the hundred dollar question.
You know what, Regis?
Wanna pull the audience?
No, I like to add a lifeline.
I'll actually know there's only three lifelines

No, no, no.
I get another lifeline.
It's a brand new one to the game.
And what is that, pia?
It's called Shoot the Host.
Pia, you can ask the audience.

My final answer is Doc.
It's Doc, and it's a good one.
You've got to open all of it.
Run you run you run you run.
Run, somebody run.
Run, let's get out of it.
Isn't it funny how some taste just take you back?
Like when you were a teenager.
Remember sitting on your porch on a cool summer evening,
popping a zit with your fingers and then eating it?
Well, the great taste is back at the Puzz ballast.
Yes, delicious, creamy, soft serve puss in a colt or a dish.
With your choice of toppings, all the great taste of your body
you enjoyed as a kid.
Like warm ear wax, scap gifs, and our new booger bits.
The Puzz ballast, ice cream, you scream, we all scream for Puzz.
Absolutely.

Ladies and gentlemen, I need to make Rembo 4 and 5.
Take it out, so call me up.
I really need a script.
I can do it by a long word.
Keep it zipped.
I like comedy, action, adventure, and drama.
That the only thing I really love to do is have sex with a lot.
So give me a break for goodness sake.
I used to be an Oprah, and now I can't get on Ricky Lake.
Right now, I got a one man showin' to the kepty.
Basically, I'm an unemployed chipsy.
A little bit of cash is what I mean.
I gotta get him all from the Marvel Queen.
I gotta have a mouthful of head moving.
Or Broadway show like Madagin.
I guess nobody ever saw cop wins.
It was stupid, so I understand.
My whole life is about to come in.
All I got left is jail for flavor.
That's why, ladies and gentlemen, I need to make Rembo 4 and 5.
I'm absolutely.
I can see the front page of the USA today tomorrow.
Roger Shoguetsu, over 500 votes on Thanksgiving on a pool from Penitoo.
I don't like that.
We have 491 already.
It's like falling off your chair there.
No sweat.
You are there, aren't you?
Where did he go?
Where did this man go?
I think Josh has left the building.
Oh, this is special.
I feel so alone all of a sudden.
Anyway, it's coming after 1 at 5.60 W.A.M.
We are on the air.
Maybe Josh got kidnapped.
Oh, here.
What's going on here?
What happened there?
What do you mean?
You weren't saying anything.
I'm just, you know, letting you do your thing.
We're in hell where you?
You're not fooling anybody.
I got my sweater here and on the table.
And I was, you know, you were sweating it.
Take a little nildi.
Okay, I love 13. Josh is still there.
I thought maybe you got kidnapped or something.
Maybe one of your good friends.
No, no, no, no.
I'm like, I've scotted with you.
Anyway, rich room filling sound from your iPod.
It's the power of the Bose sound doc digital music system.
It brings the music on your iPod.
The life even charges your iPod while it plays.
Sound and vision says you're bound to love what you hear.
And that's because only proprietary Bose technology
lets you get the most from the music on your iPod.
The system is friendly with iPod.
iPod many.
iPod nano and iPod with video.
It's thick appearance starlessly blends with your iPod
in almost any room they core.
Easy to use even comes with a remote that controls the sound doc system.
And the basic functions of your iPod from all the way across the room.
So let the room fillings out of the Bose sound doc digital music system
deliver a brand new iPod experience.
Insert iPod here what happens.
It'll make you so mellow you'll be thinking about Jerry Sarner.
Experience the sound doc today at well, at least maybe tomorrow when they open.
At Apple, Best Buy, Circuit City, Comp USA, Sharper Image, Target, or Tweeter.
This is Neil Rogers.

I think it's hard to think.
The one thing I won't hit there.
I am a hit or so it does.

I'm tired.
Another football.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
Well, got it.
I can't take it all right.
Oh, right.
Oh, wrong.
Oh, wrong.
It's an all new British invasion with the mad dog singing like a man.
I like it. I can't. I like it.
The truth is finally out that Jim Mandage was truly the fifth people.
You got to give me love and you give me love.
Everyone loves the land.
Now your head's just aint.
You'll always hear me say,
You're gonna be alright.
Alright. Alright.
Here's the bad dogs and your touching tribute to the king.
They are all this.
Oh right.
Oh right.
That's a wrap.
Oh baby.
You ain't gonna do.
The bad dog was just a little ambivalent when we asked him if he wanted to do it again.
Nah. I don't think so.
So we had Lucifer Rossi payable little visit and tell him either his brains or his signature would wind up on their contract.
That's some of a bitch's cute.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.

The Middle Eastern world

So dumb at people killed with the gas that we sold him
First time a crescer nation and the only one that's growing
Now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing
Forget about Korea
The nooks there chose to map us
Right wing is drilling it over and over and to our hip
That irack has some weapons of master's structure
3,000 people killed
Are now forgotten, let's exploit them instead
Hey, there's oil to be caught in
Going after Sattam too, playing Kato Sama
There's no longer mention of the name in lawton
But no one seems concerned all
Come be in complacent, believe in every word of this cartel administration
That controls us by fear through media manipulation
And the right wing is drilling it over and over and to our hip
That irack has some weapons of master's structure
Of your looters
The loss of civil rights is the price that we're paying
We're all suspects now, not the ash drop is saying
I have nothing to hide, table talkers all are saying
But I know media and cattle don't have any reservations
Sout of roboces, battle and world annihilation
Hold machines must fall and have a virgin and scope
With no objection at all
Till my craft don't have the balls and the right wing is drilling it over and over and to our brainwash pants
I rack has some weapons of master's structure
Only I rack has some weapons of master's structure

Dated of the same boring old communion wafers at holiday mass open wide meeting and prepared to receive thy savior
God creates father our mali wafers against no
Well, Billy, this isn't just any wafer.
It's not?
No, for the divine miracle of trans-association, I've turned this ordinary wafer into the
divine blessed body of Christ.
Well, why does a body of Christ have to taste so yucky?
Spice of your next communion with new Christ Aroni.
Christ Aroni is a special blend of rice, spices and seasonings, plus a bit of the body
of Christ in every fluffy forkful.
And Christ Aroni cooks up perfect every time, as he should.
Hmm, can I have some more Christ's father?
That's Christ Aroni, Billy.
Amen to that.
Christ Aroni, the trans-estabgiation tree.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 5.69.
I want to tell you something.
You're all about to send them a bit.
I don't tell you what you said.
What are they?
Are they going to get rid of this old kite on the phone?
You're going to put away that tree.
I'm not going to tell you.
Well, excuse you.
Oh, excuse your language now.
Let's hear it.
Use your language.
I'm at Monday.
I'm waiting Tuesday, Saturday, and Wednesday, and they stay.
I might not know what's to say.
There's a thing wrong with this thing giving what you need.
No, that's not true.
I probably...
If it's for, yes, you say, wait.
We're going for bad.
Oh, it seems like that.
It's finally here.
I've looked in a tree boat.
So, my face still unfolds.
Oh, I wish they all would stop dancing.
I love when I get feeding all the pieces.
Peasants.
Peasants.
Me.
Give me turkey.
Turkey.
Turkey to eat.
And now here's Timmy Dean, founder of Timmy Dean Fork Sausage, with a few words about new Timmy Dean Vagal Samertens.
Hello, I'm Timmy Dean.
You know, if someone had told me 25 years ago that I'd be making bagels, I'd have said,
huh, that's Jew food, isn't it?
But times have changed, and I guess I've got to change with them.
But I don't have to like it.
You people want your bagels, I'll give you your bagels.
With a bagel greases slab, a Timmy Dean Fork Sausage on it.
New Timmy Dean non-coachier bagel sandwiches.
If you're Jewish, you can buy them.
You just can't eat them.
New Timmy Dean bagel sandwiches.
There's a little bit of bigot in everybody.
I still remember getting my first candy from my grandfather.
It was worthless original, and I was more.
I remember it like it was only yesterday.
Hey Billy, let's play a game.
What?
Guess what I've gotten, my pocket.
A piece of candy.
Yes.
And I'm guarded by a snake.
Very good.
Grandpa, I don't want to play this game anymore.
Who's kidding?
Let's play, play the candy and the crevice.
No, Grandpa, I don't want to know when you put it there.
Yes, those games with grandpa shard me for life.
Which is why now that I'm the grandfather, I'm scarring a whole new generation with worthless original.
Hey Timmy, say hi to Wet Willie, the worthless wonderworm.
Oh no, not the wonderworm.
Worthless original, giving children nightmares for over 60 years.
Absolutely.
Don't use today's good detail, hadn't said.
And Terry's on her way on a bustman's holiday.
Don't use today to find another way to get you through the day.
Well, you won't see no dry.
Why don't they know how long it's gonna take?
Now they all know and take another break.
They waste our time with something to defend.
Just ride the guy and bring it to an end.
No use today, that's too bad for all the games.
We have the fastest race.
He's lost the business race.
Oh, hey, it's a pleasure to see you.
I'm so happy because you know what I'm saying.
I'm so happy to see you.
I'm so happy to see you.
I'm so happy to see you.

I'm so happy to see you again.
Are you sure?
Could you do it?
Hi, I'm Aaron Sommert, you know what?
You got me talking on the passion phone.
Tell me the story about how you got flown.
I got you down.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, holy cow.

Who do you have sex with with a black or blue and white?
I got you down.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, holy cow.
I'll tell you what's more before I hang up the phone.
I got you down.
All right.
Go go, go go.
Go go.
She said I was too old to take something for a leave.
Now she's got these with the base.
I got it from Linda Energy.
My goal's to jump down.
My skin ain't no round and round.
I haven't slept for three days now.
Ooh, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
Some weight broke around in the old way.
Who found many drugs to what happened today?
My hair's hollowing out and it's been hard to be.
It's a tie-saw, Linda Energy.
No, that my heart's been going wild.
Beans like I wanna die.
Kill that kill, and contemplate.
Kill that kill, and I should expect your fees.
Outfitting drugs all day.
That drops the weight but who's your brain?
Production plus spin, that's okay.
Aization is insane.
My goal's to jump down.
My head's standing all round and round.
I haven't slept for three days now.
Ooh, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.
I'm dying out of hair.
I'm going to be Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.
Oh my god.
They sold this radio station.
Yes.
Our future is in doubt.
We've been talking about Pakistan ever since got spoiled.
Now, we're going to be in a fight.
I will win for Pakistan.
The man from Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.
I'm going to win for Pakistan.
It's like waiting for hair.
Do I think that it's a bummer?
Ben, Ben, Henry's gone.
Okay.
Say goodbye to Aaron.
Summer.
They hide and run and run.
They're going to win for Pakistan.
Oh my god.
And that's a matter of fact.
They're going to win for Pakistan.
But he'll be changing his act.
My transparna again, Christian.
My sister, she can't be.
You fairy.
You've all changed the stations.
Ladders.
The WGOD now will win for Pakistan.
Pakistan, Pakistan, Greece, and France.
Pakistan, Pakistan, and France.
And we're going to work for Pakistan.
Pakistan, Pakistan, make a sign of the cross.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 5.16 QA.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'll take it slow.
Protect your inside.
Don't say, with even stills.
For grandmas, for even Neil Young.
Trees, you're living well.
Don't drink like hell.
It'll surely go bad.
Oh please.
Just keep it clean.
It can't be fixed.
You'll need a donor.
Don't you ever party hard.
If you do, you could die.
Or just wait enough long.
Live.
Life gave it cross me.
Dear Atlantis, I'll know if you remember me.
But I was the guy whose house you said on fire last year.
God, I miss you.
Even though you blew up my car.
Cut all my hair off.
I miss you, girl.
But one quick question.
Do you think you could let me know when you might let me out of this pit?
No one's fed me for weeks, but I'm not complaining.
Don't misunderstand me, because I love you with all my heart.
But if you happen to see my mother, please let it know I'm not dead yet.
Dear Atlantis, I want to tell you that the guy you saw with your best friend that wasn't me.
He might have looked and talked just like me, but that's surely purely coincidental.
I was nowhere near that place.
I love you too much to look at anyone else.
Dear Atlantis, I had a dentist appointment that day.
I was nowhere near the shared metal lens hotel.
I would never cheat on somebody who treats me so good with all those candies as all that money.
Make him my life the other day.
Baby's not your couple missiles.
Tour in a place we know.
Absolutely.
And name a madapela.
Whose first name begins with old.
There's one thing we all understand.
Alcano won't be finished until we blow up Pakistan.
We could chase around forever with our tanks and all our troops.
The special forces are some tired of jumping through them.
You throw only need another plane.
So let's cut out all the nonsense and we'll blow up Pakistan.
Now pay the needs and nuclear tanks.
Why don't we stop the seafood and blow blow up Pakistan.
All right.
I'm Casey Tissum coming to you live from Hollywood with another edition of America's Bottom 40.
Brought to you by the Oxy5 Company's newest acne medication, Oxy1 5 for pimple-free teenagers.
And so it goes.
That'd be a little quicker on a tape, boy.
That's a good joke.
We've got the worst songs in America and we're counting them down.
Record stories are showing them.
For some unknown reason you're buying them and I'm using them as coasters.
First let's review the top three songs on the charts.
And number three, Guns and Roses is singing Sweet Child of Mine.
Well, if I had a child around the house today, I'd have these four words for lead guitar,
slash and his cohorts.
Stay the hell away.
And number two, you will who it is.
There ain't no living in a perfect world.
And especially not for you, Hughie, since you don't speak proper English.
And number one, George Michael sings, he's got a monkey on his back.
Well, I would imagine it's getting a little crowded back there.
But then again, you probably don't mind.
And by the way, George, there are these remarkable shaving instruments called razor.
Hi, one.
And lose that silly ass theory.
Other songs on the charts, the band Johnny H. Jazz, with I want to be a hero,
is moving down on the charts and deserved it with myself.
Apparently, Johnny also re-heat music.
I don't think hero status is imminent, Johnny, so get a real job.
And there is a song I like, Rod Stewart's newest release, Forever Young.
And for a moment, I thought it was a song about me, Forever Hon.
And now it's time for a long distance dedication.
It comes first from a listener in Pasadena, California, to write Stair Casey.
I'm 16 years old, president of my class, I'm six foot two.
I've born here, way 175 pounds, and started quarter back to my high school team.
But Katie, I have a problem.
The girls simply will not leave me alone.
It seems as though I've they want me for you.
It's my good looks, my excellent physique.
Why can't they just like me as a friend?
Treat me as a person instead of some sex object, and quit hitting upon me all the time.
Casey, need I have any suggestions?
Shine, Todd.
Well, here's my answer.
Dear Flaming Harbor.
This is Neil Rogers.
Oh, oh, oh.

You know why people in this country get fat?
Thanks, you do.
A big, fat turkey.
It ain't cool being a no-job.
So, big, big, big, quick.
Go and set your turkey free.
This is a birdie.
Do we need your turkey for a play?
Why is our best turn in the summer season?
What do you mean, you're supposed to first four five two days, and don't forget the right foot.
What kind of turkey are you looking for?
A truck.
Yeah, a turkey.
Yeah, that turkey.
Stop it.
Give it to me again.
And we're flimping on.
This is supposed to be the best turn out in the turkey.
You gotta get a ring of fire.
Don't shoot now.
That's very well.
Everybody knows that the bird is a well.
No one cares.
The birdies are a well.

For all the words but now the networks let their actors curse
There's a wind and sights with this insanity
All the diodes of contains profanity
Swearing like a sailor on a pre-day path
Words a whole lot worse than an apple
Raccoons
As far as bombs, how will it be?
This morning drop the air bomb on a word TV
As far as bombs, there's no telling where
They'll drop on on a new field
All right
Don't carry me some stabs late one night
When he insisted that the president wasn't doing things right
Then bushes, numbers, fails arise
And suddenly we began to realize
They were doing the George Bush back
His records they tried to track
Supporters left in a flash
They did the George Bush back
From a tiny little office in the White House wing east
He pondered terrorism and Middle East peace
With the thought of John Terry grabbing more votes than thought of grabbing Terry
By the truth
They did the George Bush back
His records they really tried
Supporters left in a flash
They did the George Bush back
Carey's numbers were short and quite profound
George had to do something and not monkey around
Those important supporters he needed to revive
With more anti-carry ads help them stay alive
They did the George Bush back
His records they really tried
Supporters left in a flash
They did the George Bush back
Now everything's cool just as Carey had planned
His vote of popularity begins to expand
There's really no trick
Just tell the truth and keep crushing the president with critical reviews
They're doing the George Bush back
His records they really tried
His records they really tried
It's catching on in a flash
They're doing the George Bush back
Oh, come on come come come
Protect us with the guitar on my knee
While they died in Louisiana
I raised faster than we hoped
Oh, cut, treat us
Don't put no blame on me
Let the come from my vacation
For a photo of her to a tee
Swing your partner round and round
Now build a little swim into an orla style
Swing to the left to the right
Here we go, swing a little mud
Now throw she go
Oh, cut, treat us
Why couldn't those people clean
For this personal easy and a bad mid-ass player right here
Oh, bye bye bye
