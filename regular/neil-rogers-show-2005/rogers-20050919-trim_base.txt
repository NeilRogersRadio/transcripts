Ah
Subbit like I was in a tin can and that criminal that was that I
Don't know didn't it started hollow that sounded okay. I'm I know from where I am. It's not okay
Hey, it's you that's good enough. That's all that counts. That's right me. Yeah. What's up you?
You a ham. Oh, yeah, were they lucky?
That guy how about my Spartans baby. I'm gonna tell you something that guy was about as lonely as all alone as a guy with body odor in L.
They right and
You can smell it. You couldn't smell the defeat in the area. Yeah, and if the canes it starting off had started off
Oh, and two. Oh wow that would have been that would almost have been like the dolphins losing the jets
Well, that wasn't unexpected. Why wait Neil? Why now? Why do you say that? Why not unexpected?
I picked the game 17 6 on the S. B. N.
That's your last week excuse me although Kansas City's pretty damn good looks like excuse me. Yes on ESPN on my selection segment
I said the jets are not as bad as they look last week the dolphins are not are not as bad as they look last week the dolphins are not as good
I gave the score jets 17 the offense six. I was all I have to go to the last week they played a half
They were good in the second half when they realized that vendor missed the team bus. Yeah, I mean they had to go to New York
Where the jets always beat them. Yeah, and the offense. I have no offense
I'm gonna have this kind of a year. It's gonna right up and down
Hey, if you look pretty weak yesterday, they missed the bus also. I picked that too. Boy, they look bad. Really bad
You're a friend Tom Brady got knocked around for the joint
I've been in a course a special team is really a stunt
But we don't want to and Michigan state. I would have beat you a lot of money
Be a bait of a man that they were gonna blow that lead out again
I don't know how long that they actually would pull it out and over time
But they do that all the time. It's like some teams just have this neurotic repetition
They just famous for doing the same thing 38 to 17 and I thought to myself
And they can get out of the third quarter with a three touchdown lead
Then they're gonna win it and of course they didn't so you're watching a football this weekend
Yeah, I watched a little football. I saw my buddy Tom Brady Pat Quinn. I mean Brady Quinn. Yeah, oh Brady Quinn
Yeah, I know to them. I know who that is. Yeah, but
See, it's not important. We at least they made it exciting anyway. They pulled it on over time touchdown
Jesus couldn't pull it through for me. Well, I can't be glad again that you're not here this week
I am with the would be Brian or I mean we did in fact and just the latest thing that I
Printed out here is that the tropical stormy to could become as much as a her category three
Hurricane by the time it hits the keys. Oh, I knew is that right? Yeah, we didn't get that on our report
Well, I guess got the latest and the greatest from your friends at the herald
So I'm on top of it. Oh, if it's in the herald it must be right
Son of shine in here. It's beautiful. There's not a cloud. It's got to be like 77 today
Man, it's just like heaven all week all week now. We'll have a week of rain. I guess well good luck to you
You'll need it. Thanks. I don't think it doesn't look like the storm is gonna be too much of an impact up here
But don't say that I know don't say that I got suckered into saying that last time based on the predictors and the prognosticators
Then of course to date turned out they've got him pretty bad
So don't say that because looks like there could be a lot of rain out I'll get to eventually here in a couple minutes
Lot of rain and wind yeah
Downing trees power outages. It said we're not like Katrina. Oh similar to when Katrina hit Florida
With a beat that bad here possible. Yeah, cuz it seems to be going south
Is that what you're probably said last time we thought it was gonna hit Bokeh and then it took that little jog
All it takes is just a little bit of a jog there, you know at the ass end and
That's what happened with Andrew
Remember Andrew was supposed to go north. Can you imagine if it would have?
Because I said I sat out on my well part of the time I said out on my
Epadio and it was just it was like the end of the world and that was in West Broward and of course
You know hitting homestead so one can only begin to imagine and this rain Nagan
He's this guy's a knucklehead to come to find out. He's an idiot
Yeah, I'm being bringing I was people to come
Everybody to come and they open up dad there. They got no power in most of the place. They got no potable water
They got no nothing and of course all the disease in the unhealthy environment their hospitals are for the most part close down
The bars are open and I got the bars open in the French quarter. Yeah, there you go
That's what's important and they can just get the fairgrounds open in the bars. Everything will be okay. Oh speaking of the fairgrounds
Yeah, there's an update on Gulfstream
Yeah, I
Talk to a guy who told him who's close to the construction people who told me they could work 24 hours a day from now until they're opening
And they won't even have the first floor finished. Well, that's good
Yeah, but I bet you they'll bring back Gary Puckett in the Union gap to sing out there in the banjo
Right, that's all that counts
It's like when Halea when the Bernady brought in all those Huchi Kuchi groups and that was gonna bring the fans back to the race track
Yeah, no that's a few people watching the
Brings anybody out there for the race and it was lame acts and not one person would come into the track and bet you know
Even lots of race so they just never learned their lesson, you know, and of course now there
Your buddy Mike Mayo actually wrote a good comment. I thought the slot machine about the slots
Yeah, he's got a petition thing going and nice going there Michael the Mayo. That was well done. I read that yesterday
Yeah, nothing's gonna have any impact but at least you know
It's an outlet for
It's unconscionable that the legislature doesn't enact what the people voted for
Yeah, but I governor never does he will say that the the paramutual people with all the respect to my friends at
Topino Park that the per mutual people are there was enough. Yeah, well as soon as judge Mo
Soon as he said the given to go from judge Moe they should have started ordering the machines and said look
This is it and we're gonna go ahead and the things said by July 1st
And he didn't do it that would have gotten them off the rest but they did they're just kind of sitting back
But a beep but it would be like like always in Florida, you know
I think they're afraid of the governor because he's
He know what I like it well now the keys the other report that we have received you
Would do that again in a video here mr. Goldberg and gas stations along us one in the key look at that
There's your fat ass governor long as the sun stays off the road will be safe
You said yeah, he's got a hell of a family the moment you said that there came his ugly fat push on my TV on CNN
I can't believe that that is shocking timing is everything for to be yeah
And then he also if you ended this announcement about the storm
He's gonna say by the way I forget about the slots
Forget about the class size forget about the bullet train forget about the slots. Yeah, I'm your addicted
They don't lose well those people that and the fact is that the public likes him
I still can't figure that out. That's one of the great mysteries of all time is why the public likes this loser and is this functional
Fony family the worst they exactly
I was talking about one time one time at a Marlins game back at IOD I had I had
Season tickets to give me like was I maybe the first or second season for the Marlins against the opening season and my seats were right behind
He about five rows behind his he had the front row boxes and I was like any orange like in a first or second row the orange seats and
He shows up there with his entourage with this big fat red neck obnoxious fundraiser guy
It was sitting right next to me that took up three seats with his ass and one of his buddies down there was you
You can tell you there's that near Roger and he turns around and looked at me the I think this is before he was governor
Would have been wouldn't it yeah? How long yeah, and there he was turned around to give me a look that would just kill and I wanted to flip him off
But that would have been a bad idea, but I just give him I just give him the equal and sour look
You know somebody was we were talking a couple days ago
It's somebody was saying that this family what they're doing to this country where this country is gonna be by the time Bush
Leagues leaves office. Uh-huh. We're gonna be the the deficit is gonna be over 700 billion
And right and we aren't gonna have any friends anywhere in the world and we will cease to be a power
Yeah, the China will be the whole world makes America now it's even slopping over the hit Americans too. So anywhere I go I'm I'm Canadian
A oh yeah, you're laughing, but this is the new thing that a lot of Americans that they actually go out and get like you
There a candidate t-shirt or a cap or both, you know, and when it go abroad especially to Europe they're like a Canadian
How's it going a I'll tell you when you when you'll lose that
Perspective from other people not to you know stereotype raining, but the minute you get behind a wheel of a car
They'll know you're not. Yeah, that's why I don't drive here. Okay
Oh brother, well there's that star. I can't believe you had another big one coming again. Just never stops
Yeah, I mean I'll be in tomorrow. We'll see. Yeah, well we may not be on the year tomorrow. Yeah
That's what I'm always hoping for I'm thinking about 1015 comes along a big gust of wind big
out and all of a sudden the tower goes down and but the track of the song so I checked doing the
Investigative work that you would expect from me. I checked that my sources and coming it looks like it
Maybe true about your leader
So if you plan on getting suspended anymore you got like October about three and a half months to do it till the end of the year
I don't mind the suspension. They always get lifted. Yeah, I'll be careful
I'm not commenting on that story anymore. Well, why why is that I threw out the first ball and I'm done
Yeah, just like your BS about your buddy there
Do do do do do do do do do stick all the grief into my basket and then I'm left to hold in the sack
My buddy is your close personal pal
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do I just want to make one comment because I know I'm sure he's listening right now
And that is you can't talk about other people's ratings unless you have any okay? I'm just mentioning that
Anybody in particular, but for somebody who's probably listening right now because I have no life. He has no life
Do
When you when you look up your number and it says below minimum reporting standards, you know it's a problem
When it has a minus in front of it. It's not a good sign. Yeah, speaking of guilty by the way. How about those panthers?
Hey, I think there's gonna be a little excitement about them this year
Well, I know they're gonna be pretty good team
I don't know if they're gonna be a seven or not knowing the South Floor. I'm gonna tell you
I was so depressed and seeing the attendance at the three Marlin Phillies games over the weekend. That was so lame
I didn't even I didn't look to see what it was
It was a little over 30 on Friday. Sorry. It looked like they had a good crowd
I tried seven
27 and Sunday yesterday was 25 a little over 25 now that's lame
Yeah, they've been standing remotely. This is the season of the series of the season and Von Tro and Beckett bitch
right down the last few games
Just nippin tucked for the wild card and you get you know
mediocre. I mean decent crowds, but nothing like you'd expect in a real sports time and now labor day is over
No excuses anymore and the herald today if you want to gag. Yeah, they have a editorial about how they
Got to make a deal for a stadium and then it they talk about this third
They could have made a deal when the difference in money was 30 million dollars
I'm gonna tell you something the difference in money was never 30 million dollars
They underestimate the cost of that stadium from day one, but yeah, the herald well a hero wants them to build a right across the street
Just to goose up their property value. Well, they know that can't happen anymore. I know that
But I'm just saying that anything that the herald is for is because it's good for the herald
That's true that then a lot of other things have changed there the personnel have changed
But that's the one thing they care about the only the heralds interest nothing else. They suck. I can say that
There you go. Don't say though. I said it and it's on my time. I'm soon. I have to worry about the herald sucks
Hey, great. Listen, have a great day. I think Monday's a real gambling. I got the game. Oh, yeah
There's everything but I put four games tonight and I'm going to batten down my hatches and
Stock up on corn be for some going down batten down the hatches and they get ready to move to nances
Or something like that. Okay. Hey, I'm good. Daniel. Okay, stay dry. I don't want to tell you what does set to rely on
But he said it's curaline easily and then he said something about well
Yeah, I stay in shape. Don't get sick much. So when are we going to the game? We I'm taking back you call this stuff

Summers officially here and so are their scorching hot south Florida temperatures. Is your grudge back in?
Hey everybody. I'm brown and brown
Accountable for everybody brown and brown. That's a human being
I'm a big disappointment, but I got a brown nose and I know where to point it
There was no one to get them saved. They don't both recover again. Anyway, I did everything
I possibly can to show myself home for the good luck plan. Oh, what a god
The wrecker of fever when I'm a chore than a weasel he's fever and a clueless son of a bitch
A clueless stick brown nose in the ring
Get his gags round nose in the rig
New Orleans is wiped out in gone
But w said I did one heck of a job and it sure pays off
To be a brownie and another white maize
The Christian Fony the national god is down and down
With all of us just to get the press out of town everybody go home
There's nothing to see
Everything here is big, big pain
All the hurricane gave us nothing easy
For geofrown social engineering like a giant republic in Swingy
Praise Jesus for our lord and game
Praise Jesus for our lord and game
I don't believe compassion's what we lack
It serves the right to have less blacks and you descend to say it's a national disgrace
They shouldn't have it black
In the first place this is no time to play the blame game
Since we know that the remains are caused by gain
School are not the right kind of all-mong
Like Scottie McLean and Carl Gold
All we're achieving in a parakeet right when dream
You make everybody white like me
And the ignorant son of a bitch
You get to chug
Ground nose in the rig
Pull how I miss bed in line
You're crazy and horses
I'd rather you that than watch floating corpses
I'm a negligent murderer now
And I'll keep going down and keep my nose brown
I'm a negligent murderer now
But I'll keep going down to keep my nose brown
I'll be damned I forgot what I was going to talk to Hank about
Was that?
Well you're going to have to both remind me tomorrow
About Chris Shankledide
It was 82 of the voice of the New York Giants
All right, I'll read it though
Long time ABC as sportscaster
He did everything from the Olympics to bowling
Died after a long battle with Emphacima
Chris Shankled
Shankled
He called gymnast Nadia Cummeneets his perfect 10
The 17th and 17th Olympics in Montreal
Was in the booth for the 58 NFL championship
Game between the course of the Giants
And he once said on a Giants broadcast
Which I saw with my own four eyes
He said he faked him out of his jogs trap
And then there was a long pause
He said he faked him out of his shoes
That was live TV
You know, if somehow by doing the second one
You'd forget that he said the first one
But too late
Also done to clen-denon for more of Pirates Slogger Died
He was 70
Some sports deaths
Well, I got to put that in my pile for tomorrow
Because I'm sure that Hank will want to talk about Chris Shankled
Or maybe not
10-14 already
We got the reader coming
I'll give you the advisory on read
Don't let me also forget what it gets to be about 20-11
There'll be a new advisory on read
And I'm not going to put myself in a position
Like back with Katrina
Of like soft pebbling this baby
Because Troy Stratford came in and bitched me out
After and all I was doing was just passing along the information
That we were getting from the National Hurricane Center
All the other prognosticators
But I'm not going to do
I'll just give you whatever we got
You know
And you do our your own conclusions
In other words, if you want to panic, please do
As we learned in the last couple of weeks
Better be safe than sorry, right?
All the old clichés
When a doubt trot off the hurricane shutters all of that stuff
10-15 at 5-60 WQM
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
That's the new thing
If you never coast your house will simply chose to be okay
I'm dying off again
You know it's easier to get some flowers to be paid
Nail it up, nail it up, nail it up
Ha!
Her case
Oh
She's the same
That they must be the same hurricane
You wish the trade of the clock was more like those of hurricane
Better run, better run, better run
Oh my god
The only god of the feeling is a weather
Channels keep hurricane
He says people should leave while he's alive on the scene
hurricane
He has not seen, has not seen, has not seen
Hur-
Hur-
I'm actually that weather fairy is a hyperventilating right now
What's the thing?
Are you-
Are you-
I-
I want to do, I give you the real thing here, nail
They have Brian, you fairy
20 after 10 at 5-60 WQM
So before we get into yesterday's uh the weekend's poll result
You realize we had almost 3,000 votes on the poll 28-62?
Well, shocking is what it is
Shocking and maybe one of the reasons we're starting to get a lot more votes on the poll
is the fact that we put the poll where people can see it
At the top of our website is the poster way down there on the bottom where Eric can't put it all the time
Nice going Eric
Go have a few sandwiches, go get a few with those um breakfast burritos Eric they're good for you
Get your blanchard you're up to about 700
So here's the latest on the hurricane situation
Well, it's not hurricane yet, but
Rita strengthens evacuations ordered or planted in South Florida
This is uh from the heralds so consider that
Residents were ordered to leave Key West and to Florida Keys this morning
It signs that tropical storm Rita could strengthen into a major hurricane
Is it approaches the region?
Oh my god
The National Hurricane Center is telling us there is some risk that Rita might reach
Categorize three status as it approaches the key said our reaint owner
Monroe County's emergency management director our policy is to call for a
Generally evacuation areas that might be prone to category three impacts
He said the Monroe County sheltered at FIU's main campus along with
South a uh along southwest eighth street and they'd county will open early this afternoon
Officials in date and brown or respected when i was partial evacuations later today
School's are open in both counties but will be closed and browned tomorrow now
That the herald says that in one sentence and then later on it says
Broward schools are expected to close tomorrow. There you go
Yeah, so it all depends on if you'd rather have the pain in the air
Yeah, it's just if you don't like your kids just send to school
Right if you've ragged in them and yeah, just keep them home and then George can sleep in tomorrow
Forecasters emphasized that Rita showed no sight of inflicting the
Tempuk atastory delivered last month by Katrina New Orleans and the uh
Gulf Coast will thank God for that
But but now look at the pattern here first New Orleans and now Key West you see that i wonder if it has a
Yeah, I'm sure that Pat Robertson will find out and it does
Uh forecast you said South Florida's weather will begin to deteriorate this afternoon
We mean grow progressively worse throughout the night into tomorrow as Rita intensifies into her cane and moves closer to the region
Oh my god
I reasoned panic, but i'd be uh prepared this time okay
I'm not gonna open leave myself open for a Troy Stratford coming in and open up a big bald headed mouth
And say well you would regard to people this yeah
Go sell something Troy get out of my face you loser
residents of Dayton, Howard would advise to be uh being prepared immediately
Immediately for gust that approach hurricane strength of 74 miles an hour
For up to five inches of rain and for five foot storm tides as far north as Miami Beach
With up to three feet of storm platform through the rest of coastal date and
Wow
sustained winds could exceed tropical storm strength of 39 miles an hour is uh this
As early as tomorrow morning in metropolitan, Dayton, Howard
Forkash to set downing trees causing power outages similar to those experience fewer than four weeks ago when Katrina swept through
South Florida
When some of us underestimated because the prognosticators blew it big time they were full of crap
The situation will be worse in the keys which will experience the state hurricane force winds in eight foot storm surge
And up to 15 inches of rain 15 inches of rain
residents worded out of the lower keys including key west this morning and a mandatory evacuation of tourists was extended throughout the keys
Schools are closed in the island showed us for residents will open a noon in marathon and alamarada
residents of the keys were urged to install their hurricane shutters now
Not later now and secure loose objects experts recommend that residents of Dayton, Howard prepare for similar action
Max may feel that dodging a wolf full of the national hurricane center
Says i'm ready to have mine put up if the track shifts my shutters are already out and sitting by the windows
Well, I sure hope that you get to it right away max other than big gust of wind will come along and blow all of my shutters away
And it could be like flying objects like projectiles, you know what
Maybe kill some people as somebody we know what say
Forecasters already are also awarded the possibility of tornado
Boy, it's so great not being there you know i'll bet four cancers also awarded the possibility of tornadoes
Throughout the region beginning to night and persisting through tomorrow night
They'd count a mayor carlos alphare city expects to announce later today
Evacuations of county trailer parks and a voluntary evacuation of his own a along with counties coastline
Evacuously urts to stay with family or friends who live inland
There's no reason to be alarmed, but this term should be taken seriously alphare i said
I think we learned some experiences from katrina which hits our photos a camp one hurricane
But surprise many people with its power
Please stay informed the mayor urges because the one thing we did learn is that you can't predict with total precision
Exactly where the storms will go here's residents to pay attention to storms and tear cone of probability not just the center line
Watch out for that cone okay
Set the cone Gary cone modicone all of these things and of course your buddy
So i buddy yeah oh
