Alright it's time to turn it over to Neil. He takes up the two and then Howard and
then Mad Dog follows that. How was your weekend? It was just fine.
PC Dandy. I had a bad shrimp on Saturday night. Did you really? I was yesterday.
It was just a mess. Ed's yours? No. Oh no. Joe doesn't serve bad fish. Where did
this happen? Are you not going to say I'm not going to say it? Well why not? I just can't
do that. Maybe they're an advertiser or something. Are they? I don't know. Was it a freebie?
Is that it? No. No. What's in a paid for it? You got sick. I paid for this. I'll
give them an ass. I put them out of business. Yeah. Those things happen. Yeah. That bad stuff
happens. Yes. Just like this morning. Duff comes in there again. I thought I got rid of
that, that child. And I want to suddenly come in again with that good morning. Go away,
Duff. You silly person. You fairly get away from me. At the last Monday, when you think
you can keep his distance, I made it very clear. In fact, that was one of the things
and I'm sure in your deal too, is that Joyce tried to get us to sign. One of the six
thousand reasons we can get fired would be for in the subordination. Remember that?
Yeah. I don't know who the fine is. I asked if I thought a pretty good question. Who
stood to find in subordination? They are. In other words, if you look at somebody cross-eyed
up in subordination, you're fired or it's a very least suspended. Right. By the way,
we got some good news for them. They did in a couple months now. Yeah, but that's because
screw rain is going. You'll have to find somebody else to pick on. Jenny Shivo has got some
good news coming. Jose Konseko is going to come and inject her with steroids right
a minute. She's going to hop right up out of that hospital bed and do the hully gully
you watch. Yeah. Just like this is like alien all over again. Optimus. This whole country
is just what's going on. I played a tape from Bush's State of the Union address. Yeah.
Where he talked about Abu Gharab. Where he talked about getting rid of steroids. Yeah.
Sportsman. Last week, the night before the congressional hearing, he said that baseball
has done a good job of policing steroids. I mean, it doesn't matter what the subject
is. He said, and he accused. You know, he accused. He accused Kerry of flip-flopping. Yeah.
Yeah. Brutal. There's no escape from this either. We don't have the right to do anything
for ourselves anymore. He is what America is all about. Yeah. Besides that by the noise
by the media intrusive is another one to the grave robbing media. But I want to think
happy thoughts today. That's it. Be happy today. Go out there and win a whole bunch.
That's not what I'm positively. Instead of don't lose too much, win a crap load of money
a day. That's right. Win thousands. I ran into a guy who's a notorious jinx. Yeah.
People he's like mush. People see him at the track. They run the other way. Yeah. I run
into him. Saturday morning, I'm filling up my gas tank for about $80. Another wonderful
thing that's going on here. What's price of gas up in Canada? About four bucks a gallon.
Well, never mind. But anyway, he walks up. Shakespeare says hello. And I knew then I
should have turned around and gone home just spent the day in bed. Instead, I went on to
the track and got crushed. Really? Yeah. Hey, cat, a losing day. Well, I may say everybody
else feel more, you know, whatever he shows up. It's amazing. I think people like that,
like Lester Greenshirt, called her years ago. He was always a curse. And then at
the top of the whole, Mr. Z. Oh, and then also I heard you talk about him. Earl the
shoe man at top of the park used to sit the table right across from me in fact, rich
restaurant piece. And at any time he would show up there, it would be a disaster. Yep.
Also, he was a tout. He's a town. Great. That's what you need a tout who's bad luck. Well,
you have a nice day and you too. And win a bundle. Let's look at it real positively today.
Okay. And don't know in subordination this time. No, I ran his gun. Keep your nose clean.
I've been good boy. Don't be picking on the water. Not seeing any of those other bastards.
We got running around making everybody's life miserable. By the way, Duff, you fair. Get
away from me. Go away. Don't pick on somebody your own size. I'm out of here. Have a great
day, Humper. See ya. Hey, lost his ass Saturday. Not feeling more.
She won your heart in the miracle worker. Despite her handicaps, she left behind a life
time of achievements. And now with the discovery of rare audio tapes found in a basement somewhere
in New Jersey, deaf jam records makes available to you. Helen Keller saves the blues.
A series of recordings from the 1950s by Helen Keller herself, wailing out of pounded
sound. To order yours, have your credit card rate and call 1-800-
order now and get a bonus list of duets by Marley Madlin and Johnny Ray.
It's a 10-05 at 560 WQM. How insensitive and cruel would you say? You bastard. You miserable,
heartless bastard. You see, I just refuse to be one of the lemmings in America who gets
manipulated by the media. I haven't been saying this for years since way back with Alien Time.
Whatever the mass media tells you ought to be whipped up into a frenzy about whether it's
steroids and baseball or whether it's Terry Shival. Everybody's like, you know, just goose
stuff right along. I'm going to be very honest with you and for very few time. And that
is that I don't really care about steroids and baseball or Terry Shival. How do you like
that? Either one. I got a second there. Man McGill, you care about either one of those?
Not necessarily no. Oh for three. And this panel so far, Georgia's on vacation this week,
by the way. He didn't get suspended or anything like that or fired it in the spot of Maddie
Bell and Greg Wied's strongest wishes. What is this? Do you just send me something here?
Yeah. Well, why is it that they crossed? Why do they do that? Why do they cross their
nema from so and so and then they cross their nema? Oh, it's to the hero. Right. I find
that a degree of political involvement in Terry Shival. Absolutely. Un-
They are evil. Says Mr. Anonymous or Miss. The doctors have made a prognosis and the
woman's husband and legal guardian has made his wishes crystal clear. Today a healthy,
strong, energetic, personal most certainly dying a rack. His or her parents and loved
ones will be the only people likely to give any notice that the young soldiers lost
of his right to live. Yet the entire country wants to have a say about a brained, dead woman's
right to die. No, not the entire country. Just a grandstanding, pandering, got Congress.
And with Tom Delay, it's a good way to take this spotlight off of his legal problem
since he's the biggest Kirk and Congress. Anyway, this goes on to say I find a very
disconcerting that so many of our politicians from our nation's leaders on down are
governing by personal and religious beliefs rather than what is right for the
citizens of this country. Whether something game-married, abortion-abrained, dead
women's right to die, for example, is spiritually correct. A sin or right in the
eyes of God should not and must not be consideration when passing legislation. These are
personal choices and must stay that way. Freedom of religion is one of the things
that separates the U.S. from other countries. Like barbaric countries like
Canada, for example. If we govern our country by the religious beliefs of our
politicians that were no different than Iran, Ireland, many of their other
countries, torn apart by religion. I beg every man and woman in this country who
has voted into a political office, remember you have been placed there by the
citizens of this country to hear our legislation for all people. You're not
there to change anyone's religious beliefs, are governed by your own
personal beliefs. You're not let 229 years of freedom get away. And whoever this
anonymous facts are is, good thoughts, but they're a little bit late. A little bit
late. The horse is out of the barn already. The party's over. Now, got a great
calm here. And even though Miguel doesn't like the reading, I couldn't care less.
Go for it. And you know that memo that internal Republican memo that they've
and I had any influence whatsoever about how they're going to make political
hay over this. Keep in mind that Randall Terry is going to be speaking with the
shinlar tomorrow. He's on his way from Texas and he's not already there. Randall
Terry, which I, if you don't know who that is, I've got the whole story on him.
And of course, his gaze on you fairy, with Jamie L. or whatever his name is. Doug
Thompson who writes the rant for a Capitol Hill blue. He sums it up as usual.
Nice going, Doug. A political feeding frenzy over a feeding tube. He writes with a
cold, callous political toy. And by the way, we're not doing a poll today.
And we're doing food this week. I'm not doing a silly ass pull on Terry
Shavall, although we've got the national results. And I'm looking to put for these
Pandora Republicans. Oh, US Supreme Court rejects appeal by accused. I love
him. Come to conspirator Zacharias Zacharias Musawi. He used to be
Zacharias. Now he's a carious. Whatever that means. He wanted access to
Alcatta witnesses for his defense. And they said absolutely not. Anyway, with a
cold, callous political toy, the harpies who call themselves conservatives and
Republicans have taken hypocrisy to a new level by interfering with Terry
Shavall's right to die with some dignity. Forget the Bolshevets filling out of
the halls of Congress and the West Wing of the White House. Sunday's
incredible actions to prolong the shameful saga of a brain damage woman who's
been on a feeding tube since 1990. This has nothing to do with compassion. And
is everything to do with advancing the repressive right wing agenda of the
zealots who've taken over the US government. If George W. Bush had a single
compassionate vote in his hypocritical body, he wouldn't have sent 1500 plus
Americans to their deaths in Iraq, along with the untold thousands of innocent
Iraqis who have died in this illegal war. One rubber stand by his
co-conspirators in Congress. Now we're supposed to believe this
clavum of murderers has given a gives a rat's ass about whether or not a
feeding tube is reinserted into woman's body in Florida. It ain't about life.
It's about control. It ain't about compassion. It's about seizing on a
political opportunity to advance a conservative agenda that will give the
government more domination over all of our lives. Before the seizure that left
her hopelessly brain damage, Terry Shavall told her husband she did not want to
be kept alive if something like this ever happened to her. In most societies,
this is called free will. But free will cannot exist in a political world
dominated by the hypocrites in Congress and the hypocrite in chief at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue. The laws of the land meet nothing to those who put their
own agendas of other Americans right to determine their own destiny.
Which is a GD liar when he claims this issue is about life. So are the
wing notes who control Congress. The Republican Party used to preach states
rights. The state courts made the decision in the Shavall case. But now the GOP
opportunists want to make this a federal case where the emergency legislation
requires the federal court to intervene. Christ Almighty has anyone these
effing idiots looked at themselves it immemorial lately and realized what
fools they've made of themselves not to mention the mockery that the U.S.
governments become. How can a party that sends Americans to die in illegal
wars and supports expansion of the death penalty say with a straight face that
they care one aude about human life they don't. These dismisses don't give a
shmit about rights and one time they did but not anymore once the Holy
Roleurs and religious hypocrites hijacked the Republican Party any hope for
fairness decency and honesty went right out the window. Hopefully a
federal judge will tell Bush and his heart reached to take a hike and
allow Terry Shivall to die in peace. Perhaps it's a good thing that Terry
Shivall is unaware of the political circus around in her right to die. It's
bad enough that the rest of us have to endure the stench from the
putrid rotting corpse of the dinosaur called the Republican Party. Man
is to dark Thompson on Capitol Hill Blue is great. It's better what George
said. The best. Bring good stuff, eh?
Hey.
Fairly you're a bastard.
From the producers of American Idol.
From the heartwarming collection of favorites inserted by America's
sweetheart Terry Shivall.
Of course he loves to sing. Look how she smiling.
Yes it's Terry Shivall.
She's vibrant. She's alive. She's doing a disaster. They want to be in there.
They already moved to. Let's get that to back in there again baby.
We're going to hell.
What?
The brother says they've had all of these people on all weekend 26 hours a day.
The brother says she's vibrant and she's expressive and she's going to get up and dance to
Kazaski or something like that is what he said.
Hey, let's close.
Yeah. She's a belt out the hits baby.
Anyway, here's the poll for today and now I give you the results from Friday.
We'll do it back with we got Frederic Vanderroll. I didn't even look to see who we had on the
be the curtain because somebody was in there this morning taking up my time.
He was only in there for a minute but it was too much.
Don't you understand, Duffy, you've wounded my existence for the last time.
You are a negative, a big fat negative in my life.
Your behavior a week ago today just over one week ago now and about the let's see 23 minutes plus was unacceptable.
And it's never going to happen again. Just go away.
See, it's one of the things about surviving in life is that you have to eliminate as many as the negative
forces in your life as possible.
Get rid of him. Just like that pain in the ass wife you got.
Get rid of her. Dump her. Just like Bobby Blake.
You know what I'm saying? Get rid of her.
The bitch had a coming.
For Frederic Vanderroll and I, that sounds dutch to me. Who is she?
I don't know. You got the bio, right?
No, I don't. I didn't. I didn't even look at it until just during this break.
It's just dawned on me with all this other stuff we had going on.
We didn't have the phones working until about five minutes before air time.
We've got, you know, our usual Monday morning blues at QAM.
Because we have people coming over the weekend and dittle and dittle and dittle and dittle.
Both dittleies in there. He's dittle and dittle.
Both dittleies in there. He's dittle and dittle.
God. And so every Monday morning isn't a mitigated disaster.
That's the other reason we don't need certain people coming in there.
You're fair.
Because you tell them the same thing every week. Nothing changes anyway.
Am I right about that? Absolutely. You don't have to answer.
At least the Miguel could answer. You don't have to answer to him.
Do you?
No.
The best Italian restaurant in Florida.
We're doing food all this week at the suggestion to one of our poll builders out there.
That's pretty good. It's like they do one new times in the city link.
I don't think we are even. Huh?
Best of.
All right. The best of this week.
The best Italian restaurant in Florida. No pizza joints is.
I got two to start. I didn't put them on there yet.
Il Milino.
I.L.
Capillán.
Mo.L.I.
N.O.
Milino. Just like Victor Milino, the jockey.
Il Milino.
And Donatello is in Tampa. You can put out of town ones you can put in parentheses.
Donatello is in Tampa.
Can you spell Donatello's?
D-O-N-A-T-E-L-L-O.
Poster-V-S.
Got it, Josh?
Yeah, he used to watch an Ninja Turtle scene.
What does that mean?
The Ninja Turtle, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
You never saw that?
Yeah.
He's watching that?
Yeah.
You know, we're going to have to start screening the calls, I think.
Then?
Give that child to give you a little something more to do.
So you can pay like a little bit more attention.
I realize this is enough your alley, but you know, you better get with it.
We can bring back Miguel's country mate there.
Hola.
We can bring him back.
Hola.
Il Milino. Donatello.
I just can't think of that many really great Italian restaurants.
I'm talking about ones that are open.

There are many numbers left out for now.
There are many numbers I get so weird.
Homeless people.
That's it for what I don't know.
Well, I mean, they have to be exactly, can be like with the T, Matarano, M-A-T-E-R-E.
Yeah, I believe it's M-A-T-E-R-A-A-N-O-S from Philadelphia.
Okay.
Outstanding.
Okay, got it down.
Thanks a lot, Tom.
Matarano is in Fort Lauderdad.
That's a tie, and it sounds a tie in any way, right?
I mean, like, shorts, this wouldn't be it.
Oh, I got another good one for you.
How about runway 84?
I noticed that Bo Diel was talking about, he talked about a dead man with a feeding tube.
What are they going to take out?
I'mus's feeding tube and the Pope, huh?
Yeah, you know, I heard a little bit of that on the board when I walked in.
Yes, that bit sounds exactly like on this.
Right.
Exactly, that's him.
He's a dead man in the chair.
Take the tube out of him.
If I'mus and there would be the end, pull the plug.
So Matarano is, and runway 84, you got that?
That's Anthony's runway 84 and Fort Lauderdad.
You ever been there?
No.
Man, that's not only is it a fabulous, I know I'm old, I said a lot.
He probably gets freebies there, and so do I.
But they give you so much food.
It's fabulous.
And when you walk in, it looks like a scene out of like Godfather.
There's a lot of real interesting guys and pinstripes, suits and big hats.
I'm not suggesting that anybody, you know, you know what I'm saying?
But the fact guys have hot chicks.
Huh?
But the fact guys have hot chicks.
Fat guys and hot chicks.
And the lots and lots of food.
Man, it's just unbelievable.
In fact, if you need me, you'll understand how come in there got so big.
You're listening to the annual Rogers call.
Yes, exclusively on 560, in the AM.
And he joined my wife and kids at the olive tree restaurant.
Now my uncle Tony, he's in the Italian cuisine connoisseur.
If it ain't perfect, he's not happy.
Now I couldn't believe it when he said the chicken prime was on, was the best he'd ever
tasted.
Plus, he kept raven about the free breadsticks and all the salad you could eat.
My uncle Tony recommends you come down to the olive tree.
Because when you're here, you're family.
And by that, I mean, you know, in the family.
Like last night, this couple was done eating right and they were walking out.
And my uncle says, what are you going?
And they say, we're heading out to see a movie.
And Tony says, huh, huh, not until you head down to the 4-H club and put a hit on a
f***er, Corboh Maroni.
And these people freaked out, right?
They started laughing because they didn't realize my uncle was serious and then once you
eat at the olive tree, you're in the family, right?
So Tony stands up and he says, what's so funny?
Do I am news you?
Am I some kind of clown or something?
Then he takes a steak knife, right?
And he starts sticking this guy.
And he's sticking him and sticking him, right?
Well, anyway, the meal was f***ing great.
The olive tree restaurant when you're here, your family forever.
Oh, you asked this record to hold emergency hearing.
I'm Terry Shabbo, a three-year staff member.
How do you like that?
Oh, my God.
Exactly.
So anyway, somebody suggests we're a pool.
Oh, you know what else ought to be on there?
Yeah.
Even though Miguel will get very upset about.
Too bad.
What's that?
Macaroni Grill.
No, they're great.
Well, then shall we put like Corboh Maroni?
They're great.
You told me before they show you hate that place.
Don't know lie.
OK, don't lie.
Sorry, man.
Just like Hank, but what's it off this morning?
I mean, if you eat bad food at a restaurant that makes you sick, and you know they're not
a sponsor on the station, which I'm sure they're not, he had some bad scene.
Then talk about it, right?
What the hell do we owe?
We should protect the audience out there from going to get and sick at some place.
Anyway, Macaroni Grill.
What's that like?
I don't care what you say, because what the hell do you know about food anyway?
What do you beans and rice and guava?
Baras, what do you know?
What do you know?
Baras.
Yeah, whatever the hell it is, just in your media no chase and all that other garbage.
What about Corboh?
What about it?
I never ate there.
Is it good?
You've never eaten there?
Let me repeat.
I mean, it's fairly, you know, it's really known.
I thought you would, you know.
But you know, I'm putting it on there.
The question is not have I eaten there, not has Miguelito eaten there, is it good?
Yes, the question is the bet.
OK, we'll put it on there.
What do you mean?
It's not.
Well, put it on there.
Mamba, mamba mia.
Yes, somebody thanks this, and mamba mia is in Hollywood circle.
Well, you better put mamba mia's Hollywood, so because I have a feeling there might be
more than one mamba mia.
See what I'm saying?
All right, I'll have to fix it.
Mamba mia is in Hollywood.
Oh, you already had that on?
I'll do whatever you want.
I like this story.
A little levity here to show that there are a lot of religious crazy people out there.
That's what's wrong with America today is crazy.
Put it on the right religious people.
That's why you got to bushmeister.
And I also want to say this.
I watched five minutes of eat the press yesterday, and I wanted to vomit, even worse than having
some bad seem.
Oh, good God.
Talk about totally selling out.
And there's David Broder and Ron Brownstein and this other panel of lunatics and Tim
Russell.
They're sitting around talking about these great nominations of bushes made of these
very strong people.
John Bolton and Paul Wolfowitz.
And I'm thinking to myself, that's the end.
That's the infinite, nobody to be.
Here's the key to the kingdom.
We'll see you later.
Man, it is a scary.
Rick says, my favorite Italian restaurant is Rosanella.
Rosanella's Lincoln Road South Beach and in Miami, the great Ville Parme, the greatest
Ville Parme in the world.
Well, Ville Parme, Rick with all the respect, I like it, but that's, you know, that's
goy shit.
But anyway, it's kind of like America to tell you.
But anyway, it's definitely going to go under Rosanella's.
You got it.
Got it.
I'm Lincoln Road South Beach and in Miami, the greatest Ville Parme John.
I love Ville Parme John.
I think it could be voted Italy.
I don't know if I have Ville Parme John.
I guess so.
I guess.
Here's a facts story from Michigan town, Indiana.
Could it be Satan?
A central Indiana pet shop owner says a turtle that was the only animal to survive in
October fire has developed an image of Satan's face on a shell.
Oh, my God.
Brian Dora says it looks like the devil wants us to know that he was there.
Dora says he can see a goatee and a pair of pointy horns on the shell of the Palm
sized, radioed, slider turtle named Lucky.
He says Lucky is self-hearing.
Its behavior hasn't changed and basically it is couldn't determine the cause of the
fire which destroyed the Adora bull pet shop.
Got that Adora bull pet shop and several other businesses in Frankfurt about 40 miles
north west of Indianapolis.
Dora has produced a DVD of the turtle story that he plans through auction on the internet.
He'll also offer the winning bidder the chance to buy Lucky off line.
Wow.
It's just like that turtle.
A turtle with the image of Satan's face on a shell that survived the fire.
He is Lucky man.
Make no mistake about it.
I want to live in a country where religion is illegal where it's outlawed and I'm not
talking about China either.
I just don't want any part of this crab.
Crazy people.
The religion is the other one who spew the hate the intolerance.
He stupidity, the stone age mentality and there was the pope again the other day by
the way speaking of an Eden some oxygen or a feeding tube and he's got the Palm Sunday.
He's got the Palm fron and he's making the little bros tiara airing airing the little
across there.
Very can move a dead man in a chair.
That may be good.
I've said it before.
Who's the deadest of them all?
Terry Shabo, Don Eimes or El Papa?
Which one?
Fices.
So we got two different things going today which is good.
I'd rather talk about food any day than this.
Terry Shabo is in a permanent vegetative state.
See, there's no doubt that she's in a permanent vegetative state because she's in Florida.
I think that's what they're talking about.
There's Kendall Coffee again.
What does it mean?
What's the message we need?
Oh God.
19 different judges have already ruled on this in the state of Florida but the grand
standards up there, you're right, win grand standards.
Oh, it's a hot button issue.
It's a right to life.
We can pander those right winners.
We can really, yeah, right.
Great.
And meanwhile piss everybody else off because the polls show the overwhelming majority of
them are even Republicans disagree with this grand stand.
Or I say let's do away with local in the state courts.
Let's just have the federal government decide.
Even the Supreme Court.
They got them in their pocket just like Don Corollion had all them judges in their pocket.
Well, these people, they got everything in their pocket.
Like a bunch of shoplifters.
Their pockets are full.
They got everything in there.
So just you serve everybody else's power.
Forget the Constitution.
Just burn it and throw it away and we'll do whatever the hell we want.
WQA and hello.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you doing, buddy?
Great.
Listen, one of the best, if not the best, is the first called Monday's MUA and B.I.
at BOSC or FES.
Yeah.
They were on Tower Street in Hollywood for eight years.
And now they're just relocated to Daniel right across from Highlight.
OK.
And it's absolutely as they would say in that neighborhood, the bomb.
All right.
Thanks a lot, Kelly.
All right.
Thanks, Neil.
Monday's got it.
Got it.
What's the other place I was thinking of?
It used to be one of our sponsors for a long time.
George would know, but he's not here today.
What the hell was it?
Geez.
That's embarrassing.
It used to be in Tamrak and there was in Fort Lauderdown, but I'm not sure they're still
in business.
What the hell was that place?
It was one of our five sponsors.
The food was sensationaler with Spectacular.
Carol.
Her name was Carolyn.
It was the owner.
From everything you wanted to go in over the place?
In that bizarre?
Yes.
Well, she was very nice.
She was a loved me and she was a sponsor.
Oh, a lot of Tavanette there.
See, I knew it would come back, but I don't know if they're still open or not.
How do we find out?
I guess we'll wait for a collar or a fast before we put a lot of Tavanette back on it,
because they were really great in Tamrak, and they moved before Lauderdale, and I'm
not sure that they were on a beach and I'm not sure they're still there.
Well, we'll find out.
I guess we could put it on there, and then if it gets votes, that would mean it would
still be there, and we can always take it off, right?
Exactly.
Or is that a little bit too much work?
I don't want to like, you know, it came up on Google, so I think it's around.
Yeah, it's in the yellow pages, too.
Is it really?
Lots of Tavanette there.
Outstanding.
Very, very.
In fact, that might be the winner.
Famous of you very, very.
I mean, really sensational.
Not just like, you know, slop, like somebody's Italian joints can be like Franco-Americans
pretty early.
I'm talking about La Tavanette who was really gourmet cuisine, cuisine.
Vineeto is in plantation and in westerns, somebody faxes in.
Thank you so much.
V-I-G-N-E-T-O.
I don't know why I should have to spoil it.
You got the facts, right?
Well, you don't get the facts.
We don't get it.
I got it.
Vineeto.
That sounds pretty good.
I mean, for the name, I say.
You know, it's a good name.
Who might be, I don't know.
We'll find out.
We'll get a bunch of votes out here.
What's we get?
That's why we really have to take the first part of the show on these restaurants.
Show's going to a bunch of stuff out here.
Before I start reading this boring stuff and go back to Terry and these polls, the ABC
poll that shows overwhelming.
America says enough already with his crap, enough of a bull crap.
People are dying all over the world.
They're worried about steroids and terriers.
Many acts, lunatic, ray robbers, plasticity.
You care.
So who I am?
I'm Mo Greene.
I made my phone when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Yo, son, dragon after a tough day, ramen over a fat beast.
Then you need to chill in a Jay Z boy recliner.
You only chair designed by me.
Multiplatinum recording artist Jay Z.
Check this bad boy out.
Yo, be sipping and tripping.
But Jay Z boy recliner's got 24-cat gold cup holders in the armrest.
Big enough to hold eight magos with Cristal, y'all.
And this scene is extra wide.
Just in case you're sure they be outstacked by it.
You're saying, what a baby.
And here's the best part.
The Jay Z boy recliner, just a four position, y'all.
Business, max, relax, and mad pimping.
And dig this.
The platinum Jay Z boy quickly, these four best.
It's perfect for putting our Kelly Day.
He'll off your stage.
Yo, what the?
Jay Z boy recliner's, get paid.
And put one of your crypts today.
10, 46, at 5, 60, WQM.
We got Mulhaw or David and David.
And David Ford.
Geldie and Hollywood Dog Track at 7 to 9.
And at 8, 10 to the clock.
That's our award winning lineup.
Six as it is.
Take it or leave it.
Let's see.
It affects his flavors of Italy and cross-springs.
The best Asobuko you've ever had.
Asobuko is like, I've never had that.
Like, Veele Shank, is that what that is?
I don't know.
Come on.
What about Josh?
You know what that is?
I don't.
Oh.
Asobuko, I think it's Veele Shank.
I'm pretty sure.
That's not the kind of thing I would ever order,
so I have no idea what it is.
What do you know?
I've been in a few Italian restaurants, mister.
Flavors of Italy and cross-springs.
Now, that's right in your neighborhood, Josh.
You've been there?
It's very good, yeah.
How do you like that?
A little too expensive for what I think it is for your taste.
But what about runway 84?
You can't afford to be going there.
I don't think I've been there.
Well, maybe Mulhaw will take you there.
I'll say no to that.
You're saying no to Mulh?
I shame on you, while you.
You really are a hard ass.
Please put Il Bambino.
Is that sounds like a baby root?
Il Bambino.
In Westchester on your pole from Andre.
OK, Andre, you've got a Il Bambino.
You got it?
It's good enough for baby root.
It's good enough for me.
I have no idea whether it's a good place or a bad place.
I don't know.
There you go.
See, Il Bambino.
Lots of going to tell you on it in South Florida.
Although I will say this again, better restaurants in Tampa.
It's not even close, which is why I voted for Donatello
as myself.
And I noticed, even though it's in Tampa,
what does that tell you?
Donatello is already last time I looked at five votes.
And now it's got the five.
1 way 84, 13, Vestatania restaurant.
No pizza joints in Florida.
1 way 84, 13, Il Molina 7,
Margarano 6, Carabas 5.
Donatello's in Tampa's got five.
That's pretty good start, huh?
I'm bigger, pardon?
What?
Are you mumbling off a micro-synth or what?
No, not at all.
OK, I might go off, actually.
Macaroni grilled four, Mondis 3,
Mamma Mia's in Hollywood 3.
Veneto's is got one.
Veneto and Lottaveneta's got one.
And he must still be open or else somebody's got a good memory.
Or Rosanella's has so far the big,
just like teen Vincent, they're shut out.
WCWAM, hello.
How are you doing?
I got one for the fall.
Yes, sir.
What do you got?
Randazzo's in Little Italy.
Randazzo's in Little Italy.
OK, thank you.
Randazzo's in Little Italy.
Oh, that's an evil.
Randazzo's in Little Italy.
I mean, Little Italy.
I was wondering where Little Italy was in Miami.
Were you?
Randazzo's Little Italy.
That's the name of it.
Get it.
Were you with it?
We got it.
Have you ever heard that?
No.
No.
I'll be honest with you.
There used to be an Il Molino and Peter's road in the university there,
as you probably know, in plantation.
I don't know what the problem is.
I think there are just too many glamor or something,
because that was an excellent place.
Very, very good.
But long gone, or some other kind of cockamaymy joint there.
Now I have no idea what it is.
I'll tell you what I really do like.
And there's nothing you do with the pool.
And don't be putting it on there, because all you got to do is mention something.
And Josh, he wants to be that two J's man.
It's not a tie in the course before.
That was a good place.
Yeah, it was a great discovery.
Last time I was there.
See, it's good to come back to town.
What's in a great while, not too often?
Find a new restaurant.
It's really good.
Have a nice meal.
Come on here and talk about it.
And then you can tell out.
Americans broadly and strongly disapprove of a federal intervention in the Terry Shivo case
with sizeable majority saying Congress is overstepping its bounds for political gain.
And they are absolutely correct.
The public by 63 to 28% supports the removal of Shivo's feeding tube.
And by a 25-point margin, a post is a law maintaining federal reviewer case.
Congress passed that legislation and President Bush signed it in the wee hours of the morning
today.
As he raced back from his Crawford Texas ranch, deciding this piece of fashets crap in
a law.
That legislative action is distinctly unpopular, not only do 60% oppose it more than 70%,
70% call it inappropriate for Congress to get involved in this way.
And by a law stated 67-19%, most people think the elected officials trying to keep Shivo
alive are doing so more for political advantage than out of concern for her or for the principles
involved.
And once again, they are absolutely correct.
This ABC News poll also finds that the Shivo case is prompted at an enormous level of personal
discussion.
Half of Americans say that as a direct result of hearing about this case, they've spoken
with friends and family members about what they'd want to be done if they were in a similar
condition in a vegetative state like Florida.
Nearly 8-10 would not want to be kept alive.
But you just wait, man.
Randall Terry is coming in town with a six-shooter on his side.
He's going to like chew him off, baby, if they start messing around with poor Terry, if
they start messing with that tube, they already anchored out again.
And she's still alive.
They anchored two about three times already, and she's still alive.
How do you like that?
Even the Celucso would probably be upset about it.
In addition to the majority, the intensity of public sentiment is also on the side of
Shabo's husband, who has fought successfully in the Florida courts 19 judges, by the way
to remove her feeding tube.
An intensity runs especially strongly against congressional involvement.
First, it was steroids.
Now it's Shivo.
What will it be next?
God only knows.
Next, it'll be Italian restaurants.
Here, we got that turtle with Satan on it.
Yeah, that's right.
No more demonic animals.
No more virgin Mary pizzas, included among the 63% of support, removing the feeding tube,
are 42% who strongly supported twice as many as those who strongly oppose it.
That's removing.
Among the 70% of the clock in congressional intervention, inappropriate, are 58% of all
that we use strongly, and especially high level of strong opinion.
In other words, the bush might do this time and Tom Delay, all you other right-wing lunatics.
And by the way, what were the Democrats?
They were all busy with their Palm Sunday and holding their Palm Fries or holding something.
They couldn't screw you back enough, fast enough.
You know, it wasn't important enough.
Except for Bobby Wexler and a few others.
Nice going, Air Bobby.
I say Bobby Wexler for president.
Oh!
Of course we don't want no two to be president.
He wouldn't give too many votes in the South.
Although he's sure as a lot better than Jew Lieberman, right?
Right.
Talk about wimping your way on.
Just amazing.
Let's see.
Capricchio, University Insurance Street, Belizema Food and Amnesty, it says here.
Capricchio, is that the one that deported the spot for?
I don't know.
A horrible spot where he was doing all that goethe, a tannin' area with it.
Rister Rante's, Talliani, yeah.
That's it.
Capricchio.
So even though deported the spot don't hold out against the joint because evidently it's
very, very good coin to Josh.
Is it?
Yeah, it's good.
Not great.
Had a quit.
Right.
Oh, no.
Wait a minute.
Now that's bad.
First you started off, I said it was very good.
Then it was good.
Now it's adequate.
I never dropped a very good in there.
I said it was good.
Yeah, you didn't trust me.
I know what I said.
I said it was good.
You said it was good.
Now you said we went from good to adequate.
You can't deny that, right?
Same thing.
Remember Al Pacino standing out there waving a hanky adequate.
Yeah.
That's all you're doing to Capricchio, man.
These are people that sponsor it on a station with D-fo doing the spot.
So Ripman asked, PS, why do you prefer to live under a British style parliamentary system?
You continue to knock the people that developed it over hundreds of years.
Well, what does that mean?
What does that mean?
Yeah, I live here because of the parliament.
That's why I live here.
Well, what kind of a knucklehead wrote this crap?
Grumpy Graham, 23-year-listener, even when you were serious and straight.
Oh, I was never straight.
You're fairy.
Anyway, it says, I know you won't read all this as a conflict with your preconceived ideas, but I tried.
Oh, I see.
I agree the weather sucks into many of the proletariat, but if you visit the UK,
oh, this is not what I was trying to get.
I'm not even reading this.
I don't want to know nothing about the UK.
You silly ass brits.
I don't care.
Go have some toad in the hole and get it out of my face.
It's kind of new with close minded.
I've encountered more damn brits, especially the ones in Amsterdam.
And the ones at the Heathrow Airport, which I never leave that airport and doesn't leave in the country.
Here's one book of the Beppo.
So I've heard of that.
Steve from Nashville says,
Book of the Beppo,
BUCA, small DDI,
capital BEPPO, book of the Beppo.
I just like the name.
What is this thing with the facts on?
Is this like some kind of a design?
Or is this just a bad fast?
What is this?
Does it look wrinkly?
Yeah.
Oh, it's something wrinkled up.
Yeah.
Well, you ought to see how it came out.
It looks like something photographic here.
Really?
Let's see.
Here's one that says,
I used to be local wine and liquor rep.
Runway 84 was my account for four years in the 90s.
I went there every Tuesday in mid-autumn to see the owner get his weekly liquor and wine order.
Every week, oh yeah, that's right.
Every week there was a table in the back of the dining room surrounded by old fat guys
right out of good fellows.
They would always be sipping espresso and sembuca and smoking big cigars.
These are the same guys who were there when I ate there a couple of times, sitting around the bar
with the astrite jackets and the big hats, the fedoras.
Like he says, something out of the good fellows, something out of the godfather.
That it says here in this fact, the hypocrisy of Republicans, if Republicans are such godloving Christians,
why do they hate poor people and why do they protect the environment?
Could it be that they're intolerant, evil liars?
Absolutely.
I'm just going to stress this might be it.
Pally, the roasted pepper and pepper pines, let's see, I don't like that name for an Italian restaurant.
It says one of the best.
Fantastic food.
General, see it means generous, but it says,
is general portions, remember general portions?
Yeah.
He said, I will be turned.
Great atmosphere, great service, not cheap.
Oh, and Josh and Miguel Encona, plus Moe is buying.
Now let me ask you, would you go to runway 84 with Moe Josh if Moe is buying or if he got a freebie for it?
No.
No.
Now that's awful, but you are really hard-ass and I get all this crap about it.
It's always back to me, see I take all the grief.
You are a food, that's what it is.
What is it?
You take it.
It says, don't go to the pepper if you want factory Italian food and evening at the pepper, the roasted pepper as well with the dining experience, says Ray and Coral Springs.
PBS, if you really want some shy voe lunch, listen to the audio feed on the slide.
You know, I tried listening to the audio feed on the slide report and it just takes me to another website that has nothing to do with this.
It says, why don't they tell you that she's been moaning like that for years?
Oh, she is.
Woo!
Kind of like Eric does up there in the land.
Oh, woo!
Like that, yeah.
Ever see Eric and Terry Chabbo together?
Oh, same person.
Hey Eric, you better be nice to one at the dude with your job on that website.
We're taking the two bouts.
Let them cut the crap.
It's just amazing.
They really misread the public on this one, baby.
And of course, you know, that's good.
Randall Terry, resurface, all we can say to that is,
Oh my God.
By the way, your son, you fairy.
That's all we can say to him.
You are listening to Neil Rogers.
It's a good listening to him.
On 566.
Thank you, A.
Oh.
Don't want your show.
This is your boy.
Any question?
I'm at C.C.A.
What's better than a live radio show every morning on TV?
Well, just about anything.
But that hasn't stopped MSNBC from teening up with radio's original bad boy.
Who now looks like an SD old lady.
Listen, Bernie, I'm a...
Tell that intern this coffee sucks.
Yes, every morning C.I.M.S.
Listen to a tape of other people's caroliness.
Why, by the air?
I did a hammer to bite into this muffin.
Somebody had passed a crush on Blade like this.
See his wild behind the scenes at it.
I am the mate, David.
I am the I.M.A.
You are a walrus, cook coconut shoe.
Now, get me some fresh coffee or your fire.
I.M.S.
He's irreverent.
So, what's the deal with the phone?
He's topical.
What's the deal with his watergate?
He's incoherent.
I'll tell you why.
That's...
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
He's...
I.M.S.
He's...
And he's only on M.S.N.B.C.
A cable channel.
Nobody watches.
And a bunch of A.M. radio stations.
Nobody listens to him.
And then somebody gets some fresh jingles.
It's...
I.M.S.
Dead man in a chair.
It's 11.02.
Let's...
Now, let me ask you this question.
You've both been in Vegas, right?
Oh, yeah.
No.
You have not been to Las Vegas?
You know, your...
Your existence is so limited.
It's a miracle.
Have you ever go back to Chicago since you were born there?
Yes.
Oh, and that at least is good.
That's a great town.
With good food, by the way.
Yes, very good food.
And how...
And before I get into the thing about Vegas,
how come Orlando, with all the tourists that go there?
I guess because it's a tourist trap.
How come we never hear about any great restaurants in the Orlando area?
Do we?
I mean, Tampa's got great places.
Yeah, but Orlando's only known for like Disney World or Disney, you know?
It's a tourist trap, like I said.
Hey, Bargo, there's over there.
Anyway, get back to Vegas where Miguel's never been,
which means it's Josh's call.
I always have a brain fart in this place.
It's right next to...
It's between the Luxor and New York, New York.
Because you know, it looks like Disney World on the corner there.
Well, New York, New York is on the corner,
but right across the street from it, okay?
Uh, MGM is right across the street.
No, on the other side, across on the other side, there's...
Oh, brother, you're brutal.
Next to the Luxor, you know the pyramid?
I know.
Okay, the one that looks like Disney World,
it's right across, right next to the Luxor on that corner.
The Mirage?
Then the Mirage is on that corner.
Mirage is waiting...
How the strip?
Jesus!
God Almighty!
And you went through it, huh?
Anyway, there's a tiny restaurant in this place.
Don't go there.
In fact, don't go that way.
I've got a...
For years, I've had a brain fart.
I've been in here many times.
I have no idea why.
But to do not even the tiny restaurant in that place.
Wow, that is so bad.
In fact, that whole place.
You've got to know what I'm talking about.
How's it going to do?
The Mirage.
Four years.
What was the last time you were in Vegas in May?
And I'm going again in May.
Yeah.
Well, when you're there, take a look, okay?
You've got to know what I'm talking about.
It's got the Spires.
It looks like an amusement park.
Looks like Disney World.
We've got a bunch of calls right now.
They might know.
No, I'd rather Brown beat Josh.
He's been there.
No, I don't know what to tell you.
Of course, so have I a million times, too.
So who the hell am I to talk?
But I'm a people old fart, you know?
Right.
WQA, I'm Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
I'd like to give you my video and a Thai restaurant.
Yes, sir.
Go ahead.
Parkland, cafe Bellacera.
The chef's there was 17 years at Runway 84.
Open your phone restaurant.
Cafe Bellacera.
Bellacera Parkland.
Okay, I like it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Okay, got a cafe Bellacera, B-E-L-A, Capital S-E-R-A.
I had got it.
Bonacera.
What would you mean you got it?
Like you're an Italian expert all of a sudden?
No, you don't got it.
You know, help me out with spelling for every Italian restaurant.
Bellacera.
I just like salmon.
WQA Am Hello.
Welcome Italian and Steve the Hust.
WQA Am Hello.
The circus, the circus, buddy.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Don't eat there by the way.
It's horrible.
Circus, circus, isn't it?
No, it's not.
It's not right anyway.
That's not it.
I went bungee jumping in circus.
That's circus, circus.
I was agree with them already.
That's not circus.
Circus is way down the strip in the other direction.
You idiot you.
Jesus.
God Almighty.
You see how easy I am because even if they sit there,
I don't think I'm adventurous.
How am I circus?
Circus.
I don't know where you're getting like it.
It looks like a Disney world kind of thing.
When you hear the name of the place,
you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.
That's exactly what it looks like.
It looks like a castle like a Disney-esque castle in place.
Jesus, what's wrong with you, man?
Oh, I know this.
You're not going to know that.
No, I guess.
I got to think about it.
You know the one I'm talking about.
I do.
Now I know exactly.
There's four corners there, okay?
There's four corners.
The MGM Grand is on the one corner.
And I can't even think also that one across the street
where I always win money.
See, my mind is gone.
The Rhapsody restaurant used to be in there too.
I just have been in the Himalayan Vegas in three or four years.
You old.
Crime old in the casino.
Cross the street is New York, New York on one corner.
And across from that right between New York, New York,
and the Luxor is, you know what?
I don't know.
I don't know the name though.
But you can see it.
I know exactly.
Yes, because you said castle.
It looks exactly like a Disney.
Right.
That's it.
Like you see in Disney World, that kind of castle light for kids.
It's a punky place where people with little kids,
just like that circus circus that guys talking.
They can take circus circus and blow it right out there.
But Nana's kitchen and Davy,
it says his awesome Italian provisional race says,
he got a Nana, N-O-N-N-A, Nana's kitchen.
Oh, well, they're just pouring in now.
Would somebody please tell me the name of that book?
Because, you know, please, I'm having a nervous breakdown.
Even Josh is starting to give the EBGBs.
He's going crazy over there.
Please add, cat, they preem up pasta.
North Miami beats your pulse.
A small hard place to find.
Well worth it.
Says Elmer.
In honor of today's poll,
could you please play the Olinda Made?
So, Olinda Made, that's Italian.
So, I'm hearing.

yesterday after a bad losing day at the Tracks,
I don't wonder he's looking, trying to be an optimist,
looking forward to a better week.
Hey, I'm sure you're familiar with Anthony Calliando,
the main man at acceptance capital mortgage,
so before you call it any other mortgage company,
let the main man tell you what you don't know.
Did you know that most banks only work
with three different mortgage products?
And if your credit's less than absolutely perfect,
that's absolutely.
You're ready to hear the most famous,
two-letter word in the English language,
that's the one.
If you're not working with the right lender,
the chances of getting approved are 50-thitty at best.
So do yourself a favor, call right now,
and do the right thing, call one, AAA-483 loan.
That's one, eight, eight, eight, four, eight, three,
loan, and let the main man in his team
put you into a mortgage that meets your needs.
A boy going to the wrong lender
or maybe being turned down because you called the wrong number,
call the main man, Anthony Calliando,
at acceptance capital mortgage, tool free,
one, eight, eight, eight, four, eight, three, loan.
That's one AAA-483 loan.
Every time they close a loan,
a person is donated to kids in the stress-two.
So why call anybody else, avoid the bait and switch,
get the best deal going anywhere at the best rates,
call the main man, today, one, AAA-483-L-O-A-N.
You're listening to meaningful,
needle-runchers exclusively on 560-1-A-N.
It's day, with Miami Town,
at 560-W-Q-A-N.
You ferry.
What the hell?
Don't lie.
All the hard-burnt.
Don't stop, stop.
Every time I see.
Don't stop, stop.
That pre-tired, if he wins.
Don't stop, stop.
Call my TV.
He's president of S**t-O-R.
Republicate muscle-ins.
And in our table, it's idiotic.
I don't know why they want this hell,
but now he's too scared to swim to death for you.
Or the president of S**t-O-R.
Or what I get to,
go vote on small,
and get the weird-o-voted ball.
What you do want,
if you want this?
Don't stop, stop.
It's running stupidly.
Don't stop, stop.
And this drunky bitch here.
Don't stop, stop.
He's even tougher than me.
He's president of S**t-O-R.
Yeah, don't care what it is.
It got him in by her front row.
The Christian right,
no one's better than you and I,
but have no fear.
We've got a great leader here.
It's president of S**t-O-R.
He often had panic.
President of S**t-O-R.
Now the interesting thing,
one of many other interesting things is poor,
is that it says Republicans overall look
much like Democrats and Independents
in their opinions on this.
It was much more the religious, fanatical,
the religious right, the crazy nuts,
the flat earth crowd.
Everyone's thinking,
this is a great idea.
And speaking of that,
guess who said it later today?
He's saying, oh, we got to get that tube back in a Terry.
I'll give you a guess.
Dead man in a dress.
The Coke.
Oh, okay.
The Vatican newspaper,
it's not the Don Animes.
The Vatican newspaper today,
criticized the removal of that feeding tube
from brain damage, Florida.
Nobody can claim the right to decide
whether a human being lives or dies.
Who can before God and humanity
pretend with impunity to claim such a right
Losservatoria Romano said,
who and on the basis of which criteria
can establish to whom the privileged deliver should be given?
The remarks from the Vatican paper,
which reflected earlier comments
from several Vatican prelates,
the ex-caliber, huh?
I got a brain for it on that.
Anyway,
came after the US Congress passed a lot
in emergency session,
giving Terry Shire was parents
the right to file suit in federal court.
Over the withdrawal of nourishment
and medical treatment need to sustain their daughter.
President Bush,
as we know, has signed the bill.
Oh, my God.
Came rushing back from proper Texas
in the wee hours of the morning
to sign the bill
an unconstitutional illegal piece of crap
in which the federal government,
which Congress and I'll president here
trying to overrule the courts.
Who can judge the dignity and sacredness
of a life of a human being
made in the image and like this of God?
Who can decide to pull the plug
as if we were talking about a broken
or out of order household appliance, the paper said?
In Miami Hospital,
as a woman who's about to die from a hunger and thirst,
there's the slow dying of a person not a vegetable,
which is an important world,
which an important world is witnessing
through TV and newspapers.
That's impotent, important.
The 41 year old woman's feeding
two bas removed Friday as we know, yoddy, yoddy, yoddy.
The newspaper said that the case is shaking America.
Aren't you shaking from it already?
Well, we're shaking.
But added that in the ongoing debate,
the lowest level political controversy
in the subtle game of legal tricks
often end up in prevailing.
Of course, they know about legal tricks
there at the Vatican.
How's that Vatican banking scandal coming on?
Is that guy still hanging from that rope?
Probably.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 10.
I mean, we're all supposed to be whipped up
and we're friends about this, okay?
First like I said last week,
it was steroids in baseball.
We're all supposed to be like hyperventilating
about that, and now we're supposed to be just
foaming at the mouth about Terry Shival.
Just like alienito.
I told you then, I'll tell you now,
the media are a bunch of lunatics,
a bunch of grave robbers,
and it's the hysterical story du jour.
I don't give a crap about Terry Shival.
How do you like that?
Long way or the other?
I do give a crap about what
this political shenanigans
went on over the weekend.
Because that's a part for the course.
You got, like I've been telling you,
you got a bunch of religious lunatics
who've taken over the country.
There is no more Republican party.
We have the Born Again Fundamentalist
lunatic party and the weak need Democrats.
Most of whom couldn't be bothered
to show up and get involved in this except Bobby.
You're actually in a handful of others.
Weak need, man.
You have to Nazis are stormtrooping up
and down Pennsylvania Avenue and then
Democrats are there are good schluffin
as the Chinese say.
They're in a deep coma.
Kind of like Terry, their brain dead.
W.A.M. Hello.
Oh, me?
Yes, sir.
Yes, I am.
Hey, how are you doing?
OK.
Do you have cops with the angel on the phone?
We've heard of it.
Now we don't.
It's a little highway right across
from Baby Catalan.
OK.
Stockton have little plots of back there.
Right.
Very good.
And big Louis sucks, by the way.
OK, well, we don't want to put the ones that suck on.
Oh, I said that as well.
Thanks very much.
Is he talking about a place where God had
and no about big Louis?
You hear me, Louis?
No, no.
Casa de Angelo.
Hey, listen, you never even heard the ex-caliber.
What the hell do you know about life?
Hey, I've seen it.
Don't don't go there.
And definitely, I mean, you can get on that thing.
They got a little walkway now across.
As you know, the other side of the street.
Right.
Yeah.
Well, skip that.
When New York, New York is fun.
And they got like a.
What is it?
It's New York, New York, New York.
Well, you don't want to agree?
No, OK.
New York, New York is the best hotel in Las Vegas.
That's right.
Josh Cortes.
That's right.
It's my biggest expert.
How many times have you been there?
Coming up on three.
So you've been there twice.
Right.
But I got a lot done in those two times, two times.
No, but you did.
Probably downtown.
5.670560, pound 560 and a Verizon and Singular Wireless
Lines.
Have you ever stayed at the MGM grand?
I have.
And you like New York, New York better?
Yes.
You know what?
I just like New York, New York, New York,
like what's inside, like whatever.
I just like that.
OK, great.
We'll sing it.
Have you ever been inside Paris?
No.
Well, see, when you say the best hotel, I mean,
maybe the accommodations, maybe the rooms are great.
But to me, you know, it's nice to have a nice room.
But when you're in Vegas, how much time
you spend in the room?
Very, very little, right?
I don't mean necessarily like the room.
I mean, I have a room.
No, but I'm saying in the hotels.
That's the only one I mean.
Have you ever been in Paris?
No.
So how can you judge?
Have you been in the Venetian?
Absolutely.
Have you been in the, what is it?
The one with the B?
See, my mind is blank.
It's just a...
Bellagio.
Bellagio, there you go.
Yeah, I've been in there.
Bellagio is really nice.
Really nice.
But it's overrated though.
I mean, once you see those big fancy pictures on the wall,
I mean, the water is pushing in front, you know,
that's nice too.
But you want to see what?
Much of water is pushing into the bowl.
Yeah, after the first time, it's old.
Yeah.
The Mirage.
Seasers?
Seasers is neat.
Seasers?
Cool.
Not a good place to gamble, but it's a fabulous neat place
with a lot of great shops.
Excellent restaurants, by the way.
They got a fantastic Italian restaurant.
What's it called in Seasers?
They've got two of them.
They go on, it's like more informal.
Then they got the one where you have the big feast.
What the hell's that one called?
See, if you're going to...
Anything that requires recoil today,
forget about it.
My mind is so fried from this Terry Shrivel business.
But you remember the name of the Italian place
in that caliber?
You don't.
No.
Okay.
Well, there's only one.
Right.
And it is kaka.
It's kind of like the red lobster of Italian food.
Does that tell it all?
Yes, it does.
Okay.
It's bad.
It's really bad.
Even the goyem though, like it.

The Siamese Highway is so wonderful.
The Siamese Highway is just a small town on the right.
It's worth a little boy's life.
One of the left-line fans though, you don't have to get on the weirdo.
So, some of the customers follow you as soon.
But I'm not sure.
Some of the left-stores.
Yes, it was laid before again this morning.
I mean, 85K, Joe, your guess is unbelievable.
Yeah, he's laid in.
Yeah, are you watching it?
Yes.
I've now appeared as a wobbling house in Santa Maria Cooke.
Now he helped by two of his...
A big issue in front of the judge today.
The judge is deciding.
The nation of Islam is in half bodyguards.
But the big umbrella, of course.
Santa Shining, but he's got the big umbrella.
He will be allowed to be heard by the jury.
And he could have a huge impact on the case once again.
Michael Jackson is on trial for child monster.
No, come on.
Can you see the end?
Yeah.
Oh, what do you expect?
That's Russia's wife now.
That's Darren Kagan, you know?
Oh, that was on the sand.
The brains are melting.
In fact, the Herzereval cortex is a liquid just like Terry.
Hope that she's going to make this big comeback.
And she's very vibrant and July.
And it could have her sitting in a wheelchair right there in Congress.
And she could be going...
But it would have been...
It would have probably put on a better performance than Ilyana Rosanna Dana.
Oh.
We can't see him much.
Potential victims.
Might.
I don't like that.
So we just wobbled again.
He's putting on the sick act like the old mafia Don's used to doing all of that.
Although at least you don't have his PGs on it.
That's a good sign.
Into the courtroom.
After the metal wands.
Yeah, we got your metal wand all right there.
And that's where we're going to put it.
We'll see if the judge gets all that out of shape in Piotta about this.
Wouldn't that be great if he threw his ass in the slamer?
Wonderful.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
We're looking for the best Italian restaurant in the state of Florida outside of no pizza joints.
We'll do that a separate day.
It's the best of this week.
Why not?
Huh?
That's a positive thing for that idiot thanking me this crap last week.
You're so negative.
And you call Joseph Gackie old P-face.
Which he is.
What?
Well, I can't say the P word, but you know what the word is.
No.
You call him the weenie face.
W-E-Q-A-M, hello.
Hey, Neil, how's it going?
All right, Pali.
I got a brilliant Italian restaurant for you in the hall of Hollywood.
Yeah.
Fulvios.
Oh, I've heard of that.
I never ate there by a whole different town.
Fulvios.
Fulvios.
You got to try and excite me down.
And I don't have anybody touched on this shit.
If Bush would have argued up to 9-11, maybe some metal would have happened, except for this one person.
Yeah, I didn't push anybody any hard.
But the Christ say he sent that person for eight minutes looking like an idiot.
But he was on the plane for this woman, you know, in a matter of...
What kind of crap is that?
Well, he just finished listening to that record act naturally.
And that's why he said they're looking like an idiot.
Have a great day, Pali, and calm down.
Fulvios is excellent, but some told.
Oh, yeah.
Did you not catch that or...
Catch what?
I had to dump it.
What did he say?
Everday?
Or something.
I didn't hear that.
Yeah.
Well, so you both got it.
So what's the big deal?
I didn't hear it.
We'll just let him go.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, sure you will.
Oh, look at this.
There's that big fat, Denny Hasdard.
Chartered waters to change Shivoh's fate insist their following the spirit of the Constitution,
not politics.
Right.
Oh, yeah.
Bill Fist, a Frist, who's a real phony baloney right wing, born again, Bible thumping piece
of turd.
Who had an oboe or two because he's a doctor.
He denounced an unsigned memo circulated with public lawmakers over the weekend calling
the Shivoh case a great political issue, replete with talking points in a whole song
of dance about how great this was going to be.
Frist said he hadn't seen the memo and said I can tend the content of the memo and reaffirm
that the interest in this case by myself and the many members of the Senate on both sides
of the aisle is to sure that Mr. Shivoh has another chance at life.
Right.
Oh, yeah.
Let's dig up Marlon Brando and see if we can't bring him back to life.
At least he was a great actor.
At least a lot of people liked him.
Yeah.
He has got no chance at life.
She's not living a life.
In some cases, like this one, we see it most historically.
Democrats stung from a series of electoral losses among social conservatives by a large
biting their tongue.
Yeah, they're biting their tongue.
In other words, as usual, they're sitting back there.
They're mumbling.
They're biting their tongue instead of showing some cahons.
Thank God for Bobby Wexler, man.
You, the man, Bobby.
One of the very few guys, whether it was the war, whether it's this issue, he always
is there opening up a month and telling like it is whether it was the paper ballot,
the paper trail and the ballots in the election.
Robert Wexler, man, there's one of the few great Americans that say that right now,
whether it's a few politicians worth his salt.
WQAM, hello.
WQAM, hello.
Yes, sir.
The calibers are filthy dumb.
It's across the street from the top of Canada where you want to go.
Trappercan, where arrested it used to be, but it's no longer there, right?
I used to say it in New York, New York, it's very good, but it used to go across the street at the MGM.
That's the place.
But let me reiterate, if you cross that mode of the Excalibur, that's where people blow their garbage, please.
They have no problem.
Okay, amen.
The Excalibur blow, as I told you, is that?
And this guy said that New York, New York is good, but MGM was very obvious.
He didn't even have to say it.
That's the place.
You know, they were your like it.
You know, it's all within walking distance anyway.
It's all good.
It's all good.
It's all good.
Like Bubble would say it's all good.
See, one thing when you go to Vegas unless you're on moron, you're not going to stay in a home.
You know, where you stay is fine.
In fact, out on not the outskirts so much, but like off the main strip,
there are some very nice little inexpensive places you can stay that don't have a casino.
Really?
Yeah, like sweets.
I don't get the fun in that, though.
The fun in that is that you rent a car.
You park your car right in front of the joint.
Instead of having to go through the, you know, it looks like you're in a car.
You rent a car when you go there?
No, I just walk.
Well, you know what it's like having to find your car or get valet when you're in a,
when it's real busy time, which is most of the time in Vegas, and spend their waiting and waiting and waiting.
But when you get in one of these little sweets joints, which are very nice, very inexpensively inexpensive,
and you've got your car like in a motel right in front, you hop in it,
and you go to whichever casino you want to plunge your guts out.
That would blow, though, man.
I'd rather...
Why is that?
What?
Take a cab.
What are you going to do?
Like, I made it up the road.
Everything in Vegas is like right there.
I mean, why drive?
So every time you want to go from one place to another, you're going to take a cab.
Yeah, I mean, hey, sir.
That what you're saying?
I understand you're on limited budget.
You know, but when you're talking about, you know, a big shout like me, I'm not taking no cabs.
Here, here I take cabs, because I have a car here.
Remember, whatever, they're all right out right out front of the...
Whatever hotel you're at, you know?
They're waiting for you.
Oh, man.
Here's a fail on Vegas Excalibur.
We got to thank you.
It's a dump. It's a toilet.
People threw their garbage in the moat.
The best Italian restaurant is Spicio.
I'm sure that's spelled wrong.
It's a Spicio.
Can I be right?
It must be Spicio.
It must be Spicio.
SPECIO across the street from Maragazzi in Surfside.
Much, much pasta than Maragazzi.
I guess, much better enough to word out.
Amazing service, the nicest staff anywhere.
Carabas is up by the same people who are only on backstage.
How's Big Chain?
Carabas. Oh, it's a chain.
It's a chain.
I knew that.
Just like La Carreta is a chain.
Oh, man.
I just can't stand that stuff.
You ever eat it? La Carreta?
That's what Miguel has.
Yep.
And is it good?
Of course.
Oh, and what does that mean, of course?
Because it's Cuban food.
Therefore, of course, it's good food.
How bad is Cuban food?
How bad is Cuban food?
You know, if you get a bad Cuban joint, that's bad.
You fry a steak, you make them right, put some beans on it.
So in other words, what you're saying is the same old swills.
What you're saying?
Yeah, what Miguel just said about Cuban food, he said it's crap.
No, it's not, you know.
Much better pasta than a ragazzi.
Specio.
I just, you better look that up.
Look up on the homepage.
And what is it?
It is what it is.
S-P-E-C-C-I-O.
Specio?
C-C-H-I-O.
Oh, Specio.
Specio.
Specio.
Well, they must be talking about McGonia.
Specio.
Okay, whatever the hell it is.
Oh, here's another one that says Carabas.
One by Outbackstake House.
If you like chain rice restaurants like macaroni grill,
with a whimeless right out of Windixi here.
Try it.
Okay, in other words, they're not too big in Carabas.
Well, it was Josh that's given us the Carabas of Pichiri.
You know, Josh who thinks that New York, New York.
See, New York, New York to me, can I use it?
Don't get me wrong, I like it, but there's one word to describe it, okay?
What's that?
Taki.
Taki.
It is taki, yes.
What way?
It just is.
It's just a little bit over.
I like the fact that they got that big,
the amusement park ride out in the opposite way.
Yeah, right out in the right side.
Right, that's nice.
And it's a good roller coaster.
I don't go to Vegas to go to a roller coaster.
You've got to tell me it's not like it's...
Are you going on the roller coaster in Las Vegas?
You'll lunatic it?
Damn, right?
I am.
It's a good one.
You went bungee jumping.
He's just out of puberty.
You know, he's just past childhood.
What do you expect?
Thank you.
I ought to go to Circus Circus.
That's right up your alley.
That's where they have all the pain in the ass kids running around.
That's where no adult wants to go into a place like that.
No, I'm good.
The ex-caliber is next to...
I do want to just stand next to the luxury.
How many times have I said that?
I'm ready to go.
Get out here with that.
Come on, Che Dice.
Come on Che Dice.
Come on.
Now, I thought that meant...
How do you say that?
Come on Che Dice.
And that one Michael said that when he was talking to him...
When sitting at the table in Louise in the Bronx, huh?
That's correct.
Come on Che Dice.
Carabas is in the Albertsons' place.
Oh, no, where El Malino's was in plantation.
They put a shame in there.
What a shame for a shame where El Malino's was.
I mean, El Malino's there were two of them, but that's not a shame.
Also for the list, no, no, no.
Not pizza joints.
Okay, well, put the other one you got on here when we do pizza.
And Louise in the Bronx, you see that?
And the steroids conracial meeting lasted longer than one of the Godfather with Don Ticcio.
Five, six, seven, oh, five, sixteen, Don Ticcio wasn't in the meeting by the way.
Pound five, six, ten, they've risen and sing it around Islam.
But these people, you know, they're all experts.
They're taking advantage of me because it's an off day.
My mind is, my cerebral cortex is like jello.
I keep thinking about Bill Cosby all day. It's like jello.
This is why I couldn't think of the ex-caliber.
The Rosewood Grillo, I remember, was his very unusual because that's the one I can never think of the name of.
Did you ever eat there?
No.
Well, why not? Well, where is it?
Much too expensive for you.
It's down the street of a piece.
It's like in the middle of a strip.
Kind of like a cross from the Caesars and the Marajanet area.
Okay, no, I had one on the other side.
Rosewood Grillo, great.
You walk in here, you say, how do your lobster?
They got a huge tank, which is not that unusual, but I mean they got great lobsters.
Pretty good stakes.
Not as good as Ruth's crystal.
There's two fabulous Ruth's christened vagus.
Two of them. That's just one. Great.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Huh? Where are they at?
I'll just want on. I don't know. Remember where they were at?
And I was on Flamingo, I think.
Look at up any yellow pages when you go there already.
Okay, there's sensational.
I'm telling you, man.
The Ruth christened here and the two out there in Vegas are his and shoulders above.
And I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

Listen up babe, we got this net buff kiss thing here.
It makes style up look like a sloth with F-steen, bar scaling-accentogwin gravity foods.
I mean, yeah, Dennis, Dennis, not bad, but could you stick closer to the script?
And the name of the service is net zero.
Dennis Miller for net zero, take two.
If you have 56k modemodes as fast as the final chapter of a manual cons critique of

I understand.
Yo, Dennis, Dennis, uh.
What's that?
Right idea, but could you read the copy you have in front of you and just as a reminder,
it's net zero.
Dennis Miller for net zero take three.
The difference between net not and dial up is like the difference between instant copy

It's otherwise known as the line of Starbucks.

Oh, yeah, Jones, see, love Tim has zogged and strange love.
Provinces to Loon and this is reading great speaking of slime balls like Dennis Miller.
Uh, to a Michael motorcycle, he leaves the board, uh, limping in that or nearly keeping
the whole thing out of big bottle of clean acting, sobbing his territory as a table.
He's basically stoned off his ass.
What are you?
How you like that?
Oh, boy.
Miguel Marquez and San Maria, California with the latest on Michael Jackson and his condition.
Thank you.
No, yeah, and his condition, thank you.
And they're like, uh, it's for real.
They're all we did say you looked the stone off his ass, something like that.
Here's the fact that says my friends and I have enjoyed La Verranda restaurant for many
many years.
La Verranda got it.
He got it.
It's located in Palpinot, 21 21 East Atlantic.
Franco and Pietro have owned and run the restaurant for at least 20 years.
Grateful, a really good service.
Modern prices really attractive.
Uh, and one of these things is pulling away, which either means it's a great place or
it's, uh, we're getting a free.
P.S.D.
Excalibur blows chunks.
I wouldn't take a cop there.
Every family that wants to take their bread and kids to Vegas needs to stay there and
leave the rest of us alone.
My favorite place is to gamble and hang out in no particular order.
Rio suites, that's the one I was trying to pick up, but I can't think of anything with
even my own name.
Uh, I've stayed there a couple of times, Rio suites.
It's like on Harman Avenue.
Remember Donnie Harman Avenue?
Nope.
You've never seen, see, this business of, have you ever been downtown?
Well, what's downtown like?
Ah!
See, when you have a rented car, you go way out in the city.
In the mountains, you see all the new developments, the housing, you see the, uh, the, the surrounding
part of the city, which is incredible.
What do you think, Tony?
A lot of the time, yes.
When you listen to me, you drive downtown, which you don't want to gamble there, but
at least I don't.
But you, you see, all those places downtown are cool to nugget all those very famous
places.
You get around.
And if you, you know, I will grant you this, if you're going to drive on the strip,
and you better off, uh, just walking because you can't go anywhere.
Exactly.
But when you learn the back roads, like the roads that parallel the strip, it's a piece
of cake.
I mean, if I want to go from the MGM, grants us a seizure system for quite a while out,
and maybe the weather is not that great, maybe it's raining one of those three days
of year.
Maybe it's one of those dust storms, who knows what, maybe it's just lazy.
I don't want to feel like taking a cab, you drive down there, you do a little valley
park, quick in and out, then you go to someplace else.
Well, how many times have you been there?
Who?
You?
Me?
Oh, I would say.
About 30 minutes.
At least, probably more than that.
Well, compared to two times.
Exactly.
But I'm trying to get him a little advice.
He's a hard ass.
Like, oh no.
He's a hard, who want to rent a car?
Why not?
Not really.
It's not really interesting.
Yeah, like, it's not like I know my way around Vegas.
Like, I know Las Vegas Boulevard because I know they, let me tell you something.
I know this is going to come as a tremendous shock because somebody who just discovered body
worse.
They have these amazing things when you go to a new city, it's called maps.
Unamaka.
Oh, I don't want to toggle my head with that.
I want to go just walk.
You don't want to toggle your head looking at a map.
Look, I want to walk up and down the street.
Right guys, stick with the taxis, OK?
Right.
Man, don't want to boggle your mind with that.
I mean, Vegas is a very, there's nothing complicated about driving in Vegas.
The strip is like North and South in the middle of everything.
Everything runs off of there.
Trapecan Avenue and everything runs off of it.
Well, there you go.
No, there you go.
For the poll, Joe, John Helmail beats his capella ragazzi in Surfside.
You got it, capella ragazzi, the children.
He's one of my four words in Italian, ragazzi.
Rio suites all.
I forgot to read the rest of his letters.
Sam's town, Santa Fe, Harris.
Trapecan of poolside.
The Trapecan, I either win a lot of money in there, I lose my ass.
Nothing in between.
They have what I call the rubber room in the Trapecan with a high end of the high plane
slots, two and five dollar machines, the rubber room.
I've had some days really great near and some days forget about it.
Ballies, Texas and Boulder Pass.
Sam's town.
That's another topic of the Sam's town.
I thought all the old parts go in on the bus to Sam's town.
I don't know.
But don't judge until you know what you're talking about.
You have learned one thing.
You will not be going to the ex-caliber, especially to eat.
Did you ever go inside there?
No.
Don't.
No.
Oh, this thing about, I guess I'll get to it in the next hour.
I'm just Terry Shivold out.
You know what?
I mean, what are we supposed to be most iconic about?
Steroids in baseball, Terry Shivold or Michael Jackson?
What about?
Part of the screen.
Yeah.
I just don't have enough emo.
Maybe that's why I'm off my feet with them.
I'm dream to be emotional after all these traumatic things that are going on around us.
Just bringing me down.
W.A.K.
Y.A.
Hello.
Yeah.
Terry Shivold was a palli and she said her favorite restaurant was right.
Her name does end in a vowel.
W.A.K.
Y.A.
Hello.
Oh, God.
Yes, sir.
Hey, I want to thank you for changing my life my way around.
She brought me to body wash.
I was a little embarrassed.
I had to say to go get my dog.
Butch up a little palli.
Don't be embarrassed.
Don't be a woose.
Well, they had that big poopy thing on there.
And for her, listen to me.
I've bought probably, I don't know how many bottles.
Body wash over the last three, four years since I've been using it.
I don't know where you guys are shopping, but I don't see big poopy things on any of the
bottles that I buy.
They'll be the same call.
I mean, I don't think I'll ever pick up another bar, so four jobs of one.
So, again.
Good.
I got them from the bull.
Pop them out for the baby.
Get the dinner, baby.
There you go.
The price is right.
Let's see.
Rosewood real moved next door to the MGM about two years ago.
Still great.
How do you like that?
I have been there in two years and I will never go back to Vegas.
Not that I don't like it, but it's just what's the point?
It's too far.
Unless you live in LA or something, just for me.
It's just too far.
If I want to go and lose my ass or plunge my guts out, I'll hop in a cab and go to wood
vine.
Or when I'm in town, you know, once they get to the slot school, and I'll log in my
car and I'll drive to Pompo-no Park.
Or the Gulf Stream, not.
It says the problem with runway 84 is that they keep you waiting for your table front
to 45 minutes, even if you have reservations.
Not me.
I never waited.
A bunch of mode doesn't wait there, right?
Do do do do do.
In sins of the father, a book I read, did you recommend it?
Oh, that's right.
That is correct.
I mentioned that on the air.
Since I read that book, did you recommend these many years ago?
They'd be for you to run my 84 many times.
Is the venue for high level mob meetings?
It's a great place.
Yeah, well, I mean, that was back in the day.
I'm certain that there are no mob meetings now there.
Are there?
Of course not.
There is a lot of you.
No.
But back in the day, that was mentioned in the book by name.
Anthony's runway 84.
It's a great place to love the food.
It's real Italian.
I mean, the appetizers alone are so humongous that you really just, you're tempted to overdo
it, because then by the time your omtree comes, forget about it.
566-705-60.
Is that Mundi still proud enough to vote?
What's the result of that just at one shot?
Do you want me to take that off of there?
No, don't do it yet.
Aren't you a little bit suspicious about that?
Very.
What I mean, if that's their choice, I mean.
Boy, you are.
I don't know what happened to you over the weekend.
There is something, something must have happened.
Really bizarre, really traumatic.
Somebody QA must have been the bodywashed.
QAM, hello.
Yeah, Neil, what do you do?
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm not talking about Buffalo restaurants now.
No, no, no, I was just in Vegas a couple months ago.
I ate at the MGM grand.
Yeah.
And there is a restaurant there called Knob Hill.
Really?
Oh, I heard that.
It was, it was, it was one of the best.
I've been at the Brown, Derby and the MGM, and that's a little overrated.
Yeah, I didn't eat it that way.
We stayed at the Luxor.
It was really nice there.
Oh, oh my God.
The casino was great.
Okay.
I won a lot of it, roulette.
You won a lot of money in Vegas, is that what you're telling me?
Well, a bit.
I came out ahead, let's put it that way.
Okay, well that's a miracle.
Yes, totally a miracle.
And as far as your poll today, both were Andozos and Sancies.
I mean, I couldn't choose between the two there to actually.
Randozos is where?
Randozos little Italy in Troll Gables.
Oh, and what's the other one that's done on her poll?
Yeah, it's done with the Sancies, is on your poll.
Sancies?
Sancies.
What is this man's Sancies?
Oh, Fancies, Fancies.
You sound like you got a species back now, Woody.
All of you in the poll?
I don't know.
I'm trying to get in there.
The poll?
Yeah, sort of.
You're fairy.
Have a great day, Woody.
You're doing it.
See him buffalo.
See him buffalo for those three great days of whether they have it in the middle of July.
What a toilet, man.
What a pit.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, a pond 5, 60 in the Verizon Singular Writers' Lines.
Well, Woody's has got 50 and Runway 84 has got.
Bought third, man.
Here's line 9.
QAM, hello.
It's for Raza.
It's Caesar's.
That's the good one.
It is?
In my opinion.
No, that's not the one where they have the big, uh, the big pig, huh?
I think that's the only one that's open now.
The only Italian one.
No, get out of here.
There's got to be two.
There's that bang and something which is like American.
There's 808.
Well, there used to be a place in there where they had, I never ate there, but this big gigantic,
six-course feast, Italian feast, I know what that was called.
Somebody will know.
All right.
Have a good day, sir.
You too.
Yeah, Caesar's is okay.
Just don't gamble there.
They don't have a lot of slot machines in Caesar's.
Which again, of course, Josh don't want any part of that anyway.
He's a real man.
He plays, uh, crafts.
I mean, I'm not a big gambler period.
Now, of course, now, I'm going to kind of money your making out here before the game.
You go out there to soak up the ambience to get on a roller coaster to have some fun to act like a child.
You know, I will say that I, both times that I went though, I, I won.
You know, I did well.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, listen, I'm the only person that goes to Vegas and loses.
I'm just a born loser.
There's no question about it.
Everybody I talk to, today the first time that Hank ever admitted he had a bad weekend.
He lost his ass.
And probably was because he ate those beds.
Five hammeries.
Five hammeries.
I'd hammer in the morning.
Hank Goldberg.
One attack.
Four, three, four, five, six.
Four, three, four.
Seven, two, three.
My enemy, court-lover dance.
To relax by having Mary Magdalen massage my balls while listening to the Neil Rogers 12-A-Hour.
I'm not a baby, I'm a baby
I'm a baby, I'm a baby
I'm a baby, I'm a baby
I'm a baby
I'm a baby
I'm a baby
I'm a baby
I'm a baby
I'm a baby
I'm a baby
I'm a baby
I'm a baby
I'm a baby
Even when those cut dark taxes
Death is as we'll still go down
Dan Rader will not use taxes
Osama will be bound
I know there will be peace
Throughout the Middle East
All this will graduate in queer eyes
Will be
Sounds great, please let it
Be a great year, I cheer
Hated this year, don't need wars
Or elections, and no more flu infections
C.B. will be
Cleaners, and star-junks
Will be linear, let's all look up
The bright tide is
Two-thousand, two-thousand
In 2005
C.B. will be three of five sixty-watt
Q.A.M.A. Thank you Mr. President
For those low gas prices
The average price of a gallon of self-serve
Regular gasoline
Shut up nearly 13 cents over the past two weeks
To a record, an all-time record
Almost as high as Michael Jackson is right now
$2.10
The price exceeds the previous five
207 which was said last May 21
Over the past month, cruel prices rose
20 cents a gallon versus a 19 cent rise
Of the pump
Even if the price of crude doesn't rise further
Prices at the pump may continue to climb
Because of required seasonal reformulations
Meaning as we get closer to
Like the Fourth of July
And Memorial Day all these heavy
Driving holidays, they're going to rape
The American public
Let's see, at $191 a gallon, lowest prices
In Newark, New Jersey, even though the state doesn't allow
Self-service pumps at $2.34 a gallon
Honolulu drivers paid the most, that's for regular
Houston 198, Atlanta 201, Denver 204, Boston 204, Chicago 222
And San Francisco 231, a
For unloading regular, self-serve
Thank you Mr. President
For those low gas prices, and for all this other
Bringing crappy unloading on us, and for all those dead soldiers, and all those dead Iraqis
Fine job
One of these must be a joke, it says, it says, oh, a marking color, Colorado Springs
Colorado Springs, and that what this is?
That's what it says
Well, anyway, he says, the worst food I've ever had in my life
All of a sudden it went from nowhere to 50
I'm not really sure if I'll leave that on there, just what are we going to do about that?
It's got to be a joke, you think?
I think so
We'll wait, maybe some other facts, we'll come in or some calls, if ever, or take any
5670560, pound 5660 on a Verizon Singular Redis line
How many QA and H.
Now what they say?
Nail
A couple things first, I want to let's have a couple weeks ago, outstanding
I'm ready to go around
One of the best, I'm trying to reach you for a couple weeks, when we were on the RV topic
I went into the RV's corporate building over there on Cypress Creek
And as I was thinking the elevator down, we stopped at the RV's for
And some guy in the suit got off
And I said, no, I had lunch at RV's yesterday
And he said really what to have
And I told him I didn't have the head to cake
So there's a move before it here to get rid of the bed to cake
And I told him if I ever go in RV's again, there's no big cake
So it'll be the last time
See, they have this problem, no
I've been saying this for years, they'll have a special sandwich
And they'll say, well for a limited time, when these does the same thing
For a limited time only, and then you know, it'll be the greatest thing they ever had
And then like a month later, you go back to get another one, it's not there
So it would be, that would be typical for them
That would not be a surprise for me
That would go for me, you two, thanks
How do you like that? Just when Josh was going to make them potato cakes
Damn
You didn't have them right? I did
I'm not saying it's the greatest thing in the world, but it's pretty good
It's fair to just get them named fries
No, I personally would take the fries over them, but I liked it to make a shake a lot
Jermokershake is no debate
And I'll say it again, the next thing that Jermokershake at RV's, the best shakes are it's taking the shake
Forget the burgers, they're all falling apart like Mushi now
Yes, very sad
WQAM, hello
Radicator tab
WQAM, hello
Okay, well that's two of the ones in a row
WQAM, hello
Neil, the name of the restaurant is Jesus when you have puke, your foot's a gal with a tuk-tuk-nao
Bok-tuk-nao, that's right, it was like a, that's right, 85 course meal
It was ridiculous
Is it not there anymore?
I don't know, it's been a couple years since I've been out
Okay, thanks a lot, Pat
What's the name?
That was, I never ate there, but I had talked to many friends who ate there and said it was just a nonstop about three-hour feast
Just picking out completely just a, you know, have to make a couple of pit stops in between
567-0560, so if we don't hear any more about Mondis, let me just disappear vanish, often to the, often to the air
I have my doubts
WQAM, hello
Hey Neil, yes sir
We reached 223 of Galen here in Miami-Dade
All right, thank you Mr. President
For those low-gas prices
There you go, you're welcome
Take care Neil, okay, I see you're walking to be good, good exercise, for all of us big fat folks
I do more walking here on one day than I would there in a year, how you like that
Where are you gonna walk there?
Where are you gonna walk here exactly?
From, and when I'm there, I walk from my living room into my garage, into my Corvette
I drive to work, I drive, I walk from the parking lot up into the building, and then I walk down, and I get any elevator
I don't even walk down any stairs, getting the elevator, getting my car and go back home
and the garage, into the house, where are you gonna walk?
Where I live, there are most of the, or are there not even any sidewalks
No sidewalks
No, and the acres, there's no sidewalks out there
Really? No
Shinver Spokesman Randall Terry, the anti-abortion activist, best known for founding operation rescue, headed to Tallahassee with a small convoys last night, to begin ratcheting a pressure on lawmakers in Governor Jeb, fat ass governor Jeb Bush
His first off is the governor's mansion for an 9 p.m. candlelight vigil
Participants wanted the governor to come to Penelope Park and see Terry Shival interact with her mother for himself
What was that thing about she's in a hospital in Miami and I once threw it since when?
She's in Penelope Park
Idiots
Randall Terry, by the way, in case there's anybody now, this story, and there are hundreds of money
On November 24, 2003, this goes to show you how long a year and a half he's been involved in this thing
The Christian right jumps into Terry Shival for a, as Randall Terry resurfaces as the headline
It's said to so-called Terry's Law signed by fat ass governor Jeb Bush October 21
Might better be named Terry's Law, in honor of rabid anti-abortionist Randall Terry, who played a key role in mobilizing Christian fundamentalists to pressure Jeb in the Florentel legislature to intervene in a heart-wrenching case of Terry Shival
The case of a 39-year-old Shival, who's been a persistent and vegetative state for 13 years now 15, raises emotionally difficult issues
But participants in the so-called right-to-life movement have little use for complexity, nuance, and discussion
Flush with victory on various anti-abortion fronts, the movement is seized on the Shival case to rally the troops and push the view
This is just one more example of secular liberals and Democrats promoting a culture of death
As opposed to when you shoot an abortion doctrine, that's a culture of life
Randall Terry, founder of Operation Rescue Pioneer, an aggressive harassment of women seeking abortions
An advocate of a Christian-based nation is in the thick of it
National media generally acknowledge that religious conservatives play the key role in pressuring the Florentel legislature to jump into the Shival case but few have publicized the central role of Terry
No lesson authority to involve Shinler, Shival's father has acknowledged Terry's crucial support
Our family asked Randall Terry to come and we gave him carte blanche to put Terry's fight in front of the American people Shinverse
And he did exactly what we asked and more
Randall organized vigils and protest he coordinated the media, he helped us meet with Governor Faddass, Governor Bush
Terry was a leader in the anti-abortion movements campaign in the 80s and early 90s to put clinics out of business through intimidation, harassment and violence
In a 1995 speech for example, Terry reportedly said of doctors who perform abortions
When I or people like me are running the country, you'd better flee because we'll find you, we will try you and we will execute you
How do you like that? Following an anti-racadtering lawsuit by the National Organization for Women, he agreed in 98 to a permanent injunction against any future actions against abortion clinics
But he's back! He resurfaced last summer in Pate Verde of beach in northern Florida and formed a new organization, the Society for Truth and Justice
His first campaign was against the US Supreme Court's 6-3 decisions striking down anti-sautomy laws and he launched an impeached the Twist and 6 campaign with the rally in Jacksonville, August 9
This is 90 in 2003
Turnout was low but then the Shival case came along and already made platform for Terry's demagoguery
Regardless of how the courts rule in the Shival case Terry is warned that the anti-abortion movement will continue its campaign
Life is life, he said, but an era of increasingly sophisticated medical technology since Logan's do little answer complicated questions
Rangel Terry invited by the shinners to come on down and have fun, what's that tell you?
And they keep putting the brother on there over and over in a Robert Shinner over and over again
And he talks about how vibrant Terry is and she smiles and she laughs and she sings a few songs and she gives up and starts to dance to the show tunes
She's doing it baby, he ain't no vegetable, she's a living vibrant real person with all kinds of feelings and emotions and she's all p-odent pissed off and get that tube back in her house
Mondays is still got 50, what do you think? Do we have any more faxes? Any more anything? I'll wait till 1 o'clock and then we'll have the ruling at 1 o'clock on that, the judges are hearing a 3 o'clock on Terry
Michael Jackson by the way wondered out, he's like they had a dragon out of there, he's stoned, he's puking, he's stoned, he's crying, he's coming unglued
What does that tell you? Is that not the behavior of an innocent man?
For sure. I think so. Maybe you had too much Jesus juice this morning

I'll tell you where I've gone to the buffet many times and as soon as I can think of the start-ost, okay, pretty good. In fact, the start-ost has got a fantastic steakhouse in there which I'd never eaten there so I don't know what the name but is and they got some damn good rest. Start-ost, once upon a time it was pretty damn good and I want some money there too so I guess I liked it. Start-ost and Trappocan are the two places where I used to win pretty regular and NGM as much as I love it there. Now, NGM did have probably in one of the first a lot of wheel of fortunes lost my ass but nevertheless said who doesn't like wheel of fortune?
Trappocan is got wheel of fortune and let me just give you a little key if you go to Vegas, a little clue. There's like a big round circular thing that they have with the wheel of fortunes, dollar ones and if you see there's nobody sitting there, I don't go there because I haven't had the player, I don't know how they could be that smart but the players are on to win. You can sit there for about two hours and feed in there, you're going to get nothing, you're not going to get a spin because they're like in most casinos, they're on timers between the warm cycle, the lukewarm, the
Terry Shibow cycle. Yeah, when I try, when you see her picture come on there, it's not a good sign. That means do not put any more money in here because it's dead as a door nail. Just a little hint when you go to Trappocan. You ever go in the Trappocan? Yes, stay there. Don't you like the the macaws? They still do that when they have the big birds, the parrots? Oh yeah, they have a yeah, well you walk in from across the bridge from the NGM, there's all those big, are they parrots or macaws? I think they're parrots. I don't know. Well you better find out, mister, get with it. It's a little older than the tacky side.
Yeah, you don't have to get in really spend much time in there. No, but it's a neat place. It's a must to check it out kind of place. It's not new and good because there's so many other ones now. Exactly. But you really when you go there and make you should check out purists. Yeah, I will. Next lot restaurants and most importantly when you walk in, it's the like you feel like you're outdoors because it's got the fake sky and then and like grass and like you know, real grass, green grass. It's not the kind you're looking for. Maybe that too. But it's like an outdoor environment. It's really a very bizarre and there's a
section in that area where I was restaurants are that also have slot machines. So it's almost like you feed your playing slots outside. You know, I mean very unusual.
Purruses really beautiful. Anyway, here's Anne who used to send me subs with the hot peppers from Gerber's. Oh yeah, Gerber's going. That's a long time ago. That's 100 years ago. Anne Gerber, how you doing Anne?
Cafe Bella Sada is one of the best entertaining restaurants. The food is unreal. Try to vote online, but was not able to for whatever. She probably got a well. Hope you remember my subs. No longer have the story. Yes, I do. Thank you, Anne.
From Gerber's, Gerber's with us back in my Pember Pines, they come up late.
Let's say Jerry and Vinny this spring says now see that's why I didn't limited to soft food. And Jerry made it the entire state because let's face it.
There are some especially in Tampa. There's some damn good restaurants around the state. Most mean Tampa.
Jerry says I don't normally get to vote on your best restaurants because they're limited to soft food. Since you open this up to the entire state,
like to suggest no one Maria's in North Naples. Napoli. What could be more Italian than Napoli, right?
All of the beesleys are over there. I wonder if Joyce eats it. Non-Amerias.
So find Italian restaurant with an extensive minute attempt to pal it. Also, I'm curious to see how many votes you'll get from the Southwest
Florida area. It'll probably be two, including mine. Can't discuss Terry Shibohyad. I stayed up and watched the arguments on C.
Spanelized. I'm still ill. Oh Jerry, get a life with the please. I have no. I have to watch that crap. Please don't get stuck into that
Kakarai. Please Jerry. You got none Maria? Sure. Oh, you see we got a celebrity death. I'm not really a celebrity so much as a well-known
I was celebrity. You see who died? Who got John Z. Delorean. Who?
Did you make it Delorean?
You know, last Monday before the show for about two or three minutes, I felt like I just wanted to give up and right now I feel the same way.
I mean, I got two two punks there anything that happened before 1990. Neither one of them has got a clue what else all about 1980. Come on.
1990. John Z. You never heard of the Delorean. You never saw what if Nifty doors that opened straight up into the air. Right. Well, that's what I said. That's him. Okay. So we guessed right.
The innovative automaker who left a promising career in Detroit that developed the short live goal wind sports car featured as a souped up time travel machine.
In the back to the future movies is died. He was 80. Oh, he's in Newark, New Jersey. Well, actually in some of New Jersey. He died later Saturday in
the overall hospital complications from recent stroke said Paul canell and owner of AJ Desmond and son's funeral directors and rural
Michigan, which was handling arrangements. Obviously, we're deeply sad by the passing of an incredible talented car person and loving family members said his nephew, Mark Delorean.
He was among a handful of the US entrepreneurs who dared start a car company in the last 75 years. Nearly all of them faded away, but his crashed spectacularly among drug charges.
A Detroit native, Delorean broke them old or stayed Midwestern auto executive by going to Hollywood and post general motor corporation offer smaller models.
While at GM, he created some considered the first muscle car in 64 by cramming a V8 engine into a potty act.
Tempest and calling it the GT. Oh, finally, dubbed the goat file to enthouges a little GTO. Who did that song? Well, GT.
Now come to me. I'll look it up.
Richard Book of Ryan knows somebody and the somethings the Lorraine was rising if I'm conventional executive a GM who many believe was this and for his presidency before
Quentin 73 to largely the Lorraine motor car company in Northern Ireland eight years later, the Lorraine DMC 12 hit the streets.
It's hallmark such as an unpainted stainless steel skin and gold wing doors have been ignored by mainstream automakers.
The angular design, however, earned a cult following and the car was time traveling vehicle for Michael J. Foxon, the popular back to the future films in the late 80s.
John DeLorean, that is a door nail.
Don't get sucked into that. I don't believe it. I didn't play that. Okay. Okay. I didn't do the spot.
Well, I was so excited about Terry Shabo still being alive and vibrant dancing gazes on the hallway and panelists part.
Aren't you excited about it? Yeah, I can see how you got care to it. Yeah.
Hey, even after all this time, some people still are a little bit afraid of either bending over the phone because I don't know.

Ronnie in the day,
thank you.
For most of his life, Michael Jackson has been sexually molesting a 13 year old boy.
Tonight, Michael Jackson speaks out for the first time about his arrest, his accuser, and the charges that have for the moment made his life a shim.
You molested this boy.
Absolutely. Absolutely.
How would you characterize your relationship with this boy?
He's totally for sex.
And Jackson says there was more.
This is one of many developing the children, but that power over children.
In a moment, Michael Jackson tells us why he still believes it's appropriate to have children sleep in his bed.
Do you still think that it's acceptable to share your bed with children?
If you're going to be a pedophile, sure. Of course, why not?
More of Michael Jackson's story.
I have a sick mind yet when we return.
Call 332701.
Have at least a day to Michael Jackson, the proceedings are underway again.
The trial is back.
He just had a little, you know, a little off his feet.
Maybe had some bad scene over the weekend.
He was a little behind.
A little in the one.
A little behind.
This fact that you just sent me me,
we go, don't read what it says on there.
No pizza joints, okay?
And the fact that the fact that they mentioned this,
I mean, this has got to be somebody with the most boy you should taste.
Oh, I'm not.
Oh, you know what I did?
You're not paying much attention at logmasters.
You know, Josh is also a little off his feet today because he's using too much body wash.
I can't say where he's putting it, but I didn't do the Palpatot Park spot.
What time was that logged?
I'll park.
Do you want to do that?
That would be at 1142.
Oh, is that tonight?
Well, it's not going to be 1142 this morning again anytime soon.
What did I do in there?
Did I do a spot in there?
Did I do anything?
I don't remember.
I don't know.
That's why I'm going to do it right now.
Okay.
Or the night.
I don't know.
Look, I got to it.
Can I tell you why I'm off my feet today?
And I'll be honest about it.
I know I am.
That's why my memory is so bad.
I ate ice cream yesterday.
Oh, do you want me to tell you how much I ate?
I don't know.
After the spot, I'll let you.
I'll let you.
I'll let you brace yourself for the shock.
And I have no idea why because it wasn't even good.
It was crap.
What kind of dream?
Cadbury, crispy crunch.
You know, they have these candy ice cream.
What do I tell you about candy ice cream?
They're all bad, or at least except for score.
Well, what the hell was that?
Well, crispy crunch is a Canadian candy.
Brother, one thing about the candy here, man,
which is unfortunate.
Candy here is heads and shoulders over in the US.
I don't know why.
It's better?
No, much better.
You never heard of crispy crunch?
And crunchy?
Oh, crunchy.
Crunchy's got like that honeycomb inside the chocolate.
Oh, brother.
In fact, when you take the first bite,
Jimmy Rogers starts singing.
Honeycomb, I remember Jimmy Rogers.
He's also like Terry Shriver almost.
I'll tell you after the spot, OK?
Something for you to get excited with up
in the front of the register.
Oh, you pig.
Yeah.

1236, okay, I guess I have another
as an expression take me to your leader.
That, yeah.
That's when I ate.
Oh, I don't know how much a leader is.
Now like did you throw it in for like 67 seconds
in the mic and you just know 80, 89
because it's a bigger quantity.
89 seconds.
Right.
A leader is like a.
That seems like such a long time to me.
A leader is more than a cord.
Right, right?
A little bit more than a cord.
In fact, they show you answer your odd, huh?
Which is a lot.
No kidding.
I told you.
Some of them off my feet today.
My blood sugar is a little bit high.
Not really disaster high, but it's high.
That's how it goes.
And I mean, go ahead.
Look, it's just one of those things.
I'm a pig.
I'm an ice cream addict.
I'm no crispy alley.
Cucumber go.
I didn't, huh?
Close.
No, I'm L.G.A. Right.
That's what you think.
I guarantee you, she could either tub.
You know, one of those family sized tub,
one of those tub of ice cream.
You know, when you go to bastard robins
or one of those places, and they have the big tubs
that they scoop the ice cream out of.
Like a cake of cookie dough.
Right, exactly.
Just like that.
Angelina's in Brandon, Florida.
Somebody says Rob says a great private
and own small Italian restaurant in Highway 60.
Brandon.
So not true on the stereo family owned.
The staff speaks only required English.
Not quick, but worth the wait.
Homemade desserts.
Awesome.
And Yokey.
I hate Yokey.
But anyway, if you like it, they got awesome.
Yokey.
Yokey.
Ever have Yokey?
I think so.
So it's like potato pasta.
It's cramp.
But anyway, Angelina's in Brandon.
So put that on there.
I'm sure we have a lot of people over there.
But third man.
What do you think?
It's why they're.
You lived in Brandon.
I did.
Oh, no wonder.
That explains a lot.
That explains me why you think New York, New York
is the best hotel in the best casino in Vegas.
I'm just saying if you like it, enjoy it.
Are you staying there again this time?
I've never stayed there.
I just think that it's everything.
Where did you stay?
I've stayed at the MGM, the Trappacana, and Monty Carla.
And what was your complaint with the MGM?
What's not to like here?
I love the MGM.
I think it's a great hotel in Casino.
Right.
I just think the activities, everything
to do in the New York, New York is great.
It's a tacky.
Tacky, does you know where I can think of?
I don't know if to tell you.
OK.
But you like tacky.
You like your roller coaster ride.
You like, yeah, I'll take you.
Stop into circus, circus.
You're like, you're loving it.
It's for little kids.
I'm good.
People who think like little kids.
People who are very close to their childhood.
Dominic Q. I.M. Hello.
Hi.
I have something for your poll.
OK.
I think the best Italian restaurant is Cafe Mother Anusa.
But I like the Italian food at lasty's Tavern and Grill,
even though it's not in the Tavern restaurant.
OK.
I love it.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye.
What's you saying?
5.6705.
I got it.
5.6705.60.
But if you enjoy this late, we're doing food this week.
We don't want to get out into the Terry Shival polls.
And we don't want to.
And we're going to have that steroid crap.
OK.
Let's get off the roids.
What do you say?
Rest, go, huh?
I'm off of the roids already.
I'm off of this grandstanding for the public.
I'm off of these congressional hearings.
Let me say it again to public.
If there's anything else in you ought to feel
it's absolute anger, outrage, and psychosis
that your Congress and your president
are wasting their time on this crap.
But all the other things that are going on, $2 plus for a gallon
of gas, you've got murderous bloodshed and bagged
that every day.
You have all kinds of crap going on,
all kinds of corruption.
We've got people without health care who are dying every day.
Living and breathing people who can't afford
their prescription medication because they're getting
raped at it and ripped off by the companies
that the FDA is allowing to poison the public, all of these
things, and they're worried about this vegetable.
Somebody who's living in a vegetative state.
I'll be honest with you, I think they're
17 million people living in that vegetative state.
Isn't that the population of Florida not 17 million?
Something like that.
Staggering, scary.
And when I come back to town, a lot of you
were getting weeded out.
For us, things have been real Rogers.
It's, musically, on 5.60 AM.
Throws ass in jails while I suck.
Spread them and say cheese.
That's it.
And now with the League of Recurrents,
Citizens who promote their rendition of greenery.
Don't make fun of them.
They wrote every hard for this.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't, don't move.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't'
Don't move.
Don't move.
Don't move.
Don't move.
Where?
Where?
Where.
No one will want to report on this.
Where?
Where?
Where?
Where?
Where?
ppe?
Where?
I'm going to have to go to the bathroom.
Come on along it to two.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Yoli, if they're having a dog track, what about a Hollywood gay track?
A Roger's Kidden had rights on a website called Workbench.
Free Terry Shival.
I'm sorry I shouldn't read because McGill get really bent out of shape.
He's thinking about me eating that leader of Cadbury, crispy crunch rice.
It was crap.
And because of the fact that it was so tasteless, I had like a...
...shmere little Hershey syrup in there too.
That's why you needed the whole leader.
Yeah, exactly.
I was trying to get a little satisfaction out of it.
I was trying to get that serotonin going, man.
I'd have been better off to go out and buy one crispy crunch candy bar.
It would have been a hell of a lot better.
That's why I'm off my feet.
I'll be very honest with you.
So what was the name of that?
What are we talking about?
That's what I was talking about.
Oh, anyway, he says,
Free Terry Shival.
Terry Shival's brain no longer has a cerebral cortex.
She will never again talk, experience a thought or feel an emotion.
The best appearance can all force that she'll occasionally mimic life-like responses
because of involuntary brain stem activity.
Well, is he picking on Coach Hula again?
No act of Congress will change this.
All Republicans in the religious writer are accomplishing with this barbaric grandstanding
is to prolong her family's suffering.
Michael Shival fought for years to find a cure for his wife.
He even went back to college to become a nurse so we could better care for her.
He wrote in 2003,
I never wanted Terry to die.
I still don't.
After more than seven years of desperately searching for a cure for Terry,
the death of my own mother helped me realize I was fooling myself.
More important, I was hiding behind my hope and selfishly ignoring Terry's wishes.
I wanted my wife to be with me so much that I denied her true condition.
Terry told me on several occasions before this happened that she wouldn't want to live in her current condition.
If we had been older, I'm sure she would have signed a living will,
making it clear she did not want to be kept alive on tubes and machines she never had the chance.
That left me to carry out her wishes.
It's been hard.
In fact, it's the hardest thing I've ever done.
In the end, I did what I believe Terry would have wanted me to.
Is there a single person among the parade of ghouls exploiting this tragedy
who would wish to be kept alive in Terry's condition?
Someone should ask Tom to lay in other politicians if they have living wills.
Medical science gets better every day of keeping people alive
in conditions no one would ever choose to experience.
The right to opt out of life for long increments is exercised every day in this country.
For example, my grandfather died at home at the age of 90 after a slow decline from Alzheimer's disease.
He died in his own familiar beds surrounded by people who loved him.
He was not in pain, his breathing slowed and slowed and finally stopped.
If it is killing to refuse life-reserving medical treatment, then my grandmother murdered my grandfather
when she failed to call the paramedics.
The other's president is dead for accessories to murder.
But who would have benefited had my grandfather been forced to squeeze out a few extra days
in an intensive care unit on a respirator, confused and disoriented.
In what way would that afford the culture of life?
We should all be as lucky as Terry Shival has been to have a spouse who would fight so hard for our right to die in such circumstances.
The easiest thing in the world would be for Michael Shival to give up, raise the young chubbling heads with another woman,
and let Terry continue to linger hopelessly between life and death.
The only good thing to come from this sickening spectacle is that thousands of people myself included
will be rushing to drive living wills.
It comes at a pretty well-aid.
And the good part of it is, at least Cornwall's ABC polls, is the overwhelming majority of people, regardless of their politics,
they're seeing through all of this crap.
Nobody's getting fooled.
The only people who are buying into it are the ones who believe the same crap anyway.
The Randall Terries of the world.
People who are at best.
And by the way, your son Terry, you're fair.
Randall, whatever your name is.
560-560.
We're looking for the best and tell you where I'm running the state of Florida.
No pizza parlors will do that on some other day.
Mundi's 53.
It's kind of like slow down though.
You know what I said?
It had like a big flurry there for a while.
For the room of 10?
They went to go eat now.
Oh, they're eating lunch.
456 votes total.
Mundi's has 53, which I don't know.
Book of the Beppo 42.
What tell us Book of the Beppo?
I've heard that many, many times.
Do you know where there's a Book of the Beppo?
I think it's a shame.
They've been on our station before.
Well, that's good.
Then we'd like them a lot.
All right.
We have some people been on it.
Well, Cafe Belacere of 41.
Runway 84-38.
Carabas 31.
Sashain.
El Milino 31.
The roasted pepper 29.
Macaroni Grill 29 is a shame.
It's good.
It's okay.
I just don't like that guy to get stuff.
It does that little black sample routine.
Matarano is 26.
Mamma mia is in Hollywood 23.
God, Nutella's in Tampa's got 19.
Aren't you impressed by that?
Oh, sure.
Now, you think that some of those are coming from people over there who listen online.
Or you think that's people like yours truly who've been over there a few times
and eaten and enjoyed their great food.
Or both.
Probably online.
Lot's happened at a 17.
Cafe da Angelo, Acacid Angelo 13.
Capriccio's 12.
That's where Diffo eats.
It's a great restaurant.
Randazzo's little Italy 9.
Fancy 7.
Cafe prima pasta 7.
Flavors of Italy 7.
Vignetto's 6.
Lavoranda 4.
Oh, I thought that was a...
Lavignetta.
Nonononist kitchen 4.
Rosanella's 3.
No, Fulvio's not Fulvio's.
You fool.
Look what he put for Fulvio's F-O-L as in pasta, Fajullio.
Hey, that's Italian.
Oh, my God.
You don't know your Italian, mister.
You're Italian, Cullio.
Holy cow.
Fulvio F-U-L-V-I-O.
You see, I stopped struggling a lot of these because you give me a bitch me out for like giving me a spelling lessons.
And then you put Fulio's.
Maybe this looks like some kind of a Fulio.
Anyway, Fulvio too, which I'm sure that'll be corrected any moment.
F-U-L-V-I-O, Fulvio got it.
Not Fulio.
Oh, I do like the sound of it.
Van Bino 2, Angelina's 1, 9-O-Mario 1, Cafe Arragazzi's got 1.
Oh, what else?
And the spec-o's got 1, out of 4.65-0.
Well, at least everybody's got 1, unlike Jean Vincent.
The Monday thing, I'm a little bit- I don't know.
I'm not- I'm not sure I'm buying it.
I never heard of it, did you?
No.
I mean, there's a lot of different places we never heard of.
But here's a fact from Debbie who says-
He says, D.D. for those in the-
Okay, Debbie.
Uh, let's see.
Mondis is the best attorney restaurant in Florida.
See that?
20 years later, my husband, a loyal listener and loyal objector,
have- and I have died of Mondis on several occasions.
What does that mean?
Her- I don't get that.
The food is delicious.
Try to feel parm.
Oh, see, there we go with Vio Parm again.
I love Vio Parm, but to me, that's not- I don't know.
That's not really Italian.
Like, maybe Vio- um, a macfretiana.
Vio- Oscar.
Vio- I don't know.
The portions oversized, the bread is scrumptious in the atmosphere,
relaxed in the family oriented.
If you want to look if you ask for a vet as your server,
you won't be disappointed.
Well, more to any decision is Debbie D.D.
Okay, Debbie D.D.
Mondis is Italian restaurant.
I told you it's the best and I tell you that?
Oh, sure.
It is. It's fantastic.
I love it.
Never heard of it.
Il piato rastodante, candle driving 137th Avenue in Miami.
That's in candle to you, Bill.
Thought Miami is technically in Miami.
It's in candle.
Candle driving 137th Ave.
No speaking in English, Aki.
P.S. is it possible to squeeze green onions into a feeding tube?
Oh, that's bad.
That is so sick, Bill, but I enjoy it.
Il piato italiano.
I.L.
The Italian floor.
Is that what the piato means in the Italian floor?
Sure.
What are you would know Italian if it fit you under the lift?
No, I wouldn't.
No.
So there we go.
We got a couple more.
5607.0560, pound 560 in the Verizon and Singular wireless lines.
Thank God we're not doing a poll on Terry Shivell.
I would be so embarrassed to be doing that like everybody else.
What do you think?
We already saw the national polls not even a contest.
Anybody with a brain, a brain with cerebral cortex that's actually functioning.
No, it's not the real answer.
Get the government out of these people's lives already.
We're just like alien all over again.
Just the same crap.
And they wanted to kill him too with a damn happy meals.
Oh, poor alien idea.
No matter what he would say, they would turn it around.
Remember the plane that he said is coming to take me back to Cuba?
Even the government members there.
That's right.
I forgot you run the other side of that.
I wasn't going to say that.
Yeah, you were.
Did you finally come to your senses?
Well, it's over.
Did you finally come to your senses?
I have no idea.
Or you're still hockin' away this business.
You should have stayed with Maris Grisi as that family had drunks.
Miami Drunks.
Yes.
No.
And the fisherman.
Yes, thank you.
WQA Am Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I just wanted to put a vote upon your poll there.
Go ahead.
Cafe Abrachi in Coral Gables.
Cafe Abrachi?
Yes, sir.
How do you be scrolling that?
I believe it's A, B, R, A, C, R, A.
That would be a-a-b-r-a-c-a-abrachi.
Good stuff, huh?
He's gone.
How was it?
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
I guess it was good stuff he went to vote for.
Cafe Abrachi in the gave a never-heard.
Did you hear that?
No.
What is, you know, restaurants take coming to go there, huh?
There's so many.
It's actually two Bs and two Cs, but you know, same thing.
Is that what he said?
Yeah.
Did you look it up to the Google?
I googled it.
Yeah, you googled it in my ass.
1256 and 560 QIM.
You failed.
It's exclusive.
1256 and 560 and 560.
It's the one to do it!
Hi, Berry.
I need another abortion, and I need it.
Oh!
Oh!
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
1256 and 560.
WDQM.
Well, Randall Terry is coming to town.
So that's all we need to know.
It's good news.
We can rest the sleep well tonight.
Here's a fact that says it's frightening to realize
that corporate chain of tag restaurants have got most
of the votes in your pool.
Yeah, well, you don't have any for the olivigarden, thank God.
Anybody who would call in and say the olivigarden for this pool
would be shot on site and sound, right?
Yeah, it gives you the runs.
It says, well, generally that, but the food is cock-a-man.
You talk about industrial strength.
Bugit-de-Beppo, Carabas, Macaroni Grill, all corporate chain
restaurants.
Oh, and it says here, how long I'd put olivigarden on a list
of that's the appeal of this audience.
Pass the Chef Boyard, Ian Frankl American.
Well, I'll guarantee you one thing.
If they had restaurants, a Chef Boyard, Ian Frankl American,
they'd have a lot of votes too.
And it's not just this audience.
That's the taste of the American public.
But I will say this, you got a couple of gourmet tag,
evidently, although I have Mondis and Cafe Bellicetta,
that are one and two, right?
You do?
Runway 84, which is not a chain at number four.
Roasted peppers, not a chain at number five.
OK?
Il Molino, which only has one now, used to have two,
but certainly not a chain at number six or seven.
Huh?
So we get off our case already.
Will you please, product and plan.
We don't give a crap.
If they like it, they like it.
We're not asking what they auto like,
or what will be politically correct, or pseudo intellectually correct
for them to like.
That's what they like.
If they got a quay, it should taste.
That's the way it goes.
They probably like McDonald's too.
Just like Jocester, he likes to fries at Arby's.
And George, who I don't want to pick on,
he's not there this week, but anyway,
who's big on McDonald's fries.
Well, you don't like fries, period.
I don't like french fries.
They're poison, man.
They will kill you.
Those french fries will do more.
But a leader of ice cream world.
I was just going to say, I'm just going to say now,
that that ice cream I had yesterday was more helpful
than those french fries you're eating.
Deep fronto.
Trans fats, baby.
Now that's not to say they aren't trans fats and ice cream.
In fact, I better go look at the label.
Oy!
But you say, I don't know if we get to sing out of the tub,
out of the dumpster, out of the garbage bag.
Thank you.
Do it.
All right.
Whistle to him.
Get in the new bag.
There's no way to fly.
Get back in the new bag.
I'm going to have to play right now.
All right.
Kill it.
And the other one is the, um, score.
And the other one is crispy crunch.
I'm telling him, man.
He's ice cream.
The only one that's good is the other two of them.
Nestle's turtle and the other one is the, um, score.
Brier score.
Is it brier?
I don't know.
Ingredients.
Oh, that's in French on that side.
I don't want to read that.
Dumb frogs.
Millic ingredients.
Candy bars.
Sugar glue.
Well, there's like two crispy crunch candy bars in each, uh, leader.
You know, like crunched up and saying.
Uh-huh.
But the base of it is like almost vanilla.
You know what?
Oh.
Sugar glucose peanuts.
Cocoa butter.
Milk ingredients.
Chocolate.
Malaces.
Mono and a Douglas Rides.
Soyolescent.
And flour.
Vegetable oil.
BHA.
That's a preservative.
It'll kill you.
National artificial flavor.
Sugar, peanut butter, ribbon, uh, containing, uh, let's see, vegetable oil.
Shortening.
See that?
Transpads.
Bad.
Glucose solids.
Vanilla, mono and Douglas Rides.
Gluard gum.
Oh, bad.
Locust bean gum.
Caraguinin.
Real bad.
And, uh, artificial color.
Allergy alert.
Peanut's other, uh, nut meats and gluten.
If you're a gluten for punishment, don't eat this crab.
It's bad.
This is true.
It on the floor.
Tom Fax isn't says, including me and my family on that list of murderers.
My grandfather was ninety four or five years old and cancer would take an
over his body.
We knew five years ago about it, but he and the family didn't want any sort of chemo
or radiation.
He was ninety.
He lasted five years, made the best of time he had left.
He also died in his own place in his own room surrounded by all his closest family.
Thanks to the hospice care he got from Veritas and that being poor he got worse, he had
signed a living will, uh, with a do not resuscitate closinant.
He died September old, forward and no pain at all, with dignity.
He was ninety five.
What would a respirator do for him or suffering through chemo and all the pain and
discomfort it brings?
Or rest me too.
Let her die with that little big news she's got left.
Nice going Tom.
Amen.
This is this government and then we already have it again.
This is the Republican Party that doesn't believe in big brother government.
They're always ripping the Democrats too much big government.
When the government, you know, when it has to do with interfering in your own personal choices,
that's what a Republican expertise comes in.
That's what they want larger than life government.
What you can do in your bedroom, you know, what you're going to do about deciding whether
to deliver or die, what a woman does with her own body, reproductive rights, all of these
things.
All of these things.
Exactly.
We don't have a Democrat, we have a weak need, limp Democratic Party that those people
should hang their heads in shame except for Bobby Weston and a handful of others.
And on the other hand, you've got the American Nazi Party.
The Democrats and Republicans are gone.
They vanished.
They've disappeared.
And the public's respect, well, let's see what should we watch now.
She will watch the hearings on the steroids or should we watch more about Terry Shavel?
Or maybe we can go to court TV and see more about the Robert Blakeburg, or maybe we can get a little on Michael on E.
They're like duplicating the trial on E.
Oh, horrible.
And they can't understand whether they're not getting any ratings.
They showed that queen that's doing a Michael Jackson thing, putting on the makeup the other day.
Well, I have to be really believable as Michael.
And I thought to myself, you're fair.
Yeah.
Fine, I don't want to get whipped up about this religion stuff.
I do have two more stories, but I'll give to them.
Because there might be some more great Italian restaurants out there, and God forbid if we don't get them on there.
You know, it would be bad.
Not so much from the pool stand, boy, but the idea that, you know, people out there might say, hey, that sounds pretty good.
Maybe I'll try that.
Or maybe that's like right down the street.
I've never heard of it before.
See what I'm saying?
I've said that a couple of times already.
Like Mondes.
W2AM, hello.
I talked about myself.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
And the past couple weeks shows exactly what's wrong with this country.
Yeah.
They have been racial hearings, or shares against baseball.
But yeah, we're racial hearings against these pedophiles that have let us, you know, they killed this little girl.
You know, why don't they do something about that?
Why don't they let those people back out?
Is if there's some kind of a cure for that, there's no cure.
They put them in an alken phrase or an island away from civilized people.
Exactly.
But they're worried that they're right now.
They've got that slime ball on there right now and they're going to jump soon.
Yeah, they're so worried about why they're sterile and baseball, but they're not worried about why they let these pedophiles lose, man.
That's what's wrong with this country.
Hey, man, you got a man.
To try to find some comfort after such a successful crime.
We're all thankful that you feel happy now.
Oh, that's it.
I give up.
We're all thankful that she's in heaven now.
Now, you're all littered, girl.
It's family.
It gets murdered by this slime ball.
It's unshaven, unclean, nasty, sick, twisted slime ball, who obviously is just walking waste is all he is.
To put it mildly.
He's excrement on two legs.
That's all he is.
And the meantime, they let him out.
Just like Bundy, it was the same thing.
When a doubt let's let him out.
Of course, he could run it out.
567.0560, pound 562, and leave a rise in singular wireless lines.
WQA and hello.
Yeah, I'm telling about Bundy's restaurant.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I've eaten there a couple times.
Yeah.
No matter how fat the light is so much, they're going to cater my 90th, my grandmother's 90th.
I thought you were going to say your 90th birthday yet.
So, gee, you sound pretty good for 90.
No, it's my grandmother's 90th.
They're going to cater for us.
Excellent.
We're really going to go back to the motherland there.
Okay, thanks a lot, Palli.
All right.
See, it is for real, man.
You were so skeptical.
I think it rubbed off from George on to you, Josh.
So skeptical.
I never heard of that.
I think that's how we're getting freaked.
Now, would you come up with such crap?
Okay.
Jeepers creepers.
What, worried about the creepers?
Okay.
Just like coffee, billet, a set of things.
Whatever it is, billet, a set of things.
See, some of these people are waiting for them to go on there.
And that happens to be their favorite.
And all those people go, oh, I'm going to vote now, see.
I mean, like if this, if you're voting on this kind of a pool,
you're obviously going to wait until your favorite goes on there.
Because the question is, what's the best?
And if you've got one that's your favorite that you think is the best,
you're not going to vote for like some, you know,
I'll be garden, right?
Right.
Or the one we got on that's tax before me,
I'll let me repeat the name, but I'm still just, oh.
Hey, listen, the guy that was bitching about Franco-American and Chef Boyardy,
what was suggested on that one sheet of paper, man.
It makes Franco-American seem like gourmet cuisine, man.
God, you talk about bad, bad taste.
WQAM, hello.
Yeah, and the other one, you will run on.
You will run on.
You'll run on them.
Yeah.
70 QAM, hello.
Good afternoon, sir.
Yes, sir, Buenos dias.
Buenos dias.
Carabas, just so, you know, you said you don't, you've never eaten there.
No.
It is jang, but it is pretty, pretty good.
I mean, it's all by the same people at all in Alpacs.
I certainly would not put it anywhere in the same league with the olive pit.
I mean, no, that's, come on, man.
Yeah.
But it's not bad.
You know, again, it's not like, run away 84 or anything like that.
But it's pretty good.
It's not bad.
One of these things is, if it's in the plantation, there were almolemius to be,
and it's not far from our lives, I'll try it.
There's also one in Carl Springs in that whole restaurant, Roe, over there,
a university.
There's one in there too.
So, anyways, good to talk to you.
Okay, have a great day.
Take care of it.
Thanks.
So, Carabas, you said it's pretty good, didn't you say that?
Because I guess you eat there a lot.
You get pre-bees there or something?
Well, I'm a body of mind's a chef there.
Uh-huh.
So, you get pre-bees there.
A little bit, but I mean, I've been there a while.
Well, hold it.
Hold it.
Yeah.
That's not an appropriate response.
It's like, if I asked you what day it is, and you said, three o'clock, it's not, it's
a non-sequitor.
What do you mean?
Well, when I said you get pre-bees there, and you said a little bit.
I mean, like every once in a while, like what, you pay like 10% of the time.
No, not at all.
Like, sometimes you'll, when he's leaving, maybe like, I'll come to his house and he made me something
from coming home.
But I don't, like, when I go there, I don't get anything free.
Like, why not?
That's just not the way.
Kind of a friend is that.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
Exactly.
Look, if you're going to be in this business as a peripheral, as you are right now to it,
and be counting your blessings that it is, then you've got to start learning to get free
food, with which you're learning inside there in the building.
Right.
Now, I would probably weigh 600 pounds if I was, first of all, if I was in town all the
time in number two, if I was a free loader, like some people I know in a business.
I don't know how much of Mr. Ego.
But if I was demanding free, oh, look at this.
Pay me for the BS.
Oh!
Sheridan and Flamingo, and it points out that BSO also stands for SOB.
Good point.
Sheridan and Flamingo, look out for the pigs, man.
They're in a feeding prins.
You must be that he has been turning into a month.
They've got to make their quota.
Even though, of course, we know that there are no quotas.
Here's one from Cliff, Bukitive Depot.
No, seriously, you've got to start getting your friend to give you some pre meals.
I'll give it a shot.
I'm telling you, if I want to be a free loader, I could eat free all the time.
I feel queasy about that.
It's not going to went into Ruth Chris.
Now, they've picked up the tab a few times over the years.
They were a sponsor once upon a time.
And I appreciate that, but I'm not going there looking for it.
And usually, I hope they don't do it, because I don't know.
I feel unclean, you know?
Well, I'll go there and use your name.
Cliff says, Bukitive Depot is my vote.
I don't care for Italian food, and I love the food atmosphere.
I feel it felt so real.
I thought I would see a hit go down in there.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, really.
It's on 57th Avenue.
I'm going to mind me.
Lakes next pool, Barbecue Ribs.
Anyone who asked to ask for a, what does that say?
Something server is a snobby.
I don't know against any of that.
A vet server?
A vet server.
Oh, a veteran server?
In other words, for somebody to wait on.
Oh, Cliff, just relax.
Okay.
You live a lot longer, just relax.
Hey, these.

I'm a ham cheerier from media by now with our friend Anthony Kelliando, the main man at acceptance capital mortgage.
So before you call any other mortgage company, let the main man tell you what you don't know.

And if your credit is less than absolutely perfect, you're ready to hear the most famous two letter word in the English language.
No.
That is correct.
If you're not working with the right lender, chances of getting approved are only 50-50.
So do yourself a big favor, call the right guy, call right now Anthony Kelliando,
triplet 4-8-3-Lone.
That's 1-888-4-8-3-Lone.

Our old man needed bread.
Our life wasn't free.
We'll not kill him your hand.
We'll let our eyes man see fire.
Let me be the enjoyer of the music.
If the league of treasured according to you, let the little guy you'll see.
The day the sea, the area that's free.
Oh, can it be that this is that's the tune to me?
Oh, can it be that this is that's the tune to me?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What's all this happened there?
What got cut off?
The end of that.
Why is that?
I didn't do anything here.
How did that get chopped off like that?
Maybe that's the way it is.
Josh, I don't know, one of those phenomena.
I see, it made me the Lord intervened.
Maybe God has given up and off and in and out with all this stuff he's hearing about.
The parents of Terry Shivoy have to judge to reinsert the brain damage women's feeding tube.
Today following an extraordinary day long political fight, they consume both chambers of Congress
and prompted the president to rush back to the White House.
And attorney for Shivoy's parents, Bob and Marishin, they arrived at a federal district court and tapped
a filed a request for an emergency injunction to keep their daughter fed.
Oh, I got like a leader of vice-created that you could add yesterday.
When the attorney, David Gibbs the two was asked if he had any indication when the judge would rule on the request.
He said, I have no way to know just that it's in the hands of the court.
Well, they're having to hear me a three o'clock this afternoon.
And the one would assume that he'd give a year, a thumbs up or thumbs down or say who the hell cares about this crap.
Let's go to lunch.
Which may be a much more appropriate response.
Oh, Jesus, they're just 80 million pages of this crap.
Are you a centimus sucker too?
Oh, it's half.
Best Italian restaurant says Adam and D'Areal is Renzo's in East Vocca.
They're about 10 to 12 years run by an authentic Italian family.
The best cheesecake around too.
Oh, the Italians love cheesecake. Trust me when I tell you.
In fact, generally speaking in Italy when you go to a restaurant, the desserts are like, yeah, they have like spamoni and they have gelato miso and they have cheesecake.
Did I mean so?
The caramel stew, that's great. Only about like five or six different things, you know.
All of these things.
Because to be very honest with you, they have to eat an Italian restaurant.
Eating desserts a little on the tacky side.
Kind of like eating dessert at Ruth Chris.
Unless somebody else is buying for the rimers or something like that.
There is one time I ever took them to Ruth Chris that he had an ordered dessert.
What a freeloading pig, you know.
God, how's that hockey season coming?
Oh, sorry.
For the re-backed daughter, the big attraction was the famous Ten Commandments monument
brought to Florida on tour after being removed from the Alabama Judicial Building is unconstitutional.
It was unconstitutional.
The youngster is dressed in red, white and blue, clustered proudly round the display.
For more than 900 other Christians from across the U.S.
to draw at Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church last month was a national conference aimed at reclaiming America for Christ.
The monuments that is a potent symbol of their hopes for changing the course of this nation.
We have God-sized problems in our country and only God can solve them, Richard Land,
a prominent leader of the Southern Baptist Convention to all the group.
The remission is not simply to save souls, their goal is to mobilize evangelical Christians
for political action to return society to what they call the biblical worldview of the founding fathers.
Some speak every stirring a Christian nation.
Others shy away from that phrase, but agree that the Bible calls them not only to evangelize but also transform the culture.
In material given to conference attendees, the anxious anti-Semites Reverend D. James Kennedy,
Coral Ridge pastor wrote,
as the vice-regions of God, we ought to bring His truth and His will to bear on every sphere of our world and our society.
We are exercised godly, dominion, influence over our neighbors, our neighborhoods, our schools, our government, our entertainment media, our news media, our scientific endeavors,
and short every aspect and institution of human society says the umptuous obnoxious anti-Semite homophobrata Reverend D. James Kennedy.
This is the 10th conference to spread this cultural mandate among Christians,
and although the churches pastor couldn't speak due to illness, others presented the message intended to rouse the conservative faithful,
even to capitalize on James' wonderingly November election.
This melting of religion and politics, Christianity and patriots makes many uneasy, especially those on the other side of the so-called culture war,
who see a threat to the healthy discourse of a pluralistic society.
This is an effort to impose a particular far-right religious view and political and social policies that result from that on others,
as Elliot Minkberg of People for the American Way, and Rupert Advocates for a diverse society.
There is nothing wrong with trying to convince others to adopt their views, but Kennedy's effort is also to use the levers of government to force changes.
An energetic pastor who built Carl Ridge into a 10,000-member megachurch with far-reaching radio and TV audiences,
the anxious doctor Kennedy regularly calls the United States a Christian nation that should be governed by Christians.
He has created a center for Christian statesmanship in Washington that seeks to evangelize members of Congress and their staff and to counsel conservative Christian officeholders.
Some critics suggest that these views reflect far-right presbyterian thinking, some of which extends to the realm of theocracy,
to believe that God or his representatives should govern the state.
Fred Rick Carlson, author of Eternal Hostility, the struggle between theocracy and democracy says that if Kennedy is not a theocrat,
then he certainly dominionists, one who supports taking over and dominating the political process.
A real mum's or bastard if you pardon my French.
And one last one, can you handle it?
I can handle it.
San Diego is speaking of good religion.
The San Diego's Roman Catholic bishop has denied funeral rights to a man who owned a bar and dance club popular with gays,
setting a class with a church's moral teachings.
You're fairy!
John McCusker, who was gay by a Sunday of congestive heart failure at a ski resort, his family said.
Arrangements have been made to hold funeral services at the immaculate of Catholic Church on the University of San Diego campus,
McCusker's alma mater that's affiliated with the church.
But San Diego Bishop Robert Brahm decided that none of the 98 Catholic churches in San Diego or Imperial counties could provide funeral rights for McCusker, who was 31.
The facts regarding the business activities of John McCusker were not known by church officials when arrangements were requested for a funeral that I see said Thursday in a statement.
However, when these facts became known, the bishop concluded that to avoid public scandal, Mr. McCusker cannot be granted a funeral of the Catholic Church or chapel of the diocese of San Diego.
By the way, this is the same church that regularly held funeral services and baptisms and all the other services for members of the mafia.
That was okay.
That was great because they used to donate a lot of money.
Chancellor Rodrigo Valdivia said the church's decision would not relate to McCusker's sexual orientation.
His business is adult entertainment, which is inconsistent with Catholic teaching, Valdivia said people would be scandalized that the church granted a funeral to a person who had this type of business activity.
And we certainly know that the mob was never involved in prostitution or drugs or gambling.
Valdivia said that a church can in that state's manifestiners are among those who cannot be granted funeral rights without public scandal to the faithful.
Valdivia could not recall any examples of other cases in which the diocese has invoked a canon to deny funeral rights to Catholics.
Other dioceses have sometimes denied funeral masses for mobsters, including John Gotti, in other cases across the country.
Some priests accused of sexual abuse have been granted Catholic funeral services, including John Gagan, the Boston Archdiocese former priest who sex abuse case, helps spark an A.C.Y. Church scandal.
You fairy!
McCusker owned club montage and I club plopied over Gays and rebar a gay bar. Several gay community leaders said they planned to file a formal protest with the diocese and demanded a proud apologize to McCusker's family in memorial service from her cousin was held on Friday, moved to an Episcopal Church in San Diego.
Because the Catholic Church, they don't like owners of gay bars and stuff like that. They do like pedophiles like father Gagan.
A father Gagan.
You fairy! He's riding in hell right now. You can be sure of that. He's molested little boys in hell.
You think? Probably that's spanky from spanky in our gang. He's probably down there.

Introducing new Catholic life, the religion with one third to guilt of your regular fate. New Catholic life satisfies your need for Christianity but it doesn't fill you up with a lot of doctrine.
More of a billion! More of a billion!
Catholic life, there's no confessions, no sermons and no lingering afterlife. It's the perfect alternative for modern agnastics who don't want to take any chances.
Our services are held three times a year and there will be 15 minutes long. Plus there's no added guilt for sneaking out during communion. We've dropped that too.
Look for our church reveal in your neighborhood. Hey, you might be in the front queue for ye of little faith. Try Catholic life because a little faith is all you need.

Nobody is called probably a city of a near anymore because the guy branched out. They got it used to be like the family.
You know how that is? The family opens a restaurant and one guy he branches out and opens up another one. They change the name outstanding.
Right across from Basque and Robins here. Taff Street. And what would that be? The other section of the street? I have no idea.

All these restaurants you're raven about. I'm sure a lot of them are very, very fine. They're excellent. But I'm sorry. Call me, pre-diguse to whatever, but many literally nothing like it. Especially that little restaurant downstairs that I still don't know the name after all these years. Boy, it is so good. We don't want you to go there.

a fair share. He's in square in pants. He'll tell you if you like your job. Then you'll give him a last dance. And if you tell
Bill Riley, you're not looking to be his. He'll do the pant right off you. And for you an extortionist. All the factors fair and balanced. But not when he calls that night.
He's looking for a lasty who likes it a little to the right. When Bill's all Riley's warning sure it ain't the no spin don't. So when Bill Riley's
silent you best not pick up your phone. Oh my God 146 14 go to a little piece of a see out. Go cheese. You know what's in that 7 11 spot that one of the rap stay actually mentioned a see out. Go cheese. Everybody's getting into
the ass. The other cheese now. I want to warn you one thing. It's very, very rich. Yeah. Now I may sound ridiculous. I have to talk about ice cream but certain kinds of cheeses and certain other kind of like real thick like like French dishes are really very rich. And if you'd
a lot of them like to make it really sick. And I'll get you out. You know and you're told block the size of WC fields know as things like that. OK. So a little ass. The other cheeses good but too much ass. The other cheeses not good for you.
Oh, yeah. Jesus great. By the way, during the break I did it on my own. My mind must be clearing from my ice cream cobweb. Nicolas. That was the restaurant in Pemberpins. You ever hear of Nicolas? No. No. But it was on a corner there of I don't know taft and something Douglas maybe is that sound right? No, it's not even close. But anyway, it was there on tap street in Pemberpins. It was pretty good. That's probably not there. No more 5 6 7 0 5 60. That's one thing with restaurants. But that's the first thing you see when you've lived in the city. I don't know. I don't know.

Ladies and gentlemen to keep our economy growing America must reward corporate criminals and I have done so
Because a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable
We must punish the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs
especially for women and minorities
And an urge Congress to punish hardworking people who want only to provide for their families
But most of all I have a message for every American who is 55 or older
Our social security system has serious problems that will grow worse with time
In the next four years we must mass murder
Those now retired or nearing retirement
Our aim is to kill many
And best of all the leader of this nation wide effort will be our first lady
Laura Bush thank you and may God bless you now
You're fair
Bye bye bye
