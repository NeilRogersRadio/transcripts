Yeah, wow, wow, wow!
Yeah, Neil Rogers, weekdays from 10 to 21, 5'16, 2 a.m.
Pretty good hits to our part there.
Jimmy Hangers.
We wrap up another morning with you.
We're all dead, Toronto.
Yeah, but his music lives.
Oh, I see.
And his drums live on.
No, I never talked about it.
Beast was saying Santana is a great guitar player.
Oh, I hear it.
Beast would know a guitarist from his ass.
I said, this guy and Eric Clapton were the best.
You have an Eric Clapton still trying to grab that kid before he falls out the way.
Yeah, well, he didn't have great hands, but no.
He had bad hands.
He didn't have quick hands, but he had more tasty strata.
He can play the guitar.
Maybe you want to contribute to our poll today.
What is it?
What South Florida athlete was the biggest stiff of all time?
Did our sales manager play sports?
Come on, boy, you are.
This is the first day after Memorial Day holiday and you're already on a tear.
Pickin' on pork curtus.
Oh, well.
We are sold out.
He specializes in something to ball.
Well, I see a lot of trades on here though.
Somebody is making out like a band.
His bust among...
I think who we got on here so far.
Yeah.
So, to me, in other words, you won't duplicate.
We got the more tasty strata.
You know what? He wasn't a bust.
We got Ray Lucas, Jay Feetler, Peter R.L., Steve...
I don't even know who Steve Emmetton was.
You know what? I wouldn't vote for any of those guys.
Junior Felix or Bobby Humphrey?
In order to...
Well, I'm asking you.
In order to be a bust, they haven't thanked something up before they got here.
Yeah.
And Ray Lucas was a backup porter back.
It was nothing when he got here.
Yeah.
I'll say a Cecil the Diesel.
Cecil, he just wanted to give a look.
Cecil Collins.
Okay.
That was a pretty good size bust.
Yeah.
They also brought...
That's what he was looking for.
They also brought...
They also brought...
...Philips here.
I remember that.
Or, as Philips was good.
He's one of my favorite...
one of my favorite jailbirds.
Yeah.
Guess who I was just a challenger from...
one of the sports channels here.
And guess who they had on there from the Canadian football league.
The Matrix Underwood.
Oh, I remember him.
And they were just saying, well, he's got a few physical and mental problems.
Yeah.
Other than being crazy than a bed bug, he's just got a little bit of a problem.
I want to think of other...
It's too early for Al Lighter this year, I guess.
He's still...
Although he's off to a...
He's certainly buying for it.
For it.
For $8 million, I thought...
I'm sure they thought they were getting more.
Send it back to the broadcast booth.
He was good, though.
Marlowe...
Yeah, I got one.
I got one.
Yeah.
Harold Minor.
Okay.
He was the first draft pick of the heat one year.
Yeah.
And they called him Baby Jordan.
Hmm.
Never made it.
Never talking about a Verin Jordan.
Or maybe they were talking about Barbara Jordan.
It could be.
Let's get him on there, Josh.
Yeah, Harold Minor.
Harold Minor definitely knows on there.
He could win.
He should win your poll.
I'm actually missing Kamal probably liked Harold Minor.
He liked...
He liked Minor.
Is that he?
I got it.
Right.
Well, maybe the audience didn't see him.
It's rough to spell out.
It's early in the morning on the day after a big...
I had a bad...
See, everyone going with...
God, but I'm just...
Don't have...
I just don't use...
Stupid.
Yep, really stupid.
So I have a new...
I have a new plan.
That is if I get up a certain amount or more, I just walk out.
That's regardless.
That's what I do in Casino...
Boy, right.
Blackjack.
I said what I want to win.
Right.
And what I'm going to lose.
And if I would have been doing after a year, I'd be a pretty good shape.
Yep.
But although I think I told you this story about this guy.
I know he didn't even work.
He went to Las Vegas.
Got how to at the craft tables.
Yeah.
And 10,000.
And lost it all back.
And I asked him, why didn't you put 5,000 in your shoe or something?
I would take it upstairs.
He said I wanted to win 100,000.
I don't want to say especially, but you know this Berkeley.
See, George likes anybody, anybody who wears a dress.
So therefore he covers up for Berkeley and defends her just vehemently.
But she's...
She hasn't got a clue.
She doesn't even know where the front door is.
I have no comment.
Although quite frankly, we don't come in the front door.
But...
Yeah.
I've got a line for that too, but Joyce wouldn't like this.
Just thinking about George lighting anybody in a dress.
Yeah.
So anyway, what's the Belmont story?
Is that this Saturday or next Saturday?
No, next Saturday.
That's right.
See, I don't like that.
Why do they do this three week stuff?
It's too long.
So you don't sustain the interest in the public that way.
Well, there won't be much interest in this Belmont.
No.
Now, how many are we going to have about 10?
9.
Yeah.
It's right now there are 12 possibilities.
Yeah, but they won't know one.
No, I would say probably at 10.
They'll get 10.
And you know why?
Because they pay off for the first five places.
Right.
And it's such a crappy field.
Yeah, but haven't we seen?
Yeah, that's right.
Of course, the only time they'd chase them away is if there's some like superstars and great...
Well, even if there is a superstar.
It was like yesterday, Ghostsapper, who was the best doors on the planet ran.
Well, there were only six horses in a race.
And one of them, I'm like, what is this horse doing here?
He has no chance.
Well, if he finished fifth out of a six horse field, he could pick up some money.
Yeah.
So that's why they run.
Five-seeing bell months were...
It was a pretty small field.
What?
Six or five or six months?
Oh, yeah.
I think one secretary ran...
It was that way.
But this is...
You know, outside of a fleet, Alex, it's just a bunch of horses.
So there's the chance for...
Yeah, the fact that he could go in his nose and steal the molars to feel.
That tells you how crappy they were in the pre-cancement.
Much a garbage.
But you never know.
You remember...
Set him to the glue factory.
That's what I say.
Set him all out there to the glue factory.
What bring you there were known, you know, a couple years ago,
the horse with a triple-crown opportunity, charismatic, broke down right before the finish line?
Happens.
Yeah, like Bellamy Road.
Yep.
Well, he didn't break down.
No, I didn't break down.
But he had lost his chance for a road to redeem himself in the pre-cancement bell month.
Yeah, this horse had a legit chance to win and then, you know...
I was...
It was Chris Antley.
I think it was charismatic.
I may be wrong about this.
You just remember Chris Antley was riding him.
Well, he won't be riding anymore.
No, he won't see him.
In fact, I remember him.
Although, he saw him at the elevator and remember I mentioned that.
Funny.
There was really something.
You must have had a...
Last but not least, you don't have psychic experiences with your gambling because you'd be making millions.
Hey, just last year, a Harold columnist wrote about how what a great thing it was
that they were keeping Stuart Elliott on.
He said, hey, there are a lot of riders they could have gone to.
One of them they mentioned was Chris Antley.
There's a good Harold mistake.
Yeah.
I told you about Barry's big mistake.
How about Ron Jerkot?
They could have put him on there.
No, hardly.
No.
But how about Barry?
Last week, right?
How about Barry?
Wayne doesn't want the Marlins and the Marlins aren't interested in staying.
And while he writes that, Wayne's people were meeting with the county manager to offer them a deal
where the Marlins could come in, stay for nothing.
The county would build a retractable roof.
The Marlins would get the all the sweet and club seat money from baseball sales
and the concession money and play their rent free.
That Barry, he's on top of it.
Yeah.
And he writes, no.
That's a Greg told me.
I don't think they're a thrown in vitamin anymore.
No, they don't speak anymore.
Now that they have been in a disastrous relationship, the Harold and at 790,
we'll see on Thursday when the trend comes out, the big impact that 790 the ticket is making.
Yeah, now that I'm out of deal.
Mad dog has been on the air for a while.
Yeah.
So we've got no issues.
No, the consistent skates will not for a while as opposed to January when we had like, who's on first?
Absolutely.
That's right.
It's programming.
Somebody faxes in Brian faxes.
He says Lawrence Phillips and Cecil Collins, both of whom he mentioned.
And how could you forget Sammy Smith?
Oh, yeah.
Well, Bob has had a whole run of those guys.
I remember a game against the Packers that just sticks out in my mind where he fumbled in his own end zone.
And right, I'm a one-year-zone one-rear line.
Never forget that.
Yeah, well.
He was just choking and gagging all the time.
Sammy is, I think, still incarcerated.
Is he really?
Yeah.
Oh, he did a big ticket fall.
You know, if you look up the Dolphin's history, they have more guys in jail and they have an all-of-faint.
Right.
Well, it's easy to say that now that we don't have the games anymore.
Oh, you could say it before.
Now, what's the story with Ricky Williams?
I mean, nobody really believes he's coming back to the Dolphin's, do they?
Dolphin seems to think so.
And they're going to take him back?
Well, he owes them all that money.
That's what that's all about.
Right.
He does like Phil Henry in that lawsuit at IOD.
He's taking a Brian Cox.
He's got, well, whatever happened with that lawsuit.
They settled Cox, Brian Cox against Cox Broadcasting.
Yeah.
There were a lot of idiots involved in that deal.
Cox versus Cox.
Right.
If they have the trial, I have a deal.
Yeah.
That's what they call Cox fighting.
Right.
I was leaving that one to you.
Okay.
Hank will be suspended by the way for the rest of the month.
So that's why today's last day of the month.
Damn it.
I thought you were going to get a good deal.
So anyway, Sammy Smith will stick on there.
So get him on there, Josh.
I guess I'll have him here.
He probably got some tracks to make as the old saying goes.
Yes.
Let's see what we got.
Outers five minutes till the first race it would buy.
The exacter, triactor, win place.
The first race from last night.
So I can tell you the winners now.
That would be a good scam.
I've actually people who have done that.
It's called fast posting.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll bet you 100 bucks that the six horse wins.
Yeah.
They're nice.
We'll pull that off.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh, that was the big scandal in the breeder's couple of years ago.
Right.
The guys are betting after the race was over.
Well, how about the, you know, we used to play at, well, I was in Michigan at Hazel Park in Northfield
Downs.
He used to play the off.
Now, you can't do that at Thirbrough Racing because they, you know, they're in the starting gate.
But at Harnessed Racing, you know, when they follow the starting gate to the start,
and there's like a, the gate pulls away and they don't really, there's a split second before they actually
reach the starting point and the bell goes off.
And especially in the trot, not so much pace has been in a trot where they tend to break more often.
And I have a friend standing at the window and then you'd be standing out watching the horses going to the gate.
And then you'd yell either yes or no.
You'd already pick out the horse you wanted.
There are, maybe you'd pick out two like the four or the six and you'd yell six because the four just broke or whatever.
Yeah.
And the cast a few tickets that way.
Not a grand scam.
Yeah.
Now, let's not start talking about the track.
We'll have the whole audience gone now, man.
It's just for old Jews like us.
I'm out.
See ya.
You too.
Bye.
Have a good day.
I guess we...
I'll go down the hill with KC K-Sum.
Hi.
Hi, KC K-Sum.
Welcome back to our countdown of this week's top 20 ringdones.
We're up to our number one ringdone of the week.
But first, our unlimited coast to coast, long distance request and dedication.
It's from Jessica S.
She writes, dear KC.
Recently, my sister was caught lip-saking on national TV.
At first, she blamed her band.
And then, she blamed her asses, reflux, whatever that is.
Anyway, KC, since everyone thinks I'm the stupid one in the family,
could you play Green Day's American Idiot for my sister, Ashley?
Signed Jessica.
So, from Jessica to Ashley, here's your unlimited coast to coast,
long distance request and dedication.
That's American Idiot from Jessica to Ashley.
Now, on with a countdown.
KC's coast to coast.
But first, let's recap our top three ringdones.
Coming at at number three, Rondo Alaterca by Mozart.
Number two.
At number two, that tune that sounds like art and soul, but isn't.
And now, this week's number one ringdone.
Number one.
For the third week in a row.
Walls of the flowers.
This family.
There you have it.
The top 20 ringdones in America has tabulated by phone bill,
Boyd Magazine, tuned in again next week.
But it will once again count down America's top 20 ringdones.
I'm KC KC saying, keep your volume turned off.
And keep reaching for four bars.
We're going to have the public as turning on our president day on Iraq.
40% approve in a way his handler Iraq 56% does approve.
How do you like that?
They're fine to catch it on a little slow.
Maybe another 1600 dead people and they'll say, hey, that's not going so good.
The reason I played that.
A cell phone ringtone appeared set to top the British singles charts yesterday.
Did you see this?
Yes.
Outstanding the new single by the Van Coul play by nearly four to one.
Crazy frog Axel F.
A ringtone based on the son of a Reverend Swedish mole pad.
Is the first whom being used on mobile phones to cross the mainstream music charts
had generic style the way spokesman for HMV, the British music retailing chain.
Goes to show them silly ass brits.
Thank God Americans and Canadians don't use those stupid ass ringtones.
Oh, they do.
Boy, you're like in a restaurant all of a sudden.
Yeah.
Oh, brother.
Cool play.
I hope to go straight to number one on yesterday's British singles chart with its new song,
Speed of Sound.
But by Saturday, it was pretty obvious the ringtone, which is available for digital download
and as a compact this single, would prevail.
The ringtone was expected to replace the Oasis tune Lila as the number one hit on the list
released some day by the official UK charts company.
I haven't checked the update on this because quite frankly, who gives a crap.
The weekly singles chart, which has been released since 1952, is based on the sales of
56 hundred retail shops across Britain.
You silly ass brits you.
You constipated fools.
While crazy frog and other ringtones don't appear to be much of a hit among adults,
so many youngsters are personalizing the sound of their cell phones that such digital music
could change world music markets.
Music purists might not be too happy at the prospect of the crazy frog outselling cold play,
but it didn't come as that much of a surprise when he considered it's huge novelty appeal
and the massive amount of exposure it's currently getting said to style though.
The ringtone is based on the song that was recorded in Sweden nearly a decade ago by 17-year-old
Daniel Malmedall using the high-pitched revving of a two-stroke motorcycle,
the International Hero Tribune reported it over the weekend.
Thank God they're in touch with the important crap.
Great. Excellent.
By the way, Eddie Albert said, we'll get to that, but it's already 10-14.
See, that's the good part when we do that long cross over with the Humper.
Before you notice, like almost time to say, see ya.
Maybe we could try that tomorrow, just go all the way to the end of the show.
That's nothing he'd be too happy about that.
From beyond it.

just three-day weekend I've encountered in a long time.
Where the hell did it go?
I thought we had like a three-day holiday.
Some of us not you of course.
But I just don't get it.
The good news is I didn't eat any
hogging ice cream over the weekend.
Aren't you pleased?
Aren't you proud of me for that?
Great news.
The bad news is that after I made that bad decision
at Woodborne yesterday of sticking around
instead of leaving with my profits,
I went to the, get my free, free for $900 meal, you know?
That's a joke.
You lose whatever you lose.
No, it's a free meal though.
Just to show me your little card there.
And you can be a voucher for a free meal.
Well the food there really sucks.
I have to be honest with you.
677 votes on Georgia's silly-ass polly
took yesterday.
Now how did yesterday go?
You only had three hours because you had the Marlon game.
You know, one's lost to the pirates.
Can that be right?
Wow.
That's got to be a mistake.
But anyway, so how did yesterday go?
Pretty good.
Oh and finally, we played tunes, took a couple calls.
What did we play tune?
What was that?
Well, tune is like a song and music.
Yeah, I know what it is.
We played music, and took some calls.
It made an attempt.
Near.
And there you go.
Well, I think the model that people who recall
I'm a moral day would be.
I have no line.
Right.
In fact, that's the model of most people call any day.
I have no line.
For example, WQAM, hello.
Yeah, I can't go to Neil.
Speaking.
Is that Neil?
Speaking sounds like me.
How you doing today?
Is this you?
This is Leo.
Sounds just like you.
Yeah, how you doing, Neil?
Good, good.
I want to talk about the heat.
Good.
Talk to somebody else about it, somebody who cares.
See what I'm saying?
What else is there?
We don't want it like that.
The other few turns that we didn't know.
I got no line.
Right.
677 votes.
And George Watton, what are you doing
on a moral day?
Well, winning out was a ditto in myself.
215.
I don't want to say what you said here,
because that's joy.
So get really up.
Yeah.
She's a real joy soul anyway.
Working like any other day, 169.
Well, that would have been you guys.
And I can't believe that.
What kind of people work on a moral day?
Cops and robbers.
Robbers.
BBQ.
Old barbecue in 97.
Drinking 73.
I hear a lion, man.
A lot more of them were drinking yesterday in 73.
In fact, the ones who were working,
like the pilots, things like that.
Drugs 41.
Played with my friends 29.
I think that goes back to the first.
That's a little bit.
Yeah.
Going to the beach, 27 to beach to beach.
Well, how is the weather over the weekend?
It was beautiful here.
Wow.
It's just the sun is shining, man.
It's like in the load of mid 70s every day.
Gonna be a little warmer than that toward the middle end of the week.
Sunny every day.
No rain.
It's beautiful.
You see that?
They're talking about that hurricane season stuff again.
Crank calling radio show is 19.
I have no life.
And blogging seven.
Oh, brother, blogging my ass.
How did you do that?
That is so sad.
So anyway, here's today's poll.
We got some dimbo kimmy on there.
I haven't taken a look at her yet.
As a matter of fact, she's just some chicken.
I'll tell you one thing that Mia, whatever name was, the toley.
Wow, she was really prime meat if you asked me.
Oh, I'm only seeing from the eyebrows up.
It looks like Phil Henry with a wig.
Oh, I guess she's okay.
You just have to get used to it.
Oh, those aren't real.
Well, that's not even whatever.
I think it's close to being real.
Jesus, I'll see the board and can't be impressed.
I touched them.
They're real.
Yeah, right.
You touched them up as what you mean.
Look at all the different pictures we got of Kimmy.
Yeah, we got both.
Oh, we got more for your money.
Oh, don't say that.
Marvin will call it.
That would have.
At any rate.
So on any Albert die.
Anyway, he was a 99.
That's certainly more than old enough.
But on the other side of that coin, though, you wonder, well, if he was 99, couldn't he
have at least stuck around to make that 100?
Don't you think when you get like in your late 90s, you're open?
Yeah, he made it to 100.
Wouldn't that be the one thing you're looking for?
There's not much else to look for when you get to be that age.
I don't think because I don't think too many of my girls are in really spry, great health.
But I like to make it 200.
Then, you know, like my mother did, she died on 91st birthday just to prove that I was
wrong.
She always had to prove I was wrong about everything.
I said 90s, old enough.
And so just to spite me, she made it to 91 and then she croaked.
So there.
Yeah, so there.
And that shows you now.
What's out Florida athlete was the biggest stiff of all time?
That's our poll question today.
Comprehend didn't seem to be too impressive.
I was all the way.
Notice he didn't have an easy time of adding to it, though.
And there've been so many stiffs in a sports world in South Florida.
Somebody mentioned here on this one, Brian, Chris Wells.
Oh, yeah, get that on right away.
Remember those ugly days?
That's my bad.
That's my bad.
Of course, remember can be responsible for that.
Give me all that hockey talk on the show.
It's just like Hank and I, similar later every morning we wind up getting back into
that horse racing thing.
Don't let us do that again.
Play the buzzer or something.
Zap it.
Zap it.
You got it.
Because that's bad when we start with that.
No, it's fine.
I did those.
Old guys, it's smoke big stowies.
And go to the track with their binoculars around your neck.
And you know, like, you need to geek you.
And that's fine.
But nobody else out of the age of 100 cares about that.
That's the problem with racing.
Because that's an old folks thing.
You know, when I had the big races, all the kids come out to get classed in, you know,
party, uh, all our crap.
They're kicking it.
Ancient style at the track.
I bet you George and Josh will be at the track before the week is out.
Which one?
Anyway, we got the don't care.
I'm not a sports nerd 76.
That's leading by far out of the first 234 votes.
Don't care about the sports period.
Jay Febler 31 and our more testy's distradas got about 30 minutes.
I'm out on Jay's ass and most pretty jealous.
Ray Luke is 29.
So that's a good battle we got going there.
Sammy Smith's got a dozen.
Lawrence Phillips 10, Peter were all 10, Harold minor 8, Crescentle got 8.
Steve Emmentman, which I still don't know who that is.
Who is that?
I think you mean Emptman, EMT.
No, you have to go with the donuts.
I'm just putting it on here the way that, uh, Sean, the, uh, Faxor's sent us to us.
I don't know who that is.
I don't either.
We still got eight votes.
So they must know who in your field of seven and Bobby's Humphries got five.
So far.
Now the grand, do we have Chris Wells on there?
So did you put Chris Wells on there?
He's going to go zooming near the top.
The point counts to introduce him as the first good amazing man of the year.
He's in the middle of the world.
Maybe hockey, so maybe a fight.
He will, yeah.
Sam Santa, you heard him play his Grammy performance with Rob Thomas.
And on the latest hit with Michelle Branch.
Everybody wants Santa on their song.
So we compiled a CD collection of every artist Santa has ever played with.
Like, M&M.
Two set of applause girls go round the outside.
Round the outside.
Round the outside.
The Dixie Chicks.
Andrea Pacheli.
Santa's a mix for everyone CD, including unreleased tracks from Carlos and John Tess.
With some of your journey will end.
I'll be there for you as well.
Yes, he's a guitar playing whore who will play with anybody.
Except of course Kelly Clarkson.
A moment like this.
No way man.
Santa's a mix for everyone.
Order now and receive a personalized bonus track for Santa's pleasure.
Very own birthday song.
Happy birthday dear Santa.
Call now.
That's for the beast who said this morning, court of the Humper, that the Santa is the greatest
guitarist in the universe boy at beast man.
His taste is in his tush.
That's what parents tell us.
Is that where it is?
Bad news from a rack again, although things are really going very well.
Oh, we're fine.
And your vice president says, oh by 2009 the war will be over there.
That's only four years more.
That sounds pretty promising.
Four US flyers and an Iraqi airman died in the crash of a single engine in Iraqi Air Force plane.
The US military announced today.
The plane of High Wing their craft was one of the seven used by the Iraqi military for surveillance and transport.
According to a statement today.
And there you go.
They just keep on dying and flying and dying and that's it.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, the pound 5, 6, the neighborhood of the United States.
The United States of America.
The United States of America.
The United States of America.
The United States of America.
The United States of America.
The United States of America.
The United States of America.
The United States of America.
The United States of America.
The United States of America.
The United States of America.
I beg your pardon?
Thurall Ravenscroft.
Who's that?
Tony.
Tony the Tiger, he painted the gun and was setting the Grinch song.
Well, I'll be damned.
And that's that.
Well, this goes on here.
And Jimmy Carter.
And Margaret Thatcher.
And Tony Blair.
And what's his name?
I'm a fart.
That's right there.
Celebrating this is a crap.
Larry King.
Larry King's 85th anniversary.
WKYM.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
I got a good sleeper for you.
We're a poll there.
Okay.
The original big ol'
Oh, that's a big...
That's a strata for an original.
See, that would be a good idea.
Of course, he's leading the poll, you idiot.
I just got through it.
No, he's not leading, but he's on there.
And I just get through reading the list up and down.
Yeah, he reads it.
Yeah, he reads it.
He reads it.
The original big ol'
Oh, come on, he's on there, man.
He was the first name that we had on the list,
although he's not leading.
Not even post-leading it.
And then he went near J. Feeler.
Although he is, he's only five votes behind.
In fact, more testies is gone.
Stop turning, man.
Yeah, there's a sleeper for it.
I have no line.
See what I was saying before?
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
Hey, nearly...
Yes, sir.
Happy day after.
One for the poll, nearly.
I don't know if he's on air, man, and out of the car.
I'll be on the floor.
Ronnie, cycle, please.
Okay.
Thanks, Pally.
Thank you, Pally.
Ronnie, cycle, you got it?
We got it.
Interesting to see the way Josh spells that.
Where could probably Google it?
I don't understand how he was a stiff, but, you know,
I'll put him on a phone.
Hey, that's this guy's opinion, okay?
The toast master ain't supposed to give his opinion.
Just keep that in mind.
Oh, and speaking of Josh's court, it's already 1035.
And you just are really...
I'm embarrassed by your recalcitrance
to congratulate me on finally coming through for you.
Yeah, sorry about your bad.
No, seriously, I didn't say it was going to be a listener
that was going to bring you the food.
I said, somebody would get food to you in that bowl.
I was hoping for pizza, but nevertheless.
Hey, you know what?
I would have rather gotten what I got than pizza to be perfect.
Well, there you go.
So you're welcome.
Yes, thank you.
Yeah, you're welcome.
Now, what day was this?
Friday or Saturday?
This was Friday.
Friday night, yes.
Of course, it was already prearranged.
So it kind of like takes the bloom off it.
But that's probably the best way, because otherwise,
you know, they got to go through security
and set it up ahead of time and find out how they get it to you.
Right, no.
So our good friend Troy, from Balance for Life,
called up our other friend Troy
and he got to be on our poll today.
Oh, no.
The whole number of 20s here was.
That's what you get for Steve.
He was just kidding.
Look, he's got a good sense of humor.
Plus, I got him money.
Oh, yeah, here's a good one too.
Some other good ones coming in.
But so anyway, Troy from Balance for Life
brought the set over a whole bunch of food
for Josh and out.
Anybody else dig into it?
Or do you hog it all?
Yeah, we couldn't eat all the food that he got.
Really?
Yeah, we couldn't do it.
Roxy.
Wow.
But you guys are welcome to, OK,
even though they're out of time.
They're in Pittsburgh where they lost.
I can't believe they're playing a four game series.
That's a little bit strange.
And Monday through Thursday, I guess, goes with the holiday.
They just play one with the mess.
A bigger part.
No, they just played a four game series with the mess.
I understand that.
Now, they lose all four.
They got swept.
No, they won't be lost.
The three out of four.
Yeah.
That wasn't good.
And they just lost to the Pirates yesterday.
So after the 50th winning streak,
they fall on hard times.
But then that's why it goes to Braves.
So I lost yesterday, too, which is, at least,
to watch them, though, as a little girls team.
On a really bizarre call at home,
I saw that home run thing.
Be sure that this morning again,
where the umpire has changed the ruling
on a callable foul.
Right.
Why can't they use instant replay?
Like, we are honestly goodness to people.
Well, we're the fun being there.
Yeah.
So anyway, the food came and they brought you all kinds of good stuff.
Burgers and stuff.
Oh, yeah.
We had chicken fingers, burgers, sandwiches, nachos.
You name it.
We had it all.
Wow.
Thanks a lot, Troy.
From Balance for Life.
He was looking for a free plug and he got it.
It worked.
We're easy.
You give us some food or give you a plug.
That's all.
Food was.
So that was good.
I told you it was somebody who would come through for you.
And like you said, it was even better than we could have anticipated
with some mediocre pizza.
That probably would have been like cold by the time they got it to see anyway.
So anyway, we're adding Eric Kumoro to the list,
according to this fact here, which is a very good choice.
I remember that.
Who?
Eric Kumoro.
K-U-M-E-R-O-W.
You know I remember her name Eric Kumoro?
No.
He was the Dolphins number one draft pick.
When?
Back in 80-something.
Oh, him.
I remember I'm weird.
I-O-D.
And I remember Joseph Gackie coming on here.
Eric Kumoro is going to line up for the Dolphins and we all went like that.
Yeah.
Like, are you kidding me?
And John Vosa of the Dolphins.
It says here.
You got those?
We got them.
It says Kumoro was the pick that finally told me that Brian, the brainstem had gone all
the way around the bend.
Vosa was just a delicate flower whose body couldn't stand the rigors of the NFL.
Eric Kumoro just flat out sucked it says.
Yeah, Eric Kumoro was going to line up for the Dolphins.
That's what Joseph Gackie said.
Where's the Gackie?
Oh, so get a personality transplant.
Please, Joe.
Or just get one install.
Or get a transplant.
You have to take out the old one.
He doesn't have one.
Replace.
That's bad.
But it happens to be true.
It's very sad.
And what I also didn't realize sports fans.
See, I'm not, I don't, I'm just out of the loop.
This ACC tournament that the hurricane's really sucked in the last big time.
Yeah.
And had nothing to do with the college world series.
The regionals are still on the way.
Of course, yeah.
Well, what do you mean, of course, I thought that had something to do with it, but it doesn't.
That's the ACC tournament.
Right.
That was the ACC tournament.
And as a result of that, nothing.
I guess the winner of that would have gotten automatic invite to the college world series.
Is that the way it works?
That's the way it works.
Well, they didn't win.
So anyway, but the point I'm trying to make is that the regional tournament.
I think it was being announced.
I don't know, it over the weekend sometime.
Do we have any information on that?
God forbid.
No.
Because if that's the case, George, I'm just mentioning this in passing that maybe later.
Now, is that the end of this week it starts?
Wait, we're finding out more.
Oh, we're getting information right now from our hurricane connection.
Up, up, up, up, up.
And I'm thinking to myself, we might just scan another one of these 10 o'clock in the morning games.
Because I know when the regionals they do was sometimes have three games on one day.
Well, the first one's starting at 10 o'clock in the morning.
Oh, right.
Okay.
I wouldn't want to say that we want the hurricanes to be playing 10 o'clock in the morning.
What?
It certainly is a possibility.
Okay, what's the information?
Actually, they're playing Friday at seven.
And they win.
They play Saturday at seven.
So, all right.
Geez.
Like I said, screw the canes.
Flation, scan a life.
The sea at the fly again.
Flash the canes.
Flash the canes.
Flash the canes.
In town at the turn end.
Flash the canes.
Flash the canes.
Wash them all right down the old Charlotte boys and girls.
10.45 at five.
Six.
Even the Grimm's for retail.
So you go down there too.
Okay.
All the bubble miceys, all the silly stories, all these hate filled tomes are invented by man.
Speaking of hate filled in bubble miceys, what's the reason it going on about?
You know, he doesn't do these news conferences unless he's going to waste it.
It's not a news conference.
The weeks ahead will bring important decisions on spending bills.
Well, that's good.
Anyway, you want to know what America is really all about.
This one story to me, and I know that it's flying in the face of the popular culture
because America's got this love affair with guns, man.
They love their guns.
They're obsessed with guns.
Two to five.
See, I want to say something really revolutionary, which of course you'll just laugh at.
And that is that all of this business of shooting any kind of guns for sport, for fun,
that should be outlawed immediately.
They're all in the house of you!
Find another hobby.
I have no idea.
Okay, take up stamp collecting.
Take up bowling, shuffleboard, anything else.
Forget about using the, oh, we want to go out and shoot.
You know, in a range of all too bad.
At home on the range, crap.
That went out with the cowboy's Indians.
Oh, I'm sorry.
But this story from Tower Minnesota, a four-year-old boy was fatally wounded.
He's dead.
In other words, they don't want to say killed.
Fatally wounded.
When he wandered behind a paper target, while family and friends were practicing shooting authority said.
Evan Davis, class of Shisego City.
Careful.
What is that?
Is that a misprint?
Is it Chicago City or Shisego City?
That's what it says here in Minnesota.
I never heard of that.
We're shot about 145 p.m. Sunday at Lake Vermillion, where a group of about a dozen people gathered for the Memorial Day weekend.
How nice!
If we were in the Joyce and Way, baby.
They thought they had the kids under control since Sergeant James McKenzie of the St. Louis County Sheriff's Department.
While the paper target didn't completely obscure the child, he was wearing camouflage pants that made him difficult to see against the foliage McKenzie said.
Right.
Well, it's better than we're in Zubas pants.
Oh, yeah, that's good parenting there.
Right.
Oh, that's right.
Make sure that if he does happen to wander into the shooting area, that you can't see it.
So that also mentioned that he was wearing a hat with deer antlers on it.
No matter fact, now that you mention it, a 40-year-old man fired a handgun about 30 feet.
A 30-year-old man!
He did the target into the boy.
McKenzie called the shooting as a pretty straightforward accident and said no charges were likely to be filed.
The man's name and relationship with the boy were not released.
How was this boy?
Oh, four.
I was going to say maybe Miss Kamal was led out for the holiday weekend.
It's a little young, even for him.
After the shooting, people rushed the boy to the nearby lodge.
Emergency medical workers arrived, but he was already dead.
He's dead for a year old boy.
Because Americans were out there having a good time.
Good old country shooting time, man, on Memorial Day.
Like in Haya-Lia, I've been shooting off.
I think they'll be doing like on the 4th of July, which I don't realize was a Cuban holiday, but nevertheless, it will be on the 4th of this July.
You can be sure of that.
Now that's what the Americans do is their pastime, the Brits.
You love this story.
Contestants in a traditional British cheese roll and competition.
Broke bones and took skin off knees and elbows yesterday in their pursuit of a giant piece of cheese down a steep hill.
Must have been some hard cheese.
The Americans are busy shooting each other.
And the British are busy chasing the old cheese.
Oh, man!
The competition in which participants hurled themselves 640 feet down a hill after an 8-pound piece of cheese has been celebrated for centuries in Glossester, whatever the Glossester was, or Northwest of London.
Glossester sure.
Glossester sure, I don't know what it is.
Glossester's doctorate.
I don't care.
The Thracist doctor originally from a Heathen Festival to welcome the spring.
Oh, see, that'll teach those bloody Heathen bastards.
The first person to follow the cheese across the line at the bottom of the hill wins the cheese at a small cash prize.
Probably just a few pens.
Not 30, man!
30 pens.
Thousands of people attended Monday's event at the local ambulance service reported three people taking a hospital with suspected fractured limbs while 18 were treated for bruises and abrasions.
And said, it's got a picture of this kid who's been extracted with a stretcher.
Ha ha! No!
Chris Anderson, 17, clasps his double Glossester cheese to his chest as he waits to be taken away on a stretcher suffering a sprained ankle after claiming first prize in one of the races in the ancient daredevilsport of cheese rolling at Cooper's Hill in Brockworth, England yesterday.
The 7-pound chuck of double Glossester cheese can reach speeds of up to 70 miles an hour and many of the competitors suffered like I just said.
Ha ha ha!
The Cooper's Hill cheese roll includes seven races in total for them downhill.
Oh, gee, a two-bedded hover didn't know, but he might have made a few bets on those.
The pain was worth it, Chris said.
The cheese is going straight in the cupboard when I get home.
It's definitely not for reading.
I would think not.
Organizer Richard Jeffrey said yesterday's event ran smoothly.
The injuries were down from the previous years.
It's a good part of the local heritage and tradition we like to keep on growing.
So like I said, Americans are busy shooting them all off.
Anybody who might get in the way is just rolling their hands away.
And the Brits are chasing their cheese.
So they are silly as a bunch of old coots.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.
What's up Florida athlete with the biggest stiff?
Let's take a look at that QAM lineup and see how we're doing here on the day after the last day of May.
We got Mo with the two.
Mad Dog with 4, 6, 30, Marlon's on deck.
Marlon's in Pittsburgh again to take on a pirates at 7, 0, 5 followed by the Ed Camplein Show.
Now what's that stadium they're playing at now?
That's about the 18th new stadium they've had in Pittsburgh.
They had like a Forbes field and they had three rubber stadiums.
And what's the one there now?
I'm not sure.
Oh, what do you mean you're not sure?
You're supposed to be our contact.
We just got your Fed on Friday and you're like, let me just down here on the Marlon information.
That's bad.
Isn't it like Tri-Com, Triple Com, you know, I need the right for you.
I'll look it up.
I'll look it up.
I don't know what that is.
It doesn't mean we can't even get in there.
It's just amazing to me that three rubber stadiums wasn't really all that old in the first place.
As wasn't a cross-leaf field.
Now what was the one in the PNC Park?
Oh, well who cares.
What's the one in Cincinnati?
They have Riverfront after Cross-leaf field.
They originally played when I was like a great American ballpark.
Yeah, see, I mean, every, we got to have a new ballpark.
That's the thing.
That's a good new ballpark for the Marlon's.
I'm like in five years we can build another new ballpark.
What was wrong with the old ballpark for Christ's sakes?
WDQYM, hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
I got a bit for you.
No, but.
Hey, uh, Alec Kessler, Miami Heat.
Okay.
I don't know if you remember him, but he...
No, I don't pay too much attention to that crap.
I do remember the name though.
How about that Heath, by the way?
Then Heath, those Heath.
Go, Shack.
All right.
Go.
No, I don't care.
But it is interesting that everybody said, oh, they can't compete with Detroit, man.
They can't compete with Epistons.
Well, I guess what?
Looks to me like they won two out of the first three.
I could be wrong about that.
But even somebody who doesn't give a flying rat's ass about it knows that they won two of the first three.
Didn't they, Josh?
Yes, they did.
Sure, so did.
How about some A.H.L. hockey, the St. John's Maple Leaf?
We're all going to have 437 loose on the power plate.
For the loose around the power plate.
Let's watch a little bit of that.
Or.
That's a little bit.
Here comes Eric Smith.
I'll probably knock him in the way.
I had the drugs kit.
You talked about it, Paul.
I'll be there.
That grits you, man.
What does it mean, man?
Hard to answer like me.
You got it, Jack.
Well, that's enough of that hockey crack.
But they are having some fruitful talks these days, especially after the ESPN said, hey, we're dropping you guys.
And that's just too many to even forget about it.
And they're saying, well, gee, you sure with that, we want to like get our act together.
I see if here's a hockey one, even though I don't want to put a lot of hockey ones on there,
because the Panther organization has had such a succession of stiffos on there.
But that's even worse than talking about horse racing with this audience.
They just have no interest.
S.A.T.K.N.
That's my choice.
I'm sorry.
E.S.A.
T.I.K.K.A.
N.E.M.
T.I.K.K.A.
And he and S.A.T.K.K.N.
who had a very stellar career, on and off through a bunch of different teams.
But not with the Panthers by the time it came to the Florida Panthers, he was already just figure skating.
He was just out there for a skate.
And seeing these big figure H, you know, like he was involved in some Olympic skating competition.
And he didn't even work up a sweat.
Nice going there, Bo-Tai.
Good old Bill Torrey and the VM Brothers man, they were really something.
S.A.T.K.N.
And there were so many of them.
Like for example, there was the other noted Norwegian guy or a Swedish guy.
I don't know his name.
I'm in the wrong guy.
Oh, come on, you can do it.
I know Peter War El on this list.
He was the black guy.
And he was a stiff.
I don't know.
Stiff would be an understatement.
He was just a brawler.
He was a dirty player.
Yeah, I got a straighter guy.
When I went to see him play, all he would do was kick people.
Right.
He was just a fighter.
That's all not really a player.
No skills.
Couldn't skate.
It was always falling down, tripping over the blue line, things like that.
I was going to say Anders Erickson.
That's the other, a Scandinavian guy, a real stiff.
But you don't want to put that on there because you won't get any votes.
They don't know who that is.
There have been so many.
So many.
Nice going there with that Panther organization.
How are the Panthers doing?
Any interest?
No.
Even a little bit.
No.
WDQYM.
Hello.
Robert Swela.
I get out of here, Robert Swela.
He was an all-star, you idiot.
What a moron.
She is, it's actually a place where the mate believes for a while.
What a jackass.
Robert Swela.
She is, who I'm saying about hockey knowledge in South Florida.
How about Pavel Burry?
You want to put him on there too?
You idiot.
You moron.
You jackass.
You, uh, you fairy.
WDQYM.
Hello.
Yes, Glycer's got a power play.
Yeah, Bet you like watching it too.
Wow.
Bye, 6-7.
Ever see Jeff Striker?
No.
In fact, next Memorial Day, Jeff's going to shoot her.
WDQYM.
Hello.
Hey, fellas.
How are you?
Pretty good, Pally.
What do you got?
Great, Cheryl.
I wanted to just mention this.
The University of Iowa was open in about 1971.
I remember going to the first game ever played there.
Child.
As Bob Prince would say, it was the confluence of the Ohio, the Allegheny, and the Mananga,
the Healer Rivers.
That is correct.
The Reservoir is a middle.
That is why they named it three rivers for those who really care about such crap.
So, 71, and then when did they open the new ballpark?
I don't know.
I lived down here ever since.
So in other words, maybe about...
Bob Prince!
Maybe they were slated.
They got to have another new ballpark.
It's just getting pretty ponderous, man.
It's pretty soon there will be a ballpark in every sweet corner.
I shout old when I heard it was staging that I went to when it opened.
It had already been torn down.
Yeah, that's that's that's that.
And how about me?
I remember when I was became a pirate stand, we were playing in Forbes field.
So what does that say?
Another in their third incarnation.
So I'm just an old goat.
It was a big deal because they had moved into the new state
and they were following a World Series win in 7-year 71.
71.
Over the world.
That's when Clemente had that great World Series, right?
Yeah, and chicken on the hill with Willie Stark.
Chicken on the hill with Will, baby.
Now we're talking Bob Prince, baby.
Now we're talking real broadcasters.
He ain't no girls a gackie, thank God.
And he's still dead.
Thanks a lot, Billy.
Thank you, and Doug Gowas, great team.
Right.
See you in the nursing home.
Okay.
Now we're getting old.
Hey, that's the way it goes.
It feeds the alternative.
10.40, 10.56.
Look at that.
The first hour is gone.
Holy cow, before you know.
It's going to be time for another vacation.
It'll be the fourth of July.
It'll be the summer's schedule.
All these things are coming along, man.
All of these things.
Wow.
So much to look forward to.
Russia's saying the same thing.
Now I know.
This is the Neil Roger shell.
It's a $30,000.
That's just a money.
Oh, go, go, go, go.
Any questions?
Right now on Access Highway 1.
It's the Leno.
Could you talk about your day at the Michael Jackson trial?
I guess I could.
It's been good for like a thousand jokes.
You last got to think about it.
I know.
I was called by the defense.
I made defense witness.
So apparently they've never seen this program.
Michael can't be happy about this whole thing.
Michael was furious when he got these allegations.
The one thing that I was going to say was that Michael was a
20-point.
He became so angry.
I actually got some color in his face.
So how does Michael think this whole thing is going to work out?
I think Michael is 20 confidence.
He says today he's got to have a big party with the number of my
grandchildren.
He's a good example.
E-Y-O-B.
Bring your old boys.
Wow.
It's a lot of our two or five seats.
Did you have a problem hearing the beginning of that?
It was just a my end.
I don't know what you're talking about, but I guess.
Oh.
In other words, it was just fine.
I didn't hear anything.
What does that mean?
I didn't hear anything wrong.
Oh, I see.
I thought maybe just the one paying the attention.
What?
Uh, Michael's suggestion for the poll says the facts you hear is
earthquake any blake.
I also seem to recall they got busted for drugs in Canada
sometime last year.
PS, whatever happened to you, your book about attacking them
at a fade table.
PPS, one when your old whammy shows the available on DVD.
Cute.
Yeah, that book's coming out.
That'll be the same day that the, uh, uh, uh,
uh, uh, Berkeley gets a new account on the show.
That's when the book's coming out.
Uh, Michael faxes and says the biggest if I ever had the
source of witnessing down here has got to be Robbie Neetermire.
Let me tell you about the day that, uh, I was invited to lunch with Jeff
Himmer and his wife and Robbie Neetermire at, uh, Chilles.
Oh, everybody saw grass.
All right.
I've quoted this many, many times.
I was invited lunch, but then again, guess who bought?
You.
Yeah.
It says, for all of the aftdlers faults and God knows the returns of them,
his heart and effort could never be questioned.
The same could not be said for old Robbie, what a waste of space.
Robbie Neetermire.
You got it on her?
We did.
Neetermire.
I'm not going to tell you how to spell it.
You worry about it.
Eventually it says here's some jokeable call and say Dan Marino or Pavel Burry.
It's colors like those, and I'm sure you'll hear from them today,
who make me long for the WIOD days when you would start 69 necessarily answers
and put their phone numbers on here.
Oh, we don't want to do that, no, Moll.
We don't want to pay him that much attention.
It's more fun this way.
I have no idea.
You just don't really care anymore.
See, back in IOD, maybe somebody cared, why should we care
when our management people don't care, right?
If they don't care, why should we care?
We're not going to care more.
Exactly.
In other words, if they want us to care, we could care,
but they don't want us to care, and they don't want us to like stir up a bunch of crap.
So just don't forget about it.
And that's what we do.
We could pay the same whether we check it out or not.
It says in conclusion that in Redneck Backstreet Minnesota,
who accidentally shot the four-year-old kid,
should be accidentally gang-wrecked and prisoned non-stop for 20 odd years,
until he's accidentally executed by accidentally lethal injection,
or even more accidentally electrocution.
Why do you like that?
It says Michael.
Well, there you go, Michael.
What can I tell you?
Yeah, a little kid gets blown away because of the head of a camouflage paint,
and then behind the target.
Oh, gee, I can really tell it was a kid back there.
He's kind of like blended in.
And here's this moose call.
Go play with it over there behind the target.
Right. That's it.
5, 6, 7, 8.
He said, look more like Charles Antler's every day.
And pound five, 6, 7, 8, Verizon, and Singular Riders line.
Oh, I was speaking to that.
You know, the juicy man.
What the hell's his name?
Oh, I don't know.
The Redneck.
What's that?
What's that?
The Jackal Lane.
Yes, you do.
Jackal Lane is not the juicy man.
He is now.
Okay.
So you know what's the infomercials on Sunday?
There's nothing else on you, but you already heard the other day.
Well, Sunday is loaded with him.
It's either eat the press and at fat face, the Tim Russert,
that red face, fat face, buffalo freak,
or it's infomercials, Ron Popeel, and it's Chef Tony.
And there's the flavor wave of Deluxe Seven, man.
That's a great, that's the best investment I've made in years.
That thing is fantastic.
But then there's also this other crap.
Oh, and I know what it was.
Remember I was forgetting about last week I was starting to talk about the internet on my
blueberry, blackberry?
Yeah.
And then I kind of lost my train.
Well, I forgot it again.
Okay.
5, 6, 7, 8, and I just handed it there on the tip of my tongue and just kind of like,
you're going to get a lot of that these next three years because it is all designed.
Yeah, no, no, the drugs help a lot too.
Oh, yeah.
That'll do it every time, especially here.
No, what it is is that I can't stand these, and that's just on the blackberry,
about any website, like the Harold.
You've been looking at a website for years, no problem at all, the Harold sucks.
And then you like click on it, like, oh, well, first you have to register.
That's all you have to do.
And then you have to register on your blackberry, it's almost impossible because it's just a
little screen and you've got to scroll and by the time it gets a dime worth it.
It's not just the Harold, there's a whole bunch of them that wants you to register.

He wants to keep it in the same stuff over and over.
And yesterday, Arlen Specter, remember Bush's Specter?
Yep.
Arlen Specter said that he's got enough votes to override the veto.
How do you like that?
How's the, put that in your pocket, Al President, say, you goofball, you do for you.
Don't tell a guy who's very much arming for that.

The statement addressed of in law and says rumors that Al was wounded seriously enough to come in combat to seek treatment at a hospital in the Western Iraqi city of her body.

The speaker says, Al Zarkawi.
The speaker, blast president, bushes the dog of the yellow skin.
I didn't know Bush was Chinese.
It calls a Iraqi president, Jalal Talibani, a Zionist American in the enemy of God.
Damn God.
I challenge you if you are a man to walk down the street in any part of Iraq to speak your tongues telebani.
Oh, see what I was saying before?
The US and Iraq are the only two places that I don't want to walk down the street because you're going to get shot.
There are a bunch of crazy people with huge guns and although I will say they got more car bombs, suicide bombers over there, but nevertheless.
I got some good news for you.
Followed up to a star we had last week about that chicken.
And Rick's press California got a ticket for J-walking, crossing the road.
Okay.
A chicken that got a ticket for crossing the road is caught his way out of it.
The $54 citation for impeding traffic was dismissed Friday after a link and Helena Moore's attorney argued that the foul was domesticated and could not be charged as livestock.
It was a domestic chicken.
Stay law restricts livestock on highways but not domestic animals.
And like a dog, if you dog crosses the street, not going to get tickets for it, right?
I say.
The chicken was ticketed, marked 26 from impeding traffic after a wander down the road in Johannesburg, a rural mining community southeast of Ridgecress, California.
The Moore said they got the ticket because there were among several people who complained that deputies had done too little to curb noisy off-road vehicle riders.
So that was like revenge.
For last two and a half years, no one's been able to stop the kids riding their bikes in the middle of the road or the neighbor's dogs running around our hood.
Link Moore said, but when our chicken escaped and crossed the road once it became a huge issue, sure as official said the ticket had nothing to do with the Moore's complaints, do we believe in no?
Absolutely not.
When it comes to the attribute, it has to be classified as the sea of the biggest personality.
We all watch our sun, we Jesus have the truth.
School's radio bike is a sea of rock solid.

Yet President Bush told the public in September 2002 that a record launched a biological or chemical attack and his little is 45 minutes after the order was given and just before the invasion the President said facing clear evidence of parole but cannot wait for the final proof of smoking gun that could come in a form of a mushroom cloud.
The President and Vice President have artfully dodged a central question that the administration mislead us into war by manipulating and mistating intelligence concerning weapons of mass destruction and alleged ties to Al Qaeda, suppressant contrary intelligence and deliberately exaggerating the danger of a contained weakened Iraq, post of the U.S. and its neighbors.
If this is answered affirmatively, Bush and Shania committed high crimes and misdemeanors. It is time for Congress to investigate the illegal war in Iraq as we move for the 30 year of this endless quagmire that many security experts believe jeopardizes U.S. safety by recruiting and training more terrorists.
A resolution of impeachment will be the first step. Based on the mountains of fabrication, deceptions and lies, it is time to debate the I word.
Absolutely. How you like that? You go Ralph.
You go Ralph.
Go Ralph, maybe when Kevin is asked. He's a piece.
Oh, look at that. Iraqi President, President, and the Sodom trial within two months. They had a postponement because they got the closing arguments and Michael Jackson trial for it.

I'll leave you.
Thank God short hair.
Thank God short hair.
Who does?
Thank God the aliens have short hair.
You say short hair.
You mean like Ryan C. Cress short?
A little longer than that.
A little longer like Fabio.
Every time I get short hair.
All right, honey. Don't yell at me.
I believe you.
Where are you?
Can I pick you up?
I'm at a seven eleven.
Seven eleven?
Yes.
Could you give me a sloopy?
What?
Sloopy.
What?
Sloopy.
What?
Like a blueberry wolf.
I just think kidnapped.
I think it's your sloopy.
All right, I'll get a snow.
You really been kidnapped, honey.
You're my aliens in a blue van.
Aliens drop a blue van.
Like a Chevy van.
No.
Is it a Ford?
No.
What kind of van is that?
What?
It's a caravan.
No.
Does it have anything to eat?
Is it the probes?
No.
Folkies.
No.
Pradia.
No.
Like love to eat.
No, you idiot.
I'm not coming.
I'm staying at the seven eleven.
You don't want to burn me to eat?
No.
What?
No, I don't.
But I forgive you.
I don't care.
You can come home.
I'm done.
Come home.
I'm done with this sheet.
Bye-bye.
I love you.
Take it.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Take it.
I love you.
Let me tell you something.
Here's a fast-rehearing Miami.
It says America is in big trouble.
The unhival proof can be found at onegoodmove.org.
Click on May Archives.
The Marchecliffe of W's Feats last week.
Keterpult the propaganda.
Simply un-un-
Unbelievable.
The Aliebel says here.
Neil McGubby with us is here in Miami.
Good luck to you.
Harry Alprey for us.
Now, more bad news.
I got two pieces of bad news and one good news.
Okay?
All right.
Get the bad ones out of the way.
For Italian troops died in helicopter crash overnight in Baghdad.
Well, at least they were telling us.
And the governor of Anbar province was found dead after classes between US forces and
insurgents who abducted him three weeks ago.
Meanwhile, President Jalal Tallahbattie told CNN the authorities expect to put Saddam Hussein
on trial the next two months once we get this Michael Jackson business taken care of.
Now, bad news from Boston.
I've actually just knew about this.
What?
You know who died?
Who?
You don't know.
Well, I'm going to tell you you are so out of the loop.
For thousands and thousands of Spanish-speaking members of Red Sox Nation, one Pedro JP Villaman was the voice.
You don't know him?
Who?
The man who screamed until he was horse and lacked easily as he told fans about David Ortiz's mammoth home runs, many remeerers' adventures in Lafille and the team's miraculous comebacks.
Villaman, the Spanish language played by play radio announcer for the Red Sox Games, died early yesterday when his fort explorer,
a sight swipe to truck on Interstate 93 and he rolled down in a backman's land into a tree he would come out to dead as the same.
Villaman, the driver of the truck, was an injured no charges have been filed.
He was a... who is from the Republican Dominican.
And he's dead.
Okay.
I wonder you know here why he talks about how he described...
Then he also described the exploits of all the other Anglo players on the team, you know?
I would imagine.
I would think.
But you know everything has to be like Daniela Bastard.
Oh, we didn't win a series Miami.
It was us, the Killbins won a series.
That was Levan.
Levan.
Let's play that song by Elton John.
Levan, come on.
Not.
Now you want the good news?
Okay, we love you.
You already know, but you're such an anti-Christian.
You're such an anti-Christian and an anti-Christian slater person.
I think probably because you're anti-Christian.
So they're probably putting a name Christian.
Like Christian Brando, you probably don't like him too much either.
Hey, he ward her.
Yeah, about the bitch.
Actor Christian Slater was arrested man, hadn't early day after he sexually harassed a woman on the street police said.
Oh right.
Here's a picture of actor Christian Slater being escorted by the police in the New York police car this morning.
We're just like Christian Slater.
Slater 35 was taken into custody in an upper east side neighborhood of Manhattan after police responded to a call from a woman who said she had been attacked while walking said New York police are just married doority.
Basically grabbed a woman behind on the woman's behind.
Okay, a woman's a gas on the street.
So the adding that slater was intoxicated at the time.
Oh yeah, kind of like really don't name it there, huh?
I just might like grab your ass.
He's been charged with third degree sexual abuse as being held at the 19th precinct in Manhattan.
I'm expected to be arraigned late this morning.
Well, it's pretty late now.
Slater has had previous trouble with the law in 1997.
He was charged with three cons of assault, one kind of battery after he assaulted a girlfriend while intoxicated.
He's a bad drug drunk, I guess.
He served 59 days of a three month sentence.
He has started such films as Interview with the Vampire, released in 1994, broken arrow 96 and Heather is in 1989.
And he sucks.
I don't like them a little tiny bit.
We can't stand Christian Slater.
And he's a grumpy drug.
And he's a grumpy drug as well.
Now here's the big break from CNN.
W Mark Felt.
Can that be felt?
Was deep throat.
Who?
He was the number two man at the FBI.
I heard that.
All the speculation about him, I might have been this one, I might have been that one.
And here's the guy that nobody ever heard of before.
He's 91 years old, he's still alive.
And he's come forward and interview in Vanity Fair.
He says, I was deep throat.
To identify their sources and in a criminal investigation.
For one word, Bernstein Watergate.
Anybody remember that?
No.
Okay, I remember Nixon.
Huh?
No.
Okay, let's get some calls on here because we need to intercept some few calls.
So we can give as many possible steps on this poll as we can.
What's the off-road athlete was the biggest stiff of all time?
Don't care, not a sports nerd.
137.26% sold to this audience.
And say, Yamama, we don't care.
You won't make us care.
And we won't care tomorrow or week from Musica's either.
And you're like that.
Sammy Smith, 52, J. Feedler, 50.
We got a good battle going on.
More testies to strata 44.
Ray Lucas 40.
Harold Minor 36.
Lawrence Phillips 33.
Cecil Collins 32.
Eric Kumero 15.
Eric Kumero is going to line up for the dolphins.
Combangio, look, it's horse-sighted.
Peter Rorail 14.
Hey, speaking of bad grunts.
Steve Emptmann 12.
I do like his adonats, though, not.
Can't stand that intimate.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Better check my list.
It's right there.
Great.
We love everything.
We love everybody, everything.
If it's food, we like it.
Yeah, it's all green 11.
Chris Wells 9.
Who in your Felix 9?
John Boza 8.
Ronnie Cicley, or is that Ronnie Cicley's got 8?
Jamar Fletcher's got 6.
Bobby Humphrey's 5.
Robbie Needamar's got a pair.
Esa Ticken and 2.
Alla Kessler's got 2.
And Michael Snowden have any cause.
Nobody.
Well, first of all, he didn't play very long with the Panthers.
And secondly, there's no hockey fans.
I mean, big stiff is the understanding of the century.
Who do they trade for, Michael?
Somebody pretty go right, Warren.
That's right.
Like the 5th Senate.
A good player for a stiff.
Nice going to a great organization.
And they used to get really bad out of shape because I was ripping them in ass and deservedly so.
Uptight, thin skinned incompetence.
Somebody QIM?
Hello?
Yes, sir.
How are you doing today?
Sensational.
How about the...
The long gone David Woodley.
Oh, poor David.
I know.
But he's tough.
But didn't he play a super bowl, though?
Yeah, but he wasn't any good.
He was horrible.
Okay.
Well, at least he won't be upset by it.
Thanks.
David Woodley, Reston Peace.
He's a pretty good looking guy, though.
Woodley?
Yeah.
That's about all I can say for him.
And he is skin kind of turned.
Didn't he hit like, what was it, a liver thing?
Oh, he also had problems, I do believe.
Some kind of was it booze, I guess?
Whatever his deal was.
Well, you know what you play for the brain stem.
Lot of pressure.
Lot of pressure.
He just asked him, I have to say a lot.
Oh, right.
A lot of pressure.
Ask a Kimbobo camper.
He'll tell you.
Lot of pressure.
Remember the cure bees?
Nope.
No.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 in the horizon.
And those are the days, baby.
It's a whole different lifetime, a different era in South Florida's sports in football.
But we got the heat going out.
They went two out of three from Detroit.
Despite all the experts in the perverts, they couldn't like hold their Josh straps, something like that.
I wonder what they said about it on the Raptors channel.
Do you know that the Raptors are here?
Now they call it NBA TV.
And what are the heat?
What was the WFL, the World Football League, where the Henders' ridiculous name is like the Chicago Fire and the D-Front Wheel?
There's ridiculous names in all those little leagues.
Look at the Miami Heat.
Oh, it's not wrong with the Miami Heat.
What kind of a name is that?
It's like a collective.
I mean, you can't beat the heat.
There you go.
Yeah, I like that.
That's cute.
Two games to one.
After dropping the opening contest, here you go.
Let's share it for the heat.
The Miami Heat have responded by Widen Shack for president.
He'll be a good head of state in the defending champions into a near must-win situation tonight at the Palace.
The heats are the ones talking about playing with their backs against the Raptors.
What are they doing, George?
Man, that's my hero.
I was a big night for us.
The few this game for us, again, and we must win.
Because what happened at the Palace is always going to be hot.
That's how it gets to the fight.
That's how it gets to the fight.
That's how it gets to the fight.
We don't know basketball stuff.
A little bit too sports-intensively.
We don't want to get Claris All or get his hopes up.
Here's line 9, WDQ-YM.
Hello.
Go to lunch, George.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
When you've got a lot of, he didn't have to go to lunch.
He gets his lunch for free.
He gets it right there, sitting on his ass.
Honey, like that.
You're just jealous, Pally.
Hmm.
Wouldn't be good today.
The LTs from Halleys.
The LTs from Halleys today.
No charge.
One thing George Cortes is learning about real fast, man.
About the second day he worked on the maybe even the first day.
Free food.
What are the first to be in this business?
Most of the people don't make any money at all.
A few of us do, but most of the peons don't make it done.
But lots of free food.
And free aggravation and free lectures too all the time
from the intermediate management types.
WDQ-YM, hello.
Q-A-N.
Hey, how you doing?
Pretty good, Pally.
What do you got?
You got your war allen, Joe Serella on there?
Joe Serella!
I'm not asking you, depending on your okay.
In fact, they made him into a coach, so he's last long.
No.
No.
You ever coached before?
No.
It was the defenseman coach.
And of course, how can you be a defensive coach when you can't play defense in the first place?
C-I-R-E-L-L-A Joe Serella, got it?
He's going to get lots and lots of us, man.
From the ziggins of Panther hockey fans out there,
from the knowledgeable South Florida hockey crowd.
What is coming up?
Hockey show.
What are you saying?
No, no.
No.
This week's charity time range.
Advising you to put duct tape on your radio when I raise the morning color to vink for the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour.
Woo!
I'm dying out there.
You failed.
2004, your sucks.
Next year, we'll have more luck.
I can see it now.
I've been dealt pure mad cow.
Might even fight a cure for that guy, Mike, or more.
When you feel you're SUV, that cash will all be free.
Even when bush cuts our taxes,
Depthets will still go down.
And rather will not use taxes.
Osama will be found.
I know there will be peace throughout the Middle East.
All these will graduate in clear-eyed, will be.
So straight, please let it be a great year.
I sure hated this year, don't need wars or elections.
And no more flu infections, TV will be.
Cleaner and start junk will be leaner.
Let's all look up the bright side.
It's two thousand, two thousand, two thousand, two thousand.
From O2 to O2 we got Moa 2, the Mad Dog at 4, Marlon's pregame at 630.
Marlon's at the pirates again at the 705 at RPG XYZ Park.
And then any care for the game.
Here is a perfect example of what I'm talking about.
The South Florida knowledgeable sports favor.
I don't understand how you can have two much less even one sports station on the year.
In this town because they just don't know nothing about sports.
Even George knows more about sports than he hates it.
What Frank says, a perfect example of a South Florida stiff.
Martin's Stracca, well guess what?
Marty Stracca played a huge role in that big year run.
And one great season the Francis hadn't history of the organization when he went to the Santa Cup finals.
The acquisition of Ray Shepherd and Marty Stracca is played a big part in what they got where they did.
This is I believe the average more points of game in Pittsburgh than the average shots of game in Florida.
Absolutely incorrect Frank.
And the only reason you're getting sucked in because Hardass Dogma claimed that he never liked Marty Stracca.
And so the second year he was there he didn't play him a lot.
Unfortunately, he's a hell of a player.
Unfortunately injury prone but nevertheless one hell of a player.
You're absolutely incorrect Frank.
Get a life you idiot you.
You quizzling.
I have no life.
The typical South Florida hockey maven.
Now here's that deep throat story.
You think anybody cares?
No.
But we got to do it.
W. Mark felt.
That's not an act that's his name.
Okay.
W. Mark felt who retired from the FBI after rising to a second most senior position.
Has identified himself as the deep throat source quoted by the Washington Post to break the watergate scandal.
The President Nixon's resignation, Vanity Magnor Vanity Fair magazine says today.
Oh my god.
I'm the guy they used to call the authority told John the O'Connor the author of Vanity Fair is exclusive that appears in its July issue.
Felt 9.
Now 91 living in Santa Rosa, California reportedly gave O'Connor permission to disclose his identity after all of these years.
How many years?
I'm 30, man.
More than that.
The Felt family cooperated fully providing old photos for the story and agreeing to sit for portraits Vanity first stated in a press release.
Felt said he was only doing his duty did not seem to bring down Nixon over the cover-up of the break-in of the Democratic Party offices in the watergate complex in Washington DC.
I wonder how my old friends E-Gordon Litty is doing if he's still not eating any rats.
All right. This is E-Gordon Litty.
Well, good for you.
Isn't that incredible, huh?
W. Mark Felt.
Okay.
See, would be interesting if it was anybody that we ever heard of before anybody ever heard?
Oh, here's another one.
See, I don't know if this is if you'd agree with this because I don't think so.
He was a terrific when he played the only problems he don't play no more.
It says you forgot where he was.
Would you call him a stiff?
No.
I mean, he stiffed the team.
But as a player, he wasn't a stiff.
Sorry, Luke.
Once again, I'm going to question, I guess.
Because when he played, he was outstanding and he was a mild.
But nevertheless, here's a story that is just so typical, not only the gun story, but this one too.
The Rock Band Nine Inch Nails on Friday.
Have you seen this story?
Nope.
Nope.
Well, I need more than that.
The Rock Band Nine Inch Nails.
MTV presents Nine Inch Nails on Club 2.
Oh, they don't.
They think they do, but they don't.
Well, it's too bad I can't play that.
I don't know if the bleep is really good enough.
It's so big and long and long.
Is it?
Yeah.
You positive?
Positive.
So I'm keeping my...
All right.
MTV presents Nine Inch Nails on Club 2.
I want a wacky one!
I'm not good animal!
They have a thick thing's not on!
I'm coming to visit working!
No, you're not.
You're not over my bongep.
Nine Inch Nails on Club 2.
Only on MTV.
See, just to cover our ass, I threw a lot.
It's the case that I believe they'll listen to you know.
So there you go.
So what's the story?
The Rock Band Nine Inch Nails said Friday,
canceled plans to appear on next week's MTV Movie Awards
after the number of questions the band's plans
to perform in front of an image of President Bush.
See where this country is going?
No, I had not heard this.
Just like Sylvia Burlusconi and Italy,
an Italy man who owns a Rae-Uno, Rae-Due, Rae-Tri, Rae-Tri,
whatever it is.
No sat there because you're making fun of me.
Same thing in America very soon.
Coming to a country near you, very close to you, very soon.
Total, complete, ultimate censorship.
The band was played in a perform the hand that feeds
the first single from its latest album,
an LA time review called a song of warning against blind acceptance
of authority, including that of a President leading his nation to war.
We were said to perform the hand that feeds with an unmolisted,
straightforward image of George W. Bush as the backdrop.
Apparently, the image of our President is offensive to MTV as it is to me,
9 in Snails leader Trent Reznor,
a said in the statement posted on the band's website.
MTV said in the statement, while we respect 9 in Snails point of view,
we were uncomfortable with their performance being built around a partisan political statement
when we discussed our discomfort with the band,
if their choice was to unfortunately pull out a movie award,
when in doubt they pulled it out.
Good.
MTV is owned by a Viacom Inc.,
the corporate parent of the duly intimidated broadcast network CBS.
Once they worked over Dan Radler,
they worked over CBS, and then of course all of the other associated stuff.
And Janet Jackson, no forget.
So there you go.
And another one, right up the old same alley, Sally.
Maryland's largest school district, this is Rockville, Maryland.
Maryland's largest school district is scrapping sex education materials
that have come under fire for implying that homosexuality is a biological trait
and for demonstrating how to put on a condom.
Oh my God.
The Montgomery County School Board voted last week to rethink its curriculum
weeks after a federal lawsuit was filed by two groups who said it did not do enough to stress abstinence
or give opposing views on homosexuality.
You fairy.
Gone from the curriculum movie materials that imply that homosexuality is a biological trait,
excluding viewpoints of those who believe same-sex attraction can be overcome.
Also dropped was a submitted video that was to be shown to 10th graders
in which a woman puts a condom on a cute convert to demonstrate its use.
The school system had planned to launch the pilot program for eighth and 10th graders on May 9,
but suspended it for the rest of the school year after US district jugged
Alexander Williams issued a 10-day restraining order.
It was unclear how the board's action will affect attempts to reach a settlement
in the lawsuit brought by citizens responsible for a responsible curriculum
and the Virginia-based parents and friends of ex-gays and gays.
You fairy.
Oh God.
The district's curriculum will be rewritten by professional educators and consultants
and a 27-member of citizens that advisory committee will help oversee the process.
The board will consider the revision's next school year, but we're not ready for that quite yet.
It's only 2005.
As we keep turning back to clock, turning back those hands,
you can just see them now like they're on big Ben, man.
See these big right-wing idiots up there like just physically cranking their hands of the clock back.
Yeah, they're cranking it all right.
Yeah, they're cranking it.
Speaking of disgusting things, Nashville, Tennessee, I think this is ridiculous.
A mother faces criminal charges after she heard a stripper, did you see this?
No, but this happens periodically.
She hired a stripper to dance at her 16-year-old son's birthday party.
That's the way it goes.
In his Ferris, 34 has been in debt.
I wonder if he's keen to win Ferris.
Don't spell it the same I doubt it.
In his Ferris, 34 has been indicted by a grand jury on charges of contributing to the delinquency of a minor
and involving a minor in obscene acts.
The boy's father, the stripper, and two others also faced charges.
I tried to do something special for my son, Ferris, that it didn't harm him.
About 10 people on the age of 18 were also the birthday party in September, including minors who were not related to the family.
Police spokesman Don Aaron said minors are not permitted in adult establishments.
A person should be allowed to circumvent the law by having a stripper, a lady took all her clothes off,
and spent a good amount of time dancing around minors, he said.
A net Ferris took photos at the party and tried to have them develop a nearby drugstore.
Those pain in the ass drugs through employees notified authorities, police said.
You see?
Who are?
Yeah.
Digital camera is baby.
Who are they to tell me what I can and can't show to my own children?
The mother said.
How do you like that?
The stripper police.
And we got the chicken crossing the road police and the stripper police and the pot police and the looking at somebody cross on police.
But you just wait October 1, man.
I swear I think it would be any crap.
It seemed dangerous to you.
Just implore to blow their crap away.
Anybody?
Anybody your own life?
Kill them.
I have plans.
Yeah.
They look at you with that evil eye.
They blow them away and say, hey, I thought there were a danger, a clear and present danger.
Right?
That's good enough for the president.
What does that mean?
Clear and present danger.
I'm telling you right now.
All right.
Go to the trap.
Right now.
Nip it in the bud.
Bud.
Just before we do this thing here.
But how can we be promoting this hang on again tonight?
I don't know.
Did you hear the regio that we just played?
Of course not.
But I was going to be on with hang from 830 to 930 today.
Is that what it just said, Josh?
I didn't hear it either.
I think we're going to get going.
Now that American Idol is over, get ready for Animal Idol.
There was no one to get rid of.
Oh my god.
That was weird.
That is just like you could serve.
You sang like a dog, dog.
You did your dog.
I definitely couldn't do the part very well.
You have that kind of like naval time.
You know what?
It was just a complete voice.
Animal Idol.
I'm going to reach out with a hook in a moment.
Nice play.
You're very nice.
Animal Idol.
I'm fucked.
Okay, you want to play that regio again if you got it there?
He can back it up a little bit.
Yeah, back it up a little bit.
And the regio in too.
You want me to play it again?
Yeah.
Play it again, Sam.
You're right.
It says obviously wrong.
I'm not going to play it again.
Oh.
Well whose mistake was that?
Now that we want to point fingers, you understand?
It's crazy on the day after Memorial Day.
I don't know.
Somebody in there really screwed up big time.
I mean playing a promo.
You know, it's bad enough that we keep showing our ass.
Right.
The world every possible way that we can especially last couple of years.
But to be running promo is for something that was already on like hours ago.
I'm assuming that was this morning.
Was I around this morning with the Humper?
Yes.
Well there you go.
So that's all of the mystery right there.
Nice going Neil.
Thank you.
I was on this morning.
So what it should say is if you didn't listen to the Hank Oberg show, you missed our
winderman.
I'll be doing one to say that.
I'll be doing a windbag.
Because people say, oh, thank goodness for that.
We don't want to hear him.
What's out for the athlete was the biggest stiff.
Don't care.
I'm not a sports nerd.
150.
That's not a 24.6% by the way.
Sammy spent 64.
J.F.
55.
Oh, Ray Lucas 48 more testies distraught 48 as well.
Ever see him and Ray Lucas together?
Same person.
Harold minor 43.
Cecil Collins 41.
Lawrence Phillips 38.
Eric Kumero 19.
Yantle green 14.
Peter rural 14.
Chris Wells 13.
Steve Entiman 13.
For those fantastic pastries.
John Bozotin, Jr.
Felix 9.
Mark Flitzer 8.
Roni Cicolid 8.
Bobby Humphrey 6.
Robbie Neeter-Mire 3.
I mean, they're not really like kicking it.
Eddie Stahl?
Old style.
I'm not hearing it yet.
I mean, they had to open the program.
Yeah, I think.
Okay, well, WQIAM.
Hello.
How about our favorite Brian Cox?
Oh, yeah, he was a stiff.
As a human being, that is a player.
I don't think they understand the question or the terminology, okay?
Or maybe they should look in the mirror if you wanted to find stiff.
5.670560, Tom 560 and me Verizon and Singular Wireless Lines.
Even Joshua had to admit that Brian Cox, and even I would have to admit, of course,
I found him to be anxious.
Ah, he's very good.
He was outstanding and he was a wild.
I would have it.
No.
WQIAM.
Hello.
Is Hank on tonight?
Yeah, Hank's on now between 8.30 and 9.
I'm going to be on a minute.
Okay, stay tuned.
He's going to be talking about WQIAM.
Hello.
Maybe they should look in the mirror.
Yes, sir.
Hey, how you doing, Dave?
Okay.
Good.
Well, I don't know.
I only caught half of your bowl.
I just jumped in the truck.
And one of the biggest stiffs of South Florida here has got to be who they can suck up.
He was a stiff as a ball player?
Yeah.
What is wrong with you people?
They're just people.
They don't like what, which is what they usually do when they are.
Let me say a little bit.
Let me read the question again.
What South Florida athlete was the biggest stiff?
We're not talking about as a human being.
Maybe that I was a waiter.
And as a waiter, as a politician, as a shoe shiner, we're talking about as an athlete.
I mean, shouldn't the question speak for itself?
Like that.
You know, I always wondered exactly what Jennifer was talking about when she said, Floridians
down after.
I didn't really wonder, but now if there were any doubts in anyone's mind, I think we
now we understand.
We've answered the question.
Father Perinoia.
Jose Conzaco.
Right.
How about Danny?
What's his name?
Ayello.
Ayello.
And Danny Martino.
Jesus.
What are they going to get with it?
How about?
Yeah.
Put that in the same category as Jose Conzaco.
In addition to which what South Florida team other than high school, what South Florida
team did Jose Conzaco ever play for?
Well, if you count Tampa Bay.
That South Florida.
You better learn your geography, mister, because South Florida is not Hillsboro County.
Okay.
It is not Tampa Bay.
That's Central West Florida.
That's not even close to South Florida.
Well, how did you drive over to?
We never found the answer.
Oh, one fighter.
I told George, I actually didn't take the shortcut because there's actually two exits
for what the hell is it?
A mockery?
Right.
There's two of them.
So I don't want to take the wrong one.
Here I mean, so he played it safe.
Played it safe.
If you tell me which one it was, there's only one, there's only one route 29 or whatever
the number is of that highway.
But nevertheless, I'm ready to do.
Well, here we go.
Frank, listen, I'm going to tell you again.
I don't care about statistics.
Marty Stracker was a hell of a player.
I'm the hockey maven in South Florida, Frank.
And if you want, you can continue sending all the stupid ass fags as you want.
Anybody that would call him a stiff is an idiot.
Wouldn't know a hockey game if they slugged for a stuck four, four pucks in your eardom,
okay?
Got a shatter.
He did theirs.
He did that.
He was sensational.
He was scintillating a hell of a player.
A stiff is something he was totally useless who contributes nothing.
You don't understand.
You don't get it.
You just don't get it.
Jose can saco my ass.
And far be it for me.
Of all the people in the world, I wanted to defend it anyway.
He'd be one of the last ten, but nevertheless.
He didn't play in South Florida.
It's a move point anyway.
Plus, by the time he played for Tampa Bay, how old was he about 90 already?
Yeah, 95.
So what's the point?
WQAM, hello.
I know.
Yes, sir.
I have a couple in mind and I just am not sure which is the biggest of the ball.
But I think when the Marlins, the Marlins tried to build a team or honor as they described
it.
Yeah, he's on there.
Oh, he is.
I'm sorry, I miss him.
I'm on castrow.
We're on castrow.
He was a ball player and a person.
What about Bernadette?
Castrow.
I have a great day, Pally.
Yeah, I saw her on the sofa.
Remember, Bernadette, Castrow, why is she still doing this?
I don't think there's spots around anymore.
I don't know.
I know the one business.
Castrow convertibles.
Right.
And we liked him a lot, by the way.
We loved him.
I got five of them.
Right.
I'm going to go on by one right now.
I have a chip right up here.
But I don't know.
Bernadette Castrow.
Oh, I don't know what it is.
She was on IMS all the time.
Remember before the election?
He's a right-wing busher lover.
Bernadette cast.
Great couches.
Great couches, but bad politics.
Twenty.
Twenty-six after noon, QAAM.
Hey, for his dumb and big one step.
Yes, dumb and big.
Good, good, good, good.
Good, good, good boy.
Good, good, good.
Wrong solid.
I am he has the dolphins.
They're the worst football teams.
They flub the ball from goal to goal.
White goal was ever seen.
There on the ground.
That's where they'll stay.
They're never in control.
And when you say Miami,
you're talking toilets, holders there.
The Miami dolphins.
Miami dolphins.
Miami dolphins number.
I'm 18 in the week.
I'm 30 June.
Miami dolphins.
Miami dolphins.
Don't bet on them.
You'll always lose.
They don't know how to tackle.
They don't know how to flock.
Their coaches ought to tell them to.
With Benday and their Jackal Rack.
And they would run much faster.
And even in defeat.
When we go to the stadium, we'll see Miami.
And they're the Miami dolphins.
Yes.
Miami dolphins.
Miami dolphins number.
I'm 18 in the week.
I'm 30 June.
Miami dolphins.
Miami dolphins.
That's seen that hasn't got a clue.
Miami has the dolphins, but the dolphins have no fans.
Just 50,000 people sitting in the stands.
They watch the game and all they do is mone and gripe and bitch.
I wonder how Jo Rabi got to be so enriched.
And they're the Miami dolphins.
Miami dolphins.
Miami dolphins number.
How many teams in the week?
I'm 18!
I'm 18!
Miami dolphins.
I hear the crowd begin to boo!
I want to do it!
The dolphins have faith, Feedler, that quarter facts that you run down the field.
And he will throw a pass over you.
I'll never win a super bowl you shouldn't be surprised when he gets cut that doesn't mean that he was certain size in there
The Miami Dolphins
Oh, Miami Dolphins
Miami Dolphins number, how many jeans in the lead?
Hey, Cher!
Miami Dolphins
Miami Dolphins
Jake calls his signals in Hebrew
The dolphins have no defense in their offenses at joke like George Bush heating pretzels
You know they're gonna choke
They'll always disappoint you when they're in a playoff race
With fewer points than five marks on high-zingers of leaf-facing there
The Miami Dolphins
The Miami Dolphins
Miami Dolphins number, how what the hell, 32?
Miami Dolphins
Miami Dolphins
Miami Dolphins
Now they're through a dynamite
You failed
From 34 to 26 to 1, happy day after, to you
To the May 31, I still can't believe it's a June tomorrow
Yeah, that sounds very corny people always say that
Oh man, the time it is it's flying by before we know what they're in and I'm left
Just like they show today
Zooming on by...
Oh yeah, it feels like six hours
Fort None, for you it maybe
It's already almost 1235
Then after you know that it'll be like 1236
Former Oklahoma line batter Jackie Ship as SHIP
PP
Got it?
Got it
Jackie Ship, maybe his ship hasn't come in yet
Good day
What's our fourth athlete was the biggest step we asked today
Don't care, Matt is sports nerd
23.8% that number keeps going down and going down
Going down more than Kathy Willis
156
Sammy Smith 68, J. Feeler 58
More test needs to strut a 53, it's pretty good race
But Sammy Smith seems to have the ball right now, he'll drop it
Ray Lucas Fittie, Harold Minor 46, Laurence Phillips 42
Whatever happened to that old Kuth, they used to call
about Laurence Phillips all the time, remember that?
Nope
Think he had a love affair with him
Cecil Collins 42, Eric Kumero 23, Yankle Green 16, Peter Wirl 16
The reason I'm reading the list again is because they keep calling
with the same people we got on here
Chris Wirls 14, Steve Entomon 13
Junior Hunier Felix 11, Jamar Fletcher 10
Mother Fletcher ran on here yet, John Mosat 10, Ronnie Cycley 9
Bobby's Humphrey 6, Robbie Nidamire 5
Esatikin and Sri, Alakessler 2
Aramon Casco and Mike Wilson so far, they're tied with
The Big O
The Big O
Rock Salt that one
Hey, don't forget the Big O
Rock Salt 84, the Humphrey 5 to 7 every morning before Hank
Don't forget unless you can, 567 05 60
Tom 560 and the Evalyzen and Singular Rival Slides
WBQAM, hello
Hey, I'm about one from the dolphin, the Gammett the Gary Premium
What would you say that?
Because he had one bad kick that you remember like an idiot, Gary
Premium was a stiff, you're an imbecile man, oh god
Gary, your premium had a stellar career with the dolphins
He had the one bad play that this guy is remembering
We didn't thankfully for them wind up costing them the game
But remember that's how he sees all people remember of him though
Right, honestly, he was a hell of a kicker, he was good, he was in good
He was no more, you're all in Domah, he just wanted to hear that fit
He knew that if he said that I'd play this
He was a sports term, in sports parlance a stiff
If somebody who is a total zero, a loser can't do the job
Oh, is that what that means?
Yeah, even you would know that, even you, somebody is anti-specated sports as you are
Which you're militant and hard-ass about it
Yeah, even you understand that, right?
A stiff
Man, you people don't know your stiffs, I'll tell you that, you better bone up on it
5670560, pound five, assistant leave a rising singular right of a slime
This is the worst group of suggestions I've heard in a long time
WDQAM, hello
Well, time's fun when you're having flags, as soon as you're ready
WDQAM, hello
I really like to vote on the poll but Joe Serella's name's not on there
Oh, Josh hasn't gotten to it yet, he will right now
C-I-R-L-E-L-L-A, okay
He was probably one of them pre-sandwiches again, from Howe's
Joe Serella
Which I would agree, he was pretty weak but putter some better hockey suggestions
And they're like Chris Wells, Christina Wells and Mike Wilson
Mike Wilson deserves at least a vote if you're going to put a defenseman on there
He made Joe Serella look like Bobby Orr, how do you like that?
Bobby Orr, who's that?
Bobby Orr
Even George knows Bobby Orr
Who?
5-6-7-0-5-60
Hey, we're going to get hockey intensive if you don't watch it, okay
We'll have a spike
Go for it
You'll see
The Departments, you reach more money here, we'll leave Stevie
Huh?
They gave six to wrap up
Your bonuses, wait a minute
They'll be cut down and...
Hey, look at this, you won't believe this game that's on here right now
On the NHL network
There you're right
Trenton for Florida 2, you know what I mean
There's a number there and four Myers
What do they call that place in Four Myers of the...
They're on track and not allowing the average way to get through
The average of the Florida, the average way
But if you're going to get that right
As much as everything went so right for the average way
It's over the first 20 or first 40 minutes of this game
Trenton and Florida, how do you like that for big time hockey, huh?
What's that to like?
There's the first race you caught or getting ready to go
Although Bolgermore was infieldable, Reigns, they wanted more
What happened next remains the most controversial place
In Super Bowl 3
The block moving out 25 seconds to go on the ahead
Johnny, but yet to have seven nothing
There's a hand off the matty
Matty backed the ball on the place where he...
Here we go, why don't we win the In Zone
But they caught up in the back of the In Zone
So it's about 10 minutes right
We had a fair touchdown
And we've got the ball and he's here
Jimmy Orr, remember Jimmy Orr, see I just mentioned Bobby
Orr, you see how this is my second powers again
It's unbelievable
It is absolutely unreal if you come right down to it
You don't think?
What?
You're just Mr. Antisports
Not a jock but Jimmy Johnson
I would put him on there, he sure devours his ears
We got a shot
Well, I talked a big game
They're not talking about his UM days obviously
We're talking about his days with Adolphin
After he worked feverishly to make sure that Chula got canned
And then he talked a big game and came in here and showed us nothing
He showed us nothing but his big fat
Right, right
Oh man, it's okay
And I was just laughing all the way to the bank
Y'all getting up on there with a little bit of a retiree Bradshaw
Isn't he on it? That's the one he's on when Fox
Yes
Oh boy, what a perfecto that is
Jimmy and his Johnson

Let's see how to make a different product.
If you're a creator of a product, you're going to get turned down.
If you're a creator of a product, you're going to get turned down.

If you're a creator of a product, you're going to get turned down.
If you're a creator of a product, you're going to get turned down.
Because you call the wrong number.
Call the main man, Anthony Callie and David acceptance capital mortgage,
and one AAA483 loan.
That's one eight eight eight four eight three loan.
Don't forget every time they close a loan,
a forced note has donated the kids in distress,
and they also get to drink their coffee.
So why call anybody else?
Avoid the bait and switch.
Call the main man, Anthony Callie and David today.
One AAA483 L O A N.
Why comes to introduce this way?
God's sake, this way.
This is your brain being chopped to bits by a finely-honed meat feeder.
This is your brain in a blender.
And this is your brain being stirred into a big pot of chili.
Brains, real food for real people.
This is your brain being stirred into a big pot of chili.
Brains, unbegrant, cave, they found them trying too hard.
And they made them straight down and pulled a grass pit.
All the taverns and bridges, showed them bearing some skin.
It's a violation of the Geneva Cup and change.
But I'm placed my sea red.
From and bad, rest men, trial, ladies and said.
I've been boozed on a chest.
Now, it's one of someone he would done dressed.
Now, with no clothes.
I just can't look, I can't see anything.
And it's made me cold.
But I need so much laundry.
It's just a two-cat decide to wait till it's done.
Be by my side.
We'll try any questions.
Get this from Christy.
I need to wait till it's done.
You're alive.
I know it's Mr. Tyree White.
Back, though.
I'm sure they want to get him a real good Chevy Friday.
Slice his balls off, wouldn't you think?
I would think.
Or maybe just hang him from a town square somewhere.
Just hang him, stick him up there, what that statue was that they pulled on that photo lot for CNN.
1247 at 560 WDQ.
I'm happy to do it.
But, Tuesday already.
See how this week is moving right along its flying.
And, tomorrow, like the guy said before, with his convoluted crap, it's a Hunio.
Ain't it?
Yeah, that's what he is.
Good news, man.
On the beach.
They didn't kill anybody this weekend.
How do you like that?
All right.
That's on American, if you ask me.
Is that one of the road?
This year's hip hop driven Memorial Day festivities on Miami Beach were the most stayed.
They've been since Partigores Day claimed to be the city for the four-day holiday.
Stayed.
Crowds, though, younger were manageable.
You could walk south-east with ease on like years past when ocean drive,
Collins and Washington Amateurs were clogged for hours.
It was the old clogged.
But, behind the con, police were busy making 444 arrests from Thursday to Monday morning,
more than double a total for the same period last year.
Most were for Mr. Meeners, such as the certainly conduct, and drinking in public.
But, 80 were for our felonies.
Police attributed the rise in arrest to undercover units, patrolling the streets of first since
when the beach became a huge, morally weekend destination in 2001.
Before every police officer on the beach was in uniform and everyone knew it,
said police spokesman Robert Hernandez, who made a big difference having the plain clothes officers out there.
Yet the weekend was no difference for all of the quiet.
We had no fights or problems.
We were a bit busier than last year, said Tony McGowdy, general manager of the news, cafe, and ocean drive.
What are how Gianni Versace is doing?
Is he still showing up every day for his magazines?
Yeah, let's see, he'll do it.
This was definitely the easiest Memorial Day weekend yet.
Tiffany Fudja, 23, sipping a Peña colada at the Cleveland Rundling.
The smaller crowds were a good thing.
A lot of the routiness was gone.
I could walk down Collins Avenue without getting grouped.
What you didn't know the only reason for that is because Christian Slater was in New York.
Celebrities made occasional appearances.
Rapper Fat Joe held courted his Miami Beach condo Saturday.
Miami-based rapper Luther Uncle Luke Campbell released samples from his upcoming album at Perichungle on Friday
and launched a search for a spokeswoman for his book, Soup for the Freaky Soul,
these sex toys about the Luke.
But char-topping rappers who in the past were often spotted roaming the streets
for a missing an action, unless you count Joe Budden's lunch appearance at Big Pink.
Big pink?
You're fairy!
The dim-style wattage didn't go unnoticed.
This was supposed to be a celebrity weekend and nobody was here, said Miami-Staniel Thomas 21,
as she stood in line to get into wet Willie's Monday afternoon.
This is not the spot for Memorial Day anymore and it's really going down.
You're going down.
Can't imagine why.
Athletes were more omnipresent.
Willis McGayhee from the University of Miami, now with the NFL's Buffalo Bills, hung up at the Turntables
with DJ Iriah Cobra Thursday on Saturday and Marcellus Wiley of Jacksonville Dragouars ordered bottles of bubbly
at the ultra-expensive Prebay on Collins Avenue.
And Alan Iverson of the NBA Philadelphia 76 was spotted at a few hot spots.
Aren't you impressed?
No.
Who gives a crap?
But at least nobody got killed.
Hallelujah!
Come on, Sarah, things are looking up.
All right.
I mean, what's a good American holiday like especially when he's longer like the fourth of July weekend?
Without at least a few people getting shot and some high jinks and mayhem and stuff?
No fun.
More the same thing now, the trend toward the murder of the Dulling of America.
5670560, we're looking for stiff athletes.
5670560, I'm not touching that line with a ten-foot pole of choice, okay?
And 5670560 in the, whatever I'm counting, 5650 I should say, and I'm not touching that line.
Whatever those numbers are, you know them by now.
Why do we keep saying them?
Over it.
Over it.
WCOM, hello.
Hey, I'm Eric Hunt.
All right.
WCOM, hello.
QAM.
I think you're out of stiffs.
That's it.
WCOM, hello.
How you doing, Neil?
Okay.
For the pose of my master.
You're out in here.
You see what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Clueless, shoelace and clueless.
See that they don't know their sports.
That's the problem.
You know, it's amazing here these pumps call up on the sports shows.
Wow, you think they're track, yeah, yeah.
See, everybody knows that.
Even George knows that.
Who, even George has seen that on TV.
He made a couple movies.
That's right.
Really bad one.
Yeah.
Even they were us.
Terrible.
But you, seriously, I have said this for years.
As long as I've been in this town, there are, you could put the number of real knowledgeable sports people in a fimbled and have room for Hank's ass left over with.
It's just, it's amazing to me.
The lack of knowledge.
That's why I quit going to games.
People are saying they don't go because they enjoy it.
You didn't even understand the game most of them.
They just want to get drunk.
They want to get into brawl.
They don't have like, uh, these team there, you know, like those idiots in the hockey games talking each other on a cell phone.
Waving, hey, Miriam, I'm over here.
Ah, I did it.
WDQ way and Hello, not there on one Q.A.M. Hello.
WDQ.
W.A.M. Hello.
Um, yes.
I know who was this...
I bet.
Yeah.
Outlite her.
Yeah, he's bubbling under.
Okay.
Give him a chance to finish this season, better not.
We can put him on there.
They actually paid him eight million dollars.
First of all, he's 100 years old.
He's what?
No, go ahead.
He's a stiff, you're right.
Put him on there.
I see Josh wants to put him on there.
You better hope that Owlighter don't come into press box when you help malware on them games and give you what for.
And as a broadcaster, you know who he sounded like?
Who?
Who's the ex-dolphin?
I keep asking that it's Tony Martin.
Didn't Tony Martin do some of the pre-game season stuff with the dolphins?
I'm sure he did.
With who?
I don't know.
He's just terrible.
He's horrible.
And that's who Owlighter sounds like.
When Owlighter was in the booth.
Was Owlighter in a broadcast booth there?
Like a contract.
When he's done, he goes to the booth.
Right.
Who's getting canned?
Oh no.
Not Foxy Roxy.
Or maybe on the TV side.
Right.
Oh, I'll think it.
Well, they're sure he's not going to fire what's his name?
The color-grind TV.
He's great.
Tommy.
No, he's really good.
Tommy.
He's not going to fire what's Tommy.
He's not going to fire what's Tommy.
Tommy.
Don't tell me Rich Walls.
Owlighter ain't doing no play by play.
That sounds awfully gay.
Just stick him in there.
Let's have a three-man booth.
Maybe his job can be to do the same you do with Dave Ann Borden.
Poke him into ribs every now and then try to wake him up a little bit.
Hey Rich, put a little enthusiasm in.
In case we'd hurt.
I guarantee you won't make sure I'm paying that kid by the word.
WNQ-AM, hello.
Hey, how you doing?
Okay, sir.
I got a couple for your poll.
Yeah.
How about the hair liner?
He's on there, sir.
I just got to your reading and that's why I'm ready to give him.
Yes, in a bit.
Rock Berlin.
Rock Berlin, I like Berlin.
Berlin's one of my favorite cities.
Rock Berlin, wasn't he a hurricane?
You know what?
You're going to put people in college?
You never played for a professional team.
I mean, he's not the dolphin, is that?
He is?
Yeah.
Rock Berlin?
Yeah, he's trying to mess up a free agent.
Oh my God, are you kidding me?
That doesn't mean he's going to make it.
Oh, brother.
What?
I think it's sound really promising for those of us who despise the dolphins and that whole
organization like Poison, it's looking really, really good.
I mean, if A.J. touchy Philly is the best hope for next season, good luck to you.
I think four and twelve are going to look really good at the end of next year.
Thank God those other guys got it.
But I like you guys selling those spots.
Dollar a hour on the dolphin games.
WNQ-AM, hello.
NEO.
Yes, sir.
Here's one for your poll.
Any black quarter back.
567-0560, pound five, 60 in the horizon and singular wireless line.
WNQ-AM, hello.
Oh, yes, how about them?
What does that can say?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, he's got 100 votes.
How do you like that?
WNQ-AM, hello.
You're very good.
See, they have nothing.
I'm not taking any more calls.
They're, you can always tell when you reach that whole thing.
No, seriously, you know what I'm saying?
That's usually right people with a lot.
They got something to add and then that's it.
They run dry.
Because the real stiff arenos, the real guys that could, let's talk to the joint out.
They don't even know who the hell they are.
They don't know their names.
They don't know from nothing about it.
How could they possibly be four as one eight playing these days, but nevertheless four professional sports franchises in this market?
Is it possible?
No.
Is it for real now?
It's like Conway Twitty said, man, it's only maple leaf.
It's a joke.
In fact, that ought to be the model of some sort of sports ain't us.
See, the virus is going to go back and tag the bag before it can like, uh, take a lead when a guy throws the pitch.
Seriously, when I started going to we first handed the marlins the first couple years,
you thought they were playing like botsky ball or something out there.
These people didn't have a clue.
I understand though, it is a very complicated game.
When it comes to it, it's real.
It's real.

So, I remember 94 votes on the poll.
What's your floor of athlete?
And that bad news about the villa, darling?
Yeah, well.
What, how they...
And what's the other thing?
Oh, the Epicure.
That's what I'm thinking of also right there in Alton Road is the Epicure market.
Now, that's still there.
I'll bet you your life on it.
The Epicure is still there.
You ever going to the Epicure?
Nope.
What are we going to get good borst and good gazelle fish?
And all of these things, all those pre-wrap meal stuffed cabbage?
Mmm, man.
The Epicure.
W-A-M Epicure line.
Hello.
See it, I don't know.
Q-A-M, hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, is there...
Oh, I already got the answer, but the villa closed about six years.
The Epicure market.
Epicure store.
Okay, thanks.
See, there you go.
I like I said it.
I want to say five years, T-6.
I was close.
I just wish we'll think it.
I probably part of my mind knew the answer to the question, but to reset, that was such a great place to villa, darling.
And I would need the Easter Sunday's the best kishki, man.
Even George, even little Gory like George, became obsessed with the kishki, with the gravy.
Great.
Oh, God.
Now, see, what I don't understand is why is that supposed to be not so good for you?
I realize it's probably got a lot of chicken fat.
Flavored with beef fat.
Is that what it is?
Yeah.
Beef fat or chicken fat?
Beef.
Mmm, I mean, that's why it's so good.
I'm sure.
But that's before we realized that dietary fat wasn't what made you fat, wasn't bad for you.
And what I really would do, before I die, you know, I'm going to have again once.
What?
Now you're going to say sex.
Now seriously, before I croak, I want grubbiness.
Okay.
Now, we never got you those, did we?
No, we never did have any grubbiness.
Grubbiness are like fried onions, and they fry them in like chicken fat.
Oh.
I can't even begin to smell like chicken skin.
Chicken skin?
That's what you told me before.
No, I never told you anything about chicken skin.
You see, that's that Cuban thing, and you got skin on your mind.
Right, yeah.
Anyway, here's the poor result.
It's basically their onions grubbiness.
I do believe, unless my memory is the plain tricks of me, they're onions, and they're fried in like chicken fat.
Now, where would you go and get some grubbiness?
Me.
That's going to be the next thing.
We got the sandwiches, and we got all the, all those good burgers up there to the stadium.
Now, we're really going to have a challenge.
Whoever brings grubbiness to the stadium press box for a Josh will get our lifelong gratitude.
Are you waiting for grubbiness?
Well, I hope Troy's listening.
So, you know, back in the day when Jeff Cohen liked this, we could mention any of these things on the air,
and he would take care of us, but that's when he liked us before, skipping and burply pissed him off.
What soundthroat athlete was the biggest stiff?
Don't care.
I'm not a sports nerd.
23.8% of you just add him at just a bunch of hard-asses, like George.
189.
Don't give a crap.
Although, to be honest, they know just about as much about these sports as most of the rest of you.
Sammy Smith, 82.
Jew Friedlar, J. Feetler, 70.
More test, he's just throughout his 60.
Ray Lucas, 56.
How many minutes did he answer to play for the ball?
About 30 minutes.
That's when they're like part of one season, am I correct?
Yes.
And he's stunk.
He's stuck with a jet, and he's stuck with the offense.
What a surprise.
Cecil Collins, 52.
Harold Miner's got fitted.
Laura's fellow sport 9 is right on Harold's butt.

Yeah, right.
Miss Ranchan.
Tomorrow, Fletcher, 12.

It's Robbie Nidomire, he's got five.
Alakessler, four, Jackie Ship, three.
Esatikin' and three.
And none yet for Al Leiter, Josarella, Ramon Castro, or Mike Wilson.
When it comes to interesting things, we've got the best.
We've got the best.
Personality.
We're getting the watchers on the latest edition of Fletcher.
Who's video-fights the different?
She way in.
It's Dan.
What's all it is by any child?
So do you have five, six, four?
WQK.
Oh!
80 weight we can't say.
In addition to the far-downs, that choice took away.
But we can still say it.
Choice must have overlooked it since that's what she is.
So fat and fat.
80 points we can't say.
Like...
Yeah.
But last year, we have to please watch for his dance and play it today.
When you've had a color attorney's program radio shows,
especially a crop-arred blockadee hoe.
Oh, I need a hoe, hoe, hoe.
She plays with us like a duck voice.
We're lucky we could fill, say, do it, do it, do it, do it.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
80 points we can't praise.
Outside of have a seat here on my back.
158 and 560s.
The do I man himself, the Mole Meister,
Moe Howard David, who came along with two and then Mad Dog at four.
And we've got that Marlon stuff.
Don't forget all you people out there with your Dele Connections.
Get some grubbiness and maybe a little bit of Kishky.
Now let me ask you this question.
Do you have a microwave in the press box?
Or would that be like you didn't carry it away?
You can carry this one in there.
Yeah, carry that one in there.
Just you can do some stuff, heat it up.
I mean, what kind of a press box wouldn't have like a microwave
if you'd make some good food?
I mean, I don't know about it, but it might.
They're probably one up there.
I'm sure they're it.
You probably have all the necessary accoutrements.
Watch this year in New York, my hometown.
UConn is a 16-year-old polar bear with massive positive positive.
And some mighty stinky breath.
You can just enter his den and you can smell it.
It's a Dr. Jeff White, Director of Animal Health and Conservation.
Seneca Park Zoo, it's really kind of funky.
But after a procedure with Seneca Park Zoo last week,
veterinarians are hoping the odor of knitting from UConn's big mouth will
soon be a breath of fresh air just like they show.
After Zoo staff determined UConn smelly problem was caused by an infected tooth.
Why didn't team veterinarians extract it to be?
Two-floss small hammer and a chisel.
It was tranquilized and 805 pounds.
Maybe we can do that with fat boy, okay?
And pull out whatever is ailing him.
Bye, bye, bye.
