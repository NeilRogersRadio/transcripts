I'm late. Sorry, Neil. No problem. Take all the time you want. Take another hour. Take two hours.
I apologize. Henry Barrow back on. Oh, Henry was great. Didn't hear it. Oh, you missed Henry.
People lighted. They've got we got phone calls about. Yeah. Henry sounds the same. Oh. Oh,
yes. Oh, and he's doing well. And said to say hello. Hello. Thanks for ever to get that taste and smell
out of your system. Oh, he also said that. Yeah. Not any. I have just tasted your snapper.
Well, he's a gourmet, you know. I know that. Wine, tasty. Yep. Traveled a lot with Henry.
Went to three different countries with Henry. Really? Yep. What the Tokyo, I, well, I don't know
if he, I don't think Henry was there. I went to London with Henry and I didn't, he didn't make the
Berlin trip with us. But I think he did go to Tokyo. Do the Dolphin games. See the Dolphin games.
I was one of the Dolphin games. See the world. His daughter, boy, she's really something. His
daughter, I asked about her. She, she's teaching now at Coral Gable Science and Knockout. She's teaching
drama. Yeah. Well, the gunner looks from mom. Yeah, absolutely. He's an amazing woman.
Absolutely. Right. So what's going on today? What, no, what is happening? What's going on today?
We got the hockey settlement. Yes, we have the coach on. Oh, man. When was that? Around 9-15.
That frog, Jacques Martin. Yes. Oh, brother. I sure hope that you kept that short.
Welcome to the West in the world. Yes, I guess. Such as does anybody care? Do we have any fans?
No. Anybody going to show up? No. How much are they going to pump up the attempt? What percentage
of the gunner would have pumped up the phony attendance this year? Not third, man. Yeah. They said
they had, I saw this in the paper today, 8,000 ticket renewals last year, but or season ticket.
8,000 season tickets last year. My ass. Get out of here. That's what they're claiming. I don't
believe it. I'm not even close. She called you from... Oh, in other words, four last season.
Yes. Soon they would have played. Yeah. Right. That's like saying, if we were to play last year,
every game would have been a sellout. I mean, you know, go argue with that.
8,000 isn't that many? No, no. You're wrong. I think the last, the last number I heard two years
ago is down like four or five thousand. Yeah, but 8,000 isn't that many. Well, I mean, they're not
going to make it that way. Do you know what the average respite... And of course, the best part of
this is that all of these sports networks here, it's like, well, you know, people got to realize that
the unions still ask to ratify this, and I'm thinking to myself, having you people learn anything yet,
don't you understand that nobody can handle it one more second of this crap. They can't deal with
it. And the average response here, not there, here is, oh, they haven't played in so long. We just
don't care anymore. Well, I wonder if that's true in some other places too. Well, if it's true here,
it's got to be too just about everywhere. I mean, this is a... Oh, you're talking about Toronto. Toronto.
Oh, you're a hotbed, man. I tell you, Bob Ryan told me they don't care in Boston. There you go.
Boston is a pretty good hockey city with a rich tradition. So, right, I don't think it's going to be
easy. They always say all the fans will always come back, but you know, take a break. They never
ever... They never played again. Wouldn't phase me at all. And you know, that would bug yellow.
They'd be pretty upset. You wouldn't have a job, but... Right. In your case, you're a, you're as big
a hockey fan as I've ever known. Right. Lee Fans since 58, that's 47 years. 47 years, okay? Okay.
And if you don't care... And if they never played again, I couldn't care less. If you don't care,
I'm sure a lot of other people who are well, long time fans feel the same way. Just... And with me,
it's the same with baseball. Now, they were lucky that they were able to come back, but I mean, just,
you just get tired of it. The ridiculous salaries and the attitudes and the steroids and the lies and
the bullcrap and just who cares anymore, you know? Players really took a hell of people.
See, we got hockey on here all the time. They don't have to play anymore. They could just put on tapes
of some good ol' games and they have to play. And the thing of it is, the way they want to make all these
would not go into, they're all these rule changes that are coming. Basically, it's like saying,
well, the game really sucks, so we have to like re-ed design it to make it more exciting and more
interesting and yadda yadda yadda. That's what it boils down to. Yeah, there are a lot of rule
changes, and not just one or two. No. Of course, so we still don't know if they're going to all go
into effect, no-time games anymore, which... See, you want to know what this is all about, this whole
thing what it has been and continues to be all about. It's about what they call the bottom feeders,
which includes the Panthers, like Carolina and the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, teams that don't draw flies
that are hanging on by a thread, owners who've been sucked into, I think, and oh, you're going to
make a fortune known in a sports franchise like Alan Cohen. And so they had a cater to them,
as opposed to... That was the whole thing with very bent and you know, representing these owners.
And the other thing is, they don't have a television field. NBC is not paying any rights. That is
as opposed to contraction, which is the only thing they could do is say, okay, we made a bad mistake,
we expanded in the markets that can't and will never support this for nobody gives a crap there,
and just to get rid of them. Maybe they think by adding four playoff teams, it'll help some of
the other thing. Now, is an accurate. So in other words, why not why do you even play the regular
season? Why not just start with a playoff? What's the point of having an 82 game season if
almost everybody now makes the playoff? I mean, that's just pathetic. So like I said,
Hubman Drared, like the Chinese say, probably maybe in Japan. That's a very popular hockey expression.
Yes. Absolutely is. Especially when Harold Ballad on the Leafs, a lot of people were saying that.
Even the Goyang were saying that. All right, Neil. Well, don't do any more that getting too much
rest. I heard you saying that you got too much sleep two nights ago. Yeah, I was slugging
today. Yeah, I won't do that again. No. Get about four hours sleep and then come in and like,
like just in coherent and then you'll be like sharp as a tack and then you'll have to go home and
take a nap, which will save you a lot of a lot of money. Yeah, I won't be plunging. That's correct.
I think I might today though. Really? I'm going to surge. Thursday. Well, let me take a look and see
what we got today. We got Balmata Hollywood. Yeah. Oh, there's still showing replays. Oh, it's only
10 o'clock in the morning. We're showing replays from the metal lands last night. There's Michael
a chance and there's Brian Sears. Nice going Brian. You wouldn't know Brian Sears from Sears
Robock. You're right about that. I know that. I know you're better off. Yeah, Brian Sears is great.
He's the best driver in the world right now and he drove at Pompooh Park. He that's where he got
to start him in the dead J series. Pompooh Park story. We want to keep all these things short.
Hockey, harness racing, all the things that nobody cares about. Sorry, we apologize.
Have it done my time anyway. So it's not a problem. Yeah, I don't mean to, you know, be intrusive.
No, that's okay, but that's why I'm sure that's why you slapped over today because you know,
I've mentioned something about hockey. Yeah. You had Jack Martin on. Jack Martin. Yes, it's
froggy. You're going to be in for a real surprise, sweetheart. You seem nice enough. He's a very nice
guy. Maybe too nice. You know, he was always made to play off with Ottawa. They always choked and lost
in the first round. Leafs always tumbled him, but he's a very nice guy. You know what they say
by nice guys don't you, but Leo DeRoscher said. Yep. On that note, have a great day and win a lot
today. I have a feeling you're going to kick some ass today. It's Thursday, July 14th. It's an
omen. I'm feeling good. Great. Have a great day, Neil. I'll see you Tuesday. Oh, that's right.
Always fresh in my mind. And I know you look forward to it. Yes. To what? To the next four
days. That is correct. Yeah. What a life you have. Absolutely the best. Absolutely correct.
See you.
Session with hockey.
When I don't make you read no facts. I leave my baby on all day. Hey, hey, you're
barely, nobody's trying anything on their
everything.
Where?"
All right.
I'm a little too much.
Cute.
I'm a little too much.
Cute.
I'm a little too much.
With what they say.
I'm a little too much.
I'm a little too much.
When I was in what she came to me.
Well, yeah, everything they say.
I've been that way.
Well, I knocked you down by my hands.
Telling me what to say.
I could listen to you today.
There's books to read but not for me.
I'd rather play your living go brows.
We'd left them walls in the
10 already it's great time boys and girls and we just got started like that
Man, yeah, how about a little rewind there?
Hey listen, that's okay. It's a middle of summertime. It's a 14th of July
Let's just take our time relax. There's no pressure
Probably 175 degrees in the shade. It sure is here man. I haven't had any rain in six weeks not a drop
Not a just a drop remember. Yeah, we're getting it all dropped very important. We're getting it all here all the drops
I see anyway that was embarrassing. I'm so glad that somebody called and I just had a brain cramp there a brain fart
Joyce not having a good morning for movies today. John Crawford was not the not well
I mean she was it was about her so I guess it was like a bit in there
It wouldn't have had to do too much acting. Well, I guess that eventually that's today's pool
We had a whole bunch of other polls to climb first
I
I see that he was in the field for the...
Get her ass, man.
10, 17.
Of course a lot of guys think that she's really hot,
which just drives me crazy.
It drives me almost as crazy as the sports fraternity in Saun Florida.
Probably not just a Saun Florida thing either,
we didn't think it's kind of like nationwide.
the sports fraternity?
Yeah, the sports, the jock fraternity, where they all kind of like suck around together and
they're all like, they're all, they're all, they're just terrified of saying like anything
a negativity about anybody else.
I just don't, I can't stand it.
But nevertheless, a more good news from Iraq.
Let's hear it.
I mean, that thing we really got that button down.
The insurgency like Cheney said is definitely in its death throes.
It's caught up blood.
There are a lot of people thrown in, a lot of people dying.
A suicide car bomber sped up to an American, to American soldiers distributing candy to
children and detonated in his explosives yesterday, killing up to 27 other people.
Do you talk about this?
Nope.
US and Iraqi officials say one US soldier was killed about a dozen children among the dead.
At least 21 others including three US soldiers were wounded in the attack.
You know, it's interesting when they say they were wounded.
See, that's all you ever hear.
Right.
Because we don't see the pictures because it's very bad for business and bad for the fourth
wife that see the pictures of the soldiers with their arms blown off and her legs blown
off or both.
And they're like, you know, their eyes and not functioning anymore.
All of these things.
You know, just minor things.
You know, it's right.
Permanently this figure crippled for life.
A suicide attacker also killed 25 people Sunday in the Iraqi Army recruiting centers
between those days.
It just goes on.
People are dying like flies and a lot of blood on a lot of people's hands and they just
get away clean.
That's all.
How's Carl Rove doing, by the way?
He hasn't got his promotion yet.
Oh.
You can, you know, you just look at him.
Yeah.
You just look at him and you see an evil door right there.
Just take a look at him.
He's got, he looks nervous, you know, like any day is going to get caught with his finger
in the cookie jar or up some of these go, whatever he's doing.
Not to mention, of course, outing Valerie Plain.
And this business about, well, he didn't mention her name.
What difference does it make?
If I said that, if I said Mrs. Joe Schwartz who lives down the street, I don't know what
her name is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
If I said Ed Wilson's wife, I shouldn't have said Wilson.
Yeah.
Ed's whatever.
I mean, talk about trying to squeeze out on technicalities.
Remember the fuss they made when Clinton said, well, it's all about what it means.
But, Antis with Samantha's baby quit playing the games.
Okay.
Your gopie is hell.
Resign.
Show a little bit of football, a little bit of balls and get that out of there already.
That's funny.
I'm just telling you.
Please, I, I blackberry just went off.
What the hell is this?
It could be something really important.
It says, huh, look at that.
From my friend Ken Halper and from Major White Limos.
Leave me alone, Ken.
Here's Georgia's pool from yesterday.
Which possession could you absolutely, absolutely not live without my car 242?
I'm living fine without mine.
I got two fine, beautiful Corvette.
I'm doing just fine without him.
I use to use an example, especially that 2005 one boy.
That is the finest automobile ever made.
I don't care what anybody says.
That's just my personal opinion.
What do I know?
My car 242, my computer 151.
What did I vote for?
I voted for my TV house 145.
My TV 76.
I'm just one of those people that when, in fact, even now during the show, I got to
play.
They told me to, um, one of the detectives, um, they have it on.
See, I have a my TV is bon.
Anytime I'm inside the house, the TV is on.
I vote for it.
It's like a line is in a security blanket, you know?
Right.
I would have purchased it.
It just is, even if I'm not watching it.
Right.
It's a window.
My drug 66, my porn collection 56, you better start stocking up because pretty soon,
Alberto, homemade is Gonzalez and all these and Nazis are going to take away.
They're going to shut it all down.
They're going to come knocking on your door.
They're going to be searching like crazy.
My dog 50.
Well, that's cute.
Would you say a dog is a possession by the law?
Yeah.
I'm talking about, is this a legal poor one?
My booze 39.
My Bible 27.
God dang it.
Got to help it.
My gaff, caffeine 23, my cat, my gato 23.
So I started to say gato.
Let's start doing this show in Esponio, man.
Nobody speaks English in South Florida.
No mole right?
Can't hurt the ratings.
I mean, it can hurt.
It can only go zooming up there.
I think that's a great idea is that on alternate days, when you do the show, you ought to do
one day in Esponio.
I'll do a show in English.
We'll do like a pasta USA.
And then we'll have a duck command one day to a show in Greek.
My cell phone 19, my radio 15, rectum, my cigarettes 13, my motorcycle, I want my cigarettes,
Miss Ratchet.
Didn't know he said he didn't say nurse Ratchet.
He said, Miss Ratchet, that's right.
He's dead.
That's really a shame.
Who is great?
My motorcycle 12, my video game system 7, and my surfboard 4.
Somebody actually called that in.
So couldn't live without their surfboard.
Oh, I have two words for those of you who say that.
Grow up.
Now, here's the interview we did early this morning.
What's your take on the NHL hockey settlement?
And of course, it hasn't been ratified yet.
Oh, man, they just, these glorified overpaid jocks nippers who take showers naked with
each other and slap each other when he asks with towels.
These guys don't get it at all.
They've been pampered and overpaid for too long.
I'm not just talking hockey.
I'm talking about all these ball players, all these athletes, you know, and of course,
stations like this one glamorize it no matter how low of a slime ball they might happen
to be.
And they're sure a whole lot of them.
I don't want to mention no names, Randy, but they're just a whole lot of them.
It's been making a difference.
It's like I was telling you before the show I watched a documentary last night on CBC
about this guru in India, which I can't, something Baba, not Ali Baba, but probably
kind of Ali Baba, okay?
And he's a pedophile.
He's like a little munchkin, guys.
Seven to eight years old.
He's about five feet tall.
And they had these people on talking about how they molested their son.
And then they had all these other people talking the same stuff.
And the disciples don't care.
They don't care.
He has all these phony, uh, slight of hand magic tricks, making watches appear and all
this other stuff.
And then I come to find out that all this gold that he supposedly is is like it's paste,
it's crap.
It like starts flaking and falling apart.
It's something you buy like off an infomercial on TV other than of course the deluxe flavor
way.
So when I was talking about with the Ali Baba that he's a pedophile and they're glorifying
him and right.
Same crap.
How they glorify slime balls.
It's like a church.
Yeah, they can knock all they want, but they were a love the slime ball.
The Germans, the Austrians, they love Hitler, man.
They love them.
Just like the Americans love Bush, released half of the Americans, the country's drawn
right down the middle.
I got a new poll on that.
He's not quite as popular in his credibility.
He in fact, it says he's almost getting in Greg Reed's class as far as lack of credibility.
Now that's bad.
You know what I'm saying?
When your credibility is as low as on the Greg Reedo meter as it is now, that's bad news
for the Bushmeister.
Anyway, here's the intermediate poll.
Do they care about hockey or what in South Florida?
None.
And I'll say it to make you feel better.
Let's you off the hook.
And that is even in Toronto.
They showed interviews with a whole bunch of people who were fans, our fans, but I haven't
played in so long.
We just don't care.
You know, that's the average response.
And I would say the same, eh?
Who cares anymore?
Take your hockey sticks in your puck.
We survived a whole year without it.
And guess what?
Life goes on.
Life goes on.
Like I was talking before the show.
These silly ass people, these professional sports nerds who run around with their, you know,
it's one thing to go to a game like I have my leaf jacket that I put on my go to a hockey
game, you know, team caps, something like that.
But they walk around in everyday life with their hurricanes, jerseys on and their dolphin
caps.
Grow up already.
Wouldn't you please?
I have no idea.
I know that.
Oh, those people just, they just leave me limp.
God.
You know the crowd I'm talking about.
Do I know that?
Overgrown little babies, little babies, okay?
Life is more than a ballgame.
See, that's one of the reasons that we have problems with the internet, with our website.
Only people who want to see naked pictures on their overgrown children.
Like that.
Nothing wrong with looking at pictures of hot naked people, but find the appropriate place
to do it.
See, we made a bad move by ever starting to do that.
That was a bad mistake.
And of course, the law says you better not do it again or your ass is all going to jail.
Anyway, here's the intermediate pool about hockey, man.
Do they care?
They're whipped up into a frenzy of South Dakota.
Am I right?
No.
No.
Don't give a shmit 44.
We had 101 votes.
We slipped this in there, that intermediate kind of thing in between polls.
Don't give a shmit 44.
A fan who doesn't care anymore, 29.
That was my vote.
A big fan, but you know what?
I just don't care.
Hockey sucks 10.
See, those percentages again, they get like 39 and 43 is what?
80, 82%.
Okay, right?
I'll take your word for it.
Geltie will help us win the squeakers.
Eight.
I thought that was kind of cute.
I'm a big hockey fan and I'm pumped seven.
A big panthers fan and I'm pumped three.
So that's 10 out of 101.
They're pumped up like Arnold, they're pumped and they're ready to go.
Okay, drop the fuck.
We'll be there.
Nobody cares, Jack Martin.
I hate to break the news, dear froggy.
Nobody cares.
I shot a clip of the spokesman a couple days ago on air.
Remember the spokesman B. Ender?
So I'll have those buttons later on.
Partial building collapse in New York.
You see this on the Upper West Side Manhattan.
It moved off my head.
This debris on the bottom.
Hundreds in Broadway.
It's a building that was under construction and it like cave didn't.
There are a couple of people in June and they're like me.
But I mean, but I mean, this is the latest the history of do sure.
Because there's nothing else going on other than of course all the people dying in
Iraq and Carl Rove and all this other stuff.
See it's all a it's all a big ruse.
It's a cover up every second that they spend talking kaka.
You know, like about the Aruba, the tuba in Aruba.
It's all a cover up.
Yeah.
Catch my grip.
I think I'd have heard on my throat and look at the one on the curly side too.
Does it?
How that happened?
I just got out now.
British Prime Minister in Poodlehead.
Tony Blair.
Hello.
Tony Blair here.
And I'm delighted to say now that we have Saddam Hussein locked safely behind bars.
I can assure you there is absolutely nothing to worry about.
Oh, yeah.
Tablet sigh.
Seems a most unfortunate bomb went off.
Oh, where was I?
Oh yes.
I can say with great certitude, committing all troops to Iraq as the best of your very
wealthy leader has not only guaranteed me a chair with a Carlisle group, but has made
the world a much safer.
Yes.
For me, it's pleasure, Naya.
Like I said, everybody says.
It's not the police.
It's not the police.
They're nice people.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Oh, you noticed that they've identified four brits, three of whom I think was at least
three are a Pakistani descent.
Correct.
I just mentioned that.
All four of them are.
All of them are, well, all that they've found are so far born and raised up.
Oh, the Pakistani descent.
They're packing it?
Yes.
Well, I'll be damned.
Not anymore.
They're not.
No.
I wish they'd have packed it a little more carefully before they left the house so they wouldn't
have gone off in the, um, two.
But nevertheless, five synodes.
Let's give you the pool for today.
I'm a little bit, um, I'm, I'm peoed about that whole sports fraternity thing because the,
the Jimmy Sifilist thing is the epitome.
And this goes on all the time, you know, remember?
See, people would say, well, you're so negative no matter who they picked, you would have
not.
No, I would not.
If it would have been a professional broadcast, you know, somebody would like some
credential, somebody would be with some talent.
But a guy who's never broadcasted an NFL game in his life and now he's the voice of the
dolphins.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Even Geltie has done in some fill-in games for, uh, the Panthers.
Not that he, of course, was the best choice, but nevertheless, it's outflow.
What do you expect?
And nobody cares about hockey anyway.
I think he'll do okay as a matter of fact.
You know what?
Okay.
I didn't say great.
I think he'll do okay.
Okay, you'll be great.
Okay.
Great.
Spectacular.
He'll be like another, uh, Bill Hewitt.
Not.
Who best fits this description?
An actor or actress in a TV or movie role they didn't have to act much for.
I think that, uh, Joan Crawford and Mommy's here for a year.
Yeah.
That was good.
Typecast.
Yeah.
Anyway, we took that off of there.
And thanks Eric for getting that off of there right away.
Just like disappeared.
Did Eric do that or you did that?
Yeah.
I told him and he did it.
He did it.
Well, he's obedient that way, you know what?
106 votes so far.
Who best fits that?
Somebody who just, uh, and I voted for the one that's winning hands down.
He's a moron.
He's a moron.
He's a dullard.
All he had to do was just be himself and read the line.
Yo Adrian.
He actually wrote that movie.
You know, something because it was him.
Right.
Exactly.
It was his life story, man.
Slice the loan.
He could act as well as a paper sack plus the Italian's Italian from the word around the
Aloteroom is.
I mean, hung rock and net.
But that's important, of course.
Not acting cool.
Just like a net.
Slice the loan in Rocky 56.
Jack Nicholson, Cuckoo's Nest 26.
Spencer Tracy, any movie he was in 13.
See, I'm glad to see that I'm not feeling when it feels that way.
He was the only movie he was ever in that I saw him in that he was different was Dr. Jika
and Dave Hyde.
Tom Jika and Dave Hyde.
Oh, it's bigger than Tom Jika.
I'm all over the place.
But when you're only on twice a week, you have a lot of crap stored up.
I'll get to Jika in a second.
Tom cruisin' Agnolia 7.
And now that everybody's turned on him and rightfully so, deservedly so, Tom, you idiot.
You're fair.
Uh, they're piling on that.
He's got seven votes and I were going to go to agree.
Yeah.
That was him.
And Betty Davis and whatever happened to Baby Jane 3.
Yeah, she is an old shrew.
I had that feeling.
I maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe she was a very nice person.
I don't think so.
What a day.
I don't like her.
No, no, I like her in the movies.
I thought her acting was great.
She always played in the interview.
She always came off like with this.
It's huge ego.
Yes.
Well, it does make much difference not because she still did.
Okay.
And again, back to Tom Jika before we take any of these calls.
Because this is a building pool.
We need a whole bunch of choices on here.
We might actually get some votes.
Thousand votes today, Jack.
Not over the day.
A hundred votes today.
Are we able to get one?
Oh, seven.
No, but Tom, Jika, I was thinking about this in the shower
this morning in the shower.
I think about those are things.
Okay.
Doing my body wash.
Oh, seriously?
Now is there is there anybody that's still using soap before I
talk about jika right here?
I bet you I think Miguel said a couple weeks ago.
We were talking about the body wash thing.
He's still using soap.
And that of course is because being Cuban, which you're one of
the exceptions, but being Cuban is afraid he's going to drop it.
She's got soap on a rope.
He says I see but never let see you missing my point.
That's why he's still using it.
He thinks he's going to drop it.
And anyway, getting back to Tom Jika.
Here's a guy my close little ball headed friend who's been very
nice to me.
We're in a lot of nice stuff about me over the years, but never I see
I again, I can't let that color my judgment.
The fact of the matter is I was thinking about all the bonehead
things that are going on in this radio station for the last two or
three years and there have been so many.
I mean, they've done everything in their power.
You talk about the explosions and the chew on them.
Lastly, they've done everything in the part of just disimate
this place.
I don't know how to help.
We continue going to be honest with you.
It's a place every obstacle in your way, continue fiddling
with a format, it's hard changing everybody's time slot, making
all kinds of threats with joy.
So that legal crap and Tom Jika see that nobody nobody writes
a word about it.
See the sports nerds.
Although I know the Sarny wrote that column last week,
raving about the afternoon guy in Palm Beach and about he's the
best sports guy in the afternoon.
My ass, Sarny, what happened?
Made it.
It's turned you down.
That is just unbelievable.
That is so unconscionable, but that's Sarny for you.
You know, he's always, oh, eight 50 years, almost for any savvy
sports fan.
I have a button on your way.
Yeah, you ought to have a button on your.
Man, Sarny, you're pathetic, but they just they just won't criticize.
You know, just and he also was suckered up to a rich wall.
So again, about well, you got some criticism in the beginning,
but every game he's getting better.
Is he getting better?
You know, he's the same.
He sucks.
He's bad.
That's all.
If somebody's good, they're good.
Okay, Joe Angel.
He was good, not great, but he was good.
Rich Waltz sucks.
They've been boring.
Good boys.
He's boring.
That's all.
Josh don't need to say a word.
And he won't.
But Jika won't write about any of this in Sarny and he goes on.
And he's supposed to be the only one left who occasionally wants
every six months write something about local radio, although I'm not
lately, but because of the fact that he fills in for any K.
He's part of our fraternity again.
He fills in on this station.
So is he going to, I'm not saying he's never written anything critical
because he has, but like this stern debacle and all the other stuff
that's going on.
Is he going to write about it?
No.
No.
So basically this radio show, and of course, that's why they resent me
and hate you like poison.
They can't afford to hate me, but they hate you like poisonous result.
And I, you know, I apologize.
I'm sorry that you have to bear the brunt of it, but too bad.
Yeah.
With all the big bucks you're making,
you're the first you can do it.
More than worth it's worth.
Is deflect all of the hatred and the animosity and the history
and the psychosis of all these middle and upper level management
people.
You know that.
By the way, Claret, you can come in in the morning if you want
what I'm on, but you know, what's the point?
You got nothing to say.
At least when Duff comes in, yeah, I don't want to stick up with Duff.
You're fair, but it's just, Claret just has he brings nothing to the table.
You know what I'm saying?
Strap it hard and you were.
Yeah.
Welcome.
Holy cow.
Or is it we were would say holy Toledo.
In fact, I think that's where he last drafted on.
Anyway, it's the do I seem like I'm rambling?
I'm just pissed off and affected.
Nobody says anything.
Everybody is a suck off.
I'm not for the sucking already.
Jesus, cake, Christ.
Okay, just be objective.
You don't have to like a rip everybody or kiss everybody's ass.
Have an opinion.
And this business that Jimmy Sepalo is going to do such a great job
doing the Duff and play by play based on what?
First of all to be a play by play guy.
He's got to be dynamic in the first place dynamic.
You know, have a personality Jimmy.
I mean, you know, he's okay on TV on his fourth.
They're on 10 minute.
He's got a personality like an Eli screen.
You know, he's a very low key kind of boring guy.
Well, that to me we already got boring on a baseball games.
At least one thing for Gellie.
Nobody's got accused of being boring on a Panther games.
Okay, he'll be animated.
He'll be a high preventive.
You know what I say?
What do you say?
I think he could be okay.
Well, he likes it.
So he's got a genuine.
He likes it.
He knows it.
He understands it.
He's enthusiastic about it.
And he has and see for hockey.
You don't have to have a your regular ordinary voice.
I could go through a whole litany of things about hockey
announcers and ones who had like Bob Cole with a great voice.
And Joe Bowen.
But then there's like Bill and Foster.
He would who had the bizarre voices.
And still were great.
You know, you don't have to and Johnny most in the cell.
Except that guy mentioned the other day with a gravely voice.
And Bob Prince the same with kind of like a gravel voice.
And anyway, look at that.
That's all in London 53 from that.
Q incident and there's an update from a prison planet on the thing about that.
That's the true story.
Even though you don't believe it probably about the exercises that were taking place simultaneously.
It's almost exactly the same time.
I would never believe it.
I don't mean you.
I mean, people in the audience get there's an update on I just passed it along.
It'll be on either today or tomorrow.
The website assuming of course that you people are reading the stories.
The new stories on our website that Josh is working so feverishly to get on there.
Man, no naked picture is.
We don't want to see that website.
No naked picture is we want those naked pictures every day.
If you want to bring the naked pictures back, we will not look.
We don't want to hear.
We don't want to know nothing from it.
You bastard.
You piece of crap.
You that's it.
That's the way it is 1042 at 560.
Nobody can you weigh him?
Drop.
I'm looking for the tickets.
You know the ten.
And yet 90 points.
This is the lawyer.
Don't please fist off me.
I mean, you're going to lose the lawyer.
I'm just looking for the ticket.
I'm just looking for the ticket.
Are you going to tell me?
I'm not going to tell you.
It's not the captain and ten.
It's a ten.
By the way, something.
Tell me you're going to tell you.
Tell me you're going to tell me.
Tell me you're going to tell me.
All right, which one of your guys is a ten?
You're not going to tell me.
I'm going to tell you.
I was going to tell you.
What is your show going on here?
Why?
What are you?
What did you do with the lawyer?
I'm going to tell you.
I'm going to tell you.
You're going to get me covered.
It's a mafisto.
You're going to get me.
I get you.
You'll see when I get you.
What's the rectum?
It's the game club you've won, man.
Huh?
Huh?
I am a...
I'm a rectum.
I am a...
I'm a...
Tell me you're the sports bar.
I am...
I'm a...
I know you stupid shit.
I am a...
I'm a...
I'm a...
I'm a...
I'm a...
All right.
Tell me what you got, bastard.
You want it, boss?
Is he?
Is he the blood brother?
All right.
You're right.
You asked for it.
You asked for it.
You asked for it.
You're right.
You're right.
You're right.
You're right.
Yeah, this is quite a swing and swar in here.
You'll be here.
I'm out of here.
I'm going to rest my bowl.
What?
I think we picked these some way tunnels.
I know.
Yeah, what do you know?
I have no nested tent.
Well, good for you, fellas.
I got some great tips.
Where do you dig your bowl?
Ah, well, I get it.
R-Roy, oh no!
R-Roy, oh no!
R-Roy, oh no!
It's easy, I'm pregnant, you know.
Don't you think that's sad?
R-Roy, oh no!
No, not the face!
R-Roy, oh no!
R-Roy, oh no!
R-Roy, oh no!
I can honestly say, I know that you haven't got a clue.
No, you're not supposed to.
What do you mean by that?
It's a parody of the movie irreversible.
So if you haven't seen it, then it's an...
Oh, I see!
Which is another backwards movie like a mental.
I see.
Said the blind man.
I haven't got any idea.
Well, so it's terrible, you know, with the bit of it.
Ah, that's good.
I can't help it, by the way.
I emailed you back.
You know, you say one thing on a show,
which I guess is a good sign, and all of a sudden,
everybody in the whole universe is talking about it.
I said to Hank there at the end of this crossover,
I said, I'll see you Tuesday.
So, can you be a...
I've been wanting to be the beautiful limo driver.
Or are you coming back to town Tuesday?
Hey, absolutely not, Ken.
That was figuratively speaking what I should have said,
and I'll be very careful in my verbiage in the future.
I'll talk to you Tuesday.
Not I'll see you.
I don't think I'll probably ever see the hump or again.
Or any of you folks, but I mean, don't take it personally.
Jay, well, it just, I just won't be there.
You know, I mean, I'll be there, but not in the building.
Right, you'll be there.
Of course, we meet at the track or something like that.
Here is the definitive answer for our poll.
We're going to start building this poll.
Nice going, Mitch and Hollywood.
This is exactly what I had in mind.
Adam Sandler and Happy Gilmore.
Okay.
You don't agree?
Oh, I never saw Happy Gilmore, sir.
Well, it's irreversible.
The effects of seeing it are irreversible.
Well, that's right.
You don't go to the hockey games.
You never saw the clips that they use at the hockey games with the Bob Barker punch on the TV.
Well, there you go.
Adam Sandler and Happy Gilmore, let's get that on right away and it's going to go zooming toward the top.
Because that's the definitive answer.
I'll go on Mitch.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
0.5, 60, and leave a rising and singular wireless lines.
An actor actress in a TV or in the movies who didn't have to act for a role.
Much.
Did I say that?
Did I say that well?
I came across.
Okay, that's good.
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.
Hey, Neil, got one for your poll on the question.
Yes, sir.
Okay.
Keanu Reeves, Bill and Ted Zex, one advantage.
Yes, that's the way we're doing.
Okay, that's definitive again.
Perfect.
Okay, and my question for George is on Neil's noises is Buffleville Bill on there anywhere.
No, no.
Okay.
Are you going to put it on?
No.
Okay.
It's one of the best.
What do you want?
Nothing.
Your gloves are losing on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.
Good luck, you've hired.
Thanks, Neil.
Thanks, good choice.
Yeah, Keanu Reeves.
We don't like her.
I mean, him at all, do we?
He was rough.
The emotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Okay, I know what the next one is, and I'm not really sure about the bleep so long.
Yeah.
Hey, we got to be really sure, man, because when it's out, we got to bleep it out.
That's the American FN Way now.
I mean, the American *** in Way.
How many Q.A.M. Hello?
Hey, how about Robin Williams in pretty much anything he's in, number one?
Yeah, that's right.
Always the same.
He's always a duck pan.
What's that, Pant Adam?
He's always a duck.
Exactly, exactly.
And also I used some liquid soap when I was away, I stayed at a man's house, and there was
no way I was touching that bar soap, so I found the light, man.
It works great.
Nice one, Pant Adam.
He found the light, let's say.
I used to, I used to, I used to, I used to, I was there.
I went to some cascino, and I went a little bit of cash.
Excellent.
That's another thing.
I learned two things when I was away, so.
What are you doing?
What I'm doing for your life?
Yeah, I went away, too, and I found a place on Memphis, which sounds like a backwards town,
but I actually have lights more than Florida, and the people were much nicer, so.
Where was it?
Memphis, Tennessee, it sounds like a backwards town.
Oh, no, holy shit.
You know, it's dirty, it's dirty, but there was lights there.
I thought it was very hard.
I said, okay, listen, we have to put it right here, thanks.
Let's see.
So, see, he discovered a body.
Why, she's not like a manly man, not like some kind of little pansy, some little loose-wing
pansy.
See, one thing God that television doesn't stereotype minorities, you know, like blacks or like
things like that, or like co-holes, you know.
Lucy, Lucy.
He had speedy benzole, all of that stuff.
Really, he wasn't a stereotype, that was him.
Not at all.
Hey, listen, I keep talking about what a shrewd businessman he was.
He was.
Desiarnes.
Desi Lucey.
And don't forget they slept in separate beds.
Line 9, QIM, hello.
Jumma.
So, no matter which line it is, does it really make a difference?
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Nobody, QIM, hello.
Ben Baldi Diesel.
What is it?
What do you say?
He said Ben Baldi Diesel, but I don't know what movie he would be.
What does that mean?
I don't know.
In other words, he's being on a van, I mean, Vin Diesel again.
He's just like the superheroes that he pretends to be his end in his point.
Oh, this fantastic form, you see that, yeah?
Yeah, I saw it.
It was fine.
Don't sound too enthusiastic.
Was it better than the world?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It was nothing that made you angry at it.
It was just not, didn't have a whole lot of action, but then it didn't need to.
They were just setting things up.
Yeah.
And it was fine.
It was entertaining.
No, one character in there in his complexion looks almost like Wayne, you know what?
Talk about the thing, right?
Yeah.
Don't think you were him, hello.
Yeah, I got one for the poll.
Yes, sir.
Jeff Goldblum in any movie?
Anywhere we trust, Laura.
Let's pick one.
Well, I'll say it.
Okay, but I can't.
Thank you.
How about in the fly?
Oh, God.
Turns out he is.
I don't know what it is about him.
There's something, oh, I just, I feel unclean when I see him.
I can't hear it as I said, mate.
It's got nothing to do with that.
You, Hater.
You see it?
Yes, I saw the fly.
What else was he in?
He's been in the movie.
He's been in the big, not been good.
Not been good.
Not been good.
Jeff Goldblum in any movie is in.
He just gives me shfilkeys.
He's a stupid, he's saved the world with an Apple computer.
So far we've got 144 votes.
We'll get to our 200 a day before 2 o'clock.
Slice to low in Rocky, 77.
You're an agent.
I'm a moron.
You're a technicals and cookies.
There's 29, Spencer Tracy in movie 18.
Tom Cruise and I know you're 10.
Hey Tommy, how's the people in Tommy?
You're 4.
That's the wrong movie.
Betty Davidson, whatever, I have it a baby Jane 6.
Cano Reeves and Bill and Ted's excellent adventure too.
You know, that's going to inspire me.
The story of the Rocks on Beach in the world.
Uncle Ted did throw on some boxer shorts.
Let's cruise a bar and rage with some babes.
Excellent.
Our money is woman and who and Ted.
Uncle Ted dude, let's use our end to this last name to impress you guys.
And do the wild thing.
It's a countdown.
No way Bill.
That's why Ted.
Excellent.
They're rich, they're powerful.
They like to swim naked.
Well you're going to be smitten and Ted Kennedy and Bill and Ted's excellent adventure.
Hard to the next Chinatiria.
Excellent.
Come on soon to appear to be you.
Pretty nice for that.
Excellent.
Two for that and the one for Adam Sandler and Happy Gilmore.
And none yet for Robin Williams any movie was in.
Can you name me other than Good Morning Vietnam.
I'll be sure to point her on that.
Other than that, can you name me one movie he was in?
I wasn't going to name that one.
What?
What?
It was pretty much the same in that one too.
But at least it was a good movie.
But that was not again last night.
The one with Matt Damon, Goodwill Hunning.
Yeah, what's the last few seconds of that?
I think he was in awakening, was he?
With Robert De Niro.
Didn't see it.
It was good.
And he was good.
He played a different character.
He was relatively normal.
No antics, no comedy all the way through.
For me it's like patch Adams.
That's the thing that Robin Williams is.
He's always Robin Williams playing Robin Williams and not being funny.
He's funny, I don't know why.

Step, step, roar, all the way down the aisle.
As you can imagine, the crowd was near tears from laughing so hard.
By the time the young boy reached the pulpit.
Peter, however, was getting more and more distressed from all of the laughter
and was also near tears.
By the time he reached the pulpit,
when asked what he was doing by the priest, Peter sniffed and said I was being the ring bear.
Paul Harvey.
Good day.
Okay, now I'm waiting for the explanation on that one.
A bear.
He was the ring bear.
Get it?
Wow.
I put three different written on the irreversible one because I didn't see the movie.
I had no idea.
It was in his moments, especially when he went to the end.
It was hysterical.
But the ring bear, I just...
Yeah.
And I think there's one other Paul Harvey, but two I just put in there.
I also don't understand that.
It's the first time I ever put anything in there that I didn't understand.
I didn't get it.
But I figured, well, somebody will find it amusing.
The ring bear?
Yeah.
Oh, my.
Oh, my.
God, well, somebody will have summertime.
The girl will have week.
Bob and Carl spring's factions and says on Sunday evening, tired of the local TV news
hysteria regarding Hurricane Dennis, I was channel surfing and stumbled on Larry King, who
was bringing the hysteria to a national level.
At one point in the show, he says, let's now vote a CNN's rich Sanchez live in Pensacola.
Then, who appears on this TV, screaming other than Miami's own Ricky Tiki Sanchez, the
King, my sir, continue to call him rich throughout the entirety of his show during numerous
reports.
And I laughed my ass off.
His body cross-friends, but you see that Larry is a funny guy.
Even without those suspenders, he's a real panic.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, I got another one for the pool.
Okay.
Kevin Costner in the Untusables.
Okay.
Because he played a very coma-inducing area of Ness.
Perfectly.
And he didn't have to act because that said, he has got to be the most boring actor I've
ever seen in my life.
I don't know what the big deal is with him.
I don't know.
Maybe he's a nice guy.
Is there was, I don't know.
Maybe he shows up on an acid ego.
Doesn't argue with the director.
Maybe there's something on mission there was he ever in a movie that was good.
I didn't see dances with Wolf and Wolf.
With the up-to-the-shade was good.
I mean, it wasn't that movie, that's right.
Damn, Kate was horrible.
He was a bad man.
And I like that.
I like that.
I have a phone, the accent, that phone.
There's nothing worse.
Well, I think we did that pool once upon a time.
Like Brad Pitt, when he was the blonde, what, what, what, what, what, what, he was that?
He died his hair blonde and he had that phony Scandinavian accent, whatever the hell it was.
Got it.
Brad Pitt, come on, do a Google on it.
No, no, no, no.
The Mexican?
Nah, get out of here.
Not Mexican.
He was blonde.
He was a Scandinavian guy with a real phony accent.
Sorry.
Huh?
And also in J.F.K. Kevin Bacon, who I like a lot, he's a, he's a good actor.
But he also has a real phony subendrol.
I mean, he just lays it on real thick.
It's just bad, you know, it's just crap is what it is.
5670560, pound five, 60, oh, we got something important on our website that I know you won't look at because it's important.
Okay.
No, it is.
In fact, when I looked earlier and I don't know if Josh has been adding more stories because he has a tendency to like, you know, I'm looking.
No, it's the top story there, one of the cartoons.
Yeah, actually look at the funny pictures.
The top story is the transcript of remarks by Matt Cooper and his attorney after testifying yesterday.
Okay.
It's much too long to read.
I just read the preface to it from editor and publisher.
After more than two hours of testimony before a grand jury on the plane case, Matt Cooper, a time magazine address reported outside the courtroom.
It's my hope to get back to being a national, a normal journalist on the other side of the microphone, Cooper said.
I hope to go back to time magazine and read in the kind of what took place here today in my story.
When Cooper was pressed, he responded, but I'm not going to do it here right now.
I'm not going to scoop myself today.
He confirmed that his source on the leak was deputy chief of staff Carl Rove, one of president Bush's most trusted advisors,
and the man credited with Bush's four consecutive campaign victories.
The waiver was free, that freed Cooper, cooperate with the grand jury, was signed by Rose Attorney Robert Luskin.
Cooper's attorney Richard Salber was on hand Wednesday to pass out photo copies of the waiver to reporters.
Now, it's got a full transcript of remarks made by the whole bunch.
And it's there on our website, read it and weep.
It's right there. It's not like there's something big doubt about this.
The man needs to be not only fired, he needs to be in jail for treason.
Well, we're not really sure it's a crime because you didn't actually say her name.
Right. Give me a break. It's interesting.
No question. It's a crime. He lied about his daddy.
That's right.
WQAM, hello.
Hi, Neil. I have a couple things. First off, one for the poll.
I don't know his last name. His first name is Sean, and it's the guy who plays Jack on Will and Grace.
I can't imagine he's that's doing much of a stretch of acting.
Okay.
Do we know who that is? George?
I know the actor is. I don't know his name either.
He's got a lot of commercials. He's all over the place.
Number two, I think that you're right about the Republicans unraveling now because there's not a carpet in this world
that's big enough for them to sweep this dirt under.
There's one main difference between a rap and a Vietnam.
George, first knew how to get out of Vietnam.
Bye.
That's cute. That was good.
That was a lot of funnier than that that Vera Ringbeer.
What's that?
Brutal. That was the one we were listening to in one room.
What am I missing here?
What?
I mean, am I really that stupid?
It's like an elementary school joke.
Yeah.
But I do like the voice though.
Yeah. He's got a downpack.
Sean, hello.
Who is it, Sean?
Sean.
No, Sean.
Yes sir.
Yeah, one through four.
How about John?
Oh, okay.
Okay.
And great show George.
Thanks.
Bye.
566-70, I've done Bellucian Animal House.
We got it.
Is he still dead?
Uh-huh.
Yeah he is.
British police have made a dramatic breakthrough in a hunt for London bombers, but the discovery that the suspects were young Brits not hardened out chidda foreigners has heightened the jitters and raised questions about how Britain prosecutes the war on terror.
Police now say, and you notice now what they're calling the attacks?
What are they calling the attacks?
Well, we had the 9-11 attacks in the US, so now these are the 7-7 attacks.
Oh, jeez.
Yeah, get used to it.
Sorry.
Police now say the 7-7 attacks could be the first suicide bombings ever in Western Europe.
They believe the perpetrators were second generation Brits of Pakistani descent aged 18 to 30.
18 to 30.
About 30 men.
Possibly acting with some outside help.
Pakistani descent.
Baby's aren't you couple missiles?
Tour of place we know.
Absolutely.
And the name of Madapela.
Whose first name begins with old.
There's one thing we all understand.
Alpato won't be finished until we blow up Pakistan.
Are you sure we could chase around forever with our tanks and all our troops?
But special forces are retired, jumping through them clues.
We totally need another plane.
So let's cut out all the nonsense and we'll blow up Pakistan.
Now pay the needs and nuclear tanks.
Why don't we stop pussy food and move lower Pakistan?
I'm tired of it.
Yes, it's actually the big risk and rapid police work where you've creed to the idea that Britain has more to fear from an enemy within than from shadowy al-Qaeda cells abroad.
How do you like that?
Yeah, Britain's got lots of worry about from that.
We'll broaden the Queen.
Oh, that broad.
That broad.
Wait till you hear this.
This is hysterical from the aguardian.
A Muslim man, it's not hysterical but in a pathetic way.
A Muslim man has been beaten to the outside corner shop by a gang of youths who shouted anti-Islamic abuse ed in the guardians learned.
Kamal, rise up, but.
Retto, 48 from Pakistan was visiting Britain to see friends and family on Sunday afternoon he went to a shop in Nottingham.
The buy cigarettes and was first called Taliban by the Eastern men set upon.
Nottingham police described the incident and I hear the part that's hysterical.
Nottingham, sure police described the incident as racially aggravated, not as Islamophobic.
Angry Muslim groupions, surprising some senior officers.
They say it was not connected to a backlash against Muslims following the London bombings which has seen mosques squire bombed and Muslims attacked in the street.
Now it was just a racially aggravated, not as Islamophobic.
Okay, whatever that means.
What does that mean?
I don't know what that means.
Oh, I think he was in the ringbeer.
Yeah, he beat me to it.
Yeah.
If you wouldn't have told me, I could have played that and listened to it a thousand times.
I couldn't have believed it.
I doubled over it.
I was like, oh, that was bad.
Pathetic, yeah.
And those are usually pretty good.
Usually?
To pull Harvey with bits?
Usually, but nothing's perfect.
Okay, here's the deal.
Who best fits this actor actress and TV or movie role that they don't have to act much for?
Slice the loan.
Is this beating the pants off everybody there?
Just kick in their ass.
86.
Jack Nicholson and Kuhu's Nest 33.
Spencer Tracy, any movie was in 22.
Canna Reeves and Bill and Ted's excellent thing, 18.
Tom Cruise and Magnolia, 13.
Betty Davis and Baby Jane, 11.
Adam Sandler, happy Gilmore, 10.
Tom Delarries in Fanzo, 6.
Bert Reynolds in any movie, 6.
Robin Williams in any movie, 6.
John Volucci, I love the way he's spelled, Volucci.
I didn't know he was a titan.
John Volucci.
Sure he was.
Get out of here.
He was?
Well, you know, second generation.
Animal House 2 of Sean Hayes will embrace one.
Kevin Cross with the Intensibles don't have any.
And Jeff Goldblum also spelled,
and that is how he's going to fly none.
Sean Volucci.
Well, I'm sure he's got it spelled wrong, but nevertheless.
I understand.
He was a titan though.
I'm the, uh, what was his real name?
Was that his real name?
I think so.
Well, Volucci's not been titan named.
Why not?
Where do you come up with the idea that he was a titan?
He's got a vowel on the end of it, doesn't it?
Maybe if he would have just had one last vowel movement.
When it comes to entertainment, why he's got the speed?
When the business of the church was over,
the church was over, the church was over, the church was over,
the church was over, the church was over, the church was over,
the church was over, the church was over, the church was over,
Volucci!
Wait!
And, and hold it!
Hey, how are you?
Welcome to Jack in the Box!
I'm Jack.
Can I be happy to fill your order if you know what I mean?
It's like a Jackburger in a large frieze!
Sorry...
but now we're cleaning the Greece's fire.
We don't have any French fries today.
Okay, uh, they're just giving me a small order of fries, please.
Love chief, maybe you didn't hear me.
I said we don't have any f***ing fries today, so how about something else?
Okay, then, uh, just give me an order of fries.
Listen up, pal.
We'll put the straw and straw berry.
Let you do that, right?
Let your dead.
Who put the apenate for God?
Let your dead, right?
Let your dead.
Now listen carefully.
Who put the freak in French fries?
There ain't no freak in French fries.
That's what I've been trying to tell you, but breath there ain't no freak in French fries.
Don't get out of my sight before I shove your teeth so far down your f***ing throat.
You'll have to sit on the jack burger to eat it.
Oh, have a nice day.
Lema 32, and of course he was pretty much the same character in the other shining,
too.
Here's Johnny.
Crazy.
Uh-huh.
You don't have to act like that for that.
You don't think.
But nevertheless, not that we don't like him, he's great.
He was great and a few good men.
Right.
Five easy pieces.
There you go.
Long time defensive turning for Lionel Tate would draw us from case.
Absolutely correct, sir.
Lionel Tate will be relying on a new lawyer as he fights charges that he robbed that pizza
delivery man at gunpoint.
These are the important things, baby.
Hold the anchovies.
Rowarts and then go wash your hands with body wash.
Rowarts circuit judge Joel Azarist today, granted request by defensive turning Jim Lewis
to leave the case.
Lewis has long represented Tate for free, but he tells news partner in NBC 6 that his
time has been taken up right now with a personal divorce.
Uh-oh.
The judge will be appointing a public defender for Tate who gathered the guard of national
attention as a 12 year old for killing a six year old playmate in 99.
Now 18 and on probation, he risked the possibility of being sent to prison for life.
He found guilty in the robbery of that pizza delivery man just because he left off the pepperoni.
Now, where was it?
Was it Domino's?
Oh, no, I'm no comment.
We love Domino's.
Don't have their great.
They are great.
God is that good craft.
And this is just you just wait for the day that this story was coming.
A very sad story, but you know, always just a matter of time.
And I'm sure this is not the first time.
Miramar, the fastest growing community.
Now was it number two?
And that list, I think it was number two in the country.
Yeah, Miramar's number two.
Wow.
Yeah, sure is.
It's the juice.
A car hit and killed in Harold newspaper vendor early 30th day morning on Miramar
Parkway police said this morning.
Oh, well, this is the first time.
But I'm just saying.
The victim of man in his 30s.
But third man was not identified by police because they haven't identified.
Not notified his family yet.
Let's see.
This came at 1046.
It was about 45 minutes ago.
The man was crossing the Westbound lanes of Miramar Parkway about 200, about 200 east
of the intersection.
I think there's a word left out.
Oh, the sun settled.
The way it is.
Let's say the yards fee and east of the intersection with Red Road.
He was walking south crossing traffic via the media where he sells newspaper to get the
media.
I don't understand this.
Oh, get to the median.
This story by Andrew Ryan.
Hey, Andy, how about a little spell check, a little word check.
How about a proofreader?
You idiot.
You quizzling.
You're fair.
What is this to get to the median where he sells newspapers when a 2005 Ford Mustang struck
him killing the man instantly.
The incident remains under investigation.
Police haven't released the name of the person driving the Mustang.
And of course, if you're driving a Mustang, you really want your name released.
It's a hazard as jobs said, Miramar Police spokesman Bill Robertson of New newspaper
evending.
Anytime you're working here moving traffic, there's always the possibility of an
dangerous situation.
And it's one of the things that frost my ass.
I don't want people to bug in me in the middle of the road.
You know?
Right?
I know.
I mean, I'm not comparing these people to like the homeless voice crowd, but it's still
a hazard.
Sure.
For everyone.
If I want to get the sun settled, you'll be pleased to know I canceled the Harold
finally.
Good for you.
I think that's an idea.
A lot of people ought to be thinking about cancel the Harold just say to the
Harold.
It's not a real newspaper.
It's a piece of crap.
And since I'm never there and since nobody I know wants to read it or even unwrap it,
why should I be paying for it?
Right.
Even when I am there, I can read it online just fine.
That's right.
Don't get your fingers dirty.
That's right.
Oh, I got a story for you, man.
This one.
Oh.
I'm here.
It's an edited version of the, well, I'm just blown away.
It's got a picture here too of an editorial that appeared in the LA Times.
Real Texas boys don't sing soprano.
If you're wondering what's happening in America where America has gone off the rails, so to
speak, listen to this.
All right.
Here it is.
The new definition of gender coming to you also straight from Texas.
Real boys don't sing soprano.
Boys can out audition for soprano or alto rolls and that states in Texas.
All state choir girls can out audition for tenor or bass no matter where their talents
lie.
That is angry.
As a result, 17-year-old Michael Rawls who already is one of words for his countertenor,
the male parallel to soprano, can't try out in the part where he excels.
The rule was made by the Texas Music Educators Association.
You would think music teachers would know that countertenor, such as Michael, are a widely
respected part of classical music and tradition.
But then Texas educators can be a touchy lot on gender issues and it's even as to keep
middle schoolers from thinking that gay marriage might be okay.
The state boards of education required textbooks to define marriage as the lifelong union between
a husband and wife.
Apparently, the close to 50% of Texas marriages in End of Orstone count.
It's true that a shameful aspect haunts the history of high pitched male singers, not
on the part of the singers though.
In 17th and 18th century Italy, when women were not permitted on stage, the soprano voice
would be provided by a castrato.
Gay.
A castrato, a male castrated boyhood so his voice would not deepen.
A castrato.
Before that, before you ever hear that?
Of course, they have a really good movie about them.
The movie would do it on purpose.
The movie, Ferenelli, was based on life on the most famous beg your pardon?
That's the movie.
Oh.
Ferenelli, his real name was Carlo Broski, died in 1782, time for Texas Music teachers to
get over it.
The organization says the rules prevent youngsters from damaging their voices by singing out of
their appropriate ranges.
They are right.
The kids should sing in their natural voices for some girls that's tenor and for some
boys also.
For a few boys like Michael, it includes the high notes.
He's been singing soprano parts is the only boy in his high school's accapel acquire.
Boys will indeed be boys soprano or bass.
We hope Michael goes on to success as a countertenor and honors his open-minded high school by
helping other young singers.
His family has been contacted by lawyers eager to file a discrimination suit.
Here's the stranger part of the tale.
His mother has declined saying she doesn't think lawsuits are the right way to handle this
agreement, to which we can only say Bravo.
By the way.
Yes.
By something?
That's a good movie and it goes into how the church would castrate these young boys
against their will and how they will.
Fair enough.
Yes.
And how the boys would sing off key and poorly on purpose so that it wouldn't happen
to them.
I saw one of those who called for rally.
It was about Scott from well.
And that's the reason he used to make their sound.
Like that.
That is it.
5607.
That's the sound.
5607.
5605.
560.
Let's take a look at that award-winning lineup today.
As a matter of fact, let's give it the lineup for 792 since we're so generous to them.
I think we got some people on the end.
No, seriously.
I think we got some people on the inside who were like around their payroll.
I think we got some moles.
I do, but I had them removed.
Jesus Christ almighty.
I mean, it wasn't bad enough.
That son sent a poll that we like wimped out on.
Oh, it did just ignore it.
And now we're just everybody.
All of our sports, they're just raving about, oh, it's going to be such a hoot and it's
going to be so great.
Jimmy Cefalo and Joe Rose doing the dolphin games.
See, these people who are saying those things are people who either are personal friends
or those people or B don't appreciate really fine play by play broadcast or both.
I'm sorry, but the idea like I said before just because I got to took a lot of sweaty
showers with people in Josh's drafts.
Now, that don't make him a play by play guy.
Jimmy, hey, Jimmy.
You're Ferrari.
WDQYM, hello.
Hi, Uncle Neil.
How are you?
A lady.
Oh, my.
I can't believe it.
Last time we had a lady car on the show was a week ago, sookas.
It was probably me.
Probably.
How are you?
Great.
Two things.
First of all, someone made a very funny comment about Bush possibly firing Carl Rose with
like Charlie McCarthy firing Edgar Bergen.
Right.
It kind of thought that hit them more perfectly.
Paul Winchell just died last week.
Did you know that?
No.
Yeah, Paul Winchell did.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I did hear that.
Yes, I did.
Oh, yeah.
Just a reminder.
Yeah, he was ticker with too, I think.
Right.
That's correct.
Yeah, well, having, you know, five year old.
It's like, unfortunately, no all these character voices name.
Another thing is that over the weekend, I happened upon a television accident and found
Rick Sanchez doing a CNN report live.
Hyperventilating report, right?
Hyperventilating.
Well, the funny thing with A, I have no idea why they did this video phone.
It was very murky and you couldn't see them.
I mean, with all the technology, they have people everywhere with regular cameras.
Why they did this by video phones?
But they're hoping that nobody would recognize them.
He's very recognizable.
Like it's a new one.
Thank you.
If you're a...
And he was standing in this parking lot and it was very near the ocean and there's water
in the parking lot and he said, ladies and gentlemen, you know, in his very, you know,
breathless voice.
I was thinking of what...
I'm standing in this parking lot and I'm ankle deep in this water and let me assure you,
folks, it is indeed the Gulf of Mexico and he then, down puts his hand into the water,
brings it up to his mouth, licks his hand and suggests that water's saltwater.
Oh, is he profound or what?
Oh, my God.
Then that did it for me.
Now I was sure that there was a hurricane out there.
Yeah, then I must prove it.
I just want to let you know how funny that little sight was.
Thanks for the bad news.
I love you.
See you.
Thank you.
Ricky Tiki Sanchez, man, he was a whole ass in Miami and he's a whole ass on sea and no
matter where they sent him around.
They're probably hoping he was getting blown away by the hurricane.
He was probably hoping he was getting 18 till noon at QAM.
Good morning, Americans.
It's Paul Harvey.
William Maxwell left for work one Friday afternoon, but it was payday.
So instead of going home, he stayed out the entire weekend, partying with his friends
and spending his entire paycheck.
When William finally appeared at home on Sunday night, he was confronted by his angry wife
and was barraged for nearly two hours with a tirade befitting his actions.
Finally, his wife stopped the magging and said, how would you like it if you didn't see
me for two or three days?
He replied that would be fine.
Monday went by and William didn't see his wife.
Tuesday and Wednesday came and went with the same results.
But on Thursday, the swelling went down just enough where he could see her a little bit.
Paul Harvey.
Good day.
Okay.
Got it.
I got it.
I don't.
Got him with a mouthful because you're getting lunch.
Big sandwich from Howie's.
H.C.
Sub today.
Oh, and Lannie City Sub today where Scott not being there makes the difference.
Chicken figures.
Now anyway, what was that?
What was that all about?
The swelling went down.
He saw a little bit.
What is that?
All right.
All right.
Okay.
Here's Oskis Fats who says, dear Neil and George, what a pleasure to hear you both.
I don't look at that.
It says, Belucci was, I totally wasn't a Titan.
He didn't look at Titan.
His name wasn't a Titan.
You don't know your Titan, Mr. Belucci.
Are we going to change that on?
It's so embarrassing to me.
We're changing.
No, we did not change it.
It still says Belucci.
I asked him to.
I think he left the chat room.
Like Gucci, Gucci, Susan Lucci.
Now that's a Titan.
Even though she makes me gay.
What's that?
It looks to happen to Eric.
It has appeared.
Yeah.
That would be something.
Belucci was from the same country as you old Brenner, Albania.
And then Oskis says, no, I'm not from Albania.
But due to my very mixed roots, Armenian, Greek, Latino, Jew, born in Turkey, married
to a Southern woman.
Always curious as to who is from where?
He says, he says, George, which you'd actually call you George with a G, is you speak
better English with as many of its dialects than most Americans.
Love you guys.
It says Oskis.
Last Oskis, I knew was Oskis from summer of 1942.
Remember Hermione Oskis?
No, I remember Oskis Meyer.
I remember Hermione Oskis?
Who?
You didn't see the summer of 1942.
No.
Oh, well, look at how my time started.
You're reversible.
It's like gay, is it?
No.
Oh, okay.
Frank says, I just had a very, quite the opposite.
I just had a scary thought.
Suppose we do get the impeachment of W. And he goes on about, would the Cheney, yes,
Dick Cheney would be, in the audience, and who would be in charge after that?
I'm not sure who would be the president of the impeeds of president Amber.
Would it be Alberto Gonzalez?
No, it would not be.
It would be the speaker of the house.
I'm pretty sure Dennis Hashtard, that big fat tub of crap.
First of all, did I kind of impeach both Bush and Cheney?
That's not going to happen.
Let's just start with Bush.
I mean, Cheney being in there.
He could be busy working on them halibut in contracts, right?
That's right.
He's got to put the work to do.
Keep him in the hell out of the way, out of our face.
Not getting much of a response on his poll today, and it leaves me very depressed.
Do I want to, like, end the week this way?
Huh?
Two that we had a pretty good, the memory did over 600 votes on the poll on two to do.
It's almost 700, right?
253 right now.
I thought it was a good poll.
Maybe we just don't have enough good movies on there, and I'm trying to show up and take
some calls.
Which actor, actress, and TV are movies who didn't have to act much in what role?
Slice to low and rocky?
He's got 91.
Jack Nichols and Cook who's in S38, Spencer Tracy any movie he was in 22.
Can Reeves, Bill and Ted Zexlin, eventually 21.
John Belushi was Albanian.
I would just look at that.
He must have just to heard you, Eric.
He wasn't in the chair when he was busy changing that to spelling.
It's a really embarrassing.
John Belushi, animal house 15, no matter what the, his ethnic background, he still did.
Adam Sandler, happy girl, more 14.
Tom Cruise, Magnolia 14.
Betty Davis, baby Jane, whatever happened, baby, it's 11.
Bert Reynolds, whatever movie he was in was 9.
Don Delewee's in Fancyweight, Robin Williams, any movie he was in 7.
Sean Hayes from Willem Grace 4.
Never seen Willem Grace, am I missing anything?
No.
It can be funny.
It's just usually isn't, but it is very.
Yeah.
Kevin Costner, the Untensibles Jeff Global in the Fly and None.
You know what show I've never watched, I never will watch, but I see the promos they
have all their all the time.
Now maybe you can, I know there's a lot of crap that becomes popular.
Joey, what's his name?
Joey, whatever his name is.
Joey.
Joey, never seen a second of it.
Is he funny?
No.
Is he interesting?
No.
Does he look good?
No.
Does he got any talent?
No.
I mean, oh, that's a great show.
Give me a break.
That is just a worst piece of swill.
I'd rather watch her grow and showing up Goddy than then.
I'd rather be dead than that.
Don't say something you can't take back.
Yeah.
Hockey Deleun, 301 day lockout.
Let's spend a lot of time on this.
No.
We took a poll, the intermediate poll, if you're too late then man, I'm going to tell you
you're interested in hockey on a scale of minus infinity.
It's just exactly what we always knew it was.
Almost nothing.
Almost nil.
Non-existent.
But we'll take 10 seconds.
The longest labor battle in the history of professional sports in North America is finally
over.
The NHL and the Players Association said yesterday the tentative deal have been reached
after the two sides for a month and more than 24 straight hours in New York.
The combination of 10 straight days at talks.
The process is, the process is not quite over.
The players reckon file and the owners have to ratify the agreement that's expected
sometime next week.
We're holding our breath.
Not.
Both sides expected to approve the deal, paving the way for the NHL to reopen for business.
The details of the agreement will not be released pending ratification.
The game will look, referring looking drastically different both on and off the ice.
A vastly different and complicated collective bargaining agreement highlighted by a hard salary
cap is given on as their long deserved cost.
Certainly.
Yeah.
The players really got led down to Garden Path this time.
Bob, Bob, Good Now A.
No salary cap.
Well, surprise.
Teams will come back looking vastly different as well.
Mass player movement is expected with a high number of free agents on the market as well
as several high pay pairs expecting a vote out so teams can put them on the cap.
On the ice major rule of change is being examined which will hopefully open up the game
create more excitement, including the reduction in the size of gold equipment allowing the
two line pass and the penalty shootouts to decide the games during the break of the season
which I think is a very, very bad idea, but nevertheless.
Oh, wait a year this story.
Here's one.
Oh, and oh, this thing on the stat and drugs.
Haven't I been telling you, Dr. Kilmerog and McCulley Cawkin, whatever his name is?
About those stat and drugs and I will not take them under an eye.
I'd rather croak from oil clogged arteries than take those stat and drugs.
They'll kill you first.
We'll get to it in a minute.
Huh?
Do they give you a buzz?
No.
Oh, and guess who didn't who lied?
Well, at least Stonewall, the public who's dying now, I don't want to get to tell you
Bill Rehnquist.
Oh, yeah.
Did you know that he had a bad drug problem, a prescription drug problem for back pain?
Hey, old people don't have drug problems.
I heard it.
Back pain, right?
He and Rush are hanging out together in those right wing halls in the washroom.
William Rehnquist and Rush had a real serious head to go and get treatment for that, not
for his back pain for his addiction.
I just mentioned that.
Of course, now he's like, and they keep showing him shuffling along and he's like one
breath away from death.
Yeah, and every once in a while he blurt's out.
I'm dying out of here.
But oh, well, he stepped down and he fell down, not stepped down.
So that means there's too big openings there on the Supreme Court, which I've, everybody
beg you, please think about this during the November election last year.
Think about this.
You want these right wing lunatics, these Bible thumping, no more dancing crowd, the flat earth
society.
You want them putting more people for life on the Supreme Court.
And you went, what does that have to do with the runaway bride?
Ever.
Guantanamo Bay interrogators degraded and abused the key prisoner, but didn't torture
him when they told him he was gay.
Gay.
Forced into dance with another man and made him wear a bra and perform dog tricks military
investigators said to yesterday, all kind of tricks.
We'll get to it.
OK.
The general head, Southern command responsible for the jail for foreign terrorism suspects
at the US Naval Base at Guantanamo, which I understand is a tropical paradise.
Also, say reject this investigators recommendations to punish a former commander of the prison.
A military report presented before the Senate Armed Services Committee stated a Saudi
man described as the 20th hijacker, slated and have participated in the 9-11 attacks
on America was forced by interrogators in late 2002 to wear a bra and had women's
thong underwear placed on his head.
US interrogators also told him he was a homosexual, forced him to dance with a male interrogator,
told him his mother and sister were horrors, forced him to wear a leash and perform dog
tricks, menaced him with a dog and regularly subjected him to interrogations up to 20 hours
a day for about two months.
Air Force Lieutenant General Randall Schmidt, who headed the probed WFBI accounts of abusive
Gitmo, presumed by Defense Department personnel, concluded that the man was subjected to abusive
and degrading treatment due to the cumulative effect of creative persistent and lengthy
interrogations that he techniques were authorized by the Pentagon.
As the bottom line though, we found no torture.
The tension and interrogation operations were safe, secure and humane Schmidt said.
The Pentagon identified the man as Muhammad al-Khattani and said he ultimately provided
extremely valuable intelligence.
Schmidt said he admitted to being the 20th hijacker and he expected to fly on United Airlines
flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania.
Arizona Republican Senator John McCain, himself abused by the North Vietnamese as a Vietnam
POW, said he may treatment might be in the eye of the beholder.
Senator James Inhoff and Oklahoma Republican said, theirism suspects are not to be coddled.
What damage are we doing to our war effort by parading these relatively minor infections
before the press and the world again and again, while our soldiers risked their lives
daily and given no mercy by the enemy in Hoff said.
Army General Band, that would be almost like if we were killing innocent people in Iraq,
you know, right, aiming like the enemy.
Who would do such a thing?
Army General Bant's Kredock, head of Southern Command, rejected the recommendation by Schmidt
and fellow investigator, Army Brigadier General John Furlow, their Army Major General Jeffrey
Miller, jail commander with the time he had managed for failing to monitor and limit that
prison use interrogation.
Kredock said the interrogation didn't result in any violation of U.S. law or policy and
thus there's nothing for which to hold them accountable, but as the Army Inspector General's
office to look into it.
Oh, we're looking into it.
Miller who helped him to introduce Guam Tahnemostok, Quecting Methods in Iraq.
Abu Gharrab, ahead of the 2003 abuse scandal in the prisoner bagged head, would have been
the highest ranking officer punishment connection with the detainee abuse.
See, we don't want to punish the highrups, it's all the quizzlings, you know, the, you
know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the report
urged punishment of an Navy lieutenant commander who wore a mask and was dubbed Mr. X for breaking
military law by making death threats to another high-value detainee and telling him he would
die on Christian, sovereign, American soil.
The report followed the female interrogator who's smeared fake menstrual blood on a prisoner
who had spitting her face, but said it was part of an authorized and authorized interrogation
technique.
It also followed interrogators over two unauthorized techniques, wrapping duct tape around the
mouth and head of a chanting detainee and chaining detainees to the floor.
McCain said, I hold no brief for the prisoners.
I do hold a brief for the reputation of the USA as to adhere to certain standards of
treatment of people no matter how evil or terrible they might be.
The investigation announced in January, followed the release by the ACLU of FBI documents
obtained under the Freedom Information Act.
The documents described prisoners shackled hand-in-foot in a fetal position on the floor
for 18 to 24 hours and left to urinate and defecate on themselves.
Others said military interrogators had used torture techniques.
Not the USA.
We don't do stuff like that.
Okay, we're the good guys.
We're not evil barbarians.
I like to relax by having Mary Magdalene massage my balls while listening to the Neal
Rogers welcome one hour of pooping and ha.
And now another tale from the cell phone of Dick Cheney.
Today, Dick Diles' celebrity biographer, Kitty Kelly.
Hello.
Yes, hello.
Can you eat Kelly please?
Thinking.
I ask you this is Dick Cheney.
I spread the United States of America.
How are you?
Fine.
That's good.
That's nice.
Is there something I can help you with?
Oh yes, yes.
It just met a book that's coming out next week if you wrote a.
Frankly, we, we question its credibility and I was wondering if maybe you could wait a
couple of months before actually putting it out.
I'm sorry, my son is breaking it.
Did you just ask him not to close the block until after the election?
Yes.
After George Bush gets reelected, print all he wants.
We won't care then.
Why would I want to do that?
Hello?
What?
Why are you?
Oh my.
It's your book for the least.
The terrorist win.
Huh?
You're messing with the president of the United States of America.
Okay, I'll be hanging up now.
We know where you're living.
You dumb bitch.
Okay.
That's right.
We'll get you a little bit of Toto too.
Goodbye.
What's wrong with you?
Stop.
Hello?
Hello?
This has been another tale from the cell phone of Dick Cheney.
Doctor, doctor, doctor.
It's a 1202.
We have talked to that dial tone.
No, it's kind of like a hello.
I don't think you want me to like doing that.
Kind of point.
I'll kill some good time if we do that.
The twice.
Staten drugs must carry health awarding.
Okay.
Now, I don't want anybody to stop taking a drug because I don't want to be responsible for your
popping over there.
I'm not no doctor.
But nevertheless, nevertheless, Staten's.
This is one of the biggest scams in the history of Annacore.
It just keeps getting worse and worse in between six and eight p.m.
No matter what you're watching, almost every single spot is either for a prescription drug.
Ask your doctor about Cialis.
Ask your doctor about Lentz.
Ask your doctor about whatever.
Staten's the popular cholesterol lowering drugs used by more than three million Canadian zero-day.
This is one that's in the Toronto Star.
So it's a lot more, who knows how many million in the US.
Can lead to serious muscle damage in some patients' health Canada is now warning.
The makers of all the drugs which include lipitor, zochore,
pre-evalent, and crestore must include warning and description of the risk and patient safety information
sheets the departments said yesterday.
And like I told you when I was down there and I had my doctor because of my cholesterol is high-wrote,
that prescription out for pre-evalent, am I taking it?
Am I going to take it?
No, I'd rather croak.
The drugs can cause muscle pain and lead to a serious, potentially fatal muscle-weighting disease called
Ravdomyelitis in patients with certain pre-existing medical conditions.
Toronto Star series last December called a drug nation detailed controversy around Staten's
the world's fastest growing class of drugs.
Certainly, humongous money maker baby, health Canada said then Staten related Ravdomyelitis
was a very rare disease occurring in fewer than one in 10,000 patients.
The US FDA study last year found vehicle-triverted potential muscle disease 10 times more often than lipitor,
or zoochore and pre-evalent, although it's maker bear ink disputes the findings.
They're a gas that bear crowd, you know?
Well, downplaying the risk last December, health Canada now says because so many people are using the drugs
who wants to make sure that air be ones where the potential hazards.
The warning is a precautionary measure said health Canada spokesperson, Ureena Vilk,
who noted the change to drugs packaging has been replaced and has been in place since May 3rd.
There's a high number of Canadians for Staten's who want them to be aware of the risks
associated with that Vilk said,
I've never had any doctor ever in my life prescribed me a drug and say,
oh, by the way, there's a risk with this and you're you taking this or you think never, ever, ever, never.
Whether it was Bioxx, which one of my former doctors pedaled to me and gave me all kinds of samples,
whether it was zoochore.
I got enough zoochore sitting around somewhere already, you know, tossed it out.
Get a buzz from it?
People shouldn't be alarmed by the warnings that Dr. Aaron Bear, I'd never, I took, I think, three zoochore
and I started getting the muscle pain like Wika, and I tossed it all out.
That's good.
Antonio, Staten drugs.
I wish I had that book with me here that Kilmer McCulloch and Book.
People shouldn't be alarmed by the warnings that Dr. Aaron and Bear,
they cardiologists at Mount Sinai hospital, they shouldn't be made to be afraid of those drugs
because they're overly, clearly beneficial.
Overly.
The risk of developing redomyelitis is a small compared to the number of patients taking the drug yet,
adding that many who developed the disease often have pre-existing conditions
or taking other medications with the statins.
The wide ranging warnings tell patients that consult their doctor or pharmacist
if they're pregnant or breastfeeding have thyroid problems during three or more alcoholic drinks a day
or taking other cholesterol-loering medications such as fibrates or niacin.
Other risk factors include taking medications or natural health products
because drug interactions are possible having any past problems with muscle pain after taking a stent,
having kidney or liver problems or diabetes, having kidney or liver problems or diabetes,
undergoing surgery or other tissue injury or doing extensive physical exercise.
How do you like that?
Statin drugs, I'm telling you.
One of the ones that are listed here again, just to be sure,
I'd be checking these out when in doubt,
Lipitor, Zocore, Pravicle, Mephachore, Crescendo.
I don't give a crap what Dan Reeves says, okay?
I'm sure Josh is seeing those spots.
Haven't you seen them?
He doesn't know what you're talking about.
He says he saw the ones with George Reeves.
Dan Reeves.
Who?
Huh?
Exactly.
What you know about sports, which is good.
That's what we like, Josh.
You know, it's nothing about sports.
That's why he's on a Marlon broadcast.
That's right.
Speaking of sports, it's a shame dolphin.
And I heard that promo with Hank.
This was great.
Shame dolphin set in Randy McMichael didn't follow his own advice.
Two weeks before, it's a rest for a simple battery and criminal stress stress on Saturday and
hometown Georgia, which we talked about on Tuesday.
For when alleged altercation with his wife, Koana,
McMichael was part of a panel discussion at the annual NFL rookies imposing in Palm Beach Gardens,
June 26th and 9th, in which he was advising roomful rookies,
how to avoid such situations.
How do you like that?
Well, if he can't come and speak now, what might we bring OJ back?
According to his source, McMichael was in the NFL's substance abuse and alcohol program,
relating to alcohol before his recent arrest.
The status in the program is unknown.
Any player with his positive a third time is subject to a four game suspension.
McMichael was recounting a similar episode that occurred in June 2004 when he was arrested and
charged with aggravated battery and his then pregnant wife, a second to reaffirty that was later dropped.
And the headline on the story in the Sun Central, dolphins, McMichael, Colin, do as I say, dot, dot, dot,
as in what's dot.
It was I say, not as I do.
It's the gangster fish, baby.
All right, the gangster fish.
Maybe they should change the colors.
Maybe the colors might be more like the Steelers, you know.
Only with like prison stripes.
I can just see that black and yellow, black and gold with prison bar stripes.
And that'd be good.
All right.
Here's a long fact from Mike and Jupiter, my God.
This is, oh, this is amazing how long this is.
I don't know if it's good or not, but the length of it just impresses me, Mike.
And the facts too.
I liked it.
Loyal listener and former altar boy who eventually read and experienced enough to realize what a bunch of
fairy tale religions are.
Hey, Mike, already I like the facts.
Absolutely correct.
Garbage nonsense brainwashing money grabbing, hate mongering.
That's religion for you.
It's just a whole pile of crap and all your religions out there that are getting more and more
militant and more and more trying to show it down our throws.
Shubba County's other strokes.
I'll I'm sure that's going on already.
Already are.
I'd like to recommend a new movie says Mike and recent book that hopefully more of the brainwash
matches will discover.
Oh, yeah, they won't even look at our website.
I'm sure that they're going to go out there and watch movie, but world's prior best.
My apologies if you were George have already mentioned or discussed these.
No, the movie is called The God Who Wasn't There by Brian Fleming.
Stealing directly from their website, the Godmovie.com, this describes the movie, most of
which you enjoy, if you're really discussed.
Your guide to the bizarre world of Christendom is former fundamentalist Brian Fleming, who
unflinchingly explores the absurdity of belief and believers.
Along the way you'll discover the early founders of Christianity seem wholly unaware of the idea
of a human Jesus.
The Jesus passed down to Western Gospels, where as a strengthening resemblance to other
ancient heroes in the figureheads of pagan savior cults.
Contemporary Christians are at the same story just repeated over and over again through the generations
with the Virgin birth, all the same trappings.
Contemporary Christians are largely ignorant of the origins of their religion.
Christianity is obsessed with blood and violence now as it was in the first century.
Fundamentalism is as strong today as it's ever been within alarming 44% of Americans believing
that Jesus will return to earth for the next 50 years.
44% of Americans believe Jesus is coming back on a motorcycle on a Harley.
The book is called The End of Faith by Sam Harris, the website is samherris.org, etc.
and so on. One of the great quotes from the book is that is a common theme in your
ranks about religion is this.
The kind of intolerance of faith that I'm advocating in my book is not the intolerance that
gave us the gulag. It is conventional intolerance.
When people make outlandish things without evidence, we stop listening to them except I'm at
the end of the world.
I'm not arguing that we can no longer afford to give faith in this way.
Bad beliefs should be criticized wherever they appear in our discourse, in physics, in medicine,
on matters of ethics and spirituality as well.
The president of the United States has claimed on more than one occasion to be in dialogue with God.
Now if he said that he was talking to God through his hair dryer, this will precipitate a national
emergency. I fail to see how the addition of a hair dryer makes to claim more ludicrous or
more offensive.
But that's great. Well, they didn't know he had a hair dryer.
Keep up the good work and try to enlighten the ignorant masses.
Thank you.
My name is Joe Butter.
I love your website.
I'm another one of your listeners who watched the World of Courage in the Bush.
Only one to describe it outrageous.
There's five people who watched the World of Courage on the Earrisers.com.
It's an important documentary and it's all right there, baby.
It's all right there.
Lays it out for you.
Just sit back, click on it and watch it and listen to it in weep.
Oh no, we don't have time for that.
We're too busy and playing golf.
Oh God.
Five, six, seven.
We better get some more movies on this pool.
We're not going to make it even to 500 votes by two o'clock.
You think?
No.
We got two ninety seven.
The votes are pouring in on this pool like one by each.
Somebody Q.A.M.
Hello.
Neil, what's going on?
Man, it's great to have you back.
Yes, it is.
This actually pertains more to George, though.
The other day he was talking about how a little kid, they're always screaming in the movies and everything.
I ended up going to the movies that I was snoring all the years.
Wow, wow, wow.
It's behind me all day.
And I turn around and I see two people and it's Mo and Gabi and Mo's going,
they're going to have a big fight.
That's how it goes.
So I'm going to pass that one over to one children.
They're just kids at heart, you know?
Hey, did you get a good night's sleep last night?
Maybe we're tossing and turning all night.
Like Bobby Lewis.
I probably should have queued that up again and played it.
I thought that was kind of cute the other day.
But I don't know what I do with it now.
Oh, huh?
That's not how it goes at all.
It's not even close.
I'm doing the backups.
I didn't sleep at all.
Come on.
I got it here somewhere.
I think that would be very appropriate.
It looks like I'm really doing a hell of a lot of work since you're only on two days a week.
You have to pretend that you're really working your ass off.
Well, I did listen to those two Paul Harvey bits and I still don't understand either one of them.
I don't hear anything new.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

Oh.
Oh.

Well, Thompson and Turnin' was number one for seven weeks.
How do you like that?
Well.
I couldn't sleep at all That's right.
I know how tight that is and they're nice going Brian.
And you....
Yaaay.
If you had told us more, more think more, more think
Then something I like is my new Joy police.
But you with ZZ don't care the way you destroyed blossoming just come home with you because you keep a long way众.

Forward. WQA and hello.

Thanks a lot, Rimmer.
You lunatic.
You nut job.
Well, we won't hear from him no more.
Thank goodness because we don't have those naked pictures on there anymore.
Speaking of pictures, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is being paid a million dollars a year as
a consultant of a company that publishes fitness magazines.
A deal critics say is a serious conflict of interest for the former bodybuilding champion.
How do you like that?
The payments revealed yesterday in five things with the US SEC are from American media operations,
a subsidiary of a company that publishes magazines including Flex and Muscle and Fitness.
You know the kind of guys who are by flex and muscle and fitness?
Yeah, right.
Okay.
Trust me.
I don't know what he says.
Believe me, people are read like those magazines.
Yeah.
Criticized the conflict is a conflict of interest because Schwarzenegger's pay comes from advertising
revenue and the magazines offer feature ads about dietary supplements.
The Governor last year vetoed a bill that would have imposed government regulations on these
dietary supplements in history.
And I happen to agree with him.
Okay.
People want to buy a bunch of quackery.
That's fine.
And there's a lot of good vitamins too, like Cokie 10.
Bill Sponsor, Senator Jackie Spire, a Democrat cold-on Schwarzenegger to cut off all ties
with the magazines, whether it's an actual conflict or not, it certainly gives the appearance
of being once you said.
Independent political observers agreed, saying we can't interact with a lack of judgment
by the Republican governor.
This is one of the most egregious apparent conflicts of interest that I've seen.
This calls into question, Arnold Judgment is the who he's working for and calls into question
what he thinks he owes the public's hitlery noble executive director for the Center for
Responsive Politics in Washington DC.
Marguida Thompson, the Governor, is spokeswoman since Schwarzenegger had disclosed all his
financial holdings and added that the deal with the fitness magazines does not represent
a conflict of interest.
Yaudi, Yaudi, and a proturgent pair of three.
How do you like that?
He'll do whatever he wants because he's an honored, he's the terminator.
So if you don't like it, go and try to beat the crap out of him.
I'm looking desperate.
I just can't find it.
I apologize.
It wasn't really worth it.
Back at a box, Arnold.
He's another one.
What a talent, man.
What a governor.
Okay, speaking of that, the desperate housewives have a little...
See, I was thinking about this also.
I do a lot of thinking these days.
Yep.
Actually, when I'm sitting on the throne.
That's my favorite.
I must be a very rare breed, although I don't think so.
They just...
The network still want to admit it because with all its choices you have now with cable
or satellite or both, why do people find them necessary to get sucked into watching
these stupid ass network shows?
Because almost all of them are pathetic.
Yeah.
The desperate housewives have a little to be desperate about now because the ABC hit

Some customers say wild horses couldn't drag them to the table at a New Zealand restaurant that's offering a charge.
Oh, this is great.
Offering a charred grilled horse meat dish called Mr. Ed is dead.
Oh, yeah.
True story.
Restaurant owner David Kura said yesterday that he received a lot of complaints and abusive phone calls after he started serving horse steaks at his eatery in Hamilton, North Ireland, New Zealand, as part of an annual event during which restaurant tourist compete to offer the best out of the ordinary culinary delights to diners.
The calls were pretty lively and disgusting and not comforting for the staff.
Kura said adding that there was swearing, cursing, horrible language compelling him to call the police.
Nevertheless, some customers couldn't wait to chow down when horse appeared on the menu at the weekend.
Kura said he sold about 10 horse steaks meals Monday night.
Something gets appalling but others are really interested to give it a go and want to know where else they can buy it.
He said leading race horse breeders, your Patrick Hogan said he certainly won't be eating horse. That's for sure.
If there was only round restaurant in Hamilton, it was his I wouldn't sit at his table said Hogan who was knighted by Britain's Queen Elizabeth the Tooth for his passion for breeding thoroughbreds.
Spokesman for the International League for Protection of Horses, Sandra Sheer said although she would not be eating horse flesh, she was not offended.
Horse meat appears in imported salamis and is often used in pet food in New Zealand.
And ported salamis, I'm not going to be eating them no more.
Well, the national convener of judges for the Montiets wild food challenge, Kerry Tai Ex said putting horse on the menu is different.
So long as they meet health and safety issues, I had no problem with he said adding that those offended will stay away.
Those interested will try it.

All right. Well, before we do that, Brad Pitt, the movie was seven years into that.
Okay. I never saw that.
Where he played the Austrian mountain climber and did a very bad European accent
with his blonde hair. Just unbelievable. Speaking of Brad Pitt, he got managed right.
I think Angelina spent too much time down in an basement and picked up some bad stuff.
To worth it, I'm sure.
Film star Brad Pitt was released yesterday from an LA hospital where he had been
amended for a fruit like illness that turned out to be viral men and judges.
Oh, my God.
He was home yesterday afternoon after his discharge.
Oh, God. I sure hope he didn't have an oily discharge and was doing well.
The punishment said. Yeah.
Oh, no. Now, here's the story.
Speaking of that good old time religion.
And after seeing this documentary last night about that guru,
Baba, Baba, whatever his name was in India.
And the fact that these people didn't, they, they, they've, number one to one guy,
this Jewish guy, he didn't want to believe no matter what they said,
because they showed a clip of this guru in front of his thousands of followers
there with one of his big performances praising this guy,
who's obviously one of his big funders, you know.
Mm-hmm.
And, oh, and the guy was in tears and it was the greatest moment of his life.
And no matter what they tell these people about him,
there's so it goes to show that when people are brainwashed to this degree,
that only the greatest amount of the programming, if then,
can like release their mind again, if that, if that, like I said, if then.
And in the, in the case of these particular two guys they showed on there,
hopeless. I mean, one guy saying,
a lot of carefree's a pedophile, a piece of child molester,
I still believe in him. No, okay.
Like there's a little jackass, there's little quizzlings out there with no life
where I, you know, doing the Michael Jackson routine outside the courthouse
and outside Neverland.
I have no life.
One of the suicide bombers who struck in London was probably recruited when he attended
a religious school in Pakistan with strong links to Al-Qaeda
and its Southeast Asian offshoot, Jeremiah Islamia, the Scotsman says,
a religious school in Pakistan security sources in Pakistan are investigating a tip off
that she's a ton of weird, attended a religious school run by the terrorist group
Lockstar in Taiba, L.E.T. during a race and business of that country.
The group's founder is publicly stated that he believes suicide bombing
to be the best form of G-Head holy war.
How do you like that?
Religious schools all need to be shut down immediately.
Let's pass the law right now, shut them down.
Stop the brainwashing now.
And again, you know, you can't discriminate, so it's got to be all religion.
Shut them all down. All the fairy tales.
Sure. It's really easy.
All you have to do is prove what you're spewing or you get shut down.
Now look at this. Elmer says the Brad Pitt movie we were talking about
was The Devil's Own.
And that's not the one I was talking about.
It's the other terrible fake Irish accent.
I went presently the worst ever around film.
That was a different one, I think.
Also, watch the world of going to Bush on your site and let me say,
Norma Meiler from President.
Add Marty Filman in the Young Frankenstein.
She heard a poll.
We even talked about that before.
I think he's got a good point. He didn't have to act.
It was a real eye pop out for me.
Eye poppy.
Yeah. Marty Filman, Young Frankenstein, is one more for the poll.
They don't like this poll that I can tell.
I thought it was different.
They haven't done it before, which doesn't make it good.
But I just thought about people who just show up and they don't have to do much because that's them.
357 votes and nobody's going to catch slice the loan.
He's got 100 votes. He's got a third of the votes.
Absolutely.
The story we had the other day about to run away a Hungarian-speaking parrot.
Got some good news.
Winfield and Diana.
Polly Wheely did want a cracker.
Oh wait a minute. This isn't the right story.
I thought this was a follow-up.
I'm always following a funny follow-up story to the ones that we have.
This is a different damn bird.
Oh geez.
Polly Wheely did want a cracker.
Sydney missing three-year-old Macau in Winfield, Indiana.
His back home with her owners.
Thanks to the help of crackers and friendly neighbors.
Michael Tauth and Erica Westby.
Those sound like the names, don't they?
Yeah.
Owners of the bright blue, golden, green parrot.
Yeah, it's the right story.
Like it in their neighborhood in Northwest Indiana with fires after their practice appeared July 3rd.
Five days later, Tina and Clay Putnam spotted a bird outside their home.
Let's see.
What are the names?
There's the Amish in Indiana.
Oh, one of those names.
Hostetler.
Oh, that's right.
Either Putnam or Hostetler.
Right.
So anyway, five days later, Tina and Clay Putnam spotted a bird outside their home.
My husband climbed the railing and fed the bird.
Townhouse crackers, Tina Putnam told the times of Munster.
Maybe some Munster cheese were ignored either.
We didn't try to capture.
We just better until Michael got to the house.
When she flew the coop, sitting with the tank by other birds, they pizza from members of a worker who tried to lure her from a tree.
Oh, she ate pizza.
I wonder if that was the one that had the anchovies that Lionel Tauth was pissed off he didn't get.
He still Westby said the trouble at all repair wasn't hurt during the adventure, but she's a pretty tired bird.
She said, oh, there's nothing worse than when your bird gets real tired.
Yeah, I heard that.
Yeah.
560.560 on the Verizon and Singular Ravus lines.
WBQAM, hello.
Hey, Nito.
Kimmy's dad.
And Joe Rose.
This is gross.
Can you play me something with Rick Weemer and Hank Goldberg?
Because I'm just pissed off about this.
And encroaching?
I ain't no movie could you, boy?
What was that?
I was hoping you could tell me.
It was pretty weak, because when it was pretty weak, dummy.
Oh, I don't have that.
Is that a card?
Tuesday you'll have to feed that down the fence.
I ride!
All right, all right.
Well, that's because we had to get rid of those cards, you know.
The fans beginning to blow the blue, the blue, the white selection.
He's spending right out of his jocks right now.
And he is on clear streak right now.
Well, I tell you, they don't make him like Rick Weemer, I'll tell you that.
And whatever happened to speaking of that.
And the midst of all this business about Jimmy Cifilis,
whatever happened to our good close personal friend,
Bill Zinford that got screwed over.
I mean, I didn't do the games no more.
What did we do?
Just what I said.
What is he doing these days?
That's what I said.
He asked?
Yeah, I don't know.
And we don't know.
I probably maybe Josh might know.
Josh doesn't even know who to help Bill Zinford is.
What's he doing?
FIU's? Play by play?
Is that what he's doing?
He was.
I'm so sorry that I asked.
This is a kind of like reminds me of the old Ayatola.
Remember the original I had not the original,
but the earlier Ayatola in the 70s.
Ayatola Homeini.
Homeini.
Ayatola Homeini who cropped in in the cast and almost fell out of the helicopter.
The body of a Louisiana man strapped to a gurney,
fell from the back of a pickup truck in Dallas today.
Under was South Dallas Highway and under the path of incoming,
oncoming traffic.
I didn't think it was possible for that to happen, said Mary Ellen Douglas,
who was driving to work when she saw what she initially thought was a package
that had fallen from a truck.
Oh, there's nothing worse than when you dropped your package from your truck.
It hurts.
It's like the...
Soar Bird's story.
I wanted to get out of there.
It was too freaky for me.
She said in the story and wins the exhibition of the Dallas Morning News.
The third he said the driver was carrying the buddy to a tree for Louisiana Feveran home
after the man died Monday at a miskeed hospital.
The driver of the truck was not aware that he'd lost the body.
Now, let's police the tenant Rick Andrew said.
He saw the open door.
He stopped and looked.
He turned around, went back, retraced his steps and found a body.
The driver is swirved to avoid the corpse and gurney.
That puts police in your corporal, Max and Girons,
and no charge of searching for the detour.
Oh, brother.
Then the thing they swirled, because that would have been like adding insult to injury.
Yeah, I hate it when that happens.
5670560, pound 560 on the Verizon and Singular wireless lines.
Somebody QYM, hello?
Don't eat me, Wilbur.
I am Mr. Red.
Oh, he died too.
Didn't he what was his name for Mr. Red?
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, yeah, you do.
Allen Young.
Okay.
Right?
I'll take your word for him.
I'll take your word for him.
Yeah, Allen Young.
He's dead.
WQAM, hello?
Oh, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How's it going?
Great.
Yeah.
Boring.
WQAM, hello?
Neil.
He's slipping down the ladder on my list.
Yes, sir.
I want to congratulate you for being there instead of here.
Yes, thank you.
How long has it been served?
If I wasn't such a slipper, I wouldn't be here.
I got the winner for your poll today.
Okay.
Courtney Laws in the People vs. Larry Slint.
Yes, you played a slot.
No, no.
That was a real stretch.
Yeah, exactly.
And a drug addict loser.
Scratch it about a tenth of an inch.
Exactly.
Good choice.
Thank you.
And in closing, Robert Creeper is the Antichrist.
Oh, I knew there was some reason he kept hanging around.
Yes.
This is the longest departure in the history of broadcasting.
Okay, I've been in his business about 800 years.
And I've never seen anybody who's been leaving so long.
I'm leaving now.
I'm leaving.
Okay, Robert.
We'll pack you a salami sandwich.
Okay, kosher.
I'm leaving.
He'll never leave.
He'll be there to the day they're going to have to like extract him from that building.
He'll never leave.
He's like part of the woodwork.
And that made me part of the reason.
As he knows, we're all about his aburry.
He's got the keys to the kingdom.
He's the only person in the building who's like a flunky who's got the keys to every orifice.
He's got the keys to the rings of orifice if he keeps my drift.
Are you drifting?
Here's what we got so far.
I'm drifting off.
I think maybe you ought to do the one and two hour.
What is that thing?
I think I've lost those.
I'm afraid I have to disk.
Huh?
This is what I've been doing.
But I can't find what I do with that damn disk.
Oh, if I lost that, that's like the end of my life.
Where is it, Volka?
Oh, here it is.
Wow, thank goodness for that.
If I lose that, that's the end of the show.
That's one of the greatest.
What's this thing?
I couldn't sleep at all.
Oh, he's still in there.
Bobby Lewis is still crossing and turning.
I'll be damned.
Let's drop his ass on the highway and see how far it rolls.
Okay, let's see if this.
Huh?
There you go.
And then of course there's always the ever-property judge quarters doing it.
Right, right.
Oh.
Just like what was it I asked you about a little bit ago?
It was kind of like...
Those in favor of the amendment will say aye.
I don't think there's a pose no.
The opinions here that no's have it.
There's some good stuff on there.
Nice going, Brian.
You're a simple and you crazy person.
Old chicken neck.
1256.
There's Jim Clancy from CNN International who's now doing this stuff in the middle of the day.
He has CNN's making cutbacks.
So they're like...they're...they're...they're piggybacking.
It's just shocking to me, you know?
How long nobody cares because nobody's watching it anyway under the age of 100.
And rightfully so, that's good.
All you young people out there don't ever watch CNN.
It'll poison your brain.
You'll have to get deep program.
In fact, just program it right off your...the TV.
That's a good idea.
Whatever channel it's on, just block it out.
Winning doubt.
CNN.
Put on the hustler channel and a playboy channel and anything else you can still get.
But block out CNN.
Paul Espatino.
Since fear is neither has one.
The Tashin, I know you'll have to look for a motion squarer.
Instead we listen to the neurologist's parent balance one to two hours.
If you think so.
Saturday morning joint, Paul win gold jaymo's and his bully, Baleisa Tom Hussain.
Or the fact that misadventures of Iraqi and Go wake up.
TV, TV, TV, TV.
The United Nations is about to speed.
Okay, give me that crystal ball.
He's breaking the gut off on the wrong side of the bunker.
Perhaps a poem will help.
To damn, to damn your one-wacked out dude.
And just like your oil, your smelly and groom.
Ha ha.
And most did you see your squirrel friend?
Oh, you mean Rocky?
Sure.
He's over there.
He's over there.
He's over there.
Oh my, Rocky!
What do you know about this to them?
Don't ask me.
Ask my auntie.
A.T.
A.T.
And the aircraft.
Oh no!
Join us next time for oil swell.
That ends well.
Or kiss your gas goodbye.
Hey, most what weather forecast for today?
Bo-Me-Oh-Oh!
Here, Racking and Go wake up.
Saturday morning on New Calonion.
102 at 5.60 W.Q.M.
It's our big one and two hour.
The mole milestone will be along a two mad dog from Cleveland and Ford.
And we've got Marlon's baseball tonight.
Be sure to get out to the stadium.
They're not playing there, but we'll keep you off the street.
They're in Philadelphia.
Marlon's there been little stumbling, fumbling, bumbley lately.
Haven't they Josh?
Yes they have.
Certainly stumbled big time against the Cubs.
That was really bad.
Not a good series.
Well, I tell you, it was really been given up runs by a bunch of people.
And that is the blue days.
Have you seen their series against Texas?
Well, they do that every year.
The holy moldy they score a few runs, but they give up whatever they score.
They give up more.
No.
They give up more.
And we can give up more.
Don't do that.
We don't want to do that.
No more.
Now, what does it, I don't understand?
Just so many things.
Is it me and I finally losing it?
I got into my twilight years or what?
I just between those three bits and now this facts, was it Igor or Igor?
It's one of the jokes from the movie.
What movie?
Young Frankenstein.
Oh, well, like I remember that?
Shouldn't you?
Oh my God, I said it like 700 years ago.
He kept calling it Igor and Igor would correct him and say, that's Igor.
Okay.
And how about Mickey work for your list and any movie he's in?
Well, we've got, huh?
We'd have to choose bar fly for that one.
Okay.
Well, we can go right ahead and do that.
Then we also got...
Offer ship prints.
Why don't you get his rocks off?
Well, how come every time I...
What?
We can care for you.
What's the time?
Well, I don't care what you can say.
I dumped it, okay?
You crazy?
Man, you can just say you can say you're rock, but you can't say rock.
You can say rock, salt, answer.
Just stay off the rocks.
391 votes on the poll.
Who best fits this?
An actor, actress, and a TV movie, or a TV or movie role?
They didn't have to act much for.
Now, we don't have any TV shows on here, do we?
We have anybody for any TV that's willing...
Yeah, that's...
Oh, yeah, willing Grace.
That's the only one.
Slice the loan.
Rocky, 114.
I mean, there's nobody even the same category.
Jack Nicholson, Cookewusness, 47.
John Volusche, an animal house, 45.
He was a tagging, you know?
Not.
Kano Reeves, Bill and Ted Zexel and eventually a 38.
Adam Sandler, happy Gilmore, 24.
Spencer Fresy, any movie he was in, 24.
Robin Williams, any movie he was in, 20.
Tom Delewies in Faso 18.
Tom Cruise in Magnolia, 16.
Wirt, Reynolds, any movie he was in except Boogie Knights, 13.
Betty Davis, baby, whatever, happy to baby Jane, 13.
Sean Hayes and Willing Grace, 8.
I've never seen that show either.
I just don't watch the network shows.
No, no, that's all right.
There's not much.
And it's just...
And believe me, I would.
But in fact, I would say after seven o'clock, after Wheeler Fortune,
so after 730, I know you watch Jeopardy.
I don't.
After 730, the networks don't even get like a touch for me,
not that they really care, but they don't even get a glance.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, I don't even...
There's just too many other things to watch.
Marty Feldman, young Frankenstein's got a pair.
James Conn and the Godfather too.
That call was something.
So via Coppola, Godfather Part III has got a pair.
Jeff Goldblum in the fly too.
He kind of looks like it.
Courtney Lennon, in fact, when he started changing,
you know, the changes were so subtle, remember the movie?
Sure.
And you thought, yeah, well, he still looks like him.
And even after he made the complete metamorphosis,
it still looked like him.
You want to just step on him.
Courtney loved the people versus Larry Flint one,
and Kevin Costum and the Untouchables, Kevin finally got one.
Kevin was too much for that, but he finally got one.
He is just so boring, so low-key.
Just no emotion, no passion, no none.
And then again, the bad, bad Phony accent in JFK,
only outdone by Kevin Bacon's bad, bad Phony Southern accent.
That draw.
And also, Joe Pesci was terrible in that movie too.
That was just a bad movie.
Oliver was stoned.
That was a really terrible movie.
And this one, that one, and this one, did it there.
But he put it there.
I like that word Joe Pesci was going.
But he put it there.
Just like that.
Yeah.
And Donald Sutherland sitting with Kevin Costum
right there in that park bench, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah, I thought for sure he was going to, like,
go back and with Cacoon again.
567.0560 was that Don Amici.
Different Cacoon.
0560.
Oliver Ryzen, singer of Ryzen.
So Blanc, Dickerson died.
That was bad, you know.
For answers Langford.
Somebody QAM, hello.
And now I got one for your fault.
TV show.
Okay.
Who's the boss, Tony Danza?
Oh, yeah.
But a big idiot who would vacuum the curtains by picking the vacuum up and holding up over his head.
And his name on the show is Tony.
So it worked out perfect.
There you go.
Good choice.
All right then.
Thanks, pal.
Tony Danza, he leaves me limp, you know.
And he gets, I mean, what's up?
Huh?
Yeah, he's just a dummy.
That's all.
What's up?
How did Tommy didn't look too bad many years ago as long as he kept his mouth shut?
Once he started talking, man.
Now, get him off my screen, you know.
Get him out of here.
Uh-oh.
Suicide bomber strike, green zone checkpoint.
This couldn't be more bad news, Delarage.
The person was killed.
Five others ruined it.
We're told here among the five was a third potential suicide bomber.
His vest did not explode.
It was diffused.
This, the US military says, is a sign of success for the Iraqi security forces.
They prevented these bombers from getting any closer, preventing the casualties from being much higher.
Oh, that's good.
See that?
We got one for today.
And the one the yesterday when all the soldiers and kids got killed, I was just an aberration.
But the one that he goes to show that we're really making some progress, right?
Yeah.
Good morning.
I told you, good news from Iraq.
Dominic Qayam, hello.
Bill.
Yes, sir.
Uh, for the poll, Ray Romano.
That's one time.
The same and everybody hates Raymond.
Yeah.
And one from Renegade, what's the actor from Renegade?
The actor from Renegade?
Yeah.
Remember the old 80s TV show, uh, Garant Lorenzo?
Oh, I guess he does.
Lamas.
Something like that.
I remember Lorenzo.
That one.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Thanks, Proud.
I remember Lorenzo.
You hate Lorenzo Lamas.
I used to love Lorenzo Lamas.
Now he's old and he's, uh, you know, old me.
Yeah, and others nothing to appreciate except his talent.
I don't care if he has any talent.
Okay, that's how good he looked.
For was that movie he was wrestling that snake?
I always ring them up.
I don't know what it was.
Snake eater.
Was that it?
It was a series of them.
Hmm.
5 6 7 0 5 6.
What do you think of it?
I think it's almost two o'clock.
Count 5 6 and they've arrived in singular rather slime.
Dominic Qayam, hello.
Uncle Leo.
Yes, sir.
I feel disgusting.
I told George that yesterday.
And I guess I kind of scared him away.
Because he knows how.
Yeah.
I feel absolutely disgusting.
Actually, just for cake, when on to your website, starting reading a little bit of the story,
I feel like I just stopped for the eye first.
I read like two or three of them.
I couldn't read any longer.
I was sick.
I'm just going to my stomach.
And you know what?
You know, you hear something that's really bad.
Sure.
I actually voted for Bush.
So yeah, I repent.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Okay.
Now we're tracing the crawl.
So when you get a little lock on the door three in the morning, if I were here,
I'd like crawl under the bed and hide because we will come get your ass.
That's the day, Uncle Leo.
Don't do it again, Pally.
Definitely not.
Okay.
So you can't help yourself.
He's brainwashed.
He's one of your people probably.
You're like, you know, you've got some ethnic thing there.
See, this is the thing, you know, I can't imagine.
I mean, maybe it's possible, but I can't imagine like African Americans in Detroit saying,
oh, we made Detroit what it is today.
I mean, if they did say that, I would say, yeah, you're right.
I have to agree with that.
And so this business about when a certain segment of the green tooth Cuban community says,
oh, we made Miami what it is today.
Well, I'm sorry, but as right as you are, I would be bragging about it, you know.
You follow what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Can you imagine black people in Detroit, I counted on the chest saying, oh, we made Detroit what it is today.
If you ever went to Detroit seriously, which I pray that you won't, neither one of you, anybody,
you would just shake your head and just say, what happened here?
Was there like a war here or something?
Obviously, there was.
It makes Beirut look like paradise, like almost as tropical, tropical,
paradiscacle as Gitmo.
In fact, I bet you Gitmo is like a head in shoulders above Detroit.
It's a toilet.
It's an outdoor septic tank, but nevertheless.
Now, this story that you sent me about thin sandar, the chicken seller in Myanmar,
which is, to me, it's still Burma to me, you know.
When you start getting old and 90% of the countries in the world have different names than they used to have,
at that point you realize you've kind of lost touch somewhere along the line, you know.
Like for a magazine.
What?
Because I had forgotten what my N-MAR was and I'm scratching my head all through that story.
Burma.
Thank you.
It's like Sri Lanka used to be Sri Lanka, you know, that little turd down there in the S&D video.
Yeah.
Anyway, a chicken seller in Myanmar had always dreamed of being a man.
When she was inexplicably, when she inexplicably grew a penis-less month,
a 21-year-old treated as an awe-inspiring omen, as have the thousands of stunned villagers
who traveled away Pagoda to see him.
On the morning of the full moon day of June 21st, I noticed my thing,
and then it says here in parentheses, sex organ, was not the same as before thin sandar,
who was always by the male name, fan-sign, thought AFP in an interview with his home.
It's home.
And my breast disappeared, thin-sign added.
So I called out and showed it to all my mom and dad.
It was very strange.
Yeah, when you're 21 and you're showing your privates to mom and dad,
I would think that it is kind of strange.
Strange enough that he's attracted significant attention in this deeply superstitious country
where the unexplained can quickly be exalted to hold powerful spiritual significance.
Google, Google.
People privately can see that Thun Sin is a hermaphrodite.
Several medical experts have examined him.
He awaits test results from the central women's hospital.
But few have come forward, I guess only I got that.
But few have come forward with a medical explanation of the transformation
as they await an official report by the health ministry,
whose experts have also examined Thun Sin.
We cannot say right now she's really undergone a sudden gender change
at a township official to kind of be named,
adding that the birth certificate shows that he was born a girl.
It can be confirmed.
I don't know why this is such a big story.
I mean, chicks with...
Yeah, let's see.
I mean, it's funny because they're making a big deal out of it.
Oh, I see.
It's religious and all that.
It can be confirmed when we receive the report from the health ministry,
although some medical checkups have shown her to be a true man, he added.
A real man.
A true priest.
Hermaphrodites also known as intersexuals are often born with ambiguous geneticity
or have both testicular and ovarian tissue in a single person.
Medical doctor, I, that's A-Y-E, I, I, I, Ladi, I, I, send Rakhang,
put it in layman's terms in local journal,
her penis appeared at the side of her clitoris that the doctor was told to the same.
Regardless of the official findings,
local villagers and other curious Myanmar nationals are flocking to the
Omye Thar Yai Yai Yai Yai Pragoda in this new satellite township,
19 kilometers, 12 miles from Yangon,
to see if they're in sign for themselves and make donations to him or the temple.
Up to 400, gather with the Pagoda each day,
often in the courtyard and under colorful umbrellas to ward off the sun's rays,
waiting for a chance to talk with and touch the inside.
Doesn't take with retouching in, they're touching it.
Well, thanks God there's people in America are doing stuff like that,
like, you know, they can stop lights with reflections of Jesus
or on the underpass and overpass with a virgin Mary.
Thank God that doesn't happen in civilized places like America, eh?
We're not superstitious.
Oh, wait a minute.
A fever taken to the Virginia Hospital Center
and checked out, checked there last night,
apparently for tests and observation.
We're expecting him to go to that house,
so though it's not certain that he's going to that house.
There's also the possibility here, but we were told from the start today,
it was unlikely that the teacher might come back to work.
There he is.
He's a Schufflin, very slowly and whispered,
I'm dying over here.

No, because I got so animated again, I knocked it down.
What it comes to sports, Neal, the author, is going to be on the story.
Sports video files.
Go, go, go, go.
And don't put a stocky.
Good morning, Americans.
It's Paul Harvey.
Stand by for news.
A couple had two little boys, Johnny and Jimmy, ages 8 and 10,
who were excessively mischievous.
The two were always getting into trouble,
and their parents could be confident that if any mischief occurred in their town,
Johnny and Jimmy were involved in some capacity.
Their parents were at their wit's end as to what to do about their son's behavior.
So they heard that a clergyman in town had been successful in disciplining children in the past,
so they contacted him, and he agreed to give it his best shot.
He asked to see the boys individually.
So Johnny, the eight-year-old, was sent to meet first with the clergyman,
who sat Johnny down and asked him sternly, where is God?
Johnny made no response, so the clergyman repeated the question in an even stoner tone.
Where is God?
Johnny again made no attempt to answer the clergyman raised his voice,
even more, and shook his finger in the voice face.
Where is God?
And at that, Johnny bolted from the room,
ran directly home, and slammed himself in the closet.
His brother, Jimmy, followed him into the closet, and said, well, what happened?
Johnny said, we're in big trouble this time.
And Jimmy, God is missing, and they think we did it.
Paul Harvey, good day.
Now, see that one, I understand. It is cute.
Yeah. Not great. It's cute.
Well, at least if you don't understand it, it's always a good start.
Huh?
20 after 1 at 5, 60, W.A.
and a 51-year-old man in East Syracuse, New York,
was arrested Wednesday for using his cell phone to take pictures of women's skirts at a Walmart store.
Police set a store security camera called Darrell Jones, Jr. of Syracuse,
taking pictures of a 19-year-old woman.
Once in custody, police discovered Jones had photos of several women stored on his phone.
Okay.
How do you do that?
Jones was charged with unlawful surveillance and being held in jail on $10,000 as well.
How do you stick your cell phone under a woman's shirt?
Watch. I'll show you.
I see.
Making Clarence Thomas is doing it for a sandwich.
Just one last time to Sandra Day.
Uh, oh, this is bad news now.
I don't want to give too much bad news.
Water managers are drastically increasing this charges from Lake Ochoe,
to the St. Lucie Estuary today, possibly the largest releases in at least two decades.
The lake at the highest level recorded in July since 1936 has risen to 16.37 feet above sea level.
High enough to require increased inspections for leaks in the lake's Herbert Hoover Dike.
I don't know Herbert Hoover was a duck.
I knew J. Edgar Hoover was a fag, but I don't know how Herbert Hoover was a dike.
Well, there you go.
Although sensitive to flooding concerns, St. Lucie River advocates said the heavy discharges
will cause an environmental catastrophe similar or worse than 1998 when a massive outbreak of facial lesions devastated the local economy.
That American lesion, man, it's a bad one to have.
This is probably going to be the catalyst for the total ecological collection I'm just sick about.
It said, Leon Aboude, chairman of the Rivers Coalition, with all the stresses on the ecosystem from developing this will just compound it.
Along with a pervasive blue-green algae bloom and persistent bacterial contamination, scientists have documented a severe decline in the health of St. Lucie River.
It's oysters and fish are further decreased in the salinity and clarity of the estuary, where likely they destroy seagrass beds as well, like it is said.
Maybe we can send rich sands there and he can put his hand down on the river and say, oh, this is not saltwater.
Would that be good?
That'd be something.
Well, whatever.
So there's some of bad ecological news.
Of course, that's not a very exciting thing.
They always say that.
The fact that we're destroying the global warming.
You all, you all, you all, you all, you all.
Nobody cares, right?
You'll start carrying man with a waters up to your armpits.
You'll start carrying.
Speaking of armpits, this story, and I've had some of these I've had sitting around, but when you're only on twice a week, you have to save them.
Save them and save them.
Save them and save them.
Fallen time to brascade.
You see this story?
I'm sure I put it on the website.
Half time man loses 573 pounds in one year.
Did we have that on there, Josh?
Sure we did.
How can you forget this story like this?
Could've felt that.
Probably rushing through.
I see.
Yeah, that would be unusual.
He's still a mound of a man, but his blue eyes widened with delight as he presses his chest with his fingertips, smiles misstivously and makes the grand announcement.
He can feel his ribs.
Oh, yeah.
And of course, after you feel them a little bit, that's the time to eat them.
Chow down.
The Patrick dual, this small moment is huge.
Headline huge.
Man can feel ribs at first in 25 years as they headline.
It's got a picture of him and boy, he is a piece of work.
One year ago, dual weighed 1,072 pounds.
By the way, it's a great movie.
Dual not spelled the same way with what's his name with the mustache?
Dennis Weaver.
Dennis Weaver.
Not to be confused with Rick Weaver.
A year ago, dual weighed 1,072 pounds.
He was so enormous that his bedroom wall had to be cut out to extract him from his home.
That's fat.
Oh, there's Bubba.
I was thinking this very frustrating to a lot of the NGOs.
They know that this looks like the Red Cross.
It got to line share of the money.
They know.
And so they're on tsunami really for the UN.
Bubba, doing good stuff.
Well, of course, our current leader is busy covering up Karl Roven to advance stuff and busy planning how to kill some more people.
Anyway, he was so big his bedroom wall had to be cut out to extract him from his home.
Then he was rushed away.
South Dakota, hospital and ambulance with extra wide doors and a ramp and winch system that had to be dispatched from Denver.
One man, more than a half a ton, mind boggling.
So too, with the grim realities of dual's life, he hadn't left his bedroom in seven months.
And this is even without her all are getting involved.
Remember all those shows he kept doing that was one of his specialties.
He had Sally Jessie with her teenage, whatever it was.
What was that deal she had going?
Oh, I forgot.
No, boot camp.
Every show was about teenage boot camp.
Yeah.
They're dangerous.
We're afraid of him sent him off the boot camp, straightening the ranch out.
And now she's off the ear.
So too, with the grim realities of dual's life, he hadn't left his bedroom in seven months.
He barely been outside in seven years.
He couldn't sit up.
He couldn't roll over by himself.
Yeah, I doubt this.
No, that problem.
You're fair.
He had heart trouble and diabetes and needed oxygen.
Patrick dual was dying.
That was about the only thing he could say.
I'm dying on the hand.
A photo taken by a student shows a pneumatic like figure sprawled helplessly on his stomach, looking like an inflated balloon.
Like a gigantic cube.
Now, twelve months after being hospitalized for gastric bypass surgery, dual sits on a love seat that he's in the bed.
He's propped up on cement blocks.
He still looks like a plus-sized Buddha, but he's less than half the man he used to be.
And that his doctor says, is amazing progress and the patient agrees.
I used to look at him here and start.
I was looking at the Michelin man.
He says, all of a sudden, I look more like a human being.
I thought it looked kind of like the Pillsbury-Doboy.
And I say, oh my God, where did he come from?
Dual does a quick inventory of his shrinking yet still massive body.
He touches his ribs.
He stretches his fingers like fans to see bones and tendons.
But the real number one is the magic number on the scale, 499 pounds.
He pumps a flusher arm in triumph.
He hasn't been under 502 decades.
Dual now goes out almost every day, walks a tad, a little bit, exercises, and thinks about all the things he hopes to do someday.
Life is infinitely better, he says.
I like that.
He weighed a thousand and seventy-two pounds, and now he's a mere shadow of himself, 499.
Huh?
How about that?
Pretty sure.
I know you have no sympathy for people with eating disorders like that and usually your heart will explode.
See, the people who have never been fat and never battled fat.
Never lost anyone to fat.
Not if I am here insensitive.
Right.
So I'm here.
Mm-hmm.
So he has sensitive, I mean, I am.
So let me tell you about the Briar's rocky road.
Why come to intro to this?
Please come to see the biggest personnel game.
We'll be the watchers on the BG-17.
Support for your fight, safety.
Q-A-M.
Miami.
John Faire, the taxi car, the budget driver, the central park.
You look that mean, Joe Quizca-Gurie.
I could tell he was in a dock.
So I acted out my puncture rate, and with my arms the trees I made.
No bug speaks English and a model.
I went down to Miami and reached where the weather was nice and sunny.
I walked into a liquor store, but a guy there talks real funny.
I asked him for a pint of Holtzian Beemysus, no one to end up.
What does that mean?
The butter's pitch English and a model.
So I had to call the Delhi.
Hell, I think I'm in Pakistan.
Speak English, Meled.
Or you can go back to La Raa.
I came here many years ago, and learned my ABC.
I don't say much is grossiest.
I said pretty pretty.
So get yourself to a classroom quick here in America now.
Stop making mistakes.
You know what I said, speak English.
Come on in.
Are you sure?
31 positive, 29-02-560WQAM.
And speaking of that story, I just had moments to go and speak in the fact that nobody cares about the environment,
or about global warming, all these other fantastic liberal lines.
With a record number of dead sea birds washing up on West Coast beaches from Central California to British Columbia,
marine biologists are raising the alarm about rising ocean temperatures and dwindling plankton populations.
How about that?
Something big is going on out there.
It said Julia Parrish and associate professor in the School of Aquatic Fisheries and Sciences at the University of Washington.
I'm left with no obvious smoking gun, but birds are a good signal because they feed you high up on the food chain.
Coastal ocean temperatures are 2-5 degrees above normal,
which may be related to lack of uptwelling, in which cold, nutrient-rich water is brought to the surface.
Uptrulling is fueled by northerly winds that sweep out near shore waters and bring cold water to the surface.
The process starts with the marine food chain, fueling algae and shrimp-like curl populations and feed small fish,
which then provide a source of food from a variety of sea life, from salmon to the sea birds and marine mammals.
On Washington's beaches, birds are verres in May, typically find an average of one dead branch,
quorum-orant, every 34 miles of beach.
This year, quorum-orant deaths average one of very intensive a mile,
quorum-day together by volunteers with a coastal observation and sea bird survey team.
This is somewhere between five and ten times the highest number of bird deaths we've seen before.
She added that she expressed June figures to show a similar trend.
In 50 years, this has never happened, said Bill Peterson,
an oceanographer with an National Oceanic and Administrative Administration in Newport, or a gun.
If this continues, we'll have a food chain that is basically impoverished from the very lowest levels.
Problems at the bottom of the food chain could also be related to decreases in juvenile salmon populations this summer.
How do you like that? We got some tourist going on out there, but we don't care about that. It's really boring.
It's not sexy, it's not exciting, it's not like they run away bride and American idol and all of that stuff.
Bubba's going up.
He's having a wonderful time.
There you go, he's having a good time. You know what that means, don't you? That's code.
And his nose just started to get a little bit longer there, Bubba.
Well, we sure miss you, Bubba. I'll tell you that big time. Badly. Badly.
That punk that called before that said he admitted that he voted for Bush, okay?
You better go get some confession, okay, from your priest. You better go to the altar and kneel. Get some absolution.
Dale, God!
Yeah.
Oh, I also another story from my pile. I keep forgetting to mention this, it's like a week old.
But this port then some really great stuff going to be happening in Americans society very soon.
And of course, starting October 1, that will be a really good time to go out and buy your own taser.
Do you see the story about the civilian model?
No, it did not.
Oh, yeah. Taser International Inc. in Fort Lauderdale, the maker and their busy making all the guns in Hiley,
and they're making tasers in Fort Lauderdale. Oh, wonderful place, Florida, man. Do I miss it or what?
No.
Taser International, the maker of the controversial police stunt guns that cannot grow men flopping to the ground,
has another market ordinary people such as Ruth Siderman.
Hi. Siderman 45 had carried a two shot derringer in her pants pocket until about a firing a bullet and a new verbute.
It's good thing it didn't go into work though.
She wasn't seriously hurt but the mishap rather than the parkman woman left her looking for another way to protect herself.
Ruth Siderman, I wonder if she's related to Rich Spider-Man, you think?
Who?
Siderman's choice, it taser X26C that she bought for $1,000 and Western Armistra sporting goods in Davy.
That was $1.
$1.105 South Florida gun shop selling the new weapons.
Well, it's a newfangled thing, you see.
In Florida and 42 other states, almost anyone can legally buy a taser according to the company's website.
And the weapons are not registered or tracked by the state or federal governments.
It's a splendid idea.
Since 1994, the company has sold the public these stun guns which pack the same electric punch as police tasers and that makes critics nervous.
And as the internationalist counted more than 100 suspects in police custody including even South Florida who have died after a taser's zap.
Medical examiners have blamed most of the deaths on drugs, not the stun guns.
So yeah, it's just the drugs, the roots.
None of the failin' citizens have involved citizen tasers.
Even so, critics want more tests to ensure the weapons are safe.
Amnesty International is called for a unilateral ban on personal tasers since spokesman Edward Jackson.
There's no accountability, no oversight to pull out the policies just aren't there to protect the public.
To protect the public, through that we are angry.
We want to knock some people down.
Eight states do bar tasers say sales to the general public.
While Florida doesn't specifically limit who can buy the weapons, it makes two stipulations.
People carrying tasers must have a concealed weapons permit which excludes felons and people under the age of 21.
And state law made it so kids under 16 can't use a stun gun without adult supervision.
Taser International says that test proof its products are safe and that the company regulates its own weapons by doing background checks.
And refusing to sell the weapons to felons, sex offenders, ex-cons, terrorists or anyone under 18.
Before the introduction of the ex-26C, the Scottsdale Arizona based company says it sold 100,000 over models of its weapons to the general public.
In recent years, tasers sales keep almost entirely on pull-rees.
Then lies the company introduced the latest division model, a six inch pistol-like gun small enough to slip into your purse, George.
A lot of women that I know will not permit their husbands to have loaded firearms in their house if they have children's settlements after buying her ex-26C, I think this might change their minds.
Like the police version, the ex-26C uses compressed nitrogen to shoot two barbed darts.
The darts they connected to the gun by a hearth in the wires stretching 15 feet shorter than the 21 to 25 full range of the police version.
The wires carry a jolt, a powered by a bad way in the gun, it can last 30 seconds.
Next time's longer than the five seconds are delivered by law enforcement models to give shooters time to escape their attackers.
Two stores in Dade, two in Broward and one in Palm Beach County struck the new model.
While taser international hasn't publicly produced closed sales figures, local dealers say few of the new models have been sold.
A fact-gundee was attributed to that $1,000 price tag. Wait till they start selling them for like 50 bucks, you know.
100 bucks, everybody don't feel like 200 bucks.
Right, there you go. Everybody in your hurdle have one.
When in doubt, zap them out. And it would seem to me it's only the 14th in July, so you got plenty of time to like to overfirst, right?
Right. Because then October 1st, it's not like someone way like that and then rooting your whole life going to the slumber forever.
Here you can just taser them, you know, never teach them they won't do it again.
They might. You know, the fact that that law passed in Florida all the way to come as those are probably the kind of fat ass governor and legislature that we've got.
And then the fact that most of the people supported, you know.
Somebody takes your park in spot, you know, you don't have to worry about getting charged.
Somebody looks at your cross eye. If somebody, you know, wins it your wife, whatever it might be, somebody cuts in funny in the supermarket.
Just blow their crap away starting October 1 in Florida. Okay.
How about place to be planted? If you come to work and somebody looks at you, the sour look on their face, you think they might be a threat to you and your job and your security and your safety.
Just blow their crap away. Sounds like one hell of a deal.
What do we got so far in that pool? Not too much. They hate this pool. I'm so sorry. I apologize profusely. I'm really surprised.
I thought it was a good concept. Maybe just, I don't know. Did I tell you before the show they don't get it? Well, we were talking about that.
Yeah. 456. We're not even going to make it to 500 by two o'clock. Oh, we don't come to get to 500 by two. I'm not coming in tomorrow.
Who best fits this in actor, actress and TV or movie?
In a role that they didn't have to act too much for and about and with.
Slice, low and rocky. 126. That's him. John Voluschi, animal house 52.
Jack Nicholson, Kuku's, that's 49. Cano Reeves and Bill and Ted's excellent adventure. 48.
Adam Sandler and happy Gilmore 28. Spencer Tracy, any movie he was in 25.
Tom Delewe's in Faso 23. Robert Williams, any movie he was in 20.
Bert Reynolds, any movie he was in except Boogie nights 18. Tom Cruisen, Agnolia 18.
Boy, they we hate him now like poison. Yeah, I was getting really tired of him.
Thick poison. But now with his whole routine, I would as him.
He had the publicity stunt, you know, this whole sick hopping on the couch and being the psychology expert.
All of a sudden the crap. He just got to hate him like poison. Hey Tom, you're fairy.
Anyway, you're glib. Many Davis and whatever happened to baby Jane 13.
Sean Hayes, Will and Grace 9. Courtney, love the people versus Laurie Flint.
Courtney, starting to make a move. You can smell it. 8. Marty Felben, young Frankenstein 4.
Tony Danza, who's the boss three. Mickey, work in barfly 3.
Sophia Coppola, the Godfather Part 3 dad. She has got three.
James Cahn and the Godfather 3. Jeff Goldblum, the fly to and Kevin Costa and the
Here, give you an interview.
Sure.
Sure.
Sure.
Sure.
Sure.
On the next intervention, the Kenner family confronts their mother about her crippling addiction.
What are you all doing here? And why is my cabinet empty?
Honey, we locked your cabinet and threw away the key.
Face it, Mom. Your heart's on humble figurines.
When a collector's addiction is far from miniature, it's time for an intervention.
It's not an addiction. I can stop collecting anytime I want.
Classic case of denial, Mom. We're checking you into a humble rehab.
Hummel rehab.
They'll help you by gradually switching you to Yadro.
I hate Yadro.
Sometimes the only cure for a collector sickness is intervention.
This is ridiculous. I need a drink.
I'll pour you one, honey.
Hey, what happened to my shot glass collection?
Dad, we need to talk.
Oh, boy.
I'm looking for the tenures.
You know what I'm saying?
I still don't get it.
So I'm going to have to send you the movie now.
No thanks. It's a good movie.
It's good and brutal. I doubt you'd get through it.
Really?
Yeah.
But it doesn't have the turd scenes that we had in train spotting.
No, no.
In this movie.
It's like a force to me.
Really?
Yeah.
I'll pass just to keep it related around.
It's back there.
Now, what movie did you bring in for Josh?
Oh, 1984.
Because I doubt he read the book, but considering all the stories that we're reading.
Oh, I'm sure he'll be really into that.
Everybody's saying all these old, well-earned things.
What is it?
He'd appreciate it.
It's got pubic hair.
Oh, that's right.
WDQA, I'm Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, once you've won your birthday, I was happy to have one of that known for Jim Carey, man.
I mean, this guy is the same freaking actor.
I mean, the shape point is never-frick a movie.
Yeah, that's cool.
All like physical comedy.
It's horrible.
I mean, it's pathetic.
I mean, it was funny.
I thought it was like, he's been through it like that.
But I mean, ever-
Talk, why don't you mention him?
Because I was thinking about him.
I saw him on for a second.
The other day I was thinking, well, he sure, he kind of like vanished in the finair.
Yeah, I mean, this guy's like, I mean, he's one, he's not.
I think one dramatic movie.
And that's that eternal sunshine, which was all right.
It was no big deal.
But I mean, everything else he does is just a quirky Jim Carey.
I mean, it was funny at the time, but I mean, you're kind of pretty good.
And the other guy I thought of was Ashley Kutcher.
He's pretty much the same thing.
He's thinking movie, it's a romantic comedy, and he's the same film, you know, like, uh,
I think, I think, I think, uh, it was thinking movie was the operative term, right?
Right.
It makes a lot of pally.
No problem.
Okay, you got him?
Ashley Kutcher Kutcher, who's starting a boy, he sure lost it real fast.
And then, who's the other one?
Uh, Jim Carey.
Oh, yeah.
I know you didn't forget.
Good Canadian boy, Jim Carey, but he's right.
He wore out his welcome with it, you know, with the whole, the lips apart,
the whole, the facial, the whole deal.
Yes.
Real quick.
And he sure ain't no Jack Nicholson, you know, as far as Batman is concerned.
56670560, it wasn't about Jack Nicholson, it was a, what's his name?
Cesar Romero.
Right.
The Joker, eh?
Jim Carey's good Canadian boy, who else we got?
The Joni Mitchell?
A lot of people I didn't realize were Canadian Archonude.
Not that it should make any difference, eh?
It's just that nowadays most people don't want to be called American.
Like Leslie Neilsen, for example.
And Martin Short, they you hate like poison.
Huh?
It's that short thing.
Oh, that's it.
72 a.m.
Hello.
Hey, man.
Good afternoon.
How are you?
Good evening.
How are you doing?
I'm fine.
I just want to say thank you for the, uh, God make you everyone your work.
It's about the world according to Bush.
I want to start two parts outstanding.
All right.
Number seven.
Oh, yeah.
We're building the viewership of that one, uh, elusive at a time.
Oh, no, there's the best document I've seen in my long, long time, man.
Right.
Just let it tell you thanks about it.
And for the poll, George Bush for the one of the president, man.
I'm going to say it again.
I probably shouldn't because I'm sure you're not plugging it out of it.
I'm under Wednesday and Friday and rightfully so because you know, you always your time.
Right.
But I'm one of those people who just likes wasting time because that makes it go by much faster.
What, that video?
Yeah.
Yeah, I talk about it.
Are you plugging it?
The world of coin to Bush.
It's the best documentary I've seen in years.
You need to watch it.
You need to make everybody else watch it.
You need to send it around, ship it around, uh, et cetera.
It's on eoroges.com.
Parts one and two.
It's a two hour documentary from the BBC, which originally aired last October.
It was repeated the last Sunday night on CBC and luckily during channel surfing, I just
happen to find it and the movie too.
And what really it's just heartbreaking.
I'm not, you know, not surprising.
I'm just naive.
It's just real good that we've had to probably it's the best thing that ever happened.
Was we had a drop the abedit curtain you want to know why?
Why?
Because now we can concentrate on it.
In fact, Josh is going to have to get up like it four in the morning and work till midnight.
Because I think I'm going to start sitting like four or five, six hundred stories every day.
On the weekend, even though you told me that I was going to be doing it on the weekend.
What? What? What?
You know what?
You called me hysterically saying that he was getting stories from both of us.
Well, not his name.
And I never told you to put him on the weekend.
You did, but I'm glad you got it.
No, I'll put him on the weekend.
All right.
Okay. All right.
Yeah. I mean, I told you one weekend I wasn't going to be here.
Oh, okay, for that weekend.
For that particular weekend, but you just missed the thing.
So in other words, he was in a panic because he was getting stories up to the old record.
No, he's on it.
A hundred on that day.
Oh, geez.
Well, he used to it now.
And I'm not going to redo that much.
But because we've lost half of the traffic on our website, it's got nothing to do with the fact
it's the middle of July.
It's holidays.
And that's not it.
And just remember, the more stories he posted will bring more people to news.
Right.
It's like the more nude pictures we would have put up, it would bring more people to porno.
Right?
Absolutely.
We got rid of the 50% of the people we're just using our website to get their jollies.
And just they're really seriously desperate.
I have no idea.
That's that.
You know, it's served its purpose.
We did a fine job.
We had some real great flesh on there.
And now we can't do it in no more, okay?
We're real happy to continue.
We just can't.
So now just like that, just like a slap in the face, you know.
Oh, yeah.
50% of the traffic on there go away.
And of course, we already knew that.
You know, you had to know that.
But all these punks that were on there looking at some naked chip on there every day.
They couldn't give her crap.
What else was on the damn poll on the website?
Not a poll, the stories, any of it.
Except maybe some of those funny sounds.
Maybe some of those funny sounds.
Or is it one?
Oh.
Don't forget boys and girls, if you want to make money in this world, always appeal to the lowest common denominator.
And in America, you'll be right on target.
When it comes to sports, we really afford to force when you're by security.
To weigh in.
Holy macken on.
This is Joe Bo on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and you're listening to the hockey authority, Neil God.
The creator, Bob Gildoff, unounces his most ambitious charity super concert ever.
It's one hit wonder a, more than 50 bands will take the stage to raise money for them.
Among those scheduled to appear, that sees midnight butterman without hats.
Go crash test money, Meredith Brooks, Steve Light and Tommy Tutto.
All proceeds from one hit wonder a go directly to those in desperately needed life.
Kajatuku, Thomas Goldie, Gopaha, Manlou Vega, Modern English, Ham, Katrina, and the Waves.
Please wonder where their next meal is coming from.
And now you can help the pro climbers on their finals.
Bob Gildoff and Bono, on a while we're loathed together.
I think between the two of them there were a crazier and a bit much.
Oh, but we got $25 billion more committed.
First it was by 2010, now it's by 2015.
By the way, the whole half of the country's, yeah.
Right, they'll make more.
I see.
Oh, you don't have to worry about it because they're not going to be around in 2010 or 2015.
So it really doesn't make that much difference.
Instead of educating the people over there, instead of teaching them about birth control,
instead of teaching them about how to prevent disease and about all this baloney about how they're not going to like,
if they have sex with a virgin, they're not going to get rid of their HIV and things like that.
But all we want to do that, because that would piss off the right wingers and the pope and all these other allunatics.
So let's sing some songs, that'll do it.
Cool, bye.
Yeah, that's going to do it.
We are the world.
Dear dinners, come in.
Yeah, your dinners come and just hang on until we sell some songs.
And anyway, it's just stupid crap.
Here's the fact that says, don't know if you've seen the attached article yet.
Only one phrase comes to mind after reading it.
You're fairy.
Also, my suggestion for the poll, it says Robert Redford, all the presidents' men.
Bob Woodward is arguably one of the most boring men to ever walk the face of the earth.
And Robert Redford, I agree, is one of the blanest actors ever to make it bigger than Hollywood.
I agree. Let's get that honor.
Robert Redford, all the presidents' men.
Perfect casting, no likely required.
And we'll be staring Robert Redford, Kevin Costner, and William Hurt,
would produce catatonic hair like he wouldn't believe.
Everybody would need their own.
You're right, Terry.
Regarding Robin Williams, in 1986, he made a little scene movie called Seize the Day,
a heavy drama based on the Saul Bellan novel of the same name.
It was a very heavy, depressing movie.
And Robert Williams left his conning around at home and turned in a superb,
gallop-rencing performance.
So it didn't happen once, although it was almost certainly an accident.
And then it says, don't come back to this hellhole.
I think you mean Sith Hole, based on the story that follows?
It says Mark.
I won't mark, just briefly.
PSF Public Allowing Would About It, a CIA agent during Clinton's legitimate administration,
when he had been lynched on the spot, he says, I screw it, why bother with talking about Tom Cruise?
Some more, now you're talking.
Hey, Tom A.
You're fair with me.
Oh, look.
Yeah, that's pop.
He needs some pills.
Trust me.
Yeah.
So anyway, here's the story that he sent.
And he has to, he's right, you have to be careful about the name of this guy.
Harari's in Bobway.
Oh, that's where all I thought is going to be coming in and all that.
And not only that, but that $25 million, I'm sure that once those great democracies
over there get all that money, that they're fair and balanced and elected leaders,
will be distributed and make sure that everybody gets their share, right?
Is in Bobway in court as the old man, masquerading as a female athlete court official said today?
Samo Kaliso, Sith Hole.
A cripple jumper and runner who competed as a woman at several international sports events
was convicted on charges of impersonation, and, finally, dignity of woman athlete,
who, under arrest in his presence, unaware that he was a man.
You're fairing.
He was sentenced to four years imprisonment, but six months were suspended.
He got suspended a sentence.
Effectively, he'll serve three and a half years at a court official in Quikui,
Senthal's in Bobway, where the case was heard.
Sith Hole won a gold medal at the regional tournament in Botswana in June last year,
and won five medals at a youth championship in Mauritius.
He also competed in Javelin and Shotfoot competitions.
Sith Hole told the court of his first appearance he had both,
oh, here we go again, a lot of this going around, you know what?
All right.
Well, I got an idea for you.
Why don't you just go f*** yourself, huh?
He told the court of his first appearance he had both female and male organs
that he lived as a woman at the consultant, a traditional healer.
A medical examination showed he was just a man.
Just a man, he didn't have no f*** right, one of those.
Maybe he was one of those, but he didn't have one.
Oh, rogue Hasley.
Yeah, Geltcarrow is one.
Either one you pick, okay?
Anyone that you pick, pick the organ and that's him, except for the heart part, Hammond,
Worldlitzer.
497, oh, we can make it to 500.
That's not a big number, but I, that would impress me with this bull,
because they obviously hit it like poison.
What do you got?
What are you going to refresh it?
We got two minutes.
A minute and a fifty seven seconds, but who's got it?
I'm stuck up, I'm hung up.
Why is that?
I don't know.
498, that's just the same thing.
498, that's pretty great, but.
Huh?
Yeah, I got 498 also.
I don't think they understand this bull.
And now toward the ASN, like the Robert Richardson and all the president's men,
that's a classic example.
He's just an incredibly low key coma inducing actor.
That's all, I know, I never knew what the big stimulus was him.
498 still, oh no, don't tell me in a minute and a half we can't get two more votes.
We get it.
That would be bad.
I just refreshed it again.
499.
They're pouring in one at a time.
This is like the carry votes in Ohio, those last couple hours and election night.
Remember?
There's various votes.
Vosha's votes were coming into a bushel barrel, and the carry's votes were trickling in one at a time.
One, not a two.
Oh, we got five hundred.
You got five hundred.
Let's hear it.
Nice going to this audience.
You're what?
Every now and then.
Okay, let's see what we got here now.
I'll see you on Tuesday.
I better take that back.
I'll talk to you on Tuesday.
Right.
I'm going to say, oh, you coming in again, oh, I better pick you up.
That's the end of the bus.
National M.O.
He's a great guy.
They do a super job.
But a little bit, you know, you've got to watch your, you watch your peace and cues when he's listening.
Man, are you coming to a Tuesday?
No chance.
Okay.
I was having a coronary if I was like my last legs, no, no chance.
Anyway, we got most speaking, the last legs coming along next.
The moment, the molemeister.
You can't complain about his talent.
And we got the mad dog at doing a show from Cleveland between 4 and 630.
Marlon's our decades, 630 tonight followed by the Marlon's and Phil Phenophilic game, any K after baseball tonight.
Bye, bye, bye.
