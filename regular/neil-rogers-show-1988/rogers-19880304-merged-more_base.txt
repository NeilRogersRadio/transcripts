rusty
oh
do you think there's some correlation
between him giving us food
and then a few days later
disappearing midnight melodies
did we play something called midnight melodies
no i have a note from uh... normand can't the attorney
up in brown and just a note yeah i know normand two just a note to share with you how much i enjoyed my monday morning drive the court
listening to something you call midnight melodies
just keep up the bastardly deeds
midnight is that mean
midnight melodies
i wonder how many people want me to put together that thing
you know i was thinking about that my favorites
are from the uh... early fifties through the eighties and do a whole show on that
realize how much money it would cost me to go out and buy all that music
because i'm thinking our library
i just don't think that we probably have like green door by gym low
sure we do
and here is on zeta four
we have some surprises in store today
hey
because uh... denis fold your roses not going to be in today okay roses are going to be away from the weekend
and the rumor is
as i was told last night
that rose and the gary laran's are executive vice president and general manager and all around uh...
fascist sympathizer uh... that they may be actually traveling somewhere this morning in the vehicle okay now probably not this early
but maybe a little bit later in larth's vehicle you mean
in some of these i don't know does it make a difference whose vehicle it is
i don't understand what you're saying the vehicle
oh
maybe ed can help us out okay
ed
somebody turned a damn power off on his machine
you don't even have an ed
how was that possible somebody's been in here again
so
i don't know if you can
put up with that but i guess if you really want to listen to this tape you're going to have to
i know
i know and now listen we started this tape 24 hours ago ladies and gentlemen
this is a tape that was said to us by the marvelous gentleman up in fort lauderdale
it had all these great bits on it that we were going to maybe play on the year and some we couldn't play
and uh... we've been sampling it for 24 second hours and ed is still talking
it's the intro i can't get he's still doing the talk up
he's at acn b2
in the history of broadcasting even rich sure has never done a 24 hour talk up ladies and gentlemen
we have not gotten to the first bit
it is incredible no
i can't believe it can you believe your very ears
i tell you if you miss the first part of the show you really
in fact several people told me i was really surprised that they heard that routine and it was
hysterical if not intended to be funny in the least bit
but my favorite you know my favorite hour of the show is the first hour always because you know some
mornings you and i are like asleep i mean it's just speak for yourself would you please
one morning my feathered friend one morning you and i were asleep let me change that one morning you and i were out of it
what's amazing i'm out of it every morning but i would say that
i wish by the way i wish this uh... this wacko over on the beach would stop sending me these stupid cards and letters
with a printing about uh...
jesus superstar virgin mary omega moon new eight you know all they do is go right in a waste
basket i have no idea why he's wasting all that money
you know what mid and look at here's another one
tom hidey hidey or hidey or something like that
what what what are you looking for
and i hope that guy shows up to cut my hair today right now i climb cut yesterday
did you and that great and uh big day needs his hair cut too he is here only because we have that other car coming later on
and going to have two cars to drive out of here and that was not an easy accomplishment i can assure you now
you have another car coming here just one for a week at Tiffany
if you see nose you know but you do need another car it's true
oh absolutely i'm glad you got seven days in a week and that'll make it right
that's right so if there's anybody out there's got like a nine twenty eight s or something like that
that they want to let me uh... you know drive around for a year or so we'd be delighted
you have another five yeah another car coming okay all right well you know i'm crazy i'm weird i just
want one car i know you did have two for a while there let's not get back into that oh that's not unless you want to
if he ever comes back in here i think you'll have an apology and me talk to you that was not you spoke to him about it already
yeah and he didn't know what i was talking about he's uh... sound asleep it's three minutes till six on zeta four
now let's give those numbers out it's a Friday morning and i would suggest if you're listening to the show in a car right now any kind of a vehicle
uh... we're doing our own little survey here in fact we hired away the program director from y 100 that 10-year-old kid
and he's out there counting headlights so turn on those headlights flash him real nice now and uh... that'll indicate to everybody around you that you're listening to zeta four okay
that spot that they are running is the most insipid stupid thing if you stopped and really thought about what it says
oh yeah now they won't play the same record twice in an hour i think that you know that's not what he says he says you won't hear the same song every hour
now what does that mean can you explain that to me means what i just said that they won't play the same song twice in one hour that's what it means but that's not what he
are you following this i know he says we won't play the same song every hour that's what it means
yeah now you are aware that this entire series of spots you know they're sequels right they ask for your input then they come back and you know they've taken your input now here's what they're going to do
WZTA Miami Beach Fort Lauderdale in the Palm Beach is it's 558 yes well these were all done at the beginning that's what my point is these were all done at the beginning
they were all done at one time you are aware of that speaking of what nothing did you have an idea there yeah that's okay
okay be moody and all that kind of stuff i can't help it i was going to let you play it are you sure now later okay oh that's good now he's turning his own pot down
do you hear that that sounded really good are you going to talk into that mic that's up on the ceiling there or what
now now we're going to make a pledge to okay we're not going to play the same song twice in one hour okay you think rose
forger is already in the car with our fascist sympathizer general manager we can only five 59
okay now let me ask you a question when it gets to be like six o'clock like a couple of seconds afterward would that be not playing the same song twice in the same hour
absolutely correct you absolutely got see that's what they're going to do kids in y100 they're going to play like Michael Jackson some real
wimpy Michael Jackson record about four minutes of the hour and then they'll come on with some big ID you know
a whole big song of dance and then they'll play it again at like a minute after the hour also you can have
cap and Dave do his big ID here yeah and that's a good idea and then you can play it right after it
but maybe i should play because it it is kind of what you're talking is it good well it's it's an air
check that we got from y100 i think so all great let's hear that i can't wait
getting near the time of the hour with funny socks on zeta 4 wzta miniviche for a lot of the farm
vices radio station where we don't say the same thing every five minutes we get into it right
funny yeah i just hear you say that we don't say the same thing every five minutes what was that i
said did i just hear you say that we don't say the same thing every five minutes you wrong brain
you just broke the rule sure dead i got it funny one go let's go let's go
we got it funny size on zeta 4
well it's six o'clock on wzta miniviche for water the the pop beaches
well i just thought i better say it because i don't know if mumbling the ID makes it
does that make it legal or not i it's true okay anyway here we are let me give those numbers out
because i know the audience is going to be responding with a frenzy today don't you think oh yeah
you think so no doubt there's no question and a figure i was listening big david's here okay
oh great just mention that in passing his mic is on the ceiling but he is actually here
i'm sure you'll call and he's not making any maneuverers to try to lower it so that
indicates something to me i mean indicates he's asleep i think he is asleep i'll tell you what
i think i deserve some kind of an award for actually rousing you leave it out of the sack and
getting him in here to well he's thrilled to be here about but i must tell you the the worst part
of the whole deal was i had to listen to him singing to all the songs that were playing this
morning on the way to work which was a punishment far worse than death exactly wait does that
mic work now that's your own mic by the way i know i never this is this is pretty interesting does
it seem like it's fading out or something that's like the phone calls this doesn't work either what's
it doesn't this level we can't hear it at all well how about now this is work yeah well he said
it's sad i just blew days how about now does it work now big days okay that's good i can
say it works great i really a little bit too good probably anyway it's a 602 on zeta 4 now listen
Monday when you with Monday somebody said to me Sally i saw Sally yesterday and you know what she
said to me about you she said lately you've gotten just back to your old self again you just
cackling up a storm and while i told you're getting paid by the cackle that's when she understood it
well i can't say absolutely not yeah and uh you're just out of control again i don't know what the
hell has happened maybe it's all the food that came in this week but anyway Monday morning at 830
and this could be the beginning of a series of swimsuit contests uh Cooper city high allegedly the
seniors are having a skip day on Monday that's the rumor and we can get some verification on that
before the show is over and they're going to be out here in front of the window perading around
in their bathing suits young ladies and men young men and ladies and some who are kind of like in
between and we're going to judge and we'll come up with something we'll find some albums or CDs
or something to give away yeah we got some prizes do we yeah how about some of those old pink
Floyd tickets those ought to be good some sting tickets ought to be good too yeah and a little
squeeze too okay at 603 and here are those numbers that you've been waiting for in date county
now it is interesting that they're already like four lines lit up which is pretty good right
mm-hmm but i do remember back on a m do you remember the days when lines used to flash without
the numbers just automatically and we would just punch them up every day and then somebody came
along and started doing a screenless thursday which i thought was an incredibly original idea
in the date county 620 3600 that 620 3600 and it bowered 7779 3600 now what do we need to
wake the audience up this morning okay and you notice he is nowhere to be found again he's
reverted back to his old tricks he's scrounging for food in the lobby now he really is tell me more
about selling what do you want to know what she said about she said that you have been cackling
up a storm lately that for a while you were kind of quiet and subdued and that lately you're just
constantly cackling that you're never stopping now with that a positive or a negative
well i don't know she just uh and that's the question is put on some weight Sally if you're listening
honey you got to stop i mean seriously she's put on some she goes from one extreme to the other
she goes from string bean to uh pudgy yeah and she's even like broken out i mean she's probably
eating chocolate by the pound now or something Sally you got to stop frustrated well yeah there's
something like that hmm too many of those movies honey you'll do it to you it's uh four minutes
four minutes after six on zeta four now do you want to do the weather now no better not let me do
shells first okay and i wish they how he would come back from wherever he went do you have any
idea where he went why do you want him back like i said i'm serious i just get nervous when he goes
away for these prolonged periods of time he got his food and he's all right he's got his food well
what a what a great segue in this shells right if you don't have any hostess twinkies at dinner time
why not head for shells for delicious shellfish in great pasta and that shrimp pasta is so good
that it's absolutely unbelievable i mean it is just delicious and shells is not a fancy shmancy
place with tuxedos and fancy waiters and all that other kind of garbage it's a very informal laid back
place take the whole family in there the kids can cry and make them big scene and everybody can
have a good time and you're gonna absolutely love the food the prices and the casual atmosphere
it shells a full pound of freshly steamed shrimp for example is only seven dollars and 90 cents all
shells crabboard is weighing into pound and a half each and started only six ninety five and they
give you a shrimp scampy that's this huge bowl of incredible shrimp for just seven ninety five in
a ways of full pound so you stop in any evening beginning at five p.m. at any of the three shells
locations for fantastic seafood and fantastic value it's just fantastic and here the three locations
they're in sunrise on university just north of sunrise boulevard they're in a north Miami beach
and now the new location is open in Oakland Park a half mile west of us one that's an Oakland Park
boulevard did you get that okay now the weather is partly cloudy slight chance of rain
high today and tomorrow near 80 and low tonight near 70 now this is the kind of morning new alike 72
degrees outside why is that because it's nice and nice and warm yeah I'm gonna go outside and do
the show okay on the lawn that would be original maybe on Monday we ought to do that when the kids
are out here although he promises big day of his threatened to come by here I invited him to be
one of the judges and he's threatened to come by around eight thirty which means he doesn't have
to get up at four thirty in the morning to be here and I thought we'd all just kind of sit here
inside an ogle and ogle because when they can't see us and we can see then there's something
voyeuristic I know they can't see you through that window but your Jimmy Swaggart would like to be
your judge too huh I got a couple of bibs you know but you know what they say judge not less
DB judge isn't that what they say yeah that's right that's what the Lord said the big day
prefers you know getting up at four thirty I'm telling you you better do the weather okay because
we don't have time to mess around today okay you already did it remember I said I always
swear you said it's 72 but you didn't say it 607 on Zeta 4 we do that's incredible it's a
six oh nine I'm Zeta 4 that really is shocking to be honest with you it is you stole it from a
who's stolen who got that I stole something from the lawyer's office yeah no I don't think I
stole anything okay now what what have you got there is that something important oh I was just
reading this nice ladies letter and I like the stationery says I'm 40 at the top and at the
bottom and damn proud of it talking on the air with a mouthful of food also known as pig radio
doesn't make it just as it doesn't make it off the air you're cackling sidekick who cackles at
everything whether it's funny or not doesn't make it being rude to callers who may not be quite
as interesting as you'd like doesn't make it calling the cacklers reading from the life section
of USA today news as an insult to all legitimate news journalist and doesn't make it listen to
caller after caller tell you how great you are doesn't make it and is boring calling your
competitors names on the air when they can't respond to you don't really doesn't make it but is
cowardly quite frankly if you were in a market with any sophistication like Boston or New York
issue wouldn't make it they'd be fighting it out for last place with the motivation station right
Steve Cain spelled C.A.I.N. as in Cain and Unable has challenged you on a number of occasions to go
on head to head with them on the air I know you think issue oriented programming sucks but why don't
you take him up on it it could make for some great radio and if things got a little tough you could
always start cackling science Susan Martin in Fort Lauderdale shut it dumb douche bag okay
incredibly dumb what a miserable bitch why does she listen is yes I'll be interested to see if
listen to this I'll be interesting to see now so you know what you're dealing with a road scholar
like Susan this great I'll be interesting to see if you have the balls to read this letter over
the air I don't think you will but perhaps some of these other guys with the low ratings might
it will only take a couple of them to reach an audience the size of yours although it won't be
filled with little boys from Cooper City high school boy boy carbon copy Steve Cain Paul Isle
Joy Reynolds Greg B.D.L. and Jeff Charles let's hear it we got a real douche bag you dumb bitch
she's probably not away from it you know here she's listening right are you kidding me she
wouldn't miss the show she gets sexual excitement from this show not a word she's got one of those
vibrator radios oh my god it's incredible fact if you knew where all of us were right now
I like it oh I feel like I'm being sucked into the grand canyon ladies and gentlemen this is good
it's 11 past six on Zeta 4 or something very close to that size anyway we do have unlines to
love it and Broward because it was flashing in captain day was very busy eating 7779 3600 now
there will be no food coming in here today okay under any circumstances not even no unless
of course Susan stops by with some goodies for us oh yeah we'll welcome her now what when he's
talking over in the corner what is his microphone sound like I'm on acid or something it's like it's
flashing from left right is your microphone that's what it does in my ears too yeah it's all right I'm
doing anything wrong see he noticed it too it's like sometimes you're in the left channel
exactly no I'm watching that's what I was talking about that there's no problem watching the
view meter both needles are moving identically okay I think you have a needle problem
there but I don't think it's on the board well isn't it funny that he noticed it too well like I said
words of a feather inject together it's 12 minutes after six on Zeta 4 let's take our first call
in beautiful date county hello beautiful day county how are you not too bad yourself pretty good now
is this Susan Martin by any chance are you kidding I'm just not just not just
is crude and rude is that is not incredible it's like that's so uncool and talk about childish she's
sending it to all these other people so they'll read it out yeah it's like so ridiculous if you want
to say something like that why don't you just call up and say it to you or just like go in there and
say look dude yeah like wow yeah right anyway I just wanted to know he just will not answer that
last liner you know there's something about him this morning it's not a big deal but he just
refuses to answer the hell it's not your lights up your what your lights out it's blinking okay we
figured it out see when you just come and hold hold on a second hold on a second Zeta all right
Dave come on okay hold on oh we'll see that's why Susan was that you think that was Susan I hope so
okay that's what a light's not blinking you believe that oh my god yeah I think her lights went out
long time ago so what's up this morning not much I just want to ask a question what do you think
is going to happen to this robber w walker after he testifies and all those goodies I don't know
anything about a while they're going through that license thing now over there oh that's not pay
all a deal oh still no it never really stone and everything and it's like they got they got one
company that wants to get one hundred off the air and everything and they're creating whole big
scandal and each a cocaine or whatever to play the records and stuff well I don't know what's
going to happen but I do hope that they stay on the air because I like stations that have 10-year-old
program directors oh god damn yeah can I sniff a little vixen piece here what do you have to
satisfy I mean he's injecting in there and he's a sniffing airplane glue can I do a little vix
at least it's illegal substance anyway I'm sorry I also Robert Walker's a friend of mine oh he's
another one yeah and we go way back oh do you and I hope that everything works out for him over there
he's been there for a while yeah so I remember when I first moved down here about 78 or so
my dad he was on the radio oh sure yeah he's been here a long time oh yeah anyway I just want
to know your opinion because it's like a lot of people are saying wow this guy's going to get
this guy's going to get well it would be easy for us to take cheap shots but we don't do that
mm-hmm oh I know yeah sure unless Susan is involved okay of course okay listen have a great day
see you later wait wait six 14 on zeta four we have an open line in date county where uh
Susan is trying desperately to get through from brow and at six in fact Susan can call us collect
on the day line okay six two oh thirty six hundred because we know that Susan's listening right now

Craig or Billy Martin or Billy Martin probably Billy Martin mm-hmm yeah she probably hangs out of
the bars with Billy see now Davis in my left ear at this very moment I could not he's not saying

that isn't going to take you like an hour and a half or something like that but that's okay

Bruce Singer over on the beach you want me to sit here and show and lie to the pubic okay and I
can't do that Ron nobody's asking you to lie but we're not asking to knock him either we're trying
to make this a professional down yeah what do you mean a professional town I mean we only have

some back so he's not buying any spots but he has given us a little publicity there and all
those are six people who call his weather a thing oh everybody call what did he say it cost 249
what kind of an interesting number is that to call the party line so those of you out there in
Halendale and Miami Beach you spend a lot of time on the party might as well be talking to somebody
while you're doing it right isn't that what that line's all about yeah I don't want to burst your
bubble but 6 30 estimate testing sound effects on that line 6 35 on Zeta 4 should I do a tropical

now Cooper City high we hope you don't let us down it would be embarrassing if we all sat around
here salivating and drooling we have to invite Susan to be one of the judges that day huh great
I think Susan's probably real horny that's why she wrote this nasty letter especially the part
about the little boys at Cooper City high do you believe that there are no little boys Susan
out of get together with my mother and they can talk about what a little boy Bob is okay I know
Bob's listing this morning and believe me there are a lot of us Bob and oh you know little boy okay

great listen I know that you guys are airplane the movie airplane fan yeah and I just wanted to
let you guys know that the same fellow who wrote that movie airplane did for a short time a TV
show called police squad yeah yeah it was on the on the air for a while they took it off because
nobody seemed to understand the side gags or anything like that was a little bit too esoteric for
the American public the dimension well good news is that the other night I know you sleep go to
sleep real early but on a and e on Sunday night I see what they're showing the replay so if you
have a video to set player something you might want to tape it of what what's it police squad oh it
really yeah they have it on the late Sunday night so I'm in plantation I get American cable too
and on a and e right on Sunday night I don't exactly remember what time but it's about 11 or 11 30
great they play those police squad episodes and I just thought you guys might play you know aren't
there only like six of those though there's about six or eight of them but let me tell you something
they're great every time you watch and you see something else in the background that you missed the
first time it's just hysterical I think you can rent that also yeah I think you can't
be the never been funny or that yeah he was he was funny in the airplane oh he was a
police squad is funny too the other thing about that guy run from Miami with a basketball yeah I
would understand what his problem is you know let's listen if he can't stand the heady ought to get
out of the kitchen we've got some of the best shuffle board players in the world down here and if
you can't get into it he ought to get out exactly all right listen have a good day guys thanks a lot bye bye
I don't you think of the movie airplane when you think of this Joe Johnson's listing this morning
next time you introduce this record you can say from the movie airplane it's the BDs but isn't it
Saturday night fever theme not this it's the theme it's not this song is it I don't think so
isn't that the song that comes on a jukebox yeah isn't a woman yeah yeah it's not the night fever
like I said it was this one and the other one okay we just we just broke a rule on Zeta 4 we played
the same song or parts of it twice in the same our ladies and gentlemen and we apologize we're

what's that why do you mean what was that that's a little talk to the anniversary greeting that came
for the bag boys at Pueblox really I think we made that up I didn't know anything about it we
wouldn't want to disappoint Susan would we Susan Martin in Fort Lauderdale at the douche bag
mm-hmm it was all upset about those little boys at Cooper City High that's right oh little boys at
Cooper City High they're a big boys how you doing big boy happy and 12th anniversary from the
bag boys at public I mentioned Jason's on here too yeah happy 12th anniversary Neil yeah I'm a
bag boy and my name is Jason okay moving right along isn't Jason starring in that movie with
sheer mask let's go to Hollywood next hello oh how you doing yes sir yeah if I have a great
topic for you okay you ever work with scouts boy scouts no I'm afraid I have it sir but it's
certainly something to think about isn't it yeah well there was a newspaper how they made
do you ever see a grown man stark naked yeah yeah do you ever hang around the locker room
huh no do you ever watch movies about Roman gladiates yeah gladiates I've got mentioned airplay
before just talking go ahead I know they had a newspaper how they're making it's legal to have
female scout masters no how females can be in charge of boys from 10 years old to 18 years old
yeah well I think that may be a good idea how do you join big day wants to know how you join
yeah how do you join well I don't think it's legal because I think a man I think a boy needs a male
role model you agree with that yeah that's why they ought to have some of those butch women
be the scot masters okay well if you ever look at the 10 leaders the cubs guts and back what they
look like yeah that's true yeah it's like a requirement you have to weigh over 400 pounds you got it
so anyways I think you guys are great and you know you know you should do look up that rating a foam
bump great common name though don't you think Susan Martin I think there might be a few of them
for Lauderdale yeah okay listen have a great day okay you too I'm down burn high what's that
down burn high okay see you later yeah south bro out high that's the one on is that on what street

century village east a large condominium complex that caterers primarily to retiree to old
farts but the board of directors at the building he planned to move into rejected him as a winner
saying his blindness might present problems to other residents yeah Michael Jackson

degree of humane letters from Nashville's Fisk University Fisk University FISK for his support of
the United Negro College Fund this week he donated $600,000 to UNCF from a concert he gave at
New York City's Madison Square Garden the last emperor and moon struck our even money picks

doesn't understand most of the material not a guy who does the takeoff on more downy junior
Chris Elliott Chris Elliott Jr. with all those ugly pseudo bumps out of space now he's he was on

No.
In fact, I saw it again last night.

You just really can't concentrate on what he's saying.
Because he's such a jerk.
He says power 96 makes me wild.

You guys all done over there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, you needed to buy one.
Nope.
Yep.
I've been Apple Adam.
I'm going to hold this bike
guy's wearing a skin as they drove my coat.
I'm gonna try to distract us to get the audience
tuning over to Joey or something.
But you guys are still doing pretty good.
Can say I by waking congratulations on the travel show
and the plant show on the weekend.
Are you guys are really doing it?
The total traveler.
Yeah, one of the collaters changing to KAT.
Anyway, that's Mike Will from our sister's day,
sister-relaw station up there at the other end
of the building to dying 8am.
It's 10.07 on Zeta 4 and laugh now and we played our mic.
Do you mean by sure it's in 7.02?
Well, it should have been nice having Captain Dave with us
earlier in the show when he was shaking to it
and have a great weekend.
Gonji's next.
Your hair looks great.
And my hair does look great.
I certainly hope so and we're gonna.
And isn't it ashamed that we can't take pictures
with my hair looking like this,
but we have a lot of other important things to do.
Yeah, and it just isn't gonna work out.
And that's what that's what's gonna happen every time they make
these. See, I was told it was a week from today,
which I'm sure I could have arranged my life around that.
But then you came up with a couple of other dates
that they for some peculiar reason ignored.
Ignored.
So we're just gonna go ahead and live our lives
and looking to the fullest and ignore them, right?
Yeah, we shine us.
We shine them.
Tit for tat and all that other good stuff.
Nobody you doing.
Am I not gonna place something in here?
That's a low hot Friday.
He's wearing his low hot shirt again.
I don't care now because it's not a low hot Friday.
I wonder if Ed has got any final comments here.
But I don't have a copy of it now I do
because I did take the show.
Thank you very much for playing that.
Okay.
It's all nice to hear from you, Ed.
It's always pleasure to do a business with you.
Now that will continue on Monday, right?
To be continued.
