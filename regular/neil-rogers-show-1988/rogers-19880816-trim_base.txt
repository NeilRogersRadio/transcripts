Right. What a guy. 914. It's Ernie Soach and Junior ladies and gentlemen.
Unbelievably, we're just setting like radio history here today.
Unbelievably. And now we're up to M with our bits. Are you ready for the M?
I'm ready. Okay, here it is.
So Vester Stallone stars in his most...
915 on the Neil Rogers show in Zeta 4 now. Oh yeah. Yeah, it's time for our mystery record.
Oh, isn't done this in a couple of hours because the phones have been so darn busy.
But finally we have a little reprieve and this is the one you want to guess. Here we go.
What? What? What happened? You didn't push the right button. It's okay. Now here are the numbers.
If you want to guess on this, 620 3600, did...
Yeah, why don't you... why don't you guess without listening? That'd be 7779 3600,
empowered. If you think you know what this is. Wow. Now you're going to have to do it again,
but that was great. Okay, that's the mystery sound. Remember, you don't win anything.
Just have the fun of playing along with this here on the little game. Here it is.
Whoa, it gave a little too much for you John. Yeah, yeah, a little extra hint there for everybody. I think...
But look at that. Look, every line lights up. Can you believe it? Every line lights up.
Well, they're anxious to win nothing. Hi.
There's people out in the hall looking through the window at us, you know.
Yeah, they're anxious to win nothing, so we're more than happy to accommodate from this morning.
Let's take some guesses to see if anybody knows what it is. Hi, Broward.
Oh, you have to push the button. Oh, hello.
There's nobody there. Are you there? Hello? Broward?
I love you. Who is this?
Do I know you? I do. You're kidding. I swear.
This isn't Patty, is it? Oh, not Patty. You want a guess, John?
Oh, I couldn't put it on the radio. Yeah, all right. Bye.
Yeah.
Dave County.
That's strange, Broward. Dave County, hi.
What was that? What was what?
That last caller?
Yeah.
Well, they all come out of the woodwork when Neil's not here.
It's part of the fun, you know. Well, anyway, it couldn't be Kenny Lagan's.
No, it's not Kenny Lagan's.
I didn't think you would play Kenny Lagan's, that's why.
Well, you never know with Johnny.
Yeah, I'm sure.
And there's no pattern, you know.
Okay, I'll try again.
Bye.
Oh, rhyme, no reason.
That's it.
Dave County.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
Yeah, I got a guess for the song.
Okay.
How about Bad Company?
No.
Not bad company.
Oh, okay.
Not even good company.
Thanks.
All right.
Bye.
Broward.
Hey, bro.
Hey.
This is Bob Rand.
I want to hear Bob Rand.
You want to hear Bob, Bob Rand?
Yes, sir.
We'll see what we can do.
You guys complain if you want to.
Uh-huh.
All right.
You guys are trying to get through.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, we'd go good.
Yeah, all right.
We'll see what we can do.
You want to guess on the song?
Huh?
You want to guess on the song?
The song that you just played?
Yeah, the little mystery song?
Um, no.
I haven't got that.
That's okay.
There's no clue.
All right.
Hey, I'm going to rip you guys.
You're going to play it.
I will see if you can.
All right.
You're okay.
Okay.
All right.
Dave County.
Hello.
This is Broward County.
Well, I'm sorry.
How you doing today?
Yeah, how you doing?
Okay.
Is it spinning wheel?
Is it spinning wheel?
No.
No.
I'm about to turn gears.
Is it, John?
No.
Not by BSNT.
All right.
What are they?
Sure.
It's a pure dark over there.
I'm sorry.
They're starting to learn about you.
See, 6203600 in date and at 77793600 in Broward.
And I'm sure you've got it.
Should I give them one more taste of it?
Yeah.
Will you hand me that news at USA Today
underneath the cart over there, the cap and Dave put there?
And so I'm going to do the 920 updates
so you don't have to mess with that.
No.
Oh, unless you want to.
Unless you specifically want to.
We're going to be your classic.
Yeah, it could be.
You're absolutely right.
Broward County.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Glenn.
Yeah.
Hi.
This is Lynn.
Hi, Lynn.
First time caller.
Uh-huh.
Loyal Zadol listener.
Good to hear from you.
How come you never call the needles here?
I try to, but I most times I can't get through.
Uh-huh.
I just wanted to see.
Do me a favor.
What's that?
I like you to call my boyfriend a douchebag.
Yesterday was his birthday.
She can't.
Glenn can't call somebody a douchebag.
Now I can't do that.
You know, that's Neal's thing.
And Dave isn't here to tell him to go to hell.
So.
He can tell him to go to hell.
Do that.
Well, why don't you do it?
You know, he, you know, why don't you do it?
No?
Yesterday was his birthday?
Yeah.
Wow.
Well, happy birthday.
Thank you.
OK.
OK.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Broward?
I guess it's not.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Oh, hi.
Hey, you're on the air.
Oh, OK.
Is it Cecilia?
No.
It's not Cecilia.
Oh, well.
OK, thanks.
Uh-huh.
Dave?
I smoke a sass press.
Hot smoking sass press by the bubble puppy.
Good guess, don't you think?
That's a good guess, no one.
Nobody's going to get that with that short of a thing.
There's no way in the world.
Well, that's sort of a thing.
Well, we can make it a little bit longer thing.
Nobody's going to get that.
I'm telling you.
Well, I haven't given us an extra little hint.
OK.
Bye-bye.
You can do that before they guess some more.
Let's listen to it one more time.
Now, you should be able to get it from that.
I think, I think that's fair.
Brenda Richie, wife of singer Lionel Richie,
was warned by a district attorney's administrator yesterday
to stay away from her husband's lady friend.
Oh, hi.
Diane Alexander.
She beat up on it.
That's right.
Remember that?
They had the big battle, Brenda Richie and Diana Alexander.
I don't know what the problem was.
He was only messing around with this other woman.
It doesn't.
Following a morning hearing with Alexander
and an afternoon session with Brenda Richie,
Officer Kay Kerr-Trail said she could not
assess blame for that June 29th battle
between the two women that also involved Lionel.
She said she could not recommend pressing charges.
Brenda Richie has been charged with
vandalism, resisting arrest,
disturbing the peace,
and corporal abuse of a spouse
because she had no cooperation
from the one witness Lionel Richie.
Richie did not attend that session with his wife
as was expected,
and the officer says he does not want to press charges
against his wife.
This is like, this is better than days of our lives.
And it's real.
And it's, it is real.
So no charges on Brenda Richie.
And I'm sure there'll be more to this story
and we'll keep you up to date on it.
922, we'll be right back with more of your guesses.
Since 925 on Zeta 4,
Captain Davis has gone to Gerber's to get us some food to eat.
So we're going to eat in the last half hour
before the end of the show because you people have gone through
with the trolls.
It's needles being gone.
We haven't really been eating on the air.
J. America's brought us some bagels,
but I mean, we're going to really,
we're going to get into chicken subs and stuff, John.
It's going to be great.
All right, let's take it.
We've got a full board of calls.
So let's take some.
Wait a minute.
What?
Just so they don't know.
Oh, okay.
Now you should be able to get that.
I'm real serious.
With that hint,
you should be able to get that.
So let's see if anybody,
let me push this button myself.
And we'll go to date county.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
Yeah, is it ELO?
No, no.
How about foreigner?
No, it's going to go down the alphabet.
No, no.
All right.
Yeah, we're doing the alphabet on the bit.
Hello.
Yeah, we're going to get you the magical tune here.
I want to go out and live on this,
when you're a bit of a miracle,
the beautiful.
Excellent, Kess.
I think you're going to make it.
Bye-bye.
Great, Kess.
Date county.
We like those kind of guests.
That's right.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
Is it this town?
No, not the stones.
Oh, this is a real tough one.
Is it?
Yeah.
All right.
Sorry.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Broward.
Yeah.
Hello.
Hi.
How you doing?
Good.
What's up?
Keeping busy?
Oh, yeah.
Now you want to guess on this song?
I know, but I got some notes to say.
Okay.
You know, I heard that Lana Richie's wife
is taking lessons from Sean Penn.
You know, I hadn't thought about it that way.
Yeah, which one is more violent?
Uh, they haven't decided yet.
I think it's a tie.
Yeah.
Did you hear that story yesterday that Madonna's brother
is more violent than Sean Penn?
Yeah, I heard that.
That's incredible.
I'll look to food is here.
Food is here, sir.
We got to go.
Okay.
Bye.
Broward.
No, that's not it.
Good guess.
Broward.
Yes.
Hi.
This is, uh,
this is someone guess the song yet?
Not yet.
All right.
I got to guess.
Okay.
I'm off to guess who I can't explain.
No.
Uh, sorry.
Sorry.
Thank you, man.
Nobody.
Dave, you're on the air.
Hello.
Yeah.
Hi.
How you doing?
Okay.
I want to guess that song.
Okay.
Is it the James Bond theme song?
Nope.
No.
That's not yet.
All right.
All right.
Thank you.
Dave.
Hi.
I'd like to guess on this song.
Okay.
Um, positive, fourth treat?
No.
Good guess, but no.
Yeah, it kind of starts the same way.
Yeah.
Thanks for trying.
It's a good cheer about Dave County.
I got a guess on the song.
All right.
How about Sammy Davis Jr.?
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Mr. Candyman?
Yeah.
That's a cool.
Oh, wow.
Potato chips.
Look at this.
That's a cool.
Oh, my god.
Yeah, maybe we even got us potato chips.
Look at the size of those suckers.
Yeah, these are huge.
I can't believe it.
See you later.
All right.
You put a lot of salt on mine, right?
Yeah, right.
Broward, hi.
Yeah, is that all of the beach boys?
Beach boys?
No.
No.
Oh, sorry.
Broward.
Hey, how about magical mystery tour?
No.
All right.
This is Bob again.
I'm trying hard.
Keep trying, Bob.
No, we're going to stop this one.
I got to go to doctors for medication.
That's my problem.
But, uh, you know, let's tell our bitches
the very to hatch it.
Oh.
You know what I'm saying?
OK.
Is that fair?
I guess.
Whatever you say.
Yeah, whatever you say today.
Um, let's.
Yeah.
Broward, hi.
That's sick.
Sticks?
No.
It's not sticks, is it, John?
What's this?
No.
Oh, thanks.
Great.
Absolutely amazing.
Yeah.
You know what?
I'll give that little thing time too.
I'll just just walk you this into it one more time.
OK.
Yeah.
Because I just, um,
oh boy, he got a lot.
Go through that time.
Way too much now.
I think if you really, you know,
really rack your brain,
you'll get that one.
Date County, hi.
Howdy.
How about feel that make love?
No.
Nope.
Side it.
Date County.
Hello.
Yeah, I was going to guess the same thing we discussed.
Man, sorry.
You what?
Oh, someone already guessed it?
OK.
Date County.
Hi.
Oops.
Let's go to Broward.
You're on the air.
Yeah.
Is it the beetle?
Is it the beetle?
It is not the beetles.
Yeah, I'm not sure.
How about the the rottedger?
No.
OK.
Broward.
Hi.
Yeah, how about Michael Jackson?
No, Michael, it's not Michael Jackson.
Now, would I do the beetles?
You play a lot of Michael Jackson.
Would I do the beetles?
OK, I'll try again later.
OK, would I do the beetles or Michael Jackson
or anybody that's known?
It would have to be somebody who's, you know,
totally unknown.
Right, you got to consider the source.
You must consider the source.
Broward, hi, you're on the air.
I think the group is by the name of Can't Heat
and I think the title of it is going up the country.
What did he say?
Let's work together.
Boy, you're real close.
Oh boy.
You're real close.
Yeah.
But you got a half a star for that.
Yeah.
So you tell him if he's got the title or the artist correct,
will you go that far?
I think I got the artist Can't Heat, but I, you know,
they only had two or three hits and good Lord knows
which one it was.
No, you have the wrong artist.
Wrong artist.
But let's work together is the right title.
You got a half a star.
All right, so we're going to go and try to see
if we can get the artist, OK?
Thank you, sir.
Thanks very much.
All right, it's let's work together.
I know.
I know.
Is the Gonson.
Gonson.
I know.
Hi, Dave County.
Yeah, Jackson Brown running on empty.
No, no, not paying attention.
Whoops.
Dave, hi.
Yeah, how about Bob Dylan, rainy day women,
number 12 and 35?
Yeah, it would be a great record for the day,
but it's not yet.
It's not yet.
All right.
All right, we found out the title.
Let me look up words together.
Let me see if I can, let me see if I, boy, this is, you know,
hard on me.
But let me see if I can see it in the book here.
This is it.
Nobody's going to get the artist.
The artist is a one hit one here.
You're still doing this song?
I know.
Can you believe it?
We started it at the time.
She was making the song.
No, I don't know who the artist is either.
We'll go through one more rack here of callers and then
forget it.
Broward.
Hi, you're on the air.
OK, is it Chicago?
No, no.
Sorry.
Broward, you're on the air.
Yeah, it's the chipmunks.
Chipmunks.
Excellent, yes, sir.
Let's work together by the chipmunks.
We'll get the guns in here to tell us who it is.
Broward?
Hi.
Hello.
My name's Aaron.
Yeah, you are on the air.
OK.
My wife's been telling me about it.
She played a few days ago with Mr. Ed.
She said it was an absolute riot.
Oh, my boss is a jerk.
A jerk, a jerk.
Yeah, yeah.
Can you play that?
Not today, but I'll pass Dan already.
Yeah, we'll read it in.
You just missed it.
Oh, no.
Now I tell you what, pal.
I won't do it today, but I'll be glad to do it later this week.
I'll play it for you like tomorrow.
Give me a call.
Let me know when you're going to play it.
Or you can give me a call and remind me,
and I'll play it for you then, OK?
You'll personally call you at home, sir.
Why don't you give me a call back and remind me
and I'll play it for you tomorrow.
OK, good.
All right.
All right.
Dade County.
I know Don Kuger.
No.
No.
You're kidding.
No.
I'm like little ditty.
Oh, well.
Again.
Good guest considering yesterday.
Bye-bye.
OK, bye.
Dade.
I've got it.
OK.
It's piggy-wee love.
It's a good show.
Dade County.
Hello.
Yeah.
OK.
Listen here.
I haven't listened to you guys for quite a while now.
And you can't really picture.
Are you guys looking?
That's right.
You're lucky.
Why is that?
Well, trust us.
OK.
So what's your point?
Could you just like just about tell me what Neil looks like?
I picture him like a little ball-ball man.
No, he's not bald.
No.
Mm-hmm.
Really?
He's a little roton.
Roton.
Just a touch.
Yeah.
Just a hair.
But he's not bald.
And he's not a little old man.
No, he doesn't look old at all.
I've never seen you guys.
Now, the best thing for this guy to do
is he's right in for a photo, right?
Well, I tell you what, if you'll write me a postcard
or a letter and ask me to send you a picture, I'll do it.
And then he'll know.
Then he'll know.
Yes, I will.
All right, you bet.
I'll do it.
OK.
Have they guessed the phone yet?
No.
But the J-Galb man.
It's not J-Galb.
Sorry.
See you later.
All right, we're going to have to tell him, I guess,
or Gonser.
Yeah, Gonser.
Can I call me Tom?
Yeah.
Can't heat.
No, it's not.
I know.
Wilbur Harrison.
That's him.
Oh, well.
Hey, we've got another winner.
Yes, and our winner this hour is Jeff Gonser.
Yeah.
If I win an Eagle Brand potato chip.
Yeah.
Exactly.
How do you have a story about Wilbur Harrison?
Yeah, want to talk about that?
Well, that was a medley of his hit.
That's right.
No, Kansas City was a big hit.
You're right.
Yeah.
In 1959.
Let's work together.
Part one is 69.
And how high in the country?
32.
That's a smash.
Went up to 32.
And he did play it.
And it did get a extensive AOR play in the early 70s.
That's right.
That's right.
It's one of those you just don't hear anymore.
And when you hear it, you'll know why.
Now, this is great.
It's on on Zeta 4.
Together we will stand.
I didn't hear a phone.
Come on, not be bold.
Let's get on the phone and work together.
Come on, come on, let's work together.
Now, not be bold.
Say now together we will stand.
And how we've been AOR playin'
We spoke a lot And we came together We spoke a lot
And we came to get a much brighter than it could be.
And I didn't hear a phone.
Run to arrangements against all of you
I'm playing it.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, look at that.
You don't think it's enough?
We don't have any idea.
Yeah.
So get to me.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Wilbert Harrison, let's work together.
1969 hit and nobody got it.
Do you stump them again, John?
You seem to stump them one time each day.
They got the title.
They got the title.
That's very good, too.
But who could, you know, who could forget Wilbert Harrison?
He did Kansas City.
Yeah, everybody remembers.
I mean, that's a great song.
I remember can he doing it, but you got it.
It's probably about half a second of it.
Then I was going to win it.
Do you have a problem with that?
I think Joseph Gubbles did that in 1930s.
Not Germany.
That was only 1969.
It wasn't that sub-head.
937 now in the Neal Roger Show in Zeta.
We're going to do this.
And then, Johnny, what are we going to do?
We're going to do stuff here.
Yeah, 935 stuff at 937.
Okay, and then we're going to do in.
Ten years from now, Hong Kong will be returned to the Chinese.
The US leaks on the Panama Canal will have just expired.
But owners of the new 100-200 series Audi's
will still be enjoying the Audi advantage.
That's because the Audi advantage offers a full decade
of corrosion protection.
Ten full years.
The Audi advantage also offers three years or 50,000 miles
where Audi assumes all scheduled maintenance costs,
a guaranteed resale index that certifies trade-in value,
and even more restrictions apply.
But your dealer can provide details for the program
and the corrosion-perforation limited warranty.
So, think about it.
Ten years from now, you could be congratulating yourself
on having bought an Audi.
Or asking yourself why you took the risk of buying anything else.
Find out more about the Audi advantage.
On Tuesday, now let's do this, and then I'll do this, John.
Let's play in, and then I'll be back, and I'll tell you what,
what's special about Tuesday.
Yeah, I think it is, too.
Alan Box was a normal man with a wife, children,
a summer home in Opalaka, and a chain of radio stations.
Well, normal that is until just three weeks ago.
Hi, honey, how was your day?
Un...
Believable.
Terminal!
There's nothing but subhuman douchebags out there.
Alan Box is suffering from Neal Rogers disease.
Have you canceled the Miami Herald yet?
But honey, we don't subscribe to the Herald.
Oh, now that's a cop-out.
What kind of a lame excuse is that?
Just say no to Elle Herald, sir.
Huh?
People afflicted with Neal Rogers disease
have lost the ability to communicate like normal human beings.
What's the matter with you?
Blue-haired old bags from Fembroke Pines.
You know, the Yen-Fen, so say, all Neal!
How can you say those nasty things?
Running around stealing sweet and low.
Can I get you anything?
How about those bag boys at Windixi?
You know, it doesn't hurt to look.
In...

We are eating chicken subs from Gerber's.
Oh boy, they're good.
We wanted to thank who, Ann.
And they're delicious.
I am.
They're the most amazing subs I've ever had in my life.
Johnny Dark has never had one before and he just...
Yeah, I hear you guys talking about Gerber's all the time and I couldn't believe it.
Flip down.
No, this man just flipped down.
I bit into that pepper and I knew the meaning of life.
So good.
Hi, Miami.
Hello.
Is this Neal Rogers disease?
Yes it is.
You're on the air.
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
I'm the first time college.
Are you really?
How come you never call with Neal's here?
I was always working.
You're not working today and stuff?
I'm off today.
Oh, great.
You guys are funny, man.
We're all thanks.
Oh, good.
Well, I'm glad you called.
This is kind of a funny show, isn't it?
Yeah, it is all amusing sometimes, isn't it?
Yeah, I was getting some stuff on the show.
Yeah, every now and again, we sure do.
We're eating chicken subs today.
Stubbs for breakfast?
Mm-hmm.
So make you feel at home.
They're outrageous.
I want to eat chicken subs already.
Well, I tell you, if you get up at the time we get up,
by this time you're ready for lunch, trust me.
What time you get up?
Before five.
Before five clock?
Yeah, 4.30 or 5.
Oh, really?
Whoa, we're just gone crazy here.
Wait a minute.
All right, anything else?
Are you guys playing any Led Zeppelin?
No, right.
Not today.
Why not?
Well, we're just not in the mood today.
It's probably a long version of Starway to Heaven.
I heard Starway to Heaven yesterday on Zeta.
Did you miss it?
I heard it yesterday about five o'clock.
I will.
Yeah, did you miss it?
Yeah.
I heard it then too.
I was driving home.
Yeah, I heard it.
See, we heard it yesterday.
So we can't play it today.
I was driving home from Rob's studio.
Too long.
We can't play that on a morning show.
But I'll play something else for you, okay?
All right.
Okay, this is just for him.
And this is...
That was a dude.
Yeah.
That was a dude call.
Yeah, dude.
Well, here's O for that dude.
Here we come.
Shuffle down the street.
We gather use these markers.
Cause we gather you besties.
Hey, Harry, for old monkeys.
That's you, dog.
Wanna show?
Oh, yeah.
That's you, dog.
That's you, dog.
That's you, dog.
That's you, dog.
That's you, dog.
That's you, dog.
That's you, dog.
I don't want any feels here.
It's just so dull and tiring.
It's all the same.
Free that Darth Hіgcheerful first...
It's even better that you don't have to, Jack.
Well, am I your uncle's sex ninja?

Yeah, just love me.
If somebody wants to remember that.
and everything goes away.
Now did it run on there?
Everything ran on there.
Everything's fine.
We couldn't hear anything in here.
What did button did you hit?
The solo button.
Well, don't push anymore, okay?
I didn't.
Okay. See what happens when we get food in here, kids?
It was a mistake.
All right.
A mistake.
Okay.
Well, you freak me out.
Well, when, you know, I know it's crazy, Dave,
but when everything goes away,
when you're sitting here,
I don't know why I freak out,
but when the entire program goes off the air,
you didn't go off the air.
No, no problem.
Well, I didn't know that though, it went off here.
I didn't know that.
We're trying to solve monkeys on the radio.
Okay. Well, I think it's pretty incredible,
on your day, that we're already already to O and P.
And we started today at six o'clock this morning,
and here it is 9.45 and we're at P.
Well, we can get rid of OP by playing
when there's any Griffith ones again.
No, I got an OP.
I see.
I see he did study that show.
Shall we take a couple more calls before we,
before we, we push that button.
We talked about battle.
Okay.
Oh, man.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Hi.
One just a heart.
How are you?
I'm fine.
What's up today?
Okay, I was calling to ask you.
I can't either struggling.
We're struggling.
You can tell in the nerve voices.
Okay, also I wanted to ask David.
Yes.
Has anybody ever walked up to him and called him Machi?
Yeah, about twice a day.
Twice a day?
What does that mean?
No, that's a private term used among a small group of people.
Uh-huh, and it means what?
It means happy.
Oh, it does.
I've never heard that before.
Yeah.
I've never heard that before.
Yeah, are you a happy person?
No.
You're not?
What's wrong?
I have a lot of happy friends though.
Oh, this is that bitch that called about a week ago.
What?
Do you hear what he called you?
I heard what he called me.
No one that calls and said I like to laugh and he called me that.
Oh, and then I got you confused with somebody else.
I sure hope not.
Good.
Good Lord.
But anyway, I'm the one that also calls when you guys are there alone, when nails are not
there because I can never get through with nails there.
Yeah, a lot of people say that.
I thought I wanted to get through when he's there either.
Uh-oh.
Well, we're glad you're listening anyway.
Yeah, well, can I say hi to my cousin, Cuz.
Sure.
Hi Cuz.
All right.
See you later.
Bye.
I don't know about that call.
I think it was that same drill.
Really?
Yeah.
We have time just to take a...
Whoops.
Fort Lauderdale hung up.
Have you could have seen when I hit that dial tone and kept the...
Oh, I remember you brought up that a hard time.
He almost hit the ceiling.
My left ear was still out.
It was just amazing.
Miami, North Miami.
Hello.
Glad.
Yeah, hi.
How you doing?
Okay.
We ran into that bit with the puse, uh, the yellow swimmer or he was swimming in.
You know, we found that yesterday.
Johnny and I were alphabetizing and cleaning out the bits.
Yeah.
And we will play it one day this week.
I don't have time.
It's very long.
Yeah, it's been long.
Yeah, we had lost that since last summer.
I don't know what that is.
Yeah, Dave doesn't even know what it is.
That thing about Frank Sinatra, that's what you're talking about, right?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I will play it before Neil comes back.
I'll play it one day this week, okay?
Oh, tie.
All right.
Very interesting suggestion.
And it really was.
948 and we have a call from Cooper City, Dave.
Hello.
Hello, Cooper City.
It's not on.
Yeah, how you doing, guys?
He's here.
How you doing?
All right.
What's up?
What?
Hello?
This is the lead zappling guy.
Are you the lead zappling guy?
Yeah.
And we want now.
This is saying hi again.
Yeah, well, go, go to hell.
Good, man.
What's going on here?
All these airheads are calling them.
I know.
As soon as you brought the food in, everything was great until you brought the food.
Hey, man.
How you doing?
Well, no more of those.
Get ready for the news and I'll talk about it.
That's that gentleman, man.
It is Tuesday night.
Like I started to say a few minutes ago and that means it's lobster night at shells tonight.
That's right.
It's lobster night at shells every Tuesday night.
Live, one and a quarter pound live, main lobsters.
Now they have just boarded the morning Delta airline flight out of Banger.
And they're scheduled to land a Miami International Airport later this afternoon.
Do you know what time kept the day?
Are you going to meet them or anything?
Well, they don't have to go through customs.
Now, shells are starting to prepare for their arrival and they'll serve them steaming hot to your table tonight.
And you're not going to believe this only 9.95 and you get parsely potatoes and just a little lettuce.
But it's a couple of leaves.
Okay.
Now these are full one and a quarter pound main lobsters.
Not those small one pound chicken lobsters.
Full one and a quarter pound lobsters that were swimming in the Atlantic this morning.
And they'll be served steaming to your table tonight or the unbelievable price of 9.95.
Shells turns every Tuesday into a nightly shell liberation.
That's what it says with one and a quarter pound main lobsters for only 9.95.
They have locations all over Dayton, Broward there and now open in Coconut Creek at the corner of coconut creek Parkway and Lions Road.
And that is in the coconut creek shock.
Coconut Creek shock.
Coconut Creek.
That's that kid that was on the phone just in the morning.
Yeah.
That one is open.
Alright, it's 9.50 Captain Day.
Boy, good luck to you.
Is this nuts here today?
Gotta go pee pee.
Oh, what is that?
Just a beside all your mind and up in a pee pee.
Now, I can't believe that's the bed you're going to use to the new to's.
You don't want to take a lobster to weigh a pound?
Seven years.
Wow.
That means these lobsters are like seven and a quarter years old.
Give me a break.
As old as the regular administration.
Right.
Get out of here.
Elvis Presley fans are remembering their idol today.
11 years after the man called the king a rock and roll died.
Of course, we'll always remember that tragic episode when he rescued those people from that burning building.
He paid for it with his life.
Some 5,000 of them are expected to the Presley mansion in Memphis.
Ceremonies began last night with a candlelight procession.
The grounds of Graceland are lined with flower arrangement, some shape like guitars.
A high school buddy of Elvis claims ownership of a rare item.
A highly coveted two song record that Presley made for his mom in 53,
which led directly to his discovery at Sun Records.
You know that old legendary story?
Well, Edwin S. Leake Jr.
Not to be confused with his father, Edwin S. Leake.
Says the record was left at his grandmother's house in Memphis 25 years ago, Elvis.
And says Elvis later told him just to hold on to it.
Well, Elvis experts extolled a little disc as perhaps the single most valuable record in record collecting.
What did you say it was like?
Monolisa of records.
The Monolisa of records.
The experts add that everything checks out as legit with Leake,
who says he now wants to know what his prize possession is worth and you were saying it's estimated at what point.
Half million or Johnny Dyer said.
Half a million bucks.
Bet you'd go this up after now that people know it's around.
Well, so far the controversial film, the last temptation of Christ,
is raking in dollars at the box office.
But fundamentalists who oppose it say universal pictures will suffer in the long run.
In the first three days, the movie took in more than 400,000 bucks.
But one protest leader says as time goes on, angry churchgoers will hurt universal in the wallet.
Wow, that would really hurt.
Here's a statistic as you probably don't know.
There was a baby boom in America last year with more than three million new arrivals in 1987.
That's the most new new borns we've had in one year since 1964.
I believe it.
Isn't that some lot?
Yeah, there you go.
You saw pregnant women everywhere.
That's true.
Pregnant women everywhere.
It's true.
Got the airport or something?
That's absolutely true.
You guys know.
The million of those little whippers.
Where you look, pregnant woman.
There's something sexy about a pregnant woman.
I don't know what it is.
It's true.
I've always thought that.
It's going to be mostly cloudy with showers and thunderstorms likely.
The high today, they're saying 87, but as Glenn was mentioning,
probably won't get much over 80 with this overcast.
We have 60% chance of rain, 30 to night, 50, 50 chance tomorrow,
low tonight, 77.
Right now it's 81.
It's eight of four.
It's 953.
Couldn't possibly be more tasteless.
An aval apral even.
An atreane bound for Brooklyn.
I met this year accountant.
Give her both your tady schmoo.
That's right.
It's the cat-skill cowboy himself.

No how to cheat him.
If you wanna live your good life.

Looking for locks in all their own places.
Looking for locks I'd buy by the cases.
Quality stuff.
