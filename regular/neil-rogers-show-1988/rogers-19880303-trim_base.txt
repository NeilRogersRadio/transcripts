Number 17 record on your boogie man.
And 1980 to the top record of the whole year.
What we just heard a little bit of was, please don't go by case.
Now this man has made some serious impact right into this business.
That's impressive.
1983, the number two record Africa by Toto, which we're not going to hear little bits and pieces
of again.
That's what the gentleman's all about.
Yeah, when I kill him in general meets the...
Serengeti.
Serengeti at Sarah Havo and Erleens, but it comes flying out of my brush more.
It's a 740 on Zeta 4.
We have a mobile caller in Brown County.
Hello.
That one is just Neil.
Yes, sir.
Neil, this is the first guy you're doing.
Okay, Kirk.
I can't believe I'm different here.
Voice sounds.
I know it's amazing, isn't it?
On the phone here, it's compared to the radio.
What do you do to it?
What do I do to it?
We put it through a filter like in a lucky strike.
Makes you sound a lot better.
I know.
You do know.
That's why I'm on the radio.
That's why I don't stand out of three corners with a megaphone.
It wouldn't sound as good.
I got to tell you one thing.
The way you criticize all these other radio stations is really ridiculous.
I know. It's terrible, isn't it?
No, they don't sit around and talk to you.
Your whole show is nothing but sitting around on the phone.
Can I say this to you, Kirk?
If that's the case, how come you're listening, babe?
It was an accident.
It was an accident.
So was that.
I just...
Oh my god.
Did you hear about that?
It was an accident.
These things have.
I know.
Just an accident.
Yeah, maybe you can get back in again, babe.
Unbelievable.
Do you believe that?
Now, of course, the other stations do not talk about us, right?
No, never.
Like the Isle of Dung over there.
They're just apoplectic to try to get us into a shouting match,
which we're not going to do.
Or that zany guy.
And the zany guy who's obsessed with talking about this show.
And Greg and Donald, who used to do neo-rodgers theater before
in 855.
Now, they don't talk about us.
Not at all.
Anyway, moving right along, let's go to a Carol,
another mobile caller.
Hello.
I'm winning, Neil.
How are you, Carol?
Good. A long time left there.
First time caller.
I had a call in on a day line.
Great.
Well, you have quite an act to follow, Carol.
I'm fine, too.
Tell me about the melting pot.
Which is the best night to go there?
Which is the best night?
I'll go out of night when it's not crowded.
Like maybe a Monday or Tuesday?
It opens every night.
Every night?
What night are you there?
What night am I there?
Well, I'm not there on any particular night.
I mean, I go every now and then.
But when you least expect it.
That we might bump into you.
You might. It's possible.
I think your wit is wasted on the audience.
In this town, yeah, you're right, Carol.
I should only use about half of it.
And even then, I think it might be wasted.
Yeah, you're right.
But I do my best.
You know, I just kind of fumble along here.
And like the guy said before,
I rip all these other people and it's ridiculous.
We don't have any show and all of that stuff, right?
You've got a great chef.
I know.
Enjoy it.
Listen to it every morning going to work.
Thank you, Carol.
You have great taste.
Have a nice day.
Carol.
Okay, Carol just kind of like disappeared off into oblivion there.
Didn't she?
These mobile collars, man, they've got a sense of humor
this morning that is unparalleled in the history of broadcasting.
742 on Zeta 4.
I just can't believe that we accidentally, uh,
blow up on it.
What was his name?
These things happen.
Moishi Pupik was at his name that we just just just hit
bump with my arm.
The thing over there.
Well, don't worry about it.
It was amazing because I didn't know my arms were that long to
reach over there.
My elbow.
Okay, let's take a call from Miami next.
This ought to be exciting.
Hello.
Yeah, Neil.
This is exciting.
Morning.
How are you doing?
Listen, and what it is is all the
the normal people are getting strangled out by the
abnormal down here in day county.
So it makes us temporarily insane where we don't
seem as if we are as active.
Now, wait a minute.
Is this Ed?
This sounds like Ed, doesn't it?
Well, it's not.
Okay, you sound just about as monotonous and boring as Ed.
Oh, thank you.
Listen, Neil.
I like that song that they don't go
whatever by KC.
Please don't go.
Yeah, that's a good tune.
Well, I was wondering now.
Don't do it now.
Wait a minute.
I have not.
You would be so nervous here for just a second.
The airport is going over.
The airport is going over.
Well, going.
On Monday or Tuesday,
I woke up at 2 in the morning.
I heard a
glenn.
What was that?
A nightmare.
What was going on on there?
I don't know.
You're playing KC.
You're playing, yeah.
We're playing up screw cuts at this hour
of the morning for all you people who
get into weird music or something.
I don't know.
I was just waking up in the morning.
You know,
glenn, at 2 when I said, wow, what is this?
You know, no, no, no, it's fixed and he was back on again.
Yeah, did you like it?
Did you like that obscure music?
Yeah, it was pretty good.
Yeah.
It was pretty good, but I don't know.
You got a long time for it, guy.
You need to move it up where everybody's listening.
Oh, no, you guys want to do that?
No, no, we like to hide it.
Yeah, that's on purpose.
Yeah, I've heard the show.
I think it's in the right spot.
Yeah.
Listen, Neal, I was wondering since you were talking about obscure music,
I was wondering about this
by Asia.
Any music by Asia?
You like Asia?
No.
I kind of like Australia myself.
Great.
Okay, well, I guess, uh,
that wasn't a request, now, was it?
Oh, no, I was just wondering.
I feel like, no, I don't, I'm not into that.
Oh, I mean, because you talk about classic hits.
I like Africa by Toto.
Oh, come on.
When Mount Kilimanjaro hits us connected in the eye, I like that.
Yeah, well, I mean, you got turkeys, uh,
lyrics, you know, makes a great song all the time.
Yeah.
It's, uh, Asia did a lot better than
uh, Toto, ever thought of doing.
Well, what was Asia's big hit?
Uh, the, uh, after first album, they got, uh,
11 out of 12 hits.
One of the biggest hits was, uh,
heated the moment.
Okay, let me look it up for you.
Now, Asia heated the moment reached number four.
Mm-hmm.
Only time will tell.
Read 17.
Don't cry.
Reach number 10.
And the smile has left your eyes.
Reach number 34.
Those are the only four that they had.
Now, who's the other group you're talking about Toto?
Yeah.
For you who are talking about Toto?
I don't like Toto, by the way.
So don't get the wrong idea.
I think Toto sucks, all right?
All right.
Just mention that in passing.
Well, in, in Toto, um, I think they are Toto-desisted.
Okay, now they had, uh, Africa, which reached number one, by the way.
So I think you're in trouble already.
Okay.
Rosanna, which was number two for five weeks.
And was 18 weeks on a chart.
Hold the line, which reached number five,
14 weeks on a chart.
That was their first hit.
A 99, uh, make believe.
And I won't hold your back, reach number 10.
So I'm afraid I hate to break the bad news to you about, uh, okay.
But don't, don't, don't, hey, listen, don't feel bad about it.
Okay.
Because even Tab Hunter had a big hit.
So, well, the American pubic don't, uh, overestimate their taste.
It happens.
Ain't, uh, just when you're going to have, uh,
both on for interviews.
Yeah.
What are you going to do?
When are we going to have you on for interviews about one to embarrass himself?
People from Cooper City, why can't you have, uh,
both of them?
For what?
You know, so the audience can rag on,
or ask them any questions that they want to ask.
Go on about.
Okay, that's good.
That's a good idea.
We'll bring him in here one of these days.
If he's agreeable to it,
mm-hmm.
See, I ordinarily don't like those,
ask the program director things,
because they're corny and they're just the stupid.
Yeah, 100 doesn't.
Well, yeah.
He's giving it a try.
Yeah, maybe if we ever get a 10-year-old program director,
like, why 100, he would do it.
I love those commercials.
They're just so great.
Hey, we calling, we ask you what you want to do with it.
Well, there are reasons I,
the only reason I like the commercials is there are
a couple of people in the spots who are really interesting,
but you only see them very briefly.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
We do.
Okay, listen, have a great day.
All right, Neil.
It's a great, uh,
great, uh,
I'm sure it is.
We're eight minutes.
It's been good for you.
Okay, I'll see you in Asia.
All right, good.
Okay.
We got some Asia here.
Like in Siberia,
we don't play Asia on this station, do we?
We've got three cuts, but we don't play them, do we?
I think so.
We do?
Uh, I don't know the past few weeks,
but months ago.
Uh-huh.
Are they right next to the, uh,
David Lee Rothkatz?
Which reminds me, by the way,
this Sunday is a very big day in town.
You are aware of that, aren't you?
Well, at the Hollywood snortatorium.
Oh, almost pre-pubescent moron kids are going to be out there
watching this jackass jump around like some kind
like he's got St.
Vitas dance.
Oh,
that's a good description.
Dressed up like he just came from a drag show with the copa.
I mean, he is really.
What, what is with these kids today?
Anywhere.
They really that dumb that they think this guy can sing.
He is.
He's like a walking tragedy.
Even the Bee Gees never saw a tragedy like him.
Speaking of the Bee Gees, by the way,
and I know that gets that gets somebody really upset.
I don't want to mention the best folder's name again,
but can I look up the Bee Gees?
It's so much fun.
Because we know that they're one of those obscure groups
and they certainly are not part of the, uh,
history of the angels of rock and roll.
Are they?
No.
Now they're more like, uh,
fact, that's probably why we don't play Baby come back by player,
even though it was the number one record of 1978,
because they're more gloves 94,
sure, they do play them on gloves.
I think they really do.
Good for them.
Who am I looking up?
That is probably the reason you're probably right.
Oh, the Bee Gees.
Well, let's see.
How can you mend a broken heart with only number one for four weeks?
We can't play that.
I started a joke was number six.
I got to get a message to you was number eight.
Now, why wouldn't we play?
I've got to get a message to you.
That's a A.O.R. type of cut.
Kind of.
Yeah.
Massachusetts, which is, oh my god,
look at all of these.
Oh my god.
What is tragedy was number one for two weeks.
Love you inside out was number one.
Too much.
Heaven was number one.
Night fever was number one for eight weeks.
Stay in live was number one.
How deep is your love was number one?
You should be dancing was number one.
Jive talking was number one.
They had three six seven eight nine.
Number one hits.
Love so right.
Reach number three.
That was a good song.
He's the liar.
The woman in you.
Run to me.
My world.
First of May.
Words.
What about the coal mining.
Oh, here.
Yeah.
The lights went out in Massachusetts.
Reach number 11.
Holiday was 16.
Massachusetts is another cut we could be playing.
See, I don't want to say he gets upset when I do this
because it makes it sound like I'm trying to program the station.
But it just seems to me just as an observer
in the passing musical scene with my Lausy taste in music.
That there's a lot of stuff out there
that just doesn't get played.
Mm-hmm.
Anyway.
When's the last time you heard anybody play
Massachusetts by the Bee Gees?
No.
Or I started a joke.
Should be magic should play those.
I assume they do.
Especially with Decochus in town.
I'm sure he'd appreciate that.
Oh, you're up.
And it's just amazing how this all fits together.
We've got to start by Kitty Decochus.
Well, Sorda, a man who spent nearly four years on the lamb
with two three and a half ton elephants
says he will surrender if he is assured
that the pack of germs aren't returned
to a man he alleges brutalize them.
Arlen Siden, a 58-year-old animal trainer
who lives in New Jersey,
hasn't seen his four children
or met his only grandson since he took off
in a tractor trailer with Tory and Duchess
two Indian elephants he raised from impency and then sold.
The elephant's owner, Edward Drake
and his father Richard
and the president of a national animal trainer's group
deny that the animals were abused.
You have a lot of animal stories on my house.
What you'll like this one.
Now, this is a little chart out of today's USA Today.
What are the categories
jeopardy has used most frequently since it's returned to TV
in September 84?
Now, what do you think history?
You say history.
That's not right.
You want to guess what category
presidents is also a good guess.
No business and industry.
Oh, yeah, sure.
81% of the time they use business and industry
and sports is number two, by the way, surprisingly.
78%.
Well, then you ought to become a contestant, actually.
You'd be off in about 30 seconds.
Next is science.
68% religion is 65% and animals.
64%.
Eric Burden.
House of the rising sun.
Monterey.
It has to be in the form of a question.
That's right.
What is Monterey?
No, it is Monterey.
A city right next to Carmell.
Who is, what's his name?
Already.
No, I just ate the peas that were on top.
You can have the pasta.
But I mean, the pasta is good and all, but I figured I'd save you some.
What a guy.
Yeah.
What a nice guy, huh?
What a great gesture.
What a magnanimous guy.
What a pig.
Anyway, so it's Rick's birthday coming up on Monday, huh?
Rick and Marlene.
Oh, yeah.
Mm-hmm.
No, it's just Rick's birthday.
Yeah.
Well, let's see.
Big Dave can go with me on, and maybe you can tag along too.
You're invited.
Thank you.
On Monday at the Maldipot.
Well, see.
Yeah, we'll see.
I always love that.
And let's see.
And you and the big Dave can fight over who's going to have Marlene be their date.
And 29 past nine on Zeta 4.
And they probably won't show up anyway because they're so nervous.
They just, these people get all nervous about this.
They don't understand.
It's just a radio show, okay?
I'm not going to web scone with anybody or drag anybody off kicking and screaming.
No?
No, I like them to come with me quietly.
Keep us game.
Hello.
Deal.
Yeah.
How you doing?
Great.
I went to school with that guy with a hat, the guy who works the hat.
Mm-hmm.
I went to school with his son up and games though.
Oh, yeah.
I went to his house.
Do you know that this guy is married to a former Playboy bunny?
Really?
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely.
He's incredibly hot.
It's amazing.
You mean senior is married to a former bunny?
Absolutely.
A nice lady.
Well, maybe that's why he talks like he has St. Vite's dance all the time.
Maybe that's this.
Mm-hmm.
Anyway, the house is amazing, and so is she, but he's pretty nasty.
Is he really?
Yeah.
Not a real nice guy.
I get a lie.
I am not.
I'm not saying I don't say that.
Yeah.
But anyway.
Yeah, a lot of people, most of the people who used to work for him or with him
have got very unkind things to say about him.
Yeah, and that's probably very true.
Mm-hmm.
But listen, you're pretty famous.
The world around, I'm sure.
I went to this restaurant out in the town and country mall in Kendall.
Yeah.
The food is terrible.
The place was bad.
I mean, it took us an hour and a half to get a table.
Hmm.
But everybody they was talking about.
You the waiter was talking about.
Are you cereal?
What's that?
What were they saying?
Well, they were saying just that.
Well, like for they talked about the Stevie Nicks bit,
which is a riot, by the way.
But I hear this guy with the next table.
I'm making them always just like, uh,
really incredible.
The wild.
Yeah.
And we were talking about you too, so I don't know.
Maybe it was the fever that was running through the whole place.
Yeah, maybe the Neorodges disease was spreading throughout the town and country.
Yeah, I get something that's got to spread through that place.
Yeah.
It was pretty wild.
Great.
But anyway, I'll let you get back to your multiple soup and angel here pasta.
Okay.
Okay.
Just as long as I don't get any angel here in my multiple soup, right?
That would be a bad idea.
Okay.
See you later.
Okay.
Thanks.
931, I'd say to four,
God's River log in 10 past 10 with the 16 in a row at 8 billion hits and all kinds of good stuff.
God's just grilled today, by the way, features, um,
the ELO.
Where are you looking now?
ELO, the kinks and led Zeppelin.
Well, there's nothing wrong with that.
Mm-hmm.
Hmm.
What's going on on that show anyway?
Hmm.
Boy, is this good, huh?
I'm just trying to sell.
Oh, you're not ready.
Sorry.
What do you mean I'm not ready?
I'm ready.
Whatever you are, okay?
Number six is something about radio.
No, it's not because number six is flashing.
Okay.
Well, I guess that's what I'm trying on.
Something about radio.
You're right.
Oh, West Kendall.
Where's that?
On one.
On one is West Kendall.
Hello.
Well, I have a question.
You need somebody to take care of Marlene while you're taking care of her brother?
We have a volunteer, huh?
I think I could handle that.
I bet you could.
Monday night at the melting pot.
Yes.
Seven o'clock.
You're going to come by and say hi?
Yeah, I'm going to come by and say hi, uh,
I'm looking for Marlene.
I bet you will.
Well, we'll probably have her pretty busy.
If the bird and the big Dave come by,
it probably have her very well occupied.
And, um, just for old memories, right?
And, uh, let me just set the, uh,
let me make your phone ring at my own ring at the same time.
I haven't got the flight.
Oh, this is good.
Okay.
Is that all we're going to get to here?
You like to hear the whole thing?
Oh, yeah.
Come on.
Let it go.
Here it is.
We're eating anyway.
Yeah, this kills a lot of good time.
Greg and Rick.
Mm-hmm.
Ricky Tickey.
Oh, I like this.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, hey, what happened?
What's up?
Rick.
Which one?
Yeah, let's go over there.
Hey, I don't know.
What the hell happened?
You're following me?
I'm following you.
Well, I'm fine.
It's you.
Eat it down here.
I have a display in game.
How can I make your phone ring at my own ring at the same time?
I'm just going to set the flight at my page.
It's going to be okay, though.
Yeah.
Well, I'm supposed to really speed up.
Uh, they've been going just like just a light several times.
Somebody's playing games here.
Your phone ring.
Okay.
Well, third one.
23, general.
Okay.
All right.
I mean, there's no discussion of
situations, the events of social problems or anything.
It's just shock and radio.
I'm 34 on Zeta 4.
That Rick, he never lets us down, does he?
What a sense of humor.
He's always right there when you need him.
Uh, anyway, moving right along.
Let's see.
Six is.
I'm trying to just tell me.
Okay.
But North Cuba.
They county.
Hello.
Let's get to the important stuff.
Why does this?
Tell me a few days ago, you talking about the ratings.
How much did you beat GTR by?
Let's see, we had a four one and they had a three one.
How much age group?
That's 12 plus and in 25 to 54, we had a five, six and I had a four, two.
You killed them.
Yeah, we destroyed them.
We wiped them out.
Are they second or was it somebody in between?
Oh, no, no, they weren't seconded.
We weren't even close to being seconded.
We had a bunch of stations in between.
Are you talking, you know, like, 100 or you talking just stations that nobody would listen to, like, what's that?
Do you like you?
No, no, no, I'm talking about stations like Y100 and Waxi and, um, gloves 94.
They're way down the line.
Oh, yeah, GTR is in a flat spin, man.
They're dropping like an atomic bomb over Hiroshima.
I'm telling you.
I think the reason is because the other show is really, you know, other than yourself,
there's the only ones that have any, to me, any ability at all.
But they don't do anything.
They're never on.
All they do is, and got a jukebox over there.
I don't think they're funny to begin with, to be honest with you.
Some of the stations were funny.
Well, what's in a great while, but I mean, who wants to listen for four hours and, you know,
hoping on a wing in a prayer that today we might hear something entertaining?
Yeah.
But they're just not on.
They got a jukebox, you know, and they have that stupid promo that says,
a hermitemic bean and music in the morning.
What a novel concept, which is basically like saying, you know,
they're hanging around here, but we're playing a ton of music.
The reason they're saying that basically because everybody, you know,
this sounds as you've come on and turned to talk basically.
Yeah.
Joy Reynolds and...
Well, yeah, see, but Joy, of course, is going to be on of their, uh, soon, unfortunately.
We like him to stay forever, but that just can't go on forever.
And she is playing more music.
They're making Joy play more music.
They got to bring back Jemme and Steve.
Who?
That's a guy.
He's never there before.
They always bring his kids to play.
Jemme and Steve, I mean, get, you have a death wish for them all together, don't you?
Those guys are bad.
Yeah.
Oh, how'd you care about the number?
They're not as zany as Joy is.
Yeah.
So how far ahead are you, everybody else, where are you?
In what?
Numbers.
Where's the closest person to you?
In what?
In 25 to 54?
Uh, we tied with sunny, he had a 5-6.
We were number two in the market.
CMQ FM, the Spanish language beat us, but in English speaking, we were tied
for first with sunny with a 5-6.
And then there was a lot of people right behind like, I think I don't have it in
front of me, but I think Waxie had about a 5-5.
And gloves had a 4-7 and GTR had a 4-2.
And, uh...
Basically...
GTR is beginning to hurt and she is dead in the water and, uh,
we're slowly but surely making some inroads, you know?
I was just curious.
Okay.
Thanks, Neil.
See you later.
Bye-bye.
I-37 on Zeta 4.
Monster Ball Soup is great.
The Angel Hare pasta bolognese was phenomenal from Tath Street Road Tisserie.
And the Feta Chini Alfredo is excellent.
Mm.
Yeah, I noticed you've cleaned that pretty much.
How did you lick the plate?
We were getting close to...
Tam Davis taught me some tricks.
Yeah.
See, you can eat it faster and get more nutrition at the same time.
Right.
More than that was good.
Mm.
Now of course comes that moment that you've all been waiting for.
Seriously.
As Uncle Neil dips into the Amaretto...
Boclava.
Boclava.
See, that's where I draw the line.
At Boclava, you're nuts.
Mm.
I remember how you didn't know what hamotation was Captain Daniel.
Mm-hmm.
Well, you don't know what Boclava is.
Well, it'll make you feel real Greek.
Yeah.
That rock grew from Canada.
Isn't it Boclava turn to robertry?
Mm-hmm.
Ye mean.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
Oh.
Or...
This is disgusting.
What do you...
One that I wonder why there's a show going on or something?
It's just...
Please.
This look on his face.
No, he's not. He's just into the food.
Don't let him kid you, okay?
What's going on in this room?
He can pack it away.
You are just going to freak out when you taste this.
It is so good.
Amaretto Boclava.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
BG's forever.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
What is he?
Just going to sit there now while I'm eating.
Mm-hmm.
Look at him.
What do you want me to do?
He wants the show to start back up.
So another is basically you have for no act like, right?
Great idea.
22 till 10 on Zeta 4.
The food madness continues.
I'm gonna look at him in there.
He's like oblivious.
Yeah, no.
He polished off.
What is that now?
Feta Chini?
He's eating.
With a spoon too.
He polished it off so fast.
Like most people would either think of yogurt.
He had a pound of Feta Chini Alfredo, okay?
I'm serious.
Yeah, but it's healthy calories.
I bet you eat one of those big stofers lasagna's frozen.
You don't even take the time to cook it, do you?
Are you kidding?
I don't eat stuff like that.
Oh, sorry.
I cook it first.
No, I don't eat frozen food.
Mm-hmm.
Here he goes again when I talk.
At this very minute, my mother is making monocopy for me when I arrive at the hospital.
Is she really in Milton?
Oh, in Pensacola?
Well, it's outside Pensacola.
Milton.
The best monocopy you've ever tasted in your life.
Great.
Now, is that great or what?
Okay, get it to...
I'm going to take it home is what I'm going to do.
Then we have these incredible cookies.
I know the Captain Dei Moe touched this because he doesn't eat sugar.
No, seriously, he doesn't eat sugar.
I'm just going to break off a piece of one.
Look at the size of that.
Did you say something about brownies before?
Captain Meng?
He's in a coma.
I'm sorry.
Ladies and gentlemen, please send your donations to the
Resurrect Captain Dave Fund.
RDC.
We should have guessed the food content.
And we get all these big ratings.
It's just unbelievable, isn't it?
Really makes you wonder.
We do, huh?
It's true.
Yeah, say it again.
We underlined in red.
Well, I can't say absolutely not.
Exactly.
20 before 10 on Zeta 4.
And let's take some more calls because the lines
are continuing flashing here.
They don't give a damn.
We sound like pigs on the air.
Broward, hello.
Hello.
Yeah.
How are you?
How are you?
How are you?
I'm Howard.
I talked to you last week from Michigan.
You have to work at Lou's Delacat.
Oh, yeah.
Howard from Michigan.
How are you doing, Howie?
Good. How are you?
Good.
How can you guys eat all that stuff this early in the morning?
Well, when you get up at 4.30 by 9 o'clock,
you're ready for lunch, babe.
This is what I got a good joke for you.
Oh.
Is it...
We all tell jokes.
But this is a good one.
But is it dirty?
No.
We sure.
Positive.
Is it in bad taste?
What were you used all the time, anyways?
Like what?
Well, the fellow wants it for far.
It's a nice guy.
Howie.
Yeah.
We don't do jokes.
Howie.
Joe.
Can I ask your question?
Your whole show's a joke.
Howie.
What?
He's getting testy now.
How come you won't talk to me, Howie?
How do you hear this one?
How come you won't answer anything, I say?
We don't let him tell a joke.
He's not going to like us anymore.
You don't respond to anything.
I'm feeling for Detroit.
I've got to like you.
I'm not from Detroit.
I just lived there for two years.
Don't keep saying I'm from Detroit.
I'm from Rochester, okay?
Well, they know that.
That's I guess a few miles out of Detroit.
I'm from a civilized city.
I'm not Rochester, Michigan.
Rochester, New York.
All right.
It's in New York, but that's worse, huh?
No, it's not worse.
The great town, if it ever stops
knowing that everybody would want to live there.
I'm just going to joke.
Yeah.
We don't do jokes, Howie.
You don't do jokes, and you don't do requests.
You just eat.
No, we do a show here.
We do the show.
We don't want the audience to enjoy jokes.
But when you hear this, when you might use it.
Oh my god.
What does it take to convince this man from Detroit
that we don't do jokes?
That's when that starts to happen.
When I run the city, I turned off the lights.
Let me ask you something.
Once the last time you ever heard somebody
call in Dick Purton and do a joke on here.
Well, he's just Dick Purton.
He had somebody, Joe, you don't have to.
Remember, he used to do the coffee and deal from the mayor?
Mm-hmm.
Remember Hamtramik Mama?
Hamtramik Mama.
Remember him off in Dick Purton.
Yeah.
Yeah, he was the funniest.
So howie?
Yes.
Howie?
I haven't called that in many years.
Well, it fits, howie.
Somehow it fits.
You know, I'm from Lakeland.
You know who to spring trains there.
Sure.
Yeah.
So have you ever been to...
The people that met at Worthy train,
and I could have went anyways.
Yeah, have you ever been to Benny's oyster bar up there?
No.
How about steak and shake?
Bacon shake?
Yeah.
I've never heard of this bacon shake.
Haven't?
You're trying to get around my joke, aren't you?
Now what gives you that idea?
Well, I don't know.
Now tell us about meeting that guy you met from radio.
From whom?
Well, that's right.
Yeah, I have to be at his house.
I do pull work.
Oh, you were the pull guy?
Well, not the pull guy.
We do pull restoration.
Mm-hmm.
And he...
He told me he just moved down here
and moved into plantation and he knows you.
Yeah, sure.
We know him.
I don't know if Bacon he's going to be on.
Who?
Johnny Dark.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, maybe this one you never know.
I doubt that.
Yeah, you never know.
But obviously he's not on the radio yet
because he can't afford to get his pull fixed.
That's right.
He just moved down.
Yeah.
But there's girlfriend.
Mm-hmm.
I still don't understand.
How does somebody move down
and move in without having a job?
I don't know.
That's what I asked him.
He'll get a job.
You just don't worry about it.
I'll get a job.
I did the same thing.
Hear the silhouette and get a job on Zeta Ford.
I did the same thing.
I moved to this town without a job.
Really?
As most people do.
I think it's not that uncommon.
You know, you, I mean, you came to town.
You had, oh, you went to Palm Beach.
So you came to Miami.
You had a job.
Pretty on a, you, me.
Yeah.
Pretty on the orthodox.
Oh, is it really?
Where the last time he went to Detroit.
In July for one day.
Yeah, did you, did you drive down John Lodge?
Or did you fly over it?
I flew over it's here.
We showed there is so cold there.
Wait, what time is going on?
What is that?
What is going on in this place?
So when are you going to tell us that joke, howie?
You sure you're ready now?
No.
No.
Huh?
We're not ready.
You're not ready?
Well, you know, he's a designer and he has something that's back with Vi
and I'll tell you the joke.
Howie.
We don't do jokes.
I mean, I have to see if the melting pot,
and I'll tell you if it's the melting pot.
Okay.
Or you can write it down and mail it in.
Yeah.
Oh, my.
And if it's good, we'll take credit.
Yeah, then you'll take credit and use it on the air.
If it's good, yeah.
The fact is, really, it's my wife's joke.
Oh, boy.
So maybe I should let her tell you.
No.
Now she's afraid to get on the radio.
I don't blame her.
Well, listen, howie.
You know, good talking to you.
Yeah, we're 20 minutes to tell you this joke.
Listen, forget about the joke.
You were a great caller without the joke.
Howie, don't you understand?
We had a good time without the joke.
Okay, well, when are you going to get over at the melting pot
on the weekend?
Oh, you know, so it's my daughter's birthday, man.
She's my grandmother.
Oh, my takeer.
She's not a eight-year-old.
I'm going to take her where?
I mean, where's Ashley?
What is he talking about?
Do you have any idea?
None.
My daughter's birthday.
What about it?
Well, happy birthday, Ashley.
Huh?
We've lost control.
Yeah.
It's been great, howie, howie.
Oh, I appreciate it.
Howie's freaking out on us.
Happy birthday, Ashley.
Do you like she wanted me to take her to see the chicken,
the chip and dales,
but I just kind of had a pass on that.
The chicken bale.
The chip and dales.
No, eight years old, I think it's a little bit too young for her, huh?
You should take her to chicken bales.
I should take her to the...
I take her out for a little birthday treat to chicken pales.
Just a new chicken restaurant in Carroll City up here, right up the street.
You know what's up there?
She tried out a burr run on speeder for Annie,
but she didn't get the part last.
Great, that's exciting, howie.
You like to dance on your show,
that all your audience see here?
Uh-huh.
It's like they have the baby's who contested.
Sounds like your whole family is frustrated performers, huh?
Yeah, let's try to do that.
Comedians dancing.
Can you remember you,
do you remember you,
you're only juvenile court that you can be on television and be tried?
No.
How you don't?
I remember Marilyn Turner.
Oh yeah, well Marilyn Turner is very to...
John Kelly.
John Kelly, yeah.
Is there still Mary?
How about Bill Bonds?
Is he still on Channel 7?
I don't know, the town's in between him and the scotch and sirloin,
but he's still there.
How about Dave Diles?
Dave Diles?
Yeah, Dave Diles there, but that lady left.
How about Sunny Elliott?
Wayne Dryers down here, you know.
How about Sunny Elliott?
Oh yeah, Sunny Elliott's still there with the weather.
Do you know who else is down here?
Is the guy Sol and Gray used to be on XYZ?
Sol and Gray.
Yeah, he used to be on Channel 7, he's on Channel 4 now.
Uh, you know what left?
Um, what's that girl that left?
I'm sure the audience is just a really sick girl, you know.
They've been on these air-interests with all these millions of people out there listening to us.
Yeah, tell you there's a lot of ex-decoiters out there.
They're probably trying to put two into together.
Yeah, trying, I think, is the...
We understand that the Lou Gordon show is going to make a comeback.
Lou's going to do it from heaven.
He was great.
He was my favorite, you know.
Well, I'll tell you, my favorite is Bill Pick Burton.
Yeah.
He's just amazing.
Absolutely amazing.
You're right.
He's right at cross-contest.
He went over that one.
Sir, I believe in originality.
Okay, I'm not interested in rip-off.
Oh, rip-off in a bar.
I know.
Well, listen, have a great day, Howie.
I'll be seeing you in the only stock until you get to see you later.
All righty.
Bye-bye.
Speaking of Howie.
Voice from support.
Yep.
Hello, Mr. East celebrity.
Yes, uh, good morning.
Good morning.
It is Mr. Stern.
Yes, it is.
You want to voice your support for us?
I guess I do, I do.
I got my serious, serious voice now.
Oh, it's now, Lewis.
Grandpa from the Munsters.
You know, once Grandpa from the Munsters gets angry at the FCC,
I bet you're going to create a potion.
You're going to make him disappear.
Can I tell you something?
Go ahead.
Even I can't create a potion for those in the end of the pool.
Come to the heck.
They're beyond the grade of those people.
But no, really.
I want to tell you, Howie, I mean nobody.
No offense, Grandpa.
I don't know you that well for you.
Still call me Howie.
Howie.
Working that way, West TV.
West TV.
Howie.
Tell us about that.
Oh, Grandpa.
I mean, howie, howie, why?
May it be like the Echee.
Okay, it's 12 minutes before 10.
I thought that would fit in, wouldn't you?
Well, so in other words, if anyone wants to call in reminisce about Michigan,
this is the show to call.
This is the, uh, Michigan or show, right?
Yeah.
Great.
I must say that I like the Detroit collars,
but that one, I got a little lost.
Howie?
Confused, yeah.
That one.
Frustrated performer don't understand it runs in the family.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, let's get another call out from plantation before we have to do our thing here.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Hi.
I just wanted to make this real short and sweet.
Okay.
Read about you.
I don't know what I do if I didn't have your show to listen to in the morning.
Yeah.
Take it easy on those heavy foods, okay?
I know.
They're just, they're just, uh,
killing me with kindness here,
and it's just pouring the food down my throat.
Uh, you can keep the mouth closed for the food,
so you can get the funny stuff coming out.
Okay, I gotta go check out my thumbnail,
but thanks for answering my call.
Okay, bye-bye.
Wow.
As a matter of fact, since I have been eating all of this food,
I have had some funny stuff coming out.
Oh, you're welcome.
But we certainly don't want to discuss that.
The big question among reporters at the Grammys last night was,
would Michael Jackson join the winners in speaking with reporters backstage?
Well, the question became moot when he lost all four awards he was up for.
But the night wasn't a total loss for Mickey.
He got a standing ovation after performed his latest single,
man in the mirror.
Oh.
First lady Nancy Reagan says doctors should watch what they say when commenting in public
on the health of presidents and their families.
In an ABC interview to be broadcast tomorrow night, Mrs. Reagan said she recalls watching TV
with her husband while he was in the hospital.
When the doctor came on the set and said he'd give the president four or five months to live.
Yeah.
You know that Nancy said that her husband was the most important president in the
American history.
Oh my god.
Anybody should know.
Yeah, well, we want to wish happy birthday today to James Dewan.
He is Scotty on Star Trek.
He's 68 today.
Also Ed Maranero who was on Hill Street Blues.
It's his birthday today.
That's correct.
He played for Cornell by them.
That's a lot of trivia there.
Did he play for Cornell?
Now, it was on this state and history 10 years ago today
that the remains of comedian Charlie Chaplin were stolen by extortionists from his grave in Switzerland.
Now it was Michael Jackson.
Oh yeah, that's right.
And five years ago today in LA,
President Reagan challenged the TV networks
the dwell on good news for National Volunteer Week.
And by the way, the networks declined.
You don't realize it, but Ricky Schroeder has President Kennedy's brain.
Did you know that?
It's true stirring.
Okay, anything else going on today?
I think that's it.
I think we got it all partly cloudy.
It'll be about 80 today and 68 tonight.
And it's 72 now on Jada 4 at 951.
954 on Jada 4.
Now let's put our Jada 4 microphone in the control room for just a moment or two
and see how Captain Dave is coping with two days in a row of this gluttony.
Okay, I'm gonna write a law.
Moving right along.
Oh god, I just, I don't know how he's keeping it up, man.
It just never stops.
It never stops.
It goes on and on and on.
What is this?
CBS.
It's stuff explanatory.
What is this?
Passes?
Oh, for the derral.
Anybody want to go to the golf tournament?
Anybody want these?
When is it?
A bunch of passes.
It's a weekend.
The derral.
This is the big weekend, right?
Run to the Florida Derby and run here.
It'll be out there.
Here you go, Captain Dave.
He's gonna be out of town.
I'm going to the Delta.
I'm so sorry about that.
So anyway, just pass those out to your friends.
We have a river Phoenix story coming up on line six.
This ought to be good.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Okay, yesterday's Harold.
In the movie section,
a night in the life of Jimmy Reardon.
Two and a half stars.
Yeah.
Due to the performance,
these stars magnetic personality.
Really?
You got to be putting me on.
I couldn't have been Bill Cosford.
I don't think it was Cosford.
No, thanks.
Cosford would have given it four stars.
He probably would have done it.
According to the review,
he looks pretty good in the movie.
I got news for you.
He doesn't look good in the poster.
He doesn't look good in the movie.
They must have put a lot of makeup on.
He's an ugly kid.
I'm sorry.
I hate to burst your bubble.
Well, nothing.
Different strokes for different folks.
You know what I mean?
Why is such a big change from stand by?
I don't know because he just, you know,
as people get older,
they change and sometimes they change for the better.
And sometimes as they do in Germany,
they take a turn for the worst.
You don't like him because he grew up.
No, I don't like him because he's ugly.
I'm not really all that excited about 12-year-old kids.
You know what I mean?
When he was in stand by me,
he was what 12 or 13 years old.
Yeah.
And he looked like he had promised
like he was going to blossom out
and be a vera strapping wonderful young man
and all of that other.
He's ugly.
Anyway, uh,
I found a...
Are you upset over the fact that I think he's ugly?
No, I'm just moving on to another subject.
Okay, because I mean,
my friend who came to the...
to shells that night a week or so ago
brought me this big folder and in one half,
there were all these pictures of river phoenix.
And in the other half,
there were these incredible pictures
about a dozen of them.
A Pat Peterson, okay?
Now, do you think that I pondered
for a long time which ones I would treasure
and keep and cherish and fondle?
Tough question.
No, I was not a tough question for me.
It was very easy.
Moving along.
Yes, okay.
I found a actress with a name
that's even better than river phoenixes.
Okay.
Last night watching HBO,
I caught the tail end of a movie called Once bitten.
Yeah.
And in the cast credits,
it was an actress named Rainbow Shalom.
Oh, I like that.
She's very big in on the beach.
I think that's river sister.
That sounds like a sherbet flavor you'd find in Israel, doesn't it?
Well, that gets my vote over river phoenix.
Okay, mine too.
Thanks a lot.
Okay.
See you later.
I 58 on Jeta 4.
And we move right along.
That really reflects the way I feel.
It's amazing.
WG TV, Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale,
and the Palm Beach's good morning.
It's the Neil Rogers show on Jeta 4.
Are you trying to say that this culent area
this disgusting display is finally catching up to you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, that was good.
That was one of each channel.
Hey, what?
Okay, let's go back to the good.
Let's talk about synchronicity.
Somebody better call the police speaking of synchronicity.
Let's take a call from Miami.
Hello.
Hi, Neil. How are you today?
Good.
Have a question for you.
Okay.
You used to be up in Connecticut, weren't you?
No, I've never worked in Connecticut or anywhere near there.
The green screen.
No.
Okay, next question.
Yeah.
Why do you hate women so bad?
I don't hate women at all.
What?
But you're always making fun, complaining,
calling up winers.
No, I'm not.
We got a lot of male winers too.
I mean, I mean, this is a good try for whatever point you're trying to make.
Of course, I don't hate women.
Why would I hate women?
Well, I don't know.
I'm asking you that.
Well, I don't.
Everybody's taken on an individual basis.
Yeah.
People are people, okay?
Whether they're male or female or somewhere in between.
I mean, you know, people are whatever they are.
And we had all those women.
No matter the fact, when we had all the young women calling the show yesterday,
I said it was great.
It was refreshing.
I thought I was very nice to them.
Okay.
Well, what are you chuckling about?
Why is that so amusing to you?
It just is.
Well, is there a specific incident you want to discuss?
I just think overall in general.
I think.
Overall in general once.
Oh, in other words, no matter what I say.
Every time I turn it on, you're, oh, god, you're.
No, it's just certain ones like you, okay?
Yeah, she's.
No, it's just certain ones like her that I despise.
Well, she's got a, she's trying to make a point.
In other words, because I'm not, I don't sexually lust after her body.
Therefore, I can't possibly like women.
Mm-hmm.
What a smart ass.
Oh, she is.
It's like Glenn and I are here four hours with you,
four and a half hours with you every day.
And I have never heard you say anything deprecating toward women.
No, I don't, I don't like women or dislike women.
I like or dislike people as individuals based on the way they are.
I don't give a damn what they are.
She's out of it.
Now, she's just a bitch, that's all.
He really is.
Anyway, it's not going to bother me,
because we had a great meal.
10 o'clock on Zeta 4, and let's go to Oral Gables next.
Hello.
Hey, Neil, how they going?
Pretty good.
You know what this is?
No.
Adam.
Adam, how you doing, Adam?
You know which one that's the second Adam, the first Adam.
The Adam who, uh, the body builder.
The football player.
Yeah, the one whose brother is a pain in the grass.
Right, how they going?
Your brother is really sick, you know that?
Way too.
You don't know?
No.
Your brother called up Stan a few weeks ago,
and was ragging on me and on the show,
and in the beginning of the call, what is his name?
Tony?
Tony.
In the beginning of the call, he was Tony.
And by the end of the call, he was you.
He had convinced himself that he was you,
and he had been on my show, and I'm a douchebag,
and all of that.
I mean, the Tony's got some problems.
Oh, yeah.
He's a little bit full of Neil.
He made, I mean, he fooled Stan.
He made Stan think that he owed some hotel over in the Bahamas.
Stan was believing it.
Really?
Yeah, he recorded that call.
Yeah, well, Tony, I think, looks like
kind of in a fantasy land, doesn't he?
Well, yeah, he's a lot bigger than I am.
He's got a little kind of a macho problem there, too, doesn't he?
Kind of, you know, he's a bit,
believe it or not, his girlfriend's got him under foot.
Oh, yeah, she's...
She says, jump, she says, I'll hug.
In other words, he's whipped, so to speak, right?
Yeah, listen, I saw an ad in the Sunday's Miami Herald
in the classified.
Yeah.
Or babysitters for girls only,
but the number was 6249400
between the hours of two and six.
LAUGHTER
Oh!
That's a bottle.
Nah, that's a put on obviously.
It must be from the same people in Kendall
who put the other stuff in the high school
results in the sports section.
It must be.
Bro, has twin-bited life eateries still just hanging out?
He's still floundering, you know.
Now, you're talking to me, you're saying to me,
have I found a life yet?
Yeah, I'm glad.
And now your brother calls up
And the biggest event in his life and he's still talking about it to this day is that you were on Neil show one day
And he thinks it was him. Yeah, and he thinks it was him. He's convinced himself it was him
And you're talking about me not having a life man
I don't think you're getting a little sturdy with me because you didn't like me that day
You were kind of yeah, Glenn does it like any of the people who come in on the show
He's very paranoid about them in defense and in hostile. What did you expect me to do Adam?
Oh, be a little friendly or you're in the smile on camera
Yeah, it was like it was like the day that Jim Schuyler came in from hot 105
He was so surly to him and turned his back on him and treated him like a mung-brain
Yeah, exactly the same. You know it was exactly the same, no matter of fact
It was disgusting
And when you say you'll get all the tension and you know, give me these words
We all know that that's the way it happens
There you go
What's that?
What else is new?
That's about it Adam, we're just hanging loose here, you know what I'm saying?
Hey, what are you gonna have like a little reunion and have everybody that's been there back on the show?
That's a good idea the only problem is like some of those people abandoned us I think
Do you remember those kids from was it Mimey Springs?
Yeah, oh no, was that from Barrett?
That kid Eric who sent us that picture all the kids in the shower
And Johnny, what was that kid's name? Not Johnny Wad? What was that kid's name?
The Wad? Yeah, they kind of we hear once in a great while
But I think those people have flipped out
Well, you know what I'm like I'm skippin', well I'm already skippin' school today I'm just kicking back
But you know you go to school and then you can't wait on the phone
Now wait a minute, what does that mean Adam? You're not skipping, you're just kicking back
That's an interesting way of putting it isn't it?
Well, I started out the morning like I was gonna go to school
And then I kind of lay on the couch, put up a TV
And you start listening to this show
Right, and then I called and I said well, I'm out for a first hold on
I was kind of sleepy, I got in late last night so
Really, tough night, hi Adam
Oh, so so
Yeah, you gotta do your things when your way of wife still can
Yeah, that's for damn sure
Anyway, moving right along
Yeah
So listen, give Tony a big hug and a kiss for me
Okay, you want me to flop spit with him?
And no, don't go that far, Howard
That's disgusting
And anyway, we, that's a good idea
We'll let you know ahead of time when we're gonna do that reunion thing
We'll have all the people in here including that kid
Remember that kid, the lifeguard that Glenn really got upset?
Okay, yeah
Oh, he was, he just decimated that poor guy
I think I was just as harmless as a butterfly and he just destroyed him
So we'll have all the, all you guys back
I think little is intimidated baby
Oh yeah, right, yeah he's just distant
Yeah, he's all, in fact he was intimidated by big Dave
In fact, every time big Dave comes on his show he's still intimidated
I believe it
Yeah, okay
Okay, listen Adam, have a great life
Okay
And it's good hearing from you
Bye-bye
Now are we gonna, you're gonna start getting defensive and surly?
I just wondered if we had time today to go through that Jim Schuyler incident again
I think we need to go through it, step by step
Since you brought it up again?
Captain Dave
Really?
What?
Don't you think we should go through it again?
No, I don't think so, I think it's boring and monotonous and we, those of us who...
Why do you bring it up?
Those of us who were a party to it, we know the real story
No, I want...
Schuyler knows what really happened, he's just a nice guy, he's not gonna rag on you
That's...
No, well we don't have to do it today but I would like to go through it again
Now what was that thing in the classifieds in a Harold again about babysitter from two to six for girl bully?
I've got sunshine on W-I-N-Z
Okay, that's just a little musical hint, that's all you get, we're not playing anymore that crap
Okay, enough is enough
And then he was, Stan was on the other day all upset because I let these people...
When I take my shots at him, he says it's only very short and sarcastic and to the point
And I was letting people go on a great length and ripping him
There are those occasions when he does four hours like the one he did two or three days ago that I heard about but I did not hear
What the hell is going on here folks?
I mean it's only, we're just doing a radio show in here, what is that again?
Is that an instant replay?
They might be the Russians finally
Oh yeah, look at that, there are 16 helmeted Russians coming down, oh no, that's the Santa Rhea house, they're going to...
There's a big sign there, it says Chicken Licking
Do you believe what's going on back here in this A-Track Room? Who the hell is in there?
That's where it's coming from
Who is in there?
It's the Music Director's Room
It's in the Music Director's Room?
It's got the real loud phone system
Are you serious?
I think they can even hear that on the air
It's a conno-rad
Oh yeah, this is a test for the next 60 seconds
Anyway, what were we just discussing before we got distracted?
Ripping?
There is so much distraction going on here
Oh yeah, and he lets these people go, oh yeah, Niel Sock said, it shows no good, he's not the same anymore
We used to love him
He lets that go on, on in fun item, okay, forever and ever in the Glen Hills Show with his sidekick
And hey, that's fine, you know, more power to him, he's got no listeners left anyways on a dead station
But if we have the audacity to let some callers go in, you know, come on a year and take some shots
He can't handle it
It's true
Shame on you Uncle Stanley, shame on you
So we are going to have a show with a topic one of these days when Rose Folger comes in?
Yeah, why didn't you talk to him about it?
No, I just, great idea
Yeah, we had mentioned that
I like that
You like the idea of having Rose Folger come in?
Yeah, but not talk about music, something about like the primary or something
Now, before we go, we still have, now this was in mono, wasn't it?
Um, probably
The little kids
Yeah, you're not going to play that again, are you?
Well, there is school there
See, there are a lot of people who didn't hear the very beginning of the show at a quarter to six
And when you come in and somebody has left a alleged material for you
And you put it on the machine assuming that it's something worthy of air play and it comes out like this
This is Miss Karen and Miss James, three and four year old class at the JCC in Fort Lwenditz Al
Hmm, yeah
Fighting and good news
Fighting for us
Eat your home in touch
I sure did
Bye bye
Captain David, most of my home in town
Fighting for you away
We right now do not say bye bye
Why doesn't she have stuff made up for her, her guy show
Why do you think you could play this and the hooters back to back?
Uh-huh
Well, why is she worrying about this show?
That was a nice gesture
But this is a U.M. class, isn't it?
Yeah
Yeah, now this was an F.I.U.
Kids at U.M. don't come to class
They sit out
I tell you, this makes me feel like Mr. Green Jean
I do
Bye bye
Yeah, I was excellent, I want to thank whoever that brilliant teacher was
And of course, we don't want to leave without, uh, we're not hearing the finale here from our dear friend
But the music can sound a lot like someone's picking up on the background on some of the
It was that they went through a lot of parties in the 16, 70s and in the 60s I had a stereo that you couldn't tell if it was popcorn
Popping, bacon frying or the drum solo from Inagata, Devita
Yeah, that's terrific
Well, we're going to be continuing
And Ed, man, I'll tell you to be continued tomorrow
Here's the first of 16 in a row, on Z4, have a great day and a great life
And just remember our slogan on Z4, don't call us, we'll call you
