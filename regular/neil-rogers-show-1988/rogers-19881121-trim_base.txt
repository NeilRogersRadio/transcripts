We don't want to get you any fresh than more but it's the beginning of a new week.
Hope you have a wonderful weekend.
And this is Thanksgiving week, right?
Yeah.
Thursday.
And we're going to be here every day, right?
I think Mikey said he was going to feed us Thursday.
Oh, not you.
No, I can feed you.
Now, starting this week, I'm not being fed.
I'm on my diet and I'm not going to be fed at all.
So those of you who are going to bring food in, more power to you,
but all I can tell you is that you're going to have to do a great job.
I'll do it.
You're going to have to really eat for two.
Oh, yeah.
These staff that are being prepared to go crazy from now on for the next six months or whatever
is it?
That stuff is over for me for a long time.
Uh-huh.
I think I'm up to it.
I think I'm on board.
Yeah, you've been in training.
Uh-huh.
And this morning I was coming to work and I heard that new FM show in the morning,
man, that is really incredible.
Of course, you can't judge on one day.
We do want to be fed, don't we?
Do we?
No.
Well, no, we want to give them a break.
But let's face it, how many people does it take to do a morning show?
They got about 87 people on there.
That's true.
And what I really loved, I heard like a couple of spots, one in particular.
I don't want to mention Southern Bell, but I heard some ads that wouldn't have been there
if I was there.
And I can just envision a couple of people in the building over there.
Oh, boy.
Isn't it great?
We finally got Southern Bell back because they won't advertise with you.
You know, of course, they're not going to talk about the 80% of the people that are there.
The rest of the business that's going to disappear slowly but surely or rapidly but surely over
the next couple of months.
You mean all the stuff that's already disappeared?
Yeah, that too.
But anyway, good luck to them.
Okay, we certainly wish them all the best of luck with their 75-man show.
And it was pretty music intensive.
Yeah, absolutely.
Pretty music intensive, except when he adheres in in there who's selling his own sports,
I guess.
I guess that's why he wants to be over there.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, good luck to him.
Oh, yeah, he had a spot for U of M football on his sports cast that I was listening to.
And by the way, it wasn't a nice to see them run up the score again on Saturday.
That was good.
44 to three.
Now, if only they'd leave a few of those points for the dolphins we'd have to make.
Yeah, balance.
Yeah, if we could just balance them out.
I know that they might be a little hard-pressed to give up 22 points because 22 to three doesn't,
you know, see when you're competing for that top spot, man.
When they take these polls, 22 points wouldn't get the job done in addition to which it's
pretty hard to score 22 points anyways, isn't it?
Well.
It can be done, but it's a awkward score.
Sort of like being number three, I think.
Yeah, kind of like that.
You know, they could have, if they could have spared four points.
Can I see the thing?
Where is it?
Where's the sports section from the hero?
Because I want to see what the attendance was.
Oh, okay.
Last night.
And of course, we didn't get to see it.
Thank God, because it was blacked out.
But let's just take a little peek.
Catch your blessings, I think.
Okay.
Did they even put it in here?
It says a story on the front page.
It says, Dolphins not dumb.
They stay home.
Oh, yeah.
But that is a 53,526.
Wow.
They'll put it on the front page of the sports section.
Incredible.
So let's see, they had 11,483 no shows.
That's 65.
So yeah, they had about 8 to 10,000 MTC.
I mean, unsold tickets, right?
Well, the great thing was that, you know, ESPN got to run.
We got to see an extra tractor pull.
Yeah, which was that?
Yeah, me too.
I like when we have the games of blacked out.
Okay, it's 9 out of 10 at WIO.
It's in the Arrangeers Monday show.
And slowly, but surely, I don't know what's going on with these people.
But it's like all days on the AM.
We sit down here in most headlines.
See what we would like.
Ultimately, it's starting tomorrow.
We don't want to be pushy, but starting tomorrow, when you sit down here at about 5 to 10,
isn't it good to have every line flashing getting, well, no, not at 5 to 10,
because Mike's still doing his show like it's 10 o'clock when Henry starts the news.
Yeah.
That would be the time.
It's Henry there.
Well, somewhere, somewhere in the, the vowels of the building Henry is hiding.
And speaking of the vowels of the building, wait till you hear the guest on the Bob Kun show this afternoon.
You're on the steam.
King's going to be the guest in the Bob Kun show.
No, Steve has another one of those incredible shows, man.
Anti-sex minister, Dr. Roy Masters.
I think what it should say is homophobia champ, Dr. Roy Masters gay sex fiend Bob Kunst and sexy alien Nadine.
Nadine, I can't wait to meet her.
Who's Nadine?
He's not left over from that show on Friday.
Is she?
I think she's our intern.
Isn't she the one that you're sparing intern?
Oh, that Nadine.
She's an alien, all right.
The one that used to hold up the doorstep.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, we could just stand there leaning in the doorway looking on.
She was getting college credit for it.
That was great.
Well, they made her zero.
They worked, Nadine.
She had to zero it.
Even the Palm Beach lines are lit here this morning.
Oh, boy.
Isn't that enough to make you puke?
Probably, Craig.
And I do know that George Perlis is the coach of Michigan State.
I'm not going to get chewed out on that again because I see the first mobile call is an MSU alumni in the Spartan 64 and 1, right?
Six wins at a row, baby.
How about that, huh?
When they're hot, they're hot and when you're not.
Yeah, they're doing it.
And they're going to be one of the bowl games too.
You know, the great thing about college ball now is everybody's in a bowl game.
You finish in the top 300, man.
You're at a bowl game.
That's right.
Mill, you know, last year about this time when Michigan State was going to Rose Bowl.
Yeah.
I had to call my answer machine.
You heard my wife sing the Spartan fight ball.
That's right.
I remember that.
It was disgusting.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
We're not going to do it this year because you know, Gator Bowl, Rose Bowl, Rose Bowl is much better.
Yeah.
Now listen.
Oh, now who are they going to play Vassar this year or Brown?
They're playing University of Georgia in the hairball.
Georgia?
Yeah.
Oh, man.
Listen, I want to tell you a weird story that happened to me.
And by the way, I want to ask you to call anybody at these bags.
No, we're not going to do that today at all.
We had nothing that Friday to last the lifetime.
It's sad to say that recently I had a family member pathway and it was a grandmother.
And we set up the funeral arrangements.
There are a lot of people.
And she had a bunch of old friends.
Yeah.
They really turned it into a circus.
We rented a couple of limos to take the people to the grey site, you know.
And we had a huge fight at the funeral parlour and who was going to ride in the limo or not.
Wow.
It was unbelievable.
They could have taped it and put it on herolo.
That would have been great.
It was unbelievable.
You've never seen old people fight like this before.
Excellent.
Oh yes I have.
I've been online at Morrison's.
It was horrible.
Anyway, listen, last week when Adolphin played the builds, I was still on the ship around this halftime,
but it's so corticot around.
I looked for the lifeboat and I jumped ship on them.
I'm not at all from that.
Well, you gave them up for land, huh?
Yeah, I gave them up, man.
Okay, well, I'm sure that you're not the only one pal.
But you've got to hang in there, man.
Look at those people in Tampa Bay.
It wasn't nice to see Vinny with another big game yesterday.
Couple of more interceptions and he completed seven out of five thousand or whatever was.
Another big day for Vinny.
Listen, go to Barnes.
Huh?
Okay.
Okay, we'll be up there, man.
We're going to be there in heart.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
In Jacksonville.
What a place to go, huh?
Have you ever been to Jacksonville?
Yes, I have.
That's where I got into this place.
That's where I got drafted.
Really?
Back in the 60s.
So I had very terrible thoughts about that city.
Yeah, I'd be blaming him.
Say, horrendous place.
Yes, it is.
It's a 10-13.
Now, do we have another switch, wrong switch down there again?
Yeah, I just heard that barely sound on the phone.
It's like old time.
And I guess we're trying to sound like Cazeta Ford.
Yeah, it was like Vinne home.
But because I understand from listening that they had some serious problems at the beginning of the show.
Not at Zeta.
Yeah.
Which is very unusual for them.
No, congratulations, Colonel.
Get used to it, baby.
Yeah.
Because you're going to be involved in a technical nightmare that'll make new hair grow in body part on the like on the balls of your feet.
I bet he's real naive and thinks it's going to be today only.
You know, they had technical problems.
What a joke.
Ah, boy.
Good luck to you, Colonel.
Okay, let's go to Bay Harbor.
Hello.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
How about those dolphins?
And we have to do four hour times.
Yeah, we're going to talk about sports this entire day.
They really should have won the game today.
But look, I guess they are.
Would have been should have in the bad call and all of this other, you know, when you score three points, you know in too many games, okay?
That's true.
And when you got a guy like Tony Franklin kicking, I mean, to miss a 28 yard field goal in this day and age takes a certain amount of talent, okay?
And to make it full bad, he holds the record the second longest field goal in the league.
Well, good luck to him because he's going to need it.
That's not the problem.
I know.
It's been done and redone.
Not first.
First.
What?
Let me ask you a question.
You say you were drafted now.
What do you mean by that?
I was drafted in 1968 into the Army, believe it or not.
Oh, I was thinking.
I kept the Vietnamese out of the way.
And now, you know why we lost the war, sir.
I kept the Vietnamese out of Alaska.
I think.
Yeah.
What's interesting?
I was drafted at the height of the Vietnam War, but they didn't send me to NAM.
Oh, thank God.
Good for you.
Okay. Well, listen, have a great day, pal.
When you wake up, give us a call again in a few days.
1015 at WIOD.
I got something I can't wait to play it.
Oh, good.
I'm going to do it now because it just, it's got that like bouncy feeling.
That's the beginning of the week.
Kind of wakes up.
Some of these knee-and-earthals up.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
I'm going to do it now.
All right.
All right.
Well I like that a lot don't you?
Very relatable.
Yeah.
Anyway, we've worked with a lot of boobs
who we've been going to replay that this morning.
1017 at WIO.
We've got a mobile in Palm Beach.
Hello.
Hi Neil.
Yes sir.
How are you?
Doing okay.
Your name was using Vane on Saturday night.
Saturday night?
Want to see Mort Downey Jr.
Oh yeah.
Oh huh.
First thing you said is where's Neil and Steve Kane?
Oh Steve wasn't there either?
No.
Really?
I thought Steve was supposed to be on that show.
He said he was going to be here.
They had the worst guess.
Uh oh.
They were talking about a amendment 11 and whether or not.
Yeah.
They came down here to flagulate the bilingual thing
and start off all over again.
You know, just like Donnie he would did a couple of years ago.
We don't need these carpet vaggers coming into town,
whipping up all the emotion and frenzy
and dividing our otherwise unified and loving community, right?
It was a poor scene.
I mean, they wasn't even televised.
Oh really?
What was it?
Oh yeah, it was just a thing where they charged people to come in
like a three ring circus.
I think there were probably about 2000 people there.
They charged $20 ahead and he split it 50-50,
which means he made $100,000.
Yeah.
For Mort, he really needs it.
You know, he only made $22 million last year.
Well, he needs it because his wife is divorced from them now.
Oh, is that what it, yeah, like I said, he's going to need every dime he can get.
Anyway, it was really bad.
I mean, people were waiting online at what they called to do with a microphone.
They were waiting online for an hour just to say,
why are we're the camera?
The mentality was really poor.
Yeah, well, I'm glad he enjoyed it.
I did not.
I'm just a joke, pal.
Mark Laporte wasn't there, was he?
No, they had, oh, it was a...
Laporte.
Laporte.
I'm not sure what station it was.
A dish jockey from West Palm couldn't have been Lee Fowler.
No, I was, some heavy guy with a beard.
Oh, yeah.
I don't know what his name was.
Yeah, I know that one.
But anyway.
Probably Johnny Rabbit.
Okay, well, listen, thanks for the report,
and don't make the mistake again, okay?
I will not.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, now the next call is kind of interesting.
We're going to have to do our break first,
but the next call says collect from Portland, Maine.
Oh, my God, it couldn't be someone we know.
I doubt it.
Okay, we have an open line in Palm Beach.
If you move quickly, where we just hung up 655, WIOD,
and we're just getting into it now, getting wide awake,
and ready for a really exciting show, right?
Yeah.
Nadine's going to stop in here earlier, I think,
before she's on with Steve.
It's 1020 at WIOD.
1024 at WIOD.
Now, this could be the call of the day.
You realize that collect from Portland, Maine.
Hello.
Good morning, Neil.
Glenn.
Bob.
You don't think anybody from Guy Gennett would be calling you
collect, do you?
No, they're big spenders, man.
They would pay for it.
Well, I just saw their building last night,
though we're number three building.
Yeah.
It's really impressive, isn't it?
Yeah, oh, yeah.
I think they're getting ready to take it.
You should be number one, they shaved two stories off it.
They're getting ready to tear it down, I think.
Yeah.
Well, I called you last week and told you I was coming up.
Are you really there because you sound like you're right next door?
No, I'm really here.
See, these long distance calls at Bounce Off the satellite,
man, these are the connections that are the greatest.
Do we could just talk a long distance?
I know.
The best sounding calls in town, you know?
Yeah.
Listen, is it below zero up there?
No, it's supposed to be high of 40 today.
Oh, great.
Wow.
I'm going to be about 79 or 80 here today.
The sunny shining, it's beautiful.
Yeah, I heard.
Yeah.
I mean, I don't want you to feel bad.
No, I'm flying back in tonight.
I bet you're happy about that.
Not really from what I'm leaving, though.
I bet you that must be a real cosmopolitan town, Portland.
They must be really progressive thinking, um,
really open-minded folks up there, yeah?
Yeah, they are, really.
You know, if you think about it, the downtown area is beautiful
and it's all surrounding water, you know,
it's water surrounding the town.
So it's beautiful up here.
Great.
Well, maybe today will be a good day for some go for a little swim, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah, talk over to the, we're number three building.
Yeah, they're number one.
Make it a suggestion.
Okay, you guys take care.
Okay, have a safe trip now.
Okay.
Boy, he's fine.
Yeah, it really sounds great on these really good calls now.
Anyway, it's 1026 at WIOD.
That has nothing to do with anything that's called, but I'm sure you enjoyed it.
Okay, we have an open line in Broward now.
If you move real quickly at 524 WIOD,
and let's go to Miami Beach, hello.
Hi, Neil.
Hi.
Hi, Glenn.
Morning.
Hi, I'm your previous caller from last.
Our previous caller.
The previous previous, from a long time ago.
I'm a long time listener from when you're on AM.
Mm-hmm.
And I wanted to thank you for wishing me happy birthday.
My name is Nellity, and my boyfriend called and you...
A boyfriend wouldn't be Mike Melody, would he?
No.
But you know in this business, there are a lot of Mike Melody's and a lot of Johnny Rabbits.
Even a few Johnny Darts.
Oh, my God.
But I wanted to thank you for wishing me happy birthday.
I love your show.
I think you guys are great.
And we're still looking for that,
Danny Mardona's song.
Oh, are you really?
Yes, somebody is on the way.
It's on the way.
I don't know why everybody is excited about it, but it's on the way.
It's a great song.
Yeah, I'm excited.
But the rest of the mail gets here in the next three shifts.
It'll probably show up in here somewhere.
We already got a little bit of mail this morning, which I can't believe.
That's very unusual.
But the mail here comes in spurts and starts.
And another great thing that happened today, Melody.
Yes.
You're are you ready for this?
I'm ready.
Well, it really happened yesterday, because I came yesterday to do a little bit of work
and record dub some stuff.
And they've opened the bridge on Semper Life's Recaus Way.
Now, is that the first time in over a year, you're in a half?
Well, I live right down the street from WIOD.
Really?
It's constantly a problem.
And they finally opened it up, and it's great.
The only problem is when I got to it, the bridge was up.
So it's like a mixed bag, you know what I'm saying?
And man, I was sitting there swearing at that bridge tender here.
The slowest molasses.
I know. They're really terrible.
Hello.
But listen, I wish you guys a best.
I love your show.
If you go to any other channel, you can visit.
Now, we're not going to.
We just got here, Melody.
We're not going any place.
But I'll be here a long time, at least another week or two.
I'll be there.
Okay. Thanks, Melody.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Why is emotion watching?
Why is everyone obsessed with that record?
This is the biggest question.
What many are don't it?
Yeah.
I don't even know what the hell it is.
You'll play it one time if that.
Oh, by the way, you're going to hate it.
You're going to hate it or records.
What was it?
It was a Guns and Roses.
Remember the girl was calling it about the drummer and Guns and Roses?
And I looked at the CD, and it's inconclusive.
It's like watching these a prudert film of the Kennedy Center.
It's an interesting comparison.
But I did see the video of Kokomo by the Beach Boys who have a new drummer.
Obviously they got into drummer because Dennis isn't playing the drums anymore.
But now that's an interesting guy.
Oh, well.
Somebody will call in and tell us who that is.
Okay.
Somebody like Rich Pactor, the music expert.
I've never known him.
Now you watch.
He will call today, and then he'll say, oh, well, you invited me to call.
I heard it.
You're right.
You're right.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.

I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
Listen.
I'm not very eye-cicking to the world.
Who we are morning has already arrived and we've simply been
looking around and listening to W needs surprise for some
Who we are, morning has already arrived and scenes blinks and
The fan will See us on screen
to ask whether we're facing up,
you two.
I'm not sure.
Who we are,
you three.
it on the carpet. Of course.
Don cocks.
Don right. You'll put you on the carpet.
Okay. Have a great day.
Bye bye. Try to control yourself now.
Okay. It's 1031 at WIOD
and we have an open line in
brown where we just hung up. If you move
rapidly,
524 WIOD. Everyone seems to be kind of
mellow today. Yeah. I was just thinking that it's funny.
You should say that and also I've got Yamama
so at an appropriate spot during the show,
I'm ready. You can do a little newscast
later on or what kind of work you do. And then of course we'll
eventually get these other people out of the show.
They don't know it yet.
Can you imagine how many people it takes to do that morning show
over there? And of course their
comeback would be, well we can get a half a dozen people for what we were
paying you. Yeah, that's true.
At about a third of a point of peace, it ought to be really good.
Seriously, I mean, why do they need so many people?
And especially because they're playing so much music.
Got me. I mean a lot of music. A lot of that same. In fact, I punched
them up yesterday and what do you think they had a block of which group?
I'll give you 20 guesses. CCO. Yeah. I guess it's on the first
class. You don't have to have a lot of guesses on that station.
Oh, what is that? Rollin. Rollin. Man, they were just and I just punched that thing off so
fast and I made guttural sounds and just spit blood all over the radio.
1032 at WIOD.
Oh, and somebody needs to talk desperately soon in Paran. Well,
I can understand living there. Hello. I'm depressed already. What do you want,
Phil? This town is a battlefield. I own the old car in my parking lot
and my apartment building. Is battery do they steal? They steal my.
They stole your battery. So I had a call you to get pumped up for the week.
I got to tell you you're the king. And you know, what do I do about these people?
How about shooting them? That would be a good start. Yeah, then I'd be really
depressed at behind bars. You know, and I wouldn't be able to call you.
Listen, they don't have time to put your way in this town. Okay, they're good because
you would lot about their stuff. Yeah, but I couldn't get to a phone and call you.
They have these massive ongoing investigations of really important stuff.
Yeah, I know what they're important stuff is. Yeah. So everything's great here,
pounded. Okay. Yeah. Well, now I am. Okay. I had to get that fixed.
Well, that's good. I can't. Got it off. I can't.
You're excellent. Okay, you have a good one now. I'm going to listen. Wait,
maybe they'll steal the tires tonight. They probably will because the car can go
nowhere now. Okay. Good luck to you, bye, bye, bye. And that's good.
Like the guy who called from a parking ride the other day. Remember after the last
week's debacle? Oh, yeah. And his car stolen after all the other night.
What happened? Oh, what? Well, that's what happens. You know, but that's why it's
exciting. And I just don't understand why this town can't fill up the stadium.
Man, it's embarrassing. It is embarrassing. Right. They're playing crappy ball.
And there were five and seven. And it's just more and more morbid each week.
But that's no excuse. Now they played. They played in Tampa Bay
yesterday. Can I have that again? They played because the bears beat the crap
out of me even with Tom's act. In fact, Tom's acts like 13 and 2 lifetime is
starter for the bears. I don't want to get too deep into this.
But, okay, let me see. Let me take a look. Tampa Bay in Chicago. It's got to be in
here somewhere, folks. But here it is. Okay. Bear is 27. Bucking years 15.
Attendance 67,000 70 in Tampa Bay. Wow. Which is 14,000 more
than what we had here last night. And the box, the box are two and 10.
They're worse. Right there. Well, no, they're not the worst. But I think they're
no, they're three and nine. They're a game better than Green Bay and Dallas.
Three and nine. But still, can you imagine if the dolphins were three and nine?
What the crowd would have been last night? I don't want to keep going on this because
nothing we say is ever going to change that. It's still a bush league town. And
it's always going to be a bush league town. And that's just the way folks like it,
I guess. Anyway, Henry Burrow agrees that it's a bush league town. Henry,
Henry, a standing by with the WIOD news update. It's 1035. Right.
Now, because that's what this town needs is more classic crock more often.
Yeah. More music. Much more often.
Oh, and he played the doors this morning too. And I like the doors. Don't get me wrong.
But I think they're re-verting back to their origins. You know, when they were
doing about a one two, what is that? Well, I have a question and I'm looking at the
call to charts from yesterday. Now, for your birthday this year, I gave you a
horse racing analyze. Yes. And I would take out to Gulfstream when Gulfstream
opens. I would feel much more confident about picking these horses if you could
bring that in here. And we could play with it. You don't understand. You can't
program that from the newspaper. You have to have the racing for.
Oh, okay. Well, I'm still with you. Much more confident.
So we gave the man who gave you a horse that finished dead last Friday, by the way.
I told you at least led till until the eighth pole and then puked. But and she just
stopped to a walk gallery. A girl. Uh huh. Well, that's the least she led most of the way.
Okay. Well, I told you I didn't have a strong feeling about your horse was dead last.
Was never in it. Was gasping for oxygen. And if anybody's going to go to a certain
hamburger, joy at noon. Okay. Anyway, it's 1039. Let's go to Boka next. Hello.
Hey, do you know what? Okay. Hey, glad. Hi. Well, last Christmas, I was shopping at
Bloomingdale. Blooming is in Boka. And I went up to the second floor and I happened to be
walking past the dress department. Really? Yeah. And another one is he just happened to be walking
past the dress department. Who I saw in there with another guy. Oh, boy.
After going to have. How many guesses do we get? Is the first name being in with an A?
You are so good. It's not funny. Oh, my. That's what they always say.
Not Alice. It is true. Alice in the dress department is that as an Alison gown department.
Alice Blue Gown. Alice claims he doesn't do that. Well, he may have just been going to try one on or something.
I don't know. Oh, yeah. By the way, uh, just a joke, Alice. The drummer for the Beach Boys is also the guy on
the full house. The TV show full house. I don't know from full house. Yeah.
They're writing one of those. He's like, he also used to be in a John hospital. What is a full
way to mean? You don't mean blacky. Yeah. John Stamos is the drummer for the Beach Boys.
He's been touring with him. That sounds weird. Well, I looked a little bit like him. Now, they always
show you these distant shots. Anybody who looks good, you see it a distant shot. You know,
people like Michael Love who look like the bottom of your shoe. You see a lot of closeups of people
like that. But well, we'll check that out. That's interesting. And I just want to remind
everybody that Rick Siderman is a fashion.
Have a nice day, sir. Good day. What a call. Incredible.
Boy, from Bloomingdale's to Rick Siderman, we sure touched all the bases there.
I didn't wait. And don't forget on Steve's can try and show this afternoon. Wow.
Anti-sex minister, Dr. Roy Masters, Bob Kunst. I'm just reading what it says gay sex
scene. Yeah. And sexy alien Nadine who got tired of holding up the door.
It's a four spot. If they put Nadine into that show too, then they've got John and Nadine
and Ron and Mark and Mike and Moishi. And my god, they got, they replaced us with about 40 people
over there. Well, what is that? Does that tell us anything? So they can play all of that classic rock.
How many people does it take to stick a CD in a player?
A stupid engineer. And from what I heard, I didn't hear the beginning of the show,
obviously, but I understand they were having a problem with those CD machines again.
That's a surprise. I know that comes as a great shock to me.
Because during the year that we were on that station, man, they had technical accomplishments
that even Mark Coney would have been embarrassed by. Okay. Incredible.
I mean, stuff that you wouldn't believe every morning, the first couple of months.
Hello, are we on the air? Hello? Hello? Hello?
They now, the calls down to once here today on Friday or whatever day and one call today.
The first one. Hey, the first one was a picnic compared to what we used to.
Oh, yeah. No question. Okay. Let's not, let's not look backward.
Okay. Let's look forward. Although it is kind of fun to rip their guns out.
You know, because they deserve it. Hollywood. Hello? Hello? Yes.
Neil. Yes. No warning. How are you doing?
What do you mean, no warning? You didn't even say anything. You just cut in on me.
Well, that's the idea. I like to catch you when you're off-balance.
When you're starting to not off a little bit. That's when we like to punch you out.
Okay. How you doing, Bird? Just great.
And before you get your thoughts together, then by that time you're gone already.
Are you going to be okay? I'll make it up my day.
Okay. Good. I'm going to put up with these old bitties.
Yeah. And then on my part-time job, I get, get them on the weekend.
We had four eight, four parties of eight at the same time. You know, you would have loved it.
I mean, bad at it. They all had turkey. Yeah. I mean, oh, God. Anyway.
What should have been easy to doctor the food if you'd have been thinking of it?
They all put in. They wanted potatoes. They didn't want rice. They wanted to gravy.
That's the one great thing about the old Fartsman. No matter what restaurant it is,
they're always, and it can say on the menu an enormous big block letters.
No substitutions, please. Yeah. Don't confuse them with that.
Okay. Because they're going to have their substitutes.
No, no. I don't want them as potatoes. Can I have hash browns? Can I have gravy on my puppet?
Did they send everything back? No, not everything.
Uh-huh. What percentage would you say? I would say 40 to 50%.
Yeah. That's pretty good. That's bad. Yeah.
And the point part was we sent the same thing back and they ate it.
Yeah. Yeah. Always. Well, as long as you give them the feeling that they're satisfied,
that they created a scene and they made your life miserable. That's all of count.
That's right. I'm, by the way, Neil, I'm one of the MFM converts too.
I guess I'm in the late 20s now. Yeah.
Can I tell you that?
Good. Fantastic. Number 26.
26. Yep.
And we're moving rapidly toward 30, man. Good deal. Good deal.
Bird. Yes, sir.
What, uh, what round were you drafted in?
A round? What is that being?
He was in 18th round draft choice by the Dalaii. Yeah.
Yeah. That's it. That's it. Okay.
Okay. Have a good way. Wait, Neil.
Yeah. Um, I like to make a request. My brothers ran from out of state.
They haven't heard their, their virgins to the Neil Rogers. Uh, uh, uh, you know,
I would wonder if you could play either a Neil headroom or a young Neil preferably young
Neil. Oh, no. Young Neil's too long.
Oh, it goes on. But bird is long.
The birth of the bird. I mean, that is classic.
You don't play it enough. That's true. If you get fitted in sometime today,
I'd appreciate it. Okay. We'll see if we can fit it in sometime today.
You're a great American. Okay. Bye-bye.
What? He's pushy people and pushy. They all want something.
What is that? Manila Bob? That sounds like a horse had called her tomorrow.
Uh, hello. Hello, Neil. Yeah. All right. This is Bob. I don't know if you remember
what I called you collect from Manila. Oh, this is the guy that gave our address to all those
young ladies who were writing a pen pal. Of course not.
Go ahead and I thought you loved Oriental. Well, we did get some good pictures, Bob,
for my collection. He did save some of the great pictures.
Listen, I did not put your name on the bathroom wall.
Okay. You said that was the problem, Bob.
Why do we are later going to be giving the telephone number for the restroom at Epcot?
I'm serious. I got it right here.
Congratulations on your move. Thank you.
I drive around all day. I listen to you and one thing I want to tell you.
If you can do me a favor, can you call out how?
Oh, no. Don't start. No. Not today, Bob. Come on. Give it a rest.
Okay. No douchebag today. You can call anybody whatever you want,
but I'm not doing it. Okay. How are you douchebag?
Okay. Can you have to me a question?
What's that for? How many hens in Glenn's name?
How nice day. How is everyone obsessed with this call, by the way?
No, I mean, every day, every single day, let's get serious already.
Like once a month would be good for him. We have an open line in Boka.
I just mentioned this in passing 278 WIOD. No pressure.
If you don't want to use it, we're not going to get upset.
Like dropped it. Okay. No, I do have the men's tea room number at Epcot here.
And I remember when we called, we may call it a little later on. See what happens.
Remember when I called that? Sure. Nobody answered.
We were writing an exciting call. Yeah.
Yeah. My best. They were busy.
And we got the hotline at Y100 here at WHQT hot 105.
Or is it not so hot 105?
Here is a Paul Isle answering machine. I wonder what the message is on here.
Wow. That could be really exciting. We'll save that for a little later in the show.
1047 at WIOD Miami. Hello. Hi. Yeah. Neil? Yes. Yes, we are. Yeah. Hi.
Hey, what's for lunch today? Is it good? For lunch today? Yeah.
Birds got a little sandwich here and I'm on my diet today. So nothing exciting.
Oh, no, nothing exciting. We have Thai food coming in that I'm not going to be participating.
Now that's exciting. That is exciting. My face. I am doll up there.
And a lot of day old. It's not that thing.
What? That's true. Listen, let me say this to you. Whether it's fattening or not, I'm honest diet.
And I'm only going to eat certain. And by the way, my mother is listening.
I'll be calling her with the bad news. I'm not going to be coming for dinner.
Oh, my. And maybe I'll come next week and bring my little container and let her prepare it.
But I'm not going to screw around this time. I'm going to do it.
And all these people that give us. Well, it's okay. It's not too bad. I'm not interested.
Okay. Do you understand what I'm saying?
They want to be surly about it. But that's just the way it is.
Does anyone have your own agency stand a barb?
No. The, um, buddy?
The bunny? No, buddy. That's what his name is.
Yeah, what about him? Um, well, you've got it like he's like.
Like God. If you've got to see him like it's it's a. It's imperative.
Well, what time is that show? Come on. Doesn't the channel four curated 11 or something?
Yeah. Well, he's going to be on it like after 11 30 today.
How do you know that? Have you got the script?
No, but I like I thought I said on channel five Friday.
Well, wait a minute. That's on channel four, right?
I don't know. It's on channel one.
It's on channel five at the regular time like 3 o'clock.
Oh, I see. But it's on channel four at 11.
Like delayed. Yeah. One day. Oh, right. I see. I got you.
So that's all I know. He's going to be on there.
You channel four on there. Let's turn off this damn thing here. Wait a minute.
Well, now Neal's going over to the television set we have in here.
Oh, it's and he like he's like it's better than to see.
Is that possible? It's better than to see better than crystal like remember the guy who was on
on another world like he's called himself crystal like.
Well, I don't want to. Well, anyhow, listen to the company. Oh, by the way, Stephanie was back on on days.

How you doing? Neil. Okay. That is John Stan with the plays with the beach.
It will be damned. He plays with the beach boys. Huh? Well, he he there's on the video.
It is a science is not a beach boy. But I guess he's playing with him. He was in the movie.
Uh huh. I'll be damned cocktail. I recognize. I knew that it was somebody I'd seen before.
Right. I'm always I'm always so busy looking at Elizabeth shoe in that video. I never have time for much more.
I caught the morning Sean Zeta this morning from 545. What did you put it in a Mason jar?
Yeah. I should have. I listened right up until they played that new classic rock song the national anthem. Yeah.
And I didn't understand how that fit in. That's about when I turned it off.
I'll tell you one thing man. They're playing so damn much classic rock now. Just great.
I don't do we know where the kernel is. He can't be from this area. What do you mean he can't be from this area?
It's like from right over next door here. He used to do mid days on really. What are you talking about?
Where have you been hiding in a cave? I'm at home. Oh yeah. That's not a lot of. Okay. That's no problem. Now we understand.
All right. We'll see you later. Okay. I guess he got embarrassed. Well, he knew when the radio 1054 at W. I. O. D. will go to Hollywood. Hello.
Yeah. Neil. Yes. I just want to regulate your plantation. Believe me. I'm screwed.
It's unrightfully. They've been out like crazy lately. Doing what?
What's radar and so forth. Hey, I got news for it's not just the plantation pigs. It's everywhere. They're all over.
In fact, FHP this weekend was in a frenzy and I'll guarantee you the next few days now that it's Thanksgiving.
They always wait till the holidays till they know that everybody can't afford a ticket.
You know, they got to take the money and go out and buy trimmings and turkey and stuff like that.
And they nail everybody's ass on a holiday. So this next few days it's going to be brutal.
Yeah, but plantation is I mean, you know the new Peters Road. It's extension they've made the new roading.
They've been out there at night. No lights on in the drive through in the pasture of the cut through.
Yeah, they do that everywhere. I mean, they do that. They do that a brown bull of art just west of Pine Island.
There's a little little tiny bit of mud or whatever the hell it is and they sit in there.
Somebody ought to like wet it down so they get stuck in a mud. I'm wondering if you made a turn and hit one of them with it.
No lights on it. That you'd be responsible. I don't know. I wouldn't take the chance.
No, no, you'd probably get light. Yeah, got a great sense of humor.
That's only for traffic. Yeah, okay. Well, listen, have a wonderful life. Thank you. Bye-bye.
1055 at WIOD. And let's go to a four-letter deal. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yeah. How you doing? Okay.
Yeah, Tom. Hey, did you go Friday night? I looked all over Friday night. Did I go to one?
See old Greg Luganis. You didn't know. Greg Luganis. Oh, you didn't find out what day.
First of all, I wouldn't have gone anywhere to see Greg Luganis. Tom, what is your story? What is your story, Tom?
I wouldn't go to see Greg Luganis. I don't know what you're talking about.
You wouldn't go to the fashion model. No. Oh, that's right. He was. What?
Oh, I can't wait to find out exactly when Greg Luganis was going to be at the fashion model. Right.
Blumber. Anyway, I just called to see what is that. What does Tom? What does that mean? I don't understand. What does that mean?
He's worth taking a look at. Great. Well, listen, I'm telling you. Just watch the swimming stuff on TV. Okay. He's under all the time.
Hour after hour in his bathing suit, I'm sure at the fashion model he all has clothes on. Oh, no. Now, in fact, the auction off is speedo.
Speedo as in suit. Oh, I see. I didn't. I wasn't quite sure exactly what that is. I'm not under that bathing suit lingo. You know, you know, in that diving lingo.
How about if I said box or you would understand that? That would have been a little better. Yeah. I don't want you to get so emotional now, Tom. He's just a piece of a hunk of flesh, you know.
I know there's so many in the world. That is correct. Hey, remember a couple of months ago. We got every, every queen in the phone here today. What is this, Tom?
Is this something special going on that I don't know about? Oh, it's a national coming out week must be. Yeah, remember a couple months ago, you had a contest.
You were calling on the phone and like questions that you answered on the phone.
I remember this time, man. I'm telling anybody need some instant help. Are you okay? Are you sure you got the right show?
Oh, he's got the right show. He just, he just not all himself. He missed the Miss Greg Luganus. And he's not going to be never be the same again. Well, listen, if I were you, I turned on channel four right now and watch Santa Barbara.
Okay. Well, I'm still going to try and figure out what to serve with. What vegetable tonight? Yeah. Okay. All right. I'd like to talk to you, Tom.
Holy Toledo. It's embarrassing. Boy, would you call this like this first hour has flown by as in five by night? Absolutely.
Now, see in a second here, you'll see what channel this is because they're given the credits and the show is over. Okay. Well, I know that about I know that about TV that when the credits come on.
And I wasn't sure I wanted to make sure I know when the show ends. That's when they come on with a little spot. I got in there'll be a station break.
Yeah. No, I'll tell you what channel. There'll be probably a commercial or two. And then if you see me jump. Now see at CBS, that's a very good home. And that probably is channel four unless we're getting something from the States.
And it's hard to tell these days. Yeah. Okay. 1058. Let's go to beautiful Lake Forest. Hello. Hello. Yeah. Hey, bird. Yes, sir.
Herb to make me were promoting all day today. Oh, what they say? Well, they got this turkey bowl and coming up Thursday morning. Oh, yeah.
People got to bring in birds and so we're all covered. Yeah. Everybody's bringing in birds and you know, if the thing's going to be okay. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Stop stealing herb to make these material like what? That Robbie rubber song or something? Hey, listen, they they loaned it to us. Yeah. I know. Seriously. I got inside source and they don't know how you got it.
They don't know. Well, they weren't here. Somebody else loaned it. This is channel. And if we wanted again, we'll go in there and get it again. Okay. It's good play. We don't want to be pushy, but well, we're ready for it. We want it. We'll have.
Listen about the dolphins. I was at playoff at sports ball that Steve Boyheng on it. Yeah, they had it on cable and they're like two miles from the stadium. Well, I'll be damn. All our cheap skate friends were there. They don't want to pay the $26.
Yeah. Well, it sure must have been entertaining evening. Okay. Y'all have a good day now and call us again some year. Well, listen, we're at the end of this hour. Boy, these flavor crisps.
And I've only had like a dozen of them because you can only have so many. These are excellent. They really are, especially in lieu of anything else, man. It's fantastic. Okay. Henry Burrow standing by with more WIOD news, whether you wanted or not. And then we're going to come back at 1105 for our number two.
And in the next hour with this audience, please butch up just a little bit.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
He's no longer with us.
Oh, God, he's no longer with us.
God, my God, he's no longer with us.
Oh, my God, he's no longer with us.
Oh, my God, he's no longer with us.
But my daddy is no longer with us.
But my daddy is no longer with us.
My daddy is no longer with us.
My daddy is no longer with us.
He wears your ass.
My fizzlers, six feet forward swing ahead.
He's free for swimming around so far there.
Oh, my daddy is no longer with us.
My daddy is no longer with us.
And he'll reach my daddy everywhere.
Kind of a country flavor to show this morning, you notice?
It's 1107 at WIOD.
We're back for our number two.
We have Santa Barbara on the Sony.
That wasn't even Channel 4, by the way, before we saw CBS come on.
And right away I said, hey, we know we're on the right channel.
Which channel six?
I told you you can't tell in this market anymore.
Not until January.
That's right.
Which side is up?
Anyway, we managed to find the right one.
And as soon as we saw Pam Salisby, we knew it was Channel 4, okay?
Eight minutes after 11 at WIOD,
we got a couple of power lines that are suspiciously vacuished at the moment.
At 524, WIOD, we'll go to Boca.
How you doing, Neil?
I'm hearing anybody.
How you feeling today?
Listen, I got a couple of reports.
First of all, on the saw grats, watch out for those cops.
They hide in the certain area.
And as you drive past, if you're speeding, it looks like I was in this one occasion.
And I don't blame myself for this.
But they have a speed trap there and the cops just pick you up after the speed gun goes off.
So kind of keep us sharp eye on the saw grats.
Sharp eye on the saw grats, all right?
Okay.
I think I ran over with sharp eye on the saw grats a couple of weeks ago.
Go ahead.
Listen to Ernie Show about two weeks ago.
He had talked about sweet and low, right?
And the days when you guys were on WINZ.
He said a week before you started your sweet and low thing.
He had gone through the routine.
He had said that nobody was interested.
Then all of a sudden, you went through the routine.
That is correct.
And it was Ernie to know how to do it.
That was a free plug.
I just wanted to verify this.
That's right.
He told that story enough.
He told a story about 4,000 times.
Well, you know, when you develop an audience of people who live on sweet and low,
why would Ernie's audience respond to that?
They think it's perfectly normal.
Let's go back into their body parts.
Okay, three is the...
Did the birth do any newscasts?
Because I heard Friday he was supposed to be...
No, he's going to get a little...
It's coming up. Just try to control yourself.
I'm going to keep it everything in place.
When the mood strikes us and we have enough time to squeeze it in here, we'll do it.
Okay, and finally, I've been going to the Pompo-no Park the last time.
I know you don't like to talk that much about Pompo-no Park.
You know, they've been stepping in some...
But do you keep track on harness racing at all?
Not on Pompo-no Park, no.
Do you have any tips when you go spend the night there?
When you go to spend the night there?
Yeah, take along your pajamas and maybe your toothbrush.
That should be a good idea.
It does.
As far as predicting horses, because they have nothing there as far as predicting the program is useless and only picks the favorite.
There's two sheets that they sell on the outside are totally pathetic.
They don't pick any winters or anything.
And then the old people always mugging your friends and take a look at your sheet and then...
I end up missing five or six of the rates.
That's the way they're at home, they do a lot of old people on look at your sheet.
All right, now let's take care.
Okay, have a good day now. Just bet I'm Bill Fahey, okay?
Thank you very much. You'll take care of you.
Okay, bye-bye.
Wow, these people today, I'm not sure what their story is.
Look at all the open lines all of a sudden.
We were doing great.
When the news cast came up at the top of the hour, like about two thirds of the colors disappeared.
Now, and they usually come back.
You don't think so?
You don't think they ran out to the store to buy batteries, do you?
I don't think not today.
Okay.
Anyway, in Dade County, 751 WIOD and in Broward, 524 WIOD.
Maybe they turned on Santa Barbara.
Maybe that was a bad idea.
Especially this crowd.
Well, you don't need the sound on this show.
We don't have the sound. You don't need it.
And this douchebag on here, he used to be the one with the mustache and the beard.
Oh, God.
He used to be on another world or something.
You notice how these people like interchange?
Yeah. And it's like musical chairs.
They just shifted around from one show to another.
It's like this, jockeys.
Yeah, pretty much the same.
It's not Miami, hello.
Hi there, Neil. How you doing?
Hi there, Bertie.
Hi there.
I don't think I answered a birdie.
How you doing, Bertie?
Oh, hi, fine.
Neil, I just want...
I got a Santa Barbara brawn here.
Yeah.
And is this the guy they're talking about?
No, this isn't the guy, but just keep watching it.
Okay, I'm not talking any more queens today.
I've had enough.
And Steve has got Bob Quinn on today.
That should be our quota for the day.
Okay, I'm not talking any more of these limperists.
I'm serious.
What is the show turning into, man?
This is the beginning of our third week.
Everything's been going great.
And all of a sudden, AirBee Boyth today found like this.
What is that all about?
I mean, we don't want to discriminate.
Look at this.
Here's a cross dressing call from Keeper's Game coming up.
I don't like it.
No, let's get serious.
Okay, let's try to put this show up at least one or two degrees.
Okay?
Yes.
Man, what are the guys in sports talk going to be saying tonight?
When you're in Barras, it really shows up.
Yeah, that's how you're going.
All right, let's take a break and see if we can't put you up
at least two or three degrees next to this crowd.
It's 11-12 at WIOD.
Hello, I'm Saul.
And I'm Harry.
Here to tell you about a special place.
Here's the short little star.
From New York is the Poke No.
Let's go.
That's where I want to go.
I get away from it all.
There was that in the Poke No.
He can feel damn big.
I thought that stuff.
I got a nine.
Go for Saturday brunch.
Or for the food on top of your dish.
I hope it's kosher.
In the Poke No.
Skytop and Barclay.
Camel, back in Worshield.
Mount Ellie and Johnny.
They're even Mickey Rooney.
I know.
Slidrock and Tesco.
Oh, okay, let's go.
Poke it in the Poke No.
We'll have some lunch and then we'll see our show.
Ristone Orlando.
In the Poke No.
Get a hot shake of time.
You put a champagne.
Sit by the pool and act like a club.
Let's get the chicks.
You get me a nice girl.
Over by the exercise club.
Hey, cue the obey.
In the Poke No.
Skytop and Barclay.
Camel, back in Worshield.
Mount Ellie and Johnny.
Don't forget Mickey Riny.
Slidrock and Tesco.
Oh, we let's go.
Poke it in the Poke No.
We'll have some lunch and then we'll see our show.
Ristone Orlando.
In the Poke No.
Let's go.
If I get to teach it to you.
I know I got my teaching in the little bag with the water in the effort.
In the effort and in the effort and today again, it's a lot of 17 in the effort and city.
Now, if you see the video, the Beach Boys video of Kokomo and then you hear this,
then it has like a little extra meaning.
I see.
You know what I'm saying?
Have you seen the video?
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, let's go back to the calls now.
Let's take our lives in our hands and go to Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
I am.
Yes.
The editorial page on the Miami Herald mentions about the art style.
It says it has a priest named Rubio and he's a sex molester of children.
And now they're sending them over to a year in the sabbatical.
I'm disgraceful.
Yeah.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
First you get down on your knees.
Okay.
It's 11-18.
At WIOD.
I'm telling you that church man, they got a sense of humor or what?
In fact, they would kind of fit right into the way the show has been going today.
Yeah.
Anyway, we've got Dolphins info from Boynton Beach.
Well, this could, this, not wait a minute, they hung up.
Thank God.
Oh boy, let's count our bless.
Yeah.
Thank God for that.
Wow.
Okay.
We have an open line in date where that geriatric Neanderthal just hung up about 10 seconds ago.
751 WIOD.
Man, we started out great this morning.
You know what?
Yeah.
And the ones were lit up like instantly and everything was going along for about 45 minutes.
And man, it about 10 to 11 right around there.
We hit a brick wall.
By the way, we don't need any Dolphins information.
We don't need any more talk about the Dolphins or about Tony Franklin or about Marino or any of that.
Okay.
In fact, tonight, six o'clock, I'm sure that there'll be a lot of gnashing a teeth on sports talk and everybody be hysterical.
Call in and go crazy.
Okay.
Leave us alone.
Please.
Now see these people keep calling on that line eight and they, we put them on first every time.
Why?
I don't know because we feel sorry for them because it calls from Fort Pierce.
I'm not going to do it.
I'll let them wait a while.
Let's take the cross dressing call from Kibis Gain.
Hello.
Good morning, Neil.
Yeah.
This is a fire report.
I don't know if anybody's ever told you last week I was listening to Al and he was talking about cross dressing and drag.
Great.
Terrific.
Oh, well.
In other words, he didn't want to skirt the issues.
That what you said.
He was talking about you.
Yeah.
And he said that what would Neil look dressed up as a woman?
And he said you would look like a white Nell Carter.
Yeah, we already had that all of Friday.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know.
It was just as amusing on Friday as it is today.
Well, I'm not.
Okay.
No, that don't take it personally.
Don't get sensitive.
No.
I don't know.
You know, Alice is out of control and obviously paranoid about what's going to happen over there when the next book comes out.
So good luck to her.
Okay, I got another information for you.
Front of mine, work production for the Elton John video.
Mm-hmm.
When you like a lot.
Oh, yeah.
Most of those dancers are just young Cuban kids here from Miami.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, that's what I had the feeling that was true.
Yeah, they're just local, a lot of them are in dance classes and things.
They're in what?
Dance classes?
Yeah.
Like at UM?
Yeah, and all around at different ballet classes and stuff.
Okay, well, we'll be sending our search party out today, okay?
Okay, good luck.
We'll find it later.
We'll let you know.
Oh, there he went.
Real quick, please.
Okay, two open lines in Dade County, 751, WIOD, is the audience is working.
See on Monday, you used to start when we did the morning.
Mm-hmm.
They would start out very, very slow.
Yeah, a couple of hours of prodding, they would finally make a comeback.
And it's sort of similar here.
Is that what you're saying?
No, it's not.
No, what I'm saying here, it started out great.
Oh, it's like being iterated by every minute.
Well, you're right.
Pretty soon, I'm going to pick up a phone and it's going to go like that.
Mm-hmm.
Ask Al if he can say, talk net.
What does that mean?
It's a note from Nick on there.
I have no idea what that means.
We'll find out.
Okay, let's take a call from Fort Pierce and Bray.
Breakdown already.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yeah.
Yeah, I just first of all want to let you know, it's a brother-law introduced me to your show about three months ago and I've I've converted up here.
Great.
It's a great show.
I heard a gentleman call in a few minutes ago about the incident in the restaurant with the elderly people.
Mm-hmm.
And I just wanted to know your opinion.
I want all of them out there to listen.
There's a wife and I were in a restaurant here a few weeks ago.
And the couple, they're dying in two couples are dying together.
They get through.
They didn't bother to tell the waitress they wanted separate checks.
And then when they finally got the separate checks, we're still waiting to get out of the place.
And they fight and they fight and fight and finally we found out the whole fight was over.
Is that one of the parties had an extra drink on their ticket that the other party should have paid for.
And it just irritated the hell out of me that one of them wouldn't just say no problem.
I'll pay for you're my friend.
Why can't I pay for it?
Had your therapy a lot.
I mean, I want them all to listen to understand that.
Okay.
I'm glad you got out of your system.
Feel better now.
I feel wonderful.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
Bye bye.
Now listen, I had, we always pick under French Canadians.
Mm-hmm.
And justifiably so because they're cheap.
They're disgusting.
They drive under 10 miles an hour and they just make them make a mess out of this town every year for about three, four months.
That's right.
But I'm going to tell you something.
The other Canadians are no picnic either.
And I've been seeing a lot of Ontario plates lately.
Usually you see these Quebec plates like crazy.
This year for some reason a lot of Ontario plates.
Of course.
They couldn't drive their finger in their earlobe.
Okay, that's how good they drive.
And this morning I used the turn pipe to come to work.
Okay.
It was great.
No big long lines at the toll booth.
And there were about three, four cars ahead of me.
Mm-hmm.
Unfortunately, the car right in front of me had an Ontario plate.
And it was this old, old, old, old, old.
Methusel like couple.
And God only knows what they gave at the toll booth.
It probably was like, you know, 55 cents.
And they gave him a $10 bill.
Yeah.
And the guy gives them change.
Now, evidently, he had singles.
Okay, didn't have a five.
Yeah.
Now they're sitting there and keep in mind it's rush hour.
I'm not saying it's all jammed up.
But there's people behind me.
And just about everybody's got to go to work or someplace.
They're sitting there counting the damn change.
Oh, God.
Oh, I mean, it's one thing to be feeling the change.
But to be counting the change.
Oh, what an idea.
And I laid on that horn, man.
And all of a sudden he woke up and took off like a bat out of hell.
You know what?
About two miles an hour.
It's like when you see that Ontario.
Go back to Canada.
Okay, hear me thinkin' one of you.
Go watch hockey night in Canada or something.
Get outta here.
When you see that license plate, it's like a light bulb goes on.
Oh, man.
They can't drive.
They can't drive.
We can't talk about slow and cheap and just, man, what they bring here.
The only thing they bring here are hemorrhoids.
That's the only thing they contribute to this town.
Anyway, it's 1124 at WIOD.
We'll come right back.
I know that the Zord even loves Neil Rogers.
It's 1127 at WIOD.
Now, that's a good question.
Is that a guy in drag?
Yeah.
Looks like we gone.
Looks very fast, Rella.
Okay, those of you who want to do a little homework here,
you can turn on Santa Barbara on Channel 4.
And watch along.
Okay.
Because this last half hour is supposed to be the real momentous occasion.
Oh.
All edged.
All days for this to happen.
I know.
Okay.
Well, we'll get it out of our system all in one day.
Let's go to Inverary.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Hi.
How are you?
Okay.
Hi, Glenn.
Hi.
Sorry, my voice is so rough.
I was at the game that we don't want to talk about last night.
That is correct.
So I'll talk to you about...
What were you yelling about last night?
Because I always yell on the...
I don't care if they went out of the loose.
I just scream at everybody.
I understand that.
You know, we're in a great section though.
They're a real rowdy.
So I definitely let my vocal cords do the talking, I say.
But I wanted to tell you, I go down to the keys on the weekend
and we pick you up wonderfully down there.
You know, that's what everybody says.
They say this station booms into the keys.
This is the beginning of our third week we have yet to have a call.
From the keys.
From anybody in the keys.
And they can call, collect.
They can call right now either of those Palm Beach lines.
I'm going to tell them.
I'm going to tell them.
I'm going to tell them because I were working a dive stop down there
and we just boom it out.
And this is like, they are being converted in the EEL
because they don't...
They listen to the country station down there.
Oh, that's the only two stations.
And that's it.
Yeah.
You would think they would listen to Miami radio.
Well, they don't pick it up.
I mean, I can't...
You can't pick up any of the FM stations down there.
Right, we know that.
And...
And WS didn't go down there.
No, no.
I didn't cover Miami.
No, that FFG, I guess, is the country one in the keys.
Nice to see you.
Okay.
It's one on the one.
But I'm a first time caller and I would never listen to A-N before.
Well, that's great.
You believe it?
25 years down here and I listen to the A-N.
Isn't that something?
We really feel like we made quite an accomplishment.
If we ever get a call from the keys, it'll really be great.
I'm not going to hold my breath.
Because I've had this on every station ever.
When I was on Wins, it was the same thing and then when I was on FM.
And I'll hear and regardless of whether the signal is good, bad or mediocre,
they just...
There's something about those people in the keys, man.
They are not into whatever we're into.
They're not into 1988 yet.
They're into what we've been down there, yeah.
They're a little passive, yeah.
Well, you're just listening to Ron Harrison.
So, you know, what do you expect?
Oh, my.
You know, exactly.
Exactly.
That's what I say, too.
Oh, my.
That's why I don't listen to A-M radio.
Okay, well, listen, you have a great day now.
Okay, you too.
Bye-bye.
It's 11.30 at W-I-O-D.
And we're still checking out Santa Barbara.
And, boy, if that's a guy, we're in big trouble.
That's a guy used to be on another world.
That's something good.
Another squirrel.
And Stefan always back on the days of our lives, man.
You sell popper people.
You must be a rough couple of weeks.
They're going nuts.
They're bringing back all these dead characters.
Wow.
Too great.
They can only do that on TV.
Well, if you listen to South Florida radio,
I don't want to mention our friend, the Dean,
but that should give you something to think about.
Yeah.
Okay, car phone in Palm Beach.
Hello.
Yeah, hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Listen, how's your diet coming?
Boy, it's great, man.
I'm telling you, I'm sitting here and I'm feeling great.
Hey, listen, is this going to be a Christmas present for all of us
when Steve does an interview with you on how your diet's doing
and how much better you feel when you lose all your weight?
No.
That's going to be something else.
No, let me say it again.
No.
That would be in the Ainals of all of Watt-Cast history.
Well, good luck to you, sir.
Thank you.
Okay.
Good comment.
Speaking of Ainals, good luck to you, pal.
Okay, we're still waiting for our first call from the keys, okay?
I mean, I don't know why you even go through this, you know?
Because they're not going to call.
They're not going to call.
They're not listening.
No.
They're not going to call.
They don't want anything to do with us or anybody else north of Monroe County.
I don't think they're up yet.
I'll tell you the truth.
I don't think so.
Okay, you can call us collect now.
We're not going to trace the number.
We're not going to get all antsy 655 WIOD or 278WID.
There's almost never anybody on those lines anyway.
No.
I don't see anything happening to them.
Oh, wait a minute.
The vocal line's flashing now.
Crank.
I'm crank.
I'm curious about one thing.
When we do screenless, which I think we're going to do tomorrow.
We need to have a break in the action.
Great.
When we do screenless, I don't think I can punch these up.
I think I got to punch him down here first and then punch him up here.
If we do a screenless thing.
In other words, if they're ringing, I can't punch it up on here and capture it.
I can.
Really?
You believe that?
Can you really?
Well, we'll find out.
We're going to do screenless tomorrow.
So you can take a nice rest.
Okay.
It'll be great.
You and Roger can have a little siesta.
You'll notice the energy levels different on the whole.
Oh, yeah.
Different energy.
When we do screenless, then we see some action.
Oh, yeah.
Okay, this is all like a windowed.
Yeah.
Okay, let's go to Miramar.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yeah.
Hi.
How are you today?
Okay.
How are you today?
Hey, I'm fantastic.
Good.
I've been listening to you for a long time.
This is the first time I've ever talked to you.
I'm trying to convert my wife from FM2AM.
And I centered a public the other night to get some butcher beer and she couldn't find it.
Yeah.
So if you could maybe play that commercial and call her a douchebag, I think we do.
Okay.
Well, listen, have a nice day, pal.
You want me to play it?
Call her a douchebag.
Stand on my head.
And eat four grubbiness while playing Havana Gila on my, what was the guy?
Zomphir on the pan flute?
Do you have a problem with that?
Anything else, pal?
Now we can do for you.
We have an open line indeed, 751 WIOD and one in Broward, believe it or not, at 524 WIOD.
This is a very strange day.
Yeah.
Very strange.
It's 1133 and we want to invite you if you haven't decided what you're going to do for lunch yet.
Head over to the char hut right in your neighborhood.
Great idea.
There are six char hut locations in San Flores, soon going to be seven.
There are four Lauderdale Sunrise, Tamarack, Davey, Hollywood, Miami, and coming in December in Margate.
Wow.
Uh-huh.
Boy.
And, uh, boy, if you want a great hamburger, cheeseburger, that fantastic Italian sausage, chicken breast, the best onion rings in town, you'll find that in lots more.
At char hut, another created their own money that you can spend in their restaurants.
For hats, t-shirts, Sony FM Walkman radios from overseas electronics, and BMX bikes and skateboards from international bicycle shop.
High tech kitchen radios from Alderman Markdown on Federal Highway in Fort Lauderdale, the home of surprise shopping and more.
So you get over to char hut today for a fantastic lunch or dinner or late night snack.
You can tell a mucle neal sent you by to char hut.
Good morning.
I'm April 1.
Discovery 1.
I mean, it's been nothing for back until now.
I'm about 30 seconds, man. What does this one say?
You're really cute.
I have about 10 seconds.
Oh, I know.
There's a number of rumors in the inn, you enders. That's all they are.
Thank you for your call.
Hours seem like minutes with Steve King.
Week after noon's a two on News Talk Radio 610, W-I-O-D.
And of course today, minutes will seem like hour is when Steve hosts Dr. Roy Masters, Bob Kunst and A. Dean.
It's gonna be great to see her again.
What a trifecta that is.
Yeah, I wonder if A. Dean can stand in the doorway and hold that door open, man.
That's a pretty heavy door.
1253 at W-I-O-D. Here's a dock in Miami. Hello.
Larry?
Dock? Did I do something wrong?
He's not there.
Okay, let's go to Boka. Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you doing?
We're doing pretty good.
Great.
Hours, caller is stuck, but we're doing great.
Well, I hope that I don't suck, but you know, I'll leave that to you in the bird after I hang up.
Just remember, it's a free country, sir.
That's correct.
Saturday, I was down at the franchise show at the dinner key auditorium and I saw this little kid walking around carrying telephone books.
And I thought it was very strange for I saw that he was walking with Bob Mayor who was doing interviews.
Oh, my.
And it's true. You've said it for years.
Oh, my.
Oh, God.
Now, come on.
Was Mike Spindell really down there?
Oh, there's Johnny Colton.
I'm Mike Spindell with him, but I'm not positive.
I don't know what Mike Spindell looks like.
Johnny D.
Johnny Dolan just walked in the other room and I'm sure that that really means a lot to you, sir.
Oh, it does.
It used to be on the old East Asian.
That's right.
He's been on every state.
Every state I've ever worked for.
He's even on the police station.
Right.
Police squad.
Yeah.
Well, Johnny D, you know, it's nice that you're there, but please stay off the air.
Yeah.
We're going to get Johnny a job at a big station and ex-on.
That pump your own, right?
There you go.
Yeah.
Let's not get into that.
Okay.
I tell you, this call is pretty good.
I mean, you're actually alive and with an IQ of over one.
But I was a bird didn't like me last week.
What did you do?
I bet you did something.
No, I just said that I have a lot more things to say, but I'll let it go for another phone call.
And when I hung up, you said that was a good decision.
Oh, that was what it meant.
I didn't like you.
Well, you know, let's get you real sensitive now, sir.
You're all too sensitive.
See, this is part of the sickness.
First, you become sensitive.
Then you become chronic.
And then you get hung up on is what happens after that.
Oh.
Try to control yourself.
Just once a week, that's all I call.
Okay.
Well, like most people in our audience once a week.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm trying for more, but my wife, you know.
Yeah, I know.
Like once a month.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, listen, you've been great.
Let's not spoil it.
Have a great day.
We'll talk to you next week.
Okay.
Good luck to you.
Bye-bye.
Thank you so much.
Port Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yeah.
How you doing?
We're doing it.
All right.
I want to tell you something.
You know, when I used to crawl over to the other station on the FM, and I get the, what is
the name, Captain and Taneel over there?
Captain and Shlameel, yeah.
Yeah.
And you would be saying that the, at one point that maybe there were no phone calls, and I would crawl in and the phone would be busy.
You know, I think he was doing a sabotage job on you over there.
Good.
Anything to do that?
No, who wouldn't do that?
He was just busy.
He was eating a lot and lying on the floor.
And he had a lot of other stuff going on.
He didn't, I don't think he liked it.
I kind of got the, let me say this to you.
When we did screenless and he didn't have to answer the phone, he was in heaven, man, because he didn't like in fact many times, he'd be in the studio with us and the phone would be ringing off the hook.
Yeah.
I think he was a captain, though, for sure.
And another thing, my grandfather wants to ask you a question.
Can you answer your question?
Yeah.
Your grandfather?
His grandfather.
The one Neil.
Yeah.
He's a Dean there.
A man's bike.
Okay, pal.
Good luck to you.
It's almost time for your metamusel break, okay?
All right, we have an open line in Broward moments ago, within the last to go, within the last half hour.
So at 524, WIOD, if you want, move quickly, get in, be online during the news.
It'll keep you out of trouble and it'll keep you on air for a long time.
Trust me.
Let's see, we just did that one.
Here's a Falcon fan on two.
Boy, you talk about desperate.
Hey, Neil, how's it going, man?
You are joking, aren't you, sir?
No, I'm a bravest fan, too.
Well, good luck to you.
Very consistent.
Hey, hey, love those bravest, man.
I got a...
Did you hear the rumor that Ted Turner is going to do the games in black and white this year?
I know.
I'm able to get a WIOD spy report for you now.
Okay.
Bird is really a secret Nazi agent.
Hey, hold on a second.
Someone's knocking on my back door.
Okay, good luck to you, pal.
Boy, I'm counting you.
You're right.
We got a lot of colors here today.
Offsetters?
Yeah.
They are, trust me.
Listen, if the broad is listening, I hate to use that term.
It's a demeaning term.
I mean it to me, because she was a lady when she called, but in my opinion, she's a broad
now, because she gave us a bum steer.
We just wasted an hour.
Yeah.
I mean, I'm not saying that we wouldn't have to sit here anyway, but with that thing off,
it's a lot less draining.
And there was nobody on Santa Barbara that was even remotely interesting, other than maybe
the guy that you thought, the woman that you thought was a guy or something like a guy
of a...
...and a dress.
Or whatever.
But there was nobody worth looking at on this show.
That's it.
What is she talking about?
Maybe she's talking about Pam Saw's being Gordon Stevens.
Lady, I mean, your taste is in your earlobe, okay?
Or maybe in some other part of your anatomy, but certainly not in your mouth.
Terrible.
Nobody on there, I would...
We got a pizza parlor on one.
Hello.
Is this Neil Rogers?
Yes, sir.
This is Luigi's pizza, but I know it's pizza parlor in the North Miami area.
Yeah, Luigi.
How would we bring you some food?
We just came up with a new type of pizza.
What is it?
You got arsenic?
No, no arsenic in it yet, unless it enhances the flavor.
Okay.
It's a New York deli pizza.
It's a combination of corn beef, pastrami, sour, crap, mustard, wrapped in a pizza show.
Good.
Boy, it sounds great.
Like to bring you some up.
Okay, Ron.
You open about a couple of weeks.
Yeah.
Well, good luck to you.
All right, how do we get some up to you?
Well, probably bring him here would be the best way and we'll have our...
Any time?
Anytime you want.
Okay, we're on the...
We'll drop some off tomorrow morning.
Okay.
We're in the county square shopping center.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
And good luck to you, sir.
Thank you.
Okay, and thanks for the plug.
Little serious, there.
Well, he was serious.
You can get himself a good plug.
And like I said, you're going to be eating all the food that comes in from now and the WIOD staff.
I'm up for it.
Maybe even some of the animals from GTR might participate.
Mm-hmm, I'm ready.
I can help.
I can help you with any more.
I'm on my diet as of today.
Okay.
I'm not going to bend or yield if you pardon that expression for anybody regardless of anything.
Okay.
I'll cover a lot of great sponsors out there and a lot of great food people and that's wonderful.
But they're going to have to wait until I'm flim and trim.
What are you trying to say?
They've got a long wait.
Is that what you're saying?
Okay, anyway, we're going to check things out.
We're going to see if we had to write channel and the right soap during the news break.
And then we'll come back for our number three at about 1207.
And I think in the next hour because noon is a very heavy news intensive hour, we might bring out your mama.
All right, I'm ready.
I'm ready.
Extra word from the bird during the noon hour.
I'm ready.
And stick around, don't forget Steve with that incredible limperist and show coming up at Tuesday's afternoon.
WIOD, Miami, Fort Lauderdale.
Neil Rogers continues after another news update on news talk radio 610 WIOD.
Penn Diamond.
Dale, hello.
Hey, Neil, what's up, man?
Not much.
I need to do me a favor, man.
I'm writing this paper.
Yeah, man.
Dad at dad at school and I need some comments from a couple guys in the radio industry about date County radio.
You guys want to throw that out?
Well, what do you mean, date County radio?
What does that mean?
Well, I'm doing a thing on date County and the median date County and how it sucks.
Yeah, it does.
The newspapers and the television station.
No, sir.
Not the newspapers.
The newspaper singular.
Newspaper.
There is only one paper, at least another, what, five weeks, six weeks.
Yeah, well, the news have been gone in January, but that's correct.
But I was wondering if you guys can, you know, just throw out a comment.
You know, I can quote you in this thing that I got someone from the radio.
No.
How come in about one?
There's something about what it's like working in date County radio.
It's like trying to wake the dead.
Trying to wake the dead.
You like that comment?
That's pretty good.
Hey, get the book.
It's like trying to do a radio show in a funeral parlor.
All right.
In a cemetery.
That's a good comment.
That's a good comment.
Bird, you got a comment.
Two sources, better than one.
About date County radio?
Yeah.
Sure, man.
The programmers in this city seem to be asleep.
Brain dead.
Brain dead.
They only seem to, they don't do anything fresh or original.
They only seem to copy.
Right.
That's why they taped my show so they can take bits out of it and probably going to steal them.
Yeah, I'm going up to Geneva back up to a Hobart College, man.
Wait.
Hey, I know that well, yeah.
Everyone to the Oaks?
No.
The bar up there, man?
No.
Now, that's a little place.
Okay, all right.
And you have a good time.
Take your, okay, take your jammies.
I mean, raw guns.
142 at WIOD.
I wonder how Al Bires isn't joining the show today.
But I heard that through the rape lab.
Isn't that incredible?
Talk about juvenile, man.
Just sit there and tape the show all four hours day after day.
Again, it's just a rumor.
It's just a rumor.
That's what that's all we hear through the rape find.
It's just a rumor.
I hate to say it, but there's some, they need some other technical opinion.
They need to get a life is what they need in poor.
If they work a little more on that transmitter, it's better than it used to be.
But it's still kind of like, one more.
That's why they only got those old people listening, man.
They're too old to reach over and turn the dial.
They're listening under crystal sets.
But it'll all be a mood point when they change it.
That other rumor that was going around for a while there by like changing the host and doing automated talk and stuff.
Again, it's just a rumor.
I don't know anything about it.
No.
I just heard a nasty rumor that they were going to go like almost automated on AM,
which they're close to that now anyway, especially with that Debbie Yellowson.
Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Yo.
Glenn and Tania, the schlamiel.
Yeah, the schlamiel.
All right, listen.
I have one thing to say.
First of all, the all.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You say you got one thing to say.
One thing.
And then you said, first of all, you know,
see, I have a feeling you got more than one thing to say.
Well, it'll be, it's for you.
It's a bad call, but because it's good.
Okay.
All right.
First of all, I like to say to all those Sunday pipe smoking drivers and all bitty's that niche that net.
All right.
Now wait a minute.
Is this called around five?
Is that where we are?
Nick said you're boring, sir.
Well, such as life.
Well, he thinks so far.
I like it.
So far, he said, going to give you a chance, but so far he thinks you're terminal and that he's going into a coma.
Okay.
No.
By the way, before you go on, can we say we have an official announcement here at WIOD.
We have just decided for future reference because they do tend to be very sensitive over there at the WS News.
We are going to change their call letters officially to match their demographics.
So no longer be WNWS.
It'll be WOLD.
Harry Chapin would be proud of that.
And the man, you can't get any older than that.
I'll tell you that.
Old radio.
That should be another comment for the guy who was writing the paper.
Yeah.
You know, date County radio in one word.
Old.
Yeah.
Go ahead, sir.
No.
WOLD.
I think you're going to bring the record in Mark.
I've got to add a meal on a tape and having the money that's paid for the tape going to come.
That's great.
Well, that is a good idea.
Didn't we do that once upon a time when we made a set of it?
No, we did that.
When we were still sending the cassettes out, that was different.
In the last phase of it.
And we said, like for 10 bucks or more donation, you can send you a cassette.
Yeah, we had thought of it.
But the problem is we're not really big on cassettes yet.
Give us a chance.
Okay.
We got a whole bunch of new stuff here that we could put on a great cassette.
Can you imagine?
No, no.
I understand that.
No.
That'd be great.
But I mean,
I like to say it's to all those brain-designers who are doing it.
That would do it.
Do not think you are a humanitarian.
Right.
He would love to do that.
I would love to do it.
Yeah, we'd rate a lot of good.
Oh, by the way, I'm just glad you mentioned that.
I mailed all the checks on Friday.
We had almost $1300.
Wow.
For Camilla's house, we got some more that came in today.
So, um,
We're going to $200 check coming from me because no matter what the people say about you and how they treat you,
you're doing a great job.
And the people in the community appreciate it and my appreciate it.
Thank you.
Your suggestion is valid, sir.
And we will consider it.
Thanks a lot.
Okay.
Okay.
See, he may have been boring, but at least he was valid.
His heart was in the right place.
145 at WIOD and we'll go to West Palm next on 8th.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Neil, how are you today?
I'm doing okay.
Listen, I'm a first time caller.
And I just wanted to welcome you back to the AMI used to listen to you when you were over on,
uh, brand X, whatever they were.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, just, uh, happy that you're on AM because you seem so stifled over there.
No, we didn't know.
We didn't seem stifled.
We were stifled.
Well, they, they cut out all the great stuff that made you wonderful.
That is correct.
Like the show.
Speaking of, uh, copying people as you were before, being stuck in this West Palm market,
I'm forced to deal with a man named Lee Fowler.
Who?
Speaking of it, louder, sir.
Yes, please.
Lee Fowler.
And Neil Pell.
Speaking of copying.
I have Lee's resume here right in front of me and, boy, the picture is incredible.
It's right.
Does everything you do?
I mean, he goes, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
Well, I'm not sure he does everything I do, sir, but I'm, you know, he might tell us.
Well, he's on the other side of the...
Someone in the building who's in a position to know, uh, we'll check it out.
Don't be too sure of anything at this point.
Uh-huh.
Boy, I'm telling you, Steve is full of it today.
He looks like he swallowed four canaries.
He want to think about Stephen Lee, man.
They got this gossip line going.
It is the greatest thing.
I mean, stories that haven't even been invented about broadcasters who haven't been born yet.
They got them.
It's great.
And, uh, bird to you?
Yes, sir.
I'd like to welcome you back to the AM also.
And, uh, I always thought that, uh, you were a great, uh, added feature to Neil's show.
Well, I appreciate it, sir.
And...
What do you think that kind of like in past tense?
Well, no.
I spoke to the bird once while you were on vacation a few years back.
Yeah, there are a lot of people to do that.
I see it.
Well, I'm away, yeah.
Well, you wouldn't...
You hung up on me once before, because I was so terminally discused.
Yeah, when you're still a little borderline terminal, but you're a good guy.
Well, that doesn't help my, uh, my radio any.
But, uh, it doesn't help your show.
Yes, little listen.
Thanks to your show, you keep me sane, and, uh, everybody will be picking you up again.
Okay.
Oh, okay.
You can buy mystery picker.
Thanks a lot.
Okay, and I hope you and Lee have a great life together.
One 48 at WIOD will go to Miami.
Hello.
Neil, how you doing?
Great.
Neil, I took your advice.
Yes.
I went to the melting pot.
And?
Neil, I got news.
The appetizer, the cheese.
Yup.
It's incredible.
It's the best.
Yes.
The white chocolate fondue for dessert.
Yes.
With the bass.
Yes.
Neil, the end.
The middle part of the dinner.
Neil, it was great.
It was gross.
This guy called me before one time.
I have never called you before.
I have never called you before.
Because you don't, you don't understand how to use the peanut oil.
What do you do?
Take a bath in it?
No, I just, I, they're with the greatest colors, do I?
Let me tell you something.
I want to tell you something.
Okay.
Melting pot has been with me for, I don't know, what, two, three years now?
Yes.
And I don't, I think you're, no, second one.
The first complaint was by some guy who was too lazy.
He didn't want to cook his own dinner.
Okay.
So the food was great.
He just didn't want to cook his own dinner.
He wanted somebody else to do it for him, which shows where he's coming from.
Yours is the only complaint I've ever had about the food.
I was just, I mean, the food, the appetizer was amazing.
Well, let me make a suggestion to you.
You don't have to have the entree when you go in there.
I mean, if you're just not disposed to the peanut oil or whatever, go in there and have the cheese there.
Have the, the cheese and they'll give you extra bread and vegetables and fill yourself up on that.
And then have the white chocolate dessert.
Oh, a hundred of his meal.
I am definitely in the bath.
I'm definitely going to do that.
That part of the dinner was tremendous.
It was great.
Great.
It's a little part of it.
Well, don't eat the middle part.
Never again.
Okay.
No, I have a suggestion.
Oh, yes.
How about the kind of song again?
They got that next door.
I don't know if we got time to go grab that.
So to speak.
Come on, Neil.
All right.
We'll see if Nick can get it for us.
Thanks for that.
Okay.
Boy, after he rips the, well, he didn't really rip it.
He said everything was great except that one part of the meal that he didn't like.
Well, listen, don't get that part again.
Do you think we can get that card?
You don't know.
Well, if they're in the right mood, they'll give it to us.
If not, we don't really give it to him anyway because the guy was kind of surly to begin with.
It's 150, 10-till-two at W-I-O-D.
W-I-O-D.
No, what they are.
Okay.
Johnny Jolent came in and he gave us these little G-T-R things and he...
You know, I have no idea what you do with them.
But they're cute.
So don't be rude because he's going to go next door and bring us the kind of song.
Do you put these on your refrigerator?
I haven't got any idea.
Okay.
I can tell you where to put them.
153 at W-I-O-D.
It's kind of like this pregnant pause because we're waiting to see his body flash in front of the window again if he's going to bring that in.
That's Johnny D.
I'll tell you.
How long is that about a minute and a half?
Well, listen, we'll start another call and then if he brings it back in, we'll hang up on the caller.
Boka, hello.
Yeah, douchebag, you'll...
Yeah, I know it.
I knew that Boka, man.
You'll know that.
Seriously, Boka today has been like the douchebag line, hasn't it?
Yeah, but at least I admitted foul, okay?
Excuse me.
Pemberpine, hello.
Thank you, Neil.
Thank you.
Great.
Boy, we got him here.
I'm glad we decided to take one more call.
Wow.
Moral Geibels, hello.
Yes, Neil.
How are you?
Okay.
I want the douchebag, I found it.
Okay.
Okay, I'm another convert from W-Douchebag FM in the morning.
And I was wondering if you had gotten a fire report on the Morton Downey Show the other night.
Yes, we did.
Way back in the beginning of the show today, we did.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was in cry.
The Morton Downey took Steve and I, he took our names in vain and we're going to rip him a new butt, okay?
All right.
After he writes us out a check for 10 percent of his 22 million, we're going to rip him a new butt, worse than all.
He deserves it.
Listen, I just want to say one thing.
I do go to the University of Miami, which I know is one of your favorite schools in the whole world.
Yeah.
But we're not all this bad here.
I just want you to know...
No, no, no, no.
No, I'm not going to play, you're making Bob Sledge.
You're not going to get that out of here, way.
No, no.
Yeah, I don't believe you brought that over here.
You're not going to get that out of here.
Get out of here.
Here, this isn't GTR.
We're not playing.
But slime ball listeners out there like they do.
We don't feel.
Thanks a lot, but it's time to say audio's to you.
Thank you, Neil.
Thanks for the card, but don't over it.
Just bring what we ask.
Okay, don't throw that in Belishin', okay?
This Johnny is so emotion, you know?
Bad.
Come on.
Work too long in that building.
It rubs off on you.
You want to roll the squirrel.
Okay, it's 155 at WIOD.
We want to thank our dear friends next door at Slime Ball WGPR for releasing this again.
Your love like really sweeter.
If you are your Peter, keep a ring with your woman every day.
If you don't think you love her, you better use her lover.
Because that's not the way we say it.
If you drink this, won't you?
Cover your wife.
Before you attack her, wrap your wife.
Cover your stuff.
Before you hide, don't be silly.
Protect your women.
Don't be a lover.
Cover your burden if you go with the heat.
That is your means.
When it's down, stride your spouse.
Even in this area, just rather than your love,
we'll be sweeter.
If you wrap your dear, keep a ring with your woman every day.
If you don't think you love her, you better use her lover.
Because they cannot give you one to play.
Because they cannot give you one to play.
A public service message of the Rock and Roll animals at 97GTR.
Thank you so much, Scott Chapin.
We have his brother Harry going to be on a show tomorrow.
This thing, the new LLT.
I do mean old man.
Look at those demos, baby.
I hope you enjoyed the show today.
Can you imagine having a tape show every day for four?
At least he gets the tape in entertaining show.
Can you imagine if he had a tape Debbie Ellis or something?
Or Alan Burke.
Who is a friend of WIOD?
Don't forget it.
Don't start knocking the dean.
He is still a friend.
Or how about the Orny Sochens show?
We never really got a definitive report on Ernie there.
We had two conflicting calls.
One of whom said that Ernie said that I got fired everywhere that I worked, which is untrue.
And the other caller who said that Ernie said wonderful things about us.
That's right.
I have a feeling the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Like he ripped us for half of the show.
And the other show defended us rigorously.
Yeah.
Okay, should we take one more?
We got time here.
We could take this call from Hollywood.
What do you think?
Well, Lee Fowler would say, what do you think?
Ha!
What do you think?
Okay.
Okay, hollywood.
Well, yeah, that was the right decision.
I'm glad that that one.
Not Miami Beach, hello.
How are you today?
Okay.
Neil, have you ever heard of a tune called CIA-Colopso by Alan Ginsburg?
No.
If you had your choice between that or the firing squad, which would you take?
Choice between what?
Hearing Alan Ginsburg, not wearing the firing squad.
No, I'm rather here, Ernie Ginsburg, okay?
What is he talking about?
Have you though I had any idea?
No.
That was beyond me.
We don't have bye bye Ginsburg, do we?
Yeah.
Yeah, we have that.
Did I bring that?
I think so.
No.
No, bye bye Bundy.
Yeah, what's the hotel?
