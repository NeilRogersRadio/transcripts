Okay kids, Uncle Nils is W-I-O-D now. So we're gonna do this one again. Are you ready, kids? Joey?
Sandy? Sandy?
Mama Fergill.
And Alice. Alice? Where is he, man? Is he in the closet again?
Honduras, man. Honduras.
Say Alice.
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Alice, you didn't do your pump up up.
I'll first write to you.
But you have to. It's part of the song.
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.
There's Mama.
Now, listen. I want a concerted effort to bop up up up in this song,
where I won't give you those pictures you asked for last week.
All right, from the top.
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
Oh, so...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Getting ponderous, all right.
10-07 at W-I-O-D.
It's a Wednesday morning.
That's Casey.
I know. He's something all the way.
Now, that's the four listeners.
I want to thank them.
I also want to thank some other people.
I don't even have the names, because I didn't have time last night to write down
the names of all the people who sent some of the stuff in.
But we actually have some new things.
I know.
And there's nothing like trying new things, right?
Anyway, did you see the barbaric behavior of the people in sunrise last night?
You know, this commissioner Steve did a whole show yesterday.
Who got caught with his...
What ever route.
And I don't want to go into a whole thing about that.
There was Steve had one listener yesterday, and then I turned it off,
because I got so apoplectic, you know, who said...
Steve said he thought prostitution ought to be legal, which I agree with, of course.
And the guy said, well, why is that?
You know, in Europe prostitution been legal for a very, very long time.
It almost all the Western Europe, and they bring it inside.
They give these people off the streets, and they clean it up,
and they protect the health of the public.
But anyway, I don't want to get into that part of it.
But, you know, the commissioner resigned.
And if you could have seen the behavior of these barbarians in sunrise last night,
I met animals.
It was living proof of what I talk about on the show every day.
They are the most... I'm not saying everybody.
Only maybe about 80 percent of the people in sunrise are barbaric,
and they're animals, and they're disgusting, and they have no compassion,
no nothing, man. They're just out for blood.
And they get what they deserve.
They've had nothing but corruption and the grotesque stuff and government up there
for as long as I've been down here.
And they deserve it, because there are a bunch of subhuman douchebags in sunrise.
They make me sick.
All you've got to do is cross sunrise boulevard,
and then when you're leaving plantation,
and you're crossing into sunrise, it's like you're going into a different world.
And all of a sudden, the traffic slows down about 10 miles an hour,
and there's this humongous traffic jam as you get toward Oakland, man.
You think the world is coming to an end.
A bunch of barbaric douchebags, I'll say it again in sunrise.
Anyway, I hope you have a good time doing the show today.
I have to leave. I've got to be a culler today. I've got a hot tip.
Shall we think? It's dead.
Well, I don't really care. I'll just take them anyway,
but we're going to do a break at 20.20.
Okay. Okay.
Just so we know, I mean, I just like to have a ballpark.
And remind me, starting next week,
I'm going to start making my own copies of the log.
I know that there's going to get some people upset,
but I like to have, you know, it's like when you head out on the highway
and you have no idea where you're going,
it's sometimes a good idea to have a road man.
You know, I mean, once in a while, you just play pot luck.
And you figure, well, wherever I wind up,
it's got to be better than where I came from, you know?
But I like to have a little road map, so I know what's going on.
Well, I like those copies because you can write things on them
like you can't do on the real log.
So anyway, the bottom line is that, you know,
the tapes are going to start going out in the next couple of days,
assuming Fat Rich shows up today because we've got boxes and boxes and stuff.
It's a good thing he drives a big car.
He drives that gigantic battleship.
Yes, he does.
I bet he wants to part of time lived in sunrise.
Because in order to live in sunrise, you have to drive a battleship.
Anyway, let's give those numbers out.
We're going to get, we got a lot of new stuff to play here too, today.
That is right.
A lot.
Like that one that we just played.
Which was cute.
It was cute.
I liked it.
It's Casey.
I want to think Spencer for Christmas present.
Oh, yeah, Spencer is here, by the way, for anybody in a building
who might be listening.
Spencer is out there washing frantically,
and for ten bucks, he will do a job in your car and make it look brand new.
Yes.
So please, and we found Spencer brought me some fantastic cigars
and gave me a little present.
I think they're these Cuban cigars.
Are they?
That'll get some of the anti-bilingual crazy of these are Cuban cigars.
You like them.
You said you like them.
Well, these are Jamaican cigars.
But anyway, they're really good.
They're mild and they're legit.
They're not Dutch masters, you know, but white al.
But they're pretty good.
Anyway, 751 WIOD and Dade, 524 WIOD and Broward.
And of course, those Palm Beach lines.
Look at that.
The Align 8 is ringing already.
That's gotta be known.
What's probably a crank?
278 WIOD and Boca and 655, 9463 in Palm Beach.
These screens are all screwed up.
Really?
Which I have no idea how this happens.
You know how I've always said that before,
when you leave on a given day.
Yeah.
And then you come back the next day,
and you wonder just exactly what it is that happened between the time you left
and the time you came back.
It's like people are playing radio in here at night or something.
Well, they are.
Are they?
Well, I don't know if they play radio, but they're,
because I was, at first time I was ever in here at night last night.
And yeah, there's some interesting people in here.
At that?
And they come in and they watch the TV and they probably go through the rack
and do a few little things and, you know.
And Tim, of course, is having a nervous breakdown.
An engineer is here now.
You know, I don't blame him.
This is a very serious problem.
No, can't.
In fact, we just may leave if we don't get it straight down in the next 30 seconds.
But, oh, listen to that.
I like those sound effects.
Hey, listen, I might wake some of these bastards up, okay?
Anyway, Tim is crawling under the table now, ladies and gentlemen.
Probably find some extra poster from yesterday from Forrests in there.
This is great.
That's what happened.
Something come unglued?
Just me.
Oh.
Anyway, while we're letting you in a little on the inside,
most of the shows don't do this.
Most people would just hear him pretend that nothing was going on,
but we'd like to let everybody know that we were a little consternation
because misery loves company.
Isn't that the Florida slogan?
Okay, should we take a call here?
Roger says, do whatever the hell you want.
Just leave me alone.
Okay, I'm going to get out of here in a few minutes,
and I don't want to be hurt by all these technical screw-ups, okay?
Dade County, hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I'm believable.
I'm the first call.
Yes, you are.
Only by the only reason you're the first call is because the screens aren't working, so...
So, they'll let it go to your head.
I'm just doing it the real simple way, you know?
Like, one, two, three, stuff like that.
Well, this is a voice from the past.
Really?
This is Adam, the former intern at IMZ.
I'll be damned.
How are you?
I spoke to Glenn a few weeks ago when he did the show by himself.
I remember.
Yeah, I told him...
I told you I was going to Israel.
I still am, and I'd like Neil's permission to call a collect from Israel.
This is long as you don't put fruitcake on a line.
Okay, yeah.
Someone mentioned that he was out there.
He's there, yeah.
Well, I don't think I'll be bumping into him.
You never know.
That's great.
Yeah.
That would be true.
So what's going on?
What's going on?
You got your own show again on AM.
That's great.
What do you mean I got my own show on AM?
I don't understand.
What does that mean?
Have I ever been doing somebody else's show?
I'm in on the AM.
Oh, okay.
But it's just interestingly praising of that.
Yeah, but I got my own show.
Well, I didn't want to let it out, but I'm going to be Greg's new sidekick.
I didn't want to...
Yeah, because noodles is evidently going to disappear as early.
Yeah, that's the word.
Wow.
But now that you kind of let the cat out of the bag or out of the closet or something.
So anyway, Adam.
Any corporate secrets there?
No.
I stumbled on some information that...
I don't know if it's information, but it's fairly...
I thought it was quite interesting.
I was viewing Cocoon 2.
You know, the movie with all the geriatric things.
Yeah.
I don't knock Donna Michi.
I like Donna Michi.
Donna Michi was the best part, but there's a scene with Jack Gilford and some older actress.
I don't remember her name.
And St. Petersburg nightclub.
Oh, yeah.
Mary Pickford, huh?
Yeah.
And there's a band playing.
And I swear to God, they're playing an instrumental version of rats in my room.
Really?
So I think we know where Joey is.
Okay.
Well, yeah, he's old enough to qualify for that movie.
There's no question about it.
I think...
In fact, I think he's the guy that they pulled out of the Cocoon, isn't he?
Mm-hmm.
Whatever you say, Adam.
Well, listen, this has been sidelating to say the least.
I can't help but talk about movies.
I remember what happened the last time we spoke.
What was that?
I tried to do my Oscar predictions on the air.
Oh, yeah.
But that was...
That was too contrived, yeah.
Very contrived.
But I'm learning.
Oh, I know who this is now.
I was thinking you were somebody else.
Yeah.
No, no.
This was the two in.
Oh, I know who this is.
No, I thought this is different.
We had another Adam up there who was different.
Very famous crank collar as it turned out.
Oh, well.
And I kept thinking all along.
I haven't really been listening to a word you've been saying.
I was with Hostel all the way.
Now I realize who this is.
You're okay.
You're good at it.
It's not the same.
Oh, this is one of those two ugly guys that came in that day.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I remember that.
Very clear.
Well, actually, there was three.
You got some guy from FIU to come on, too.
Oh, yeah, but that guy was on for about two seconds.
Remember that?
Wasn't that that little kid?
Long.
Yeah.
Yeah, that was a little kid who was going to do the show.
Remember, and he sat down and I said, okay.
He was about 21.
He was little.
That all depends on what you're talking about, Adam.
Well, listen, have a wonderful day.
It's good hearing from you.
And I'm sorry that I thought you were a crank.
Well, uh, well, for all we know, you might be.
Okay, have a great life.
Thanks a lot, Dave.
Okay, bye.
Bye-bye.
Boy, he's a good guy, but he is so terminal, man.
You know, he is so boring, ponderous, but a good guy, really, isn't?
Ugly.
It's a 19-packed IOD.
Get my regards to Neil Rogers, telling me that I've never heard of
smuddy or program in my life.
It's 1023 at WIOD.
We've got something that I want to play now, because that call from Adam got me kind of...
He's a good guy.
I don't want to get him defensive or feeling bad right before the holiday, but he is so boring.
Isn't he?
Oh, little.
Come on, be honest.
He's terminal.
Homotose.
A great guy.
Ugly.
But comatose.
Okay, now listen, I want you to...
You're going to just freak out when you hear this, and I should have saved the slip of paper, but I didn't.
It's somewhere at home, I guess, with the guys who did this, because this is...
You're going to just go nuts when you hear this.
Oh, right.
Dave.
That's right.
I'm going to get right.
Dave.
Dave.
Dave.
Dave.
That's right.
I'm going to get right.
Dave.
What's up, everybody?
FortuneCookie.
V banner white.
This is out of the new empire.
V banner white discovered that hell hath no fury, like a woman waiting to use the gun.
At the LA Sports Arena for an Anita Baker concert, Vanna beeline to the ladies room at
intermission and tried to sail by a line of about 15 gals anxiously hopping from one
foot to the other.
No way, Vanna yelled a lady at the front.
You've got to wait like everyone else.
They all started shouting stuff like, the end of the line is back here, Vanna, and wait
your turn like the rest of us.
Well, ignoring the women, Dana asked a security guard if there was a, get this, VIP
restroom.
Nope, is that the guard?
VIP?
Nope, said the guard.
So red face, Vanna had to slink to the back of the line while the other women stared
baggers.
That's out of the new inquire.
That's the December 27th issue.
There are a lot of publicers out there.
There are a lot of publicers out there.
So this has got it all, so it sure does.
Hate Mail for Robin Givens, Zavalanching at the head of the class said, actually had
a mind-boggling peak of 16,000 hate letters a week.
ABC is sweating bullets because many fans write it.
I don't get that many.
I know that they're writing that if Robin isn't fired, they will stop watching head of
the class.
You don't have to stay tuned for that.
The producer only moves so far.
It's been the trim, Robin's parts, severely.
You're going to have to stay tuned for that.
You don't have to stay tuned for that.
Okay, that's enough of that.
Is that incredible?
Beauty.
He got so inspired, he just grabbed the inquire and started reading immediately.
I was here.
I was here.
I want to thank these guys, whoever was that put that thing together.
Then there's even a longer one.
See, this one's not even really intended for a newsbed.
This is intended for a newsbed.
Oh, I know.
I know.
I know.
Just hear those screens and you just go nuts.
Okay, 1026 at WIOD, we have an open line in Broward, which is really peculiar.
524-9463.
We don't put up with that crap on the show, okay?
And also the book line is open.
Thank God, a 278 WIOD.
Did you see that Rebecca Paul is going to be here next week?
Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you that.
Hopefully she's going to bring us some of the lottery money.
I spread it around a little bit.
That's going to be incredible.
I hear she's going to look great.
Yeah, we're here to do.
She's been made over several times.
I can't wait.
We did Miami already.
You know, hello.
Wait, oh, hey, oh, hey.
Let's, like I said, that line for you to Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah.
The golf game on the tape for Camila Salad.
No, it sure is.
No, I would not do that to brother Paul.
Oh, no.
Well, would you play the golf game for me now?
No.
Okay, two open lines indeed.
751 WIOD.
We are absolutely taking no request today, okay?
Absolutely, positively be on the shadow of a doubt.
Not taking requests.
Now, did you get the screen working for that last call?
That was last two call.
Yeah, unfortunately.
Yeah, we're better off.
Although it would have turned out the same way anyway.
Yeah.
Okay, and at line eight in Palm Beach is open to.
So let's get the show on the road here, okay?
And let's get a lot of women here on the phone today.
I'm getting sick and tired.
It's getting really ponderous of begging for women callers.
There's a strange thing on this station, man.
You don't think it's too much sports, do you?
I think I know I'm asking the wrong person to be a factor.
Yeah, but just a little bit too much.
What do you want, Roger?
It works.
It works great.
Everything is fine.
Well, they didn't bother to tell you.
That's a little detail, you know?
You don't expect them to tell you, do you?
No, it's working.
It's working just fine.
This one over here is dead, I think.
I think we are going to say shivvy for the other one
in a little while, the screen.
Yeah, there's some interesting stuff that goes on here
at night, I think, really.
I bet.
Maybe I have a feeling.
Whole other world that is great.
I don't know about it.
Yeah, and you know, this TV gets a lot of use
and they've got games going on all the different screens.
They're having a lot of fun in here at night, which is nice.
Let's see.
Now see, he took everything off the board.
I don't understand why he did that.
What happened?
Now this is exciting.
I like this.
This is getting ponderous.
You know what, I didn't expect when I came in this morning
quite so much excitement, so close to the holidays.
And then we got sales people running in and out of here
like chickens and heat.
You know, just to go nuts and to go here and do this.
And just everybody relax, OK?
Now see all these other people, they get all these long,
long holidays and all this extra time off.
We're going to be here on Monday.
We're going to be the following Monday
the day after New Year.
So we don't get any of that stuff off.
So why don't they just at least take a chill, you know?
Just relax a little bit.
And then after New Year's, then we can all go back to work.
But in the meantime, let us just fake our way through
and cut out the crap.
Now why it's us here that traffic patrols
going to be working Monday also.
They're going to be doing traffic on Monday.
I can't go.
And by the way, pizza loft is going to be open
New Year's Eve and Christmas Day and New Year's Day.
They're open all the holidays.
Tom Denenberg, I shouldn't mention his name.
Wanted me to be sure to mention that.
And I'm sure they have a spot coming up later.
But I'll just mention that now in passing.
So that Tom Denenberg doesn't get the little,
well, you know Tom gets a little hyper.
He's a great guy, but just a little bit hyper, you know what I'm saying?
He gets a little excited.
If he just would calm down a little,
take a couple of doggy downers.
Everything's going to be just fine.
You know what I'm saying?
Well, salespeople take this so seriously.
Like it's life or death.
Now who are we talking about?
Oh, it's Tom Denenberg.
Don't mention my name on the ear.
Don't talk about me any.
I'm not.
Yeah, it gets hysterical.
We're trying to build a fan club for Tom.
We want to build a gigantic following out there
because he's a great guy and a tremendous salesperson.
But he's a little over involved.
You know what I mean?
Over involved.
North Miami Beach.
Hello.
Yes, I'd like to say hello Neil.
And I appreciate your show so much.
And I have been wanting for a long time to meet your mother
and to have a lunching or a dinner
which I would suit you, but I haven't been able.
I've been sick for a long time.
Yeah, that's obvious.
What this call is about?
Yeah, what is this call about?
It's about Glenn.
I love it.
Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hey, how you doing?
OK.
Now see, she may have been going to say,
I think she was going to take a shot.
Hey.
Tell the likeness.
She was going to say, I love Glenn, but I love the other one
of the tool.
I don't want to talk to those old people, Roger.
Oh, yes.
So, but.
Hello.
Yeah.
What's this with the Miami Herald?
What about it?
They got a thing in there about Sonny Fox making a song.
And isn't he not even with him no more?
Do you see that?
Where is it?
Well, we're looking for the Herald.
We have every other paper except the Herald.
It's a feature section.
Oh, there's the Herald.
OK.
And the living today?
Yeah.
Down here, it says they made a song.
It sounds like he's still with him.
And everybody's.
No, he's not still with him.
I talked to Sonny yesterday.
And he is not still with him.
OK, trust me.
So did I get it?
Where is this?
It's in a left hand.
It's in the right hand column, but on the left side there.
Down underneath GTR thing.
Underneath GTR thing?
How about a page number?
Page.
Might help.
Three E.
Three E.
Oh, well, I'm in a wrong section.
I guess that would help.
Three E.
Oh, E is that one that the radio page is always on.
They have the car ads and stuff like that.
It's Wednesday.
Oh, there's Alan Burke.
The Dean.
What's he doing?
All right.
Dean.
They're really on top of things at the Herald.
That's only about two weeks old, that story.
Yeah.
Why 100 Morning Personality?
Sonny Fox and athletes put a recorded
a Christmas song that's supposed to be
Broward Sheriff, Nick N'Vero singing a message to criminals
to the tune of Winter Wonderland.
Sonny's not even there anymore.
Thank you.
OK.
That's what I mean.
Yeah.
Well, Lorde is Acevado.
I'm sure she's a lovely lady.
And I've spoken to her a couple of times.
But she is so far behind the time that it's incredible.
That's the point I'm trying to bring.
And here's this little kid up here,
Johnny Miller, who looks like Jeremy Miller,
looks like Sean Cassidy on a bad day.
Yeah, I was in Wonderland, if you saw that.
Who the hell is that kid?
Listen, did you guys know that the Colonel does spots
on W.O.D. during the dolphin game?
Well, yeah, I'm sure he does agency spots.
Oh, I see.
What you always got to do some spots somewhere, you know?
You don't have many over on that show.
That's true.
OK, well, just want to bring that to your tent.
Thanks for the tip off.
Anytime the Harold screws up, man, we
want to be the first to know about it.
Yeah, exactly.
Have a good one.
So long, guys.
OK, well, there was a guy who at least made a little bit
of sense, not a whole lot, but a little bit, right?
Boy, what a good one.
Lorde is Acevado, man.
The Harold is so far behind.
Isn't it going to be great when Jika starts with the sunset?
Isn't it?
Yeah.
Next week, I think, or the week after he starts.
In fact, he's going to be on the show,
who I get to spread out January 4th Wednesday the 4th time.
That was going to be our first guest,
Dylan W.I.O.D. and then the following week,
the rumor has it that Bill Cosford, just a rumor.
Yeah, as of the moment, it's still a rumor.
Don't go to the bank.
But go see Rainman, whatever you do, it's fantastic.
You think some of the women who saw Rainman
will call into the end share their?
You saw yesterday, and was I right?
Great movie.
Even Roger, like in Roger's very demanding.
Well, I do my about our friend.
The last movie that he liked was Gone With The Wind.
J. Michaels and John McLaughlin have worked almost a year
on a Christmas special, which is going to air Christmas
even throughout Christmas day.
On what?
On I and Z.
Oh, on the radio.
They were a year on the radio special.
On the special.
Oh, I love that thing, man.
I'm telling you.
And the next time I played, you've got to just restrain yourself.
I have to listen to all the nuances there in the background.
Even Casey is in there a little bit.
Great.
I understand.
Saying some wild things like thunderous.
OK, it's 1034.
Gail Bright has another W.I.O.D. news update.
We're going to come right back and get to these exciting calls
after this.
This is covered on the radio page.
It has a more accurate story that's sunny is not on the air at all.
As opposed to the hero, which is still a year and a half behind.
What do you want, Spencer?
Spenser.
Look at Spencer.
He's got that cute little hug.
Oh, thank you very much, Spencer.
I'm already smoking.
He's great stillgues.
They're great.
They're tremendous.
They're mild and they're wonderful.
Or just deal them.
All right.
Now they're great.
Yeah, see he didn't deny it.
Thank you very much, Spencer.
He would not be back tonight.
There it is, Daniel.
I want to say a long week.
You're going to be here next week.
But the next week I'll be back.
Yeah, really.
Yeah, it was like that call we got a few weeks ago from the guy who, when he found out I wasn't
into sports, he was just like, so you're not into sports.
He was so amazing.
Like he had never met anyone in his entire life who wasn't, you know, a game fanatic.
And he said to me, what do you do?
You know, what in the world do you do in your life?
Is Mr. Sports do sports again this hour?
Or do we?
No.
Look at that.
What do they do?
They don't care.
Whatever we want.
They don't care.
Yeah, they don't care.
Just as long as something's going on, the phones keep flashing.
They be flashing all morning except that first thing in a vocal line, which only cause
when we get hostile.
Well, you want to do sport?
Am I right?
They relate only to hostility.
Run the whip again.
Yeah.
That'll make them get off.
Okay, folk, I'll take this.
There it goes.
It's light now.
We're watching the line.
Not enough yet.
Please, sir, man, have another.
There it goes.
Please.
Please, what?
I already let him know Spencer's here.
He wants to wash your car.
He wants your money.
Forget about the car.
Just give me your money.
Okay.
Thank you, Spencer.
Get out of here.
Money to be four-eleven at WIOD.
Tamarack.
Hello.
A holiday wish for you in the bird.
May the mucleic stew and spinker be yours through the holiday season.
That was cute.
Well, you guys are cute.
Yeah.
So what's the real purpose of your call, sir?
Just take some time off of work.
What does that mean?
I don't know.
Okay, well listen, while you're thinking about it, have a great holiday.
Okay?
Open line in Broward now.
Five, two, four.
WIOD.
Okay.
I have a feeling it's going to be like this all day and going to get worse as Christmas approaches.
Okay.
Could be.
We might just play the rack.
What are we going to do?
I put some of these people on the rack.
What are we going to do next Monday?
Yeah.
That's an excellent question.
I was really thinking seriously about staying home myself.
Mm-hmm.
Well, whatever you want to do.
Okay.
Hello.
Yeah.
Neil.
Yeah.
You know Steve Thompson from Quick to Larry?
Yeah.
This is his son.
How's his son?
Yeah.
Oh, how you doing?
Pretty good.
It's interesting the way you said that kind of like, I don't know, I'm not really sure I understand.
But how are you doing?
Good.
I've called you a couple times in the past.
Did I hang up on you?
What?
Did I hang up on you?
No, you actually talked to me.
Wow, incredible.
Why you must be a great caller?
Yeah.
I'm from Boka High.
You know.
Well, that explains a lot of things.
Yeah.
What's your first name?
James.
James Thompson.
You had to think about it there for just a second.
I understand.
Well, I understand.
It's a pressure life.
I understand it.
Especially when you go to Boka High.
Yeah.
Don't ask them how old he is.
Okay.
Okay.
How are you spending your Christmas this year?
How am I spending it?
Yeah.
I'm staying right at home and I'm going to spend it very quietly.
I'm going to go in my pool.
It's going to be beautiful.
It's going to be in the 80s all through the weekend.
I'm going to get the heat out of my pool.
Get it warm.
And I'm going to mine my own business.
Oh, great.
Isn't that great?
Yeah, it does.
I'll be going to my dad's house.
Well, that's good.
Much.
Huh?
I'm not doing that much.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, I just call him, you know, talk to him.
Just to say hi.
Yeah.
Well, that's pretty good.
I hope you have a great holiday, Jim.
I hope you do too.
Thanks a lot.
All right.
Thanks a lot.
Bye.
Let's see what you mean now.
It's 10-40, 24-11 at WIOD.
We have those Palm Beach lines open.
Where are the women this morning?
Where are these stinking women?
No, I don't want you to look.
Let's not do that.
This is not the Steve Cain show.
We don't do contrived.
You know, whatever pops up here is fine with us.
Steve has opened phones again today, by the way, which is great.
It must be the holidays.
And it was Councilman Stern that I was thinking of.
I keep forgetting his name for some reason in sunrise.
And again, I'm not going to rehash the whole thing.
Steve did a good job on it yesterday.
But the bottom line is the behavior of those people last night.
Like a bunch of barbarians.
Like just, you know, out to kill.
Yeah.
Hostile and hateful and nasty and rotten to the core.
That's sunrise.
And then I love the way the mayor.
What is his name, Larry Hoffman?
I love the way he says, well, you know, it reflects badly on some.
It gives us a bad image.
Hey, Larry, you already got a rotten image in sunrise, okay?
Who the hell in their right mind wants to go into that town?
And they say he's real happy about it.
Well, sure he is, because they hate each other.
Yeah.
Political enemies.
So naturally, he's just, you know, quietly foaming at them out.
Well, why did that happen to no other town down here?
Only Sunrise.
Well, I wouldn't say it happens in no other town.
But not to the extent.
Well, Sunrise, well, because of the nature of the people who live there.
It's the yin and the yang.
You know what I mean?
What comes around, goes around, or something like that.
Miami, hello.
Hi, Neil.
Listen, how is it that you guys can sound so relaxed and the guy taking the calls is like an appendix?
Because he, sir, do you want an answer to the question?
Yeah.
Because he just finished doing the renearie show.
Oh, that explains.
Listen, I got a couple of things for you.
Last night on Larry King's open phone.
Yes.
His first call was a guy who was talking about him being on Bob Costis.
The other day said, you were interviewed, right?
And then he plays this tape and he says, what?
Larry King knows about broadcasting.
You could put an assemble and leave a button.
Oh, yeah, that's what I said, yeah.
Yeah, I couldn't believe it.
I'm falling asleep here.
And I said, wait a minute.
I know that voice. That's Neil.
So what did Larry say?
I'm curious.
Larry hung up on him.
What do you think?
You know, Larry also did a really nasty thing.
You know, they were talking about Don Schuulah and Larry's talking about, he took some,
I don't know, it's some pretty nasty things.
And then Costis said, what a nicer guy you'll never find.
And there was a long pause.
And Larry said, yeah, nicer guy you'll never find.
A great guy.
And then Larry started in with these things about, well, there's rumors that there are a lot more drug problems on the team than just Dupor, okay?
Yeah.
Now, you know, the last thing after this season and everything that's gone wrong for him to say that on a syndicated national radio show,
so unnecessary, you know what I'm saying?
Sure.
I mean, that would be like my sitting here and saying, well, are rumors that Delarie King is the writing bad checks again?
Rumors, yeah, if you make them up, they're a rumor, sure.
But what kind of a thing was that to say totally unnecessary?
Well, you know, I got to give him a little bit of credit.
He seems like he's melancholy since his a little tiny, tiny bits since he's had his heart surgery.
Since they put that pacemaker and they shut it off every half hour just to keep him low key, huh?
Yeah, I'm not a big Delarie King fan.
And even though we, of course, are delighted to have him as part of the WIOD family, but Ersa Gawd, who's been very, very lucky, okay?
He's kissed a lot of butt and he's, you know, kissed the right butts and all of that stuff and he's making a fortune, you know?
Yeah.
Which I don't begrudge him.
I don't begrudge anybody making a living.
But he's, he put himself on his pedestal and he just thinks that he's God.
Mm-hmm.
And he's never asked a tough question in his life, which is why all these guests just love coming back.
At the beginning of every interview he does on CNN, my good friend Jerry Falwell, my good friend Edolf Howler, and my good friend.
So no matter who it is, immediately you know he's not going to ask the real tough questions because he's a butt liquor, okay?
Like Tom Snyder right before.
Exactly.
All right, listen, I got a couple more things.
But we're delighted to have them as part of the WIOD family.
The guy that does...
And Dean is a friend of WIOD.
Ha, ha, ha.
The guy that does...
Even though we wish he'll keep his decrepit old act and fill it off you.
The guy that does the voiceovers for IOD.
He's like the...
Scott.
God, yeah exactly.
He's, you know, I mean when you guys were on AM it was Jay all over till you were puking.
And then now on IOD you've got this guy but he's got a better voice but he does everything.
He's great.
And I've heard him on on WIOD doing what's his name?
Austin Burke commercial.
He does voiceovers.
I work for specs and we got some Christmas tapes.
He did the voiceovers there.
Yeah.
Somebody said, hey I think I heard that guy's voice at Epcot when we were up there.
Probably.
You know, it could be the guy is an incredible voice.
He works for IOD.
Yeah, he hangs around with Disney.
That's why he's at Epcot.
And the last thing, Neil.
You noticed that was just...
Oh, yes.
Yeah, he does actually work here, sir.
Okay.
And he's on GTR and I hear him on Channel 11.
Oh yeah, and now my question.
Did he do the Jamaican Bodflit?
Yeah.
Okay, all right.
Put that one to bet.
The last thing is the bit you played, you mama.
It was done by a couple of friends of mine.
There it comes.
That's right.
I don't need a rush.
Where they?
Go ahead.
And I think we should give credit where credit is due.
Okay, I'm sorry that I left that slip home.
That's okay.
I would have worn it to work.
I would have worn it to work today.
And now turn it on.
Yeah.
It's by a guy who interestingly enough, who was recently won a Princess Engineer in Minneapolis.
And his name is Eddie Miller.
And was done by, and the Neil Rogers part was dubbed by another guy, Eddie, and another guy named Jim, who also works for specs.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
And I want to make sure that if they're listening to me.
The mail just came here.
No, I want to thank them very much because it's a great, and I'm very appreciative.
All right.
And the last thing is if they're listening, I just want to make sure they understand that they are douchebags and mungrains.
Okay, have a great name.
Thank you.
Hi.
Okay, well, that's not too bad.
There are two things of mail, but one of them is like not all that fold.
So it's not D.
Oh, no, no, wait a minute.
Oh, we're not ready here yet.
Okay, it's 10.50.
Well, we got all this mail.
I'm just drowning in mail.
Yeah.
Well, by the way, fat rich has called city will be here around noon.
And of course, we trust that means with lunch from Flores, including my salad.
Please.
We're not pleased or else.
We don't want to be pushy or anything.
He's a great guy, but you know, he made a commitment.
Mm-hmm.
Or did I make it for him?
I think you made it for him.
Well, that's too bad.
Okay, it's all right.
Okay, here's, look at this.
I've opened up three checks.
I haven't gotten to the tapes yet.
It's 200 bucks.
$100 check in 250s for a camel sauce.
This is great.
This is, you know, just be on belief.
Miami, hello.
I know.
Yeah.
I know.
Okay.
What's up?
I like a board operator that he's relaxed.
But doing the renearies show would have you like him.
That guy doesn't even repeat things twice.
Well, Mike wants to make sure you hear it.
He says everything twice because he's got a lot of people in his audience who are hardy hearing.
He knows what, he's been in his town a long time.
He knows where he is.
Obviously.
You bet.
You can play the...
Now, man, is this isn't a request, isn't it?
It's a...
Didn't I say very clearly that I was not doing a request today?
Didn't I say that as clearly and as articulately it is humanly possible to say?
But doing for a nice two is for us.
No.
Your mom and you.
No.
What's happening?
What?
What did he say?
He made him mad because you would play a three-kid.
He was mumbling.
I couldn't understand it was probably something really obscene.
I had no idea.
Now, what is this?
With a tape.
I've been following you from station to station since the days you first appeared on WKT.
Thank you for the tape.
There's no tape in it.
Another one of the...
There's no tape.
Well, credible.
Some of you people, man, play stupid, you know, but I think the bottom line.
Although it's a $25 check.
So Annie and Holly Wood will...
We'll come up with a tape.
I'm going to go out and buy a bunch of 90 minutes.
Because as I shouldn't say that on the year though, because...
Oh, no.
...because look at this.
Next check from Ed in Pompo-no Beach.
$200.
And he doesn't even want a tape, okay?
Yeah.
Good.
Boy, this is incredible.
Two, three.
I just...
I can't get over this.
10.53 at WIOD will go...
Oh, sunrise.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm not going to say a word about the count, so we could like to care less.
Okay.
How about the people who live there and behave like barbarians?
Well, I don't see where that people behave like barbarians.
I've been living here for 10 years.
Like animals like this disgusting subhuman vultures who want everybody's skin who just can't
wait to make somebody miserable and hostile.
I'd like to talk about what you said Friday, if you don't mind.
About...
In fact, this caller sounded a little bit hostile already.
About Karen Carpenter?
What about it?
You are picking on a dead person when you pick on her.
Yeah, and I have a disease.
What do you mean I'm picking on her?
Well, you were sitting there saying, you know, let's go on to Karen Carpenter died.
No, I didn't say let's go on to Karen Carpenter died.
I said that one of our people here looks like she's on to Karen Carpenter died.
I mean that she looks anorexic.
My brother told me to tune in and...
And you don't like the show, so rather than just tuning it out, you've got to call...
It figures you're from sunrise, okay?
Yeah, that's what you're talking about.
How old are you?
How old are you?
29.
I'm old enough to know better, okay?
I'm old enough to know that if I don't like something, I don't call a guy and tell him how to do the show.
I turn on something else, okay?
Yeah, and...
Oh, yeah.
What are you laughing about?
What's so funny?
What's so funny, pal?
You used to be somebody that was on issues I heard.
I don't do issues, sir.
Issues talking issues in this town is like...
When you're doing a radio show in a cemetery, okay, sir?
When you came out of the closet, you left your brain in it.
Yeah, that's right.
And you know something?
I think you ought to go back into closet.
Sunrise.
Sunrise.
Yeah.
And hang it around there for too long with those old parts.
29 years old and he sounds like a 70 year old old fart.
That's your problem, okay?
And as soon as he started protesting, he lived there for how many years?
Yeah.
10 years and he doesn't see any of that.
What are you doing, sir?
Are you hiding in a closet with blinders on?
I guess you ought to be out of your mind not to see the way those people behave up there.
I think he likes it.
It's like, you know, once you cross the plantation, sunrise line, it's like you've gone into a sun city or something.
It's unbelievable.
I think he's been on the Karen Carpenter brain diet.
I think that's his problem.
No sense of humor.
Everything has got to be taken literally.
Mm-hmm.
Boy, can just imagine him writing his letters in another 10, 15 years, right?
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
Why don't you get out some prune juice and give yourself a good brain animus, sir?
Plantation.
Hello.
Hello.
And Merry Christmas to him, too.
Yes.
Yeah, Merry Christmas to you, too.
And happy tissue, both.
What do you want, sir?
Um, I just want to call and tell you I think you're showing great, you and the bird.
No, it's not.
We're terrible.
We pick on Karen Carpenter and dead people who were disgusting.
How am I else?
You dead, anyway.
Yeah, that's right.
So, Elvis is dead.
Well, Elvis may or may not be dead, but they're doing a lot of stuff on him.
I don't hear him complaining about Elvis.
No, well.
I think he's probably in a closet with Karen Carpenter's picture.
Probably got a Karen Carpenter blow-up doll.
Doesn't take a lot of air to fill it up.
What is it about three pounds?
What's that?
Not sell these from sunrises.
I know, but I'm just getting here.
There are people in sunrise, man.
Those of us who live in plantation, we want sunrise off the map, okay?
That's right.
We want them all to move at least to Tamarack and maybe up to Coral Springs.
Oh, God.
Coral Springs is pretty repressive.
That's where these people would be happy.
I just wanted to call because you said nobody from plantation ever called yesterday.
That is true.
Well, people in plantation are a little more mellow.
They got other things to do.
You know, they listen, but they have other things to do.
They're really mellow.
People in sunrise, they haven't got a damn thing to do, but be miserable and terrible.
Try to share it with everybody else like that last douchebag.
I don't want to get hung up on him, but what an idiot.
This is true.
Thank God his brother released his got some taste, okay?
Uh-huh.
His brother's 106.
Bert, I think you're great too, no buts.
Thank you, sir.
Well, listen, have a wonderful holiday, sir.
We needed a little moral support.
Your balance to the balance to the...
Uh-huh.
We appreciate it.
I love plantation.
So do I.
It's a great American city.
Vacation to.
You too.
Fuck you, Larry.
What do you say?
Uh-huh.
We have an open line and don't know.
It's a promoter.
It doesn't make any difference after that one idiot from sunrise.
Creeping death.
That's what sunrise...
Like sunrise lakes.
Phase two.
Somebody ought to put something in their metamusel over there in sunrise.
That's what they ought to do.
Make them do a little Mexican tap dance out in the middle of university driving.
You might get them to go a little bit faster.
It might motivate them to put their foot on a goddamn gas and go somewhere.
Instead of sitting there in their battleships in the middle of the road,
go in 10 miles an hour, acting like they're all in a way to Burger King.
We should fix them up with that 40-year-old lady from Fort Lauderdale, you know,
the one who once saw the young people last season Martin Jr.
Yeah.
They would be a great couple.
Oh, we got another call from sunrise.
Yeah, it's hello, Neil.
Yeah.
Hello CS.
Yeah.
How you doing?
Listen.
Easy for you to say.
Listen, Neil.
You don't know that last guy, do you?
I know I don't.
I've been here only for about two years.
Well, get the hell out of there before it's too late.
You wind up just like him, sir.
That's what I'm planning to, I'm planning to get out of here.
People here are pretty old, pretty grouchy.
And nasty, rotten, bio-vulgarate, disgusting, sub-human.
That's right.
And hateful.
Everything's true.
You say a lot.
The way they drive.
We don't have, we don't have any adultery here in sunrise.
That's right.
Of course not, because most of the people live in sunrise can't even do it, okay?
Yeah.
I also like to talk about it.
Like Patties, Patties place, they, you know, have a little wiggle is about all they ever got.
In the last 20 years.
Yeah.
That's true.
I also like to.
The only thing they were wiggling was their animal bag.
Uh-huh.
I don't want to get, I don't want to get emotional on this, okay?
Because I know it's almost Christmas.
Yeah.
I like the weather down here.
And I like the city, but the people who live here.
That's right.
I'm sure you hit it.
You are perfect.
Absolutely right on target.
The weather is great.
The climate is great.
The natural beauty is great.
It's the people that suck.
You're absolutely right.
That's right.
Oh, let me ask you how old are you?
20 years old.
20 years old.
I beg you.
I plead with you.
Get out of sunrise before it's too late.
Okay.
There's still time.
I'm telling you, it's still time for you.
You sound like you still have it together.
Get out of that deal.
Yeah.
Before they make you into one of them.
I don't think you're, I don't understand why I shook it out.
Maybe they shook it out.
That's even better.
I'll move to sunrise and we'll get them all out.
That's right.
It's not a state.
Okay.
Well, listen, have a great Christmas.
All right, you'll take care.
Okay.
Bye.
Oh, my God.
What a November.
What a summer.
It's turning.
I'm ready to blow my brains out.
I thought we were going to have a nice, it's almost Christmas day.
You're so nice.
I know.
These people, they couldn't give a damn bless.
We have an open line in Broward.
Five, two, four, nine, four, six, three.
Let's put that one guy on the Karen Carpenter diet, okay?
Because he made me want to stick my finger way down my throat.
Five, two, four, WIOD in Broward.
Gail Bright has the 11 o'clock news and we'll come back to you.
Fascinating.
Okay.
Enough with the mail.
Um, it's 11.05 at WIOD.
Do you want to thank Susity Sue for her $25 check for Camila Sounds?
I haven't heard from her in a while.
I don't want to thank Craig Worling for the note and acute cartoon.
That Craig Christmasy, right?
Isn't that cute?
And that's about where we are.
Okay, it's 11.05 and we're going to go back to the phones.
We got our first call from Pittsburgh.
Hello.
How you doing?
Pittsburgh.
Actually, I'm in Greenberg, which is a little west of Pittsburgh.
Greenberg, that's where the Mountain View Inn is.
Oh, yes, and the fact it is.
Are you really there?
Are you just pulling my leg?
No, I swear.
In fact, I got to come home early now.
Be patient with what I've been sitting on hold.
That will be able to afford to stay up here.
Well, whatever you do, don't go to the Meadows, man.
I'm not sure where the Meadows is.
Probably, but it's in Washington, PA.
It's probably not open this time of year anyway.
I'm sure it's not.
Wait, we got here.
Well, first time here was real cold.
Now it's like in the 50s.
It's getting real cold again.
Of course, me and my wife are both really sick now.
But we got here right after the football game of the Pittsburgh.
Well, you got there after the game.
Right, then I said.
Well, that's good because it postponed your sickness a little while, I guess.
I mean, you got in there before the game.
You'd really be sick.
Well, the local media really criticized Miami fans
because of all these trade rumors about Marino and how they're all criticizing Marino after a 44-hour, you know, a hundred yard performance.
And the stealer stayed there.
They're sold out.
They've been sold out for every, though.
They had a lasty year.
And they're thinking, how the hell can you complain about a Dan Marino?
How can fans not be supporting it, especially when things are going down?
The people in the paper that we've been more than happy to have them up here?
But that's true.
There's really a rag amount of it.
If it's involved, 100%.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, like I said, they can't sell out even a brand new stadium and all rest of that stuff.
But, you know, it's not from being sick and not being able to listen to you guys for another seven days.
It's really painful.
Not anyway.
But I was good sitting on hold listening to the sunrise people kind of made me feel like I'm home again.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Feel right at home, don't you?
Listen to those miserable nasty rotten disgusting subhuman while it was really only one.
Right before I left Boca, it was a new Albert since it's Boca.
It just opened up.
They had these hot dogs.
Now, we get a hot dog for a quarter, hot dog or a coke for a quarter.
There's big sign on there.
And it's only maybe a mile from the century village in Boca.
So, they loaded up buses and came out to get their quarter hot dogs.
Oh, boy.
You should have seen.
They were complaining bitterly.
This one guy was complaining because he thought it was a quarter for both a hot dog and a coke.
And another one was mad because they weren't kosher.
Yeah.
You got it.
Oh, wait.
We're right to a seat.
One last South Florida story before I left.
We went up to the Atlanta Christmas tree before we left.
And the old people were complaining because there were too many little kids under a foot made it difficult to walk around.
Yeah.
And why was the old people out there at the Christmas tree before they got in with?
That reminds me of that old fart from New England who called to tell me that all the race tracks up there closed up because of the miners because they let kids in the track.
And they used to spill their hamburgers all over the old people.
Well, anything for free because they don't charge anything at the Christmas tree.
So anything for free because the bus is lined in that way.
Yeah.
Well, listen, maybe we could get them free transportation out of town.
That's going to be cool.
If we could get them to fight on that one, man, I'd chip in.
Believe me, that'll be our next collection drive.
That was a go-al-procorder hot dog just to keep on heading north.
There you go.
And I was going to talk to you again.
Okay, listen, have a safe when you're coming back.
Hello back to the 20th and the 29th unless you're yet.
Well, just enjoy it while you can.
It may be cold, but there might be a few living and breeding folks up there.
Those people up here are pretty normal. It's amazing.
Yeah. Okay.
Take care.
Okay, bye.
Kauffman Pittsburgh, stick a pin in the map there yesterday.
We had a call from Joja.
Mm-hmm.
Poor the male here is just incredible today.
I haven't even gotten to the tapes yet on a Gotta Lee's checks.
How do you like that?
Great.
How do you like them, apples?
Okay, we've got two open lines and of course there are the Palm Beach lines.
Boka 278, WIOD, and why do I even bother?
You know, Palm Beach, 655, WIOD.
Why even waste my time?
Now you understand when they call from up there, they're calling from a different area code.
You know, I don't know if that's a factor in anything.
Don't you understand?
They don't have to dial one. It doesn't cost them anything.
I understand that.
These lines are in their area code.
Yeah, I know.
But they are in another area code.
It's no use.
They're in another zone.
That's one other I don't say.
That's Miami. Hello.
Hello? Yeah.
Is this Nail?
Yes.
Is this Open Show?
Is it what?
It is an Open Show.
No, we're discussing brain surgery today, sir.
I would like to know why you saw on kind of old people.
Yeah, why are you so unkind to me, sir?
Because you're a subhuman retard.
Some of you induce back, you mean?
No, you're a subhuman retard.
Oh, okay. You having a good time today?
I will much rather listen to Sandy Payton and listen to him.
Well, let me ask you a question.
Okay?
Yes.
You think you could answer it?
Can you handle this, sir?
Yeah, I can answer it.
Since Sandy is on right now, why aren't you listening to her show?
Because I just had to call and tell her you...
No, no, wait a minute.
You couldn't possibly have been hearing what a subhuman creep and I am
if you were listening to Sandy show.
Why aren't you listening to her show?
Why should I listen to her show?
You just got through saying you'd rather listen to her any day.
Didn't you just say that or am I hallucinating?
You're hallucinating. You're a retard.
Okay.
Ten minutes after 11 at WIOD.
Merry Christmas, everybody.
Hey, listen, I couldn't give it to him.
I'm opening up these checks.
We got enough money here to sync a banal shift for Camila's house
and the people are really doing it.
And it's the amorons who have nothing better to do who are...
I think the lambs call for them.
Yeah, just like him.
The lambs call for them.
I think the amorons in sunrise and boy, when they find out about it,
they're going to be really upset.
Remember Irving from Homestead?
I'm his brother Howard.
You should have hung up on him the first time he called.
PSZetaSucks.
Wonderful card from Homestead.
Yeah, you know Irving from Homestead?
Chronic.
Oh, Chronic caller.
I bet you Nick puts him on.
Here in C.
Nick puts every...
He denies it, but he puts every Chronic caller on.
Okay, it's 11 past 11 at WIOD.
We have an open line in date if you move real quickly,
like if you're in Homestead at 7519463.
And I want to tell you about it.
Kick and ask with 50,000 watts of power all over South Florida
from the keys to the Palm Beaches, even out to the Bahamas.
This is WIOD.
1114 at WIOD.
Get those letters right now.
19,067 bucks was our total coming into the day for CamillaSounds.
I'm not even a tenth of the way through the tapes that are in here.
Just do the letters.
And they're going to be like 5,6,700 bucks here already in checks.
So we got a real good shot at that 25 grand,
which will buy them the van plus many thousands left over
to make sure that they have plenty of food and goodies for a Christmas.
Okay, a lot of day I'll buy the sea.
Hello.
Hi, how you doing, Neil?
Okay.
I just wanted to tell you that you're a panic on this.
So all these women are ragging on you.
I think it's incredible.
All these women are ragging on me?
Well, all the women I'm listening all morning.
I mean, they're probably not pretty terrific with their husbands
because they're ragged,
taking all their frustrations out on you.
Yeah.
Well, good.
I'm glad they got these.
I'm sure that all the assholes are moving from sunrise
into Lwaterdale by the sea because I'm a storm merchant here, no?
You're a what?
A new storm merchant.
I have a story down here at Lwaterdale by the sea.
Oh, yeah.
Good luck to you.
What good luck to me.
They're all attitudes city here too.
Yeah.
Well, it's kind of like a suburb of sunrise.
Yeah.
You're terrific.
Okay.
Thank you.
Good luck to you.
Bye-bye.
1116 at WI-LD.
And we have an open line in Broward 524 at WI-LD.
524-9463.
Miami Beach, hello.
Yes, Neil.
I got bless you for everything.
By the way, I have a couple of items.
I hope you won't cut me off.
I probably will, sir.
You're pretty old.
Why are we putting all these old people on the phone, Nick?
Nick just loves to do this to me, man.
Now, where?
The older they get, the sooner they get on.
Immediately.
53, I'm not going to go.
Like I said, your ancient pal.
Cut.
Now, it's just a little joke.
It's a little...
Sookist joke.
Yeah, me.
Left over from October.
What is that?
Oh, it's an empty box.
Thank God.
Don't bring any more mail in here.
I'll get sick.
Go ahead, sir.
Yeah, me.
Let me tell you a little personal thing that...
You have a little personal thing.
So we don't discuss that kind of stuff on this show.
They were...
They were singing chest pups in the open fire before.
And I went to a high school, grammar school, and Hebrew school with a mouse or a me who wrote
that song in Chicago.
Oh, who cares?
Yeah.
That's exciting.
Neil, I got a terrific connoir for you.
Oh, look at that.
There's the mystery picker.
Yeah.
Oh, that's right.
You're my picket dresser.
That's cute.
What do you want, sir?
I'd like to hear the connoir.
You don't want to hear your life story about Mel Termay and you want to...
You know, with AJ Dewey at the SNS cafeteria.
We don't want to hear that.
You have something that we can sink our teeth into.
I'd listen.
Like some rotten halava.
Yeah, the connoir.
Yeah, put boring under.
You're the one that put them on, okay?
Not me.
You're the one that put them up first.
I'm not going to...
You know, he likes to put this boring crap on his screen.
Right.
You couldn't tell that by talking to this guy.
It was 150.
You're pretending to be 63.
What do you have this, though?
You just left the one off the front of the age, yeah.
Okay, what do you have this, that's good.
How's your brother Mathusa doing, sir?
Yeah, basically, you're super well.
Are you all...
God, almighty.
I feel like I'm back at KAT again.
Yeah, there are two teams.
There are two teams.
Yeah, there are two teams.
Yeah, there are two teams.
Very good, sir.
One of them is coached by Mel Tormay.
Let me tell you where they're going to be.
Maybe this is the guy that's hanging over the fire in the woman's sand.
Nothing like test nuts roasting over an open fire, yeah.
Yeah, there this is a very good connoir.
There's a connection between these two teeth.
Oh, God.
Listen, it's been nice talking to you, sir.
And I hope you have a wonderful chavuist.
It's 1118 at WIOD.
What a cool.
And we have an open line in date.
If you move real quickly, you can fill up the line where this guy was just doing his geratol.
751-9463.
Do you believe that?
I didn't expect this date today.
This day today.
I wasn't here opening the mail, figuring, well, it's the holiday week.
Let's just...
I should never ever forget where I am.
And every once in a while, I get carried away.
And I watch the weather channel this morning and they have the five day forecast.
And it's going to be in the 80s and it's going to be great.
And I'm not one of those people who wants it to be cold at Christmas.
We already had our cold snap.
I like it to be in the 80s.
I like it to be warm.
I like to go in the pool and enjoy life.
And that kind of thing.
And I thought, boy, this is going to be great.
And then of course, we came in here.
Miramar, hello.
Yeah, hi, Neil.
Yeah.
It's a young guy from Miramar calling.
Well, I'll be damned.
You must know Johnny Depp.
Johnny, yeah.
He's a good friend of mine.
Yeah, you guys probably once lived in that car together.
No, really, he is.
He was a small car.
He was a little bit bad here than that car with a whole bunch of guys.
We went to school with him at Miramar.
He worked out in the same gym that I worked at.
Really?
You don't know Bobby Deerin, do you?
Sure.
The lone crusader.
Oh, God.
The lone crusader.
He's for the help.
Yeah.
And Dave Caprita worked out in there every day.
We're really getting it today, aren't we?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So all I need is to hear from Bobby Deerin wishing me a happy weekend.
Neil, listen.
Yeah.
This is Bobby.
And I call him to wish him a happy holiday.
19 past 11 at WIOD.
We have two open lines in power.
If you move quickly now, five, two, four, nine, four, six, three.
I see.
I'm going to.
Isn't that interesting how I mentioned that.
Yeah.
You know how Cap and Dave used to lay on the floor?
Yeah.
I'm going to get down on the floor today.
I'm going to get down on the floor and pray today.
I may get religion.
I may take it up today.
I'm going to try it.
Yeah.
Rich asks that you announce the car mine that he's coming to pick up your food.
That rich.
He's been driving that big puddle jumper for too long.
That big battleship.
He's getting just like those people in sunrise now.
In other words, he wants to make sure he doesn't have to pay for it.
That's what he's trying to say.
Ah, this is a thing.
You know what they say in sunrise.
They get very upset if you pay for it.
That's what they say.
That's what they say.
That's the best idea.
They get a real upset if you have to pay for it.
Yeah.
Because we don't have any of that going on in sunrise.
Yeah, that's right.
Even the young people are impotent in sunrise, okay?
Once you cross the border, there are sunrise boulevard and you go about a, I don't know,
it's half a block.
Half a long block and you get to that sign and it says like a plantation wishes you good
luck in sunrise.
Something like that, it says.
And then you know you're in real deep trouble.
Oh, sunrise is on fire.
Hello.
I don't like the way you're talking about people from some, oh, what a phony voice.
Or come on, can't you do better than that?
I can't you do better than that.
Okay, sir, can I get you to start over again?
Come on, try a different voice.
I hope that, I hope that fell from some action goes down there, ripped your face off.
Yeah, okay.
What a bad phony voice, okay?
And he wasn't even from sunrise.
He was from a lot of day of lakes.
I don't want to get that lady up.
So, but I, I could tell by the accident he was from a lot of day of lakes, couldn't you?
Dead giveaway.
That lot of day of lakes, I could.
Yeah, it sounded like he had a mouthful of marbles or something.
Like he had the Claude Pepper syndrome.
When's the end of the bulletin film?
Then the number 10.
What a place this is, man.
This state, no wonder the state is shaped like the way it is, okay?
Well, this is really a festive show today.
It sure is like a festival.
I'm so happy that I could just, I don't know whether the screen will reach 16 bananas.
I'll let the spirit.
But we do have an open line in Broward now.
Oh no, it's flashing.
Look at that on the screwed up phone system where it flashes intermittently, you know.
Well, that's an old phone system.
It's tired. It flashes a little bit, then it takes a little Cesta.
And then it flashes again.
And sooner or later, Nick answers it.
If it's somebody real old, he puts him on right away.
If it's somebody ancient, somebody who sounds at least 500 years old.
Mobile.
Hello, Neil. How are you?
Okay.
First time, call it good to hear.
Well, welcome to a real exciting show today, sir.
Yeah, you got some winners.
We're doing it, boy.
Listen, I wanted to give you a figure report.
Yeah.
But you know that the people, you know, the state troopers are doing their job well down here.
We got Bimbo in a brown wrapper, running up and down, Dixie Highway.
A Bimbo in a brown wrapper.
I like that. That'd be a good name for a song with it.
Well, she just pulling cars over like you would believe.
I was sitting here watching her and I just cannot believe this girl is gone.
She's been just steady hour and a half pulling people over.
You know, it's just unbelievable.
They're getting their quarter real quick.
Now, where is that? Where is this?
This is at Southwest 248 Street.
Oh, between 248 and 228.
Way down there, huh?
Oh, yeah. I'm deep, that dark as a bomb stand.
Yeah.
So anyway, just want to make this a quick one and wish you all a Merry Christmas.
Okay, and the same to you, sir.
Alrighty.
Okay. Good luck to you.
A little WIOD pig report there.
It's 11.23.
But maybe we're going to take a lot of calls from Sunrise today.
We do have an open line in Broward.
That's our one line that if you want to get in on right now.
If you're in Sunrise, only please.
We would love to hear from you.
Get it out of your system, okay?
Start the new year with an empty...
Why is that?
Okay, it's already on there, man.
That's great. Okay, 23 past 11.
We'll take a little birdie.
11.26 at WIOD.
We got something very special now that we just opened and it's in the waste basket.
Part of it.
Our first French Canadian for the Camille House.
Unusual.
Filled with expletives, vulgarity, grotesque, barbaric crap,
and their contribution, you'll hear it dropping on the table for the Camille House ladies and gentlemen.
It's a Canadian quarter which is worth about 20 cents.
Maybe 21 and a half, 22.
Okay, 27 past 11 at WIOD and let's go to a brown.
Hello.
Let me try it again. Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Hi.
I've sent my money for brother Paul.
Great. How much do you send?
I don't know.
Oh.
A lot.
A lot? What a dollar?
I don't know.
You don't know.
A lot.
I was sitting for a bike and then I sent it to brother Paul instead.
Well, that's good.
It was very nice of you.
Oh.
You want to hear a joke?
No.
Why not?
No, no jokes.
Mary Christmas.
I guess.
Bye.
Wait.
What?
Did you see Santa coming to town?
Yeah, I saw Santa.
It is fingering his nose.
Okay, you have a nice holiday.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye, my dear.
28 past 11 at WIOT.
Miami.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I like to, I hate you.
It's so difficult working on those two days that everybody else is off.
I'd like to come in and do the show for you on the bird.
No thanks, pal.
It's 11.28.
We have an open line in each county in date and brown.
751 W.
If you keep putting these old people on, I'm going to do an hour on you.
I'm really going to do an expose on all the crank calls on everything.
Trust me.
Keep putting these old.
Or just hang up on them.
I don't even want them on hold.
Just get rid of them.
He's enjoying it.
He's a sadist.
Well, if that comes.
I like Mike on the other day.
Put some Bob from Poppano on every ten minutes.
Put some Phil on.
Phil.
A.K.A.
Harvey Jr.
A.K.A.
Paying in his ass.
What a maniac.
Okay, hello.
Hello, Larry.
Yes, sir.
Yep.
Happy holidays to you and everybody there.
And the same to you.
Thank you very much.
I wanted to say a few things.
I could be triter, easily.
Yeah.
What's Bluefield?
West Bloomfield.
I'll be done with it.
I'm going to die.
And I just heard Steve talk about the Madame.
But I got to talk about Lafayette Cornie.
Does that ring a bell?
Well, of course, those incredible hot dogs.
Not as good as Don and Bob's and Rochester, but a whole different category.
No, no, no.
I don't have a problem choice.
But they're great.
They were great.
I'm going up there right after the first year.
In fact, a friend of a friend of mine was the gentleman who started that whole chain.
The Cornie Island thing up there.
Right.
Owned it.
Right.
Many years ago.
Can you tell me, did he also know the next door called the American Cornie Island?
I don't have any idea.
You're Lafayette.
Lafayette was on Lafayette Street right under the courthouse there.
Yeah.
And right next door was a day open up another one, which was called the American Cornie Island.
Now, do you remember a Polynesian restaurant?
I think it was on Bagley Street.
Casson Bagley called the Chintiki.
They had the big handles on the door.
Chintiki.
I don't go running out of here.
There he goes.
All we got to do is reminisce about any city that he isn't from and he leaves the building.
Okay.
Goodbye.
Lock the door and keep him out.
Okay.
I'm tired of the grinch that stole Christmas.
I got to least cranks on here and right away he's getting hysterical.
You know, in those days, you know, there were some good restaurants and he tried.
And, uh, Kompikki was one of them.
Yup.
London Shop House is still there to pink it.
Can you believe that, sir, are you going to listen to me?
Topink is his clothes now.
Is that right?
No, not the one I grandriver.
Closed.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Well, hey, stay like it.
Everything comes, everything goes.
Yup. Well, I think you check for Camilla Thouse and I hope you get it.
Thank you.
Have a very happy hour.
You too. Thanks a lot.
See, I enjoy reminiscing and there are a lot of people who relate to that.
Now he's coming back.
No, we didn't say you could come back in yet.
We're going to do an hour on Rochester now.
Just try to mellow out.
What do you please?
Will you just try to stop being so emotional?
I didn't say anything.
Sensitive.
No, you got up and you walked out.
Well, and there are a lot of people applauding, you know.
They don't, uh, don't count your chickens before they hatch.
I just, well, as they say in a gum business, don't count your chicklets before they hatch.
Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yeah.
Hi, how are you doing?
Pretty good.
Good.
I'm glad.
The front of the column say hi to you in the bird.
Oh, this is frightening.
It is not only a female voice, but it's somebody under the age of 200.
That's right.
It's somebody with an IQ of over two who isn't agitated.
It was friendly and sounds like she's in a really good mood.
I'm in a great mood.
I'm not at work today.
I'm playing hooky.
Great. I don't blame you.
I'm in a wonderful mood.
And I just want to say, um, good to have you guys back on AM again.
Thank you.
This happened days, but we still have one.
Yeah.
Well, one day he'll get out from over there and get into a real place.
I hope so.
Poor Dave.
I know.
He's not a happy camper.
No, I don't think so either.
I'm a lot happier with you guys.
Yeah.
And what's a good movie I can rent today, Neil?
Rent.
What's a good movie you can rent?
Yeah.
China girl.
China girl.
I don't give me a sour.
Look, just give me a sour.
Look, get out of here.
Your paste is in your toy show.
Okay, get away from me, Nick.
What he knows about movies you can put in a thimble and have room for the godfather left over.
China girl though, you're right.
How about, did you see network?
Yeah, many times on TV.
Oh, okay.
What, what are some one other one?
One more?
Yeah.
This is a good movie, though.
Ponderous.
Ponderous.
Hmm.
Let's see.
Boy, this is tough.
You seen the witches of Eastwood?
Yeah, I saw that a couple of times.
That was great.
Yeah, it was good.
I mean, when you just ask out of the blue, you know, a video story, it got like 2000 titles.
It's pretty hard just to pick out one.
Yeah, but you never know which ones are going to be good.
How about once upon a time in America?
That'd kill most of the day for you.
That's a long one.
But it's good.
Excellent.
It's a little peculiar, but it's very good.
Once upon a time, yeah.
Yeah, it's kind of like the godfather.
Oh, right.
No, it's really good.
You'd enjoy it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Now, you haven't seen it.
I'm telling you, it's a long, it's like about three and a half hours.
Oh, wow.
It's a long one.
And take the most of the afternoon.
Yeah.
In fact, just counting James Wood's Zits will take up a good part of your day.
I think you'll enjoy it.
Okay.
Okay.
You see Rain Man yet?
No, not yet, but I plan on seeing it this weekend.
Please.
I'm telling you, everybody who has seen it just except Nick, of course, you probably won't go to see it because it's too good, but everybody loves it.
Yeah, it's gotten great reviews.
Okay, you have a good one.
Have a great holiday.
See you too.
Bye-bye.
Boy, what a breath of fresh air.
She was 11 feet long.
It's been several weeks.
Mm-hmm.
And let's keep it that way.
Open line in date, 751 WIOD, and in Broward, 524-9463, a mobile on six.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to nail the little thing.
Every little thing is okay.
That's good to hear.
Listen, I'm a clothing salesman.
I represent a company that manufactures goods.
And I have a box full of samples I'm going to get to the Camilla House.
Excellent.
Now, what I need for you is the word to bring it, or I know you're giving the address to this place in Pompena.
That was forwarding things there.
Where are you?
I'm in Florida now.
Unfortunately, I was just in Pompena, and now I'm driving towards your home town of plantation.
Okay, now wait a minute.
Let me look up.
I got the address somewhere of the quick delivery people who have been very kind and who have agreed to transport stuff from Broward down to Camilla House.
And as soon as I find it, which I know that it's here, trust me any moment, any second.
Is that record Senate's WIOD?
Yeah, but you could do that, but it would be a lot easier if you just took it over to quick delivery.
I don't have it.
I'm sure that Sharon must have it somewhere.
I'll give it on a year, okay?
All right, let me ask one more question.
Yeah.
You think this would be in lieu of $20?
I'd love to have a tape.
Sure.
Okay.
I mean, unless it's a can of green peas or something.
I don't know. It's a box full of samples that they can put under backs.
Sure.
You bet.
So what do we do next?
What do we do next?
I got to find out what to send it.
No, no, I said if I'll just hang up and then I'll get the address sometime.
Just keep listening and I'll get the address from Sharon or somebody of quick delivery.
Okay.
And I'll give it on the year and then just send the tape into me and just let me know who you are and what you did and whatever.
And we'll get the tape out to you.
Sounds mighty fair.
Okay.
All right.
And we appreciate it.
Happy holidays.
Same to you.
1145 at WIOD, we have an open line in Broward, 5249463.
One thing about the collars today, I will say this, they've either been really nice like this gentleman and the lady, the young lady to call, or they've been really grotesque.
Nothing in between.
Like two or three that I can think of in particular, especially the one, the young mongbrain from sunrise.
29.
Who proves that being a prune is not a chronological state of age, but the state of mind.
You've said that for a long time.
Many, many times.
It's not old people that I get upset by.
It's people who behave like they're 180, going on 500 nasty, crotchety, hostile, bitchy, mobile.
Hello.
Take this.
And this.
Pretty weak.
Pretty weak.
And it's the more.
Yeah.
Okay.
Let's go to sunrise.
Yeah.
Happy New Year, Neil and Bert.
Yeah.
We're just great.
Yeah, especially with the collars from sunrise.
Uh-huh.
Well, I just wanted to give you two quick points that lady they called before looking for a rental movie left about a year ago.
You made a coast classic out of a movie called The Hitcher.
Oh, yeah. The Hitcher.
If she hasn't seen that, she better get it right away.
I know.
I know a lot of people have enjoyed that after you recommended it.
I have a virgin copy of it at my house, but I'm not giving it up.
I'm sure not.
And the other best point I want to make being from sunrise here five years, I can't help but agree with you.
All except the one point about the adultery.
I mean, we all live here in sunrise.
I'm in a community of family oriented people.
And we all go out and commit adultery every other day of the week.
I mean, uh, what's the big deal around here?
I mean, everybody's doing it.
I thought it was the thing to do.
Well, the ones who can't do it, those are the ones who are the most upset.
Don't you understand, which is the majority of sunrise?
All right.
But, you know, I was at that council meeting left night also, and they are just...
What a bunch of animals.
You thought they wanted to take this guy out and string him up or something.
And they just don't know where it's at.
I mean, all they got to do is ask anybody under 40 years old whether they do commit adultery.
And the answer is going to be yes.
I mean, let's face it.
Well, first of all, you know, I think back, do you remember the thing in Congress when Jerry Studs and the guy from Illinois, what's his name?
The right winger's brother from Illinois who got...
But Jerry Studs got reelected, even though he had sex with a page, a young page.
Oh, yeah.
You know, a teenage boy.
And he got reelected.
It was nobody.
The only came out of the closet and everything.
Can you imagine the same thing happening here?
I mean, we have got the most hateful, the most narrow-minded, the most rotten core of old farts that was ever born in this town.
Well, just want to let you know we're young unfarts around here too.
They're not alone here.
All right.
Okay.
Thank you.
And a good thing, of course, to keep in mind is those people are all going to die real soon, okay?
No, it's true.
That's true now.
If we would just stop replacing them and we bring some living people in here under the age of 100, it would be great.
Because those people are going to meet their maker soon.
They're going to have to answer to their maker, Marvin Maker.
He's a driver up at Monticello.
Okay. It's 11.48.
12 minutes till noon.
Want to say hi to all our good friends at Pompo'no Park.
I might just go up there at night and win a couple of thousand, you know?
That's a thought.
Yeah, it's something to think about.
I cannot find the address.
Is Sharon in the building?
Is Don on the phone?
Where are those pictures?
The pictures are right over here.
Dr. Boombats has done us a new batch of pictures which are shocking.
Steve will have an nervous breakdown.
I know.
I've got the quick delivery thing here, but it's got their old address.
Oh, boy.
There he is.
Boy, you asked for Sharon and within at least two or three hours she's in there.
Thank you very much.
Okay. Here it is.
Oh, dear.
How are you doing?
Uh, the handle was ponderous.
Was it?
However, I have to tell you I was your inaugural caller and I have been waiting like seven and a
half weeks to call you again.
Well, that's good.
Once every seven and a half weeks is not chronic.
That's excellent.
Well, let me ask you this.
Let me ask you this.
Was it a good call?
Oh, excellent.
Okay.
See, I don't remember.
I remember.
Well, I was the first call you took on WIOD.
Like I said, I don't remember.
But I must have been crazy.
I have brain damage since then.
Earth shocking, huh?
You know, you worked for this station long enough to get brain damage.
No, it was the last station I worked for that gave me severe brain damage.
And I think that you were still like under the influence.
Yeah.
And that's going to take me a long time to shake off the effects of that force.
I call it because something's been like teaching at me.
And have you tried crew exer?
It works very well.
I tried like they have a new over the counter stream that's going to be a little bit more
to the, that I'm absolutely in love with and to take care of all those things.
But that's the way it goes.
Really?
Thank God.
I could, if I mentioned to you, spend the rest of the afternoon talking about it, talking about it.
But the canoe house is one of my favorite charities.
And I know that it's one of your favorite charities.
But I wonder why it's one of your favorite charities.
Because you're doing such a great job.
You wonder why?
I wonder why.
Because there are a lot of, there are a lot of cruel people out there.
And I have seen, you know, when I live in a city and I've been all over the country,
I don't just, you know, I do live in plantation in a very nice area.
And the homes there are all 3, 4, 500.
Oh, I'm sorry.
And I'm Harry.
Here to tell you about a special place.
Here's a short little side.
From New York, he's the volcano.
Let's go.
That's red.
I want to go.
I get away from it all.
There was that in the volcanoes.
He can feel the big.
I love that stuff.
Play shuffleboard if you wish.
I got a nine.
Go for Saturday lunch.
All for the food on top of your tin.
I hope it's kosher in the volcanoes.
Skytop and Buck Hill.
Camel back in Werschill.
Mount Ellie and Johnny.
They're even Mickey Rooney.
I know.
Let's rock and press go.
Oh, we let's go.
Pumpkin in the volcano.
We'll have some lives.
And then we'll see our show.
Ristony Orlando.
In the volcano.
Get a hot shake, Tom.
You're for the champagne.
Sit by the pool and act like a chub.
Let's get the chips.
You get me a nice girl.
Over by the exercise club.
Hey, cutie over here in the volcano.
Skytop and Buck Hill.
Camel back in Werschill.
Mount Ellie and Johnny.
Don't forget Mickey Rooney.
Play, rock and press go.
Oh, we let's go.
Pumpkin in the volcano.
We'll have some lunch.
And then we'll see our show.
Ristony Orlando.
And a volcano.
Let's go.
I got my teeth in the water in the air.
Pogo 7 and WIOD fat riches here would lunch.
My salad is here.
And look at that.
He's on his best beaver.
He's got a little antipostal.
Just a little salad.
Now how many olives you got there?
Let's not keep carrying away with those olives.
Anyway, you noticed that other nice 90-minute blank cassette.
Somebody had done sent a check.
And no note.
They just sent the tape.
So that's nice because there's our other master.
Oh, seriously, I'm not munking around with that.
I mean, there was a young lady who wrote me a note that said,
I'd sent a check under separate cover.
And that's fine.
I understand that.
And they'll get their thing.
But other than that, forget it.
Okay, it's 12.08.
And we're going to go back to your calls.
We have an open-line in Broward where some idiot hung up
during the news break.
I can't imagine.
I like the beginning of that news.
Did you hear what April said?
Mm-hmm.
She said, this new news is brought to you by.
And then she said, I don't know how small.
She's learning.
She's getting there.
Well, she's got a lot of pressure.
She's got that tremendous fan club.
Also, I want to thank very bright productions for sending me by accident.
Two whistles.
One was for me and one was for the guy over at Jo Chiwoda Channel 7.
But there's so much mail coming in here.
Now I get everybody else's mail too.
So I'm not giving it to Jo.
I'm just going to keep it.
No?
I want this call on one here.
Hello.
What do you say, I'm from here.
How you doing?
I don't know if you've got to hear Larry King show last night.
Somebody told us, yeah.
Yeah, that's why I was telling you about that, Tetta.
I mean, I was telling Nick that the guy got up there.
And he said, you remember when you were interviewing Bob Custis?
Or Bob Custis was interviewing you.
And he said, what makes a great broadcaster?
Well, the guy played your tape.
You said that he recorded it and it said, uh, what Larry King knows about a broadcaster.
You just put an official after he played that.
Larry King said, well, whatever that is, is obviously a jealous sick person.
And I just, you know, that's always Larry's comeback, you know.
And, you know, really, how is it that he knows everybody?
Oh, I had everyone's a good friend of his.
Yeah.
Well, when you kiss a lot of butman, everybody is your friend, so to speak.
Next year, by the way, a couple years, right before he was about, right,
towards the end of his career down here, my dad was a seasoned ticket holder with his office.
And when they were in the Super Bowl one year, he threw a big party.
And another person who's down there, well, I won't mention his name, it works in your station,
but who's kind of been demoted, sports wise, you know who I'm talking about.
And Mary cleaned my dad's liquor cabinet out when he threw the party.
And that afterwards, he said to my dad, isn't there anything else?
I mean, so not only is he...
I know Larry, well, okay.
The kindest thing that I can say is he is a great BS artist, okay?
No, he is.
That's why he's gotten where he is today, because he is a tremendous BS artist.
Yeah, I mean, really, it's amazing that these people say, oh, Mary,
what a service you provide to this country.
You're such a great humanitarian.
If you would provide a service, he gets some people on there and ask them some tough questions
instead of trying to be everybody's best friends.
Yeah, and he says, one answer question, just get to the question.
And every, you know, Angie Dickinson, I don't all respect her.
No, she's getting some new glasses, oh, she's getting some bifocal, so she can see up close.
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.
That'll be the end of that.
God, but just a way...
Mary, delighted to have WIOD's glurry King Show on at 11 o'clock here tonight.
Oh, boy.
By the way, have you really ever listened to that Rush Limbo?
And don't start ripping everybody else on the stage, and I don't think...
I'm not having.
No, because I like Rush Limbo.
I was going to say he's one of the few conservatives, you know, that has this indicator show.
Well, like I said, we're delighted to have him all, our all friends of WIOD.
And their all friends are Mary, and he's going to have dinner with Tommy.
That's right, and they're going to have tons of pasta together.
And they're going to try to keep Larry's nose on of it.
All right, yeah, I just don't know the past at all, aren't you?
I wish the people would find out what he's really like.
No, no, no, don't say they wish they'd find out who cares what they find out.
Okay, if they like his show fine, and if not, then they know what he is, and more power to him.
Oh, finally, one of the things.
What is Tisha Popeye, or whatever the hell you use.
Tisha Popeye, she's starring in an interview movie by Mirabiston Waddishbag.
Have a nice day.
Yeah, you're too.
That's a new, well-managed past noon at WIOD.
That's right, and then you're right.
What is that?
That is a beast talking again.
You know, and then you're right.
And then you're right.
And now you're right.
That's right, and then you're right.
So anyway, we want to thank Flores again for an incredible lunch.
The salad is great.
Looks like you're enjoying your pizza over there.
Wonderful.
There's no two there, no talking about this, no talking about that.
I said, there's no two there.
No two there, no talking about this, no talking about that.
There's no two bags, no two bags.
Moving right along, let's go right back to the exciting calls, Maggie.
These are the best calls in the history of this town.
What's the question?
Okay, let's go to a four-lawterdale.
Hello.
Hi.
How you doing?
Uncle Dale.
Yeah.
How are you?
Good.
Listen, as someone you worked with at 7 o'clock here in Lortardale, got me on to your
program.
And I'm glad of eating that you aren't from tenders to because before I used to sit by
alarm at 8 o'clock in the morning just to hear you show.
I'll be darned.
I did.
Now there are a couple things I want to tell you.
Yesterday I sent out under one cover two checks for Camilla's house with two tapes.
But I didn't bother writing you a note because I figured you had enough for a three.
That is correct.
I have absolutely.
Anyway, I feel you should get a commission from Campano Park.
We heard that you were going to be up there in Monday.
So I made arrangements to have some friends up there for dinner.
And we asked about you and they said, oh, you were here, place the best in the left.
What?
No, I wasn't there.
No, I hadn't.
I didn't get up there in Monday.
I couldn't go.
No, I couldn't go.
But I just, I didn't feel good Monday.
I was under the way.
I don't know.
Well, anyway, there's nothing else I wanted to ask you.
How far did your signal go?
I heard the call from Pittsburgh.
And we got a big signal in the bay, man.
We're right on the bay.
But we lose about two hours up there going up north.
In fact, I noticed Otis Redding was still sitting out there this morning when I got out of my car.
Uh-huh.
Somebody ought to clean that up.
Listen, I have a house guest from San Diego.
And who can't get over?
Who's ready to program this?
How you talking?
The things that you say?
Well, San Diego, there are a bunch of Neanderthals out there.
A lot of John Birchery's right wingers.
I wish you were 100% there to have a new house guest here.
Forget about it.
You tell them it's a great climate out there.
But get rid of those Neanderthals, all those hostile right wing extremists.
But I told them I said, you think this is better?
I just letting you hear the asshole's song.
You're kidding.
And since you said no request, they're not going to ask you.
Oh, I'm going to play it.
Oh, yeah?
If he's from San Diego, man, it fits.
Good.
I'm glad you're going to do it.
Is he there?
And he asked me here.
Well, Tom, to turn it up, man.
And if the shoe fits, have a great holiday.
Thank you very much.
You too, I'm going to be able to do it.
And a good sookist.
Right. Bye-bye.
San Diego.
They can hear that.
Beautiful climate.
They say that's the most perfect climate in the country.
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely.
It's right on the Pacific there.
They get those balmy breezes, not too humid.
They don't have the smog that they have in LA.
It's correct.
I used to know someone who lived there in the summer
and here in the winter.
Which is good because because they don't have the smog,
then you can see the swastikers and all those people walking around downtown.
It's great.
Well, I was driving down 9.95 the other night.
Somebody nearly cut me right off the road.
I decided wasn't going to do any good to get mad.
It's a road to song about them instead.
It goes like that.
Yeah.
We're even on an asshole.
Or did you work in your whole life?
Either way it worked out fine.
Because you're an asshole tonight.
Yes, you're an A.
That's that they so early.
And don't you try to blame it on me.
You deserve all the credit.
You're an asshole tonight.
You were an asshole yesterday.
You're an asshole tonight.
Stop got a feeling.
You'll be an asshole the rest of your life.
I'm a man.
I'm a man.
I'm a man.
I was talking to your mother just the other night.
I told her I thought you were an asshole.
She said yes.
I think you're right.
And all your friends are asshole.
Because you know that your whole life.
Because somebody told me you've got an asshole for life.
We're even on an asshole.
Or did you work in your whole life?
Either way it worked out fine.
Because you're an A.
And I'm a man.
I'm a man.
Hold the knife.
And speaking of that, I'm just going to go nuts.
I am so peeled by what has just been handed to me.
And there's no reason I can't discuss this.
Is there?
I don't know.
No because it's a copy of something that was sent by somebody who is fair game.
Denny Abbott, National Director of the Adam Walsh Trial Resource Center.
And I'm really getting ticked.
Because it's like deja vu.
It's like the same old crap all over again.
And you know like I said, everywhere you work, there's that nice honeymoon period in the beginning.
Everybody is wonderful and everybody is happy.
And now all of a sudden the last couple of days it's like...
This week.
Ghost of Christmas past, you know what I'm talking about.
So let's take the break now.
And I'm going to read this on a year.
I'm going to also let people know where this is coming from.
Oh yeah.
Well I mean directly it's right on the letter.
23 past 12, the WIOD will be right back.
Well to cash lottery, take a 27 at WIOD.
I have a copy that was put in my box of a letter that was sent to Diane Killary, the General Counsel,
at the Federal Communications Commission in Washington DC by one,
Denny Abbott, the National Director of the Adam Walsh Child Resource Center in West Palm Beach.
Now this is a man who according to this letter has never heard this show.
As you will discover when you hear this letter, he's heard tapes of the show.
Taken out of context, no doubt.
Dear Miss Killary, I'm writing to express my objection to the messages being aired by Neil Rogers on Radio Station WIOD.
I have listened to several of his shows on tape and was shocked to find that he in my opinion
solicits teenage boys for sex over the airways.
I cannot believe that he is permitted to continue his offensive remarks.
I urge the proper authorities to immediately investigate this matter,
sincerely Denny Abbott, National Director with copies to Mr. Jim Hatcher,
the General Counsel for Cox Enterprises in Atlanta, Mr. Mike Disney General Manager of this Radio Station.
Mr. Disney leaves for me in my mailbox a copy of this letter today.
Now there has been going on for the last year and a half a concerted effort in this community to get me off the air
to deprive me of a right to earn my livelihood and to control what I can do on the air.
Now I'm very familiar with what contemporary broadcast standards are in this industry.
I've heard them all from Howard Stern in New York to people in Chicago like Speedol,
Freest Man and Washington all over the country.
What we do on this program is tame.
I've also heard a lot of the same material on other stations in this community.
But nobody seems to be concerned about that.
But specifically this allegation about soliciting teenage boys for sex over the airwaves,
here again is a man who has never evidently heard this program,
has heard things taken out of context on tape that were intended in humor.
And anybody who's listened to the show for the last two years knows that it's in humor,
whether we're talking about Alan or STEM or Bob or this one or that one.
And here is a man in a position as the national director of the Animal Walsh Child Resource Center,
who based on materials taken out of context has the unmitigated gall,
the Hutzpah to write this kind of a letter of the FCC.
And it's about time that the people in this audience knew the kind of crap that is going on
and has been going on.
And this is a part of it.
And I have a note here with a copy of this letter from Mr. Disney for my information.
It says, and then it says, remember, you would have to one protect the license to do nothing illegal.
I'm already well aware of those things and I've been reminded of the most numerous occasions in the past few days.
Since coincidentally, I signed a contract.
I know FCC rules about what broadcasters' responsibilities are better than Mr. Abbott at the Animal Walsh Resource Center
and probably better than some of the people that bureaucrats in this building.
I've been in this business almost 30 years.
Now, Mr. Abbott ought to get the other side of the story.
From people who understand this program, understand my sense of humor and know where I'm really coming from,
there are no teenage boys who have ever been solicited for sex on this program or ever will be,
or teenage girls or teenage cretans or mutants or anything else.
And I think, you know, I really do.
I see a very dangerous pattern here again and that's exactly the intent of this kind of crap.
And that is to see to it that we can't do the program.
Now, they knew when I came here what I do.
They've heard this show a million times and there isn't enough money.
God don't have enough money to pay me to go through this every day again for the next year, the next three years, the next whatever.
Any other pain me a lot of money here, but I got news for you.
I came here to do a show and not to be intimidated and threatened and coerced and jostled every day by nervous nellies.
I already went through that the last two years.
We went through that. We could tell stories like we said to make people's hair stand on end.
True.
And I've had it up to my ears.
As I told Mr. Disney yesterday morning, I intend to do the show.
I intend to do the best possible job.
We're surrounded here by mail, by tapes and by checks.
We've raised well over $20,000 already for what is one of the most important charities in this community to me.
And if we're going to continue to be harassed and allowed to be harassed and intimidated, then I don't want to be a part of it.
I won't have anything to do with it.
Now if there are people in the audience want to call Mr. Abbott or any other people at the Edmwalsh Child Resource Center in West Palm Beach,
and let them know how misinformed they are, their number is area code 407-833-908-0.
And I make it very clear up front.
I'm not encouraging hostile calls, harassing calls, threatening calls, and I never have done that because I get accused of that too.
But it would be nice for these people to hear the other side of the story.
This is an entertainment show, comedy show.
And for someone again in a position of National Director of the Edmwalsh Child Resource Center to write this kind of letter to the commission,
without even ever having personally heard the show, is so offensive to me that I can't even begin to describe it.
I would like to say a lot more, but there are reasons why I can't, unfortunately, at least for the time being, at least not on the year.
But there you have it, okay, is things the more they change, the more they stay the same.
And I'm disappointed, bitterly disappointed, and shocked that this should even be in my mailbox,
with reminders, with constant daily reminders of what the business is like kindergarten, like elementary school,
the do's and the don'ts, the D's and the D's.
1233 and WIOD, one of the first.
I lose talk radio 610, WIOD.
Okay, Spencer, have a wonderful holiday, get out of here already.
1237 and WIOD, and our next call is a mobile in Palm Beach. Hello.
Hello, Daniel, it's the Duke.
Yeah.
Actually, I'm not in Palm Beach, I'm in Miami on Dixie Highway.
But you terrible guy, how could you possibly do those terrible things that that guy said in that letter?
Yeah, well, it's not a joke, it's not funny anymore.
It's key to the point of ridiculous, and especially the way they're beginning, they react to it.
That's what gets me hysterical, is these nervous nellies.
Okay, in other words, if you know what you're doing is right, and you know the intent of what you're doing,
that should be sufficient, and you have to be confident in knowing that you've got people, you know, who know what they are doing.
Yeah, I can't start.
This is just like what happened in the other place, man.
It just exists. It's like deja vu.
I see the handwriting on the wall, and I got news for it.
I am not prepared to go through another prolonged period of time with daily reminders.
Okay, it just isn't going to work.
I agree with you.
There are people who have worked in this time period in the last year, and this time slot on this station,
who are no more broadcasters than I'm a brain surgeon, okay?
I've been in Washington, D.C., and I've heard the grease, man.
And calling your stuff tame is an understatement.
No matter what they're doing right over next door here to us at the FM,
makes this show so tame by comparison that it's not even a contest, all right?
Well, anyway, let's get the blood pressure down.
How you doing there, duck?
We were all doing fine until about ten minutes ago.
Yeah, I know what you're feeling.
Why don't you call me by my real name today?
I'm sorry, Bert.
It's okay.
How you doing there, guys?
Okay.
I just can't believe what's going on.
Well, anyway, it's a beautiful day.
It's going to be 80 degrees for Christmas.
Yeah.
I mean, it's wonderful.
Great.
You know, you really did the job, boy.
He's really up.
Well, I'm telling you.
He's really up.
It's really, very difficult not being a chronic, you know, especially in my mobile phone,
where number 2345, you direct lines.
It's, you know, like my clients are neglected now.
Is it really tough?
It's tough.
Yeah, whatever you say.
Yeah.
It's just a matter of your lines are always busy.
Yeah.
Whatever you say.
Yeah.
So what do you think that he's going to win tonight?
Oh, wow.
No.
No.
What can I say?
Did you guys make it to Neil Diamond?
Oh, come on.
What do you get out of here?
Neil Diamond.
Will you get serious?
Oh, I've got to tell you, Joe, I thought it was real funny.
I'm coming off Metro Rail, and I scream out and very loud for thousands of people around me to hear.
I can't believe how many people came out to see the Neil Rogers show tonight.
And they turned around and said, Neil Rogers.
I said, oh, this is not Neil Rogers.
This is Neil Diamond.
I said, I got the wrong Neil.
Oh, good.
It was funny, Neil.
I bet you had to be there.
I had to be at short eastern.
Well, have a good day there and calm down, will you?
Good luck.
Hey, listen.
Yeah.
Calm isn't the word.
Have a great day.
You too.
And a good holiday.
You too.
Bye.
By 1240.
I feel like I'm going to have a bad line.
That's not for us.
OK.
What?
I had the win.
I kind of had the win.
I had the win.
I didn't take it out of her sale.
The whole show had the win.
I had the win.
I had the win.
It was opening up all this mail and we got thousands of dollars again.
And everything is going just great.
And bingo.
There it is.
Plop right in front of your face, again.
The same ponderous crap, OK?
Yeah.
See, I get the notion that maybe I just want to go home for a few days.
OK, and let them decide whether they want me to come back.
Do you know what I'm saying?
Well, because I'm beginning to get the feeling they're having second doubts.
Oh, yeah. I'm beginning to have that feeling.
Because it's one thing to say to have all kinds of...
Because remember the things I used to say before we came here?
And then all of a sudden there was this tremendous metamorphosis.
And it was like, man, all of a sudden these people developed these gigantic...
I better not say that now, because they'll get nervous about that.
But these tremendous... You know what I mean? Like an elephant.
Guzzi. And boy, we're just going to go ahead and we're going to do...
And like I said, you can listen to any of the other shows in town,
the morning shows in particular.
Yes. And there is stuff on there like on power.
Yeah. There is some really racy stuff.
And nobody says a word.
Not a word. No.
Now if the Animal Wash Resource Center is truly homophobic,
then I think maybe we ought to know about that.
Okay, if that's really where they're coming from.
Is that what it's really all about?
I mean, what is really their problem?
You think we ought to call them on the air?
Why not? Call the guy himself?
I'd like that. I'd enjoy that.
So you know the problem is that you'd probably get into parts of the conversation
and we couldn't let go on the air.
Oh, that's true.
You know what I'm saying? Maybe off the air.
But I mean, this is just an abomination.
The Animal Wash Child Resource Center.
407-833-9080.
That's their number in West Palm Beach.
And as I said, the letter itself, you know,
that's bad enough, although it doesn't really bother me that much
considering knowing all the background of it.
Yeah.
But then to be given this again,
Mark Confidential, by the way, on the Animal Wash.
Make sure nobody else would open it.
Mm-hmm.
As if there's something really pressing and urgent here.
Oh, here's a caller on 8. Hello.
Hey, how you doing?
Okay.
I called down there, up there, rather.
Yeah, what did they tell you?
Well, the gentleman's not in the office at this time.
Of course not.
And the phone's been busy and I left my name and number
and told her I approve your show.
And I don't know what all the fuss is about.
I'm just a question of approving a my show,
but the idea that this man alleges to the FCC
that I solicit teenage boys for sex over the airways,
there is no one in his right mind who really understands
what the content in intent of the show is all about
who could possibly believe that.
And I got another thing.
You know, you're going to be raising over $25,000, okay?
Hey, evidently, that doesn't counter-run, you know.
I don't, let me tell you something.
I don't have any confidential note on my desk here on the table
from management telling me,
geez, what a tremendous job you've done for Camila Sounds.
That's what I do have as another little hassle,
which has been going on every day now for the last several days.
I know, and I want everybody to call Channel 4, Channel 7, Channel 10,
to say, hey, are you aware of what Neil Rogers is doing
with the Camila Sounds?
Let's get...
I'm not looking for credit.
No, no, no, no, no.
Okay, we get up more than enough credit.
I talked to Brother Paul this morning.
He's a super guy.
They're very grateful down there.
And I'm not doing this to be a grandstander.
Okay, I've had more than enough publicity in this town.
I like the other media in this town, and I really,
I think I am going to have a press conference to announce what's really been going on,
because there are a lot of things I can't discuss here on the air.
I know.
But today, I reached my limit.
Okay, I have reached the end of the line.
Well, maybe.
Because the harassment that's been going on and the distortion of what I do on the air
is unconscionable.
Absolutely unconscionable.
I think Disney has covered his ass just in case something comes down.
He wants to say, well, I did leave a memo and Neil's buy.
Well, let me just tell you this about my coming to this radio station.
Okay, they approached me.
I didn't approach them.
That's it.
You don't have to have help.
Okay.
Thanks for your call.
You're welcome.
Bye-bye.
1244 at WIOD.
We have an open line in Palm Beach.
655-9463-655-WIOD.
And it's interesting, and I don't really want to go into it at length,
but it's also interesting that there are others who have helped to plant the seeds for this stuff.
You know what I'm talking about?
Inside this building.
Yeah.
And you know it's like Dr. Frankenstein.
He created the monster, and then it got out of control.
I didn't know what to do with it.
He couldn't control it.
So I think it's incumbent upon some of those individuals who have helped to create this
and distort what it is I do on the air to correct the record, like maybe this afternoon.
Okay.
You know what I'm talking about?
Like between two and six?
Yes.
1245, let's go to Miami.
Hello.
Neil.
Yeah.
Just relax.
Take a deep breath.
Well, it's easy, easy to say, but I'm going to tell you, when you've been harassed for a year and a half,
and you've done your best to ignore it, and then you finally think that you're working for people intelligent enough,
not to buy into it, and then all of a sudden starts the same crampola again, boy, just I'm not going to go through it again.
I'll tell you that.
Three hats.
Three hats.
I have to go to work and put Kipsey.
I'm not going through this again.
Well, they'll never stop, huh?
It's just three hats, the same old thing.
They have nothing else that does do.
Evidently.
And I think you should just, I don't know, go with the flow.
Would you do a how-to react before with any other allegations that they've had in the past?
What do you mean, how did I react?
What are you talking about, sir?
Did you get all excited like this?
Let me say it to you again, because I'm really beginning to wonder about the purpose of this call,
but let me say it to you one more time.
You know, we all have our breaking point at which we get fed up, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
You can all tolerate so much, and then you finally reach the point where you get sick of it.
Kind of stand.
Yeah, okay, have a wonderful life, pal, and get your brain unscramble.
Will you place 1246 at WIOD and OpenLine Indeed at 751-9463.
Plantation, hello.
Hello.
Yeah.
I just moved here from California back in September.
Well, sir, you made a bad...
But it's true down here.
I can't believe it.
They get chronic when they're talking about an entertainment show.
I mean, give me a break.
The amount of stuff that you got...
Well, let me explain somebody.
This is a bush-league town, and I always used to say, I don't know if you're familiar with Howard Stern in New York.
Howard's got a very popular show up there, and he uses a lot of words that we have never dreamed of.
And I always said Howard would never last five minutes in this market because they would drag him out of the studio kicking and screaming.
This is a very puritanical, very knee-and-earth-all town.
Although it is interesting, it is only a very, very, very small number of misfits out there who find these bizarre interpretations of what they show us all about.
My wife and I moved here from California, and she got transferred down here with another job.
It's just an interesting point about sunrise that she keeps telling me,
no, that's not true what he's saying about sunrise.
I said, well, baby, let's take her right down there and we'll just go shopping.
Yeah, take her right up university drive when you got a lot of extra time.
Absolutely ridiculous.
I mean, these people forgot what the gas pedal is like, and you go into a store and they're constantly pushing and pushing.
They want to step in front of you, they want to do the whole thing.
There's no politeness involved, it's off.
You try to be polite to the elderly and there's nothing you can do about it.
Well, a lot of Mark Kamikaze, they want you, they wait till the science says don't walk,
and then they step out of the middle of the street and kind of invite you to run them over.
It's a good point, and I'll tell you guys, you guys provide so many chuckles that I just can't believe,
and I'll tell you, just keep up the good work, and with Camilla's house, check Camilla's house,
and I just hope that everything goes well for you.
Thanks a lot.
Take it easy.
Bye.
1248, it's 11.5 till 1.
There it is, 1252, on a wonderful Wednesday it was until about a half an hour ago,
and let's move right along, here's somebody who called the Animal Center.
Hello.
Yeah, hi, Neil.
Yeah.
I called over there and I was talking to his secretary, left my name and number because apparently the gentleman's not there.
Yeah, that's convenient.
Yeah, and I guess the gentleman doesn't understand comedy whatsoever.
Well, not only that, but he's never heard the show.
He's heard tapes of the show, which have evidently been sent to him.
I can't imagine from where, but there have been tapes in which we're obviously taken out a context,
and when somebody plants the seeds and says, hey, this is what this means,
then obviously the guy's buying into it and right away he's sending letters to the FCC.
This is our license in my livelihood that are hanging in the balance here,
and we got some clown up there in the West Palm Beach who doesn't even listen to the show
who is claiming to be an expert on what the intent of the program is.
Exactly.
I challenge this gentleman to call me back because I really wouldn't like to give him these in my mind.
Yeah, but I hope thousands of people do.
Well, the lines were busy.
I mean, I hope that those people who support financially because I believe this is a nonprofit organization.
I hope that anybody who supports the Animal Walsh Child Resource Center,
and I'm sure they do a lot of wonderful work,
will tell them that they're not too crazy about continuing their financial support
so long as they continue this kind of activity.
But Neil, I'll be honest with you.
I don't think this is where it really comes from.
I think he's homophobic to be honest with you.
You see, really?
Yeah.
Well, listen to that wonderful.
Again, I have no way of knowing that.
I'm not going to make any allegations because I don't know the manner or anything about him.
Yeah.
Well, I'd like to ask you a question.
I got a couple of friends who got turkeys for Christmas,
and we'd like to see if we can donate it to the Camila House.
That would be great.
Yeah, we'll just take it down to Camila House to do what you can take them right down there directly.
That would be great.
Okay.
So you have a great day, man, and I really enjoy your show.
You're the best thing on the year right now.
Thanks a lot.
All right.
Bye-bye.
Okay.
1254 at WIOD and Open Line in date at 7519463.
751 WIOD, a pinhead on two, it says.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yeah.
Why am I a pinhead?
Well, that's just what Nick said.
You're a pinhead.
Don't pay any attention to him.
He's just going through change your life.
Of course, my father.
You're too young.
You're too young to be a good car.
Sir, if you're over the age of 100, he'd put you right at the end of the list.
Oh, I guess.
Well, just like a preview can make a movie good or bad,
that little tape that he heard can make your show seem horrible.
So he should have listened to the whole thing.
It doesn't pay to listen to some of it,
and then judge the whole show by what he heard.
And I spoke to a lot of people, including Alan,
because I'm friends with him, and he takes it all in fun.
Well, everybody takes it in fun because they know what it's all about.
They know this is an entertainment and a comedy show.
And I just can't imagine anybody that's stupid in my business,
who's been in a business more than five minutes,
who would really go on a year and solicit sex from anybody.
Of course.
Although I have heard that on other programs,
but it's interesting that those people evidently can do it with impunity.
No problem.
Yeah.
It's just a shame that people in general, including your management,
look at the bad instead of the good, the good being,
your Camilla's house thing.
Yeah.
And if they know it's good for them, they'll stay out of your way.
Oh, I punched up the wrong line. You're on five.
Well, sometimes that happens. These buttons are very standard.
You're not a pinhead.
You're not a pinhead.
Oh, I know. I know. I know. I know. I know.
Okay. Thank you.
So now you can rest.
You can rest. Have a great holiday.
And that'll have to be neurotic about it.
I feel better.
Okay.
Okay. Hey, Neil, take it easy. Okay.
Yeah. I'm really doing it.
All right. Bye.
Now, here's the pinhead.
Hello.
Yeah.
Hi.
Nick was right.
So what's up?
Nothing's right.
What's going on?
Good call. Thank you.
Open light indeed. 751, W-I-O-D.
My M-E. Hello.
Neil? Yeah.
I'm a teenage boy, Neil, and I must say I've never been around as well talking to you.
I'm sure that.
And I don't know where this guy gets off.
Probably.
So to speak. Don't watch your language now. They might misinterpret that too.
Yeah, that's true. You'll never know. I mean, haven't we had enough of these fall-wellian types?
Exactly. You know, and not... It's not only that.
There are a whole series of things here that really bother me.
One that this guy would go and write a letter to the commission without even hearing the show first hand, or...
knowing what we're doing here.
And secondly, the fact that management even waste my time and irritates me by giving us to me again,
I don't need to see this crap. Okay, I've been seeing it for a year and a half.
I know. I mean, where are they trying to prove?
Well, I'm... They're trying to prove that they're changing their underwear every five minutes.
In fact, there was just a gigantic rider truck that pulled up into parking lot with depend undergarments.
Okay, that were over at Zeta.
And now they brought them over here.
Maybe they're campers.
Yeah. You've heard of that, you know, changing their underwear every five minutes?
Yeah.
Well, trust me.
Oh, boy. Something stinks in your village.
And Mary Christmas to me, right?
Yeah. Well, I sure hope you get through this mail.
Have a wonderful day.
Okay, too.
Bye.
Be pressing.
Okay, we have, let's see, $20,669 for Camilla Sounds.
Today we got $60.02 in a mail, and we are almost to the $21,000 mark.
So certainly by Friday, if we don't get to $25, we ought to come pretty damn close, right?
Okay.
Yeah.
So I'm sure that you'll have a good time opening the mail when you're here.
$12.57, well, that possibility arises.
Okay. I mean, that exists because I am really ticked.
This has been an ongoing the last two or three days, and you sit down and you have an honest conversation with somebody and you think,
you understand the words that they're saying, but evidently, they don't understand what you're saying.
Okay.
And I have every intention to show them up every day and doing the show.
I know.
Period.
Show them up every day, five days a week, including all those great holidays we get to work.
Dear field, hello.
Hi, Neil.
Hi.
I haven't called in a couple of weeks because the guy said I was chronic and boring, but this turn.
Don't pay any attention to him, man.
As long as you're under a hundred, you're okay with me.
Well, this turn of events is imponderous.
This is ridiculous.
He's bureaucratic.
I have nothing better to do.
Yeah.
I mean, you know, can't they pick on somebody that deserves it?
It's so stupid.
If he is...
Well, you know, this program has been investigated.
Seriously, this program in yours troub investigated by the FBI, the Secret Service, the State Attorney,
a governor's special prosecutor's office.
None of them found any of this to have any validity or for there to be anything obscene or pornographic or illegal or any serious soliciting for anything on his program other than money for charity.
And yet the beat goes on as they say, man, it just never stops.
Well, I mean, it's just a joke.
Yeah.
That is correct.
You know it, and I know it, and anybody else out there who wants to know it knows it.
Those people who want to manipulate it and twist it and make it appear that it is something that they know that it's not, they continue to do it.
Well, they have to have somebody to track it.
And I'm not going to sit still for it for one more minute. You can go to the bank on that.
No, because you're too good for it.
Okay.
We really are.
Thanks for calling.
Take care and have... try to have a healthy health.
I'm going to have this is... this is made it for me.
This is made mine.
This is guaranteed a happy, happy holiday.
Well, I also plan happy holidays.
Thank you.
Take care.
He's ecstatic.
Okay.
Well, listen, that's going to do it for this hour.
The Animal's Child Resource Center in West Palm Beach again.
Mr. Denny Abbott, the National Director, 407 is the area code 8339080.
April's got the 1 o'clock WIOD news, and then 105.
Someone will come back.
Oh, right here.
Like a very much.
As there is the team.
I don't have them around much for a while.
But I want y'all to know what up here in Rock and Roll Heaven.
Although I'm thinking of you, best Christmas.
And I have to give y'all a special Christmas message.
A message of peace.
Like a gift.
Yeah.
How about a little Christmas about how I go and buy?
Thank you.
I got a lot.
A lot of old friends.
Christmas is a time of hoot.
Time of joy.
A time of eleven.
And I share with a lot of text lives that feature you got there.
Okay.
But we're more.
More or more.
Oh yeah, Christmas.
The Christmas to me means family.
If family means friends, the friends means getting together and getting together means eating.
I'll pass you that drumstick.
Which please.
Well, it's like you.
Like a little boy.
Now just a little slater here right now.
You know, I may be a big star.
Maybe too big.
But ain't nobody so big.
You can't reach out a helping hand.
A helping hand.
Well, would you hand me a helping of those my stators over there?
Which please?
Like it.
Like a little boy.
Now like I was playing.
Ain't nobody so big.
You can't stoop to help a friend of me over the holidays season.
I'm speaking of season.
You won't pass me that soul sugar when you get the chance.
Like it.
Yeah, just, just those screws of color.
That's right.
Like it.
I don't know.
So this Christmas, why don't y'all take a tip from old A.O.S.?
Now I don't leave those steak tips right where they are.
You know what I mean?
No, I appreciate it.
Like it.
I want you to remember, for all part of God's great big family.
You know God made man into his own image.
And look at the mirror.
I'd have to say God must be a big, big son of a gun.
You know what I mean?
I like you do.
But I especially want y'all to remember this one last thing.
When y'all was homeless Christmas, springing that popcorn up on the tree, save a big, big bowl
for the can.
Extra butter, you know what I mean?
I like you do.
I like you.
I like you.
I like you.
107 at WIOD, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays.
Boy, it is festive.
It sure is.
Okay, we got a color who called the the Animal Center on one.
Hello.
Yeah, how you doing, Neil?
Okay.
I'm on a mobile.
I got where I wanted to go and got me driving around here looking for a place to talk to you.
I got a chance to call up there.
Yeah.
And I explained to this lady that answered the phone.
I got on the phone with them immediately after you gave out the number.
And when they answered the phone, I asked for this gentleman.
And she said just one moment.
As if he was there.
Yeah.
So I would put on hold for some time.
And then she came back and said, is this regarding the Neil Rogers show?
And then I had expressed to her what you said regarding the morning shows.
I listened to that Power 96 in the morning.
And I want to tell you boys, they just don't leave anything to the imagine.
That is cool.
And I want you to understand.
Wait a minute.
I want everybody to understand.
I don't find anything wrong with it.
I'm not condemning them.
But I'm just saying that everything is relative.
And what community broadcast standards, I'll give you an example.
Glenn was talking the other day about the fact that Channel 7 aired a movie two nights ago
in which the F word and the S word, and there were always four letter words in there.
And they didn't even have a single complaint about the language.
They had one complaint from some viewer and it was about something innocuous thing.
And I'd never do it with a language.
Contemporary community standards are determined by these kinds of things.
By what is accepted in the community and what is broadcast day in and day out.
And as far as these allegations about soliciting voice for sex over the airways,
the only thing I can assume that anybody who writes this kind of thing after listening to the show
would take that seriously has got to suffer from a very serious case of homophobia.
Well, Neil, what I got to say is that...
And I got news for you.
If homophobia is going to enter into the relationship that I have with this radio station,
there are going to be more lawyers involved.
There are going to be more lawyers running up and down the halls here than they have ever seen before.
They think they have seen lawyers before just wait.
Well, I'll tell you, I was going to say, you know, you've got the contract
and, you know, I'm not going to tell you how to run your life.
But it's just a question of principle.
And I think that I've been with you long enough on the airways to realize that you have had enough crap put down your throat.
You bet you.
I'm telling you what, buddy.
I think that you just ought to dig in.
I'm telling you, dig in because they are...
And I think that you just start striking back, okay, because I've sat around like some kind of a whimper the last year and a half.
And I've allowed these mismanagement morons to intimidate and threaten and harass and hassle.
And I got news for you, okay?
The numbers I've had on every station that I've been on this town have been bigger than anything else that they've had on the air,
or ever will have on the air, including the station that I just left.
And if they don't want that and they don't want to succeed, hey, let them bring back a Paul Liar.
Let them put on the Bill McQuiggy.
And then they'll get a board off that can do a hell of a talk show and get a two-five or a three.
That's just our society.
That's the American way.
You see, everybody wants success without working for it.
You see, that's going to make their lives a little bit uncomfortable.
And she, we should don't want that.
We should don't want that.
But one of the principles of War Neal, and I can't quote who it's from, but the saying goes that when you aggravate your enemy attack, you strike.
And you go after him.
And I say, buddy, dig in.
Go get a towel.
And congratulations on your weight loss.
I think you're doing a well job.
Thanks a lot.
Good for you, bud.
Bye.
I've lost my appetite for the rest of the week.
I think I'm probably through Christmas.
It's 11 past one at WIOD, the Isle of...
And we'll move right along here.
We have an open line in a day.
You see, I just...
Didn't I say in the beginning it just too good to be true?
Didn't I say that?
Honeymoon.
Just a little...
Just too good to be true.
Oh, yeah.
No matter what you want.
See, these are the people who make the decisions.
And if they came to me and they said, hey, you know, that one thing you're playing...
It's just too far, you know?
Great.
We'll take it.
I will even rip up the cart.
We'll pull the tape out of the cart.
Sure.
That hasn't been said.
Or if they were to come in here, I wonder...
You know, I just saw one of the morning twins walk down the hall there.
I wonder if they give them this kind of stuff.
Skippy.
I wonder...
No, I don't think he's coming back.
Skippy.
But...
I wonder if they do that because they play some stuff on there that...
They may have borrowed it once or twice.
And say something.
But they do some pretty wild stuff over there.
And again, that's fine.
Oh, yeah.
That's funny, okay?
I mean, this is 1988 for Cry Not Loud.
Correct.
Almost 80, huh?
And we're supposed to be adults.
And if we're going to turn this into a little piratannical douchebag backwater town...
And we're going to start, you know, chasing people off the air...
Because we want to twist and misinterpret.
Although, really, again, the bottom line of this...
It comes back to one word and that's homophobia.
Okay.
Because there were those people who could be accused of soliciting...
Girls on here, too, and their humor could be twisted.
But I guess that's okay.
That is okay.
Yeah, that's okay.
That's fine.
Mm-hmm.
It is.
But when we're dealing with terminal homophobics out there...
Who have nothing better to do in their lives than continue harassing and twisting and distorting...
Then we got a horse of a different color.
Of a different gender.
We have a gilding of a different...
It's one-thirteen at WOL-IOD.
And let's go to Deerfield.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah.
What happened?
I went out to lunch.
I come back and what's going on here?
Well, I don't want to go through the whole thing again.
We got a copy of a letter.
My general manager in his infinite wisdom left me a copy of a letter that was sent by the National Director of the Adam Walsh Child Resource Center to the FCC...
A protesting shock over what is on this program.
You got to be kidding.
And in his opinion, he suggests I selected teenage boys for sex over the airwaves.
I believe.
What's the phone number up there?
The phone number is area code 407-833-9080.
All right.
I'm calling him.
I keep doing a good job, Neil.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
And I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
I'm not going to encourage harassment, nasty behavior on the phone, hostility.
All I suggest that you do is call and let Mr. Abbott or his office know that he's been led down to Garden Pat.
Or he's leading Diane Killary in the commission down to Garden Pat.
And again, they've got plenty of letters like this already.
So the letter in and of itself doesn't surprise me.
It's disturbing.
It is a point.
But it doesn't surprise me.
But it's just the idea that I have a copy with yet another reminder from the powers that be.
Of what the business is all about.
I'm going to tell you something.
And I probably shouldn't say this, but I'll say it anywhere because I don't really care anymore.
I've taken enough of this crap for almost two years.
What some of these people, some of these bureaucrats know about this business.
I could put in a thimble and have room for the Chinese Army leftover.
Okay.
I know the standards in this industry real well.
And I know all the history in fact it was an April two years ago, year and a half ago.
We were doing a show out on the front lawn at WINZ.
April 16th.
When the FCC ruling, the expanded ruling came down.
We had the attorney, one of the FCC lawyers on the phone on the show.
I tried desperately in as nice a way as I could to get him to explain to what exactly what the law is.
What it really means.
And he gave us such a even delayed al-Kelly, even Irwin Corey couldn't give such a disjointed, convoluted description of what the FCC ruling is.
They don't even understand it themselves.
No idea.
But it is shocking to me to use that word again that there are those people who would be so stupid or so phobic in one way or another.
As to take things that are obviously intended in humor and try to suggest that they're serious.
That's the pathetic part.
And again a man who is in a position such as this, the national director of the Animal's Child Resource Center.
And I'd like to see, I'd like to have all those teenagers, all those boys who have been solicited for sex through this program.
I'd like to have them come forward and be counted.
I'd like to hear the names.
I'd like to hear the dates and the vivid explicit descriptions of all these exciting adventures that I've had with them.
Because I've been missing out on some, I haven't seen any either.
I thought I was paying attention.
Yeah, I've missed out on something.
Must have happened in my sleep.
And it couldn't have been too exciting because they never woke up once.
So I'd love to see some tangible evidence of the hallucinating that Mr. Abbott and some others have been going through.
So far we don't find any.
West Palm Beach, hello.
Yeah, hello.
Yeah.
First of all, Merry Christmas, Neil.
Merry Christmas to you, sir.
Ho ho ho.
Merry Christmas.
Thank you.
Get off this, kick that guy just trying to raise the waves anyway.
Got a question for you about Chicago, WLF.
Mm hmm.
Dick Beyondy.
Yeah.
Oh, no, Dick Beyondy.
I mean, he may still be still around somewhere, but I don't even know if he's still alive.
Yeah, I didn't know either.
I've been gone for quite a while.
I just, just curious, maybe you might have known some.
Well, maybe somebody from the big city will know.
I doubt it.
Not these things bags on here.
Yeah.
I've only got one or two.
Maybe one or two.
But let that, let that Mr. Abbott just go up there and write his letters.
He's getting that better to do.
Okay.
Do a good job.
Okay, thanks a lot.
One more thing.
Yeah.
I deliver mail at Delray Beach and I get upset at you because sometimes I can't listen.
You keep me going when I'm walking.
Both of you in England do a fantastic job.
Thank you.
Have a good day, Nathan.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Okay, enjoy the show.
Obviously, it must be a pervert or some kind of 2017.
At WIOD, we have an open-line in Palm Beach.
655-9463.
655-WIOD.
And, you know, I think today is D-Day.
It's a good thing this happened right before Christmas.
Okay.
I think today, as far as I'm concerned, is going to be D-Day at 2 o'clock and they can make up their mind.
And if they don't want to take the heat, I'll be delighted to go home and they can just send me a check every week.
Are you following me?
Yes.
Because I'm not violating anything.
Zero.
And if they want to be real safe, I guess they should have left Bill McQueen on here, okay?
If they want to be real, real safe.
You can't get much safer than that.
That's true.
Palm Beach, hello.
Hello?
Yeah.
As a parent of two children, Neil, I want to voice my support for you because my wife and I listen to your show every day.
And we know where you're coming from.
And I think these people are complaining, or what I call bumper sticker Christians, who are looking for an excuse.
They turn their back on the homeless and hungry.
Yeah.
I didn't see any checking closed with this from the Adam Walsh, a child resource center for Camilla Sous.
I didn't see a check with a letter.
Right.
It's easy to scream about all this stuff, pornography or whatever.
You know, things that you...
It's just a lot easier, you know, like I said, to turn your back on the real problems and go for the things that...
I don't know how to explain it, but I think you know what I mean.
I know.
But anyway, I remember when I was on Wins one time we had the Children's Holiday Fund at Christmas time.
And we had little contest among the talk show hosts.
And the so-called conservative ultra-right-wing host who was no longer living.
But nonetheless, couldn't raise a dime from his listeners.
Okay.
We raised thousands and thousands of dollars.
I think it was about $30,000 in all of the rest of the talk host on the station.
And those right-wingers, man, like you say, they got a big mouth, but they don't put their money where their mouths are.
Yeah, they like their condition dog houses and stuff, but...
Yeah, that's correct.
A heck with the kids or stuff.
And they're very concerned about those unborn fetuses, man, but the living they can drop the hell.
Anyway, my wife's a visiting nurse, and I just want to call her a douchebag, so I should probably listen to her right now.
Okay.
Alright, thanks a lot.
Thank you.
Okay, it's 120.
I'll see you later.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
But anyway, it's 130, a WIOD.
Already?
Yeah.
Not as blind in it.
Huh.
This last hour and five minutes or so is just a Zoom vibe for me.
Yeah.
Has it been good for you, folks?
Okay, Steve, this afternoon.
Now, what's...
We have a little conflict here.
Does he have the veterinarian?
I thought that's...
No, it's open today.
See, you're spreading rumors in the garbage.
And a fat rich, there it is.
No, that was originally on the calendar, but the puppy got sick or something.
So it's open phones and a Steve Cane show this afternoon.
It would really be interesting to hear some real frank open discussion of some of the seeds that have been planted in the past that lead to today's activities on this program.
But I'm not going to hold my breath.
It's 131, and I want to tell you about something really exciting coming up this weekend at the Melting Pot.
And of course, for the last...
Gee, it's got to be a year and a half at least now.
I've been telling you about the fantastic fondue at the Melting Pot.
This is one of the great restaurants in town.
There's a lot of fun waiting for you there.
You get to dip your own right in the pot.
Can I say that?
Barely.
Yeah, just probably get a memo on it tomorrow.
And, you know, dip and dunk.
Now, I guess we better not say that.
We care about the bottom line, is you cook your own stuff.
Okay, they bring out the fondue and you dip your stuff in area that's fantastic.
Now, they're going to be open early on Christmas Eve at 4 p.m.
That's Saturday, right?
4 p.m.
And for the first time ever at the Melting Pot, they're going to feature a special holiday menu, which is going to include...
Listen to this, lobster and filet menu on fondue.
You're moaning in the background.
I'm meeting...
Moaning in the morning as well as a super deluxe combination of lobster, filet, chicken, and shrimp.
And so you and a whole gang, including your out of town guests, who've never had the great joy of dipping and dunking at the Melting Pot,
can just have a sensational time and add really a lot of fun and the great meal to the holiday season.
Okay? We strongly suggest you make reservations because I have a feeling they're going to be really loaded.
So, be sure and call them make your reservations.
Now, 3 Melting Pot locations.
They're at 3044 South Military Trail in West Palm Beach.
They're at 9835 Sunset Drive in South Miami and they're on West Sample Road just east of Pine Island in Coral Springs.

Well good, I hope they listen close, because I'm sure they can relate to it
God, they for the boot, go home for the boot, and I think of a very funny show, a funny show, a funny show, a funny show, and people who don't like people who don't like people who don't like your humor, take your humor, take your humor, take your humor, just shouldn't listen, just shouldn't listen, just shouldn't listen
Well, the bottom line is when they hire you to do a job, they know exactly what it is you do, I mean if they haven't listened to you before then they shouldn't hire you, obviously I didn't come from Pukipsi and I didn't come from Chicago or Cleveland, I came from right here, I've been under your 13 years in this market, and so they know what I do on the air, and they've heard it a lot, I can assure you that, I'm sure a lot of people in this building were closet listeners anyway, so when they hire you and they put you on the air, and I said to them when I came here, let's set the ground up,
and I said to them, let's find out exactly what you want, if there's anything that's even questionable, let's just forget it, I don't know, this is great, that's fine, you know fine, but don't keep waffling and equivocating every other day because you're changing your underwear, that's their problem, okay, and the one thing that really ticks me off about this business is the way that talent gets abused like sunny, okay, now sunny fox is a good guy, we joke with him a lot about his phone calls and talk shows, but sunny is a good guy, I mean, a guy's got a heart of gold, he came in here and gave me a heart of gold, but I think I'm going to have to say that, I'm going to have to say that, I think I'm going to have to say that, I think I'm going to have to say that, I think I'm going to have to say that, I think I'm going to have to say that, I think I'm
going to have to say that, I think I'm going to have to say, like I bought it, but I'm going to have to say that at that time, I think I'm going to be able to answer that, and for now, I'm going to say that, I gave that check last week for one thousand bucks, and I matched it for Comellos house, and I told him on the phone yesterday I said you know I really give you credit more than anybody because it was after we did that, that the response just went crazy, you know I mean, it just took off like crazy, and I think that the fact that we both showed that we were going to put our money where our mouths were min-something to a lot of people out there and added a lot of credibility, and he has gotten screwed over over there so badly, his ratings are great, he's a good guy, and, and you know that's this business man, What, these people in management, they ought to be putting
some kind of a camp somewhere
and i'd be more than happy to be the one with the electric prod you know what i
say with that number again out there
it's area code 407
eight three three
nine oh eight oh
okay and i want to say this also we got to call it our front switch board i
don't know if it was legit or not but from somebody claiming to be the
attorney for mr. abbot or the resource center up there
and if uh... you know again the same kind of stuff that steve got today he was
talking about the a condo's up there and if you don't just stop having people
call you'll hear from us well i don't care if we hear from them or not because
they are a
agency that is funded by public funds uh... their telephones are there to be
used by the public and if they're going to go off and try to interfere with
another business which is us a private business
uh... and try to interfere with my livelihood that i've got every right to get
my callers to call them in a respectful way i'm not encouraging any
disrespect and and and try to make them understand that they're totally
misinformed about this program
yeah i agree
point if they're not misinformed and they're twisting the truth if they're
intentionally doing it that makes it even worse
okay now well keep it up i enjoy your show thank you
oh god one forty one happy holidays and soft florida from your friends at w i o d
all of the brain there
like a festival in here today
uh...
uh...
that i see somebody come with you go and go and look at my mailbox to see if
she stuck something else in there because if she did
i'm going to lock the studio man will keep keen out of your will go to six
anyway it's one forty two at w i o d you know everything has been so great what
is this the end of the seventh week well we were curious how long the honey
would be a lot of what last before they started it was six week messing all
over themselves you know we found out we were wondering about ten see i don't
i mean i graduated kindergarten a long time ago i don't know about anybody else
in a building but i graduated long ago
and i don't need daily reminders you know how to use to get like the weekly reader
and all those other low i don't need that i know exactly what's going on i know
better than anybody what's going on and where it's coming from and how it's
happening okay nothing in there empty hands okay we were going to let fat rich
finish the show that i won't be necessary here's somebody in for
lottery hello hello yes yes my name is bill i'm a first time caller
high bill forty five years old yeah i just called up there
asked to speak to the man they said that they would take a number and
wondered what it was about and i asked them if they were
if he was in fact speaking for the foundation yeah or if he was using a letter
head to further his own uh feelings yeah it's on the letterhead by the way
okay so that's basically it what what did they say uh they said uh they took my name
in my number which i gave them freely and he said that they would call back
with an answer from him okay okay well keep me posted hey great show keep it up
well behind you thank you one forty three at w i would mean the
Adam Walsh child resource center you know and this is not the first time this has
happened with that correct we had other correspondence it's a data from them
mm-hmm and i thought they had been straightened out i mean they received i know for a fact
they received a personal phone call and it was explained to them what the show is all about
and uh you know about the humor and whatever else and um evidently that's not good enough and again
to think that the man evidently i can only assume because he says he's uh listen to several
of the shows on tape mm-hmm but has never heard the show mm-hmm so i am sure that what he's talking
about is he's heard select excerpts on tape would you have been sent to him yeah uh Palm Beach hello
honey oh yeah okay well i first actually spoke to this man back in October because i went back
to school he called fau i'm going and i'm working on my master's slides up so i just want to
use this in an area that i was into and i thought the man he's a pretty stern man and when i tried
to explain to him these figures which i know as far as the abuse children like 98 percent are actually
abused when it comes to their family environment yeah that's correct people are not abused by strangers
for the whole we're talking maybe one percent these people are really abused and a man wanted
to change subject mm-hmm and uh i don't know whether he's homophobic or not i don't know if that's his
problem but when i hear all these people worrying about what you're what do you say on a phone
it's really aggravating well it's a radio show you know i've said that a million times and you
know as i said the fact that there are those people who would like folks in the audience to believe
that i'm serious and that i am of you know that foolish that i'm going to troll for us sex on the
year they've got to they really do need psychiatric health because i mean nobody except the most
idiot i mean unless you just don't want to work unless you're a fool you just don't do those
things okay and this is not my first week in the business i've been doing this a long time
well let's be people who are really concerned looking at any other government figures i just
need talking they can these are government agencies before taking part out the children who are
abused the males who are abused are abused by family members for the most part 98 percent maybe
even 99 percent so when they go accused you and i mean and what you're doing is on spot it's just
well if mr. avid has got any any uh... underage people or other people who've been abused by me then
let him bring them forward i'd like to know who they are yeah i'd love to know who they are
well just hang tight you know and uh... and i'm going to say it again the special prosecutor for
the governor which is a total waste of taxpayers money and i can't talk about the background of how
that was all instigated but uh... the special prosecutor found absolutely nothing yeah okay
we've been through enough i mean most people are let me tell you sir i have been through more than
enough okay i've been through more than enough yeah well everything and today is the day it stops and
if i have to come on a year tomorrow for four hours and talk about the entire background of this if
that's the only recourse i have i'll do it i'll do it and they can bring bill maquig back to do tend
to two i don't care okay well i sent my check for the military and i was very agitated when i first
heard this guy thought to stop it and up here but up in Palm Beach County you know how it is
when you're up here a couple years i'm your friend who knows more we talk a couple times about
rush more in the past yeah no we know where where we're coming from okay man you take care thanks a lot
yes what the hell is going on here i turned my back for twelve hours no have a case
turning your back is not something you do in this business let's just put it that way can i take a
look at these letters and memos well it's just uh... well first of all i have a very fascinating
letter here which refers generally the same thing which uh... you know is another story but this is
a letter that really and it's not only the letter it's the comments on it because i've had
conversations with the powers that p b here the last couple of days and made it very clear
very clear that i'm going to do the show uh... you know and every time you think you have an
understanding you get another reminder that we have a responsibility to do this and do that it's
not to do this and not do that and i'm not interested in that okay this is not my first job in a business
yes
are you reading the letter a red letter yeah yeah
and of course we know where this comes from but i can't i mean you could discuss it on your show i cannot discuss it
why don't you come on well i mean everybody knows where it comes from i don't think that's the issue
well i was certain you know you gave it a lot of time about a year ago you're in a half ago on your show
the one side of it i think the audience deserved the audience of this station uh
deserved to know the other side of the story and what is transpired since then of course that's a
management decision and they may you know get another carton of papers out if you even suggested you
were going to do that but i think they've got a right to know this is gone far enough
well i i have a lot of thoughts about this that i was going to share with you in private i'm not
sure i want to do it over the airways but i mean you know we have a common interest here and uh...
i have found i based on what i'm reading there the these letters you know come in all the time i
mean different versions of the patina my show as well i understand that i'm not saying that but it
just when i get not just the copy of the letter itself would it would have been okay i wouldn't
have been surprised by that but then would be reminder again on here again uh i don't think i
need to be reminded okay i think we have some people overreacting getting extraordinarily nervous
and uh... showing us that they're not quite as courageous or
sure themselves as i would i would just say i would say this based on them on them
not so much on the letter but on the memo that's attached to it i i think management of the station
is a lot more on your side on my side than i think you're feeling right now and i think it's
management's job to write memos and write notes and i think they know that and i think they you
know that there are memos i've been getting memos and notes since i've gotten here under a
couple of different administrations and i've had some differences in terms of programming with the
wise we've sat down we've talked about it there you know we come i have no problem with that i have no
problem with that i don't think i i i think you are again i'm trying to put this you know
you know i think management is a lot more with you than you may think at this point i mean at this
point i hear you a quay thing that's not the point i don't think that when you take a year and a
half of this crap and they certainly were well aware of it when i came here and i made them
extremely aware of the fact that it was not going to stop okay and when you receive another yet
another copy and you notice who it sent to the general council of miss killer who's one of those
right wings we understand all that is about and i agree with you that that is you see i don't think
man i all i'm saying is on the bottom line i think that management is i think a lot of what you're
reacting to has to do with what you went through it zeta and i think because of the and it was
a hard one you see it's starting to happen again see i've lived it okay i understand when you
when you live the experience and it starts out at one point and then it continues progressing
you have to nip it in the bud you can't agree with that i don't think there is anybody in this
business i really mean it whether it's Howard or anybody who is prepared for the ongoing day in
and day out i agree with you in a major job in your life that i have gone through for the last
year and a half i agree but i think the only mistake you're making is in equating these people
with zeta because i think in fact you suggested off the air that you and i go out with uh... my
conspire can sit down and you know i don't think there's i don't think there is the problem with
management here that you you know that you're feeling at this point i think that uh... they're
gonna work with you and i don't think i think they're gonna support you and i think they appreciate
what you bring to this station and i don't think they're gonna jeopardize that and well they already
have they already have i think you're i think you're i think you're overreacting to their feelings
about i mean i don't think there is i think there are a lot more supportive of you than you than you
think and i think when you sit down or if we sit down with them i think they're gonna tell you that
uh... i think that's the good news i mean i i think it's obviously to be in an adversary situation
with management is not a good situation i don't think you're in that situation with these people
i think uh... you know mike and uh... and uh... bill wise or with you i think they're in your corner i
think they're gonna support you and i think when push comes to shove with mr. jerky's you know
involved in in promulgating all this stuff i think they're on your side and they're not gonna take it
and i think the my reading of that memory is it's fairly innocuous i mean i i think
okay thank you i'm just trying to help you know i'm on your side i mean god you know your freedom is
my freedom you understand that and uh... so i uh you know when i what is this from what is that
on the facts machine please deliver niel you're not soliciting you might be a pervert on occasion i've
never heard you soliciting my amy's upper yuppers thank you for the support of kamele
sas without with your help for helping hang tight mellow out love the show facts p s tele
audience to stop the duck remarks the guy's name is glenn and then it has an attachment which
says young girl should be obscene and not her now that's cute or is that's what the memo says the
you're on the facts i did not say that anyway toyota of hollywood like to have a double new i od so
anyway it's one fifty five the side from that what's now at w i d uh... now in the wake of your show
yesterday and i couldn't agree with you more because you know a lot of times i disagree but i you know
the fear that was made over this poor guy in sunrise who went out and did what was done
really which is and then that jerk that calls you will why do you think it should be legalized it's
been legal for so long in every western year in every civilized country except this immature juvenile
country where we just can't grow up and except sex is a normal part of every day life we just have
to be you know on the one hand you see it everywhere you look on television they're running around in
the new and they're using the words now and everything else but on the other hand outwardly we have
to put on this puritanical attitude because america is so afraid of it you know the s word it's like
there's your food is lini bruce i would want to writing home this day was thinking about that you
know as matter what you do but you can't say the word you can't to say master but last night on the news
on channel four they showed clips from this meeting they had heard about where he resigned you know
and i'm gonna tell you if you could have seen these net now they weren't all old but the majority in
sunrise you can imagine they looked like a whoseless grandmother in drag and they were carrying on
and a venom you could see it in their faces they hate like boy we're nailing somebody now you know
and he's this sinner in this terrible and addictive yeah the worst and that that's what really
breaks your heart because like i said if jerry studs oh it had been a representative from florida
i don't think he'd be in the congress anymore you know we went back to massachusetts and he
reelected him and he gets reelected every two years they don't care about his sex life that's
not important we were listening when mayor hawthon co-ordinates said that not only has he never
engaged in any activity like that but he's impotent but oh no that was the imposter that was great
i think that was a great put on i didn't know was a put on till he said that but when the real
mayor called he was so surprised though but the guys lived in sunrise all this long it rubbed
off well i would be i was surprised at the candor that's what made me realize this couldn't be
a politician no politician that honest but uh but the thing is not only has he never did anything like
that but there is no i got to tell you they have a great mayor out there in sunrise he has no
skeletons in his closet he has never in his spirit he's free to do anything wrong or anything right
he's never done anything period which is why he's the mayor of sunrise what a place that is do you
hear the guy called up and it shoot me out for uh bringing up the the question of how many times
last year George Bush master bed you never heard that now no it's great what we're talking about
you know being candid in government what was the answer i we don't know the answer that only
you didn't call in or no no no but i didn't mean in disrespecting me the point that i'm trying to make
is that we all do things that uh you don't perhaps uh speak about in the course of a political
debate uh and that doesn't make them wrong or evil but it's just we've been so brainwashed
in condition against sex in this culture the things that are natural like masturbation god forbid
you should get up and say well i did it 200 times last year i mean you'd never be elected to anything
right people aren't prepared for that kind of honesty even though they may have done it
250 times you know not in sunrise not in sunrise listen if they did it three times in sunrise
they wrote it on the calendar they wrote it in their diary now what what's the country sweetener
some country that elected a porn star to uh it'll remember Italy to go to the office yeah and see
the difference yes credible different i have great story with chicoline when we were traveling in
Italy two years ago i went to a point on moving Italy she was in it uh and there was definitely a
a a profound difference between Italian point O and American point O she had the most incredible
20 minutes seen with a horse that i have ever seen anyway uh a lot of you we are one we go
ended 60 seconds ago that that was part of an extended state came show today and i pardon the
