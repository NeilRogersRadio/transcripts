That's not bad, we're just not bad, right?
So you're going to enjoy it.
And we already did do a thing for Guns Just Grill
when you weren't paying any attention.
So we're all cut up.
Isn't that great?
Marvelous.
That's it.
I'm just delighted that you did that, man,
because that's what we needed to wake this audience up.
A good cranche.
The message says, you may want to read that before you read it
out loud.
And who it's from?
Who is that?
You can't guess.
It says Ozzy.
I don't understand.
The phone number looks very familiar.
How about that?
Does it look like a maybe South Miami number?
Trends.
Trends coming out.
Trends.
Yeah.
What does that mean?
Our five to nine?
What does that mean?
No, 5.9.
Who's Ozzy?
Oh, I know who that is.
That's Fruitcake.
Ozzycake.
Well, I thought it was the 6-1.
Now it's a 5-9.
Oh, we've got that.
I better hurry up and get it out.
Pretty quick.
We'll be down to a 1.
It's like when your horse is two lengths in front,
you say, OK, end the race.
Now what in God's name is that?
Oh, my God.
Are you out of your mind?
Mm-hmm.
Thank you, Angela.
And crazy cookies and a huckleberry.
Mm-hmm.
You believe this?
Thank you.
This is incredible.
This is so good.
And the cheese bread?
Unbelievable.
Indescribable.
Great.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Our friends at Pasta Bili's Manatee,
I did themself today.
This is just what can I say?
How could he possibly have the number
when it's not even in a computer yet?
Oh, they gave us some huckleberries.
Oh, cute.
OK, dump the bleeps, the beeps.
I don't think it's necessary.
Now see, if you'd get off the phone there, Mr. Yanta,
we could call you.
Now maybe you took the phone off the hook, huh?
Think so?
He must have called waiting.
Oh, he does.
He has at least two lines.
You've got probably ten lines on.
Oh, yeah.
He's got more lines than we do.
Yes, he does.
That's a matter of fact.
How are we going to eat this?
I can't eat this.
We're going to have to take that home.
Yeah.
I, uh, later.
Oh, they're in.
Look at that.
He is shining.
Great.
That's great.
Yeah.
Doesn't he look like he's shining?
Or flaming something like that.
Yeah.
Okay, it's 10 o'clock on Zeta 4.
Hey, Neil.
Yes.
I hope you beat me in the ring.
You better than I am.
Even the competition agrees.
The Neil Roger show on WZTA Miami Beach Fort Lauderdale
and the Palm Beaches is the best morning show in South Florida.
I think I don't get the ninth year on an AM station
as a hero in my book.
You're like, say Thomas the Quietest.
You got no problem with me.
Even the other morning shows listen to the Neil Roger show
on Zeta 4.
I hope you beat me in the ring.
You better than I am.
Okay, now I think we got to take care of this little problem
here before we go on.
Oh, good.
This is the one that was busy before.
Right?
Mm-hmm.
Well, it's ringing now.
The shallow show.
Yeah, is this Aussie?
Yeah, hold on one second.
Oh, come on.
Hold on.
It's a radio show.
We can't hold on for you, Aussie.
What's he going to do?
Go get Harriet now.
Aussie.
Hello.
Yes, Aussie.
How can I help you?
Now, what is this?
What is this in-sippet message that we have here?
They haven't even put their numbers into the computers
and belts, though, yet.
Is the, uh...
No.
Mark Cune came over to my house the other day.
Yeah, Betty did.
And we discussed this in length.
Mm-hmm.
And the 6.1 is Peter Boulder's IQ.
It's not, uh...
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Oh, I think you got that backwards.
I think it's Mark Cune's IQ.
And I think you got the number backwards too, by the way.
It's Peter Boulder.
Well, it could be, I don't know.
Yeah, I think a 1-6.
Did you have it?
That's what I got.
You had a psychic...
Was this a psychic reading, on you?
It's the call to the monitor reading.
Monitor reading.
Like, when you look in the screen,
wait till Stan sees his...
There are no numbers in there yet, baby.
Well, go to your computer and somebody
give me some instruction.
They're not in there till tomorrow.
See, he makes...
The model, right?
You don't think they haven't done yet?
No, they don't do them until the night before.
Right.
You know better than that.
No, I don't know better than that.
That's the way they feed him in there.
They do them in there the evening before, late afternoon.
Really?
Yeah.
Why wouldn't they be ahead of it, that one step ahead?
They're not.
Why do you think they would hold them back?
You think they're holding them back for, uh...
Who's being naughty and nice?
Well, yeah, they hold it back for like a Thursday.
Mm-hmm.
Make it all look synchronized, you know, for a day.
Yeah, here's synchronicity in the great cut by the police.
Well, do you have any problem with that number?
With what? No, that would be nice.
It's not going to happen, but that would be real nice.
Oh, really?
Not possible.
Why is that not possible?
Because we'd have to do like a nine-share in January.
Are you out of your mind?
Well, okay, well, if you don't have faith in yourself,
how could anybody else have faith?
Exactly.
Okay, we're doing a seven.
Does that make you feel better?
I think you'll do a 15.
Okay, great.
I see. I see Zeta plates all over the U of M campus.
Do you really?
Yeah, we're big on campus.
If they only took...
They took the survey at Cooper City High in U of M.
We'd have a 28-shear.
I think so. They have Zeta things all over there.
And I put out less notes on everybody's windshield.
Saying you listen to Neil.
I spray-painting down there.
Good, I like that.
And that makes us a lot of friends when you do that.
I know. I leave. I'll go. I find Glenn's name.
Just spray-painting...
Just spray-pain WSHE on all the windshields, okay?
Okay, no problem.
Okay.
Have a nice one.
Good luck to you, Ozzy.
There you are.
So full of them on.
You betcha.
Sign my name, good.
Thanks, Ozzy.
He's a maniac.
Okay, it's a three minutes past 10.
