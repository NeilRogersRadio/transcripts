Well, Creep Men 25 to 54 were number one with a seven-shared.
Yes.
The ETR got a 6-1.
Great.
Number one.
Let me say it again.
Being number one in anything on this station, it's a revolutionary.
Well, certainly is the record breaking.
OK, here's 25 to 54 men and women.
We had a four-nine or fifth in the market.
And two of the stations were Spanish language.
That's great.
And GTR had a four-two.
Great.
11th.
So thank you for checking it.
Beat the crap out of Herman and McQueen.
I just mentioned that in passing because they keep saying,
what is that promo say?
Music in the morning in Herman McQueen.
What a concept.
What a concept.
What a concept.
Evidently not a concept that wins.
What concept?
A bad concept.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm going to say it better myself.
Yeah.
627 on Zeta 4.
And again, we got a collect call and Brown and G.
We better get that right on.
Hello.
I don't tell me they hung up on a collect call.
They could.
How stupid can you be?
How can you be calling collect and hang up?
Where was that from, John?
You know, Walter Blugonia.
There's a big sigh of relief in Portland, Maine.
I'll try to thank.
I mean, he's been there for about half an hour.
Well, he's gone now.
Long gone.
We ran up a good build.
It's OK.
Did we really?
It was Kelly.
Well, it'd probably be in your paycheck.
It'd probably be deducting the long distance cause
that we take collect.
We do have a Broward line open right now.
If you go to school at Hollywood Hills, I, at 777-93600.
Now, weren't some of these kids supposed to report back
to us this week?
Yeah.
They were supposed to pull their peers here.
Pull your peers.
Yeah.
That's an interesting line.
I like that.
I like that.
Pull your peers.
That's what they say in the Olympics at the
Apollo competition.
Pull your peers.
That's what the gladiators used to say.
Anyway, moving right along, let's go to the date, Kathy.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Good morning.
Wonder what happened to a more junior junior?
Is this a cake junior junior?
Yeah.
I was trying to get in contact with you.
You believe your lines are busy even from where I was trying to track.
I got to try to control your track.
I know you've seen the numbers for WS News and it's hard to control.
I didn't.
I just got back yesterday.
Well, really?
Well, I can tell you anything you want.
And of course, we can put the audience back to sleep again.
But that's a, we like to gloat.
Do you have any, do you know the gerbos are cheap in the Middle East?
I'm sure they are.
Why is that?
Well, I wanted to send you something, but they wouldn't let us.
The Middle East.
Yeah, I got a great letter here, by the way, which I'm saving for a little letter, a little
letter.
And it's got a brochure here about Milkfed Veal and the letter besieges me not to eat
Veal anymore.
I guess I can't eat dinner at Jamie and Marcie's anymore, right?
I'm going to give it to Glenn, Neil, he is.
Yeah, he, in fact, he's annoying on the brochure right now.
So anyway, what do you want?
Well, you had the 39, right?
Right.
Well, that means you did wonderful.
Yeah, that means we did about a five in December and about a four.
Or something.
And if we wouldn't have had that month of October to be saddled with, we would have done
in the fours.
So the 1.90, right?
Whatever it was, October was the one that was going on.
Was that what it was?
I think so.
Yeah.
Unmongerable.
Yeah.
Let me ask you, well, I have a prediction.
I think it'll go up.
I think it'll add about another three.
Three points?
Another three points.
You think we can do close to a seven?
Well, what, how old should I be in every mind?
Just joking.
What is that?
How old should he be?
How old should I be?
Oh, for the old 25 to 54.
Oh, okay.
I'll make sure I'm 25.
Oh, I see.
Yeah.
Very good.
It's amazing the rotation on that stuff.
This is not WINZ, by the way.
I just want you to keep that in mind.
How did they do here and there in the morning show?
What do you mean here and there?
What does that mean?
You want to know, are you just going to keep babbling?
Okay.
They had a fourth three.
That's good.
How that happened?
Well, like I said, I think a lot of diaries got confused.
I could be wrong, but I think a lot of people put down the erudges WINZ.
Really think so.
I've got everybody.
I talk to you, single person.
Well, if it's at work and it must be the older crowd, you have a lot of older people.
We don't have any of them, so they must be confused.
But they've been confused.
I don't think other people are confused.
No, they know.
They can relate to say that.
If you're like under the age of 100, you can understand it.
Well, I don't know.
I think they might have something going for that and over there.
What's that?
I don't know, but I just say they might have something.
What's it have to do?
I haven't heard it.
I'll tell you that.
Can we call a police tower?
Oh, gee.
I left the number at home.
I have the number right here.
Oh, my God.
I want to be good friends with Lena.
We're buddies now.
Are you really?
Yes.
Boy, you're ready to come back with him, I'll tell you.
You won't mind if I dial his number to you.
You're going to dial the number?
Yeah.
This or an awkward little later.
Don't call him now.
This is me.
Give me the number and I'll call him later.
I'll dump.
Okay.
I hope somebody who really hates him has heard it unfolds.
Now, come on.
There's actually a lot of Lee right now.
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
Please.
I don't want to hold you on a...
How did your good friend, Roby, young do?
Oh, good.
Oh, Roby, yeah.
I wonder if they let him out again.
Yeah.
You see, I'm work-release.
Well, let me look it up.
60 to 10 a.m.
In fact, we didn't even look at the cat.
The cat must have really had some book, you know?
Yeah, I liked it.
Yeah, that's a good question.
Let's see, how far...
How down...
Does this go?
Is it...
Well, good question, Mr. Cake.
I'll tell you, W.H.D. J did well.
Yes, they did.
Pretty well.
Isn't that amazing?
Yes, they did.
Well, that old wave?
Yeah.
Here's the cat.
Oh, man.
Roby...
Oh, gee.
In the summer book, they had a two-five in the morning.
Are you there?
Yeah.
Are you standing up or sitting down?
Roby had a point eight.
Oh.
Yeah.
Oh, that hurts.
So, you know that old saying, we used to have, when I worked there,
catch the cat, I think somebody did.
And I think he's in the microwave right now in this piece.
How was the W.H.D. W.H.D. W.H.D. An end, the Neal Factor?
They can't seem to motivate anybody.
They had, I think, like a point three.
So, the motivation station doesn't seem to be motivating too many people to listen to them.
Well, that's a problem.
That's because you're no longer...
Yeah, that's for the Neal Factor.
They'll have to move over to FN now.
I guess.
They'll have to move, like, about 95.1 or something.
Could you give out the AM-totted...
How did my cantony do?
How did the IOD do?
Well, Reneer, he did pretty well in the morning.
You know, obviously, what did he have?
4-7, I think.
Where do you see that?
Oh, I see, I'm on 25 to 54.
There are so damn many things here, you know.
It's just too confusing for my nimble mind.
Well, Mr. K. Kow's Barbie doing.
I haven't spoken or you can call up if you want me to.
I'll give her a buzz.
No, no, no, come on, leave these poor people alone.
No, I'll leave her alone.
Okay, Brunner, he had a 4-7 and more.
No, I wonder, I haven't looked at that.
I wonder what Bill McQuig did in midday.
Oh, what two, something.
I wonder what Sandy did in midday.
I think Sandy had a...
What Sandy on the air?
I think a 2-7.
Okay, here it is.
Here's that midday.
Alice, by the way, is like out of business.
Yeah.
Uh...
Gee, I can't seem to find him in here midday.
W.S. News, 2-7 to a 3.
That's Sandy with that big number.
And the Bill McQuig from a 2-0 to a 2-4.
Boy, he's really getting there slowly but surely, man.
He's making serious inroads.
How did they do overall?
Because you remember this was one year ago and they had that 4.0.
Oh, well, this is the dolphin book.
Here we go.
Do I even have that?
This is their highest book of the year every year.
And they always say that's just a coincidence.
Yeah, sure.
Here it is.
12 plus 6am to midnight, okay?
W-I-O-D from a...
Oh, from a 2-0 to a 3-6.
Ooh.
So they went up to the dolphin book, I've always do,
but that's like last year.
Yeah.
But...
It's the same every year.
Yeah.
So is that it?
I hope...
Well, you didn't give out your cohorts as news and wins.
And that's what I'm gonna hang down.
What the what?
Give out what?
What number do you want?
Overall.
Overall.
Is that all you want, do you think?
I had Jay Michaels, of course.
I already told that.
He had a 4-6 down from a 7-5,
but he kept more than half the audience,
which is quite a miracle.
That will be a person.
If you heard that show.
What am I looking for now?
Oh, see, he's got me just so confused.
Come down.
Okay, here we go. Overall, let's see.
W-I-N-Z had a 3-9 down from a 5.
So what the hell is their story?
What's the big deal that they were so excited about?
Yeah, they're gonna have a 3-6.
W-I-O-D had a 3-6.
W-S-N-U-S.
A 3-5.
They're all right together.
Yeah, they're all kind of like glumped together.
And I have one last question.
Please.
Please.
Please.
H-Y-I.
What?
Oh, that's a good question.
Why 100?
Yes.
Howdy-Ball.
Well, they spent a lot of money,
and let's see if it paid off.
They went from a 3-3 to a 3-8.
Hmm.
How'd that happen?
Well, I guess they have that 10-year-old program director.
He must know what he's doing.
Yeah, he's good.
You see, he's commercial.
He's really good.
I like him, yeah.
What are we doing wrong?
What should we do?
What should we play?
Where should we go?
Yeah, I'm going to call him a little later and tell him where to go.
Yeah.
Let me tell you something.
Was there anything yesterday in the Harold about rhythm 98 being sold?
That's the stuff that's going on.
Yes.
There was an article yesterday, so grab the...
Wait, let me ask you a question.
Do you know who's responsible for all that?
For all what?
All the stuff that's going on over there.
All the stuff that's going on over there.
Yeah, they were supposed to be changed in the 12th.
Yeah, they're going to go Spanish.
They're going to go Spanish, Mr. Dick.
Yeah, they're going to go Spanish, Mr. Dick.
Yeah, they're going to Spanish.
Yeah, they're going to Spanish.
I was supposed to happen a long time ago.
It was blown down like...
It was preaching hard.
So I'm just asked, who was responsible for it?
For what?
I was, never mind.
You'll hear about it.
Just call it the old.
No, no, no, no.
Okay, is that it?
That's it.
Yeah.
Okay, Junior.
I've sent you a trouble.
Thank you, sir.
It's 24-till-7 on Zeta 4th in the Aarajus Show.
We apologize, but after every book comes out,
we have to put up with the Fruitcake Junior.
It's one show in every three months.
I mean, that's how I was a big deal.
He's in the end of life.
And he's okay.
He's harmless.
Oh, yeah.
By the way, guys, I've got a cat update.
By the way, Hank Williams, Junior Junior called it,
says, but couldn't hold on.
Is that correct?
Yeah, that's right.
He couldn't hold on.
It slipped out of his hands.
I see.
Well, no comment on that.
You have a cancho?
Yeah, well, you said, uh...
Gee, I sure miss being over there.
Yeah, how about that?
Yeah.
We're sorry.
Yeah, how about that?
I bet he does.
What did the cat do overall?
Should we look at that number?
Is that 2D press?
Oh, it's just curious.
Let's see.
She was down to a 1-7 minute.
Really better.
They're finished.
Yeah.
They are DOA at Chee, ladies and gentlemen.
In fact, all their bumper stickers overnight say,
Chee used to be rock and roll.
Chee's...
Chee's B...
or whatever it says.
Here's the cat.
Down to a...
Oh, gee, are they doing it or what?
From a 2-4 in the summer book to a 0.7.
Ooh.
Wow.
That Howard Primer, man, is he...
Is he radio or is he radio?
Point.
Seven.
No, seriously.
I mean, you look at him and you see radio when you look at Howard.
That's a tough...
That hurts.
Now, what was I looking for, Jim Kelly on the cat?
Well, how big could it be if they did a 0.7?
Yeah, that's probably a good looking page.
Yeah.
Well, let's see how she did.
Um...
Oh, whom I looking for?
Jim Kelly.
Oh.
Let's see, down from a 2-5 to a 1.
But if he had a 1, I was probably their big number.
Yeah, probably.
His robe he had, like, a point A.
I think they need to get Jack McDermott back and straighten that plate out.
Play some of those Edison's own day that Jack likes so much from his personal collection.
23-4-7 on Zeta 4, we do have an open line in date at 620-3600.
Why don't you do a break here?
We have to just do a short break and then we'll come back.
The most classic rock.
Chee's a bus of e.
You know, the kids just keep getting the hard...
This morning we've been punching their buttons as they say on some shows.
Let me say it again as they say on...
I wonder why they didn't fire.
Like what show, for example?
I wonder why it didn't fire.
St.Mitches.
St.Mitches.
Talking about St.Mitches.
Now, not the numbers have come out and we congratulate St.Mitches on his usual steady job there, man.
You know what? Right around a 4-3-9 right in there beating the daylights out of Mr. Ego and Alice.
Alice is like history.
I know this.
2-5.
I never hear one any way.
What did you ever say anything about?
I haven't turned that station on in so long my radio would probably...
It would probably keep scanning if I punched up that button.
I don't think the signal's strong enough to stop your radio.
That's an interesting point.
When you punch scan on a car radio, it stops or is it seek?
One of the other, I get confused.
But it stops on stations that are strong enough with this signal to lock in.
That's correct.
And the W snooze is no longer that strong.
Questionable, yeah.
Questionable.
Yeah, close.
If you have a strong car radio at light.
I haven't seen Rick Edwards, our corporate chief engineer around here lately.
Maybe he's the new engineering honcho over there.
Maybe he is to get all the credit for their technical success.
Because if anybody could do it, no.
No, I'm just going to be just hanging out here today.
I'm tower number 4.
OK, let's take another call and the lines are all just either tied up or ringing or flashing or doing something.
We're going to be calling Lee Fowler a little bit to get his first vacation's observations on these latest ratings.
Yeah, we want to hear what he had his strictly objective views.
Oh yeah, I'm going to stick here.
The last thing Steve is probably hanging out over there this morning.
Uh-huh.
Dave Chawhi, hello.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I call you wine and then you...
I've been holding for an hour and I'm from Killian.
Are you serious?
Yes.
How come you didn't tell Captain Dave you're from the early morning?
The early Captain Dave was that other guy.
Oh, that John Ford maybe, I can't believe it.
I've been holding some 620.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
What if you don't like it?
Now I have a good excuse not to go to school.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Now, didn't we do a public service for you today?
Sure.
I mean, was there anything special going on in school today?
Nothing really, just a normal dope smoking and the beach.
Exactly.
So you're not going to miss anything.
Are they going to miss you?
No, I don't care if they don't miss me or not.
Right, like what's greater you win?
I'm in the 11th.
Oh, you're a junior then.
That's what we want.
We're going to hear from a lot of juniors today.
You're right.
Like Hank Williams Jr.
And what's his name?
More Downey Jr. Jr.
Yeah.
Junior Junior.
Yeah.
Oh, Steve Sonsky Jr.
Steve Sonsky Jr. is good.
We'll probably hear from Joe Johnson Jr.
So, live the Thornton Jr.
Maybe even Tom Jicke Jr.
We'll be calling him.
Wow, that looks like a family Ross Jr.
No, I do want to hear from her.
And we'll get a call from Frank Motek Jr.
So what are you going to do today?
You're going to be on Miami Vice next tomorrow.
Who is?
I think.
Who is?
What?
Who?
He's Sonsky.
He's going to be on Miami Vice tomorrow.
Oh, he's going to be like a bartender.
Oh, what's he going to do impersonating a human being?
It's just a joke, Steve.
You're okay.
He's not a bad guy.
What does he like your father or something?
So what are you going to do all day?
Just going to hang out?
Yeah, probably watch the regular fill and all that stuff.
Watch what?
Not on.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
I'm asking a woman that went to study her baby.
You don't know who Kate Junior, do you, buddy?
Hahaha.
Yeah.
For her senior?
I don't hang out with your friends, Neil.
Okay.
Well, listen, I'm glad we did you.
No, no, I got a couple things to tell you.
Okay.
Okay, let's look into this.
So, we're going to see Steve Kane tomorrow.
Yeah.
Male strippers from the Crazy Horse.
Hmm.
Are you serious?
I am serious.
I'm looking at the back of the TV guys.
Oh, my God.
And now I run till tomorrow, topic.
like, cheering homeless sexuals.
Curying homeless sexuals?
Yes.
On the Alice Ranch El Show, I don't know.
Yeah, well how can you curious yourself though, you know?
It'll be quite an experience, huh?
Yeah.
I guess I better tune in for that one, having a bad.
I better take the cure.
I don't know if you can pick it up or not.
No, I probably won't be able to hear it,
but I'll just put my dial on that spot
and pretend that I'm hearing it.
Maybe I'll get some psychic vibrations.
So who's gonna be on that show?
I don't know.
Yeah, that's the question.
Mike Thompson.
I'm on the TV guys.
Probably Mike Thompson and maybe Lee Thawler
would come back for that one too.
Is that it?
That's it.
Well listen, you gave us some, certainly some stuff
to think about.
There's no question about that.
OK.
Have a great day.
You too.
OK.
What a nice guy, huh?
It was great.
So hanging out, he's skipping school today.
Hope he has a good day.
We don't want to encourage young people to skip school,
but if they happen to be in a mood,
and they want to stay home, go ahead.
You know, you only live once.
Have a good time.
26 till 8 on, say to four.
Accidents.
Oh, gee.
That one on.
