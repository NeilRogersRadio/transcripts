Turn it off because they want to see if we're going to make it.
If I'm going to make it, they're going to carry me out of here.
You know what I think we'll do?
You know how like Don Cox used to do all that contrived stuff?
Try to get publicity.
Yeah.
Really helped them a lot, didn't it?
He used to.
Yeah.
Well, he's been known to do it every now and then since then too.
I think what we'll do is just maybe we can find another card of this somewhere.
That's what she said.
She said there were like bird droppings over her shoulders.
Okay, here's the Barbie report for the bird on date County Line 2.
Hello.
It's still getting the fingerprint transfer from the other night.
Yeah, you're right.
Look into this.
This is another one of our guests the other night.
Boy, it made one of his cameo appearances.
How come my screen just went out Captain Dave?
Well, what an effect you had on my screen.
Why is it time delay?
Oh, cut it out.
Would you please?
It's joking.
I want to find out.
Oakland, we and Barbie and I divorced and I can give you the phone number now.
Oh, the Barbie report about that young lady.
Now you said she had a big ass.
Oh, I don't remember.
Dave said yes.
I remember.
Yes.
Oh, she does have.
I like that.
I hope she's listening too.
Yeah.
I thought she was cute.
She was incredible.
Yeah.
I thought she was very cute.
I want to act up.
She was fine.
Yeah.
Well, she isn't even my type and she just she was fantastic.
I can't believe that's Barbie.
Now she's too crazy for Glen.
She's too crazy.
She's totally out of it.
Yeah.
And if she was hanging around with you guys, you one has to really wonder what that's all
about.
I thought she says something lacking there like calcium or something in the brain.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Something lacking.
And well, she wants to she wants to be Glen's bear his first child.
No problem.
Yeah.
I have to give you the first one.
No, I beg to differ with that.
There has to, you know, in order to do that, there's certain equipment necessary.
Trust me.
I don't know.
Well, that's half of the battle.
I need to give Glen the phone number off the radio.
Yeah.
Call me after 10.
I don't.
I can't call you after 10.
Why?
Because.
Well, put him on hold and Captain Dave will take the number.
Yeah.
I'll take the number.
I'll wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Another one.
Would you really taking this number?
Yeah.
Well, I used to have it.
Barbie and I go way back.
I used to have it too, but lately it's.
Now Barbie and I go way back.
Oh, stop it.
Would you please?
Oh, you just.
Does it kneel?
Do you want the number?
No, I don't want the number.
Although the way things are going lately, you know, I made a.
Well, I know one person that's interested.
In what?
Well, and moving in.
Oh.
They were kicked out of the apartment the other day.
One of the rhythm 98 DJs stand the man who would love to move in with the ball.
Stand the bear.
Okay.
Well, I'm not running a boarding house.
Okay.
In fact, at this moment, I have one border that I'm trying to move out.
Oh, but this border will put out.
Nothing.
No, we're not interested.
This is not the brothel of the year.
Okay.
Like us is back in Phoenix.
Okay.
Okay.
Let me put you on hold before you just totally destroy your credibility with little is left.
All right?
What a call.
Okay.
That's on two.
You get a lot of sleazy calls to that.
That's fruit cake.
Yeah.
That's the fruit cake.
Yeah.
Yeah.
See on FM, we welcome him on AM.
We used to pretend that we discouraged him.
Oh, I didn't know that.
I didn't get the memo.
I don't know if he's okay.
I didn't get a memo about the change.
Or are you not allowed to speak to him anymore?
I thought I'd just hear him speaking to him.
Now, the word from Gary Lawrence was the next time he speaks to him on the phone, he's
out.
No, no, it's okay if it's on the year.
No, he never said that.
He didn't?
No.
I was in there when he said it.
And Mark Cune said that, you know, you don't work for him anymore, but Peter Boulder
would certainly back us up.
Didn't you just hear him talking to fruit cake?
Like you were.
Sort of like you.
Yeah, but I don't have any altamatos.
Okay.
In other words, I can talk to him over there.
I want it's my show.
No, no, no, no.
See, you missed the point here.
What they did not want me to do was talking to him, you know, like privately.
But on the air, they hear the entire conversation.
You didn't want you to yintho with him?
That's correct.
And on the air, they hear the entire conversation and realize it was really nothing, you know,
no information.
Yeah, that's what they realized.
They realized there was nothing very, very well put.
So that's okay.
I agree.
All right.
Robert County.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
This is Barbara.
Hi, Barbara.
I want to tell you how much I enjoy the show.
Oh, wait a minute.
Barbara, you know, I was supposed to talk to Patty from New York is in Humana Hospital and
I was going to call her between 8 and 8.30.
We got all carried away and we give away those tickets.
And I forgot.
But I want to wish I'm sure Patty from New York hopefully is listening and we wish you're
a speedy recovery and all the best and I'm sorry.
And I need to.
Okay.
And I want to be sure I got to work, put my vote in today.
All right.
Here's a good caller.
Now what's your scam?
So we are taking a vote, right?
Well, evidently.
It's Mark's mom.
Oh, it's Barbara.
See?
Yeah, another incestuous caller.
And none of mine have been incestuous.
It's right where you say.
Yeah, I must go because I'm going to have a hard attack.
My heart is really pounding.
I'll bet.
What kind of attack?
Have a wonderful day.
You too.
Okay.
There they go.
You too.
I love that.
He said don't pester her too much.
In other words, pester her a little bit but don't over do it.
Like you were in the restaurant the other night just enough to keep her on the edge of insanity.
26 till 10 on Zeta 4 and God's will be along at 10 o'clock with those insipid drop ins.
And you know, I'm giving up.
I'm not going to give him any more advice because we gave him sound advice as my friend Rick
would say over on university drive.
We gave sound advice.
Absolutely.
And, you know, that was it.
There he is right now on cue.
I'm telling you, you can listen to all those yet to start there.
It sucks.
Just wait till 10.
You'll see.
Maybe the same thing.
Get out of here.
Will you please.
We're not listening at 10.
We're going to be listening to midday melodies on hot 105.
You're going to be listening to your friend Patty Murray.
That automated.
Yeah, my she's a bitch.
Stop.
