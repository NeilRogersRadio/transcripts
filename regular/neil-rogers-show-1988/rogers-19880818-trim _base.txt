Oh, that's good.
It's the golf game.
It's called G-O-F.
The G-O-F at the golf game.
Are you locations in the Bay Area?
Five.
Wow.
But we don't have time to get into the Bay Area in Atlanta.
I think there's two of these two.
Now it's your turn.
Well, speaking of food, it appears slicing pizza has an occupation.
That's correct.
This is shocking, don't you think?
This is shocking.
A hazard other than the one posed by sharp blades.
In a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine,
they always keep up on stuff like this.
You bet.
A doctor describes a case of what he calls pizza cutters paulsing.
The doctor says, are you suffering from this?
The doctor says a weakness of the hand muscles
comes from pressing the handle
of a roller blade pizza cutter into the palm.
Among other things.
Don't you think this is what Wendy was suffering from this morning instead of the pizza cutter's paulsing?
His prescription for relief is simple.
Don't do it.
Exactly.
Stop.
Use another kind of cutting.
Everything will be fine.
Now what was that again?
You go to the doctor and say, every time you go in,
you know, that old little, uh,
Hintey Youngman joke, you go in the doctor and you say,
doctor, it hurts when I do this.
And the doctor says, well, don't do it.
And see, in this case,
it turned out to be fact.
Unbelievable.
It's 9.23 now.
And what are we going to play the music?
We ought to play this next.
We'll play Tainted Love for you right after this.
Neil Rogers, The Rock and Roll Monster.
Zeta Ford, boy, that sounded great.
Soft Cell with Tainted Love for you this morning.
That we just got today.
That of course is from January 82.
And is the record that's meant the longest time of any single in the history of Billboard's Charge.
43 weeks on the chart.
And it only went incredibly to number eight, Cap and Dave.
Only went to number eight.
And there it is.
It's there from Britain, Soft Cell.
Of course, as we mentioned earlier,
the song that was chosen by Rolling Stones,
the number one single for the past 20 years,
which is...
That is fact, it's stolen, wrongs, man.
That's a good song.
That is a good song.
And that's one of my favorite oldies of all time.
That's coming out in the next edition, the top 100 singles of the past 20 years.
Wow.
We have another first time caller this morning.
This person is in Hollywood.
Hello.
Hello.
You're a first time caller.
Yeah, I think I'm your youngest loyal Zeta listener too.
I want to have a content.
How old are you?
I'm 20.
Is that...
Is that...
No, no.
We hear from teenagers.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, sure.
And then also people love to put their kids on the phone.
We've had some of that this week.
Three-year-olds and eight-year-olds, you know?
Oh, shucks.
Yeah, but...
Oh, well, well, I can say that...
I like Zeta a lot.
Well, why do you think it's unusual that your age should be listening?
I don't know.
I know a lot of people that are 20 years old
that are listening to...
Boom, boom, boom, boom.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
And our research shows that a lot of women also,
in your age group, 18 to 24, listen to gloves and joy and stuff like that.
That's Serpy saccharine music for some odd reason.
You notice some of your girlfriends doing that?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, a lot of them that are like, yeah, they're 20s.
Yeah, why is that?
So you know what that makes people think about...
You know, the stereotypical thought is that your airheads.
Mm-hmm.
You don't want to hear any content.
All you want to hear is like mindless music, you know?
Not me.
I like Zeta.
Before you guys came along though, I listened to Waxy.
Uh-huh.
Boy, those guys, aren't they?
I know.
What you're not, you know.
They're awful.
Every minute you hear that cow going, baaah!
And I listened to them a couple of weeks ago when I was on vacation.
And they talk and talk and talk and talk and they never say one thing ever.
Never.
Babylon.
Just babble and talk like for hours.
And nothing has ever said.
Have you noticed that?
Incredible.
Well, I'm glad to see you're an exception.
You figured it out.
You're listening.
That's great.
You should be congratulated.
I love Zeta though.
It's great.
Oh great.
Well, I'm so glad you called and spoke to us this morning.
Wait a minute.
Don't kick me off the...
Oh, I'm not.
I was wondering, when are you guys going to have a pink-floy weekend when you're going to have, you know, like you do the beetles?
Really?
I don't know.
I'll ask after the Archies weekend.
Yeah.
Johnny said right after we do the Archies for a weekend, you know.
Now I'll suggest it to our Pergon-Driver Rose Folcher.
Yeah.
Do you guys know Jack Lieberman?
Sure.
Yeah.
Just he a joke or what?
I think so, don't you?
Yeah.
I used to work for him.
Did you, really?
What a gas, right?
Wow.
When you were a teenager.
Yeah, I did.
But then recently, not too long ago, I worked for him.
So, I don't like that.
So, what do you do now?
Oh, I answer a phone.
Oh, well, somebody has to do that, you know.
It's important.
It's important, really.
I have too many though.
I verify credit cards.
Well, before I kick you out of here, why don't you say hi to Captain Dave?
Hi, Captain Dave.
Yeah.
Like you said, Kevin Dave.
Oh, no, Captain Dave.
They have to say it correctly.
You know, kind of have to sort of lumble it.
I've got to say it.
They kind of have to lumble it.
You know, we got this letter today, someone a photo request.
Oh, yeah.
And it's addressed to Mr. Bird, Neil or Glenn.
He'll or Flynn.
Yeah.
And that's something.
Well, I'm serious when I'm very sincere when I tell you, I'm glad to have you as a listener.
Oh, see that.
All right.
It's one of the free Zeta shirts.
Should I do you a...
You want a free Zeta shirt?
I want a Zeta shirt.
You know what I drove around for a half an hour trying to find this place one day just to get a license plate.
Finally, one of my friends had an extra one and they gave it to me.
You couldn't find us?
No, well, you guys were going to be at some...
Oh.
...and or something.
I don't know what it was.
Yeah.
I don't drink, but I was going to go there just for the license plate.
Oh, yeah.
Well, hmm.
I have to think about it, okay?
Hey.
All right.
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't have any shirts with me right now.
Yeah, right.
I don't.
I'll be over there in about five bitters and hopping in my...
I honestly don't have one.
But if I did, what kind would you like?
I want one that just says, I love Zeta 4 on it.
Oh, a Zeta 4 shirt.
Well, we do have those.
We do have Zeta.
What did I say?
Oh, I was thinking about the unbelievable shirts.
Oh, no.
I have our pictures on.
I just want a regular Zeta 4 shirt.
Hmm.
Okay.
What should I tell our captain day?
I know you don't want to deal with this.
This show just grounds you with it.
Did it really?
Yes.
Oh, okay.
Sorry.
See you later.
Okay, bye.
Hey, I didn't realize that.
Well, this calls for you.
Hello?
Yeah.
Yeah, talk to Captain Dave.
Look, this is a rock and roll station here.
Now, don't play this computer,
an early 80s battle.
I was having one that we got rid of.
It was dead.
Now, who would you rather talk to Captain Dave?
The last lady or this caller?
At least this is interesting.
I think I was a little bit of touch and go to it.
Oh, okay.
He's out of his mind, but it's so cool.
He's showing for a t-shirt.
He's groveling for that.
Okay, well then you talk to him.
You deal with it.
No, don't get surly in all that.
That phone call was about three minutes too long.
That's all.
So what can we do for you?
Well, look.
You've got to play.
You know, I have to admit,
it is a step in the right direction.
At least it's not one of those tunes.
You just play over and over again until, you know,
the legs fall off of it.
Now, we told you why we played this record.
There was a purpose for it.
You don't hear that much.
That's number one, but also we played it
because it was, it had the longest longevity
of any record on billboard.
We thought it was a...
I just showed the stupidity of the American people.
Well, I don't judge the American people.
I, we reflect the American people.
Oh, Danny, then why don't you go work for
why I went under something?
I like why I went under.
Shoot them.
You deserve that, Jack.
Is that it?
It's called, I'm pretty long time.
I know.
Kind of grinding at home.
What you guys could do.
You know, there's a certain ban
that all the rock stations are too wimpy to play
and you guys could break new ground there.
What is there we go?
Living color.
Imagine if you put Jimmy Hendrix in Led Zeppelin
and you had a singer like, oh, it is writing on it.
God, you'd have culture clash.
That's, that's the total.
It's, they like, they can play three styles and...
Who is it?
Is that the group living color?
Yeah, living color.
The album's called, Vivid.
Well, I have to check it out.
I can produce it.
Yeah, well, maybe we'll check it out sometime.
All right.
Okay.
All right, later on.
Now, what was your other here?
Tainted Love, which was a smash or...
What was the name of that?
Living color.
Yeah, I don't know what they sound like,
so I really couldn't say.
I'm gonna stick with the hits.
It was only on the chart for 43 weeks,
but I guess it's gonna be much.
Yeah, there was a reason that we played dead.
I still like...
Criticized.
You know, what?
That felt bad that we didn't have the long version.
Yeah, we were kind of...
You can't please everyone, so you got to please yourself.
That's right.
That's right, baby.
Well, this show, this has been a battle
like I have never been through.
It's 936.
We'll do this, and then we'll continue to slug it out.
Today at Noon Gonders' Grill, featuring blacks from Steve Winwood,
the Who, and the Rascals.
Tomorrow, Friday, it's all Request Led Zeppelin.
On Gonders' Grill at Noon, here on Zeta 4.
Now, Johnny tells us there are a lot of...
Well, this is an old one.
Today is the Led Zeppelin.
God, nice.
Geez.
Okay, start over.
This show has been...
I have never...
It's been amazing.
...through anything like this in my entire life.
Because you're in a different studio.
Not just that, but we had somebody who screwed up the spots today.
The spots are all screwed up just everything.
Everything normal now, but we, earlier this morning, it was a night.
You people have no idea what a nightmare we have been through today
to put this show together for you.
And if we're in here tomorrow, I'm going to say it again in public,
and I'm sticking with it.
I don't care.
Nobody's taking this personally.
If we're in here again tomorrow, it's going to be all music.
I'm not doing a show here again because they promised me.
Well, we do 16 in a row.
Yeah, we'll do 16 in a row tomorrow.
We'll do 16 billion in a row tomorrow.
They promised me we would be back in our studio so we could do the show.
What's it look like in there?
It's coming along.
They worked until two in the morning, Moon said.
So they're definitely working on this.
There are a lot of cigarette butts in here.
So some of them are doing the same thing.
Yeah, that's right.
We've got to give them incentive, or they won't get it ready.
You know how people are?
If we don't say anything, it won't be ready.
But they got to fix that noise, too.
Oh, I like this mic.
It's great.
But I mean, can we hear that other morning again?
Oh, you can hear the AM.
You can hear the AM, huh?
Oh, good.
We need to get the current temperature for it.
Here's another first time caller.
Hi, hello.
Good morning.
Good morning.
How come you never call?
Because I listen on and off.
I find this show.
I don't want to sound, you know, heretical.
But listening to Neil in the morning is like listening to Morton Downey Jr.
in the morning.
I mean, it just, it wipes me up too fast.
Mm-hmm.
Everybody complains, but everybody would miss a word.
Yes, that's right.
You just got to see what is going to come out of this man's mouth next.
Yes.
What could he possibly say next?
You love to hate him.
Yes.
And I have a couple of requests.
Oh.
And thank you for playing Tated Love.
I had never heard the full thing before where they go into where they don't love ghosts.
Didn't that great?
It is excellent.
Yeah.
I don't know what's happened to them.
They should have more hits.
I know that was the only one.
You're right, they should.
This is a long shot.
You guys in Neil's files, some where he had magic count by the folks.
I don't believe so.
I've never seen that.
Nobody has it.
It's a beautiful one.
Nobody seems to have it.
Now, Johnny has it at home.
How about if we haven't bring it in, we'll play it for you tomorrow?
That would be great.
Would that be great?
I am always frustrated with any of the three major stations.
And you know who you are.
When you play the Golden Flumbrism mentally by the Beatles, I know you guys hate dead air.
But all three of you major people have been guilty of omitting the her majesty.
It's a pretty nice girl bit.
I thought it was about 10 seconds to dead air.
But still, that's excellent.
And I'd love to hear it.
Okay.
Now what time do you get up in the morning?
Oh, usually about 6.30.
Okay.
Well, we'll play Magic Town for you tomorrow about then.
Okay.
Thank you.
Maybe you can wake up to it.
Play it like 6.35 for you.
Okay.
Thanks for calling.
Thanks, bye bye.
Bye bye.
North Miami.
Hello.
Now they're there.
I know they're there.
Get to 1 in 6.
Okay.
Hi.
Hello.
Yes.
Yeah.
Well, I liked that song.
Did you?
Did you remember it?
Yeah, from when I was in seventh grade.
I remember everybody loved it back then.
I really liked it back then.
I haven't heard it since I was in sixth grade.
That's why we played it.
That was the two reasons we played it.
Because nobody plays it.
And because it was the longest record in history on Billboard.
Well, I'm 17 now.
I must have been like 10 then.
Yeah.
It was really, I liked it then a lot.
But I was running if you could play rock-sea music.
Do you have rock-sea music?
Oh, boy.
I don't know.
I just don't know.
You know, we're not in our usual situation.
I don't know.
I'll see if we can check it out for you.
You know that song more than this.
Oh, is that great?
Yeah, it's a great song.
Great record.
Well, let's show you a look up rock-sea music in the book.
Oh, they didn't do anything, but it's a great song.
We'll see if we can do it for you maybe tomorrow.
Well, how about some more music from that age?
From that period.
Yeah.
Well, we'll see what we can do.
Okay.
Thank you.
Good to hear from you.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
So, we've got a plantation now.
Hello.
Hello.
Plenty.
Five minutes after 8 o'clock on Dave's a preta.
Joe Johnson is here.
Wow.
I can't believe that.
Good.
That's like 60 years ago.
Now, you know, we're doing a lot of reminiscing this week.
A lot of playing stuff in the past, and that one went back further than anything, I think.
Boy, was that a great call?
That would be a heart style.
There's always somebody out there taping, isn't it?
We're in liquid.
It is.
It's frightening, yeah.
Now, this call is Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
How are you?
Good.
I feel really redundant now, but I call to say I have a vote for Tainted Love.
She likes Tainted Love.
Very much.
Yeah.
Wouldn't it great to hear it again?
It was.
Like you say, you don't hear it very much.
Ever.
Never.
And I remember it.
And I remember liking it then.
I was putting my makeup on.
I started dancing.
It was great.
Yeah.
Good.
Yeah.
That's how you played it.
What a vision.
Yeah.
Really?
It wasn't too bad.
Yeah.
Well, great.
Yeah.
I haven't spoken to you all in such a long time.
Yeah.
It's been nothing but different voices this whole week.
Yeah.
The last time I called you to bring back from nostalgia, it was during your formula.
Oh, the formula.
Now, did you...
That was last Christmas.
Yeah.
I hadn't moved yet.
And I called up and you got it right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wasn't that amazing that worked so well?
So, if you know something, I have to tell you that I started taking the pill.
And now it's not right anymore.
Yeah.
You know, I read something someplace.
There's a variable that you...
You know, I don't know how you figure them in.
Now, I read somewhere that said that the reason American women's breasts are larger now
than they've ever been is because of birth control pills.
I did read that.
So, what you're saying is that's true, right?
Yeah, I could be.
But then again, there's like a downside to it, too.
Uh-oh.
I think there's a lot of physically fit women who do aerobics and run.
And I know that that tends to streamline you.
I see.
Touch my drift.
Yeah.
I don't know why I'm so nervous talking to you today, right?
Oh, no, neither.
It's just me and I'm sure you.
That's right.
Yeah.
I've been a little surly today, but I'm not surly at you.
Yeah, this is true.
You put your foot down today.
Oh, you bet.
You have to do it in this business.
I bet the dirty job.
It's like Neil says, in this business, you have to do it.
Because if you know just as well as you...
You know that if I don't, it won't be ready.
Well, I have to say, I don't think it's just that business.
I think it's the little axioms of life.
Yeah.
You have to...
Yeah, there are situations in people that push you and you've got to push back because you're
going to get pushed down.
Yeah, that's absolutely correct.
Yeah.
And if I don't threaten, you know, they won't get it done.
There'll be like no reason.
They'll have no reason to get it done.
They won't care, you know?
But if they know, and I will stick to this, I'm going to tell you that if it's not done,
it's going to be all music tomorrow.
I don't care, you know?
What's okay if you bring more things out of...
I don't know.
I don't want to stay out of the closet.
Oh, it'll be great.
It'll be...
It's like can't it love.
It would be lots of fun.
Oh, it'll be great music, trust me.
I really do.
I have every bit of confidence in the three of you's taste in music.
And remember, we got Johnny Dark here, so it could be mind-boggling, you know?
Oh, my God.
So I remember him from when I was very young.
I just turned 33.
Oh, bless you.
And I am a girl from the QANF UN days.
Oh, my God.
There's little, like, radios, there's little AN radios that plugged in the wall and I had it
on my bed and I used to, like, put my ear right to it because we, you know, it was just...
everybody was always complaining about that kind of music back then.
And I remember switching back and forth between QANF and FUN.
And I very, very, very remember all of this weird stuff that you guys have been having.
And surf, I remember surf, but you just, like, put it all to...
All the way to the end.
Yeah, remember the station closest to your glove compartment?
I said that it was like the...
There was only AN in the beginning of the center.
That's correct.
But I remember there was something called Magic Bus then too.
Yeah, but that was like an underground station.
Definitely.
I went when I was 17, they interviewed me on the air.
About what?
Well, my girlfriend and I used to call up.
We were bored and 17 and we graduated early.
And we named her self.
I was dirty Diane and she was Amara Fahmeet.
Oh, my God.
How we used to call them up really late at night and talk to them about music and life and, you know, philosophy.
I remember her.
Johnny says he remembers there.
I named John M.
That I had this massive crush on.
We went down there.
We got decked out in thrift shop specials and she was in gold, LaMae, and I was in black velvet.
And we had like little beauty marks that we painted on ourselves and gloves and the whole mind yards.
And we went down there and they interviewed us.
Uh-huh.
And we did this in the daytime and I remember when we left my house, my father, we just about had a baby.
Like, I was drinking out.
But it was real fun, yeah.
Now, do you know that the magic bus became gloves 94?
I do.
It's unfortunate things that happen.
I guess that's what happens when you get old.
Yeah.
That's when we got a run, but we're going to play an all-left-you-f-you-ing jingle for you.
Oh, thank you.
Have a great time.
Bye-bye.
You're with WFU-N790.
Where the music starts, takes four and seven.
That last note.
Amazing that she remembers, isn't it?
I've got a problem here.
What?
I just, um...
And at first I thought it was me, but I cannot find any news.
I've done it all.
And I walked over to the A.M. sign.
They said they're having the same problem too.
The only thing that you're finding is like 75% of it is Republican convention stuff.
And as far as the type of news we do, the bizarre, the bold, the daring type of news.
Okay.
Do you have one at all?
Do you have one story you can do?
I've got like one.
Okay, and I'll do...
You do one.
I'll look for another one.
Okay, I'll do one.
You do one, all right?
There's absolutely nothing happening today.
I get something I can do here.
How do you say today?
You say, get it started.
We'll be all right.
We'll be okay.
Just relax.
It's on fire.
It's on fire.
No, no, no.
Oh, no.
They'll be here with us for the news, Ken Day.
Oh, God.
It's urgent for you.
Ed, will you stay with us during the news?
I certainly will.
Okay.
Let's get going, Ken Day.
This is going to be a great newscast.
Ah, in the middle of the bed again.
I like that.
Well, in case you lost count, convention managers say about 50,000 balloons.
And I say 150,000 balloons will rain down after Bush's acceptance speech.
They claim it'll be a world record for an indoor balloon drop.
I think it will be, right?
Yeah.
I think so after, didn't you have like a birthday party once?
It was like 25,000.
Uh-huh.
Cedar Point theme amusement park in San Descoye, Ohio is building what is built as the largest,
fastest roller coaster in the world.
That's a good story.
Called the Magnum XL200.
It'll go 70 plus miles per hour.
Whoa.
It will peak at 210 feet.
Now after that, it's 156 foot hill and 80 foot hill, two tunnels and smaller hills.
Take you two and a half minutes and it should be ready for the 1989 season.
No, see, I guess I missed that one.
That's a good story.
That would be a great story, man.
That's a good one.
And for the third time, I'll announce the birthdays today.
Shelley Winner's a 66.
Rosalind Carter, 61.
Movie director Roman Polanski, 55, who's still not allowed in this country.
That's right.
I know.
Robert Redford is 51.
Martin Moll's 45.
Actor Dancer Patrick Swayze, 34.
And Malcolm.
Do I have to?
Yes.
Malcolm's Jamal Warner, 18.
And I've been, a dare has been laid down.
The gauntlet has been thrown down before me.
I'm going to watch the concert for the first time tonight.
Isn't this great, Ed?
And the first time you've ever been with is during the newscast.
And of your company.
He's out of the house.
He's 99 blue.
Major drugs are passed today.
You're lonely tonight.
You're losing all my...
It's going in.
Ed, would you like to go on that rollercoaster?
What kind of rollercoaster is going on about 129 times?
I think that guy, that's really a poor bitch,
that you're going to build it grateful.
I think you want to bury him in it.
You know what?
See how it all finsed together Captain Dave?
Finally, I mean, Ed, you put me, you've cheered me up.
I think he's busy eating six hot balls.
I guess he can't go on a roll into it.
I'll never doubt Neil's opinion about panic phone calls.
I'm still searching, you know.
Here comes the nervous panel.
He'll be back, Monday.
Ed, here comes the weather now.
I think about much.
Here we go.
That's right.
30% chance of afternoon thunderstorms.
Hi, today 92.
20% tonight, looking pretty good.
But then we do have a 50-50 chance against starting tomorrow.
Right now it's 81, my friend.
Let's 9-53.
You want to know.
They have options on the radio.
He brings you all sorts of topics to listen to on your show.
Monday through Friday.
Before 6 to 9 to 10.
And he's talking to you.
Right here.
Right here.
I'll say that 4.
Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers in the mornings.
Sanis Classic Rock every day.
Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers in the mornings.
Sanis Classic Rock every day.
Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers in the mornings.
Sanis Classic Rock every day.
Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers in the mornings.
Sanis Classic Rock every day.
You have a problem with that.
It's so full of misinformation.
And they're going to go to 10-30 actually.
Yeah, before 6 till after 10.
Maybe 10 o'clock and 30 seconds maybe.
9-57 means we have this.
This has been the longest show we have been since we've...
I agree.
This has been a battle royal mango sleepy.
I feel like a wrestler.
You know, I feel like...
The colors have been great.
They've made up four.
The colors have been fine.
Ed was wonderful.
They aren't doing the news with Ed.
Was a historic.
Didn't make any sense at all.
But that's natural.
Now, tomorrow is our last show.
Neil will be back Monday.
And Peter Boulder is in the building.
And I say again, if we are not in our old regular Neil Rogers studio tomorrow...
No, don't get so full.
It is going to be music intensive.
Music intensive.
I'm...
They shouldn't have put this through this anyway.
And we've overcome.
We've made it sound good.
You know, when Greg goes on vacation,
noodles plays music all week.
He's a disc jockey.
Sell-down backwards.
And does this mean that I have to raid the closet and bring in just staccents?
Do you better be prepared?
I want you prepared.
I want you to do that anyway.
Now that you have a contingency plan.
Maybe we should do it.
Maybe we'll do it anyway, because it's Friday.
Maybe we...
You know, if we are in the studio, maybe we'll do some of that.
And we play to music.
This morning we'll play all music tomorrow.
Now, if we're back in the regular studio, we'll do a regular show.
Maybe we can be...
Maybe one song and one bit, one song and one bit.
Maybe something like that.
What am I playing for?
I'm ready to get out of here.
First record is make me smile by Chicago.
Oh, I do.
Let's hit ramp to zero and we get out of the...
You're not going to take these three?
No, I'm sorry.
Oh, come on.
No.
They've been holding on forever.
Okay.
I mean, just...

You're our last callers.
Yes, Glenn.

I mean, the names of obscure oldies.
Chick-a-chick-a-boom-boom by Willie in the Red River Band.
Wow.
In 1969, it heard that.
I haven't heard that in a long time.
Uh-huh.
And also, Albert Cabana.
Albert Cabani by Shannon.
That's...
And how...
What do you think of that?
I wonder why the guys made me take this call.
Oh, ho, ho.
The guys.
The guys.
Chick-a-boom with Daddy Doodra.
Yeah, where'd he get the name...
Where'd you get the name for Chick-a-boom?
That was Daddy Doodra.
I'm gonna take a little Chick-a-chick-a-boom-boom by Willie in the Red River Band.
No, it's by Daddy Doodra.
This is another one in 1969.
No.
Well, that was like Daddy Doodra was 70 or 70.
I know, 70.
I'm going to drop to zero.
And we get out to late.
I'm sorry.
Maybe he's right.
Maybe you're right.
Let me ask one more thing.
Whatever happens to lead your lead.
Um...
He's soft for another season.
He's in Iowa.
He went back home.
He's planting corn in Iowa.
Yeah.
Your station in Iowa?
No, I do not.
Yeah, thank you, mate.
Okay. All right.
Now, can I hit Rampus?
No, no, no.
You got two more.
Two more.
Two more.
Okay, I won.
We got to end it with a good phone.
Hello.
Grant.
Yeah.
How you doing?
This is Manny from Kendall, man.
Hey, Manny.
Hey, I called because that guy you told me to go work for a lot
and how you could really kiss me off.
Me too.
No, no.
Drop the nuclear one on him.
Oh.
Great idea.
I'm not better now.
Yeah, me too.
Hey, I want to tell you, even that you guys have overcome,
you guys have done an unbelievable job this week.
Thank you very much.
I'm having a lot of rules over it.
I've been doing great on the phones with the equipment that he has.
I know.
At that station.
We overcome, man.
We overcome.
They have no idea.
You're working on it, though.
These guys are working their butts off of it, right?
Under normal conditions, we overcome, sir.
Yeah, I just wanted to compliment you guys you've been doing great.
And, you know, it's also going to be great to hear Neil get on Monday.
Absolutely.
Thanks a lot.
All right.
Take care.
Bye-bye.

How's it going?
This is AJ.

What's up?
I'm, uh, AJ.
Yeah, I heard that you read my card over the radio.
Sorry if I made him say.
Oh, yeah.
No, we got a big laugh out of it, AJ.
Yeah, I got it right here.
I was just looking at it right before you took it.
I was driving on the Palm Edo and I heard that.
Yeah.
Donned on me that, you know, the bird and Glenn.
Yeah, it gave us a laugh, AJ.
That's right.
That's one of the few we've had.
Yeah.
I'm going to have a radio.
It was a perfect, yeah.
I was, remember I called you.
It was, it's funny how things work out, AJ.
It was the perfect day I needed a laugh today.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I, I, I called, I believe, two days ago.
Remember, and I, uh, parked you off the air.
Absolutely.
I mean, you hung up on me.
Oh, yeah.
Well, don't take it personally.
Yeah.
That's, that's, that's what you told me then.
Yeah, it's been a rough week.
Uh, Rich does this and he's not going to be in this week, though.
Have him mail it out to you next week, okay?
That would be great.
Okay, man.
That would be great.
I'll, I'll put you guys up right next to my radio.
That way I won't forget every morning.
Great.
Great to hear from you, AJ.
All right.
See you later.
All right.
Now can we play make me smile by Chicago now?
Can we play it?
Get your ramp.
Shit.
Get your ramp.
I don't believe it.
Aren't you relieved that now it's over?
Do I take any more hundreds of calls before we go?
Only if you want to do after ten.
This is WZTA.
Now do we have to wait for this to run down?
Oh, that's where we can hit the record.
Yeah, we can hit it now.
Okay.
Why isn't it, uh, this has been, uh,
I've never been through a radio show like it.
Nothing worked.
No way, right now.
It's a whole place.
Not one thing has worked this day.
No, it's not cycling.
Oh my god.
That's what I think I'm going to do when I get home.
A little cycling.
I'm going to go suck my head personally.
Nine, eight, seven, six.
What is this?
New years?
We got to do something else while, uh.
Okay, we're out of delay kids.
Okay.
So now we wait long enough boys and girls.
We may hear a record come on.
But I wouldn't go to the bank on it.
Well, we can't play make me smoke because it won't play.
How about the next one?
What would just put in a different place?
Yeah, please.
You're never going to get off the air today.
See you guys tomorrow.
I'm leaving.
You guys can stay here with Captain Dave and Johnny Dark and Gonzer and everything.
But I'm going home.
It's been a long time.
Just wonderful.
It's 10-03.
