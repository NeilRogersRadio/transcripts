I don't think this was a long enough cut, you know, it's 605.
No, I would have been 604, yeah, you're right.
605.
So I think you should have picked a longer cut.
Yeah, probably five minutes.
Like maybe in a gun of David.
Yeah, that would have been a good one.
Yeah, because then we could still be like opening up the cinnamon rolls and stuff like that.
Anyway, the April Fool could be on us today before this is over.
You know what I'm saying?
I hope not.
The April Fool's on the FCC because the idea is, oh, you had WZTA, Miami Beach, Fort Waterdale,
and the Palm Beach's.
We like the fools.
Don't only have five minutes to get that in.
I think so.
Yeah, you decided the hour.
And I think wow is pretty close.
It all depends on who's watch.
We're getting the time from, okay?
But anyway, here we are.
And it's a wonderful Friday morning.
It's April Fool's Day and we're at my house, which don't ask me why.
Rose Fool, you came running outside the door one day earlier.
Early in the week, it said, you know, you think it would be a great idea to do the show on April Fool's Day.
You know, do something different.
And we'll do it from your house.
And I think the only reason is because he knows he's never going to get invited to the house under any of the circumstances.
So this is the excuse that he's going to use to, you know, come and muscle in and check out the house.
Anyway, we want to thank TJ Cinnamon's for, I just can't believe it.
If you could see in the kitchen, how much of this there is.
Really?
You would just freak out.
Look at that weather, man.
Yeah.
What is his story anyway?
By the way, we're going to watch TV.
No, seriously, remember when the Pope was here last year?
Oh, yeah.
And I did a little play by play off the TV.
Right.
So we're going to watch the morning.
We might just watch the morning show on CBS because nobody else is.
Right.
And probably in the whole county.
And there may be one or two in date who think that it's a foreign language station or something like that.
But yeah, he is an interesting looking weather guy.
In fact, it looks like he could use Willard Scott's hairpin.
And he's a...
But isn't that amazing?
They got a token white guy, Charlie Oswood, is out of this morning.
Is that incredible or what?
How does that feel to be the token white on the news show?
Well, see that means...
Honestly, that Jesse Jackson is doing pretty good.
They figured that, you know, maybe they're going to move more in that direction.
Anyway, it's... what is it?
It's about 607.
We have no law.
And therefore we have no concept of what's going on over there.
We're kind of like everybody else in South Florida now.
We have no clue.
You don't know if there was an O5 break.
I haven't got any idea.
No idea.
We have nothing.
We have food though.
I did that.
I get you coffee.
Did I get you to talk to the coffee?
We have food.
I have a newspaper.
We have the heralds.
So we can steal all kinds of good stuff out of that.
We don't have USA today yet.
So if there's anybody on their way over here...
Like Dennis Folk, like Rose Folk, you might pick one up.
Because when I went out to get the papers, I still yesterday's paper.
So maybe you wouldn't want to read yesterday's stuff.
And I'm sure he's listening to see if we're on the air.
Do you think so?
Now are we on the air by the way?
Well, see now.
I told you about that.
Because I don't really care.
That's true.
That famous Daningroom April Fool's joke story, which is a legendary radio story.
Would you have never heard one time on April Fool's Day at WABC, New York, WABC.
They had Daningroom do a remote on April Fool's Day.
And he did this entire show.
He did a four hour show.
And never was on the air.
That was the April Fool's joke.
There are people in this market who do shows like that almost every day.
Speaking of that.
Yeah.
Right off the screen.
Are you going to do radio highlights?
Oh, no.
You're going to congratulate somebody got married for the 11th time.
I'm going to read this out of the Miami Herald.
This is page 1B.
I'm going to read it as they wrote it because I liked the way it's in the hero.
You know, it's got to be true.
It's this Roy-ish hoist column.
I S H O Y.
You know Roy?
One of my favorite.
I love this show.
Roy says congratulations to Gloves 94 disc jockey Greg Budell, who popped the question last
night to traffic recorder Joanne Rice and immediately eloped.
We're told.
It's Voodell's 11th marriage and her first.
You're laughing, but you know something that could be true.
You said fourth, but he's had something like that.
No, seriously, two days.
Yeah.
May have several of those.
I think I missed a couple of hours.
I think I missed a few.
One I heard lasted about 25 minutes.
It could be as well.
And just, you know, she just got screaming and ran out of the moco room.
I laughed, but it might be right.
She laughed too.
That was the problem.
Yeah, well, this house has got an echo.
I like this reason.
I don't know.
I mean, this is a nice house.
You'll admit them.
Oh, yeah.
A lot here in the lake and it's a nice view.
But it's not the Taj Mahal.
And I don't really.
I'm confused.
I just don't know what it is that they want.
You know what I mean?
I like that.
It is kind of Taj Mahal.
Now, we do have one thing we know because we have no ability to play.
We're not going to play any music today because we don't.
We're just out of touch.
How about commercials?
Probably we won't play any of those either.
Okay, but that's not unusual.
When you work for this company, that's not unusual.
But anyway, no, actually we could play like CDs.
Oh, and I see any player and hold the by expensive.
Folks speakers back there and they probably crank those up.
Like up the whole goddamn neighborhood.
Right.
But anyway, so we're like just sitting here hanging out.
And I think the April fool was definitely on us.
Now we can take calls.
They tell us they're going to try to tell us.
We are a crack engineers have been out here.
They were working feverishly two hours here yesterday.
And they came here in four or fifth.
And they've been working feverishly ever since.
So it's fever in the morning.
And Peter Bolder all night.
No, we don't know the numbers, but you people have to know that.
I think I do.
I think it's 620 3600 and day and 7779 3600 and Broward.
But I will confess you're not there.
I'll put you in a couple of minutes ago that they have a number of kind of eluded me.
Seriously, the day number kind of had escaped me for a moment or two.
Yeah.
So anyway, we have a special guest coming by sometime during the show.
I don't know when he's going to show up.
But we will have at least one piece of music.
Casey.
How about Casey?
Is going to stop by here and he can come by the house anytime.
We had a lot of room.
He ever get kicked out again here.
He can come by here anytime you like.
Got all kinds of extra bedrooms.
And speaking of that, some of our friends from Cooper City are going to be stopping by.
Of course, if you missed the end of the show yesterday.
Oh my God.
Everybody is talking about the video.
That was incredible.
Yeah, if you missed the last half hour, you missed the radio.
Classic.
So you turned out that that guy who was pretending to be a coach or an assistant something at the Cooper City, huh?
He turned down to be Paine and the ass junior.
Okay.
Now you know who Paine and the ass senior is.
Yes, very well.
We can't talk about it.
Something just fell off the wall.
By the way, I don't want to get anybody out here, Jim or any upset.
But something just fell off the wall.
I think it was the antenna.
Which is because it sounds better now, doesn't it?
Doesn't it sound better?
Yeah.
Although it doesn't have...
We shouldn't be monitoring off the air anyway.
Should we?
We should be monitoring program.
Right?
Are we in delay?
We don't know.
We don't have any idea what they're doing.
No, I was born on.
No, I was born on.
So it is kind of exciting.
Anyway, it's 11 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 6.
The weather is going to be about 80 today, right?
Yep.
Mostly sunny.
High near 80.
Low near 70.
And it's 72 this morning.
I don't know if you should give the time or not.
Do you think?
Well, let's give it a try.
Let's see what happened.
Okay.
What the hell?
This is Zeta 4.
It's almost 12 past six.
Well, you were right.
It was kind of fun to just wait and see what...
Well, evidently, there's no break.
Now, whoever is on the board, if they open the mic and they talk, we can hear them.
Well, now, okay.
Now, let's mention that.
Okay.
Now Captain Dave is already conspicuous.
That's right.
By his absence, the audience isn't getting nervous about it, though, because they're used to it.
They can come at it anytime.
They're getting used to that.
But he isn't going to be coming in at all.
Right.
And it's a rather bizarre story, because I got this phone call last night.
Well, actually, what happened is it was 11 o'clock and the phone rang the first time.
Okay.
And a female voice on the other end when I answered it said, oh, I must have the wrong number.
And then like a minute later, it rang again and it was Captain Dave.
That doesn't that...
When that happens to you, don't you kind of like put two and two together.
Like somebody is testing the water and he said to me, I didn't wake you up tonight.
So in other words, I guess he assumed that he had somebody else call the first call that Matt would wake me up anyway.
Okay.
So that I'd be awake a minute later.
Oh, that's a good trick.
That's a good trick.
That's pretty good.
So in other words, I can't blame him.
But the bottom line is I was sitting right where you are watching TV watching the hit your...
As a matter of fact, you need to see that a few more times.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's good.
Watching C. Thomas Allis fit and Rutger Howard's face for the 80th time.
Yeah.
And anyway, I'm sitting here watching it and Captain Dave is on there.
And he says, you're not going to believe this and I want you to upset.
But I got a chance to make $20,000.
I wasn't at a grand the other day.
Wasn't that the...
What?
The operative story?
Yeah.
Today the story is he's making 20 grand doing some TV commercial again.
It's possible.
It is.
Well, if this continues like in about another two weeks, you can retire.
Okay.
I mean, it's been nice working with him.
But at this rate, because the next bottle will probably be like a half a million.
I don't think this can be any more next bottle.
You don't?
Look, there's a duck.
There's a duck in the middle.
We have all the wildlife out here.
In fact, even Big Dave will be waking up a little bit.
There's lots of wildlife in my house.
Big Dave is sleeping, though.
Well, I know if he's still asleep, but I did close his door.
Okay.
He's not here because he'll give very grumpy up.
Although he did say he would get up for TJ Cinnamon's.
He didn't realize they'd be coming in and afforded his six.
He'll be up.
He'll be up in an hour.
They brought enough food for the Chinese army.
We're calling him.
It's incredible.
I'll eat that later.
I got an old bone's coffee cup.
I really set it up pretty good for you.
I had to.
Your own bones coffee cup.
I made you a big pot of chocolate and that's coffee,
which nobody in this house drinks coffee.
It's real good.
And I made you in the automatic thing in there,
whatever the hell it is.
And I even made it right, didn't I?
It's excellent.
I mean, it's not like Dennis Folk today.
Nobody makes a cup of coffee like Rose.
But it's great.
But a Rose by any other name.
So anyway, here we are.
And we just haven't got the foggy.
But you notice how we've already killed what?
Let's see.
It's a thing that a theme on Zeta 4.
And can you imagine what the audience is thinking about this at this point?
Like we have no music.
We have no bit.
Well, we certainly are going to play any cards because we don't have any card notes.
We've got it forbidden.
Anybody back there could start fiddling with any cards.
Okay.
That room.
Let me ask you something.
If we're monitoring like something just dawned on.
I don't know.
But seriously, if we're monitoring off program instead of off the year,
are you are you paying?
Are you seeing what I'm saying?
No.
Are we necessarily going to hear the spots?
I'm going to.
We're monitoring off the air.
Joe will have to answer these questions.
I guess maybe he can.
Oh, wait a minute.
How can we be monitoring off the air?
In other words, we're not in delays at what you're telling me?
We're not in delay.
We're not in delay.
So why did I give those phone numbers out?
That was kind of stupid of me.
Wasn't it?
Yeah.
Well, we don't want to give those numbers out because if we aren't in delay,
then the audience will pick up on it immediately.
Right.
And if somebody will call it and say something like that.
And we don't want to do that again because Captain Dave is not here to take credit for it.
Well, it's not necessary.
But we don't really need to take any calls.
You do understand that.
I try to tell Rose that the other day, but he insists that it's something that we desperately want to do.
Okay.
Because the calls are the lifeblood of the show.
So people leave the backbone.
The backbone, man.
As Flipper would say, the backbone of the show.
Maybe Luke Halpin will call it a little later on.
I think that's possible.
Well, I like that friendly attitude.
He had when we called him the last time.
Like, what do you guys want?
Flipper is dead.
Leave me alone.
I know that.
Flipper is dead.
Yeah.
Flipper is very dead.
Well, the original one.
And he did mention that his Flipper was still alive.
Just barely.
He said, but that's another story.
Yeah.
So anyway, we got the hero here this morning and maybe USA Today is on the way.
So we got a show, right?
The horse by the way that you counted in the second race yesterday was scratched.
I told you would not be.
Oh, gosh.
Well, I'm going to say that's better than coming in last.
No, it's better than coming in last.
I told you, you don't see.
You don't pick horses that have numbers like 13 and 17 and 18.
Yeah.
Because they're not going to run very often.
They don't get in.
Well, I'm new at this.
Yeah.
You know, but I'm going to keep trying.
If you are one for one, you picked the horse that was 28 lengths behind the field on Wednesday.
Which I think was very good.
See, I have a lot of expertise and I can still do that.
Yeah, I know.
Knowing nothing and being able to do that was something very special.
So anyway, Casey is going to come by later, which is incredible.
He's actually coming to my house.
There is.
And then Bob and Ted and Alice and whoever those other people are coming by, Bob and Harlan and Michelle.
Okay.
I notice Bob really goes anywhere without Michelle because it's like kind of Linus in the security blanket.
And especially coming to my house.
He will not come here without her.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And a little later on as a special treat and it might be kind of an inspirational thing for the show.
I'm going to push in the video tape that they bring us to the fashion show.
Oh, super.
And the amazing part of it is there are almost no ugly kids that go to that school.
I know we don't want to get started again because paint any as junior will probably be on the phone and the carrying on having apple apoplectic fit or whatever it is.
But there are really incredible looking people in that school.
So maybe what we'll do a little later on is we'll cruise down.
Oh, that's right.
There's nobody in school today.
No, no.
So we'll just have an all come over here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I saw I noticed on driving to work this morning there were some kids that had obviously you know people driving around the road.
So that obviously we're heading home.
Yeah.
Like five and a half.
Just getting in.
Yeah.
You can tell schools out.
You know, a few, few cars that you don't normally see the type on the road at five in the morning.
You know, obviously heading home.
You know, been up all night doing God knows what.
Yeah.
I'm afraid that these kids today boy, me too.
And Alan's out of town.
Yeah.
I tell you this has been funny.
That's why you seem so old.
Why a week for me?
Now, it would be something if it was an apople fool and it turned out that he wasn't out of town.
But listen, Monday, I wasn't I wasn't at work.
What a day to miss.
His last visit.
Yeah.
I miss.
If you would have been there, it would have been a firework.
So it would have been like the fourth of July.
You would still be talking about it probably.
And today he's out of town.
So this has been a lunch.
I think he is.
Now he said he was going out of town down a cruise.
So this may perhaps, what do you like to be?
Now wait a minute.
Talk about being a captive audience.
How would you like to be on a cruise ship?
Oh, God.
Like out of the middle of the Atlantic.
Holy Toledo.
Because the one good thing about that for him is that you can't get away.
No way to, like Martha in the Vandela's would say there's nowhere to run.
No way to hide.
You know what I mean?
No way to go.
Well, I have this feeling that next week there's no school next week.
I have a feeling there's going to be a visit and that's going to be interesting.
That's going to be a lot of visits next week because it kids are on a school.
We'll see.
Although we don't want to get certain people on the air offset who we don't even talk about anymore.
It was really relaxing here.
You know, all yesterday afternoon with my radio in the off position.
Really very relaxing.
I don't think you miss much.
No.
I have a feeling.
So we want to try this again.
It's almost 20 a.m.
Do what we'll do periodically throughout the morning.
See what happens is we'll just say like you know we're going to give a time check
and if there are spots that you want to play back there go ahead and if not we'll just
play.
We'll just keep rambling on because we can go on here for an eternity.
I mean there's no ending to the ES that we're in loading.
Oh no problem.
And the Gonser now the you may point at this before we came on the air which I think is a very interesting observation.
Gonser and he's bringing his wife to by the way because I guess they heard that possibilities
will bring a lunch in his free food here today and probably his kid.
Oh really?
Probably.
Wouldn't you think?
Are you cereal?
Well I don't know but if he's bringing his wife what about the day?
And then the lead gelato will be here from three to seven.
So you know the idea that this is such a piece of cake for me because it's like stand at home
and you don't have to drive a whole 20 minutes in each direction.
Right.
Instead of my day ending at like 10 past 10.
It's going to end at 10 a past seven.
It's going to wind up.
I got up at four.
Yeah.
Let's see four and four is 12 a 50 hour day.
Well listen I'm going to run over to Johnny Darks later on.
So if you want to come along.
Yeah.
You're not joking about that either.
That's the frightening part.
I'm not.
I saw it.
Do we want to give his address on the air?
I mean that's been basically done to me.
No.
You sure that?
No.
Let's not.
Like the street address with a number and phone number zip code.
Anyway let me try this break thing.
Okay.
See what happens.
Okay.
Whatever you like.
Okay.
I couldn't care less because I'm going to start eating breakfast.
Good.
Well let's see if we can.
If you do respawn.
No seriously.
If you do get in touch with Sherry Hall make sure you don't eat on the phone while you're talking to her.
Oh seriously she would get very testing upset about that.
I'm like that.
That's true.
So anyway we're back and that went pretty smoothly right?
What?
Yeah.
Smooth.
Yeah.
That's the word I was thinking.
Of course we don't know if there's any live spots or any other.
No they're better not be because I would have to like make them up.
Yeah.
Well you could do that.
You could do that.
You're making up the show.
You're like tropical with caulder.
Yeah.
We can go.
I think I could probably do that.
Yeah.
We got the entries right here.
In fact I'm going to look at them again and see if any.
A little later on.
Yeah.
A little later I'm going to look at them.
When a plunger is starting getting up by 8 o'clock.
So anyway it's 624.
Almost 625 on Zeta and I can just imagine that our regular audience listening to this is thinking,
boy they're right this isn't April Fool.
Don't you feel like an April Fool?
Yes I do.
Exactly.
Completely.
But you really look comfortable I will say that.
I am kind of my feet up and this couch is this is a lot more comfortable than listen.
I hear Tweety.
And this is a lot more comfortable than the studio.
Yeah.
Because I put my feet up.
That is a point.
In fact I'm going to take my shoes off.
Yeah.
I may put my swimming my shorts on.
No please.
Don't put your feet away.
All right you got your shoes off.
Oh.
By the way things get boring.
You notice that's an old man the way that I think is my god.
Oh my god we can call those.
People don't have to call us.
We can call out.
Yeah we'll call out because I've got some great numbers in there.
In fact there's Peter Voldier.
We can call her.
Oh no I guess I better not give this whole number on here.
Now how about if I just give certain numbers?
We could talk.
We could have a nice conversation with Michelle.
She could probably tell us maybe some interesting things.
Oh that Michelle.
Peter Voldier.
Yeah this is Voldier.
She probably could tell us some really important things.
That's another story for another day right?
Now who is this chick that's on the news now?
I have no idea.
I can't believe it man.
It's like is this the black network?
This is the area.
Seriously there are no white people on this thing here.
I only got one.
You know one of my guys.
Charlie Osgood but he was just there for briefly.
He was just he had two limericks, two little lines of poetry.
Now look at that.
There's a story from your favorite city from Sarasota.
Those of you who I want to save a lot of electricity.
No seriously this is a good idea because your TV set is one of your high next year air conditioning.
I could be wrong.
But I think that next year air conditioning your TV set is the highest drag.
If I can say that on your electric bill.
You don't think so?
No.
Unless you got a full pump like I do and it's running constantly.
TV doesn't use that much doesn't?
Color TV are you out of your mind?
I didn't know.
Oh yeah.
I didn't know that.
Now your radio use is almost nothing.
Right.
Which is why it's good to keep it on like 24 hours a day.
Even when you're sleeping.
Keep it on.
And then just remember that you had it on Zeta 4 and write it down as they say.
Write it down.
So anyway you don't have to watch your TV you can keep it off.
And we'll just do a little play by play.
In fact maybe we'll flip around the channels.
For those of you who've got a American cable and are really p.o.d about it.
We'll just flip around and we'll see the by the way.
Now channel 5 up in the Palm Beach not too good.
We don't get that in date.
Oh really?
We don't get 5.
Let's back it up.
Okay.
In fact this could probably kill the next half hour.
Now it's just sunshine sports network.
Look at that.
Speaking now look at this ratty thing that just walked in the door.
It's Dennis Folger.
If we really ready.
If we can not even with our paycheck not a log.
What's that?
No USA today no log.
No nothing.
Nothing empty handed.
You think you're getting breakfast you're out of your mind.
Why are you here?
Like walking around like he's got what?
Don't sweat it.
Don't start picking on them.
They've been working their butts off.
Okay.
Just stoke the panic.
So anyway, forget that he's here.
Okay.
Okay.
Because he just here to play book plus.
Okay.
Now channel two with a nice sunset there isn't that peaceful?
Now I like this channel.
This is mellow.
Yeah.
And it just stays there I think like for a very.
It's like here for a very long time.
You sit and watch this.
Well, that's the sun.
Oh, that's the sun.
Whatever.
I would think it would just stay and this the sun got higher in this guide than you have midday sun.
This is a good.
Yeah.
We don't have this on my cable.
That's what the suits watch.
This is the sun channel.
Well, this is channel two.
This is WPBT.
That's a good service.
You just to sunrise.
Yeah.
That's the sunrise over the Atlantic.
Okay.
Now there's HBO.
Look at that.
They're running Kermit the frog.
Yeah.
And then we get to a channel four with this black morning news show that we got running news.
Yeah.
You're going to be amazed.
But channel five.
Now I want you to I'll let that run for a while because you don't ordinarily get that in the county.
That's.
Can I take a look at that desperate log that you've got there?
I don't know.
He's reading the log.
Okay.
I can't believe it.
It's like he's doing a show.
The man is just out of his mind.
You don't like the picture quality to have here with not channel five is not coming into the net.
Really not there's no excuse for that because I think I could be wrong.
But I think here in plantation we're not like all that far from West Palm Beach.
Could I be right not that bad?
Huh?
No, you're not that bad if you're in Broward County.
Oh, like look at this.
Okay.
We do have another break this hour.
Well, you have a log now.
Yeah.
It's reversed.
It's not.
What do you want?
It's reversed.
What who munged on this?
You munged on my log.
He just walked in the door and he's munged on my log.
Oh, I see.
Well, we're not at seven.
Oh, in other words, the pages are like backward.
Yeah, you can handle that.
That's no problem.
We're used to that.
We work with backward people every day.
Look at that.
Now, wasn't I psychic tropical?
It's called her is on here live.
I don't think we have any problem about that.
And sheels is on here, which I think will have no problem with.
You can act basically be it.
Right?
I don't you think that guns are really good.
I'm going to have a swell time here today.
I don't know what they're going to do, but I haven't got the foggy.
So they're going to like the reverb.
They're going to like the reverb in the house.
Yeah, they have no question about that.
In fact, that could be one of the things we'll take a poll on a little bit later on.
If we ever take any calls, you're not likely.
But how did you like the reverb in my house?
Because I get bitched at like crazy all the time.
Big day, I like that echo.
He'll get you.
He says like living in a cavern.
He'll adjust.
I said, well, why don't you try it?
Why don't you go out like the West Virginia?
They have those crawls, bad caverns.
Is that what they got up there?
They do.
And go live in one of those for a while and see which one you like better.
But Rose is here and looking just absolutely gruesome this morning.
You can't believe it, doesn't he?
Well, it's a wild man.
You know, I have this affinity for anyone who wears alcoholic beverages on their body in a signs about.
He has a Bud Light Spuds McKinley T-shirt.
I mean, this man is redefining fashion.
Okay, now here's the worst one of the worst six channels on everybody's cable system.
Unless you live in Homestead.
Mine's Crystal Clear.
Well, yeah, because I was a boy in South Bay.
And I look at how Channel 6, even on the cable, comes in and look at all the video noise.
Yeah, look at that.
Oh, no, it's incredible.
Of course, you know, when you're watching cartoon, it's very distracting.
Seriously, to have all that noise across there.
Because you know what, the streamer is a banana.
But anyway, the stuff here from TJ Sentiments is incredible and postable.
Let me just catering lunch.
So for those people who get all upset when we eat on the air, I'm, you know, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I was going to say I'm sorry.
I'm not in the least bit sorry.
That's your problem, okay?
Yeah.
But we're going to eat quietly.
Yeah, if you notice I ate the first world, very good.
We didn't even know.
You never even made a peat.
But we don't have the noignments.
The second one will be a little bit louder though.
But we don't have those noignments that pick up every single sound of anything, you know.
We have more like, what are these mics?
I don't even know if they are.
Why should you take the cozy off and take a look at it?
I don't have any electric voice.
Oh yeah.
It's like the old A and D.
Cheap yeah.
Yeah.
No, well, that's what we used to use on A and electric voice.
Six thirty one.
Yeah.
In case you'll be here any minute.
Well, he's going to be here early.
No, I'll probably be here by 9.45.
You're thinking he'd get some of that.
No, well, he could be coming home.
Yeah, out of your mind.
Yeah.
So anyway, how do I eat this with one hand and hold the microphone with you?
You're doing all right.
You're very difficult.
You'll work it out.
So anyway, getting back to a Captain Dave, we never really quite finished off that story, didn't we?
Oh, before, okay.
Then we'll go through the rest of the cable.
Mm-hmm.
No, wait a minute.
Instead of leaving it on six.
Yeah.
Go to seven.
I'll push you to head to seven because that comes in very well.
Yeah.
That way you can see Sally Fitz, like just crystal clear.
Mm-hmm.
And Peter Ford.
There's channel seven.
That's the today's show, I guess, with Bryant and Jane and Willard.
And that doesn't start this early, doesn't it?
Seven.
Yeah, starts this early.
Well, I hate to break the news to you.
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm sorry.
That's his channel.
Are you already in a seven o'clock?
I guess I'm wishing.
This is channel seven's local news.
This is very mellow, though, you know.
I can't imagine that anybody in their right mind is listening to it, but it is very mellow.
We're happy.
Yeah.
If anybody is listening this morning, just call and flash the lines.
Okay, and then they can let us know back at the station if anybody's calling.
Wouldn't be something if nobody did.
Mm-hmm.
Seriously.
Six to all of 3600 and Dave and seven, seven, nine, 3600 and brow.
Don't panic because we're not going to talk to you.
Just want to know.
Because I don't think we can if we want to anyway.
Do you?
I don't know.
I have no idea.
There's Michael Williams.
Now he's squinted a lot.
Yeah.
He could be the replacement for me, Sean, on channel 10.
Oh, great.
Yeah.
Because he's kind of like thin.
He's a good looking guy, but he's thin.
Got a real thin face.
And if they put a couple of long earrings.
Yeah.
That's what just when I was thinking.
And he squints like crazy.
And look at that.
There's chief Dixon.
Look in just like just like Rose Folger almost.
Look at that.
With that dumb cap on.
You know, would he see?
Does he have moron written all over his face or what?
You know, we get so excited whenever he makes an appearance on Zeta 4.
It's like we're honored that chief Dixon, you know.
Just his name mentioned.
It's just I like the fact that he's got such a good sense of humor too.
I missed the cowboy hat though.
What is her name?
Gloria Schwartz?
No, I can't remember her name.
She does the new news on seven.
Julie Feldman.
Julie Feldman.
Well, I said Gloria Schwartz.
It was basically.
And her sister Rose Liches.
Now, do you hear the way the birds are going?
That's not a huge point.
No, that's not.
Tweetie is in the big Dave's room.
Oh, these are more birds.
In fact, if the audience listens very closely, that's going to be probably.
We'll just leave that on.
We'll let it go for about like 20 minutes.
And we'll just hear the sound of the birds.
Don't you think that would be interesting?
That could be part of a new format on this station.
I like it.
I like it.
So anyway, Julie is doing her thing.
Her hair is kind of screwed up, you know.
She looks alright.
I like her hair rings.
She looks okay.
She's got it together, basically.
I think.
I think she does.
I think she.
She almost looks like she knows what she's doing.
Yeah.
She almost looks like a guy.
If she took the earrings off, she'd look just like Mark Williams.
Well, see, that's why I like her.
Don't you think so?
Because she looks boyish.
Hey, guys, who was just a...
Goish?
And boys.
No, Julie Feldman does not look boyish.
Okay, it's good boys.
It's I like.
You know, that's my look.
And you did want to wish on your...
Jewish friends a happy Passover, right?
And happy Easter to all our goyems.
Mm-hmm.
Why is Easter this week?
A Sunday.
Is Easter.
Easter's Sunday is this Sunday?
April 3rd.
Yeah.
Wow.
So happy Easter and having Passover and sort of kind of like a holiday weekend, kind of.
Sort of.
Kind of, yeah.
Yeah.
Kind of.
So anyway, if those kids from Cooper City are thinking about coming in early, please.
You know what I mean?
Please what?
Please come in early.
Why?
That there's nothing going on here.
Exactly.
I mean, this is just in front of nothing to talk about.
Well, I have lots of things to talk about.
But we'll save that till when there's somebody awake listening.
It's six.
See, now this is awkward because I got to like 36, 24 till 7 on Zeta 4.
This is the Niharaju show.
And if you're wondering where all those funny bits are that we usually play, in fact, there's a new ACN tape sitting hopefully still in my mailbox.
Hopefully.
Uh-oh.
Now, now, now, now, someone knows where it is.
Well, if the tape isn't still there sealed on Monday morning, what happens?
There's going to be a four hour devastation of a certain day.
I'm stationed in the other end of that building.
That tape is to remain there sealed.
Okay.
Till Monday.
Well, I have a story concerning this and doesn't concern.
Thank you.
It doesn't concern him.
Uh-uh.
Someone told me yesterday that they were at the-
Was it Richard Kray?
Concert?
What was the-
Robert Kray.
Robert Kray.
Concert.
And DJ was there.
And they ran into DJ at the concert, which is Don Jr.
And they met him.
And after they met him, the guy said to me, he said, I have met Don Johnson.
This guy was more obnoxious than Don Johnson.
More ego, which is saying along with a bigger head and a bigger mouth.
Yeah.
That an incredible story.
Don Jr. was more obnoxious than Don Johnson.
Yeah.
Now I think we know why he's done, Jr.
That is an incredible story.
It was incredible.
And it killed about 30 seconds ago.
Sorry.
It wasn't going to work.
You're moving along.
Your favorite channel, of course, in mine, I spent hours a day watching what's channel eight of my system.
The weather channel.
Oh, my favorite.
Can you leave that on for a while?
Yeah.
We get the current temperature that way.
We can basically-
What we can do is we can give the temperatures for all other parts of the country.
And we'll probably do a couple of minutes on how the weather is in upstate New York.
And then Detroit.
Just for you.
Uh-huh.
There's the weather it done in bombs and brightened the whole world.
Oh, right.
And it loses finally, Delhi and Detroit.
It's hazy.
Well, you know, I think they give Alaska weather on this channel.
Oh, do they?
I think so.
I also think they give weather for Iceland.
Look at that.
It's time for the oyster harbor.
If you think we're desperate for material, just look at the weather channel.
Okay.
The oyster harvests like in Portland, man.
They don't like that term oysters up in Portland, though.
Okay.
Fold it.
I think the way it is the wake enough report mountain road in the cold.
I wonder how many people in the audience really watch the weather.
I think people do watch it.
Do you?
I think it quick, you know, short bursts periods because no delays, by the way, at the
down there for LAX.
Yeah, but there's a 43 minute delay in St. Louis, but who the hell wants to go to St. Louis anyway, right?
No delay in Denver.
And there's no delay in Detroit.
Look at this.
Which of the taxes had the wettest march on record?
5.24 inches in Wichita, Texas.
And Omaha, by the way, had the second driest march on record, 700ths of an inch.
Let's see, it's great when you got your TV set and you can rip that's what's great about cable.
Man, you've got everything.
Don't you?
Yeah.
Yeah, just a little bit of everything.
It's 6.39 on Zeta 4 in the right of your show.
And at my house, this is, this is an April fool on us.
We're like sitting here.
We're like laying back on the sofa and just relaxing and God forbid that anybody should be listening to this again.
Seriously, could anybody be desperate enough to be listening to us sitting in my living room BS?
We're watching TV without the meal.
Now we would sound down.
Now, Neil, we've been wanting to do this for a while.
Yeah.
Want to go through the cable.
Something I've always dreamed of.
Yeah.
And then of course we get to ESPN.
They're probably doing Olympic nose picking on ESPN of this hour tomorrow.
Dractor pull, I hope.
They do get into some pretty desperate stuff in the morning.
They do business, don't they?
I think they do business on ESPN.
I think so.
See, you don't know this because you're at work.
See, they do business.
Well, see, nation's business today.
They do business.
They're in the morning drive.
In other words, if they're guys who hit on a game's last night and have, oh, seriously, if they're guys who hit on a game's last night and have money to invest, then this part of the ESPN is for them, right?
Right.
And there's not many.
Yeah.
Not a lot of them.
And then they should have like some of the religious preachers on their round noon time before they end up having like volleyball and stuff.
Oh, at noon they do exercises.
I know.
Now what the hell is this?
Well, fashion is this the C and fashion show?
This is ESPN.
Oh ESPN.
Well, the same.
The national business.
Okay.
Well, let's move right along.
Oh, look at that.
Oh, my God.
Probably we can catch Donahue.
You ordinarily are on the air in the station at 9 o'clock, but we can do a blow by blow.
So to speak on the Donahue show.
There's Walt Cronice.
Look at that bow tie.
Yeah, because you got a bow tie.
He and Paul Simon, by the way, are going to run his one ticket.
That would be great.
Finally, we're going to get the current temperature.
And of course, Walter is going to give us the thumbs up sign if he can ever get his thumb, you know, quite quieted down long enough to put in one direction.
That's a windy this morning.
Yeah.
And the barometer, by the way, is rising at 30.08 inches.
The humidity is 66 percent.
And the winds are out of the east at 16.
72 this morning, just like I said.
72 in Miami, 72 in the beach.
Fort Lauderdale is missing and Kendall doesn't want to report.
Okay.
And I can't say that I'm.
This is good.
This is just like when the Pope was here last summer.
That's right.
Just do a little play by play right off the TV.
We look at that Walter's thumb is shaking in all directions now.
What is his story, but we do know him?
No, I don't know anybody know him.
He's one of the unfriendliest people I've ever seen in my life.
He was up at the top of no park two years ago.
When we were all up there in the clubhouse that they were sucking up free food and stuff.
I mean, people that wouldn't know horses front from a horse's ass.
Okay.
And he was up there with him.
And boy, he's a strange guy.
You know, I don't know anyone in the business who knows him.
No, I don't know.
He's one of these people that nobody knows him.
Ricky Shaw.
Yeah.
Because doesn't he do the weather on that station?
Mm-hmm.
He does do the weather on that station.
Yeah.
So he's probably got Waxi build up.
Can't hear you.
That's why he doesn't respond when you speak to him.
But he just he shakes a lot.
But I do like the bowtides.
It's really nice.
I like what he does with his hands.
You notice he's always like fidget.
Look at that.
Did you see the right one there?
Yeah.
And look what he just did with the two.
I can't look.
He federal off prohibits us from repeating on the air.
But Walter just did.
Oh, Walter, please.
Look at that.
She's about ready to uphook her guts.
I don't know her.
Now who the hell is she?
She got her green card.
I don't know.
Who is she?
Is that?
One thing about these early morning newscasts, man, they've got some of the most bizarre, like
a Julie Feldman that we were watching on seven and Gloria Lipschitz on four or whatever her
name is.
They've got some really weird people.
Who is that woman?
I have no idea.
Local anchor.
I have no idea if she is.
It looks like she's doing the news from the Indian Reservation or something, doesn't it?
Speaking of the Indian Reservation or is that big story about the Bingo Hall?
Yeah, we can do that on the news.
Oh, are we doing the news?
If you want.
We have no intro or anything.
That's okay.
643, huh?
They can run behind you.
You can run.
Now let's not do it.
No, because it's in your studio.
That's in your studio.
Yeah, it's in our studio here.
And we don't want them going in over there.
Oh, well, it's locked.
Why should today?
Is they say every other Passover?
Why should the day be any different from any other day?
Mane Shana Hala Hala.
See, they can't get it.
They can't get the card.
They can't get in your studio.
Yes, they can.
It's open.
It's perpetually open.
So the lock was just a ruse.
Who's on the board?
John Ford is on the board.
John Ford is on the board.
Now, John, I will say again, you can talk to us if there's anything we need to know.
Yeah, what's going on, John?
You can open the mic and speak.
Now, when we give the numbers out before.
See?
I'm right here.
See?
John, when we gave those numbers out before, now, did they line the flash?
They were completely like flashing.
They're talking to me in the two-way.
Can you hear that?
Yeah.
Yeah, this is like exciting.
It's like, you sound so awake, John.
I need coffee, man.
Oh, John sounds like he's got that corporate disease.
Doesn't he?
Did you hear that when he was...
Yeah.
Now, listen, don't stand directly under that event in our little studio, man, because the ass bestos.
Yeah, your studio is open, by the way.
Oh, well, you want to go get your mama?
I'll get anything you want.
It get your mama.
It's on the...
No, don't get your mama.
Just get the card.
Yeah, I'll be going to get my mama.
You know where it is?
I'll find it.
Well, I'll leave right now.
I'll go to Hollywood and get my mama.
It's up, bring her back here.
It's up, bring her back here.
Yeah, she'll probably have some pretty spicy stuff to say today.
I have some questions, Dan.
Oh, that you do.
But we'll do that another day.
Good.
Like, do I really hate her and all that good stuff?
Would you like the sports section, Dennis?
No.
Okay.
What are you offering him, my paper?
It's my 25 cents that I went out and bought this one.
I was going through it like he was looking at something.
Like he knew what was going on.
There's the guy that's in the face.
They all look the same.
Don't they?
He looks like Michael Williams.
No, seven.
But this is Channel 10.
It looks like Michael Williams.
I bet you it's his twin brother.
Maybe, but wait a minute.
What the hell is this?
Bogus Coach, wait till you see this.
You're going to bring out.
Oh!
Bogus Coach, and here's one of those old pictures of me
where it looks like my head is screwed on my...
Like Lee Harvey Oswald.
Yeah, it is.
With the phony head on the neck.
And it says Neil Rogers, talk to you a host.
Spars regularly with Cooper City student Alan Dresner.
Now, he spars regularly.
Don't I wish that Alan is spard regularly.
What are you talking about?
So Alan's not even a year and he's getting all this big publicity.
It says, Bogus Coach spouts threats against student caller to show.
And this is by Marty Rosen.
If you live in Broward, you got the story.
If you live in Dade, forget it.
Because you're lost anyway.
Yeah.
This is on page 2BR.
Broward.
It's second page of the Broward section.
And it says by Marty Rosen.
Nice, good-ish, a name there.
Marty says, high school student Alan Dresner,
home on spring break, was listening to his favorite radio talk show Thursday morning
when a caller threatened to have the 17-year-old suspended
because of his regular cause to the show.
Wow.
I didn't know that Alan was involved in all that.
Yesterday, weren't we told that he was in the Bahamas?
He wasn't involved.
I mean...
But the whole story is about him.
God.
Anyway, moving along, it says, Dresner knew just what to do.
I...
I wonder how is that on my phone?
That's what I've always wanted to hear was the sound of a phone ringing on my show.
Anyway, Dresner knew just what to do.
I freaked out.
I started dialing fast to the Cooper City High School senior,
who has gained notoriety among his classmates for his daily calls to acid-tongued talk shows,
Neil Rogers on radio station, Wista, 94.9 FM.
Dresner often is the butt of Rogers' jokes,
but he wasn't laughing Thursday,
nor were dozens of outraged listeners who flooded the switchboard at Cooper City High
with complaints as the prankster escalated his threats against Rogers' fans at the school.
Hello.
Who was that?
Yeah, with pepperoni and cheese, please.
Is anybody we knew?
The caller who apparently listened to Rogers' daily insults and verbal volleys with the teen
called on the era second time, identifying himself as Coach Conway at Cooper City High
promised to suspend any Cooper City student who called the morning show.
There is no Coach Conway at the school Cooper City High official said.
Dresner tried to get through.
The coach got through three times, and I couldn't get through it all.
He said, well, see Alan the problem is the coach wasn't calling on the talk line.
It was calling on the business line.
That's correct.
And we put him through on the extension.
But Alan doesn't understand what extension means.
Dresner, oh, let's see, on the third call the prankster promised to suspend any student who even listened to Rogers'
controversial show.
The guy was screaming and yelling that Neil was promoting homosexuality and communism.
I couldn't believe it said listener Katie Dela Cruz, 22 of Miami.
She drove to work and called the high school fuller complain.
Rogers boss, program director Dennis Folger, wouldn't comment on the incident.
Rogers did not return calls from the hero.
How the hell am I going to return calls from the hero.
I love the way they do that.
In other words, I never got any message.
What just happened?
Now it sounds like we're on the air.
It's like real clear.
Got real clear.
What just happened?
All of a sudden it sounds really good.
There was like a half a second of dead air.
And then it got real.
Oh, now we're switched to pro.
Hello.
We had a call.
I mean, pouring in here, aren't they?
This is more calls in some kind of.
This is more calls in joy gets in a month, isn't it?
That's our third call.
Anyway, unsuspecting Cooper City high administrator Gina Farazo was helping with the switchboard
when the first calls came in.
We had business people calling.
We had parents calling.
We had lawyers calling, she said some Warren school officials about on air hijinks.
Others complain believing that the school really would suspend students who listen to the show.
Sure.
Then it got kind of crazy.
And Mr. Rogers called us.
He wanted to know if anybody on our staff named Conway, she said,
it's nothing we can don't hear.
It's strictly kid stuff.
What does that mean at last line?
It's nothing we can don't hear.
It's strictly kid stuff.
This called the wrong, I guess.
Is that what that means?
That's all incident.
So out of that came a major story in the private section of the Harold.
Good.
Which gives you a pretty good idea of how exciting this town is these days, right?
Talk about the door days.
We don't have any pens.
Okay, we don't know.
We don't have any pens.
My pen disappeared.
I know what happened to us.
Sorry, you're asking.
So you're going to have to, that's it.
Rose, go on and do something useful.
Get a pen.
Would you please?
So anyway, it's that time.
I wonder if John has your mama.
John, do you have your mama?
You have your mama.
You have your mama.
You know what?
It's about, what the hell is it?
Anyway, it's five minutes before 7655 and Zeta 4.
And slowly but surely we're getting our act together.
Now Captain Dave is not here today.
He's off making two million bucks doing a spot somewhere.
I was supposed to believe that.
And the bird is wandering around.
This is good.
This is just like sitting at home and not even doing anything.
Now I've got a number here that we're going to give out.
And if there's anybody that wants to call in to my house,
it's really like just like calling me at home.
Okay, only tomorrow or like a three in the morning.
Now look at this.
There's somebody out there with a gas motor.
Okay.
In our lake.
Call the police right now.
Because I think, I could be wrong, but I think you can only have electric motors in this lake.
And that's the second one I've seen in two days where they're polluting our lake with gas.
And you know what's going to happen?
All the wildlife in our lake is going to die.
Right?
So I think we better call Woods, you the owl.
One of those environmental types.
In fact, it looked like Woods, you the owl was kind of hanging out here a little bit on the good.
And tell them that something elicit is going on.
But anyway, if you call my house at three in the morning, this number will not ring.
It will.
No, in fact, this is probably a number that will like disappear after this show today.
9-8-1-4-7-7-2.
Is that a powered number?
Hollywood number.
So that means like if you live in North-Dade, you can probably call it.
And if you live in Broward, up to probably about Pompano.
Look at that man, I like that ring.
I love it.
But this is like, this is like Art Lake Letters house party.
It is.
Hello.
Thank you, Dad.
How you doing?
Well, this is exciting, isn't it?
You're my first caller at the house.
Well, I mean, at least on this phone.
Well, I was smart enough to be right by the phone when you gave up the number.
Roy, you were just hanging there like with your thumb out, right?
Or something?
I was going through my cable the same time we went through your cable.
Were you live?
I live in my beach.
Oh, my beach?
So you don't have American cable, all right?
No, but he was two, four, six, and seven, and three.
And look at that.
There's burt rattles with his own body.
I can't believe it.
And boy, does he look pretty gruesome, doesn't he?
Now, this is channel 12.
Wow, you also don't get down.
Now, you don't get 12.
Do you have the beach?
What station is that?
That is the Pomp beach.
That is the Pomp beach.
I can't tell Pompano beach now.
Now, what was 11?
We missed what was channel 11?
Oh, well, you were busy while we were doing channel 11.
That was a TBS in Atlanta, which is a really grainy, crappy picture, by the way.
Well, the cable we have on the beach, I don't know who it is, but we don't get as many channels as you guys get.
Really?
Yeah, we get a million of them.
Now, there's Mr. Food on channel 10 with his Kiwi Fruit.
And look at that.
And there's Brian Orchard just came in to do the other two.
I can't believe it at the same time.
I see that.
Yeah.
Look at that.
There's Brian.
He's messing around with the Kiwi.
That Brian.
And I just kept the day's mushrooms.
I can't believe it.
Boy, he were here today, huh?
He chimped at 50 grand at our time.
We don't get the weather channel.
Are you serious?
I'm a chick.
That's required on any cables.
We don't get, I even know what our cable is.
Look at the lady on channel 10, okay?
Doesn't it look like you want to ask her if she has a green card?
That's that.
Seriously.
It never gave her an answer.
And look at the water with his thumbs.
Look at that.
Oh, let me tell you something.
Oh, my God.
I know Walter.
Do you?
I used to work where he lived.
Elaine Hume.
Did you see that?
Ricky Tickley's wife.
Is it really?
Do you see that?
His wife?
Elaine.
Wow.
By the way, after the first three of these cinnamon rolls, we're going to get to you, man.
They're great.
So anyway, what were you saying?
Not that we're not distracted or anything, okay?
He used to work where he lived.
He's a nice guy.
Eddie James Olman.
That Eddie, almost man, looks like he got a roadmap on his face.
He's got that James Woods.
Wow.
Man, he's got a zit on his zit.
Now, this is Channel 14.
This is Channel 23.
This is Channel 23, WLTV.
I'm sure you get this one.
You probably get it about three spots on your cable.
What is the ass?
Hey, there's a Mickey, El Mickey Mouse.
El Mickey.
Yeah.
Ostamio, whatever.
Yeah.
And this is coming up to my memeage.
What's that?
That's the one.
Miami Beach Convention.
Exactly.
Isn't this exciting?
It's kind of like we're flipping through our thing together, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Yeah.
So what's going on over there on a beat?
Now, does the show sound as ridiculous on a year as it does to us in the living room here?
Well, it's windy as you know what?
On the beach.
Yes.
Was that a response to my question just now?
Now, let me say it again.
Does the show sound as...
What's the word that I'm looking for as ridiculous to you listening as it does to us in the living room here?
Probably more.
Really?
That's good.
That's the lower the phone because I hear the terrific echo.
Well, that's my house.
I have a lot of reverb in my house.
The guy that lived here before used to work at WABC.
Scott Mewney used to live here just before I lived here.
That's why the reverb is here.
In fact, we found his collection of Beatles songs, man.
All over the house, we got Beatles records.
I feel like Michael Jackson.
You get a VH1 on your table?
Unfortunately, yeah.
He don't.
Well, I like VH1.
No, trust me.
You're not missing anything.
VH1, look at that.
It's Jesus.
I don't get anything else.
You get what?
Hey, by the way, the good news is for those of you within the signal area, I'm going to flip ahead to it now.
Now we'll go back.
MTV is actually coming in like a living room.
It's one of the better channels now up until a few days ago when I bitched them out.
It wasn't coming in hardly at all.
It was just snow.
It looks like I like it.
I don't want to assume that because I carried on and screamed and threatened them with death on the air.
Can I say hello to somebody?
Go right ahead, sir.
Look at that.
It's Michelle Jackson.
Go ahead.
Can I say hello to somebody even though it's against federal law?
Sir, why do you keep repeating yourself?
I don't know.
Go ahead.
I said, go right ahead.
I, Alan.
What?
I know, listen to the show.
What Alan is that?
That's not our Alan in Cooper City.
Oh, this is Alan who, I guess it worked today even though he will probably be leaving work early because of the holiday.
They only listen to every morning.
Because of which holiday?
Now, Passover?
Passover.
Oh, yeah.
Well, that's over on the beach.
That figure's yeah.
But you love it when he crabs his crotch.
Michael Jackson?
No, I really don't to be honest with you because it's because you know there's nothing there to begin with so I even pay any attention, you know.
In fact, we understand that Michael J. Fox sings in his new movie.
He sings, he sings, I'm an old smoothie, which never have two words been spoken.
Well, listen, it's been great here from a year.
Our virgin caller here at my house.
Well, I do.
So if we ever get conned into doing this again, you can call us again.
Okay?
Okay.
Have a great day.
I was in this great, you like punch up one at a time.
Oh, that is good.
It's a WZTA Miami Beachport, Lauderdale and the Palm Beach is 701.
Here comes another call.
One at a time, just like most of the talk shows in this market.
Hello.
Yeah.
How you doing?
Are you doing?
Hey, this really sounds good, you know what?
You sound like you're weighing a time tunnel somewhere.
What do you mean?
On the phone or on the year?
On the phone.
How about a year you sound great?
Is this for real though?
What?
Are you for real at your house?
Is this like a...
This isn't April Fool, but it's on us.
Okay, we're at my house.
We're in the living room.
No, no, no.
How could I be describing what's going on on the TV if we weren't in my living room?
And this article was also really in the...
In the Broward Edition.
Where you come from?
Plantation.
Plantation.
And you ought to rush out and get 20 copies of the hero to look in the Broward section.
Wow, I can't believe this is great.
I just think it's wonderful.
Wait a minute.
What is great?
You broadcasting from the house.
Well, fine.
I'll do it every day.
Okay.
Now that they got it set up, they don't have to come in here at 4.50 in the morning.
It's a little long drive for me.
Yeah.
I have to get up early.
Oh, you got guest room?
No, you can.
They can set it up at your house too.
I would like that.
You know what?
Do you remember, you know, I was thinking about the incident at the zoo, you know,
when Big Dave had to go to the can.
Oh, yeah.
You know that person?
You have to be more than Neil Rogers' roommate to get in here.
Exactly.
I think he said, Big Dave should answer the door when that person comes to the door today.
Okay.
That's a good idea.
And he's telling the ass to be more than a disc jockey to get in the line house.
Yeah.
That's an excellent idea.
Got any more than just a disc jockey to get in an Uncle Neil house.
Slam!
Yeah.
And the door in there.
Good idea.
You're my kind of caller, sure.
That'll be about 9 o'clock.
Yeah.
Maybe we can have it live on the air.
I don't believe it, but I think it's great.
I'll talk to you later.
Thanks a lot.
Yeah.
I like you notice the way I'm operating that with my toe.
Now, do they, it's kind of like having a foot pedal.
Do they call that pedophilia?
Look at that.
Here comes another call on Zeta 4.
It's 703 or something.
Hello.
Well, how come I can't hear you?
Speak up.
Oh.
There you go.
Are you talking to me?
I sure am.
Okay.
What I'd like to know is I am absolutely dying.
Are you out in plantation acres?
Well, let me put it to you this way.
The answer is no, but even if I were,
you think that I would tell you on the air?
Well, can you do it off the air and tell me?
I don't do it off the air, man.
No, it's not the answer.
No, I'm not in plantation acres.
But why do you ask?
Well, the quiz of the way you were describing the wild place out here.
And...
Believe me, you can go to Windixie and see wildlife in plantation.
I'm thinking about creatures with peels and...
Exactly. That's what I mean.
Whoa.
Trust me.
Okay.
Are you following me or did I lose you somewhere?
I...
I think I understand your drift.
Are you in plantation?
Yeah, I'm out in the acres.
My foot, maybe it'd be my neighbor.
Sorry.
Okay.
But when you get up into the big leagues, you can move into my neighborhood, okay?
Well, where is that?
I'll let you know.
Okay.
See you later.
I'll let you know.
Look at that.
There's the doorbell.
The phone is ringing.
The bell...
And great part of it is, I'm sure the big day was still sleeping soundly.
It's a 705 on Zeta 4, your confused station.
Good morning.
Morning here.
How you doing?
Great.
Listen, I hate to...
I do it to you, but I was watered out to you in that trouble yesterday with...
with that jerk was.
You did what?
Wait a minute.
They just delivered USA Today.
Who brought that?
Somebody from USA Today just brought us the paper.
Can you believe that?
That's better than we get at the station.
We don't get to visit this day.
Yeah, that's a better idea.
And of course, they're so far from the station, like right across the street.
Okay, I run out of time again.
Yesterday, I went with Max.
Max, you called you at the end of the show?
Right.
Because of the person who called the day before and said he was a coach and came out and watched a baseball player.
Right.
Why was the water calm?
Said he come out and watch him.
The water is nothing wrong with that.
Well, actually, the truth is, is I'm not really the baseball coach.
I'm his lover, actually.
You're just a terrible person, sir.
Come on.
Cut that out.
I'll enjoy having a nice day.
You too.
Okay.
Now we're going to get coach Junior is going to be calling later on this show.
That was just a joke, by the way, okay?
Because his lover's out of town.
Zeta 4.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
Hey, Dale.
How you doing?
I'm fine.
Boy, that's the echo.
You're like in a cave there.
No, I'm in my house.
I know.
And we have a tremendous echo because I've got these big walls and high ceilings and it's
going to cost a fortune just to air condition this house.
Oh, yeah.
You think so?
Oh, yeah.
No, you know why it's not because I got three separate air conditioners.
Okay.
You didn't realize that one freaks part of the house.
We have no furniture in there, right?
Yes, we do.
Sir, come on.
Cut it out.
You just sit on the floor, right?
No, we're on my sofa, sir.
What do you think I have some kind of a schlepper?
I kind of go like, you know, Kabuki or something like that.
Yeah.
Kabuki?
Kabuki.
Now, if you notice, we have this new phone system that's all set up here and everything and
they should.
And it really does sound good, but they still don't listen to me.
Do you notice that?
Yeah.
You're not thinking you hear the bird?
I hear it.
You hear them?
Yeah.
But they still interested in what you have to say.
I don't understand.
In other words, you don't care what he has to say, right?
Zero.
Zip.
So I've got a question for you now.
Okay.
Do you see what I'm saying?
They won't even answer questions about me.
I don't blame them to be honest with you.
Go ahead.
I couldn't even hear you.
That's okay.
Don't worry about it.
Go ahead.
Ask me again.
Ask you what?
The question you have.
No, the question was, can you hear the bird when he speaks to you over there on the other
mic?
I mean, I can barely hear both of you.
Okay.
Go ahead.
What's your question?
Okay.
You're going to play.
I love it.
Go ahead.
The question is.
Oh, wait a minute.
What just happened?
Oh, okay.
Just take that horrible thing out of our lives here.
Get it out here.
Go ahead.
The question is.
Can you basically recap what happened yesterday on the show?
Okay.
Yes, I can.
Now, what is he doing with his brownie camera in here?
I mean, what a groupie.
Okay.
Now, you know, this Philly's cap and his brownie camera, that Rose Buller.
What a comedian.
But that's Fudge McKenzie.
That's what does it for me.
Yeah.
It did it for me.
In fact, it's a good thing it's close to the John.
Anyway, yesterday, what happened about nine, twenty, I would say is we had, well, first of all,
Bob and Harlan from Cooper City.
Yeah.
We're in the studio.
Okay.
Right.
Behaving very wonderfully.
No problem.
We were sitting there shooting the breeze and everything was great.
All of a sudden we get this message that there's somebody on the business line who wants to talk to us.
The assistant principal of Cooper City High alleged.
Okay.
Right.
And I punch it up and this guy comes on.
He starts carrying on about this disgusting filth we're doing on the air and about this bad image.
We're giving the kids of Cooper City High and I better cease and desist and on and on and on and on and got hysterical and I hung up on him.
And I went through a big song in a dance.
He called back a second time and basically went through the same thing again.
And then he called a third time and we put him on.
He said, anybody who even listens to your show at Cooper City High, we're going to suspend indefinitely.
Okay.
He said, we're taking names and addresses and anybody who listens to the show.
That's how disgusting it is.
We're going to suspend him from school.
Okay.
Now I understand you found out who did it.
Well, no, let me just put it to you this way that it was not somebody who works at Cooper City High because we called just before the end of the show.
And they said there is nobody by that name here and it had nothing to do with us, etc. and so on.
But I do know who yes, I do know who instigated it and I can't go into it on the air.
Okay.
Yeah, I heard you calling into Cooper City and you and explain it every time.
Yeah.
And the same person, the same person who instigated the episodes beyond any question is the person who's been hassling and harassing the hell out of us for almost a year now.
Does that explain it to you?
I can't get any more specific.
Are you been calling and saying in the afternoon, right?
Exactly.
Yeah.
And Rose is holding her head over here.
Let me say it.
Let me say it again.
Crystal clear.
It can't be a coincidence that all the phrases and all the lines were the same ones that we've heard before.
Okay.
It's a covering yourself accordingly.
Why don't you hint strongly so give us more of a clue for those of us who don't know what that's not important.
Okay.
Oh, but I'm losing sleep over.
No, don't lose any sleep.
It's not it's not anybody important enough to lose sleep over.
Okay.
All right.
It's not what's known from AM.
Is it?
No, no, no, no, no.
Nothing like that.
That's about it.
Oh, I see.
You know what I mean?
Well, thanks for the recap there.
And I, gee, I wish I could get the paper and read more about it, but I'm in state County.
So I can't get it.
Well, I'll just drive up to Halendale.
I'll take care of you.
Yeah, right.
That'll kill the day for you.
Okay.
Okay, I'll see you at the diplomat mall.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Okay.
It's 10 past seven on Zeta 4.
Now, how are we going to call Captain Dave?
Are we going to call him?
If we, if I get the line right away.
Okay.
Gee, I got a bend over.
I can't do this.
Let me give you the weather while this is going on.
Mostly sunny today.
High in your 80, low to 90, 70.
It's 72.
I think we had a dial of one first.
Are we in Dave County?
Yes, he is.
Yeah, we're sorry too.
Seven, eleven.
Is that going to work?
Boy, you hear the echo on those beeps.
I love it.
Do you think?
That's the call waiting.
Do you hear it beeping?
Oh, we have call waiting on our lines too.
That's good.
I like that.
How come we never heard it during any of the conversations?
There were other people calling.
Isn't that amazing?
That's incredible.
How come he's not picking up the phone?
Yeah.
What's the matter?
Because we're not paying him to pick up the phone.
Is that it?
Yes, he's working.
Yeah.
He gets paid by the second now.
They start early on these cover.
Okay, well, we'll try him again later.
That pain that he asked Captain Dave.
But we got, this is good.
Okay.
Are we on delay?
Yeah, we're on delay.
Don't worry about it.
John's taking care of all of that back at the station.
Right, John?
He's right on top of it.
See to four.
Hello.
If he's not, it's going to be a hell of a show.
Okay, look at that.
We just got to hang up, too.
This is good.
I like this.
This is getting, see, I don't like all the,
oh my god, the calls are pouring in here.
If you don't like all these butt lickers.
Hello.
This is better.
Yeah.
Good.
This is getting to be just like being in the studio.
Look at that.
Man, here go nuts.
981-4772.
We haven't gotten calls from other radio stations now.
You can be sure of that.
Hello.
Hi.
Taking in the sugar.
Huh?
It's shaking in the sugar.
What's shaking in the sugar?
Isn't that a colorful expression?
Pretty stupid, too, but that's okay.
That's sugar butt.
Can you say that on the radio?
That's about as far as you can go, yeah.
That's it.
I don't know what that's supposed to mean,
but let's not even find out.
So what's going on with you this morning,
other than this acid tongue that you've developed?
Well, I got two kids, both of them are sick.
So I figured I'd get up at 515 and let's see you guys on the radio.
515.
Not 515.
545.
Yeah, and we didn't come on to like 605, right?
Yeah.
I got up 20 minutes too early.
Yeah, but you did enjoy funeral for a friend, don't you?
That was an uplifting song for 6am.
It almost put me back to sleep.
Yeah.
I got to be honest.
Yeah, I have to be honest with you.
I wouldn't be playing at a 6 in the morning.
That's not...
Oh, also wasn't long enough.
Yeah, we probably need a longer cut, too.
But anyway, moving right along.
So the kids have got the bug, huh?
Yeah, they got the bug.
104 degrees and the other ones got asthma.
Wow.
The wiser.
You're going to have a rough weekend.
Yeah.
Nothing life.
Yeah.
Yeah, it'll get better.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah.
This is just part of the growing pains of life.
Listen to those birds out there, aren't they?
They're going nuts.
That's not birds in a cage.
No, the bird in the cage is in the bedroom with the door closed.
Sleeping with big Dave, yeah.
He'll be up later.
Would you throw the blanket on the cage?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Bring him out by the phone.
Okay, we'll get him out here.
Later.
See you later.
Have a good day.
You too now.
I'll buy it.
Don't worry about it.
Everything will be just fine.
Okay.
Now, see, you can't even do this in the studio.
Work with your foot.
Yeah.
Work the speakerphone with your foot.
Wouldn't it be great if it didn't ring for about 15 minutes?
That would be frightening.
Hello.
Another hang up.
Now, that wasn't a hang up.
There's somebody on there making guttable sounds.
Okay.
It's a 714 on Zeta 4.
Your confused station is morning.
And we're doing the show for my house.
Now, Casey's going to be stopping by.
Hello.
I made it.
Yeah.
I don't believe it.
I believe it.
Is it that great?
You sound like you're the church.
We are.
We're celebrating.
We're celebrating Passover and Easter and all of it together.
So we're trying to cover our butts.
We know why your car ring doesn't work.
That's it.
Why is that?
Because you have a remote car forward number.
It doesn't have a car waiting.
Do you follow that?
Do you understand what it is?
Do you want to explain that again?
You want to run that bias again, sir?
A little diagram.
Just pretend you're like Joe Paterno.
I take it that the number you're giving out is a temporary number which is forwarded to your home.
Yeah.
That's right.
And that number does not have car waiting.
But when you call out, see it does.
When you call out, then that is a great and it can call you.
Right.
He's right.
As it turns out, he's absolutely correct.
Anyway, it sounds real good.
Does it really?
Yeah, I think I want to find you today.
What do you mean by that?
Oh, I think I can find you.
For what?
I don't know.
What are you going to do after you find him?
Oh, crash the party.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Crash the radio show.
There's no party going on here.
This seems to be a big misconception.
Yeah.
The party's next weekend.
Yeah.
There is no party going on here.
There's at all.
How many people there?
I'll let you two four five six.
Yeah, just six is not a party.
No.
There's engineers here.
Six is not even a minion.
No.
You know what I mean?
I'm probably hearing you here.
Good.
That's what we like.
Because we hear you just fine.
Okay.
I'm coming from Stewart.
Stewart.
No, come on.
I'm serious.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
I'm going to ask Tom, but I'll be still working today.
You dialed in from Stewart.
What a great American, huh?
I got a campaign with WRNS or Westa here.
Yeah.
From Tampa.
Yeah, they keep cutting in on it.
We're going to do what we're going to do is pipe bomb their tower.
And get them off the air.
Then we won't have that problem anymore.
Okay.
They got some, they got some damn nerve cutting in on our signal, all right?
Yeah, really.
Okay, listen, have a great day.
Okay, Neil, I'll come find today.
Okay.
I doubt it.
He's not coming all the way from Palm Beach, okay?
Yeah, all these.
You never know.
So anyway, it's a 17.
Now, what the hell are we going to do?
Because he's phoned just ring off the hook.
Well, you stand flat and ring.
It smells like something's cooking, too, doesn't it?
Oh, good.
Is somebody in the kitchen with Diana?
Say the four.
Hello.
Hello.
Now, that's unusual, isn't it?
Because I know there's somebody on this line.
No.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Oh, no, what was that?
It came on hook.
Oh, I see.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
How you doing?
Good.
I want to know if you ever get to one to tell you.
Yeah.
No, I never got it.
In fact, wouldn't that be nice if somebody brought some of that by the house today?
Well, I'd like to bring some other house, but I don't want to bother you.
By the time I got there, you'd be at it there.
Yeah.
But listen, you shop in Windix, you shop in Publish, you got to go buy the produce department,
and they sell packages that they call it Orange Frost.
Yeah.
Is that the same thing?
It's the same thing.
It makes it with the one shoes, and I see it blended in the blend in.
It's exactly the same thing.
Are you cereal, orange?
Frost.
Right.
I never heard of that.
Like Jack Frost nipping at your nose, huh?
It's really good.
They have strawberry too.
It's really good.
Listen, it's my friend's fifth birthday on Sunday, and he's an avid listener.
He's wears by you.
What is his name?
And could you just call me birthday?
What's his name?
Well, I'm birthday.
Happy birthday, Robert.
All right.
And happy, uh, sook is an Easter and poor him and Passover.
Okay, great.
Thanks.
You have a nice Passover and have a great life.
Thanks.
Bye-bye.
Well, she nice.
A friendly caller.
Okay, we're going to take a break, so I guess what we'll do is just unplug the phone.
Yeah.
So we don't have to sit here listening to that ungodly ring.
It's a 718 on Zeta 4 and we'll come right back.
How about going too smooth before?
Just before the last break?
And Michael J. Fox was singing I'm an old smoothie.
Hello.
Hi.
Is this now?
Hi, Neil.
My name is Esther.
I'm a first time caller.
Hi, Esther.
Hi.
I just wanted to tell you how much I really enjoy your show in the morning.
I heard you skipped the semester, Esther.
I did.
Not just a little joke.
I didn't hear it.
Just a little joke.
I said, okay.
I'm still just a half away, so you got to forgive me if I don't get it too fast.
That's okay.
Yeah.
I just like that said, I really enjoy your show and everything.
I just wanted to ask you, when did you say you're going to be at the diplomat?
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Esther, it was just a joke, Esther.
Yeah, I'm really in trouble.
No, I wouldn't go back to the diplomat if they paid me, okay?
I knew there would be.
I used to work there and I vowed I'd never go on that, you know, over there ever again.
Yeah.
It was exciting last year.
You know, it had its moments, but that was enough for me.
It was actually moments at the diplomat.
I saw all that I needed to see.
Yeah, the most exciting moment was when RJ and Tindola kept saying, I can't hear.
I can't hear.
They shut my headphones off, you know.
I used to work at a pub to store in the mall.
And my excitement was just selling all that yogurt to everybody from, you know, from how
there was the moment of my life.
Yeah.
I love the way they bring in their brown paper bag.
Oh, don't you have an old coupon set?
They don't think you read the little print of the season expired, you know?
Yeah, and then they take their goodies out.
They go in and get a little glass of tea or something.
They open their brown bag and they get out there mustard and their mayonnaise and spread their sandwich meat.
And it's great.
Yeah, it's terrific.
I know it's like I always say to myself, if I ever end up doing something like that, I should be put out of my misery.
Amen.
You know, I just, I see it all the time because I know I used to work in Miami too.
It's for the same chain and other malls.
And I used to see the same thing and I said, I've had enough.
Yeah.
You know, I don't blame you.
But anyway, I want to take too much of the time over there.
Have you moved in?
Yeah.
How do you like it?
It's great.
Believe me.
In fact, if we can get these, you know, people from the radio station out of my house, it's going to be great.
You're perfect, huh?
Yeah.
Well, I just want to say again, I really enjoy showing it and thanks for talking with me.
Okay, Asta.
Have a good day.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
I hope she catches up someday.
She's a little behind on a few things.
Maybe you helped her because she skipped the semester.
That's the problem with Asta.
New, they had to be an explanation.
728 on Zeta 4.
Hello.
Oh, that's good.
Short but sweet.
I like that.
And we got a bunch of those this morning.
That may have been the best one.
I wonder why that is on one line.
Doesn't that strike you as being rather bizarre?
Not seriously, because we have six lines at the station, right?
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yeah.
Hey, this is great.
What's great about it, sir?
I don't know.
It's a terrific effect you got there.
Yeah, he likes the echo.
I'm a great house.
Do you like the echo?
The echo on the phone is terrific.
Yeah.
I wish a lot of luck in that house.
It sounds like a mansion.
Thank you.
Yeah, well, we're going to invite everybody in Sao For to come by.
I guess I have no idea why, but Peter thought it would be a good idea, you know?
We're trying to impress everybody.
And you didn't question him.
How?
So far.
But it's only least, sir.
It's not bought.
It's only least.
Like my car is still wish the good luck with it.
I lease everything, sir.
Sometime only for a couple of hours.
But I lease it all.
Well, listen, have a great weekend.
Okay, you too.
Happy holiday.
And eat some halivov.
Would you?
Why did you stop?
What did it do with that pregnant pause when I said eat some halivov?
I don't know what made me say that.
I don't know.
Have you ever eaten halivovs like eating the herald?
No, I haven't.
Seriously, it's like eating paper.
Really?
Hello?
Why can't we finish it?
It's like eating paper.
Are goyem alaideeata?
No.
What is this, the time tunnel?
Do I goyem alaideeata?
No.
What is this, the time tunnel?
Well, we do know we're on the air.
Yeah, that's good.
We want to recall like that so we can double-check her and make sure that we were getting that
daningram effect.
Yeah.
The daningram joke.
Yeah.
Are you sure he didn't live in this house at one time?
Could be.
Yeah, this actually.
That's where the echo came from.
Rick's flar is hanging.
In fact, you notice up there?
I want you to look up on the wall.
Can you see from where you are, the light switch?
Now, the switch down there controls those lights up above.
Now, I like home, Mike.
What is that switch control?
It's about taking a look up there and see that light switch.
Now, what kind of a maniac?
Hello?
Oh, this is Rocky Balboa.
Yeah, good.
Rocky, have a great life, pal.
Rocky, do you?
I can't believe who just slinked out of his room.
I don't know where he disappeared.
Big Dave just came slinking out.
Look, look, did he look awake?
Yeah, well, he could smell the cinnamon rolls.
That's history.
We bring Tweety out, Dave.
Can Tweety come out?
And does it?
Hello.
Speak to us.
Hello.
Hello.
Turn that radio off.
It sounds like we're in a parrot factory.
Go ahead, sir.
Are we on the air?
Yeah.
So you need a house?
Yeah.
I got one one to say, hi.
Hi, the meal.
She loves you.
This is Neil.
OK, well, we put her on the water.
OK, great.
I can't wait.
I'll put her on the water.
Yeah, believe that.
This man is.
Now, it's not a private park anymore.
What's that?
Yeah.
He told me if I talked to you, you would tell me to shreds.
This sounds like Patty Murray does, doesn't it?
This is Patty Murray.
Good question.
I like that question.
That is an excellent question.
Hold on.
Here's Carla.
That's Arthur Murray's sister.
I see why he put her on the water.
Is it an Arthur Murray's sister?
Yes, it is.
Yeah.
It is.
I saw him standing there.
See, this is a lot of fun.
Oh, there's Tiffany by the way on MTV.
Tiffany?
Tiffany.
Do you like, are you into Tiffany?
No, not too much.
No, I'm not either.
I'm not really on any Tiffany's.
Teen Queen.
Oh, I know some of those.
Yeah, he has a hit record.
Never mind.
If you don't know who Patty is.
Wait a minute.
How did he just go?
What was that?
It was like a cameo apparently.
He went to get Tweety.
No, he didn't.
I can't believe this guy.
When are you going to invite us to your party?
Let's see.
When they celebrate Sookas in Saudi Arabia, okay?
Oh, great.
When is that?
Not too soon.
But you just keep waiting, okay?
Okay.
Okay, have a nice day.
It's your vibe.
It's 7.31 on Zeta 4.
The New York Times Friday morning show.
We did.
And here comes Tweety.
You know what they say?
One good bird deserves another.
Look at that.
Well, he knows who his friends are, doesn't he?
And if I were you, listen to that.
Why were you?
I'd be very cautious because big days have been having
a problem with that bird last couple of days.
What kind of problem?
Hello.
Yes.
I just want to know if you have a dumb fight.
Yes, we do.
Why?
You want to use it?
No.
No, I just want to know.
Why do you ask that?
I just wondered if he did.
What if someone called him for something?
They already did and didn't get on the air because we're on delay.
But John Fordman is as sharp as a mots of law back here.
He won't let it happen.
Oh, good.
How are you going to get food today?
How are we going to get it?
They already delivered the breakfast.
Look great.
From TJ Cinnamon's man, we've got enough rolls in here to feed the Chinese.
Who called you today and they said that all you do is eat and talk to little boys?
That was Joey Reynolds.
That was my two favorite parts of the show.
I know, mine too.
My girlfriend is my favorite caller.
Who?
Yeah, Harlan's great.
He's great.
He is great.
He's my favorite caller when you eat.
And he's going to be here too, by the way.
Wait.
Little later, Bob's going to be here in Michelle and Harlan.
Maybe the tarot will come along too.
Well, it's not go crazy.
Yeah, because Big Dave said he wanted to show her his etchings and we're going to have a hell of a day.
Yeah?
Yep.
Have a great day, Neil.
You too.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
732 on Zeta 4 or 3.
Oh, there's the phone.
You're starting to pick again, man.
This phone.
We haven't had as much action since his phone was plugged in.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Wait a second.
Is this incredible or what?
We just can go on like the rest of the show.
We can go three and a half hours.
Speak.
Talk.
Say something.
Anything.
Even if it's she hung out.
Yeah, she just freaked out.
See, the thing is so far away, I guess.
I guess.
Yeah.
Maybe if I picked the speaker phone, I've been like, put it up on here.
Yeah.
And then they can't hear me even better.
I don't have to do it with my feet.
Hello.
Hi.
Hey, Dylan.
Can you hear me okay?
Yeah, we are on a delay thing or what.
I can hear you on the radio.
Yeah, we're on delay, yeah.
Yeah.
You can hear it on the radio, but it'll be like four and a half seconds later and you get all freaked out.
Are we really?
Yeah.
Let me tell you something.
Yes.
I just called ten minutes ago.
I'm like so excited that I can get through that I have to call again.
I don't understand what you mean by that.
You called ten minutes ago and I spoke to you?
Yeah.
And you're calling me back ten minutes later?
Yeah, no.
We just love you so much, yeah.
Thank you.
Well, it's nice hearing from you, but don't overdo it.
Okay.
I mean enough is enough.
Do you believe it?
That's against the rules.
It's against our law.
That's against the law and can't do that.
I'm glad that she loves us and all of that.
Now look at that.
Look at that bird over there outside.
Is getting ready to come in?
Oh, yeah.
Is it like something out of an Alfred Hitchcock movies, isn't it?
All the birds are converging in my house.
Oh, the song.
Yeah.
She called back.
She's probably getting testy.
981-4772.
That's the number.
981-4772.
And don't get all excited about this number after today because it's today only.
You probably reach Joe's pizza or something.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi, how you doing?
Hi.
Make a phone.
We're using your phone.
No.
See you later.
Okay.
Good question though.
That was a good call, wasn't it?
Maybe the best of the morning.
Yeah.
Now I select the people who can come over and use the phone.
And she isn't one of them.
First thing.
735 on Zeta 4 and KC is coming by a little later on.
Not KC McCoy, but the real KC.
Right.
From the Sunshine Band.
Is that the end of our calls, by the way?
Is that it?
You don't know this mostly women are calling here this morning.
Have you noticed that?
Yeah.
What do you think that is?
No idea.
No idea.
Hello.
Well, wait a minute.
How come I don't hear him?
Yeah, deal on it.
No, I hear you.
Yeah, okay.
Now I hear you fine.
Hey, how you doing?
Good.
Hey, listen.
I had a fun time listening to that crazy Mazi you had on your show yesterday.
Yeah, he was great, wasn't he?
Yeah, he was real good.
Hey, you know something I really think South Florida must be a haven for Nazis.
It is.
Yeah.
Yeah, I worked for a bunch of them too.
In fact, do you heard of a city called Miami?
All right.
Lots of Nazis in Miami, believe me.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Neil.
In fact, they're opening a new business.
It's called Rentonazzi.
Hey, listen.
You can have a good holiday or what?
It's, I'm oblivious.
Just each day to me is like the one before and the one after.
You know, I'm not into these holiday things.
Well, listen.
The holiday means good food usually when you go visit your folks or something.
Not me.
I get good food when I visit my mother every week.
Okay, she doesn't wait just for the holiday.
Well, you know something I've been trying to get out of this town for the past two days.
But Houston Airlines has been screwing me up.
Really?
What are they doing?
Well, they overbook me.
On the first Wednesday night and last night they just canceled the flight.
Great.
So I'm still trying to get out of this crazy town to get some Italian pasta for the weekend.
I don't blame him.
Well, listen, good luck to you, sir.
We'll see you in Naples.
And if you can't make it to Italy, just head over to the West Coast, okay?
You got it here.
Okay.
Are you enjoying the bird over here?
Tweety.
Tweety.
We have a lot of...
Why don't we come in here?
We're talking both make the same guttable sound.
Yes, we do.
We both make about as much sense, I would say.
737 on Zeta Ford.
Hello.
Hi.
How are you doing?
Okay.
Well, I got through.
It's amazing.
It is pretty frightening.
You have to time it for the day so that you dial before they hang out.
Yeah.
Well, you've got it down Pat.
Yeah.
You can do like that lady before.
You can call about 20 times, you know.
Yeah, well, you know, I just might do that.
I'll just keep on calling you.
Wasn't that great?
She was so excited that she got through the 10 minutes later.
She just felt compelled to call back again.
I know.
She might have strayed.
I mean, I'm not putting her down because she's a real groupie and loyal and all of that.
But let's get serious.
Yeah, it's not like she was exciting enough to call several times.
No.
Like maybe next Easter, like you hear from Sunday?
Yeah.
Well, you just might hear all these helicopters going over my house.
No, as a matter of fact, I can't hear any of them.
No.
They're doing military exercises over here or something.
Yeah, I'd like to watch those military exercises.
I'll be honest with you.
Especially push-ups.
There you go.
Okay.
Well, it was good to talk to you now.
Okay. I'm glad you got through.
I have a wonderful holiday because it sounds like you're really into it.
Oh, I am so into it.
I can't believe it.
Okay. Have a good one.
Bye-bye.
Okay.
It's 7.30.8 on Zeta 4.
And let's see.
We don't have another break to life with the news.
So we can just keep taking these calls.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi, I'm Terry.
I'm calling all the way from West Palm Beach.
Are you cereal, Terry?
Wow.
You mean you're spending your own money for it?
Yes.
That's great.
That's real loyalty, okay?
I look to see you guys every morning.
Fantastic.
Great.
You're right.
Listen.
So how does it sound for my house, Terry?
It sounds good.
Does it?
Yeah.
Do you want one of those inner compounds?
No, we got a whole thing here, man.
There's just stuff hanging from the ceiling and the walls.
It's great.
I was listening to you.
I guess it was Thursday.
No.
Wednesday morning.
I was like five minutes away from work.
Yeah.
And I think you guys mentioned something about topic-ass.
Not to move on gas to your house.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I've had some real problems with that.
Yeah, I worked with them.
I came to West Palm.
Really?
I wanted to know why they weren't going to give you gas.
Well, because they just don't feel like coming all the way out here for a measly hundred bucks, you know,
more than once a week, I guess, is their story.
I think gas companies are terrible.
Yeah.
They really are.
They're the absolute worst.
And any guy didn't even get...
He didn't even stick around to make sure the pilot was...
But I realized that he's not compelled to do that.
But he does realize that we've had all this problem keeping this pool heated.
And he came out here and he just like took off in a huff.
Like he was indignant that he had to even come out here again for my measly hundred bucks.
And we're still waiting to try to get it fired up again.
So hopefully the pool people are coming by today.
And with any luck, we'll get the pool heated again.
Hey, listen, I feel like I live over there in Davy.
Okay, with that trap of gas, I talked to them the last five days, maybe 20 times, okay?
And they just...
They got a difficult time getting their act together.
And she says to me,
you're putting a tremendous strain on our resources.
What kind of a business is that?
That we, you know, one lousy house here with one thankful of gas
is putting a tremendous strain on their resources.
That's terrible. That's people are bad.
I can't believe they set that.
When you see the hamster died, that, you know, keeps the truck going.
The hamster died, so they had to go out and get a new one.
That's the good one.
It is at my home.
I wanted to come on with the, you guys, the happy Easter and the safe holiday.
Thank you.
And the same, you too.
Bye-bye.
Okay, 740 on Zeta 4, and this is the Nioh Roger Shore.
We're doing it for my house.
And the phone just keeps on ringing.
Isn't that amazing?
Someone calling.
And the bird just keeps on singing.
And the phone keeps on ringing.
Weeds here.
You're happy with the bird, aren't you?
We, we, I don't know.
We have the same, same beam, yeah.
Same, yeah, plain.
Yeah.
Jim B, my thing.
Hello.
Hello.
Morning, Nioh.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I'm a first time caller.
Don't you kind of like when we say, like when we punch up four or five lines in a row?
Because it doesn't just happen here.
It happens at the station too.
And we say, hello, hello.
You know, when you go through that, don't you love that?
Oh, it drives me nuts.
It's like, why don't these people say anything?
Wow, they're like a comatose.
They're in a comatose state, Florida.
Yeah, so it was funny.
I, I turned on Joy Rale's the other morning.
I don't know why.
And it turned over enough.
He was sitting there and saying, I'm funny.
I was funny.
And he thought he was the funniest person.
Well, no, he doesn't think that, but he believes that if you keep saying it long enough that you're
going to start believing it.
The big lie.
Yeah.
And he's been saying it for about 75 years that he's been on the air.
And not only doesn't the audience believe it, but even he doesn't believe it.
You can tell the way he's trying to convince himself and it just isn't flying.
Kind of like the bird.
Great.
But now I think you guys got a really good show.
And I listen to you every morning.
Great.
Now, how does it sound this morning?
Be honest with me.
Does it sound confused this morning?
It sounds a little confusing.
Yeah.
Different.
There's a lot of echo in your house.
Don't you love it?
We like that.
It's it.
It's an NBABC feeling.
Yeah.
Yeah, the ghost of a Christmas past is in his house, believe me.
Some wild stuff goes on in here.
Okay.
You guys have a good morning.
Okay, you too.
Hi.
Bye-bye.
Boy, I hope Rick's scar doesn't hear this show.
He's going to be so jealous.
He might want to do shows from this house.
I mean, like on a regular basis.
I know.
But he's got that reverb.
Hello.
Hi.
Good morning.
How you doing?
Good, dude.
Great.
All right.
Are you on the air?
You're on the air right now.
Oh, good.
This is us.
Is that you?
Can you do me a favor?
What's that?
I mean, you do, uh, I'm saying happy birthday to my daughter for me.
Well, we're not going to sing.
But we'll say happy birthday.
What's your name?
I wish you're happy birthday for me.
What's your name?
Her name.
Her name is four years old.
Happy birthday, Jennifer.
Did you hear it?
Yeah.
Let me say it again.
Happy birthday, Jennifer.
And many, many more.
Thank you very much, guys.
You bet.
I was four and five year old, you know?
Yeah, that guy was almost coherent.
He was okay.
Oh, he was all right.
He was all right.
It's Jennifer.
That's a little bit more coherent.
A little too much celebrating last night, Jennifer.
Hello.
Yeah, these kids today.
I know.
Hello.
Yes.
How you doing?
All right.
This is a man from Twist.
The man from Twist?
Yep.
Like Twist.
It's a magazine, business sales.
Oh, yeah.
We remember.
Now we know it rings a bell.
Yeah.
Yeah, it goes back ways.
Also a Michigan color born in Lincoln Park.
Great.
Now we're talking.
Now we can get into some of this Michigan trivia
that'll put the burden to cage with the other one.
Yeah, we're talking, uh, MSL Field Freeway.
Yeah, sir.
Yeah, let's get into the, uh, It's a Ford Expressway.
And John.
Let's, uh, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, what about Twitch magazine, sir?
Okay, Twitch magazine is a new, old music video of Florida.
And, uh, Zeta, the inventions, they're taking out a half page.
They're making a full page on the back.
Great.
Well, you know Zeta, man.
We're sparing no expense.
One more thing about.
I'd like to also mention this.
You could use your hand for a map when referring to the state.
You could use your hand for a map?
Yeah.
Well, you'd say like, you know, if you're looking at your right hand,
I'd let them Detroit.
That'd be close to the sun.
Oh, I see.
For Michigan, you mean?
Right.
Yeah, that's true.
How does that relate to Florida?
Well, not Florida.
You don't use your hand.
What would you use?
Well, you got it.
We can't federal off prohibits us from saying it on the air,
but you can just kind of look at it.
You know, it's a matter of fact.
No, seriously, they're building a statue in honor of John Holmes
in the shape of the state of Florida.
That's serious.
That's true.
Looking up in radio stations, warning shows,
reflector tape and play with tail.
The possible data could be a new rock bar on it.
So where does the DTX and Detroit?
No.
We're appealing to the LVD factor here.
Well, it's common denominator.
You know, sir, if you leave today,
you can be back in Michigan by tomorrow.
Come on, I said.
We know you're the straight man,
but better not heard and the bird.
Exactly.
You said it perfectly.
Have a great week out in a good holiday.
Bye-bye.
So he didn't like what I said.
I don't blame him because it was in temperate
was a disgusting remark.
Exactly as it was intended.
Hello.
What's up?
What's happening, dude?
What's up?
Hey, why don't you just wait like 4.5 seconds to say hello?
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Because people are listening off the radio, right?
Yeah.
I never thought about that.
That's how I'm calling it.
Well, that's good.
And you got right through, right?
No.
No?
I'm like 50 times.
Where are you calling from?
Oh, Miami.
Oh, from Miami.
That's why, man.
I'm telling you, you see, no, if you were dialing in English, you would have been different.
But our phone is like in plantation and we're not, we're not bilingual on the phone yet.
Yeah, are we?
You're going to send me the money?
Would I spend on colonial?
Yeah.
What do you mean, what you, oh, that's right.
This is a long distance call.
Oh, it is.
Oh, my God.
You had never thought about that.
I didn't even.
All right.
Well, how about if they called us collect, then we could go through the, we could have some fun with the operator?
Hmm.
What a mess.
That'll be.
Yeah, but it would be a good bill for the station.
I like that.
A good bill for Portland, man.
And if anybody deserves it, they do.
Yeah.
They've taken years off my life.
I know that.
You can't hear that.
I'm going to radio.
You can't.
You can't?
No, not in the radio.
Yeah.
But when you're on the phone, man, it sounds like we're in this gigantic, this mammoth tunnel.
Yeah.
In a big cavern, right?
I guess.
Okay.
Okay.
I kind of departed quickly there, didn't I?
I don't believe that, man.
I'm telling you, these phones are just like nonstop this morning.
747 on Zeta 4.
Hello.
Yeah, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Good.
Listen, I'm going to know if you can give me a favor.
Probably not.
My roommate's trying to get up out of bed.
His birthday's on Sunday.
I want you to have some, wish him a happy birthday.
What do you mean he's trying to get up out of bed?
That's an interesting, um, he's trying to get up.
Yeah.
He was up real late.
Oh, yeah.
I know a lot of people like that who are trying to get up.
Yeah, could you wish him a happy birthday for me?
Okay.
What's his name?
Brad.
Hey, Brad, happy birthday to you and get down out of bed.
Thank you very much.
Okay.
Good luck, yes, sir.
Getting up in this time is not always an easy compliment.
747 on Zeta 4.
Then he'll run your show from my house from our living room.
And this is, this is relaxing, isn't it?
This is what it's all about.
Yeah.
You like it?
I need to see the car practice already.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yeah.
All right.
Good.
Uh, great show yesterday.
Yesterday.
Yesterday, yeah.
It was a pretty, uh, pretty hairy there at the end.
I thought we were going to be in for one of those, uh,
the long thing again, but.
Well, did you just, did you hear us talk about the paper?
There's a thing in a paper with my picture in a whole business this morning.
I'll get it today.
I haven't gotten out of bed yet.
Well, I'm glad you'll get it today because I'm sure I won't.
Listen, uh, Glenn.
Yes, sir.
I have to tell you, your performance has hasn't reached.
I've been outstanding.
What do you mean?
Oh, the way I've been.
Like the last couple of days.
Yeah.
Like this week.
Yeah, like this week.
Yeah.
Well, standing up for your rights.
That's right.
I'm talking back and, uh, it's been, it's been something.
Well, good.
I'm glad you appreciate it.
I think the turning point was, uh, remember the new Karatni story?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was it.
That turned it around for.
One for the gripper.
Yeah.
One for the gripper.
That was it.
I don't know where that came from, sir, but I liked it.
I'm glad it did, though.
Yeah, me too.
Well, anyway, guys, have a good time today.
Okay.
I'll talk to you later.
I'll read the urge.
Right.
Okay.
749.
I guess we could do the news a minute early.
Yeah.
Okay.
Now listen, even the burden, their Tweety is having a great time.
Okay.
Now I can't hear your mama, but if John will just hit that.
Yeah, we trust him.
Yeah, we trust that he's cranking them.
I'm telling you what's on.
I'll be right there.
Okay.
See what he's got.
Uh, go ahead, sir.
It's just a joke, by the way.
WZTA might be beach for a lot of day on the Palm Beach.
Is.
Go ahead.
Yeah.
Anyways, um, so I'm listening to you and I get out of my car to go pay for my gas.
And also, and I'm hearing this, this Neo Technopop disco track.
I'm going to be a little bit faster if I call him music.
He's been.
Yeah.
I'm saying wait a minute.
ZDA 4 is not playing the ZD4.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I went over there.
I'm going to have a half-baked, sir.
Yeah.
Free-five.
I didn't even have any health.
It was a tape.
I was being.
Now they can't afford to give any stuff away over there.
Um, crap like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think what they're trying to do is just because your broadcast is from your house today, they're
trying to get it close and fast.
I believe that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They're broadcasting from plantation.
Yeah.
They'll get it to gas station and I know I take some composition away, but it didn't work
those times.
Isn't that great?
I understand that Johnny Darks, the one who showed from his house later on in a day two.
I believe.
Yeah.
I think so.
Yeah.
Now did you go to the gas station this morning?
That's what he just said.
I get gas normally when I drive my car.
Is there anybody around them at all?
Listen.
Sir.
Sir.
Isn't that where Chuck State concerts right in the neighborhood of White Town and St.
St.
I get gas every time I drive it with her too.
Every time.
I've got the torque to take fire to Q2.
Yeah.
I know that well.
Like I said, listen, have a great weekend and don't worry about it.
I don't worry about too much, ma'am.
I don't blame him.
See you later.
We're right by Dan Dow.
I didn't know that.
I listened to you, Shelby, because of him.
He was on the cane show last year.
And I said, wow, that sounds good.
So I started tuning in.
Yeah.
So, you know, he's responsible for more listeners and I hope that kind of bugs him.
Okay.
Well listen, I'm glad that the paint in the ass junior got to you.
Listen, you pull heater.
Yeah.
Is that under the trip line or your roof?
Because if it is, the pilot light will keep going out.
Is it under the drip line?
The roof, yeah.
Like this.
Yeah.
Pull the water pour into it.
No, no, that's not what the pilot light goes out.
It's just going out because when we light it, it doesn't stay on.
Oh, okay.
But if it is under the drip line, it will keep going out and it rests outside and all sorts of stuff like that.
Hmm, that sounds good.
Oh, well.
Probably too many drips in his house, huh?
At least, at least one anyway.
Well, I think you're right.
I think you got the right number.
Okay, listen, have a great weekend.
Thanks, Neil.
802 on Zeta 4.
Isn't that something we learned something every day?
We got to move that thing out from under the drip line.
Wow.
Maybe we could get somebody out here who knows how to work the pull heater, okay?
How about these guys?
Do you know anything about pull heaters?
They don't know about anything this morning, you know?
It's only eating.
They're sitting there like so quietly.
Are you sucking up the food, I hope?
Oh, yeah.
There's a lot of food.
Too much of it.
Did they call you over here?
Leave them alone.
Would you please just knock it off?
They can come and sit on my lap.
Is that where you keep your small children?
Yeah, up and there.
We have them up, hidden on the roof.
And you notice we have, they even have their own lightswitch there to turn on and off their own lights?
What is that thing?
Do you have any idea what that is?
There's this lightswitch way way up about 12 feet in the air.
Okay, hi.
Hi, Mia.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Alan.
Alan!
Hey, all.
Alan!
Hey, all.
Speak to me, Alan.
Yeah.
How come you're not here, Alan?
That is a gay radio I'm leaving for the Bahamas, mom.
Oh, you are going to the Bahamas, huh?
Yeah.
How come you didn't invite me to go with you?
We could add us well weekend, Alan.
Sorry, I was me who was invited.
Hey, yesterday I got scared.
When that guy called...
You got scared of what?
In other words, being in school is more important than being on my show.
I thought I was going to get to spend.
No, I tried to get through.
I was going to do the same thing that I did.
I was going to say my name and tell the guys you go to the police.
Yeah, you were going to announce on the air that it was Alan.
What does it say here?
Dressner?
Dressner here.
Yeah.
I don't think I mean, the guy can't do that.
He can't suspend me.
And then the Miami Herald called me up in the afternoon.
Yeah, what...
Haven't you seen the paper this morning?
No, I haven't gotten out of bed yet.
Are you still in bed, Alan?
No, I'm bed, Neil.
What's your address?
My girlfriend's over here now.
Shoot him.
What way to me?
Your girlfriend is over there in bed with you?
Yeah.
These kids today.
What kind of a household...
What kind of house have you all reputed?
Are you living in?
It's a very nice house, it's a nice house.
What are the disgusting things on...
Where are your parents?
A dad, she's sleeping.
What, with your girlfriend?
No, with his girlfriend.
Oh, with his girlfriend?
And what about your mom?
Are you sleeping with her boyfriend?
No, my car is a divorce, Neil.
So, she's probably sleeping with her boyfriend?
Oh, see, there you go.
What a house of ill-reputed.
You know, everybody sleeps with that nice piece of somebody in there.
That's what you think, Alan.
But Neil, yesterday I was a pretty thick chef.
I'd say I try to get through all morning in Poff at the...
Yeah.
Well, as a matter of fact, Bob and Michelle just went to check out your new room in my house, Alan.
Oh, did they really?
Yeah.
How's it look?
It looks pretty good.
In fact, you can bring your girlfriend over here, Alan.
All right.
We'll just all line up and watch.
Let's remove in there.
What's that?
What did you say you can watch?
I said, we'll all line up and watch, Alan.
Okay.
He said, okay.
And we also saw you in your Camille appearance at the fashion show, by the way.
We wanted to know you were really stunning.
Oh, thank you very much, Neil.
Okay, well, listen, have a great trip, Alan.
Don't worry about it, okay?
Don't worry about what those lunatic say.
I notice that you haven't said anything to Alan.
I have nothing to say.
Okay.
Now one more.
Wait, I have nothing against Captain Dave.
I like Captain.
No, it's not Captain Dave.
He's not here.
Who is that?
That's the bird.
Uh, uh, uh, five bird.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Have a nice trip, Alan.
Yeah, you'd have to...
I'll see next week.
We notice he had nothing to say.
Wait a minute.
What did you just say?
What made you say?
What did you say?
Party next weekend, right?
Yeah, you'll be here, right?
Yeah, we'll be off either.
We're waiting with Bated Brett.
Here at the house, Alan.
And then we're gonna make that clear, okay?
Sure, Glenn.
Okay.
Hi.
You know, have a good week.
He hates me with a patient.
He doesn't hate you with a patient.
I am honored.
Because you're unfriendly to him.
Yeah.
I am.
Maybe if you tried a different tactic,
if you tried to be friendly and warm.
No.
Charming?
I'm not gonna happen.
Put your wing around.
I heard what the made him feel wanted.
I heard what he said about me Monday.
And that's...
I had no opinion really about him one way or the other
until Monday.
Until he said he were a douchebag and among braids.
That's right.
Abnoxious?
Yeah.
I had really had no opinion about him one way or the other.
But he took care of that as he tends to do.
Very sensitive.
Hello?
Yes.
And with this.
This is Neil.
Oh, wonderful.
Hi, Neil.
This is Ted.
How wonderful.
Oh, great.
I just wanted to tell you how much I like your show.
Okay, Ted.
It's really great.
And I wanted to congratulate you for everything you do for us.
For our listeners.
And I just wanted to tell you that.
Okay, Ted.
Thanks a lot.
But get a new accent.
Well, yeah.
It's 807 on Zeta 4.
You want to do the weather.
Because I think we can do three breaks this hour.
Okay.
Oh, wait a minute.
If you pull it out there, you're going to disconnect
whoever's on there now, right?
No.
Oh, that's right.
They'll just keep in limbo, right?
Yeah.
You like it, okay?
John, I don't want you to get testy.
But we do them whenever we feel like it.
Just because the log says 20, we'll do it.
It's 10 past eight on Zeta 4.
And we can plug that thing back in there, Andy.
Whenever we're...
Nope.
Don't panic.
9-8-1-4772.
And let's take one from wherever the hell it is.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hi, this is Howard from Detroit.
Howard.
Basically not from Carl's Spring.
Oh, that's good.
The bird is still a few seconds away from the sofa.
So get in all that Michigan stuff, Howard.
Oh, absolutely.
You wish to ask me a happy birthday a couple of weeks ago.
How could I forget, yeah?
How come you even keep out your address yesterday, you know?
You want me to give out your address.
So everybody come over your house.
You were going to call him and wish him congratulations or something.
Or make up with them.
Did you hear him say anything just now?
I didn't hear a word.
No, I can hear you.
It's just that there are certain individuals who are no longer discussed on this show.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Oh, yeah.
Excuse me.
No, we don't...
We don't deal with people who have like, in the minus column.
We don't deal with those people.
Where's the ice cream store?
You keep on talking about it.
And I never knew where it was.
Well, the ice cream store is a place where many hearts have been broken.
How are you?
You guys talking about all the forbidden stuff?
No, that's not.
Why is that forbidden?
Oh, I didn't know.
All these are in how he is.
I got to get a feeling it's around Broward in 441.
Well, no, that's a basket of robins over there.
You can go over and see the people from not so hot 105 over there.
But the ice cream store that you're talking about is on university at 44th Street.
Oh, I know where that is.
That's how we're talking cross-springs is long distance to this number?
Of course, because it's a Hollywood number.
Howard, we're not fools, you know?
You don't want to be overrun by people from coral springs,
because there's some real psychotic people up there, you know what I mean?
No, well, not the ones from Michigan though.
No.
You listen to him.
More like the ones from Georgia.
What's that?
Ariesa, how are you restaurant at commercial?
Never heard of it, Howard.
Really?
Yeah.
You got to take it more into my wife's bath.
She listens to I guess or two minutes.
Yes?
And she never-
Speaking of psychotic, yes, Howard.
Rock Radio.
What?
You never-
Rock Radio.
Yeah, she's really-
You couldn't get over yesterday's program that you had.
I know, it was pretty-
It was exciting, wasn't it?
Wow, it was the best.
I thought 2020 was good interview, yeah.
They would have been without a middle-agent coach.
But I had a feeling, you know, nobody in Cooper City would behave like that.
Maybe a terrible fellow, but not a Cooper City.
Oh, no, that was terrible.
I figured that this Walters might call you up for an interview.
Barbara?
Yeah, Barbara Walters might get John.
So, um, have you ever been on the John Lodge?
Oh, yeah.
We all have to go to the park.
You know, I'll tell you something.
You drive down the John Lodge.
You need an Army helmet.
Yeah.
A 45 in your-
How about-
How about World War Nate Mile?
How about the old Michigan State Fair?
State Fair, yeah.
That's another place.
How about the Luz-
Fire Delecretesia?
They had a skating rink.
Yeah.
It's been back in a long time.
How about Hazel Park in 11 Mile and Dequinter, how?
I used to live in Southfield.
Oh, yeah.
How about the 12 Mile and Telegraph, the 12 Mile Howard?
Oh, yeah.
12 Mile and Telegraph.
He's a lot of talk to that.
He's in a lover, huh?
He's already apoplectic.
Yeah.
Well, listen, Neil.
Everyone listening to you every morning.
You got a great show.
You got to try out a little reason.
I think you'll enjoy it.
Okay.
Thanks a lot, Howard.
Okay, buddy.
See you later.
Great guy.
Anybody from Michigan's okay in my-
It's 813 on Zeta 4, 13 past 8.
And look another phone call.
I can't believe the way they're like sitting on that step-man,
like a live audience, and they're just well-behaved,
and they're fondling each other.
It's incredible.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm just jealous.
Yes.
And I was wondering about, if you know what, uh,
I've been more happened yesterday with Alan.
I just heard about the paper.
You didn't hear Alan on the show about 10 minutes ago?
Yeah, I heard him, but I was wondering if he heard any more about it.
Are you an Alan fan?
Yeah.
Really?
You're one of Alan's groupies?
Really?
Yeah, just about everybody.
Well, there's only one person I know who's not a member of his family.
I think there may be more.
Who?
A coach Conway.
A coach Conway.
A coach Conway in the bird, yeah.
This sounds like one Alan's.
That's a new show on CBS this fall, by the way.
Coach Conway in the bird?
Yeah.
No idea what's going on.
Yeah, this is Alan's one Alan's fan.
It's a question about it.
Yeah.
Why are you trying to talk over him?
Oh, I thought he could hear me.
How old are you, sir?
16.
16.
16-year-old young man, and you're trying to talk over him?
How much do you expect for your younger-
How much do you expect for your younger-
Exactly.
I was trying to tell him something.
What was that?
That this sounds like a quintessential Alan fan.
Yeah.
And no idea what's going on.
He is.
He's in love with Alan.
Not literally, but figuratively, right, sir?
Yeah, I only listen to the show in the morning because I have to go to school in the day.
Yeah.
And I'm gay.
And you might kind of talk because he listens to the show.
And he showed me the tape when he showed me what happened.
Yeah.
Well, the amazing part of it is that it was Harlan and Bob who were on the show with me,
and Alan couldn't get through on the phone.
But somehow, Alan got all of the press.
And he had nothing to do with it.
He's got to help an agent, Alan.
He really does.
I think William Morris must be booking him.
You know what I mean, sir?
Yeah.
I'm sure you know.
No, no, I do.
I clue.
You don't know William Morris from Arthur Morris.
No.
I know Joe Morris.
Joe Morris.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now, what Alan's fans, this is it.
I've been waiting for this.
Yeah.
He's a Giants fan, this fan.
Yeah.
This shows it right here.
You're not a Giants fan, are you?
Yeah.
Thank God.
Well, listen, no, everything's okay.
Alan's on his way to the Bahamas.
And he's going to be here in my house next weekend.
And he's in the sack right now with his girlfriend.
And you know, everything's okay at his house.
He got it.
And dad is sleeping.
And you know, while dad is sleeping, Rome is burning.
It's the burning bed.
Great father.
That burning bed syndrome, okay?
Are you burning it?
I could be burning it, huh?
Okay.
All right.
Now what the hell did you just say?
Well, it's one Alan's fans.
You, you interpret.
Come on.
It's 816 on Zeta 4.
Well, this is, I'm telling you, seriously, we haven't had this much action on the phone.
In my house since the night he had his birthday party.
Seriously, there were a few more calls in the house that night, but we're getting pretty close to it.
Hello.
Neil.
Yeah.
How are you?
Real good.
Listen, this is great.
It get right through and no problem.
That's good.
That's where we like it.
When you only have one line, see it's timing that counts.
Yeah, I mean, I like Captain David and everything, but this is great.
Yeah.
How's the show going?
Show is going fine.
Captain, I see you got me doing it.
Captain David is not here today, he's shined us again for a lousy 20 grand or something.
He's making it on some spot.
Yeah, I just gotta let you know.
I've been listening since I think, God, no.
Remember, I used to listen to Joey.
Oh, God.
Yeah, but, wow.
Yeah.
Anyway, a friend of mine turned me on to, uh.
A friend of yours.
A friend of yours turned you on, yeah.
What's that?
I say a friend of yours turned you on.
I would have wowed figuratively speaking.
I got you.
Anyway, have a good life.
You too.
Okay, boy boy.
See you later.
Say to four.
Another call.
981-4772.
What a surprise.
At 817, if you wonder why it's a little different today than usual, and that's what they say
at Passover.
Why is today different from any other day, right, Harlan?
Harlan doesn't know from the past of the world, okay?
We got all going in the house today.
Hello.
Yes.
How are you doing?
Okay.
I'd like to break F.C. rules and talk to my friend, Ray.
You go right ahead, sir.
You do whatever the hell you want.
And if the F.C. doesn't like it, they can stick it, okay?
Right.
Hey.
What's that?
I'm talking to Ray over the radio.
Okay.
What do you want to say to Ray, pal?
I'd like to call him a scumbag.
Okay.
And among brain?
Yeah, among brain.
And a subhuman douchebag?
Yeah.
Okay.
You got it.
About this Allen guy.
Who?
Why is he the big, um...
The big Kahuna?
Excellent question, sir.
Well, it's a little personal, sir, but if you ever got to know him while I'm up, you'd understand, okay?
I think he's an 80.
Okay.
Thank you, sir.
You must have heard his call.
Don't ever call us again.
Oh, please.
Call back Monday.
And we'll talk about it in depth.
Good idea.
Huh?
18, 18.
Now you see what's going to happen if you start picking on him next week?
He's going to come in because he's got all we've got.
I'm well aware of this.
That's right.
Why don't you just ignore him like we're ignoring certain other people?
Good idea.
You know what I mean?
I'll be glad to.
Okay. I find it difficult to do myself.
I know.
Hello.
Are you there?
Yeah.
Can solving.
Can solving?
Yes, sir.
You mean like less consolving?
Yeah.
He sounds like Ed.
A little bit.
So how you did?
What is that, Bob?
What did you say?
Oh, they're going to be an audience.
Now they're like, they're moving in now, like on Oprah show.
You say what?
I thought we'd see you at Habit Kanta with two.
And the same to you, sir.
And I hope you have a wonderful Saturday and don't drink too much wine.
I won't.
And do me a favor.
Yes, sir.
You don't get a say.
I've been a long time listening.
Uh-huh.
And you really make me laugh a lot.
I know.
Especially when you, uh, when you don't like to hear nobody else, you don't like?
Yeah.
Had a more up and down like this, yeah.
It's 819 on Zeta 4.
Hey, listen, he's laughing his butt off right now.
Okay, he's having a good time.
He wanted it and he got it.
It sounded like one of Ed's.
Like in the Toyota spot.
You wanted it.
You got it.
It sounds like, uh, and Ed, one of Ed's relatives.
A little bit.
You don't think Ed's going to get through here today.
Oh boy, I hope so.
Can I talk to him today for a minute?
You talk about a short call.
Can I ask him like, what's the question?
You talk about, brief and like, one question.
Talk about the news and briefs.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
How are you doing?
Great.
Uh, listen, I was just, my first off, I'm Joe, he's other listener.
Oh, God.
Most of us are in this room right now.
Is it something we got both of them to call us today?
He must be really hurting today.
I was just wondering if you heard the rumors about, uh, if Mayor Cajon
is it true that he was playing baseball and pinstripes?
And they make them pin the Yankee Clipper?
Is that true?
Yeah, that is true.
And, uh, you weren't supposed to find out.
So, uh, are you getting both treaties mixed up back there?
Well, I got news for it.
It's really hard to separate them to be honest with it.
They both sound alike to me.
I can ancient grief.
Oh, yeah.
Exactly.
You hit it right on the head, sir.
You know what I mean?
Which one?
One other thing.
Tweety.
I heard one where you crossed a guy from the Gaza Strip with a chap over there.
You know what you get?
I'm afraid to ask, sir.
Oil of boy Bay.
Okay, listen, that's in fact, you ought to call Joey Upser.
He could use material like that.
See you later.
I'll sell you some material like that.
Okay, happy pace officer.
Yeah, and happy clippings to you.
981-4772.
It's 821 on Zeta 4.
And, uh, where any minute KC is going to come crashing through that door,
doing this going through that door.
You believe it?
Hmm.
It could happen.
Probably show up on Gonzo's show with Miloq, you know?
Hmm, hmm.
Hello.
Right.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Fine, how you doing?
Are you sitting there?
Okay.
How you like doing it from the house?
I like doing it in the house.
That's pretty nice.
I'm comfortable with it in the studio.
One of these days I might just get my chance.
Yeah.
Yeah, we can tell, huh?
That's true.
In fact, lately it's a possibility.
Yeah.
So I just write, call and say hi.
You know?
Yeah.
See you.
That's okay.
We don't either.
So don't worry about it.
Okay, I'll just listen to you guys then.
Okay.
Okay, listen, have a great weekend.
All right.
Just don't worry about it.
We're not.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
All right.
I think we ought to have the party this weekend, okay?
Or Alan would get upset, though, wouldn't he?
Oh, I think it's a good idea.
No, we can't do that.
It's a past of all that.
It's Easter.
Yeah, you do.
You're not even invited, okay?
I know.
You're not even invited.
I'm well aware of that.
Because this party is for the purpose of corrupting the morals of miners, okay?
I don't want him to certain idiots in his town.
Exactly.
We have to cease and desist and govern ourselves accordingly, okay?
Right?
You know, yes.
How you doing, Joe?
Gary and buddy, I haven't talked to you in a long time.
Yeah, how you been?
All right, listen, I want to take a couple of things first,
where I get into my meantime.
Wait a minute.
Look at that.
It's Elsi de Borden, Cal.
On my TV said I can't believe it.
Opie.
Oprah's on.
Oh, my God.
A couple weeks ago, I was on my way to Palm Beach.
I couldn't get you guys on the radio, so I flipped over to Joey and, eh?
Incredibly starting to steal another one of your materials, eh?
He's done to do his ideas in Spanish, not can you believe it?
What do you mean you couldn't get us on the radio?
I was on the turn plate and went to Palm Beach.
When you were, I was going to pass there, and I stayed there.
I was on my way to San Lucic County.
Oh, yeah.
I was starting to fade away.
I was starting to freak out.
Yeah.
I threw it over to Joey.
I couldn't do it.
I threw your tape, and I couldn't believe he used your ideas in Spanish.
Yeah, he's a regional man.
I found him.
And then speaking of original, there's a place in Palm Beach.
Still another one of your lines.
In a banner is a Palm Beach lake.
And it's just incredible.
Right.
And that great.
Let me ask you something.
Now, see that baseball season around the corner.
Who do you pick for the interventions, is that?
Who do you like?
Oh, give me about a week, okay?
I'm still, once the final four were over this weekend,
and then I can get my mindset on baseball, okay?
And finally, listen, there was some guy a couple weeks ago called
and said he was from B.C.C.
and said, he doesn't listen.
A few people were listening to you and stuff.
This guy, number one, didn't say which college was he from.
I mean, there's three of them around here.
And if it's the one where I'm going to in Palm Beach,
it would make no sense at all because I told you about that
experiment that they play and why 100s they play Joe,
and they play Greg and Donald.
Not once if I heard a record from GTR.
Now, if it's supposed to be so great, why don't we hear
that crap on the radio?
By the way, GTR, we understand, is moving their studios
to the Joy's R Us store over on, where is that on 4.1?
Are you putting it right next to Windmour?
I mean, it's a perfect drive back to B.C.C. Windmour and GTR.
In fact, they're bringing back Francis Harle,
which are going to have a show in the morning called Bing Bong School.
All right, Neil, listen, thanks for that.
It's a great time to get into it.
It's a moment of occasion.
So have a good week.
And see you later, Bart.
OK.
I didn't know it was a momentous.
I mean, isn't that disgusting, the idea that they were doing,
that they're your drug station, that they were doing a show
from a head shop, where they were selling paraphernalia like torches,
and bongs and stuff like that?
Disgusting.
What?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's Dave over there.
Yeah.
Big Dave.
Yes.
Oh, we have another call here.
Hello.
Hello.
Good morning.
Getting back to the pool.
Yes.
Oh.
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah.
The reason your pilot by the early pilot won't stay lit,
is because your full filter could be dirty.
The filter could be dirty?
Yeah.
How thorough is your pool, ma'am?
Have him clean your filter and then try the pilot life.
Well, that's how it's pretty unlikely, because they just put in a whole new filter last week.
Okay, well then that won't do the problem.
No, but that is helpful though.
Yeah.
I've felt a question for you.
What is Captain Dave, a Captain Hough?
This show.
Yeah, he used to be the captain of this show before he abandoned the ship.
All right, well you have a nice day.
Okay, thanks for the help.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
We haven't really got a lot of constructive help on the pool situation, ever.
I had a couple of calls today, but these people don't know from pools at all.
Anyway, it's a 825.
Well, I'm kind of swept up in all the emotion of what's going on around here, you know?
Yeah.
Now these engineers, these guys are going to have to be here like till seven o'clock tonight or something.
Now you guys are going to be out of your minds, okay?
You'll let them talk you into this?
Yeah.
No, I'm serious.
If I would have known that it would have required this kind of slave labor, I would have said, forget it.
I mean, we're having, it's okay, but this is ridiculous.
Or the idea of just doing the morning show.
That would have been okay at 10 o'clock and then the guys, you know, stayed back at the station
because it doesn't really mean for anything, does it?
I will see.
I can't think of anything.
By the way, Bob was just on his way to give me some more Diet Cherry 7 up in my refrigerator in there.
Thank you so much, Bob.
Not look at that.
He's with a smile and everything.
Oh yeah.
That's what we like.
Service with a smile.
You know what I mean, Harlan?
It's a 26 past eight.
Yes.
To take a break or a...
Oh wait a minute.
No, we don't have to take any break.
No, we have to take a call.
Okay.
Let me just look at the rest of the log that they brought us backward.
It must be because it's past over there.
I think we're reading the log in Hebrew.
Seriously, from right to left.
Hello.
Luania, how you doing?
Great, what's up?
I don't know too much.
I was just talking to a friend of mine here in the office.
He says he's just shown with you once before.
Who's that?
My name's Vince Marcazi.
He used to manage a guy named Finn Bar Nolan.
Oh my God, the touch healer.
Yeah.
I can't believe it.
Boy, I haven't heard from him.
That was years ago.
That was about six, seven years ago.
He said he was a seven son of a seven son.
Exactly.
And Johnny Rivers was singing it in the background on tragic 102.7.
The seven son.
No, that's true.
He was the touch healer.
Uh-huh.
And he used to put his hands on you and touch you and stuff.
Wow.
And I kept telling him, in fact, that's where I learned that technique.
He kept just putting his hands on you and touching and squeezing and feeling.
So what's with this party you have in the house next?
Thank you very much, Bob.
You're, oh, wait a minute.
I don't want to put my cigar in her yet.
That comes at the end of the show.
What is that, sir?
What's with the party you have in the house next week?
What do you mean?
What's with it?
I want to find out how I can get invited.
You can't.
Unless you're a student at Cooper City High, you can't get invited.
You want to go back to school?
Not a student at City High, but I'm a friend of Captain Dave.
No, that assures that you're out.
Okay, he's shining us again today.
I know.
I spoke to him last night.
Okay, now, wait a minute.
Are you?
No, you're not the one who can't call and put on a falsetto voice before we call to make sure that I was awake.
No.
What?
What's he doing today, do you know?
He told me he's doing some type of commercials.
Yeah, making 20 grand a day.
Oh, I don't know about 20 grand, but...
What he said?
20 grand?
I think that as members of the morning team, that each of us ought to get a third.
Well, actually, I'm going in from my piece, too.
Well, me, too, if I can find one.
Well, listen, have a great weekend.
Good to know.
And I'm sorry we can't invite you, but it's kind of a closed party, you know?
Yeah, I hear you.
Well, I'd like to listen to this party a couple of weeks after that.
We're going to have the whole audience over here.
Okay, I'm...
I thought of a very nice gift to give you.
I'm afraid to ask.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
You're invited.
Okay.
See you later.
Now, that gets you upset, doesn't it?
Now, do I look upset?
Now, suppose Alan were here today right now.
Okay?
I took him through the kitchen down a hallway where, you know, those bedrooms are on the end,
and I gave him a private tour of the house and got him out of your hair.
That would be good.
And I stayed in here with him for like an hour and a half.
Teaching him about life.
Would that be okay?
Boy, talk about fantasy land.
This is good.
I like this fantasy land.
Trust me.
Okay.
And in a matter of fact, we ought to put that tape on.
Yeah, let's pull that off for a second.
Do something useful.
They put that cassette in there, please.
And I mean, I know that you look very relaxed and at ease, but, you know...
I'm just putting it after last night.
Just push that in there.
We can freeze frame when Terra comes on, right?
And where's the remote?
Oh, gee.
Right.
I'm getting much notice one.
Two old.
For this.
Yeah, now maybe you can do a play-by-play on this.
This is the, I think we got to rewind it, don't we?
Probably.
Probably.
You were probably in such a shock that you didn't want to.
Maybe it's already rewind.
Is it rewinding?
I can't see from here.
The sun is in the thing.
Well, the light is flashing.
There's a little square in it.
Is it rewinding, Harlan?
Yes.
It's not.
There's a little square, white square that's flashing.
It'd be broken?
Wait a minute.
Here it comes.
Here it comes.
Okay, did it say play on my screen?
I don't see anything, do you?
Oh, here we go.
Okay, just keep your paws off my VCR, okay?
Off my very expensive VCR, that's least, by the way.
I don't buy anything.
I just lease.
Even the groceries here are leased.
You know that?
It's incredible.
I think we have to go back on it.
So, okay, I think we have to back up as they say at Cooper City.
Well, this is worth waiting for, I'm sure.
Okay, it's 830, according to the time thing on my screen.
Now, isn't that convenient?
Mm-hmm.
Look at that.
We're sitting here watching the VCR for those of you who are wondering what all the dead air is,
finally.
But we do have, we have Tweety to fill in the blank series, got his own mic.
He knows what to do.
Yeah.
And he's been doing it all over the bottom of the cage by the way with this.
Another story.
Tweety.
He's okay.
Isn't it rewinding, Harlan?
Nothing is happening.
You got to get the oil on it.
Now, wait a minute.
I'll probably cause it's on the wrong thing here or something.
I don't understand it.
I think somebody messed up your tape.
Wow.
This is incredible.
We've already, we've only been here two and a half hours and they've already busted my VCR.
It looks like it's rewinding to me, isn't it?
It's what?
It's at the end.
Oh, wait a minute.
See now you got me all screwed up there.
I press play.
Okay, well, I'm sure the audience is getting into this really heavily.
Okay?
It is rewinding.
Okay, press play, he said.
I press play and not a damn thing is happening.
Huh?
I have it on 12.
Yeah.
Shouldn't it be on three?
I don't understand it.
Man, we gotta re-well listen, you're gonna have to fill a couple of seconds.
Oh no.
Yeah.
Oh my god.
I'm gonna have to fill a couple of seconds.
Here it is, here it is.
Okay, look at this.
It's in color and everything.
Wow.
832 now, on Zeta 4, there's someone at the door.
Could that be KC?
It could be KC, you never know.
We're at Neal's home in plantation.
Wouldn't it be something if it was KC right in the middle of this?
Unbelievable.
Yeah.
Oh, it's somebody who wasn't even invited.
And that would be, is this by any chance Neal Rogers house?
Who is that out there?
A listener?
Yeah, it's a listener out there.
They found it.
What does he look like, Bob?
What happened?
Was he ugly, Harlan?
Okay.
There's any ugly people, by the way, thinking of crashing the party, forget it.
Now, let's get back to the videotape.
That's Laura.
Laura, Laura's pretty good, right?
She sure is.
How come the...
What?
City plantation...
City plantation public works department.
I mean, utilities department once, you didn't know that they found it.
Thank you.
And by the way, we got some garbage that we'd be more than happy for them to take in the...
That's who that was.
In the gay rush.
Unbelievable.
There's Tara right there in the white jar.
It's her in there, doing her thing.
She really looks extra good in there.
Yeah.
Someone you know, if you are on the radio.
Oh, thank you so much, pal.
Just go pick up the garbage and cut the crap, okay?
It's 833 on Zeta 4.
We're sitting here watching.
We're sorry that the audience can't share in us, but this was the Monday and Tuesday night fashion show.
That we couldn't attend.
That we unfortunately couldn't attend because I was...
You had no excuse, but I was moving in here.
What do you mean I was sick?
I was sick.
Good.
That's been a long story.
No, it's a good excuse.
And Harlan and Bob actually are on this tape too.
And there's Bob right there from the neck down.
Looking excellent from the neck down.
From the neck up.
Hey.
But that's another story.
Who's that?
That's Bob's student.
Is that your date for the prom?
That's Jodie.
Is that Jodie that...
Trust me, you won't go wrong with that, Harlan.
Believe me, my eyesight's very good.
It's Jodie in here that...
But how come it is that all the kids in Cooper City are so good looking?
Now that's the thing I don't understand.
The exception of Mark Schwartz.
Seriously, now Mark looks like he's been auditioning for Bedtime for Bonzo.
Now there's another ugly guy too.
Who's that?
Victor's not too hot.
But Victor means well, you know.
But other than Mark and Victor, like the rest of the student body over there is incredible.
We don't want to get Coach Dushbag to get upset though.
Because you'll hear us talking about those hot student bodies.
He's less sick than we have plans.
He's listening, boy.
Who's that?
Tina.
Oh yeah, Tina Turner.
So anyway, we'll take some more calls, I guess.
While we'll have this going in the background, just this kind of a little incentive.
Phone's out ringing.
No, because it's not plugged in.
Oh, I'm very...
We unplugged it.
So go ahead, Harlan.
Are you in the right union to touch it?
There it is.
You can touch it anytime.
Let's punch it out.
Hello.
Good morning.
Oh, I don't have my headphones on.
Wait a minute.
Yeah, good morning.
How are you doing this morning, you know?
Okay.
I've been hearing this phone for the last 10 minutes.
Traveled down 95 with no traffic this morning because of a great holiday today.
Oh, yeah.
I said it nice every day should be a holiday shouldn't it?
I'm for that 100%.
I think 365 days a year would be great for me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I want to congratulate you on finally finding my favorite hangin' restaurant up there.
A lot of time in there.
Oh, man, that place is so incredible up here.
There are a lot of rangers.
No words to describe it.
No, you're gonna have to get a...
Wait a minute, sir.
Hold on.
Who's this guy?
I thought he's about to go back to his home in the Iowa issue.
Steve?
It is Italy.
That's Steve who calls me sometime there?
Holy cow, Steve.
Can you call me anytime?
Go ahead, sir.
We're watching something.
You're getting all the way out.
We have similar types of taste.
I want you to go to one of the best Chinese restaurants in the state of Florida.
And what is that?
The Bamboo Garden.
Are we?
I'm gonna try it because we keep getting touted on Chinese restaurants and most of them are so
bad that it's embarrassing.
You take my word for this.
I'll pay for your meal if you don't like it.
It's 163rd and where?
The closest street to 163rd Street shopping center.
You call it the Bamboo Garden.
Yeah.
Seapoll.
Tall, I recommended you.
That's Paul, man.
He's like in every restaurant.
There's Harlan, by the way, just making a total clown out of himself.
Okay, we'll give it a try.
Stop eating up on Harlan.
He is great.
In fact, when the show is over, I've got special plans for him that he doesn't know about yet.
I bet you are.
Listen, I'll see you this time.
Have a super day.
I'm losing.
We're changing cells here or something.
But I'll lose you.
But anyway, I've got it finally got through.
You have a great show.
And I enjoy listening to every single board.
Thanks a lot.
I'll see you on Tisha Bob, okay?
We got it.
Bye-bye.
Okay, let's pull that out, Harlan.
Again, or Andy or somebody just to pull the phone out before it rings again.
Now, because we're getting to the good stuff here, and you were beginning to make guttable sound.
Well, I saw a good one.
A good one.
A good girl.
You saw a good one.
What kind of a...
Christ is disgusting.
No, not exactly.
Just a...
This...
This...
Like these people are pieces of meat or something, okay?
Well, it was apropos.
Wait till you see Alan here by the way.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, well, I'm going to miss that.
No, you will, because he's only under very briefly.
He'll be pleased to know.
Now, what are these two doing back here?
Did you see that?
I find little grab-ass back here behind a couch.
Michelle and Bob, trust me.
You might want to turn around and watch.
But it's reminiscent of Don Webb and Joey on TV.
Yeah, only this is a little more exciting.
Now, who is that?
Leslie?
Leslie.
Now, why do you say it that way?
I mean, Leslie, that might be okay.
Oh, this is the problem we have the bathing suit.
Oh, my.
Now, there's a guy named Jimmy, by the way, who comes down here.
Who is that?
He wants to know who that is.
The one that's got all her clothes off.
I mean, talk about us being pornographic.
Look at these Cooper City kids, man.
They're like naked.
These are high school kids.
Oh, my.
Oh, my.
Now, if you just would've known that this was going to be on Monday or Tuesday, even with your little
infirmity that you had, you might have made it up to this.
Yeah, man, I've gotten there somehow.
Exactly.
You might have had somebody drive you up there.
That girl on the left.
What a suit.
He's got all the right parts and all the right places.
What a bathing suit.
Isn't that a name of a country song?
Looking for all the right parts and all the right places.
Sounds like it.
Yeah.
Tweety's just even Tweety Bird got excited.
Look at that.
This is something happened to him.
I'm afraid I'm wondering what it is.
Now, who's that?
The guy.
Tony.
And the girl.
The audience is loving this, man.
They can't see any of this, but they wish.
Just fantasize for while folks, this is the Deca Fashion Show at Cooper City High.
If I were to know, I would've probably been able to get over there.
Bob, you called us and tried to get us over there, didn't you?
Yeah, you did your best, yeah.
And we wouldn't listen to you.
Oh, that's who?
Oh, you mentioned the name that we can't mention.
Now, who is this kid here with all his clothes off?
Jimmy.
Yeah.
And who's the other one there?
Jimmy and Steve.
And look what Jimmy and Steve are doing there.
It's together as a matter of fact.
That's pretty exciting.
Did you know they used to do mornings on she?
Jimmy and Steve.
Yeah, before Joey.
And they're doing the same thing with each other at Joey and Don Webb.
We're doing it.
I can't believe that.
Okay, we better put the phone back in because this is getting pretty terminal.
For the audience.
Not for us.
Not for us at all.
Okay, let me give that number out.
981-4772.
That is our, oh my god, like I said.
Let's not put that thing back in there too fast.
Good.
Who are those people?
What is his name?
Elliott.
Is Elliott coming to our party next weekend?
These kids today.
Boy, oh boy.
Holy Toledo.
Hello.
Oh, how you doing?
I'm just fine.
It's still in Kendall.
How are you guys?
Hey in Kendall, you had to call long distance, right, Phil?
No problem.
Okay.
I've been ringing for a long time.
It doesn't cost me a cent.
That's for sure.
In fact, if I hung up on you now, look what a cheap collar would be.
Yeah, but it's worth it to me.
Hey, listen.
How's Glendoen?
I'm fine, sir.
How you doing?
I'm doing just fine.
Wow, there's a lot of that girl this morning.
Yeah.
Is that great?
Is that good?
Psychedelics is 60.
Exactly.
Yeah, exactly.
It looks good.
Yesterday, great show.
I got to say Neil.
Yeah.
When you thought that it was a legitimate call, you handled it great.
I thought so, yeah.
I was really impressed.
I loved it.
Great.
Just once, take a morning.
I'm enjoying the show and have a good day.
You too.
Bye-bye.
See, once he did, you know, and he was not going to spend that much money from Kendall.
Look at that Jimmy there.
He's got to say invite his dance or something.
Or something close to it.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
I'm talking to Neil.
You got him.
How you doing, Neil?
Wait a minute.
Is that Elliott sitting down over there to the right?
Boy, that Elliott better show up at that party next week.
Elke?
Oh, Ellie.
What does that mean?
Oh, lol.
Okay, it's an old Thomas, yeah.
Okay, I'm sorry, sir.
I was getting very carried away.
That's okay.
You got to talk a little closer to that speaker phone.
Okay, how's this?
Better?
Yeah, much better.
Okay, how about now?
Oh, that's even better.
How about now?
Yeah, that's even better.
Okay.
How you doing?
Good.
How's it going over there?
It's okay.
Ellie, keep it in line.
Everything's under control and the kids are, you know, hanging out in the bedrooms and everything's fine.
That's good.
Hey, I can get the bird back there.
Oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I want to see you do that again.
I want you to stick your finger.
Now this is good.
Okay, Twiti.
Now, come on.
Come on.
I want to see you stick your finger in the cage.
Okay.
Where's Alan when we need him?
Ha, ha, ha.
Oh, go ahead, sir.
I'm sorry.
I'm getting on the front.
It's a cockatill if you pardon that expression.
Ha, ha, ha.
It's one of the little ones with the feathers sticking out of his head.
You got it, yeah.
Yeah.
The very, very good way to describe it.
How's the other bird doing?
Well, we're hanging out together.
Twiti and I are having a good time.
Yeah, they speak the same language.
Yeah, we have a lot to talk about.
A lot of stories.
And they both dislike Alan with a passion.
Twiti and I are going to be together next weekend.
He's coming down to my house for the weekend.
Good. Well, I'm glad that's the company you're going to have to have.
I had something a little more exciting in mind over here.
Anyway.
Neil.
Yeah.
Yeah, this is great.
I just wanted to wish you a happy Easter and everything else.
Good. And the same to you.
And I hope you find the egg of your choice on the lawn.
No, no, no, no.
Or whatever.
Whatever it is you're looking for.
All right.
See you later.
Take it easy, Neil.
842 on Zeta 4.
And I have this true.
He just gets all popped up and maybe winning his affections away from Big Dave.
And as ordinarily, that's the only person he pays any attention to.
Twiti's had some rather intimate moments with Big Dave.
We'll be hearing about that in the next hour.
Hello.
Hey, still having the trolling contest?
Yes, we are, sir.
Okay.
Joe.
We are.
Very weak.
Come on.
Very weak.
You're a better man.
Try it again.
Yeah, I think.
Yeah.
So cut.
There we go.
I knew he could do it.
Oh, that was much better.
I wish we had a prize to give you.
Maybe we'll give you like Sergio Pereira.
Oh, wow.
Okay.
Or maybe Jorge Valdes, okay?
Jorge.
Jorge.
He has a so far campaign going.
How is it going?
Yeah.
Well, so far so good.
It's so good.
That's good.
Okay.
You're right.
All right.
Yeah, I like you.
You're right on the money, man.
You're right up to the day.
You're on top of it.
I like that.
Yeah.
By the way, they are writing a, they're writing some amendments to the Constitution.
Yeah.
And when they have them all finished, we'll let you know what they say.
Okay.
Okay.
Good luck to you.
All right.
I think that we ought to listen very closely to what he has to say.
Don't you?
Tweety.
Tweety, yeah.
I think some of the most meaningful comments in the morning have come from there.
I'll even leave it in.
Because what are we doing?
Eighth forty-four.
You have to do something.
No, I don't think we, well, I think I'm going to drop a little colder now.
Is that okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I can't take that out.
Where's the sports now?
I want to say, let me get it for you.
John, I'm just going to do this all by itself.
So don't go into a hot lather or anything, but I'm a little confused as to what we're doing.
Which is nothing unusual, right?
Or I should today.
Anyway, if you want the bird selections for drop a little colder, you'll get them exclusively on Zeta 4.
Now, I did this first one on Thursday.
The horse came in last by 28 lengths.
And he picked one yesterday in the second race, which fortunately for him got scratched.
Yeah, I'm doing great.
So he's one for one.
In fact, what was the name of that horse?
Bruce's queen.
No, Bruce the queen.
Bruce the queen.
Maybe Bruce the queen is running today.
A minute.
I'll go there.
No, no, no, no.
Okay, it's a joke.
A minute.
I wonder if Joe Johnson is going to be on that show.
Are you sure this is working out?
Because I can't believe nobody is calling us.
Oh, it's hot.
Or do I have to turn that off?
And then back on.
Are you cereal?
I don't think so.
9-8-1-4-7-7-2.
Hey, listen.
What do I know?
Okay, I'm going to argue with the engineers, right?
Maybe we ran out of calls.
Is that possible?
I don't think so.
No.
Okay.
A caller.
Hello.
Yeah, you're doing great.
I haven't called you the other morning.
He was a religious fanatic of the closet.
Oh, yeah.
And he's informed you there's only partially out.
He was still married.
Yeah.
If the kids and I were surprised to hear that standing in the kitchen.
I bet you were.
Yeah.
Yeah, he was shocked to you, especially, huh?
Yeah.
He's been faking it pretty well.
Uh-huh.
Well, listen, I was wondering.
Dave Caprice is getting all these commercials.
Have anything to do with the strike?
That's a writer's strike.
So it has...
No, there's commercial actors strike.
There are real...
Wow.
So he's making, hey, while the sun's shining.
Probably.
Yeah.
I don't blame him.
I thought about that too.
Yeah.
You want to tell the story that I was pretty good in the band.
See, I want to come over.
Do you?
Yeah.
What's your name?
Sally.
Sally?
Uh-huh.
We like that name.
Yeah.
How old are you, Sally?
Um...
Older but look younger.
Oh, boy.
Like we said, Sally, nice try.
You're hanging on to me.
Okay.
Have a great weekend, Sally.
Yeah.
Bye-bye.
Who's that guy there?
You don't know who the hell he is?
Now, wait a minute.
That looks like Alan there.
Doesn't it look like Alan's twin brother?
Oh, Ricky Jr.
No, he's not Ricky Schroeder.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
I'm trying to call Neil Roger.
You're speaking to him right now.
I am?
I think so.
Hello.
Shoot ahead to the radio on it.
And you got all confused.
Well, don't panic.
That's okay.
So what's up?
Well, weird on the phone.
What's on your mind?
Yeah, we sound like we're far away, right?
Yeah.
Well, we are.
Where are you calling from?
Handle.
Yeah, we're far away.
We're about 45-50 minutes away.
Uh-huh.
I'm calling because I'm off from work.
Great.
I was in two guys every 10.
And I wanted to know, how old is the bird?
Oh my God.
Why do you want to know that?
How old is the bird?
Yeah.
How old is about 15?
No, really.
How old is it?
Now, why do you want to know that?
Because I had a bet with someone that you were...
I thought you were like, how about 29?
Uh-huh.
With 30.
Yeah, you?
And then someone else said, no, no, you're like 45.
Oh, come on.
I'm 45.
Well, that we know.
But I mean...
That we do know.
We didn't know how old he was.
Now, how old do I sound on the air by...
Oh, for me, you sound like you're about 29.
But for the person, they're like, uh, he's about the same age as me.
He's like 45.
No, he's not.
People are always shocked when they meet him in person.
He's a lot older than he sounds.
I am older than I sound.
I will just say this.
I am over 30.
Now, wait a minute.
Who is that?
Hold on one second.
Who's on this end?
James?
James at 10.
James at 15.
I bet you he could make me laugh, yeah.
I'm over 30, man.
What do you think about that?
You're over 30?
I'm under 40.
Under 40 and over 30.
So I'm in my 30s.
I guess we both lost.
Okay, so we'll just let it go.
Yeah, here's somewhere between 30 and 100.
That's right.
All right.
Well, anyway, I think you guys are great.
Thank you.
All right.
Have a nice day.
And have a happy whatever your sound I'm writing, okay?
Okay, thank you.
Bye-bye.
Boy, that James, man, I'll tell you.
Is he coming to the party, Harlem?
What?
What do you mean you have...
Trust me.
In other words, I get to pick everybody who shows up.
Now that L.E. or whatever the hell is his name is, he better be here.
Oh, is this where Alan gets up in the audience?
Wait a minute.
Now, I want the bird to watch very carefully now.
Okay.
Because in just a moment of doing others, Harlem, continuing to pour in on everything
he can get his hands on.
That is...
Yeah, he's definitely going to be at the party.
Okay, if you're ringing right now, just let it keep ringing.
Okay, because we got very important stuff we're concentrating on.
And any second now, Alan is going to get...
Is this coming right here?
Any moment now.
You're going to be so excited.
Yeah.
I'm excited is the word.
I really are.
You're going to become just apoplectic when he comes...
Why not bobbing up out of the audience?
Let's see if he does his usual thing.
Now, look at that gym, boys.
He'll ball a fire or what?
Huh?
He probably can be like the entertainment director at the house next week.
Harlem, is this really...
Now, let me ask you something.
Where did Bob just go?
Oh, she had to leave?
Michelle had to leave, but Bob is coming back, right?
Isn't that kind of interesting?
Huh?
That was very strange.
Now, here comes Alan and just a second out of the audience.
I know you're waiting with Bay the Breath.
Mr. Hill, I know you had to push him back up.
There he is.
There he is right there.
You couldn't miss him in a million years.
Shake it as booty, less like Casey.
And...
Somebody pushed him away.
Harlem told him to get the hell out of the...
Get the hell out of here.
Harlem pushed him away.
Don't you think Harlem deserves the next to you?
Harlem, we have to shake hands, if you want.
We have to do the news now.
Yesterday, you were muscling in and Bob, now you're moving on to Harlem.
What's going to be next?
Neil Rogers, the Rock and Roll monster.
Okay, it's 8.57 on Zeta 4, and here...
Can you believe it?
We only got a little over an hour to go.
Really?
Yeah.
Is that right?
Holy.
We've already done three hours?
Seems like only like two days ago we sat down here on the sofa.
Maybe we could play funeral for a friend.
And the possibilities is coming by with lunch, which is going to be one of the highlights.
We're really sorry that Michelle had to go to work, but I guess it's a matter of time.
No, no, no, she had to go get her nails done.
That's who I want to know.
Who's...
Kenny Rogers.
Is he really?
I see that he's going to be here next week.
Michelle didn't have to go to work.
What is he going like that?
What does that mean?
He wouldn't show up.
And he's busy, right?
I didn't understand that he's busy.
Michelle had to go get her nails done.
Oh, she had to go get her nails done.
It's a priorities.
Now you understand?
For what?
For like the Easter?
Yeah.
Good.
Good.
You're not going to model your bathing suit.
Just go in swimming.
I mean, nobody's going to molest you because we're busy in here.
Maybe later.
Okay, anyway, I guess we should take some more calls.
The only way to do that is if we plug it back in, right, Harlan?
You're in charge of the jack.
Hello.
Yeah.
Right?
Yes, sir.
Hello?
Yeah.
Yeah, go ahead.
Speak to us.
Okay.
I want to know about the TV's movie.
The TV's Cage movie.
About today.
Yeah, it opens today, Bright Light's Big City with Michael Bay Fox.
I'm not going to be able to see it today, sir, because I'm tied up and I don't think my heart will take it anyway.
Why that you have gotten to miss the notice, huh?
Not on this one.
I'll probably see it Monday.
Oh.
Yeah, you're going to go see it today?
I was hoping.
Yeah, I heard you chopped up our hair.
Well, she did that while back, but did you see the ads on TV for the film?
Yeah, yeah.
She's all through it, all through the ads.
And in the music video by Brian Ferry, which is the theme song of the movie,
who you heard me, Michael J. Fox kisses her and then takes her to bed.
Jumps her, yeah.
Yes, he does.
Yeah, that's pretty ridiculous.
Shocking.
Shocking.
Nothing will ever happen there.
What about me, Shell?
She's going to the BBC.
I read yesterday in there.
Inbisees.
Oh, I was.
I don't know if it was the BBC.
I'm going to cross down the other side of the wall or something.
Yeah, no, she's going to New York.
Is she still going to be winking or?
Yeah, maybe we'll see her on the network.
I'm panpping her.
Neil is just like, God off this videotape.
I'm curious who that is.
Who is, oh, it's Ellie again.
Yeah, he's definitely going to be here.
I was in charge of how that.
I mean, get the heck out of town.
Yeah.
And takes her wink with her, OK?
OK, I'll let you know where I'll try to see TV.
This weekend, I'll let you know what's that Monday.
Appreciate it.
I'll be up, but I'll let you know.
I'm sure that before Monday, no doubt.
OK.
She'll ask.
What?
8.59 WZTA Miami Beach for Lauderdale and the Palm Beachers.
Tara and Bob together in still.
Unbelievable.
And I have a feeling somebody we know, it was probably not too happy at the end of this particular scene here when the Bob just grabs.
Tara by her bodily parts.
Wait till you see this.
I'm telling you, wait until you see what goes on at the Inbise, little scenario there.
Not just arm and arm, but there's isn't it right here that it goes on down down on the floor.
That is a lot worse.
So if Michelle hasn't seen this tape yet, yes, she left just in the neck a time.
Yeah.
I wonder he got around it here.
He knew this part of the tape.
I got to be your nails done, honey.
Look at this.
Oh, I'm the floor.
Even if she got this.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm so upset.
I touched the ball.
Is it a baseball cream or a beer?
Okay, that's Mr. Conway calling it back.
I can't believe it.
Finally, finally, finally admitted that old coach Conway pennony asked junior.
I did the idea just now.
Didn't I?
No, you didn't.
I didn't say $8.59 a WZT in Miami Beachport.
Oh, that terror was on the tape.
Oh, and you were distracted.
I understand.
Just like when LE came on the tape.
Ah, this is a show.
Why does he say that?
He said like, so you don't know.
But we say it like with such a degree of happiness.
See, the problem with Bob is he can't make up his mind.
Like, one minute he's running away.
And in the next minute, it's like, how come you're not molesting me?
You know something like that?
He just can't quite make up his mind.
I hear it.
Hello.
Oh, yeah.
Hi, this is Patty Murray.
Yeah, Patty, how you doing?
We good.
You're in good voice today, Patty.
This is the best you've sounded in months.
No, you just left me up a little bit of God.
This is Brad.
Did you just wake up Brad?
Did you think I'm out of bed?
Yeah.
Oh, OK, I didn't know I thought my room was kidding me.
No, he called here and asked that we do something for you.
And I said, that's the best we can do by long distance.
Oh, really?
Today's is all Sunday's my birthday.
I was kind of hoping you could have the album come over and give me a spanking or something.
Unfortunately, he's out of town, sir.
And he said to that, I don't think so.
Where'd you find Lecule?
Way long ways away.
I think the bird would like to give out of his spanking.
If you know what I mean.
You know what I want to say.
That's the first time I watched that picture.
What a great movie.
You did it.
We were watching it here too.
Well, he's I was watching it here.
Where that three-time trial hole.
I know.
That look at Howard.
God.
Yeah, there were some very interesting overtones to that flick.
Yeah, no kidding.
Not here at Cleedy and the back down there.
Yeah, even the bird got excited when he heard about C. Tom Hall.
I thought it was.
Yeah, I was calling too.
You look pretty great, Johnny.
You know, we got those cleaned over QWN6.
That's just dope.
Oh, boy.
Next thing.
Next thing you'll be talking about.
Okay.
I'd like to talk.
Okay.
Good luck to you, sir.
Okay.
I was going to say next thing you'll be talking about Jack Steudy,
but he made sure I couldn't say it.
Yeah, no wax.
No, I mean, by the way.
Okay, let me give this number out just in case,
because it is still ringing.
But there is only one line.
Just for today only, 981-4772.
981-4772.
Bob and Holland are going to be getting undressed in just a couple of minutes.
So you want to stick around for that?
Yeah, I can't.
What?
You're still in for Captain Dave today?
Is that what you're doing?
Because Captain Dave's not here so hard.
Oh, I see he's giving signals.
No food.
I'll go ahead.
He'd have to storm because he's in up there for like 80 people.
Hello.
Yeah, how you doing?
Great.
You doing bird?
Fine, sir.
How are you?
I was going to give him a message to tweet.
Yes, sir.
No, not tweet.
Not you.
No, it's in the cage.
Yeah.
All right.
Go ahead.
Wait a minute.
Turned his head and he said I couldn't agree more.
He is.
He's going bananas.
Okay.
Good luck to you, sir.
All right, Neil.
Okay.
See, we finally got a guess that the audience can communicate with.
See, I think that was for me, but whatever.
He said it was for a tweet.
I think it was actually for me.
Now, there's something pretty interesting about the way that the bird is reacting.
I'm talking about the one in the cage.
Because usually when the phone rings, he just goes crazy.
He like, the footers all over and bangs against the side of the cage and almost kills himself.
And this phone man, he's very mellow.
You know what I said?
Well, he knows who's on it.
Is that what it is?
Hello.
Hello, is this Neil?
I think so.
You know, remember when you suggested that, you know, rainfly would be because, uh,
race for the, uh, at the corner.
Oh, yeah.
Well, no, see, we're on a streak now.
We're picking horses that finished last.
Very helpful.
Yeah.
I wanted to, um, I to win something.
I was not my dad going down there and take it from me, but thank God we didn't go down to my amus.
No, wait a minute.
What was this yesterday?
No, the other day you picked it, remember?
No, no, I didn't pick that.
A ran fly.
That was the bird.
Yeah.
I picked it and it came in last by 27 lives.
Don't leave that one in my doorstep, okay?
Are you, have you ever driven on a template, uh, like two days ago, were you on a template?
Have I ever driven on a turnpike?
Not in the last, no, not, not two days ago now.
No, okay.
Why?
All right, listen, I'm calling from Buffalo.
I'm calling, you know, just one of the cars, say hello.
Great.
Okay, now listen, I've got some good tips for you next week, okay?
I think I'll be listening.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
First one is stay away from all those places.
Uh, no, as a matter of fact, I wasn't on a turnpike.
I was eating at Denny's on Biscayne in 125.
Okay, with Mother Rogers, you know, we're discussing, uh, the track, as a matter of fact,
he said, we're all big cars.
And, yeah, we were asking for a parliament light.
Now, where, where's Ellie?
Is he making a comeback or is it Jimmy that comes back on here later?
He's on his side.
That sounds pretty exciting.
He's on his side.
Let him let it go ahead and ring.
We like the sound effect, Amy.
Uh, hello.
Hello?
Yes.
Hi.
Hi.
Who's this?
Barbara.
Barbara?
Hmm?
He's on the tip from the phone.
I know that's what they all say, Barbara.
Um, when you went to E-Mac and Bolly, I was, um, we were getting a little bit left to you
and we started at Biscayne.
Um, because, um, all of the people were pushing on my brother's girlfriend.
Do you remember that?
Oh, yeah.
That was us.
Yeah, it was right when I got there.
Remember?
Yeah.
And I stepped in the middle of that and I thought, boy, here we go.
We're going to have a riot on our hands.
What was that all about?
That was us.
And, um, do you still, um, not like BCB students?
No, we love BCC.
Since they took the latest poll and we came out on top, we love BCC.
Especially the...
My brother goes to BCC and he idolizes me.
Now, which campus?
White?
Which campus?
Um, South.
South.
Yeah, that's where we're big.
Uh-huh.
With the other y'all who's over there in, uh, Davey or wherever it is, we're not too big with them.
What do you idolize with you?
Well, I don't blame him.
How old's your brother?
18.
18.
What does he look like, Barbara?
Well, he...
He has brown hair.
He's...
He's weird looking.
He's weird looking.
Yeah.
How would you mean by that?
I don't know.
But what does that mean?
Weird looking.
In other words, he's not exciting looking.
He's not ironic?
Well, you wouldn't like him.
Okay, I got you a message, Barbara.
We'll listen, tell him we said hello.
Okay.
But don't invite him to the party, okay?
Okay.
Thanks, Barbara.
Bye-bye.
Sorry about that.
She was honest though.
Brutally honest.
Brutally.
Brutally.
That's what we like.
I know seven, I'd say to four.
You're a brutally honest station.
That's it.
Now, who's that?
James.
James and Ellie are going to be here in the party.
In fact, you've got a spot picked up for them already.
James and Ellie are going to be there.
Huh?
James and Ellie have to do that.
To see what?
Hold.
Don't say that anymore.
Don't say it on your words, okay?
We don't have a dump button.
We don't have a dump button.
We don't have a dump button.
Yeah, you can point.
Don't say, all right?
Just don't say.
Oh my god.
It was, yeah.
Yeah.
What he said began with a D.
Yeah.
Okay.
And it was pointing at the big day.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Anyway, let's move right along here.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
I can't believe it's finally got through.
Okay.
In time in these halls, just trying to, when they're staying to buy, I don't know what to do.
I know it's brutal.
Believe me, I just can't cope with it myself.
It's been days.
I've been trying to tell you a few days ago, you when you said clayfish,
there you were having those.
Yeah.
They're crawdaddies.
And then you're talking about coaches.
You had a hard time yesterday with one.
We went to South Broward.
And the problem with our coach was, his name was Coach Boyland, which he is dead now.
He used to make us jump for towels.
Jump for towels.
Coming out of the shower, he used to make us jump for towels.
Really?
Really, that's that South Broward high.
Yeah.
Why do you know that South Broward mentality, don't you?
Yeah.
What do you think he got a pleasure out of watching this somehow, some perverse, uh, something or other?
Does he have to draw you a diagram?
No, I just thought I had that.
Does he have to draw you a roadmap?
I just thought I would ask to see what he said.
Yeah, the best woman in the state.
Yeah, that's the answer I was looking for.
Well, that was the end of the tape or the kids now at the shopping at the restaurant.
Look at us, here are the kids from Cooper City shopping at Exeter.
I can't believe it.
Unbrewed.
Shoplifting, no less.
Yeah.
Just a joke.
I know.
Well, listen, it's great hearing from you.
And that's quite a story, but there are a lot of stories like that.
As a matter of fact, somewhere in the radio highlights today, somebody is doing a show.
I think it's Paul Lyle, doing one of his farewell shows.
Uh-huh.
One of his, and the topic was, uh, Ann Galer, author of The Trail of Trust about clergy abuse of children.
That's one of my old guests, by the way, Ann Galer of the Freedom from Religion Foundation in Madison, Wisconsin.
Lyle is just like the old Neil Man.
The only difference is the new Neil is still on the air, okay?
Yeah, I thought you picked it today in the paper.
Did you really?
Isn't that exciting?
Uh, older than Muthu's low, okay?
No, really, seriously.
How old is it?
Yeah.
Well, wait a minute.
Let me look at it again, see which one it is.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Is it over there?
Right there.
That's it.
Let me, uh, underneath the cinnamon roll.
Yeah, underneath the cinnamon roll.
That picture is like five years old.
Four years old.
I hear it.
Oh my god.
So you have less hair now?
No, about the same.
Oh really?
Yeah.
See, there are my head is tilted to it.
Looks like I've got some.
I've been trying to call you for days because, uh, all my friends call me, uh, King of the Route-Out.
So they compare me with you?
Really?
Yeah.
Why?
In honor.
Route-Out, you can relate to that.
In other words, you haven't got any hair.
Oh, I have, I don't know why people say that.
I'm not a bald.
I don't need it.
I have a huge bald spot, but that's if you're looking from the top down, what the hell are you, you know, what are you doing anyway?
I don't think it's huge.
But, uh, might be looking for a beard.
No, or the bald spot.
My old bald turned me on to you.
A bald.
Yeah.
All the bald guys, sir, listen to the show, man.
Once they get bald, they turn the show right in.
Oh, yeah.
But they're hoping it'll happen again.
Yeah, because everybody has a hard time and he loses hair on his own.
Okay, well, listen, have a great weekend.
Okay.
And don't lose any sleepover, okay?
All I want.
Okay.
So a little fast, what can you say?
Right.
Okay.
All right.
Like I said, they're hoping they're going to get bald again.
But anyway, it's 9-11 on Zeta 4 and, uh, let's see.
What do we got to do?
20?
Yeah, we're okay.
We don't have to worry about that, uh, pain in the ass, John, back there at the station where it was thought.
Now, John's okay.
He's a good guy, but, uh, you know, a little confused.
He's still playing at 60s, esoteric cuts that nobody ever heard.
Hello.
Hi.
How you doing?
Great.
I'm the first time calling my name's Richard.
Yeah, Richard.
Uh, what, what people are you winning the hell?
In the Broward edition of the hell?
Where you live, Richard?
North Miami Beach.
North Miami Beach.
Well, if you just go like across the line, you know, like the Hellendale.
I know that's a dangerous thing to say.
But if you go to Hellendale real quick like.
Yeah.
And you go into one of the vending boxes, get a Broward edition of the hero, other, uh, Miami hero.
It's on page two in a Broward section.
Oh, okay.
With a picture and everything.
I think my fingers up my nose and a whole business.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's, um, the burger.
I'm here.
How you doing?
Fine.
How you doing?
Uh, not bad.
Yeah.
What the hell old are you?
Yeah, 15.
Are you?
So, uh, you had a school for, uh, the holidays?
And the fire.
Yeah.
Yeah, little.
Little.
You're getting second one.
They teachers.
They teachers.
Gay.
Gay teachers.
Yeah.
All your teachers are gay.
Yep.
Really?
Are they molesting?
You're six third teachers.
You're six third teachers.
You're six third teachers.
He molesting you?
Yep.
Really?
Are you enjoying it?
No, when he keeps yaps of scores, gets you right up.
Oh my god.
Oh my goodness.
Oh.
You got a great sense of humor with you.
I'll tell you.
Have a great weekend now.
Okay, if you let it in.
Bye-bye.
You believe that?
I like this.
What a comedian.
Yeah, I like this.
What a clown.
It's a 9-12 on Zeta 4.
Gonji's going to be knocking on a door almost any minute.
And you're going to answer the door, Dave.
And you know what to say.
Okay.
Yeah, that'll be great.
You have to be more than just a disc jockey to get into Uncle Neil's house.
Yeah.
That'll be great.
And slam the door at his face.
Okay.
Hello.
Hi.
Pulling from the, where I found each.
Wait.
I've got a question for you.
My, uh, we're familiar to you all the time.
Yes.
And you were talking about a restaurant in Allen Town a few weeks ago.
Oh, yeah.
Well, they have some hot dogs with hot sauce or something.
Hots and red hot.
No, no.
White hots is a done of Bob's and Rochester.
But up at Allen Town, I have like it's called Y-Yakos.
Y-Yakos.
Yeah.
That's an end of it.
I'm from up around there.
He's asking me and I'm like, I don't know.
I never heard of the place.
Tell him it's Y-Yakos.
Where did that at, Ellen Town?
I haven't got any idea.
I don't know anything about Allen Town, but we used to have this, um, we used to have this
newsman who was from Allen Town and that's all he knew how to talk about was Y-Yakos and
hot dogs.
Oh, and I wait a minute.
I gotta see this.
I gotta wait a minute.
Somebody's at my front door.
Please, flipping out.
Look at Tweety flip out.
See it?
Flippin out.
It's food.
Thanks a lot.
Whoever that is.
Now, so anyway, getting back to Allen Town.
Tweety is loaded.
As long as you said Allen Town, the bird in here went nuts.
Tweety.
Not the bird.
Who wanted the cage?
Yeah, it was the word Allen, exactly.
See that word Allen does that to him.
Well, listen, have a wonderful life.
Well, I'm trying.
It's not easy.
And give your boyfriend a big kiss for us, okay?
Wouldn't that?
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
I'm the police.
You send that.
Yeah.
You can pull it out real quick because the walk-in just sent over, uh, their implantation,
pepper pines, and Delray Beach.
How do they know where you live?
The walk-in creative gourmet joint.
Instead, you know what a gourmet joint is?
Anyway.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
They're all kinds of Chinese, too.
So this is like our course between now and, uh, this is brunch.
This is brunch.
Yeah, in fact, like Mother Rogers and I have brunch every now and then at Denny's.
All right.
And talk about Sunday.
Yeah, talk about Sunday.
Why don't you guys start opening that and see what it is?
Why don't you take it into the kitchen?
You don't need to force your cookies first.
No, don't listen to him.
Open it here so I can look at it.
All right.
Then you can take it into the kitchen.
I want to get a little peak.
I want to get a little.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
That is a good question.
How the hell did they know where we were?
I'm here.
This is getting to be a little, look at that.
You took the cover off.
There's another cover there.
That looks incredible.
In fact, this guy's got a sense of humor.
Now, what is that?
And I just have a little taste in it.
And I was like, chicken.
Yeah.
Looks real good.
Mmm.
I was good.
I don't know what it is.
Still moving.
Okay.
You can put it on the kitchen.
He's right.
This is going to get disgusting again.
Okay.
Now, what show?
Wait a minute.
We got to turn on 10, don't we?
Oh, Donahue.
Because Donahue has the Pygmy Transsexuals on today.
And this ought to be really good.
Another one of his short subjects.
There you go.
Okay.
Let's, we can plug that back in.
It's 15 past nine on Zeta 4.
And we're going to be here all day.
I mean, like we're not going to be here.
We'll be doing other things.
But Gonzer is going to be on.
Got only those what that's going to be all about.
And lead you right from three to seven.
And what they're going to be doing.
Who knows?
Nobody knows.
Just have to tune in and find out just like we are.
You have not a clue.
Well, it is a good question.
How do the guy from the walk in know where we live?
Is a good question.
Is this a good name?
What?
That was in there?
Yeah.
What is it?
What is it?
What is that?
There's the doorbell again.
Yeah.
But it's a frantic ring.
You notice?
Yeah.
Very, very frantic.
Are we unplugged in?
Yes, it is.
We are.
Hello.
How are you doing?
Pretty good.
How are you doing?
Great.
I'm in Daytona about a week ago.
I'm getting ready to drive onto the beach where they charge $2 or $4 depending on the size
of your vehicle.
You never guess who just walked in the door in my house.
Casey, I can't believe it.
How are you doing, Casey?
This is the way to do it.
Harry Wayne.
Harry Wayne, just walked in.
How are you doing?
Right to see it.
Where are I doing it?
I'm just pulling up a seat over there or whatever and we'll do it.
By the way, what are you?
John's got that record back at the station.
I think so.
Go ahead, sir.
I'm sorry to step on your line.
I don't know if I'm at all.
So, I'm waiting to get drive onto the beach.
And there's this little booth where you pay to get onto the beach.
And there's this car with a little trailer on the back that is trying to turn around so it
can get back out.
Obviously somebody who wasn't paying.
Yeah.
So I can hold the traffic for like a mile.
And as they finally start to get it out, I see these 1080 and license plates on it.
Here from Ontario.
When I get up to the booth, I ask the guy what had happened and he said these
Canadians come down and they say all they have is Canadian currency.
Where a check.
The checks are no good.
They can't take the Canadian currency.
So it's the way of trying to sneak onto the beach for free.
Yeah.
No big surprise with more ideas from the Canadians.
This is for sure.
Yeah, well, you know, let's just send them all back.
Okay.
That's my idea.
Anyhow, since you only have one line, I'm going to be able to hold on just a second.
All right.
Okay.
What is he doing there?
He puts us on hold?
I like being put on hold.
Do you?
Man, it's in the great distance.
There was a lot of time.
I like it.
40,000 people on hold.
Oh, he's hooking us up with somebody.
Three way calling.
That's a good go to the house.
Oh, it's Amy.
We're just going to spread.
Oh, yeah, spread.
Well, he looks right down the street.
So let's leave him out of this right now.
Casey, so what's going on?
He's watching.
He's watching.
He's watching Donny, you man.
So in other words, you got to come over here to watch TV.
Those stories are true, right?
I guess they are.
How you doing, Neil?
I'm doing pretty good.
Nice place.
Isn't this isn't bad, huh?
Some of the words next time.
Not bad for about 500 square feet.
What's that?
Oh, you got a fortune for me, Bob?
I think I get a good fortune.
Okay.
What does it say?
Don't speculate in new ideas at the cost of your reputation.
Oh, that's yours, Bob.
No, that was yours.
In fact, look at that.
That don't just disappear.
And it says speculate in new ideas.
So Bob and I have some things to do.
Casey, to take care of why you're here.
So I'm going to leave him.
But we're going to go on the other end of the house
and have a long chat.
Just a joke.
He just gets so nervous these guys.
Yeah.
He understood what I'm talking about.
So anyway, you've had a staff all night in order to make it here.
Yeah.
We figured that.
Yeah.
This is just like the old days on Tanner's show, right?
We never did a house.
No, you never did show him Tanner's house.
No, that's because there was no room in his house for a...
You're a bad boy.
I am.
Well, we speak the truth on this show.
I know about that house.
I know that.
So anyway, you got a new record out.
Yeah.
Which...
But it's not out yet.
But it's coming out.
You did?
Yeah.
Why, they couldn't understand it anyway.
So what's he getting trouble telling?
Hey, we were playing that record.
It was something else.
It was George McCray, you know.
George McCray, he's in Canada.
Is it really?
Doing what?
Was he running from the IRS reporter?
He's getting royalties, yeah.
I don't blame him.
Well, all the people that did disco are in Canada now except KC.
I don't get ready to move there.
No.
Come on.
Things like that, man.
I'm in the Bahamas.
What, you're leaving us?
Sure.
Why, just because they kicked you out of your house?
You're not saying the other day everybody in the days and war on.
Oh, yeah.
That is true.
You don't have to go to the Bahamas.
You just moved to Broward, like up around here.
It's some cease and nice homes.
Lakes, water.
The whole business up here.
Foliage, birds.
This makes you feel at home, doesn't it, KC?
The bird?
That's Tweety, by the way.
He likes you.
I don't have any birds.
No, right now.
You don't?
No, they're in storage.
The bird's in storage.
What do you want to do?
You want to be in storage, like in a freezer or something?
I don't have any bird in storage.
All right.
You take one of this place and they warehouse.
They warehouse it.
Is something for you to know?
I lost one of them.
Oh, really?
There's a one-eat-a-soup.
There's a liver problem or something.
Good old one-eat-a-soup.
Yeah, a little too much.
Yeah, that liver goes, yeah.
Yeah.
It's supposed to feed him water, KC.
Not Jim.
Okay.
Did you hear that, Willie?
So anyway, this record is coming out when.
Are we going to play it now?
Did we arrange this right?
For once?
Did we do something right on Zeta?
No.
Because Peter Volder promised me that, did you give him the cassette?
Somebody give him the cassette?
No.
No.
Of course not.
So this got out to a Jew or something.
I have no idea.
How many finished the damn thing?
Can I see that?
Yeah, you get damn it.
There are a few other S words in the F words.
That's correct.
Well, there are a couple of others in there.
But we'll let you know after you say it.
I know the A words are right.
Yeah.
It's a hard part.
It's okay.
Hard part.
So in other words, I think you played on the earth the other day was what?
Like a rough.
Yeah, it's like a roughness of the two I'd done.
That done?
Two you'd done, yeah.
The two I'd done would be a hot man.
Now what did they took his house away?
And it's becoming like your literate, you know?
And they gave it back to me, what can I say?
Oh, did they?
Oh yeah.
Everything is okay now.
Sure.
It's all except no matter what.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Tell us.
We don't want to pry.
So what?
No, don't say it.
So this was a work in progress?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I had about four of the cuts done.
Mm-hmm.
I think Dan Hart was going to finish it on them.
Oh.
Mm-hmm.
That was good.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That was all of a stuff coming out of this hole, you know?
Uh-huh.
He sits back on a couch like this as a mixing board and does the whole thing.
This is real comfortable.
It's interesting to me.
All these people that run around with these bumpers, tickets, and things.
We're in a studio that's a disco sucks.
And if you listen to your friend Tanner and the Duh-Hot 105, that's all the kids they are listening to is disco.
That's scratch music is nothing more than 80s disco.
Yeah.
It's pretty so.
Yeah.
I never got sucked by disco.
Only more mindless.
But we don't want to go into that.
All of it.
If you want to talk about it.
No, it's even more mindless than some of that repetitious disco stuff from the 70s, right?
We don't want to mention a song.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was pretty mindless.
What was it?
Shake it.
Shake it.
It was fun.
You knew the title of the song.
That's correct.
That's the idea.
Because you didn't have a lot of dumb kids.
Right.
You just keep repeating the title.
Oh.
You might as well do that.
You might as well do that.
That's the way I highlight it.
So that guy from New York never got a hold of you.
The one that was desperately trying to get in touch.
For those millions of bucks that he said he wanted to lay at your doorstep.
What?
You have the number?
I think Peter Bogey took the number home.
What about Eric Caprito?
One of the other.
Peter Caprito.
Did you send the number over to me?
Yeah.
You could use it.
Peo Box 4307.
So what have you been doing all this time?
I mean, it's like you kind of like disappeared from the face of the earth.
I kind of went into retirement.
I decided that was relaxed.
I've been through a hell of a lot.
You went into retirement.
I'm writing a book.
Yeah.
That would be good.
Especially now would be a good time to do it.
It's called, make me a star.
It holds truth and nothing but the truth.
No, you're not writing a book.
Yeah.
Are you really?
When is it coming out?
It's got an album.
I'm an auditor.
You've got a book coming out when it gets around to it.
Yeah.
That's just an idea I've had for a long time.
And probably a fiction was the last chapter, you know what I mean.
So this is the last chapter.
You know, a grand finale.
Well, I did the hero as they usually do.
Did they twist and distort that?
Was there a lot of crap in that story?
You know, you know, I mean, El Hero.
El Hero.
Yeah, our Spanish language newspaper.
Oh, yeah.
It's not a fact.
They would just pick up things.
Hello.
Oh, look at that.
That's the guy from the hero right now.
I can't believe it.
It's not a fact.
They picked up things.
You know, there are articles or whatever.
And I'm not being sued by the hospitals or anything like this.
It's not bankrupt.
You know, you used to do marketing, I believe,
from Mel Haver, a son mortgage company.
No.
It's Gonser.
Did you work for it?
No.
I don't even know who that is.
No.
He said he'd be remembered you.
Look at his Gonser is here.
Can you believe it?
With a camera.
With a video camera.
What are you doing with a video camera now doing porn?
I'm just going to be a great shot.
Yeah, I just thought that we would just kind of commemorate the occasion.
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Oh, is that the fortune cookie?
Yeah, we're having a fortune cookie and little Chinese.
Hey, Brad, I'm using the chair for your fortune.
I want Casey to open his up first.
Yeah, this should be real good, Casey.
I'll open mine too.
See what happens.
25 times time.
Well, wait for a break and John is having a nervous breakdown.
Oh, that's his problem.
Mostly sunny, high 80 low 70, 75.
Right, sunny day.
What does that mean?
That was the weather.
High 80 low 70, 75.
And you think he's going to hit a break when you do that?
Oh, no, no, I just want to get to it.
I'll look for a drink.
Your wish will be granted next year.
Is that what it says?
Well, at least I'll be allowed in a year.
It's already almost April.
Yeah, so next April, my wish will be granted.
It's not too bad.
She's got a long time to wait.
That would just genuine me.
I waited a lot longer than that, Casey.
I don't like that.
That which is genuine needs no explanation.
I think that has to do with Alan, no doubt.
No doubt.
Yeah, you can go explain.
No doubt about it.
Are these all bad ones?
I think that got from the walk in is trying to be careful of extravagance.
That's obvious.
I don't even have another one here.
Spur of the moment decision would be,
Oh, now here's a good one for Holland.
Here's a good one for Holland.
The moment decision brings surprising result.
Where did he go to?
Did he disappear?
Yeah, he left the room after he gave me that.
Well, I didn't know it.
You should go.
This is from the mine toy.
They don't drive.
Sun's five.
He's the one that's really.
That's great.
Fantastic.
Excellent.
Well, I'll see you're finally getting, you know, you're finally finding the right spots on the down, getting off that old stale crap.
You know what I mean?
You know what I'm trying to tell you, KC?
I'll bet you don't.
I'll bet you don't.
I always push the buttons, Leo.
Yeah, we're not.
I just don't like to say any word.
We're not going to mention any names.
You know, you know, you got a lot of friends in a business or at least used to.
You know, when you're on top of the word, you have a lot of friends and then all of a sudden when these stories come out, then it's like KC who?
Yeah, I will ask you about there.
That's right.
When the time comes around again, man, we'll be here waiting.
Bags full of money.
Whoa.
Yeah.
Or a little like even a little satchel, you know, like Dave Riner hired me at ING and now that he's making all this money with these phone numbers, you know, 976 douche bags.
What's that stuff like that?
That's Dave Riner.
He's got all of those things and we keep making 96 Wakes.
Exactly.
$4 is $4.
976 Wakes you all.
All those numbers.
Yeah.
Jesus.
That's what I said.
They got 976 Jesus to as a matter of fact.
And he just we keep telling him, you know, just a bag or two full of money every week and he just teal apps, you know, that's me 976 Oprah, right?
Yeah.
Oh my God.
It's a matter of fact.
We're going to take a break now so we can watch the transvestite pigmies on a Donahue show this morning.
He's got, no, it's incredible.
Look at that.
I can't believe it.
It was like reaching down to the floor with him.
Anyway, it's 928 on Zeta 4 and we'll come back from my house right after this.
He is in that bag and bag on the floor with all the CDs and a storage company in the black.
Oh yeah.
It's a clear, it's a clear CD.
Yeah.
God.
How do you know that he hasn't found it?
He's down to so far.
Coffee.
It's right right up there.
Are we getting out of hand here like I mean, people in the painting friends, he since Gonjigot here, man, it's like, yeah, everyone's going nuts.
You know what I'm saying?
Everything was so calm.
All these people that talk about that music like it was garbage.
You know, there are a lot of people who say that.
Like, disco is all sucked and it was garbage and mindless and that must really piss you off.
Yeah, well, you know, take the good with the badge.
You know, lots of talking about me.
I don't care.
Is that it?
Just like me.
Michael Jackson didn't think it was too bad.
Yeah.
Just like me.
All of he be bad.
He's bad.
You know, I'm your boogie man.
Same record.
So why don't you sue him?
He's got three billion dollars.
I'll clear that.
You know, what friends I could do?
Your friends with Michael Jackson?
Are you serious?
Sure.
Well, now you must have a lot of questions.
Do you want to ask him about that?
No, no, I can't ask for anything.
I have a story.
He's got to get married.
I have a story for you, Kate.
To what?
Looking for it.
About Michael Jackson.
He's getting married to the elephant man.
Is that a true story?
One of his giraffes, I think.
I got you.
What is my story?
I can't find it.
Okay?
Something like that.
Yeah.
It's not here.
Now, did anybody take part of my US pay today?
I don't think so.
Hold on.
Oh, that's the one with the crumbs on it.
Yeah.
What happened to that US pay today?
I had to get the other part that had the crumbs on it.
Could you pay respect to US today with the crumbs on it?
Yeah.
Where's the part of the paper with the crumbs on it?
The life section, the purple section.
Nine in the blink of an eye.
Thirty-eight on Zeta 4.
And we're a little out of control here.
Because somebody stole part of it.
Oh, they threw it out.
I appreciate that.
Anyway, this is about the time I get this.
It's going to be not worth it.
But Al Yankovic, you know, weird Al Yankovic.
He's got a record coming out and it's a parody of Michael Jackson's big hit.
That it's called Even Worse.
And it features a, it says the video will feature a letter and buckles clad Yankovic.
And the rumor has it lyrics that say, I'm fat.
I'm fat.
Oh, that's good.
Yeah.
I don't know what for me like that.
I don't know about that.
That'd be real big.
How big?
No, but anyway, so you're really, and you're not just making it up.
You're tight with Michael Jackson.
Now, what is with this thing about his appearance?
I mean, is he lost it?
When you get that much money, you just kind of like freak out.
Because it seems like he just doesn't know what to do with it.
I don't remember.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess I'm asking a wrong person, right?
No, seriously, it's like, what is with this face and with the body like he's trying to piece it?
He's like Dr. Frankenstein and reverse, you know?
I think you had a different idea.
I think that the surges and stuff, you know, they might have messed up a little bit.
I think it was sort of tough.
Yeah, you know, really?
Yeah.
Like a mannequin.
Yeah.
Well, you know, they use the same doctor.
So, you know, I don't want to name any names.
They all look alike.
These days.
Yeah, they all do.
I want to, in fact, what was that thing?
Was it in the USA?
The sale was in the herald.
It was in the herald about Michael and the two sisters and how they all look the same and had the pictures and how the faces.
It looks like they all went to the same plastic surgeon.
They put all the pieces in the plastic.
Marlin has it.
Marlin.
Marlin Jackson.
He's still the same.
Yeah.
He's still the same there.
A song, still the same.
Still the same.
Yeah.
Something like that.
So, anyway, I would have met.
Now, what happened when that story came out?
Did a lot of people rediscover you?
The one that we've been talking about?
That's okay.
Johnald doesn't put it out.
That's the sheets, man.
Yeah.
And he lives in Hylia.
And I thought, no, I tried to draw my back.
Yeah.
Every Friday they have a lot of sheets.
Is that glorious, papan?
Who is that at the door?
Wait a minute.
Okay, see this could be one of your big fans now.
Yeah.
Could be Perry, to Syria.
Who, Terry?
So, guys, you must be a part of things you want to talk to.
Should we go in?
No.
No.
I must have talked to us about what?
What?
What is having a room?
Well, he should, I think.
Yeah.
How you doing?
You?
Yeah.
Hey, Sam, how are you?
I'm fine.
Thank you.
You're a crack.
I know.
We really are crack.
Exactly.
He, well, he deserved it.
And he's Stanley?
Well, that's great.
So, what do you do for the city of plantation?
I don't know.
But, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You're a great person.
I'm sorry.
So, Yeah.
He's just taking a little break.
Now, I'm stuck out.
Now, how did you know where?
I don't know.
Okay, we know what it is.
Yeah.
It looks your boss knows that Stanley is taking a break right now.
It gets ten minutes.
Yeah.
So, how did you know where we lived, Stanley?
You found the place yesterday.
What do you?
I got the room dialed.
Oh, you got the run down on it. How do you like that? Oh, in other words, he was probably listening to that show where they're giving our address on the phone number two size
Yeah, I would think so only that ain't my real name okay, so but that's all right. That probably Tony or Roger in other words just to be sure
Thank you Stanley. You know Casey. Hey, see the sunshine bad exactly. Bougie shoes
Get down tonight get down tonight
You hear that okay, well who's over there John's over there John here that John what we're gonna do is to like it about 10 o'clock

The six maneuver and that's a long cut in it. Yeah, good. There's five oh six five oh six point. Look at that
He spits it right out. He knows those like you can just see those checks coming in. Yeah, that's the bird
That's right Stanley guys
Yeah, she's better tail
Yeah, given that old wrap craft
Yeah, I forgot he flashed me back ten years. I think you should get real that hat. Yeah, yeah
I want a city of plantation headets at least they could do it all the water I'm using in this house
I'm the most humongous water bill that you ever saw in your life. I wasn't Stanley you guys pick up garbage too. No
You know the guys who do pick up garbage because we got a little garbage in a
Garage we want to get rid of okay
Right, he's exactly as a matter of fact. Yeah
You got in trouble for one. Oh wait a minute here's somebody else man. Here's the garbage man is at the door right now
This is incredible at the door. Yeah, in fact usually

Think maybe I know who is it? Hi, I recognize you with a glasses on
Okay, hey Stanley
Plantation back to work Stanley. Would you please?
Okay, now maybe we took some calls here
There might be some people want to talk to Casey is that possible?
Nobody knows how do you know that why you so defensive and negative?
There are probably a lot of people or just
Hi
Yes, you got it. Yeah, you want to say hi to Casey?
Okay
Oh, you sit next to Holland
Say hi because Holland always deals with no one ever calls you wow. That's really great that Harlan is always promoting this show
You know he's always out there doing it
Back he was in here doing it just a little while ago
Yes
Okay, I just thought you might like to know that from like a 17-year-old girl Alan is not
Well, I have a feeling that you're allowing your personal feelings to enter into your assess something you would never do that is correct
Now you're looking at this objectively or did you and Alan have some kind of a falling out?
No, I just like I don't even know how it's a vaccine
Yeah, he's not so good looking and Holland is better looking than ours. Oh
Holland did you hear that there's hope after all?
Well, I want to congratulate you on this phone call. Okay now listen. I got the name and address of a great optometrist
Seriously in Cooper City. No, I really do. I've got this optometrist. He will get your eyes straight not for you. No time trusting
Okay, I mean Harlan may have a better personality. He may be a wonderful guy which he is but
I'm not gonna fight you okay
On the money. I'll make a deal with you. Okay, you can have Harlan and I'll have Alan and everybody be happy okay?
Okay, sounds good to me. Have a great weekend. What a great. Oh, that was it. Yeah, you're just you are so obsessed

Oh come on. I want a terrible thing to say that's a horrible thing to say you love all the students don't you?
They're all happy because they don't have to look at us always. Yeah, I don't blame them really. I worked out real good that way
Yeah, if you want to say hi to Casey
Casey
What is your name Linda
Casey's gonna write a song about you Linda
I kind of grew up with all this music so I'm up there in the 36 year-old realm

How about that I always told the kid to gotta be two things you gotta be one insane to be a teacher and couldn't got
I really like it. Yeah, we're insane to listen to my music back then right what or insane to listen to my music back then right
Because of the phone I won't help you

That's correct
So we got to get back to our TV set, but it's been nice hearing from you. I did do it. Okay. Okay, boy boy
Wasn't she nice, huh?
That's from the wall it's like walking you to what yeah, no, it's from noodles actually
