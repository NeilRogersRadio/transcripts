Fascist pigs put that card together because I spend his very own hard earned money to buy that thing.
Okay, what a very appropriate timing, too, wasn't it?
Huh?
Right after we heard that little thing there, speaking of little things, let's talk about Joey for a moment.
Now we have some very amazing scuttle butt from Dennis Folger.
Scuttle butt?
Yes.
Captain Dave will be very pleased to learn that the management over at Chi,
or have they changed the pronoun?
It's just that it's still Chi, Shim, or Chi, like Iranian.
That's what I said.
You know, just when I brought his mic off, I tried to give him a little pocket news,
and it's like he's trying to blow up in there, self-destruct.
Can you just shut up?
Yeah, that's it.
Excellent.
Can't say that.
Anyway, he put together that little ID that we played yesterday with some blast from the past,
from back in December, whenever it was.
Well, the management at Chi, him, or whatever that is.
Come on, I mean.
He hadn't heard that call the day when Joey called in, and wished me all the success.
We did our little thing, and he said, I hope you beat me in a rating, because you're better than I am.
They heard it yesterday.
And we're not pleased.
Really?
You're kidding.
They were pleased?
They were not pleased.
I'm Neil.
Yeah.
I hope you beat me in the ratings, you're better than I am.
Even the competition agrees, the Neil Rogers show on WZGK, Miami Beach,
Fort Lauderdale, and the Palm beaches, is the best morning show in South Florida.
I don't think I don't get to nice here on an AM station as a hero in my book.
You're like, they're Thomas Aquatic.
You got no problem with me.
Even the other morning shows listen to the Neil Rogers show on They The Four.
I hope you beat me in the ratings, you're better than I am.
Yeah, Joey.
You don't like that?
They didn't like that.
In fact, the word is that Joey was rather subdued sounding on the year this morning because evidently,
well, they give them a rough time.
You know what I'm talking about?
Yeah.
In fact, we have a little actuality that we, the Winner, we let the Winns people borrow pollution by Tom Lear.
Right.
Mike Wolf brought something by for us.
A little inside actuality from the staff meeting they had, late yesterday afternoon at 6.
You can stay there again.
You can stay there again.
When I'm done.
When I'm done.
A27 on Zeta 4.
That's like, we have to hear the fit my favorite part of the jingle.
Yeah.
I wore it at the end.
For the first time, those words swing and burn.
It's just what they did yesterday.
Oh boy.
So what?
Yeah.
Neil Riley.
He's a new one.
In stereo.
Yeah.
Rocker's roll.
Billy Boyle Reynolds.
Never give up.
He's still much more than we go in on string to 94.9.
Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil.
Neil, Neil, Ryder, Saul, and Joe.
Yeah.
You talk about how sometimes songs just fit right into the show.
This is so perfect for creation.
As you are, as you are, what you need.
Is the fun to hear all over the world?
Is the story with his one old friend, Emily Boyle?
I'm now on.
You will find, Emily Boyle switching over to Zeta 4.
Yeah.
Neil, Ryder, Neil.
Neil, Neil, Ryder, Saul, and Joe.
Yeah.
Ryder, Saul, and Joe.
Neil, Neil, Ryder, Neil, Neil, Ryder.
Yeah.
Put that Stinking Pan's Jingle company right out of business.
Unbelievable.
Okay, that is excellent.
717 on Zeta 4.
Now, let me see again who that was.
This is the four listeners.
Remember them?
This is the new Neil Rogers show in stereo.
Oh, there's another cut on here.
Oh, see.
Can we handle that?
I have the four listeners.
It's got something new with their favorite again.
Joey.
Hey, Joe.
What you doing?
Home over here again.
Yeah, that's no show, you're out of.
You're out of your mouth, you're bummed low.
Neil, I'm here.
I want you to go back to bummed low.
With a yellow snow and good ladies alone.
You're out of your brain, though.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
Hey, Joe.
Let me get you back to normal.
I'm ready, you'll look good.
Listen, that worked by Eddie Van Halen, is that good or what?
Either him or clap then one of the other.
Hello, and the pro series.
One more time.
That's that.
That's for you, Joey.
That was sensational.
Wait till you hear this call we're going to make.
You are just going to freak out.
Sorry for what?
Look at this movie that opens.
Death Row games show.
They said, chop toden, the host wants you to die laughing.
Okay, now you think they're going to get upset when we tell them that they're on the air?
Oh, well, they're going to get...
You don't know who I'm calling.
Oh, do you?
You're not really.
Yes, I am.
Let me buckle my seatbelt.
This ought to be a great call if they ever pick it up.
Is this the hotline or the loopline?
I didn't say it.
I think he said hot.
Hot.
Hot.
How hot?
How hot is it?
It's so hot that they can't even touch the phone.
Are you going to... they won't pick it up.
Hello.
Hello.
Who is this?
This is Neil Rogers, Bill.
No kidding.
You're on the air on Z4.
Yeah.
You're on the air right now, Bill, so watch yourself.
What happened?
Did he hang up?
Yes, he did.
He hung up.
Oh, he didn't hang up?
Oh, that was call waiting.
How can you have...
How can you have call waiting?
What are you doing, Joey?
There's another show calling.
Hang on a second.
Oh, okay. It's probably Greg.
Call waiting.
What are these guys doing?
Probably... it's probably taping this now.
Somebody probably knew you were calling.
No, they didn't.
Why, do you think they're monitoring us?
What did you do?
Put us on hold?
Bill.
I mean, this is a big time radio show.
We don't have time to even put on hold.
They're not on hold.
Are we on the air?
We want to keep phone systems.
Okay. Do you really?
Who is this?
Joey.
What are you doing?
How are you doing, Joey?
What's going on?
You just got off of the...
Oh, be a...
Gosh darn.
Did you see the stuff?
You're putting me on the air and that thing, are you?
You're on the air right now, Joey.
Oh, that's all right.
Come on, you know.
Why are you making us talk to the enemies when we're so much alive?
We could have been cloned.
I know it.
Well, listen.
You're not my type, Joey.
Come on.
Did you see the articles?
For not with you.
Joey, would you listen to me for a second, please?
Wait, let me ask you one question.
I'd like to see an answer.
I love it, Joey.
I love being close to you.
Should I make you take that at post-song off?
Yes, they did.
Why?
Well, because the corporate people are assholes and they, you know, we're taking it personally.
It's because my artillery yesterday.
Did they really?
Yes, they put it in the study.
They won't let it play the damn thing anymore.
Wait a minute.
Ladies and gentlemen, here's a major bullet in Joey Lostas' asshole yesterday on G.
I can't.
I'm telling you, they're still with me.
Yes, and the managers in the meeting are still with me.
They're going to cut us into new ones.
Yeah.
Well, I'll tell you, those radio management people, they're all cut out of the same mold, aren't they?
Yeah, me and I love you.
There's only one person in China who feels terrible about your mood.
And who's that, Joey?
That major.
He lost his act.
I know.
What is he going to get in act?
What's his story, anyway?
He lost his shadow.
I mean, everything you do, he doesn't know what it was.
What is he, Chinese food?
Yesterday, he got a great idea.
Said he's going to start opening his mail out of the air now.
I wonder where he got that idea.
Tell a minute, please.
The velocity photos they are using, they're intellectuals.
I think they're going to attract us.
By the way, Joey, we've got to call from Stan Roberts on the other line now.
Stan Roberts, pass!
He says all my old buddies.
I know, I'm going to throw names at you, boy.
And Tom Shannon's waiting, too, as a matter of fact.
Let's plug that guy who wrote the article about us in the South Florida magazine.
That's what I was trying to say when you kept interrupting me, Joey.
His name is Logan, maybe?
Maybe.
Maybe.
How much food do I have in you?
Yeah, you really are.
You're a pretty good person.
I've kept it pretty good, haven't I?
As a matter of fact, I want to tell you something, Joey.
I got your, you know, on your mortgage application.
Yeah, thanks for waiting in on the air.
You're so good.
I didn't give the address, though.
I couldn't have done a lot worse.
But anyway, I've got your address, and I'm going to tell you, I'm going to come over and hang out a while, you know?
Come on over, I love you, the Joey.
Joey has a new assistant.
20th over here to hang out, Neil.
I think I was just a nice year on an AM station as a hero in my book.
You're like, say Thomas Aquatic, you've got no problem with me.
Exactly.
I always knew you were a good guy, Joey.
I love you, I'll see you soon.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
There it goes.
Oh, that was a good call.
He was real nice.
That was an excellent call.
That was an award-winning call.
Joey, you're okay.
We're not going to plug those other fakers from now on.
I'm going to enjoy it with so friendly.
