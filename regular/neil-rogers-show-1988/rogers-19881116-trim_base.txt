see what happens when Nick is running the board i do that when you run a
for it and i got confused because he's sitting there
that's a good excuse ten fifty four w i'd be we have a little
little inhouse problem there anyway before i do that mobile call i want to
thank again the people at spax who sent me the out in john
right in spanish because i did watch it last night
a couple of times oh oh
closely uh huh and i'm going to tell you that um
boy that is an incredible video now did you have god did you have to clean
the tv screen
no true i think part of it is my expensive
n-e-c video recorder i've been having some problems with lately really
and it needs to be fixed in other words the heads are out of alignment or
something when you drop the cassette in there it jumps around like
lines you know it's hard to it's distorted needs cleaning and if you stop it
and start it off and off you can clear it up okay but it's obviously just a
little adjustment that needs to be made now it doesn't need cleaning i clean the head
yeah but believe me i cleaned the head before i put that in there because i want to
clear and i finally got the lines out of there and got it as clear as a bell
and it was tremendous okay by the way the pizza loft is bringing lunch
i just thought i would mention that great great so we thank uh sonny and uh
mike for offering a little bit of the leftovers from this morning's food and i

Benny Mart Donas that's correct i'll nicknose from bb king he don't know no Benny Mart Donas
haha not his uh thing but i remembered it was a lot of time i had a couple of years ago

how joe z feels about me this right on the heels of the other one here this ought to be good hello
hello yeah yeah i've been a listener for you from for a while now but i went to the game Monday night
and i went up to joe the gaki and asked him how he really felt about you really did hate you
he said no i despise you that's that's a lot better yeah he said he despised you yeah well the
spies is a lot better than hate yeah hate it hate is like the ultimate despise is like somewhere in
between any other mean look on his face when he said it did he really hmm i mean he was fully
conscious when he said it hey what well he can't be too conscious when you go into the game
yeah that's true hey you know i used to work with your mom years ago doing what over it in Hollywood
yeah she used to work in the electronics that's correct i used to work with her when i was about 18
years old well i'll be damned wait me when you were 18 years old how old are you now i'm 33 wow
15 years ago yeah in Hollywood boy time is your flies doesn't it yeah what a nice lady she really is
she still is yeah i'm talk to her since i left there when they a new manager took over and
clean house on everybody and i'll tell you one thing boy she can cook up a meal still like he
wouldn't believe she always she always asked me one day to come over but i wasn't better that long
yeah we're very nice lady she sure is what better than joe then who and joe who
you know you know joe joe joe z yeah it don't be comparing joe z with with my mother okay please
now but what's his problem anyway oh it was he serious or are you just kidding no he would
serious he despises me see i don't really have any feelings i'll be honest with it like some of the
people in the building i haven't even met yet like i met rick weaver many many moons ago and uh
you know we used to joke about him but i have great respect for his talent in the games
right now you've never talked bad about this yet and uh sunny of course sunny and i worked
together with k a t is one of the great people in town i mean just a super guy all the way around
and hank and i get along well and uh you know all the all the talk people here we're getting
along well so far we haven't had any blood bad so most of the people are getting along fine but
i don't know about joe you know he puts on a good front when he comes in here but if he hates
my guts that's his problem you know it could be when you're in a rotten mood where you got it
with all for you that that's true it could be although there seem to be a growing number of
rumors in that direction but he'll come in and he'll defend himself today and give me another good
son to that i see i don't really care i'm beyond that you know what i'm saying i mean they're paying
me so much money i don't care if everybody hates me i'd prefer not because i like to get along
in spite of the popular rumors to the contrary but i do like to get along i have discovered there's a
little bit of see nothing is perfect i talked about how nice everybody is here and there's a little
anciness in a certain part of the building which i'm not going to discuss on the air but uh...
that's good see because if everybody's too nice that's a disgusting thing you know i know yeah
finally you can have a little few somebody over there exactly right it could be something like
your own day today all the time i'm you said hello yeah tell your tellers fall
saw yeah i'm sure she'll have that that's my father's name they've been divorced for many years
okay have a nice day yeah could you call Jamie a douchebag okay you're a douchebag Jamie Marcy too
all right bye boy he would have gone on forever he's a good guy but uh... okay mom saw says hello
i'm sure that'll make her day it's eleven thirty three at w i o d i still think joe's not a bad guy
just needs to wake up right now if you're going to go out and buy some new carpeting for your home
and fix it up in eleven thirty seven i love that then what's he saying gayo see i got i dug that
out because uh... nick put that on cart for us and uh... that kid that's calling today who is a
busy out there playing with his banana um... can he ready to go to the melting pot no doubt
anyway jose a ganky called it off the air on the bat line he said it's all a bunch of crap and he
loves us and he sent money into the Camilo's house and he's a wonderful guy i don't have any problem
with joe i mean he doesn't need to wake up once in a while but other than that uh... he's a good
guy and uh... he hates us that's his business he's entitled anyway it's uh... twenty twenty spooch till
noon in an amazing steve said when we first came here that the sports department there were a little bit
of tension in the air and then you remember the day that hang called oh yeah and and i like hang
i'm not going to rip hang because hang is a good guy and he and i've gotten along well for a long time
i don't see it very often but i still like them a lot he's a good guy and then steve came rushing
in here and then all of a sudden that tension started building again you notice they're throwing
a few shots oh few yeah god like dropped it little stuff like that anyway i want to thank
Jeff from the pizza loft right up front here because he brought enough food now i got to tell you
something okay so maybe they did keep my keys too long yesterday and i went you know they were
a little upset at me out front okay i don't want to mention any names for some reason a little bit
because i wanted my keys back so i could go home now i wasn't making a big fuss and i wasn't screaming
and caring i just said hey you know i really would like to get on here and i'd like to find out
where my keys are now was that an unreasonable request well you're so picky but the bottom but the
bottom line is that now that we're getting all this food in here i mean there's enough food downstairs

okay like that out in john video i don't know any of the people in that video and maybe i would love
i already do love some of them and i don't even know them so there are different kinds of love

good show and all of a sudden halfway through the movie there's a scene in a bar in the pool hall

wait a minute and the whole thing now first of all this takes place in Pittsburgh mass
at Pittsburgh massachusetts now now get out here Pittsburgh

no he can bring it in there and then we'll bring it in here because he we don't want you know
to get him in trouble hey listen we don't care what they say okay the bottom line is when a guy
comes and brings us all this food we're gonna eat some of it okay it's great that we feed all the
rest of these schleppers out here all these snores that are looking for free dinners it can bring
a bunch in huh they're gonna bring some up he'll bring it in here don't worry about it just relax
stay in your seat for it i don't want to be 44 w i o d from here he's a four-lotterdale hello
hello nil yes sir i'm a first time caller i'll be damned yes and i've been listening to your show now
for about six months and i converted from fm okay your number 23 sir man i'm telling you we're
building an audience like you wouldn't believe here okay uh listen i just wanted to call and uh
see if my painter was listening out there Bruce he's the leader Bruce yeah i heard that he's busy
repainting the cysteine officer well he told me he was gonna have my place completed two weeks ago when he
had those two vines cleaning yeah okay and that's one thing so Bruce if you're listening get your
butt over here get your butt in there Bruce yeah yeah that's how I'm just kidding i've got a
i've got a solution for the dolphins to make them a winning team yeah try basket ball huh no
uh train marino and do the same thing the way him stood with dick a sitting get the draft choice
get the new front line up there on the offense and i think they start have a winning team yeah that
sounds like what zeta forwarded with us in other words take the best part of your team and get
rid of it and then the one i want you to walk you's and then they can be consistent right right
right yeah now dial d number one there you go yeah yeah so i think of the dolphins you know
mario's attitude yeah i don't think he's a team player what do you think i know i think you're wrong
i think uh rick weaver headed on the head in his comment yesterday when he said that or the other
the day before when he said that the marino years are being wasted when your offensive lines
stinks when you're you know secondary stinks when you have no pass rush you know what what the hell is
he supposed to do when the game single handedly you've got to have a defense which they don't have
and you've got to have an offensive line it gives him the kind of protection let him throw the ball
which is not happening it's happening with the less and less frequency this year and what can i
tell you well i agree with you i guarantee you that uh there's about twenty twenty four teams in the
league that would love to have marino quarterback i won't you know that i'm back you know take taking
the place apart the best offensive center over to play the game my game uh you know he's not he's
not he can't fool the shoes but you know i you know i think marino's attitude on the field
and he doesn't look like you know he's really concerned he's working well i think i think they've
been filling a lot of shoes over there at the stadium this evening if you could see what's in a man
i would explain a lot of things to you and well i haven't been to the new stadium man i used to
like the orange ball and you know it's amazing when the orange ball was here that i'm not picking on you
but when the orange ball was here i mean it's still here but when they were playing in the orange
ball everybody used to bitch and complain no restrooms and the seats were like uncomfortable because
they were concrete and it was it was a nightmare and it was in an area that nobody wanted to go to
and the people in broward and palm beach didn't want to slip all the way down to Miami and everybody
bitched about the orange ball for years the lobby comes along they build this beautiful new state
of the art stadium it couldn't possibly be in a more convenient location it's right at the day
broward line and all everybody does now is bitching complain and moan and carry i don't understand
it man this town is impossible i never can play i've always liked yours boy like the area around
around the old wooden at the old little uh little uh havana yeah i always i always enjoyed that area
like go down there and talk about getting gouged for parking man at the orange ball those people in
those neighborhoods boy they used to goug your brains out like a flea market you get down to
partner with whatever the market would bear okay i just want to let you know i'm not a chronic
call i'd like to enjoy your show and uh keep up the good work thanks a lot all right all right
yeah i don't understand this town i don't want to get into a big sports thing because this station
has plenty of sports talk as it is we don't want to over it no no don't get carried away
because you'll get you up set again yeah but um the bottom line is that they've got an excuse for
everything even before the stadium was finished they were making excuses why they didn't like it
and where it was going to be and then this and that uh pop up up up up up you know all of that stuff
i'm tired of it man i get so tired of the excuses if you don't like it then you know send a letter
to joe and tell him to move the team to someplace that wants him instead of wasting his time okay
and i'm not shilling for joe robby because i'm on a stadium because like i said the other day
there are a lot of things he does that uh really tick off a lot of people to say the very least okay
but uh bottom line is he still a guy to put up the money and puts up the team and pays him
but anyway how about those heat huh how about that heat
1148 don't forget steve has the last prefabricated contrived debate on official
language i really do hope it is a last because i know that they just had the election
and overwhelming i mean eighty three percent i think stay like past it but um it's a symbolic thing
and it wasn't really necessary to rehash it again but when people start trying to make it in a law
like steve said yesterday and trying to enforce something that isn't enforceable and the fire people
and suspend people and brow beat people because it was passed then you know the whole thing was
bad to begin with okay it stinks like a rotten fish speaking of rotten fish now the food is
going to be great i shouldn't say that but there is an aroma of food probably winding its way
already through the window maybe because nictus came and put all kinds of food down in there yeah
and we'll probably during this next break we'll probably sneak in yeah he won't bring it in here yeah
okay now listen to palm beach lines are a little soft today if you know what i mean really
and while soft is the operative word in palm beach especially with lean living there now in
bokeh and del ray two seven eight wiod and in poppy just i don't know what that was like stop
in midstream well glad he waited on hold but there's something really good yeah he waited all
the way through the news he's back and then he just choked up he couldn't spit it out well
all getting some checks for the commingles house today and that's uh step in the right direction
now this is the second wave of bail yeah okay uh it comes in here comes even some more bizarre
stuff that just came in great more for the commingles house thank you in a half way yeah this is our
third what a male really does it comes in fits and dirt yeah i like that and uh don't forget if
you haven't sent a check in yet in any amount for the commingles house we really hope you will send
it to neo-roger's wiod miammy three three one four one here's one male to dress to Miami beach
we're not on Miami beach we're close to Miami beach yeah but it's Miami and here's another one
it says Miami Beach this is Miami Beach well it's got kind of that beach north they've
village but it's not Miami Beach trust me okay but anyway as long as you get the right zip it'll
get here three three one four one and we thank you in advance okay why really wonder what the hell
that was all about he just started blording again and then he had to like this bokeh
callery had nothing to say right nail yeah how you doing today great well i can't believe this radio
station real working radio stage isn't that frightening oh god and we get like male it just comes
in all through the day and they bring it to us even and it's just uh amazing well i'm shocked i mean
they tell you when you're up next and all that i know a lot of colors it's like
treasure shock isn't it trouble adjusting i know plan how you doing just great sir when while
i'm counting the days down till arena football yeah me too yeah me too by this miss those
slamming people into the wall i never could get kneel into it yeah not
away speaking of sports a police officer in west palm i'm not going to say piggoos he's a nice guy
semi a whole bunch of Chicago Cubb's baseball cards a whole set and look at that there's uh in fact
these some of these are from last year i guess steve proud now you're all set per can show under
man and bro this is great you can bring in onays can participate yes some of these are from last year
rick sudcliffe chris spire well when the hell was chris spire on the cubs 86 ryan sandberg i'm looking for
that one you can read that baby i'm looking for that one real quick take that on your dad i'm looking
for my um mike bolecki card but i can't find it now he kept out the ryan sandberg you know
i said he's a pig now you're a great guy palo wherever you are thanks for the cards yeah
going to ask you about uh texas they find uh or not the california angel find uh dug raider
uh as their manager or he used to manage the rangers a couple years back yeah i don't
understand these baseball people aren't they it's some fresh man uh people they like it's like
radio they like to recycle the same old like a retread yeah retreads over and over again see we
success with uh continental cable oh well it's not going to happen one day you can be sure that
it's going to take a real major campaign to get uh them off their butt yeah uh what you do take
your satellite down yeah yeah i could have gone through a big song in a dance but it's just too much
red tape i still got it i haven't sent it back yet or to put it more correctly the people who put
it up haven't taken it back give me my money back yet and i'm tempted to put it back you know to
go through the right proper procedure yeah and to put it back up because i can do it i just can't
put it in the same spot we're gonna have to take a treat on in the backyard and go through a big
song in a dance but i think it's worth it because i got news for what's on that cable is enough to
really uh turn you into a psychotic lunatic well we need some more church channel yeah and some more
shop at home channels yeah well they don't because they've got a rule there of no children under 18
all these old farts are carrying on and they're going to go to court and they're having an emergency
meaning to those people ought to drop dead okay those miserable rotten old farts and i saw some of
the interviews on the news last night they're saying well we can't help it if her mother died that's
got nothing to do with anything we have rules here they've got to be enforced uh-huh yeah that's it
that's this town man a bunch of nasty rotten old farts who don't have a a bone of sympathy or
compassion in their body and they all ought to drop dead yeah what do they think cool exactly now i
saw that and it just made my blood boil yeah and of course we've seen this repeatedly over the years
we had the one we had the people on my show here a couple of years ago remember they've got kicked
out in tamarack because they had a baby and somebody had a pet monkey next door to them and the monkey
was okay but the baby was you know that had to go hmm i didn't see this last night i didn't make
you sick to your stomach yeah it made me sick that's why i wanted to call it i mean all they're doing
is just keeping her there until they can figure out what to do you know and um and they're trying
to sell a condo they've been trying for how long do they say for like three months or whatever
to sell a damn thing and get the hell out of there and they haven't had any takers yet and in the
meantime it's like get her out of here now where we're gonna come and blow your place up you know
i mean these people are disgusting absolutely that's what's wrong with this town they ought to take
all the old farts put them out on a fleet of buses with a bunch of fleet animals and get them
the hell out of this town send it back where they came from send them to Wyoming or somewhere where
they have a lot of wide open spaces yeah in cold weather exactly or genetically or maybe like
upper Michigan the UP if we can say that all right yeah in this station you can say that yeah the UP
they can send them on that famous battleship the IP freedom well listen have a great time
one more thing i'll let you go yeah these these news breaks you have our terminal is anyway we
can get glenda to the news at at the thirty five well ask Henry what he thinks about that yeah okay
like the news like to say hi to George at work okay okay okay don't they install Jorge
day see you later boy boy okay can't say don't they install Jorge he what i want to town this is
you know what a town with no heart with no compassion with no feeling with no nothing i mean
they're a handful of people out there who are not in that category but the majority of people in
this town are cold and icy you know this is a place where the weather is hot and the people are cold
that's a bottom line the most uncaring unfeeling the only thing that they'll feel strongly about is
like this crap this bilingualism that Steve's been talking about the last two days this bilingual
thing and i couldn't you know usually he and i disagree but i couldn't agree with him more man
this thing has been so overdone and it's got to the point now where the bigotry that's involved is
just seeping over the edges i mean it's not even nobody's even hiding it anymore it's disgusting
don't they a star or hey oh that's it you're out pal don't they a star this
what a town ten forty eight and w i would do let's go to west Palm Beach hello hey yo how you doing pal
hey bird hi hey you never gonna just do who's on the way so or so yesterday as a matter of fact
funny you should mention Lee fallor cuz i have interesting letter that interesting letter and
resume that lead sent to our former management a few months ago when he was out on the beach and boy
it's a classic i got it right here Lee we'll get it you get one or more of a deal of reddoin
promoting he must have been promoting that tv show last time promoting it he would definitely
talk about reading the script from it let me tell you when you know it's like when you go to
the dog track and they walk the dogs before they put them in the suits well after the fact they're
tinkling all over each other yes they mean you know only here's my buddy this and oh how
did i love you this and just on and on oh we should be a team we're great comedians
yeah while they both are headed their careers are both headed in the same direction
oh man i tell you it was even though out the dean of course is a friend of wio d

talked about condo may let girls stay it says an adult's only condominium in margate that threatened
we evicted nine year old girl whose mother recently died decided on wednesday to consider
letting the child stay a while longer i think this big emergency meeting today oh yeah see if they
can reach into the depths of their hearts and find enough compassion to let the nine year old girl stay
there a little longer while they try to unload this condo in the middle of these miserable old
farts now is this girl causing problems around the condo sir what's the complaint the complaint is
that she's under a hundred oh okay we don't want that was kind of people living here we don't want
anybody under ninety five now they don't like to see people at age walking around no they don't
want to have to remember when they were under a hundred right and this kind of thing goes on in this
town over and over again this adults only thing is the most disgusting grotesque rotten crap you find
very little of it they're little bit of it but very little of it all over the rest of the country
here it's like everywhere adults only which is code for old old farts only right that's what it means
ten fifty five and w i don't know i want to get modeling and depressed but i'm sick and tired of
that kind of crap about these nasty rotten hostile people with their filthy disposition uh
running this area and basically that's what they've done they run all the young people out of
and uh... you know they run everybody off the beach in hollywood who's got a t-shirt that says
ip freelier whatever that might be i mean it just can't stand seeing anybody having a good time

Now, Anne, I never heard of her. Who is that?
She really said that she doesn't know who I am and she never heard of me.
Who are you kidding, Anne? Well, I guess you know, too much time in a truck affects your mind.
It's 1131 at WIOD. We have a caller in Perme. Hello, boy. This is like old times again.
Well, they can hear me. This is just like old times.
What? Oh, boy, that sounds good.
A lot of Micronary's listeners describe him as hometown. And how does Mike describe it?
I guess it must be just the way I are. Damn. That's pretty much the way I am.
I'm just... It's like we're sitting around in a kitchen table.
Or sitting around a bar somewhere just...
...chitchatting about what's going on, you know.
Micronary, starting South Florida's day as only he can do it.
Mornings on News Talk Radio 610, WIOD.
How about now?
Boy, this is incredible. And why is this thing rattling like it's going to blow up here?
Man, there's something real strange here today.
Testing. Oh, you can hear me.
Just like old times, isn't it? Oh, they're trying to make it feel home.
1007 at WIOD. We did hear Paul Harvey, though, right?
Good morning, Americans. It's Friday.
Okay, that's good. As long as we hear Paul, everything else peels into wind significance.
Boy, that was exciting, wouldn't it?
They're trying to make it feel something wrong.
Man, these things are just boiling. I mean, I don't even have them all the way up.
Which is good. I like that.
But, man, there's something really bizarre going on in here.
Do you hear that? Can you hear how that's just like feeding back?
Just like our last show. Yeah, we feel right at home now.
Yeah. What they do bring Rick Edwards in a building or something?
Now, all of a sudden, I don't hear anything. What's that all about?
Ow! Ow!
Oh, God. Well, listen, it's been nice being with you.
Hope you have a great weekend and happy Thanksgiving.
Happy Sukas.
Funny, Rick Edwards comes to your brain whenever somebody just happens.
And not only that, but you know how this first break comes sneaking up before.
By the time we get on the air, we're going to be able to break here already.
Not yet. Don't panic, Roger.
Don't get hysterical on us, but while Tim will fix it, you know.
Oh, I really paid you the songbook from the other place and see if we can't patch it all together, right?
Does Rick Edwards come to your mind whenever it comes to my mind when I'm with him?
In fact, I see a mic stand hanging from the ceiling right now.
Rick's probably up there on the other side nailing it through, you know.
Anyway, it's 10-o'-a-d-w-i-o-d. I guess it's okay just that these now are so much louder, which is good,
because I'm using those like until we get the overhead thing in there to hear myself.
Because I don't want to wear them.
Me too.
No. We did enough of that for a year and at Closet we were in.
We don't want to wear that stuff.
Anyway, I heard the Nelliest Show I've ever heard in my life yesterday on this station.
But you know what they say? What goes, what goes around, comes around.
That's what they say.
I didn't know Jack Sturdy had his own show. Did you?
I thought Steve was on in the afternoon on WIOD.
Well, is that, is he like in limbo?
He seems to be.
So, man, oh man, that, that, well, I don't even know what word to use at this point.
That creature is just unbelievable.
I thought that we're going to talk about movies too.
They did. They did.
Well, little bits and pieces of snatches if I can say that.
But boy, that, you know, I thought yesterday we had a bunch of lippers calling several in a row there,
which got me real nervous because we like to kind of spread it around.
Balance it out. That's exactly what I was looking for.
And I'll get too limbristed.
But our show was like, Curcules, and what followed your man.
I'm going to tell you that.
Seriously, with the Nelliest Show I've ever heard in my life.
Anyway, we have some incredible stuff here.
Somebody sent us, in fact, it was loose brew, sent us a cassette of Yamama,
which I'm going to dub in that Monday.
You can do your own little things or be sure to play in your material on Monday.
And then also a loose brew sent us a virgin copy of the swinging area dites
and walk within erection, which we're going to be playing this morning.
Wow.
And we ran it by, we bumped it by Bupus and Bupus said, hey, no problem.
And just, you know, leave me alone, which is great.
Okay, we are going to do our first break now, and then we're going to actually get the show on the road.
And look at that. We've already got a whole bunch of lines lit there.
That's good.
They could even hear us in there going, 10 past 10 at WIOD.
We're in the area here. You probably heard Bob Soap from me talking about the Cheek of Lodge in Ilamorada.
Bob has been down there since they redid the place. I haven't yet, but I'm going in a couple of weeks.
They tell me it's great. I know they spent a bundle on it, and it was great before.
New oceanfront dining room, new restaurants, swimming pool, and Sunday right from Cheek as 500 foot pier.
Hobie cats and paddle boats, golf and tennis.
And he gets some very attractive rates right now.
For example, now through December 22nd, Cheek has got an unbeatable introductory rate of $110 a night.
That's based on double occupancy with a minimum two-night stay.
It was also a special Thanksgiving holiday package available,
complete with traditional turkey dinner and wine.
Sounds pretty good to me. You relax on the beach, fish a little bit,
get a little sun tan and a complete family turkey dinner to boot.
Thanks giving it the Cheek of Lodge. You can call them toll free at 1-800-327-2888.
That's the Cheek of Lodge. Call them toll free 1-800-327-2888.
The Cheek of Lodge in beautiful Ilamorada.

Sports Talk every night at 6 right here. Now, more with Neil Rogers by Newstalk Radio 610 WIOD.
Penthertien at WIOD. We didn't do so well at the horses again yesterday. The bird is in a row.
He's coming in at least second every day.
Well, Kelly.
My Gonzalez, four to five, second by eight lengths. So it wasn't exactly the three dollars to place in the show.
And in the ninth race, I really bit the big one. Big Joey ran third, sensible bird ran sixth.
And well, the second longest shot on the board, Banna Ruba with the Doug Valleante won a 2380.
So we really bombed out yesterday. So it means we're due. I would take, I would mortgage a house today.
And especially this crap you picked in the first race, 15 to one in the morning line, North Athens in the first race with Juan V.
It didn't jump out at me.
And I picked in the third, Galleria girl with Chavez. Of course, that's the morning line favorite.
But when I see Galleria girl, be careful.
You just know it's got to be a big one. Now, when I have a strong feeling, I will tell you, but I don't have a strong feeling.
Okay, Mr. Rexpert over here. P.Vac's film of WIOD.
Okay, it's 10-14 and I can't believe the phone man are going crazy. We have one line on the board that's open.
It's inbrouwered. And if we fill that up, we can just take a picture of the board and believe.
5-2-4 WIOD. Let's start in Boka. Hello.
Neil. How you doing?
How you doing? We're doing it, pal.
That's great. I've wanted to remind all of America that Rick Sarderman is the fascist.
But today?
Boy, that was a very pregnant call to start. Okay, now that's his opinion.
First of all, he said, didn't he say in my opinion?
Yeah. He is a fascist.
And of course, in my opinion, okay, moving along, let's go to Lauderdale. Hello.
Yeah, hi. About a year and a half ago, I was working in my yard.
I had a helper. We were putting sod in the yard and you played a record.
You were putting sod in the yard. Is there some special reason why you're telling us that?
No, no, I was just trying to explain to you. We were really doing a lot of muscular work.
And you played a record that was so funny that we couldn't continue working.
And all I can remember is that you said it was made in England in 1930.
No, no, no. I was made in Canada and you're talking about the Crepitation Contest.
That's the thing.
Well, I'm going to play it.
One of these in the next couple of weeks providing A that my friend who's got the Virgin Cassett of it ever gets it to me.
And B that, of course, we get approval from Spike.
And getting approval from Spike is almost automatic because he just, hey, you know, go ahead.
We don't care. What the hell?
All right.
So you'll be hearing it. Just, you know, when you're out there sodding, when you least expected, it'll be there.
Okay. Thanks.
Bye-bye.
Amazing. Hello.
Wow. What is the story with these people today anyway?
I'll tell you one thing. I must have slept bad last night because my back, you know when you sleep in a bad position
in your back feels like you need seven chiropractor.
Huh. But other than that, I feel great because I know, well, it's psychological.
I think I know we got this great Thanksgiving feast coming in from Joe at Tafsbury, Rotisserie.
Right.
And then we also have I understand through the grapevine, some cheesecake coming in around one.
Wow.
And man, I'm telling you, it's just been a couple of weeks.
And this week, as opposed to last week, last week, dragged.
I mean, it was a long week for us.
This week has flown by.
Has it?
You bet, man, it just flown by.
Even Roger said that it's flown by.
It's Friday.
Yeah.
10, 16 at WIOD.
Good morning, Americans.
It's Friday.
What does it tell you about an audience that needs to have some douchebag telling him what day the week it is, right?
Let's go to Perine. Hello.
Hey, who is Spike?
What? Who is Spike?
Oh, Spike is our operations manager at IODWGTR.
Who is it?
Nick, name, you name, or just his real name.
Well, Spike, like the number of Spike Jones?
Oh, yeah.
And Spike Owens, a place for the Red Sox or the Rangers or somebody.
You remember that song I just called to say I love you by Steady?
Yes, I sure do.
Well, I just called to say that you are the king.
That's all.
Oh, thank you.
I want to tell you.
What a nice call.
I'm a nice guy, but you're the king.
That's all I want to tell you.
Let me ask you a question, sir.
What?
How old are you?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Oh, you called yesterday?
I'm 33, very, very.
33, while you're still a nice guy.
Yeah, no, my kids still a lot better today.
Yesterday you sound a little depressed.
Well, I was.
Oh, you know, if you're better than me.
I have to talk to you yesterday, you think?
Oh, I see that cheered you up.
And now two days in a row and you're on the verge of becoming chronic, right?
But I won't be chronic.
I'm going away, so I'll see you in one of the times.
I'll go to King God, bless you.
Where are you going?
Well, we're going to go to Calahassi for Thanksgiving.
Oh, God.
You know?
Boy, there are a lot of turkeys up there.
I'll tell you that.
Yeah, but there's freshmen.
My brother goes out and he shoots one.
No, but he does, yeah.
Okay, you have a good day now.
Hey, we'll see you, sir.
Bye-bye.
Boy, these people just love us, don't they?
Don't they?
They're love us or they hate us.
Like poison.
There's no in between.
We can better wonder if Barbara Poison's got any mounted cauldron today.
Just want to mention, early post-time at cauldron, please be very careful.
You almost knocked my soda over and I had gotten all the crap for that.
We need just try not to be so emotional.
What was I going to say?
Thank God, thanks.
Giving day, Thursday had called her post-time 11 a.m.
Really?
Yeah, they have an early post so that people can get their plunging over
and then go home and have dinner with their family.
Huh.
They have enough money left to buy.
Oh, 10-18 and let's go to Miami.
Hello?
One of the others on the San Diego.
Hey, come on, stop.
Young.
This is Jorge.
How you doing?
Good Jorge.
Don't they, a star Jorge?
We've been asking that.
Yeah.
Well, I'm here up in North Miami somewhere.
Listen, I just want to say that I believe in you.
I'm going to, you guys for a while, especially you, Neil.
Since you were in WINZ.
Uh-huh.
You still remember the good times to burn out Jorge Valdés.
Oh, yeah, my pal.
Don't they a star Jorge?
Yes, I understand.
And I just want to say, how much to say, I just want to say that I enjoy your show
and listen to your older time.
And you and Bert have a great, but not.
Thank you.
All right.
You have a good day now.
You too.
Man, what's going on here today?
Everybody is just in such a good mood.
Well, that's because the dolphins haven't played this week since Monday.
And that's, it seems like a long ways away, doesn't it?
Seems like a light year ago.
Everybody wants to block that out of their mind.
And they also want to block out of their mind.
The fact that the Sunday will be coming around pretty soon again Sunday night.
But anyway, that's great.
And you know, we ordinarily are not, we don't encourage tinkling and butt kissing.
And because it gets pretty boring.
But once in a while when it comes unexpectedly like this, like when everybody calls
without even giving the numbers out.
And they're just in such a good mood.
And they're just showering you with all kinds of affection and love and tinkling all over your brain.
There's nothing wrong with that once in a while.
Speaking of your brain, the aliens are coming on the cane show this afternoon.
Another one of these contrived shows.
Steve speaks with members of the Rayleigh in movement.
Huh?
And there are a lot of people in this town who could use a good movement.
Trust me.
An atheistic religion that's waiting to welcome the extra terrestrial back to Earth.
Nadine Bowdoin and another Rayleigh in will swoop down in their flying saucers at two o'clock.
And a Steve Cain show sounds like another pile of you know what?
Wow. Right here on the radio.
Wow.
Where it's 20 past 10.
Fat riches here, ladies and gentlemen.
Good.
We are really in the in the pink today.
Everything pretty snappin.
Good morning, fat and rich today brought these sodas and he also brought utensils.
That's what I like as a guy who's prepared for somebody offering the food.
When he brings the forks and the knives and just sitting there rubbing his hands together, salivating,
waiting for Joe to come from Tastry Rotisserie.
Also cheese cake and one.
And fat rich also brought us something very important for you pharmacist out there.
This is an ancel incorporated condom recall.
Now this is legitimate.
This is not a joke.
And lifestyles extra strength with non-oxinol trees.
Oh, I see the three different categories, three's, four's and twelves and we're trying to figure out what those delineate.
Yeah.
But anyway, be careful.
Leave that to your own imagination, I guess.
It says, please hold any of the above for your account matter.
Yeah.
Which I think is kind of cute.
Thank you so much, Rich.
Anyway, it's 10.23 and let's go.
I can't believe these phones here today.
What the hell is going on, man?
They're going crazy.
And we haven't even said anything yet.
And we haven't played walk with an erection yet.
We should play that this hour because we always play the good stuff when Nick comes in and we never give Roger a chance to hear the good stuff.
So we had to, you want to take that into Roger fat grid.
And we'll mean with time we'll take a call from Miami.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Uh-huh.
Oh my God, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
Yeah, you're talking to me. Aren't you excited now to this make your whole weekend?
Yeah, it does.
I'm an, I'm an, first time call.
I've never called before.
I've listened to him for a while.
I'm not the last.
I don't mean to tinkle, but you are the greatest.
You're damn right, pal.
And just don't forget it.
You know, and I've been to New York and I've heard how it's turned, but he thinks, you know, I'm very proud.
Yeah, Howard's small potatoes.
Like I said, he's funny once in a while because he uses those six or seven words.
Right.
If they ever take those words away, Howard's going to have to go back to Washington dishes.
You could say that again.
Yeah, I'll say it again.
If they ever take those six or.
Well, Neil, see, I'm calling because I have a problem.
I think you would be able to help me.
What is it?
You see, what is it?
You see, I have a choice between two jobs.
I can either, I'm 19, right?
Yeah.
And I can work for a job for $5 an hour, which I don't like.
Oh, I got a, I got a third job for you that pays better than that, sir.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
What is that?
Just a joke.
Go ahead.
And then there's a job for $4 an hour, which, you know, I would like.
What one should I take?
Oh, take the one for four bucks an hour.
I'm telling you, money isn't everything.
And especially for a buck an hour, how much difference is it?
What are you going to do with that extra buck?
That's true.
Yeah.
Right?
Yeah, you're right.
Oh, Neil, could you do me a favor, please?
What is that?
I knew you were going to ask for something.
I could tell you sounded too good to be true.
Well, I just would like you to call my friends Douglas, Tom, and Manny, douchebag.
Doug Tom and Manny are douchebags, and it was very simple.
I thought it was going to be like to play some long, you know.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Your show's great the way it is.
I don't need to.
Well, I'm telling you, there are going to be a lot of hernias in town when this show's over.
Don't you feel like kind of a pain in the groin right now after this call?
Oh, I don't know.
Well, okay.
Well, it'll grow on you.
Listen, have a great weekend.
All right.
Thanks.
Bye.
Man, Tinkler's Anonymous look out.
Again, this is kind of like the Uncle Bonzai stuff, the office women, all over town for some reason,
just to really get into this.
So without further ado, big time.
I keep the sand, I'll sand him.
That's the sad fate, my son, the greatest fate.
He holds his organ in his fist.
He gives his things off in a mighty twist.
I leave his trousers way too tight.
Hope for that feels so big tonight.
I keep his wrist, his wrist, and his laugh for else.
You know that, he takes his laugh.
All the girls in the office, they say,
I keep heart on, heart on, bang my part on.
I love his interaction.
I keep wearing mirroring in his last year.
The circle ball runs in his ear.
He goes to the province town to tanning.
When green to every man.
His cowman climbs up to the phone.
Make sure that he's home.
Go home alone.
His fences winches in key,
West thinks the blue boy maggots are the best.
All the boys in fifth row, they say,
Okay, okay, okay, okay, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
All the boys remain to Mexico.
All of that'sore that's below.
Like the cop who carries the big night,
He's just an extension of his wick.
He's a stupor, he's on the block,
The cops can let the kids serve and drown the clock
The cops come too white for kids so nice
So though he gets off I'm working by a
A little college boy turned to a floor
They try to learn chicks to their dorm
They're losing the place from every floor
They drop the drawers then they ask for more
All the girls don't be here
They say hard on, hard on
They clap hard on
My big election
If I regards the Neil Rogers telling me that I've never heard a
lot of your program in my life
