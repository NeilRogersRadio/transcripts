Number one knows more about ratings than any man in South Florida. Okay. Well, let's punch him up immediately. Hello
Hey, oh, congratulations on your anniversary. Hey, here's the gentleman the a phantom who was missing yesterday
Nothing yesterday, but I
Appreciate your calling and again. I want to wish a happy anniversary 12 successful years
Thank you so much Lee. It's a good time to hang it up isn't it?
Why push my luck now not at all? You've got you've got other mountains to climb. Yeah, I know you're gonna be like
Visiting a five nine to a six one when this book is oh
I'm serious boy. You're in a dream world, babe. No, no, absolutely not you've been hanging out with fruitcake again Lee
I think so
Absolutely not and you are also you also turned out to be quite a profit because you predicted the downfall of
W. I.m. V didn't I really yeah, I've been saying that well listen to you have to be a genius all you got to do is turn it on and listen for 10 minutes
And you know immediately the story there well, you know Gary Lawrence has two two options open he can fire Mark
Yoon
Or he can wait till his successor comes in and fires Mark you oh
That was an interesting now that was a profound statement ladies and gentlemen
I want you to analyze that I want you to think very carefully
Like that radio state that was an interesting way that you put lead that out for us then go ahead to late mr.
Cune destroyed W. I. O. D. and he's doing the same thing with I in there
Yeah, like I said he's a nice guy like if he would set up a hot dog stand a subrace
No, no seriously
I really mean to like I said the other day because when you see Mark you really feel a lot of sympathy for him and
Everybody even if they were full if they had just eaten they would still pull over say come on
Let's buy a couple of hot dogs from Mark. He'd probably make some serious bucks doing that
What is it to all that god only knows he keeps tinkering and tampering with success
In fact, haven't you heard me in the past say the slogan on this place is mess with success
What I was doing a nine share they were messing around all you shouldn't do this and
I'm a map you know you had almost a 10 share of 2554. I know and now they're down to a two four
I know well that Dr. Vots boy. He's really performing. He's performed quite a lobotomy on that audience hasn't he and and stand sounds just
You know he just sounds so full of despair. Yeah, well hopefully that he's got a bit of all his chronic hangars on
He might make a little he might bounce back a little
Well, he was fooling around of course as you mentioned Kane has made his move. Oh, yeah, here we go
Here's a here he is ladies gentlemen
Public defender of citizen Kane public defender number one you got to be 25% of the audience wait a minute
Can I say something to you as is a as a as a stupe radio observer of the passing broadcast scene you must realize that these rolling numbers
Include months that are going to disappear now the IOD November and December Gustup exaggerated dolphin months are going to disappear
When January February and March are left to stand all on their own you following me Lee I follow and I have a feeling that the incredible
The overstated especially reneering in the morning and Mr. Paine in the afternoon
You're gonna see you're gonna see some regression there come February okay when the February numbers come out
Yeah, I'm predicted on your show at all sincerity. I mean Michael the system was going to take over the dominance of a.m. Talk
I got news for you Steve wait wait a minute. Wait a minute. Steve is gonna take over the dominance of a.m. Talk and let's let's get
Out the Montevati records in
He's the one they call for the Oprah show. He's the one wait a minute when I turned them down
He's the one that they call okay. I turned down the Oprah show. I've turned down crossfire three times
We encouraged them to call him okay
Because the guy's got an ego bigger than Mount Everest. So let's feed it
But when people you know nationally think of target this market they think if Steve Kane no, I hate to break the news
Yeah, I really do, but I think that you're leaving somebody out okay?
I'm talking about a.m. Oh, yeah, I'm absolutely
I've died I I had to team far and away the the number one radio personality in this whole market
Yeah, you say that again Lee the number one radio
Okay, okay without eight down you on the shadow of a doubt well
How come then Steve has this problem? Okay? Why doesn't he want to admit that?
Why is he so paranoid and petty and jealous? He's making a lot of money
He's got no show over there. He doesn't have to work too hard because they don't have time for any show
He's bringing back the same boring guest and contrived controversy and yet you continue to be public defender number one
I mean Michael the sisto the
Lieberman the jahoba's witnesses
Look what scientific creationist wrestlers look what's like any couple more prediction. Oh my god
Good okay
Well, what that big right now who's gonna be doing that show sit down for this one. Okay, Mike Miller will return
You will continue his thesis on whether new coke or all co
You need me in the punch that was gonna be my next question. That was gonna be my very next question
Are you drinking Jerry coke or regular coke caffeine-free or with and you know that will get
Just add to the would they call themselves the weather station now? I don't know if you've caught that yeah, they sure are
Have the question is whether anybody is listening
Hey, look at this. Lee is coming up with lines now that he's got on the air if you want to come up with these while you're on the air
Maybe it's still be over there. Dale if I was
Whomever against you. I didn't have a chance. That's true. I didn't have a chance
But I enjoyed the fight you notice it's interesting when Alice has any competition
He crumbles under the pressure. You notice that that he is
He is really one of the victims of all of these changes, and I mean that sincerely out. I like al very much
He's a nice guy, but you know, he's in the twos the two fives. Yeah
What do they do to help them they add more business shows?
They add more news more traffic and not only that but the signal is dissipated so badly now that I really some days
I wonder if they're on the air just faking it. Yeah, that's right
And if they weren't no one wouldn't no one would notice right away
Here comes the guy who fills our machines in a kitchen. I wonder if he brought any home in Tasha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
I kind of day looks pretty good to me. I doubt it by the way, Mr. Fowler
It's Diet Coke no caffeine just for the record. Okay, I had Coke no caffeine
And what about the rumor that ed till god forbid is gonna be doing middays at IOD
Well that that rumor persists
A contract was sent to him, but he's trying to find somebody to explain what a mean story. Yeah, I believe they
Maybe he can call maybe he can call John Levitt up in Palm Beach and John can interpret it for him
other exciting you know another exciting news is that
uh... time like us is very unhappy and feeling really well good let's bring
a back here you can do another pornographic dating show
no longer the program director and fact when he comes back here he won't have
to buy a house he can just be one
uh...
listen yeah as the other night at avatura someone i've put on a few pounds
have you really and somebody came up behind me and thought i was Debbie Ellis
i mean that's it
well i hope i hope i'm a
to close leave you know i'm saying
listen it's really refreshing to hear from you and uh... keep in touch as they say
because obviously there are a lot of chit-chatchit changes coming in this
market absolutely and again the you know if uh... if you're willing to do
afternoons with stand there's hope for him but other than that
good luck to him yeah see you later congratulations and again happy
anniversary thanks a lot what a great guy huh you bet he's a great guy now that he's
not on the air anymore when he was on the air he was kind of a smuck but now that
he's off the air he's a swathing

a little history a little radio history there i said yes radio history a moment that will live in
infamy the anals of broadcast history boys and girls at six thirty one on zeta four and the kind
of interesting that Cooper City is still not checking in with us you think they're that embarrassed
do you think they're conspicuous by their absence yeah what do you ought to hang their heads in
shame i mean they're wonderful kids but jeez to be so dumb is to come on the year and announce
skip day try five there's a Cooper City on fire oh is there really i wonder if it could be
Alan hello no not Alan how long god it's harland yeah my voice sounds like crap but don't worry about
what's the matter harland what's going on man how come your voice is all scratchy harland
uh i told you we went away and uh i guess we put that too much of a good time you know
oh did you really yeah i guess uh what do you mean you went away
guys have to embarrass himself people from Cooper City why can't you have uh both of them for what
you know so the audience can rag on them or ask the many questions that they want to ask
you all about okay that's good that's a good idea we'll bring him in here one of these
days if he's agreeable to it see i don't ordinarily don't like those ask the program director things
because they're corny and they're just the stupid yeah one hundred doesn't well yeah
he's gonna try yeah maybe if we ever get a 10-year-old program director like why 100 you would do it
i love those commercials there's just a great hey we can't we ask you what you want to do
with it well there are a reason i only reason i like the commercials is there a couple of people in
the spots who are really interesting but you only see them very briefly yeah you know what i mean
okay listen have a great day all right Neil it's great uh great uh i'm 48 minutes it's been good
for you okay i'll see you in Asia all right okay we got some Asia like in Siberia we don't play
Asia on this station do we we've got three cuts but we don't play him do we i think so we do
i don't know the past few weeks but months ago uh-huh are they right next to the
uh davidly Rothkatz just tell me okay but north cuba date county hello
let's get to the important stuff why does this um tell me a few days ago you talking about the ratings
how much did you beat tr by let's see we had a four one and they had a three one
on which age group that's 12 plus and in 25 to 54 we had a five six and they had a four two
you killed them yeah we destroyed them we wiped them out are they second or was it somebody in between
oh no they weren't second and we're even close to being second we have a bunch of stations in between
but are you talking you know like why 100 you're talking justations that uh nobody would listen to like
what what's that you like you what are we talking about no no i'm talking about stations like
y 100 and waxy and um gloves 94 they're way down the line oh yeah gtr is in a flat spin man they're
dropping like an atomic bomb over hero shimam tonne i think the reason is because the other show is
really you know other than yourself there's the only ones that have any to me any ability at all
but they don't do anything they're never on all he do is i've got a jukbox over there i don't
think they're funny to begin with to be honest with you some of the situation we're funny well what's
it a great while but i mean who wants to listen for four hours and you know hoping on a wing in a
prayer that today we might hear something entertaining yeah but uh they're they're just not on
they got a jukbox you know and they have that stupid promo that says a hermitemic bean and music
in the morning what a novel concept which is basically like saying you know they're hanging around
here but we're playing a ton of music the reason they're saying that basically because everybody you
know this sounds as you've come on and turned to talk basically yeah well yeah see but joy of course
is going to be on of their soon unfortunately we like him to stay forever but that just can't go on
forever and she is playing more music they're making joy play more music you gotta bring back
Jimmy and Steve who Jimmy and Steve I mean yet you have a death wish for them all together don't you
those guys are bad yeah oh i'm just curious about the number they're not they're not as zany as
joy is yeah so how far ahead are you everybody else where are you in what numbers where's the
closest person to you in what in 25 to 54 uh we tied with sonny he had a five six we were number
two in the market CMQ FM the Spanish language beat us but in english speaking we were tied
for first with sonny with a five six and then there was a lot of people right behind like i think
i don't have it in in front of me but i think waxy had about a five five and gloves had a four seven
and gtr had a four two and uh basically they're not going to roll mark the gtr's hurting once put it that way
gtr's beginning to hurt and she is dead in the water and uh we're slowly but surely making some
inroads you know i was just curious okay see you later bye boy jump she says on another
words he's whipped so to speak right yeah listen i saw an ad in uh sonny's mami herald in the
classic fight yeah or babysitters for girls only but the number was six two four ninety four hundred
between the hours of two and six no that's a put on obviously it must be from the same
up people in kendal who put the other stuff in the uh in the uh high school results in the
sports section must be well has dwindling my wife yet her he's still just hanging out he's still
floundering you know no the bleep ethal blum is who is that a total traveler from k a t one i
first went to k a t she was on the weekend the uh travel yenta yeah yeah she's been trying to get
on over there when i was working over there it was incredible yeah she was trying to get on and he's
also got a plan show on the weekend now up up your plans or something like that so congratulations
mark you let's hear it from our return to y and z into a parking lot in uh in less than five months
uh now wait a minute we got the total traveler the total traveler hathold blum and then we have the
up in the black man and rusty nail road for get all rusty when we're going to start doing you
and your swimming pool rusty my pipes are a little bit messed up rusty rusty uh do you think there's
some color he's uh sound asleep it's three minutes till six on zeta four now let's give those numbers
out it's a Friday morning and i would suggest if you're listening to the show in a car right now any
kind of a vehicle uh we're doing our own little survey here in fact we hired away the program
director from y100 that ten-year-old kid and he's out there counting headlights so turn on those
headlights flash him real nice now and uh that'll indicate to everybody around you that you're
listening to zeta four okay that spot that they are running is the most insipid stupid thing if
you stopped and really thought about what it says oh yeah now they won't play the same record
twice in an hour i think no no that's not what he says he says you won't hear the same song every
hour now what does that mean can you explain that to me it means what i just said that they won't
play the same song twice a one hour that's what it means but that's not what are you i know i know
he says we won't play the same song every hour that's what it means yeah now you you are aware that
this entire um series of spots you know they're sequels right they ask for your input
then they come back and you know they've taken your input now here's what they're going to do
i mean you zeta my me beach fort lotterdale in the palm beaches it's five fifty eights yes
well these were all done at the beginning that's what my point is these were all done at the
beginning they were all done at one time you are aware of that speaking of what nothing
did you have an idea there no that's okay
okay be moody and all that kind of stuff i can't help it i was gonna let you play it
are you sure now later okay oh that's good now he's turning his own pot down didn't hear that that's
sounded really good are you gonna talk into that mic that's up on the ceiling there or what
now now we're gonna make a pledge too okay we're not gonna play the same song twice in one hour
okay you think rosefolders already in the car with our fascist sympathizer general manager
we could only five fifty nine okay now let me ask you a question what it gets to be like six o'clock
like a couple of seconds afterward would that be not playing the same song twice in the same hour
absolutely correct you absolutely got see that's what they're gonna do kids and why 100 they're
gonna play like michael jackson some real wimpy michael jackson record about four minutes of the
hour and then they'll come on with some big i'd you know a whole big song of dance and then they'll
play it again at like a minute after the hour also you can have a cap and a do is big i'de here
yeah and that's a good idea and then you could play it right after but maybe i should play because
it it is kind of what you're talking is it good well it's it's an air check that we got from y 100
i think some all great let's hear that i can't wait getting near the top of the hour with
funny socks on zeta 4 wcta my name is for a lot of the farm vices radio station where we don't
say the same thing every five minutes we guarantee it right hey funny yeah i just hear you say that
we don't say the same thing every five minutes what was that i said did i just hear you say that
we don't say the same thing every five minutes you wrong brain you just broke the rules sure did i got it
funny size on zeta 4
it's six o'clock wzta my me beats for water the the bump beat the you're just out of control again
i don't know what the hell has happened maybe it's all the food that came in this week but anyway
monday morning at eight thirty and this could be the beginning of a series of swimsuit contests
kuper city high allegedly the seniors are having a skip day on monday that's the rumor we can get
some verification on that before the show is over and they're going to be out here in front of the
window perading around in their bathing suits young ladies and men young men and ladies and some
who are kind of like in between and we're going to judge and we'll come up with something we'll find
some albums or CDs or something to give away yeah we got some prizes newy yeah how about some of those
old pink Floyd tickets those ought to be good we got some squeeze some sting tickets ought to be good too
yeah and a little squeeze too okay at six o' three and here are those numbers that you've been waiting
for in date county now it is interesting that they're already like four lines lit up which is pretty
good right but i do remember back on a m do you remember the days when lines used to flash without
the numbers just automatically and we would just punch them up every day and then somebody came
along started doing a screenless Thursday which i thought was an incredibly original idea
in a date county six two oh 3600 that six two oh 3600 and it bowered seven seven nine 3600 now what
do we need to wake the audience up this morning okay and you notice he is nowhere to be found again he's
reverted back to his old tricks he's scrounging for food in the lobby now he really is tell me more about
selling i'm 40 at the top and at the bottom and damn proud of it talking on the air with a mouthful
of food also known as pig radio doesn't make it just as it doesn't make it off the air your
cackling sidekick who cackles at everything whether it's funny or not doesn't make it being
rude to callers who may not be quite as interesting as you'd like doesn't make it calling the
cacklers reading from the life section of us a day news as an insult to all legitimate news
journalists and doesn't make it listen to caller after caller tell you how great you are doesn't
make it and is boring calling your competitors names on the air when they can't respond to you
don't really doesn't make it but is cowardly quite frankly if you were in a market with any
sophistication like Boston or New York issue wouldn't make it would be fighting it out for last
place with the motivation station right Steve Cain spelled C-A-I-N as in Cain and Unable has
challenged you on a number of occasions to go on head to head with them on the air I know you
think issue oriented programming sucks but why don't you take him up on it it could make for some
great radio and if things got a little tough you could always start cackling sign Susan Martin
in Fort Lauderdale shut it dumb douchebag okay incredibly dumb what a miserable bitch why does she
listen is yes I'll be interested to see if listen to this I'll be interesting to see now so
what you know what you're dealing with a road scholar like Susan this great I'll be interesting to
see if you have the balls to read this letter over the year I don't think you will but perhaps some
of these other guys with the low ratings might it'll only take a couple of them to reach an audience
the size of yours although it won't be filled with little boys from Cooper City high school boy boy
carbon copy Steve Cain Paul Isle Joy Reynolds Greg B. Della Jeff Charles let's hear it for Susan
we got a real douchebag you dumb bitch she's probably not away from any of you know here she's
listening right are you kidding me she wouldn't miss the show she gets sexual excitement from this show
out of word she's got one of those vibrator radios oh my god it's incredible in fact if you
knew where all of us were right now I like it I feel like I'm being sucked into the grand canyon
ladies and gentlemen this is good it's 11 past not much I just want to ask a question what do you
think is going to happen to this Robert W Walker after he testifies and all those goodies I don't
know anything about a while they're going through that license thing now over there oh that's
a pay all the deal oh still no it never really stone and everything and it's like they got they got
one company that wants to get one hundred off the air and everything and they're creating a whole
big scandal and he took cocaine or whatever to play the records and stuff well I don't know what's
going to happen but I do hope that they stay on the air because I like stations that I have 10-year-old
program directors oh god damn yeah can I sniff a little vixen piece here what do you love
I mean he's injecting an air from a bobby get out my how about it
it was me I'm sure we won't be coming around for a while the late miss apple bomb no Carmen has
done something with this apple bomb yeah the no seem that bad it didn't hurt that much
just because you pushed it down the elevator shaft oh he's not that hey yeah Carmen well anyway
less than a two I don't know what we're going to do here folks less than a 20% chance for isolated
showers today with a high around 80 big decent day and tonight no rain low of 70 but by the weekend
we're going to get a chance for some rain with a high around 80 and the chances even greater on
Sunday not a great boating weekend with small cracked advisory in effect 73 is the temperature
this morning at power night come on in here mr. announcer yes step right up to the microphone
the announcer has an idea oh yes sir ahead time now for America's favorite radio program
tyrone answers electronic equipment provided by tyrone and now here's the lovely
here's tyrone with the days topic oh yes something from his apple bomb is me tyrone
advise the power 96 shut the door thank you today's topic is hubcaps
5509 696 and of course that's built uh but you know what it's built just valid
cap hubcaps only one question per person though and the winner will give away a trip to hubcaps
heaven yes indiana's ball 30 seconds while waiting already taking good care of brunch
and you notice by the way the spots the desperation is some of the radio stations in this market
I watched the apromo last night for y100 with a 10 year old program director
and there are all these big momentous announcements from all these momentous FM radio stations on
almost a daily basis now and the new one is we're not going to play the same music every hour
that's something you need that's what he said isn't that great did he really so the thing that
Glenn was saying that's for real that it's they're not going to play the same music every hour and
I'm maybe every other hour but not every hour and that's supposed to be like some major breakthrough
that's weird because you told us that we know what I hear the same crap over and over again
now we never did find out what hot 105's message we found out what we did when off the year then
