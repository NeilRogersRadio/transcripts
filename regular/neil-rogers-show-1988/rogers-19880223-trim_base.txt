I'm telling you so.
Okay, Neil, that's it.
Thank you.
Bye.
Oh my God.
You know, if you read it in the hero,
you know, it must be true, right?
I hope she forgave me.
We have the date edition.
How come we don't get a brown edition?
Wasn't my fault.
See, if I subscribed to it,
I could bring it in from the house anymore.
Sorry.
There's an idea.
Mm, sorry.
Mm.
I just said it was an idea.
Didn't say it was a good one.
Mm.
Don't give me that.
Good, good, good, good.
I'm going to get the herald.
Is this man out of his line?
Yo, Jay.
All right.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Okay, now let me ask you a question.
Okay.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
If you were writing that news story for AP,
would you have written the last sentence quite the same way?
Well, you know, it depends on the circumstances, you know.
Maybe police said, put it out that they just wanted to talk to this kid, you know.
Maybe she's reflecting the police attitude.
Right.
Yeah.
They just thought it might be a little curious.
Well, yeah.
They can't accuse him yet, see?
Or they'll get in trouble.
Well, see, that's probably a very small town.
And police are different in small towns and they are in major cities.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Anyway, yeah, anyway, now what are who is loosely Cooper that wrote that review?
I want to lend a Cicero does the budget, the budget restaurants for the herald and loosely
Cooper who used to be a guest in my show until Alice until I put her on a payroll over
there.
Yeah, until they started paying their guests.
Yeah.
But at any rate, she must have done that because she does brown.
Lucy does brown.
You've seen that flick.
Sure.
Couple times.
And I got news for you.
If Lucy Cooper really believes that this is a three star, Threatoria, she calls it boy.
There's only one thing I can say to you, Lucy.
You be LA.
Okay.
I knew that was going.
Yeah.
Well, see, I went through all that trouble.
I might as well use it for something.
23 after not.
I'd say to for it.
We'll be back right after these important words.
Okay, it's 26 past six or nine or 10 or 11.
Isn't that something I really thought it was 26 after six.
I had no idea.
The day of the week, it is what month, what year?
Well, it's been that kind of morning, you know.
And if you missed the 738 o'clock half hour, so did we.
Okay, because we were knocked off the air because the AM here with their new wood,
BS, whatever it is with their new power search power trip, power trip.
I think power search would be a better word for listener search.
They have stole our juice.
Okay.
And they overloaded into circuits with their new one tower thing with their non directional
crap.
And they knocked the whole building off the air.
Okay.
There was a lovely room with an Arlene Ross backed into the transmitter and hit it with
her with her right cheek.
And it's possible.
That could be true too.
So I should laugh.
I'm.
Yeah.
You were in hysterics.
What do you do?
Well, I wasn't hysterics.
Thank God she's on the air and she can't hear the show.
Who cares?
It's true.
If you'd like to hear the news from Mount Rushmore ladies and gentlemen, tune to 940 on your AM
dial.
Okay, we got a caller from Pontiac Michigan on the line.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
How you doing?
This one, let you know you do have Michigan fans out here.
From Pontiac, huh?
Yeah, I was born in Pontiac.
What did you do?
Living the silver dome?
No, we lived for a while then and moved Battle Creek and then Williamson.
Battle Creek.
Yeah.
All right.
What a great town it is.
The most famous place in Battle Creek is the railroad tracks.
Am I right?
Yellowwoods.
Yeah, I know.
And Detroit's always been the most happen city in Michigan.
It's not bad about it.
Well, that's because the rest of what, you know, I lived in Kalamazoo for two years.
That's not a bad town.
You've never been to Kalamazoo?
Pretty good town.
Isn't it right next to Grand Rapids?
I mean, no, Battle Creek.
It's right next to Battle Creek, and you're not over there?
No, we always went to the lakes.
Usually I have to gun like.
Oh, yeah, gun like?
I know it very well.
Yeah, he's the stay by all the proves here.
Well, how's the favorite next is?
Yeah, well, maybe you ought to invite Geraldo Rivera to come back and do a show from your house.
Well, I just want to call on it.
I got an idea for you guys.
First 16 on the next next guys show.
Mm-hmm.
A lot of the commercials that you guys missed and the half-hour you're down.
Yeah, that's an idea.
Well, I will think about it.
Just want to call on it.
I like your show a lot.
Thank you.
Did you ever eat a loose finder, Deli and Detroit?
No.
Like I said, I may have been to Detroit a couple times with buddies in school.
I was ages ago and I'm 30 years old.
Don't remember much of it.
Well, believe me, you're better off for it.
Okay, have a great weekend.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
929 on Zeta 4, the near Roger Show.
So old watch's name, Gonzo will be along.
No, he won't.
10-10.
Mm-hmm.
That's correct.
Why do I keep thinking, what a silly guy I am.
I think he's going to be here at 10 o'clock.
Wishful thinking.
This show goes till 10 after 10 now.
Tell your boyfriend, your girlfriend, or both.
Now today, we should stay till about 10-40 because we missed a half-hour, don't you think?
Can you cut his mic off?
Yeah, that power.
It was just a...
I think he needs a Rick Edwards brain transplant.
Oh, my God.
Hello, judging from what he just said, I think he's already had it.
