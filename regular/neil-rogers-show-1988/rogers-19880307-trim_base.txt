oh boy i just don't know what this show is degenerating into the i just have no
idea it's all your fault to the disgusting uh... vulgar display at the
table last night there were people uh... swooning and passing out just
watching what
and and like the stranger this total stranger they bring over to the table
fruitcake of all people uh...
and i have no idea what he was doing with her i'm sure not much uh... and bring
and plans her down next to you and right away the bird is like who in her ear
and grabbing her body part and she was liking it that's the thing i couldn't
understand absolutely why new her
i had never met her but i had talked to her before you know her why talk like in
the family way i like in the generic but this was this was i finally met her
in a biblical sense and and something i guess you don't realize about me but
when there are beautiful women around me yeah i
like like river phoenix
phoenix not a woman well
you could change that i guess well anyway that barbie was
here's yet to i just your lawns eight or four
no she was gorgeous and i uh... just uh... was friendly and i'm a friendly guy
isn't that the right word friendly
you pronounce it i think i think leteris
where they're working for
okay i'm a leg
no i'm glad that you brought that up because i was me before i wanted to make a
point and that is
it's always nice to meet people in the audience in the overwhelming majority
of the more nice and they behave
fairly rationally
but there are some of them who come in there like
diving all over people's bodies and did you see that did you see the show
that she put on last night yes i like that she was you like that i enjoyed that
i'm not used to and nobody's diving over my body i'll tell you that now we get
to the real
in other words if i'm going to be in the middle of an orgy i don't want to be
just like sitting there ignored
finally it took an hour right twenty minutes like i mean he got if wiki would have
died across the table and just given me a big hug or a squeeze if you would say
word one right exactly i felt a lot better but i was like the odd man out so to speak
got it and that's not okay that doesn't
and that was like doing swan dives over majors lap and uh... then she had at the
end there she had they've we had a get uh... crane to excavate him from her body
i couldn't believe it that's right and uh... there was some wild stuff going on
there what was that all about uh... i can't answer those questions boy
that was at the other end of the table i had my hands full so to speak at my end of
the table i see what you're saying i would be the same way as you in that situation
the odd man out i kept hearing at aims he was humming it aims my cup run a
the over remember that i couldn't believe it was going on yeah we got that
her's that right in zeta four here's melody d'amore by the aims brothers
uh... what's his name and blue note has that at aims record i bet he does
but if you've got like stocking that company or something or what i mean
right people but she's here every day are you ready to get on the log
and you look rather pale i thought maybe you're feeling well
i i just didn't know i was feeling fine i was just not i wasn't getting in on
any of the action that's why was pale i felt that you know i made a button just
to you yeah
well as a great but in some by the way i'm real happy about that presentation
you and i did to fruitcake

anybody we know needs to get

meet to sink your teeth into in this letter
dear neil

here comes regarding bill cost for it
do play the tape of the last show you two did together
i remember that she was being embarrassing you made that man's squirm
some people simply cannot take that kind of pubic public attack against the
court
even if it's only a joke
i say i don't think we'll see mister cost for back on that show
ninety four ninety we give that number in passing just in case anybody in
boka might be listening
caller said that as soon as rick peter's
non-compete ends
that jerry solven will be gone
well peter's is the consultant yeah on magic when he comes in full-time
jerry solven goes out according to this rumor that's a rumor but that
great lot of anybody i know deserves a jerry you do

party yeah with a ghetto blaster and a whole bit you know the guy you know
the little drop you have because Neil Rogers the rock and roll monster yes
and okay now what do we want to hear that yeah let's hear that right now
Neil Rogers the rock and roll monster yeah now what would you think
if i said to you the guy who does that who says that okay what would you
think if i told you that's the same little boy who does the top of the hour
id i would say he probably had the operation
and of course the the operative question in the interesting how we work the
operative question it is was the operation before he sounded like this or
before he sounded like that that's the question it is the same person yeah it is
the same person at the through harmonizers you know all this incredible
equipment they have over here well why would anybody want to go through a
harmonizer to sound like a 10 year old boy okay camp david can you play the
little boy it's talking about Neil Rogers or something
quality rock and roll 94.9 zeta for where back
Neil Rogers the rock and roll monster yeah you're right at the very beginning you can hear
the similarity in his uh absolutely in his lungs yeah it's shocking isn't it is shocking it's just
shock radio unbelievable i heard that rumor end credible it is incredible that long ground now for
some reason you they want to just a joke they wanted to keep that a secret from it's just a radio
they didn't want you to know that why is that i have no idea a little frisky yeah is that the word
as in cat food man like to probably think of other by the way kids if mommy and daddy you're
going to be out of the house today and you're staying home from school and that pet kitty is you
know bugging you and giving you a hard time i'm not going to say but i'll give you a little hint
stands microwave went out over the weekend it did yeah that's what he said i'd like to get back
to this story about the visitor from philadelphia you know the okay so what does that mean was that a
false alarm the captain gave us more bad information well he gets all these mysterious phone calls from
see now you know one cut was real nice you know but i know that that white album they tend to run
together a little bit i was listening into lace oh i see that's what he was born as ladies in
gentlemen no extra charge bonus on zeta four where you get the entire cut and two or three two or
three what i was four seconds on grooves from the next cut it's monday so you see he's nervous
because he gave us all that bad information about the trends and about the book which isn't going
to show anything no where did you get that did you get that from a mr cake i'm going to verify
this the source yeah cuz they say noon here well it came over the extension line so i just
assumed well what was it like a hollow voice a faceless voice in the middle of night are you
turning into howard beel it was a youngish type of voice like a high pitched whiny uh kindle sounding
kept david it sound like it came from kindle yeah that's kind of sounded like that kid who does the
ID oh yeah then it was through k and what did he say he may have the number he said what i wrote down
there oh yeah he says he says the trend just came over the computer he says his tell Neil that
it's unbelievable and he'll be pleasantly surprised now as you know his his predictions on the numbers
always because he gets him first because the mung brains in this building they can't get the
computer to work you know it's because he's got it all tied up we only pay for it yeah you know
but i think some of us always pay for it well let me let me ask the lady if she please let's
fight out you know this is pressing information i was to come back this afternoon and be on with
briefly really going to do that just briefly with
