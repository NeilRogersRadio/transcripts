from time when it wasn't going to come with that but he just came running in here
like a idiot a 26 on Zeta poor now speaking of idiots here is Paul so I have no idea what
this magazine is do you know wait till you hear this this is the January 19th issue for those
who know what it is yesterday morning personality Neil Rogers at Zeta for Miami is ill
some say it could be serious and lingering we hope rumors are not true what meanwhile though his
absence allowed Joey Reynolds at WS a.t. to make some strong headway as the book started Reynolds
with sidekick Bill Marshall never sounded better have you ever heard such crap in your life where
did that come what is this magazine the pulse of broad oh it's another one of those broad chasing
magazines yeah can you believe that they never sounded better well I got news for if he never
sounded better that's a hell of a commentary on his career isn't it because if you listen to him
lightly man it's just like he's going through the motions they forgot to miss him whereas baggy
pants anymore really no they forgot to mention you were sick in between the yeah isn't that interesting
well there were no ratings being taken could be serious and lingering now Joey's problem is serious
in lingering for about 30 years now but that's another story it's called no ratings feels like a
wishful thinking swishful thinking to me I can't believe this from pulse for that out of here
talking about it I knew in x here from today Ronald Reagan will be a former president thank god
for that oh boy throw that out well if we can survive that long that's excellent news 365 days 829
I'd say to four let's go back to the calls and thanks to whoever put that stupid piece of crap
in pulse I have a lingering illness from reading that crap Dave County hello hello how you doing
yeah good I just want to tell you that I got called by one of these rating services last night
might birch Tom birch I don't know who it was but it was really well because the first thing he
started off saying was what's your number one radio music station and without hesitation I said
day to four but I thought this question was kind of loaded by saying number one radio music station
up that you guys don't play music but that's not what your famous work mm-hmm
strange I just try to let you know that also but I heard that you already mentioned that
somebody in the office here said you already mentioned it before but the the reason that all
these women are supposedly listening to uh the lawful stations is because they're piping it
into their brain all day long yeah that's true yeah yeah girl in the office here every time I talk
to her she's got to turn the music down because uh music now that's that is a good point during
tremendous number of women of secretaries and nurses and whatever they work in offices and they
have that crap piped in in the background of their captive audiences and I guess they feel compelled
to write it down in their diaries that they're listening even though they're like passive they
just happen to be there yeah I mean I think they think that that's what music is you know
well I'll tell you one thing if I were an advertiser it would be a cool day in hell before I would
put any I'd buy any advertising on one of those stations that's just like a background a subliminal
kind of a background service because nobody's paying any attention speaking of advertising uh I
I realized the value in the American capitalist system of uh of advertisers and everything and I
won't mention any names that you've put on the air but uh I really hate loud car commercials
and I have to say that's the only time my uh possibly changes channel is when I hear one of those
but uh you've earned you've earned a button on my car's story so my lad that makes it worth
a while okay thanks a lot thank you boy boy 832 i'd say to four and if we've earned a button on his
thing that can't be all bad right that's good news we all want to earn a button that's right
like this one here that says get a life that's my that's my button right we have an open line
in date 620 3600 that's our date county number and of course if you live in date county that's
probably the one you ought to dial all or you can always dial a brown number sure
like if you're messed up in the brain like if you're a moron those are the kind of colors we love
and if you're joining us at midstream our subject for the day has been brain surgery for pigmies
now seriously we're talking about uh what our good dear friend on am was discussing yesterday
of course he only uh talked about a little bit of it because he didn't want to fess up that am
is dead now we've already taken that as a given because you notice most of these people now the
couple of mentioned allis or whatever but very few of these people talk about am because am is
passe it's finnie at least in this market dead d ed boy it went down quick to didn't it
mm-hmm yeah the twelfth of october of last year it kind of died okay where are we going now to a
brown word county hello i don't know where good buddy yeah how you doing pal i'll listen to that
other station uh shoot what is it w shoot yeah oh boy do you really yeah my girlfriend says get
down to that funky music white boy yeah get down tonight that's k c does that really
no no it is well he didn't get down tonight but this caller doesn't know from k c from get down from
anything play that funky music white boy yeah who did that uh Jimmy the greek wild cherry wild cherry
that's right pretty impressive yeah we're gonna be playing that any minute right after you're
simply read and that'll fit together won't it wild cherry and simply read that'll be magnificent
well yeah that'll be on that'll be great on god's his grill at lunchtime
what you say you can have cherries jubilee never mind never mind sir just keep rolling man you're
on a real roll now what is your story hello me in other words what is it you want to tell us
sir besides funky white boy get down wedr whatever rap crap what is he want to say i don't know
how about goodbye that would be a good start 27 till nine on zeta four now one of the interesting
things in the book now stand keeps talking about the numbers and it's it i want to tell you stand
because i know you're listening to the show either now or on tape it's embarrassing okay i mean
it's one thing when the numbers come out we've always traditionally whether they're great or
mediocre whatever always talked about them for the whole market and for the art own show but
after the you know the 10th week it gets a little bit old you know what i'm saying well we got
27,000 254 man and we got you know i mean give it a rest but one of the interesting things is
we were kind of like all the way across consistent right around a four which means we did
better than that because that included that horrible month when we were in here in October but
the last hour i would have thought in the nine o'clock hour would have been comparable to what i
used to do on a.m. you understand what i'm saying because there's nothing else really going on
and one has to wonder what it is between nine and ten you follow what i'm saying that should be
a monster hour for the show and it's not it's not the big hour it was not a bad hour but it's not
the big hour. It was very big as it was closed but it was not a gigantic monster hour which
it ought to be. Well you think it's got to be that sandy patent factory. Oh yeah that's
true i forgot about it we're up against a most stiff competition and probably the collectibles
guys been on a couple of times during that book that well man you can't you can't beat that collectibles
we can't even begin to. How sandy i've got a 1902 toaster that's run by kerosene
let's have a punch toast for sandy okay like right in the mouth well she is she is so bad you know
she she to me she is the epitome of radio in this market mediocrity yeah mediocrity she is so
bland and so mediocre and so boring and so repetitive and so just absolutely vanilla
and that's she's the epitome of the broadcast media in this market just bland and totally useless
quintessential vanilla program and here's Bobby bland on zeta four Bobby blue bland right
okay let's go to broward county hello yes mad flasher yeah that's what i figured
how do you figure because i saw i saw on the phone line that there was a little rubber rain code
what do you think of my show not not much i think you you and stan have both given new meaning
to the word no show i'm thinking about flashing the santeria house next what do you think well listen if
you value your chickens sir i would keep it keep it at home you want another show no enough was
enough enough was enough yeah there's more to show you though well i don't want to see it's okay
okay what do you mean if you know johnny depths home address give us the number but that's about
a pretty we have an open line in brown and seven i think i comes up here you remember that
how can i forget stupid little brown car and a drove up here and a guy came running up
and he opened up his raincoat and he had on like some stupid shorts and t-shirt or whatever
i mean not like not undershorts but regular shorts with thank god because he was ugly and
and he opened the coat and stuck his tongue out like a mad lunatic and ran back into car and a
drove out then he came back in again and you know i mean what it again did it yeah i think
the new rule is going to be we don't want any ugly people flashing in our window okay i think it's
poignant that the thing that sticks out in your mind most of all is the color of the car so that
i'll give you that was that that was the most memorable part of the whole situation okay does that
answer your question sir that's not too good uh date county hello a new yeah is his Jose yeah Jose
Buenos dias i've been there yeah almost done yeah much of bueno hello a show today i know really
good topic you may not feel very good but it is coming through now wait a minute what do you say
me i mean i feel very good why did you say that you said you were in a in a funny mood today no i
i'm mentally i'm physically i feel fine but mentally i'm ready for a nervous breakdown i'm just
right on the the very edge right on the razor's edge of going over the brink yeah well
mentally you coming through loud and clear yeah i'm going to solve that though because i'm going to
have all the phones in my house disconnected because that's where a lot of my problem is that's right
i tell you what a major part of my problem not as in stand major but oh please no it's time
major i listened to him yesterday well that was pretty exciting one you fright no show yeah no show
at all no show if they made you program director you'd have number one rating well i don't want to be
programmed director i get out of here at 10 o'clock and i like it that way i don't want to have
to really work but uh they got everything else on tape so they might as well put program director
on tape and just let it roll all day and they listen to your music that's a good idea i think they
got to just put the whole station on tape the rest of the day well i tell you what after you
is no more no more say that that's it really well why is that well i got to super cool
all super cool yeah oh wait i don't listen to that either listen i pull a week ago my wife is
really turned on to you now really i know it's not dangerous so i'm i'm i'm okay you're
absolutely safe in my hands sir i know i know right at the end of the year and i ask you for
a special song i don't know if you don't play the song anymore but if you please do me a favor

it like it is right it's about time don't you think even when it hurts it hurt it hurt it hurt
yes it do leave me yes okay well listen we're gonna get it all straightened up trust me in fact
we're gonna change the format again three times this week that's right it's only wednesday dr. vats
okay uhbroward county yes sir yeah last night i've listened to you for years and i
switch all around on the radio here wait a minute sir wait a minute you said you swish all around
i was listening to our last night when him and Debbie were speaking of swish all around there
and seven and guess who found him i know it was this person it wasn't jack sturdy was it oh it was the egg
like pretended like they didn't know what it was of course you know they did and i just know it was the egg
because of the hang up you know oh yeah what do you have a lot of good bursting there and
not so Alice was bursting yeah man probably too much strength to force feed you that little kid bit
that's pretty exciting yeah so he does have a sidekick now in other words i'm correct that be
Alice yeah yeah that's pretty revolution yeah but i just want you to let you know and i can't
i can't stand the phone very well okay well say goodbye oh goodbye bye okay that's excellent a little
a tidbit from one of our zeta radio spies it's eighteen before nine and there's an open line in brown
and seven seven nine thirty six hundred i will say this in fact there there really aren't any
open line they just to go and nuts here today it's been a wild topic and you know why
because these people are pissed yeah okay they're sick and tired of being turned off by these music
programmers who don't know they're grass from their elbows you know i saw i saw the music director
smoking an elbow i'm serious it was frightening but you know the stand was not begging for calls just
that's true plenty of the i called in at the other show and i said you finally got a good topic
and it's about time struck a nerve or something yeah and i'm delighted he had all those herman
and McQueen fans call it in all three of them i think all of them work the gtr by the way
because from that first call it was such an obvious setup oh no that was it now i most listeners
say we uh do this and we do that you know when they're referring to a particular radio station
and then they say oh no i don't work there i'm just a fan oh yeah just part of the fan club
mm-hmm bulldozer like the program director something like that what does that say caller number five
gizantite captain mong hello hello nil yes sir i'm a royal listener and i've been listening to you so
uh morning this morning wow and uh i want to touch upon a couple things first of all
touch this um not right that's just a joke sir hi i understand first of all uh not to stick up for
captain Dave but voices by rest ballot happens to be a staple at a or a radio no wait a minute he
didn't say though he never heard of it either that was a caller who said that oh that was a caller
yeah okay it happens to be a very heavily requested song i don't know the song i don't
think they're fast you know i mean i'm not suggesting that i'm the the maven on music i don't know the record
okay uh maybe if i heard it i might recognize it okay because there are those all of us have
records that we don't know the title of the artist but we could recognize the song
mm-hmm that's a very good possibility yep uh next thing is what i don't understand is that when a station
has pretty much for lack of a better term garbage for ratings right data yeah um why the consultant
why bring someone in from another part of the country to tell you what has to be played where
do you want me to give you do you want me to give you a very frank and honest answer about that when
when any radio station or television station in america brings in a consultant any of them you know
what it tells me it tells me that the management doesn't know what the hell they're doing well
obviously i mean if you hire me to be the manager or program director and i go out and i hire a
consultant then i shouldn't have been hired in the first place because the only reason i should have
that job is because i have expertise in programming absolutely absolutely and because i know the market
as you say i mean how the hell can somebody in filanalfia tell us what's popular and what's going to
play in Miami it's the most ridiculous thing i've heard in my life thing go yet these guys are making
fortunes and and we're not yeah they ought to tell these consultants to stick it where the
moon don't trying to take their contract i mean all you got to do is look at what their track record
has been the only numbers at this station's head has been with us in the morning we've only been here
for two months right two and a half months from what i understand too a lot of the stuff that
data is doing is very very similar as a matter of fact lighter for liner almost to what k rock's
doing in new york really yeah a friend of mine was just down from new york this jockey and one of
the fms up there who was who is from this market and he was here for a week listen to data and
basically said that you guys are doing exactly what k rock is doing well they must have some pretty
crappy numbers after howard gets off don't they do i don't know they do because he was on he was on
letterman last night and howard said that the rest of the station is a disaster i don't know if he
was just kidding or something it's in the two yeah yeah so far you guys that's right see the
two more quick things they only wish they were in the two that is um you we were talking about new
music in in the format and you had said that mtv you know they even have a block of new music yeah new
music that they the new videos that they do when their new music hour are also in somewhat of a
rotation all in program is read cg for child rental guidance kitchen slide weather and out their
parents should be allowed to listen because boy this show is really stupid
so are you here you look punk do your homework
mama heads that's high hopes for i still say that that you know we have i don't know eight
nine hundred cds in this building in our library and the number of them that actually get played you
could put in the thimble and have room left over for the chinese army and that's that's the problem
right we were talking before about simply read and the fact okay so they only had two hits but they
were both very very good a or records they fit our format perfectly and you know there's so many
groups and artists who fit into that category that you'll never hear that we don't play on his station
and if we would be playing them there would be less of the field collins and less of the ccr and less
of the john cougar and less of the repetition and and people would stick with it more well i hate to
disagree with you um as good as those simply read records are i don't think you could pigeon them
hold as a or records i think more of a well let me say this to you if little lies by fleet would
mac and i hate to keep using that but that's one of the best examples if that's an a or record and
certainly money's too tight to mention is all right well if you put it all the whole concept of that
record it's a counter culture it's an anti-establishment record how can it not be an a or record
how can it not fit maybe maybe it just doesn't maybe i'm trying to pigeonhole it is not being a rock
and roll record i don't agree with you at all um finally um you are having trouble getting
casing the sunshine band records yeah okay uh i have an original casing the sunshine band
medley uh with all of the hits which was done on a remix description service for this docky if i put it
on the set all right loving okay i'll get that in the mail to you excellent thanks all right uh you have
a great show keep it up thank you you're welcome i'll be great we'll look for that won't we
we can put kc back on the map what's wrong with that it but you know i said that the other day and
uh a couple of people got bent out of shape did they i think so i mean yesterday what we did i guess
was really revolutionary when i put three kc records in the same i guess we played almost four
because i played a little bit of dancing in the street yeah which i noticed got you excited oh boy
why is Richard van hook cut his headlights on again now that was only yesterday Richard come on cut it
out it's a loyal zeta list i know but there's such a thing as being a little too loyal you know okay all
right let's not get carried away he'll be okay wellie sure when's that gonna start okay let's get
another call in before the news those engineers man i'll tell you i've always had this great love
hate relationship and that is a date county hello hi hi i'm i i'm i okay i guess so yeah you're it
i'm home today with a cold so i get a chance to listen to you longer than my morning ride
the morning i gotta tell you your morning ride helps me out a lot great i gotta drive to
to the prime sometimes and people look at me like i'm crazy because i'm laughing behind the wheel

the south dixie highway over across from the uofm specs music by red road yeah okay okay i know
red road and dixie right um i don't know i don't know my brother's name is Neil but that's not what i
was going to say oh well i guess i can't remember now maybe he could get a show we kept the way
we could get in it's lamio yeah a complaint hmm about that's the first one i in other words it got to
you huh yeah i was very surprised you resorted to turning on that song to get people you know
three months i understand we've only played it about five hundred times i don't realize that
that's one thing it's kind of like finished already well yeah but so is his show so that's what
we keep playing we'll try to uh we do anything to revitalize it i understand are you having that
guest tomorrow the kids no we chased him away we don't we got enough pinheads here already without him
