Now, the audience of the day with Neil Rogers.
Neil Rogers.
Neil Rogers.
The number one winner, W-I-O-D,
Xavier AM.
What are you studying?
What's kind of jazz, Ian?
Yeah, 1006 W-I-O-D probably goes on forever,
but you know Mike.
Got a whole bunch of cards here that Mike left us.
You know, one thing about that stuff.
They're either great or exactly.
Now, don't stick your finger away down there, Roger.
Mike, it caught.
Anyway, here we are.
We hope you had a great weekend.
I was out of town, so I have no idea what went on
in this God-for-sake-in-town over the weekend.
Not good.
And, maybe somebody will call.
I'm curious how that big race at Pomfano with Maclowe Bell
came on Saturday.
I know nobody else cares, but somebody will call.
And I'll find out.
Because I wasn't here.
Nothing went on.
Nothing went on?
No.
And the big thing, of course, I was afraid the miss
was the Ernie Soach-and-Show on Saturday.
Oh, I missed it.
Did you miss it, too?
Yeah.
Well, that could be one of our big topics today.
Now, I have a major announcement to make on this
here radio show, and just a couple of minutes,
a gigantic, cataclysmic announcement.
Wow.
But before we do that, almost as cataclysmic is this
announcement, WPBR in Palm Beach, and we want to give this
guy all the help we can.
Oh, no.
Because God only knows he needs it, OK?
Paul Lyle.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
The same one who's sat, not in this chair, because this
studio wasn't here then, but was in his building,
bragging about the fact he was going to get me off the
ear.
If it was the last thing he did.
He's doing mornings now, 6 to 9 a.m. at WPBR in West Palm
Beach.
Now, that's a station very much like FTL, or if you're
going to listen to it, you've got to drive up there and sit
right under the tower.
So you better leave about 430, maybe a quarter to five in
the morning, and a good luck to you.
Now, are you saying this is the Bob Gordon of Palm Beach?
That is correct.
Wow.
That's in line, isn't it?
Isn't it amazing?
FTL.
Now, that's a station that is a monster signal when you're on the
turnpike, it even interferes with us for about a quarter of a
mile.
Anywhere else you can't hear it.
And the people who work there, they all fit into a certain
mold.
There are guys who have, don't belong into business.
There are guys who were washed up 20 years ago who wind up
there as kind of like a last gas.
It's a bizarre place.
Also, another nearly cataclysmic announcement on the Steve
King show today.
Uh-oh.
And you're not going to believe this, OK?
Happy Hanukkah, by the way.
Let me hold on to something.
And in honor of Hanukkah, we have another Rabbi show.
And Sharon was in here banging her head on the wall having an
nervous breakdown.
A debate on who is a Jew legislation, Israel barring not Orthodox
converts from Israeli citizenship with Rabbi Pinkis Phineas
Webberman.
Another one of my good friends.
Pinky?
Pinky Webberman.
Uh-huh.
And Rabbi Loring Frank.
Loring.
Loring.
Or is that Frank Loring?
Now, Frank is a very good-ish name.
And Loring is a very, so maybe it's not even a Jewish
Rabbi.
Maybe it's a good-ish Rabbi.
Steve is so obsessed with these thinking rabbis, man.
In fact, everybody who thinks that Steve, let's see these
phones go crazy, OK?
O'Macklo Bell 1 and paid $2.10.
Thank you, folks, so much.
Anyway, everybody in the audience who thinks Steve's had too many
rabbis, let's get these lines going, OK?
And by the way, we want to thank Mitch Must be responsible for this.
The numbers are now here.
No, you did it.
The numbers.
Mitch did that.
Oh, yeah.
We want to thank him profusely.
Not only do we have the clock, ladies and gentlemen, we now have
the telephone numbers emblazoned permanently on our little thing
here.
What a day.
And boy, when you got number phone numbers emblazoned on your little
thing, that's a really desperation, OK?
And also we have a cassette boy.
We are so full of it for the beginning of the week.
Yeah.
I don't see the lines flashing about the Rabbi, by the way.
Well, there you go.
What does that tell you?
It tells me that what's going to be another one of those Mondays, OK?
Oh, yeah.
Now, last week we had, the week was great except for Monday.
And it was a Monday after a dolphin loss.
What have we always said about that?
Of course, the only problem is we're getting used to that.
Every Monday now is the Monday after a dolphin loss.
That won't happen next week.
You know why?
Because they're playing Monday night.
Oh, then it will be Tuesday.
So nice Monday is going to be great Tuesday.
It's going to be like you're in Kipper, OK?
I'll prepare for that.
Now, I have something for you that you don't know about.
Really?
Something that's going to make you real happy.
