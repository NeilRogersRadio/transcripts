As telephone conversations, yes, it's the Elvis tapes.
Hello, baby. This is Elvis.
And I want you to come over right now and make me a big peanut butter and then a sandwich.
A big little butter and then a sandwich, where they're dripping me through with the day.
You'll hear Elvis in his most intimate moments.
Hello, piece of mail, piece of mail.
Yes, this is the Elvis.
Won't you bring me over?
A couple large paws.
Don't make it, make it three.
Don't make it sex, double cheese.
Yeah, I'm hungry.
I'm alone.
And I'm hungry.
And you'll hear Elvis reveal how he really feels about the one true love of his life.
Won't you back, won't you back, I'm a lot of baby.
And I don't do way back.
Would you pick up some donuts, please?
Make jelly cream donuts.
Crullest Jimmy's day this two.
All of my baby honey glies donuts.
Without them, I can't do.
The Elvis taste.
Give me, give me, give me, give me more donuts.
Available now. We've run stores everywhere.
I want to eat. I want to eat lemon, lemon to do.
I get a big part of this.
It's the Neil Rogers show.
I'm Cedar Four.
How come you guys lost yesterday?
Oh, my question.
L.U.R. on vacation.
I knew there had to be a logical explanation.
The Michigan got kind of warm.
Well, he gets around, doesn't he?
Doesn't he?
Yeah, Michigan got hot up there, didn't he?
Well, great to hear from you, Elvis.
I'm pretty sure this is a loo.
You're a man.
What I want to do is sleep.
You got to sleep and eat.
It's like you have me.
Elvis is everywhere, man.
He's in everything.
He's in everybody.
Elvis is in your jeans.
He's in your cheeseburgers.
Elvis is in nutty buddies.
Elvis is in your mom.
He's in everybody.
He's in the young old, the fat skinny.
The white, the black, the brown, and the blue.
People got Elvis in them too.
Elvis is in everybody out there.
Everybody's got Elvis in them.
Everybody except one person, that is.
Yeah, one person.
The evil opposite of Elvis.
The N.T. Elvis.
N.T. Elvis got no Elvis in them.
Let me tell you.
Michael J. Fox has no Elvis in him.
Yeah, and Elvis is in Joan Rivers.
But he's trying to get out, man.
He's trying to get out.
Listen up, Johnny, baby.
Elvis is everywhere.
Elvis is in everything.
Elvis is in everybody.
Elvis is still the king.
And only one I want you to sleep.
That would be easy to die to give in to you.
Wow.
Man, there's a lot of unexplained phenomenon out there in the world.
A lot of things people say.
What the heck's going on?
Let me tell you.
Who built the pyramid?
Elvis.
Who built stone?
Elvis.
Yeah, man, you see guys walking in the street, pushing shopping carts.
And they think they're talking to Allah.
They're talking to themselves, man.
No, they're talking to Elvis.
Elvis.
Elvis.
You know what's going on?
That promoter triangle.
Down the promoter triangle.
Elvis needs votes.
Elvis needs votes.
Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis.
Elvis needs votes.
Ah, the saline Elvis.
Captain Elvis.
Commodore Elvis.
It is.
Damn, man.
You know, people from outer space.
People from outer space, they come up to me.
They don't look like Dr. Spock.
They don't look like clean-ons.
All that star-tracked job.
They look like Elvis.
Elvis.
Everybody in outer space looks like Elvis.
Because Elvis is a perfect being.
We're all moving to perfect peace and harmony towards Elvis.
Soon, all will become Elvis.
Everything, everywhere will be Elvis.
Why do you think they call it evolution anyway?
It's really Elvis.
Lotion.
Elvis.
Lotion.
Elvis is everywhere.
Elvis is everything.
Elvis is everybody.
Elvis is still the king.
I don't know how I want to see the king.
Not you and me.
Elvis is everywhere.
Elvis is everything.
Elvis is everybody.
Elvis is still the king.
I don't know how I want to see the king.
It's gotta be him.
It's gonna be him.
Oh, great, I never heard that skip roll.
What are you doing?
Okay.
The wife left town with a banana.
Loads are rotten deal.
I found that y'all devil hiding in her purse.
He's cold and he's hard, but he's gotta pee.
I hope it never happens to you.
Some fruit breaks your marriage into.
My wife left town with a banana.
My baby slipped out of the way.
Müzik
The wife left town with a banana.
I'm a jealous man.
She found us six inch Latin Lover.
Now she does the tango with her right hand'.
right now I could just die. He's eaten my banana cream pie, my wife left down, my
banana, my baby's slipping, my baby's slipping, my baby's slipping away.
Although I think she's still working because...
Okay, and now listen, I got a great suggestion. Naturally, the management types there
never take any suggestions. We know that. Right.
But I got a great suggestion on how to make Zeta the number one station in the whole market
all day long. Okay, okay, a lineup. Neil in the morning, Captain Dave in the bird, mid-day.
Stan and Johnny Dark in the afternoon.
Incredible. Never happen, sir. It will never happen, sir.
Am I right? Would it be incredible?
No, it would be interesting, fascinating suggestion.
Great suggestion. Okay, one more thing.
Thing is Neil can't work by himself.
You don't think so? No. Not in your line.
Are you kidding? Oh, I need you to say that.
Well, let me let me let me let me let me
in college. Let me say more because I didn't mean that literally. He's spinning in his
lay right now. I didn't mean that literally, okay?
I mean he wouldn't want to come back to haunt you. He wouldn't want to work by himself.
It's what I meant to say. You don't think so?
I think when Neil's by himself even gets more crazy.
Yeah, because I remember from the AM when he used to just go not to the high school.
Did you hear yesterday 9 to 10?
Oh, he was great.
Wasn't that incredible?
Oh, it was just the old Neil back.
It was, wasn't it? It was just it was absolutely the old Neil.
Yeah, I think this last temptation to Christ things really get them crazy.
Maybe a little bit. Oh, yeah, we got a story on it.
And one other thing, I know you all don't take requests.
Right.
Could it have been any longer?
Yeah. Okay.
Well, we played a couple of jingles.
Yeah, I think that kind of followed.
Why don't you run a jingle while I'm doing this one too?
It's 430 and swinging on the Chuck Benson show.
It's time to go.
I like it.
That's two two hours.
It'll be time to go.
But the classic rock block party starts today at noon.
Rock blocks from your favorite classic artists all weekend.
Long.
It's right from right here at classic rock K-O-N-O.
94.984.
8 o'clock.
And data for WZTA Miami Beach.
Candy dark.
Sixty-six.
Nobody's in your beta.
We have them all.
Bring it back.
Those good memories.
We have any jingle you want to hear.
I found a one card to this.
Got a T.I.A.
Finding all kinds of stuff on cards here.
You could probably find Johnny Dark jingles at other radio stations too.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
All right, let's go.
Candy dark.
Sixty-six.
WNBC.
We just love that.
You know, we just can't get enough of it.
Now, did you used to run that between records or after the news or what did you do?
Coming out of a stop set.
You know, one stop that ends.
I really missed this summer.
And I tried to find it in the Pam's jingles that I found at my mom's house and all.
Oh, yeah.
It's time to turn things that we turn before you burn.
They were great.
Yeah.
It's time to turn.
Now, I have something weird on that.
I'll wait it.
Yeah, this.
That would be found while we were cleaning up the cards this morning speaking of TAN-A.
Went down to the ocean to get myself tan.
Didn't bring no lotion.
I'm too much of a man.
Let me tell you baby, baby.
Better leave me alone.
I'm too much of a sunscreen.
I'm burned to the bone.
Burn to the bone.
To-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to burn,
Burn to the bone.
I walk on the beach.
Men step aside.
He's read as a beat they say.
This guy's really fried.
That looks really painful.
This fool should go home.
Yeah, but hey, pretty my mom, I'm burned to the bone, burned to the bone, burned to the bone, burned to the bone, don't touch me.
When I walked down the street, they all stopped and stared. This ain't just a sunburn, this is medium rare.
I'm thoroughly baked, babe, just like a calzone, let me tell you pretty, baby, I'm burned to the bone, burned to the bone, burned to the bone, burned to the bone, burned to the bone.
Oh, man, you can tell I got a few.
Remember that? That's great. That's good, isn't it? I like it, I like the bluesies.
Now I found this also, and this is just, uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
This portion of our show is brought to you by the new Volkswagen Roger Rabbit.
Keep your car tuned with the car that's a tune, the car tune car, the VW Roger Rabbit.
Nah, not much to that, is it? I've never heard it, have you?
You ever heard it? Yeah, when Neil played on real estate, Neil told John Ford to dub stuff off that ACN, and I think he dubbed off everything.
I know what some of this stuff is, oh, we don't even know, let's see what this is.
Oh, yeah, sure. Here comes, here comes Wendy.
This is Gaffelda and the fish or something. Sure.
Oh, yeah, we need that, okay. All right, let's go to a call.
Well, we do. Well, you know how Neil previews the, uh, sometimes you can do it.
You're so sneaky about it. You know, the word from the bird, we're calling this, uh, what's happening with the cap?
Where is the cap, then anyway?
Well, you know, on a day like today, kind of a muggy morning, you start thinking about what happened in the past on this day.
Oh, and it was on this day in 1970 that Janice Joplin played what proved to be her final concert at Harvard University in Boston.
I didn't know that. And, uh, she was found dead two months later from Odin on that bad stuff.
I mean, it didn't happen like it did in the movie where she just collapsed on stage and that was it.
Well, the movie I saw about her life, she was like in a car chase scene at the end and all these terrorists were like, she dead.
The Hollywood version of her death.
The lap.
I'm gonna stop. I'm gonna stop. I'm gonna stop. I'm gonna stop. I don't know what to say.
I'm going to stop. I'm gonna stop. I'm gonna stop.
I'm going to stop. I'm gonna stop. I'm gonna stop. I don't know what.
Stir from here.
She's the high-freakster TV news.
Bishop.
All right, the high bishop of TV news.
She's anger with a whip.
Ah!
Ah!
That steady gaze, that imposing figure,
that frightened me more.
What else?
It must be anger with a whip.
Ah!
So, so sorry.
I do well, Lather.
It's below the death.
What do you know?
Anger with a whip.
I do well, Lather.
It's below the death.
You know, taking care of your lawn these days,
sure seems complicated.
Big trucks, fancy service contracts,
dangerous chemicals.
You know, all seems so complicated.
So unnecessary, especially now,
when you can call on something as easy and natural as Kim Dog.
Each week, the Kim Dog will personally inspect your lawn.
For weeds and crabgrass,
he'll spray liquid formula number one.
And for those patches where grass just don't seem to grow,
your Kim Dog will apply a special layer of formula number two.
Oh, boy, watch your step.
That's all natural fertilizer.
So if your lawn's looking kind of shaggy,
unleash the Kim Dog.
We may not be the best, but we sure got a leg up on the competition.
Oh, not on my shoe.
Kim Dog!
Kim Dog!
Oh, my foot.
Just sit right back and you'll hear it.
A tale, a tale of a fateful trip.
About two dudes with a fish and pole
and a joint aboard their ship.
The sky was clear, the air was fresh.
The ocean looks so fine.
But some folks were about to,
and their day before they dropped a line.
A co-scarchip was bearing down with nothing else to do.
In search of roaches or some dust,
while tons of coke got through.
Turn round.
Hands in the air, your fish and trip is through.
The dude lost everything they had for just some residue.
The co-scarchoned the boat to port.
They got that's on the back.
A million bucks meant for one joint.
While the city choked on crack.
So keep this little tune in mind.
Remember what it meant.
The task force has to fake results till Bush is president.
The coast guard pierced full of ships.
The owners lost their butts for taking more than beer along.
Here on Governance Cuts.
Well, I look, I could see the numbers in the other.
Now, come on, play this.
This will get everyone in the mood to guess.
Let's, let's, come on.
It's great though.
Didn't it?
Jada Ford.
641.
Good morning to you.
Oh.
Take a breather.
I'd like to meet take a breather.
Where is it time to eat take a breather?
I don't mean it him.
He isn't food.
Although I know some guys.
Wood.
Perse.
What do I see?
Is that home in touch for me?
No Ford take a breather.
I got one other thing.
There's another radio station that asks for good questions.
And I got one.
If you crack a quick brush can he still have any children?
Yeah.
We've heard this.
How about can you die from hearing age?
Yeah.
Well, I saw, speaking of the cock as I saw him seeing in over the weekend,
they got a shirt in New Orleans and it says,
do cock-eye happens?
You heard about that?
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Lots of funny jokes.
Would you bring me here?
And we do have the news beds now.
How about your mama?
Yeah, okay.
I'd like to hear that.
Don't you?
We don't hear your mama too much.
It's 750 on Zeta 4.
I am up.
Stevie Nicks, the distinctive voice of Fleetwood Mac.
Her style is unforgettable.
Her lyrics are unintelligible.

KC's come and's been held down.
Hello, America.
This is KC.
And every week on my coast to coast commandment countdown,
I'll tell you how many of the top 10 commandments
Jim and Tammy Baker have broken so far.
In just one month, they've shattered number nine,
number eight, number seven, and number six,
making them the most sinful couple since Saddam and Gamora.
And now they're shooting for commandment number five.
Isn't that right, Tammy?
That's right, KC.
It's time to make your mic, huh?
Oh, well, there goes number five with a bullet.
A 38 caliber.
Yes, I've been shot through the heart and you're the blame.
I gave PTA, Alabama.
For sure, for sure.
KC's come and's been held down.
I think this is, this calls for you, Captain Dave.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
It's a great show, but a little too boring.
A little too boring.
It's just trying hard.
What?
Your turn?
I'm not trying too hard.
Yes, yes you are.
No, I'm not doing anything, ma'am.
What's your good?
You're good.
I like you, Glenn.
Now, do you think I'm struggling?
Yeah.
Can you tell it in my voice?
No, Glenn, you're good.
You really should be a bit manning the show.
Thank you, ma'am.
Go.
There she goes.
That's it.
Yeah, you know who that was, right?
You're struggling.
You're struggling.
I can tell it in your voice.
What is he saying?
I'm trying too hard.
Dave, I'm not doing anything.
I'm sitting here.
One thing we've never tried.
We don't try to.
I'm like going with the flow.
No, this business.
Whatever happens, you know?
I wonder if the times I've been in radio have I ever really tried too hard.
She said the show was boring, and we were trying too hard.
Well, last hour, we liked you.
But she likes us a lot.
Last hour we had Ed.
Wow, okay.
This has really been something, hasn't it?
Hollywood next.

Tell that lady everything.
Fine, just fine.
Two lads.
Oh, no.
Now this time I had my little spontaneous bit I was going to play for you.
And Camden Dave punched it and it went away.
I'll have to play.
We got to wait for it to recue now.
It's going to take forever.
And it's...
Everything's fine.
And it's real long.
And it's...
You say, cat and Dave.
Oh, here we...
Wait.
All right.
You're playing this one.
No, no, no.
Play this one.
All right.

He loves, he loves, the birdies.
The birdies back.
He just flew out of his closet.
He loves, he loves, the birdies.
And on your car,
he will leave you his deposit.
He loves, he loves, the birdies back.
Yeah.
You might say that he's in my brain.
But he never stole the fricking.
Every time he reads news,
he gets himself a trouble.
But Neil is always right there.
First thing has a bubble.
Oh.
Listen and see,
the bird is back.
I heard that it's official.
He loves, he loves, the birdies.
But next week they're gonna send it to a senter real ritual.
He loves, he loves, the birdies back.

John Davidson Raw.
Elvis Presley fans are remembering their idol today,
11 years after the man called the King of Rock and Roll died.
Of course you remember, a tragic way he died
pulling those children out of that burning school bus.
A radio station saying it wanted to dispel rumors
that Elvis Presley is still alive.
Offered a million dollars yesterday to anyone
who can bring the King to Nashville for an interview.
You know, I thought I saw Elvis the other day,
and I called the police and they checked it out
and it was just a weather balloon.
I saw Elvis and Burger King knew that any went in
and was very hostile on his way on.
I asked him why I said they didn't have any formaldehyde.
Join the King.
I've talked radio that is.
Neil Rogers every weekday morning on Zeta 4.
What do you want?
Why are all these people I don't understand
and what are they doing with their way on the line?
And you say hello to them and they come up with the most bizarre
and stupidest things.
What is their problem?
Well they're not as bright as you are, sir.
Hello, the Neil Rogers show for a new generation.
Every weekday morning on Zeta 4.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
Okay, here it is.
Say we've got another winner.
Ha!
Here it is, the young rascal.

Peter Bulger was a normal man with a new bride, a lovely home, and a cushy, low-profile job.
Normal that is until just three weeks ago.
Peter, is that you?
Of course.
How is the traffic?
Fine.
Peter Bulger is suffering from glen-hield disease.
Our conscience has been revoked, Peter.
Are you okay, Peter?
Fine.
Everything's fine.
Just great.
Glen-hield disease is a nervous disorder, similar to Neil Rogers' disease, but even more debilitating.
Pity-weedy.
It's Friday night.
You know what that means.
Call me Mr. Curious.
Oh, God, are you a man or a bird?
Don't let this pathetic creature become a bird brain.
Send your contribution today and help us find a cure.
Oh, don't do that.
Why not?
We need the eggs.
WFU and the fine spot.
We're like to ask you.
You remember.
What?
Well, we'll let the people...
Come on, let's...
You know, if you don't like it, we can bail out, but I think it's okay.
And here it is.
Ladies and gentlemen, the unemployed mamas and poppers of the United Auto Workers.
Hyundai Hyundai.
And you goes to...
These low-priced imports.
Look real good.
They're just...
Rocking horse people.
Marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers.
They grow so incredibly high.
Have you ever had a marshmallow pie?
Sure, last night.
Before I go to sleep.
And you go!
Why, the beetles are spinning under a whole's voice.
You know, I like what you said about that.
It is the definitive version of Lucy and the Sky.
You didn't ever really think of Lucy and the Sky.
I can't hold this version.
21 before, uh, well...
This Saturday night, it's Michael Jackson around the world.
This is Michael.
Johnny Farr.
Go take a hike.
Before I buy.
A foreign car.
I think I'll ride a bike.
I bought a night gun.
And a sonic.
And a Sony too.
Put my name's cars.
Just gotta be.
Red, white and blue.
What a day, how day.
Don't trust that car.
You won't be anywhere.
You won't go far.
What a cool incident.
And what do I always say?
There are no cool instances.
Well, a Hollywood woman arrested on charges of growing marriage on a plant in her backyard
was acquitted after explaining to a judge that she used the pot as a treatment for severe glaucoma.
See, this was an excuse we used to use in millions of times.
I can't see, officer.
El the Musica testified that smoking marijuana saved her from blindness by reducing the pressure glaucoma puts on her eyes.
She says the thought of going blind was more frightening than going to jail.
Doctors also testified that Musica had more than a dozen eye operations
and marijuana has proven to be a successful treatment.
Broward Circuit Court Judge Mark Polin agreed with the arguments in the non jury trial.
Lawyer said it is one of only three successful cases in which medical need has been used as a defense for smoking marijuana.
So congratulations to Elvy, who's feeling a lot better, I'm sure.
Well, some of the birthdays we mentioned, Fest Parker 63.
I'm a paper isn't out yet.
Well, you know, you're breaking the rules.
You know, Neil would have my butt if I allowed you to go on a second time.
I'm sorry.
That's okay. Just don't do it again.
Is this me you're going to hang up? I was having fun listening to you guys on the phone.
Did you call, collect?
No.
Oh, well, I'll put you on hold if you want.
Well, that's how.
Oh, okay.
I have replacement normal where we just reach and instantly we have it.
You know, we have to do this major, major search.
I don't even think those are alphabetical.
They're not alphabetical. It's very, very difficult.
No problem.
But we'll see. I'll say it would be great to hear.
We haven't heard this.
No, Heather's.
This is Heather's boyfriend.
Wow.
Well, Johnny is not as used as searching for these things as we are.
But for me to, you know, get it.
We got it.
We got it.
All right. We'll play it right now.
Okay?
No, don't do it. You say that I'm not good at this.
Well, you're getting better.
Now, soon as I come to finish this season, Heather will be here.
He's the first kid on the block.
And he wakes up right in the eye.
And he knows he's a little nutty.
And he knows he's a little squirly.
Well, he thinks that you and the whole inner record just to say hello.
Hi, I could see what you're all doing out there.
And I'm only not as eight or four as a meal.
But just show, come on, a meal.
Isn't that wonderful?
All right.
Hollywood.
How'd you do it?
Good. How are you doing?
I'm doing just fine.
Yes, you're on the air.
I was accepting your congratulations.
About what?
About being able.
I am the first woman in the United States of America who legally can smoke marijuana.
Oh, is this Elvy?
Yes, Dave Caprita.
All right.
You remember me from jazz concerts?
Oh, from jazz concerts.
Yeah, I understand. I'm a vocalist too.
Oh, great.
Yeah.
Yeah, you were the one that was always giving me marijuana for my eyes.
Now, is this the only show where we do a news story and then the person we were talking about calls up?
Yeah, you are the first ones I have called.
That's incredible.
But I did appreciate your congratulations and your coverage.
And I'm so excited.
I think I took off for the moon.
Yeah, but just, you know, with those plants and everything, just be careful that no weirdo's tried to rip you off for some.
Yeah, they did between the dogs, the cats, the neighbors.
I didn't get a chance.
I had to go to get it legally.
Wow.
Wow.
Well, good for you.
I think that's great that the judge saw your side, your viewpoint.
Well, he sure did.
They were wonderful.
The judge, even the prosecution, they had a job to do.
And I thought that they, you know, they were understanding.
They were understanding.
How to do it?
We have to do it with a job.
I could never take it personally.
Yeah. Well, that's great.
Great.
That's what a coincidence that you were listening to.
I listened to you guys quite often.
Yeah.
Super. That's great.
Well, we'll tell Neil when he gets back.
Yeah.
Yeah. That's great.
Okay, guys.
Bye-bye.
Thanks for calling in.
Isn't that unbelievable?
It's got to be the only show anywhere that does that.
Is this the coolest morning show in the city or what?
I bet you the guy who has that Elvis record that's worth half a million dollars.
Maybe he's...
Oh, when I think he looks nice.
When I beat my head this way.
And put in lots of hairspray.
And then a half a can of moose.
Mmm, got my inspiration twice.
Squeeze it to some needed type tunes.
To feel those screaming minus scenes.
Oh, but they seem me move.
Oh, but I need some talent.
Cause I ain't got none.
Don't forget that I was half a wham.
Oh, but I got two first things that got me started.
And I need a shower, baby.
And I need a bed, put up, raise it in my hand.
Cause I got to get shaved.
I got to get shaved.
I got to get shaved, shaved, shaved, shaved.
I got to get shaved, shaved, shaved.
This Saturday night, it's Michael Jackson around the world.
We bad.
This is Michael.
Join me for highlights in my world tour.
Then meet my special fans from exciting places like Japan.
And then face procreate.
Rockless like sister Toyota.
Mmm, sweetie.
Give me the dingy dingy.
He's a beauty, beauty girl.
Italy.
Oh, my dawn, bravo Megare.
Grab the catch your knee, huh?
That's nice.
This one you're...
Men young men should only rush his hair and need something.
And couldn't hide.
And even Scotland felt it was helping dance.
But he looks like a wee fairy to me.
Share the magic as people around the globe discover what everyone in America already know.
Make it that fruit of the stage.
Michael Jackson around the world.
Saturday night.
You never...
You never...
Is this Captain Dark?

It's the bird.
Oh, what's up?

Listen, I've been recording most of the time this week since you guys have played bit intensive.
Well, yeah.
We're not as bit intensive as we were a couple months ago, right?
Well, but I'm not complaining, you know.
I understand.
But I know you're playing a guest here.
I think later on this week you can play soccer, soccer, again.
Oh, yeah, and that's great.
Did you call them mobile?
Did we play it yesterday?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it is...
I think it's one of the all-time great ones, don't you?
Oh, yeah.
I...
You know, okay.
So we'll definitely...
Maybe tomorrow.
For sure.
All right.
Bye-bye.
I feel like I'm...
I'm vibrating.
Everyone's favorite.
Everyone loves it.
If you've gone ape for love over the guerrilla of your dreams, you'll want the strongest

King Kongdom.
King Kongdoms made from the world's tallest rubber tree plants.
And available in a rainbow of tropical colors.
Battle tested in the German-vested jungles of Africa, South Asia and Nicaragua.
And now available in your own personal combat zone.
Ooh!
From the sewers of 42nd Street to the dippy top of the Empire State Building.
You'll never be hanging out without...
King Kongdoms.
From just outside Washington, D.C.
The only city in America will love and congressman of a sale 24 hours a day.

Well, late night presidential retreat with a space between its teeth.
Featuring Georgie Schultz with a late night all contraband.
Larry Bork-Millman and his train beard.
We'll take a ride down the Lane Duck roller coaster with a bomb zone for real town.
Then we'll drop by President Bush and the watermelon from the top of the Capitol Building
to see which one leaves a bigger stain.
Plus top 10 beetles, pressure group male and stupid President Frick.
My, oh my, oh my.
I'm having more fun than the law alone.
Just like Ali Nour.
It's the popular political retreat when your political popularity is retreating.
It's Camp David Letterman.
Yes, a blast in the past.
That's right.
Okay, that's the L is Camp David Letterman today.
Plot enough for you, Joe.
Oh, we got one.
That answers my question.
Now do we have auto Dave?
Once again, you're right, Neil.
Yeah, while he's out, we have auto Dave.
A little confused.
The news on vacation.
Oh my god.
I just wanted to request here.
I want to hear this one.
Somebody called up and wanted to hear it earlier.
Oh great.
Oh, actually.
Can't have tonight on the Neil Rogers, you know.
Neil waits for you in the morning.
He always be open to smile.
Something not a crusade.
It's awesome now that you're right.
You're saying you won't die.
You're saying you won't die.
That was perfect.
I never heard my laugh in just one channel before.

I just inked a 10-year contract with those goofballs at Hallmark cards.
I'm set for life.
Hey, here comes Linus.
I wonder if he still got the Dolly Madison account.
Hi, guys! Guess what I found out?
What?
We're not gonna make any of these stupid endorsements.
But why Linus?
Because we're just cartoon characters you jerk,
besides, my agent says Mr. Schultz gets everything.
Oh, no!
You saw the sound, Charlie Schultz!
Yes, the whole B-nudge gang is back, and they're bitter.
We do all the work, and that old geek gets all the money.
I know, let's just stop being funny.
I think we stopped doing that a long time ago.
Yes, it's the real story of the man who stopped working for B-nudge.
You sold out, Charlie Schultz!
This fall on CBS!
Ha-ha-ha!
We don't need no monkey nonsense!
We already tried to tell we will show.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

All those were from the early days when we were from then.
First thing started over here.
I produced it on this side, but it was before you guys came over here.
No, it couldn't have been.
It was.
Because I had you go into the eight track room and did the prices thing.
Because it made the original head disappear.
It's so far from the M.I.Sora.
Station stuff.
I've got lips.
Ah, that was a mom.
Oh, let's hear that one again.

Speaking of that, we better take this call out here.
Hello.
Yes, struggling.

How about you, honey?

Number one is picking up your number one.
Whoa.
Whoa.

So you want to play it back?
No, no.
I was going to say if you can make a copy of it,
here we're asking for a copy for you.
Yeah, that's the kind of thing.
Can I send it in?
Yeah, we'd love it.
Yeah.
We're bringing it by, you know?
We'd love it because it's something
we could play during the show also.
I got some tapes of when Neil was on stand show.
And DJ was there and EJ.
Oh, god.
I got some stuff that I'll put a few extra things on there.
OK, great.
We'll love it.
And hey, you guys are doing a great show.
Thanks, Amelia.
Thanks.
Oh, wouldn't that be great to have that?
Do you know, just like to play on our show?
You're struggling.
And by the way, if you missed it,

Oh, Neil went to Hawaii.
Don't say anything.
We have to dump.
We never had to dump a three-year-old.
The Neil's gone.
You know, we have your butt head song.
Can you believe it?
It's not been paid.
I'm going to have it running.
It's going to tape right now.
You guys have a good day and you're doing a great job.
Thanks.
Hi.
You guys have a good day.
Let's say 744 will give her...
Why don't we play a jingle?
Give her time to get her tape set up.
And then we'll play it.
How about he talks about...
Now let's see.
I'm even requesting it.
Here it is.

You ask and you got it.
And you can go right into that.
The things you want to know.
He talks about all the things you want to know.
He approaches on the radio.

Porsche cars just about running me clean off the road.
Well, I decided it wasn't going to do me no good to get mad at him,
so I just kind of sit down and wrote this song about him instead.
And it goes like this.
Where you born a butt head, or did you work at it your whole life?
Either way, worked out fine, because you're a butt head tonight.
You're a BUTT HAD, and don't you try to blame it on me.
You deserve all the credit, because you're a butt head tonight.
You were a butt head yesterday, and you're a butt head tonight.
I've got a feeling you'll be a butt head, the rest of your life.
Let's sing it.
Here we go.
Where you born a butt head, or did you work at it your whole life?
Either way, worked out fine, because you're a butt head tonight.
I was talking to your mother just the other night, and I told her that I thought that you were a butt head.
She said, yes, I think you're right.
And all your friends, your butt heads, because you've known them your whole life.
And somebody told me, you got a butt head for a wife.
Here we go.
Where you born a butt head, or did you work at it your whole life?
Either way, worked out fine, because you're a butt head tonight.
Everybody join in, where you born a butt head, or did you work at it your whole life?
Either way, worked out fine, because you're a butt head tonight.
Let's do that last line.
Either way, it worked out fine, because you're a butt head tonight.
Wow, better while since I heard that, but hit song for you this morning on the Neil Rogers Show and Zeta Ford.
Hey, honey.
Honey, you okay?
This poor man is suffering from painful vowel movements.
He needs the letter turning relief of Neil Vanoite, the soothing new liquid with a second banana flavor.
So don't be sentenced to the consonant pain of crammed vowels.
Reach for the bottle in the gold lamegown.
Vanoite, it'll keep you letter perfect.
Neil from SayJack, laboratories.
We miss that before, didn't we?
Do we?
Mmm, it good.
The news, beaches are closed again today.
More medical waste and other pollutants continue to wash ashore.
Medical officials have no idea when.
Surrounding these loves are tested, they're all messy.
They're back, and now they stink more than ever.
It's the closed beach boys.
Yummy! You could out of that water this instant.
Shut them down, shut them down, got to shut the beaches down.
Yes, all their hits are here.
Plus you'll get hook John B, smell me Ronda, little douce cooleys,
and who could forget?
Goo Goo Goo Goo, vibration, scream,
Cache, goo Goo Goo Goo, vibration, the closed beach boys.
Now it chores everywhere.
Okay, a rare call from Marga, what's wrong?
Hey, what's up?
What's wrong? Wait, you said like six cookies in a...
Hold on just a second, sir.
Now what's the problem?
I just had six cookies in a span of 90 seconds.
Captain Dave ate six cookies in 90 seconds.
Can you believe that?
Is that a rare...
And they're big cookies, too.
These are like big chocolate chunk cookies.
They had to bring them in like in pizza boxes.
How you doing this morning?
Good. All right, here's something for you.
I was reading Omni Magazine.
Uh-huh.
All right, now listen to this.
Okay, stand up women.
Oh, I read that.
Is this weird?
I read that.
I don't even know if we can talk about that.
Oh, oh, yeah, you can't.
Well, okay, you try it. I'll keep my hand on the dump button.
All right, and we'll see if you go too far.
Women are finally taking a stand in addressing the problem of hygiene and puff.
Oh, I've heard of this.
Can we talk about this?
Reff funnel.
Yeah, it's in the magazine.
All right, it's a funnel. I know it is.
It's called leaf funnel.
Leaf funnel.
Leaf funnel.
Yeah, leaf funnel.
Allow the women to your name while standing up.
Yeah, I know.
Well, why?
Well, it's the 80s, you know?
That's for, um, uh...
High...
I think it's that old, like, equal rights.
Yeah, man.
They, you know, they've always been, you know,
envious of that, that we, you know, that they...
Well, let me just...
I can't get into this.
I wish we were off there, we could have a real interesting discussion.
Yeah, but you guys are talking about...
I was talking about being on cars yesterday.
What?
We're talking about, you know, urinating on cars yesterday.
Urinating on cars.
I was talking...
Johnny say he urinated out his car, so...
Oh, yeah, it was...
Oh, that's true.
Yeah.
We were talking about the beneficiary, um...
Um...
Health...
Oh, yeah.
Well, we were talking about people...
The benefits of...
The benefits of...
You're absolutely correct, sir.
About the group...
There's a group of people who, uh...
Yeah, I saw that on montage,
or people who, uh, drink the...
You're on yours.
Yeah, that's correct.
Yeah, you're right.
We're stretching it to go with that.
But I saw that on montage,
so I thought we could talk about that,
and it's no, like, secret or anything.
And was it montage?
Yes, I saw it on montage.
It was like 60 minutes, sir.
No, it was montage a few weeks ago.
I remember it vividly.
Yeah.
So you're right, it is kind of the same thing, isn't it?
Yeah, well, you know.
It's selling in the drugstore, now, I haven't seen it yet, but...
Wow.
$4.99 for a box of ten.
50 cents a pop.
A pop.
A shoot, 50 cents a shoot.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll lift the can.
I'm going up the corner.
Yeah.
Like in a couple of weeks, I'm going up north.
Believe it to beaver.
Starring Barbara Billingsley.
Hugh Beaumont.
Tony Dahl.
And Clint Eastwood as the beaver.
Oh, you wanted to see me, Dad.
Yes, beaver? Sit down.
I am, Dad.
Keep in mind I'm six foot four.
So, uh, what's the problem, Dad?
Beaver, I have never been more disappointed in you
than I was today when you walked in the principal's office
wearing that horrible sweatshirt.
Oh, you mean my Beastie boy's sweatshirt?
Right.
And I just can't understand it.
Just this morning your mother and I both told you
to take that sweatshirt off before you went to school.
Now, why did you deliberately disobey us?
Come on, Dad. It's the biggest concert of the year.
Run DMC in the Beasties.
And I already got my tickets.
Oh, no, beaver.
Oh, yeah, Dad.
All right, you can go.
