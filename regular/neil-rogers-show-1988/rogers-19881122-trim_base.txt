afternoon Neil yes sir yes first
time caller on a legitimate caller
on the vocal line this is a rare
experience on his show sir that's
right today I'm 31 I just want to
thank you for innovative radio in this
pathetic market mm-hmm one of the
first things I ever heard was over
on the other station was this
terrible it was I believe it was a
legal ID for W I and C and it sounds
like oh oh yeah that's about kicking
ass no no that was Dave Graveline did
that you would happen to have that
which is what I have it I'll tell you
one thing I give anything if I did
have it but the program director
over there's got it closeted away
it's spirited away in a deep dark
place I really I'd be very happy to
help him put a lot of other things at a
deep dark place to you know what I'm
saying starting with that foot
exactly but just keep up the good work
have a great thanks okay you too
thank you bye bye you know it's
interesting that thing that Graveline
did that we we just found it sitting
on a cabinet yeah I don't know if they
used to sit kicking ass you never
heard us play that I played the hell
out of it see one thing that I always
have learned is if you find something
that they might get nervous about
play the crap out of it and then
you know later on if they come in and
take it at least you've milked for
everything you can get yeah here it's
different speaking of playing the
crap out of it there he is just get
out of our lives and have a wonderful
life anyway what was I saying so
anyway we get this great thing that
we find on a cabinet no and it was
like kick it as fifty thousand
watts W I was hysterical because
here they're trying with this all
news and it was funny yeah and we
played the daylights out of it for
about two or three days and then the
rose called me in as usual you know
like come on let's go talk and that
seems that the AM program director
didn't have a sense of humor oh my
which I know comes out of the
great shock oh really is that
incredible we had to pull it you
would have liked it because it said
even in the homies he's the only
guy I've ever worked for who has
been embarrassed to tell me about
my ratings because they were so
good yeah I mean embarrassed
listen the day no way no way we
got a wet my right here no
seriously you weren't there yet this
was after the spring book came out
before you came and it was the day
and you know how he used to sit at
the computer we're talking about the
program director sit at the computer
and get all the numbers and give them
out and everything run all around
a building like a chicken with this
head cut off and I'm sitting
there and I'm saying okay where are
they because we knew we were going to
have a good book because we were
following the trends and I think
we had had about a seven something
I had had a seven in the winter
book and now the spring book was
coming out we had a seven nine or
an eight or something in the trend
so we know it's going to be a good
book that was the book we got a
nine year and we had a practically
pounded this guy in a head to get
him to turn loose with the numbers
yeah that's what a douchebag he is
oh I'm sure he was hostile oh I'm
sure he was with their with their
great numbers now their twos and
their ones and he's been out
really all news man all snooze
I'll have a take toward mediocrity
trust him okay let's go to a
lottery hello hey Neil how's it going
good how you doing oh pretty good
this is a real treat that stand on
there today I just want you to know
I wrote a letter and I called and I
you know told them well if they took
you off the market that was it I
wasn't going to listen to the B.I.N.
Finn I've never turned the back on my
dial I have you I haven't I haven't
you have a lot of company to your
trust me out they just doing the
same thing I mean well after you
left Neil they lost I think after
you know advertising anyway yeah they
lost quite a few mm-hmm but especially
since that new guy's on there I mean
you know music fine you can turn it
on listen to it all the time between
commercial from the FM but you know
you had something really good going
there and they blew that too they
would have if they would have been
smarts they that they would have had
you on and then had to think if I
could tell you how many times I had
that conversation with a big
guy that I think I got there I can't
stand to listen to him he's like a
sick Joey Reynolds you know well
here's the just think of this man
here is a manager who had an
opportunity to have the number one
rated radio station in this market
by simply putting me on following
Neil that's right that's all they had
to do they would have automatically
been number one in this market and
they chose not to do that you know
they want to be don't forget you're
forgetting they want to be number three
yeah they don't want to be number ten
I think they want to be twelve actually
or twenty three years later whatever
last one is they got a death wish
that for sure you got it and I
notice even put a muscle on days now
really yeah you know when I haven't
been listening to him that much anymore
since uh... month well suggested a
right but uh... he you know he's not
allowed hardly to say anything well good
like to him yeah well maybe I'll put two
three more people on the morning show
nobody to be able to say that they can
to all talk at the same time like we're
doing anyway you'll be able to understand
any of it so they can't get any trouble
i guess i have a good one uh... you know
good luck to you on uh... good luck on your
diet you can eat over Thanksgiving or not
no i'm sure not i'm going to do just what
i'm supposed to do that
that's great you're giving your given me
encouragement to do it too well you do it
it's gonna be great okay thanks a lot
i'll go on
i don't know if uh... a lot of people may have
forgotten
but last summer when you were on midday
you and i were on midday stand
followed us in the afternoon we were the
number one real radio station in south
florida yeah i had a six four behind only
life and qp a station at a six four incredible
demographics are kicking ass all over the
place and then and then you see the first
big mistake in this is where i disagree with you
all would help me tremendously because in
terms of income it helped a lot uh... getting
off the a m going on to f m and then coming
back here but um... they when they started
messing up the a m yeah without any
regard as to what would happen to it
and then they stuck jay and there and i like jay jays a good guy but jay is not
a talk show host and he's ever gonna be
it's a great and that thing that he was doing here in midday that you had a
follow by the way every day got i mean you couldn't define it
got a lot of what i want to let the cat out of the bag and just say one thing
about what they told me when they quote let me go
yeah you know you mongest check and let me go
they did pay me up until september first which was right to your contract
uh...
they said they said and you have to think about this argument
for a little bit and then it'll finally get to you
they said that the reason they had to take my program off which was number one
was because they couldn't find anybody to precede me to replace you
yeah sure so think about that
no is that was the excuse for dumping the number one show in the afternoon
is because they couldn't find anybody to do ten to two
well first of all a logical thing would have been and we talked about this
often for them to put you on midday
tend to two so that people who listen to me in morning on fm
would have then turned right over to you i mean a lot of people who saw that
who were an even radio people was just obvious right and then an afternoon
drive they could have fun somebody do to do after you drive where they could have
gone back to do a new accident what difference does it make right
but uh... don't confuse them with the facts man one thing i learned about them
over the four and a half years i worked there's anything that makes sense
they will never do it now and uh... that can be said again
one forty nine and w.i.o.d will come right back in a few more calls in with stand
right now we want to tell you about char-hot fantastic burgers
real chicken brash delicious Italian sausage
great onion rings the best in town and lots lots more with those special char-hot
toppings and you'll find six soon to be seven char-hot locations all over south
florida and for and i wish lory would get me the
better locations on this with the addresses i don't want to get push you with
your but yeah i noticed that these things seem to take a great deal of time
they're in four-later day like somewhere around in four-later day
sunrise tamarag day the hollywood mimey and soon to be somewhere in market like
in the center and i've gone and created their own money at char-hot that you can
spend in their restaurants for hats t-shirts only fm walkman radios from
