well isn't that what they will we know that now and speaking of steve isn't
as amazing as i've been to this is yesterday it says i'm reading the read
this call okay the way it says it
steves favorite conservative rick ciderman debate so is in glickman of the
do caucus campaign on the meaning of life and the word liberal what the hell
does that mean debating the meaning of life
uh... what kind of a debate is that
i mean one thing about steve man he could debate you on anything like that
but the basket of food there you know is it good for you
is it the ecologically safe
anyway it says how does president bush sound you how about president quail
steve divulges his reasons for joining the bush league
and uh...
becoming a bush man starting to do this afternoon exclusively on wio d
because most of the other states will be embarrassed
but uh... isn't that incredible i'm reading it right from his own promo if i
came on and said came was a bush leager you get upset
that that that right here in the promo though now you can say it
this is a good bush leager ok this is a monustie
and of course we all know the real reason other than hangar i would sign
them in the came out for bush is because i'm for do cocking and if niel says
it's daytime steves gonna tell you it's nighttime if i say that it's blue he's
gonna say it's green it's just it's just in his nature now the system in your
state can tanker is
back basically you're gonna go king you're gonna confront side of the face to face
this afternoon now i'm gonna get on here like we will every day at two o'clock
this i'm gonna confront some of his guess coming up or you like jackal
already i'm gonna confront the jeff striker when he comes back
was going through my old stuff here and look at this in its full of monger i
want to get the room messed up
but look at that it's one
it's a jeff striker thing
and it's like falling apart in pieces yeah but it's at toll free number nine

queenie magazines or whatever that's from so anyway that's coming up on the
can't show he gets them all doesn't i can't believe she's gonna be in here
like crackers just fell out of that all over the table
everything that's really strange okay now let me give the numbers on and we're
gonna take it easy today we're not gonna be under all that pressure like yesterday
and everybody i talked to said they really enjoyed the show but i just
felt like i was going about a mile a minute i don't know why but it was all
these we were taking a break like every two seconds
weren't we yeah well let's gonna say a break for longer than the show that was
the incredible part but then again we got all these political stuff like i said
and that's gonna go away we'll slowly get it together and do it one day
we'll intimidate them and tell them you know to cut this crap out
anyway let me give you the numbers now even though already all but the Palm
Beach line are lit and there's something about you idiots up in Palm Beach
okay when we were on on data and even when we were on winds remember in the
daytime we we had the vocal line for a while and they took it out that was
I was on data yeah well done wasn't that on am or did we never have a Palm Beach
line we never did only on data are at first I don't remember but anyway we got
to Palm Beach line and yesterday thank god the lines were going crazy all day
and the only exception a couple of times we had a tweak Palm Beach a little bit
and believe me there are a lot of people up there who haven't been tweaked in a
long time i think that's their problem especially in Lake Worth okay but i'm
gonna give you all the numbers because we don't want all the chronic AM
Yentazone we'd like to get a bunch of new people on here and we're sure that
the tinkling will continue at least to the end of this week okay in date

the Palm Beach is which is still conspicuously quiet 655 W I O D man no
wonders Santa used to be so comatose by the time you get through giving all
those numbers man you're ready to pass out I I like they always used to call
us collecting they always complained yeah now we got a Palm Beach line and it's
still not ringing when we have one we got to take a break and then we'll get
to go on we're really going to get to it today trust me sooner or later it's
10 10 on 6 10 W I O D and 14 at W I O D got a little little problem here already

the mobiles I always put them on first and then we've got that color in Miami

starting trouble for you again do you doctor vets right doctor or a very well
waking welcome to a m by the way as a closing the silently Michigan state has
gone for and on the left for a week yeah very quietly yeah they're
quietly they're creeping up on Michigan it's a shame they lost a Michigan otherwise
they'd have a shot at the Rose Bowl like they don't start don't start with
sports okay because then the whole sports department will start getting
hysterical and don't do it please so it's already time up to what's that what
did he say I said isn't your middle name gonna become weaver right yeah sure as
in the weather that listen to this call is terminal but have a wonderful day
hey listen no doubt about it talk to you later okay he was really worth taking
first one okay now here's this lady who's been hanging on for a long time
hello about twenty five minutes that you're worth it Neil that's not too long I
want to in fact I think you ought to go back on hold for a little while
Neil just a joke or the level of your right today and I just said they were
low they're like no one I talk to you oh I'm sorry there's an election today
right and I'm calling you so that the voters can hear this before the day is
over yes there is an election on the ballot that note none of the voters now
there's an issue I mean there's an issue on the ballot yes there's an
election issue on the ballot if you want to correct my English that's gonna take
another 20 minutes but if you want to hear what I have to say I'd appreciate
your courtesy and listening okay there are a large number of people's
there are a large number of people's concerned citizens voters who like to know
what they're voting for this is merit retention of district court of appeals
judges they have no opponents running against them their names merely appear on
the ballot and there's been no information as to what they have been doing on
the bench for the last eight or ten years and which they've been making hundreds
of rulings people are not them voters are not them and they want to know what
they're voting on merit retention is in fact reappointment for life it is an
every six year election in which the voters are supposed to go down and
reelect the judges without knowing why they are voting on them thank you very
much for your courtesy in listening to this
well okay thank you so much for that was so terminal and she wanted to be on
first she must be called from w n w s
must be sabotage that time I don't mind or what now listen I mean we got a lot
of these civic minded people you got to understand okay this is not I gave up
all these heavy topics about two years ago and there's no point in trying to
bash people over the head with information okay and all this garbage about how
we learn so much from your shout forget it you didn't learn anything okay
except that what this is a douche bag down and it's boring basically and this is
one of the few places you'll get any excitement or entertainment okay that's
what you learned by the way see you're reading bill crossroads call and we thank
him again to it's good and isn't it nice to know that he could be awake now
while we're on the air out this thrills me that he can actually listen to it you
know what gets me the Palm Beach crowd they like hang out they don't use that
line then all of a sudden every call it comes in on it is a mobile which gets
them on first so all these other shleppers who have been waiting and waiting
and waiting they got to wait because these people in Palm Beach call on mobile
right yes sir shame on you sir it's the boat doctor listen oh yeah what's your

brought a whole group of sick people over here and that's what it's all about you know I feel
like more relaxed wasn't that it's not after you've been in the business long enough you don't
get nervous when you go into a new situation but you become like highly wired I think is the
term I'm looking for you know I'm saying like you're on doggy uppers or something like that and
that's how I felt yesterday and it was like we were just rambling along at least I was about 78
RPM good today things are a little more laid back you heard okay let's give that Palm Beach
number again because I can see that's going to be our only problem is going to be that Palm Beach
line see I can always find a problem on the phone even though they're lit up like a Hanukkah
bush I can always find some little bit of consternation on the phone 6 by 5 W I O D in the Palm
beaches for all you cheap skates you don't want to talk to us when we didn't have a Palm Beach
line okay it's free okay if you got it it's free I think you finally hit on it I think that'll
work I don't think so I don't see anything going on that always will allegedly have this gigantic
I probably leave founders getting on here telling him not to call us okay it's 20 past 10 on 610 W I O D

wait what wait a minute what does him why we want to drop numbers why they want to drop numbers

incredible Helen Dale strikes again I want Pembroke Pines desperately on this show today okay
bokeh hello no yeah glad to hear you back on am okay well here's another guy under the age of
a hundred you know it's like that radio spoke his feeling is back yeah yeah I have those
focus in my stomach right at the moment you know really your voice the difference between you
today and you last week it's like someone lifted I don't know it well yeah because I was like
semi suicidal last week in fact Roger even left the razor blade in here for me today so he
realizes that I'm calm down but oh boy if you were working with those people over there you never
have made it trust me a lesser man would never have stuck it out as far as I did if you know what I
mean I know what you mean it's like they lifted a 300 pound razor right off your chest there you go
tell me if Steve is talking about the meaning of life today is he going to talk about the life
of Brian tomorrow could be could be yeah this could do me a favor he's going to have Rick
Ciderman the reviewing the life of Brian Mars matter fact we know he's a fascist you're all saying
it I'm not saying it does happen to be true but I'm not saying okay go ahead
could you play the pokes most I sure will oh you're nearly we don't as you know we don't take
requests but because you're such a good guy I appreciate it and you sound like you've got
an IQ of over two we're gonna do it at least three or four okay have a great one you two bye bye
okay 1035 everything just going along so well isn't it you just waiting for that one big
desperate explosion okay April Wortham's got a news update and we'll come back in a flash on
610 WIO did you know what I just discovered what I've been cranking up the headphone level which is what
no instead of the telephone level for the colors on the overhead and that's why he's saying the
phone levels are so low they are a little bit low but I've been cranking up the wrong pot
and that's why this is worked so well just like sitting on there it's been bouncing off the table
anyway it's 1039 21 to 11 on 610 WIO D and our next cool is from Miami hello yeah Neil
does the bird ever talk why does the bird ever say anything no he just cackles sir he gets paid by
the cackle okay let's go to um what would he like I don't know lottery hello hello sir yes sir
I'm glad to hear you back on the AM thank you sir and I'm glad that they are going to let
you break loose and do your job and do it well yeah they're just oblivious here they just
anything we want to do they just go ahead and do it and uh mine your own business so I've been
reading the articles and they said that basically you can do what you want as long as it's
when within the FCC rule that is correct well can you tell me what did the other station tell you
you couldn't do uh anything other than hello and goodbye that those were the limits anything
outside of that and maybe an occasional how you're doing but other than that sir there wasn't a
hell of a lot left for us to do well what was the reason of pulling my boyfriend's back in that
incredible now listen I want you to understand a Portland main mentality with the one of the uh
corporate executive douchebags from Portland came down one day and heard it on the air and he felt
that it was promoting homosexuality okay well what's for a lottery what well I mean let's hang
on sir don't go that to mere cocks okay because you get very upset yeah that's true but I was
amazed you know listening to it yesterday that they would pull that it is even the local even the
local management and even the local management uh was embarrassed by that but again you see when
these Yahoo's from Portland main every time they'd come down they hear something or a group of
things that they didn't like and go ahead and pull a card out you can't do that you know and it
just got to the point where it was ridiculous because they've got no sense of humor they're
terminally not just homophobic they're like sexophobic like they're all uniques up there or
something yeah yeah just uh they believe that sex is not a part of anybody's life and that even
satire about it is just uh verboten you know and I used to start cranking up the microwave and
getting all hysterical and uh but just couldn't be done so what about JetBoy Jet Girl I've heard
worse things than other songs yeah there's nothing wrong with it says something about having a good
head on your shoulders or something like that and it's harmless exactly and the other weird thing
was that the records they played the rest of the day said much worse things oh yeah they still
play they still play records that it got some of the seven band words yeah one the other night I
heard that Steve Miller band record that's at the SH and you know right and they claim that they
don't play it but they do when he heard it with your own three years you know so they just have a
real conflict over there in the that whole company is just run by a bunch of Neanderthals from
Portland and uh you know the amazing part of it is when we were on AM a year ago
that we would have meetings and they'd say hey that fine we're behind you there's no problem with
this and no problem with this no that's not they didn't figure nobody was listening we had a nine
share but the point is then these people from Maine started coming down some of the corporate
teeth bags and and everything they hurt nervous breaks out okay so um that's the bottom line yeah
and I can't believe that data still letting day waste on my lifetime deal with that
yeah well I'm not going to say anything about that because I like to even do a great job for us
but but the fact is when you leave a bunch of your stuff behind for them to start playing it is
tacky I mean we played some of the old breakfast club stuff but it was done as satire was done as a
joke we weren't using it for serious in fact if you heard any of it it wasn't joke okay but um
I don't know I just delighted we're both tickled with that to be out of there and it was a real
the last few months there were the most depressing thing and I remember that to me the day that broke
my back was it hey I came back from that great vacation in Hawaii my great vacation and here was
a stan had been blown away and here was the program director waiting for me at the airport
and he had all of these memos and you can't say that you can't talk about stan and you can't talk
about the a m and blah blah blah blah blah and that was like the beginning the end for me I just got
worse from there both stands a great guy and he's a good talent but great show I mean I still
listen and he had great numbers and great demographics but again they don't relate to success when
you do well they get very nervous yeah are you gonna like let me oh you're gonna let Ed call in
or is Neil gonna like stop them it will call in very briefly okay sir oh come on very briefly
that is that's an excellent have a wonderful day sir okay let's go to this hate call for the
bird on five I can't wait for this hello yeah yeah you know what I'm gonna ask you Neil yeah I'm
gonna ask you right is on there with you I mean Jeff Charles should be on there with you Jeff Charles
Jeff Charles was on his station filling in for one day and they dragged him out of here kicking
and screaming okay first Charles is out of his mind sir Jeff Charles said here and promoted drug
use for four hours one day okay you wanted that's his opinion yeah that's his opinion to come on
here and promote use of drugs that's his opinion if you want to hear Jeff Charles move to Rowan
Ocoke because I think that's where he's gonna show I don't appreciate being put in the
care of the Jeff Charles Ray Charles maybe but not Jeff Charles I don't appreciate it this is
gonna work out because it's 10.44 and I promised that kid yesterday and I'm gonna win him is 20 bucks
okay 10.55 sometimes when we go away do you get the feeling like we're never coming back do you
ever get that feeling wow anyway the nice talking to you we'll be back right after the news
a just a little joke okay let's go to Miami next hello hello Neil yes sir yeah I disagree with
that earlier oh I think Glenn is great thank you sir yeah let's have a let's have a big vote on
that since it's election day I always wondered where you found them well that's under a rock in
Nashville that's a weird story I've never been to Nashville any the reason I called Neil
I'm a morning drive person yeah and I know you'd like to watch the numbers you're rating numbers
if you can get some statistics on accident I predict there's gonna be a increase in accident on the
road people not getting their morning laugh with you they're gonna be taken out their anxieties
and wrecking into each other well that's good that'll make the insurance rates go up and to make
the insurance companies happy and probably get a lot of business that's great so who are we what
are we supposed to do in the morning now that's a good question I mean there is nothing sir have
you ever heard about the mystery picker no there you know I never listened to Mike or Steve and
I've tried this week since you've been over here now these are so they're required taste you have
to give him a chance just turning in half hazardly will not do the job I'm trying but I you know
why don't I know not what about you in the morning no chance sir never again I'm not getting
up 4 30 in the morning for anybody okay well I understand okay see the problem is here we are
everybody should be excited ecstatic we're back where we enjoy being a midday on a real radio
station and instead of that we get like the guy who doesn't like the bird and now we got you
want to start the morning drive you can't be all things to all people you know what I'm saying well
I just do our we fumble along and do our humble best I you're doing great okay thanks a lot and

mother I don't know if you remember Joey he used to call you on the other station how could we
forget little Joey yeah the guy that hits the track every Sunday exactly anybody with a name
like that can't be all bad well he wanted me to say hello to you and that he misses you of course
because now he's in school yeah while you're on thank God and I recorded your show yesterday and he
heard the whole thing and he loved it so just wanted to let you know that I have switched to
a m just to hear you okay that's four now we got four converts from that fan we're working on
it slowly but surely and you know once in a while when I get a chance I'll record you so you can
hear too good excellent okay what you ought to do it is Joey have like a cassette we must have a
cassette recorder right yes he does that's what you're recording on but why don't you have him
record like a little message you know what we thought about that like maybe he gave us a hot
trip at tippet called or something like that Joey's 11 years old by the way no in fact he's 13
and a half 13 and a half she just six months ago he was alive yeah that was one thing that he
wanted to straighten out but he never got a chance to but he said oh it's okay okay yeah but he's
he's almost 14 he's getting he's getting older by the second now he's 14 like 16 no he'll be 14
in March now is he voting today no of course not only is it 18 he's going out to call her to
plunge his brains out today but he's very politically a stoop exactly yeah like most of the people in
this town of stoop well listen give my regards to Broadway you have a wonderful life and say hi
to Joey okay okay thank you thank you bye bye it's funny everybody adjusted to us being on in the
morning and now they all they want us back in the morning we don't want to be on in the morning
okay we're sick and tired of that crap yeah we don't want to get up at 4 30 in the morning coming
and pretend to be happy and awake and alert in all that garbage the hell with that stuff we did
pretty good at pretending yeah we put on a good act as all a big lie okay we hated every thinking
minute of it anyway don't forget Henry Barrow has got a special election wrap up hour tonight
from 10 to 11 on WIOD so if you want to get depressed tune in here that now he is going to be very
depressing because we know that Bush is going to win and anybody with an IQ over two is going to be
upset about that yeah and as far as McKay and Mack are concerned is anybody going to be happy
regardless I mean you know forget it that's just a desperate situation anyway news up coming at
the top of the hour we'll come back with our number two at 1105 here on 610 WIOD thank you so
much 1106 and WIOD and here we are ladies and gentlemen with our picks of the day this could be
the beginning of a gigantic no seriously there could be some people on there would be retiring by
the end of the week the birds picked today in the seventh race and he always picks these chalk
you know he's like three to five and cramp like that whirling rainbow with Gera in a seventh race
which is picked in fact it's the best bet by Slater in a herald yeah and everybody picks it
on top anybody can pick five to two in a morning line okay my pick in the eighth race because I
like the name of the horse cold spot cold spot yeah you're interesting with Rodriguez that's yeah
I have a cold spot this morning eight to one in a morning line so there could be some serious
uh bucks made on that one if it comes in is anybody pick it and now look at this Slater I didn't
even see this Slater Streeva in the racing form all pick cold spot really can sense his pick on top
but it's eight to one in the morning line so I'm trying to pick a price and I wind up with
something everybody picks well you know mine they they're coming number one are they scratched
and of course the soon we're going to have our own mystery picker on a show that we don't
want to be on done by Ranieri okay we're going to have our own mystery picker and he's going to
work on both nostrils at the same time want to thank Joe attached the rotisserie for the really
nice plant that he sent over look at that nice great and I got a really strange envelope here
that's got these wireless connectors I have no idea what this is supposed to be it says given
the mission maybe he can save the show I don't know what that's supposed to be all about but uh
some jackass out there in the audience okay let's go back the only open line on the board is in
bokeh if you move quickly where we just hung up about 45 minutes ago at 278 wiod that's 278
wiod let's go to Miami hello well new yes sir I've been listening to you since your wmwm
that stage and you know it amazes me I always are able to land on your feet somewhere else you
yeah just like a cat just like a cat like you were on the cat too I remember yeah I was on the cat
and you remember that yeah sure I was be only 27 but I've been listening to you since I was eight
what yeah okay that's your arithmetic whatever you say pal but anyway this is the first time I'm
going to vote and do I dare ask who you're voting for I actually I call to see if you can give me
a suggestion because it's still up in the air for me I don't know I'm I'm taking along a dime I think
I'm gonna flip the coin really up to a last moment I'm sure I'm a Republican yeah register as a
let me ask you this question at any time during a campaign did you really hear Bush discuss anything
about any issue he talked about the pledge of allegiance he talked about he talked about will
he hoorten a lot in about the furloughs and he talked about the liberals and he used all kinds
of labels and words and and he never once really addressed the issue he never talked sensibly
about where he's gonna you know cut the budget he never talked about anything really of any
substance about the elderly about the homeless about any of the issues about the drug situation
been in charge of the drug thing for last day years and it's been a disaster but how could anybody
of good conscience vote for Bush really yeah well then I know he's gonna sweep the state of Florida
but how could they do it but the caucus into that much of this no I disagree with you do
cock it wait a minute do caucus ran a bad campaign but at least he was talking the issues okay see
that's his problem he and his advisors didn't understand how done the American public are and
you know that you really have to deal with all this extraneous crap they try to talk issues
and that was their mistake well I got to admit Bush played a dirty yeah and yeah the caucus and
the caucus tried to keep up with it and if you want to clear conscience here because you asked
me vote for new caucus because it's not gonna make any difference in Florida anyway but at least
then you won't be able to say three four years down the road that nobody can blame you okay yeah well
I just well okay I'll take your word for it now listen you're gonna do whatever you want but
you asked me for a suggestion that's the way I feel about Bush did talk about the whales yeah
you didn't make the whales a couple of guys meant that okay he ran a whale of a campaign they're not
they're not at the uh uh they're not at my priority but okay I'll try and uh they're really not
okay you're serious good luck to you thank you okay I hope you have a clean conscience all right
I don't want you to lose any sleep at night when you have Dan Kuehler heartbeat away from the
presidency a kid who's just an absolute total vacuous douchebag you know you want him to be the
vice-president sir so what you're gonna go out and vote for today we don't want to get heavy
and political doing okay but we do have a call from Jupiter which is right next to your rain is hello
hello Neil yes welcome back to the living well thank you so much yeah this is Helen I used to live
in Fort Lauderdale oh I remember you Helen used to write me those great letters right right
I hated my guts not me I think you love letters are you kidding I know yeah I remember you know
there's only one person you're missing in the WIOMD lineup and who could that be pretent
progress does it bring back memories boy it's enough to give me indigestion for about a month

thing and it was not an obscenity it was something else well you know what I got to do and I
better do it now because like if we run 30 seconds over they're not going to get upset and even if
they do that's their problem okay hopped my stout drop off during the news so we'll give that

you know what can I tell you so in real world I also um we're story Reynolds now
have no idea i have no idea in fact you remember when Joey when Dick Beyondy was in Buffalo many many years
ago and they had a contact because he walked out and he disappeared and they made into a big contest
and they somebody found him in a taxi cab about a week later and we ought to have the same kind of
contest for Joey whatever happened to him yeah I was up through in the uh him and Dan never
said that that's my room yeah and about the 20th of February 1933 yeah that's right but I really
so you're so uh play the vanisting play one vanisting all right oh vanisting me pick my nose yeah
we like that coming up somebody can you come for Mike yeah great hey I really enjoy it so you guys

is that really for Mike how nice yes for the mystery pickers uh uh uh vanisting me an obstacle
okay it's 10 fast noon let's go to um Miami next hello no yeah i guess i'm having an opinion
an opinion about what um because you know opinions are like noses everybody's got one okay no i
would just like to talk to you about you're talking to him right now i am yeah that's me oh i'm sorry
don't i tried to radio off because i get nervous when i listen to the radio okay don't be nervous okay
okay well um i would really like to apologize um to the american people about the
the or english amendment that the people the group of my Spanish people were
atollia against what do you mean you want to apologize for what well for the group of Spanish
people who don't want that amendment passed for their own selfish reasons yeah well let me just
say this to you the last thing in the world that i want to do again is bilingualism i know sandy
likes to do that two or three times a week but i did more shows on bilingualism in the early part of
the eighties in this town and you can shake a stick at and the bottom line is that people who want to
be a part of the country are going to go ahead and they're going to do it and people that want to
use a language as a weapon are good no matter how many laws you pass they're still going to be rude
and they're still going to be arrogant and they're still going to do it and it it doesn't make any
difference how many laws you pass i know no i realize that but i i blame it most of the other um
high-position people that are here they're Spanish like the media that they run the media
and the radio stations they you know they're terribly biased and in the info is or East people
we can turn out i consider them stupid in a sense because you know if we consider ourselves
patriotic like we do what we come on when we become American citizens we should really do
a spec for this nation and if it's a common track that is heard from nation because you know
nation that's separated by languages becomes weaker you know we shouldn't not allow that and the thing
is when i hear the radio stations in Spanish i'm only listening to it now because normally i
will listen to english and that's really what they don't want yeah they want to come on east to come
on east to come on east to etc to help with fidel yeah i appreciate it we accept your apology
wasn't really necessary but your sentiments are our decent and uh we thank you really all
yeah i wanted to say is i never deny that i'm a Cuban but i do realize that we are not perfect
and i also know the American people are not perfect either that's for sure i'm sure i step for
a step closer to being perfect and i best best a job that i would like to take okay
it's really not that much difference in cars okay thanks a lot bye bye when is this
i just thought it's okay it's a 12 13 at 6 10 w i o d
and we're going to get a lot of calls in this hour we've also got those very important things
that the nick turned over to us that Jeff Charles piece which i can't wait to hear and vanna
pick Mike's nose and all that good stuff okay let's go to Miami hello hello Neil how you doing okay
best of luck you're on a new station hello bird how you doing good okay great
gonna make it short just want to tell you the information i heard the conversation in the quail
family this morning yes sir the quails woke up head sex Mrs. quail turned to mr. quail and said
then you're no jack canada
it's all but it's cute thanks a lot pal it was cute okay now that i've heard it about 400 times
but it's still cute and if anybody should know okay let's go to a four-later day hello
hello four-later day will be gone are you cereal okay let's just say the how with four-later
day let's go to north minibee chill oh hello Neil yes sir yeah i'm a first time caller and i was
wondering if i could just share a few things about my experiences i was in bay route when they
bombed the post headquarter do you remember that a few years ago yeah i sure do nobody's talking
about that but i sure do remember it yeah i like to share something with the voters who were kind
of decided about the caucus or bush i was about five hundred yards from that when it happened i
remember digging people out of there seeing the things the bad thing i remember right afterwards
the french people sent a contingent one of their guys from back in france came out i don't
remember his name it might have been mid-around he came for about eight hours eight with the soldiers
talked to them prayed with them stayed with them helped with the cause uh
help with the injured then the english guy came he helped off to the soldiers he was there for
about six or seven hours stayed and then bush came he came off his plane he expected the first
squad of troops went into the hangar for about ten minutes came back out got right back on his
plane went home i i can't really understand who would want a president like that yeah well you know
i don't know why the do caucus people i know he mentioned it once in one speech they haven't
talked at all about that and about the fact that the ragan sent those guys over as like sitting
ducks over there as a you know allegedly a peacekeeping force where there hasn't been any peace for five
thousand years and you know again it's teflon thing it just slides right off a ragan it slides off
a bush and don't confuse the public with the issues man they don't want to hear about it right
okay thanks a lot yeah good bye boy that was depressing but it was true you know but uh you know
that's not our thing okay it's not our thing because unfortunately in this country in this vast
wasteland of intellectual uh neanderthaleness if there's such a word it's a hopeless situation okay
really is to try to appeal to the american people with facts or with the any kind of meaningful
dialogue you're wasting your time man they want a brawl they want everything to be a fistfight
like that heraldos show i guarantee you when that show airs and whatever date is when he gets
his nose broken giant ratings it's gonna have like an eighty share okay did you see money tea last
night no but the big bandages on that uh they should have a bandage like all around his head okay
like a mummy like the invisible man pro 19 to w io d let's not get too modeling here let's go to
line sixes of mobile pro huh yep yep yep how do you feel about being on the same station as Steve
came because uh you know you two have had words together i remember when you were on nine forty
a.m. Steve came would say that you were a liability to the station because of you know that
advertising liability and uh he made other remarks as i remember that you don't have a guts to talk
to him in person and of course you've had words about him that i've heard that's a business sir
that's a way it goes yeah yeah so that he was all untrue that was all i thought sir do you want
an answer to the question or not yeah what i said was not on true i don't say things for dramatic
purposes okay i say things because i believe them but the business is such that it necessitates you
i mean you're you know you're always going to wind up working with people that you had run ins with
in the past especially when you do a controversial talk it's the nature of the business okay yeah
right okay and Steve's gonna do his thing and i'm gonna do my thing and so far man we're not gonna
go and we're getting along great and you know if you're a pro you got to do those things okay that
doesn't mean i'm gonna uh you know go out on the town with him and Rick every night but that's
one of those things all right thanks a lot okay yeah i think there are a lot of people in the audience
they need to get that out of their system okay i mean right away you become a hypocrite and you
become you know your credibility is shot that's a lot of baloney okay you do what you've got to do
and when people come along and they give you an opportunity like to get out of jail practically
which is how we felt at the other station and they give you the kind of deals that they made with us
you just don't say no unless you're crazy yeah okay and didn't i go through that thing about uh
all of us in radio and tv being a little bit on the your hurry side then i mentioned that earlier
in the show but none of that means that we're not gonna continue to stop talk about our pal Steve
of course like uh every day i get in love for George Bush he knows better than that he knows
there isn't any way in the world that he ought to be voting for George Bush but because i'm for
New Caucus he of course and also the influence of his good buddy Rick uh he's for Bush he's out
of his mind to be for Bush and these people that say well i'm scared to death a quail but i'm still
gonna vote for but what logic is there in that when we've had as many presidents die or be
assassinated or be uh have to resign like Nixon whatever the hell happened and all of a sudden the
vice president takes over and you wipe up with a dummy like a Gerald Ford for example good example
could walk to gum or brushes teeth at the same time excellent example yeah well that's just what
we need right and the amazing part of his Dan quail makes sure it makes uh
jury Ford seem like a brain you know okay so what does that tell you but i'm not gonna let that
influence me uh you know come on Steve get the serious cut the BS all right but hang it around
with that guy tied to your hip for too long uh another mobile caller in palm b chill oh hey Neil
how you doing how you doing i tell you this market has absolutely no sense of humor i know
they don't know it's just a radio show exactly just just like j use to say it's just a radio show
they ran and they rave and they take your personal that guy called hey was a fan yesterday but
i mean his life was crying and he was close she was calling out to colorado or something yeah
oh that's great one last thing is that does that give new meaning to the phrase get a life
fix you're not kidding yeah which uh it gets me to one last point real quickly uh
talking about the morning shows and you know the big pipe of the three best you know on io d and

gun still poking with the symbol full of pride boys want sex in the morning sex in the morning
boiling the sweet sex while I'm yawning suddenly falling when I'm half asleep want someone unconscious
somebody not just waiting for a thrill is one sex with surprises sex with some rises someone on the

how can I get any white hots or a gridded area stuff to you or anything like that good question
good question I mean because you're you're on the other side of the right now over there
yeah I really don't know although you know I appreciate it but I think I really ought to lay off
that stuff don't you well I don't you know because I really feel no seriously I lost six pounds it's
now a week since our left Zeta yeah but no I'm not joking I've lost six pounds in a week and I
have a feeling that I'm going to lose it very easily this time because I don't have that stress
man that's stressful kill you make you just want to keep eating and gorging and like even all the food
that came in yesterday you saw how much I had I had two slices that was my lunch and I had one
slice and a canola today and that's all I eat till dinner time and I'm I feel great
well you sound better now yeah I feel like a human being almost hey I'll be out of
the car you had over there we able to take those back with you with a yours there well not the ACN
stuff that's all you know they pay for that so American comedy network is out but you know we're
just commenting during the last break that the stuff that we used to play on AM almost all of
which is over here now is the stuff that really people were excited about and the ACN was like
you know frosting on a cake but most of it wasn't all that exciting okay well I'm glad you're
on AM and AM go a new look thanks a lot okay take it easy boy boy and that's what it's like seven six
and it's something at least it's exciting got a lot of people that were dragging back to AM because
let's face it with the exception of GTR which is over here right next door and they give a
re-upset if I didn't say that but no they're doing great they have a gigantic number and they got
the great demographics and they're doing fantastic but I mean generally speaking AF and I know
the scientific critical I say wow when it was on FM he you know said AM was dead and it was it
was about like a you know it's a breath away from death and as anybody heard W's news lately if
you can pick it up on your radio I can't pick that station I keep trying I can't get them now
they've improved it a little bit you know like once in a while here and you know you hear a
couple of letters but for months there was like you know you couldn't even hear it and there
were still doing like a three or four it's incredible because those old parts man it can't change
their dialer like stuck on it frozen yeah this is been an animation okay we got a mobile in Miami
hello hey how you doing great you know I have to say congratulations to WIOZ for letting you play
all the songs so much you know when you were coming back over here I said yeah I hope I'll
play a few songs but I never thought you'd be able to play my favorite I 95 songs again yeah I got
news for you gonna hear that every day I am so happy I really mean that I mean you know like I
call you up once as they did and I said Neil the show doesn't that good and I was being serious I
said Neil the show doesn't sound the same and I guess you just couldn't tell the truth well no I
used to I used to animate that how many times did I go on and scream about the fact that we're
being humiliated and degraded and muzzled and bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap
you didn't do that all the time but you can only go so far if you want to keep getting a paycheck you know
I did this like three months before you came out of the closet so to speak on that particular
subject and I thought maybe it was just me and it wasn't because the show really started to
degenerate and now let me tell you something and I really owe an apology but again it's not my fault
because it's the restrictions they've placed on us six weeks eight weeks I was coasting isn't the
word but I was like vegetating I mean we go in there in the morning and we sit around and look at
each other like you know are we ready to blow our brains out what do we do today what can we say I
mean when they take away 90% of your material man how the hell do you do a radio show it's true
because I have to say this you know when you went over and made the shift the first thing I did
was go out and buy myself one of these radios that worked in the shower because I was so
addicted during the 10 to 2 slots I didn't want to miss anything and that lasted for a couple of
months and then all of a sudden it says you know what am I doing I'm waiting for my time yeah
to have you for four hours a day I just have to say again to WIOD is great and please do one more
thing for me Neil the very first thing I ever heard you play when you went to 10 o'clock was the
guy's rag and I'll be crazy like I can't I'd love it
I got it I got it okay don't panic that's great yeah thank you so much okay have a wonderful life
thanks so much okay wow boy he was just foaming at them up right all right let's take our
break a minute early because then we can come back and play this because it's not really that long

blonde that was in Debbie does Dallas what is her name now she's very attractive okay Debbie does
Dallas she was Debbie oh I don't know I mean I saw the picture years ago I don't I only know the
names of a couple of the ladies you know three or four the ladies know that everything though most
of the ladies are like anonymous not all of them oh no it's not that it's true but most of
marketing like an item then there's what's that oh bamboos her name was bamboos bamboos bamboos
bamboos that's Debbie I know I listened to you with the regular films all the time you're
right on the money oh that's so much useless crap yeah it's just great oh it's some of those
women are really old with land a whole sake of sake is gorgeous but he's old I didn't really
question me Donna Mills is old too but she's still good looking when they take I don't hear it
through a little earlier what do you mean by old I mean your sake a look to be about 30s
oh 40 no what you're thinking I park no I know sake is she's got to be mid 40s at least okay Parker
the market has been around for a long time and a long time how long well I don't know but
she was probably made about 10 years ago that we see her yeah well now she maybe yeah she might
be 40 45 but in the film she's not 45 exactly she's like anyway and there's another one when I
have a mother think of her name and she's like I like your great to do to do taboo one was just on
I believe I agree Steven I have a lot more in common than we really have a very similar taste
a lot of these things yeah it's still you'll have to leave me out but I seriously I'm telling you
bambi woods was incredible she was a very attract which is why that movie was so popular that was
a big movie what is it I like most about let's you say when I see an attractive woman that's not
like I don't just look the other way say hey that's a really attractive woman if I were so inclined
I might you know I can understand I mean I think he looks great you and if I were you I'd
put that picture down it's sorry your credibility but what credit she's got incredible boobs and
she's got a beautiful face and she's you know cute tractor she's very cute now in a kind of
a opposite of Phoebe Kate's kind of yeah who's kind of like boyish and oh come on that's
a criteria they've got to be boyish boyish like I'm like I'm more I'm a more like I'm more of a
breast person which is like well like K Park you know who K Parker is yeah oh yeah I know I like
about a she is just this what is the word pendulous well I like I like that yeah that's sex

mute don't you want to play it on the I don't I don't think I don't think I don't think Bill wants me
playing cards on the year I haven't had a personal discussion with the better but I don't think
he I think he wants I think he wants to be the heavy topical guy come on we just can try
that right I think he wants to preserve the integrity of the cane format is what I think he has in my
I mean I don't want to do that though wouldn't you like to once in a while just do a little off the
wall stuff and play like the I 95 record and stuff like that but Bill gets mad at me you know
listen tell Bill the mind is over there okay we got these great numbers that are going to be
gigantic tell him to take a chill and go in the lunchroom I get it lunch and how do you do you
sit down and you just say when he when he if he tells you I need some help on this look I'm
straight in the eyes look at me look just take a chill get out of my life find your own business
exactly take a hike and you don't have fun being back at the W snooze it'll be like
do it out a lot we get along great yeah okay we got to do a break here at April
for the next day and calling it the mouth and salivating I think there's something going on there okay
Pembroke Pine hello hey Bill how you doing great yeah it's great to hear you back on the A and
that Steve came to be cutting the lady off there it's one of the funniest things I've heard come from
and I've never really gotten to listen to him too much I'm I'm number seven on the A.M. conversion list for you
all right let's hear another one yeah it's great having gotten to listen to A.M. probably since I was
15 years old back when the gold or was yeah but I got a question it's one of these things that
you get kind of curious and you just want to know and now like I say I haven't gotten to listen
to the other A.M. guys that much but I've been listening to Reneerie a little and a little bit of
Steve Cain is just does Mike Reneerie does he just slobber all over the mic when he's talking yeah that's
what it sounds like yeah it sounds like he's double-toned well you know when you got one finger way up
but you just the leaning kind of the other nostril on the edge of the mic it's a very delicate balance
and he does it incredibly well he really does he does a good job but I've touched this one thing
I was curious about I'm a speech therapist so it kind of hit me as funny it just sounded like he's
just hitting all over the place I'll wait a minute what did you say oh you're a speech therapist
I thought you said you were Steve's therapist well I've tried that too because if you were
Steve's therapist after the performance you just put on it here with that picture man
I'm in a lot of trouble no I'll never have Steve on my couch thank you okay but great to hear you
back in the same with the bird good to hear you bird thank you sir okay thank you all boy okay
yeah Steve was an interesting guy 21 till 2 is that the worst you want to use
W-I-O-D and we'll go to Miami hello how you doing pal all right how's it going hey right hi
I was really shocked two weeks ago I left for Vegas for a while I'd come back and you guys switched
over on me yeah we sure did boy we got out we broke out in the middle of night yeah we waited till
you were out of town though yeah I was gonna call you but I just couldn't stay until two
o'clock or four o'clock in the morning he was just too hard to do right first of all I've never
heard you on the A and before so it was my first time for that great so in other words you're like
you're like number eight number eight great I listen to you guys like about eight or nine months on the FM
and I think you guys do sound a little bit over here great yeah well we feel better that helps a lot
you know I buy all I want to say congratulations to switching over and good luck you guys thanks
a lot a heap all right adios bye bye I'll read the dirage why is Larry King say that one four
three one four three and of course Larry I'll be on here exclusively on W-I-O-D
tonight because he's a great American and he'll be right on after Henry Barrow and that special
10 to 11 hour election night oh man it's gonna be like indigestion isn't it that probably you
can feel it already in fact by 10 o'clock Henry will be in a position to like wrap up all the other
because I have a feeling that by 7 30 all three networks are going to take any little bit of fun
and any little tiny hope you know the polls were like narrowing like the last NBC poll was only five
points and a last CBS poll was down to six points and this morning Harris came out with a poll
it was only four points wow and a margin of error is like plus and minus three so yeah so if you're
really want to get into that school of swishful thinking I mean it's possible it could be within a
couple of points either way and it really would all depend on who turned out but the problem is
then you look at the electoral college and you just say hey who the hell are we kidding you know
just it's a country of Yahoo's and Rednecks and good luck to us all okay all right both I think
is on eight and what the Palm Beach line hello hello Neil yeah great first time caller here good
move down here from the mistake on the lake from where the mistake on the lake Cleveland oh yeah
I remember that do you is that what they refer it yeah they do it up there yeah that's what it's
I like here is the only great lake that you'd actually walk across from Cleveland to Buffalo
yeah you could easily do that but anyway um just wanted to call um I used to listen to you every
damn away to call during the morning but I can never call but now that um you're in the afternoon
I can call you yeah don't you think that this time of day is more conducive to people being able to
call and do things and get involved as opposed to the morning where I mean everybody if they got any
kind of life at all they ought to be doing stuff right but the only thing was everybody down a
caulder used to like to listen to you talk about them and stuff they all would listen and now they
can't yeah well now they can listen from 10 until uh 1230 no but they're all punching the brains
out yeah they can listen in between races on our Sony Walkman anyway I got a hot horse here today
if you were going up there are you cereal for sure it's not whirling rainbow is it in the
seven you know fifth race you know fifth race you know fifth race in seventh race but if you

but it just wasn't gonna work out well that's okay you guys are great anyway you know we think so
okay thanks a lot thanks bye bye wasn't that nice huh yeah you know you know Stan said long long
time ago and Stan used to be on that that I was unhappy unless every caller said hello to me too
you know and that's not true who said that Stan made here and uh it's not true at all and people
generally do not say hello to me and I have no problem with that at all it's fine but today like
every caller is saying hi to me it's incredible and before you go could you do one short thing for me
