Sport radio 560, are they out of the crew already?
They're two on a cover, my car.
The Neil Rogers.
How are they?
I think they're out of the material.
That's why I sent all of the sign with the SAC-2.
Free for date and brown.
Or pound 560.
A 500 box, D-Holl, you lose that much.
The first race and highly in there.
Anywhere else?
On the show, do not necessarily reflect those of WQAM.
Beasley read acquisitions.
Or, they'll be using broadcast group.
Now, Neil Rogers on Sport radio 560 QAM.
At agency people are assholes.
You know that Neil Rogers is the one.
And he doesn't listen to shows.
So we won't hear this.
Probably get it from George Lee.
He hears it sometimes.
Up Lindsey, somehow he's the...
Man, it is.
Listen to every word, switch and CDs.
And they must be short CDs.
But anyway, Neil Rogers is the first one to rail away
about professional courtesy and about being a professional
in the radio industry.
Right?
The music's blasting down the hall.
No, you're up there, Hickie.
He's starting the other thing.
Salesman comes in and erupts from during the show.
A word is misspelled in the ad copy.
And Neil Rogers is going crazy.
A rip in this guy to shreds his family the whole thing.
So yesterday I come to find out that a fact
that was supposed to be sent to me by not more
giving some details of where I'm supposed to be tonight
is sent to the wrong fax machine.
I guess not more call the switchboard.
And that's the number you got.
And Neil reads the facts on here.
Which is fine.
That's part of his thing, whatever.
I'm sure he appreciates that if it was the other way around.
And then at the same time,
you would figure out a professional courtesy
that the gathered of these details
were important to me.
And at least return it to my box,
which I do have a clearly label box here at the radio station.
Yeah.
So I was George.
I said, hey, George, you got that fax.
I got to find out what I'm doing tonight.
So the guy was going to fact me some information.
I understand that Neil intercepted it.
And it turns out he tore it up and threw it in the garbage.
So you're pissed off at Neil because he did that.
Well, is that professional courtesy?
This is the man.
This is the poster child for professionalism in the radio industry.
And I told Dufflin Z.
And I'm going to yell at him.
Sit down and have a conversation with Neil.
Get this way to work.
Think out.
That'll be good.
Yeah, I don't even mind if I have the piece of thing together
like a ransom.
Yeah.
I'm working here.
I'm trying to earn a living, whatever.
You can say whatever you're one about me.
I'm a professional courtesy from the guy that rails away the most.
I mean, who gets more upset than Neil
if something doesn't done professionally.
So basically calling him the hypocrite.
That's what you're saying.
You use the words by 6705.
What are you scared to use the word?
You think he's a hypocrite?
Say he's a hypocrite.
No, I don't even know if he's a hypocrite because you know what?
As long as you're a hypocrite.
And the word that is why he feels about people, see?
Which means you're a hypocrite.
No, that's the next one.
You're a hypocrite.
See because you have to do it right.
If you're going to be the first to do it right.
I don't even think he's worthy of being a hypocrite.
I think he's consistent.
He just doesn't give a crap about anybody else, which is fine.
But then don't be crying.
Don't go running down the Greg Reads office the next time the music is playing too loud
from power 96.
All right, because they don't have any more professional courtesy than you do.
Neil, right.
Yeah, yeah.
The most astonishing part of the whole thing.
He must be maybe when you start ballooning up like that, you know, because I've been
fat for many, many years.
So it doesn't bother me as far as my brain is concerned.
But when you start ballooning up like that and get real porky, it starts affecting
your mind and your memory, your short-term memory starts going.
I was talking about this on the air yesterday.
We had the crossover.
And as far as my intercepting your facts, Beful, which he's at least seven yards away
by the way, but don't have the balls to come and look me in the face and talk about this.
But as far as intercepting the facts, the facts machine is like five feet behind me here.
All the facts that come to this number come to me right in this room.
It's not like intercepting.
I read it on the air.
We had a little crossover for whatever reason yesterday.
And I mentioned that the time.
I guess what?
Here's a fact from that more about, and I'm going to read it on the air.
And he, haha, haha, did he say I need that by the way?
Please say that for me.
All the facts said was to reiterate that he's going to be there tonight and we agreed on
a $500 fee.
And here's a list of the other 72,000 people that are going to be there.
Dan Moreno, Don Chula, Bill Clinton, Abe Lincoln, FDR.
Everybody was ever born to be there.
And here's this.
Did he say he needed it?
No.
Save that for me.
No.
Like I intercepted this.
Like there was something surreptitious about the way I did this.
Like I sneaked in here in the middle of the night or something and intercepted a fact
when I talked about this on the air with him yesterday.
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
See, it must be really desperate there.
You know, because let's face it, that scoreball is really boring.
You know, I mean, everybody knows that.
It's for rush marches.
And there's nothing else going on.
Nobody cares about the Marlins, which they finally figured out.
They know nothing about hockey.
I mean, you know, there were two playoff games last night.
They know nothing about that.
So what's there to talk about?
So let's just rip Neal and ask, which is fine with me.
I have no problem with that.
But it's part of the professional, as important as concerned and professional courtesy.
D-4, you just had bad luck.
It was the wrong day.
That ended the day D-4.
Didn't I come on air yesterday and say, in fact, I finally adopted the attitude you're
supposed to have around here.
After a year and a half of fighting and I finally said,
I don't give a sh** anymore.
And there you go.
And I was in the happiest mood of my life yesterday.
I'm rolling along.
I mean, that's the way they all are.
I mean, they don't seem to mind if they're blasting the music down the hallway.
Either the word I'm using is pussy, of course.
They're just too terrified to go down and say,
cut the crap because we're trying to do a showdown here.
But, you know, the excuse is, well, we don't care.
We're just not going to be into that crap.
Well, let Neal be the crap disturber.
But that all I did yesterday.
I just, I don't give a sh** anymore.
Right.
So it's just bad luck on your part, D-4,
because I just don't care about these things anymore.
So it just unfortunate that it was on your own.
And not only that, but don't feel like I singled you up.
Because every single fact that has come here to this machine
for the sports people, I've done the same thing.
You're the witness.
I tear them all up and throw them away.
And as far as professional courtesy is concerned,
the professional thing to do would be
give all your people with your other 85 jobs,
give them the right facts number to contact you.
And stop wasting our facts paper in here.
We got enough assholes out there to waste their facts paper every day.
Seriously, if I had the money that it cost to chop down all the trees
to, you know, to make the paper for all the facts paper
that gets wasted in here, I could retire right now.
I could get out of there here.
But I understand it.
I didn't hear any of your show this morning.
We had little spy reports when I came in that people were psychotic
about that facts, about the net board thing,
that were the 4,500 other celebrities tonight.
And the 500 bucks he's going to make,
which he'll lose in two races in Halea.
That's a bit of a poll question, by the way.
I was asking Joe Costello this and I had a tough question.
Which one of the following three here at our station?
Do you think loses a higher percentage of his income?
I'm not talking about actual dollars,
because there's no great disparity as far as the incomes of the three people.
But which one of the following three do you think loses a higher percentage of his income?
Any K, D-Full or the Humper?
That's a tough question.
That was from?
Yeah, well, easy come easy go, I guess.
That's interesting to think about.
Huh? Would you have any thoughts on that?
You're going to have to make them actually make money?
Gambling?
No, no, no.
No, no.
I don't know any explanation.
I know one person, one person in my life,
who I believe makes money gambling,
and that's Ron Bash.
He was at Pompeville last night.
I mean, this guy, that's what he does for a living.
He's a professional gambler.
And I mean, he really plunges it in,
but he was kind of quiet there last night at Pompeville Park.
He was like, you know, usually it's, hey, all right, you.
Pretty quiet there.
I think things that the medallins couldn't have gone to good last night,
Rami, so he made an early exit.
But no, he's a good guy.
But I think he makes money.
Fat Rich doesn't make money?
No.
He will tell you that he makes money.
No, no, seriously, I mean Rich is a great guy.
He's a good friend of mine, but he's got this thing.
It's an ego thing.
He will tell you like when we left there last night,
I always tell you exactly.
If I lost 80 bucks, I'm not a big game.
I won 30 bucks last night.
Okay?
To the penny, I won 30 dollars.
And he says his were leaving.
Yeah, I think that's about what I did, too.
If I would have said, I lost 20 bucks, he would have said,
yeah, I think I, you know, because that's just a thing.
It's an ego thing because he went through that period of time
like we all have, where he was hot as a pistol.
Remember?
I mean, he was, he couldn't tear up a ticket.
He was, uh, winning like crazy for about a year and a half.
And then all of a sudden the bubble burst.
And he came back to the real world.
By the way, he told D-Full I got a fast form.
Don't we have it?
Wait a minute.
Here's another copy of the fast form.
Oh, geez, look at that.
Oh, Christ.
They refactor thing from that work.
And I threw it up before I realized what it was.
God damn it.
What a jackass, you know?
I don't give a sh** anymore.
Yeah, me either.
Hey, listen, you know, the 500 bucks he would get for doing that thing.
I just imagine all the food he'd buy and how fat he'd be.
I'm trying to save his life.
I'm trying to save this man's life.
He's ballooning up just like the booster.
That's going to be the next poll.
Which one of those at the end of the year is going to weigh the most?
He is getting right in that category every day.
When you can actually, you know, when you see somebody every day,
you don't notice mild nuances in the change of their appearance.
But with him, now that we're up here on the third floor,
I see him every day, you can see the expansion every day.
It's like watching them build a sawgrass, which I did.
You know, every day, you see a little more, a little more,
a few more bricks here.
Man, oh man.
Boy, oh boy.
He must be really more reckoned in the big bucks.
So what's he wanted about so much?
What does he want?
And life must be really good, as he says.
Maybe even cash to bet this year.
Oh, I got all kinds of good stuff today.
All kinds of good stuff.
And don't let them rip off to me.
Ten minutes past 10 is 560 WQAM.
I don't have to grow up.
I'm a Dunzer of kids.
So I can always feel myself for something bad I did.
It's going to be cool when I kill everyone at school.
Cause my dad said it's okay.
I'll exercise my rights.
That's why we have an R.A.
That lets me be a Dunzer of kids.
He becomes a usb.
I told him how to shoot.
Well, he really loves the side of what?
No way.
That kind of cute.
I'm a homestead.
I'll not see red next to the side on the internet.
I'm a lifetime member of the NRA.
That's why I raise a Gunzer of kids.
Oh, right.
Oh boy, I quit this in my gun.
I'll play that Laura.
Gunzer of kids.
And agency people I raise.
Okay, just a reminder in case you forgot.
1015 is 560 WQAM.
Yeah, the Republican Party, by the way,
you know that thing about mom and,
how does it go?
Apple pie, mom and Chevrolet.
Remember that is American as,
well, not that Republican Party has got their own kind of motto.
They stand for guns, God and hate.
That's the new Republican Party.
Thank God that the NRA was able to influence those Republicans
in the Senate yesterday so they could vote down at Bill.
Because God forbid we should have mandatory out a federal level,
mandatory background checks that those great gun shows.
God forbid.
We'll get to the OJ story in a minute,
by the way, speaking of slaughter.
I don't even know where to start,
but let's go back to the end yesterday.
You know, we have a lot of well-meaning people out there,
and then we have some assholes too.
But how can you take something as simple as the transaction
I made yesterday and turn it into something so psychotic
and everybody, even though they mean well,
they don't know what they're talking about.
I've had this happen so many times over the years.
You ask a question.
I mean, if I don't know, I'll be the first one to tell you.
I never had a CD burner before, okay?
I got a great Panasonic right now,
which that transaction yesterday,
and it wasn't Boka Bryant's fault.
It was definitely the people at that same ash place,
whatever that is, that ash hole over there.
That was the problem.
There was no problem.
He set up for them to get some nice free publicity,
for them to get some business.
I wasn't looking for a wholesale.
You know, you need to retail price,
whatever anybody else off the street would pay for it,
and give them a little plug,
and quite frankly, to show you how slow I am,
I never heard of them before.
Other sandmash stores in the town,
were hauling up saying,
oh, you should have come to us.
We would have been over backwards.
We would have delivered it personally.
So I haven't only had the one up there at large,
where they had the actual problem.
Because the other ones...
And I don't know, like I said,
I never heard of them before.
And besides one guy who wasn't there,
they had two days.
They never heard of you either.
So anyway, to make a long story short,
here I get the thing in here yesterday,
Boka Bryant paid, which by the way,
I wanted to pay with a check,
and they turned down,
it wouldn't take his check.
He paid with a credit card,
which I guess they didn't bother to check.
But at any rate,
and so then I gave him a check here yesterday,
and it's all paid forward done.
Nobody left town with the equipment,
you know, $600 piece of equipment,
which they send here.
And I wanted to buy a bunch of blank CDs on there,
you know, it would be like,
if you bought your first BCR 25 years ago,
and you know, there was one blank tape.
And of course, back in those days,
they wouldn't give you a blank tape,
but it would be like a real short one, you know,
like a 30-minute job,
like a demo kind of a thing.
And you'd have to go out and buy your own damn blank tape.
And it would be like,
so if you said to the guy at this sound advice,
or wherever it was,
okay, I want to buy the BCR,
and I want to buy 20 blank VHS tapes,
or beta, whatever you bought.
And it's, oh, well, we know you can't get those.
We know him.
And you'd go, crap, I mean, what is that?
What's the point?
And so the last part of the show yesterday,
I mean, turned into this big, psychotic thing,
and everybody meant well,
including Blufflin,
the Ubering's being a CD this morning,
which I appreciate profusely,
a TDK,
a recordable CD,
CDRXG74 for musical,
and a yaddy-oddy-oddy,
and it's got the logo,
yeah, I've got new times,
we're way ahead of you, Greg.
We don't miss a beat here, okay?
And tell D-photogate his own goddamn faxes.
But at any rate, so anyway,
compact, dis-digital audio recordable,
that's what it has to say on the disc.
And that's it.
I read the manual with my machine yesterday.
It doesn't say anything about it's got to be a Phillips disc,
and we had people calling in here yesterday saying,
oh, no, you can't just buy any other disc.
It has to be a Phillips disc.
Remember that?
Now, stop and think of the logic in that.
When you've got your first cassette recorder,
okay, maybe it was a Sony.
Did that mean?
Because Max L, I hate to record the news to you,
TDK and Max L, they don't make cassette decks,
or CD burners.
They don't make the hardware.
They make only the software, right?
That would be like saying, if you got a CD cassette deck,
you can only play and record CDs made by Sony in there.
And everybody would go, yeah, right.
And the same is true with this.
You look at your reading the manual.
It's always a lot better to read the instruction manual
than listen to people calling in with all their bull crowd.
I mean, I know that guy, that's revolutionary,
but it's always better to read the,
because the people at Phillips say,
who invented CDs, by the way.
Did you know that?
Yes, it's in the manual.
They're very proud of it.
And the fact that they're from a Holland mix and even better.
But they tell you that, here's the logo.
And as long as this logo was on there, you can use these CDs to record on.
There was a Phillips CD that came in here.
So now I'm running around frantically all over.
I go to Best Buy, I go to Circuit City,
I go all over the place that they have the Phillips stuff.
No, no, but they got always other ones.
And I look in the manual, I see that if it's got the logo on there,
so I go back to Best Buy, I get a whole bunch of these.
What are these?
What the hell is it?
One moment please.
Where the hell are they?
Christ, what an eye-d-
Who's-
Oh, here they are.
Yeah, they're Memorex.
Now Memorex don't make CD decks, do they?
No.
Do they make stereos?
No.
No.
No.
But they, and it's a CDR, 74.DA,
and it's got the little logo on there, you know,
a recordable digital audio, etc.
And that's it!
And guess what?
They work just fine.
I see the smell of the night,
I don't know the smell of the people here.
They have a script that can really sing, man.
I'll be spooky, spooky guys today.
I see the smell of the night.
That's one of these.
So it's like, I'm gonna give you a wee bit of my life.
It is Christ and you quit clearer.
You can almost put it all up, we can't even rent.
Rang is one.
Let's have a spin.
Time to look at some of my brothers' drawings.
And you'll be people I ran.
Don't let them be people.
Oh.
I didn't know it was in Indian.
But at any rate, so there's a little Louise.
I'm glad that I selected that Louise
thing to play off that particular CD
that I burned right there in my house.
I burned one in a CD too.
And I'm pretty glad to improv.
I am psyched.
I'm whipped up to a frenzy about it.
I'm so happy.
Even though I had to go through all the bull crap yesterday,
it made, I guess, for some entertaining crap.
You know, killed a couple of hours.
Got both a Brian suicidal.
As if he's not already manic enough without any,
I mean, what are they blaming him for?
And then we get the facts from that malcontent guy,
whatever his name was.
Mal, Mel, blaming him again.
Mel.
Yeah.
Mel content.
Probably works for some ad agency on the side.
And he's blaming the old, wasn't me, it was bull.
Well, you know, we know you're trying to save your job now, okay?
No problem.
It's a great piece of equipment.
I have no problem with it at all.
And as far as any shortage of these disc memorets,
whatever, you know,
it's even a lot and get them anywhere, okay?
They got millions of them.
Like there's some shortage of these, like these people calling in
or yesterday at the end of the end of the end,
and Bluff, who meant well, but of course he's a little behind the times.
If you haven't noticed, he's, you know, about 10 days late
and 200 years short.
How's his death coming?
No.
Okay.
But I mean, he meant well, but he's telling me they're
all really expensive and they're $7 a piece,
and you got to get him by mail order,
and he brings me in a number this morning.
And I show him I got a whole bunch of these memorets ones here,
and they sound great.
Yeah, what's that?
What's that?
Right.
What a piece of equipment.
It's a gem of the only piece.
You want to buy one, I want to buy some cheap CDs?
Now don't be pirate in your CDs, okay?
Goddamn it.
Don't be doing this now and getting CDs
and then making copies and giving them to your friends
because that's really bad.
Let's get this roll.
That's the repair.
Yeah.
You got to get this.
You got to get this.
You got to get this.
You got to get this.
PUNIN and their pants that you guys are all going to be doing
and instead of everybody going out and buying, you know,
for 12 or 15 or 18 bucks, the original CD that you're going to be doing that.
Stop doing those things.
So that takes care of that one little problem there.
Nice going.
Congratulations.
Excellent.
Thank you, Volker Brian.
Even though you had to go through a very traumatic and I apologize to him,
I don't apologize to D-Full because D-Full don't need that $500.
Those horses are getting plenty of hay without all that help from him.
The $500 and he's not going to wind up not going to that thing.
I mean, with all the contacts that he's got,
all these sports flunkies we got running around,
they can't get a hold of that more.
Who the hell is he kidding?
He just wants to make it into a big consulib.
Another reason to start ripping the crap out of me
is because I said he's getting gigantic.
I'm concerned about him.
This crap that I don't care about other people,
if I didn't care about other people,
would I be concerned about Boobshambi?
I barely know Boobshambi.
And I don't dislike him.
He's a good talent.
He's got a good voice.
He knows his crap.
He does a great job on those Marlon games.
I like the Bookshambi.
I would just like to see him live beyond the age of 25, whatever the hell he is, you know?
And the same with D-Full.
I've known this guy for 20 years for Christ's sake.
He was always basically the same.
He was never fat.
He was never slim.
He was a little on the slim side, actually.
And he's ballooning up like a monster.
He is killing himself.
And the reason he's killing himself,
and he's able to afford those big fattening luxurious meals,
is because he's making all the money on the side doing all of these things.
All this extraneous stuff he's into.
Everybody look.
There he is.
He's got that Saturday morning, the Sony, or whatever sports challenge.
See, there's a plug for a D-Full.
Do I listen to it?
No.
But nevertheless.
And he shows on Whammy and those.
Every TV state on sports channels, sunshine.
Everywhere you look.
There he is with Kimba Bojangles.
And they got another.
I don't think he'd be graduating, you know, often.
But he's eating himself to death with all that cash.
That he's not the part that he's not losing it to track.
Whatever he's left over.
Here's Homestead.
Hello.
Well, Neil?
Yes, sir.
How are you doing today?
Great.
Good.
Let me ask you something about the heat game and the New York game.
Okay.
Let's go to Fort Lauderdale, huh?
Neil, what's up?
How you doing, sir?
Hey, can you believe that?
Can you believe that, call, sir?
Can you believe what a jackass we got to start the show today?
That's the second thing.
I hate to follow that.
Hey, about the D-Full thing.
I'm listening to both sides now.
I'm listening to both sides.
Both sides now.
I think you did the wrong thing, everybody.
No, I did not.
But about guns too.
Let me say it again.
I didn't do the wrong thing, but because you were a gun lover,
therefore we wanted to get out of here.
No, I didn't.
Well, just a little bit.
It sounds like it.
Is that where you're going with this?
Yeah.
Aha, I knew it.
How did I know that?
How did I know that?
See, if I would have said that the NRA was great, you would have said,
nice going there, tearing up that fax on these things.
No, it's not very good.
You're just a suckle with nature.
Let me make a point.
Go ahead.
All right.
Just a suckle, but go ahead.
Stay at the pet, and feel care.
Stay at the pet, and feel care.
You can see what?
Carey laws.
You can see your carry laws.
See, you gun violence rates dropped 30%.
How do you explain that?
Just the fact that you're going to see it again.
I don't know what the fact is.
I don't even know what you just said.
You can see your carry laws.
Do you like them or not?
Can see your carry laws?
You know what that is?
You mean in other words, let you carry a concealed weapon?
Right.
And you think that everybody should walk around with a concealed weapon?
Violence.
Gun violence goes down 30%.
Yeah, right.
It does.
You look it up, idiot.
Yeah, look it up.
You look it up.
You look it up.
Stick it up your ass, idiot.
That's right.
If everybody had a gun and a holster on their thing, like the old Wild West, idiot.
See, that's what I'm saying right off the bat.
I knew it immediately.
As soon as he, yeah, it takes to, you know, wants to take a shot at me.
Yeah, you did the wrong thing there and they goes in.
It was gun-loving thing.
D-fo, you can have that guy, okay?
He's one of your people.
Asshole.
Not D-fo, this guy.
Well, 26 after 10 at 560, WQM, Hollywood.
Holy mackinon!
This is Joe Bowen, the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and you're listening to the Hockey Authority, Neil God!
And don't forget, by the way.
Ad agency, people are assos.
1031 at 560, WQM.
I love those gun nuts, man.
Those are my favorite people.
The gun huggers, the gun squeezers, the guys with a real little tiny like weasel-like penises, you know, that have their phallic thing.
Yeah, there's definitely a direct correlation between the fact that we got a lot more people running around with concealed weapons and the fact that violent crime is done.
There's definitely a correlation there.
They showed us statistic on CNN a couple of days ago.
I think the number was 55.
Look it up by the way, stupid.
55,000 and some people were killed with guns, handguns in this country last year.
And in the whole country in Japan, the whole year, I think the figure was two or three for the whole year.
And you want to know why?
Because nobody's walking around with handguns over in Japan.
Or in most other civilized countries either.
But it's a total waste of time because you'll never, ever break through this mentality.
It is ingrained like apple pie and...
That's the American fucker.
And God and hate.
It's like just as ingrained as any of those other things.
And Chevrolet, although I do like Corvette.
So there you go, sir.
You don't have to worry about a thing because you got all your buddies up there in the NRA.
They're paying everybody off.
And they can't pass anything that makes any sense.
So we got the new times out this week.
Their annual best of and more stuff and et cetera and so on.
Which is very talk about crime.
Wow.
Here's the best AM...
Well, let's start with the best FM.
Best FM radio personality.
New times, the pseudo intellectuals over there.
Pick a guy I never heard of.
Albe Silk on EDR on Jamit 99.1.
And to go on and on about him.
Readers choice was Howard Stern.
But new times likes Albe Silk.
Best AM radio personality was...
Hey, stupid, Hank Goldberg.
See, we always like this though, like, you know.
Like, remember the year that they picked Phil Henry and the Readers picked me?
See, that's good because it gives the station a little bit of balance.
Even though some people claim I don't care about anybody else.
Which, of course, is a blatant f-ing lie.
But, you know, when people are getting fat,
they start to reacting badly and blaming everybody else.
I know.
Anyway, speaking of that, Hank Goldberg, it says his four-hour talk show,
Weekdays on WQM from 2 to 6 PM, is ostensibly a sports program.
But Goldberg's pugnacious punditry,
woo!
stretches far beyond the wide world of sports.
One recent Tuesday afternoon, for example,
the hammer managed to pound on the following topics.
Bego Co. Restaurant, I was the only one there who didn't have Blue Harry said.
Highly a racetrack.
What's that skinny disease?
Anorexia and anorexic wouldn't throw up there.
And the war between the mayors over the Mimie Circle,
Penelope is getting on my nerves again,
if you can't see that he's grandstanding.
His relentless self-assurance, whether he's touting a 30-to-one long shot at Gulf Stream,
raiding against Mikkissuki Indian gaming,
or chatting amably with a Panther's defenseman.
I hate to break the news to you, but Denise Pong fans have never been a Panther's defenseman.
But nevertheless, makes his an undeniable voice of authority.
If you're looking for a truly independent passionate, old-school chronicler of Mimie sports
and life, forget the Harold, trust the hammer.
That was funny.
Reader's choice, Neil Rogers.
So there you go. That's nice.
QAM, we went out all the way along there.
Greg Reed was happy. He was trying to pedal his way.
Get out of here. Greg, we already got our own copy.
Okay, and he just turned around and ran out.
By the way, did Duff come in here and sit down and discuss with me
that the situation about the effect of...
...okay. That was the best part.
That was my favorite part.
Duff Lindsay should come and have a conversation with me
about my professionalism and whether or not I passed along the facts,
that I read to the man right on the ear here yesterday.
I read it to him.
Did he come running in here like any time at all
or did he come waddling in here anything?
Say, hey, you got that facts?
Did he do that? No.
No.
But what he does is go on here the next morning,
belly-ickened about the fact that somehow it never reached him.
Like I'm supposed to stick it in his box and the facts too, you know?
And then see, I told you, once we saw those mailboxes up there,
do we have a mailbox? No.
No.
But now that the sports nerds are got a mailbox,
NAAAH, you see.
So he just used that as an excuse to lure it over the fact
they got a mailbox and we don't.
But guess what? Do we care? No.
No.
That's right. See, I picked the greatest day in the history of my life
to take that whole attitude, which is...
I don't give a sh** anymore.
Yeah! That's my new attitude now.
Starting yesterday and I feel a lot better as a result of it.
I've got my CD burner.
Life is great. Life is sweet.
Which I think is his line.
So anyway, in this disgusting best of...
And keep in mind that these are the pseudo-intellectuals over there, okay?
New Times Magazine, the self-proplanned pseudo-intellectuals.
So you think that they would be outraged at things like this.
But never. Here's the best radio station.
Here's their choice.
I mean, this is so anxious, so unacceptable.
But you know what it reminds me of?
What do I do with that letter of the editor?
I probably buried that thing by now.
Long. Oh, here it is.
Newspapers, prejudice against Christians says,
carols are relic in western.
I was appalled that you would print the cartoon on April 26th,
depicting Christians as the enemy of the students or anyone else.
Since prayer was taken out of the classroom,
as violence is entered with many deaths and injuries.
We Christians don't hurt people of different views.
We pray for them.
And that's what they said in the Inquisition, too, I guess.
Following every disaster, the President or an official says,
let us pray for the victims.
Why is the Sun coming?
We are not sent and they are also prejudiced.
We Christians are constantly persecuted by the media.
Yeah.
They just pretend they don't get it, you know?
Like this is a Christian country, isn't it?
No.
Right.
Doesn't everybody else have a right to a different point of no?
So the same thing with this particular issue,
best radio station, New Times Magazine, selects 97.7 FN Unlicensed.
Now this is just above the Ecolomore.
They picked the best drug dealers in town.
Isn't that one going to be next?
Yeah, I'm on.
Must be.
This will be like saying, the best arsonist,
the best murderer, well we know who that is,
I'll get to that in a minute.
I'll wait till you hear this story about,
about, you guys better strap yourselves in today, okay?
And don't lip off to us.
Best radio station, 97.7 FN Unlicensed.
See, when they're in the newspaper business,
no have to get license from the federal government
and spend millions and millions of dollars to get it,
and equipment and all this other stuff.
But I guess you can, you know,
have this kind of La Zé Fair attitude
about the broadcasting industry.
It says, this is the real and ill-contemporary format.
DJs play everything from Motown to Hip Hop,
with no annoying commercials.
Ads are rare on 97.7,
though every once in a while an MC will pull your gig
of his own or one of his buddies.
But every business has bills to pay, right?
Like this is a legitimate business they're talking about.
This station is also interactive and community oriented.
Especially in using other rides,
with a lively music bit,
an EGA will ask you to call our rapid-fire questions
in a callable respond example.
Would you give me money? Yes, I will. Yes, I will.
How much would you give me $20? $20?
During high school football season,
colors bring their team pride of the year for all to hear.
We're not sure who's running the show after the FCC rated
the Liberty City Studios in July 1998
and carried away their 2,000 watt transmitters.
But good ideas are like mushrooms that pop up overnight.
And within a few weeks of the raid,
the station was out again on the year.
When we got tired of the golden oldies
and modeling slow dance tune segments,
we surf over to 89.1 on license
for a more raw and less eclectic hip-hop format
but to signals a little weak.
So they like over at New Times,
they like illegal is what they like.
That's what they like the best.
When they get tired of some of the stuff on this illegal station,
then they turn it over to another one.
Nice! Nice message that you're sending out there
over there at New Times, you assholes.
You morons.
And you know something,
I don't doubt that they're playing better music.
I'm playing better music on my CDs now
than I got my CD burner.
But what the hell's that got to do with it?
Jesus Christ, I mean,
we're talking crazy people over there.
And we get so much of this from the audience too.
Oh yeah, those pirate stations are great.
They're breaking the effing law.
That's some little tiny like J-walking law.
They're cluttering up the airwaves
that people have invested millions and billions of dollars
to put legitimate commercial stations on the air
that are trying to make a living with crap,
with whatever they want to put on there.
And by the way,
they're also using every goddamn word that's ever invented,
which if we use it, we're going to go to jail.
You can't, I don't even have time between now
and two o'clock to mention all the goddamn laws that they're breaking.
Oh well, yeah, but we like it.
Great!
Go to work for New Times, they like it too.
Bunch of assholes.
Always voted that we're assholes.
Thank God for a city link, man.
Thank God for them.
They suck me, I suck them.
Well, that's the way life works.
I don't want to start getting too excited
because then you think I care and I don't.
I don't care anymore.
That's my new attitude.
I feel great about it too, just like that facts.
Okay, D-Fo, I don't care.
If you feel bad about it, it's too bad.
In fact, why doesn't he demand the $500?
He's not going to miss out on that thing.
He'll be there with Bells on.
Like he doesn't know Marino and Shula
and all the other people that are on that list.
Every single one of them was one of his sports nerd buddies.
So what's the problem?
Call one of them up.
They'll give you the inside scoop.
But he's got to make a big issue out of it.
Like I'm some kind of an asshole in son of a bitch
just because they said he's getting fat
and you are getting fat.
Okay?
We're trying to help you and you don't want to be helped.
Always these people are in denial, you know?
Like Fat Boy, we'll get in the him in a minute.
24-11 at 560 WQM.
Don't miss out on the bloody cloud.
Yes.
Are you?
I wear two fold shoes to stay and something's on this right.
I took a walk on down the street and I took out my flashlight.
And I suspected something funny when I saw Father Flores.
Then I jumped over the wall and then I'd done Hato's Dough.
Don't me about something to hurt so I looked around some more.
And I suspected something funny when I found a bloody cloud.
A bloody cloud.
Oh, I thought it had to tell Kato a bloody cloud.
Roy.
Oh, whoa, whoa.
That thing we knew, okay, went on a losby from all right.
Now he's in an L.A. J. Jones for double on the site.
And I believe it's first degree.
Murder, he's guilty of it's because I'm a bloody cloud.
Oh, right.
This is an astonishing third.
Let me preface this third by the way.
I was telling you a little incident that happened when I left here yesterday, okay?
I kept there's a tie in coming.
So as I leave yesterday, we have some inside parking down here,
which of course being a big shot like I am, I have one of those special,
whatever they call those, those card keys, those clickers, whatever the LAR.
So I can get on the inside, even though it's like a wide open down there.
But nevertheless, so I parked on there.
And usually a 90% of the time if the spot is open, I wind up because of the time that I get here.
The one spot that's available that's covered happens to be the one on the very end there.
And a very tough spot to back out of.
But nevertheless, I do it just about every day.
So yesterday I'm going out to my car and here's the water Nazi.
Tell us.
And our program director, PG, our PG, Pussy, Galora, sitting out there on the bench,
chatting about whatever.
And I had like a couple of words to the program director on the way.
I cried the course not there because we don't speak.
And so I get in my car and I'm backing out, okay?
Now backing from that spot, as you know, is not the easiest thing in the world.
They have to back straight up and then make a little bit of an angle.
And then you know, make your right turn, go forward a little bit.
If there's another car park there, which they're always is on, just about.
And it was yesterday and then back up again and zip out of there.
I mean, it's not the end of the world, but it's not an easy thing.
And usually if anybody is standing back there or they're sitting on the bench,
they got enough common sense that when you're backing out of there,
that when anybody is backing out, you get up and get that out of the way.
And you know, you let them go as far back as possible because it's a tough squeeze.
So do they get up and get out of the way?
No.
They're sitting there.
You know, and so I'm watching in a review mirror and now Duff is giving me like
directions, okay?
He's showing me with a hand.
You know, come on back, come on back.
And I'm not watching her.
I'm watching him with a hand.
And so I'm backing up and they're turning a little bit, you know.
And all of a sudden, and here, ah!
And I rolled on a window and here's the water now.
See, she's, I know you hate me, but are you trying to kill me?
I said, hey, I'm just watching him.
He's giving me the directions and the hand signals.
And then of course, he turned on him and rightfully so.
So it was Blot that was trying to kill you, Phil, it's not me.
Now was I trying to hit her?
No.
But, well, just leave it in her mind.
That's something to think about.
Now I don't want to say who had a great line for this, by the way.
I don't want to mention who came up with this line.
She's already got that handicap sticker on her van.
But anyway, I don't want to say that.
That's bad.
So then when I backed up the second time,
ah!
Stop!
And of course, that time it was on purpose.
I knew I wasn't going to hit her, but I just put the fear of God in her.
So anyway, moving along from that,
I told you all the stories about the water not so you know how she loves to boss everybody around.
She's got her own little empire back there and she's been here a hundred years and got naked pictures.
And she's got her own little park and spot down there.
And none of us even think about the park in there.
So at any rate, come to find out that last night,
our sales face person, not a sales hole but our sales face guy.
You know what I'm talking about?
I've never told him the countenance life, but he's the face man.
Remember that memo I read that day about when they have trouble closing an account they send up there with a sales hole.
Yeah, and he smooths his ex-dolphin and that's good.
He's a good guy, like Roy.
Roy!
But, but, like everybody else, all the rest of us, he's not perfect.
And one of the flaws he has is, well, do I dare say the initials?
Do we know where they went to there, by the way?
Oh, man.
Do we have any idea?
In the Grove, but we can find out the exact spot.
Somewhere in the Grove, we'll find out the exact spot.
Too bad we couldn't have found out ahead of time, you know?
We'd have promoted.
Because I know where, you know, those old-fashioned pull chains they have in the toilet.
You know what I'm talking about?
Because Roy had dinner with the...
Oh, man.
OJ last night in the Grove.
And we have a whole core of little OJ lookers in this radio station.
Now, see, I happen to be one of those people.
You know, that thing with James Carville and Mary Maddal and her Magdalena, whatever her name is.
That's got to be one of the most bizarre marriages in history.
She's a real right-wing bitch and he's a real liberal, whatever hell he has balled at a geek.
And they're married.
You know?
They're probably screaming in the olive oil they're doing it.
You know, they're yelling, commie fascist, whatever.
So I'm just not one of those people that be friends.
I just can't do it.
I don't be friend right-wing lunatics.
It's just not in my best interest.
I can't do that.
I can't just can't set aside those kinds of things.
And the same would be if I knew somebody that turned out to be an ax murderer that would have murdered two people in cold blood and everybody knew about it,
I don't think I could continue to be that person's friend.
Now, maybe call me disloyal, call me hypocritical, whatever was this morning I was being called.
Fine, I don't care.
Because like I said, I don't give a crap anymore.
Call me whatever you want.
And so the fact that we have a core of OJ liquors in this building disturbs me greatly.
One of them, I don't want to mention her name, but almost got the cripple yesterday.
Has got all kinds of pictures of this creep, of this murdering piece of turd in her office all over the walls.
And our sales manager, screw in and her good friend Roy.
Also happen to be big OJ liquors.
There's a little fraternity, those three.
But then to find out that when somebody in the building discovered that Roy was going to have dinner with OJ last night,
so I dare mention that it was Sam the Sham who hasn't shown his face in here yet.
He's probably going to go into hiding for days now.
What?
No, he has no Sham.
No, you're right about that.
He has no Sham.
Of course, anybody that looks like the dead Andrew Kunein and why should he have any Sham?
He's probably on the houseboat right now.
He's got an old copy of Sports Illustrated that's got OJ on the cover.
And he slips it to Roy and he says,
you think you can get him to autograph this for me?
Huh?
He slips it to Roy.
He slips it to Roy.
And then Roy slips it to, oh well.
Oh, that was before?
Yeah.
Oh, many times.
We don't want to get into that.
Yeah, that's his business.
That's between them.
I mean, not figured it out literally.
It's between them.
Boy, there's a lot of crack goes on in this place, man.
I mean, you know what?
Like I said yesterday, I find out I've got a whole different answer.
I find it most amusing.
Not going to get upset about it.
Although I do get upset about the fact that we got assholes that lick OJ's butt.
That's what I draw the line, you know?
I can't stand that.
And now that I find out that we got to see,
and the thing with Sam, that doesn't surprise me because a lot of the guys we got around here are groupies.
The sports nerd people, they're groupies.
Oh, can I get your autograph?
You know, that kind of crap.
Jock Snippers.
But the notion that somebody wants that murdering piece of crap's autograph.
See, you don't have time to get my name spelled right in the Marlon program,
or do any of those other things.
Or they have like a meaningful promotion for the radio station.
He doesn't have time because he's too busy, you know, seeking glory.
Holes or whatever he's doing.
Getting autographs from Game of Celebrities.
Guys who want to wear a Jock strap.
You know, all of this other silly garbage.
Morons.
Like OJ.
Oh, man.
Maybe I'm wrong.
Anybody out there would go to dinner with OJ?
I bet you're, I bet you're, I know who would go to dinner with OJ.
If OJ bought, I don't want to mention no names.
They stuck.
Yeah, there you go.
He would go to dinner with OJ if OJ promised to buy.
In fact, you know, I'd be real interested because OJ is falling on hard financial times.
I'd be real fascinated to find out who bought that dinner last night between Roy and OJ.
Wouldn't that be interesting?
Because if OJ's got money to be buying Roy dinner, then he ought to be paying, you know, the goldmins.
Maybe they're still sitting there waiting to see who's going to pick up the check.
That could be it.
Well, maybe Rimmer will show up one of these days.
Maybe I'll just wander in by accident.
Oh, yeah, can I grab that?
Hold your breath, guys.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the mobile one line.
I got a whole Todd Dreck thing I got new here yet today.
Oh, yeah.
Major, major piece I got to do on that.
I don't want to lip off about it too much, but...
You know, in the past, I can only think, all the years I've been on the air, I can only think of a couple of times
that I've ever gone to the extraordinary lengths of getting involved.
One was with a satellite guy.
Remember that?
With a satellite dish?
And then there was one guy who insisted on advertising and I said no for years and I never did.
But there was another guy who got on the air and they turned out to be a real pain in the ass.
And we finally just blew him off and it was a nightmare.
And this thing that I got here with my friends at Culligan Water, who love the radio station, they love me.
I love them.
They, you know, we got a bottled water thing here that all the people up here on the third floor, they love the water, they love the Culligan people, they love the Culligan man.
I got that water softener they put in my house again.
A nice silky shower this morning.
My skin feels like I'm 100 years younger and great drinking water.
They're ecstatic to be on the air with me and I'm ecstatic to have them.
They're wonderful people.
Chris and a whole bunch of glimpses over there. They're great.
But we got Todd Dreck and we got these agency people.
I don't want to mention Mark Lipoff because then Todd will go off again.
You know, I want to lip off about that.
I will just say, hey agency people are assholes.
And I just foresee a disaster coming here.
You know, I just see something really which is unfortunate because they're very happy to be on the air with me.
I'm ecstatic to be with them.
They give me great service of the house.
They give us great service up here at the radio station.
It's a match made in heaven.
Only sales holes could screw up into you like this.
That's how solid it is.
That's how great things are between me and the Culligan people.
But leave it to our Todd Dreck in here and his guy, agency guy.
Who's a Shmab? Who's a Shmendrick?
And I just don't know what to do about it now because of course we have nobody involved in these things here.
Is Ray Perry involved?
No.
Do we even know if Ray Perry exists anymore?
No.
Are new sales managers?
No.
Did we were going to see every Tuesday morning he was going to come by.
These were the kind of things we were going to discuss with him.
Do we see him at all?
No.
Have we seen him ever since so we came up on the third floor except that he brought my Marlon tickets in?
No.
No.
See, in this case I do care.
Or, narrowly, I wouldn't care anymore.
But in this case I do care because they're nice people and they got a great company.
It's a natural.
It's a great fit.
But unfortunately I'm getting fits because we got ad agency people involved and a local sales guy here.
It's running around the hall creating problems with everybody in the building.
Even the janitor.
You know, the janitor he's melting off to about this stuff.
That's what Jeff Hyte told me.
Kent.
Hey listen, like I said, I don't care anymore.
Oh God, what a place.
And like I said, it's great.
It's the best place George and I have ever worked.
Because nobody cares.
Four minutes before 11 to find.
By the way, speaking nobody cares.
Wait till you find out who's hangs up there at the pre-knist in Baltimore getting ready for this weekend.
And on the ISDN phone line from Philadelphia where he has his full time job.
Bill Zenfur fills in for Hank this afternoon, which is embarrassing.
And then we got the mad dog.
Jim Mandice six o'clock seven thirty.
We got the Colorado Detroit hockey game.
You're selling your home looking to buy one.
Let me tell you about buy owner.
You can play here.
My family.
My daughter.
Oh right.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
Hi kids.
Y'all like cutting little stinkers?
That funny little sound that comes right out your stinker?
One of coffee me and do exactly like I do.
Get paid for writing little songs about boo-boo.
My brains are gone.
I'm trying to get my groove on.
But I can't figure out which spice girl I'm gonna fart on.
And Dr. Dre asked, you know, man, you pissed us.
Hey, I know.
What do I smell like?
It's game you low-play.
Well, since age 12 it seemed like I always smell like fast-ripping gases and dooties
was pretty swell.
I got pissed off when I took my jeans off and farted so hard that my lungs were backwards
like crisscrossed.
And every night I'm like, oh, thinner than one of my ass fasses of fat bitch who ain't too
fat.
Smell this honey.
You know, it's too late to miss a girl, huh?
I don't give a f***ing god-send me to stink the world up.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
My anus.
I could see you want to me kick out back in junior high.
Said the problem was something proled up my ass and die.
I shot him in the face with my vapour.
The worst happened later when I covered his death with used toilet paper.
Walked in the strip club.
My testers were filled up.
Moons of Bob Tannin took a dump and a kicker.
Went over to a dentist and had a f***ing agonist.
She lifted a leg up and I knew she was a fodder.
Nine and nine.
And sent him my life by with life too.
I just found out my mom got all gassed and I knew.
I told her I broke up to be a famous rapper.
They regretted about strange noises.
Made on the crap.
You know you was dirt when the women rushed to leave.
You drive her over back, but she wasn't needed to relieve her.
The sky of white castle said it was pretty cool.
But I had to go.
No drop the kids off and move.
My aim is.
My aim is.
My aim is.
My aim is.
My aim is.
S***.
My aim is.
My aim is.
My aim is.
My aim is.
My aim is.
My aim is.
S***.
Okay, so what's that smushed in, Mark?
Look off, he's in.
Four minutes after 11.
His file will get him in a minute.
Four minutes passed the hour at 50WQA and we got to build Zimper Show coming a lot.
for Hank at two. Can you believe that Bill's infertile?
No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.
Anyway, this is interesting. Here's a, I wish we had the Wamiya for just 30 seconds again,
so I could show these two facts. I don't even know how to describe this.
It's the same facts word for word, which I was going to get to, by the way, my
impatient listener out there. The first one is signed Barney, and the second one
is for Sa- he says, OI! Barney at the end of the first one, and then the second one,
in different type, in different font, it says, OI!
An atheist. Well, maybe he's progressing now, because we found out yesterday that the atheist
closet floor, that door is locked tight. Tight is a drum. I mean, I read that letter
from Holly Doherty, which I've saved. Religion is not the issue that great letter to the
editor in a herald yesterday, and the amount of response we got on it, we could have stuck
in your room for the Soviet Army left over in there. I mean, no response at all, which
I'm going to take a poll about that in a little while, by the way, because I think that George and I
have been whistling in a fart storm for a long time. But, you know, I'm not going to stop.
I'm not going to stop talking about those things just because of the majority of you are just too
bone-headed to understand them, or just too terrified of death, too much of bunch of
pussies. Anyway, it says, the weekly magazine edition of the Washington Post is that according
to a national survey, many Americans already say they'll be talking to God when the year
2000 dawns. Maybe they mean, the survey found 36% of those individuals say they'll be
praying more than usual to usher in the new millennium. 27% say they'll seek spiritual
guidance, and 25% claim they'll go to church more often on our after December 31, 1990
young. The survey also showed that generation X late 20s, early 30s are significantly more
likely than elderly people to believe the new millennium is significant from a religious standpoint.
Oy! 34% of generation Xers believe this compared to the late 22% of people over 60.
Not surprisingly, southerners are more likely than people living elsewhere in the US to discuss
the new millennium at church. Yeah. And is Barney, the atheist or whoever he really
is, says it should be out! percent in all categories, obviously. I mean we're changing the
date on a calendar. OG, I tear this up, somebody might need this. We're changing the
date on a calendar. And as George pointed out, which I've never read you thought about
before, until year 2001, we're not in the next millennium anyway, still a 20th century.
I want you to stop and think about something, okay? When you talk about, when you count in
tens or in hundreds, okay? You don't count the number zero, do you? No!
No! You started one. So counting in numbers, whether it's years, whether it's
eggs, whether it's roses, whatever it is, it starts with one, it ends with ten.
The next ten starts with eleven. Are you following? I mean I know I'm, this is terrible
and don't blame me, blame George. He's the one who pointed this out to me a couple of weeks ago. I never
gave it much thought. There was no year zero. There was no year zero. The 21st century
doesn't start till year 2001. That'll be the first year of the 21st century. Does anybody
talk about that? No! Because there's a lot of this other height going on. And has to do
with all these computer chips, you know, for the year 1900 is both a 2000, that's a
computer thing. It has nothing to do with what century it is. Oh boy! I hate to break the
news to all those Y2K people, but their big movies coming out this summer and it's not
going to phase anybody anyway. Because that's always what the American people say. Don't
confuse us with the fact, mister, okay? That's the American f**king way. That's right. The 21st
century don't start till the year 2001. That's the first year of the 21st century. Just
like ten is the last number of the first group of ten. It's not zero through nine. So how
am I saying? Do they understand what I'm talking about? No! First not! Because I'm peeing on
there for OG or confusing us with the facts again. We hate you for that. Yeah, I know. Like
all that God bullcrap. And like dying. Oh no! Don't get too deep present. Boy! Okay, like I've
always said, what you see is most definitely not what you get. If you don't believe me to stop and
think about Ricky Martin for 20 seconds. It's far enough away from lunch. What you see is definitely
not what you get. Whether you're looking on top on the surface or on the bottom. Eight minutes
after 11 at 560 WQA. If he needs money, we're 80. All for men. Oh!
