Now, Neil Rogers on Sports Radio 560 QAM.
If you blow too much, you're in trouble.
The Beatsy and Beatsy beat the masterhouse and thus my head is you know.
He's up here, oh, so the cabalado, so they're gonna let him go.
My dad loves me all, he needs me very soon, get it up to Mama.
I tell you, he's the one who beat it.
You'll never hear him have me.
I tell you, I'll have to yell.
All right.
I tell you, I'll have to yell.
Yeah, it's a little bit on the slowest side.
You know, if we're in the Christmas work, detect this, says John Vanet sexually assaulted.
Oh my God.
He liked that.
What was it, Christmas this year?
It'll be two years.
I do believe so.
John Vanet Ramsey appeared to have been repeatedly sexually assaulted before the night she was killed.
The first police detective on the scene said in an interview broadcast on Wednesday.
Former Boulder Detective Linda Arnt also said there were serious problems with the police investigation, including a failure to question the parents of the girl six immediately after her body was found.
I don't know why a lot of things weren't done in this case.
I don't know why she said on ABC's Good Morning America.
Arnt said the girl appeared to have been repeatedly sexually assaulted before the night of her death.
So I think that if we're going to be logical, we have to assume that this intruder, the one who killed her, just kept breaking into the house over and over again.
And assaulting her.
And nobody had noticed.
Isn't that logical based on the way the investigation has gone?
It was the same intruder.
It wasn't mommy or daddy or brother Burke.
I would say to George before the show this morning, I think just to be safe, just to be positive that we get the killer.
What the other two is have one of those triple decars, you know.
Have an electric chair and put mommy and daddy and a brother, brother Burke, in like side by side and fry all their ass.
And that would be pretty damn sure.
No, it's like when you have some kind of a tumor and they remove all these surrounding tissue, just to be sure that you get the malignancy out.
So it only took like almost two years to figure this out that she had been repeatedly sexually assaulted before the night of her death.
And thank God that we have consistent American justice and that a guy who's got a lot of money like John Ramsey can't, you know, postpone the inevitable.
Or maybe it won't even be inevitable because by now I mean they contaminated so much of the evidence.
Let's start working on the Lindbergh baby thing they had a piece on CNN about that last night and they said absolutely nothing.
Does anybody with a brain really think that Bruno Hopman killed that baby?
No, of course not.
But it's only 60 years later so why should we worry about that now?
There's another case where they contaminated all the evidence.
Brilliant police work in America, no question about that.
And on the same page right above that story in this morning scum Sentinel, another one of these isolated incidents.
God there's so more than many of these damn things.
In the church archdiocese sues the frocked priest San Francisco Catholic arts diocese of San Francisco is filed a suit against Patrick O'Shea.
A defrocked Roman Catholic priest who was also been accused of molesting altar boys and other children.
Oh, anybody believe that crap?
No, no, I never heard of such a thing.
The lawsuit accused O'Shea former pastor of holy name of Jesus church of embezzlement and fraud and demanded the return of $252,000.
Longing fifty dollars.
O'Shea would open ostensibly legitimate church bank accounts then channel money to his own use buying property and paying debts while falsifying financial reports to the art stiases to lawsuit lends.
O'Shea was permanently stripped of his priestly duties in 1995 following numerous allegations that he had sexually molested boys.
I mean like that.
People fact in the church.
Day after day after day and you know something a whole lot of you people out there listening to me right now you keep subsidizing this bull crap.
That's the best part of it.
You keep going there because you've been brainwashed.
Yeah.
You know one of the one of the most tragic things I've ever seen in my life.
Did you see the how much of the story did you see after the shootings last night?
And I'll be honest with you.
The gun lobby you people can be real grateful to hurricane Floyd okay you ought to kiss the ground for hurricane cliff Floyd because this shooting and it was only seven people like that shot and killed.
So why should they be getting much news coverage anyway and I'm gonna say let's say seven.
That's all not a big story so it's getting like almost no coverage now because they're hucking away on hurricane cliff Floyd.
Which we already know is you know a lot of wind a lot of rain up the northeast and a lot of heavily populated cities filling New York Boston etc but you know that's the weather.
The weather story not a star where seven people got murdered so at any rate one of the most pathetic things I think I've ever seen.
Although of course now we're becoming desensitized also the teenagers on stretchers who've just been shot we see that a lot you know.
Here's some more teenagers coming out on stretchers they just been just blood all over they've just been shot again because it's the American fucking way.
But anyway then they're showing this one thing a million times there's this one kid he comes on these huggins in desperation sprays oh you've got to turn it a lot that's the only hope you've got to turn to the Lord.
Of course the interesting part of this and maybe some of you believers out there some of you people are so much better than I am obviously it will be in the kingdom of heaven with Jesus.
You can explain to me this was in a Baptist church this was one of those Wednesday night we around the somebody can also explain what this thing is where they around the pole what they're doing with their pole.
Yeah and here they were praying it was a prayer service.
And once again God screwed up he's too busy inflicting what was the other thing they just had typhoon somewhere over there in the Pacific and we got this hurricane another one the dirt behind it.
And he's too busy inflicting all kinds of horrendous damage on the mankind he don't have time to be answering prayers of people who are about to get shot.
Maybe they were praying to go ahead and faster how come I barely hear you there's something is this overhead again it's good everybody comes in here at night and pop you some out of this.
Yeah even though there were supposedly not going to be coming in here but again we don't we don't count for very much that's why we have this horse ball studio.
And as you accurately pointed out yesterday that's why they have an 800 contest line for the rest of the station but we don't have any 800.
No it's not for the rest of the station. What do you mean by that it's only for the contest.
I understand that the other talk lines are you know no I understand they also don't have an 800 line because they're also on and for my or some of the shows and also can't get calls tool free from those people plus of course all the millions of people listening around the world on the internet to our sports show.
And the five or ten might be listening to what right can't call.
See don't start off on a sour note this morning we got too many terrible horrible things going on already and you're starting on a sour note bitching about the state of the art studios that Greg Reed builds.
Tells wrong with you man.
Mel content professional bitcher complainer whiner that's why we listen by the way we like it thank you.
Just the way it is baby another mass shooting and I got to think here with Jose lamb beaten Rick Sanchez and the endkins that I got that.
Jimmy Johnson still bitching about American Ireland I scored a Jimmy let them have it baby because American blows they suck.
Let them have it and you know something they're going to keep flying American and every once in a great while when I absolutely have to I'm going to keep flying American and so all the rest of you because you got no choices.
That's the wonders that deregulation did for us.
So in every industry broadcasting airline we got monopolies you know we have this alliance and that alliance and what that basically means is there about five or ten companies that run the whole goddamn world.
If you don't want to do business with them just crawl into a hole somewhere because you're out of business.
Thank you very much nice going thank God we live in a country where we don't believe in the not police.
9 minutes after 10 at 560 WQ and his already have a homosexual relationship with me also I might as well have one with you too.
All right.
He started out a regular guy who joined the directories and made me ultimately sacrifice and racing celebrity father to in this.
I'm holding.
As time went by his early need compromise his choice it's down the way to get really by all three young boys.
Oh.
It was happy and gay till he got close by some title.
Then the Vatican says everyone else and he didn't have to go to jail.
I'm going to go to jail.
10 15 at 560 WQ don't miss tonight again of course another chapter in the ongoing CBS special Dan Rather tries to get pneumonia.
I mean you really have to wonder about this it's reached the point now whether you don't know what it will happen.
Here is a you know I like Dan Rather I watch them watching CBS even news for years and always will.
Far superior to a guy with a speech defect on NBC and far superior to the very stuffy and pouring Peter Jennings.
But the fact is that Dan Rather now at last night he's out there again getting himself just soaking wet the rain pouring down his head.
If they would have had him like standing under an awning somewhere if they would have had an umbrella somebody holding an umbrella.
Which is the way they used to do it we still would have been impressed okay.
Dan could be sitting in the warm studio in New York but instead he wants to get right to the meat of the matter and he's on there for CBS evening news for 25 minutes last night.
Getting soaked in the rain pouring down this head then I'm channel surfing later on.
And here's my good buddy and he's got Dan on there again for another hour.
Any standing out there not inside not under a porch not inside a motel with the other camera show what's going on outside with the rain and the wind.
No he's there in Wilmington North Carolina and the rain is just pouring down all of his head and he's an old man trying to get pneumonia on your TV set.
Then they got one of the correspondence on CNN which they just showed again for the 500th time because of the amusement factor not because of the news factor.
This guy's in Jacksonville North Carolina.
The tape was it made at 704 this morning.
They keep showing that in the upper left hand corner you see what time it really happened live and they've shown it 400 times since because like I said the comedy effect is so great this guy's about ready to get blown away.
The wind and the rain and he's hanging on and it's moving him several steps to his right and he's just barely keeping his balance and hanging out of this microphone.
I wouldn't be surprised if I was on child shows up and starts bitching him out.
And don't you understand what they're doing they're insulting all of your intelligence that's what they're doing.
They're saying oh you're really going to be impressed with us because our guys are out there practically getting blown away.
As if you'd be somehow less informed or less impressed if their guys were like other under an umbrella or like in the truck somewhere you know just showing us what's going on outside without them being in the middle of it.
Oh yeah look at that there's Charles Z. We out there in a rain is pouring down his yellow Shmata are we impressed no.
No. Your bunch of silly people your people in the media I'd say like 95% of you are all silly people your bunch of lunatics your crazy people.
And like I said this this story it just vanished.
The story about the mass shootings at this Baptist church in Fort Worth, Texas it just disappeared.
I was watching when they broke in on CNN last night and I had the story and then I'm flipping around on the small dish and on the big dish and I don't know anymore about it now 12 hours later than I did then.
But like I said it was only seven people you know probably mostly kids dead teenagers were used to that because it's the murk in vukin way.
So when am I getting back to Jose Lambby in the South Florida insider getting to the meat of the matter as he says while trying to lose weight channel seven Miami hype myster Rick Sanchez over a to that landed him in the hospital.
I was stupid the anchor admitted it was a good lesson he was stupid is that a bulletin no we already know that Rick Sanchez tells insider he started the Atkins diet last month.
The M.O. all you can eat of meat cheese eggs and fat that stay away from carbohydrates and sugar Sanchez did that especially the all you can eat part.
It was like two states in one sitting Sanchez and on Wednesday while trying to put together a meal order weightlifting machine then I throw a huge deal cutlet on the grill.
On August 27 he came down with a back pain and was hospitalized diagnosis a gallstone until the mishap the five foot nine yet five nine maybe maybe on still tease five nine I told you say he is about four six.
I think it's about three eight Rick Sanchez you know on on tippy toes until the mishap the five foot nine Sanchez had lost four pounds.
Hey you're in more pounds baby and another rate in the hospital.
Now he's at one hundred eighty two pounds and he's hired a nutritionist to put him on a state of God of protein shakes I get the shakes just watching Rick.
Yeah although I was very excited a couple of nights ago when he was out there on the edge of the bay standing on the edge of the bay with the Otis Reading.
Oh it was beautiful just come on somebody give him a little push a little helping hand.
They would have got a 90 share they could have showed that thing over and over again everybody in this town would have been glued to channel seven.
Showing them toss in wiki tiki into the drink and Rick Sanchez to.
So there you go he's on the atkins died you notice by the way to tremendous response we got this morning because of another shooting in her seven people that probably mostly kids all the way to them they don't care where was God would somebody like to tell us that.
Some of your religious nuts out there who are so much better than we are.
And of course you know that like I said the gun nuts are so grateful for hurricane clip Floyd.
And for the way the media has just dropped this other story is if hurricane clip fluid is the only thing going on in the world.
I mean I realize first of all it's now a category two a week category two and there's a lot of rain and it's going to be flooding and it's windy and it's not a pretty thing but it's just a shadow what went by us down here that we just missed by an eyelash.
It's just a vague resemblance to what we had down here.
And the fact that seven people got murdered again with the gun now we don't want to do that too much because then we'll get people all upset again especially in our eight times.
And you know it's kind of interesting coincidence because I got my new news week yesterday and a couple of weeks ago news week had a front page story America under the gun that I talked about August 23rd special report.
And they've needless to say gotten visions and visions of letters most of them from the gun huggers because those people they will write they will call they will facts those people are it's like a religion speaking of religion it is a religion the gun huggers yeah.
And some of these letters to the editor they all sound the same to they all sound the same like they're you know quoting each other quoting from propaganda for example.
James M. Shaw Salt Lake City writes to news week I'm a lifelong gun owner having been raised in the West in a culture that teaches responsibly ownership and handling of guns and have never seen any of the negatives you decry in your cover story.
In response to your misbegotten agenda I bought another rifle another handgun in many boxes of ammunition and said a nice fact check to the NRA.
Please consider your wrong headed views on the subject that letter right there that is the definitive letter from the gun huggers of America from the crazy people this is their religion and then make up air be kind of stir in fact where's the one about to trusting the government there's another one of these that they're just a whole series of these things.
Oh yeah here we go the issue of guns is not about recreation but about rights in the past our government has created gross violations of human rights such as concentration camps for Japanese Americans and will like the boy I thought is just so to just had some guns you know.
And will likely do so again at some point in the future inspired by the founding fathers I believe that private ownership of military quality firearms military quality firearms helps the two government abuses.
A registration scheme in addition to being of questionable use and stop in crime would facilitate the easy confiscation of firearms by a government that decides it no longer trust the people.
It is near common sense that a totalitarian or police state cannot maintain control if air be good citizen can buy high quality firearms how about tanks huh how about neutron bombs every good American should have a neutron bomb at least couple.
At the very least our gun law provides a barometer for our other freedoms if freedom starts being stripped away obviously the second amendment will be the first to go as long as we have it will still likely have the others says Ben Rogers and Auburn Alabama Alabama.
How do you like that paranoid and delusional irrational and making air be excused under the sun why we have this barbaric slaughterhouse of a country that you all come to accept because obviously nobody.
It's a very dangerous about this again just like the last time it happened and the next time it's going to happen and the times before that it doesn't make any difference how many young people are old people or anybody else they blow away you will have come to accept it.
And let's take a look at Dan out there in the rain again don't he look cute.
Man I just I don't understand you people at all I just don't get it.
And like I said I can always happen the gun nuts they're the ones they're writing their letters like the I mean the one letter that this just most of the hostility of this guy and this guy's got a lot of weapons by the way.
In response to your misbegotten agenda I bought another rifle another handgun and many boxes of ammunition and set a nice patch check to the NRA that will learn you to put stuff like that your god damn commie magazine.
Isn't that beautiful that's the American response to the fact that the crazy people all over the place of God guns and every time they get pissed off they kill a whole bunch of people including kids.
5 6705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line here's our one call a mobile and point and V chill out.
I just made myself six my something thinking about all that meat and cheese and eggs and Rick's hands is a stomach.
Yeah exactly I just have one little illustration of what you're talking about as far as the news big headline the big picture of Floyd and the big devastation where nobody was hurt.
And they have one house that lost its roof in the Bahamas and got full of your hurricane and then a little one sentence caption which you have to go you have flip back to page 15 a yeah it says.
I'm like you know it's not news anymore because it's not going to harm us you know like a lot of people are probably thinking that this other is right behind you know and they buried the story.
Because they want they want to talk about destruction and and have your god interest.
Sure of God that's why God couldn't answer the prayers of these Baptist in Texas and for worthwhile that he's to be decreting all these storms all over the place.
The biggest issue we have in this country I agree with you down control I get really guns okay pal thank you see you coming bastard.
5 6705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line let's get the gun hungers on the phone come on give us your propaganda give us your crap about how we would just enforce the existing laws yada yada yada yada you know chapter in verse we know it all by heart.
