Sport Radio 560, LWQAM, Miami Fort Lauderdale, presents the Neil Rogers Show.
You dropped a Neil called 560-750-560 toll free, per day to Bradford, more pound 560 on
your cell phone.
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers, or anyone else on the show do not necessarily
reflect those of WGQAM, deeply read acquisitions or the fees of Rochester.
For the menow, Neil Rogers on the Sport Radio 560-2AM.
Well, I do.
You fast, dude.
How are you doing today?
Fine.
I wanted to take over a little segment here of Phil Schell if I could, because we were,
and I mentioned this to you when I called you originally, first of all, Henry Barrel
sends us regards, not that I've talked to Henry since.
I'm Ann Henry.
Henry sends us regards, Cheryl sends her regards to you.
That's great, Cheryl's the work on that.
Yes, she is.
My God, you'll be, you'll get an associate security there.
I'm not going to tell her that.
Okay.
I'm not going to tell her that.
God.
We, frankly, Larry, were a little bit, Jacob the back, I guess, is the best way to put it,
by comments you made to Coach Shula on your program.
My understanding was it was Friday evening.
Well, I was taken back when I had two different friends call me.
On, I think there was one call Thursday night, one call Friday, when it was learned that Donald was going to retire.
And they both said, if you heard your already a station, I said, no, I worked there 20 years with the organization,
never to do the dolphins.
They said, they're creaming and the deaths.
So, to me, I was there at the study school, maniacs are calling in and saying personal things about them.
They're vilifying them and there's a guy in the morning looking at them, not the most,
he should be out of coaching and he's too old and a lot of guy criticizing the way he looks.
So, when I heard that, two different people, what I said to Don was, I heard that the station I worked at,
and you worked at, because Don and I did a show together every day on WIO Day 3rd.
So, it was rapid, you and he said, he had, all he said, well, I'm just finishing.
Then he said he hadn't listened to talk radio in two years, but that he heard about.
Well, so if I'm wrong, tell me well.
Well, first of all, we were not personally attacking Coach Hula.
We certainly, we do a talk show here as you do. We have several.
What we did do and any talk show would do, certainly relative to a story of this kind of local import,
was invite our listeners to call and voice their opinions.
The host had no personal opinions about the show.
So, Neil Rogers, quite frankly, if you speak of Neil Rogers or Rick and Suds are in the shows here,
had met them, but the most blowing things to say about Coach Hula in his retirement.
Now, why?
Neil Rogers has something glowing to say about someone.
Neil was on, the day the retirement was announced.
Neil said, I'm talking about before the retirement.
I'm talking about after the retirement, the whole city of Florida.
I can assure you this.
What about before the retirement?
I can assure you this.
There was nothing personal in any negative state that made by Neil Rogers.
What kind of criticisms were that?
That he was that he had his coaching ability had begun to slump that the game perhaps was passing and buy,
that it was time to make room for a coach.
And as you know, the popularity of Jimmy Johnson here is well.
I wrote in my column three years ago that Jimmy was kind of coming coach Miami and Jimmy told me that and that was.
He'll fasten just as high too.
Let me say this.
There's a way you can do it in a way you cannot do it.
Now, you can encourage callers to vilify.
I've been doing this a long time.
I am staring at it.
I started.
I know that you were with our radio station.
What are you?
And so I'm out of do talk show.
Crazy puppets.
And I know how you can storm up a crowd.
And the people who told me I have faith in.
So you'll tell me that Neil Rogers praised him.
I was shocked.
I wouldn't even bother you.
I wouldn't even bother you with a phone call where I can't.
I don't know.
I'm going to ask after a time that everybody's asking for a man.
That's below.
I'm talking about before coach Shula.
A number of years callers personal or insightful.
The callers, some of the callers may have been some.
And they were.
What did you say to them?
We got rid of them very quickly to be perfectly honest with you.
You know, I know.
You're inciting calls.
We're off the air right away.
They were off the air right away.
And I apologize to Mr. Rogers for his fairness.
Thank you.
The rest of the staff and the two people who told me.
I must have been here.
I got to tell you Larry.
I take what I do very seriously.
Larry, he's a little emotional.
I'm sorry.
I take what I do very seriously.
And to have our radio station billified, done next.
Now hold on a second, Bob.
Your station.
I was on.
How long have you been doing that?
I've been here since 1992.
Okay.
I was in Miami two years ago.
The worst talk radio I've ever heard in my life with my W.A.R.D.
The worst.
You see, it's comments like that that I think are very unfair.
Do you want an opinion or not?
Do you think Neil Rogers is a good talk show host?
I think he's the best in the system.
I think he's the worst I've ever heard.
I think he's the best in the business.
Well, if you're proud of him, if you're crying, of course.
Neil Rogers has been vilified.
What would I need to do here?
We're tense going.
Larry, can I get on Neil with a cry with each other?
All right, Larry.
Can I jump in for a minute?
This isn't saying.
Well, I've got a no-general manager here who's trying to Bob.
If you can't handle this, I can do this or whatever.
I can't.
I never heard of worst things.
All right.
I think that's badly unfair of you and I would demand an apology for that statement.
For having an opinion?
No.
For saying that this is the worst talk radio you've ever heard.
You know the influence that you have over people.
Is the worst talk radio I've ever heard?
I demand an apology for that statement.
I will not give it to you.
I'm not going to do it that.
I'm not going to do it that.
I'm not going to do it that.
All right.
H 후보 boy…
H 후보 boy…
But, no, I still have to watch myself welcome back.
answers up for three of a power play gone
twenty million dollars each year to support many of the region's major sports venues the tennis crowd
the center at crandon park the homestead motor sports complex
yeah what a scam that was the homestead baseball stadium
how those Indians doing by the way down there
Miami arena another white elephant
national car Yanta center and american airlines arena which is not a construction
as they split the Mickey to the public again
using more tax dollars to help help build facilities for billionaires not
millionaires but multi billionaires whose business is taking tourists out of
this town to make sure they don't spend their money here
nice going air steward and friends over there at the hotel association
just say John Henry new people air the hero do you think that by putting this
on the front page of only the business section and keeping it quiet
this should have been on the front page of the front section of the newspaper
anybody any journalism any kindergarten kid taking journalism 101
knows that
the big big-ass story that the hopper
here for yesterday right here on this radio station that was nice going
hopper and thank god for us here at qaim let me tell you between the penny sales
fact that they try to slip for over on you and listing that they're going to
try to slip you the Mickey again so that this boring little twerk john henry
can pull away in high pina I mean it's as transparent as the day is long
I must be crazy I must be now yeah you are mister
this whole PR campaign oh yeah Wayne don't own the team anymore everybody knows
we all hate him and he's a prick anyway and everybody despises him and his
it face but now it's a nice guy who really likes baseball he never
stole a freight train and he really cares about us yeah
yeah right what a phony baloney campaign that is
in that lie you talk about liar liar your dio ashes on fire
that lie about well you know he'll build it himself yeah but now the deal is
if the public won't put up the money to build a money once his four hundred
million dollar stadium well he'll only build a twenty five thousand
seed stadium which won't generate enough revenue to have a competitive team
and nobody'll show up so it'll be the point anyway and so then uh... got
he you know they'll forget about it what's the point
I mean you if anybody I mean we got a lot of stupid people here no
corrected about it but if you think you're fooling anybody with that well
I must be crazy I must be not exactly as long as I live I'll never forget
seeing him with a fat tub of crap Jay Randolph sucking his ass there on
the saturday on a whanny on the on that marlin whatever that
orpaste is they got on there oh yeah it's really good to be and this
this little guy's about three foot two like he's like a little puchin like
rumpel still skin and he's sitting there in the chair like looking at with this
little one skinny face in his little slits for eyes
he's got slits for eyes and for brains okay rhymes with slits
and so here once again they try to pull a fast one on you keep this quiet
as though it's only that caveman neo-roggers and maybe fat hank had a couple
other sour pushes on ql and they're the ones that are peeing on our parade don't
realize how important it is they have a baseball state even time to the
quality of life to our community
see if we had like I said the other day some real leadership even not
forget about politicians just even in terms of a real newspaper
that would have the guts to come out and tell it like it is instead of for
whatever reasons both the hero and some sent and will always seem to be
pretty much in bed together why they're so hysterically in favor of this
thing I mean why not no sweat off of their ass
and the hero especially counting on everything everything that we build is
gonna be right down there by one hero plans to do you know goose up their
property values to make people want to go downtown is anybody here want to go
downtown no will they ever go downtown no no
and let me say it again construction of the Miami arena that's another
they're supporting the Miami arena is anybody that we know playing there
anymore no how about the madadors no look at this I'm giving away nine
period this this shows beyond a shadow of a doubt even the
freeloaders don't want these and look at that one just dropped off
haha I was in the middle of that sentence and one call dropped off there's no
interest in that here I played a little hockey highlight dude that's
probably the end of the show for today because it's something that nobody
cares about it would be like I do in a whole week's worth of shows on
swing clubs you know there's more people go to one panther game then go to
all the swing clubs in this town in a five-year period put together which
don't mean I'm not in favor of them but it's just narrow-casting man like
talking hockey here nobody cares there's no interest none zero zibbidi
doda it would know jigs McDonald from old McDonald
EIEIO EIEIO
right but we got to keep digging into your pockets boys and girls and
squeezing all the money out of there that we can't and the tourist too and by
the way very interesting study in 1995 before
constructed by me arena a Miami-Dade County study revealed that
less than half of one percent of overnight visitors go to sporting events
here less than half of one percent but let's just keep
goosening up the taxes on them until we get them high enough we can see if we
can drive some of them away we already drove all the spring breakers away
you know right and of course the frogs thank God we grow most of them away
because of that cheap but worthless Canadian loony right so let's see if we
can't drive some more like maybe a few English speaking tourists if we
have any drive them away
Friday you best good

how many years have I been the only one in America to tell you very accurately
by the way how much money have you got and I like Bob Barker
I got nothing against him especially the old part that's getting late as much
as he is you got to respect that but but Jesus Christ how much is enough Bob
go save some god then furry animals again which is what he was going to be
doing in front of listen to this Barker 75 is admitted to a hospital
Thursday suffering from fatigue I can't imagine why
he went to the emergency when George Washington University
hospital in DC when he didn't feel quite right before meeting with some
members of congress about those furry animals again he's trying to save
he was in good condition expected to leave the hospital today he was in
Washington lobbying on behalf of a bill that would protect animals that are
part of entertainment acts like uh... L. Harry elephante and some of
those others I mean you know I respect what he does for the animals that's
wonderful and what he's doing to some of those broads there on the prices
but Jesus Christ wrap it up okay hang it up they'll have a big award show
thanks for 600 years of great entertainment and uh... you're silver hair and I'll
look it out of here go play golf man he's suffering from fatigue he taped
spy you know how they do that five hour shows in one day so a lot of those people
they say oh he won't need work once every uh... once a week yeah but they tape
five one hour shows which doesn't just take by the way five hours I hate to
break the news to you can take grueling exhausting especially for an old
fart like him
but we're supposed to feel sorry for Bob anybody feel sorry no
you mark my words we won't get one call from you anybody in this audience
today the her jigs michael on the station last night you watch

kipper just because that crazy peter lenders so five six seven oh five sixty
pound five sixty on the eighteen t wireless line not that i want to sound like a
big shot because gary cernor gave me these tickets to give away by the way and
gary had the bris for a sunlight and even buff lindsay with her to see what it
looked like but nevertheless
and these are the the first the great tickets i got here row one section one
thirty three row one seats ten and eleven or nine whatever it is these these
they have got a face value of a hundred and five bucks a piece this one
a pair of course at the end of these we got a few nosebleeds in the upper deck
the most of these are pretty good seats but nevertheless there's no interest
how can the interest in something you don't understand and let me say it again
christina moron you're as much as responsible i mean you talk about taking the
most exciting thing in the world and making the next to sex and making it
boring that's what this guy did for six years on this radio station
like i said thank god for my close personal buddy jigs mcdonald at the
her name i scored bill tory and by the way quit wearing those polo shirts
people are still laughing at your gigantic breast okay
even britney spears is jealous here's a mobile in point and v chill out
neal my god i had a lot of those break yeah i want to tell you a quick
jewish bubble my story i'm getting married next week to a jewish woman
fire by a rabbi yeah well i went to another service in the rabbi was talking about
the new uh police uh russia shana calendar and he basically said that it was all a
bunch of uh all correct it was a bunch of bull crap he said what they did was as
they they decided to make the calendar and how they came up with 5760 was
accounted backwards how do i how they do that well and look at if you read from
right to left it figures you're going to come backwards too well that's true but
anyway the rabbi is going to marry us we had a hard time finding one because i'm not
jewish correct exactly so the first one that would take 400 bucks
hey he marry us i thought that was the most hilarious thing
let her go larial maria cheaper than that don't be trusted out he's a rabbi part time on weekends
yeah but the funny thing was that there's actually rabbis out there that are not official
rabbi i know that so i couldn't be married
and i think you know you stabbed at one on the show all the time the white he would marry anybody
he would use very damn easy he was the one we were going to go to but the mother law said
well he's not an official rabbi oh i'm not an official jew so what the hell difference does
it make yeah i just thought that was absolutely hilarious as far as the tickets are we
at least i feel more jewish than you are anyway not much more than that i'm a few in the
region would only have to do with death no i'm probably more jewish than you are because i go to
temple okay like i said better you anyway anyway far as the tickets are not going to

yeah i was calling him for the cancer tickets no recent court rulings concerning the
sexual orientation of scuff masters has made it nearly impossible for the average parent to know
what kind of scouting experience their son can expect but one organization has a reason to make
things perfectly clear the gay scouts okay true time to set up camp i didn't did you get 10
for the day scouts will teach your son the art of self preservation in the wild
i'm in a natural life how are we going to get the fire going that's okay we can make our own
body heat when your son joins the gays scouts he'll hear late night ghost stories and when the
severed body was found he was wearing a ton of caran on some with clashing the pelt that have
been out of season since labor day so if you want your son to bond with other like-minded young men
have him join the gays scouts today where our motto is
he prepared to strike your stop
ten forty five and five sixty wqm we got hanket too we got the jimmy johnson show the jimmy we
could be special johnson show at five o'clock at six we got the steed goldstein from the national

hockey tickets the boy sucking around for the free tickets not hey how you doing not have a great

circumstances unless they're pitched pissed off convention nicoca kay uh pineapple ed at one day
but other than that they got nothing to say to me but if i got something for free all of a sudden we got
we got an eighty-year in-woman or nearly we had about a one point five year in-woman got every guy

he's got some freedom away and all of a sudden we just had a radio accident we happened to be listening
even though those two guys those two lives used on 2800 on the dollar very entertaining
is what the rumor is in our sales department down to and you know something they would find
that entertaining because that's a sports station see alleged that's a real man's sports station
that's a place that they ought to be working not here by the way i just looked at the schedule for
money it looks to me like Hank oh if he's taking you i'm kipper off he'll be a professionally Jewish

here's Kendall hello Neil yes sir her jigbob night and he sounds like he has a hopper to throw but
i love him he's good you know he's good with muller yeah they they were good uh i was pretty excited
i was pretty psyched about it because i listen with an open mind and as you know i've ripped
him pretty good because he isn't a little guy but he was he was good and of course especially in
retrospect 50,000 times better than his predecessor who was the piece of crap he didn't hyperventilate
during you know all those fights at the first period no and he actually described the game right
he's supposed to do hey but that's not why i was calling you i was trying to call you yesterday
when you're talking about guns yes i was a guy called you two weeks good i was flying delta to
Rome right you ripped me for well i ripped you for what for flying delta to Rome well i mean you know
what can i tell you i just wanted to relay you my my experience or the main difference i've had
there it was my first time in Italy and i'm very well traveled in the United States and when i get
to any of the city of the big city delay or Chicago whatever i always try to find out you know
where he's to go and what are the bad areas take the cab everywhere um besides the beauty of Rome
and the swindler in the history of it every night late night we went in there's a huge park at the
end of the event right we just walked around the park and i just had this general feeling of
safety right i just didn't feel even the bombs looked peaceful uh-huh i mean it's a central park
i feel like i could get killed i just felt safe for some reason right only because of what i
heard you say and i had that feeling that's how it is all over most of us in your many places that
i've ever been coping hay again the Stockholm Amsterdam the Berlin-Colon Rome Milan uh florick you
don't feel like you're in danger i loved it well i could get over there more often exactly
well i'll gladly suck around for some ticket next time fly alatalia though please
okay i'm talking to you alatalia alatalia sounds good to me okay they fly direct from my
any to roman non stop you didn't go non stop you probably had to go to norek or somewhere
still without the filly sing fly alatalia next time okay you got a pair of pal thanks hang on
okay line five to our good pies on there who just came back from aroma and didn't have any
complaints either by the way like that jackass they called a couple of weeks ago oh gee i was so
scared i didn't want you to have the cruise ship first of all when you start talking to people
that do a lot of cruise ship stuff you know you're dealing with assholes in the first place
with people that don't really know how to enjoy their vacation time i want to be captive prisoners
on a goddamn boat to nowhere somewhere you know you've only got so much vacation time most of us
so why would you want to waste a lot of it sitting out there on the open seas uh probably uh
like a prisoner on a ship with a bunch of people you can't stand in the first place
like that guy like the guy to call a few days ago was on a cruise ship i was all psychotic because
nobody spoke English and uh all the cubas that blah blah blah blah there you go pal another good
reason to stay off the cruise ships not to mention the fact that Mickey Harrison sucking a lifeblood
out of this town and that's why i hear a lot of things so much because they're so concerned about
our community great letter to the editor by the way i'll get to it a little later Lisa Versace
the Florida director of people for the mercenaries and my money free speech at risk in this morning's
here letter to the editor about those van van and also later on in this paper those van van
may play in Miami after all oh i don't know like that
where else in america would you have a controversy going on like this about whether a band from
another country can perform only in the banana republic baby only in Miami exactly
here's a mobile in Miami shores hello
talking to me yes sir sounds like you all right um i had a radio accident and i did hear a
portion of the broadcast last night yeah and my opinion was i thought i'd first i was listening to a
Phil Henry parody it was funny what do you mean by that well maybe i turned it in a bad time when
the fight was but you know first well gets in a fight which lasts about five seconds he's down on
the ice the whole thing just reminded me when i listened to Phil Henry do uh parodies on marlin
games the things sound like a parody on a hockey game are you sure yeah yeah i like it say the
nice thing is and i'm gonna go to the game tonight and the nice thing about having seasons tickets
is at least half the time you don't have to listen to it on the radio or watch it on tv okay thanks
anybody's to grow what he just said oh five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on it see
anybody if this was like a real sports town forget about hockey time we'd already had 600 people
saying oh my god what a breath of fresh air as opposed to that jackass we had the last six years
who wouldn't describe to us what was going on and where the puck was and we never had any idea what
was going on the game and half the game he was mumbling and trying to do sit down comedy even
during the regular season if this was a real sports town where anybody knew you know Joe Bowen from
Jimmy Bowen they don't know Mike Lang from Katie Lang i'll tell you that right now five six seven
oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line it's never ever gonna change i can keep
sitting here ringing my hands and getting upset about it am i gonna get upset about it oh no
because i've just to resign myself as a fact that that's the way it is hey we got Paul Vell
Brewer i was on vacation last year we excited about that who who what are you talking about
that was the best that was the tip off that was one of the i mean that was one of the really
clear clear i wonder what was the word i'm looking for crappy moments of my life yeah in other words
i could see exactly where i was at that point if i had any doubts a moment of clarity that's
what i was looking for i thought that's what you're putting your hair or that would you take when
you got allergies five six seven oh five fifty pound five fifty on the AT&T wireless line

has nothing to do with people having access to god oh he's a gun hugger what's he gonna say
in Texas he's going to let the lord or praise the lord and what not then the interview the
a pastor of that church yes and he actually i think he said something a little more coherent and
our government bush he said is a culture he said it's a culture and i think it's right he also said
last night which made me want to puked the same old usual religious crap about we shouldn't feel bad

on the 18t wireless line so the greater mimey and the beaches hotel
association the past of resolution yesterday and the last paragraph
being the most important one saying now be it resolved that the
greater mimey and the beaches hotel association through unanimous
action taken by its board of directors on thursday september 1619
yin-ni-n-yin is opposed to any initiative that would place any additional
bettax on hotels or expand the use of existing bettax
for the purpose of either building or operating a new baseball stadium in
mimey date county let's hear it
for the greater mimey and the beaches hotel association
and stew in the gantza mishpaha let's hear it for them
how do you say it again case you missed the beginning of the show
hank had the story yesterday before they even took to vote
they took to vote it was unanimous and instead of being on a front page of your
mimey hero today where every other ass sucking story is appeared by
Barry jackass and all her other flunkies about john henry and all the sites
and will it be this one will it be that one at tenor and so on instead of being
on the front page of the front section it's way down at the bottom of the front
page of the business section little story that almost nobody would have
seen unless somebody would have pointed it out on the air
unconscionable unconscionable if you ever had any doubts if you thought that
we exaggerated about the one-sidedness and the slanted news in the
hero just take a look at this the fact that they're trying again to pedal to
you just like they tried to pedal to you unsuccessfully
mayor pingas penny sales tax now they try to pedal to you john henry and let's
give him some more money and build another goddamn stadium for billionaires
oh that this would only be on the ballot they're trying to get on the ballot for
a next year year from november all i pray
here's a mobile and davie hello mobile and davie oh hi new y'all good morning how
are you great i listened to the broad cost last night and he did a nice job
i grew up with urban and galvan and he's good yeah well he ain't no uh he ain't no
Danny galloping he ain't no Danny galloping that's not here he ain't no Joe
bowl and he ain't no Rick Jenner ready ain't no uh uh
Fred Q6 but he would did a good job nice job yes i'd like to get your comments
uh i don't see any hope for the for the panthers this year their gold tending
it's suspect hopefully they'll finally uh i think the gold tending's the problem
and they've improved over last year and last year the gold tending wasn't the
problem the problem was poorest defense and like a goal scoring and a lack of
adventure right that's right i think they have an opportunity this year to make
a playoff towards others really hang on uh on on berets me
it hangs on with the berets stays healthy all year which is mandatory and number
two again and i heard Brian last night the spokesman he was going on again
about the youngsters in the organization and this is the and i you know
nobody's buying that anymore i mean i hope he's right but that's gotten so old
and so tired well hopefully it's interesting by the way that Steve
Washburn scored one of the goals against this last night for national
exactly well i would enjoy going to the game the other that's possible okay it's
possible sir thank you very much hang on
and meet the good news viewers okay let's give him a these okay
that's number three i'm sticking right over here on my left the your uh center
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line come on
as the cat got these people spunked they like i said really a sad commentary it's
really the tip off on just how much excitement and enthusiasm there is in this
town about filling a blank about anything not just the panthers not just about
some stupid exhibition game tonight but about anything
very very sad very disheartening it's like reaching it and just
tearing your kishtis out no wonder i'm thinking about taking off the Monday for
your own kipper which i think would be a great idea is anybody mentioned anything
about that no because i think i'm going to burn in hell if i work on Monday i
think i think i've reached my quota i think the Lord allows you to work
somebody young kippers in your life and after you've reached the quota if you
work one more than that's it you had it you're going straight to
do not pass go do not collect unemployment insurance
i think uh this could be a very fortuitous opportunity especially coming on a
Monday making for a nice three day holiday weekend would be nice a nice
Jewish three day holiday weekend here's a mobile and sunrise hello
Neil yes sir i wasn't sure i'd get deep um get beat for one no we had a tone i'm
on i'm on a mobile and i'm in the middle of like a monsoon down here in sunrise
there's a monsoon again in sunrise yeah oh yeah you're probably going to go on to a flood
no don't say that oh i'm not serious uh that fellow that called about two or three calls ago
that was one of the most self-righteous outrageous attitudes i've ever heard
which one where the benefit of having seized in tickets is that many less games he has to
listen to or watch on tv uh-huh that is so outrageous just like probably one of the people
that sits at the arena with a cell phone trying to make everybody see how important he
thinks he is probably standing at one of those people that stands up talking with friend three
sections away on another cell phone out raises i mean a real fan would we'd either want to watch
or listen or see again you're interested in your team you're interested in your players
out of the way and by the way jigs did a did a really nice job i wasn't a major
i owned a fan like my son's where so i didn't really have a chance to listen to him a lot in the past
but uh what a what a breath of fresh air for parents in the last kind we never realized how good
jigs was until christ uh-moron left uh-uh uh-uh he uh-he posted he really has a good memory for
fact obviously he did his homework he didn't just sit there and uh-and swab over again
he knows also also unlike christina moron he happens to be a great guy everybody here likes him
uh-ton already as opposed to christ moron who is a real obnoxious backstabbing jackass
that's right here and obviously he's gonna live down here not not up north right
well he already has a homebound in boca i think uh-he already had a place down here so he will be here
that's good i'm looking forward to enjoying him and i'd sure i could chance to go into tonight's game
okay you got it sir hey i appreciate it hold on and all the ships at sea too okay it's the number
forward i'm sticking right on top but okay why don't make sure this gets done right
why don't make sure we do it right five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T
while it's not you know something that's a good thing i got these nine pair tickets to give away
today because other than that i don't think we'd have any calls you know i'm talking about no that's
right just like yesterday trying to get people off their ass although i realize it's a hopeless
situation this thing with a gun deal and that you just uh-law at a loss for words you know there's
nothing to say anymore it's just a barbarian place and uh-there's nothing we can do about it
and then of course uh our wooden vice president was on air last night with my good close personal
don't need fifty dollars friend oh i'm telling you al it's just uh- astonishing how wooden
and you wonder why bushes like fifteen seventeen points ahead in the polls i mean at least he
shows a little sign that he might be alive not that he stands for anything good but nevertheless
he might be alive whereas our vice president i mean uh-winkin blicken and not off to sleep
to just uh-and he asked him a question about you know giving your forget about doing the cocaine
but how about uh-you know your grades in school and like and he stammered and his eyes uh-blinked
and winking and uh just answered a question okay just say something profound say something you
rip raw's p-roll and as say something but that's before the pressure was on before it's actually
running for anything nine minutes after eleven and five sixty wqm here and beat that gator meat
and
yeah i got
a no-hack
that's why we're up there all had
i tried
a direct
but i did this song at the pain of rent it's a remake
three to the same call
as
there goes my image
i get some mimic
oh fuck i don't know
this is a shortcut
just the way to feel the city
next time i do a monkey's track
yeah
it didn't take long
to do
as a song
to the copy
of the same
i guess you could say it in the counter
it's a remake
it's a great to sing
call
the
great to sing

so lesa vsachi the florida director of pickle for the american way rights free speech and risk it is an outrage for the city of mimey which has a lawsuit pending over the cancellation of the lowest van van concert
to rent out the facility to a counter demonstration
moreover the difference in city imposed cost for the two events is just plain discriminatory
los van van's promoter will be charged 33% more for the facility
and the police department also demanded $17,900
up front for security
that didn't even include fees for investigating bomb threats
$300 per threat or an edit charge of $8,510
if the police determined the need for a dispatch
this brigade 2506 have to shell out the same amount of concert supporters stage of protest
no
if not police officials must assume that concert supporters would never stage a threatening protest
why should los van van concert promoter debiohanian be penalized, penalized, and brigade
206 be rewarded for potential unruly and threatening protest by a small
fact of the exal community
i have encouraged peaceful protest by the exal community in this case however
mimey's mayor and commissioners are misusing their influence perhaps illegally
to advance the political agenda of a single constituency
free speech and legitimacy of our representative government are threatened
rights of Lisa Versace, Florida director of people for the american way
as once again is god damn banana republic
was on the verge of caving in but the good news is
the Cuban dance band los van van whose schedule mimey appearance next month had been cancelled
is not currently scheduled to play October 11th
according to when agreement worked out there is the between van representatives
the night center management and the aclu which of course had a stick there nose in there thank god
this was a victory for a first amendment printables in mind he said howard
Simon executive director of the Florida aclu which had threatened to go to court if the concert was not
rescheduled there's one possible snag los van van has until when did to complied with the federal regulation demanded by the city
proof that the band isn't making a profit and is only getting a prudium allowance
Thursday's agreement comes after a week of controversy that began when los van van's concert was announced last week
the performance of the band sparked a flurry of calls to Cuban radio stations in mimey city hall of course as usual
same old tired crap as the same old tired bunch of holios think that they can run every god damn thing in this town
which magazines we can sell at the airport same old crap only in the banana republic baby only in Miami
hey man nice going mad yeah think of Tommy yeah right
crazy old specs here's a lady in four lotterdale hello
yes I am good morning first I'd like to encourage you definitely to take you on the floor as the holiday
uh-huh I just want tickets well of course I would but I'd also like to tell you that I was also at hockey fest
yeah we didn't mind over two and a half hours meet Pavel Burry right one of the nicest players on our team
now do you speak in english or in whiskey in english in english
okay I have to tell you Chris Wells was flooded to be with him for signing and Chris showed up halfway through it
had a face on sort of like I don't want to be here
a long push yeah it was probably sitting up in the stand because he's got so much practice doing it
you know well I kind of feel bad for him wish him a good season this season why do you feel bad for him
because he doesn't get any recognition you know if we don't want him on the team then let's get rid of him
right here we resigned with another year yeah well I did we
well because probably when we traded we want to get something for him I mean you know
well I'd like to see the same thing happening with Rob Neemar
yeah first uh let's pack him a sandwich he's a good kid nice go on Robby we like you not goodbye you know goodbye
definitely go to goal last night Robby that fourth goal that temporarily put him ahead
well let's see a lot more of that during the beginning of the season then I doubt it I have the same feeling
mm-hmm I'd like to see a sentiment come in to work with Pavel that way he's not carrying the whole team on the shoulders this season
right uh also heard from my husband was busy getting autographs at hockey fest Trevor Kid attitude problem really rude to the kids
rude to the kid Trevor Kid was rude to the kid yes you must be kidding no and uh if you fell walking on the street
nail you'd say or does he look like he belongs in Florida long hair short I know what Trevor Kid looks like kind of a punk yeah
yeah yeah but he's not these better in Kirk Mark Lane I'll tell you that I agree
see we don't care if he's got a crappy attitude as long as he can play and it's like can he play
just like the dolphins they got all these criminals and so far they look like they're all going to be good so nobody cares
they're all forgot about their you know they're up their righteous attitude
and I have to tell you it's not the players fault for the mishaps at hockey fest I do have a friend who works for Panther land
and selling the kid you know all of the uh anthem materials
and it was on the inside at the last minute changing where people are supposed to be they were slaughtered to be in the main arena as well as signing autographs
yeah I heard the arrangements for the thing we're all screwed up they stuck that's what I heard I want to tell you who told me that but they stuck that's what I heard
and that's what I heard and a lot of people who do work for the arena are not Panther fans at all
don't know the players don't really care yeah so I have to give you there's a lot of defunct here well they got too
many glium working in your room that's a problem well they could hire me part time for a few sparsers too
okay you want tickets or what absolutely no okay now I got uh what have I got here what
what did I do with the real good ones that I give those away oh there they are no but you don't want those
here's some real good ones one 24 row row 12 uh yeah these are good okay hang on thank you now okay
there you go I don't want to give you the real real expensive ones I want to hold those out so much to have a couple of calls by
I knew them hey listen there's nothing wrong with stealing a little bit of the show here today thanks to Gary Sarner who's the boy headed as a brist last night
courses boys 14 but nevertheless better late than never
oh his boys in 19 I'm wondering why some of the people from here were showing up for that yeah I'm on the
phone with our program director yesterday discussing some very urgent business here at the station and all of a
sudden he like I said I got to go to that brist and I thought to myself typical QAM man you know whatever I'm
talking about he's listening out of one year but in the meantime they're doing their pop up I know he's
he's taking care of business that duck you know because I I call him yesterday and I finally put my
foot down he said get off your duck yeah he's all right it's not his fault don't be screaming at him
okay hang all of it's fine I do like screaming at him it's like an easy target but he's not the one that
puts a 13 minute breaks in a Hank Goldberg show can you imagine that I heard Hank went ballistic on
Wednesday I missed that which I would have paid admission to to witness the whole events Hank
was out of Chulis that a 13 minute break in the middle of his show and our general manager is suing
the fandom radio station down there like there see they're not the competition our sales department
they're the competition they're the ones we have to fight tooth and nail to keep the audience on
this radio station to avoid having 45 minute breaks but at any rate here's a mobile implantation hello
hey male yes sir how you would now I think that glory hole picture you got up there in a wall
is it pouring pardon me what is it I just I think that glory hole picture you got up on the wall
sorry about all the note background noise there glory hole picture yeah do you keep I think
your glory hole picture from the snow from all the yeah you set that for us so come right right
couldn't hear you too good because it's a real like wind tunnel in the background is it raining
is it raining there it was pouring rain I just I'm in Hollywood now but it was pouring down rain I
think the plantation acres is swan again oh again air every time it rains it's in the acres except
for the hurricane every time we get it right a rate that's a 50 you played about filling killer was
almost appropriate I just moved out of the house after 24 years really and yeah my son helped me
move and so we get some tickets to take him to the game tonight oh shameless you really are shameless
I know okay hold on thank okay give him these okay not the real good ones but good enough
oh man you people are something see it's a good thing we're only doing this like for the
second day two days in a row but only two days out of the year and the years got several months
to go yet four oh these people are unbelievable aren't they they come up with the stories that
haven't been invented yet here's a mobile in the homestead hello mobile in homestead hello yes sir
how you doing great yeah take a take Monday off yeah how do you like them the youth and hockey
you know Dennis Vicki fell down on the three-on-one
okay five six seven oh five sixty pop back 60 on the AT&T world signs anybody know what they'll
he was the money said no I don't know what they're he's talking about what language he's he was
he's speaking huh of course he wasn't homestead they're under a lot of stress there you know they
went through what Andrew seven years ago now we just had this other hurricane it brings back
flashback they're stressed out in homestead that's gonna excuse ain't it okay here's Delray
chill out hey deal yes sir I've been trying to keep my 13-year-old son interested in this damn hockey
team and they keep trading away the players he didn't know anybody so can't we just trade away the
Murray brothers that would be that would be a who'd hell would take him though I don't know
I don't know I think they could send them up the Columbus to the new team and get done no they got
done the cleanup they know they could bring Doug back no they don't want Doug back it's hard you
don't it's hard to keep these keep like my kid interested because they traded all of you know
like they get it he gets an emotional attachment to like Jovenovsky or somebody like that way any
special ed he isn't signed with Vancouver there's a whole bunch of guys who haven't signed yet I
mean a whole slew of guys who are holding out for real big money and so a special ed he's like
hanging out really yeah well but it's a show you how dumb he is yeah right as if he has the
skills to hold on but no I'm just thinking about you know then it's whole business about trading
away players the kids on the people they lose their emotional attachment to the team and then they
wonder why that you know they can't fill the seats yeah they're having a bitch of a time so
in season tickets I'll pick it up because who in the hell knows he's on the team I think I'll
bury they said six down one we got Ray Whitney and Pavel Brey and you know and you can you forget
yeah it's a good idea because who in the hell did they say there are six thousand unsold seats
for tonight's game so you would assume that let's see 19 minus six is the most season tickets we
could have would be 13 thousand which lasts you they had between I think 16 and 17 thousand and
maybe some of those tickets for tonight's game were bought by non-season ticket holders so it's
looking kind of grim as compared to last year and just like I predicted the novelty is already worn
off you know it was a new building and it was a breath of fresh air and it was a nice neighborhood
and so on and so forth but the quality crappy product they put out there last year didn't bring
everybody back and it's the Murray breath is right and everybody away and also not developing the
promising youngsters in the organization like Red Warner and some of the young veterans like
Stu Barnes and others you know they play great when they go someplace else but when they're here
they just in La La land right well that's the other point so maybe you can talk about youngsters
in the organization but if you can't develop them and can't make them play good then what's the
point and let's look at the Murray Brothers yeah that's the problem I agree I'll pack him a sandwich
yeah maybe we can get our good friend what's his name there were the submarine sandwiches to pack
him a salad all right well maybe if you would like to let me I will take my kid to the game tonight
okay hold on thanks Delray Beach let's give him these okay
no it's great I mean let's give him these five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty
on the 18 to wireless land I'm so sorry that I agreed to give these away I mean Gary Sarner
was trying to be a good guy and I appreciate that but I'm so sorry I did this am I sorry I did this
no no I'm not already killed almost two hours and especially with this audience with this
recalcitrant reluctant audience that no many how many people they shoot no matter what's going on
you know not one call by the way about this story about the way the hero buried this story
and about I mean here's your major newspaper forget about the Sun Sentinel I mean you think
this out for the ask anybody in the world what's the newspaper down here they'll tell you the
Miami-Herald so here's the alleged major newspaper in this market playing fast and loose with the truth
putting certain stories on the front page just like they put that whole series of articles by
Barry Jackson on last year about how Don Smiley how the deal was going to go down any second you know
to buy the marlins the deal go down no was it really going through no no the take can't put right
on the front page of the front section right under their mask and in which they have no pride we
can understand why 26 past 11 at 560 WQ and you know people it's Friday you best good listen to me
this is stand by and speak for sulfur king understand where everything is held to the high
sulfur king's standards the selection is in just huge it's sulfur king huge believe me you'll never
shop anywhere else and sulfur king's prices aren't just low they're so fucking low you'll never find
them anywhere else listen to me when I say sulfur king as a beautiful store I mean sulfur king
beautiful when I said is that helpful I mean sulfur king helpful listen to me get them know the
sulfur king and enjoy a selection that's so fucking huge a stack that's sulfur king courteous
and prices that are so fucking low you'll never shop anywhere else but don't take it for me
thank you from satisfied customer Frank and Stein
so fucking good you said it right he's so fucking good and Christina more bang 1132 at 560 WQ I
am any interest in that resolution by the greater Miami uh no no they don't care about that
just as much interest as there is in the marlins in the first place none in fact that's probably
one of the reasons even though there's no interest in the hockey year just to make sure that
they had to follow the marlin game last night with the panther exhibition game just to make sure
that even by accident nobody would hear it and believe me I'm sure nobody did 5 6 7 0 5 60
there's uh what's his name and pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line still the same still the same old
maniac where we going let's go I don't better not mention your name like look what happened last time
I did here's a mobile in the porteverglades hello hello here yes sir hey great show congratulations
uh now I would like to congratulate you for keeping the politicians under which people and check
I never been to a hockey game I'd be honest so I would like to take my son on you what do you say
what do I say I say okay sounds good to me aren't you shocked uh yeah where you where you
never want anything where you're for offer you didn't win anything but I'm getting where where you
from I was born near your city raising Puerto Rico on Puerto Rico okay you got a pal hang on
check check the switchblade at the agathe okay okay hang on okay take care of our Puerto
Rican friends Georgia will probably be surly to you but that's all right don't take no crap from okay
that means the only ones we got left are those 105 dollar or piece ones in row one c10 section 133
right in the front row now I hate to break the news to you they're very expensive and it's very
prestigious the only problem being when you sit in the front row you can't see a god damn thing
believe me see there are people who really want to sit like in the first 5 or 10 rows of the
hockey game you can't see anything because you have no angle and so like everything down low all
the stuff that's happening along the boards in the corners you're like craning you're not and you
still can't see anything but nevertheless it'll be very prestigious and you'll be impressed
to how out of somebody 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line here's Margate hello hey
now what's up how you doing sir I just want to be honest with you I got a little nervous for that guy
before me here why is that well it was a long pause between the asking and the giving yeah well
you had money to you know scared the hell out of the handle I'm a little bit
I thought that's any might have been Cuban you know I'm the guy who fact you that was in yesterday's
facts about GGs yeah now I don't know if that's the same place that was in you said it was in
date county north Miami no no no it was not it was up on federal highway right by the my car and
that right oh well that's not you know that place has been there forever uh-huh and I don't know
what it is you know this is a long time ago this is back in the late 60s and then they disappeared
and maybe that's where they moved to yeah maybe they went there he used to be like a big uh
tower in fact I think that's where one of those um not a swing club but one of those
topless jointes now oh uh oh yeah you know the bottom talking yeah I think it's an
they're platinum yeah I think that's there now or right next to it well that used to be
art stocks playpen in the 70s too right you remember that place I sure do yeah that's what that
place was nasty but anyway um what's unusual about this GGs restaurant which is unlike a lot of the
other restaurants that are in like West Broward this place has a crowd at like 11 30 at night
I mean there's people have that's only way for this town because this this town rolls up the
sidewalks as you know at 10 o'clock at night that's the end 90 o'clock it's incredible unless
you're downtown and either Miami or Fort Laudale you're not eating anywhere except the Denny's right
but uh it's really a good place I mean we've eaten there for years outstanding but I'll check that
out because if it's the same one they used to have baked spaghetti we have which is yep oh that
was so unbelievable I'm happy you could just die for me it was so good and also to talk about pizza
for a second let me tell you something these people down here don't know pizza for nothing
they the people that make pizza down here they try to impress people that are buying it by throwing
more crap on it the more crap on it that means it's supposed to be the best triple cheese and
you can't even pick the damn thing up you know you need a spatula to pick it up it's nasty yeah
but uh what's that yeah but you see the problem with making pizza down here is the water it's
never going to be like it is up north because of the water well this cheese can make good pizza yeah
so how did they do it I don't know maybe they've removed the ships of water in from up north maybe
they make it with peri it might have left over her it's a way yeah that could be it but uh you
know all these guys talking about jigs when I listen to the uh islanders Dan Kelly was the man then
in the early 70s Dan Kelly was the man then what he didn't do the islanders yeah he did he did
yeah in the early 70s the first couple years of the team and let me tell you something
people talk about the guys with speech impediments yeah a speech impediment Dan Kelly yes
no he didn't he's the called Dennis pot van pot va and it was two pot van pot van because that's
because it was frog because he was worked in Montreal before then well he called the way the
Frenchman then it was two pot vans on the team there was him and his brother John Dan Kelly was
great oh I agree Dan Kelly was one of the best if I had to pick the half a dozen great hockey
announcers of all time he there might be in him absolutely and he was in St. Louis too
St. Louis and Montreal yes oh he was incredible he's long gone though he's dead yeah he was fat
and he's dead and his son John Kelly who's an abortion is in Colorado and just to mix me nauseous
yes sir buddy I agree with that wasn't jigs working for Fox uh one of what's in a great while
when they had nobody else that they could find on the street they would put the jigs on her but
I'm glad we got him you know I have totally he's turned me around in one game nice job jigs
well I'll tell you one thing for for the very least he's a recognizable name that's attached to
this team well not just a recognizable name but for hockey fans who really know the sport which is
all ten of us are recognizable voice right from mid year and he describes the game and he made it
exciting and he was into it and that was and that was it was only 3,500 people in a house two in
Knoxville so you can imagine with a real crowd there would be a lot more exciting too and didn't he
now I keep bringing up all these jobs didn't he also work in Atlanta yes the line of flames he went
down in the boom boom whatever happened to him beats me okay listen I can hear the dials

Even the bizarre spark of the day, the only witness he is, it's scary.
16-till-noon at 5-60 WQAM.
If he had, I would tell you this, if he had even a minimal personality, he'd be 20 points ahead of Buch.
If he had like a little bit of a personality, he'd be 30 points ahead.
Here's Carl Springs.
Hello.
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
One of the reasons I called is for tickets, but what I want to tell you is I really upset about something that happened.
About three months ago, my son won in school or something like that at the Pick 4 magazine.
So he picked sports-holstery, GQ, because his 15 thinks he's got gifted women.
But anyway, if he picked his magazines and he picked Guns and ammo.
Yeah.
About two and a half weeks ago, he received in the mail a plastic card with his name on it.
He even had junior on it.
From the NRA.
From the NRA.
There you go.
They don't waste any time.
Two days ago, I got to do the Catholic Church.
Their motto was, get them all their young.
Two days ago, I got a call from the NRA asking for donation for asking for him.
They came in 15 years old.
They call them and they wanted to ask them for a donation because of the amendment that's up now and questions, stuff like that.
Yeah.
Wanted to back and everything.
I just shattered before I beat the crap out of you.
They're the kids 15 years old.
You know?
Uh-huh.
And they don't have any money.
One is once money.
Yeah.
The other thing is, I think you should take off Monday because I want to hear the ongoing story for George.
Uh-huh.
And if you have a set of tickets, uh...
Yeah.
If you're the ongoing Steward from Georgia Monday, that probably means we'll be hearing tapes in November of my next vacation.
Okay.
Well listen, I hope you and your son enjoyed as long as you know.
Be sure and check your guns at the gate.
Okay.
Okay.
These are the good tickets, too, by the way, for this guy.
Okay.
That's the end of the ticket.
No more tickets and that's the end of the call.
As you see, every line on the board is lit up right now.
Let's count the seconds and see how long before those little lights start plinking out.
Just like Planko on a price is right.
How's Bob Barker doing, by the way?
Did anybody see an M?
No.
Don't forget to stop by the IGFA Fishing Hall of Fame Museum 6 o'clock tonight,
where QAM gives you a chance to win that Ford SUV and see the unveiling of Ford's new colossal SUV, the excursion.
Maybe we can put the maries on it and set them on excursion to nowhere or somewhere, anywhere.
Here's the mobile and curl spring.
Hello?
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you doing today?
Great.
Neil will use religion as an excuse to kill people.
Why not use it to take a day off of work Monday?
That's a good point.
And also, you know, about the gun laws, the second amendment of an RAP want to bitch about it,
your mom must can tell him to shut the hell up.
Okay.
Have a good one.
See you.
Five, oh, see that?
That was starting to drop off one here, one there.
That'll happen because that's the only reason most of these people are on there.
They want freebies.
They want tickets for an exhibition, and probably some of these people won't even show up at.
Am I going to be there?
No.
No, no go to exhibition games.
In fact, as you'll notice, I already gave my tickets away because I don't like no empty seats.
I don't like those seats to be empty.
I like at least the appearance of somebody's interactor all this place already paid for them.
I just will have some asses in the seats.
Don't like going to a place where there's like a half-empty crowd.
It's just, it leaves you.
Except those seats in front of me.
Let's see.
Our first home game is two weeks from tomorrow.
Can you believe that October 2nd?
Saturday, October 2nd.
We've got a lot of Saturday home games, by the way, this year.
It's going to be real interesting to see the behavior of those people in front of me this year if they keep holding those little kids up in here and waving their arms up in here.
Because this year I'm bringing my machete.
And anything that's blocking my view, I'm just swinging that thing back and forth, kind of like Ala OJ style.
I'm just going to start swinging it in the machete, too.
So let anything up in the air at your own peril, including your little punky kids.
And don't be playing that crap anymore this year.
That got real old and ponderous last year.
And also playing at musical chairs with grandma and grandpa.
Cut the crap this year, okay?
Grow up and have a little consideration for other people, even if you are Jewish.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, whatever that meant.
And pound 5, 6, 10, on the 18 and T.
What does a lot of japs that go to the games, you know, and Broward?
It's a real jappy thing.
Not so much they want to see the game.
It's just a social thing.
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if we have yum-kipper services there.
Maybe you in a little snack.
Well, you know, they could have a game Sunday night on your own kipper with fit right in.
They had the Panther thing last Saturday right on the first day of Russia's Shana.
And of course, some people make an excuse to say, well, that's the only thing they could do.
And I come on here and make the same excuse for them.
It's inexcusable, okay?
Just because Wayne owns the team and happens to be an anti-Semite.
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello?
I'm Neil.
Yes.
Just going to come to us.
Why, what is it?
What do you got? Like 40 pounds of mush in your mouth?
What are you saying, sir?
Is this the guy that called me yesterday going a little bit like that?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes.
What can we do for you, ma'am?
Talk about your makins, talk about your makins yesterday?
Yes.
Why don't you like your makins?
What do you got to get them?
Ma'am.
Come on.
I need a bite.
Okay, bye.
Bye, ma'am.
No, you sell.
That's what you said.
You sell and I'll buy.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60.
Here's the only AT&T line.
Boy, like I said, who wouldn't it be interesting if we started just for six months if we tried
swapping some of the people we got here now for some different ethnic groups?
Just for a variety, you know, bring a whole bunch of Chinese families down here, bring in some of those
Pakistanis.
Sounds pretty interesting to me.
Let just a little experiment, bring some Dutch people in here for about six months.
A few Swedes.
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.
Hello?
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How did you know they started?
Great.
I enjoy your show and you still saw my fun about the colors calling up. I just want to say to people in South Florida
I said they do such a such a such job. I said for the past couple months to three months
You've been calling up asking ask all the colors for some verbal intercourse on the on the phone and nobody calls up
Oh, yeah, today they're smoking oh
Maybe you give something away
What a such job these people do you get ducking people up they call it up and the stories they give you
It's just I don't see how that doesn't and I don't get you how how you know for the past two two months
You know I listen every day ten to two and you know nobody's running the same one
You can start the job that was
That's right
But if all I had to say I'm having material on the outside pal. Thank you God bless you. I'll pray for it
5 6 7 0 5 60 that's our new line. I love that line
I'll pray for it because that's I mean what more can you say what what greater put out?
I don't want to put this guy down because he was right on target
But nevertheless if you don't want to put somebody down to say that oh searching for satellite signal
I means it's pouring out here again to now
You know this is getting just like Florida here, you know
This is getting just like soft Florida during rainy season which lasts from like April 11 look
Godday in November or May or whatever the hell it is
Enough with this crap already 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line
Here's Pember pine tello. Hey, you know how's it going pretty good?
I listened to the game last night. I would note the mind. I'm an I understand from way back
So I used to watch jigs on TV. I thought he called a pretty good game last night
But it's interesting to hear it somebody else mentions a good chemistry with him and molar
Mm-hmm
I think before was that Eddie Westfall bringing him down because that guy was terrible. Yeah
Eddie Westfall he was like it was a Christina Moore bringing Randy mollet because that's is that never
Never worked it didn't and also
He brought up a couple of good points during the game
A Christina Moore never really discussed anything having to do with the game
But jigs had mentioned something about the new overtime format right with the shoot out
He said he didn't like it. I hate it described the action very well
And also I was wondering get your opinion on
Well, he said you know also about the shoot out as it stops it from being a team sport and then it's more like a one-on-one
Skills contest, you know the game isn't won that way if you're a team right that's everybody supposed to be playing as a team
They have a 4 on 4 is almost as stupid. It's idiotic. Well, it was ridiculous when they had that oiler rule back in the
mid 80s when
When the oilers were winning all the Stanley cups every time there was a double minor when it used to go to 4 on 4
Before they changed that rule a few years back again
They would always score they'd have grepsky and coffee and curry out there and they'd always
You know they had to stop them from doing that because they would always score short-handed anyway, but
Meanwhile about I was curious to see what you thought about the moving Paul laws up to play forward. I hate it
I don't think they try they try that every year. He's not a forward
It's a waste of time. It's a waste of his abilities
You don't want to do that because the forward obviously and especially that's on the fourth line
Which plays very little and you want him to be out there a lot if they want to put somebody out there to protect
Pavel Burry and the laws out of me his defensive pairing ought to be out there every shift when Burry's on the ice instead of saying
Well, we're gonna put Peter Warrell out there with Pavel Burry. That's the dumbest thing
But again consider the source the world's a big
I mean he's got the size advantage over laws
But he hasn't got the skill is for us playing good defense
And he's a big guy rumbling around out there plus you've got a superstar like Burry
You'll put your other skilled players out there with him. You don't put a guy who's like whatever he is
Well, you see the same thing I think that we saw when Burry first came to the team before he got hurt last year
And it's gonna elevate the skill of everybody who plays with him
It'll bring that line up and even if he's not playing on the first they're gonna play Burry on the first line or the second line
Your ask any is he gonna be on the first or second line? I'm asking me that question. I
Is no is no telling with these Murray brothers is no telling what they're gonna do
I mean my pension for me will be on the first line
Well, then you know you want that line to be consistent
Everybody to be playing up to the same par so you know you got to you got to surround them with good players
Okay, but in any case I don't want any free tickets good cuz we don't have any I don't want to call anybody a douchebag
Great and have a great day you too, and I want you to say goodbye
5 6 7 0 5 60 pond 5 60 on the 18 T wireless lines for hockey intensive. They aren't we maybe no?
Don't forget we got the abroons and passes game here with jigsman Donald Liet at 7 30
And then of course we're gonna interrupt it at 9 30 for the Marla game and the rest of the hockey game will be on wax
He's 7 90 which will carry the whole game are you following that?
I mean, does that make any sense to any of us? No, but that's way see this is what happens when you bite off more than you can chew
And he got 72 sporting events going on those same time for example tomorrow
I probably shouldn't mention this because it's really embarrassing
One of the big college matchups in the last 400 years Penn State and the Huracunis at the Orange Bowl
And of course now that were the Huracunis station where we're carrying the game
Yeah, but are we gonna carry it on the Q a n? No, no, not if I'm reading this thing correctly
Which I believe I'm see because the Marlon contract whoever wrote their contract really got this place by the balls
Not only we have to pay a millions of dollars for that crappy product from say lost again yesterday in case you didn't
There's seventh in a row and they're now 32 games under 500
But also they take precedence over everything else including even the dolphins
Yes, we are carrying that game
What can whatever you were talking about on Q a n? Yes, or on waxy Q a n
Well, you sure as hell wouldn't know that looking at this
It's got an inferences it says Penn State knit me lions at the Huracans on
Whatever and you can't make it your tails of it and it's got three thirty to seven of them
I don't tell me that somebody screwed up on the schedule. Oh my god. That's not possible is it?
Somebody screwed up on the sky and makes there can't make it her tails of it
Because it would seem to me that not that I want to cause trouble you understand not me
And not that I give a ratch-ass about the Huracans in any way shape performed because anybody with a brain nose
Never less since it's a marquee game
You certainly think that would be here on the flagship station Q a m and at the Marlin thing we could put the Marlin thing on Waffen
Give them some practice you want you guys want to have a sporting event on it here carry the Marlin
Arizona game tomorrow. We don't want no part of that. We wouldn't touch it with your finger
Well, there's an FU with the definitive word if anybody would know it's the nephew and no one there's duck right behind him, okay?
The Bob's each wins just come rushing in the door there. They got the revised new and improved schedule. Okay, let's take a look at it
Let's see if I can make head to tails out of this
Okay, oh, we're all looking at it. Oh
My god, this is better than putting it on 2800 on the dial
We got the Penn State Hurricane game here on Q a m and at the same time we got the Marlin Arizona game on WS RF
Let's hear it
Of course, you know not a good idea of pushing people down to that end of the dial right now four minutes till noon at Q a m
Hey guys have you ever wanted to tell your girlfriend what's really on your mind like when she asked
Me the dead well now you can with the mr. Hanky message service
A little weight problem
You mean that's right you got more kids than a Chinese phone book
What the fuck are you talking about with the mr. Hanky message service?
You can get it all off your chest and she'll never even know it's you
My gosh
You're gonna see stags I can smell it all the way over here
You little muck girl. I'll tell you you piece of shit if her ass is getting big let her know call 1-800 Hanky-1
Okay, 12-1-560 WQM now we're now to a precious few on the aboard now that all a panther tickets are gone
I told you but that's okay. We stole two easy hours today my school in the old
Thank you
Just asked Bluff Lindsay R esteemed program director. What do you think about my taking off Monday?
And he went
Not a good idea
Which I really don't care what his opinion is anyway, but he is right about one thing
I wouldn't be that much of a hypocrite all of a sudden become a
Oh
You that's why I take off Martin Luther coon day in the January makes for nice 3-day weekend
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line here's Hollywood with 16 question marks hello
Hey Neil how are you today? Hey, I got a chance
I was working one of the few people got a chance to be in the car last night and listen to
Well, I'd say it was part of the hockey game except it was all fighting at the end of the second period
So I got to hear jigs McDonald call boxing. I guess it was not so much hockey but
He's really good. He's got a great voice. He's really
He's got a classic style classic voice. I just I just I just love
The way he he did the game
There it is, you know that there was I think it's gonna be fun
Like I said he was doing the game basically and I'm also Liam is like 3,500 people there
So it's not that easy to make the broadcast sound that exciting as if they're like 17,000 people inside
You know in a lot of crowd reaction. Yeah, I job jigs. Hey, I gotta I want to ask you a question
I know I know you already gave away the tickets for the ambition game
And I don't want to go to the exhibition game
I I would like to and I guess you got to ask you can't get if you don't ask I'd like to go to a hockey game with you
Neil I'd like to go can't do that. What do you mean by that? I'd like to go
I'd like to
Instead of instead of you giving away ticket. I don't want to take somebody
I want to go to the game with you and talk hockey. No watch hockey game with you know
Can't do it. No, come on. No. Why would I want to do that when I got my own tickets when the station buys me tickets?
Why would I want to do that?
Well, who do you go to the game with who do I get go to the game with a friend? Okay? Yeah, do I know you?
No, I don't go to sporting events with strangers unless they look really good
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound how do you like that? Boy, I tell you one thing
This guy wants to take me to the game, huh?
Boy, does he have a lot of kids?
5 6 7 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line
Beware of those lonely guys. You saw what happened in Fort Worth, didn't you?
Lonely guy high unemployment punch holes and all walls in his house. Nothing more of those crazed loners
I don't want to say that George W. Bush is the governor of a really screwed-up state
But it seemed to be a lot of crazed loners in that state, you know, Beverly Harvey Schwartz. Remember him?
Tommy Pinko bastard. Here's Delray Beach. Hello
Hello, Neil. Yes, how you doing Neil? Great good. Hey, listen talking, huh?
You know I
Only get parts of your radio station because I'm in out of my car because I worked out of it
But I heard you earlier talking about they went no Katie length from Mike length without rings back to Bellman
I'm from outside Utica not too far from you and I remember Mike Lang down in Pittsburgh
We catch it on the satellite. He's a he's probably one of the best announcers in the NHL one of the top three in my book
You don't have any highlights of him. Do you have a big Andy Mike Lang? Yeah, who Mike Lang?
Well, I'm stolen for time. I can't give you Mike Lang on demand
Hear that one. Oh, I see Mr. Smartass in here. I got one that I want to play here just to go
Touching around a killed time
I don't know I think we're gonna think the panthers gonna be a 500 team if that I think they're gonna be pumped up
You know as people are gonna be depressed in this year, you know, they still got a lot of panel players
They're about four players short of a team here. I'm gonna hold back. Yeah, listen
Oh
Yeah, all that brings back memories. How do you like that? Hey, but listen you see dry will you? Okay?
Get out of here already enough Mike. We're in a catch and dogs out there and that's bad news again again
By the way, they had a lot of rain from the hurricane
You know what say a lot of flooding a lot of rain a lot of people die from this thing
No, you see those two girls that drown the two sisters
The two dark-complexed young girls in the river they were out there in Delaware River
I believe it was playing in a river. There's a big hurricane coming and flooding
You can't even the parents need to be horsewood. They need to be putting you lucky to your just a certain example right on band rather tonight
If we can bring Dan in and drive off a little bit
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60. Yeah, here you go. I thought so
For my good close personal friend Dave Halberstam which is I heard a caller this morning say the Dan Kelly called the other game
He never did neither did I think he did his brother Hal Kelly did one year of Islanders TV
7374 on WR Channel Dine for my good close friend David Halberstam nice to go on Dave and great book and two bad
That Mike Mayo is too much of a schmuck to apologize to you for that crap that he wrote
No class Mike may hold the male
In fact if I you know something if I took two of his columns to Amsterdam it's not put male under fries
That's how embarrassed they would be
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line more misinformation from the brilliance outflow to hockey audience than Kelly did the Islander game
Right. Yeah, and I broadcast the Maple Leafs in the 60s right?
Here's a mobile invoker. Hello. Good morning. Yeah, sir. Hey
I just wanted to ask
I'm gonna ask you a few questions about you were talking about the newspaper how they cover up things
My name is Harold. Well, I have a story for you here in Bokka
Well, this old lady
She was raped. Uh-huh very old lady. She was raped by a young man. Uh-huh. I don't know where he was from
But did the halfway house right around where she lives? Uh-huh, and there was nothing in the paper about it
So that was like a cover up to me. Okay
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 St. In fact, that sounded like the rapist to me trace that call
Tele voice like that a million miles away talk about crazed loners sounded like it to me a lot of himming and hawing and humming
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's Miami. Hello
Let's try Miami again. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir
I have a comment for that directly gather people calling the arresting you
Yeah, I'm on. Yeah, I'm going to make it also by raising the fair board
You know, he's a soccer really idiot. You're not racist. You can't think that jokes don't you know turn the dial exactly
If you have no sense of humor, this is the wrong spot on the dial for you, right? Right in a dish
Which in addition to what she said to start pussy ain't even sent no good stuff over here

Okay, that was great, but unfortunately
Ha ha ha ha ha not quite ready for prime time. I don't think

My back sporting a new here. We
Your back more
Yes, 12 14 at 5 60 W. Can I as a great column is actually a few things to read in the hero today and especially if you look in a business section for the article about the
The steady money
Of course nobody reads that but there actually are like maybe four or five things worth reading there
They which is more than usual month full
Look and this is much too boring for one year
But I just mentioned in case somebody wants to read it Claudius Smith Brinson on the bottom of the op-ed page in this morning's
Have you checked food for sugar content you should and she talks about all the food products in the added sugar the hidden sugar and everything from peanut butter to
Everything soup you name it and they're just loading pouring the extra sugar when you're killing America
Does anybody screaming about that? No?
marijuana that's gonna kill you but sugar that's okay because we don't want to piss off those cane sugar people
We don't want to piss cane off
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's New Orleans. Hello
Neil how you doing pretty good sir don't talk bad about sugar cane when you got a guy from New Orleans that's for a bad timing you
Yeah, that's that's terrible. So how's by you doing fine?
When you get yourself syndicated we need some decent listen to up here. No, you have to listen on the internet
I can't seem to do that anymore my computer doesn't seem to work
You have to have to upgrade me anyway listen the reason I'm calling is I have I've got a three o'clock flight to come into my
Amie this afternoon. Oh, don't do that. I'd love to see the game tomorrow. Yeah, you got any idea how I can get tickets to see what came tomorrow
The only game in town Miami Penn State. I know you're a big hurricane. No, I'm not
How could you not be?
Well, what does that mean? How could I not be did I go to school there?
Don't you live there? Well, what does that have to do with anything in way? Let me ask you does Jim Manditch live in Ann Arbor?
I don't know where Jim Manditch was but I know from what he lived here
He's a big Michigan fan nearly, but you you civic pride it oozes from
No, I have no there's no civic pride when he live in this town
I'm okay
That's right. Well good luck to you pal. Hope you can scalp some got call from
You want what just the other day?
What you just told me about that same kind of person?
Why aren't you a cane fan? Oh, yeah
Well, but with the five years that I bought my own I had to actually pay for them
Which I'd like to have the money back my own the dolphin the only reason I did do it is cuz bad rich head
It was great to each right on the 50-yard line and so we used to split the pair so to speak and every year for five years in a row
I paid for and the said in those 50 yard line and then we had all these people in front of us
Some of them older than I am and some of them like younger but nevertheless a variety of these two families and
Not just big dolphin fans, but half of the time especially before the game with stuff
They'd start yacking about the hurricane and oh aren't you excited about and I'd say no
They'd look at me like what's wrong with you man like how was I'm kind of like this guy?
When it comes to first of all college football is for the students and for the alumni of that school period
It has nothing to do with civic pride
Nobody should be expected to go to a ball game because it had a college sporting event because it happens to be in their community
See that's the problem this town is so screwed up
They don't know the difference between professional sporting events
Which are for the general community at large and college sports which are for the people who either go to that school or did go to that school or have
Some connection or interest with that school
Let me see it again
Okay
Although I do like Mark van de Mir, I knew what play by play guy that we heard is great
See we're starting to make some progress on this station, huh?
Now that we ever know some of those some swill like Christina Moore and like my good friend Dave Lamont who's a good guy
But the screamer. I mean on the games
We're making some progress mid area, but I mean there's a ticket genius to figure out
I and you know something I went to Michigan state
I wouldn't watch it in time as you can stay football game if you paid me by the minute if it happens to be on if I can fight it on the
Dish on a Saturday
I'll watch a little bit every now and then and I'll flip back to see what the score is and how bad we're losing to a girls team and see what's going and that's it
I don't understand that I don't get it
How can you possibly in fact most of the I hate to say this but I've admitted this before
Like last Saturday it gave me sexual excitement to watch the last part of the Purdue Notre Dame game and watch Notre Dame lose
I can't begin to tell you what tremendous tingling I had in my
Watching the end of that game and watching Notre Dame blow it looked like they were gonna pull it out of their ass again
And I guess they got disconnected the bat line the Vatican got disconnected
He was calling that last play. They were sending it in from the sideline. That's why they had to take that time out
And just at the wrong time the bat line got disconnected and the quarterback got all this
Compobulated and they screwed up the handoff and they didn't score in the clock ran out second week in a row and Notre Dame lost
That gave me tremendous thrill no touchdown Jesus
Because their entire their entire sporting program, but especially their football program is obnoxious and most of the people who go to Notre Dame are obnoxious not all but most
Their whole attitude about winning is disgusting
nauseating I mean sure winning is better than losing, but their whole philosophy is sick. It's twisted
They're they're just nauseating people the Notre Dame people make me puke
So yeah, I'll watch a lot of that especially if Notre Dame's getting their ass kicked I'll be sitting there squeezing it
I'm trying to think of what other college, you know like for example tomorrow
I might watch a little bit just to see and I hate Penn State
I can't stand Joe paternal, but you know something when the hurricanes are playing anybody
I'm a big fan of the other team
I'm a big fan to the other when they're playing. I love uh, you know whoever it is fill in the blank
Even if it's a team that I hate in fact I hate to say this, but when the hurricanes are playing Notre Dame
Those rare years when they play them anymore when they're playing notice. Hey, let's go Irish baby touchdown Jesus. All right
That's how much content in the state I have for the hurricanes and everything connected with them
Because I already had my you know, I did hurricane baseball for six years and we had a good time
I went to Omaha to the college world series every year. That was a lot of fun
But I got a real good insight as to what that whole deal is over there. It's sick
It's really sick. It's nausea. In fact, I wouldn't it's even worse than Notre Dame
And there's no constituency for hurricane sports here. It's the phony is devolving
How many years went by when it couldn't draw flies in that joint
They played Penn State have 15 20,000 people in there now. They got a sold out game tomorrow
And everybody's on a bandwagon. Oh, yeah, when they beat Ohio State and then they beat a girl school
You know that they shouldn't have been played in the first place
We tell us hyper high game that's gonna be exciting
Although hyper high at least got a better radio station. Here's Carl spring. Hello
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Is this a thicker broker central? Yes, thicker broker
I was listening to the idiot from
Louisiana and the one he was and
I'm saying to myself the one reason that when you get to Mississippi you kiss the ground
Not because of the casinos or blocks or anything is you kiss the ground and Mississippi because that means you're out of Louisiana
I mean that places it fits, but anyway
Lose around that's right. I've been trying to call you to ask you a question and maybe contribute something
But I couldn't get through because of all the idiots wanting free tickets of course
I wish we could doing that
But anyway, I don't know you'd notice I almost never do that today was an extension god
You don't because of these away. It's impossible to get through and you want to ask something or contribute something and there's no way
But anyway, the article in Miami-Herald
I don't get that rag anymore. I gave up give it a long time ago
article in the Harold who was the organization of the group that voted against the thing for the stadium for
The crazy man the greater Miami and beaches hotel association
Hmm
That vote and and I'm glad they voted that way, but I the whole thing is suspect
It seems well my whole thing is suspect. What does that mean? Well, it seems to me that a certain person that owns the
Panther holdings decided to start buying hotels and I'm sure whatever for whatever reason he was for this and now he may be against it or sway that organization
Anything that he is connected with I trust about as much he has much credibility as a clitorinist right?
He's not connected with that organization at all. I mean he's not on the board of directors
He isn't going to do it. Well, does any own hotels? Well, that doesn't make him involved at first
I think his hotels are like pier 66. I think they're all in brown. They are well
In that case in that case I
In addition in addition to which why would he do that? Why would he want to like a double crossing guy that everybody believes
He's still in bed with his good buddy John Henry would want to do that
Neil anything that comes from that man. I don't trust. Yeah, as far you know as far as I can go on that anyway
I'm saying no that paranoid. Well, that's what happens when you live in Wayne is hiding under your bed right now
No, I got for that that's what happens when you live in South Florida for a while to become paranoid and psychotic
Yes, but anyway, um, fly if I got through them then do you put them on my arrest?
Okay, okay
Give Wayne a big kiss for us right on the back dome ball spot
5670560 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Yes, Neil. Yes, sir. Hi. How are you? Great. I'd like to pick your brain for a second if I may
I'm involved in a sports trivia contest and what I need to know
You're gonna ask me a sports trivia question. Yes. Okay
5670560 there is nothing more boring than
Then trivia of any kind sports trivia, especially, but we don't do that on the show
I'd rather give tickets away and I'd rather croak them give tickets away again after the day, but I mean no
No way
Just absolutely positively the answer is no and if you ask me again the answer would still be no
A 50 million times. No
Oh, man, and you're complaining about the people who got the free tickets
5670560 pound 560 and you know something nobody can answer
I see when it comes to my doing for them no problem at all
But nobody has answered my question first of all about the back street boys tickets
Which like I said, I'm gonna explore every other avenue because this place will never come through for me
I know is and if the damn good thing that is they didn't postpone it because I'm sure I would have been left in the lurch
But a lot of people have asked me and I don't have the answer to the question
What do you do with the tickets from the days that they were postponed?
Did they honor those tickets? You have to swap them for tickets for December 15th
It's a very simple question that somebody out there must know the answer to for the back street boys concerts
Which are the summer 5th and 6th is anybody had the answer? No, why not and we're gonna. How are my goddamn tickets? That's what I would like to know
Don't think about this place can't you to anything done just like screw-in she comes up here this morning finally after my fifth request
She comes up here and I got give her a song and it ends about the various clients
We got in the information that we're not getting like nix regards with those 10% discount days did anything happen?
No, I mean, I'm sure what are taking at least one phone call to find out and John penis was lurking around somewhere according to her
Did he do anything? No, no
Let me say it again. This is a place where nobody will do anything unless somebody makes them do something and in most cases
Nobody will make anybody do anything
You name the department sales engineering programming you picked the department unless somebody holds their feet to the fire
They will do nothing
And they like it that way and for two or three months I went along like that kind of in La La Land guilty
You know kind of you know talking me into that I was able to survive for a while like that
But then you finally reach a point where it becomes you know goes a little bit too far
You're doing a green apple quick step because you just kind of like I lost too many steps
26 past noon at 560 wqam. You're how do we do it station for the 90s?
Hey
Yeah
Im
like plants, they will take your hand.
We got a land, we swirled in our day.
We look like kids in the desert,
we sing like a chastity, why does a grustain
Our agent says we got a sand.
We swim in our day.
Our biggest fans are 12 year old girls.
The secret is just F&D.
Yes.
As they get older they all figure out
We're hiding our latency.
One thing is for sure we get many joy.
We do.
Why does a cloud of chemicals like gold
long to do more?
The secret you'll find, gold
We think that we have better say.
We say we're not gay.
I swim with not gay.
Okay, 1232 at 560 W3M.
So here's the good news and a bad news.
The good news is just like I anticipated
that they'll honor the tickets from September
whatever the original dates were,
that the accounts got cancelled.
The bad news is do I have any tickets to be honored?
No.
I have nothing.
Have I heard any more about it?
No.
Do I have any confidence in whatsoever
that kid career is going to come through?
No.
And he's tickets.
You see, this is the thing that really
your stunners is me.
Remember the day that Greg Reed,
which I, I'm reluctant to even mention his name on here
since he's in Vegas and another
beastly Reed corporate meeting,
a bunch of bull cramp sitting around with a bunch of
a boso.
Comes in here and oh yeah, remember that?
He's going to get me tickets.
Front row, front row seats.
Doesn't mention that they're coming from Power 96
and Kid Curry.
He's going to do it.
So he's responsible for this.
And of course he's nowhere to be found.
In addition to which he's talking
because I told him the other day to get the hell out of here,
I was going to do a show and one see his ugly face.
Another empty promise, another bunch of bull cramp.
From a man who tells tales,
even Walt Whitman never saw leads of grass as tall
as the tales that this man tells.
Five, whatever that means.
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60,
pound five, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hey Neil, how you doing?
Pretty good sir.
I'm supposed to be taking my niece
into that factory boys contract.
I wish I was in Dowing.
Anyway, I remember last week
we were talking about different kinds of police.
And different kinds of what?
Different kinds of police is your thing.
Those marijuana police is,
can police go on and so forth.
There's license plate police is.
License plate police is yeah.
My fiance just got a ticket for $65 for having a sticker
in the middle of her life is late.
What kind of a DS is that?
Well just sticker man, that's what I would say.
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound five, 60.
Too many kinds of police is out there.
Band it's bad.
It's real bad.
Stay out of those police.
That's right.
Bad police is five, six, seven, oh five, 60.
We're down to a precious two or three calls on the board.
Do you want to know why?
Because we gave all the free tickets away.
Everybody else got their tickets.
But when it comes to my tickets, which I'd love to have now,
so I have some confidence that I'm going to be able to go.
If I got anything at all, see, and a reason that I should have been really said.
And I kept asking because I'd not that I don't trust anybody
about around it, which I don't.
I kept saying, which there they for?
Could anybody tell me?
No.
Like, dummy up.
Just be grateful we're getting you anything.
And they didn't.
And if they're honoring the tickets that were for before,
and I was really going to get them, I'd have them by now anyway.
Wouldn't you think?
Wouldn't a normal logical.
Yeah, sure I'd have them by now.
That would be like us giving away the tickets for tonight's exhibition,
Panther Game of the Bruins and say, oh, by the way,
we'll mail them out to you.
Well, gamers tonight, yeah, but we'll mail them out to you.
Maybe they'll get there someday.
And if they don't, you're all probably probably got lost in the mail.
Do you know how that goes?
Maybe the ticket police is intercepting them.
Here's plantation.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
Hi, Neil.
I'm calling you about the Backstreet Boy Concert.
Yeah.
Yeah, we talked to you before, and you said you had front row tickets.
What happened with that?
I said I was promised front row tickets.
I never actually got them in my hand.
Oh, that's hot out.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, I was going to tell you that the tickets that were for September 14th.
I just got to sing that.
Oh, did you?
That they're going to be honored for December 15th.
December 15th, yeah.
All right.
I just wanted to let you know that.
Well, I don't have any notes.
Well, that's things.
You should call somebody in race hell.
Okay, thanks.
All right.
Have a good day.
Bye.
Yeah, call the ticket police and raise some hell about this.
Okay.
By the way, can we get any answer from Kid Korea about this?
No.
No.
You know, he's one of those people he's like, you know, really a manic.
You know, one day's a good guy next day.
He's an asshole.
Because the same thing happened last year when he got into the screaming row or thing with Rob.
What's his name?
Rob Kaplan from Miami.
When they were blasting the music down around the second floor.
Well, I don't give a f about the new Roger show or busy.
Yeah, yeah, we're busy blasting music here.
Oh, it said was who the hell are you to Rob Kaplan?
No, that, but then afterward he said, you know, yes, he did.
I don't know.
You have a very bad memory.
He that's exactly what he said.
Rob said, we're trying to do a show in there.
I don't give a whatever about the new.
You know about Neil screw him.
I'm sure Rob made that up.
You are such a little suck cold, you know.
What do you want to piss the men off who's holding on to your tickets presumably?
He doesn't, have you seen any tickets?
No.
Have you seen Heider here of him?
Why would he lie?
Was he able to tell you which day they were for, were for for four?
And had them yet that yeah.
And had them.
I don't think I got to have them.
The one good person on that station is my good friend, Shvoke Griffin.
She's somebody a solid solid is a rock.
And Mark Mosley who ain't really on that station, but he just thinks he is.
He's a good guy, but other than that.
Is there anybody else worth a crap on that station?
Am I leaving anybody out?
DJ Lass.
Who's that?
The pimple with a limp.
I don't know who that is.
DJ Dog, little guy.
Good guy.
I don't know who that is.
So nice people.
And see, so he's another geek like the Igor in production.
We got more freaky people around here.
Speaking of that, that was.
Fat below was the limping around up here when I came in this morning when I came up the elevator shaft with Duff.
Yeah, we came up the shaft together this morning.
Well, he was pretty excited.
He was at Gary Sarner's son's brisk last night.
Here's their field beach.
Hello.
Hey, Neil, how are you today?
Pretty good, sir.
Did you watch, you watched MTV musical works, right?
Yes, I did.
Who's the blonde kid?
What was his name from the Backstreet Boys?
Nick Carter.
That dude sounds like a total flaming guy.
Yeah.
I'm, I've, did you hear him talk?
I mean, he does sound gay though.
Yes, he does.
He got like a high, because he liked the soprano in the group.
He's the girl.
I mean, yeah.
Well, let me ask you a question.
When's Andy from Hollywood has tickets?
Would you go?
Front road tickets?
No, I would not.
Not with him.
I heard a rumor he may have some.
I don't care.
But, but you, they don't, they don't, since you promote the Backstreet Boys more than you purport anything else in the world,
don't you think that they might come through for tickets?
No, I do not.
Have you read a station?
No, they don't need me.
And aren't you?
We're just an AM radio station that doesn't time use it anyway.
That's why Power 96 has probably got tickets up the ass over there.
But isn't that the same company though?
It doesn't make any difference.
They don't share with us.
We don't even exist.
We're like, underling.
They don't even basically talk to us because we're AM.
Even though we're building a lot more money on an AM station than they are on FM with other ratings and other big signal,
they don't talk to us.
We're just AM people.
That's horrible.
The only one that speaks to me is my good friend, Bob Griffin, other than that,
they don't even, they won't even look at you.
Okay.
All right, now I'll just kind of curious.
And leave Nick alone.
Okay.
Okay.
I was in the car about half an hour ago listening to you.
First of all, Nick Carter has more talent than his right code than you will ever have.
And he's not a pineapple head.
You stupid fat baguette.
Yeah. Well, I've seen his right toe.
Okay. Sweetheart and Isbury Talented.
567-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.
21-till noon at QIM.
Here's great news for you guys.
We've got that big ball spot that God has inflicted right in the middle of your head there.
It's getting bigger and bigger.
It's growing.
Something's on your body.
You'd like to grow.
They never grow.
But that particular thing keeps getting bigger and bigger.
And there's not much you can do about it except go see Charles Elfieri.
Because for over 25 years, he's been doing it great for God's making him look fantastic.
And now he's extended the great QAM special.
There's another John Penis question I got.
George about this QAM.
Is it the QAM special or the new Roger special?
Do we know?
Will this man answer a question down here?
No.
Is God damn John Penis out of a bitch?
No, he will not.
Every piece of copy I got from this guy, I got questions about.
Can we get any answers from this guy?
No.
No.
Because screw in, she's another one, okay?
She's another one.
Does anybody pay any attention to her?
No.
Maybe.
Roy.
And he's busy looking for another job.
Let me say it again.
Charlie's extended the new Roger, especially mentioned QAM or new Rogers or anything under the restaurant.
That has to do with us.
And then lock $300 off the regular $800 price.
At that great looking natural airline system.
Hi, this is T Gordon Lydia and they don't come any worse than Neil Rogers.
Then I think it's going to be a long time before my bike will only one cent.
And then I own it down to a lot of gold.
Oh no, no, no, no.
Long 50 dollars.
Long 50 pocket madam.
Long 50 pocket madam.
Long 50- Dop Bitte 6.
Long 40...
Long 50.
Long 70 pocket madam.
Long 70 pocket madam.
Long 50 pocket madam.
Long 50 pocket madam.
We got Steve Nichol.
I was thinking about Steve Nichol yesterday about incestuous relationships and radio stations and how they always turn out,
I virtually always turn out to be a disaster.
Not a good idea to craft where you eat.
You know, I've always been my philosophy.
Don't...
...where you eat.
Always turns into a real nightmare.
Look around here.
Look at all the mammoth problems that we have of just gigantic proportions
because too many people around here have screwed around.
And too many people have naked pictures.
That's why this place is basically in limbo because too much screwing around
and too many people blackmailing their way into permanent jobs.
And I was thinking of Steve Nichol.
Now, what was your name?
Which one?
The one that took a shoes-and-powder.
And left pound.
Suzy Girard.
The one that took a shoes-and-powder.
560-70560 pound, 560 on the AT&T wireless line.
And then of course there was our friend Cheryl and Mitch Weeney, the chief engineer.
Did that work out?
No.
The voice.
All these incestuous relationships, man.
It's just not good.
Not good.
Not that I'm giving anybody advice.
Doesn't work.
Here's pompano.
Hello.
Pompano.
How about pressing a button?
Here's pompano.
Hello.
Press the button, dude.
Okay.
I was doing a pubic therapy on the day and there were three motorcycle cops with the radar
gun out in the bushes.
And I flashed my lights to the upcoming traffic and the good citizen would.
Yes, sir.
And they pulled me over and said they could arrest me for obstructing the justice.
Yeah, well, Tom, they're blowing out the rest.
Thank you.
Yeah, they do that.
No, we've had many of those.
If you're smart, if you're a good guy, you'll flash your lights and warn them about
these speed traps because obviously it's not the kind of law enforcement that we're
paying our tax dollars for.
I mean, if you're diving dangerously, if you're jeopardizing other people's lives, then
we encourage them to put you over.
Then it's great.
But all this speed trap stuff, 99 and 9.10% of anybody with an IQ larger than their thumbnail
agrees this is a tremendous waste of taxpayer money and public harassment.
Just like the other day, when they took the tolls off the turnpike, which they finally
got back on yesterday afternoon, by the way, they finally got around to getting the tool
people.
Or as my good friend, Sylvia, by the way, speaking of the toll booths, that was one of the
highlights of my day.
See, and Redheared Sylvia there at the at Joe Robbie Stadium, whatever they call it,
place now a turnpike toll booth every day or just about every day.
Haven't seen her in a coons age.
Shouldn't have said coons age.
That's what they got working there now.
We're Sylvia.
God damn it.
So they were losing the revenue from that.
So we had a feeding frenzy by the FHP.
Well, if there is any organization in this state that needs to be dispended, it's the
Florida highway pig.
God, they always the tax money.
All they do is write business.
That's basically all they do.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the ATT wireless line.
Here's 9.10.
I said that on purpose.
Yes, sir.
NEL.
What's happening?
Hey, a couple of plots from that hurricane.
No traffic.
No traffic jam.
It was a pleasure.
No road necking, which is great.
How tall is that in turn, Plank?
All the houses have boarded up.
So there's no breaking in or in crime.
It must have been down 9,000%.
Yeah, it's better in Berler bars.
It really is.
More attractive.
It was a beautiful thing.
Hey, that church shooting and Fort Worth, a few of the people there had claimed that they
thought it was some kind of skit because they're planning some kind of thing.
Yeah, they always say that.
Every time you hear the same thing in the school, I would end little to them.
They said the same thing that thought it was a comedy.
But what kind of skit evolved guns in the school?
I don't know.
I just, or guns in a school.
I between.
Yeah, who skits?
Uh-huh.
Not good.
I'll keep in mind where it was.
I saw one Panther game last year, and it's all very score a great goal with an unbelievable
player.
Right.
That guy is the only athlete at whole team.
Of course, don't forget he's not playing in these exhibition games.
Not that I wanted to screw with anybody from going tonight, but he won't be playing.
Hey, speak of that game.
Yeah.
Any tickets left?
No.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line tickets are a long gone.
Let me say it again.
The tickets are gone.
They're gone.
They're history.
We had nine pair.
We gave away nine pair.
Nine from nine leaves.
None.
N-U-N.
None.
Just like the tickets, I'm going to get to the back three boys concert from this place.
None.
N-U-N.
Did Blufflin's he take care of that, by the way?
No.
Did screw in take care of our problem with our copy this morning that she waddled in here and
gave me her usual mealy mouth approach to life?
No.
No.
No.
Because nothing happens here.
I'm going to tell you.
They can have a goddamn volcano in their pants in this place.
And nothing would still happen.
It is impossible.
It is in a movable object is place.
He's working on it.
Our engineer, he's working on that thing with your TV set on a new thing, a little antenna
thing.
He's got a part coming over there from Bob McKay's record.
He's going to pull it out of there and stick it in there someday to get to round it.
Here are these.
And the best part of it is these are all very simple things.
I mean, these are things so simple and so basic that a child could ask the questions, you
know?
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello?
Hello, Neil.
Clear up something for me.
Which one is Nick?
Oh.
If he's a little tiny one or the little tiny one?
No, he's got the little tiny one.
He's the one with the blonde here.
There's five kids in the group and there's only one with blonde here.
Just like the other guy said before, he's the blonde kid Nick Carter.
That's him.
Isn't there two blonde kids?
He's not interested in you.
No, there's no two blonde kids in a group.
Okay, sir.
Sorry.
You lose.
Better go do your backseat boys homework.
Okay?
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60.
There's nothing worse than a bunch of screamers.
Just like that concert I was up there in West Palm and you really got pneumonia up there.
And Woody Grayburn's Carl Skyanthethy.
That grotesque place.
Nothing worse than a bunch of screaming queens.
Oh, gee, I just want to see those five beautiful boys.
And I wanted to dig a hole in the ground and crawl in there and never come out again.
Only that we wished that they were beautiful and I might have agreed with them.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
That would have been 98 degrees.
That would have said, how are you talking, sweetheart?
Stop being such a flamer, okay, pal.
Here's a lady in Pemberpine.
Hello.
Hi, I'm kind of confused here.
Maybe you can't.
What are you confused about, man?
I'm confused because you complain about people not getting anything done and promising
you things and people that have no money.
But you, on the other hand, have the means to do things and have plenty of money.
Why don't you just go out and buy tickets yourself?
Because you are no tickets available.
Oh, they have ticket brokers.
Have always have tickets.
You just don't want to sell at the dough if you love them.
That's why I'm a cheap skit.
Well, we all know that, but I don't understand why you just want to sell at the money yourself.
Because I was promised a ticket.
Does somebody promise you free tickets?
Are you going to go out and buy them?
No, but you should know.
No, if you had to make a dollar in the back of somebody promised you 50 million dollars.
They say that you know no one's going to do anything.
So why put your trust in these people?
I don't.
You have to blame.
You have to be.
I'm not at all the blame.
And as much as I like them, I'm not spending $2,000 for a pair of tickets to go see them.
Well, then that's what you got to do.
You got to sometimes you got to do what you don't want to do.
Why don't you send a video tape to fanatic?
You ever think of that?
Do what?
A video tape to fanatic.
For back street boys.
Get yourself on a video tape.
Oh, yeah, right.
Why don't you do that?
No, because they're ugly.
They're ugly.
I'll do it for 98 degrees.
Okay.
What about in sync?
Oh, God.
There was breakfast.
I didn't even eat any.
You know something.
There was a match made in heaven that new single they got with Gloria Estefan.
Instinct and Gloria Estefan.
Oh, is that that's a perfect match made in purgatory?
A group and a young lady who couldn't sing their way, not so young lady.
Couldn't sing their way to a paper sack.
If you stuck a gun in there.
Correct them.
Oh, is that a great match?
Instinct.
Now, sweetheart, maybe you want to spend $1,000 a ticket?
Go ahead.
Be my guest.
I don't think so.
I'll pass.
I'll pass.
So 5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Two 300 open lines for there in our seven minutes to go to the Hancockberg show.
With the Jimmy, we could be special Johnson at five o'clock.
Killed he'll be out there.
So I guess he's decided to do that routine on a home games.
I guess whatever that's all about.
He's going to be out there being the doing the pregame show.
Or I guess I'm assuming since it's at right here at the National Rentals Yanta Center
before the Panther Recipesion Game with a Bruins, which we'll have the night for you.
With the great jigs, McDonald's, going out of the game.
We'll be on Waxi, the entire game.
It'll only be on from 7 to 9 p.m. here on QAM because 9 o'clock we got to go to the Marlin
Arizona Dyna backskate.
We're pretty embarrassed by it.
We're putting that game on surf on 15, 80 tomorrow.
Jack Mark's station.
How do you like that?
Here's a mobile in Miami B.
Chill out.
Hello, okay.
Hear me?
Yes, sir.
I hear you.
I do, I'm Neil.
Okay.
I call her a long time, Julio.
You know, you like WhisMiguet like her that, do you?
I love WhisMiguet.
Have you heard of this Alejandro Fernandez?
No.
Oh, man.
Maybe your producer has something there, but he's good.
No, never heard of it.
No, there he is.
Nobody here ever heard him.
Oh, he's great boy.
He's having.
Take my advice and listen to one of these songs.
Okay.
All right, Chenyar.
Okay.
Have a good one.
How do you...
Alejandro Schwartz, I don't know what he said.
But this don't start that we don't have it anyway.
If we had it, I'd listen to it.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
600 open lines.
Do we have any more tickets to give away?
No.
No.
And as far as some young bitch call in here, give me a lecture again.
This is getting really ponderous, you know?
Getting lectured by these righteous women out there who are the first ones to free load.
Any goddamn thing they can get?
The worst.
You notice how many women I had in the first to 40 minutes after I mentioned a hockey game this morning?
Usually, we don't get that many women in the whole show every day on this show.
But once we got something to give away, all of a sudden they're all coming out of the woodwork.
They're all so friendly and they love me.
Not that the tickets are gone.
Now they're calling to bitch me out.
Because I'm a cheap prick and I don't want to spend 45 grand to go see the guy named Backstreet Boys.
Here's a four-letter deal, huh?
Hey, Dale.
Yes, sir.
I know how we can put the FHB out of business.
Yeah.
Nobody goes feeding for about a year.
And everybody will go out of business.
Yeah, good point.
Hey, you know how I did.
Did you slow down?
Did you see the Perng Green show last week when he was in coming with the Flamingo?
Yeah, and that was a repeat, I really sat.
Oh, I didn't see that.
I just started writing this and he started talking about it.
He is running here.
The guy in the show that heard that, uh, uh,
heard Backstreet, we're on the track, eh?
Mm-hmm.
That's my man in front of me.
That's my man in front of me.
Hey, I love your show, Dale.
Have a good day.
See ya.
I missed the show last night.
Did you see it?
Was it a repeat or something?
Repeat.
Oh, a clip show of all the old stuff like the Dead Guy.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I forgot.
Thank God.
Because I forgot all about it.
How could I forget about the Time Green show Thursday that's all you live for is the Time Green
show.
So thank God it was a repeat again.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Let's call up Neal and bitch him up for being such a cheap bastard.
Let him go spend his own goddamn money for tickets and stop up being such a jackass.
Okay?
Good point.
Excellent points, sweetheart.
Yeah, I'm real cheap.
Just ask anybody that I buy all those goddamn meals for not to mention any names.
What a cheap bastard I am.
Of course they aren't always the best.
They stuck.
Yeah, right.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T.
I can't say that anymore.

as much as I like the Back Speed Boys,
I must confess that such a large number of their fans
are not just young girls, neurotic young girls.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's Weston.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you today?
Great.
I got a couple things for you.
First of all, that woman was only upset with you because you gave away all the hockey tickets
before she can get any.
Yeah.
And, ah, in yesterday's paper,
did you happen to see the article by Jose Lambert,
the naked truth about browse undercover cops?
Jose Lambert, yes.
Here's all the article.
That was the same article that had the Erich Sanchez at Kinziathing.
No, okay.
Just want to see if you saw it.
Yes.
That's all I have.
Okay, thanks.
That's a great day.
Okay, don't do as we do, do as we say, but that's the same old tire thing
that nobody out there cares above.
You've been conditioned to it, just like all the shootings,
just like all the blood and guts in the dines
and the kid's unstretched.
You've been conditioned to it,
and you accept it.
And there's nothing I can do to change it.
You accept it, you know, better you than me.
That's all I can tell you.
This is not a way for civilized people to live.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
So when are you going to give away those backstreet boys' tickets?
They're calling for that now.
You can't say the word tickets without them presuming that it is them.
Now who's them?
Them, them.
Who's the name female?
A female.
No, straight men are calling for backstreet boys.
I don't have to start that crap again.
Who else?
Female.
How do you like that?
Women calling in for backstreet.
Okay, we got 10 pair of tickets for the December 5th backstreet boys concert.
First 10 callers here.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Not.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
There's the line 8 syndrome.
Okay, let's hear it.
Get in some relaxion on that phone system.
Are we around this joint?
No, we're not.
No.
Not can any action on anything.
We're getting some lip service.
Because one thing about this place, baby.
Everybody in this place, they have not only one, but they've got two sets of red.
That's right.
That's why I get a lot of lip service.
Not much else.
Just talk.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's the mobile in for Lauderdale.
Hello.
Neil, I bet you got women that call on a source.
Turned hot right into a vagina.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 while you out on Opel and pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
They got this good blue stuff they sell at the drugstore.
Kills crabs, too.
Here's the Pemberk pie and tell her.
I think I'd look at that that I'm not on that line 8, I guess.
Anyway, one to tie it first off.
You know why the hurricanes are so terrible.
Look at the word it is.
It's in Miami itself.
Any other school in this country is so much better than that.
Would you agree?
What does that mean?
Well, I mean, what does anything mean that you just said?
Look at the neighborhood.
It's Miami.
Of course, the school is going to be terrible and everything like that.
Who said the school was terrible?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about this yesterday.
What is sucking call?
Is that what this is?
I think the answer very clearly is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're boring, sir.
You're terminal.
See, there's nothing to me.
Well, I won't say there's nothing, but there are a few things in the world worse than me.
Then people are just want to repeat back like a periket, like a mine of birds.
Just repeat back what you've already said, just to ingratiate themselves and suck around.
Enough of the sucking pal.
Has nothing to do with the neighborhood.
You have him stands on its own.
Regardless of where you put it, it stands on its own.
It is what it is.
It's La La land for sport little rich kids.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line.
And like I said, the sports nerds at those dolphin games who thought that just because I was at a dolphin game,
naturally, I wanted to yent it with them about the hurricane.
Those people need a lot of bottomies, man.
Oh, what a breath of fresh air.
It is to be able to sit at home and watch in peace of the games without being in the middle of that crowd.
And they got their headsets on.
They're with their Sony Walkman and they're like, well, you're right there on the 50 yard line.
What in the world could you possibly need a headset when you were in a goddamn ballgame for?
Unless you don't understand what the hell is going on.
What is that all about?
Here's a mobile and crawl spring.
Hello?
I didn't call for tickets to the back door boys concert.
But I was just going to give my way too.
I was, that's okay.
Maybe next time.
Hey, you know, the thing with the shootings in Texas.
Well, one of the most absurd things that exists in this wonderful banana republic of ours is the fact that
if you wanted to buy a bottle of wine from the state of California and have it shipped into you,
the liquor distributors have banded together to buy off a sufficient number of state legislators to make that crime a felony.
Whereas if you want to go out and buy yourself a nice 38 special, there's no problem with buying that and having it shipped into the state.
And the rationale that they use for it is that they don't want kids to be able to buy liquor online.
So you know that this stops every 15-year-old from buying a $75 bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon to get his date wasted so he can get in her knickers.
But God forbid they should prevent a kid from buying a 38 special that he needs to protect himself in school.
Just another case of the gun lobby having everybody in their brother in their toilet.
Forget about 5 mail, those kids in Denver were two young to buy cigarettes or two young to buy a bottle of beer,
but they rolled them off to buy a gun.
Yeah, I'm American, I've been way, man.
Well, and supposedly this guy in Texas bought his guns at a flea market.
Great, great, great society we live in isn't it?
By the way, I'd like to point out to you, including this next upcoming break, we're still running spots.
It is done, sure, even after the slaughter we had in Fort Worth, we don't have the common decency to, you know, like most anyplace else where the postpone those spots or the cancel over something like that.
And that shows spots?
That's weak.
On our horror station, okay, sir. God bless you.
Take care.
Head for the hills.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T.
I mean, it just, it's just mind boggling to me the fact that screw and winek stood here this morning with a real pasty look on her voice acting like she really was concerned about these things that I was asking about that I was upset about that we need to do something about and I told her and did anything whatsoever happened in the last three hours in eight minutes.
No, no, nothing.
This is the place where time stands still.
And our program director who's got the best of intentions and the talk should would game the problem is everybody laughs at him nobody pays any attention to him.
So I can talk to him about 50 million things and he can have his little checklist and tell me about oh this one's working on this and that one's working on Uranus and so on and so forth.
It means nothing.
It means nothing.
They're not calling for those tickets, right?
Please tell me now.
You haven't been watching and that's what they're calling for WQA am ticket central.
Hi, I want to talk about the back shoe boys.
Yes, I don't want to take it so.
Okay, what do you want to say?
I want to talk about AJ.
Yeah, video and Tom Green.
Yes.
Is that cool?
You're on now.
I think that AJ should be replaced by Tom Green.
What do you think of that?
Oh, there's John penis and why is that way to hang on a second?
Why is Todd Drek standing in the background?
Is this a new vlog director like that we got here?
John penis and Todd Drek, like everything's a big joke.
If you buy spots on this station and want you to know that our sales department considers a big joke, I just heard a rumor by the way that those two are going down to laugh and that's the rumor.
That's why they're not taking care of any spots.
That's how it always is.
Guys start slacking off when you're leaving and moving to another joint.
Probably those two guys that enjoy the two live Jews that are mid days on laughing.
They're the ones that are starting that crap because anybody that even planned on staying in their job couldn't possibly slack off even in this joint like they are.
And what were you saying?
I'm sorry.
Hello.
Hi.
Yes, I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
I think Tom Green should replace AJ.
No.
Why?
Because they would make a mockery, would make a farce.
As much as I love Tom Green, that video about his bum and his duty.
Yeah, I agree that was really stupid.
That was really, and too long too.
But what's up with AJ and we're in Britney Spears shirt on this video?
You've seen the video, right?
So what's wrong with that?
What's going on with that?
He's jealous and addicted, which he's already got a girlfriend, you know?
Who?
AJ.
AJ, I know.
I know who she is.
Yeah.
Who man, if she's in his mother group.
And?
No, I'm just saying.
I don't like what is so good about the backshort boys that you love them so much.
Then why are you worried about what's shirt AJ is wearing?
What difference does it make?
No, it doesn't make a difference at all.
Okay, Tom, thank you.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T Rival Slime.
I have to like their music.
I know all these other things about the shirts that they wear and about Nick's toe and about his hair.
I don't care about any of that.
None of them are in the least bit interesting to me in that way.
Not even marginally, not minimally.
Not even a little teeny-weeny.

which proves that some ran and they're also one of the backstreet boys concert
when it comes to this place it's like a disease it's like everybody they bring
in here if they were here is that they stick around that's why
scotch works got out before we got infected

sooner or later
big giant things are going to start protruding out of your cheeks
and your back to
very sad it's just amazing to watch the way that he's just gone downhill and
downhill it's trance it's like watching the uh... depot it's like watching the

she played it on the phone you know she's holding the phone up to her uh thing
i'm really about you know you you silly little uh-women man it's very sad
you don't like their music you're obsessed with them and of course the thing about

it's the lost battle because uh about three calls before the guys as well uh you know i i don't
say it's the right thing to do but yeah like why would anybody bring that up what
the hell is that got to do it is though they had it coming or something and unbelievable but that's
the way that's there's that's the people out there nowadays and there's more than then uh
well i like it like it ain't big joke you know and like i said the other day
now while we've been saying that for years the public has so desensitized these things
that now that a few hours have gone by uh nobody even cares about it anymore it's just another one
of those news stories that makes for a little news for a couple hours you're right and as far as
the 13 minute break that station i swear they advertise for the hurricane and the effort uh
fm you gain two days after the game last week yeah you know where they have to get the last
the every last set well you see we can't get all the spots in before the games we probably have
to run them on the game is over telling you they advertise stuff after the after the fact we'll have a
nice day i'm back to it five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line
you think we're ever going to get a real phone system up here no that's probably why i'm taking
off yeah i'll tell you one thing our program director has got some real hoots but you know some real
nerve she's got some real nerve to be telling me that you know uh you know it would be hypocritical

Oh I'm just worn out I'm just this has been a draining experience especially
hearing that instinct thing over the phone.
See they've been ecasing and you're way back in the other room there.
Oh it's great yeah.
See you told me they suck they suck sweetheart.
They're grotesque they're nauseating I hope they allay low but glory as Stefan and
a rugby husband.
Here's a mobile in four-lotterdale hello.
Mobile in four-lotterdale.
Sounds like he's got the phone in his rectum.
Okay sorry about that.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line.
Let's try Kendall hello.
Hi Neil how are you okay sir.
I have to agree if you backstreet boys are much cuter but instinct.
I think they were cuter.
Well I think they are.
Who cares if they're cute.
I know but instinct they have they just don't have a look you know.
They suck they can't sing.
I know okay sweetheart they can't sing but you up and call us out when you do.
Okay two calls left on the board and we got 14 minutes to kill I guess I can play 98 degrees
a couple of times.
I do think I might 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 kind of bring the shortaway screech
in halt.
Here's Miami hello.
Neil.
Yes sir.
Hey how you doing okay.
That was the backstreet boy that you played a couple segments ago right.
Yes.
I can't believe I'm saying this but I actually like that song I thought it was pretty good.
Larger than life yeah it's a good song.
You know the video is real good.
Well the problem I have with groups like them and like especially boys to men.
Who the hell likes boys to men.
I don't know so like 98 degrees I can't stand these sappy stoop of love balance that they do
there.
Yeah.
Like those melodramatic ones where they look at each other and they make the faces you know it's
the most contrived crap I've ever heard.
I don't know how anybody can not like I do any red blood at the head of a sexual guy
wouldn't like I do because the Dorito girl is in there like with her big gigantic melons hanging
out.
But there's something in there for everybody.
I haven't seen a video that I believe in.
That's you.
I would be singing a different tune believe me even George loves that video he could do
it out the music part but he likes the video trust me.
Okay and also about the spots on that what videos are supposed to be for a little bit tit
alighting if I can say that.
Exactly.
About the spots I agree that the spots on Hank's show are unbelievably long.
But one of the reasons I think you're so successful is that your spots are shorter and you
do those songs afterwards.
It's like I want to hear those spots because I don't want to miss the tune after you know what I mean.
So maybe Hank's there playing some bits exactly after those 13 in fact if he played his cards
right after a 13 minute break and played a couple of bits then he'd never have to say anything
but hello and goodbye.
Or even do the farting noises in the spot like that's great.
I laugh when I hear that that's why I listen to your spots.
And then don't forget about those great gun show spots.
Exactly but you know what's the purpose when I listen to Hank's show I sit there and I
I don't want to sit through the spots first of all I go and listen to any kind of
divita by my own butterfly and come back.
Let's just go to the right timing yeah.
They're doing the sports that they can help.
In fact when they could listen to any kind of divita and MacArthur's park back to back.
Exactly but we know I sit there like a man because I go you know what if they had competition
they better be glad they don't have competition.
That's right.
Where's no yeah.
Yeah they've been lucky enough for and I hope they get their act together and realize
that they're turning people off.
Okay.
Alright let's see.
Well that's what happens when you step into a bucket of what he said.
Right.
And that's Greg Reed you know he thinks he pretends he knows something because he
lucked out here because he was able to buy everybody.
Spending other people's money you know when you spend the uh
easily his money and his wife's money you can buy anybody you want.
The only problem is did he spend the money wisely?
No.
Because he gave the money to Wayne and John Henry enormous millions of dollars
that I said are choking his place unbelievably they're gagging on it.
They're gagging on it.
This place is building more than any station in the market by far.
We're building millions and millions and millions and they and still we're just fearless.
That's why when it comes payday we got to see if the little squiggles are in the
bottom of the check to see if it's okay to take it to the bank or not.
That's why George is still waiting for his bonus from the spring rating book.
Now that we're rolling to the summer book of course it's almost over.
He's waiting for the bonus from the spring book and so are a lot of other people.
So let me say it again God bless Norm Kent because we wouldn't have ridden the
and the written it in gold in platinum in my contract.
We'd be running 85 minutes a spot an hour here
and I would also get my bonus whenever it felt like it but you see
the one thing let me tell you this and this is the truth.
Mark this down okay just like Wayne like Baldi told you only in this case it's the truth.
The only way that you can get these people to do anything is if you have it written in
in platinum in pure platinum it's the only way.
If it isn't written down if you can't threaten them with a lawsuit and hold it over them legally
they'll just look at you and like oh well we'll get around it.
We'll buy a lot because that's their number one expertise the area of expert is lying.
They lie like champions and why the hell not practice makes perfect.
And then if you say that they're a bunch of liars they get a real uptight and
psychotic and oh they're indignant how dare you say it like it is.
