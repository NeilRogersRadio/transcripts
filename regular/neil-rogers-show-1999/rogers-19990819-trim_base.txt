Now, Neil Rogers on Sport Radio 560 QAM.
OK, I was in the car about a half an hour ago listening to you.
First of all, Nick Carter has more talent than his right code than you will ever have.
And he's not a pineapple head, he's still a big fat baguette.
I had a chip name pay.
One day she flew away to T.O. on a where the moon is blue.
But with our right wing censorship, there are words that mustn't slip.
Do we tell you how I feel for K.A.
So, if you see K.A.
If you wanna, they'll see you in T.O. on a tune.
Now if you see K.A.
Tell her I'm a service day.
And the FCC won't let me sing this.
So I'm not supposed to say how if you see K.A.
Take her hand gently say, that after this transmission, I'll be out in 90 days old.
If you see K.A.
And you wanna, then I'll see you in T.O.
On a go, on a go, on a go, on a go, on a go.
I'm gonna make it cool.
So anyway, that bitch that called yesterday, she's a star now.
Okay, I was in the car about a half an hour ago listening to you.
First of all, Nick Carter has more challenge in his right toe than you ever had.
And he's not a pineapple head, he's still a big fat baguette.
Yeah, so what's your point, honey?
Oh, yesterday on the show we had two calls that, and that was one of them,
that were just so astonishing and so amazing, everything that's wrong with the human race,
and everything that's wrong with talk radio.
First of all, her, which he doesn't have any idea what she's talking about.
I talked to Nick on the phone last night, by the way, and he said, you were an ugly slut, is what he said.
And he wouldn't touch you, he wouldn't touch you with Kevin's hand.
But at any rate, boy.
And the best part of it is that she was in tears and hysterical when she first called it, which George said.
She was like losing it.
And then the second call, which I think preceded, that that was right toward the end of the show yesterday, the psychotic bitch.
And you got, by the way, Nick said, you got no change.
And in any case, it's the same diddle.
But the other call that came earlier in the show, and it's again a classic example of what goes on.
And then of course, a lot of people will pretend to be talk show people, will let this stuff go on the year and they'll pursue it, and they'll, you know, some wild rumour.
It was a guy sounded like dark, complex to me.
I don't want to give him that dark, complex to business, but he sounded like dark, complex to me.
The caller giving us the breathless news that he just saw on Channel 10 News about the school teacher that's been charged in the sex case with a 14 year old boy and all these other kids and a cocaine and the car and all these things, all of these things.
And assuming, of course, assuming it with, even though he only heard a little piece, assuming it was one of the teachers in the array in the second on the, what you call it clubs on the swing clubs.
And I said, well, I really find it hard to believe and when you find out a little bit more, when you know what you're talking about, call us back, click and that was the end of the call.
And of course, he never did call us back and come to find out with this.
Was this teacher from the Silverlake's Middle School, was she one involved in the other thing?
No.
No, she was not.
But again, that's the kind of irresponsible jackasses.
Thank you so much, Tommy, that you know, we'll call up a talk show and just, blah, blah, blah, blah.
And don't know what they're talking about.
In fact, I guarantee you, if you listen to the talk shows, any talk show, this station, any station, 90% of the people are calling having got any idea what they're talking about.
So it's up to the host, the middle man, the PIMP.
It's up to us to like try to, you know, referee in between and figure out who might actually know what they're talking about, which this guy did not.
In fact, are you all an apology?
But you do have to understand that this is also part of the American way.
The assumption is automatic.
The assumption is absolutely automatic that if somebody is, you know, involved in some kind of a sexual scandal, then any other sex story that comes down to PIC, it must be them.
Swing clubs, oh yeah, well, she must have been doing 14-year-old kids, students, et cetera, and so on.
Were we right?
No.
No, sorry.
Sorry, pal.
Sorry, am I misinformed, dark, and plucking, listening friend.
Boy, were you expecting me to eat this stuff, by the way?
Huh?
Oh my god.
Seriously, this isn't a joke, isn't it?
I might try the tomato.
Oh, no, god.
Oh yeah, straight in the old bucket. Are you kidding me?
Just say, it put it in the bucket. That's what I say.
Man, you don't think I would eat that crap?
Yeah, my dog wouldn't eat that.
But thanks for the effort anyway.
I'm not going to say anything about it, not yet.
Unless, of course, that is, I don't get those dolphin tickets.
Where is Fat Boy, why the way with those tickets?
You wouldn't supposed to bring me today?
You know, this is the kind of crap that goes on in this place.
Here is a guy that, generally speaking, we're not too fond of the beginning with.
At least, George hates him like poison. I don't care.
He's a little bit of fun during the hockey season with his sabers bull crap, you know?
Because he reminds me of Rick Jenner-Wetpy for Lost the Weight and the Suspenders.
And he comes limping in here, you know, Fat Boy.
But came in here begging for the dolphin buffalo bills tickets today that I had my season tickets
sitting here, those primo seats that I got and my purple preferred parking pass.
And he, oh, I'll pay for him, whatever you want.
And without even batting an eyelash, being the great guy that I am, I just reached into the potpile.
I pulled off the dolphin bills tickets.
I reached into my parking pass, then there, pulled out the parking pass.
Here you go, Fat Boy. I don't mind any money for it. Here you go.
Because I happen to be a great guy.
I asked this fat putt wacker for a little bit of a favor.
For a guy who works out there at MIA, one of my porter friends out there at the airport who practically beg me,
hasn't been a dolphin game in about 100 years, wants to go to a game.
I said, hey, I'll work on it. No problem after all.
We're the dolphin station.
Okay, Pally, whatever you need. Well, okay, Pally.
That's Fat Boy, okay?
On two legs.
And not walking too well these days either kind of waddling sideways.
Must be those rock trips to Hylia.
That must be what's getting to him.
So we're in Halemaay tickets, Fat Boy.
And by the way, that stuff in a waist pass, can I? I'm serious.
That's...
Oh my God.
And you're eating it. That's the worst part.
I'm pulling the meat out of it.
Yeah.
The bread is really stale.
And what?
How can you achieve that?
That is the worst crap that has ever come into this building.
It is.
We could bring stuff from the dumpster, you know,
where the old parts are in a condo building next door.
We could bring stuff from their dumpster that's been there since last year,
and I guarantee you that it'll be a fresher and probably tastier than that swill
that you've got on that plate right now.
I wouldn't consider touching that.
And anyway, so we got this story, and I'm sure that probably somewhere out in
Radio Land there will be, you know, this reminds me of the story in the New England, wasn't it?
In Boston, where the teacher, remember she had the 14 or 15-year-old kid,
and he killed her husband because, yeah, because they were madly in love,
and she said, hey, it'll be a good idea to get him out of the way.
Okay, whatever you say, honey.
And then of course, in Seattle, wasn't it up there somewhere in a great Northwest,
in the Northeast, in the Northwest?
That's where they got the problems.
Up there in a great Northwest, we had the school teacher, and they put her in the slimer
for Dillon with the minor, and then they let her out, and she's Dillon again.
And every time she gets out on probation, they're Dillon again.
Now, the sad part about this one, I mean, the whole story is really sick.
Hollywood resident Beth Friedman was charged with three counts of indecency in the salt.
They haven't found her yet, by the way.
She's supposed to be turning herself in, but as of the morning news this morning,
I like the news stations. She hadn't turned herself in yet.
Three counts of indecency in the salt, two counts of unlawful sexual activity with the minor,
and one kind of contributing to the delinquency of a child.
And we'll get into the whole story here because it's really sorted and grotesque.
But I bet you that somebody out there will probably defend it.
Somebody who also finds it disgusting and nauseating that the adults went to the swim club
with other adults behind closed doors and private.
And by the way, remind me during the break to tell you about my call from Rome Kent yesterday,
who didn't hear my comments on the air, obviously, about how great it would be if he did some lowering on some of the things
that I asked him to do like months ago, because he was too busy talking to MSNBC,
that they wanted him to be on the air to discuss this swim club thing.
Oh, God. You know, it must be nice to be famous, right, Norm?
It must be nice to be famous and the desk that we wanted to talk about stuff that...
Nine minutes after 10 at 5.60 WQM yesterday, they're on the weathertownest that,
even though we haven't had a big hurricane here yet this year,
it's looking really grim between now and the end of hurricane season.
Oh, you actually put some of that in your mouth?
Look at that. George found the basket. Uh-oh!
Oh, yeah.
How you airing shit like this?
Where's my soup?
There's Chicago, right at the same end,
you put it up with this one last hand now.
Did she forgot what the map was?
She's been using the best of those it can see now.
Stupid, stupid, stupid idiotic!
She's been using any gun till we want to rope that it see now.
And she will run, run, run, give a bonus and I'll pick her away.
Oh, my God, do the photos, do the videos.
Well, we thought all of them up and then he started getting wise and she never died.
Now she acted so fine and since she made her picture fine,
she was thinking there's a real result she was down.
But that's just on to me,
or any pictures you put in for some photos.
Go now!
Hey, I will run, run, run, give a bonus and I'll pick her away.
Go run, give a bonus and she will run, run, run, give a bonus and I'll pick her away.
15 to 560 WCM.
By the way, just remember all your kids out there, the American F and W maybe.
It's not so bad to get blown away,
but it's real evil to get blown.
Just keep that in mind.
So anyway, getting back to this story,
teacher charged in teen sex case,
police issue warrant for arrest Hollywood.
Already consumed by a messy ethical misconduct case involving two,
not one, but kind of two-broward county youth teachers.
School board officials were dealt another crisis, another blow.
Can we say that?
No!
On Wednesday, when state prosecutors charged a silver-like middle school teacher
with having sex with one of her students.
Hey!
Hollywood resident, Beth Friedman 40.
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
One more.
Oh!
Was charged with three counts of indecent assault, two counts of unlawful sexual activity
with a minor, and one kind of contributing to the delinquency of a child.
All but the last count are felonies that carry a maximum sentence of up to 15 years each.
If she's convicted, said Sergeant Roni Mangins,
spoke to the spokesman for the Hollywood Police Department.
Police issued a warrant for arrest as a late-wend, and this morning,
Friedman did not turn herself into Hollywood police.
The charges follow an investigation of Friedman that began after a parent filed
a complaint against her, and the June 13 complaint, the parent's son told police that he started having sex
with Friedman two years ago when he was 14.
Boy!
And in her seventh grade class.
Police had that the relationship ended in June when the teen was 16.
Because of his age, police would not disclose the names of the parent or the student.
Although his mother was on the, with the face not shown this morning,
looking very anorexic this morning.
On the Channel 7 news.
Which I don't watch, by the way, but I did see it.
Silverlite's middle principal William Bell said,
Friedman, a Spanish teacher at the North Lauderdale School,
resigned in August 4th, he declined to comment further.
Broward County School District spokesman Joe Don Zele said,
Friedman did not have contact with the students after the June 13 complaint,
school-edged June 17th, how convenient.
One former student of Friedman expressed disbelief on hearing of the charges.
I never really thought that she'd do that because she was always the nicest teacher.
Don't you love hearing those things?
That's what he said.
Oh yeah, right, that's what the other kid said too.
She was so nice. God was she nice.
Huh?
Well, there's a great land in here which I'll get to.
But it's always like Ted Bundy, he was such a nice guy, you know?
Yeah, seriously.
God, these were such nice people.
David Berkowitz, my god, a mild-mannered guy.
Larry King's got his tongue still stuck in his back dome.
Anyway, I never really thought she'd do that because she was always the nicest teacher
said Rachel Abbott, who was an eighth grader at Silverlite's middle last year.
She was different than the other teachers. She let people bring candy and chewing gum and stuff.
She let people bring candy. How do you like that, huh?
Oh, I'll get to it. I'll find it out here somewhere. What was her favorite line?
One on a lot of top, little boy.
She was different than the other teachers. It says she let people bring candy and chewing gum and stuff
and you can tell her anything.
She tried to have fun with the kids that said.
And evidently, they agreed.
Yes.
Only one problem with the wilder, a lot of problems with it because we get into the drugs and the car and all the other stuff.
But there's one question she should have been asked.
How young is two youngs?
David Bolgan shots a four-letter day attorney representing treatment that she walked into his office on Wednesday requested representation.
I'm not going to count on the specifics of this case to live an opportunity to look at what the state has.
He says, I can only confirm that I will represent her assuming she needs it.
And guess what, David? She needs it.
The charges came one day after the school board voted to suspend.
And it goes on to think about the teachers with a swing club as if somehow that's got some relationship, which of course it does not.
But the word sex is involved there. So naturally, everybody's up in arms.
School official space, a similar case in 1997 when two Piper High coaches were charged with having sex with a 15-year-old student in 1995.
15.
How young is two youngs?
Okay, marijuana. We're not too upset about that. I actually see N.C. King. Are we upset about that?
Yes.
Two other teens who gave statements said they received drugs and gifts from Friedman.
One youth associated with Friedman was given a car, which I think this is the one that they were talking about, but they don't know that in the Sun Sentinel.
Police said.
Parents of another teen said they think they're also had sex with Friedman. They intend to pursue the matter.
Residents of Emerald Oaks, the condominium complex where Friedman lived, said adolescent boys frequently stayed the night at Friedman's house, said Hollywood police detective Kurt Navarro.
M.M. Franco, president of the Emerald Oaks condominium association, said two adolescent boys, and another woman thought to be in her 40s, lived at Friedman's home for several months until June.
The condominium board told Friedman they had to move her out because they were not related to her. She had to move them out. When it got moved them out.
If these allegations are true, I'm sorry for her and I'm sorry for the kids, Franco said, but I'm especially sorry for the school system.
It's another black eye for them, another slap in the pus for them.
She tried to have fun with the kids is what it said. She succeeded. Yeah, she succeeded.
Navarro said a 19 year old man recently told him that he had sex with Friedman three years ago, which would have made him 16, also a minor of course.
She ought to move to Pennsylvania. The minors are big there, like in Pittsburgh.
Police suspect other former students had similar relationships with the teacher and asked at any moment of information, contact investigators with a number here, which you can get in the newspaper.
So there you go. There's the story. There's the story of a lovely lady. I mean, I mean, here we go. A 40 year old teacher. She did a little with 14 and 15 and 60 year old, 16 year old students and given them drugs and buying the kid cars.
I guess maybe when she bought the one kid a car and he was like 14 or 15 because I think all 14 year old kids out there need a car. You know what I'm saying? Yeah.
I mean, you know, it's never too early to have one because sooner or later it'll be legal for you to drive it or even just drive it, you know, just for practice until you get your license.
And evidently he was driving in a lot and a car too.
What a great story.
Yeah. To these are the kind of people. If it were me, if you just asked me, I found out that all these allegations were substantiated, of course, which would take about five minutes, I guess.
I would say, okay, 15 years on each count sounds about right to me. What other 10 counts? 150 years sounds real good to me.
Doesn't that give you great confidence?
And doesn't it also make you wonder how the parents can be like so oblivious? Oh, yeah, schoolteacher because we know they make all that big money.
And all school teachers, I know what I was going to school all the teachers were buying all the kids cars. Very commonplace.
Was it? No. Sure. Corvette XKE's ML kind of good stuff.
Here's a call in Miami. Hello. Me. I don't. Yes, sir. Yeah. Come. Come away from that.
If you saw the news last night, all the weathermen, including your Don, no, are having orgasms on the TV because they got too tropical depression.
Oh, no. Yeah. One just came off of Africa and they're already jumping up and now saying it's not the top of a storm later on.
Yeah. And it's all. Why is it that so many of the problems we have originate in Africa? You know, then they run to two weeks away from us.
Uh-huh. And they're now saying, well, have you ever noticed that? There's so many of the things that devastate this country. They start in Africa.
I'm telling you. And then they went up over here. They worked their way west. Yeah.
They're like they're jumping up and down. They're just getting on us. This guy is falling. This guy is falling. Yeah. I mean, they're just jumping up and down.
I'm surprised that Don, because he's easily the level-headed one. Maybe they're just desperate for ratings on Channel 10.
He was even surprised because I never watched him. He was the first story in last night's news on Channel 10.
Yeah. Show more in the tropics. Oh my God. Oh well.
Okay. Well, band down a hatches, Pat.
Yeah. Take it easy.
And if that boy comes knocking out the door, kick his ass out. Where is my dolphin tickets, Mr. Ratton's the fun?
Oh, boy. He has something. I told you. I will not do that commercial. We've already passed the word along to him.
I will not advertise for places that provide food that the dish out food like that. Okay. That is inedible. That's the third three stripes in your out. Okay. You're out.
You've had it. T bonito.
So I need to do is associate my name with a place like that where we're throwing the food in the waste basket and people are like barfing their guts out here.
Nice going, Pat. Boy, you know how to find them. See you in high-lea, sweetheart.
Yeah. When you're going to get that, you want on here. Maybe you can get a trade-out.
It is on here. Oh, like I said, he's probably got one.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
I'm going to be on the POM 5, 60 on a mobile one line. Come on. Let's get pissed off and part up today, huh?
Let's get that girl I called yesterday. She owes me an apology. The schwarz who I called in yesterday trying to tie this teacher this bet-freedman and say that she was the one for he owes her an apology.
Michael Mayo. He still owes Dave Halberstam an apology. It's apology Thursday here at QA and let's go.
And right now we want to apologize for something even though it's not my fault.
Yeah, I want to apologize for that.
2 o'clock this afternoon, hangs out there in San Diego, you know, do an ESPN stuff because we always come second because TV of course is first. I understand that, Humper.
And manages out there so we couldn't have him.
And as desperate as we are and again, Bluff Lindsay put a note in here, he said, please apologize to the care audience for my putting.
On the year today between 2 and 4 30 was bad enough last night, 7 to 10, which I didn't hear.
Although you know something like I've said before the sports nerds, I heard a little bit of Zim for yesterday.
I've always told you this with the sports nerds, it makes no difference who they put on.
They don't have to beg for calls like I do every day here with his great highly rated show.
They don't have to beg for people to have verbal intercourse with them because it's the same bunch of nerds.
What do you think about that linebacker with the biking?
And it's the most unbelievable.
All they need is somebody there to respond, whether it's a monkey, whether it's whatever it is.
Cheers to that.
Yeah, even him, like I said, monkey mouth.
So he'll be on from 2 to 4 30 and we apologize deeply for that.
I mean, that's probably the most embarrassing thing in the history of this radio station.
Then we got Clarence Dero and Orlando Elziger.
He's going to be on after that from 4 30 to 6.
And then we got 6 to 8 hurricane, a hurricane hotline.
And Manditz from San Diego 8 to 10 o'clock tonight, the Mad Dog.
Yeah.
We'll give you a little bit of respect to be back to the radio station 8 to 10 tonight.
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.
I'm crossed by the Mad Dog.
Mobile in Miami. Hello.
Yes, sir. Turn that radio off, sir, because I know it's going to be a short call but nevertheless.
It sounds like one of our chronicleers. Yes.
I have a question for you.
What do you think about these seats that you got suspended because...
Okay, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.
What do you think about Abe Lincoln? Okay, he's got a bad headache too.
Okay, get with the program. Okay, Julio, get with it.
Get a little update. Stick your head into the internet. Just stick your head in there.
Or just stick your head in your neck.
Find out what's going on in the world.
Jackass.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a mobile one.
I'm still waiting for those two apology calls.
And I also end the apology from Sherry and Boca.
Remember Sherry and Boca were discussing lettering a couple of days ago.
Suck it around, suck it around, suck it around, suck it around.
And then hitting me up for back feet boy tickets with that on half-four.
Did she ever call my apology?
No. Straighten the record out. No.
No. God. I'm embarrassed for some of you people are really in.
You're so irresponsible. Your behavior is just so unacceptable.
And then you just run away from it.
Just like Michael Holden-Mail. What a jackass.
Oh there's that ugly Christina Aguilar.
I hate to break the news to you guys, but Lucinda Grip, okay.
She is really grotesque.
26 past 10 at 560 WQAN.

OK.
the story you know it happens it does happen but when we get to them cocaine
part that's when i got upset the marijuana part didn't bother me but the
cocaine part that's where i'd rather love the uh... white line
yeah i mean that this was what what's wrong with her having sex and enjoying
something at all man yeah
this is a matter of course you try to have fun with the kids
that's right this is what we can't do this country for
yeah i think some of the ice and ice behind this
yeah if the problems are
are coming in from uh... africa you know these storms are things that come
in the market and the market and the problem is back to africa okay
but we're gonna work on it today haha haha we're sending all the problems back
to africa is what we're gonna do
because even our dark complex it for a degree that a lot of bad stuff comes
here from africa
five six seven oh five sixty
pound five sixty on the mobile one line
but i have some soup today i can't get rid of cannot this this cold man
can i get rid of this thing this little bit of a raw throat a little scratch
a little bit of a nasal and i know it's how come nobody is coming in that
all week are they trying to be a polite my nose looks like wc fields on a
bad day all red and uh... can you see that not as bad today
so maybe i'm getting a little bit better but that scratchy throughout god
is that annoying or course it could be allergies let's do is a doc in today

so what do you think any other guys out there like to have their teacher going
down on them and doing these things
uh... she's just trying to show the kids a good couple teachers i had that
could have exploited me well i didn't
so
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty and what i see the thing that i find
amazing is that you notice like yesterday
none of the parents call in about any of these things that's why i know that
nobody cares about schools and about education and about your kids really in
general
that nobody calls about any of these things i remember years and years ago
and i was on k a t
we're doing that serious talk that talk in the ninety-year-old parts
and then rustle now of headline news with our pd because she and cedla
then had a real tight relationship
so she was named the pd
and i'm a resader her one day because we have to book our own guest back in
those days and i said you know that i'm going to do a whole show a whole
week of the shows on education this week
and you know what her response why she said
why yeah and give me a look like are you crazy
shows on education especially on that station where the meaning age was death
of our listening audience
those people couldn't even have gummed been injuries back in those days
hello no you used to be such a nice boy
yeah
they couldn't come and you're a bit of it like to write now even if you have no
teeth you can still go and they have been in juries to because it is delicious
god
how young is too young
you put your step foot in now you take your step foot out

all this all you need is to shake it all about
you just do this and make you look like you're insane
if you ever catch me doing it here is
I'll be brave
for the bullets get my brain

polkae

doing the whole get polkae
chase your hope somehow
I'm doing the whole get polkae
doing the whole get polkae
doing the whole get polkae
well he's just shot it very well
please recognize the face up over there man
1045 at 560 WQM
subsidies for all here's a good letter to the editor and one of the papers
this morning I think they're old
I can't tell
Arnold letterer of Pembert Pines writes if our elected representatives think
it's appropriate to spend our much needed tax dollars
so that the owners of sports teams can pay their glamorous athletes
million dollar salary
only trust it out is there any way that owners of other businesses can use
tax dollars to pay employees extraordinary salaries
good question Arnold letterer of Pembert Pines
good letter of course it'll fall on deaf ears
because the sports there is they just we can't do enough for them to build
them play toys so what do you think about bethreadman for a
teacher of the year huh i'm changing my attitude about this we don't know for
sure that she gave them drugs that's just you know let's give her the
benefit of the doubt if we're given Tony Martin the benefit of the doubt
let's give bethreadman the benefit of the doubt
we're pretty sure that she had sex with these kids but like so far it's
unanimous all the young people call into this would say that they would
love to have certain of their teachers although i'm looking at bethreadman
to be honest with you well maybe she looked a little better two years ago
you think so oh what was their uh great what's our everything you know what
what was their great point average how much she has a teacher in
in addition to all this crap now you're starting to confuse it with that
kind of crap okay i'm sure that they had passing grades and what
they were doing with her yeah i'm sure in the beginning they probably
were inexperienced and not saying that they're she's supposed to be teaching
them right she taught him how to perfect their trade the tools of their
trade the creative their tools at that age huh sure there you go
five said we had all the lines pulled up here when we went to the break but
now we're back down to two again is that once again all summer long we've
gone on like this they like to make it a hell of five times harder to do the
show that's okay i'm used to it doesn't phase me in the least
that crappy food is in a waste basket five six seven oh five sixty
pound five sixty on the mobile one line here's plantation hello
warning you yes sir how you doing okay talking about talking about the sports
nerds it never ceases to amazing i agree with you 100 percent that there can be
that many people that can sustain shows that hour after hour i have you and i have
one other call on here now and that's it that's all i got on the board and i
listened to these sports shows on his station and we've got twice as many people
listening as those shows the ratings show at month after month book after book
and yet there is an endless supply of these nerds one after another after another
asking the most in name the most miniscule the most the idiotic things that anybody in the world
could care about and the interesting thing is i've always been interested in sports all my life
but i couldn't care i couldn't care less about listening to the interracuse of every single
thing i over and over and then draft and the on and off it's on the level anyway the main thing i
call about you nailed something yesterday really serious about the other side of education from
this teacher thing and and that's the kids you you pointed something out i never hear anybody
mention and i i do it all the time at the risk of sounding like a racist about hearing the kids on
the corner talk and you couldn't understand the word to get the how come i didn't get a response
to that well you got tried to get it from me but i couldn't get in and i you know i see this all
the time and i think just like you do i think where are these kids going to wind up where are they
going what are they going to do i want to always go into the group and say what do you kids want to
do with your life where do you want to go what do you want to do because it's it's generation
after generation and it's truly serious i mean it's a serious serious subject not everybody can
play professional sports or be a rap star you know i mean it just doesn't work out that way exactly
and as a teacher myself i think to myself when i'm walking to the halls and i'm looking at the kids
and i'm talking to them in there and they're driving and they're shucking and they're doing it and
i'm thinking to myself what are you going to do three years now five can you be you're going to be
on the corner it's going to start all over again right how do we do it better it's not going to
help by screwing the kids screwing the kids yeah but white america loves this man you know i was
thinking yesterday and i forgot to bring it up like donovan baili and all the canadian uh
yeah the runner runner uh if you ever heard him speak he speaks perfect english just like you and
i are speaking now anytime i see black people in the canada of our canadian they speak exactly like
we're speaking uh the hockey players like heaven weeks who used to be uh the backup goalie for
the panthers and peter were real we've had him on the station many many times they speak perfect
english they don't speak bubonics they don't speak with some kind of ghetto dialect
that there this idea this brainwashing the idea that somehow a that black people don't have the
ability to articulate and speak like white people like uh you know real english is bullcrap or b
that somehow uh we're trying to expect them to be like whitey you know like like it's a cultural
thing that we're trying to coerce them to be like god nothing to do with like being like whitey
and has to do with speaking proper english and being able to uh do something in life
i agree with you and i feel very hamstrung about that i think that i'm in a position to do something
about it and i i can't do any more than the people who are in my classes and try to make
make it clear to everybody that everybody needs to have a command of the language and
we got social promotion man is never going to change yeah i understand okay hang in here okay man
good luck here five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line there's a good
guy good teacher who is not having sex with his students come on all new young people out there
you want to have sex with your student with your teachers that's what we want to hear so far to
unanimous they all said actually there's a little more enthusiastic than that they said yeah more like that
five six and joe custell says he would be delighted to have sex with some of the teachers he
had in school he'd be more than delighted in fact if they want to come over right now he's got a
little time on his hand in between or whatever he's doing in there with Igor and he'd be more than
ecstatic never too late to learn is what he said five six seven oh you know i have this
queasy this cold is finally going away i'm just getting over to i think i have this queasy i just
know that any minute now you're going to be hearing that the asshole song i'm telling you
well that's the only long thing i've got believe me trust me when i tell you everything else i've
got is real short but that the asshole song that that goes on for like four and a half minutes
which is more than enough for me being the expert at rushing down the hall
here's hi lia hello a meal yes sir i fall into that category with the the teachers i
have some female teachers in junior high school and high school that i really had big hots for yeah
so i wouldn't mind jumping in bed with them but as far as the cocaine goes or the drugs see
alleged drugs she should be sleeping with the fishes listen i got i got a request can you put on
a chest of field the very best of faggot in the u.s.a. chest of your queens i love that okay how
about you do thanks buddy okay thank you okay we got i smoked two joints it's a lot of smoking
going on in chest of your queens because we better not play either one of those because we don't
want those kids to be like that that dog looking the line bottle or whatever that wasn't i
movie about the diddling mistinkle or whatever that is five six seven oh five sixty maybe that's
what it was maybe this is all a point notice how this came out right at the time that movie is being
released diddling mistingle tingling with mr. freedman yeah how do you like that
now what's your guys name that's in that movie again which i can't think of it damn it that you

sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line so what was uh the cherries last name start with a
sherry from bokeh you mean yeah when i wanted to back to eat boys tickets with i saved her
letter here by the way it's under the pile in fact i got piles just from thinking about where the
hell is your letter sherry god damn it sherry with an s i'll say just a minute i don't think so i
was sherry with an l why you have a letter card a letter or something in there a card it um somebody
diddle with it i don't see it here and i know day more like and throw it away somebody's been in
here diddling with my craft well i hate when that happens man who the hell was in here did i'm
telling you it's gone long gone and did not tell you i was going to save that for posterity
well read the read the card maybe it's her oh yeah that is here that is well you should have
done it was from bokeh how many cherries in bokeh do you think we had that's her okay and she won't
call in because she's too embarrassed here is her little note deer neal listening to your show on
monday i was both hurt and mortified i regret you got such a negative opinion of me i should not have
asked you for tickets for that i truly apologize everything else i said in the letter however i meant
if you took it as a suck up i am obviously not savvy enough to communicate with you with heartfelt
apologies sherry from bokeh oh my god this is oh so emotional now all i need is to apology from
that bitch they call yesterday about Nick Carter from the back street boys who was so far off base
i mean she's on a different planet nice going sherry that's for you sweetheart on both cheeks
say it goes to show you sooner or later i can bring them back to reality sometimes you have to
really pound away at it and work at it just like a bett Friedman says keep working on it keep
pounding it now what she said hey she deserves her day in court and then put her in a slumber for 20
years no i don't know i mean most of this audience so far thinks that the diddler in your teachers
okay the cocaine was the stupid part you know that was the bad part why why wasn't it just good
enough you know well of course wouldn't see that picture what well she doesn't look particularly
attractive okay she doesn't look i mean she's 40 and looks like the teachers i had the hot for were
you know wait yeah much younger i mean this and maybe it's just a bad picture the papers are
notorious for that maybe this is a very unattractive picture or maybe you know it's some of that
that could be it maybe she had like sweetened the pot a little bit so to speak here's the mobile
and sunrise hello yeah no one of the things that's been kind of left out about this is i noticed
some news that she's consulting one with her lawyer at the when she's gonna turn herself in do you
think that that had been a guy did it in a couple of what he called a picture already did oh somebody
said she already did it's been on some of the station to have like a real news thing operation
she i guess you can find i just find it funny that if it was a male teacher would he be able to
determine when to turn himself in or would they be busting down his door to get the you're right
they would have knocked it well i guess she wasn't home i mean i'm sure that they were i don't
know how that works all right you're right if it was a guy that would have come in knocked the
doors down ahead channel seven years and we're saying his would have been hovering over the
furnace and got forbidden with maybe if it was a guy in a one of his male students god knows
what what i have oh boy wow all right just why i only have only a Columbus i think we have to
worry about that oh you know god bless the Catholic okay pal that's what they say in Ireland
that's what they say it's that nagel and laundry
blessed the catlicks don't be picking on them catlicks by the way they could very upset about that
they can't deal with the truth because they're very very well brainwashed five six seven oh five
sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one i just keep making babies okay just keep making babies and
if you're gonna have sex make sure you make a baby otherwise you're gonna burn in hell
just keep that in mind well i'll tell you one thing because i know i'm gonna go to hell if
the research of place that's been guaranteed already how many listings over the years
i bet you're going into a lot of catlicks down here because god almighty i have i could be wrong
but i think from what i hear about all the horny catlicks they're just screwing up a storm
everything that moves and i don't think they're making babies every time they do it
you know i tried to tell the pope it doesn't work that way you know and uh
correct them yeah just about killed them when you heard that especially the swish guard that he's
uh so fond of four minutes before eleven i wonder if during this break i might be able to think
i could uh make it down the hall and back we'll we'll give it a shot i got a cd key to
oh no i i want to do this to right yeah get the door up make sure there's nobody in there by the way
i hate going when there i can't stand it
because i'm a feminine guy
it's eleven i wanted five sixty w two i'm the Guinness Book of Records is on a phone
as once again i managed to race down the hall you should have seen bluffing as paranoia in there
and the other roomy sitting in there they're having a little tea party in there with sand the
shan and whoever else and i go barging out there on my way to the magic room and i oh where you going
yeah i mean like like i'm barging out like i'm i've always believed me several times in the past
few months including last uh Thursday would have been a good day as you'll contest to buy
bro that was the day of course that was all sands fault just want to put that on the record
how come it is if a priest must a fourteen year old kid which goes on every day by the way how come
if that goes on it doesn't make the front page of the paper quite like this and i'm sure that there's
not the tinnus about it that there will be in this particular case with bethreadman
and why is that i wonder these are facts in the church oh i'm sorry and that's right and it's
usually not even the little grills that they're molesting at least they keep it on the same sex side
most of the time not always but most of the time they leave that to the nuns here's a mobile
in fort lotterdale hello deal yes sir how you doing all right all right the angry pop line
the nuts and the hypocrisy of our times yeah i want to talk about republican hypocrisy
no we got to get all the kind of Republicans are beginning to get on faxes again from the same
my name your f info nice guy George w bush okay who certainly doesn't want to talk about his
alleged yeah a lot of problem maybe he did uh cook with bethreadman that's possible well he but he
doesn't want to talk about it that doesn't count but we can talk about uh Clinton mokin a couple
boobies and they've got your dadry him okay but we can't talk about it because it's affecting our
gun you know all the people that have a brain larger than a p have said how come he can't just say

that question he starts this very defensive paranoid they go oh i'm not playing your game and
you've gotten sucked in that game and it's got your got your got your gun i'm not going to respond
why can't he just say that one in homerty because he's a phony and just like that uh newt gingerich

other one in the house that was going to replace uh uh more for about five seconds and all of

new i always say no bush five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t wireless line
got a couple of calls on the board nothing too heavy duty here today because in fact this is
going to be a difficult day to get all the way through the two o'clock you want to know why
because we got charista gaki coming up at two and a lot of people already are practicing putting
their radios in the off position i want to give them a big build up today you know because uh this
is really uh charista gaki charista gaki charista gaki charista gaki charista gaki charista gaki charista gaki

a lot of the hispanics here in town are used to take a little cs to it's a cultural kind of thing
tatties two very big in italy go take a little cs to the middle of the afternoon with your favorite
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t wireless line here's pompano hello
so as George i have macArthur parked cute up for something when you run down the hall just in case
yes i mean i don't understand how you can go and dump and go like that they're in amazement here i
shocked the whole world when i'm able to do i've got so much experience doing that you have no idea
and believe me i was back before the last body even started in that break very admirable yes
the sports show my crap man not only do the sports shows have calls lined up i mean to sit through
you're like two three you have no idea how that tears my guts out and hangs breaks are like
eleven twelve minutes right and they'll sit through it there's one jack up not my people not my
people anymore i had like six seven calls on here a couple of minutes ago go under the break
most of them are gone now i got three calls and you have this one jackball out there named fish fish
from hollywood who called every show and he'll wait for hours on the phone get on and talk about
boy did nate jacket look great at dolphins camp today i mean for what what did nate jacket
going to do during for the dolphins and just and i mean all over the airways national shows i
mean that my work schedule changes some time to time i might be on my way in at five thirty in the
morning and i'm hearing them on like the sports overnight with jt the brick screen that about the
heat or anything there's just some people in the out of guy sucking up his in for yesterday
love you you're a class act listen i'm blind and what i understand you had some laser surgery how
did that go yeah right now the guy's on the air frat and it's it's it's it's it's here he's a
copper tiger he's on what Pennsylvania calling it from the far as the teachers go it's just
amazing the adults in this community everybody you know rags on the kids being stupid but like a
fourteen year old kids not going to be talking running up and out and i'm surprised you did took
this long for this woman to get nabbed i mean if you put yourself in and and the kids shoes i mean
all your friends are gonna know with the probably lining up on her front door with their bicycles
now try to get the notice the only people i'm hearing from are the young people are saying well
that sounds good to me and want to get laid by their teacher too but the the parent they don't
care don't you understand this is the most in different place in the world they just don't give a
crap and then you get a whole bunch of kids you know getting shot up out there a collar bind and
little in colorado and we have a national a week or two of morning and everybody puts on this big
act and that goes back to the way it was before they don't give a crap right then they go back to
school that's why we have crappy education because nobody here cares nobody makes it a priority if
the public cared about that they wouldn't they wouldn't allow it to be like it is quick question and
involving something you were talking about last last week the episode on the plane with the guy
you used to know and then he blew your right off i mean not that i used to know but i mean i had
a conversation a very friendly conversation with him one time and then it's like uh who the hell
do you want you know i miss the beginning part did i do you say you have been traveling with him
on the same flight for years yeah for the last two years i mean he goes to Toronto every weekend
because i guess he lives up there and works down here and then i go up you know like 15 or 20
weekends a year because i love it up there and if seen him all the time in the airport for both
coming up and going back in the no conversation finally for whatever reason we get this conversation
he's a big maple leaf fan he knows who i am he's watched the tv show and we have this great conversation
and like three weeks later i see him up in the airport in Toronto it's like uh he saw a ghost
it's just unbelievable that people you just have like no social skills there's not a function out
there and i'm thinking and i'm thinking to myself okay so maybe he told somebody had a conversation
with me and the person said oh well you know he's a faggot or whatever and i'm thinking to myself if
that's the case if i'm at hot for his body or something which he's you know not that great but if i
were in a little bit slow aren't i after two and a half years of sitting there in the god day
mirror port waiting in the lounge yeah it's uh give me a break come back unbelievable have a good one
there and you two yeah we're very slowly i'm real sinister but wait when you least expect it
but i just like George he hasn't expected all these years but one of these days when you least
expected George been a pound time ain't going to be me five six five six seven oh five sixty
pound five sixty on the AT&T line it would be so rewarding to see a whole bunch of people on these
lines that have them hold on during the break that would really be exciting yeah oh that got the
biggest laugh of the week yeah have a whole bunch of people calling in here with something to say
about anything in the world and actually hold on here like they really wanted to speak that would
be that would make me feel like it was worth coming in this morning because i think that that
little adventure i had done the hallway a few minutes ago i think that was just the first
in a multi-part series today that which is a good sign you know when you got a little flu a
little cold like that and you start like crazy that's excellent man get it out of your system i mean
heavy duty yeah but what does uh anyway huh i guess he's hyperventilating because they're desperate
eleven fourteen and five sixty qm and i see exactly what i said before during the break i begged
i pleaded i tried to be a nice guy i said what would make me really happy was to get a whole
bunch of calls on there and they would hang on during the break one person held up how young is
too young you know what i'm saying one person held on and the fact that this is three minutes and
forty seconds will probably not encourage the other one to hang on there this hanger we're on
over that's not a model before painful but how we close it yeah or if not too bad just
someone in here being just care my god's god baby as usual just reach in and twist and care my
kiss is out thank you so much okay

Here's a mobile and bouquet. Hello.
Hello, Niel.
Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing?
Okay. Listen, let me ask you something.
Don't you think it's a little strange that, uh,
Hillary Clinton is running for the Senate up there
in New York, and all of a sudden,
that bill decides that he's going to pardon these bombers?
No.
Okay?
No.
Do you understand what I'm talking about?
Yeah. So why is Bill pardoning these bombers?
These Puerto Rican bombers...
They like the Puerto Rican,
they're going to make some of the 51st-day,
they've almost been both democratic.
Okay, do you agree with me on that one?
So I agree with you on what?
On the fact that it just seems all strange to them.
Why don't we...
To be honest with you, I don't want to...
Why don't we pardon, sir, if you want to...
Why do you keep asking me a question if you don't want to answer?
Have a nice day, sir.
I don't deal with people who ask rhetorical questions.
Okay? I don't care about Hillary.
I know that make come as a great shock to you.
I don't live in New York State.
They can make Hillary the governor, the queen, the senator,
the princess, the prince, the pauper.
I don't care what they do.
It's of no consequence to me.
None.
Zero. Zipity, doodah.
Do I make myself clear?
No. Okay.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,
on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's West Miami. Hello.
Hello, Neil. Good afternoon.
Yes, sir. That's funny, because Hillary doesn't live in New York either.
Right, exactly.
But what do you care about?
What do you care?
What do you care?
Well, you know, it's a stepping stone because she's got political aspirations.
Just like the crap they were making up about after,
Bumma gets out with his term and he's going to go back to Arkansas
and run for...
Like all of a sudden, we got a royal family now, you know?
Well, what is that all about?
Please.
Listen, that was unfortunate about the teacher, but, you know,
not the other two a week ago.
That's nobody's business, but this...
Well, what would you say unfortunate?
Now, how come nobody in this audience has got a real opinion?
We can make a joke out of it.
You know, 40-year-old woman has sex with a 14-year-old kid
and a bunch of other kids and have them live in her or a prokondo there
and she's buying them cars and providing them with cocaine
and LSD and God don't know what else.
There's thousands of other teachers that do a great job
and she's just, you know, now giving her, you know...
And nobody has any opinion about this.
Because nobody cares.
Why?
They're apathetic.
God Almighty, this is unbelievable.
And the only response we get is a bunch of young guys out there
and what's their teachers want to screw them, yes?
When Buri, I saw he was skating.
I remember about a month ago they said that a lot of the Russian players
were going to skate.
Yeah.
He didn't need permission from the team to do that, did he?
Did the team get any kind of release?
Is this on his own or is that not on his own?
No, it's not on his own.
He did it with the team's, uh, inferior, enthusiastic encouragement.
Because he was glad to see him and the first little semblance of hockey.
Well, I got news for us, sir, if they...
If he don't make a full recovery, we might as well burn your tickets out in the parking lot.
I hope he does, because he...
And so do I, because going him is seeing him play is worth the price of the mission.
Well, I can't wait till October.
Okay, pal.
Thank you, Neil.
See him. Go, Leafs, go.
Fox and Maple Leaf hockey here today, huh?
No.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5.
I've got that.
Mike Johnson's in, fight up again.
Nice going.
Mike, leave me solid.
There you go.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
I'm just going to keep repeating those numbers over and over and over again.
I'll go down the hall and do another number of my own,
because they just don't give a crap.
Here is a story if this happened anywhere else in the world.
On the highest rated talk show in town, this 40-year-old teacher screwing a 14-year-old boy.
Everybody in town to be on a phone talking about, have something to say about it.
These people, where they got nothing.
What the hell was that?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Yeah, that's going to goddamn traffic report.
Yeah.
God, that was good.
Oh, it's better having that come up in some pain in the ass bit that I got to cut off.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Do you have an opinion about anything?
No.
If the hurricane comes right through the middle of your neighborhood, will you care about that?
No.
Have you got an opinion on young black people speaking bubonics and that we don't teach them to speak proper English like God damn Dott of Inveilian Peter Warrell,
who may not be the greatest guy that hockey player that ever came down to fight, even though you like him a lot,
but nevertheless, he speaks perfect English.
Is there some reason that nobody cares about that?
Even my dark, complex friends.
Let me ask you.
Here's a mobile in Perine.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
First time, long time.
All right.
It's a pleasure to speak to you.
Yes, it is.
All right.
Last week you were talking about you read a little article about the Nutri-Sleet Problem.
They're about that?
Aspartane, yes.
Yes, aspartane, correct.
I understand.
And I'm still very good, by the way.
I have to admit, I'm still drinking that crap.
I was on the line reading about it.
There are endless amounts of websites pertaining to Aspartane and the horrors of it.
It's unbelievable that this product is on the market.
Yeah.
People are consuming it by the count.
I'm going to put alcohol in it and I'm drinking it by the count.
Georgia's drinking a diet Pepsi right now.
He's swirling it down as I speak.
Trying to swish out the taste of that crappy food fat boy brought up earlier.
What I read, basically, you drink it as soon as you drink it.
Yeah.
It breaks down into methanol.
And then that goes into your liver and starts poisoning your system.
Slow building, poisoning stays in your system.
What is wrong with me?
I got on here and I read that and I promised myself that those two diet Pepsi's I had that they didn't make sure were last I would ever have.
And then I go to the store and I'm buying diet right soda by the gallon.
And I got this solely bottled water, even the fizzy kind that I love from Italy, from Northern Italy,
that South套 comes with me for free.
And I'm still not drinking as much as I should.
I do drink it here at work, but I should be drinking it at home and no more soda.
It is so hard because now everyone's so conditioned to drinking diet soda.
You don't even want to drink water.
Let's go to the more.
Right.
You still use to the flavor of it.
And of course when you're diabetic like I am, you can't drink the regular soda because it sure will send your blood sugar skyrocketing.
And of course, it will keep you fat as well and really bad for you too.
Exactly.
And why don't we do like to do in Europe and everybody drink a lot of bottled water?
They don't, the kids there will drink coax and stuff.
But most of the people that have a meal out and they drink bottled water.
Well, I drink water all the time, but I also like to have a mixed drink like a Roman Coke or something like that.
And you know, they say the only good thing about this diet code is that you have it without coax.
What just happened to this guy?
What's happening to our phone system?
Okay, call me back pal.
Call me back.
It's a great conversation.
But did you hear that?
It sounded like somebody was dealing with our phone right there.
Didn't it?
And like in the other room or somewhere in here?
Go look in the other room and see if some asshole is in there.
See, this is another thing about this whole thing with this crappy phone system.
I really don't know if these people are all actually dropping off.
If they're getting chopped off, God only knows what's going on.
One day we had some puttwacker that I think was Dan La Bastard from the Harold sitting in there.
There's nobody in there.
No, it's probably our friends at Bell Soff again who keep screwing with these guy named phone lines and chopping people off.
You're not, we're on to you.
Okay, my good friend, Larry, a mission said he's got a list of about half a dozen people are going to get asked by the end of this month.
He's going to ask you to say goodbye.
You're not fooling anybody.
Okay, screwing around with our livelihood here.
Not that we really care that much, but five six.
Seven, but that was a good call or the area at a good point.
Something important, which I did bring up that day by the way one day last week.
Was there any response about that?
No.
Better late than ever.
And I'm glad he reminded me because I've got to stop drinking at craft.
Stop drinking at craft.
God dammit.
And just like yesterday, I was at the track last night and get there earlier.
Of course, it's always because I love the punishment.
And David Horrish was there last night.
I said, stay the hell away from me and he did.
Thank God.
Don't come anywhere near me, idiot.
So I'm flipping the channels on my little TV there in our box.
And all of a sudden, come across Channel 7 News, which I only channel served to I promise.
Got my legs crossed.
And they got a thing I don't know about.
If you're diabetic, a vegetarian diet can really be great.
And you might be able to stop all your medication.
And that's it.
Where is the rest of the story?
Where is Paul Harvey when we need him with the rest of the freaking God damn story?
That's what I would like to know.
Where is the rest of this thinking story?
And that was it.
So maybe I'll become a vegetarian, huh?
It takes a lot of bottled water.
Boy, that sounds boring, you know.
Does it?
The bottled water part I love.
I love bottled water.
Frizante that is.
Cungas.
I love my f***ing gas.
What?
When I wait, what is funny about that?
Frizante.
It just sounds funny.
Because of the talent.
Cungas.
When you go in a trot to read, they ask you, you know, a Cungas.
And you say, see or no.
See or no.
Or you say, see this and they laugh.
Okay, I was in the car about a half an hour, but listening to you.
First of all, Nick Carter has more talent than his white coat than you will ever have.
And he's not a pineapple that you stupid fat baguette.
Frizante.
Frizante.
Frizante.
Frizante.
Frizante.
Oops, just have to be watching VH1.
God, I just pulled a crisp baker.
I do like that.
Frizante.
Oh, I didn't do it for half an hour.
Frizante.
Frizante.
Yeah, there's the Nick Carter bitch.
And do we get an apology from Maria today?
No.
No, she don't care.
She doesn't just call up here and, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Like that kind of call yesterday and try to get this Beth Friedman abroad, confused and mixed
it with those two teachers with their swing clubs, you know.
Did he call him apologize and correct the error of the erroneous information that he tried to propagate
and use this radio show as his vehicle yesterday?
Did he apologize?
No.
No.
And don't tell me they're not listening because they're hanging on it right now.
Believe you me.
They're squeezing themselves just from the publicity.
How come did you see how small this story is that Casino San, cut out of the paper?
Oh, this was on TV.
I've mentioned this the other day.
But nevertheless, instead of being on the front page, plastered on there like the Sun sent
over this teacher, this 40-year-old Beth Friedman, that was just trying to try to show the kids a good time, you know.
Right.
A Hollywood priest is being sued by an anonymous plaintiff who claims the priest made sexual advances toward him dozens of times and mailed nude photos of himself.
The suit by a plaintiff identified only as John Doe was filed last Wednesday in Broward Circuit Court against Reverend Joseph Sinesee of Saint Mary's Cat-Leaked Church.
Sinesee denied the allegations, of course.
The plaintiff's attorney, Russell Adler, said his client wanted to remain anonymous because he was ashamed by the experience.
And they showed the photos on that new story on TV.
So it's kind of hard to deny the experience when a guy's got the naked photos right there, but nevertheless, it'll all come out in the wash.
That's what the Pope always says.
It'll come out in the wash, all those things.
But anyway, how come there's that little tiny blurb in the paper there, but this school see where real big on the schools now?
Let's have a witch hunt.
Let's try to, you know, smear all the teachers with a big broad brush.
They're all perverts. They're all evil. They're all bad people. They're all my little senior children.
And for the kind of money we're paying them, who can trust them for five bucks an hour?
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Give it a rest, pineapple head.
Here's a lady in Miami. Hello.
Hello.
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah, I am so upset about the response about this teacher and how she's getting off with...
There is no anger.
There is no anger. I'm a teacher myself.
Right.
I just cannot believe that if this was a little girl, a 14-year-old girl, and then here's this 40-year-old man, you know, having sex with that...
They would already have him hung from a tree all the way.
We're getting all this bad rap for teachers, but you know what? There are a lot of bad teachers out there.
Sure, just like your bad cops, bad doctors, bad radio people, bad TV people.
We're dealing directly with children.
Right.
And they've got to do something about the way the higher teachers, the way they look at teachers.
I mean, she's... this lady had a law degree.
Right.
You know what she was doing?
You know, and it's just that.
I can't understand all these men that call up and say, oh, well, because it was a boy. He was coming of age.
He knew... you know, he got what he wanted.
But if it would have been somebody's 14-year-old daughter out there, he'd have his shotgun out.
He'd be chasing the guy down right now as we speak.
Exactly. I just cannot believe the response of this guy.
How do you think I think of him? I mean, I saw the thing on the news yesterday.
And I remember that one call that we had on the show yesterday where the guy was totally wrong,
trying to hook this up and play in the teachers in that swing club, there was no connection.
But I remember that, and I see the story, and I watch it on the news again this morning to get updated on it.
I come here in a year and it's like, it's like nobody cares.
Oh, they're laughing again.
It's like a big joke, yeah.
It's a big joke.
Everybody thinks that, you know, we're real great if their teacher would have screwed them, you know?
No, I'm not quite.
Being a teacher, dealing with kids at 14-year-old age.
I mean, that's sick. It's crazy.
It's unbelievable.
And providing them with acid and with coke and then buying a car.
Yeah, that's fine. Putting it aside, that's the second thing.
You know, I mean, just a sixth part of it, and then the drugs on top of that.
That's crazy. That's crazy.
I just don't understand the response we're getting from men and women who are giggling about this and saying, oh,
well, now you know why it goes on because nobody cares.
This is like the thing I've been screaming about about the priest for years and years.
I mean, it's not my imagination or making it up for stories.
These stories are in the papers every goddamn day and nobody cares about that.
And they keep going there and giving them their money. They don't care.
It's behind closed doors. They don't care.
They don't care.
Well, you sure, they sure seem to care when the teachers were doing it beyond closed doors at the swing club up there in the...
I think that was wrong, I don't.
I think it was wrong because they got arrested for something.
I think any kind of arrest, you should...
They say, well, they don't have to be wrong.
They are role models and they got arrested the same way if they would have gotten arrested for DUI.
No, no, no, that's ridiculous. DUI is endangering somebody else's life.
How can you make a comparison of consenting a dog having...
It's an arrest.
You're...
Yeah, but...
So in other words, you're justifying the pleasure police, the sex police now.
So in other words, if somebody busts you for anything, if they came into your house and arrested you because you were...
I wouldn't have known that house.
What is it?
That wasn't...
You didn't let me finish this dude, aren't letting me speak.
If they came into your house and you were breaking the Florida Sodomy Statute by having oral sex with your husband,
which is against the law, I don't know if you know what it is not, would you think that...
Well, you should be disqualified from teaching because you were arrested.
Yeah, that's tough.
I just don't think it's...
That tough?
So in other words, you think that nobody has the right to privacy, your sex life, if you're a teacher, or your public figure,
you should be open to everybody?
No.
So then what are you saying?
I'm just saying, I don't...
I mean, that's...
That's tough.
That's...
I just don't think that was right.
I don't think it's something that they have the right to be honest with.
Because you don't go there and you don't want to participate, you're making judgments about them.
No, I don't.
It's not here.
It's not anybody's business.
I think it's...
It's not anybody...
No, the sex lives are teachers.
Do you want to go to their class and tell your kids about your sex life?
Nope.
No, I don't.
Thank you.
Oh.
Very simple.
Okay, when she was on the other foot, when you pointed a finger at somebody else, they're bad.
They're evil.
It's wrong.
It's wrong.
Yadi, yadi, yadi.
Yeah.
But you don't want to...
Yes, dirty.
They're so dirty.
There is absolutely no reason in the world why students should know anything about their teacher's sex life,
much less their private lives, who they're married to, if they're married.
And it's got nothing to do with anything.
They're there to teach.
The kids are there to learn.
Period.
Period.
And this role model, BullCraft, that's a bunch of crap.
The parents, yours the ones that are supposed to be the role models.
Not the athletes, not the teachers.
Not all these other goddamn people that you keep laying every day, your own responsibilities off on.
The parents.
They should be the role models for the kids.
God.
But anyway, have a nice day, sweetheart.
How young is too young?
You can punch me, Zika Mindergroy!
Rift the hair off his chest and skill he snores!
Hello.
I'm Bernie Coffell, and I'm barely alive.
But I don't snore and here's why.
When we go to sleep, my wife always carries her anti-snore gun.
Not only is it easy for her to use, but it's very effective too.
And here's why.
Just one quick pull of the trigger and you'll sleep snore free all night long.
If you have a loved one that snores, use the anti-snore gun.
Just with the NRA order.
To order yours, have played a confetti in called the NRA at 1-800-American way.
That's the American f**king way.
Amen, sweetheart.
11-43-5-60-WQM, this teacher, she was going along okay until she started pointing fingers at everybody else.
They so dirty, okay?
She doesn't want her kids to know anything about her, you know, in her classes, not about her sex life,
because that's private, but other people, well, that's bad.
Even in a private club.
Even inside a place, behind closed doors.
Here's a lady in Hylia. Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, ma'am.
Hi, I'm a hoolie from Hylia.
All right.
I want to just one time.
I'm getting the hell out of here.
I'm blowing this taco stand.
Really? Where are you going?
In Indiana.
Well.
Yeah.
Nothing's perfect.
Yeah, I'll tell you though, I'd rather face an army of crazy red necks with guns.
And then, you know, all these professional Cubans and just crazy people running around here.
Can't thank for themselves.
Right, exactly.
Yeah.
And I don't know if anybody just brought this up, but there's a case, maybe, I guess, two or three years ago,
about that teacher in Washington State, Mary Kay, for no reason.
Right. I mentioned that, you know.
Yeah, I mean, the one every time they would let her out on parole, she would be dealing him again.
She just can't stop.
She's had two children, but that's the only way.
Right.
It's a polling.
That's America for you.
And I mean, I'll tell you one of your colleagues before I mentioned something about everybody being
episodic.
It's in the school system, too.
I'm a recent high school graduate, you know, hence why I'm moving.
And it's just, I don't know.
So schools are full of number one teachers who don't care who just, you know, are just there to draw a paycheck.
Kids who don't care, they don't care about themselves.
You know, they don't care about their own, you know, lives and their parents, you know, either can't be on top of them or don't want to.
They don't, you know, their parents don't give a question.
Now, I guess the teachers want to be on top of them is what it sounds like.
Okay, we're listening. Good luck. I'll see you in Kokomo.
Thanks.
See you.
See you.
I'm Tara Holt.
Be sure and tell my people to call me a record club.
By the way, I want to cancel and a video thing, too, because I'm too lazy to call them.
Here's Tamara. Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you today?
Great.
Okay, a couple of things.
First of all, you know, this thing with the teachers at the swing club.
I think one of the saddest things that's come out is that, you know, in having these board meetings, one of the teachers,
at least that I heard of on the news, is apologize.
Yeah, it's a great word.
And swearing that you'll never do it again.
And I think that's really sad.
Does he really say that?
City made a mistake.
But see, yesterday you were all over a guy for saying, you know, that's a questionable behavior.
You were all over him.
But here you have the teacher questioning his own behavior.
No, he's not questioning his own behavior.
He's trying to cover his ass.
He's not questioning his behavior.
No, he's trying to say a whole lot of it.
And a mistake.
Isn't that what everybody always says?
Usually the religious nuts.
Oh, I made a mistake and I want to be forgiven and praise Jesus.
And now we go on with life.
That's basically what he's trying to do.
What's the problem with that?
Well, wouldn't it be better if he took a stand and said it's none of your business or life?
Yeah, I'm not defending his comment.
Of course it would be.
You're absolutely right.
I'm appalled by all of a sudden turnaround.
Oh, I made a bad mistake and it was there in judgment.
And see, this is the problem, like I told you the other day.
There is no constituency for any kind of adult establishments because we live in a society
where the human body is bad, sex is evil, and all of these horrible things.
Nobody is supposed to admit to, even though most people, you know, either,
if they don't go, that they would like to.
But so, you know, lots of comes out in public.
You have to, you know, renounce your sins.
One other thing with the thing in Mississippi, with the Jewish star, the star of David.
Yeah.
I mean, that's absurd because if you had, if you wore the rave or flag in Mississippi,
I'm sure they'd patch on the back for what we're wearing.
We're a great point, average up about half a point, at least.
Exactly.
Two about a point five.
You know, this last call just brought up the teacher in Washington.
You can't compare the two between this lady now who is on the front page of the Sunday.
How do you know?
How much do we know about the woman on the front page?
Well, I mean, let's just say that everything, let's just say that the drug part is true.
Yeah.
I think that's a big difference.
The sad thing with the woman in Washington, she has kids with this boy, you know.
And I mean, they look like they were in love.
She can't see her kids.
That's, I mean, that's wrong.
Yeah.
I mean, I mean, it was hard.
I would agree with you.
I mean, first of all, that was only one kid that she was involved with, and evidently they were in love,
which is, you know, our society frowns on that to say the least.
But in this particular case, evidently, if the allegations are true,
this one was involved in a whole bunch of students underage, and was even living with a couple of men or condominium,
and was providing drugs and buying a kid a car and doing all sorts of other unacceptable things.
Right.
No, you're right. There is no comparison.
But regardless of what this woman did in Washington, she should be able to see her kids.
That's disgusting.
Yeah.
I mean, this kid, you know, is going to grow up without a mother and later on down the road, you know.
I mean, that kid is going to be screwed up.
Maybe she can go on guiding lights, she'll tell him it's Ross' kid.
Have a great day.
All right.
Okay. 5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
A little bit of a flurry here right now.
Not too much. A little bit of excitement.
Don't want to go overboard here.
We want to pretend that we actually have some interest in these things because obviously we don't.
Which is good because it's nice to live in La La Land, you know.
Just kind of sit back and put your feet up on the desk.
Yeah.
Put up a bit of mixed doggy and just to flip off your boss.
Tell me it's a jackass.
Here's the four-later day.
Hello.
23 minutes and 30 seconds later.
And just at that magical moment when he's just about scored, scored to, uh, exploded out.
He's gone.
It's gone.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T line.
Here's a mobile and Palm Beach Gardens.
Hello.
Mobile and Palm Beach Gardens.
Neil, how you doing?
Yes, sir.
I just wanted to call to make a point.
I had sex with a teacher when I was in the ninth grade.
And about, what, 15?
Yeah, 15 years old.
And I considered myself very lucky at the time.
It didn't mess me up.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was certainly a man of men out of me.
And how old was he?
I mean, how old was he?
He was in the late 30s.
Yeah.
You know, we would need places after school and things like that.
You know, we've managed to keep it how sharp she knows where we found out.
Yeah.
And I have no idea if she was with other people or not.
But, you know, in my opinion, this woman, you know, shirts and unethical thing,
as far as the drugs and alcohol concerned, to me, that's much worse.
Yeah.
In having sex with consensual sex with someone, because like you were saying before,
the society looks so far down on sex with violence and drugs and everything is, you know, a different story.
Well, yeah, as far as her concern.
And to start an American society, at least, professes to believe that if you're under the legal age,
meaning under 18, that you have no business having sexualizations with anybody.
To me, that's absurd.
Everybody's having sex.
Wait, pardon me.
Of course they are, but I mean, that's what we say for public consumption.
You know, it's an understandable field of degree, you know.
But when I was in school, this happened, and it didn't mess me up at all.
And she never forced me to do anything at any cost.
Of course, I was all forward at the time.
And I've certainly caught me a lot and sort of speak.
And the main thing is, if she was caught just having consensual sex with individuals,
in my opinion, the most she should be is maybe fired, but as far as prison time, she's not even right to society.
But what about their staying?
What about the violence in the action?
Yeah, that, like I said, those things definitely, that's way out of line.
But giving drugs to a child is one thing.
But all that was was set, I think, someone that's caught having sex with a student,
it's more of an ethical violation of my opinion than a criminal violation.
Drugs, of course, is a different story, you know.
Let me ask you this.
If a guy who's like 19, forget about 40 like this teacher is, if a guy who's 19 has sex with a 14-year-old girl,
that statutory rape, he's going to jail.
Yeah, that's where, I guess we all look at differently when it's the other way around when it's a little boy and a...
Exactly.
But in that case, in this case, the boy...
The boy's got a 15-year-old and 14-year-old boy, they're supposed to be horny and they're supposed to have sex.
But God forbid the male teacher would have sex with a 14-year-old daughter, you're going to blow his brains out.
And you know it.
Yeah, but it was fun, you know.
It was fun.
Okay, pal.
Have a good day.
Bottoms up.
See, that brings to mind one question.
How young is two young?
See, American society...
I mean, I don't want to get into this, okay, because it's a very touchy, delicate thing in this country.
Most other countries you'll find, legal age for consenting sex, is 14, 15, 16.
I think Canada is 14.
And most countries in Europe, it's 15 or 16.
I don't know of any country in Europe where it's over 16.
But in America, of course, it's 18.
So you have, on the one hand, the laws.
And secondly, you have a society, like I said, that professors to believe, even though there are...
There are 10 of you out there who really believe that people under the age of 18 aren't having sex or shouldn't have sex.
Nobody really believes that.
But we say all of these things for public consumption because we're a bunch of phonies and hypocrites.
That's the American F in a way.
And he raises a good point.
If you know, she only had sex with a kid, would there be people out under a risk breakdown now, especially with a boy?
Probably not.
Because I don't see any...
Even with the drugs, I don't see anybody really cares to be honest with him.
Lucky bastard.
No, not a lucky bastard. Not with the drugs.
Sorry, that's why I draw the...
Draw the line with the other guy.
And get the same...
Oh, the guy that called.
Yeah.
That's right.
It's hard to like you at a good time.
Oh my God, how could you say these things?
I know, sex is very bad.
Here's a lady in Miami. Hello.
Hi, Mia. How you doing today?
Okay.
I have a comment.
What you're saying is true about, you know, the...
The boy having sex with the older teacher.
That's true.
Why is this so different between a girl having sex with the older...
You know, when they're young and having sex with the older...
Right.
And then the comment is like...
Teacher.
Right. You know...
I can't...
It doesn't matter.
I got a little five-year-old.
I got a little eight-month-old baby.
I don't play that.
I don't care.
Teacher, no teacher.
I'll still blow you head off.
I have another comment.
So, I would you don't discriminate?
Right.
I have another comment that teaches a call a couple of minutes ago
about those...
Alright.
We had the jackpot.
Alright.
She said, if that other teacher had called me for,
so, effing perfect, then, you know,
let her offer high horse, etc. and so on.
I've gone to sweetheart.
But just remember, it's the US of A.
You can't say the F word on a year because the government gets real nervous about that.
If you do it, they get nervous.
But if you even say it, they also start sweating a little bit.
Because they start conjuring up images of what you're talking about.
5-670560, 0560 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
How are you doing, Neil?
Okay.
I got a little story to share with you.
Mine involved alcohol, though.
It was, um, grandnight.
I was 17 years old.
Um, my teacher was...
She must have been about 25, 26.
We all snuck in alcohol, orange juice,
and all that to the bus.
Found the way to Disney World.
We all got a little happy.
We got a little touchy touchy.
And as soon as we got off the bus,
and we just did it.
I mean, but that was it.
As soon as you got off the bus, so, okay, I'm sure Mickey had a good time, too,
because we all know about Mickey.
Don't we know about Mickey?
Yeah, we know.
What's in it, uniform.
I hate to break the news, George,
but there's a chick that you get all psychotic about here on VH1 from the chin-up.
I mean, I'll give her a 5.
Maybe she does a chin-up.
She's doing chin-ups, yeah.
5.6.7.
There's a couple of phone lines ringing out, too, by the way.
I just thought I would mention that to try to get your push out of the screen,
where it's embedded at the moment.
Yeah, you see, girls, and how would Ricky Martin be big?
And as much as I love their music, I don't like to backstreet boys,
because they're hot looking, because they're not.
But their music is great.
But nevertheless, sitting on that aside,
all these other boy groups.
Why would they be bigger, unless the 10 and 12 and 13-year-old hormonal girls
were all like, falling at the mouth over them?
Like that, like the crazy girl I called yesterday,
who's gotten the Cog and the Carter blow-up dial at home,
which is the only way she's going to get close to him.
Trust me, sweetheart.
Oh, no, you don't understand.
Girls are not that son.
That's a boy thing.
Boys are supposed to be horny.
They're the pursuers.
They're the aggressors.
They're the ones that are like, you know, pumping everything that moves.
But the young girls, they're supposed to be refined.
They're not supposed to be interested in all of these things.
That's why we have to go visit the family priest.
Not for a discussion, just because he's interested, he might help you.
Here's a North Miami fellow.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Here's a good question.
On a teacher thing with the kid?
Yes, sir.
It's a kid murdered somebody.
They have a hearing.
They make them an adult.
Yeah, that's a good point.
You know, like, what would happen if this kid happened to kill a terrible thing to say?
No, no, no, no.
Somebody was killed today.
It was very well.
That's a good point.
You're right, they had to tell you about it.
It's right.
It's right.
It's right.
It's right.
They've passed up.
That's a bad choice of words.
Yeah.
No, very good point.
Thank you, sir.
God bless you.
I know what I thought of that.
12-year-old boy with a 60-year-old girl, remember to put the hammer lock, the arresting thing.
And of course, he just had to slam her down on 20 or 30 times to manage.
He's dead.
Good old with trying him as an adult.
Murder.
But a 14-year-old boy, you know, he has sex with a 40-year-old woman.
And how come he can't be considered an adult?
Huh?
That's sex.
Oh, that's right.
It's sex.
I forgot about that.
And of course, it also brings back that question.
How young is two young?
Right.

Guess what?
We hit the jackpot boys and girls.
Oh, yeah.
In the cruel cables.
At 46-12, as you enrolled.
Thanks, Jim Stoodley.
You brought us lunch today and I'm great.
What are you looking at?
Man, this is an amazing Italian food.
You want it, huh?
They have got like real Italian food.
This isn't like make-believe.
And by the way, you said he's got some great Jeff Cohen stories, which I'm sure he does.
But nevertheless, so now what kind of soup is this again?
This is fantastic.
This is just what the doctor ordered.
A hot pepper best or something like.
Mmm.
God is just good.
And real thin pizza, like they make it in Rome.
Not the, well, I don't want to get started.
You know, with the pizza people.
But the real thin authentic way they make it in Italy, except for the thick seasoning,
which most of us don't eat.

Here's a mobile in Hollywood.
Hello.
What is it?
Hello.
Yes, bad phone.
Yes.
I was just up.
You have to wait back.
Your phone is unacceptable, pal.
Sorry about that.
Call me back.
Bad phone problems today, man.
Phone problems on the inside.
Phone problems on the outside.
The wonders of cell technology, man.
It really is a long way to go.
5-6705-60, 0.560 on our mobile one line.
Let's try a mobile in Davy.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Neil, how are you doing?
All right.
Here's the issue that I have.
I don't have anything against anybody having sex with anybody.
As long as they're consenting adults, the probably thing prostitution should be legalized.
Yeah, but what is an adult, though?
That's the question.
How young is too young?
Exactly.
And my question here is, if you're in your 30s or 40s, you're desired to have sex with a 14-year-old.
There's got to be something wrong with you.
Well, by American standards, I mean, I have no interest in having sex with 14-year-olds either or 15 or 16-year-olds.
But if you're in your 30s or 40s, you're desired to have sex with 12 or 13-year-olds.
No, now you got it down to 12.
I mean, how far do we draw the line before people who are pedophiles or people enter little children and somebody who's in adolescence?
Like I said, the legal age in most countries is like the median, I would say, like 15 or 16 for both boys and girls.
I don't know if that's right.
I mean, I think that's a little young.
15-year-olds can be influenced by anything, anybody.
I think maybe a little...
Even now, you see, it's hard to make a determination because there are 15-year-olds who are like 12-year-olds and there are 15-year-old kids who are like 20-year-olds.
So it's very hard.
How can you determine maturity level in a kid?
See, I think that the legal age should be 17.
I mean, maybe I'm a little fashion, maybe I'm...
But I think that that's not so revolutionary that it doesn't go so far under what it is now.
I think for boys and girls, both straight and gay, 17 would be an age that maybe we could agree on.
But 14 and 15-year-olds...
You have to base your behavior on what society says, you know, and you can't be having sex with 14 and 15-year-olds.
If society says, if you do, that we're going to throw you ass in jail.
Right. Well, I thought we'd establish that 18-year-old was kind of the adult line here in this country.
Yeah, but it's interesting that kids can go out and buy guns, but they can't, number one, have sex.
And number two, they can't buy a pack of cigarettes or a bottle of beer.
I just think that if you're in your 30s and 40s and you're desired to have sex with a 14-year-old,
there's something wrong with you. It's not normal.
And then should you be teaching our children?
No, I would agree with you. I think that anyone...
That's what you think you're doing.
Any 40-year-old teacher that's having sex with 14 and 15-year-old kids automatically should have their ass fired immediately.
No question.
I don't know if they should be fired, but I think they should be fired.
You don't think they should be fired? Then what then what should we do with them? Like give them a couple of months to cool out?
Yeah, maybe they've got to have something mentally wrong with them.
Yeah.
They're sick.
So then if they're sick, why would you want them teaching your children?
No, you're right. I wouldn't.
But I'm saying I'm in my 30s and you know, I'm going to drive by schools and I see these 14-year-olds who look like this.
All right, but wait a minute.
Okay, Brittany Spears, okay, she's 17. She could be 16. She could be 19. She could be anything, okay?
Now Brittany Spears, everybody in her brother tells me,
oh hey, we don't care whether she's legal or not. And I believe that they don't give a crap, okay?
She's hot, she's whatever she is.
And you're going to tell me that you would turn her down?
No, but if it was your daughter, you'd feel differently.
You know, I feel like Brittany and Peter and so on and so on, everybody else.
Exactly. I think everybody just says that, but I think when it comes to...
But why is it that if it was your 15-year-old son that was getting it out with a 30 or 40-year-old teacher,
that maybe you might not be proud of, say, hey, nice going, Billy.
No, no, I don't feel that way either.
No, I'm 15-year-old boy was doing some 30-year-old girl. I'd have a problem with that.
Yeah. And now with my son, the problem's with a 30-year-old.
I get, I mean, you know, I'm 15-year-old. You still get horny.
But where do you draw the line? If you... How about if she was 25 years old and your son is 15?
I think that if she's still a teenager, she's 19 years old and my kids 15.
You know, even I think there's something a lot with her, but I can understand.
Oh, and now wait a minute, come on. If your kid is 15, he looks like maybe 17 or 18.
And he's mature. And a girl is 19. You're going to tell me you think there was something wrong with her?
No, I don't think there's any wrong with her.
He just got her son in that.
No, no, no, no. I mean, you raise it to 17. That's different.
You got a 15-year-old who's seven.
No, no, I said if you're 15-year-old's son, an accident looks like 17, which is possible.
No, it's awesome, man. If you're a teenager and you want to have sex with another teenager,
it's going to happen. I don't see a problem with that.
But you know, 30s and 40s? I mean, come on.
There's something wrong with you. That's my issue here.
I want to go to a sex club and do what you want. That's fine.
If you're in a adult, right?
Exactly. I don't care. Well, who you have sex with and, you know, I don't care what sex it is.
But when you're talking about, you know, you're an adult. 30, 40 years old like this woman was.
Right.
And you have a desire, just the fact that you desire to have sex with a 14-year-old kid.
I don't know. I think there's an issue there. There's something wrong with when years.
I agree with you. That's my only issue.
Okay, pal. Have a nice day.
Have a great day. Of course, maybe he was hot. Oh, I'm sorry.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5. Just a joke, folks. It's just a little joke.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8, pound, 5, 6, 8 on the mobile one line.

five six seven o five sixty pound five sixty on mobile and i'll tell you this
lunch today we hit the jackpot baby
pausia
forty six twelve is you wrote in corral gables we got the uh... then we go
authentic pizza
the best day of soup i've ever had to have another uh... thing of that
is there another one in there i pray all men
what is your red pepper corn biscuits something like that
something like that something like pepper biscuits
god is this great thank you gym
jim stutoli he's a stood up guy is a great guy
uh... and uh... i think this is going to be a wonderful relationship
that is a great what look at how to help us just trying to be here now
to try to make up for that the singing fest we had their at that restaurant
it was a great meal but uh... you know all men river five six out of five sixty
pound five sixty on the mobile one line very weak response here today as usual
here's a lady in davie hello
hello you know
uh... parent as well as a teacher and i kind of keep flip flopping between
listening to what's going on from both sides is getting teachers and parents
and the thing i can't understand is with the parents
uh... you know they're amazing they sit there and they talk about teachers but
yet is a teacher
some of the stories that these children tell me that go on in their homes
they have a lot of nerve talking about teachers in a bad way
you know for instance is it
disgusting if our parents is uh... let's have a toilet and the child is able
to walk in and out of the bathroom
is that okay that's considered like in our right now my soup no less yet
disgusting our right now exactly and on the other hand as the teacher
she should she should still have acted
in a professional manner but what those other two teachers did it later
they should have been allowed to do what they want they're not doing it in front
of a child
yeah
outcome there's not the big fear of you see this i'm sure you saw the story about
this woman was now arrested for uh... helping to cover up the uh... the
nephew was at the fifteen-year-old nephew that raped her five-year-old daughter
and she pretended she was asleep and changed the story a hundred times this
tranquilizer that tranquilizer yeah it was going on the very next room in the
the little girl five-year-old girl was so beaten and bloody than the bruise
because of such a violent attack
and how come there's not a big thing about that well that kind of people we have
making babies in this country absolutely nobody cares about it
and as a teacher here the same thing going on from your students when they
talk about go what goes on with their parents
you know and that and if there is a chance going on which is a teacher i've seen
plenty uh... let me tell you something
it is amazing how many times the mother does know
and they did
studies at now more and more that the women the mothers do know what's going on
and just
turns you know a blind eye on it
and and this goes on even with boyfriend
uh... of you know
you have a daughter in the house and the boyfriends coming in
and a lot of times
the girls
you know bothered by these boys and they go and they tell their mother
the mother will
insurably
side with the boyfriends really
uh... yeah many times that maybe the mother's getting a little too on a side
that could be
but this is our six society that gets it's been on both sides of what do you think
teachers should have sex with their students that's okay
not no absolutely not
i mean
many most of us are in the profession because we love it was certainly not
any further money we work real hard
and we do lots of wonderful things with these children
but unfortunately now
with our wonderful
our wonderful governor and you know increasing class size to the point where
there's forty children in your class
and you
is that and parents
who never come up to even see you and want to know what's going on in school
that too busy
uh... and then neglectful
it's just a horrible situation on both sides
so there's a lot of time that these children get to be on their own
at parents don't know what's going on
and if you do want to know i'll get a teacher that is unprofessional like
this one
this lady
these things can happen
uh... what about that uh... teacher palmetto
one that the girl killed herself the band leader right now he came from
Michigan
uh... they knew what we've got you know he was written up there but you know
there's no
uh... there's no in the link yet
trying to act down you know
because nobody cares right
things so
i can tell you what the full thanks a lot
okay six hundred open lines here again we have to like prod and squeeze while
I'm enjoying this fantastic soup from
pausa encroached
uh... god is this great five six seven oh five sixty
pound five sixty on a mobile one line is a mobile in davi hello
hey nil
yes sir
hopefully this is a better phone line
so
yes but there are bad teachers just like their bad cops just like their bad
doctors
you know but little do we you know we always forget you know we forget about
the teacher i think it was a year and a half ago
and have sex with the kid
and then uh... she got pregnant you know she was bad from the kids you got
chance to have to with him again
yeah we talked about that
then you turn around and you two weeks ago in my any
there's the high school coach or that that from the christian school
and had sex with his student
consenting sex she's fifteen years old
and that story went away just like the story with the cops right
and i'm going to one one two twice maybe that was the end of that story right
absolutely and it was funny
that you know the principal from that particular school
it's on television
and says well we know that double was at work
oh there you go one of the outside no problem
you know and so it's really funny that
you know
the media to do which story they want to hide out
uh... the two teachers and the in the fifth club
we're doing their own thing that story doesn't die because that's selling newspapers
for them
these other stories are selling newspapers for them so they don't worry about
they don't probe into them like they should be
you know other things are more important ricky martin's more important
now you're talking now you get to the matter
you know to any martin is more important for the market martin
all of the martin for any martin
anything that sell a newspaper is what the media will push
and you know like you always talk to you too lame duck newspapers that we have
down here the worst you know they
they determine what's important
enough to print
so they'll take whatever story they can get that they can run with them so more
newspapers out of it
and that's why nobody's really calling you
yelling and screaming because you know like these things come
everybody expects it to happen
and then they leave it alone
okay got unfortunate have a great thing
are you good
okay one call up that a more than we can play some ricky martin music

five six seven o five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line
here's a mobile in Miami hello
i don't know yet sir
i'm going for a time call it right
but i'm a teacher and uh... you know i think that
uh... you know we just got going back and forth i think we said we centralized
a problem and focus on
the problem home with the parents
you know i think that's the number one problem right there man
yeah
they keep throwing stuff at the teacher teachers teachers at you know i'm a
teacher and i go out of my way
it's got to be the best possible
for us to be the classroom and try to you know guide the kids right away but i
mean without the parents support home
i mean things that don't work so i mean we got
you know blame it teacher
what is what was parental support after the with a forty-year-old teacher who's
having sex with her students
and having a couple of mishak up in her condo
well okay i mean maybe not so much uh... for it well for the person for the
teacher
depending on you know whatever issues going on in school
in terms of teaching at home with a tough fight out but i'm saying
the kids at home need to be taught more old than that they should order for them
to know what's right and wrong
yeah i'm going to get that
you understand what i'm saying so i mean
you know i think parents need to become more responsible and i do agree
that some teachers out there have no business being a classroom but
i think we had to focus a little more on the parents
maybe we could put her to work at a strip joint
yeah i think it's a little bit too late for best okay pal have a great day

i can't believe i did that i never do that
even as much of a fat slub as i am i never do that
but you'll be pleased at all in engineering we didn't get it inside the
border near the border just uh
all over my log it's on my log by the way
on the log
oh man what a horrendous grotesque is it on the floor oh jeez
and it's on the floor but we have a nice plastic thing under my feet so no problem
and of course Joe is running around like a maniac in heat
try to make up for those awful steps singing thing there at the restaurant
there man five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line
his little a puddle
there's a little puddle on the floor and i don't know why i'm that excited
because that thing for a mistinkle hasn't come on yet today
let's applaud right ahead here okay onward and upward here's Miami hello
Miami hello yes sir i fail to hear like teacher i'm a teacher myself i fail to
hear teachers talk about as they're going to school to learn to be teachers
they learn a code of ethics and before they sign their contract and get hired
they're also told about the consequences of actions like that of having sex with a teenage
or getting involved and i also fail to hear everybody's not making a big deal
how 15 year old boy with a 48-year-old teacher but they seem to forget about seven
years ago they even made a movie about this world 15 year old kid at sex with a
teacher and the teacher convinced him to kill her husband
right that's the teacher in the winger right and they fail to forget this day
yeah this kid's a horny kid but this person is 34 years old has the mentality the mentality of
a wiser adult then this kid's kid's only thinking about you know getting that piece of ass
right you know and she's exploiting him and using drugs and the car and everything to lure him on
and there's no outrage about it that's the thing that i find amazing nobody seems pissed off about
i'm mad at it because i'm a teacher and i i work with children during school time and after
school i coach children and i know my ethical point of how far i can go with these kids and what
i can say to them and what i what i'm able to talk to them about and i feel to hear the teachers
speak about what they've learned while they were going to school to learn to be a teacher
of what their main purpose is is to make these children good adults to make them you know
profound adults regardless of what they're teaching to make them you know responsible young people
yeah and and i i'm like totally a part that i have to see what calling was not a big deal if my
son was getting i wish i was getting it right right that's right it is a big deal and again keep in
mind that if it were the reverse it was a male teacher and it was a 14 year old girl the audience
would be apoplectic you would have eight zillion people especially the father's calling and saying
where do we find i've got my shotgun i'll personally go down and blow his brains out because that's
the kind of rick zard whoops sexist country that we live in you would have rick zanches on the
core house he'd squatting on their head that's right we're talking about how this is a
button and i these teachers can't just act like oh my god i didn't notice they learned this
they learned this when they were they're going to school and even before they find the contract
they learned this i'm totally appalled and i think that they should be this teacher should be
fired and prosecuted to the folks that regardless of sex whether it's a male teacher or female
teacher or principal or anybody they should be totally taken to the folks and a lot they should
be fired without paying because they did learn this and they have a moral upbringing and they have
they have a standard they have to uphold each other are putting into our trust by the parents
every day for eight hours and then you see when you get into a position whether it's a priest
whether it's a scout leader whether it's a teacher and the kids are putting your care and then
you abuse them and you exploit it then you got to face the consequences i mean i like to think
when these parents drop off these kids to me every day that day in their mind they're i trust
this person for seven hours a day to handle my children with the best of care and all along here
here's the teacher having sex with the kids yeah and i'm totally appalled and i think you need to
continue talking about this until something's on you okay pal you have a nice day hanging there
a lot of teachers call today by the way let's hear it for that a lot of teachers listening to the
show thank god they might learn something here one of the things that they learned unfortunately
is how apathetic the god then public is but they already know that they don't need to listen to the
show to find that out five say i'm just i'm just shaken i'm just a straw for spill i still got
a little bit of a left here which i think i'll drink i got my pizza maybe i didn't know layman
maybe i invented something here hey two great taste the taste great together
and you're bubbling down my trim oh my god scored scored struggling down my chin
i guess that wouldn't be a first time wow come on baby come play with these titties no thanks
five six seven oh five sixty that is not the biggest pile of force crap i have ever seen you time
my fucking fractal like nice club five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the
bubble one line yeah let's just make we got enough drop-ins now i could just have a i wouldn't
ahead of spill a soup i could have had my lunch in peace and we'll just play jim and it drops
don't think he's doing the show will you fudge back in there you go it fits right in
so to speak here's a mobile in four-later day hello okay great a crank call that we couldn't
understand that's my favorite that was real good but he couldn't even get it yeah okay back to you
five six seven probably school board guy five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the
bubble one line here's a mobile in the gables hello hey Neil how's it going another case from
line with you you know it's all more out i mean teachers are taught we're taught that two
things you can't do at school and bell's of money and touch the students now you have these two
teachers up in four water to know that we're having this sex club now that's being totally
exploited and the school boards making a big bruhaha about it and putting them on the spotlight because
this teachers you're you're my contract you are supposed to maintain higher uh moral standards
which means you can't be an alcoholic getting slashed at the local pub right you know parents are
the students seeing you so they the school board has a legitimate gripe with those teachers i
think it's outrageous though because when you have teachers molesting students the school board
wants to keep it all quiet hushed up and try to settle out of court and just you know change for
the teacher to a different school they're in a high school and they mess around with the student
they hushed up and they sent them to an elementary school get them out from a adult you know almost
sound like the church to me right yeah now you know they want to like uh carry flags and saying see
we're trying to protect the students these two teachers in the sex club were really given it to them
i wonder how many students were in there well none you know it's just that the school board is so
hypocritical they want to keep everything very quiet you know when students are hurt or you know
or put in harm's way let's just shut it up and maybe it'll go away yeah and and the same thing
looks ahead but hasn't that been a way in the public school system for even when i was going to
school sweet everything out of the carpet don't make any waves keep it quiet because otherwise
we're in deep crap but here's something where no students will harm so let's make this one you
know let's keep this one out in the and out in the open be make it noisy so the she that we are
doing our best to make sure the classrooms a safe environment and you know something if those
teachers if those people's privacy had been respected and those teachers names would never been
released in the first place which they shouldn't have been then the students would have would have no
different opinion of them and he would anybody else but you know that's that's the media and
that's uh... you know that's a lot of things you can know one person is to blame i think we need
to heart more on these police officers with the sixteen year old and kennel i'm really upset that
that's been sort of hushed down more than my breath let me know when the exhale with the county uh...
you know threatened to cancel the herald subscription or something uh something's up
okay now for the voice thank you five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one
we got a red pepper cord log here today one of the finest logs i've ever seen i might just
lick the log before i get out of here today uh... uh... anybody not in several licked the log uh...
i bet you did Georgia's having quite a conversation over join them i bet you if i said crap on
your real fast you wouldn't hear that twenty one before one at five sixty double

are so what i didn't even tell anybody about it so i could just my thing i was doing it and went
to school and everything was great and moved on now i know what if you would have been a thirteen
and a half year old girl and it would have been a guy the teacher i really i got a daughter and
if that was happening my you know i tell him okay yeah like i said oh guess what the suit

back fast the last time this will be you won't even miss me i won't be gone at long the next
as soon as uh... the moment strikes as lightning strikes here's a mobile in four-lotterdale hello
hey Neil how you doing okay sir um you know i i think a lot of this problem is parents and cells
out i i believe that the parents don't know where the kids are so they must have a lot of time
on their hands those sex is not wrong um i think i think that uh i find it is pretty
i'm in place for you know i find it a pretty far stress that we got people here especially
sexist guys trying to justify a 40-year-old woman having sex with a 14-year-old boy you know
well i i don't know if i justify it or not it's just that thirty nine maybe but maybe maybe
maybe the uh manipulation was you know and the the the alcohol and the drugs that's wrong
uh well we all agree on that i just i just i think i think parents need to
watch where their kids are yeah if they're being if they're not being so
goodbye if you had a 15 or 14-year-old son and he came home with okay and he came home
with a car one day wouldn't you be a little bit stupid like hey uh Eddie what did i come from pal
we would you get that we're gonna steal that car and we know we're gonna license number one
right that age uh um uh i don't i don't know whether he had a license or not but if you know i
i know where my son at right now he's over at the high school playing football okay that's what
they all say when they go over to the city that i i i make sure that's that's where he's at i go
out and i watch some of his practices right i i i get involved with my child i know where my
child is good if my child is over at another friend's house then i know that the parents there
know where they are what they're doing you just not gonna go run the streets and be with his friends
that where they're half backwards and they're drawers hanging down in their ass you know absolutely
i would not let my child do that good time and and and and and the and the teachers themselves
this is the thing is like a baseball and even in a baseball rule book if you look up section 900
and in there it says that umpires as opposed to you left unapproachable what are these what are
these teachers doing you know these teachers are are there they're they're they're hanging
i i've seen my my kids have teachers that are that are mean and nasty yeah and i see this all
the time and when it and until the government decides to start cracking down on this whole situation
it's not going to get any better and we have a lot of problems and you're just not going to get
any better until they just start dealing with them sticks on the lawn in your bus get your sticks at
the exit i did that back to you well i know i had that set up for you know i had to wait but it's
still a good idea they're kind of like stick it in the folks i'd like to see a song about
the American children about me about you about the way our American hearts beat way down in the
bottom of our chest about that special feeling we get in that tackle for all of us maybe go over that
maybe in the sub-copy area maybe in the liver maybe in the kidneys maybe even in the colon we don't know
i'm the student regular Joe with a regular job on your average white
except for the nice one i like the fall and for now it's about four i got an average house
where the nice heart would fall my wife and my job my kids and my car up to my table and the
children to go
but sometimes i just hate enough to keep a man like me
know it uh uh no i've got to go out of town and have fun at someone else's expense
well yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i try really
in the old for bad things while people to see a nice piece of art go in the
high public toilet and i just i'm a sweet how i walk around in the summer time saying

In the candy-cats spaces
Wow, candy-cats people
Make candy-cats the taste
I'm gonna show you the night
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

F***ing night
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, I should be the same in your soul
Ranting and raising and carrying on
Baby, they're right for they sell me out
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna get my stuff when I'm in 1957
And I killed a rattle in a carnival
I think with a whale in a hop-cats
And all other cow and terrier
And thinks brown babies
And steal lines for headlines
Yeah, I'm gonna cry for having that 80s
At 150 miles per hour
Just getting one model for gallons
I can now afford a fine of two
Third of my town in the old fashioned
Not buy a grain of old sourpool containers
And when I'm done sucking down those sweet ball burgers
I'm gonna wipe my mom's in the Americans flag
And then I'm gonna toss the sourpool containers
Right on the side, it depends on the guy
Damn, I'm saying anybody can do a fine
You know why? Because we got the bottom
That's why, two words
You know we are f***ing westerns
Okay, Russia, Germany, Romania
They can have all the democracy they want
They can have a big democracy take the walk right to the middle
And get them into the rest and it won't make a lick of difference
They got weighing out the bottom
So, guys, John Wayne, that's it
He's frozen! And as soon as we find a cure for a candor
We're gonna throw out the juice
And he's gonna be pretty pissed off
You know why? I've drove a tank in a cold shower
We'll multiply that by 50 million times
That's how pissed off the juice can I be?
I'm gonna get the juice, he's a giant cat
And we harvest it and can't take it away
And a case of what he tried on a day to say, you know who really are?
lake
And with all apologies that that caller was just a rousing success, okay?
We couldn't wait another three seconds.
Oh my God, it was a slaughtered day.
But heads, it's a one to two hour.
Hi, I'm Dr. Laura Slesen here.
And I'm here to tell you a little bit about Bouching because it takes a real sour plus
bitch like me to tell you how to do it right beside you don't know how to do it anyway.
Probably too stupid.
But what I do is I spread my leg like this, kind of upside down and squish in Honda
Rosalemans.
Nothing works better than Honda Rosalemans.
Give it a little squish.
All right.
And the reason I play that is because Brian and Boiton Beach factors me a thing from
Hustle Magazine.
Guess who's the asshole of the month?
It's Dr. Laura.
It's excellent.
Nice going, Larry Flint.
Got a whole long, I read it to say a great article.
We don't have time to read it on the air, but a whole list of things about what a lying
bitch she is, you know?
She brags that she put her career on hold for her son's infancy, but she doesn't reveal
that she had three incomes during the boys childhood.
She preaches honor thy mother, but has been estranged from her own mother for 15 years
and has never introduced the woman to her son.
She found that interm aeth marriages, her husband raised the Piscopalian, has not converted
to Judaism.
She talks of being poverty-stricken while her husband was out of work, but he can't remember
an expected period of unemployment.
She castigates people who divorce and leave children, her husband was a married father
of three when she met him.
She has no patience with anyone who complains of poverty, but her show runs ads for Italian
vacations and BMW 7 Series today.
She preaches appropriation over career, but waited until she was at the age of a grandma
to drop her one kid.
She flaunts family values and societal structure, yet sticks her kid with a surname, slushender,
instead of a name of her husband.
I'm Judge Mendoly, she boasts the Bible Caution's Judge Not.
These are just ten of the stupid things that make Dr. Lorraine asshole mess.
Let's hear it.
Hillary Flinagan, okay, Hustle magazine.
Dr. Lorraine, she be the asshole of the month.
Thank you, Brian.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the 18th T-line blog.
I tell you that soup, I think, is what really put me back on the, or even keel here and
got the last pants stuff out of my system.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot, Jim.
Here's Parine.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I was a guy who's talking about Asperine a little while ago.
Got cut off.
Oh, sorry about that.
Well, that was only a couple hours ago.
Let's start all over again.
Yeah, now it was lightning strike.
It took the phone out.
Was that what it was?
Don't tell me it's porn again out there.
It's thunder and pretty bad for crying out loud.
Jesus Christ, it started to get like Florida down here.
Oh, yeah, it's ridiculous.
Man, I'm sick of it.
Definitely.
Anyway, what the Asperine was that was talking to you about?
The problem when you drink it in a diet soda or eat it in a product or whatever.
Yeah.
Exactly.
It, uh, methanol comes out of it and it fits in your system and poisons you.
And then the methanol breaks down into formaldehyde.
Oh, and the ethanol do.
It'll make it.
Yeah.
That big time.
And, uh, it's a slow, cumulative poisoning that, you know, every time you drink it or
ingest it, it builds up and builds up and builds up.
I bet you that's what happened, David Crosby.
Wasn't all that booze, I bet you was Asperine.
Hey, I could have been in that room.
I bet you were up.
So what the problem is, like with the methanol, it starts to degenerate your optic nerves
and it causes dry eyes and all a whole slew of problems.
It's a fun thing.
Wow.
Oh, big time.
No more diet sodas for this kid.
I've drank up drunk my last, uh, I've had it.
And you know, I'm serious about that.
You know, when you're on a plane and they ask you to offer you a beverage, which for the
money that they're charged and even if you don't want to eat their crappy food, you're
going to have the beverage.
Get your club soda, parier, something like that.
You don't have to have a stupid diet coke.
Remember the FendFend product that was out of log, it was great for losing weight,
phenyl fallinine, which is the major component of it.
That's right.
And Asperine as well, which is a major lead problem.
Great.
Very bad.
It's like nothing good in it at all.
And the big kicker of the diet sodas is that after you have it for a while, it actually
promotes weight gain.
And most people think they're going to lose weight.
You know, something I think you just hit on my problem.
You know what?
I haven't been able to, I stay the same.
And even when I have really great days, two, three, four of mineral, that scale won't
barely budge.
And if that goddamn diet sodas, I've read that, even Atkins, by the way, on his diet, says
some people who have an allergic reaction to it, it prevents them from losing any weight
at all.
I think he's got his thumb on it.
It's unbelievable.
Anyway, I wanted to ask you before I go, when you run the best of shows, do you pick
those or just manage them, or what?
I was very worried.
George picks them.
I don't pick them.
But who does?
Whoever shows up to run it.
Because what's right?
I'm over here.
Oh, we don't run that many.
Only when George and I are both out, or like it's an official holiday, we both have the
day off.
So there's a stack of them over there, and whoever comes in, they pick it.
Because like last Friday, you guys ran one, and it was, you had said you were like your
seventh week back from your right, you know, when you left IOD and came back to the radio
on the weekend.
And then you were talking about a story where you had to run two of the same commercial
breaks in the same five minutes spot.
And when you're walking out to your car after the show, two o'clock, one of your co-workers
comes out and was talking to you about it.
And then some bitch, Luann, or screw-in, or something like that.
And yelling is screaming, burrating this guy like a child, and you were going on and on.
No, that was the, was the water not to show?
Uh, yeah.
The water not to.
That's the one.
Do you know, whatever it was, you were just ripping QAM, a new one.
Good.
I feel like I'll pick that one off.
See, must have done that on purpose.
It was hilarious because they could run it again and again.
And again, it's like, they're like, massive kids.
They don't, they like the youth themselves.
They're rip on the air.
No, actually the producers, whoever's in working at, they pick it out.
And actually they hate these people like poison, so they do it on purpose.
Right.
Because they're getting the screw over left and right.
They're not making enough money to rub them together.
Okay, but I have a great day.
Okay, thank you.
And no more of that crap.
No more aspirate, okay?
As is okay, but no aspirate.
That's the message for all your kids out there, okay?
Getting blown away.
That's the American way, but getting blown, that's bad.
That'd be real bad.
Except if it's in the oral office.
Show me yours.
I'll show you mine.
I'm going to show you mine.
I'm going to show you mine.
I'm going to show you mine.
I'm going to show you mine.
I'm going to show you mine.
I'm going to show you mine.
I'm going to show you mine.
I'm going to show you mine.
I'm going to show you mine.
I'm going to show you mine.
I'm going to show you mine.
I'm going to show you mine.
I'm going to show you mine.
I'm going to show you mine.
I'm going to show you mine.
How's that plan for Matt Philharth?
No, no.
You're not here that no one.
That was a fact, Boy, weren't there very long before?
We've just had great stories, including Fat Boy, by the way.
You know something Fat Boy, I'll tell you what?
By 2 o'clock, 46 and half minutes from now, and I know you've been in the building
with your big Fat Ogley body all day long because you have inspired reports on it,
either I'm going to have that pair of tickets for some dolphin games this season
that I asked for for some friend of mine.
Either I'm going to have those,
or I want my dolphin dill tickets and a parking pass
back that I gave you, all right?
And I have no idea why I gave him to you.
In a moment of weakness, in a moment of elusive
any kind of judgment at all.
What a lying big sack of crap.
Oh, yes, Pally, I'm getting them today.
I'll bring them to you tomorrow.
He's in the building and of course laying low
because he knows God damn well.
He don't have any dolphin tickets
because Ray Perry probably wouldn't even look at him.
Nice going, fat boy.
He was a piece of crap on 79th Street.
He was a big fat, smelly piece of turnted paction
and they brought him over here and he's still the same.
Here's the facts from Barton West Palm.
He says the kindergarten teacher decides
he's going to give a lesson object about the five senses.
He wants to start with taste.
So if he brings flavored sucking candies to class,
blindfolds the children and ask them each to taste one.
The students have no problem identifying
the cherry and lime flavors.
But when it comes to the honey suckers,
they're stumped.
I'll give you a hint the teacher says,
you may sometimes hear your mommies and daddy's
call each other this flavor at home.
Spit them out, spit them out, Christ one child.
They're assholes.
Ha, ha, ha.
All right.
Five, six, seven, oh five, thank you Bart.
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60,
pound, five, 60 on the AT&T line.
Here's Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hello Neil, how are you?
Okay, sir.
Okay, so what's all the confusion about when people
are old enough to have sex?
You know, it's the...
What's all the confusion?
Yeah, it's like you can't see the forest from the trees.
And yeah, answer is so obvious.
I can't see it.
How about the whole audience?
Can they see it?
I guess not.
Are you the one that can see it?
You're the one, okay?
It leads us out of the wilderness
into the world of your realities.
Well, the answer comes from Mother Nature and Biology.
Yeah.
It's a puberty.
Meaning what?
That's, that's when someone's old enough to have sex.
Well, we're not talking about physically capable
of having it.
When is it acceptable?
In other words, the 40-year teachers are...
That's a puberty, that's the fact.
Yeah, okay, thank you.
You know who that sounded like?
That sounded like the same pedophile I call
that somebody said he worked for that radio station
with Adam, I want to say Radio Marti.
We're getting that confirmed, by the way.
Are we really?
Yeah, you're not fooling anybody, okay?
This, I'm pretty sure,
although he didn't sound quite as mellow.
He had not quite as good a phone line today,
but that somewhat mellow sounding...
I said, this guy sounds like a radio guy.
Who is this?
Remember that?
And oh, yeah, he likes sitting in him all watching children.
You know, I got news for a sir.
Whether you believe this or not,
there are a few things in the world
that make me more nauseous than pedophiles
than people who pray upon little children.
Makes me nauseous.
Makes me want to barf.
And you happen to be one of them very obviously,
and you could tell it from your previous call,
and we do know who you are,
and that just don't waste my time anymore, okay, Ansel?
God, just pathetic, nauseating.
Yeah, puberty.
In other words, when I first hear a sprouts,
that's okay, you're old enough.
If it's old enough to pee, it's old enough for me.
That's what you say.
That wasn't the pedophile from before.
Oh, it was the different pedophile.
No, that's me.
Are you serious?
The pedophile from before called up
and admitted he's a different pedophile.
So we have a bunch of pedophiles out there.
Good.
Well, we're collecting numbers, by the way.
So when we turn them over, we can do it all at one time.
And as a matter of fact,
since I'm in such a surly mood now about those dolphins,
and tickets, when we turn those numbers in,
I'll give you the name of that guy
that used to work at I-95 before it became Zeta.
Who, by the way, did I ever tell you that he got married?
And the woman that he got married to,
it's her second marriage, she's got a teenage son,
a young teenage son.
Of course, this was a few years ago, but nevertheless.
Oh boy, it's just the beat goes on.
Baby, here's a mobile in Davy.
Hello.
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
Okay, sir.
I think you'd be glad to hear that I helped
you two breaks in the asshole bit.
Are you 37 minutes and 19 seconds?
This man deserves a medal.
Oh, purple heart.
Oh, black you serve.
Black must you, yes?
Plus six mosquito bites.
All right.
All right.
Now, real quick.
Yeah, I thought it started to get like Florida here now.
Real quick, I was brought up basically in the 70s
and my parents who's always told me
to listen to the teachers are basically your parent
when you're out at a home.
Now I'm saying the same thing to my kids.
Now I'm thinking of rethinking that
because of the way they're acting
and the way things are going on.
I'm not talking about the sex clubs
because that's their own time.
But as far as it's almost like praying
on little kids that you said before.
So that's really, that's got me up at arms
and I'm like looking at my daughter
and I'm like, well, don't listen to anybody.
Just do what you want to.
How old is your daughter?
Seven.
Seven.
Seven.
Now you can imagine seven years
when your daughter gets to be 14.
And if there's a 40 year old science teacher
saying her high school or middle school
whatever she'll be at that time, middle school.
And you find out that your daughter is having sex
with this 40 year old man.
I will guarantee you I know what your reaction will be.
Well, I know that his tombstone will read that date.
I don't know, like I'm saying.
That's right.
One quick thing about the police thing.
I live up north, basically, open park.
And a couple weeks ago, I had a cop stop a couple of kids
on a bike.
They were telling each other, you know,
riding on the handlebars and stuff like that.
Horrassed them, followed them down the street,
make sure they didn't get back on.
Couple of weeks later through these big storms,
there was a, we had a flood
to about up to your knees when you standing up.
A lady was stuck in a car with the kid.
Cops, your pastor.
Not trying to help her.
But when he came to the kids in a bike,
they jump out and they tell them get off the bikes and go.
And I love it.
I got in a way.
You know, I don't know what,
well, maybe you think this this morning
because I didn't really see any porkers on the road.
But I was thinking about a conversation we had the other day
about cops harassing the public,
which I always talk about, to serve and protect.
Those are the two words we're always hearing about.
That's the definition of the job of a policeman
to serve and protect.
Not to harass, not to annoy, not to intrude,
serve and protect, period and we're paying their salary.
They would have been a service if they would have helped her.
And one more thing before I go now.
Yes, sir.
I love you, man.
OK.
Sure.
Bye.
Well, there's Madonna.
It's a tentacle.
Slut.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60.
No, I don't like her.
I do like that song, though.
I do like maybe, and it's not just because of Austin Powers.
I like the song.
It's a good song.
What does it call?
Stranger, beautiful, stranger.
Well, even I see I try to block those things out of my mind.
Like fat boys.
You hear with the tickets yet, by the way?
Oh, no.
See, if I find out that he's been yanking my chain again
about that, and not that it's a big deal,
I don't owe this porter at the airport any tickets
around me, but he's a nice guy.
I always have a chat with him.
He's always very nice to me.
And why the hell not?
Do something nice for somebody.
And if you can't do it, then don't, oh, yeah, no problem,
pal.
I'm going to see you at that.
This was on Monday.
Today is Thursday.
It's getting perilously closer to the end of the week.
I said, I need it by Friday.
I want them by Friday.
Have we seen Heidner here at this fat cow today?
No.
Maybe he's over in Halea.
Here's Davy.
Hello.
Greetings, Lord Rogers.
Yes, sir.
Did you see this thing on the news the other day
about there was a tree somewhere in South Florida.
I remember the city, but some of the trees in South Florida?
Yeah, and some bark fell off of it.
And some lady thought that it was the image
of the Virgin Mary.
All right.
All right.
Everyone comes up with candles and cards.
Start lighting it.
There's hundreds of people there praying to the tree.
All right.
Now, then they have this one lady.
Oh, my God.
That's why I love that.
Then they have this one lady who comes.
She goes, I don't believe in, I don't go to church
or believe in God, but I believe in this.
It was ridiculous.
I could even believe it.
Doug and she under, oh, that's right.
It was the 18th, it was five days after she appeared at Ramosa Lopez's house
in Hollywood.
She's everywhere.
Oh, hey, can I get a request?
Yes, sir.
Buffalo Bill, lotion in the basket for my brother
who's down visiting from New Jersey.
OK, you got it.
Thanks.
Have a great day, son.
Watch out and say hi to Virgin Mary for us.
All right, the Virgin Mary is hanging out in town.
I think she's barking up the wrong tree myself.
This is Debbie.
This is Debbie.
Hello, Debbie.
I'm here to see and get some operations done.
OK.
And some body contouring and some liposuction.
And there was wondering if there's some tummy tuck.
And the lip augmentation cosmetic compresses
the face gift to all of these things.
And I was wondering.
What would you like to start with?
Well, I need to get everything done.
Probably the first thing I'd like to have removed
is my thing.
OK, we don't do that.
No.
Could you do breast implants, though?
It can be done, but I don't know what they would do right away.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
How much?
5,000.
Excellent.
I'd like to have my skin resurface, too.
Lace surgery.
Have the lamb stop crying yet, mommy?
Excuse me.
Don't hurt mommy's little baby.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I'd like to get the liposuction that I saw on TV.
OK.
Can you make me look more like a woman?
Well, we'll have to see you first.
And then upon looking at you, we can tell you that when we see you.
Should I wear my skin suit made of body parts, mommy?
If you'd like to.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Would you like to make an appointment?
Yes.
OK.
There is $100 consultation fee.
That's fine.
OK.
OK.
My name is Buffalo Bill.
OK, let me get a little information from you.
OK, just one moment.
Right.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I understand.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Do you want to come in for a consultation?
It puts the lotion in the basket.
OK.
Would you like to make an appointment?
Or do you want to call me back?
There.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I understand.
I got my skin suit, nip on my glasses.
Bill.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I understand that.
Would you like to make an appointment?
It puts the lotion in the basket.
OK, I will talk to you in the time.
OK.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
one twenty three at five fifty two and we got the
years that got between two and four thirty we apologize but in any rate so
fat boy calls up George during the uh... while we were listening to that
and tells him about a beat by the boot but about the end of the day a repair he
did this in this one did that and he don't have
see i think if i take back i never want to be an indian gebra i never do that but
in this case i would make an exception because if i took back the bills
often to get in the parking pass that would sell two problems
number one would correct the mistake that i made by giving them to in the first
place and that would provide me with tickets to the parking pass to give to a guy
who's a good guy that i promise them to that would solve a lot of problems
that are great seats to by the way club seats my seat
she'll do something nice for somebody and they show their appreciation by
doing what they do best feeding you a bullcraft line this man has gotten more
crap that's why he's so big i don't think it's just the food you know
i think that you want walking around in your then full of crap i think that it
starts to show
and believe me it's shown
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eight tnt wireless line
here's a mobile in del Rey hello
you yes sir
i'm going to police officer i thought i'd give you a call to hear in that
smoke that just called you a second ago you know you see our job is to serve
and protect which are absolutely right our job is also to enforce the law
and if that guy and half a brain and it's had realized that when we stop these
kids that are told on our bicycles we use those small statutes small
reasons like that to stop and you can check kids out and if you had any
brains that i realize that these are the kids that are doing burglaries and
robberies and things of that nature i can't tell you how many times i've
pulled guns and dope and god knows what else all these kids yeah and it all
starts out with a simple thing like so on the bicycle or something like that
you know and uh... it's ashamed it you know comments like that just
perpetuate this resentment towards long force well there is a lot of
reason because people get tired of the radar traps and the speed traps in the
uh... and the sex club braids and all this other crap you're right as far as
a prostitution tonight agree with you as far as that but
well what would this like without trafficking force and if we don't
know right i will be driving like a plus can i tell you i want to tell you
something yesterday you know every Wednesday not to go to pomp and park okay
and i get off the turnpike there and i make my right on Atlantic and i to make
the turn power line
now i don't know if you're familiar with that excited that intersection
and i can't rely very heavily trafficked okay uh... travel and this is about five
forty five and a little rush hour traffic this happens every week in last
night i counted
six
after the light had been ran the red light
that made the left turn yeah you know from the other way under our power
line going to rock six six pairs because it's a double-laying o'turnlain
that's right i'm thinking of myself how long is it going to be before somebody
starts doing something about this it's got to stop
you can call the epidemic of this down here
you can call the chief of the agency request our enforcement of the
legal intersection but
every cop i know
and my including myself we do this job with integrity and them
dedication to serve the public
and people need to realize that
when you come home and your doors pride open from a burglar were first one through
the door
okay we would just appreciate it's a little more respect and understanding of
our jobs it's very frustrating to hear that
and i don't know how much of a lot of our defense and i can watch
you know a little appreciation will be nice work hard what i think we are
i we all appreciate good cops but uh... you know there are you have to admit
their plan it's a show and i'm sure you agree with this that there's more
integrity and less criminal activity from police officers in the clergy
well done back
i don't know you won't get any debate on it here
yeah i hear you there okay pal
thanks for letting me get on the phone but that's a good day
okay i'm requesting officially whoever's in charge up there in pop it'll be
to add lantican power line
do something before a whole bunch of people get killed up there it's only a
miracle we're talking six seven eight people just come flying around there
long after the light is turned red
the left turn light
and you know that because you're like to go straight ahead is green
so that they're rocket scientists to figure out that they're running the god
damn light
it's everywhere it's not just there but that's one of the worst you have never
they just come flying around there
and god forbid that you should know be sitting there waiting to make your turn
i forget about turn our right turn on red i'm talking about making a turn on
a green light
because they'll kill your ass
speaking of popular park by the way and it's a good thing i read the program
and listen carefully because david horrors he tell me what's going on over
there no carol how does he tell me no salesperson has got his account
no heinous no penis whatever's name is
so anyway popular park last night they announced that the this weekend we got
live racing proddy and setter day and then we have no more live racing
until september third we got simul casting every day monday through
saturday but they're gonna take a couple weeks off from live racing and after
what i saw last night by the way not a bad idea
but anyway so here's the deal we got simul casting today being the
thursday freehold at one o'clock started half hour ago
buffalo raceway one fifteen tonight's i would have downed the high-line
rosecroft meadows hazel park would buy nyankers who's your balmerl
so you got plenty of action and plenty of reasoning out to pop it up park monday
through saturday but don't forget live racing resumes on friday
september third with the wednesday friday and saturday schedule right through
the summertime at pop it up harness

Amazing.
tickets member your good close personal friend that you like so much and then I can't stand
Peter Leonard.
We've been here like two days ago and I told him the same thing about I could sure use
those tickets and fat boys been to let me down.
Oh no problem.
I'll go see about them.
I'm okay.
You know, what's happening?
What's doing?
I'll go get them.
Have we seen them since?
No.
No.
See, one thing about IOD, say what you will, but when they had the dolphin games and we
were over there, if I needed to pair tickets for the dolphins or whatever it would be, whether
it was for me or somebody else or grandma Moses, all you'd have to do was just mention it.
And before I lock Gary Mills or Jeff Clark or Rick Alpo or somebody, sales hall would
come by, hey, here you go.
Here's a pair of tickets parking pass.
You know, does that happen here?
No.
And of course at IOD they also been charged for station paraphernalia like caps and t-shirts
and stuff like that.
You hear the price tag on those right?
No.
Those shirts?
You'll never guess.
25 bucks.
E.
30.
30 dollars.
For that, for a piece of crap, you I'm sure?
Shirts and caps and they're charging the hired hands here to buy their own promotional
stuff.
That's how cheap the beesleaves are.
It's just unconsumably.
It's unbelievable.
Why do I hear the facts?
Because I like to give all sides of all stories from Dr. Dean Del on the internet about
the Asperer-Tame Hoax.
And I don't know.
I would like to believe this.
It says, I'd like to say congratulations to Time Magazine for sending the records straight
on the artificial sweetener Asperer-Tame.
This is from way back in February this year, by the way.
As you may know, there's been a deluge of inaccurate information being said over the
internet about this sweetener.
In a full page story, Timed the Bunked the email attack on Asperer-Tame by using good
old investigative journalism, the email barrage against Asperer-Tame makes various negative
claims and the timewriter checked each one out.
What she discovered was they were indeed unsubstantiated or downright bogus.
For example, writer Christina German looked into one claim that Asperer-Tame leads to
methanol toxicity and her conclusion was not even close.
She notes that there's four times as much methanol in a glass of tomato juice that there
is a can of Asperer-Tame sweet and soda.
And our bodies have no trouble handling such a small amount.
And it goes on and on and on and says, beware any of the crappy read on the internet to
which I would say am into that.
All of Loneolos' ridiculous stories about the proctor and gamble and the guests that
supposedly were on with Sally Jessie.
I mean, there are more lies and more distorts that involve bulk, more bullcrap that they
would be a drug up on the internet.
Dreadjup?

Here's Hollywood.
Hello.
Hollywood.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you today?
Okay.
Good.
I'm back at the steal at the woman who had sex with a minor.
Although there was drugs involved, I definitely disapprove of that.
However, I'm not, maybe I'm mistaken.
I'm not sure.
Maybe you can tell me in the state of Florida is it not legal for someone to marry a minor?
I don't know.
I really don't know about that.
I'm sure it must be.
I mean, there are people under 17 who get married.
Yeah, well, that kind of sets a double standard.
I know you can't tell me that only folks that are marrying minors.
I can't say there's a lot of them, but people that do it.
I'm not having sex now.
They're just not having sex now.
Not a lot.
But that's way until the states is okay.
Now you can go ahead and do it.
They set their self up for a life of misery by being married to someone first.
Then you're allowed to have sex with a minor.
All right.
Well, that's all I had.
Can I call somebody a doufex?
Yes, sir.
Brandon, on your way to West Palm, you are a major doufex.
Okay.
Take care.
56670560.560 on the AT&T line.
Their audience is all over the place on this.
I think it's almost the unanimous we agree on the drugs and the cocaine and the acid and
buy on the car and all of these things.
But on the sex part, there's a tremendous ambiguity here, which it's kind of surprising to
me because I think that when you're reading about a 40-year-old woman having sex with a 14-year-old
boy, especially in this case, who are being the teacher of the class and also shackling
up a bunch of kids, underage kids in her condo, that people will be just screaming bloody
murder, but they're not.
However, it's also been unanimous that if it was a girl who was the 14-year-old and if
it was their daughter, that they'd be no person's assed.
56670560.560 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.
Hello?
Neil, how's it going?
Pretty good, sir.
Listen, I had a call in the address that I told my ass cop that was looking through life
in his rose-colored glasses there.
I called you a few minutes ago.
I mean, give me a break.
Even the example he gave.
Oh, my God.
Well, maybe before you go on, let me give you the good news.
I did my little pitch and a trooper from up there in that Pompato beach area called George
and he's going to take it into his own hands.
They're going to start patrolling that power line Atlantic and watch him for these assholes
running light.
But then we go ahead.
That's fine.
That's fine.
If they're actually doing legitimate things that are actually creating a safer environment
for us to live in, that's fine.
Right.
It's a fact.
It's a fact.
The fact of the matter is he carries all these examples.
The one I really impressed me was the fact that, oh, we have higher moral standards than
the clergy.
That's pretty impressive, obviously.
Yeah, that's a pretty good example.
Yeah, that's a pretty good example.
He should have said radio salespeople.
I would have been good.
I got to give you a quick story.
And this is the God's on.
Well, whatever.
Whoever's honest.
The fact of the matter is I have some good friends of mine who happen to be a little
darker in complexion than myself.
And I can't tell you how many more times, way more than ten, let's say.
Where I've ridden with him and he has been stared at, he has been pulled over, he has
been harassed.
Just for the fact that, yeah, he makes a pretty good income.
He drives a high dollar vehicle and it's the same old stereotype.
And I understand there, because I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.
If you did, I mean, it's pretty nice ride to ride around anyway.
But no.
He's a legit guy.
Him and his wife are both CPAs and they're real good living.
Now, I understand that the majority, it's a delight.
I mean, the majority, I hate to say this, but I mean, obviously the majority of what
they deal with is probably your minorities and so forth.
But you can't carry that stereotype through everyone.
You've got to give him a chance at least.
And this guy doesn't realize that I also have friends that are cops that, they're friends
of mine, but they still discuss me at times because I listen to the way they talk and I
listen to the way they carry out.
Well, I understand where the guy's coming from.
He's a cop and evidently he's conscientious and he's, you know, he's very trying very
hard to do good job in there.
He's like, however, for a cop and stop flow to be talking about the high standards of
the law enforcement people, in this area, I mean, people are just going to be peeing in
their pants laughing because there is a day goes by that we don't have another horrendous
scandal story going on here.
It's a complete joke and let me ask you this.
You know, if you had a certain problem with a certain type of person, be it any type
of person, okay?
What's your opinion going to be about that group people later on in life when you experience
it?
It's going to be noisy, right?
Well, guess what?
People have a lousy attitude towards cops for the most part and have a little respect for
the fact that there's no respect shown that they're prior in their life.
Right.
That's right.
And people don't want to be harassed.
They don't want to feel like we're peeing somebody's salary to hassle us.
That's not what we're peeing people to do.
Right.
I mean, if I'm doing something wrong and you straighten me out fine, I have no problem
with you.
But if I'm just, I mean, it's unbelievable, the double standard, which, I mean, even
in normal life, most of the most part, the biggest hypocrites I've ever seen in my
life.
So, anyway, I'll pass the word on.
I had a vent.
Okay, cool.
Okay.

Good afternoon, señorito Niel.

Thank you.

No, I said señorito.

Yes.
I don't know what that is.

Oh.
Okay, whatever you say.
It's like senior but you know like with feeling with care.
With the Rock-Lonus, okay.
Right.
The intersection of 36th Street, Northwest, 87th Avenue here in D'Areal.
Yes.
We need two Metro-day cops to monitor that intersection.
So I'm putting a plea out in the air right now.
Okay.
I'm going to lunch now at 12 o'clock and I'm like the fourth person waiting to go straight
through that intersection and sure enough, six other cars are just going and going after the
after we got the green.
And then you can't make the green light.
Right.
Right.
I mean sometimes.
Well that to me is not only are these people in danger and are they like attempting murder
by doing that and breaking law in a very dangerous way but they also prevent the traffic
from moving when they have the green light.
Right.
So if you got for better like fifth or sixth in line, they haven't got a Chinaman chance
to make it a two light because by the time you get up there now it's back there right
again.
That's right.
I'm the fourth person waiting to go straight and the people in the front are actually waiting
for these people to clear and then they will go.
Right.
You know, but what I do is when I'm the first one in the front and I get the green, I start
to move forward but people still, you know, they look at me like, hey, what are you doing?
You're going to go.
You got a lot of nerve going on a green light.
You know what they end up doing?
They end up going around me and then going around the other person that's waiting and the opposite
side turning left.
So they're like making an S turn around me.
Yeah.
I think they love the other three letters out of the S.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Shameless requests.
Yes sir.
Haven't heard this one in a long time.
Tiny hooters.
Okay.
Please.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Bye bye.
Is that in here by the way?
Is tiny hooters in here?
Okay.
It's coming up.
Okay.
Five-set.
Look at that.
We only got two calls left and you want to know why because we got Jersey guys coming up
at two o'clock and that's, you know, people are starting to get a little bit nervous.
They're shying away from the radio.
Come on.
He doesn't bite.
He's not all that bad.
Is he?
Come on.
Five-six and we've been kicking serious ass here.
In fact, during these hot dog days of the summer last few weeks, we actually have been doing
okay.
Not spectacular.
They're considering what a bunch of deadheads you are not too bad.
But now we only got what, 12 minutes to kill here.
And I think they're getting a little bit shying away from Jersey guys.
Who's coming up at two?
Four-hank.
Five-six, seven-oh-five-sixty, pound-five-sixty on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes sir.
How are you?
I'm fine.
Teacher who resigned last week from day county public schools.
Really?
Going up to Orlando, moving out.
Got tired of this town.
Yeah, I don't blame you.
I'm outta here.
All the way to Orlando.
Is that a picnic up there?
I don't think it's better for me.
I'll should be making more money.
That's for sure.
He did make more money than teachers.
Right.
So that's that's a piece of cake.
All I have is a shameless request.
You can put on anything you want.
Say, leave a dirt-shape.
Neil.
Okay.
Good luck, pal.
Have a good day.
You can give it to you too.
Here's the guy, Betlon Outer.
He ran.
It's unscibalized.
It's barbaric.
It's a jungle.
And like I said, nobody cares.
These last two days have proven to be on a shadow without here on this.
Highly listen to a highly talented, highly rated show.
I mean, just the nobody gives the crap here.
And that's the sad part.
Because there were a few people that had borrowed school board meeting, mostly media people.
But there were some angry people.
And even the old fart showed up, who usually are like, everybody's a pervert.
Because they can't do it.
But nevertheless, even they were saying, leave the guy to have their teachers alone.
And cut the crap and stop sticking to your nose and everybody's business.
Let us do that, you know.
But you can't convince the people on here.
Because there just aren't enough people who speak out on anything.
That's why all this crap goes down.
You know, that's why it just keeps going on and going on.
It'll never change.
Never end.
And now they got this thing with a city of Miami and the former accountant for the police department in the city of Miami.
Who died after he stole a million dollars.
And now he's saying Donald Worsher out of police chief.
He was involved in it.
And the FBI is looking into it.
And even though there's no accusations yet.
And the beat goes on and it goes on.
But in the meantime, where's the money going to come from for that stadium, huh?
There's 800,000 or a million who's counting now that vanished from the city of Miami.
But we're going to keep money for a baseball stadium, right?
No.
Seriously, people who are proposing these things, who are even seriously suggesting these things,
who are even contemplating these things, even semi-seriously, those people need to be locked away to protect all the rest of us.
They're crazy people.
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.
Hello.
Neil, thank you for taking my call.
A couple of looking year call, sir.
Yeah, a couple of book opinions and a profound story.
First of all, without questions, the gaki sucks.
And if you heard yesterday, there's a gaki sucks.
Them for sucked also.
At any rate.
But he's a good guy though.
I like him on the games, but top show host he isn't.
Yeah, the game he's okay, but I'm just telling you, his infer is a good guy.
All right.
I'm going to read.
A significant story.
I agree with you.
Pretty much 100% with regards to the cops.
