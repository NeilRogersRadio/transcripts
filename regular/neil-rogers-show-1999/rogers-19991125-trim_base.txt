god what a hysterical spick
and what is that stuff that i'm here in the back do you hear that
or that the tv set
or city v said
all he's even turned up the volume to make sure i don't waste any time talking about
how jack cohen of pizza lot
ponytail sit on a four-year-old
this is because this outfit is so glad to in cheap now people say well they're
paying you all that money in her pan the hank big bucks let me just tell you
this okay this show more than pays for itself if they ever get the rest of the
spot school in which i don't
but at any rate uh... this show is going to make them a lot of money and they know
that so the fact that they're paying me money that's beside the point because it's
coming back and then some
but when it comes to other money i mean wait the the capper is the waste
baskets are coming here on a monday morning a little bit down because of that
horrendous game last night again that was very depressing when you blow up with
seconds like we're good at that one thing they're good at is blowing it if i can
say that and your choice me the latest additions i'm asking about that they get
the phones fixed out so the audience can hear on hold and he says uh... now i
said how about like the uh... monitors there the uh... cannot be overhead is
that working better now but how about the waste baskets now we're talking we
have here at wqa m two waste baskets the size of your thumbnail seriously
algolds thing is got a bigger back up than these uh... waste baskets that's not
even a contest in fact we each one of these could be one of our cheeks
this is the best we can do and then come to find out this is from the janitor
we felt sorry for us because we've been using cardboard boxes since we've been
working in the last few weeks and now we got waste baskets the size of your
anus i mean just uh... unbelievable and ponytails jeth Cohen buys us because
they do a lot around here was supposed to have a tv with the via with the
direct with a uh... dc s system in a whole bit
and of course we don't have that less it's an invisible one so we'd have like a
little bit of contact i tried to explain to these people that they don't understand
sitting in a room with a microphone is not being a radio station the audience
would have a little bit more confidence in tuning in if they felt that we had
some of you know having a window here so we can see the old parts over there
that's nice but if we had a little contact with the outside world so when they
start dropping nuclear weapons when the illegal aliens and all those new baseball
players are coming in from the pahamas that we might be able to see them step on
sure no that something was going on outside as opposed to just being in a
vacuum here but we don't want to get carried away so what kind of some
sellvania haha
hahaha
so vanya yeah i'm her mother and what we don't want to get carried away here he only
had one big night the many great picture you're just sending it up i don't see
any picture yet I see sherry Lewis kill at pitch with those stupid puppets you
gonna have to get a better picture in here than that

a judge well whether he's the mayor or judge we know he's a fag one or the other
but what is that all about but judge judy she's the one that takes no crap
she's everybody's favorite hanging judge she's almost as popular as that bitch
dr. Laura which speaking of dr. Laura after Phil Henry called in here on the
Friday on the air I spoke to him off the air for several minutes you don't
want to know you don't want to know see I keep telling you what a crap
business this is which it is they are screwing with this poor guy out there in
LA I don't want to get him in trouble or anything but man oh man they're
giving him crap yet he had to talk to dr. Laura's rabbi and a pot this is not

the air that's the rabbi huh what was the rabbi going to do to him if he didn't
apologize if he didn't apologize making y'all know he was gonna make him
sacrifice his bald spot or something but so we had a color rabbi was
forced to color rabbi and apologize for a ripened dr. Laura and ass on the air
which he deserves and by the way you can catch you right now at 940 on the
stupid network if you want it to end to dr. Laura oh thank you Phil is
gonna set a big way spasco we get stick rag reads ass in there no

yet you're music store soon and experience Peter Paul and Marley
he goes up and smoke
you know my topic today is a are we ever going to teach black people to speak
English I was going home from here on Friday and you know the turnpike the
best way by the way George although you don't I don't know which way you go
home you don't you I take county life oh but anyway instead of going back by
pp park which I don't like that whole because it reminds me of my accident
brings back bad memories I do come in that way in the morning but going home if
you just go for 41 to county line road to the turnpike right by the track
isn't there an exit there also getting off the stadium I don't want to get
off with this stadium if you pardon the expression but anyway that's the best way
so anyway I go through there I put my 50 cents in the thing and there's a couple
dark-complexed young guys who are standing there obviously work for the
state for the attorney pike authority whatever they do at least I think they
do where they stole those raincoats but anyway they're standing there and you
know I'm rolling down my window to put the 50 cents of two coins in the
bet box and I can hear their conversation and I thought huh what a run-up
I'm making no no these were not Jamaican oh they were American
dark-complexed people these were not Haitian are completely American these
were American very dark-complexed people who know speak in English see
everybody's always at the risk of sounding like I want to ingratiate the
specs everybody's always screaming about the old Julio's the done speaking
English I got news for at least the young Julio's speak English English is
my second except for Anna squeak who still hasn't learned after 30 years but I
mean this is not a joke this is not a joke and my question today is how is it
this a bonnix thing I mean we made a good joke out of that we had fun with that
because it's laughable at best and pathetic at worst they used to call it in
Florida when I first came here a hundred years ago they called it social
promotion and I said what's that and they said oh it's because we got some
people who just can't learn anything so instead of having to be 30 years old
and still be in third grade we keep moving them along because then they keep up
with their peers and of course supposedly they got rid of that well guess
what there ain't no way there do not be no way that that be gone because there
are people who cannot I'm not talking about things like let me ask you a
question which of course we all know is grammatically incorrect and very
embarrassing and even some of the Julio's now is there I told you I called my
doc yes yes he gives me a frown mr. uptight speak they must be Puerto Rican some
of the weekends are now talking like well some of the darkened by the way
speaking of dark complexion how about that it'll do Kay he'll do spag now his
agents got him over there in the Bahamas waiting for a better deal he's to have
lots of slaves in Cuba waiting for a better deal and of course comes to find out
that these other five people that he's trying to get visas for and master cards
one of them is an outfielder all right yeah that's the whole integration system
now okay all you poor Haitian backbids and everybody else that's been waiting
on and the people like from the various countries in Europe who've been waiting
online for like the last 75 years to get a green card in a visa and maybe we
might be nice and luck to let you in but if you can heave the ball baby if you
can throw it if you can sling it if you can hit it I almost peed my pants when I
heard that one of the other guys is an outfielder so from now on when we
get you know these little uh... wickety boats with a Haitian that come up on
sure the first question is gonna be when they come up on sure when they get
them the coast guard anybody here picture hit they're not going to say anybody
here picture catch because that of course would be a different story let's do
a lady in pember pine hello hi niel yes ma'am I went back to school but before I
went I just wanted to call and clear something up I there's something I don't
understand unfortunately I've had to listen to you for a few days and I don't
get what people keep kissing your butt wait wait wait wait wait
well you had to listen to me for a few more because my brother wanted to take
the first show of you so like I wanted to I had to like change the tape to make
sure to run out so I had to listen a little bit yeah what about the other
days well I'm in the and I don't I don't have the you know I'm not in control
the radio but everyone called in kids is your but all you've been gone my life's
been a mess I don't understand what I've been doing uh-huh but all you do is
complain people need to get a life yeah I don't understand what what's the
what's the fascination with you I don't know but you you must be
fascinated enough to call the show I just have no life yeah maybe you have a
a reason for for why everyone's so enthralled with you maybe they like to
other people complain yeah maybe they like it like it like it is like like
would you like life to be sugar coated is that no no but I certainly don't
want to hear about him I don't then don't tune it in very simple you don't
have to call me and tell me you don't want to hear
but I have a pinion what is it I didn't have a pinion it's not a question of
having an opinion to question what you want me to talk about I'm not gonna
talk about stuff that's of interest to you what is audience in the hemorrhoids
deeply okay this audience is big on hemorrhoids unfortunately I understand
this is bad fact have you ever had hemorrhoids no no what the hell do you know
about it get out of here you crazy bitch what the hell does she know she is a
walking hemorrhoids that's fucking bitch exactly she's bitching about the
fact that you're talking about hemorrhoids you have them sometime honey you
have hemorrhoids when you can't even put your ass on the seat when all of a
sudden that feeling comes in your stomach when you know nature is calling and
you dread you're dread making that move toward the pot because you know the
pain in Spain is mainly in your reign as god have you bought it and asked don't
I know they're not bad they're not that bad they just are persistent and I
think when Greg Reed moves to Arizona or somewhere I think they might just have
a tendency to go away I love callers like you sweetheart if I could get 10
people like you every day we have a 95 here but and you notice it always starts
out the same she's been forced to listen for several days and even though she's
not taping for her brother today she's listening again today so she can tell
you chapter in verse everything I'm talking about that this pleases her
ugly ass so much that she felt compelled to call in and she can't understand
why anybody would listen to this show that's fucking bitch exactly get a life
sweetheart she's talking about nobody else has got a life but she's being
co-wrote she's being held at gunpoint and forced to listen to this show here's
Miami hello Neil yes sir I can't believe you ragged on handsome yeah good harmony
good harmony band they suck I do a harmony band give me a break those kids are
like they're like from outer space hey they got their hidden all the ranges
there they're getting all the notes in I think I think they're great
you know I like their version of the star spangled banner at the yeah the
island came when they were boot off and boot off the field it inspired us to
make three notes a matter of fact they boot before the song but after the song
they got in a plus yeah yeah they boot them cuz I was there I know
handsome blows you're wishing they blew you me no I do not hey no and I think I
think they're up your alley oh okay alley okay peda-fot see the nice
say that like we're towards in the call I can smell them growing man into a
bunch of little kids that look like little girl
five six cut the crap here's Palm Beach hello yeah I know I listen to you
past couple of shows that you did and no perception of black and
mountain is very focused you know because if you look at white and the
Appalachian West Virginia their language is just as bad as any other race of
people yeah it just depends on your educational background that's why that's
what I just got your same little while ago when I was talking about that your
educational background but let me ask you something how come the people the the
white people in South Florida who go to the same schools that the black people
go to how come they speak English most of them they may not be rocket scientists
and how come they speak proper English and an awful lot of the black people keep
moving ahead one grade do another and then another and they can't speak English
what is it let me tell you that they're black that are 10 same school that
speak English just as well they are white that are 10 the same school it's
important you know that you can't say certain race of people speaking English
any worse than another race here I can because it's true you're in denial sir
you're in denial you have you have the fast improvement if you can I have this
right here on the stat sheet they brought them from the game and I said the
statue right in front of me inner city you I'm talking inner city youth I'm
talking about right appear on the turnpike yesterday I'm going or Friday going
home and I'm and I hear this all the time I hear this from adult women I hear
it from teenage black kids I hear them speaking crap cock that is not that is not
the English language and people shouldn't be allowed to graduate from one class
to one other until I can speak properly let me say this nice circle wouldn't you
agree that unless you speak English properly you're not going to go anywhere I
agree with you let me say this nice circle of black friends we speak proper English
well thank god for you sir what didn't don't stereotyp what do you mean by that
don't say I say didn't we didn't George interject there and make a point of
saying that there are about 20 people black people who speak English properly
to use specifically pointed out sticks and black okay what about the
Apple would have been exaggerating what about the I don't live in the Appalachians
okay I don't care about Appalachian whites there are white people in the
Appalachian they're a place for them they're a white people right here and speak English
either they're talking white trash now okay we categorize everyone don't
specifically point out blacks and sticks well there's a
there a Julian Julian bond speaks perfect English okay well I'm just saying you
bring it if Julian bond can speak perfect English like I had all the young black
people speak perfect not all white people speak perfectly well forget about white
people not a perfect society not everyone's gonna be on a side not not everyone's
gonna be on the same level why not no society is why not no society is on well let's get
with it let's get with it I say let's be getting with it yeah well let's get all the
white children the black children and they spend a turn together and I forget about those
sticks they're worried about Cuba forget about that other than that I think you
sure they're okay okay thanks a lot he thinks it's okay hi this is Jocelyn
Elders and I'm mad mad at those right wing sons of bitches that force Bill
Clinton to find me just order the hell they think they are all I was trying to do
with deal with the reality of sex and teenagers maybe if Jesse Holmes had
busted chip or new gang rich had butters the corner a little more it wouldn't be
so uptight slogging the dog never heard anybody and if people did a little
more of it we might say some lives hell of Clinton just stayed home and spanked
the monkey he'd even been less hot water teaching kids about masturbation would be
no big deal we could even take some standard teaching tools and just twist them
around a little bit like see dick run when you see dick run get to the doctor
because you picked up a bad case of Crouch Crickets folks we got to get
real about the realities of the world we live in there are too many kids out
there taking a baloney ride and parking there y'all in hair harbor now we just
teach them to stay home and paddle the pickles pump the python walk the
doll wax the carrot or tickle the taco we'd all be better off and that's all I
have to say now I'm going home now I see if mr. Elders wants to pop it in the
toaster and hail oyster and buzz the briller here's a lady in Miami hello
Neil I just had to call you it's hey you that guy that's just called talking about
different lengths is a black people whatever yeah yeah you have a watch
the Jerry Springer late at night Jerry Springer yeah and what if I did I would
never admit it's every way have you ever heard it was for people with a with an
inverted penis anyway have you ever heard this to me it like trail tracks why
you get on there of course that if they didn't have the all those shows it be
off the air if we'd have trailer park trash okay and a lot of a little bit of
black people okay well they have a lot of you little white people in it
won't sound a talk like there's so down to earth as it does to store brother yeah
okay what's the point the point is yes you have many more ignorant white people
that cannot talk good English or proper English and blacks yeah trust me well
there's always Chris Darden I don't give a shit anyway
you pretty good second of all second of all putting in a fixed case but he's
pretty articulate I don't give a shit I mean I don't really don't care about
them really don't about Johnny Cochrane Cochrane yeah thumbs up bro
this to me okay you know you're used to eat too much of ratings you
wait this is gonna go up you want to get some more beer boys out there tell
people where you are that car that because then money sweetheart this
money you know that into that now they bought them they may have it but they
don't want to get a boom once everybody knows your back right yeah for real
I mean some fans speaking of you the other day yeah how I heard you would
come back well I was surprised to describe that even listen to you yeah
another closet listener huh no probably a bike I don't know about it yeah see I
wouldn't surprise me I don't know about her personal little life about a
cycle whatever goes the same Catherine's and buys bill those listen sweet you
have a great day and I'll see on the Jerry Springer show this is sports radio
560 Q a l
yes that we had a very brief conversation and unfortunately should have
gone on a hell of a lot longer because I brought up the topic of illiterate
black people and why it's part of the whole conspiracy of keeping blacks down in
American society which it is and of course many blacks become very upset about
that there was one very articulate black car who called in and said that we
were generalizing which we were not and we got sidetracked on the whole thing
but I was thinking about it after the show and that is there forget about the
appellates and that I want to hear about all these other places this guy was
bringing into conversation but like we're here in this town if you want to talk
about ethnic minorities Cuban kids I'm talking about Cubans who were born in this
country they go to the same school they take English and the other courses and
they speak basically perfect English then they have a little spanglish in
there but they speak English perfectly fluently and they don't say let me ask
you a question black kids born in this country they not kids that were brought
over in crates hundreds of years ago black kids born in this country go to the
same school and many of them are we generalizing many of them most of them speak
I don't know about most blackies a lot of too many I think it depends on the
neighborhood on the hood yo yo yo yo you're the generalizing now mama and
I think you're wrong I think that if you get around a bunch of young black
guys for example most of them will talk blackies which is not English and if
you speak blackies I mean it's a free country you're you know you're entitled
to do that but you ain't going to be going nowhere unless of course you're one of
those one in ten billion people like in you know seven feet tall and play
back to ball something like that or unless of course you have a visa from
other Clinton administration to come over here that thing the ill-doca thing is
the most unacceptable disgrace that I've seen in a long long time and that
all of a sudden it's interesting the way the TV news people who a couple of
days ago all this is the greatest thing we ever saw and ill-doca we've got to
get another picture and hey maybe the marlins won't be so bad after all about
this is a disgrace first of all his common law wife his girlfriend who may
be food was his common law wife they're not even married they got the two
kids back to him and Cuba but not being married maybe that explains why the
two of them are back there maybe that's part of the reason and the eight people
who came up on shore and the Bahamas from Cuba they they were ready to turn
them around and send them back to deport them like they do all the so-called
illegal aliens but guess what then they find out the last minute that one of
them is a real hot shot picture who happens to be leave on Hernandez's brother
ill-doca ill-dochback now all of a sudden the story changes then he can
form them that one of the other five guys in this of the of the five that they
want to get visas for and master cards this guy's an outfielder who can really
hit that ball so now the U.S. consulate gets involved in their intervening and
yes we're gonna do this and we're gonna do that and we're gonna give you
the visas and uh... he's gonna stay over there in the Bahamas as long as he
wants of course he said it's not the money and his answer that he hasn't set a
dime to leave on hasn't sent him a dime to his family or him or anybody else
or had much contact so the whole thing really stinks and reeks but nobody seems
to care about that because it's just like the thing with uh... with this clown
with Lawrence Phillips on the dolphins nobody says anything about that either
because as long as you may be able to win us a game we don't care how much of
a criminal you are we don't care if you came in illegally we don't care about
nothing this would really bugs me about what the so-called sports fans is they
don't that there is no scruples whatsoever forget about it and these people are
more important than anybody else and of course the other six people or five
people are going to want to go and back to Cuban being persecuted over
there and maybe sitting in jails and cast rose jails for years and years
nobody gives a fly and crap about them because they can't throw a goddamn ball
well i'll teach him
maybe they learned to play a little ball they might have a hell of china
and chance or cuban's chance or something like that
now those Haitians instead of so on up the baseballs that they start learning
to hit and pitch him that we might let a few more them in here no matter how
they're complex that they might be anybody can so a baseball but hitting them
and catching them that's a little bit tougher let's try mimie spring so
yeah hello nil yes sir yet nil you can be so wrong with the question of leave on
her name that goes directly against what you stand for the fact is you know
that money will make sure thing go i wasn't talking about leave on her name
as we're talking about his brother ill do get right right right when you know
i'm sorry i made a mistake with the name uh-huh but first mistake no i apologize
but um you know the thing is is that you're the first one that says you know
where's the money what what you know what's the real reason behind it i'm the
bad one wait what do you mean the first one that says where is the money no no
i've been screaming for years about overpaid jox illiterate assholes that the
public admire jox entertainers celebrities all this a hero worship of of
morons i've been saying that for years please don't try to you know tell me
what my agenda is because you don't know what you're talking about all right not
what i say well don't you think that everybody deserves to make as much as
they can what does that have to do with an illegal alien well there are too
long there are too long there's one who can pitch and play outfield and when
the one for people who don't have any athletic talent all he has to do only
has to do basically yes yes i think that that and so i'm wrong you can don't
that i don't think that's right i don't think it's right that these other
first lepers who are on that boat who are going to be deported back to cuban
wind up being thrown in jail you think that's okay because this asshole is a
picture with his wife and his two little kids that he left back in cuba with
his common law wife you think that's something we should admire and then he
should go out and test the friend of market and see how many millions of dollars
we have a pamphlets you can throw a baseball because if you believe that sir
you've got a mental problem no no what what do you believe you said that i was
wrong what do i believe what i believe it's morally wrong but the fact is
that the laws are set up in a way in which the guy who can pitch the guy who
could who could have run certain had a lot of time and had nothing to do with the
law the law doesn't say anywhere that we make exceptions i mean can you
imagine the congress passing a law that says well this is our immigration policy
all you will legal aliens who don't come in properly we're going to send you back
but if you can pitch a baseball or throw football then we'll let you come in
that's not what the law there is a lot that was not like congress saying what
that he'll do it could come in the country what the law said was any
foreigner that's willing to invest a million dollars in the United States
automatically get to visa and that is a law passed by congress about four years ago
and he'll do it is putting a million bucks on all he has to do is find the contract
and he got to put a supermarket down anywhere in town for a million dollars
and he he fulfilled the requirement of the law put a supermarket down whatever any kind of
business all he has to invest a million dollars he doesn't have a million dollars he doesn't
have a million cents he doesn't have a pop the pissing what are you talking tomorrow he could
have a contract signed tomorrow he could but you know what he doesn't and the fact is that when he
washed up on the behammy insurers with those other seven people he was just another illegal
alien in the eyes of our laws okay sir and you're trying to rationalize it and now you're going
here's the money and he's going to be a picture you make me want to puke okay get out of here
get out of here you make me sick people like you assholes like you yeah show me the money yeah
I'm making more money here than I was in the other joint but you know something I'm not making
all that much more maybe down the road if I survive here the last fourth and fifth year of this
deal maybe I will I'm not I'm not the you know I'm not it's just unconscionable to me that because
somebody is a jock and it's just like I was listening to some of the clips they were playing
on the morning show this morning at the end there's some of the a basketball players
yeah he gets in my he and he gets in my he and you know and you know and you're glamour
that that's why bring up this topic of illiteracy man it's it makes me sick to my stomach I cannot
admire people I don't care how good of an athlete they are I can't admire people who are a bunch
of illiterate scumbags okay I don't admire those people makes me sick to my stomach makes me want
a puke oh do you do you shoot that ball yeah big stinking deal god makes me just want to vomit
the the values they attitude I mean you talk about more that that's America for you man I've
been telling you that for years the premium is on stupidity Arnold Schwarzenegger uh sliced
the loan the drummer they are the more fans they got here shit don't it's not show me the money
it's show me the stupidity you know once upon a I mean can you imagine if Woodrow Wilson we're
running for president now this guy's alive now and he runs for president the next election you
think Woodrow Wilson have a chance of getting elected just like Adelaide Stevenson at a great
chance right because the guy with I mean this was the early age of television that we had a
warrior oh coming I forget about intellectuals forget about people with a brain there's no premium
on smarts in this country the values are all screwed up baby they're all screwed up just like this
crap that's gonna go on now with Sonny Bono because he was a marginal I mean mediocre entertainer
and a very very how did this guy only got into politics because he was an entertainer which of course
is very big in California George Murphy Ronald Reagan Sonny Bono it never ends out there there's a
like I said all your kids out there drop out of high school right now forget about being
literate and articulate drop out of high school right now and you can get killed in the skiing accident
too all right even the Jews are skiing now close to show you man the glamolid you down the garden
path every time and it's the same thing does that that old fart on the get rid of him okay I'm
not gonna talk to that old fart who said crap on the air go take one pack get out here go back
to Rochester go back to a rendez-quad you idiot god he wants to know why we cut him off and
how come they treat him like crap down here well maybe if you listen to that conversation if
you're a certain your party mouth you disgusting filthy mouth gold fag get out of here like that
you can hear me I want it to people I'm done can't hear it I like it here's Miami hello
you know yes sir hey how you doing great listen I called about Belduce I don't know if you were
around during the series I know you were in an outdoor I was here I was you saw the hype that
they played they needed a leave on mother to get a special visa come to the country a special
protection right right right right right she must have brought back some information just when
they showed uh do you say it's face on TV you know what you can do if you just get over there on a
boat yeah right there was a girl I don't know if you checked it out for like three years she was
real sick she's from Cuba but her father was over there she had kidney failure for three years
they were trying to get her father over to donate a kidney for three years she had to lose her
right but yeah for the for the Hernandez and El Bay's ball and the fact that there is anybody who
can don this they're oh yeah this is great when you drop that out the barlands can sign them up
uh these these people seriously they're taking up they're taking up space on the face of this
planet they should be sent put in a rocket ship and set off to your rain is I hear you all right
now have a great day I mean you talk about a mentality and I know I've been screaming about it
for and I'm not gonna stop because nobody else talks about this it's unacceptable man it's
unfriken acceptable I don't give a crap if he throws the ball 120 goddamn miles an hour okay now
if he can play hockey that's another story then we'll sign them up and the problem is those
spicks they don't have no hockey players that's the problem we got all these and the Haitians no
Haitian hockey players thank god like I told you we got no dark even that sport already don't
start you know with the only thing we have left it's the only thing we've got left is hockey
even sports illustrated here several weeks ago they had a front page story whatever happened to
the white athlete which I was kind of shocked that sports illustrated a kind of snooty a
publication like that would have the hootspot and the balls to come up with it and it's true I
mean basketball is strictly a black man sport they're like a few token whites left in there
because there aren't too many white guys were seven feet tall in the first place football
baseball see that Jackie Robinson they let a couple guys in there I mean he never stole a freight
chain then all of a sudden you got Larry Dobie and then it's like uh where they all coming from
so hockey and then of course there was always golf there was golf which to me is boring I mean
I can't begin to tell you if you admit to watching golf on television you should also be put on
the same rocket ship with people that think that El Ducey should be here pitching the baseball
but golf was a white man sport they had one or two along the way to make it look good then this
tiger woods comes in I am so sick and tired of hearing about tiger woods is he uh is he uh
tie is he black is he this does he tie one on is he a faggot what is his story which a lot of people
believe by the way but at least leave us our hockey okay we got that Greer kid on Edmonton we got
Grant Führer we got famous Amos there on the caps on the Bruins now we got like maybe a half a
dozen that's plenty that's a nice tokenism there okay and then we got that Donald Brashear who's
nothing but a ghoul over there in Vancouver that's plenty that's enough for right now and then
of course we keep in this guy calling up calm Brian Murray oh we're gonna bring Kevin we expect
we don't need any black gold tenders okay we had polky reddit leave these guys alone okay nice
white sport what's wrong with that can't there be a white sport how about tennis since Arthur Ash
croaked I mean are there any black tennis players of note that we uh I mean you're a big tennis fan
here's some there's more there's definitely there's definitely more fag tennis players than
there are blacks unless the Martinez are retiring again yeah but let me say something for let me
say something here South Miami hello yes sir yes sir when is this great uh I was uh
I wanted to say something about uh when are they gonna do something about this guy's that
are driving out there without intense weather insurance on those old rags you know that what maybe
two hundred dollars you know I mean it it would take a chip but a chip in a in a uniform with a
badge and a hidden catch him I saw one of the other it was a chip with the uniform here's a matter
of fact right on the corner up here I mean you know and uh what at the point that I want to get
a close is that that cops are not exempt there was one this morning that got uh got hit that are
like there as it was uh going on a call or something and yeah four guys in a car and then they took
off you know people said why did they run away I mean they didn't have a dime for some insurance
on that wreck yeah and uh I got a Florida pal we can't we can't get our act together in Florida
which is a posthumane for everybody telling everybody it's safe and it's wonderful here we're too busy
worrying about things like that yeah if the cops are gonna build a new stadium for uh for Wayne
Heisenberg if they wanted to do something about their colleague uh or any more of their colleagues
are getting hurt or people out there they could take maybe a half an hour of the
the blue hours they spent on the coffee shop hitting on the waitresses and well they're in
the try to spot this car and everything stop them well how insurance just start away traffic
enforcement in this state is a joke anyway you know this we were talking about this a couple of
days ago that people now make left turns on on green arrows and then the light changes to red and
four five six more cars go this is a new set in top floor that's just started last year or two
and it's getting worse and worse I have never in my life seen a cop pull somebody over because
they ran a red light at a in the left turn I've never ever seen it happen and you see all these
people making these cop is never around when people are doing all these irrational things we got no
real inspection system in this state we got 85 year old people getting six year renewal licenses
in the mail people that can't see people that can't hear people that can't walk people that are like
mentally in la la land getting licenses in the mail renewal for six years who are 90 years old
and in the meantime they're sitting on hi this road up there by me under the tree with their
radar guns out just like they were on honeyhill road this morning I'm coming to work and they're
sitting there with their radar guns right under the above and there by the stadium right under the
bridge they're more concerned about sitting there with a radar gun all day they don't
they don't want to pull out that's not that's not the individual a porker out there those who that
that's that's the mentality of law enforcement in this state that's the powers that be is writing
what what gets me that this guy that don't have any insurance and they have those old
dilapidated old heat you know yeah they are the one the worst of funds is your God forbid we
should have a real inspection system in the state of Florida palace a little inconvenience so if
you got ball tires and no breaks war power to you welcome to Florida I tell you I was driving
south from from my name is lakes and it was the road was rainy was wet and there was this guy
he if there was I mean he was there okay getting it's one thing but this guy if there was a fly
between my bumper and his it would have got squashed and he was the hunk in the horn and you know
blow and and the him in the lights and everything and I went up to 65 and I said let me get this guy
out of my throat but then he got a punch so very careful I just moved up to the right and the guy
writes by I mean he punched it and and they was doing like like like you know the middle finger
and all that stuff nice that Jesus Christ they they don't like coming out to serve this is the
land of house brutality have a great day thank you good luck here oh god I mean that's that's
one thing that is never going to change it just keeps getting worse and worse because it's a
real Yahoo mentality law enforcement down here and traffic enforcement you can't complain about it
because there is many it's just it's a joke you get to a corner the light the green arrow comes on
and couple of cars go and then it turns yellow and a couple of more cars go and now it's turned red
now you're ready to come the other way because your light is green well wrong wrong because guess what
here comes another one making the turn here's another one behind that asshole making another turn
here's at least three four five I have counted six people because wow you know some of these
lights are pretty long 80% of all accidents happen at intersections and I'm going to I'm going to
tell you another one and they just change the light by the way at knob hill and sunrise up in
plantation by me and at first I thought it was a little bit inconvenient because there's more of a
lag between the green lights depending on whether you're going north or south it's a blessing
because I'm going to tell you if you want to get killed if you definitely have a a feeling of
suicide in your bone all you have to do is just go to the corner of hiatus that I say knob hill
on it's hiatus and sunrise and sit there at that light up until they change it and then when the
light turns green just go ahead forget it because the traffic on sunrise is going 80 miles an hour
and they run that light like four seconds after it turns red I've driven all over this country I
have never ever seen what passes is driving the cosine down here any place else remember I got
nailed at time by the station guy running a red light over on one of the 10th avenue whatever
that was by the old iod and it's a damn good thing I had a fast Corvette because I wouldn't be sitting
here today I'll tell you that because I saw him out of the corner of my and I floored it and all
you do was catch the real tail ass end of that car and this guy just zoom I'm talking about
seconds after his light had turned red in a pickup truck let's optional now picking up the kill
you very easily thank you you don't have to stop it's just a suggestion yeah and yeah exactly if
the light turns red if you feel like it you might want to stop if you're in a big hurry give it a
shot just go ahead that's the new traffic deal of Florida because you don't like to be too picky we
don't want to be one of those fascist states here's a mobile in pariah and hello mobile in pariah and

the daily countdown to go right I said let me listen to you know you never really introduce

I didn't know the beginning is me I said have a great day pal okay sure okay we don't have
time for me to tell the whole life story but at least he's enjoying the show he found he's
a little depressed about it obviously here's Ponty chill out how are you doing now you're great all
right yeah I just want to say you know big class started listening to you show because you come
on after a first team and just before hate comes on right you know you sell a lot of things that are
like kind of a controversy also you know when I'm listening I like to call into you know challenge
some of the things to say just to make sure they don't go on challenge right in the process
of listening to them kind of I'm still wandering and waiting like when are you actually going to
interviews we don't do interviews you know you're almost never have guessed this this is my show
what do you bring something at the table what I bring to the table is the the Elijah show we give
people a few labs a little bit of provocation but I mean why do I want to be the same as everybody
else's damn show why would I want to do that well actually taking from a different perspective you
wouldn't necessarily have sports guests you know but see now here's another you're a new listener
right and already this is the fifth or six day I'm on this station and here's another guy that's
programming the show for me you know that programming you are I don't want what what guests will
you like me to have on I used to have guests on I used to do topics for years in this town and was
number one in doing that and you know something it was as boring as smelling paint it was it was
worse than that well I'm not boring as eating vanilla ice cream I'm not saying you have to have
national what would you like to hear I'm not saying you have to have national you know but yeah well
I make it even worse because in this town if you think there's interesting people interviewing
this town give me a hundred names immediately come on let's hear them that's sure you got it
this is not a sports show you got way high zinger oh this is not a sport I'm not going to get on
where you come on this show why you never know there is and I wouldn't have him on this show I'm
not going to come on here and lick his butt why don't you why don't you interview the guy that
holds out his radio stations around here and and find out why this but you know that he brought you
over to the station in the first place you wouldn't want to hear him well you could never get him you
could never get him the show up anyway if we called him right now he'd never return the call
well I don't know you know the one call it in the casino let me ask you something has the guy
that owns this station or is the manager does he ever show no okay the shula have a radio show
shula have a shula you used to have one no no no no that was just for the football team but does
he have a radio show radio show no okay does Wayne high zinger have a radio show no one you want to
know why why don't you consider that entertaining they're boring they're boring people I'm not saying
they have to be on the show every day that the last they're never going to be on the show you
you could take listen if you want to make some serious money you can take it to the bank right
now those people that you just mentioned will never ever be on the show let me just say this the
call of the call before any was kind of I don't know and some here or something but he brought up a
good point I have been listening to you but you never really made it clear to your audience in
terms of what your format what well of course if you listen to the show you find out it's just a free
wheeling we just we just do it it's it's what it is it's not a format okay I will be one of these
callers that would definitely keep you keep you keep you on my toes excellent excellent I don't
like ask kisses I like people like you that want to keep me on my toenails okay thank all right
we knew I can't if there's one thing that I have no respect for it's ask kisses I have friends of
mine I don't want to mention anybody's name on here I have friends of mine who are very good friends
but they tend to be aslakers they start well I don't want to mention remember by name he's out of
town it can't defend himself he tends to be because he's you know he he works for the organis
organization and every it's easy to kiss ass and it's also easy to knock somebody when they're not
around and then have them on a show for an interview and kiss their ass when they're right in front of
you anybody can do that now well what is that that can't be heard are you serious that's the real one
here's that bitch in gamesville hello hello yes ma'am this is a long distance so you better make it
worth my while I better make it worth your while that's right that's right yeah closet
listener is what we heard from daddy yesterday he said you're a real pain in the ass and you go to
he said when you're a gator when he told me that I knew you had an excuse no I'm a gator but I'm
a cane also so you know double-birled yeah you got real problems so I don't got no problems so
we take off everything we said you do yes but it doesn't bother me yeah exactly one more time so
you're up there today and you're really missing being down here here in the show right yeah but I
know something you miss some good hemorrhid talk today too by the way hemorrhids and foot fetishes
you missed all the good stuff isn't there anything nice you could talk about no hockey no we're not
talking about no hockey okay we're talking about really my handling stuff like hemorrhids like big
like big ripping oozing hemorrhid yeah and how about you I could take a check to the bank I do
every couple of weeks a big one well where's mine yeah I don't know where yours is in fact I would
look deep inside your back though you might find it have an ice life sweetheart okay thanks for
calling why just like I said just like this asshole we'll call him in a go about how do I sleep and
take a big check and the boring is hell which he should live so long and then the guy that called
earlier on the morning show about you know what else can he listen to between ten and two and then
heard that call when she was down here a few days ago complaining in belly it could about how gross
and hemorrhids and so on they can't turn it off for lover money and I know that I know that so if
you think that you're fooling me I've been doing this too long you can't con a con artist and if it
makes you feel better that you protest like oh this is garbage and you would listen to how could
you be calling me if you weren't listening to it why would anybody I've asked this many many times
I'll ask it one more time why would anybody in their right mind anybody would even the most
minute semblance of a life call any radio show and express their dislike for it instead of just
reaching over and selecting any of the other six million choices that they might have or going
and playing my junk or playing with themselves or doing whatever they wanted to do I mean we're
talking about people with very very very serious life deficiencies people who are life challenged
here's North Miami hello hi Neil welcome back in the air thank you sir I I agree that clear
challenge communications puts back some of the shame yeah now I could you please could you play
that phone call from Phil Henry you had last last year about what about him being in Los Angeles oh
yeah okay it's coming right up you know six years ago George we had a really great call from
Moishi Puppet can we get that on right away okay pal just hang in there sure that from the
social aspect oh oh the we miss Bill Henry man do we miss him we had a thing going on at station
all we need to was a real morning show I'm sorry I mean I'm sorry suds all we need to
was a dynamic if we'd have had Bob and Tom in the morning on it can you imagine George listen
to me for one second it'd be a first if we would have had Bob and Tom in the morning who are now
becoming syndicated and Phil in the afternoon could you imagine we would have had double digit
shares even in fact boy would have been able to sell low shows but thank God we got this
sales department here well you were right about them you were right about these guys you know you
meet them in the beginning before I started here they all seem very nice and like very pleasant
people and very friendly and very happy to have me here and now we've only been here a week and
I'm realizing that this is like makes everything in the past pale and the wind significance I mean
clueless and shoeless they haven't got any concept of what copy is about of what any of it is about
much less selling any spot you wouldn't want to buy those spots would you and I didn't think so
have an ice day though oh my god they're gonna take us back in those days of yesterday year when
you know when QAM had those point two I mean we might have big numbers but we'd be selling it like
those days for Neil Rogers show sports radio live 60s QAM
so
it's an household celebration and they're all out on the street see them on the sidewalk
over here them shuffling feet 20,000 apples and an apple from the maze to keep aside good people
there's the half old great
We've got the asshole freedom, the asshole fun, asshole for Jesus, the asshole for guns,
asshole for justice, asshole for crimes, asshole for asshole, asshole for all crimes.
We've got assholes making money, we're making all the rules, making all our jobs and everything that's hard to do.
Half-hole's not on the water, half-hole's the sky, and he's not accepting help on it, and the asshole is even blind.
I'm not a real man to trade, my head's not black, my head's not black, my head's not just another asshole on the grave.
I'm not a real man to trade, my head's not black, my head's not black, my head's not black, my head's not black, my head's not black.
I told him to give me orders and I told him to throw the boat.
I told him to get elected because I told him to throw.
I once heard his gun and all that told him to have a die.
They just lay in bed in the morning light.
And so come morning, and so come day.
And so come day, and so come day, and so come day.
For me, thousand and so come day.
The fascist people in the household are crazy.
I should have been on much of beef this morning.
That would have been good.
Boy, do I have a few beef today, baby?
We don't want to get started on a negative note.
Oh, man, just in the last 24 hours, I got enough beef to fill up a goddamn encyclopedia.
By the way, Erica, you're another one of my beefs, the last color on the worst team this morning
with her beef being me, which is fine.
I mean, if you don't like the show, you got a lot of company.
There's plenty of people.
Don't like it.
Can't handle it.
Emotional cripples.
But guess what, sweetheart?
This is in the sports show.
It never was.
And it's never going to be.
And I told you that the very first self same day.
And guess what?
It's also not a sports station anymore.
They haven't figured that out yet.
And some of the promos and whatever.
But it's not a sports that all sports.
It's mostly sports as in 20 out of 24 hours, which is five,
six, which is a hell of a lot, 80 over 80%.
What is that?
83% something like that?
Who knows?
And more than enough, trust me when I tell you more than enough.
Believe me when I, especially in this market,
much more than enough.
So, Erica, I hate to break the news to you, sweetheart.
But before you start squeezing your philosophy back too tight,
don't get all bent out of shape because I didn't come here like
on a wing in a prayer begging on my knees for a job.
They hired me to come here and do the near-order show.
Absolutely not a sports show.
Because sports, I know this may come as a real shock to you, sweetheart.
But it only appeals like on a steady diet of it.
To a very narrow number of people out there.
To a narrow segment, especially in this town,
which is basically as far as sports and most other things
concerned for running phonies.
Erica, but have a nice life, sweetheart.
But at any rate, yeah, don't see.
I did hear early in Mandage.
In fact, we were still in here.
I was in this room.
And I heard another one of the emotional cripples.
You know, for all these macho, including the women out there,
these dikes who are big in the sports,
all these macho people that allegedly are listening to this station,
we got more emotional cripples.
It's terrifying to me.
First, it's the language.
Oh, it's so crudely so disgusting.
You know, they're offended.
They can't turn it off and they're still listening right now.
Every damn one of them, but they're offended.
That's number one.
And number two, this emotional cripple that caused yesterday.
And Mandage was going on about he's been out of town.
And who's Neil been ripping?
And what has he been saying?
And the guy calls and says, wow, you know,
he reprinses Diana.
I thought this guy was going to break into tears.
And Mandage said, well, I can easily understand that,
especially with the, you know,
they're selling tickets to go see her grave site and stuff.
And the guy says, yeah, but you did a lot for the poor.
I mean, doesn't, I know you don't want to think about this.
Folks, it is a downer.
I don't want to be a downer real early in the morning.
We try to have a few laughs here, but I do try to force some people
to take a look at reality.
It did not for too long because it's an ugly thing.
And then just let's go back and have a few or y'all.
Exactly.
But I mean, doesn't it terrify you that there are so many people
with that same idiotic mentality?
She did a lot for the poor mother Teresa,
for whom I had no love to say the very best,
but nevertheless, that wrinkled up old prune bitch,
nevertheless mother Teresa allegedly devoted her entire
adult life into helping the poor, the downtrodden,
the needy, the desperate, the disease, the what,
and mother Teresa died the same weekend as Diana.
A couple of days later, as a matter of fact,
all wrinkled up and shriveled up about three feet tall
over there in India with all the schleppers,
the schleppers and the lepers.
And how much time did she get?
Are they paying to go see mother Teresa's grave
if she's got one if they didn't just burn the thing
and put it in the throat and the sea somewhere?
Nobody gave a flying crap about mother Teresa
because she was a wrinkled up old bag.
Who wasn't a glamorous?
Huh?
She wasn't a snappy dresser.
And guess what?
She wasn't being followed by the paparazzi either.
She wasn't, you never saw mother Teresa
on the front of the tabloids.
The acquirer and the globe, the tatler and the star,
never had no big inside scoop on mother Teresa.
There were no naked pictures of mother Teresa
on a yacht somewhere,
sailing with some big Greek or Arab maggot,
as in the case of Aristotle O'Necess,
or this doobie doobie, whatever's name was,
I mean, get serious already.
Maybe that we're doing a few doobie doobies on the yacht.
Maybe that was the problem or not enough.
Is the case maybe, although he was into much more exotic things
that Arab bastard.
But at any rate, I mean, is it difficult for you to understand
that Diana, Princess of Nothing,
was basically nothing
and all of these wonderful charitable things that she did
were scheduled for her?
Do you think that Diana really had a great social conscience
about landbinds?
Do you think that she was really very concerned
about all the innocent kids and people
who are going to get killed by landbinds?
Because the world is a slaughterhouse?
She auctioned off her dresses.
Right.
She's just like that spit over there.
It's auctioning that's a sell-em-out
all the furniture from that houseboat.
Well, he's pocketing that then.
How do you know that?
You're right.
You're right, of course he is.
So what's wrong with that?
It's America. It's free enterprise.
It's just like Yildouchet.
By the way, great column.
And I never read the hero, but it happened to be sitting
outside, it came in here real early this morning.
Carl Heisen, for whom I have the lowest regard,
by the way, so overrated with all of his alligator stories,
but has a great column about the immigration priorities
are worked and right next to it was a big thing.
Red carpet for Duque, Duchet, a sore point.
So they're finally starting to get the message
that this whole thing, and it ties in with what I said
about this idolization of mediocre
and even people who aren't even mediocre,
people who are less than mediocre.
Who would you do to lead for the poor?
Okay.
So does that mean that they had a...
I can understand the British,
and I have no problem at all understanding
that they've always been very silly people,
and they continue to be the silliest people
who are desperately locked into this archaic monarchy crap.
They can't escape from it, they're in a trap.
No matter how much they would like to escape from it.
So she at least represented them
an almost human part of that monarchy.
She was almost somebody they could like,
oh, here's a real person.
But for the rest of the world,
including this idiot that called Mad Dog yesterday,
to get all the...
Oh, she did so much for the poor and he's ripin' her.
I wasn't ripin' around ripin' the people
that are gettin' all been out of shape like he was.
Who gives a flying crap about Diana?
Even Robert Duval,
a network wasn't in such a big hurry to talk to her.
I remember, so I'll get back to Diana.
He wasn't in no big hurry to talk to that bitch.
Why do you people gonna get with it?
Oh, but isn't it gonna be a sports show?
Can we hear a little more about the Yukon?
Yeah, I got some sports stuff to talk about.
It's called the Big Choke.
He was playing the lando, the pollo para acá.
He was playing the lando.
Yes, sir.
I was cooking my breakfast for a second.
Hey, um, we just see the big,
big, big, big, big, big...
No, I hear you didn't.
Hey, you know, let's print the Diana thing.
Yeah.
You know, people, they're so simplistic and...
It shouldn't even have a job.
Yeah.
What is she supposed to do?
Well, she never stole a freight train.
Yeah, I bet you she had somebody dish for her in the morning.
I mean, she didn't.
She also did a lot of puke in too,
which kept her busy throughout her trouble.
It's just unbelievable.
Mother Teresa, you know, you look at all the stuff
she's done through her whole life.
Well, supposedly.
But I mean, I just use that as an example
because she croaked the same weekend.
And, you know, they gave her 20 seconds.
Every couple of hours just as lip service.
Because nobody cared about that.
This business, oh, well, she did all these good things.
There are many thousands, maybe millions of people
around the world who do far better things
than Diana ever dreamed of doing.
And nobody ever hears of them.
And no matter how and when they die,
there won't be any parade.
There won't be any gigantic ceremony.
There won't be anything on CNN or MSNBC
or CNBC or any other guy at the end place of the BBC
because it's a pile of horse crap.
And for the American public or anybody else outside of England
to get all wrapped up in that and get all weepy and emotional,
there must be something wrong.
There is not must be.
There is something desperately wrong with the public.
I mean, talk about having too much idle time on your hands.
Well, you said it better than I could.
Have a great day.
See you later.
I agree.
How is it possible for there to be so many stupid people
in this world?
Wake up with the first key.
Your vote, Jeff DeFarris, is the goal see.
Weep the mornings and six.
Only on sports radio 560 QAM.
This is the new Roger show.
This is his brain.
Any questions?
Here's a western.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Great.
Those gypsies in Italy,
and they're the same ones that come over here
and steal our wallets in the mall.
No, they're different.
Different gypsies.
But they look...
I don't know.
Same family.
They're all related.
No, they are.
Yeah, I had one of them try to rent my house one.
He pulled up into Mercedes.
He was real smooth talking to like 12 people in the car.
He was just buying all my appliances.
I got a little nervous.
How did you see that?
The guy who shot that guy in the parking lot.
The guy who shot the guy in the parking lot.
The security guard who shot that guy over a parking space.
Oh, that happens here all the time.
That's all I'm crazy about.
Yeah.
Well, you know, on the news,
they were talking to all the people in that shopping center.
And they were all saying how this guy was a time bomb.
How he was a...
No, this was going to happen.
They're happy he's gone.
The next day in the herald,
they were talking about this guy like he got the most Christmas gift.
He was beloved.
There were two different stories with the same thing.
Right.
Well, it's just like this Eldouché story.
Within the same newspapers,
there are read all these glowing stories about how wonderful this is.
And this liberation of this wonderful guy who's been screwed over over there
because his brother implicated a minister thing about the flee in the country.
And Yadiyade and got kicked off on national team.
And now he's going to come here and live the American dream and make all this money.
And then the same paper, if you turn later on,
you'll read the real story about how what a ripoff it is
and about how all these other people.
Carl Heissens got a story in a column today
and toward the end, he talks about a woman in Cuba that he had met.
And she's a doctor.
And she specialized in caring for children and the elderly.
And she was given by the Cuban government of salary equivalent
to about $5 a month, $5 a month.
And he makes the point that she,
under no circumstances,
would ever be allowed to be come into this country, never be granted a visa.
And if she had been one of those eight people who washed up into Bahamas,
they would send a rascback there and she might have gone to go cash to her jails.
Yeah.
So these people, it's this idol,
and it's so frustrating to me because most of these jocs are morons.
They're scumbags.
They're crap.
They're crap.
They're garbage.
Yeah, white feeders and drug addicts and garbage.
And yet these people with this joc mentality, like Tyson
and like Michael Irving and all these other,
it makes no difference what they do.
The joc mentality people, they still admire them and they subsidize them
and they pay to support them.
There's something wrong here, man.
Yeah.
Something very, very wrong.
In fact, they left one guy behind there that I saw in the news
and he was even speaking English.
He should get in.
There you go.
Can I call my wife a douchebag or a bag?
Well, he's telling you're a home and garden network love and douchebag.
A homo douchebag.
Okay, I have a racetail.
I'll be with her.
I'll be with her.
Let's go to a key West.
Hello.
Yes, Neil.
Yes.
I'm one of your biggest fans.
But why aren't you ripping the assholes on your station?
I'm a Phil Henry was much too kind to the X-Jocks.
And Jim Mandage has lost his sense of humor.
Jim Mandage is great.
Jim Mandage is God.
No, no, he lost his sense of humor.
Jim Mandage is great.
Yeah, but he lost his sense of humor
and he's become a surly, surby and ethnic cleanser.
I think that you should rip all these guys.
So, sir, you're another one that's going to call and tell me what I should be saying.
Is that it?
No, no.
That's what you're doing now.
You should rip Mandage and you should rip off.
I'm going to tell you in my opinion is I think Mandage is great.
You'll find out for yourself.
Okay.
I'll find what out?
Well, you'll find out that Jim Mandage has lost his sense of humor.
Okay, he's become an average ass.
You've turned in child.
Wait, don't call him.
Check that.
You've turned.
That's not me.
That's Mandage.
You've turned.
You've checked ass.
Get out of here.
You've seen I, old fart.
I tell you, I'm not going to talk to these old guys.
They all got hearing aids.
Get out of here already.
Will you?
Man, oh man, go back to New York.
I'm telling you, the worst drugs,
why did they keep giving them mayor credit?
You know, Julianne.
Got nothing to do with Julianne.
They got all the drugs out in New York and they sent him here.
That's why the city's a lot better shaped
now than it used to be.
They got all the swill out of there and they sent it down here,
like this guy.
Go back to the Bronx.
Okay, maybe Mickey Maddle will come back from the dead
and hit a home run over your head.
Get out of here, pal.
Get lost.
Maybe Lou Gehrig will come back for one more big one.
For one more consecutive game.
For one more being the luckiest man under the earth.
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Yeah, yes, sir.
Thanks for telling the truth about Sunny Bono.
I've been sick to death in all this adulation.
He's the first class jerk.
His only ex-wife here.
Right.
He hates him so much.
He won't even mention his name.
Right.
I mean, you know, somebody dies.
It's always unfortunate, especially if it's
a celebrity of any kind.
I mean, he'd get a little more attention.
But to carry on and you will
agitate this guy like this guy was,
oh, he was such a great member of Congress.
And he was such a great human being.
And of course, such a great pioneer in television
and a great singer.
This guy was mediocre at best.
Well, we ran from there upon spring.
He's the one that led the way on cleaning up
the spring break stuff.
They copied it in four-lotter day after him.
You know, there were a lot of people out of there, right?
There was one great scene I watched on TV
in Southern California where they were actually
loading women who were wearing phones.
Because he told the cops to arrest any women in phones
out on Palm Canyon Drive and Palm Springs during spring break.
Yeah, eight off would have been proud.
They were loading them into Patty wagons.
And of course, the guys who are already outnumbered,
the spring break partyers who already outnumbered
the women three to one.
They were angry because more of their women were
getting taken away.
And they were going to have to end up getting drunk
and doing it with their buddies that night.
But there's actual police barricades
along there.
There's a riot situation just about to happen.
And Patty shows up like Marshall Dillon.
And he's knows-to-nose with this angry guy
across the police line right on live TV.
And he says, we don't want your kind around here.
Don't you get the message?
And the guy responds, I own this damn hotel.
And it's your cops who are causing the trouble.
Beautiful.
And I mean, this is just a picture
of the angry snarling, right wing Republican crap.
Well, I think it's just the study line up
with a bull-backed daughter, don't you?
Yeah, you know, she's a really good spokesperson.
Right.
She is the front person now for the media group
that counters stereotypes in the media
and when she comes out and makes a statement.
She used to be the rear person
that now she's the front person, right?
What's ironic about that is-
Hashtagity.
She was that little girl that grew up on TV
in front of all of it.
That's right.
And I mean, now she is the spokesperson
just bringing home the fact that
a people are America's sons and daughters.
And wild and crazy talk show hosts too.
There you go.
That's all right.
That's a great day, pal.
Thanks a lot, bud.
Yeah, there's a lot of us bags out there.
No, not Troy Eggman.
Oh, no, not Steve Young.
Not Tony Zona.
And he's daughters.
Well, the Rock and Roll, two Congress.
Two pigs and red randies.
We're not to be out on time to get a taste.
You decided to come out and see.
You had a group yesterday.
Until a tree God is your way.
You!
The crows have failed.
We're not here to see that.
But I've seen things still in there.
and
at least you got the kennedy's out of our hair against god almighty that probably
nobody else watches msnbc so whenever i bring that up and john gibson and all
those but
john gets it at least is okay
they got some other people on that the network who are so marginal that they're
embarrassing at best and they do these real real soft amoric interviews
but it's the kennedy's in john vanay and the kennedy's similar and uh... maybe
built caused the for well that's over now and just they just take things in a
hammer and hammer and even had the hammer never hammered him so much god are
they bet on notice the incredible response on that the anabin this uh... there
is no response
which means that either everybody agrees with what i said and you know that ninety
nine percent of the people are listening right now and everybody else beside
got wrapped up in that thing and was just that the tears were flowing and the
really believe that this was one of the major events of our time which it was
not but there is anybody out there who's got the cahons to want to discuss it
debated disagree because uh... you know it's much easier to call up mad dog mad
it's a well sticking on poor Diana and she helped the poor yeah okay here's
a pop and oh hello it case by by sign yes sir i welcome you back to reason i was
calling uh... i'll pop with you about that and i uh... i thought that uh... she
was deserving of everything uh... the funeral on that type of stuff i can
understand your point of view but at the same time uh... she was deserving of
it based on what i think the british people are people around world south
story for that they thought that she was uh... it was a fairytale marriage is
everybody thought it was going to be and then it just wound up that uh... the
british hierarchy that excited to freeze her out she didn't sit in and
trial she didn't have a lot of people felt sorry for and as she was so young
and she was going to change the british monarchy and things like that and
you know anytime somebody on thirty thousand how we can change the british
monarchy she was no longer even a part of the they stripped her of her well
behind the right she wasn't a part of the world family and more how she
can change the model while she was in the eighties in the early nineties while
she was still married or they were still together they thought that there was
hope that they're gonna bring the british monarchy to the modern era i mean i'm
thirty seven myself but the plan trying to make you is the british monarchy is
such an anachronism that it's embarrassing right and like i said before the
british i can understand and wailing and carrying on getting all that
out of shape because there are a bunch of very silly people anyway who have no
concept of what the real world is all about until germany starts dropping bombs
and then they come running for us to bail them out but other than that why would
the rest of the world care she was not an important person outside of
england
uh... the outside of the great british
listen what jackie kennedy died who was the wife of a present okay who was
married to a rich or oil maggot
ok on axis
it was there any any kind of i mean it was on the news for like thirty seconds
did anybody said any tears that anybody carry on today my good man not that i'm
saying she deserved it
but the point is she was american okay but what you was part of american
history nobody carried on when she croaked okay but let me point this out about
jackie on that this is i was way too young to remember this but when she went
to friends if i'm not mistaken from what i've seen of the uh... biography shows
on any or whatever she went to france in nineteen sixty two or whatever with the
president the french just all over the yet i know how much you love the french
but the thing was that she was a very charming woman she was an elegant looking
girl and people were taken by that and that's what happened with that
that's my that's my point so she just got through dying she was not at all i
mean she wasn't a little back she got a cancer whatever was uh... jackie
kennedy
it was there was no anything here and i'm going to tell you you are not old enough
but when when president kennedy died
when he was assassinated
the the ceremony and the things that took place in this country
pale into insignificant it wasn't even close
to what went on with this dianna business and it's still going on with selling
these dolls and pictures and uh... selling tickets to see her where she's buried
right this is this is mass madness is how i feel would say this is insanity
i but in the only reason that people got caught up in it because the media
uh... the media was there to spin it
convinced them that this is a major event all over the world
you get away from it
when i you mentioned how it would be a what did how it would have he had a
four television network
nineteen sixty two sixty three when kennedy died
there were three major american network there was no global communications or
whatever
dianna i mean she traveled all over all but it it just
that's how communication is a big difference between ninety seven sixty three
i realized that i mean i'm not taking her side i'm not taking your side but
you know the thing is that it's the way the world is nowadays what i'm
maybe really believe what you just said but let me tell you that when uh... when
lehar viazwell was shot and killed by jack ruby i saw it live on a sunday on
nbc television
so if you think that the cameras were all there and that the three major networks
weren't there forget about the rest of the world in this country they all had
the technical ability to be there and and carry on about it as much as they wanted
to but it was nothing like that and i'm going to tell you one of the reasons why
because back in the sixties this whole celebrity business was nowhere like it is
today we didn't have inside addition we didn't have the all these tabloid
newspapers we had nothing that compares to this obsession the sickness in the
world today and especially in this country with these celebrities and with
athletes it's a madness right well the thing was in the sixties when the
Beatles came about they were the first international
liberties whether it was athletics or entertainment or they were the first
international celebrities in that open the door you absolutely right and we're
talking about them and the people who are the people's were popular with a
bunch of screaming little teenage girls the Beatles weren't the how about
john lennon got killed okay that that that the me john lennon was the defining
moment of my generation all right but when he got shot and killed in the
york did they carry on for weeks and did we have a big state funeral and did
they i don't think so no no but then again Diana even when fricking elvis
croaked on the toilet okay right even though we got all the silly women still
running to grace land even when the king croaked there wasn't that simmiss
going on like that but then again lennon was not in any way she had performed
part of government not the Diana was but she was recognized as the princess
person i'm not trying to have nothing to do with government had to do with
her celebrity status and the only thing it had to do with you're right about that
and and in court with that you should croak tomorrow which might not be a
bad idea if you croak tomorrow i can assure you that there will be no outpouring
of emotion carrying on in britain or elsewhere and she was the leader of
government right i understand that and in closing yes sir it just
astounds me that msnbc which is not i i watch it maybe for the big show
half an hour how they can put i'm a sign in the morning absolutely astounds
me that they have like watching the dead man try to uh... you know uh...
continue doing his career think by now he would have made enough money to go
often the
well all get another heart transplant or something in the rest of his life but
this guy it it's very sad to me because i was a huge i miss and he was a very
funny guy right up until he took his absence in the seventies and he came back
and went down hill from there i mean i remember what's in the ira 70s but
ndc itself
i mean you see it a big line mbc on every night and they have an msnbc time
together they were on the
one
and they know they got basically they got three they've got some other spin-offs
to but they got cnbc they got msnbc in the regular mcc so they got all this time
they could be the courty v they have all they have that to have yeah because they
have their
i think i'd maybe my g e stock of go up
oh god and that's all they do it's like what we do about jambanay ranger what
we do about over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
i thank you bye yeah msnbc could be very enjoyable and could be really great but it's not
m
nobody is gone
and share with us
the skis kept going back to all the time
for you a chick came through that to a song
i guess i lost control and smashed my head
you cracked your head wide open now your dead
self-honoured gulps and share lips on
a tree got in your way and smashed your brain
so i like the skis what a stupid way to die
now honey's gone and share lips on now honey's gone
yeah share lips on
