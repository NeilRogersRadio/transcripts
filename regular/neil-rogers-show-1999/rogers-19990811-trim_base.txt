560 W2AM Miami-Bort Lauderdale presents the Neil Rogers Show.
We talked to Neil called 560 W2AM,
he's being told free for date and rarer,
he's known 560 on your cell phone.
The opinions of Neil and his guests,
are anyone else on the show
that does not necessarily reflect those
of the GQAM,
because he made acquisition for the
easily-used guest hotel.
Now, Neil Rogers,
on Sports Radio 560 QAL,
the following will be the case,
I'm ex-reduced, I'm the international
legal procedure.
Let's face,
most of us will never be rich.
Hell, we probably won't even be successful,
and that's pretty damn depressing.
But, as usual, with every problem,
there is a solution.
Hi, I'm Jim, and I'm here to tell you
a little something about hand guns.
They scare the s**t out of people,
intimidate them and they're giving you
whatever you want.
That's right, hand guns.
Think about it.
Need some cash?
Probably bank.
Don't have enough money for beer?
Call it the convenience.
Take chips and pretzels while you're at it.
It's all free if you've got a hand gun.
Some son of a bitch cheating on your girlfriend?
Kill him.
The simple solution to life's complex prowls.
All I have to do is wait the five days for it,
and happiness is just around the corner.
Hell, if you don't want to wait the five days,
who cares?
Find a dancing off the street.
Just buy a lot of hand guns.
It's a great alternative.
The working problem's out.
If you'd be considered a population control.
Oh, right.
Yes, hand guns.
They just might make it famous.
The kids are learning to play now.
In every big city of God,
you let the pain now.
Call, teach yourself some hardware and go to the other fellow away now.
It's all back, gun, gun, gun.
I've learned how to play today.
I've got to stay on the street today.
Got a new PC started and to show in town now.
I'm not showing that.
I can tell you guys it's lunch and I'm pretty special to sell now.
I'm not such a dissent.
They can share a picture and show them up before they sell now.
I'm not with bother.
They've got guns, guns, guns.
I've got to stay on the street today.
I'm not showing that.
I'm not showing that.
I'm boys and girls.
You can make like three for eight.
See the proceed on your blocks.
Up to the cops.
Don't get away.
Oh, hey, hey.
So what if Johnny can't treat you?
He can still turn me in.
I'll make that up.
He can't be out.
It's all back.
Gun, gun, gun, gun.
Take it all.
Go each other.
The way we're hitting.
Gun, gun.
Stay, yeah.

As we continue having another great story to keep you captivated every week
Everybody that goes by we get another mass shooting because
That's the American way
That's right
By the way, a little update
Miami-Dade boy playing with gun shoot
Self and dies
Now this is an old story
This is from yesterday morning
Tuesday morning's fatal
I mean old relatively
Compared to last night
Tuesday morning's fatal shooting of a
14 year old boy in Southwest Miami-Dade County
Was another example of why kids and guns
Don't mix
Miami-Dade police spokesman Pat Brickman said
Alexander Dureev was playing with his uncle
22 caliber rifle and took a fatal shot
In the face died of the scene authority said
See there's no longer any argument
I hate to break the news to all you crazy people
All you gun huggers
All you gun show people
As a matter of fact if this station had any balls at all
Which of course we don't
Because we're just a bunch of money grabbers like everybody else in broadcasting
If we had any kind of conscience
We'd stop running those gun show spots like now
Now would be a real good time for our sales manager
In general manager
And all these people around here say
You know something that's not really a good idea
To be putting that crap on here
Because they're selling oozees
And AK-47s and all kinds of crap at these gun shows
And people are running around crazy people with guns
Killing everybody else
Including now
Little kids
Let's not take on high school kids anymore
That's no fun
Let's shoot little kids
Five and six and eight year old kids
And all ladies two hour at it
You know Jews, Glam, Sparsers
Whoever they happen to be
Whoever were pissed off this week
This is crazy
You go anywhere in the world
Do you see this?
No
Any civilized country in the world
Nobody's got guns
But in America this is the whole way of life
Even why it would be embarrassed by this
In fact this week in the
Not in Newsweek or time
But in Businessweek magazine
The August 16th issue which I have my hand right now
What's the big, the main article in here
Under fire
Guns in America
Pages and pages and pages and pages
The crime world's weapons of choice
An angry public gun makers are feeling the heat
Finally a close up look at the secret of industry
And here's a big article about the rest of the world
Guns are wounding America's image abroad
I've got some big kind of a bullet in there
Like the rest of the world looks at this
Like a bunch of crazy people
Like a bunch of barbarians
Everybody running around with guns
Now you see they said back in little in Colorado
The gun nuts were saying
Well you see this is all a morgue and also in Atlanta
When the guy went nuts a couple of weeks ago
You see if everybody inside would have had if they had all the people in the office
Would have had a gun
Then they could have blown this guy away before he shot all these people
How about if all the five year old kids would have had a gun
There you go
If those little kids would have just been packing some heat
They could have blown this bastard away
Oh
I'm sitting there watching the latest spectacle again last night
Till about 1115 I'm watching on the satellite
KTK and DC out of Los Angeles
And you know they got this motel surrounded
And the guy supposedly inside they got the Toyota out
The car jack car sitting out there that Toyota
And they got it surrounded
He's on the first floor and here comes the swat team
I get up this morning because I wasn't going to stay up all night long waiting to see what developed
I get up this morning and I'm flipping around MSNBC
CNN all over the place
Local channels
And they got this rabbi on and this one on and they're all going
Oh you know like that
And the meantime where's the guy?
They got the guys picture on there
View for furrowed junior whatever the hell this guy who lives in a trailer park
In Olympia Washington
trailer park does that give you some clues right off the bat?
Do they find him?
No
No
Was he in the motel?
And see I don't even know whatever happened
And in between the swat team getting ready to go in there
And of course you notice they take a long time
He was supposedly in some room there on the first floor
And I'm KK and DC in Los Angeles to show the responsible media
Keep in mind is anybody ever been in a motel
Where they don't have a TV set inside
Not in my life
I've never been in a motel in my life
Where they don't have a TV inside
And they're saying well we're not going to give you the name of the motel
I think that the guy if he was inside
He knows the name of the motel the seven star motel he's in
He knows
But the fact is we're showing where the cops are
We're showing all this on live television
Here's the cops up on the roof
The swat team is getting ready to come in right now
Why didn't they just call the guy on the phone in his room and say
Okay here's the deal
This is the way we got to plan out
This is when we're going to come in to get you
So you got about ten minutes to get out the window or you know get out of here
Crazy
And so for whatever reason the guy seems to have slipped through their fingers again
And he's on the loose he made of amuse
Buford for all junior
Who decided it was a good day to shoot some Jews especially little kids
And by the way John Henry in case you're listening you know that $400 million that you want the taxpayers to give
I bet that would buy a lot of metal detectors for schools all over Broward County
And maybe a few left over for Dave County too
Forget about having you know better classrooms and better teachers and more textbooks
And having a real education system maybe even like you know how about some bulletproof vests
Maybe that'll be next you know they will talk about having the kids where uniforms to school
Address code yeah okay Johnny here's your bulletproof vest
And you're oozy
Yeah
This is the new deal in America go to the airport metal detectors go to school metal detector go to a federal building
Metal detector because we have this is a country of crazy people with guns
And you wonder how long is it going to be before somebody finally says you know this has got to stop
Just because somebody wants to go target shooting or because somebody likes to go hunting you know whatever a bandy or whatever they're into
You know that just doesn't outweigh the idea that most people would like to be safe
And when they send their kids off to school in the morning they like to seem alive sometime at night
I like this is difficult convincing the public that this is insanity that this is crazy
And by the way a Harris poll between June 10th and June 15th this is before the last three episodes here
Show 73% of Americans now favor tougher handgun controls handgun
Is there any American with a brain that wants people running around with automatic weapon?
No, only Charlton Heston and his people only crazy people like Charlton Heston use son of a bitch
Exactly
I don't have to grow up I'm a gunner of kids I can always feel myself or something bad
I did get gonna be cool when I kill everyone at school
My dad said it's okay I'll exercise my right that's why we have our A that lets me be a gunner
I can't believe it
He's a gunner us cute I call them how to shoot what he really loves the side of what?
No way that guy in the cute I'm a harmless side of all
Not to be red next to the side on the internet
Oh right
I'm a lifetime number of the NRA that's why I raise the guns the roads kids here son
Oh boy I quit for my gun
I'm glad that you're a gunner
I'm glad that you're a gunner
All right well let's see how many people we can kill before this day is that and in fact it's interesting
I would say in the last couple of weeks with these various you know these what do they call them?
Spree shootings is it a spree shooter or a serial shooter?
Remember that stuff on a Koonanikrapp was going on?
Yeah as if it makes a difference
But at any rate in a good week in this country we can kill more than like five other countries put together do in a year just with guns
So maybe somebody can fill me in on what happened between the time I went to bed last night and early this morning
When I got the guys picture now but there's not any conversation
I mean you turn on your news and instead of hearing 50 rabbis in a row going oh this is terrible
Which we already know that how about giving us some information as to what happened at that motel
Where the guy went did he get away with the inside something give us some news instead of giving us all these hysterical people
Telling us this wasn't such a great thing which I think most of us already know
Here's Helen Dale hello
You know what you're doing?
Okay sir
You know I just find it disgusting how the US government can't learn will not refuse to learn something from Europe and how
You just sit so safe out there no one has a gun you have nothing to worry about you can walk across the street there's none of these shootings
Freeze I don't understand what it's going to take to these politicians start whizing up and and take away guns all guns
Who cares about hunting and we need safety here these kids these poor kids got shot they got none of them died
But this is disgusting what's happening in this country
This is the only place I can think of that I've ever been in a world where you have to worry about somebody some maniac having a gun
It doesn't happen anywhere in any supposedly westernized country it doesn't happen really I mean once in a blue moon
Yeah I don't understand what it's going to take and I mean
Well these people were more concerned about important things like building stadiums and arenas that's the kind of stuff that America's obsessed with you know
How many more ball games can we have?
I don't know I just think these politicians they they they're not it's money money money I don't know if you can't already funding them it's all NRA
It's the NRA man they got to be public in party by the balls they got them by the short hairs and that that's why no matter what how many of these things go on
Until a public steps get angry and I don't see them very angry here this morning so far until a public finally says Jesus Christ this is not a way for civilized people to live
There's nothing's going to change you know what for Congress okay good luck to you
Okay one caller on the board this morning thank God we got that Marlon game coming up in 1230 today the giant's in those red hot mallens
Anybody care about that? Oh 1230 the free game show
So that means I can get out of here early that because obviously there's a tremendous amount of burning amount of interest in this topic this morning
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line look at that are these people whipped up to a frenzy no are they pissed off and fired up no are they firing it out there to God then fire and range no they're firing it
See when when you're that crazy that you become you become a custom you accept this that this is the way I've told you this a million times this is the way life is supposed to be
Then you're as bad as the people that are running around with a gun you're crazy you're a lunatic you're a crazy person
If you believe that this is the way you're supposed to live your life
Every single day oh gee here's another kid roll 14 year old kid he's dead why because somebody had a gun laying around
You can you can go out and I was reading an article yesterday before this thing happened about it's easier to buy a gun than a guy damn pack of cigarettes
And that's the goddamn truth just like those kids out there in Colorado they could they were old enough to buy a gun legally but not a can of beer or a pack of cigarettes
What does that tell you about the sickness in this country?
Here's Parkland hello hello Neil yes sir how you doing this morning I'm psychotic I can tell listen
Has anybody told you about the channel seven report on help me Howard on one of the things I've ever seen in my life they have this girl
It's a bitching about the fact that she won money from a radio station, but she didn't get the money yeah and so they get Howard Picklestein involved you know to get the money
Station my discipline I wonder
It was born I was alright thanks for the good news by the way I finally got my bonus check this morning it's in my pocket now
I bitched in threat not to come in anymore yes that's exactly what I was thinking of the Gregory correlation there isn't incredible people think I make this stuff up I'm not making it up and
Help me Howard he finds out that it was just like a snap like a bureaucratic snap food right and the check was laying there but they just forgot to mail it thank you
Good. Yeah. I wasn't me ol say the same kind of thing about them and don't be buying anymore those mouse pads while you're at it right and now here's the other thing
Yeah tonight appearing at the last biggest cap array in Lauderdale the one the only Ron Jeremy okay thanks for the bad news now you see we're going so well did you had to get to that
5 6 7 0 5 6 8 we're not interested in Corey Sabin spy reports today we got a short show I mean Jesus I mean this guy this was good stuff what he had the beginning
port to get to run Jeremy 5 6 7 0 5 6 you see everything with American public to make joke it's you know who cares there's nothing wrong man we got mental illness we got the newspapers
on us we got to come up with all this money to build a stadium we don't care about the fact that we got a handful of gun nuts of lunatics running the whole
country and jeopardizing your life and your kids and everybody else on every street corner nobody cares about that how are we going to come up with a
lot of money to build a new stadium that's what we care about so that some multi billionaire can continue playing games God is it's sick I can't I'm counting the days till I can get out of this
God damn crazy country and it is it's a crazy frickin country and if that sounds un-American you'll bet your sweet ass I am un-American because this isn't the
civilized place it's a barbaric slaughterhouse mobile in Fort Lauderdale hello hello me yes I think they ought to stop shooting people yeah okay thanks here's a mobile in Miami hello hello yes
sir yeah Neil did you see on channel seven had about this girl that was in a blow up the junior high school and they sent a
third to a year in a maximum security for juvenile yeah and they were crying about it was such a hard sentence
but she had a website just like all these other people I say 10 to 20 sounds minimum to me I think so I'm going to worry you know when I was a kid I'm only 25 years old now but when I was a kid if you pull
something like that you wouldn't be around for a year you want like 10 to 20 right exactly it's right and I hate to break the
news to all these bleeding hearts out there but when so when somebody who said juvenile blows your crap away you're just as dead as if they were
40 years old yeah what about this 12 year old kid they killed the six year old and now they're saying that they're
have to let them out the kid you got beat up inside all right you do to the six year old girl you'd be the crap out of her and kill her didn't just get the crap out of her he murdered her
yeah but then he gets a little little beat up parents in in the prison so they got like well just remember he's got connections you know yeah
there you mom he's got connections right oh god have a good day then and back to you all right but I'm
going to get too heavy here today doing huh oh are we do now I just I just would like to know what the
saturation point is in the public out there at what point you finally say I mean like this jerk to a
call to go oh yeah stop shooting people yeah big joke it's very funny very funny how about if it's your
kid that they're going to shoot next time you might be singing different tune you jackass crazy crazy
insane people running around 30 40 50 thousand year that's only with handguns by the way forget about the
oozees and all the other automatic weapons just the handguns 30 and 40 and 50 thousand like
the words like talking it's like taking a can of Raid and killing a bunch of ants that's how much
we value human life in America like stepping on a guy named Ant Hill here's a mobile in Miami hello
hello there yes sir I just wanted to ask you a question as far as the guns and portals are
concerned is it a just an issue of their constitutional right to have a gun or is it more
that's what they make it into that's what they claim it is but they're sick they're obsessed with
guns a gun is a phallic object to them so there's no like money situation nobody's making money
off the fact of course the gun manufacturer to jogganist are an enormous business it's a multi-billion
dollar business of course okay I just want to I just want the correct fire to find out what it
more so the their constitutional right to have the gun or what are they still not far as it more like
money or is the contribution of right is just an excuse okay okay okay all right thanks for saying
opal just say no just say no to stadiums just say no to have penny sales tax just say no to more
gun no just say no to Charlton has no to the NRA just say no no more crap just say no to these
crazy Republicans who are in bed who are who are just own lock stock and barrel if you're part in
the barrel part by the by the NRA every time you know we had the little thing and oh yeah we're
gonna do this so we're gonna do that in Congress do anything no no and I think it's about
God damn time these media people who are of course exploiting this in our love and man they did
this they're they're moist they're like forming a place where it's illegal in Broward County
because they love this stuff how about a gigantic expose on this NRA and all this crap and about
the thing that I'm got in my hand right now from business week magazine you know once in a while
like a few weeks ago they had a piece on 60 minutes or one of the 48 hours whatever it is but not
enough now how about talking about how it is in other countries where this stuff doesn't go on
where you can actually walk the streets three in the afternoon three in the morning and you're not
worried about somebody getting shot right and send your kids to school and don't have to worry
about whether they're gonna come home alive or in a box in a body bag you show me a country where
there's no value on human life and I'll show you a place that's in real big serious trouble baby
and you're in it you're right in the middle of it here's Miami hello hey Neil yes sir I'll give you
an example of exactly what the problem is I was listening to Hank yesterday this guy called in
this is maybe 10 15 minutes after your show maybe even heard it and got called in and a
Hank had just found out about the shooting in California is that where was California right and
he made some comments about it how unbelievable it was and next car comes on he's like yeah that's
that's unbelievable I just don't understand what these people are thinking and without skipping
a beat anyway did you hear Jimmy this morning what he said and they went right into oh right oh
you you've got to understand this radio station 20 hours a day I mean it's one dimension I've
put it this before they could be dropping nuclear weapons on Jacksonville and we'd still be here talking
about hey you think that Tony Martin's going to get off from that rap so we can play for that
off and do we still be talking crap on here I mean there comes a point in your life when there
are some things that are more important by so far real life we're not talking about fun and games
we're talking about real life that they so far supersede this crap but the the moron the sports
nerd nothing really matters to them except you know we go in the ballgame well it seems like we can
whenever we need a stadium we can free up hundreds of millions of dollars and at the same time
we're hearing about how our public schools are failing and we're going to have to give vouchers to
people so they can bail out you know I don't hear any self-tax votes for improving the public
schools so we don't have to send our kids to or or having more security in public schools and
also in places like like this daycare center yesterday and how about you know the JDL which
I'm not a big fan of there's the Jewish defense league which are very millivent but maybe they
got a point maybe if there was some now JDL guy with an oozy standing there guarding the doorway
maybe this guy might have gone someplace else well I don't know I don't think more guns and
everybody think I've been to the wild west and we already already got it yeah that's true well
I guess just got to get out of here okay you hear what Jimmy said have a great day okay
1026 work out we got a chance to be special yeah you're a special alright Jimmy get a haircut by the way
hi I'm Ed Buford a Buford agent liquor and guns we have the largest selection of
booze and firearms in the state and will personally assist you in choosing the corrupt
alcoholic beverage and weapons for your next outing going squirrel hunting and you'll love our
low prices on schnapps and hang grenades living in the city shut about our deal on hand guns
of California one maybe you aren't interested in hunting or self defense maybe you just like to get
drunk and shoot a fail box well we've got gallons of wild turkey and 44 magnum shells on sale
this week only we're open 24 hours we've never checked IDs and we're in our air proved so come
on down to Buford and liquor and guns where everything leaves loaded all right we got a fact from a
crazy person Tom G NRA life member nice going Tom it says Neil is a bootlicking socialist how do you
like that it says this country was founded on religious nuts with guns how do you like that for a
start religious nuts with guns the second amendment protects your right to say whatever
that you want no I hate to break the news you Tom it's the first amendment okay not the second
amendment that's the one you're all worked up about guess what millions of law abiding honors
gun owners did nothing evil yesterday don't vilify the gun because it's an inanimate object it does
not cause the evil user our socialist and we defenders of the bill of rights and the constitution
will always defeat you in your ilk study history a little bit and learn of what happens to a disarmed
populist they're massacred by their government good luck to you sir Tom G NRA life member
yeah all those countries in western Europe all those people are being massacred by their governments
and have been for hundreds and hundreds of years have an a no no in addition to which I hate to
break the news to you they had a piece on this just a week ago coincidentally after the Atlanta
massacre about what the second amendment really means and what the intent was and they pointed out
that back during colonial days a very tiny percentage I think was like three or four percent of the
public actually owned any kind of weapon any kind of firearm of course we didn't have no oozee
back then damn it but of course the time he's an expert he knows his crack and then he didn't have
to waste his time with the rest of the facts he should have just ended after the first sentence
this country was founded on religious nuts with guns all right let's hear it for religious nuts
with guns nice going Tom G you're a genius you're a rocket scientist you're a typical NRA moron
in the still hope you have a great time hope you and Charlton has to know
let's see what comes out on top so to speak here's a lady in my any hello
hey Neil you know that movie was packed off in an R.I.S. Schwarzenegger I think it was roller dome or
where they're you know they they turned violence into entertainment like a like a game show
well that's what the media has done that it's a form of entertainment now I think to the media
oh yeah they're loving it Fox Fox News Network CNN if the NBC MSNBC all these talking head people
they're loving it in fact last night I'm flipping around all the channels to see what information
I'm getting here's Larry King tonight and he presents it like like it's an entertainment show
tonight and who does he bring out that jury spence again at terrible god damn lawyer there from
Macolorado all the same old tired talking heads pontificating about violence on television and
all of a sudden bullcrap yep and and I don't think I don't really blame the public as much as the media
because I think we've been spoon fed so that we're desensitized now by what the media's
condition does to to react to you know I don't I don't let's make sure we keep almost
pot smokers in jail because guns are great they're important they're like shoveling an apple pie
yeah they're the most harmless people in the world are you know pot smokers they're
they're the most passive people in the world yeah man okay bye bye
yeah let's make sure we keep our prisons and jails loaded with all those pot growers and pot smokers
because that's the threat to all you safe law-abiding Americans out there not crazy people religious
nuts with guns to quote my good friend Tom G a lifelong NRA member nice going Tom Greenline
religious nuts with guns here's a lady in Miami hello hi Neil yes ma'am how a question for you
I've been doing the actors diet for five weeks and a hundred okay well listen stick like that
on your throat five six seven oh five sixty pond five sixty on a mobile one line we got a
short show today two and a half hours I'm not interested in the Atkins diet today I'm not
interested in how's Cory saving dude over there in Fort Myers we wish him our best we're
talking today about something you know I hate a little more important than are we gonna have
four hundred million dollars for a stupid stadium give me a fricking break okay get a brain sweet heart
let's hope that she's been sterilized already so she don't wind up reproducing God for bid
fourth sterilization just keep that in mind that's the most important two words you'll ever
hear in your life fourth sterilization that's the only hope for the future of this country let me
tell you that right now here's Hollywood hello yeah yes sir yeah Neil you know I never had it
done in my life and I started are you better get with it man no no no no no no you know I started
going along on this theory of team maybe I want to get on you know and then I read about those
those six cops up a thing you look who had that little Dominican guy who were just coming
home from work they had him in a little hallway uh-huh and six trained police officers who
been with it all six six thousand shots right it took six out the only animated team times right
they had them in a shoe in a foot in the knee yeah yeah well as I yesterday there were like
hundreds around he was firing all over the place so you know with his oozey or whatever it was
and only you I want to appear hitting five people so you know how can you have people out there
with guns who are not trained you know like they call around all thing with those those
they would have shot more or the kids more the students come at the house if you got six guys
who can't hear the guy all right the fact is that a sane country doesn't allow its citizens to
walk around with guns and to walk into a gun show like it's some kind of a recreational sporting
event and just by every kind of automatic weapon and grotesque conceivable weapon onto the sun
without any kind any kind of anything you know the Supreme Court also reviewed the second
amendment to deal in case you you want to up on this thing and they said that if we are allowed
to arm militia right individuals that's right that's what it was intended for that's exactly what
it's actually what it's they said so that's why the states have the right to ban guns that they wish
like you remember do you are at the Sullivan War for all of you as I grew up in New York you couldn't
carry a little good knife well you you you ain't you ain't seen nothing yet man it's going to
really get heavy duty now a lot of you know it's it's about time a lot of people scream like
okay thanks thanks let me say it again because I'm on my what was it limperasted facts socialist whatever
that the times you that faxes let me say it again a Harris pool conducted before these last three
incidents the one up there in Atlanta the one in Alabama now this one in Los Angeles 73%
of Americans not favorite tougher handgun controls I'm sure would have been like 95% against the
the sale of all these automatic weapons Chicago detroit more than other 20 other cities if I have
lost it's blaming the firearms industry for the staggering toll of urban handgun violence and
are seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages just like they might have to the tobacco
industry they're going after the gun manufacturers and believe me they're going to nail their
ash to the wall because civilized people don't want to live like this just so Tom G can talk about
what a macho guy he is and he can sit around with his NRA buddies and polish their peace
and he's probably waxing it right now he's dead weapon
he's just hope to come out that he should say I will run run run never put his jealousy go away
you're run to the post can she feel fine run run run never put his jealousy go away
245 60 WQM unfortunately we got that horseball a Marlon and Giants game in 1230 this afternoon
with a pregame show anyway here's the facts the facts as I'm getting here this morning so far
our paranoid and delusional like this one from our good friend Eddie and homestead who says
you hear this Neil what happened in California was terrible but you cannot love all of us with
those crazy idiots I really don't care what you're a pastor say about the United States and I will
never give up my right to own a firearm I will support tougher gun laws short of banning them love
you show Eddie and homestead I will never give up my right to own a firearm how do you like that so
in other words Eddie and homestead is so obsessed with guns and with his right to have one that no
matter how much jeopardy that places all while biting people and he will never give up his right
because that's the American F and way and he doesn't care that the rest of the civilized world
thanks for a bunch of barburetory he don't care about anybody thanks don't confuse any with the
facts paranoia rain supreme in Eddie's house here's a mobile in Miami hello yeah how you doing
Neil okay sir I don't want to take a position on pro guns because I would wish that all guns
would be removed from our society but something disturbs me here yes this is a federal bureau
investigation statistic if the only one I have it's the only one I know this valid of all the people
that were arrested last year 1998 violation of gun existing gun laws only 20 percent of those people
were prosecuted that's alarming yeah so the existing gun laws apparently are not the problem
and more gun laws doesn't appear to be the reason that I let people walk into a gun show and
by automatic weapons and so the bill that they passed in 1994 and I'm not I'm not I'm on another
defensive motion just saying what disturbs me all I do was interject one thing and you you get very
defensive as soon as I said it no but I'm not you're you're you're changing the subject
no I'm not you're talking about Neil sir hang up calm down aren't you alarm that the existing gun
I don't I don't talk to assholes like that okay if you want to have a conversation you say
your piece which I listen for like 45 seconds I try to make one point that the existing laws don't
have any teeth especially because of the NRA and the gun nuts and the Republicans the right wing
Republicans and that's you don't even let me get my point it no you don't want to make a point
for guns but as soon as I start making an alternative point but I don't get excited I don't talk
to assholes like you sir this is a talk show it means I talk you talk it's called a conversation
I realize that's something really revolutionary but that's what it's called a freaking god damn
conversation sir and thank you for whatever it is you said god here's a mobile in Miami hello
hey Neil how are you let's talk in addition to which this guy don't understand we got to keep all
those pot heads in jail we don't have room for people that commit crimes with guns we got to keep
the pot heads behind bars that's the important thing yeah I'm not gonna keep us safe go ahead sir
I have to agree with you but I don't think you're the right messenger for the uh for the uh NRA
or anti NRA and why is that sir because you're contradiction in your lifestyle your
your your is what is bad with this uh with this country it's your lifestyle your contradictions oh I
see the fags are the ones who are prone with America is that it sir oh that's it that was the
end of the call my lifestyles what's wrong with America yeah the fags are running around killing
everybody aren't they no yeah last time I checked with those dead weapons five six seven oh five
sixty pound five sixty see there's another one of those NRA people and exactly what we're talking
about crazy right wing lunatics that's precisely what the problem is it's the fags yesterday it
was the Jews uh with the sparsas it's everybody else worth the problem with America our lifestyle
no it's crazy people like usur with your guns that's the American frickin lifestyle
here's cruel springs hello oh you're absolutely right on this one I mean you know I'm
watching this I'm getting sick I got a four year old and in in the day school you know please
cool when every time they go over to kids house to play I call up the parents I say let me ask you
do you have a you know gun in your house and I've had one person tell me yes and I don't let my son
go over to play good for you pal and my son is a boy can I play with someone I see you can't you
you get you in fact I didn't want to say it but I said you know you're never gonna play with
an ever right because I can't allow that and uh I mean here I'm buying gas this morning and it's
you know you just got to watch yourself you don't know where anything's gonna come from now
schools houses of worship work yeah there's only one so guns have to be out for stock broker
okay it's working as a bad day which has had a lot of lately some of these pissed off yeah guns have
to be out with they just have to be take you can't be allowed to own one if you want we'll give you
a musket just like in 1776 yeah that's about it and let me say it again back the CBS story last
week the piece that in the CBS news was great back in colonial days a very tiny percentage of
the public even had muskets the whole the whole concept of the second amendment was for a
militia not not so that individuals could run around with a bunch of firearms you know and as far
as you know you see the entertainment value of it and I agree I'm watching Fox News and it's like
rampage you know but they got it this is how they're gonna there's 500 somewhat channels they're
gonna get the word out but well everyone's gonna know but when you see an idiot like Gary Bauer
who's running for president and again he's preaching you know well gotta get back to God
yeah the man of the quasticon is for head when they had a mon or not was he hiding it this week
what what was that I said was his hostess wants to go showing this week no but those yellow teeth
want okay thanks for the good news later see if the passport office
local minister Reverend Don Harp during a memorial service in Atlanta for victims of that
recent office massacre up there said it's harder to get a prescription filled than to buy a
handgun in the United States nice go on Reverend pop goes the weasel and then of course in the
same newsweek magazine that I got yesterday I think it was in here I hope so they got oh here it is
this is this is I thought that the article last week about that Hispanic business that bullcrap
was bad this is worse an article by Susan Folludi contributing editor from newsweek author of
the forthcoming stiff the betrayal of the American man she's got a whole article here about why
the American male does these things only a few deranged men go on shooting sprees but many
feel cheated that the system has let them down and in some powerful ways it has we're supposed to
relate to this guy in Atlanta that went in in shot twelve people because he was a gay a day trader
on that's right must have been his lifestyle he was a gay trader like I was right
I mean this article is the worst piece of swill we're supposed to now start looking for the
reasons that these people have been the let down by society just like those kids in little
ten society let them down and as a result they were pissed off and fired up and whipped up to a
frenzy so let's go kill some people to let our frustrations because it's the American F and
you're crazy Susan and the people at newsweek are crazy are from putting this swill in there to try
somehow to rationalize and justify why crazy people do this crap here's a lady in Hollywood hello
hi Neil yes man I agree with you completely I'm very upset about this thing that happened out
in California with the kids nobody safe anywhere in our country yeah by the way I want to know
is Brian going to do a bit about these Jewish kids like you did with the Kennedy's oh cute very
cute five six seven oh five sixty I don't think anybody killed Jay okay junior I think he was the one
that you know got on the plane himself when he shouldn't now very cute five six seven oh five
sixty this goes to show you the mentality the public out there like it's a joke okay no we'll do
a bit on assholes like you swiveharmed in fact that's coming up Monday no doubt we'll probably take
your call and stick it right in the middle there we're just stick it wherever you don't want like
maybe in your back don't know a big good spot probably a big target here's West Palm Beach hello
it puts the gun in the basket yeah and and the lotion in the back yeah put the lotion in your
ass okay pal oh it's already in there one of my Tonya big joke haha very funny five six seven oh five
sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line that's okay after the ballgame Hankleby I'm
going to talk more about that ball in that ballpark that new stadium after the Giants game
managed to be on six to ten tonight at Kaplan I have only all the odds on games that have yet to
be played even after every the last American is blown away with a firearm they'll still be out there
playing their ball games that Kaplan will still have the odds so rest assured that you know nothing
changes here's a mobile in Miami hello hello Nils yes sir all right that lady who just spoke yes
made my stomach hurt with that comment uh-huh that was disgusting but anyway I called to tell you
that I don't know if you heard about it let's take a shot at Neil now because a bunch of little kids
got shot out in Los Angeles okay so that's a great day to take a shot at Neil let's pick on
Neil's a bad guy that was sick that was pretty sick yeah but um anyway while the swat team was sitting
in front of the hotel I understand yes the guy was on his way down on catching a bus or on the highway
or something heading out of town yeah I love the way these swat teams just like at little thing you
know the two the two murderers the two kids have been dead for hours and the cops are surrounding
the school and the swat teams and they go in and they're leading the kids up in the meantime the
murderers have been dead for hours people are bleeding to death inside you know like that teacher
but in the meantime they're out there in there you know I and they said well see we don't want to
needlessly risk their lives I thought that's what they got paid to do with the ghost saving us
in people and risk their lives in a process and how come last night they're they're thinking and
they're talking and they're plotting and planning and in the meantime the guys probably watching
in the television he gets out the guy damn window he's on a bus who down knows where he is
he's gone but I saw my side of the schoolhouse chicken over mattresses and chicken cans and you know
all this other crap while the guy is gone yeah so I'm just going to sit back and listen to
people bash you about how we should have guns in America okay thank you man okay yeah the gun
squeezes baby oh that's neil that's socialist bag he's a bad guy comey pit go fag
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line I'll tell you one thing that bitch he ought to be
pistol whipped I'll tell you that right now before we ban the last handgun pistol whipped that
bitch that call three calls ago back maybe we can get one of the remaining Kennedys to come over
to your house okay with an oozy for you stick it in your rectum have a good time boil your brains
out because I'm sure that's where they are that's where they're hiding there's a mobile in West Palm
Beach hello say nil yes sir yes you probably cares more about the Kennedys than she does a little
kid yeah oh I see a great parallel don't you between a guy who got you know had a plane crash
yeah the magazine and millions of dollars yeah only 200 million yeah well two things about this the
first thing that makes me sick is if I'm watching television and a gun show commercial come on yeah
and then they show the father with like three or four year old son on his shoulders where an
army fatigue you know that's a great way to bring your son up yeah you know to let's go kill some
real it into their head Johnny let's go kill something now yeah let's go kill something for
Christ yeah and then not just that but look what was in that guy's van it's not just guns he had
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line did he say she out I think he did say she out
and there he slipped one in there on me here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale hello Mr. Rogers speaking
I bail from the same part of the country that you originally come from yes upstate New York area
small community I grew up with guns I mean hunting and fishing yeah that type of
thing to respect a weapon I'm a career military person yes sir former green beret yeah
this whole thing is very upsetting to me I have hand guns I have rifles and shotguns
I have so many I mean the way you make it sound like like how many like 20 or 30 50
I have a nice collection worth a lot of money yeah
they have them all locked away safely behind everything's taking care of me as far as that concern yeah
I have my concealed handgun permit for the state of Florida I don't I don't feel comfortable without
a gun on my person because of the way society is now a day yeah I understand that I'm not a
wacko I would never do well nobody nobody who nobody who the people are perpetrating these crimes
would never say their wacko is either nobody says hey guess what I'm a wacko look out nobody says that
I understand that Mr. Rogers right I this this is very disturbing to me yeah you already said that
these these killings all over the time so what is the point the point is that how do you separate
a lot of biting citizens you don't you don't what you do is you take guns away from people and
you stop having innocent people being slaughtered by maniacs with guns that's the best way to do it
see if it's a responsible country like in Switzerland and it'll let where they're all members of
the military they all can have guns and they're not running around blowing each other's brains out
this doesn't happen they're okay so when responsible people demonstrate that they're capable of
doing it then you let them have them when the country shows overwhelmingly that there are too many
irresponsible people you don't let individuals have guns period that's the answer sir and hope you
sell your collection to make a lot of money
there like J.F.K.
good a sport a better play
it's J.F.K. at 4.5
you don't know a five or something cheap and crappy dreams that flow
a burning that my head's about the only way
I could say
now let me show the ones that left alive today
from what they call the Kennedy curse
if Dorothy Hill Gallen was alive she'd say
you're a bitch only gonna get the worst
we miss you the sound of gunshots all night
it's a pain
but it's laughing so it's water
or it's a pain
it's just sounds like gunshots all night
it's a pain
but it's laughing so it's laughing so it's laughing
we didn't play it for today. it's 11.03.05.06 W.T.Q.M
here's a fact from a guy named Joe
who says in 1986 we had a shooting at his high school in Pinellas Park
one death and one dean
and one cafeteria worker where killed
it says one cafeteria worker
and it still lots of people who are killed
as Nancy said just say no to shooting your effing gun as what Joe says
hey man Joe
they're coming to take your guns away all you in our A-NAT
So can I just tell you that right now
no more goddamn guns
no more freaking guns let them off you have gone let them kill each other like
they do in cissly
here's corals brings hello
any of your good show this morning
uh... like you
kind of confused both public's reaction to all this yeah
oh it's a big joke yeah they're blending lifestyle you saw buddy nevin's
article in Saturday's uh... some set no i did not thank god he was addressing
the uh... teachers in the uh... swing club
and he wrote that people are now calling the sunset moment school board
turning in teachers who are living together
unmarried
so obviously the reason our schools are failing inward they're shooting up our
capital our schools is that we have adults
who are living together on their own
unbelievable
not that
schools are failing because of
they can't read a right
they blame lifestyle
right everything is not really right
it's all about the bookers out there
they think your left-caller you probably support the marlin state in thinking
that self-sales gun well you know i'd listen to that guy you know he went through
his whole life story the green beret this is that fifty million hand guns and
oozee's innocent and
and then he tells me well i'm not a nut you know i'm responsible person
and i'm thinking of myself
and you think it's a habit of a ballgame say that the dolphins or the heat
they'd react a little differently
you know because i would interfere with the entertainment
you know we don't want to do that that's the last thing we need we can't afford to
be school with ball games especially around to i am and get the last thing we
could afford
yeah and and again of course the marlins can afford that because then they're
only get like eighteen twenty people showing up as it is
you think if people bring in their hand guns that might help them uh...
the stadium or maybe they can have like a gun show out there you know
great beyond the first baseline would be good
yeah they killed someone as long as they can play ball well
we'll sign them just shoot them in the leg
okay that's it and have a great day
here let's get to the important things okay let's get to those stadiums how
many can we build before the god damn millennia is over
shoot them in the leg right five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty
on the eighteen t wireless line
yeah everything you see i've told you this before the public it's the sense
of ties to become numb it's like oh yeah here's another big story this week
it was Atlanta last week and then the gun all about which there was only three
people didn't make a big splash with that
and then i shouldn't have said splash and then we got the uh... you know five
kids in Los Angeles yesterday
shooting little kids can't shoot each other and you know something the
public goes along the merry way here all the lividest these are not the things
that are important to the american public they don't care and that's why you
live in a slaughterhouse
is a mobile in my mirror mar hello
hey uh... before i get to my point i think that what do you mean uh... you
shouldn't say splash i missed that one
i don't want to get that bitch upset with a challenge on the whole okay now
she still in morning
two things i want to bring up
he still a couple pieces
my daughter goes to a jewish day camp in there there was a half a dozen
cops there this morning and i got explained to my kid why there's cops there
right
it sucks
you know i mean it's part being jewish people hate you for being
jewish and i'm about to do you know i mean i don't know this isn't a
jewish problem sir the people are the
well i mean
i i know i'm not i'm not saying it is certainly is not but you know that we do
it for you yesterday it was and in lanta it wasn't and the guy that you
shepherd up in my own thing that wasn't uh... you know it in the fact is that we
got a lot of sick crazy bigoted people and a lot of your responsible people
running around and that's bad enough but when they're all running around with
weapons
then we know it makes a lot more dangerous worse i know here's the other point i
wanted to bring up
about the handgun situation at home
uh... you never read in the paper about somebody who has a handgun at home for
protection killing someone that broke into their house you want to go once in a
great while very rarely never i i don't ever
ever get you
very well but every week somebody's kid find their gun kills him right
that that's what handguns in the home do
and i'll never have a gun in my house it's just uh...
we had to run yesterday morning i read the story at the beginning of the
show to fourteen year old kid in date county and that they were dealing around
with his uncle's twenty two caliber rifle and
sorry
for you know he's dead
you know at least they changed the laws in one way is they make the the gun owner
have some copability right that's right
but it doesn't stop the kids from getting killed
it's after the fact that what kind of a person and this is there's a lot of
said before
responsible people don't leave their kids land their guns laying out where their
kids can get them or somebody else can get
them
you're out and how many and how many crimes by the way recommended by people who
steal those guns that you're talking about that people might protect themselves
that's another thing i mean that you know i've never been i've kind of been on
the fence about it because it never affected the one way or the other but you
know what it might and i hope something gets done before it does
okay
good luck to us all
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eighteen two wireless
line who was on the fence
not a good place to be sitting on the fence they do
practice when you're sitting there on the fence pal
levon a kind of sounds like b4 he's always on the fence i'd surprise this room
for this guy
they're both keeping it five sixty w kumagat the marlin game and a giant pregame
of culture today is there any even minimal planning
they want five in a row you still care no they don't care they don't want to
listen they don't want to know from it
but i'll tell you one thing i have to say about it
out here's my any hello
my any
meal yes sir
uh... two things
uh... i think uh... mayor
tenises uh... theme song should be okay great thank you
here's uh... hollywood hello
yes sir
uh... well i'm twenty five years old from upstate new york and uh... i've had
guns for a little while mean that i choose for hunting uh...
i agree with you on the issues here my father lived in uh... in germany for a
little while
yeah and uh... you live there for a while and only people have done the
least in germany i haven't been to any other places in europe and
only people have done the police police i wonder they call
yeah and uh... you know the world around with her who's these and everything
nobody bothers anybody it's all pretty mellow and i hope people in italy with
guns are the uh... policia and the uh... mafia the mafia don't shoot like innocent
people you know
and basically here people are shooting each other other than the the nucks with
the you know
there are like the gang members and stuff like that in this country but
might i really don't have a problem with uh... giving up my gun i i use it
to each other year for hunting you know if the government made some kind of law
prohibiting you know gun you know making the second amendment from constitutional
what i would do it mean if they
that they don't have to be made on constant so i got to do is interpret it the way
it was written and has to do with a militia not with the right of individuals to be
running around with uh... you know all kinds of firearms
with collections of every kind of weapon with bombs and hand grenades and all
the other stuff that there's no case in california uh... this is gotta stop
i agree agree i mean if they if they would make people
basically give up their guns i would do it if they paid me for it you know get me
for my guns i would care
you know
and uh... when i was one or those you know only twenty five years old but when i
remember growing up
pretty much during the seventies i don't recall issues like this ever really
happening as much as they do now exactly well i can recall growing up before you
did when there were no there were no metal detectors in airports there was no
such thing as putting your luggage to a metal detector because and also there
was not this business i saw peace they had a little last night about how they
the statistics are better at how many kids were expelled or suspended from school
in the country last year for bringing in weapons to school there was no such thing
when i went to school it was it was unheard of it didn't happen
right i want the school
i grew up sixteen years up in upstate new york uh... the cap skills and then i i
was i've been down here for about ten years i want the high school down here i
want to kill you
down south and candle there and uh... i remember one day coming into school
and i'm walking into the park and i see like swat team and all these police
they're coming out and then i see two kids can thrown up on the car and they
threw like a a spot off shotgun on the car and a pistol in the car too
they can't just call the seldom great i mean well that's down here i mean it but
it's everywhere that's that's the problem is it's not just down here it's not
just an l.a. or in york or in the big city no i see a lot that's right and it's an
alabama it's happening almost and i think suspension and expulsion that that's
to for sure i think the kids that bring guns to school i think they ought to go to
jail for like minimum three-year sentence will be good
i'd be great i mean i i agree with the people i think put the gun crazy people
in there nobody's calling each other with a joint
i agree i mean it's just like i said in europe you go there you see how
civilized everything is nobody's nothing ever happened i've never seen any
problems in japan
right on their subways no problems nothing i mean people were nice to each
other
hello goodbye and elevators and things like that
i don't know it's just this country's just too savage
okay pal are you taking the past port office well
we'll do five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a eighteen and
t-line i mean i i think the most disgusting people are the ones the
masses out there who have been become brainwashed and they just accept this
oh well what can you do with it through their arms up and they're like well
this is just the the world we live in today no it's not the world we live in
today it's only in barbaric places like here
hollywood hello nail yes sir
i used to sit in it you just said it in fact uh... you know go to the past port
office i used to laugh about that and then you say well he's just saying that
tongue and cheek but i don't think that anymore i i'm gonna be here a few more
years i'm getting the hell out of here yeah uh... my family's from germany i don't
plan on going back there but uh... i'm gonna find someplace else this is a
nut house uh... a few years ago i live in Palm Beach i went to a gun show and if
you ever want your eyes open go and see go to a gun show sometime i mean it's
absolutely unbelievable
the anti-social like chocolate that i think all of these things uh... it's
frightening my body
is an ex-con he's a he's a he's a good guy now he's uh... you know i got a
family he's straight in his life around
and he wanted to get a block nine millimeter uh... to
just to protect his family he went in there ex-con's not supposed to have a
gun right country it took him less than fifteen minutes to get a uh... that
all right in the parking lot he bought it from a gun dealer
and uh... it's frightening i mean there's a deal these gun laws and all they mean
absolutely nothing if you want to go and you can get it
so
god help us okay see
yeah really highly recommend business week the august sixteen to show it's
the current issue
under fire big front page story gun control legislation litigation angry public
on the christmas here close-up look at the secret of industry the gun industry
which is making hundreds of millions and billions of dollars for a bunch of
people with no conscience
don't confuse them with a lot of maybe they got a lot of money to make
here's corral gables hello
nil yes sir i'm a twenty year member handgun control so if i get too political
to charge up just not to be out my soapbox
but uh...
you know a caller couple times ago mentioned you know you know you learn to
learn by the you know the the lack of the prosecutor or rate you know and
they don't prosecute people you know so forth
that is vintage in our aid language if you go into the website or read their
literature yeah i don't have to come to the
community of one of their people on the talking head show they
they spot the same crap it's not a problem having a guns out there it's the
it's the enforcement that's bad they're not putting these to let's office
game let's offer smoke screen and all of that book wrap and let and of course what
does that have to do with all the
uh... thousands and thousands of people all these kids are getting blown away
i'd like to skid my me yesterday right it just offense me that you know that
if you're liberal or if you're democrat or even if you're middle of the road
that you're automatically pro criminal yeah and the anti
criminal and you know
very much in favor of really prosecuting people but also at the same time you
know be being favor of reasonable you know gun control measures
it's not a blocker wide issue is is it would make it up any person that's a
rational human being that's been anywhere outside this country anywhere civil
outside this country realizes this isn't the way that people are supposed to live
there's just real two quick things i'd like to say because right now congresses and recess
and when they reconvene there is a very important child safety protection law up
hr one five zero one and if i may give can i give you the what's i'd trust to hand
control because it's rather than give out numbers just get on there if you're
interested in getting active or just sing what you can do about uh... passing
this bill
get on w-w-w
it's all one word handgun control dot org
it has a couple of things if you look at the site map it'll tell you what you can
do and so forth
and then the other thing i would tell you just if nothing salt you know your
intelligence but for the people that bring up the second amendment thing
uh... basically nine times that has been
tried to be redefined by out of the supreme court or federal court of nine times
is been struck down as it is it is it the second amendment is open to
state right redefining your reapplying it as as they see fit
so they're all for nine on that so you know they never read the second clause of
the second amendment they just seem to concentrate on the phrase right to bear
on
so um... that is just that uh... another you know inaccurate thing that they
would like to believe okay keep it up and okay thanks
here's a hollywood hello
yesterday speaking
how you doing great
okay great good talk to you like i said five six seven or five sixty pound five
sixty at least he was brief or right to the point you know i said yeah he was
right on it
here's plantation hello
plantation
and
strime i need hello
yes sir
okay i'm calling you from the state attorney's office
uh... far as the gun control issue they just passed that law ten twenty life
of the convicted felons
hold uh...
the firearms
they can have you heard about it i'm sure you have yeah
even what you recommend i grew up around on my whole life my father had a
gun
and i knew it was and i knew that i wasn't supposed to go near it
i never even thought of going here the gun you know
and uh...
what would you what would you say how
how would you say that we can get this uh... problem fixed because even if you are
we're weak we can't
yeah i mean we can't we can't stop the camp solver but we should be able to
make an attempt by first of all banning these guy then gun shows they should be
outlawed nobody should be able to walk into a pawn shop into a gun show and buy
a gun no way know how it's easier to find candy
i mean right
they pass all these laws and you know what the innocent people will be left without
the guns of people who are in all of the other part of it is no more plea bargain
you know how many years ago was it we had to three the three year minimum
mandatory sentence for uh... crimes committed with a hand and every guy
then case gets plea bargain before there's a conviction that's that's a joke
and let me tell you who the people who offers a plea bargain to definitely not
to state that judges give them a slap in the head yeah
and but we got to keep all those pot growers in jail you know we got to keep the
gl sells filled up with the dangerous people
yeah i mean they want to keep the rod it so they don't want cases on their
audit you know the best that the left case is on the right then they can the
better judge that they slept up
you know the bad people in the hand and then people who you know go out and smoke
a little weed they get you know
they get four years well thank god for that it back to well what was the story
i saw yesterday who was it to somebody other drug thing somebody got thirty five
years oh no that i mean thirty five years
i mean there's a guy here who got thirty five years for having sex
consensual effects for the four-year-old girl
okay that i mean people even a profit cuter started crying when the judge gave
him that because he says he wanted to offer oh yeah that was another one that
was just uh... the other day that was that last week again the guy i couldn't
believe that mean so many people were there in the press could not believe this
guy got thirty five years and this is a well thank god the sex police in the
pot police are doing their job yeah this is the next because god only knows
how dangerous that weapon is and god knows how big of a tramp the little girl
was i was being with him you know she was probably with a hundred other guys at
the same time yeah because he was you know she was fourteen years old and she
was i mean it's clearly stated and the evidence says that he was she was one
after him you know he was just kind of what i mean your guy you know you can go
for it anyway you know i'm sure that okay thanks
watch out for those dead weapons baby scored court
okay every time five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eighteen
t-wildest line eleven twenty seven at q a m
five at the t-bammy night kick my own ass outside
daddy we'll make the end of the year
that's his vote
okay
family

okay eleven thirty one five sixty w two and then you can feel the tension in the
area can smell it or something i can smell
just an hour away from that pregame show for the big Marlon Giants game as we
once again prove the Greg Reads ego is bigger than all the rest of us here at
q a m five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eighteen t-wildest line
here's Miami hello
Neil yes sir
uh... two things for you
uh... i think that uh...
mayor
penis
you know okay that same guy is before he's got a written down evidently two things
for you you had two things an hour ago when you called my home upon you at
the same point after you got the penis out
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the he started on a thought
wait a minute is this an instant replay is this a paper running hour what
here's south day hello
yes sir
well i don't want to direct from what are how many weapons he's got
i don't expect from the work on conversation you have into the topic but
i did want to clarify some things i have a police officer
and uh... it's not our job to lay down our lives
aimlessly for
no way wait a minute nobody said laid down your lives aimlessly but the idea that
police officers risk their lives to protect other people that's part of the job
every day sir
and
when you're going to go into a lot of situations like that you need to be prepared
and you have a strategy
well how many hours does it take
well i can tell you this much i wasn't there
but i don't know how to run a radio station and i'm not about to tell you
that it was
so i thought i was going to ask you
so in other words the public can't ever question what are the
rules they could make sure you can have questions
but i'm here to lend an opinion on it
that i would have confidence
in the police that they know what they're doing so they always know what they're
doing just like in the john that investigation and just like the oj prostitution
when you bring in when you bring in an srt which is a squat
you're talking about something that's been that they trained constantly
you're talking about something that it's you know it's in a paper
stand-rovering procedures on how to do something
and like i said i just wanted to lend you listeners know
that it's not you know a bunch of goofs
just standing there saying oh what's the best way to
but how long does it take?
how long does it take that person to create a strategy
we're not talking about the school in Colorado now we're talking about a motel
in a tiny motel in Los Angeles what we're talking about
sure and again i wasn't here i don't know all the
parameters of that case
but you know in addition to which when is something that'll be done so that the
media are prevented from showing i mean for crying out loud
they got that you've got somebody that i have to do it
the government has a nervous breakdown if i say crap on it here the FCC wants
to find us but if kknbc and all those other grey robbers want to have a
helicopter flying over showing the guy who's sitting in a hotel
from watching on television where the cops are then that's okay i guess
i agree with this sir
insanity
the tape there a lot to come up to the tape there a lot to go where
anywhere with the public is a lot to go
yeah
and you know it's up to their editors i guess or the people in there
and their power to determine what's going to go on the air
it's got to stop
yes it is
okay
how do we get these things
five six seven oh five sixty and it reminds me that the same thing
and when they were doing the littleton business and of course that media feeding
friends he was going on their all day that day and i went home and watched it on the
satellite all afternoon and and they're saying oh well we're not going to show
you this side of the building and as soon as they're saying that they're showing you
that side of the building then they're saying in Atlanta well wonder they don't want us to
show the roof of the building
and while they're saying it they're showing you the roof of the building
and here's all the cops up on top of the building and while they're telling you
that the cops don't want them to show it
how many times have I told you that the people in the media are crazy
irresponsible grave robbers as long as they can squeeze some ratings out of it
they don't give a crap whose life they jeopardize they don't care
that makes it even more exciting
let's get to more people killed
here's a mobile in Miami lakes hello
hey it was up
are you doing sir
no we all got to admit that these are the last days
they said bullcrap dude good religious guy
how come the religious people are always the ones that say
yeah always have to bleep out bullcrap
these are the final days yes sir that's a good simplistic way to look at my dark
conflicted friend that's a brilliant way
I bet your god must have something to do with it
maybe god was pissed off at the Jews yesterday they decided
okay let's go shoot some kids you know let's not kill anybody
but let's just go shoot up a bunch of kids and here's the guy we'll use
he'll be the conduit this 40 year old punk
and by the way great job again by the media fantastic job
I get home yesterday this incident it just happened a little while before
I got my TV going there and it's a teenager
above 17 year old teenager 5 foot 10
he's the suspect now or later it's a guy who's 5 foot 7
bald balding 40 years old
yeah you see his picture this morning
sure looked like some teenager to me who must still have the rough life evidently
huh must have done too many goddamn drugs
too many magic mushrooms
the guy is like 37 years old he could pass her 47 easy
but the first description of all is a teenager
right excellent job
here's plantation hello
plantation
Neil yes sir
well if it doesn't light up today pal I think it's lights out for everybody
you know it's it I'll tell you the NRA thing and the gun lobby is so scary
so frightening think about this for a minute I don't think anybody's brought this up
what other consumer product if there were airplanes that were malfunctioning
or food that was killing people right at seat belt so there were cars that were found
to have these things happen week after week and day after day
wouldn't it be off the market immediately wouldn't they sort of withhold
some things but the frightening thing is that we get immune to it or something
we take the paper up in five or dead in 11 or dead in 10 and 6
right after day after day
and the American public on an airplane public thanks to the way the media covers this
like it's some kind of a dock you drama instead of like some grotesque horrendous news event
the media just accept this like all it's like the OJ trial
oh here's another exciting thing we can spend some time with just please don't shoot us
well you know Neil knowing human behavior and the fact that I teach and I know
what makes human behavior tick the people act only in self-actualization
when it hurts you when it harms you and unfortunately it's going to take the
leadership of the NRA type people to have tragedy strike really close to home
and then something will happen the only time right and I'm not advocating going out
and picking off a few NRA members but that's when their family is
getting let's start hearing it or they totally knew that too
probably it's really frightening the powerful lobby is is totally totally scary
there's no other product that won't be pulled off the market none
and I don't know what we're going to do about it
okay pal alright see you see on the big ship
5 6 7 0 5 60 0 5 60 it's the final days we don't want to get your nervous or anything like that
but our smart finicky friend had called before I think he had it right
he said it's the final freaking days
that's right
so you've been getting all your crap together in fact you won't need any money so
just send it all to us here at QA and you won't need that cash because when you
go to heaven or where it's a work or whatever you're going to be you won't need no cash
they don't take credit cards either send it all over to us we'll take it off your hands
hmm
the era lettuce I don't know if you remember me
but I was the guy whose house you said I'd fire last you
God I miss you even though you blew up my car
caught all my hair off I miss you girl
but one quick question do you think you could let me know when you might let me out of this
pit no one's been here for weeks but I'm not complaining don't misunderstand me
because I loved you with all my heart but if you happen to see my mother we let it go I'm not dead yet
the era lettuce I want to tell you that the guy you saw with your best friend that wanted to be
he might have looked and talked just like me but that surely purely coincidental I was no way in near that place
I loved you too much to look at anyone else the era lettuce I had a deadish
hair and metal lips hotel I would never cheat on somebody who treats me so good
wins all those raries as all that money
hey come on let me out of the pit we are at the limit
it's 1.45 at 5.60 WQM 5.670 5.60 POM 5.60 on the 18T line here's a mobile in Miami
hello hello Neil yes sir yeah I just want to make a brief comment I work for government
maybe it's the other night stay which one I'm tired to carry a weapon in my job
I was listening to some of these people call in talk about how safe they are with them
I have two sons either one has any guns around their home I don't have any I wouldn't shoot a shotgun if somebody paid me
to unless I have to on my job when I get off my job I'm not on duty I call my local bank ahead of time
a range of my weapon locked up in a safety positive box I keep it separately if people thought
the guns were so safe like you say maybe they should go to places over in Europe where nobody carries one
I'd like to be working over there where I didn't have to but I don't I just want to make a brief comment about that's why I held on so long
because buying his safe I don't have to worry about picking it up and as soon as I get home that's where it goes
and if they were all gone I wouldn't have the job thank God
okay just want to make that comment so you keep up the good work thanks I think
thanks a lot
okay 5 6 7 0 5 60 0 5 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line and I you know we had some calls here today
but I can see there's there's no change it doesn't make any difference you become so immune to this craft
that we can have one of these every day oh wow let's give something to do this afternoon
it's a boring hot summer day let's go home and watch and see how many people got killed today
and we'll hear all the glory reports and then we'll go to the hospital and we'll have the hospital spokesman will come out and give us the report and hire all the glory details
and then we'll see the the SWAT team you know waiting to go in and barge in the motel and all the pictures
it's like a hobby now it's like a hobby for a neurotic country
they shoot out of the day
it's kind of just like Britain didn't outgrow that world a bullcrap this country's never outgrown a wild west mentality
and I don't think ever will
get pissed off and more somebody's crap away there you go they won't do it again
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line
here's a mobile in marathon hello
hey Neil how are you doing today?
okay sir
going along with everything you say and I don't mean this to Soundcore and it grew up in Indiana but I believe it to be true
it starts at home and if we don't turn on the channel sevens and the nonsense news
and they don't have the ratings they don't get the revenue and revenue is what makes all this stuff happen
it starts at home with teaching our own kids and our neighbor's kids and not letting our kids go to houses that have guns
it's you know there may not be a lot you can do but I know a mother lost a baby in a drunk driving accident
and got teed off and next thing you know there's mothers against drunk drivers and the money came back to the state that said
if you don't stop this you're not going to get the federal bucks
and until we get the legislators to step up and say okay state you ain't going to get this money
unless you're willing to compensate from that direction it probably won't change
but we can change our own house and our own neighborhood
this country has to be emancipated from the NRA
the quality of your life and everybody else's life in this country is controlled by a bunch of crazy people
called the National Rifle Association of a Stranglehold on Congress and until the day that we're emancipated from them
nothing is going to change
and have a great day
yeah and it lyric king he brings on oh yes that's his spectacle tonight tonight we got this one we got that one
yeah I mean talk about a shameless whore don't be just do that yeah
it brings out Jerry Spence they got to drag him out again there with his guy named Cowboy suit on
and he's on air pontificating about well television violence
you know do you think that this crazy guy that pulled this crap yesterday you think he was affected by television violence
no by goddamn video game no a lot of 40 year old guys playing video game
and if they are better called a pedophile police because that's why they're hanging around the arcade
and the guy there they with us with the stock the stock broker guy there in Atlanta you think that had to do with violence on television or in the movie no
but let's start looking for scapegoats let's dust off boring old Jerry Spence and bring his tired old ass back again there Larry nice job
don't forget the music we're listening to also
oh well that's definitely it no question about that
just ban all the music just make him listen to goddamn religious him is 24 hours and that'll do it
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line crazy people running your lives and you're all sitting around going
like that yeah nobody cares
here's Boca hello yeah Neil yes sir
well the every one of these incidents with the with the schools and all the the the serial killer on the railroad track
the police have been ineffective I I can on every one of those incidents I can't think of one where the police have made a difference
they either kill themselves or like this guy escaped or they turned themselves in
well where is the police done in any any of these incidents in the past year can you think of one where the police actually jumped in there and did anything
well ok that's not a past year but Oklahoma City they got that guy pretty quick me
don't they didn't they look for a guy in in North Carolina for for months and months with everything and they never came up with him
yeah and have at the oak the bombers for the Atlanta Olympics that they ever come up with him no
yeah that's an unsanitary guy up there they didn't like him too much they weren't his life pretty good
right that's a big guy right well they needed somebody to the game to go on yeah
but I mean of all these cases well where if the police really do that swat train in and everything but where they really captured anybody
yeah they got the people behind bars and they got the people to the swing clubs they got them out of there pretty good
you know it ok thanks for the good news sir I mean with all due respect you know they're good cops out there
a few of them and they do put their lives on the line very often unless they're just sitting there with a radar gun all day long
but yeah law enforcement in this country in fact I'll tell you who's doing even better job is old John Walsh on here
America's most wanted in fact that you know something that shows going to be on 24 hours a day on every network pretty soon
America's most wanted you're going to be spending all your time all your spare moments around work and school and
whatever else you want to do you're going to be spending all your time calling up John Walsh and those people because they're going to be so many
guy damn people killing everybody oh there he is we just walked down the street there's another one let's go get him
good job by the FBI and that command and business to it that was really good huh all those leaflets they pretended they handed
off that nobody ever saw down here which is picture should have been on the front page of the guy named Harold and that pawn shop slip
that was sitting there for two or three weeks into Miami Beach Police Department that had his motel address on it and his name and passport number
excellent job but let's go out there and read the swing clubs all by the way there is one good piece of news where the hell is it
at least temporarily private club gets temporary reprieve injunction issued in response to suit a judge
is ordered police to take a hiatus from arresting members of a private club in Fort Lauderdale where people dance partly naked and enjoy
obscene language oh my god they're enjoying obscene language in a private club well f them it's just a temporary reprieve
for the catch me out to a members only club whose attorney say it shouldn't be governed by laws meant for public
adult establishments and it goes on and on and Fort Lauderdale police detective Jim Wright says this has been going on for decades
the city has been defending and changing its strip club laws for years yeah because these are the kind of important things that we need to really clamp down on not
catching people with guns crazy people murderers we don't need to worry about that we need to worry about what consenting adults are doing in private clubs and
behind closed doors that's what we need to be concerned about the pleasure police not the crazy lunatics we can't catch them like the guy says
and he's right five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eighteen t line we got a couple lines open here this public isn't there
they're not whipped up to a frenzy they don't give a crap they're used to it here's coral springs hello
hey Neil how you doing okay sir Greg just moved back down here from gamesville back down the coral springs I just started listening to your show we don't get it up there I appreciate I'm enjoying it so far
basically the most I know about the law what I see on TV on the on the movies but you know what I personally think is and I would like to hear your
standpoint on it is you know by the time you're able to run all the the get information from get a run up by the mayor got to get it this by the time you know they get
everything approved seems like a 30 done it's already over with them by that time it's too late what do you think that's any got you run up by the mayor
we know the guys in there we know he's doing this we did we need a search war we know he's got this going on he's selling guns out of there but you know we can't
just go in the house and arrest them because we know he's doing it we got to run all this stuff out yeah like what do you think about that and they never stopped him from
you know breaking down the doors very often by the way in the wrong house never stopped and before breaking the doors down the way they thought there were
drugs being the right right right right honestly I agree with you 100% why why can't we just do that like how many years ago was it when
when you were able to just go in house you know something's wrong and then you can go take care of it you have to run it by a mayor
by by all the people all the judicial people I mean what kind of that's ridiculous that's it that's yondo they probably had to call Tom Bo that before they could
get you know permission to go into motel last night I don't I don't I just don't believe that I mean I think it's ridiculous but I appreciate it I'm enjoying your
shit on keep going okay great thanks thanks anything five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line here's
Pemberg Pines hello yes sir you know Jerry Spence you don't like the great philosophy Jerry Spence he's a piece of
turd baby he's so he's you know something I've got sucked into buying his OJ book after the other eight million OJ books they were
written it was the biggest most ponderous piece of pathetic garbage I've ever written my life he owned any more clothing than that
now he just has that one and you know something Buffalo Bob left in that outfit remember when Buffalo Bob died a year or two ago he left in that
outfit that's the only thing he's got to wear listen me I agree with you heart of sound of you know banning the gun shows but you know
unfortunately it seems like it's cast out of the bag you know it's like 200 million guns floating around what do you do about that I
it's just it's like banging your head against the well I'm not saying we're going to solve the problem you're right the horses way out of the
bomb but at least you at least you make an effort at least you start somewhere yeah yeah it's just it's really and especially that he's a
salt weapons why should any why does any citizen in this country need to own an assault weapon I can tell you why because you may have to kill 30
deer in one minute so you can take out a lot of deer yeah yeah that's true very important when it was deer start shooting back man they're
dangerous they got good aim of course the media is great so you know Kennedy Jr. I think you would think he was president of the world
who went on with that yeah that was really important stuff yeah you know ponderous man what are you going to do okay pal later see you
in a real country someday sir because guess what this ended five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18 to

exactly no one cares everyone's parties are all screwed up like you said this is a big joke guy calls me from highly the
amounts to the audience that he's immune he doesn't care anymore he couldn't give a crap left that's great how do you baby loser yeah um you know I just want to you know make a comment
you already alluded to it earlier uh you know if those parties are screwed up you know you got to share us off it's arresting people out of these
swing clubs that hey they're doing what they want to do in private but you know let's let's let all the gun dealers out on the street and let them do what they want right what's
going on with this country I mean I'm telling you I'm only 30 years old but I'll tell you I'm pretty concerned I mean I'm to a point where you know I have a girlfriend she talks about having a family
when we get married and that I don't know if I want to bring kids into this I don't blame you it's crazy it's totally nuts it's to the point where you know I
I've I've mentioned it and I used to kid about it but now it's trying to become uh maybe uh a reality I'm just thinking about picking up and going
to an island or something there you go I'm telling you but uh that's all I got to say I'll see it real real disturbing I mean that's really
horrible I'll see it Barbados take it easy somewhere how about Jamaica I heard that's a toilet that's the American way I'm sorry
it's all the shit you're not going to get it just like any other toilet also works already low price get the second item for half price
what what are we doing and I don't want to get I don't want to get your nervous now but what is it that we're doing now I mean we just like falling apart of the
seams we're almost done almost time to say bye bye have a nice day don't get shot between out of tomorrow morning I mean and all of a sudden it's like what was
that the spot's all the stuff when they're not supposed to oh you don't mean to say we have a faulty piece of equipment here do you
know the piece of Greg read crap a beastly crap that doesn't work like every morning when we come in we have to reset the
phone and reset our lives because everything was bought at Cresky's and I got the Empire sale that's correct sir thank you
anyway who the hell wanted to hear that name I wanted to hear it I think it fit right in with all these uh you
buck teeth the goofballs running around straight out of the hills I said set them all back to Georgia sent them to the
Carter clan all up there in Georgia they got blow each other's brains out here's a mobile in Miami hello hello nil yes sir how you doing sir okay first of all
I like to come in you for helping the colony to speak up on an issue like this I couldn't believe that last call I was saying that he was
totally insensitive to it yeah he's in high alias so he's lost all of his sensitivity I guess right
you know I like to make a comment in regards to that um I don't know if you heard it but just to the
relaunches of the kid 14 year old I had read that story the right at the beginning of the show today sir
is that playing with playing with a 22 caliber rifle right and um it just goes to show that you you mentioned it earlier I
don't know what it is we're going to do all or what is going to take what they just got to flat out outlaw firearms
right I'm with you I'm an extremist when it comes to gun control I don't want to see any citizens walking around with guns there
isn't anybody I mean you know people depending on their job if they're like with a DEA or something like that but I mean
oh that's a bad example though but people who need a gun are most seriously but unless it has something to do with a
life in that situation with the occupation right no citizens ought to be walking around with a gun and if they can't
give a I don't care what you say there is almost nobody in this country who is killing a game in order to survive
you know in order to make their dinner that night at the bunch of bullcrap exactly well so I just want to let you know
that I'm the hand you agree with you 100% and as far as all of these sick goals who want to bash their rod is
because he's got the frick the flipping balls is stand up for something that's right screw you all
come to flip this okay see flip them the bird five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line
and that's right bed wedding panty capitulator socialist bag yeah okay and what else
here's Miami hello I want to command you for the work that you're doing keep on screaming about this because no one else is
yeah I feel like that caller from highly I want to make a comment on that and I he was a genius he was a rocket scientist
oh man I move away from highly of take a bit get away from people like that
so one of the responsibilities of the media is that not allow it to be shown so much to de-centralize people like that
and I can't think for themselves yeah but you don't understand I mean they got 24 hours
of data for love now we have all these 24 hour news channels and so as a result they're just waiting for something like this
I wouldn't be surprised if maybe they're involved in it sometimes you know
yeah they plotted or something they make it happen they're probably getting Bernie charmer to go you know
they're probably like got him locked into a room somewhere and trying to make him a crazy
and going to give him a couple of oozes and see what he can do right well they're there before the cops do it and I wouldn't doubt it
the cops get there I wouldn't doubt it or one last thing oh well no that's pretty much it you keep doing a good job
okay thanks thanks stay out of high alia by the way that's a good message for all you people out there stay out of high alia
not bad enough they got wrong Martinez over there he'll beat the crap audio that's what Hank said
here's a mobile in Miami hello how you doing nail pretty good sir
latest trend young who deals with fanny packs concealed firearm license in there and a gun
if they're carrying it over their shoulder and you a lot of people have probably seen this they're packing heat they're packing it
yeah for what reason you know what I mean ridiculous they have a young guy still they have a red
hanky and they're left the rear pocket too that they really got to be that means they really got a dangerous weapon
yeah you'll probably have people calling in about that because I've seen it all the time they're packing it
huh they're packing it and they're carrying the little fanny packs the little gay fanny packs right over the shoulder
oh boy thanks for the good thanks for the warning there's no warning for all you people out there to be on the lookout

oh thank you there's another one of your people here's a mobile in coral springs hello mobile in coral springs
hey you don't kneel okay sir how you doing I just moved out from New York and meet my friends just to receive a few free
marlin tickets is it worth going or not let's go to a Fort Lauderdale hello
hey Neil yes sir let's start with these buildings that are run by like the city of Fort Lauderdale like the war memorial auditorium
that runs gun shows by monthly it seems like I mean let's go after these I say gun shows stop right now that's what I say no more gun shows
this is insanity it's craziness and you hit on a good point early in the show about that sterile where's Dr. William Shockley when you need him
for sterilization uh-huh remember that in the early 70s yeah all right Neil okay thank you I think Dr. William Shockley is probably hanging out with this guy a
viewford pusser whatever this guy's name is here's a mobile in Hollywood hello mobile in Hollywood
Neil yes sir how are you sir okay first of all I think it's a majority of it's claimed on the police because unless there's money to be generated
from these criminals they don't go after them if it's a guy show a pot or something they got 20 cops they don't try to
set the guy up and then do a reverse thing and all that but a guy that they said this guy had a a soul charge with a deadly weapon
yeah and he was looking to do eight months they don't say nobody looking for this guy you know I mean if he was a drug dealer I'm just saying nobody looking for him
well they he was on probation right and they was supposed to go to jail for eight months and he didn't show up and you know why didn't they pick him up then
you know what I mean there to hear that I didn't hear that story I heard that on the news this morning yeah and uh what's the one good morning America
all of us on air must be true yeah well you know no but anyhow I mean you know you start there the cops are so busy worried about you know there's a
million people in jail for you know buying a quarter a week from one of their buddies but we're going to maybe go into a swing club or right going to a
swing club victim was crime swing me in the wrong direction yeah you know and then of course don't don't forget the prostitutes in the
john I'm going to tell you if we took away all these silly we and for you know crime police invented crimes right we took all
of a long time and you can walk the streets exactly this guy's old enough to spend his money wearing once this girl's old enough to do what she wants with her
body and we can you know the biggest joke in the world victim of crimes and that's where they spend 90% of their time you know the police trying to
get more people were generating a lot of money yeah well thank god the cops aren't running no prostitution ring I'm sorry forgot about that
thank god they're not hoeing out no 60 year old girls down there in Kendall and hi alia that would be bad and of course
especially if they were their own best customers 20 past noon at 560 WQ we got that Marlon game coming up all
boys or anything we can do about that no damn it although today I'm pretty excited about it so young is too young
and I'm going out
24 55 50 WQM so anyway it's a Nazi area nation nation goofball that's what this guy is beautiful beautiful
and I'm going to be a little bit more beautiful and I'm going to be a little bit more beautiful and I'm going to be a little bit more beautiful
you know you were right about I think MSNBC has had this on since the first shot oh the MSNBC they are they feeding frenzy specialists
I just heard something maybe you can help me out with it yes sir the guy goes in and shoots over 70 shots and shoots those poor kids over a hundred yeah they may be calling it a hate crime as opposed to what
as opposed to a regular old run of the mill garden variety crime in other words that's why that whole thing about hate crime is so idiotic it's so stupid I mean what difference is it make what you call it a crime is a crime let's start
prosecuting people and put them away for a long time what if it doesn't make what you call it if I'm in other words I'm not a Nazi so if I wouldn't did that then it would have been less heinous
less heinous well anyway I look forward to the Marlon's yeah but you are please okay
goodbye we got only five minutes till I pregame talk about a crime talk about a heinous I mean heinous here's a mobile in Miami hello
Neil yes sir hey I usually agree with everything you say but I got a problem with the gun control yeah okay okay if you take away guns from citizens
uh-huh for the only people who are going to have guns are the decisions criminals yeah that's it and and our civilians going to protect
ourselves if some criminal breaks into a house tonight with a gun and rob this how many people do you know to get to that protect themselves
because they have a gun in their homes how many of you read about three well no my father has a gun so many have to chase them when I have a house with it
yeah well that's here for dad okay all right go Marlon okay always a Marlon fan no wonder okay now we understand so you're under a lot of stress and pressure
that explains it okay where we going I don't want to step on that Marlon thing because you're in fact let's play a little clip to show you this five game winning streak
man it's been dynamite Joe Angel bottom of the seventh last night all right and lots more that to come in just a couple of minutes
here's a North Miami Beach hello for this phone really blows North Miami Beach yeah North Miami Beach sounds like you
yes sounds like me hey listen I have to tell you that I I spent almost a year up in northern Michigan I like to pose my
anthems off and I'm glad to be back here listening to you because you're ready up there stock really blows yeah yeah okay but I got a little
maybe a little solution to this gun control business they're always good drinking a lot of that any freeze when it's real cold up there in Northern Michigan
you know oh yeah I don't do it every time yeah you can have some more money inside yeah right yeah okay but look here if some of that
antsy freeze let them let them sell all the guns they want yeah but if they didn't have no bullets for the guns
there you go that's right guns don't kill people bullets do there you go don't kill people bullets do let's give everybody
all the guns you want just know more bullets here's Miami hello oh Neil yes sir okay I can understand lots of bows just no arrows yes sir
I can understand you being an extremist however we both know that being an extremist on any issue is sometimes self-defeating yeah let me
take care of it but I'm just not an extremist on just about any issue yeah well I'm usually not either but in this case see I feel like if you take an extreme
position then maybe you might like to take make a little progress because if you just take a middle of the road position they've been
tried to bet forever and not anything happens I understand that and I can agree with you on many sides about that but let's try this everybody that once
absolutely no guns and anybody's hand yeah I think they should have should should have two signs made up one for their home that says
absolutely no guns in this home and one for their automobile that says the driver carries no guns whatsoever yeah
with those in both places for a beer and see if that changes people's minds meaning what well who do you think
how does anybody who's going to break into your home know if you have a weapon or not how do they know exactly they don't so so then what's the point
so let's put a sign up so how do they know how do they know that you do have one if they're going to think about breaking into your house sir do
those people have a sign that says warning we got all kinds of ammunition in here in hand grenades etc.
You're right I never saw house like that sir ha ha ha ha ha yeah great material idiot moron jackass simpleton oh he's not an NRA guy no I'm not sure
he just an ordinary pedestrian crazy guy that's all we've probably got a very tiny penis and he loves that phallic symbol baby
he's probably rubbing it right now and his gun too oh my god we got to get here for some stupid baseball game
hey listen to marlins baby that's where the big money is you believe it
