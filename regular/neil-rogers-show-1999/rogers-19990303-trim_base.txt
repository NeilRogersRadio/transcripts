Hot,
back but they have no comeback and to make up stories about what is it what
did you think about that beat those bm buttons and about that top-of-the-stereo
trade unless you think about now first of all I was the one from the beginning
I liked the top-of-the-stereo trade and I said that Mark Parrish are allegedly
was a hell of a player and he turned out to be I never knocked that trade now
when it comes to stew barns and Marty Strocka I didn't hear Geltie say
nothing about that and I didn't hear him to respond but what I said yesterday
morning because he can't respond because again he got it wrong about Theo
Flurry and playing on the first line in the power play for Colorado and
blah blah blah you know just talking a lot talking up the storm and of
course when he's got other people sitting in that room and don't know nothing
about what he's discussing it's easy to get a free pass on it including the
audience like that jackass who I know is listening right now listening right
now that I heard the call oh yeah well no other sports station in America do
we have to listen to some fag in midday pocket fag hockey talk now I want you
to stop and think about that do we have to listen and of course here's another
one of these guys who could quote you chapter and verse everything that I say
on this radio show and you know he's listening right now and when it comes to
fag's pal I got news for there's plenty of facts in fact madditch was tell me
was down here a couple of weeks ago tell me that when he was playing for the
dolphins there were like at least a half a dozen guys on the team that were
screaming fags
and a lot of guys used to shower like one end I don't want to say which end
air be sport pal where everywhere everywhere you go there's fags I hate to
break the news yet and you don't have to leave this building by the way there's
lots of us there's fags all over this building
we're up to our all right no we're up to our back in fags well I got my sole water
here blocking my finger okay but jody man I'll tell you see if you want to stick
with information if you want to respond to what I'm talking about fine but you
can't do it so again let's make an attack he's on the air begging for people
looking graduate I didn't even know it was my 23rd anniversary I came back
Monday from vacation forgot all about it and Georgia course it set up all these
contrived deals here and they bring down the cake in the party in the parking lot
and the yeah I'm on the air begging for cost 23 years yeah yeah must be a
money or 23 years in Miami gully because I don't have any talent because I
don't know what I'm talking about because the audience out there is not
entertained all those ratings all those numbers that come in I have the
fix in in Belfield Maryland I know I have a big in up there I know somebody
there I'm paying somebody off they're all bogus it's all a bunch of bull crap
so it must be pretty desperate there in the morning that they were huckin
a tronicky and instead of talking about the fact instead of giving up
opinions but and of course like I said the other day you can do that in this
town because they only deal with the personalities like that jack asked to call
the I had a body guy you know back down I'm so proud you didn't back down all
only dealing with personalities not with factor with substance or knowledge or
information because most of the people in this town don't have any knowledge
when it comes to sports or much of any other topic you picked a topic and they're
going we'll live it like that that's just the nature of this town so he can go
on here and make up all kinds of stories and suck Brian Marie's ass until there's
just nothing left in it okay and you know life goes on and I still stay you
know Marty Strock has got 29 goals two bars has got 19 oh yeah Pittsburgh's he's
been on the outs with him he's got 19 that's two more than anybody on a
Panthers it got so far by the way Brian Marie's done some good things he's made a
lot of mistakes a lot of bad mistakes okay so you try to be objective not just
a professional ass sucker like Yelda who's on the payroll so you want your
on the payroll for an organization that immediately you have no credibility
left none zero so no matter what you say like it takes us back a year ago a
year ago now at that horrendous time when they had that the coach show with
BM in the morning on Tuesday mornings how could anybody forget those days and if
you weren't we've actually had Christina Moore had to come in and be the referee
the pivot man to screen the calls to make sure that there were no tough calls
coming in for the thin skin BM because you just couldn't take it so I mean you
know it's just personalities it doesn't interest me what you know what your
opinion is with me they're showing anything like that but talk back give some
information know what you're talking about do some homework I saw the Philadelphia
Montreal game last night it's entirety I saw the bees are going up some more
greasy goals and Philadelphia fold and which I love in the third period losing
four to one I saw that did you see it guilty here's a mobile implantation
hello yes sir yeah I don't know how anyone can listen to that show in the
morning anyway all they have is commercials on it yeah it's all spots radio
yeah it's it's awful yeah but can I change the subject what do you mean
change the subject we don't have a subject whatever you want is the subject okay
I'm not bored by it which I probably want to talk about the atkins died from
oh yeah can you tell me how it reduces cholesterol if you eat all that red meat
and dairy products I haven't got any idea sir that's like asking me how when
you put something in your mouth does it go through the intestine to the colon
and come out these you know rectum it just works so I talk asking when you have
a bad splitting headache and you take two aspirin do the doctors know how it
works no does anybody know how it really works no but you know so you can
either sit there and you know this is like the guy with a religion crap again
asking questions that we don't have answers for I don't know maybe even Bob
Atkins doesn't know it just so happens that for a lot of us it works like a
miracle so we don't ask any stupid questions in fact I'm getting a
screen you my great-just from here in him or from that helium one of the
other just just unbelievable these people don't ask too many questions okay
just like the Pope says don't ask any questions give us the guy day money and
stop asking the questions okay just do it like Nancy Reagan said or whoever
the hell said that the people would have Nike thing before the the guy see
even they got a swish on the for their logo what do you think of that all these
professional athletes running around with a swish on your thing I am I
wanted to have a purple little handbag but to have a swish on your thing yeah
that's what I mean just just like Al Goldstein told you believe me when I tell
you sports it's a gay club you moron once a guy showered together patting
each other on the ass it's a goddamn gay club so you can go you know fag fag
this great so what's the point fits right in here that's why they brought me
on this station they said what better the guys got big ratings a lot of
sponsors brings in a lot of money and he's a faggot he fits right in on a
sports station it's a fag thing and I said okay and here we are taking some
serious ass did that guy call by the way is he on there that guy won't call and
you know he's a listen right now call another show every time somebody calls a
show and what it wants to take you with something like well Hank said yes
that's out what do I always say call him up and talk to him about it
spineless jellyfish cowards I have no problem with default but default is
somewhat intimidated that's like laws or wait wait wait wait wait intimidated by
what Jeff what do you have that I'm intimidated by well I don't know you kind of
turn red when I come into studio why would I turn red when you come in here just
because I'm looking at a guy that's trying to warm his way under the show I'm not
warming my way I don't want your dog you know what this goes back let's clear
the air right now Jeff river yeah back at the aladreem's former radio station
when you came on the air on Neil Rogers show and trash virtually everybody that
worked at the station I got the feeling that you were sending a message to
Neil and trying to work your way around going through conventional systems
that about getting a job on the air that you were saying that I was sandbag in
your chances of getting on the radio that's what I kept hearing from people
that knew you personally and instead of saying it to me you're running around
saying oh well this deforestation is the reason I'm not getting a job that's not
true that's not true but anyway I want to move on you saying I'm jealous of
what you're doing and not saying what is that you're kind of showing say that no
I'm what I am saying though is this I just feel sometimes you kind of get a
little uncomfortable I'm intimidated by you who wouldn't be uncomfortable with a
guy that's trying to stab you in the back are you Aaron like this okay ten
fifteen and five sixty WQM did that guy call yet by the way the spineless sports
fan mr. macho what is big telephone stuck up his ass didn't call got a
strange your piece of mail fact it's only been back from vacation three days
already had some real bizarre mail here's the letter from Ann in Boiton Beach
and envelope and on the outside it's got a picture of it says L O V E or at least
it looks like that and of course I guess that's what it is because underneath
it says Jerry Steven 55 who skywrites messages above Volkerrton says God told
him to fill the sky with my word and that's Virgin Mary named his plane and
there it says love in the sky the sky writer is writing love in the sky so I
thought well this must be you know some cryptic anti-religious I open up the
envelope and inside with no writing or anything on it is an Easter card with a
picture of Jesus I assume that is it's either that or Charlton Heston with a
bad outfit as an Easter gift you and your intentions will remember during the
Easter octave of masses Easter Sunday to low Sunday to be celebrated in the
Holy Land made the blessings of the risen Christ remain with you always Jesus is
Lord and then it says Alalooia Christ is risen and on the bottom it says well
thank you so much and in Boiton Beach and May oh God bless you too sweetheart
Dusty Springfield is dead oh Christ cancer age of 60 I scoured my whole
collection back here I got some at home I have to bring in tomorrow I thought
for sure we had some here no Dusty Springfield that why you think you might
have one in there oh wishing and hoping I only want to be with you I'm ever
playing I only want to be with you because I remember it's saying over and over
again that was the one record that somebody must have held a gun to everybody's
head and said you got to record this in under two minutes because you could hear
the orchestra and Dusty they're like singing so fast and faster in fact like we
got to get to sober with the buzz is gonna go on
so no more Dusty Springfield than it she was okay she was no Ann Murray but here's
a key Largo hello hey good morning Neil same genre I think yes sir I got a
medical theory on Goldie's voice yes I think all that fucking is crush's voice
box that could be it he's got that squeaky voice maybe as a crushed
learns hey tonight if you're a channel flippin channel surfing whatever you
call it I'll be talking to you tonight sir yeah oh you got to record it have a
smiley on that BET having the grease man on there yeah yeah and he's been
trying to explain what's going on he's gonna have rock Newman on there too
there's nobody in the song for audience knows who the grease man is they have no
interest in that story George said he brought it up last week nobody talked
about it then I mentioned it on Monday and I thought everybody would have an
opinion on that the guy makes a you know we're very tasteless comment but never
less you know yeah I think he can he gets fired for making a joke I forgot I was
in America right what you are in America that's the problem yeah have you seen
Pee we herman and Goldie in the same plot yeah yeah that's it now we're
sitting right between them okay have a great day pal open line is powered to
indeed five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on a mobile one line no
comment on that the other grease man gets fired because he made a tasteless
comment it all by the way somebody today will call and tell us what hip hop is
because that bitch what's your name a Lorna Dune or whatever her name is couldn't
sing around about paper sec it's eighty two Grammy Awards as they hottest
beats out the back street boys who by the way they'll be on with Shania Twain
tonight I won't see that either and Monica Lewinsky night anybody gonna be
watching that no I had to break the news to you Tom jikka see Tom jikka you know
Tom I don't know I think I think that bald spot there must be something that's
go whether you're here it's going I know what that's happened to me go through
this whole song of the dance about how much money she's gonna make an ABC is
walk into the bank all the ratings they're gonna get raising the spot rates up
for that barba wall wall interview tonight and they showed on CNN this morning I
think the polls are like sixty two percent of the public will not be watching
and thirty six percent that said they would now thirty six percent you got to
understand is a gigantic rating if that many people do watch it it's a humongous
raining but everything is relative so still the overwhelming majority of us
even if I weren't going to hockey game would I watch Monica tonight no I would
not watch that disgusting fat pig talking to that speech defected bitch all
and by the way speaking of bitch date line last night did you see that by any
chance story about the intercourse you know this is America with all the lawyers
we got people suing everybody eighteen-year-old girl sued Ma for parental
whatever the hell they call it cuz she a slafter and you know be there a
little bit cuz she stayed away for twenty four hours and came home the next day
and opened up a mouth and called her and called her something like that
fucking bitch yeah that's exactly what it was and I thought boy too bad
it's free barely couldn't get on that one because she said that's
fucking bitch and yes what thank God the jury I figured where the hell this was
where was it somewhere in Michigan in Michigan and the is Ellen Brighton
Michigan right outside Detroit and the jury said not guilty let's get involved
into an important stuff let's bring oh Jay back for one more chance to fry his
ass and let's talk about something important but jica says how ironic that this
scandal will end with one last lie being exposed everyone is sick and tired of
this affair isn't this what you hear everywhere the ratings for tonight
special prove otherwise well again Tom what I'm trying to say to you is that at
least two thirds of us don't want to hear one more word about it but when you
got a tour to the people that are obsessed and they pointed out by the way
that the republicans in the CNN survey this morning the republicans are the
ones will be watching because they just can't get enough dirt they just
waiting to find out one more word and then of course we'll get into this rape
thing and then we'll find out that he's got a purple penis and it'll I mean
just there's no end to it the republican penis police that guy calling yet
by the way I did he rolled the whole goddamn thing I can't believe it
it's only the third of March and Greg Reed shows us face in the other room
didn't you tell him what I said yesterday he heard you third of March we got
three over three and a half years to go he shows up here and I give me a look
I've been having such a good time this week I've been in heaven come back in
this morning you get ripped by guilty first of all which is getting ripped a bit
like it's like getting ripped by a homeless bum under an overpass somewhere and
then Greg Reed comes in here looking like his usual cell here's a mobile
in hallowed ill hello
yes sir happy twenty third oh don't do that y'all you get upset about important
stuff
what did I watch tonight the hockey game or monica with the with the cigar action
forget about it yeah I'm gonna be at the hockey game so I really have no
options why do they keep saying this security's up to the game is out for the
season they don't even know what the hell they're talking about who said he's
out for the season where do you hear that I thought they were actually said on
the news last night I was watching the DSB and they said it got a sprain
the out for out for the definite wrong no not out for the season out indefinitely
means out for a few games they don't want to be back not out for the season
I'm gonna say okay get it right see see this is what goes on on this radio station
twenty hours a day people who think they know something about sports both the
ones on the air and the ones calling in uh... sharing this information with
each other
the old fairy is out for the season is the out no he's out with a sprain
that he got late in the game in the uh... uh... collar at all Edmonton game on
Monday night
sprained the he'll be out tonight and if you were watching last night which I'm
sure this guy was not on a small dish filling in Montreal Montreal is playing
Colorado or whatever game they got on next week Colorado and somebody and
they were saying whether the will be back for that game is still debatable
because he's out indefinitely meaning he'll be out there like pop out
burry was
it was not for the season but they didn't know exactly when he was going to be
back and it was a similar injury I guess
but these people calling on a station there isn't one percent of these people
who got any idea what they're talking about
if it's unbelievable
which is why you can have a punk like jelody on here that that that that that
that that that you know talking crap and they're just out there sucking it up
we can put a goddamn monkey like you know gorillas in the mist how do you like
that story you can do yesterday by the way huh
i can just hear all jolson singing or was it any counter bye bye to see good by
what a nice story that is just like an oj deal
just like an oj deal with machetes they just brutally uh... you know
killed a people just uh... you know gorillas in the mist
and i'm not going to say anything beyond that okay because i heard about that
grease man's story
so i'm not going to say nothing about gorillas in the mist
but did you see that on the news
here's highly a hello
boogarong maricon yes
felice anniversary
grassis
and you'll happen a verse reum sorry i have to call Wednesday uh... but
it's only
when did by the also the only chance to have to uh... get on the phone
yeah
you know quick question whatever happened to date alberts and
he's in the west coast
on the west coast of California
now
all right i was driving out of the home right now uh... repenting for sending us
homontious yesterday
it is also ever apologize for the health
might mail
uh... what a jackass
yet he you know that that's difficult to stand in the course nobody what makes
anybody accountable in the town
i'm the only person who tries to do it and it never happened
people say all these things and they never live up to
unbelievable to that that goes on here at this station but nevertheless you
know there's only a very few of us that really uh... appreciate you and uh...
like i've been telling people when you you retire that really gonna be crying
for new waters

from people that are going to be watching monica tonight
let's hear from some of those right wingers that just can't get enough that
just can't get satiated with all this monica crap
you know i would seriously i cannot envision i mean we already had the
monica video tapes
during that last weekend with the impeachment hearings in the senate we
already had those
right there on your tube
how much more how could it it's just like
uh... i think it's tomorrow is the tomorrow that the book comes out i do believe
tomorrow
why would anybody in fact that was uh...
even worse than the tv thing under pull on cnn this morning i think it was
like seventy nine or eighty percent of the people said
no way they would not buy the book why would anybody invest money to read
to hear the same crap all over again from this slot
which is exactly what she isn't of course the media will never say that
can't stand that
because she's been so wounded in a life has been so destroyed
that nobody would ever heard of this bitch
nobody in the universe would have ever heard her now she's a celebrity she's
on a bc
she's doing interviews with the bbc she's writing book she's gonna make millions
of dollars
even catty will have never made that kind of money for given little head
i'll turn it that right now
the rangers got
nearby
is
from
The time is here.
When the time is here,
very hard with no
station,
just getting mud for the duck.
Boys of the rainbow,
we just get in that time.
White man has a heart.
His friend,
he's the Gamer,
the man,
the man,
the old B-tiddle.
When they find out he's been
sick strickel,
watch your face away.
I'm down the board,
you're gay.
Jordan and gay.
Who's there?
Jordan and gay.
Where?
Yes.
You know the reason,
that laughter can look too bad.
As the baby stands above,
and it sucks just like a hoover.
It's been over for a guy
company's head.
It's been that he likes to home.
He's racing out the home with
fashion and so he's looking at
him wearing red puffs.
The fans won't be dimpled
when they find out he's been
sick strickel,
watch your face away.
Oh, a massive board is gay.
Oh my god.
Jordan and gay.
Who's there?
Jordan and gay.
Don't touch me there.
It's living.
century three is last,
50-22 am.
The rest of you are dead.
We're doing good now.
I hope he's going to walk in the
middle.
The drags and drags.
That's especially for that
pose that I called it
a fucking golden hat this morning
and morning show.
Radio, the catalyst for the
flag, radio and drag hobby
documents in.
Hey, is this from radio
and records today?
Just handed to me by Greg Reed
who came down and spoiled my day.
Doug Greaseman,
track lots is because I saw him.
Doug Greaseman, track will hold a
press conference at the downtown
Washington Church today to
apologize and express his
humility spokesman,
Rock Newman, told R&R today.
Track was fired from
Infinity Classic Rocker,
WARFM last week for an
on air racist remark associated
with the dragging death of a
black man in Texas.
Newman said, track wants to use
this opportunity to become a
better person and that his
desire to get another job is
secondary.
Right.
Who wants to use this
opportunity to suck up to
those dark,
complex folks in Washington
and said, I didn't really
need it anymore than I
made that comment about Martin
Luther Coon Day or whatever
it was he said.
Which brings us back to that
story in Uganda by the way.
I mean, what does it say
about that?
And of course, hundreds of
thousands, I mean this
particular group of
rebels as they call them.
That's a nice word.
Lunatics, Stone Age barbarians,
hundreds of thousands of
their countrymen have been
killing each other for
the last couple of years.
And I think that's why they
are not just, they're
different tribes.
Oh, I noticed they did not
do the icky shuffle.
Did you see any of that footage
with the Atootsie?
When they were playing
bi-bi-tootsie, goodbye?
And they were shaking their
booty.
Rams with Tootsie?
Yeah, they were shaking that
little line.
So maybe it's a cultural
thing.
I don't know what that's all
about.
Why does anybody, why does
any person in its right mind
go to Africa to go to the
rainforest, to go on these
safaris, or what do they
go there for?
To see the gorillas.
Here's Weston.
Hello.
You better go to church
and apologize.
Hey, Nail.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, you don't have to go to
Africa to see the gorillas.
Yeah.
Let me, I need to get your
personal opinion on a problem
on having to work.
Just remember what happened to
Howard Coastel, man.
I know. Well, I'm not on
any position where they can,
you know, fire me for.
How much I'm not working
around.
I'm not working.
So now the garrison.
I have this guy,
well, I should I am working
on this B.S. thing about that.
There's a guy that sits
in front of me at work.
Yeah.
It's got to be 400 pounds on,
like on a light day.
Right.
He wears these white shorts
about every day of the week.
Yeah.
They got it.
They're not the cover.
I would say Joe Robby stayed
in easy.
Okay. They're huge.
Where's a pupton?
He sits in front of me.
Yeah, when you're that big
because I know about that.
You wear a pupton.
Let me tell you what he does.
And if I hope you haven't had a
big breakfast.
He.
Yeah.
He leans over his desk
and gives me a shot of that big
carcass of his.
And he's got a little brown spot.
And he's got a different spot.
You've got to understand that when you're that fat
and believe me, I've never been, you know,
400 pounds, but I've been real fat at times.
When you're that fat,
you do a lot of seeping.
I mean, that's the most,
yeah, because I'm
I think you go on a sinker.
Because that's it.
What do you think?
Do you think I should tell him?
Tell him what.
Well, you got crap on your ass
or something like that.
Well, where else would you expect to have it?
Oh, it's on the hair.
It's better than being like
a guilty and having it on your tongue.
We have an open line of day two
and Howard five six seven oh five six
six.
Why do you think they call that guy
B M anyway?
Huh?
That's what they call him.
See, I'd like like I said before,
if you're going to,
if you're going to take shot,
at least get your information right,
guilty, at least know what you're talking about.
And then Greg Reed comes down here and says to me,
oh, that was good radio this morning.
That was great radio.
The big controversy between me and guilty.
That's great radio.
Yeah.
Look at you already strangling himself
with his goddamn headset cord.
That was great radio.
See that?
And he means it.
He believes it.
That's the best part.
He believes that Geldy belongs on the ear.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
How you doing?
Okay, sir.
I really enjoy your show at first time,
caller.
All right.
And the worst thing is the worst team.
And I'll tell you that Geldy is good.
That Geldy is so paranoid and so thin skin to get.
So insecure, that deep hole.
And he's got those cushes, but the guy really knows.
You learn nothing about sports on that radio show.
You know, they just blabber and blabber Joe Rose
with the social life.
Geldy, Mr.
Yeah, Joe, Joe wants it all.
You know, if all these guys are getting in, you know,
how they do with the ladies, the ladies that business.
It's just a little ponderous.
Yeah, but I have a thing that when a grease man takes over
mornings here in a couple of weeks, because that's why Greg
really came down here to give me the news.
I wasn't supposed to be.
I love when he knocked on Geldy, because he's a young punk trying to make a name
and I've always thought he'd be.
There are young guys in sports like Bug.
I mean, he's a much too fat, but Bug at least is a broadcaster.
He usually knows what he's talking about.
And now that they separated him at the hip from Christina Moore
and they got the two away from each other,
now Bug is developing into like a real talent.
But Geldy is between the voice and the suction factor.
There's nothing there.
Yeah, since when does he, Joe Hockey?
Now, I see him on Wyoming now.
Yeah.
Well, I mean, why don't you get on there?
Oh, yeah.
He's 23 years old.
He was around.
Because he's a suckle.
He's on the payroll of the organization.
Just like the stuff you read in the newspapers,
like yesterday, more than they're quoting Robbie Niedermar.
Oh, well, we got to do this.
And we got to do that.
Here's the guy that never played one full game, 60 minutes,
in his entire career with this organization.
And they're always taking quotes from him about what they got to do this
and they got to do that.
When is he going to start doing that?
He's a guy who's got a dogman.
And he's got a town, but he's got no heart.
Right.
There you go.
So why are they always quoting him, though?
Yeah, Lindsey's got all heart, but he's got zero talent.
Probably because he's the only one on a team that'll talk to that fat microsoil anymore.
Yeah, I love your show, Neil, and keep knocking Geldy.
And have a great day.
That voice, man.
Okay, see you.
Goodbye.
All the nice days.
Two open lines and Broward.
I'm going to, you know, something.
I think I'm going to do it the rest of the year.
I'm going to do in that voice.
If he can do it, why not?
Can I do it?
Two open lines and Broward, five, six, seven, oh five, 60.
And pound five, 60 on the mobile one line.
Come on.
Let's hear it.
I have fired up and pitched off for tonight's game or what?
No.
I mean, if he can do what, how can't we?
We...
Slushing down, my dad, or what?
From the people that brought you, maybe last, it's a brand new exciting game show on pornography central.
Make me come.
And here's your host, Dean's Mountain Dan.
Hello, you know, and what's more than purpose on your host, Dave Mountain Dan.
Today we're going to find out whether our four stars can make Rebecca of Donnie Brooks farm come.
If not going to be easy because Rebecca informed us earlier that she's only had sex with farm animals.
Round baby kin, let's meet off our four stars.
Wilk the still.
Wow, it's just Maui.
I get that's what they need by big foot.
Anyway, Wilk the still.
Rebecca of Donnie Brooks says, make me come.
This is Maui, maybe some of time.
Oh, Mr. Ed, Mr. Ed.
Oh!
Yeah!
I don't believe it.
Rebecca, you sure you're not a guy.
It only suits you.
Eleven seconds, the jump.
Oh, it's down to you, Dave.
Take me, we want to get that firewall over here.
Make me come only on pornography central to an in-next week for celebrity guest, our Monica Lewinsky.
Oh, you can do it in the night.
You'll be watching.
Most of you will be watching that crack tonight.
You don't want to admit it.
You'll be watching.
You'll be peeking out of the corner.
I'm 10.45.
You know, the one thing I would like to know before this day is out, what are we going to do about these gorillas in our midst?
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Good morning.
Yes sir.
Great.
Hey, call the wish you had to have the anniversary before you get to that.
Too late.

Because if I started in on the way I feel about doctors today, I would go till midnight,
nonstop.
I'd never take a breath.
In fact, most of you could go to one of doctors, they'll make sure you'll never take
another breath.
Here's Hollywood, hello.
Hey, how you doing?
Okay, sir.
Uh, a grease man used to be on a radio station here in Florida.
Did he really?
Yeah, he was on with the Hick as a one-up injection bill.
Oh, that's right.
The eighth.
Yeah, you're right.
Yeah.
Yeah, he was, he was grosser than he is now.
I don't see what the big deal is.
I don't get it.
They just got a real bunch of sensitive dark people up there in Washington, I guess, for
those sensitive humor.
Hey, I got a question for you.
Why do these people that own these commercial accounts do their own voiceovers or whatever
you want to call them?
One word.
Ego.
Is that what it is?
Yeah.
Because they sound like El Dorco.
Right.
Ego.
Okay, you take care.
Okay, you too.
Yeah, he's right.
A lot of people insist on doing their own spots.
We got many of those people here in town like, like King Paul.
Isn't King Paul dead, by the way?
Because I see those TV spots and his, uh, kin, his daughter and the husband, whatever they
are doing the spot.
And actually, some of those spots are kind of cute, even though they look real dorky,
just like King Paul, the glasses and the whole deal.
But there are just some people like that.
They really don't care whether they're doing any business from that.
It's just like Martin King.
There's a guy.
They don't advertise on his station.
Martin King and Scott King from King, whatever it is, they pedal.
You know, kind of, uh, Martin, I'm a Martin King.
Well, Martin, you know, you get a personality transplant.
You're very stiff.
You're very stilted.
Your delivery is a bad.
But we do know who you are.
You know something.
I think it is in this room again.
I think I'm, oh, man, I'm having a bad, you know something.
It just started after Greg Reed came down here and all of a sudden, I'm all like choked
up and gagging on stuff in here.
It's in this place.
Here's a mobile in Bokeh.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I got a question for you.
What, um, what happened to your website?
What happened to what website?
The Neil dot Neil.
That's that ancient history.
It's Neil Rogers dot com.
You got to get with the, with the, with the country.
Oh, man, no wonder.
We're almost at the end of the century.
You're still like 200 years behind.
Neil Rogers dot com.
Eric and Orlando does a great job on it.
Okay.
I'll check that out.
Hey, I'm riding around with a coworker of mine.
And he's here.
He's laughing.
Yeah.
And he wants, he's, well, I would tell him about, yeah, I was telling him about lotion
in the basket.
He wants to hear that.
Is there any way you can play it?
Any way I can play with the whole thing?
Yeah, please.
So how about just it puts the lotion in the basket for starters in the rest of it later.
Okay.
Thank you.
Good.
I got this guy in the, actually, he's in the trunk of my car.
I kidnath.
I mean, he's sure like poison, but I got the speakers blurring so we can't miss hearing
it.
And I got him locked up in the trunk and he wants to hear something like it puts the lotion
in the basket.
Look at to it.
Oh, there's something bad in this place.
There is or maybe, and you know something Greg Reed told me his kids got monol.
And he hasn't been feeling too good.
And he sure don't want to spread it around.
He was in here like half an hour ago.
And I'm already like choked up and I'm jagging.
Was I doing this before he came in?
No.
No, shouldn't let him lick your face like that.
Oh, that was my face.
Toby, I'm about to fall.
This is Debbie.
Hello, hi, Debbie.
I'm interested in getting through operations done.
Okay.
And some body contouring and some lip oil extraction.
Uh-huh.
And I was wondering if it's some tummy tuck and lip augmentation cosmetic.
The best surgery place for all of these things.
Uh-huh.
And I was wondering.
Well, let's start with.
Well, I need to get everything done.
Probably the first thing I'd like to have removed is my thing.
Okay, we don't do that.
No.
Could you do breast implants though?
Uh, I can't be done.
But I don't know if they would do it right away.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Uh-huh.
How much?
Uh, 5,000.
Excellent.
I'd like to have my skin resurfaced too.
Uh-huh.
Lace of surgery.
Uh-huh.
Have the lamb stop crying yet, mommy?
Excuse me?
Don't hurt mommy's little baby.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I'd like to get the liposuction that I saw on TV.
Okay.
Can you make me look more like a woman?
Well, we'll have to see you first.
And then I'm on looking actually.
We can tell you that when we see you.
Should I wear my skin suit made of body parts, mommy?
Uh, if you'd like to.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Would you like to make an appointment?
Yes.
Okay.
Um, there is a $100 consultation fee.
That's fine.
Okay.
Okay.
Um, my name is Buffalo Bill.
Okay.
Let me give you a little information from you.
Okay.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I understand.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Do you want to come in for a consultation for the life of the...
What's the lotion in the basket?
Uh, okay.
Would you like to make an appointment?
Or do you want to call me back?
Okay, what's the lotion in the basket?
I understand.
I got my skin suit and it was like, uh...
Bill, it puts the lotion in the basket.
I understand that.
What's the lotion in the basket?
What's the lotion in the basket?
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I will talk to you in a time, okay?
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Hello?
11.03 at 5.60.
And we got hanged from the Durala to a clock.
Booster from the National Car Eating Center at 6.
And then 7 o'clock to pregame.
Panthers in Colorado at night.
7.30.
Any interest?
No.
Okay.
You know, just above the story about the grease man going to church today to try to save his ass.
And it's R&R today thing.
This story is...
And coincidentally, the guy that just called you before about the grease man used to be on the ape in Jacksonville.
Wait till you're this story.
It says no more monkey business.
WPLA Jacksonville Nighttimer, Dick Dale, wanted to one up Crosstown WAP, which was doing a cash call contest called Spank the Monkies.
WAP is known as the Big Ape.
So last week he created his own contest of the same name.
The difference, Dale's version involved male listeners who competed in the studio to see who could not be masters of their domain in the quickest time.
WPLA even recruited two female volunteers to serve as visual stimuli for the contestants.
In keeping with the theme, the contest ended prematurely, Scorch-Court.
Not that way.
When one of the 14 contestants who just happened to be an undercover vice cop busted Dale on a prostitution statute.
Program director Rick Schmidt was suspended and Dale went on vacation until Monday when both will return.
A little premature Scorch-Court evacuation.
How do you like that?
This is the kind of stuff that's going on in radio in America today.
His guys are coming in and speccing their monkey and they're bringing naked bras and it kind of sounds like the old Ron and Ron show.
Of course, in that case it was the host that we're doing it.
See, I'm still trying to figure that out.
I know it's not very complicated, but they used to bring in these skanky naked bras.
I mean, Scabby, you wouldn't touch him with somebody else's.
Okay, believe me.
No matter how desperate you are, even the thing wouldn't touch them with his thing.
And I used to go in there in the other in the control room and I'd look in there and hear Ron and Ron and Feds.
Of course, it was all red in the push.
I think it was a face.
And they're sitting in the way these naked bras I'm thinking it's a radio show.
They really don't have to be naked.
You follow what I'm saying?
It's just a radio show.
Nobody can see it.
You're naked right now.
And in that case, the more close they would have put on, the more appealing it would have been because they were skanky.
I mean Scabby.
Even Scabby Hayes never looked like that.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hey, Neil. How are you doing?
Okay.
Hey, Neil, about that guy with the crap stain on him.
Yeah.
Three, two.
Open line of day two and groward.
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty.
One of yours is pound five, sixty on the AT&T wireless line.
Like I told you.
Oh, look at this.
We got the Mickey work lady on here. Hello.
Hello.
Yes, this is the Mickey work lady.
No, I love to know.
I just test that man.
He is the lowest comeback in the world.
Why are you saying that?
Because you're the Mickey work lady.
Well, we love you.
We love you when we insult the charm of the world.
Well, do you want to say this?
The Mickey work lady.
Why I'm calling.
Why are you calling?
The thing is, because.
You weren't talking to me this way.
You were like saying, you were a reporter saying reality.
You were like a litmus test for the same.
And the people can understand your show.
They're the same, that's all.
You know that?
Oh, and Mickey work lady.
Yeah, no.
Yeah, yeah, that's the Mickey work lady who's the little under the weather this morning.
Yeah.
You're not going to put me on this.
I'm going to say, I'm listening.
You're not going to put me on this.
I'm not going to put you on this.
What do you mean I'm not going to put you on this.
Well, I'm sorry to tell you how you're touching people out there.
Yeah.
Not many, but the water is touching people.
Not enough.
I'll tell you that.
Not the right one.
Well, that's because they're dead, brain dead, on in the head.
I love your show.
I love you.
Say how to Mickey.
Okay.
We have an open line in the day 2 and Broward.
56670560, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T wireless line.
In fact, now we got like 8,000 open lines.
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Bill.
Yes, sir.
All right.
I just want to tell you that let's notice the distance between hip hop and rap music.
Which is what?
Hip hop is the culture.
And the rap music just moves about.
Hip hop is the culture.
Yeah.
That's the way you live, the way you dress, the way you know, the way you carry yourself.
The rap music just retains, I don't like all rap music, but I'm in the hip hop.
You don't like rap music but you're in the hip hop.
Oh, I saddle my all rap music.
Yeah.
But I live hip hop.
You live hip hop.
Right.
Which means.
Just like you get, you don't walk around gay or they, you know.
Oh yeah, you know.
I'm minced.
You know, you put on pants, you don't walk around like a lady.
Oh, sure.
I got like pantalooning on right now.
You run the sand on the sand.
Yeah, yeah.
In fact, I'm sitting here stark naked.
Yeah, I just want to let you know because the tour is on the way to talking about it.
Okay, well listen, hop on this and have a good life.
All right.
Okay, he likes to hit.
See, I don't, I don't, I mean, I'm not finding that explanation because they call the music now hip hop.
If hip hop, be a way of life, then how can it be hip hop music?
You be following what I'm saying?
And I was thinking the other day because there was a pickup truck.
I was sitting in a stop light with two, an ugly kind of red neck of your white kids sitting in it.
Blasting the music.
And of course they had that rap music on that real.
Just here on a tolerated crap.
And I was thinking what a shame, you know, because now it's like all the way up to say like early 30s.
Would that be about the right age to say that all those young people grew up listening to a rap crap.
And then they consider that their music, which I think is.
I mean embarrassing would be an understanding.
Would you even admit that you like that music?
Anybody out there?
No.
No, I mean, if you were white, would you admit that you like that?
No.
No.
I mean, if you were black, you're supposed to be like this guy, although he said he don't like all of that.
That is what he said.
But he lives hip hop.
Kind of like the Easter Bunny.
He lives hip hop.
He's hopping on it every time he can.
Now if somebody would teach those folks a little bit about birth control, we'd all get along.
Do Jay.
Exactly him too.
We have an open line in the Bronx in two and a five six seven, oh five sixty.
Oh, that's you be ill and is that what that was?
Sure.
Let's hear it.
You'll Jay.
Wait, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
You'll be ill and maybe.
Okay, put it on this suspended animation.
Hold it.
Yes, first.
Back to the moon.
Have you ever had the run?
And baby, come notice the Hershey square.
Oh, now the golden under the sea.
The kind that makes your eyes really scream.
You do the green at the quick steps that when you try to hold it in it starts there to run.
Where she twerps the healing and dying the rear splatter falls.
Yeah, that God works in mysterious ways, doesn't it?
I mean, what kind of God would create diarrhea?
Constipation.
I've asked you this question many times before.
Does anybody ever have an answer?
No.
Even animals, even your dog.
Of course you got him on a human diet.
You know, that's going to be the excuse.
Even dogs get the squirts, hopefully not in the house too often.
Thank you Chuck.
There's my buddy Chuck from the sub-setters bringing me my last meal before I croak from whatever this.
And I just said the George during the break.
I said, I've got this like like twitch in the eyelid or my left eye,
along with all this other stuff that's going on.
He said, yeah, I've had that for the last few days too.
Now isn't that interesting?
I go away from here for 10 days.
Feeling pretty good.
Feeling anything I could, okay?
And this rash, you know, going pretty much away and making a little bit of a comeback, but not too bad.
Come back here.
It's the third day back to work.
My eye is twitching.
I feel like I'm on death's door.
My head is aching.
My rash is like palpitating.
My recto.
I feel too great either.
You don't think there could be like something in this place like a real sick place, do you?
Uh-huh.
Because God forbid they should have to actually spend some money and clean this, put, and join out.
When it doubt, clean that, join out.
By the way, here's a facts from money inside and third channel.
They hate, they all hate each other over there.
Can't think it along like we do here.
This fact says Peter Boulder would sell his children and wife for a permanent sucking spot on Rana's rectums.
What it's a little fast, but you know, how do you like that?
And that's true.
How do you sleep?
How do you live with yourself, Peter Boulder?
All the lives you've destroyed in this market.
How do you like it?
Even at the slaughterhouse over there in Chicago.
They don't destroy as many lives as you're doing in this business.
You piece of walking turd.
Garbage.
Garbage on two legs.
That's you, Pete Boulder.
And of course, you know, Tom Jik is busy writing about Monica Lewinsky, denied, and about how she's really going to have a big deal.
And that's a big audience in spite of the fact that, you know, Tom, why don't you write ever about anything that's going on in this town?
We got all of these things, all of this, the buttery going on in the media in this town.
And you're busy, always Mr. Network expert, you know?
All of these things.
Yeah, that's what we want to read about.
We don't give a crap about everybody and their brother knows that bitch is going to be on there.
With that illiterate, with that speech defective piece of garbage from Miami Beach, Bob Waw.
See, that's the scandal.
Not that Monica Lewinsky is going to be on there.
But that Bob was doing it and that, you know what?
She's the guilty of TV.
I see a tremendous parallel.
She can't speak.
She cannot speak at all.
Tom Broca and Barbara Walters are the gildies of television.
They can't speak even a little bit.
And somebody somewhere decided that they were sensational and worth millions of dollars to put their ass on there.
It is absolutely unbelievable.
Okay, deadlines open 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
And by the way, Geldy, to talk about what a hard ass and little piece of tour you are,
while virtually everybody else in the building came down and said happy 23rd anniversary, Neil, on Monday,
including those people that hate me like poison some of them.
Did he come down here and show his little ugly face?
No.
Not that I really care.
But just to show you what little hard ass he is.
And he's knocking me in Hank.
Oh my god.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
I don't think we'll ever be this in again.
Yes, sir.
There's this place out on Miami Beach.
It's called the Sandbar.
Out on 60 something.
Collins.
Yeah.
There's a guy out there who flips burgers, speaking of diarrhea.
It looks just like you.
And.
And kind of funny.
You should go check him out.
Be like looking in the mirror.
Yeah.
Okay.
Thanks for the good news.
Oh my god.
This guy waited all that time for something that profound.
Thank you.
He discovered your other job.
He what?
He just discovered your other job.
Yeah.
I was trying to keep it under covers.
We were going to think I make all the big bucks.
You're not from this tea pass outfit.
Not from the measlies.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.
On the 18 T wireless line.
Never again.
It'll never happen again.
Yeah.
Right.
They're slaughtering people in Uganda by the hundreds of thousands.
Now they're slaughtering tourists over there with a little machete doing an OJ number on them.
Never again.
They're slaughtering people in Kosovo.
Never again.
You wait and see.
We're going to go in there and do something about it.
You better watch out.
Right.
And what has God sit back and let this go on by the way?
You think he watched that?
You're seeing in the Godfather?
Were they said there were animals anyway?
Let them move their souls?
Must be.
Because God was talking about all the slaves and how you treat your slaves.
And you do this and you don't do that.
See if any of that was divinely inspired, any of that bull crap that was written in the Bible.
If it was anything over and above the intelligence or lack of of the people who wrote it in those days,
it would have said something like, you don't hold people as slaves.
Yeah.
And you don't keep women as being subservient and keep them out of the temple and the church and all the other crap
and keeping barefoot and pregnant all the time, unless it's convenient.
You know something?
There's even something in there's something in the vent.
There's a poison in this guy in place.
Do you think I'm joking when I attended as a fungus among us?
There's something real sick in this building.
And I think it was down here about an hour ago.
Here's a mobile in Okachoby.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes?
I've never waited that long for a guy in the film before.
I hear like your nail.
But I just wanted to comment on a...
What pain for it?
I just wanted to comment on the rap and hip-hop.
Yeah.
There's an article in a paper that said, hip-hop is the background music for rap music.
So there's something else in the world that you're using for changeably.
But hip-hop is also the culture and it's the background music for rap.
Yeah.
That's all.
And it all sucks.
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.
Can I call somebody a d-stag?
It's beautiful.
Yes.
You have to listen to it.
Not all of it is good, but a little garbage.
Some of it is good.
It's dumb.
It promotes illiteracy.
It's not poetry.
Not all of it.
It promotes illiteracy, violence, and stupidity.
Not all of it, though.
It promotes a culture that is so anti-human and so unacceptable.
Can I call someone a d-stag?
Sure.
Okay.
And it still sucks.
There you go.
She says it's beautiful.
Is there anybody else out there that thinks that hip-hop is beautiful?
No.
Come on, let's do it.
They're not doing much on these phones.
Come on here.
A little too much of that one.
Plus I'm having my lunch now anyway.
I just want to have one good last meal before I quote from the QA and corporate disease.
No matter which one of these places you go to, they all got their own corporate goddamn disease in this town.
God forbid.
Like I said, we still have a lot of people who are not doing it.
So I have a goddamn exterminator.
We don't have a bug man that comes in here once a month, once every six months, once every year, once every sookas.
Do we have one?
No.
No.
Here's a mobile and four-letter.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes?
Neil, for a long time.
I want to give you some help with your twitching eyelids.
Yeah.
What you want to do is warm compresses.
Five minutes on each eyelid.
What do you mean on each eyelid?
I've only got one of them that's twitching.
Only one twitching?
Yeah.
Yeah, just get a, you know, I think I've just got this spot.
No, what's that?
It's not, it's not, get a gay spot.
This clock.
Or this clock?
Yeah, or, you know, just a little bath clock, warm it up and put it on your eyelid.
Yeah.
And then it will.
And after about five minutes and that, I'll take care of it.
But what causes it?
Stress.
That's what it is.
You got to stress.
It's this place.
It's that goddamn Maddie, the food Nazi upstairs.
If he knew that we were eating food down here right now, he'd be jumping up and down like Napoleon.
Neil, can I call some of the dish bags?
Yes, sir.
Neural, the Louisville, your two big flaming dish bags.
Okay.
See it?
Give me the dish bag.
Well, I'm sitting here naked.
And I got that picture of what's his name.
Did we ever get a call on that, by the way?
Of course not.
Let's talk about something important today.
I brought this up the day before I went on vacation and it was like talking, it was like starting into a windstorm.
Now I realized that we've slipped a lot being on this second-rate station.
But I'm going to tell you somewhere out there, there's somebody who went to Palmetto High.
In fact, there's probably somebody that was on the Palmetto High swimming team.
Are you going to start this crap again?
Yes.
I just noticed this picture.
Thank God George didn't throw this out.
Brendan Barmer.
Brendan's got a new friend.
He doesn't know it yet, but I'm Brendan's best friend.
He isn't aware of it.
So this was what they was.
This was the Harold Sports section on Thursday, February 18th.
That was the morning I went on vacation that day.
There's a big story about how Brendan goes to a Duquesne University.
He's a 20-year-old walk-on swimmer.
And today he's a bodybuilder and a this and a that and all these other things, all these things.
And he finishes the runner-up and the Kellogg's raising brand Crunch-Crunchathon.
And I've done, oh, that's ready.
He did 6000 abdominal crunches and all this other crap.
And it shows Brendan sitting there with his shirt open and a big smile on his push.
And I'm thinking to myself, well, if Brendan would just show up here, I could have like a little appetizer.
Huh? Did anybody ever call and say, oh, I went to school with Brendan?
I know who that guy is.
Of course not.
What the hell is wrong with you people out there?
Don't you know anybody?
No.
I mean, the people we know are like so unimportant and most of them so ugly.
Here's a mobile and sunrise.
Hello?
Mobile and sunrise.
Going once.
Okay.
Open line and Broward to and date 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line.
Here's Miami.
Hello?
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I want to talk about hip hop.
I mean, I don't know about that girl thing is beautiful.
Yeah.
It ain't really beautiful, but a lot of it has a lot of positive messages.
Like what?
Like, like, a feature woman to a pulp and that goes through some folies.
No, that one.
Now, see that?
See those different types of rappers.
There's a lot of deep rappers.
There's ones that promote.
There was deep?
Like deep, yeah.
Like deep like in your rectum.
That deep?
No, no, no.
Way in there?
No.
Deep with deep.
They talk about issues.
A lot of people talk about real issues.
Some talk about political stuff, which really doesn't interest me.
Good on it.
You know, but like.
Yeah, out of that crap.
I don't like politics, but whatever.
It's like, it's different because you have some rappers that are talking about, yeah, I'm going to pull out my gat or gun, whatever.
You're going to pull out there what?
Yeah, that's another word for gun.
I know that.
I thought you said something else.
No, no, no.
They're like, oh, yeah, I'm going to pull out my gun and shoot you.
But a lot of people, they like, there's also like what are the type of music where people fight in?
You know what I'm saying?
Like, do you think Celine Dion is going to scrap or melt more than that?
I want to tell you, Celine Dion is the biggest piece of garbage.
I can't stand right here.
I hear it too, man.
I'd rather hear rap music for 25 hours straight.
I can't stand.
Then here's Celine Dion.
She makes me want to barf even if she is Canadian.
I can't stand that bitch.
I hope she elopes with God in that little fag at what's his name?
Leo de Caprio.
How?
I hate that mega-push.
He is the biggest piece of little turd, man.
Even an old fact like me can't stand it.
Oh, no.
Yeah, it's the letter he Devman, he got used to that.
I have to take my technicals in.
Exactly.
Okay, listen, have a great day, pal.
All right.
And hop on this.
Okay, we're starting to learn about hip-hop music today.
It's about time we had a blending of the cultures in this town.
And what are we going to do about those island people?
I asked that question yesterday.
Did we get an answer?
No.
See, here's our poll questions for today.
When you see somebody with dreadlocks, which of the above do you do?
Which of the following do you do?
One like hell, call a police or both of the above.
See what he's gotten, how much?
Or the other alternative is like...
Pukerga.
Like, for example, this morning I'm channel surfing.
One of the shows they had that will be Goldberg.
Now, I'm going to tell you something.
Well, that was fun.
At the risk of alienating my Jewish friends out there.
Whoop a Goldberg, you know what I'm talking about?
Yeah.
I don't know about those people named Goldberg.
That was fun.
Yeah.
But I see her and I immediately start...
You know.
When you start up chucking in that bird...
Like that.
Like maybe you've got a little dog, like mine that's always picking up crap off the ground
and off the carpet.
And it's always gagging up.
You know, always on the verge of puking its cuts out.
When I see somebody with dreadlocks, I immediately start getting violently ill and those
rost the people over there in the Netherlands like I'm telling you, I'm stood on.
I mean no place is perfect and that's why they're there.
Just to make sure that there's something there that'll be very annoying to cook, bon,
rock, poke.
You know what I'm talking about?
1126 at 560 QA.
I mean, can't the islands people do anything besides drugs?
No.
Got there especially?
Uh huh.
I'm not saddened.
It's Samo time.
Yes, get down with the man who puts a disk and get functional.
MC Samo.
It's the album that's flooded its way to the top of the chalk.
Please, have a don't hurt yourself.
You get unable to touch it.
Have you viewed her and the Samo's latest lies?
You got you.
The critics agree about MC Samo.

And Ebony says, say what homie?
Oh, damn hell.

Oh, I'm sorry.
No, seriously, in a few minutes, I'm going to play a record that I like a lot.
I'm going to play a song and then we're going to find out if I'm full of crap.
No, you're already nodding your head.
You're already saying I'm full of it.
It's not the backstreet boys.
It's not something that you have to be intimidated by because it threatens your macho masculinity
because if you admit that you like it, are they intimidated?
By the way, how's 311 coming?
311?
They're doing great.
No, 311.
That's if 1-911 is busy.

In fact when she comes out to sing the she came out the last game

They brought her out to sing that real
Pureful song whatever was that Canadian song up in action land them

Thank you very much that little pink guy is doing his job
Anyway, I heard you mentioned that the station needs a pest control service
I didn't say they need one. I say they're too cheap to buy to get one
Oh, because I would like to apply for the job, but but there is no job because they're not gonna pay for it
So unless you want to do it for free
Mm as much as I like to meal
That's what I'm saying that's why we were one day we had a guy came in off the street heard me belly
I can about it and did a little spritz in around you know here and there, but that was it
We got ants falling off the ceiling in this place. I am an ant specialist right
And I can't do it for free like muggy Solomon. Okay. Well, thanks anyway pal. Thanks. See there you go
Whoever heard of working in an establishment that doesn't have a bug spray guy an exterminator coming
At least once a month
Anybody in the in the history of radio ever working a station where there was no exterminator no
God
Even when I worked at WYND for two weeks in Sarasota that cheap prick pub packs and we had an exterminator
Not here. It's not the visibly read way baby
But maybe if you realize Greg I'll take you to dinner with Chris and they do have exterminators there
I want to bang you in the butt honey. Have you ever turned on the radio and said that son makes me sick?

Nothing there
But go ahead
She's already poison the atmosphere
Yeah
Perhaps

I'm not you, when I get so sorry
But you don't cry at me, I'm so mad at you

All right, all right
See they liked it
So 11 before noon at 5.60.QM
Okay, make it or break it
They don't know who that is
Because it's a European group
They're British
Steps
Number one in London, by the way, for a while
Not anymore
And actually some days if you live long enough
It might be released here
They also got on the same with this
But I didn't realize they did this anymore
Maybe this is very rare
That they had a CD single with two cuts on it
Remember the old extended play 45s
That used to have like four
Two on each side
And this one's got like two
Cutting off
I'm not going to play this
But just like a taste
Also with that handed hit
That's mad
That's what it is
Yeah
Perfectly
But you know how I feel about the BG's after they screwed me on that American way?
Okay, two open lines today
Come on, let's hear it
5.670560
I want you to rush out to your music store right now
And ask for it by name steps and heartbreak
You're going to get it?
No, of course not
They don't have it
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello
Yeah, what's up, Neil?
Yes, sir
Yeah, man, listen
I've been listening to rap music for 20 years
Oh, God
You understand what I'm saying?
Yeah, I do
And believe me, man
Miss rap music is the most
Missed, understood, still music
Correct
Yeah
In America
What is it?
Yeah
Missed, understood, seriously, man
It's from a steady stuff, though
It's a music
I thought rap and the music were like contradictory terms
Correct
And now listen, man, listen
That's why they changed
See, that's why they changed it to hip-hop
Because when you say rap, it's easy to put the C in front of you
Right
See, I'm gonna tell you something
It was okay
Yeah, listen
It was a credit for people like you anyway
See what I'm saying?
It was created by young black living in the inner city
Yeah
You know what I'm saying?
It's just that corporate America
You sound like you make a local off of it
So they try to force it on everybody
You know what I'm saying?
Right
But it was a credit for you
Now what do you mean?
Now how badly did you hate that record I just played?
Did you hate that?
I mean, I hate that
I'm telling you
I'm black and I almost saw a white reference to that
You see that?
That was a very well-you-right
Five white people, you're right
You saw me from America
For guys like you, the Cursed Bad Rap
I mean, it's a new point
Because they want to do it mentally
You know what I'm saying?
You're right, it's a mute point
Right
I'm pressing the mute button right now
Have a great day pal
All right
I'll read it there at your Roma
All right
Okay, we have an open line of day one and brown
Five, six, seven
What he be saying?
He said it's a mute point
Come on, what about this record I just played?
You don't like that?
Don't be such a relentless pick
I know that you think it's pretty good
Yes, you know I don't like it
What an asshole, man
You know that's your season asshole
Yeah
How could you not like that?
That's a great song
Mmm
Nothing there
It's no 4-1-1
Now she's a little sorry I got the talent
Yes
Good
Who said Jerry Lewis doing hip hop?
Here's Poppato B, chill out
Hi, Neil, I'm gonna miss Dusty Springfield
Yeah, here's one
Here's one
Oh
And did you know she was a lesbian?
That's what I thought
Yeah, there was a book about 10 years ago but it was really bad
That's why these people don't want to talk about Dusty Springfield, he was a dyke
Yeah
All these straight guys out there that are obsessed with all the emotional about bull bikes
But they don't want to talk about her
Yeah, well she didn't do any videos so
Yeah, that's probably it
They missed out
What about the one with Anne Bishop?
Well, come on, that's you don't go on the other extreme
Yeah
Okay, well that was a good one
Okay, thank you
Butch up
Open line of day two and Broward
In fact, if there's nobody got anything to say about that song, you see
That's what I mean about this town
You're a bunch, a collective bunch of deadheads
If you hated it like poison
If you've heard it before
If you don't ever want to hear it again
Something, have something to say
Have some feeling
When Jean Pitney did that record a town without pity
This is the place that he was singing about
Make no mistake about it
These people no matter what it is
They have no opinion
They're like, they're like, I've told you before vanilla ice cream
That's why every time I bring that thing up
They all live in the raised their hands
Oh yeah, we love vanilla ice cream
Sure it figures
It's only a small segment of the population
That have enough taste that have real taste buds
That can enjoy fish food
And all the other great Ben and Jerry's flavors
That have some taste to them
But Taffioca putting in vanilla ice cream man
How about you? They're like eating wonder bread
Not even with anything on it
Just right out of the bag
Just stuffing wonder bread down their puss
Here's Miami, hello
Hello, Neil? Yes, Caldy
Neil, I love fish food
Yeah, I hate vanilla ice cream
And I even hated that song you played even worse
Really?
It was terrible
The last time I heard something like that was in an elevator
Almost initially
Yeah
You know though, listen to these black guys call and I hate rap
Yeah, I hate it with a passion
But I'd rather listen to that
But anyway, listen to the side track of the high
I got an important point to make
I can't think without music
The black people are falling asleep and that rap was the inventor
Was started by black kids in the ghetto
That's not true
How about Motown?
At least black kids in the ghetto said that
Oh yeah, I believe that's not true
What's in the list?
Randy, a group in the 80s
Right
Did the first rap song which was
I didn't like the song
But that's where rap came from, a white girl
Randy's still with the new old spot
Yeah, there you go
That he had been there
And listen, I wanted to tell George
I thought he didn't have a career in the business
Yeah, that's your last week
You really?
You did a great job
Great
Excellent
And I think he'll talk to us by the way
Have a great day
Take care
I really just can't hold it in you
You just can't hold it in you
Go to Europe where they have all the great music
And you come back here
Oh, that really sucks man, that blows
Let's hear some rap music
Let's start rapping it
And by the way, they've had too much rap musical
But they're just obsessed
They got rap artists over there that haven't been born yet
It started way back in history
They got all in me
It rossed the people in Amsterdam on the street
They turned on the music factory or the box
And you just rapping out your...
Rack of them
Oh God, on and on
Which at least it keeps some of those people with the raster here
Off the streets anyway
Rock, mud, rock, go, go
So like I said, what are we going to do about the guerrillas in our midst?
But that ross here had me...
Yeah
Four minutes till noon
By the way, speaking of assholes, what are we going to do about John Penis?
Does he work here anymore?
No
I mean, is he going to do anything?
He's on vacation
Oh, he's on vacation!
What year did that start?
Because Pompano Park, you know, where they had that big $150,000 race on Friday, September,
February, whatever it was, February 27th, which is like several days ago
With a track record, 149 and 4
Fantastic!
But I have nothing...
I don't have the Simon Cash schedule for the month of March
I don't have anything interesting or anything for the month of March
All I can tell you is they got great harness racing going on tonight starting 7-35 at the PM
The Neil Roger Show on 560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale
Okay, 12 noon at 560 QAM
What happened with what?
With the bit, with what bit?
I thought you were going to play a bit?
Why?
You always do?
Well, I didn't
Okay, because I don't have one cute up because I'm busy looking at Brandon's picture here
I'm busy reading
Huh?
No, well, that's true
I'm eating lunch and I'm either over lunch or the picture and I got a facts here, which is from Yum
Oh, look at this from Club Cathode Ray
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
From some faggot out there
But nevertheless, a great fact that said, Brendan is the hottest, I'm on my knees with my mouth open, Brendan
Yummy yummy, I need an appetizer with 28 exclamation points
All I can say is...
Oh!
Yeah!
See, I hate to break the news to you, but no matter what your taste happened to be
Of the legal variety we're talking
You know, nobody wants to look at ugly people
We want to look at beautiful people
Just look at that whammy experiment
Nobody wanted to look at us ugly people
They put that pens on there and they had a few pretty interesting looking almost naked people on there
And it was a hit
What a concept!
People want to look at people that look great
What a shock
Right, Brendan?
Uh-huh
Just keep saying it
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Here's a mobile and sunrise
Hello
Hello?
Yes, sir
Yeah, I just wanted you to know it's just a comment called
I love Dusty Slingfield
And this morning when I heard about the news, they gave the her age as being 57
Sixty
And now you say 60
That's what they said
Yeah, surprised me, but I don't think that there was a more sultry voice than
Regardless of what her sexual persuasion was
What?
Her music will...it's the voice of that time period
I'm going to find some in my collection somewhere I'll bring it in the mall
Well, there's a one...there's a one CD set that has...that's a pretty comprehensive and then there's a box that's pretty pretty
Yeah, there's one CD that I think is Rhino that puts it out
Right
The pretty comprehensive collection
And then there's a three CD set that has like everything
And stuff like that that I went ahead
But I just wanted a comment that I really appreciate that you appreciate
I love Dusty Slingfield
She was great in the fact that people who die who give us a little bit of entertainment
I'm not saying we got to go up to make a grace land for Dusty Slingfield and act silly about it
But at least recognize the fact that she entertained us a little bit
Not only that she entertained, but when you listen to her voice
It's pretty timeless and the emotion and the way that she was able to put across the song
You know, unless you hear her singing, you don't understand the sensuousness
And what she was trying to put across and people, a lot of people don't know that she was entertaining
Even when she was a young girl
Even had her own show I think at one time with her sister from that set
Yeah, in England
Well, it was her sister, yeah, that was the best
Yeah, right, it was her sister
Up until 10 years ago when they came out with the revelation that I think that for her sense of everything is...
I don't know, it's made some lecture with the sexual misplacing
But since it's a voice, listen to what she's saying, why are you saying it? Thanks a lot
Okay, thanks
Okay, see we got a couple, thank God we got a couple of people emotional about Dusty Springfield
Good lady, okay?
So she was a little bit too much or for some of you, too bad
I can't believe you don't like that, so then I think you're full of it
I think you're just like the guy yesterday that's so-called religious guy
That I couldn't get to admit that he knows it's a bunch of crap
You're just playing hard ass
I don't think that there's a record that's ever been made that if I played it in here and I said that I loved it
That you would agree that it was good
Other than maybe Aerosmith, maybe
I like Aerosmith
Like when I said that, Crayon was the greatest song of all time, they invented rap, by the way
Yeah
Oh and by the way, this has nothing to do with that
But I was watching because they had all these stupid info mercials on even in Europe
And you know how they're always peddling these one record sets and two these box sets
And it was like the best of the, I don't know, one of the 1670s deals
And they had one of the cuts on it was I can hear music by the Beach Boys
Which is one of my favorite songs by the Beach Boys
Now did you know who did the lead vocal on I can hear music?
Brian Wilson?
No
Close
It's a trick question
No way, it's not a trick question
Are you only got five boxes?
Like love?
No, not my glove
I said close, so in other words, it must be one of the Wilson's
It wasn't Dennis Wilson, it wasn't Brian Wilson, it was
And Wilson
Let me give you a hint, fat and dead
Just recently, come on George, Mr. Music Expert that's getting red in the face
You look like you just caught whatever I got
Red in the push, beat red, Mr. Music Expert
That's not the Beach Boys
Why not?
How about Al Jardin?
Who?
Yeah
You putz
How about David Lemongello?
Yeah
Come on, Wilson
Pete
Well, California
Close
Carl Wilson, you schmuck
I can't name all the Beach Boys
Why?
Because I was an embryo with Dennis Wilson the drummer, he's dead, he drowned
Remember Dennis Wilson the blonde one?
Brian Wilson, he's not dead, just brained it
The bed guy, that's Brian Wilson and I know Mike Love
Right
Because he wears that mic love, who's like a real Republican which made us turn on him badly
But nevertheless, with a high fault dead of all the rest of them
And Carl Wilson and Al Jardin and then in the beginning before Al Jardin there was a broad David Marks
Who was the only one that ever looked good and they said get out of here because we all look pretty ugly
Well, you know, some people thought Dennis Wilson wasn't the bed because he was blonde and a surfer kid, he was ugly
He's dead, he drowned
Carl, now see, sidetracked me off the whole thing there
I never knew that Carl Wilson did do that in either songs
I always thought it was either Brian Wilson or it was Mike Love
So I just mentioned that and of course it brings to mind the fact that he was young and fat and he's dead
Just mentioned that in passing book, young, fat, dead, prematurely dead
Trying to help that guy, you know
Here's Miami, hello
What is it?
Okay, they're gay, don't have time for the game players, okay?
Go play with each other
Two open lines and date five, six, seven, five, six, ten, five, five, six, ten, and a mobile one line
Mobile in the curl spring, hello
Yeah, Blue, remember Chris Farley
Boob
Yeah, I was just saying Boob remember Chris Farley, he's gotten dead
Anyway, my eager old daughter wants to know what mall that band is playing in next, you know
She wants?
She wants to know what mall that band is playing in next
All right. I mean, holy cow. You know, how do you go from aerospace to a lot of pop band like that?
I like all kinds of music. Would you
I mean, wait a minute. Okay. I was just talking about the beach boys, right? Right? Would you say the beach boys were like hard rock music?
No, of course not. Do you do you like the beach boys? I
Can't enjoy it. I mean, I mean, I'm you know, I'm only 29. I just go here and there, but yeah
Sure, so it's fine. I like all different kinds of music
That's even different to what you're playing now. I met the budget Tiffany want to be sure playing over there now. No, yeah, I mean holy cow
So you're hitting whatever you hated it. I couldn't stand it to be quite on
But that's what we're trying to at least get some emotions. I'm feeling out of these people even if you hated it's better than having no opinion
The worst part is that I
I like you so much. I couldn't even change channels hating that music as much as I did
Well, it's only four minutes and 25 seconds out of your life. It was brutal Neil
I'll never play it again. Thanks only in the car. You're the best would you rather hear that or guilty? Oh
Okay, I think about it
See
There's a choice. What was a little harsh with that mall comment?
We have an open line at Broward five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty rhymes with six on the mobile one line
I think there'll be everything that is big is Aqua. Hey, I hate to break the news to you
But they're already that big they're gigantic that I told you number one in London big all over Europe the video all over the place steps
And I'll be over here eventually and I'll be very big over here
Now I would agree just being big doesn't mean that they're good
Look at that 8 11
Oh thank heaven to the 7 11 get it out of here with that crap. Oh, man, it music. It's real
It's real. We got on the sand and rap music it's the brother in the ghetto. It's crap
It's garbage. Baby. It's dumb. It's dumb music for dumb people
With taste deep inside their vacuum. Wow. Just ask Pete Volga. He'll tell you
We got the hangover show from the D'Arala to this afternoon
We got big fat tubby booge shamby from the National Car eating center with six o'clock with his hour and then
Geldie with a free game show at seven Panthers and a Colorado avalanche come on buy up those damn tickets. Let's crank that place up tonight
Let's fill that you went up. It's a mighty big game
You know Boston won last night beat Phoenix three to two Phoenix are staggering and
The Bruins are now two points ahead in Montreal one air game and the Rangers got a tie with Dallas and Washington beat the
Snot out of Tampa so all the teams on right in there with the the Panthers for that number eight playoff spot
Got at least a point last night and most had a win
So this is a humongous game last night have a little passion a little feeling come out to the macarita night bring two 300 bucks get a soda
Where do you find date pepperon and jeans hummus white where you got it sports radio five sixty two eight I am just
Distraught
Distraught can you believe this? I'm looking and looking at see one of the scams that they pull on these best of
CDs for various recording artists you know groups that have actually had more than like one half of a hit
Is they make you know the greatest the best the and they look like ten different versions and all of them have got
Something that one of the other ones doesn't have you know what I'm saying
So I'm digging and digging through my CDs over here
No
And is it on here? No
It's definitely on one of the ones that we got in here somewhere
Huh because I'm right like the front. I know what the front of the other one looks like
And it's not this this is the Beach Boys greatest hits
I'm not I'm not that I'm saying there's a lot of bad stuff on here. There's good stuff like
Yeah, and isn't that kind of syrupy too by the way they're saying that that heartbeat by steps with syrupy
surfer girl that's not syrupy
Huh I diabetes is starting to act up. I my blood sugar is raising the 300 just here in the first four hours
So your center is like wood syrup and bad syrup. Yeah like maple syrup
You like syrup from a jar
Yeah, good idea. I want to hear I can hear music by the Beach Boys with Brian with Carl Wilson
Which you didn't know say you can talk a good game and you can try to convince the public you know something about music
But we all know that you don't
Maybe music maybe like hook or rock you know, okay? Maybe like hook or rock. Yeah, all right chat. Maybe you know that
There's no reason I should
Yeah, but I do why not because I was a member of your then yeah, I know a Rudy Valley. Yeah, I wasn't born then
And then all about the I don't want that the fact that we don't have a balance that wasn't all this fossil rock
I saw silent movies at the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York. Hey, I could name three out of a how many Beach Boys
But not to name Carl Wilson
Aren't you embarrassed he just died here like months ago
Carl Wilson he's dead, but I do a lot of drugs. Oh, well, so today
Here's a big report in somewhere mobile in Miami. Hello
Hey, Neal's going okay, sir
Big report in South Beach heading east probably the McCartney Causeway
There's one pig standing up sticking its gun at everybody and three more on bikes
So anybody heading east probably the McCartney Causeway slow down and be careful. Thank you sir god bless you
One other thing. Yes, boys are not that van hailed vintage van hailed in narrow space a hundred times better than what
The vintage van hailed with David Lee Robb and Harold Smith now even out of the back then way better than the Beach Boys. Okay
Later, yeah, I'm not saying the Beach Boys are as good as Erasmus now van hailed
Because I hear of David Lee Roth and David Lee growth
And I skid like a growth like a mole starts growing in my lip. Oh, and that's another thing by the way
I want to know sometimes I'm so glad that this guy called
Not intentionally, but he like I said way into it
People with but I know I'm an old folk in I'm not into a lot of stupid stuff. Thank god
Body piercing is one thing and to me all of it not some of it all of it
I'm not talking like a little earring all of it depends on how many they are and how much they droop and what you're real
What the message is supposed to be which is usually a lie anyway
I'm talking about real body piercing people that do the body piercing in their tongue
Seriously are these people crazy? Uh-huh
If you had any and it goes to show you just like my the reason that I bring this up today my discussion about religion yesterday
It goes to show you
That if you tell people that something is trendy fashionable acceptable. It's uh, you know
It's in
They'll do it
You have got to be the most stupid idiotic piece of turd with no respect for your body even if it's a you know
Look at my body. Do I have respect for this one? Who the hell could?
But even as fat and disgusting as sick as I am when I put like a post in my tongue no way sweetheart
And of course you do realize that a lot of people got infections from that and many of them died they died they died they're dead
What let me let me do it huh? I have to speak to pop up. I don't think I did tongue
Seriously not to mention many other things I can think of that I might get in a way up
I mean how do you eat?
You know how every now and then while you're eating and you're chewing you chew down on your gum
I mean on your cheek on the inside of your cheek do that all the time
And it's annoying because there's like a big blood blister right there and then you keep touching with your tongue and irritating it
It's annoying
But when you got a like a ball on your tongue well, I mean like a silver ball on your tongue. Oh, I'm sorry
Brendan uh when you got a silver
A silver ball on your tongue that doesn't go away
And you tell me what what are you doing your chump down on that how do you chew how do you eat
Eat what how you speak when you have a thing about like that
Huh? Maybe that's like Tyson's hub maybe got a thing on his tongue. I don't know
Oh, and by the way, it was only a small TV set
It wasn't a big fan teach man. You want to want to be through there when they put him in the uh in the quarter to dry out my Tyson
Hey, what luck fight anyway
Oh, oh, oh god. I can't believe I don't have I can hear music. I'm gonna have to redo a recheck my library see where all the good stuff is
And you must admit there is some good stuff in there even you wouldn't admit that no question musical hardass
The older stuff
Where why don't why don't any of these say next is there any special?
Huh? Well, how about let's take a candle hello
Yeah, you got okay sir
I'm not gonna worry about that party person. I don't understand either
Well, what is that what would you ever allow somebody to put like a
Of post through your tongue? I don't know
God
Um, and then they got him in their penis. They got him in their nipples. They got him in their navel
They got you know, they got the people drilling stuff through every part of their body. You can imagine
I was prompted to call because I think we'll look near the end of the last hour you hit this guy calling it about
Blondie being the original rap music crap. Oh god. Neil. Yeah nothing to be further from the truth
You know rap has been around for a long time not to accept that it is now, but and I'm not necessarily a fan of it
But you know have to give them a props
You know they're making a lot of money for the music in their shoes days. Isn't that sad? Yeah crap
Yeah
And basically it's about it. I am out of material my friend. Okay. Thank you so much
I think a Corey started it from a Cincinnati wasn't that his name
Don't you remember the Corey rap?
Oh, yeah, I have that video by the way, huh? I had that video at home. Oh my god burn it
Two open lines and date were discussing rap. We're talking about I can hear music by the beach boys and Carl Wilson
Which beach boy was the best which one was the most macho? Which one is the most dead?
Which one did the most drugs which is the most right wing
See that started like a really turning it. Oh, I remember where the hell was it was it here?
Where was it that they wouldn't let them sing it some
New Year's thing
Because they were too controversial was that here? I don't think it was here. That was just a few years ago. Was it here?
I don't remember but because they were like a bit because they were a rock group and they're from I mean
They were as vanilla pudding. They were as mom and pop and apple pie as any group that was ever invented
I think unamerican was the yeah, I think that was here
Might have been here
Not to mention of course the fact that Mike love is always in those Republican fundraisers
They were all good. Bunch of right wingers probably from Orange County
Not too controversial the beach boys
Man talk about a dead head place
Here's Miami hello
Neil yes, sir
That's what you played before always a walking like I said yes, it's true bad. Okay, it's worth paying and I'm
I'm here again. I have a story for you about on tongue piercing
About what tongue piercing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I had a friend on swallow one
And they could get pretty expensive like five years ago. They were like $60
Yeah, she went over. She made it. All you got to do is dig it out
That's exactly what she did
Back on when in doubt dig it out and she put it back in her tongue
Yeah, she came that you know, it's infected it. Yeah
That's pretty disgusting. It is. I mean, there's nothing wrong with piercing that's just a fashion statement
You know there's a fashion statement excellent. Thank you so much sir. It's a fashion statement
It was James Watt in 1983
The reform at the Washington monument Washington monument
Thank you whoever called him with that information and Ronnie Reagan had to go to their defense
The beach boy can
Well, he used to be he forgot who they are
We have an open line in day five six seven oh five six
It's a fashion statement if you have somebody how about if you took a wooden post and somebody jended in there
Also fashion statement let's face it
It's sure is unique. It sure is different and if one person went on if Calvin Klein came on tomorrow and said
This is the new fashion for the next millennium
There'd be two million people immediately sticking wooden posts in their rectum running around hopping on it
Talk about hip-hop
Crazy people man who just whatever the latest bad whatever no matter how stupid it is no matter how little sense it makes no matter how idiotic how ridiculous
Oh, but it's counterculture right that's why there's only 50 million people walking around with bodies
You'll be in every part of their goddamn body just just like all the hippies in the sixties
Within within a matter of months they all looked the same they all smelled the same
They all did the same drugs. They're all I the same crap all of them crap
Because they were all individualists
Here's a mobile in peppered pine. Hello, no god. Yes, sir
Figure four at one
Sheridan street out west near I think it was the cross tree would be like north 70th. That's not about right
Could be about seven or eight of them on motorcycles and they all got their thing hanging out and they're lurking in the trees out there
So beware okay
Also if stick in a steel spikes through my penis is a statement
I
Listen it's a fashion statement man. Yeah, well, I'm not listening to that statement
I don't well. Okay, I'm a great thing
Yeah, of course if you if you have a one of those things if you have body jewelry in your penis
Doesn't it kind of interfere with like
Almost any function you can think of?
Doesn't it kind of like get in the way? Yes, well, we'll find out
You know, you got to get with the time and then you got to stop being a whole foggy
You got to get with you got to start listening to rap music you got to get your body pierced
You got to get a post in your tongue a post in your ear a post in your penis a post in your rectum. There you go
That's what Mike Tyson said he said it felt like a post holy
Maconon this is jobalon the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority
Right. Oh god
I turn up the key because the city NBA is dead
Well, right when you love to you why
Why don't you practice that to treat your own life
Didn't you say help the truck and help the city in the wrong way?
help the truck and help the truck and help the truck and help the truck and help the truck
help the truck and help the city in the air
It's the hard without my
Now you gotta breathe you might be to pay on the end
Or she'll wave the purple die gay and hair cut and it's a thing on the fan
Well, right when you jump the door and I come and you can triple down with it you try
You gotta go for the truck and help the city with all the time
help the truck help the truck and help the truck and help the truck and help the truck and help the city in the air
You know without my
You
Okay, that's enough
Man, am I pissed that I can't find I can hear music and you're lucky because if you don't like that song
I would have played the whole thing
How can you not like that song?
We talked to
I just in general I like it. I'm just saying anybody that wouldn't like it. How could you not like it?
Of course, you do know what was Carl Wilson that sang Lee vocal on that. Oh, George just swallowed his crap
He just took him on his cafe gubano
Well, I'm trying to teach you something. Okay, you're the expert in cyclopedia
You know all this useless crap, but anything that has to do with stuff that people are interested in you don't know about you know a lot of
stuff, but it's all useless
Just like this thing that I got you know, do you know anything about that? No, just like all the doctors. You know the same as they do nothing
What does it take what how many doctors how much money how many trips
How many experts does it take before somebody can diagnose the hang nail in his town
But like if you suffer from blue balls for example, you know
How many doctors would it take to go any for they look and said oh my god look at that you got blue balls mister how many
Here's a candle hello. Yes, sir. How you doing great. Well, I'm glad you're talking about the beach boys. They are they are the best
Well, now you're getting cured. Well, okay
Anyway, I
Pardon, sir. They're okay. I think you know Carl Wilson died. You didn't know he died
I know you died. He died of I think lung cancer a couple years ago lung cancer. Yes, smoking too much bad weed. I think is what did it?
Yaman
Anyway, help me ronda that that was Al Jardine singing lead
Your Al Jardine looks just like my roommate from Michigan State
But anyway
I think music is a great song. It's just I mean there's something about that song. It's just I can't even I can't describe it
You can't put it in the words, but there's just something about I'm gonna have to bring that in tomorrow
I'm gonna have a lot of music for tomorrow. I think it's I think it's on an album called sunflower originally
Sunflower yes released back in 1970 when the other music kind of sucked
Yeah
Oh, if you're great if you could play that I'll have it tomorrow anyway
Also, you know Carl Wilson he was he's the first vocalist when you hear good vibrations his guitar soft singing that song too
What he does yeah, and also got only knows that temple well wait a minute. See now these I can handle
God only knows that's
Wouldn't it be nice to have to I like
Carl
Carl come on
Yeah, I hate that song. Yeah, what's the other ones?
Oh, is that a good vibration?
That's probably the last thing he said
Oh
And what was the other wouldn't it be nice I think wouldn't it be nice is also
Yeah, talk about
Yeah, good here like George
Are you sure you know, man? You know
I'm 32 years old, but I've been listening to the Beach Boys since I could pick up the photograph needle and pop it on the pop it on there
Yeah, so
Just in case you were wondering I don't know if you were not but Brian Wilson has a new album
Brian Wilson made an album. Yes, last summer of 98 I think yeah, and I don't know about what about that first album for that first
Brian, don't you remember that?
Oh
Say that I was talking about
I
Tried to honk at one of the UCD stores and they just laughed me out of the place. I'm ever playing this on data
I think it was
Get back in the bed Brian before it's too late. All right listen. Thanks a lot. Okay. See it. I had a Carl Wilson
1988 reprise records Brian Wilson making a little solo comeback
Oh, that's enough bad really bad
Why do you know when you do all those drugs and when you're spending a lot of time in bed with your teddy bear
He spent a lot of time in bed with his teddy bear. Okay. He liked it
Let's go to plantation hello
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing great first of all let me talk before I rip you in a
Happy anniversary. Thank you. Love your show, but that song you played with your worst the worst thing you ever heard in your life
You know what that sounded like a living new young oh
Speaking at dikes and how can you know who will live in Newton john used to be married to
Matt Lapanzi
But anyway
Next thing is how can you not like the Celine Dion? Oh my and you're knocking me
Have you have you
And to get the bucket
Maybe you don't like her personality, but no, I don't care. First of all, she is ugly and pasting
Grosses since I'm not the I'm not the steered in that direction anyway that makes no difference to me
And additionally which I don't like music just because the artist looks good because most of them don't you know
But that song that syrup that crap
No, why are you doing this? Yeah, why did a poker please?
So I heard I heard it the first time and I had wicked diarrhea for
I love her
Celine Dion
I don't think she's gorgeous or I like oh wait a minute you think she's hot? No, I don't think she's hot. Oh
Thanks god maybe you think that Leo the caprio's hot

Yeah, you better look in the me and me too. Okay, thanks
Leo the caprio is good-looking
See you're gonna be screaming for the steps by the end of this show
And I don't care what you say this is a good record
I have no a big thing for them. I just I just bought this because I saw the tragedy the video
On the on over there and so I was in the record store buy a bunch of stuff for somebody else
I saw this I thought I'll buy it and then it had this other cut on their heartbeat which I realized is the big hit not tragedy
and
So I have no accident Ryan for steps, but I think they're pretty damn good. Oh, no you're wrong. Neil. It's bad. Okay
Go get a post-drill then you're a cheek. Okay
Deep inside your rectum and have a great life. Oh

Here's a candle hello. Hi Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, I'd like to talk about that these playfield
But just in reference to the beach boys
Um the song that you want to hear I can hear music. Yeah, the songwriting credits for that code at Jeff Barry
Ellie Greenwich and Phil Spector that was that was written during the early wall of sound days. Arlen Spector
Phil Spector
And there's also recorded by Ronnie Spector
I just in case I'm looking at a beach boy album in which that's it's on it's on the good vibrations

You know anything to keep you sane and it was god forsaken hell. I'm that man. I'm the only thing they got
They're talking about the body peers and you know
I said these people fierce about every per their human anatomy so far
I think if they won't want to make a statement maybe you get into something like body amputation
Maybe lock off a couple fingers or a couple of toes. I think that's good. I think that's gonna be as well
Once we cross into the new millennium. I think that's gonna be end. I think that's the next step
I wanted to chop it out. That's right. Really make a statement right
Thanks again, Neil and have a great day. Yeah, a little body mutilation. What's wrong with that? Huh?
I mean, you know
Have one in your earring one in your nose one in your penis one in your vagina. Maybe both of the above
All of these things. Yeah, there you go
If we've good enough for him you got that nipple ring going
Yeah, you two could be buffalo bill, baby
Oh my god, I bet you we got plenty of a potential buffalo bills with me right now make no mistake about that
How is the thing coming by the way? How is it doing?
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir

Here's Miami Beach. Hello
Yes
Hello, how are you? I'm just on the air. How's the old Siri doing?
Okay, let's do with it. Yeah, Neil yes, I was on the beach. I'll beach and I see this
Basically a bum walking around in a t-shirt, but I say to myself that's overstone and
I go up to the to the the lifeguard guy. I'm like is that all over stone right there? You know it was beach with pack on
Sunday. Yeah, I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Who? I was like okay, never mind. Was Oliver Stone? Yes, I walked up to him
I know he was when he put that JFK thing together that piece of crap
He's Oliver Stone. Oh man, that guy's Stone A. Yeah, he's the ender. So looking good
Honestly, feel real good and I go up to him and I just say you're overstone
You know, I just wanted to say I appreciate he's like don't don't cover he has cover in the stage
He's like don't do that. I'm I'm I'm looking for so yes, I am you know, he's like all freaking out. I was like
I appreciate your work. I tell him his work sucks. Thank you. Okay. We have an open line and tape five
There's another another one of those image things state of mind type
He couldn't direct Mickey Mouse to a pick his nose. Okay, that's Oliver Stone that great movie talk radio
Remember with Eric Bagotian. Oh god. That's enough to make me make me pierce his tongue
That's how bad that was and then that JFK my favorite scene in JFK was when we're Joe peshy is doing the thing where he's revealing the whole plot
Well, and this one did that one in Barbi, but he did this and this one behind the scenes
Just I mean the most pathetic idiotic and then there's the one where Donald Sutherland now there's a guy who ought to have maybe he's already got something in his tongue
See donner I can't even say now Donald Sutherland is all of a sudden very big and doing commercials for last couple years
My yeah, my favorite is the one for signal health plan CIG and a and he says
Signa signal like it's it's got a thing in it's not a pun
Signa
See, I guess they think that it's kind of like I don't know artsy far see that people are very impressed by that
And what happens when they do that is that you don't pay any attention
To the to what the commercial message is all you do is pay attention to the speech defect
That's the health plan and you're thinking oh my god, that's Donald Sutherland
Who sounds like Elmer Fudden Daffy duck with Brian Murray
Can't you hear Brian Murray doing spots for it? Signa
We have an open line and date one and brown and five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line
You mean that's Andy and Hollywood is that you're suggesting who that might be yeah, Jim or Mitch
One of these jackasses. Hello. It's not Andy. Okay. How are you doing today mr. Roygers? Okay?
Um Michigan state grad here on the phone checking in you don't sound anything like Andy
I think you're just slipping now not Andy. Got a bad ear. That's why I just taste the music is so bad
Just wanted to give you a little frog story that I had at the golf course the other day
Yeah, my uncle's down for Michigan
So I'm gonna take him golf around the way to the course
I'm explaining to him what the the frogs are like down here
And he doesn't quite understand and sure enough
Me and my uncle and a buddy we get joined up with a frog
They're all over the golf course here in Hollywood. Yeah
Of course he was too cheap to pay for a cart
So the three of us are in carts and he's walking which held us up for the first three holes
And then he asks if he can hop in the open space in the cart that my buddy has so he got a free cart right there. No
Well, you know we're nice people so we let him
Then I buy the guy a beer and the drink cart comes around and the drink cart comes around the second time and he doesn't get his wallet
No drinks when it's his round
and then
We get to the green and much to his surprise when he offered me a cigar
I already had a lit dubian my mouth because I like to do that when I golf
Yeah, man
And so you know
Anyways, I was just kind of interesting as I was explaining to him about all the frogs down here
Of course we get joined up with one and it was about a five hour round of golf
And long back to had a good time. Yeah, we had a great time and Neil I root my balls off for those tickets tonight. Okay
What are these people talking about what are they talking about what tickets? I said there's
1400 unsolved tickets for the night's game. I didn't say we have any did I say that no and we don't do we have any I got my own way of any others no
We don't give crap away on a show anymore sir. We give nothing but pure entertainment the prices right it's free
I
Great music but bubble gum see there's nothing wrong with bubble gum and you're a big thing with the backstreet boys is always
Oh, that's bubble gum. That's for like, you know bad bubble gum wrong
In fact in Billboard magazine last week there's a big piece which you would have agreed with most of it
Where they're talking about the formulas where they have all these groups the five and the 98 whatever they're all
These groups that are like all patterned after whatever the for you know new kids on a block
But there was one before they were created by the same guy right but
And it said the average shelf life is very short not five years like you were saying but like no less than that
But it said the difference between the backstreet boys and all the other groups is that these guys can really sing
Now you can you can sit in there and laugh and puke and let me tell you again
One of them that I would even think about doing okay. They're none of them that look good and there is a one of them that can sing
Oh, now that's see that's it's just ridiculous. You're just a high-end
I thought there are other live thing on Saturday night live
They were groaning and straining and missing the notes that they were all over the place. They couldn't find it with a map
And the notes you told me he can find it
Here's your candle hello
Hello, Neil. Yes sir. Yes, I have a question for you. You really tell me confused
Why is it the one day you're kissing somebody's ass on the radio and then the next day you just rip in their butts right out?
And who would that be sir? Who?
Yes, for example you have Steve King who you always talk trash about right?
But yes, it is that you're okay in my book because he sent me flowers. That's right. I mean that's two face
No, it's not I said that I can't stand exact and he's full of crap
But I appreciate the flowers and he's okay because he's balanced and he's made himself a life not too face
I told it exactly the way I'm always there but you're the same blowing out your ass pal
Blow it right out your little ugly ass. I tell it exactly the way I see it
And when somebody does something goes out of their way to actually spend money to do something nice for me
I appreciate that and if you can't handle that go to hell okay go straight tail
Don't stop in purgatory. Don't stop and see the pope unless you got your lips all greased up
Get out of my face and get back out of banana boat by the way and go back where you came from
Too many people here from the wrong places. That's the problem with this town
Too many people here from the wrong places
Open line and Broward to end date five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line
And they all got an attitude man a every single one of them they got an attitude
Here's a mobile in dear field beach hello
Mobile yes, sir. Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. It's important to tell out here really. Oh beach. I just got down it
I guess you think to say about this body person and everything else. Yeah, listen about this body piercing
You wish you a pool with a ring around this nose get to lead it around. Yeah, that's what it have
You think crop I never saw live the post and it's tongue though. I haven't even bulls aren't that stupid
Okay. Yeah, if you try to stupidly they probably about your fingers off
Tina Turner. Oh, man. I just get a hold of her love because it sounds to me like a bunch of bull crap
Is what it sounds like to me. Okay, we have an open line and Broward to end date five six seven oh five sixty pound five nothing about the body piercing
We don't have it hurt for many but it's got a poet a poet a poet in the and probably because they can't speak
Maybe if he just mumbled a little bit maybe like that and we'll know that you got a post in your tongue and you can't really speak
Oh boy, it's the one to two hour
We're on Jerry. Oh, we're on the right hand of God
I woke up today. I put my TV on and instead of traveling or CNN. I saw purple creature with a gay sign on his head
It wasn't upside down triangle purple thinking wing
Upside down triangle purple thinking wing
Where will just when I thought things couldn't get worse. I know to see was carrying a little
First
I have a round
I
Will most of our Christian times is hard to believe but on the teller tell me something is a TV screen
A purple bean is pointing straight at me that was blowing an eye through the hole in the sink
Oh
You're gonna put him to be boys in the same class with aroismeth
You're comparing Carl Wilson with Steve Tyler
and
You're serious you put them in the same level
Well, their new stuff isn't as good as the old beach boys, but the roll stuff is
You're let me say it again. I just want to make sure I'm understanding what you're saying the beach boys
Yeah, bubble gummy surfing car, living loving eating
Beach boys, you're putting on a musical level with aroismeth sure
Here's a lady mobile in bokeh hello. Hello. Yes, ma'am
I was just gonna tell you that my cousin here is an advantage to it. He's got what pierced my tongue
Oh, you're your tongue. I thought you said your son was pierced
if I could
Your tongue is pierced and what's the advantage?
Well, I got it because it's supposed to enhance the certain sexual situation. Yeah
And because that's the springfield the sister mine. I can tell you my girlfriend agrees that it does work
So there's an advantage to it
Uh, okay, whatever you said
Exactly whatever she said
Here's the fact that says Celine Dion makes me want a puke. I can't stand that frog bitch
Leo de caprio is a huge flaming queen. He's not fooling anybody
But he's fooling a lot of young girls. I'll tell you that. That's what Nick told me
Says when he kissed Kate Winslet and Titanic. I thought it was a lesbian scene
And the movie sucked anyway right on
Wherever you are and then somebody faxes me all of this stuff about Donald Sutherland who was born in St. John
New Brunswick, Canada. They and went to the University of Toronto and
Et cetera. He's okay
Once he was in that JFK thing that room and that rule was in birison. That was really bad. He was great in the
Invasion of the the body snatchers
Is that it? Yeah, and I have the needle
Yeah, I mean he's a good actor, but it's just these commercials. He's a signal the signal health plan
Like the guy with the big lips
We have an open line in the Broward to and date five six seven oh five sixty
Is there anybody in this audience look at the way the lines dropped off as soon as you said that
No seriously, you're not I want to give you the opportunity to change your mind
Okay, right before God man in the audience on this rainy dreadful god because God is gonna punish us any minute if you keep this up
You were serious old beach boys
Forget about old and new okay, I'm just talking as a musical group as talent as a
Force in the music industry as music as sound that's coming out of a thing out of a side
Hall of Fame
With what the 1910 food gum company sure
What did I tell you I?
I knew if I gave him enough rope he would hang in the shelf just dead it in the door new
The beach boys and arrow Smith
Anybody have a heart or a liver?
No
Guns and roses
And
I know that you can love me when there's no one left to blame.
So nevermind this darkness, we still can find a way.
Come on, Christmas is less forever, even call no memory.
Yes, just do!
No memory, welcome!
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
How do we even want this album, big ones, by Erosmith?
I'm just looking at the list of credits on here.
Guess who plays Beratone Sax, Ian Putz.
But seriously, see the thing that you don't understand,
obviously the difference between serious music and fun music.
The Beach Boys music was fun, not serious, but it was very good.
Good, but fun, highly acclaimed and enjoyed by many other people.
No, no, so I didn't like the music.
If I didn't like the Beach Boys, it would be different.
Then I'd have no credibility in this discussion like you with the Backstreet Boys.
But the fact is that to compare serious music like Erosmith with fun music,
again, that was acclaimed because it was good and people liked it and it was memorable.
Latter-day Erosmith is more cookie cutter than the Beach Boys ever would.
So you keep coming back to that latter day, it doesn't make any difference whether it's latter day.
It goes out and does put out a bunch of stuff.
It's just that thing you got with the Mormons again with that latter-day crap.
You just can't get over that.
In addition to which the Beach Boys didn't wear no magic underwear.
Here's Kendall. Hello, I don't think. Hello.
You need a producer that's about 10 years older and that way you can talk about music a little bit more intelligent.
I'm sorry, George. What was the 1910 Frucombe company song that you just met?
Yummy, yummy, yummy.
Oh, that's right. That's right.
I got something bad in my tummy and I think you know, another one's coming soon.
When I was starting out in radio, I was in college radio in the early 80s, then got in the commercial radio,
and now I work in federal radio.
In federal radio?
Yeah, the office of Cuba broadcasting right down the...
Oh my God, I'm an audio martini.
You got it. Yeah.
So I wanted to tell you a story.
Now, I met Brian Wilson's wife.
She used to shop at the supermarket that I worked at Gelsons, which was a market that...
Gelsons?
No, no, no, Gelsons.
It was a market that all the rich people shopped at in in Sino, California.
No matter if that's where the Wilson's were from in Sino and the San Fernando Valley.
And so Brian would come into the supermarket, Gelsons, and he would go to the meat counter.
This is a true story.
I mean, a lot of people don't know that he spent a couple years in bed.
You know, you can say that on the air and it is true.
Oh, it is true.
A lot of people don't know that.
That's any, bro.
Right. Well, anyway, he would come into Gelsons to the supermarket,
and he would walk up to a little drain near the meat department.
You see them at publics and wind dicks either.
Usually drains for the water, drains out of either the meat case or the frozen fruit case.
And he'd take out his little pinky winky and he would go right there.
And I mean, this is an honest to God story.
Oh my God.
Yes, you believe it.
Yes, I believe it.
Okay, and finally, play more market day.
I was lacking, he was lacking in the social raises because he never got out much.
I'm telling you.
I'm telling you.
So I was paying more what?
What?
I was going to say play more market day today, but to anyway.
Well, you know, and then then George would try to tell me that the beach boys would be in the same class with Marvin Gaye.
But you know, it's coming from him.
I just I don't know.
You need to know, but seriously, I mean, he's smirking.
So we I'm giving him time to think about it, but on the face of it, anyone who would say who would categorize the beach boys in the same category with Marvin Gaye would need a lobotomy, would need a musical lobotomy.
Absolutely.
Does he help plan paid for that?
I don't know if it's paid for yet.
Have a great day.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're not responding.
Oh, they're much better than Marvin Gaye.
And this last guy was a suck whole.
What does he know about music just because we saw Brian Wilson, the school, the beach boys were much better than Marvin Gaye.
Yes.
But you got something against gay black people.
I love that.
Yeah.
The beach boys were better than Marvin Gaye.
Their contribution to music guys.
Oh, the head of Marvin Gaye.
You know something Tammy Torello, so pissed off. She's about ready to make a comeback.
That's how pissed off.
You all do respect to Marvin who I loved.
Marvin, you're talking about Marvin, Marvin.
He were no beach boys.
Two open lines.
Thank God.
Two open lines.
Indeed.
5 6 7 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on the 18t.
One of the fun.
Their music was bubble gum.
Good bubble gum.
Enjoyable.
It was fun.
I like it.
I love it.
But to say that it's serious music like Marvin Gaye or Erosmith is to reveal a lack of understanding.
A lack of taste.
So glaring that one might think you were born in a distant barbaric land.
Here is not so distant.
Here is Volka.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
My name is Gary and I've been listening for a long time and I've been even calling and telling you about the funniest show you ever did.
Yeah.
How long ago did you move to plantation?
Years ago.
Many, many years.
Ten years, twelve years.
How long time?
Soon after you moved to plantation, they were delivering furniture to your house.
Do you remember that day?
No.
You had a friend's day and it was sleeping?
Yeah.
That was when I moved to plantation.
I moved to Jacaranda.
I knew you had just moved.
Anyway, you were apoplectic and it was hilarious.
I'd have pulled my car off the road.
It was a funny show you every day.
What a memory.
Anyway, I had to tell you that.
I've been meeting an apoplectic for a while.
Well, you're a little slow, Gary, but better late than ever.
Number two.
Larry, I was always being called Dusty Springfield.
I really loved your music, Dusty, and too late.
Before you leave in three years, I guess I'm better call you.
Number two, you talked about religion a lot lately.
I just wanted to tell you, my feelings about religion coincide pretty much with Woody Allen.
He did a movie years ago and he's sitting on a grassy knoll overlooking a lake and he's discussing religion with his beautiful girl.
How old are you about ten?
No, it's just a little older.
He says, well, I don't really believe in organized religion, but I believe there's an intelligent force that prevents the universe except for parts in certain parts in New Jersey.
But I would just like to mend that and say, except for certain parts of sunrise and Delray Beach.
Okay, Gary. Come in 12 years.
Take this back.
Okay.
This man has just said that the Beach Boys are in the same level with Aerosmith and Marvin Gaye.
And I have an open line on the board.
We should have a backup.
They should blow the lines out on the phone bank right now.
This for any kind of a town.
I just... I can't believe I heard it with my own ears.
The one I'm talking to.
The only choreo was a song.
Oh, so in other words, writing the song is what makes you a great singer.
No, singing makes you good singer. Writing makes you good writer.
Yeah, we're not talking about writers. We're talking writers invented music.
Yeah.
Anyone that supports this is.
There's something...
Voice is a retirement zone.
So what we see on the dozen write music, therefore, is the dime a dozen.
And we see the difference.
And we see the difference.
You're right. There is definitely something in this building.
Make no mistake about it.
God.
If he didn't grind his...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
If he didn't grind his what?
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Neil, you are God.
Yes, you're so wrong.
How about a road?
How about that?
DJ's Beach Boys.
The Beach Boys.
Yeah, now we know where this guy is coming from.
Beach Boys versus Erasmus.
Not even a comparison.
You're right.
There is no comparison.
You're right.
I'll give you three reasons why.
Number one.
Brian Wilson and Michael have put together couldn't lick Stevie Towers' ass.
All right. All right.
How many number one songs do the Beach Boys have versus Erasmus?
Erasmus has one number one song.
They only have one?
Only one.
That was that one from the bottom.
We're going to base our...
No, that's not true at all. Are you out of your mind?
No, I just saw it on behind the music the other night.
They said that was their only number one song ever.
I'll find out because I have the book there.
I don't even have any of that pieces to say what's the number one.
Just to know.
I got the book here.
I'll tell you how many number one songs.
See, I don't think...
While you're looking at sports holes, we have an estate editor just open up a mouth.
I'm looking at sometimes having an idea what I'm talking about.
While you're looking at that up, I'll give you another reason.
Yeah.
Beach Boys experimented with different sounds and created new music.
What did Harrison ever create that was different from what was already out?
Beach Boys did harmonies that had never been done.
They did tape, they overdubbed four and five part harmonies that had never been done before.
You know, they were interfated.
People got to number three.
The creative this, they didn't have any number one record.
So the one you're talking about from Margaret Gettin is the only one.
It was on Margaret Gettin and that came out after that.
Right, after the book.
So Beach Boys had at least ten number one.
What does that mean?
Elvis Presley had more number one records than both of them together.
Are you going to tell me Elvis Presley was better than the Beach Boys and Errol Smith?
Yes.
Because he had more number one record.
Elvis Presley was one of the top three figures of music of all time.
But that doesn't mean vanilla ice cream is the best selling flavor of all time.
But that doesn't make it the best.
Don't you understand?
I don't listen to vanilla ice.
Okay, thanks.
Ah!
It's the film everyone wants to see.
Vanilla ice dies along.
Bloody agonizing, Satanic death.
The movie.
See, I've dropped from an 18 story building.
Beatin and Mug, by homeless people.
Just get the phone, break the faith.
Oh my God!
Run over by a milk truck and club the death by a group of angry seventh graders
while being forced to listen to his own music.
No, I mean, you do suck.
Vanilla ice dies along.
Bloody agonizing, Satanic death.
The movie.
See former surgeon general, see if it could extract the ice band's tongue and save the world.
Change shall it says.
It's the failed good movie of the 90s.
Vanilla ice dies along.
Bloody agonizing, Satanic death.
The movie.
A cheesy T-N-I-L production.
Tarika loves to watch boobs and butts and biting.
Oh, black.
The movie.
The movie.
The movie.
The movie.
The movie.
The movie.
The movie.
The movie.
The movie.
The movie.
The movie.
The movie.
The movie.
The movie.
How's it hanging Brendan?
How's this hanging?
You know that thing that got in Jersey?
The Brendan Brewners Expressway,
it's a 131 at 560 WQM, we have an open line to date.
560, 560, that last guy boy that was giving me a song and an answer all the beat's boys number one hits,
etc and so on.
Well, I mean if you're going to go based on the charts,
And then he's don't need it.
Huh?
It's don't mean it.
And then he told me that Elvis Presley was better than the Beach Boys Aero Smith.
And I like Elvis.
I like most of his music like I've said before.
I don't have a blow up doll.
I will not be going to Graceland any time this year.
It's not my agenda.
But I mean, again, it's the most ludicrous comparison.
It's like saying that Elvis Presley was better than Fats Domino.
What?
No way.
Not even in the same.
I can't agree.
Fats Domino is sensational.
One of the all-time best in the originator.
No Beach Boys, by the way.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I have to agree partially with George.
This way it goes.
Yeah.
Beach Boys.
Then Marvin Gaye.
Then Elvis Presley.
Then Aero Smith.
Yeah.
Aero Smith.
Early Aero Smith.
All he did was copy the stones and Aero Smith sucks.
They have nothing to do with the rolling stone.
Oh, they were America.
They tried to be America's little version of the rolling stones.
It's the way he did not.
Even his stage, you know, whatever.
I don't say you tried to act like me.
Why?
Because he's got big lips.
So that means he was trying to be Mick Jack.
No, he tried to move like him.
He tried to think like him.
I don't agree with you.
Neil, you're wrong.
OK.
He's wrong, sir.
I have the buzzer.
Open line today 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line.
I mean, and again, like the stones OK.
Would that concert this weekend?
The stones, you know, geriatric tour in sunrise.
As they come out with the walkers and the canes
and they'll be wheeling them out there and all of the, you know,
if that's what you like more power to you, you're living in the past.
But again, to compare the rolling stones with arrow smith.
To me, it's laughable.
It's ridiculous.
It's a joke.
Newly like comparing a saline Dion with the dusty Springfield.
Canes must match you by the way.
I think Ann Marie still got it.
Here's a mobile and four lot of Dale.
Hello.
Yeah, hi Neil.
What did you get hit by a puck last night?
George is right.
Where do you get bubble gum music from the Beach Boys?
They're both great bands.
Where do I get it?
Yeah, right out of the TV.
It's a light, light music.
It's not like, I love it.
Don't get me wrong.
I like the music, but it's not serious music.
Well, yeah, and of course the arrow smith made a song called paint.
That's a real serious.
That was a piece of crap.
Well, I just like Pokemon.
Do you like Pokemon?
No, not really.
No, there you go.
No, no, no.
You name me any group, any artists that never made a clunker and I'll listen.
Right.
I mean, anybody's capable of a clunker.
But you judge an arrow smith by pink rhymes with no, not not not not all.
I'm just saying.
So what does that mean?
Beach Boys were real great, feel good music.
Some serious answers, but that was almost as serious.
What was serious?
Name a serious song?
Oh, what?
Oh, yeah, this vibration.
Thank you too many too many nights listening to air in summers.
I think it's your problem, sir.
Good vibrations.
My ass.
Or your round breaking history making.
Got the Beatles on the phone calling.
You know something thinking they're cool.
The Beatles were doing mushrooms again at the time.
Let me just tell you this.
Good vibrations isn't even one of their better songs.
Okay, it's not like.
Like I'm just on this one CD.
409 is good vibration.
This good is 409.
No as good as God only knows.
No, here's the song that wasn't even a hit.
Okay, wasn't even a hit that they get that they gave the Jan and Dean who couldn't
sing the way out of a paper box and Brian Wilson and then Mike love wrote most of the music
for Jan and Dean.
Here's the song that was ripped off under a sidewalk surf and was the name by Jan and Dean.
Get your way.
Great.
It was like on the beach side of Beachwood or your school or something like that.
Great.
A million times better than that.
Good bye, great.
Yes.
Well, we don't stop.
10 million times good.
You've battled out, turned around and raised and baby.
That's all there is to the combined grace you got to.
All right.
I just heard my daughter.
Oh, by the way, speaking of Jan and Dean.
It's on here.
Wait a minute.
Talk about a flagrant rip off.
It's not like they stole it.
They just gave him the music and they said, okay, here try and do something with this.
Okay?
You four bastards because one of you are going to be in a real bad car crash and you need the
money.
Tell us.
Oh, see you.
I just tried to do that photo.
That's the worst you ever heard your life.
Maybe what do I got to car crash?
Oh, I just said that.
You can't.
When you got to go that's not your view.
You'll probably feed it if you get serious.
Try to suit.
Choose.
It is.
Man.
Could they sing or what that Jan and Dean, huh?
Here's four latter day.
Hello?
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I was calling about the beach boy state.
yes i think that uh... they were pretty influential on the right yes
uh... in the middle of the day
i'm not doubting that they were influential that they were great that they
were like uh... all of these things
that make a more important
i'm not discussing who's more important discussing whose music was better
sir
yeah i'm still here
yeah
i don't think that i'll smith music is very important
i mean influence
air is not an important group
arosmith is a groundbreaking group
groundbreaking yes
what song is this groundbreaking all of the early songs were groundbreaking
you name them
all the early songs what are the that was what one album to album
and
i think that the beach boys had more than that
yeah and then and let me ask you this
since since you know i mean again i shouldn't be on the defense of because i
like the beach boys
but like surf in safari surfer girl surf in u.s.a
do you want to dance uh... dance dance
you can take all of these different records and you can take ninety percent
of them can get them down to the same three songs
they were groundbreaking and
i think they're not you're not responding to what i just said because you know
it's true
and i like every one of the song ninety nine percent other than coke a
mall
i don't think the beach boys ever made a record i didn't like ninety eight percent
i liked okay
but the most of them were the same
i understand that
yeah i mean i understand a lot of music
so what they're going to create a bunch of volume of album
they started making music with different types of instruments and
right changing the face of music
i understand that but i'm talking about the music itself
i'm not you know how about less polonry for
that's before by time
okay thank you
how about gogi grand in the wayward wind with the phasing huh and say you know
you're laughing but i'm serious
that was one of the first right of the big hurt by Tony Fisher those were some
of the earliest records where they did phasing and music
but you know
anybody here know about less polonry for it no but let's talk about other than us
no
but they're all music experts
and let me say it again
surfe i mean you can look down the list
ninety five percent of them are the same
song will have
give you that
like i said 78 percent
thirty three
forty five rpm
why are you airing like this
long
it is a thing

I've been playing music a long time and Steve, when we were in high school, we had those
mixers.
He used to do the Mick Jagger thing a long time ago, but he got teased a lot and everything.
He's a really great guy.
As far as the comparison, there is not yet.
It's ridiculous.
Okay, hang on.
George, I'll give you the address and you can zip it over here.
Yeah.
And the picture is too.
Okay, we have an open line in date 56670560.
Here's a crawl springs.
Hello.
Yeah, guys.
I don't know what George has been eating for lunch, but I don't know.
He's about the beach boys.
They're kids music.
They have no content to beach boys.
Yeah, hard.
You know, great harmonies and you know, and it's like there's been a chipmunk roll.
They have nothing to say.
The chipmunks add a little bit slower RPM.
They're like the chipmunks at 42 RPM.
That's right.
They were great, but the chipmunks, good comparison.
I like that.
I like that.
You know, they have little content in their music there.
And I like Marvin Biggay because you know, it gets me late.
Okay.
Well, there's Marvin Gaye.
Oh, you're comparing the beat twice with this.
I can't believe it.
He's going back to that same stupid crap.
We're not understanding about that.
About writers, about Bach and Beethoven.
We're talking about singers, people who made music.
Who were still mal music.
They follow instruction.
They make music.
Okay.
You can have all the instructions in the world.
Unless you've got the vocal abilities, you can give the same.
You could give Jan and Dean.
There's a classic example.
The same music is Brian Wilson.
And they still can't make music because they can't sing.
And you could give.
Here's a good example.
You could give Ricky Martin with all the respect.
How good they made him look.
How they did that.
I only wish I knew.
You could give him the same music as they give to Luis Miguel.
Okay.
And I'm sure his Spanish is impeccable, almost as good as his English.
Could Ricky Martin make the same music that Luis Miguel makes?
No.
No.
Yeah.
I feel so weak.
I feel just so.
That's what I was thinking of.
Week.
The both of them.
Week.
Luis Miguel is weak.
He's got a good voice.
But he'd be nothing without songwriters.
What would he say?
If you ever saw Luis Miguel in concert, which you won because you're a hard-hearted
speaker.
I saw clips of it.
No, no, no.
If you ever saw him live.
Like you were right there.
Like I was three different times.
Once in Vegas and twice here.
And you saw him sing and sing everything perfectly and never miss a note and just do things
with his voice that nobody could dream of doing.
You wouldn't be saying all these things.
You wouldn't even be thinking.
All of these things.
Right.
But you're just saying it to be a little Ojón provocador.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, right.
You're not fooling us because nobody's that dumb.
Here is the Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Fort Lauderdale.
Neil God.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I kind of agree with the call that was saying that the beach voice were more influential.
But I mean, as far as something I like personally, harassment.
Yeah.
But if you want to get to the root of where they come from.
Let's get to the root.
Yeah, listen to their own words.
Steven Tyler and Joe Perry admit that what they are a knockoff of is of Led Zeppelin.
Yeah.
That's all they are.
Well, okay, that I can handle, but not the Rolling Stones.
Oh, well, the Rolling Stones, of course, they made their influence too.
But now you're right.
They're walking around and walkers are there.
And if you want to listen, you want to listen to some real ass kicking stuff.
Yeah.
Let's have them, man.
Okay.
All right.
So yeah.
Okay, here's a medley of their hit, by the way.
And you know what we're forgetting in the midst of all of this?
More influential today than all the groups that have been mentioned put together.
Yeah.
Come on, let's hear it.
Get ready for tonight at the Master Ray.
Come on.
Let's go.
This is it.
Forget about the Beast Boys.
Marvin Gaye, Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, the Thone.
Forget about all these mediocre groups, okay?
Let's get with the heavy-duty stuff.
Heavy-duty.
Come on.
It's only a four-hour show.
Let's go.
Oh, listen to that.
Rosie and the original.
She'll be the sour, sour, old.
And oh, God.
I'm crazy.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Thank you.
