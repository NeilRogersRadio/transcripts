No, go ahead.
Sports radio 5.6.
How was that?
QAMF-ME 4.5, they'll present the NEAL ROCK show to talk to NEAL called.
It's a holiday. We don't take it on track.
6.5, 3, 4, 8, and Bravert.
More pound 5.60 on your cell phone.
The other is a clean-up track.
No, no, no.
They will tell some of the shows and not necessarily reflect those of WQAM.
Be safe in that position for the easily brought-up.
No, NEAL ROCK show on Sports Radio 5.6.
QAMF-ME 4.5, it's Friday, you bastard.
Free drugs.
Tonight I have free drugs.
Two-two-parta-take.
Two-two-parta-take.
It's bust. The longest tool.
The highest tool.
The smaller tool, my fellow Americans, I stand before you tonight.
Parta-growing.
Parta-expanying.
Parta-growing.
I reach out line.
Tool to all of you.
A ROCK-solid.
Parta-growing.
Free drugs.
Tonight I have free drugs.
Two-two-parta-take.
Two-two-parta-take.
And ask that we join together and sign to the American people.
Take it.
Oh, God.
You know, right there, in how long was that, the 39 seconds, was more entertainment than I've
heard all morning long?
Now, that's not for our morning show.
I haven't been listening.
Then, of course, I never do.
But I mean, I made a bad mistake this morning, which I'll never make again.
Well, never say never, because I said that once before.
Well, I got sucked in, you know?
And I must have been the only one that got sucked in by the hype.
No, I listened also.
Oh, God.
If there's anybody that tried to call Rick and suds this morning, please call in.
If there's anybody that tried to call him and to talk about that OJ thing,
see, because I know that they do that real heavy screening.
I hate talk stations where they do heavy screening.
That's what makes it boring, including on a sports show.
What do you want to talk about?
What's your shoe size?
And do you agree with the host?
And do you have any idea what you're talking about?
And, you know, what a bunch of crap that is.
And, again, keep in mind that I'm saying one of the most desperate publicity stunts in the history of broadcasting.
Stupid talk radio.
Did I say that right?
Radio.
It's done this OJ thing now.
And, of course, there must be just a coincidence that they did it after I talked two days ago about the fact that
Roy Foster was desperately trying to get his good buddy.
Roy!
Okay, in here.
Yeah.
So I first discovered this in the paper on page 2A in a hero this morning, open up my paper, the inside second page.
By the way, some really bad chronics there at the end of the morning show on this station.
That Mark Guy, whatever that guy's name was.
Oh, do you hear that one?
That voice.
I mean, you are so chronic, Mr. It just makes me want to barf.
I almost had a bad night here in the chair.
I almost had a Randy Rhodes in the chair.
I almost had a Roy Foster who had bloody oozing, oozing stools right here in the chair after hearing that voice.
Talk about chronic.
But anyway, so I've turned to page 2A because I always check out those little columns.
I mean, I have a certain way of reading the newspapers, which you can do in this town in about the 17 minutes.
Read both papers, cover to cover in about like six minutes.
In about 17 seconds.
So anyway, it says, but does he want to tell you since OJ Simpson is shopping for Diggs and South Florida radio station W.I.N.Z.
AM super talk 940.
Yes, I'm giving you a lot of publicity again.
Okay, guys, it worked.
There you go.
Don't help.
Stupid talk 940.
You seem fit to offer him a radio gig from 10 a.m. to noon weekdays to tell his new neighbors his side of the story.
If he's got the guts, we've got the Mike says John Ford super talk radio, the assistant program director, the pay a thousand dollars a day.
Now stop and think about that.
Do you know anybody in this business on the year who gets paid by the day?
Anybody ever hear of that?
No.
Get paid by the day?
No.
So in other words, they also said that they were willing to give him the thousand bucks or the charity his favorite charity of his choice.
So we guess they figured that maybe it might not last like a whole day.
Like maybe 10 to 11 would be like $500.
10 to 10, 15 would be like $250, $125.
Something like that.
Can you imagine the phone calls?
This is a guy that's going to do a talk show.
I can just hear in fact I guarantee I know what the first call would be because I would make it because I would take off sick that day.
And by the way, bring him on guys.
Yeah.
I can just see the headline after the next rating book right now.
Rogers kills OJ.
Rogers buries the juice.
Yeah, I can see it now.
I mean, are you kidding?
Are you people out of your minds?
Is that your problem over there?
How about desperate?
Is that bring about desperate?
I mean, so I turn on channel surfing this morning and lucky me channel 4 news.
730.
And there's the whole story.
Thank God you people.
Our channel 4 news are smart enough not to get sucked into a stupid publicity stunt by stupid talk radio.
Radio.
Thank God you're sharpened up.
Nothing gets sucked in on that.
And they're doing a lot of guys over there and he's holding the mic.
Oh, you know, he's making props for this story.
Yeah, if OJ's got the time, they've got the microphone and they got the $1,000 a day and all this other crap.
Welcome to the interview Peter Bolcher.
Because what does he know about radio?
I didn't I didn't see them interview.
I mean, they picked the assistant out there.
Quote him.
Why not be assistant Bob?
Maybe Peter Bolcher was too embarrassed.
Although I doubt that he has much of an embarrassment factor.
But even he probably was too embarrassed to go on there and admit that this desperate.
And of course, he probably could always deny that he had anything to do with it when the sponsor is starting and canceling left and right.
Saying, OJ's got to be on your station.
Okay, we're crossing you assholes off the list.
Although it sounds to me like they already most of them have.
So I get sucked in myself in this morning for the first time in a long.
I'm having trouble staying awake right now.
I got to be honest with you.
I'm serious.
I'm going to comb.
I feel like Rip Fan Winkle.
Would you like some Dunkin' Donuts coffee?
No thanks.
I don't want to get that hyper.
In fact, the Dunkin' Donuts.
It was very delicious.
Thank you very much.
But that breakfast, the sausage and bacon and cheese and that whole thing that I had.
That's why I'm so lethargic.
I don't eat breakfast.
Do I ever eat that early?
No.
And I had my blood sugar this morning with 97.
Pretty good.
I like that.
That was a nice number.
I bet you right now we wouldn't want to take it.
Not that anybody cares.
I'm not looking for sympathy.
I didn't ask for it.
George offered it and I said, okay.
The Dunkin' Donuts people.
I don't want to get on their bad side.
And we'll screw up with a free food for the morning team.
But stop feeding me stuff that I don't need.
Not that early in the morning.
Okay.
In addition to which, why did they have to make like 85 layers of it?
And I told them to.
Yeah, well that's your fault.
Of course, George now is like, you know, waiting in the wings.
He's just flitting around in the wings.
Oh, by the way, you'll be pleased to know those of you who wait George like poison
that Monday be in a holiday.
I won't be here, of course.
And he won't either.
Let's play a Gepher Show.
Yes, the Gephermer and the O.J. Simpson Show.
Let's see which one pisses you off first the most.
No, it's going to be a tape.
And Robert Grimrober will be here.
We may hear the same spot eight or nine times, but Robert will be here on Monday.
Isn't that wonderful?
You'll hear a tape.
For those of you who wait George, whatever his name is, George.
It's either one of the.
And Joe.
So anyway, I get sucked into tuning into this morning to a stupid talk to Rick and Suds for the first time.
And a long, long, long time.
Because they got really, oh, Rick talking about the stock market.
And fair value is minus two.
Oh, geez.
Doing his minute, his poor man CNBC imitation.
So I listened leaving the house and I listened even right here.
We have our little radio that our good friend David Gravy lined up.
That's when we first moved over here.
I didn't hear them talking about it.
I heard one stupid promo on there saying W are they don't use the callators.
That's another brilliant move.
Stupid talk right radio.
The new home of O.J. Simpson, maybe.
Did I hear a call about it?
No.
Did I hear them talking about it?
No.
So maybe we can get some spy reports.
I must have missed something.
Is it conceivable that it was on television and in the newspaper and that nobody called about it?
No.
Is it more likely that maybe they were screening out of anybody they wanted to talk about it?
Really?
I don't know.
I don't want to assume anything.
All I know that Rick, I'm serious.
I know it's a holiday weekend and it's a dog, dog days and everything.
But the hour and a half I invested in my life this morning, I could have been pulling hairs out of my nose.
I could have been picking seeds out of my...
Rectome.
...had a more productive morning.
I mean guys, I know everybody needs to eat.
I wish you nothing but the best, especially sobs in Adam.
But oh my god, radio and this market is so bad.
Maybe O.J. might be at least something.
Huh?
Like the final, final nail in their coffin.
Sounds like to me.
Bring him on.
I bet you he could be almost as big as Sandy Payton and that bitch, that babbling brook.
Put together.
We'll get some spy reports on that.
I guarantee you.
So I'll be here at one o'clock today.
George will be on it.
What from Monday to two for those who hate George just to make up for the fact that he won't be on on Monday.
Isn't that why you're doing it?
Oh yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
Piss off the people that hate you like poison.
Ten minutes after ten at five, 60 WQAM.
And unsuabbing of two.
What do you care?
What you care?
What you care?
What you care?
What?
What you care?
What you care?
What you care?
What you care?
What you care?
No matter how hard I try, don't understand why this is why I do care.
It's just a hot topic today.
People still bring their soup cans, with drawing money from their veins.
You're such a bunch of silly, deep, acting like paranoia treats all.
Do you believe in what you care?
No.
I feel some things that would say, I really don't need to hide and pray no.
Do you believe in what you care?
I feel some things that would say, I really don't need to hide and pray no.
15-550, your indigestion station for the 90s, WQAM, we got to, what do we got today?
Hank Goldberg at 2 here in the studio again?
Is that possible? Hank's gonna have to end the building two days in a row.
We got talking baseball with Donnie B. at 6 o'clock to fill up a half hour before the Marlon pregame show.
The reds here in Miami to play the Marlon tonight at 7 o'clock.
Any interest?
No.
Okay.
So I was talking about shameless publicity stunts.
I'll give you one that was even worse, which is your Georgian I was discussing this morning in a moment.
Waterdale by the sea. Hello?
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Oh, yeah, I caught the beginning of the show with the stats.
Yes.
Before the show started, they played the promo about that.
And the stats came on and they were gonna stay the shock.
They weren't informed of it ahead of time.
And they couldn't get a hold of anybody in the management.
And they said, love it said basically that they would walk if such a thing happened.
They actually said that?
Yeah.
All right, let's hear it for a short time.
Oh, even Rick.
And they took like two cars on it.
One guy was like said it would be okay because everybody could tell him off.
And the other car said that John Ford should quit listening to you Neil.
Yeah, exactly.
That's right.
Hey, how you doing, John?
You asked all we know you're listening.
And they listened.
They admit that everybody over there listens to the show every single day.
Wolzer's listening right now.
That little pussilanimous puts John Ford is listening right now.
At Super Talk Radio, who's still doing stuff from the 50s.
The 1850s.
And Rick said that, yeah, that is, is it that obvious?
Of course, about that.
But you ignorant slut.
Yeah.
Oh, and then they finally, they decided to just ignore it and hope that it would just go away.
So that's why they didn't.
Well, I got news for it.
True, it would have been a lot more exciting than the crap they were talking about this morning.
I, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah, I'll think that they would not...
Maybe I just caught up on a bad day.
I realized it's a holiday weekend.
That was the most terminal, almost two hours that I ever...
And I kept waiting specifically.
I tweeted in for a specific reason.
And I didn't even hear that.
I heard about evil, con evil, and some stunt gone bad.
And then I heard a lot of rambling about Disney World.
I heard three phone calls.
And that was it.
And like two hours.
What kind of a show is that?
I think maybe just they couldn't get home with management.
They didn't know what was going on.
They didn't want it.
They didn't want to get into it.
Maybe without knowing what they were doing.
Oh, I take back what I said.
In other words, they didn't grow a pair.
Okay, I take that.
We track that.
I'm just guessing.
Because if Rick really grew a pair, I'd be shocked.
I'd be really shocked.
Thank you so very much.
God bless you.
See, there's a spy report.
We got a big crossover with Rick and Spud's Zulling.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
That one guy.
Hey, we'll get some others.
Maybe they weren't screening out anybody.
Maybe just nobody cares.
You know what?
I didn't see any tremendous response here a couple of days ago.
When I was getting all bent out of shape about, you know who?
Roll!
I want to mention his name on here.
567-0560-050 on the mobile one line.
Before we go into that other thing about the broad
with the Hershey kisses.
Oh, man.
You veteran the old IOD listeners.
I'm going to tell you that day.
That was the most disgusting and grotesque.
I mean, we all get desperate in this business.
I get desperate here every day because I'm talking to a bunch of dead people
in a place where the average age is 200.
What do you expect?
But I mean, sometimes you do things that are so, so patently,
obviously desperate at anybody else's expense.
That's the thing.
Why do something at somebody else's expense?
It's like calling somebody an asshole.
Would I ever do that?
No.
No.
Would I call John Ford an asshole?
No.
No, even though of course he is.
Everybody knows he is.
But I call Pete Boulder an assassin, a backstabbing,
life-destroying piece of turd.
Would I do that?
No.
No.
Even though everybody over there and everybody in the market knows that he is.
I hope he has a lot of sleepless nights.
Here's a traffic report in Pembroke Pines.
I bet it's about how it's in Pembroke Pines.
Hello?
Neil, it's on Northbound on 95.
Right north of the Pembroke Road exit.
It is or lanes of 95 are blocked.
Everybody out there and somebody got hurt.
It's a big deal.
Everybody should just watch out for going north on 95.
South of Pembroke Road there.
Okay.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
God bless you.
There you go.
See, it's a holiday weekend.
I heard about the thing on the, was it the Georgia Tuttle?
And now we got I-95 and we got all kinds of crap going on.
Because you people are out of control.
It's not even there officially the holiday weekend yet.
It's only Friday morning and already we got people out of control.
I noticed coming to work this morning.
It was kind of light.
I thought most everybody was out of pound by now.
At least I was hoping.
I would have thought anybody would have brain would already be out of this God for a second place.
So we'll tell them I still doing here.
Well, what a clock I'll be gone.
Long gone.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.
I hate to break the news to you Rick, but not a big crossover here with this show.
Not a big crossover with that stupid talk.
It probably I'll listen to Dr. Laura right now.
Bitch out all the men.
Custom out that man hitting piece of turd.
Not that I would attack Dr. Laura you understand because that would be an act of desperation in my part.
Here's Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Yes.
You know I'm winning your crossovers.
Okay.
For the processor.
Those glory days back in the IOD now we got to jump around the dial to get everybody.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Get a good amount of computer to hear him.
Are you?
Yeah.
Yeah, but wait a minute.
Who said Phil Henry wouldn't be on QAM, right?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
I know Rick in his car is truck right now.
Is this way to his computer store?
And I'm sure he allowed to listen to this show.
I know that.
I know that.
I know that the Rick was allowed to listen.
I think it's the only station his radio actually gets.
Hey Rick, how's it going?
Got that tree.
Yeah.
He's got to get you out of his system though.
He actually said he actually said this morning.
Okay, our poll question for the day is.
Oh no.
He's doing a poll question.
Yes.
And by the way, I don't want to spend a lot of time with Rick and Sus, but I will anyway.
I like, you know, it's the first time I've listened a long time.
They played a bit at eight o'clock.
They played that old Sally Stru, this bit, you know, which is older than Mathusela.
And then they come out of the nine o'clock news break and they're playing beer is good for you for the 80s.
They would be like, if I played a bridge dinner every goddamn day.
I mean, after all this time, when you think they had something new and different.
Yeah.
Well, you did miss.
You were sleeping, I guess, during the B.O.J.
It was like from six o'clock seven to about four.
Next thing will be playing my stuff like, like that.
That was good.
Or like, yeah, more like that.
Yeah, I think the reason it thanks doing doing more in studio things now.
Yeah, like he's getting down to where he can like get through the door and get inside.
Yeah, that might be it.
So he's going inside more.
Okay.
Thank you, Sus.
Thanks for the good news.
Whatever you say.
Yes.
I had a good point yesterday about this thing with the bluff getting the employee of the month.
And these idiotic lines in this thing that Greg rewrites out in this memo again,
sometimes insurmountable odds and in the face of severe adversity.
That's right.
The severe adversity, Hank is absolutely right, is that we did it, not Duff, but we did it.
We made the big ratings with no promotion, no publicity, no assistance, no equipment that works most of the time.
And speaking of Hank being out on a road to one of the show, there's nothing wrong with that except that about 90% of the time.
The ISD end breaks down and we can't get him on the year for the first 20 minutes.
And the whole show is, am I on the year?
Are we on the air?
He's not on the year that, you know, every day.
So yeah, there's severe adversity.
All right, because we want to work for a bunch of cheap actors.
Not that I care you understand.
I want you to get the feel I've lost to that loving feeling because I haven't.
I couldn't care less as long as the checks keep coming.
What I've seen in this place, man, I could write volumes about.
And it's obviously not anybody is going to change this.
God, Jesus, Moses, Charlton, Heston, themselves couldn't come in here and change this joint.
So why don't I tell you what I waste my time?
Here's Hollywood. Hello.
Ogunillo.
Yes, sir.
How are you, sir?
I'm great.
I'm another one of the crossovers.
I'm ready now.
I listen to, by the way, you need to think of Ron and Ron for going on the year, several years ago,
because that's one of the reasons why I was in to find you about five or six years ago.
Neil Rogers.
Todd.
Yeah.
And, um, so yeah, I do listen to Rick and Todd and, um,
I'm still in the audience.
I'm still in the audience.
I'm sorry, I'm really nervous.
Why is that?
And I do remember that you're in the fat bitch.
What is it?
I do remember finished the story about the fat bitch with the Hershey kisses.
That's, yeah, that to me was the worst exploitation, even worse than this OJ stunt,
they're trying to pull over there, which is going over like a pregnant pole vaulter, by the way.
That was pretty sad and, uh, one wasn't just said, but if you could have seen it, and I don't know if you remember,
George reminded me this morning, here's this 800 pound elephant poor lady who's addicted to sugar,
who's like killing herself on food, and they bring her in there to see how many Hershey kisses she can eat.
And I walk in there and I reach out to get one, only one.
And she grabbed a hold of my hand with a claw like fist.
And I'm going to tell you, I, uh, Primo Carnera himself could never have had a stronger grip than this bitch.
I mean, she was there.
That's why she, that's why she's, why her, she's kiss you, bastard.
Uh, one really quick thing, um, by the way, you show yesterday was the best, uh, as they all are,
and about, uh, the, uh, no promotion for your radio station.
I, I think, uh, I also work in corporate America, where you would think that if you do things like promote
and do things that make sense, that's how your company makes more money.
Although, uh, Nioh, I have to tell you, uh, all sports radio is really tough to get a hold of you.
When I call, every time I call, I'm always up against the break and on the phone for quite a while.
You're the one I call right now. You're it. You're a medley of our call.
That's it. You're the only call I got.
Uh, by the way, um, that bitch that comes on on WIOD with the funny laugh.
Yeah. I hate her. I really do.
Yeah.
You was on the air before.
The one that's got 8.00 minus three. That one.
Yeah. You used to listen to her. Yeah.
A long time ago, but I can't do it.
I really can't. I'm not a rip out of it because it's not my style.
She's a disgusting talentless bitch. She really is.
And have a great day, sir.
Thank you.
Great holiday to you.
Okay. Watch out for all the crazy people with a traffic out there.
Okay. It's obviously a very, I mean, there're going to be a lot of people going to die this holiday weekend.
I want to sound like one of those corny radio people.
All you little kids out there like Don Cherry does.
Oh, by the way, the least lost last night. I mentioned that in passing.
Lost the game. Okay. The people in there. Oh, gee, you must be psychotic.
Yeah. My life is turning into ashes because the maple leaves lost the game left.
It's one game. Okay.
Had a couple of defensemen who wanted to talk Christmas was coming early.
They give for after a couple of goals for the sabers and said, oh, here you go.
Here's the puck. Have a good time with it. And at the end of that game. Okay.
One game.
These buffalo people like Pat Quinn says what about the sourpuses, huh?
And at hash, you can get 20 years for overacting for that performance.
Like every time somebody breathed on him, I was falling.
Oh, he's. And finally, even Carrie Fraser with a bad hairdo said, give me a break.
Cut the crap. Okay. Cut the overacting, man.
This team takes more dives than Greg Lucenas, the sabers team.
1026 at 560 WQM.
Ever discussed this out of here?
This is going in slow to know that's what's going on.
Oh, man.
Yeah, let me help you adjust that.
Oh, I'm sorry. 1031.
Well, I didn't even do it. It's Friday. You were still.
Look, I wanted to play this one more time just in case they missed the beginning of the jump.
Three drugs.
Tonight I have three drugs.
Two tools, two, pardon.
Take it. Two tools, two, pardon.
Take it. But the longest tool, the highest tool, the smaller tool of my fellow Americans,
I stand before you tonight. Part of growing.
Part of expanding. Part of rising.
I reach out my tool to all of you.
A rock solid. Part of.
Part of.
Three drugs. Tonight I have three drugs.
Two, two, pardon.
Take it.
Two, two, pardon.
Take it.
And ask that we join together and say into the American people.
Take it.
1032 at 560 WQM.
I could just play that for the whole three hours and be more entertaining than the crap I heard this morning.
You know what I'm saying?
Like a-
Like a service announcement about Sally Struthers.
Like that.
Oh, I just- I couldn't believe it.
I couldn't believe my ears because they play like very little stuff and they got a whole DCS full of old stuff,
most of which is ours but nevertheless.
I mean, you know, next thing you know you'll be hearing stuff like-
And they're show, you know.
That was devastating.
I mean, I'm glad that they're working and that Rick talked his way into a-
You know, into a job there at a much reduced salary but nevertheless, you know, we all got to eat.
That's fine.
We all got to put those breakfast patties on the table.
But that was-
Terminal was really bad.
And the OJ thing obviously, nice going John Ford.
Nobody here cares.
Nobody over there cares.
They didn't even talk about it.
But what does that tell you?
I'm not so sure whether that's good or bad.
But again, that's part of software.
It's part of the mentality.
There's no outrage.
There's no passion, you know.
Maybe nobody watches Channel 4.
And maybe nobody reads the hurled.
Although somebody, one of our very, very chronic factors,
facts that to me after I had already mentioned it on the year, the thing about them.
OJ, if you want the balls, we got the microphone.
Is nobody said something like that on Super Talk radio?
Why is there so much bad, bad radio in this country and in this market in particular?
This is such a bad, bad, bad.
Are you positive that this is one of the all-time worst?
It's amazing that we do as well as we do because you would have thought by now
there would have been a lot of people took their radios and just threw them in the dumpster.
Just out of sheer disgust.
I mean FM radio, we already know absolutely blows here.
The music is the worst.
Just go get you one of those CD burners and just have a party to your heart's content.
You know, put all the stuff you like on CD and the hell of the radio.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 50.
I told you it was going to be like this, didn't I?
Really slow.
I would have thought that just the Rick and Tudz crossover, we could have killed at least two and a half hours with that.
Here's Miami. Hello.
Hello, Nino.
Yes.
I took the opportunity to give you a call when we were having no calls.
No, you're in.
Get it. I got in right on.
You're in, sir.
Yeah, thanks.
It's a holiday weekend.
Like I said, anybody with a brain, they're out of here already.
They're long gone.
They are far away.
Jill, you don't have a brain wrong side.
I would be out of here.
Me too.
Hey, listen, I found that you were worse radio.
You're right. Radio here is bad.
Pretty bad.
But, look Daniel, I listen to what I said.
Let me be objective.
Let me listen to it.
Yeah.
You talk about how bad he is.
I had to turn it off.
Seriously, I'm dead here.
That's why I've never been afraid to promote people on other stations because I know that when you
turn it in the first time, you're like, you're going to be caught over yourself and you say,
you're right.
I never make that mistake again.
I mean, it's good.
You're pretty good.
But, you know, when you listen to the book, Daniel, you're the greatest.
Right.
I mean, this.
Actually, I'm not good at all.
But the fact is that being on against everything else in this market, it makes me sound spectacular.
It's like vanilla ice cream, you know, compared to eating dog poop.
It's really pretty then good.
Yeah, she was bad when I thought the blood drop was coming down from here.
It's just, yeah, it's just kind of like they're quick.
And the best part of it is that they canned her once and they brought her back again.
That's the best part of the whole deal.
And you know that the first time, it had no numbers and they brought her back a second time and she's already blown away two turns of the FN audience over there.
I wonder who, what kind of picture she has.
But listen, now let me tell you, as far as the morning show, I don't listen to Rick and Suds at all.
Every month in a while I do.
And it does bring back memories of you, Rick and Suds and others.
But see, we have a whole lot of people who, you know, have this nostalgic thing going about the old IOD.
But it was good for the day.
It was. It was a lot of fun. We had me and Rick and Suds in Phil and even when Randy was there at night, it was like a whole family and people would listen morning, noon at night.
And it's gone and it's not coming back. It's like people like he's saying, well, when Phil coming back, he's not coming back here.
He's like a guy who escaped from Rayford. He's not going to come back.
These people are crazy.
But you're right. I listened. I could do not. I would tune in from six and tune out like around ten or so at night.
And you couldn't turn it off. The stuff was hilarious.
That's right.
And Phil Henry, absolute genius.
You know what I mean? And even Rick and Suds sounded better on that station than they do now on that stupid talk because they're like, they're fondering.
And I remember Rick, you know, and rightfully so, belly aching about the fact that they got no support in the morning and they had no promotion and no nothing.
And actually management wanted them to fail because they hated them like boys and especially Rick.
But he's like, what's he getting now? There is no promotion for them. They got Mike Wolf sitting in their reading stupid news stories about Art Bell for five minutes. I mean, it's a joke.
Yeah, but I tell you what, if it came through, I listened to O.J. or listening to Brook Daniel. I'll take O.J. and let's put it back in.
I'll grab it. Phil, take it easy.
I'll say O.J. for morning drive after what I heard this morning. Okay, great. Yeah, see ya.
I'm serious. That was a bad show, but we all have bad shows. I mean, look at this thing we got going here today. Okay, not too much.
I got a great letter to the editor. We're getting more and more spectacular letters. And these are good ones. For a while I was reading the bad ones, the embarrassing ones.
But now we're getting good ones. And I can gradually Lewis Williams and Lauder Hill. I'm going to read your letter in a couple of minutes here, Lewis. Nice going, sweetheart.
Oh! And I forgot to mark which paper again. This is in. God. I can't tell the print. I just can't tell one from the end of now.
They both are like interchangeable. I guess this is the sunset. Because he's in Lauder Hill. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello.
Hey, Neil. How you doing? I'm Colin. All right. I've been listening to you for a while. You've kind of woke me up to a lot of things.
Listen, I might be moving north here around the Jacksonville area. Is there any chance I'll find anything on the A.M. up there? No. I'm dead in the water.
Steve Nichol is putting a new station on the air. He called us a couple of months ago. He said,
This is what he said. Well, you got a good radio show, man. Like I said, you will just keep in mind. There's always the audio net, always the internet.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, I can't afford a computer right now. So I don't want to tell you. All right, man.
Okay. Good luck now. Not so luck. You'll need it up there in Duval County. You'll like it up here in Duval County.
You'll like those little kids in the atries with the banjo. They're real cute. 56670560. You know the ones with the one eye in the middle of their forehead.
56670560. That's the one. And pounded 560 on the mobile one line. Oh, God.
Oh, why? I felt so damn good this morning. I had a nice little blood sugar and in Georgia. Just trying to sabotage my life. When Georgia's on from one to two today, by the way,
I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was.
I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was.
I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I was a little bit more than I was. I
was looking at the show. The Show. The Show. The Show. The show.
The show. The show. I was looking at the show. The show. The show. The show. So I knew that I was seriously fond of things. I knew that I was keeping things. So I knew that I was seriously fond of things. So I knew that I was really fond of things., I knew that I was seriously fond of things. And then I'm glad that I did the best of the time, but since Life 4 is a little Melted.
When I turned 11, I started to get cute.
Now I'm 24 and so waiting on my boot.
Got to say I'm cute, they say I'm pretty.
I'm not one who needs your pity.
I've got a nice ass and fur like a kiss date,
but I can't get them in, because I've got no pity.
I've got no pity.
I've got no pity.
I've got no pity.
I've got no pity.
1044-560-WQ.
Anyway, yesterday, somebody faxes me all this stuff about Aspertain.
It gets to the point where you just want to sew your lip shut.
You just not put anything in there again, at least edible.
This is just all about Aspertain, the bad news, and it goes on and on.
I've heard this before.
It appears to cause slow, this is Nutrisuite, Aspertain, all the stuff that we're drinking by the gallon,
especially those of us who are drinking lots and lots and lots and lots of diet soda,
and thinking we're doing ourselves a big favor by not putting all that dangerous sugar in our systems,
and sending our blood sugar or skyrocketing.
Washered herbister?
No, thank you.
It appears to cause slow, silent damage, and those unfortunate enough not to have immediate reactions,
and a reason to avoid it.
So in other words, if you're one of those Fido-kela, Ianeline, whatever they call it,
what is the word for that?
Haven't you ever read that on the bottle?
If you're a Fido-Keto-Aneline, Ack-Alka-Seltzer-Sumptom,
which means you're immediately allergic to it and you can't drink it.
Fido, what?
Haven't you ever heard that?
See, here you go again.
He thinks he knows something.
Fido-Fido-Edo.
Fido-Edo.
Fido-Fido.
He's on the OJ show.
He's going to be his first guest, Fido-Bendido.
Anyway, it says it may take five years, five years, ten years, or forty years,
but Aspertain seems to cause some reversible and some irreversible changes in health over long term use.
Methanol, aka wood-alcohol-slash-poison, is 10% of Aspertain.
Methanol-slash-wood-alcohol, a deadly poison, 10% of Aspertain.
I bought a bottle of a diet squirt today for the first time in years.
Do you like squirt?
Squirt-squirt, huh?
Which reminds me a little bit of verners.
Well, verners is a different taste, but it's got that wooden thing in it, you know?
And I was looking at the ingredients and it has like wood something in it.
Warm wood?
No, essence of a worm of wood, I don't know.
Essence of your worm.
Squirt-squirt?
Yeah.
Oh, that was yesterday.
So there you go, one more thing that we just can't be putting in our mouths and the God damn Aspertain too.
Jesus, is there anything left that we can say that's worthwhile?
No.
Taste good?
No.
No.
Everything's bad for us.
And again, it's because that damn God again keeps screwing around with us.
Let's say this.
5,670560, pound 560 on the mobile one line.
Here's Weston.
Hello.
Weston.
Okay, nice talking to you.
Five minutes and 58 seconds of his important life he invested in that call.
And when push came to shove, when the money was on the line, he couldn't handle it.
And now we're back down to one call again.
Here's the mobile in Pompano.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I am.
How you doing?
Okay.
First time caller.
All right.
And I say a very new Nisler.
A new S.
Where's the new S.
Where's the new S.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, I just want to say I've been listening to it.
I was an FM listener for a while.
I got tired every one day and I switched over to him and I was flipping through the channels
and came across you and I enjoyed it very much.
Well, thank God.

Oh.
What a surprise.
And we only questioned that.
It is quite confusing.
And we only questioned that.
So, like I said in the memo yesterday about the Doug Lenzie being
the employee of the month and the face of severe adversity being
Greg Reed and the beesleys are a bunch of cheap pricks and don't really care about
the people that work there and don't care about making your comfortable building or building
that soundproof or building that's like a real radio station.
So they can put up all the new directions that they want here, okay?
And they can have all the hammers going and put a big act on.
The fact is this is still nice and there's it's still a war words. It's still Cresky's five and dime
But you want to know something I don't give a sh** anymore right although it is uncomfortable
But it starts getting uncomfortable then I do give a SH don't they have floor mounted floor model air conditioning units
That you can like roll around
Yeah, they're called fans
Yeah, and they make a lot of noise
We can use all the fans we can get this is WFA and Miami
Hey, that's a sports station. Why can't we just change the name of the college?
I WFA and we'll put I'm a sign in the morning
OG in midday and we'll sit someplace where it's nice and cool, which is not in this building yet
Styphon here already and so many the 28th of goddamn May Greg read you cheap prick you cheap gory God is he cheap
You know you sometimes wonder how people find each other like him in the beastlies
I don't really know what the the background of that relationship is but talk about a marriage made in heaven
Talk about water seeking its own level
Here's a mobile and candle hello
Well, yes, sir
I don't know
Christian
Checking in yes, what I said how you doing?
I don't know I didn't found you're working
Talk about God there's only new signs now Miami the boss cops saying I don't know who's behind you though
It's probably maybe mayor of the Nellis
Saying that if you take guys and even vain I'll make rush out of longer
I mean give me a break now that's on my asshole with a billboard company that's put those up all over the country
I mean there is why doesn't he just poor buildings?
I was what is he go out? Why do you need go out and feed some homeless people and stop wasting money with all those billboards?
That's what I tell you that's just ridiculous. Yeah, all of that
That's the thing with all these God the God squad they just can't keep it to themselves
They have to keep trying to impose it on us because there's so much better than the rest of us are you know?
Yeah, but they terrorize people and people I should lead like that exactly
You know and you know the very few was down here who actually go up to somebody and say well
What we have to do it we have to put money in the highway?
We have to you know why now I would like to do this? What does that?
Yeah, spend money on this well maybe maybe God will do it
Yeah, we just pray or instead of drinking all that beer over this holiday weekend if we just pray a lot
Maybe we'll wake up on Tuesday morning and all will have all those new highways. We've been praying for yeah
Seriously, all right now God bless you sir. Okay, the Lord be with you and keep you the good Lord willum
5 670. Yeah, it's interesting because he used to say that to witchner all the time the good Lord willum
You know, I'll let the God be with the most big of the person I ever knew in my life
I mean right now could have been understatement in his case and yet the good Lord and all that crap, you know
I must have just been a coincidence
1056 at 560 WQA and you want to punch you?

Oh, hey, Goldberg at two o'clock this afternoon six o'clock tonight
We got the pregame with Donnie B and then the Marlin game Marlin's in the red is there any?
other
Will anybody no?
Here's North Miami. Hello
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I was in your favorite play yesterday to cross guy amphitheater. Oh, yeah for the eyes
Preston black Sabbath. I've got to say your friend Woody
He was sitting in the front row right in front of me
That guy is a loser man
Yeah guy was hassling about people taking a little hit off a little joint, you know, yeah, put it out
He said he said that you believe that what he raver was telling people have when it does put it out put it out
Man, oh
The guy tells you to spark it up. You mean a guy that walks around looking like the post 60s
With his ponytail and his frosted hair and his cameras away. He's taking people's film
Well, what did he have to do with it? He sounded like some kind of a monster over there. What is it? Huh?
This is the butcher I thought he was
He's bossing people around to get a guy to take a plane and got us pneumonia over there
Absolutely
Everybody's waiting in the stage. There was no rain, but I mean it was going all around if you are wasn't a front
Round when he was told to put it out. Yeah, I'm real man. Something in a haircut. That's right
Okay, okay, so yeah
Woody Graber all comes to find out he's an asshole. Yeah, plus I don't want to see 98 degrees anyway
5 6 7 0 5 60 pond 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line
Can you believe that guy like that? Well, you know everybody in Florida is kind of like that thing
I have that they're on a power trip, you know
Because most of the people who came here feel very impotent and many of them are
And so as a result like the old people in the command of condos they have to boss people around
That's why we have so many condo commandos and some younger people want to be like that too
So there are condo commandos and training
CCIT
Or SH whatever they are
Woody telling some guy to put out a joint see that's the difference America like I said
I'm at the train station in Amsterdam and we're standing there waiting for the train to the airport and here's the young girl sitting there
Smoking a number of mining your own business. Nobody's paying any attention
There was no Woody graveyard or saying hey put that out nobody cared
Were people like swooning and falling onto the track? No, no
With the world coming to an end. No, they suffering from reefer f and madness. No
I say we ought to have one one day. This is a good idea
As a non-potspoking person, but somebody who's very much in favor of everybody's rights
I think we'd have one day where all the potsmokers unite and they just go out in the streets and light up in one
Walk around smoking their numbers or but a hell they feel like it
And that's how lucky good idea. We'll have a smoking but we got to do it somewhere
Well, we can't do it in here. Oh, and by the way, I checked the thermostat
It said as low as it'll go it's set on 50 and it's 76.8 degrees in here
And it's not even new yet. You know, you know, you're round that off. You know what you get
Ah, there's no numbers on there instead of FAN we should change to 77. Huh? Come on. Isn't there one that says
Baby
What is wrong with this crap? I pull a card out of here with all these W ABC jingles and it's not one that goes 77
And oh, Jesus. I hate you people. I hope that Bob Ballood dies. Oh, we already did
567 05 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line
Here's sunrise. Hello. Hello, new. Yes, sir. Yeah, I like your idea. Just now. I just gave I don't like
Georgia's because you get them on one spot smoke and then cows are gonna come bust every time
But anyways, you heard about some other real station offering a
That murderer a job. Yeah, I talked about that this morning. Sure. You're about an hour late
Nobody seems to care. No, it's all a sham. No kidding. That's what I said. It's a public desperate publicity stuff
There's a lady a host in afternoon and she's she's trying a big a foul
Yeah
I'm gonna do her show from the neighbor's house where he was looking to buy a house
I mean talk about being so desperate. I know and nobody cares
The radio station there ran a publicity stunt and nobody cares that the funny thing is he posed a monetary question like quitter job and give up that paycheck that fat
Jew will shut her mouth. Okay
Did he say fad you
Well said sir right on
That bitch
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T way and even if she loses weight it makes no difference
She's still a no talent talent airhead
What a match made in heaven her and PD tweet in our I know they're all listening right now. Can't not personal
All the in bolder's case I make an exception to that in his case and John Ford the it is personal and business both
John Ford little pipsqueak from their morning show at Zeta
All of a sudden he pops up he surfaces again rears his ugly head years later at the packs and IOD and now all of a sudden
He's walking around like his stuff don't stink like he's too good to talk to watch that used to work with him on Zeta
Now come to find out of course you made those comments about how he wished that Alice Rantel would get aids and die and stuff like that
Remember during his ill-fated morning show it lasted about five weeks on
I'm stupid talk John Ford
So maybe he just might suffer from a terminal case of homophobia. Maybe that's his problem that little pipsqueak
Well, if you've ever seen him
Pipsqueak would be a compliment
You know what I'm talking about John Ford. Yeah, there's a wife you know. Here's homestead. Hello. Hello. Yes sir
Yes, I know
So you want to let Oh, Jen move right next to you. No
Why because I don't like murderers living in my neighborhood. That's why do you want me to be on living next to you?
No, no, no, but let me actually start would you let Michael Jackson leave right now? No, I would not
Why because he's a pedophile. Oh, thank you. I would because a lot of people will say yeah
I'm gonna let Michael Jackson why would I want Michael Jackson? I'd rather have OJ any day than Michael Jackson
I'm well at least at least OJ is a better dresser anyway
Well, I let Michael Jackson just like that one woman said that one dark-complexed bitch
Oh, I'd be proud to have my son molested by Michael Jackson for about three or four million. She left that last part out
Say well, that's a given yeah, right
As in he's given and she's taken
I'd be proud to have my son molested by I mean what kind of a simple thing what kind of a multiplying too much
bitch would say a thing like that
And then of course the tabloids like I said yesterday they do the flea report all of his 85 marriages
Callities bull bikes and all these other bizarre people some of whom happen to be by the way members of the church of Scientology
I don't want to mention no names
One of the world. Maybe that's after the Catholic Church. Maybe that's the world's second largest closet is the church of Scientology
You think that might be yeah, but of course we don't want to say that because you know them
We don't want to start up with them. We'll leave that to George
Be talking about that at what a clock
What a relentless little speck man, you know, you're right if you wouldn't have said anything
It would have been uncomfortable, but now that you mentioned it
You know what I mean if you ever had that happen to you when somebody says is a little bit warm in here
And even though you were feeling a little bit warm
You you won't really be that acutely aware of it
But or like for example if somebody cut a real bad
And then you to somebody said, yeah, there's something smell bad in here and oh, you know
Do you all of a sudden you're really because you're focusing on it
As opposed to just kind of a subliminal thing you're really
zeroing in on it
I'm zeroing in on the fact that it's harder than a witch's rectum here man. That's twice as hot in here
Jesus Christ. It's gonna be this way all summer long. Yes
Boy

But he's a new man now. Yeah, I bet you he is he's he's born again
What a bunch of losers in that outfit
That was a nice and they did spend a lot of money on real nice state-of-the-art equipment over there the only problem was we didn't have any engineers
Who knew how to make a work including Roy
Here's a mobile and adventurer hello
Good morning, Neil
Let's go to a mobile in Montana hello
When is ever is Bob gonna get the worst the trucking right
Bob what when is Bob gonna get the worst job who Bob what what are you talking about Bob we're talking about Jerry dark star
Yeah, keep going well, you know actually I tried to get into odds last night with big press passes
And that guy would he really is a jerk you wouldn't even hear us at all
Uh-huh nice go on what do you like I said thank god for what he grab well
He haven't only didn't take this guy's drugs away and you're sitting in there trying to decipher what he says like there's an answer to it
Like there's like there's a riddle on this one's got an answer
Don't you understand basically what he said
That's what he said he just did it in different than a dialect that's all he said
Thank you, sir, and god bless you for killing 30 seconds and otherwise terminal memorial hall a day when everybody wants to go out and get the
uh
Blind drunk
Drunken puke in a whole deal because that's American effing way that's what these holidays are all about
Oh, you're so busy with that thing
Ha ha ha ha
Georgia's become neurotic it's that old man oh the old man is back again today. You'll five yeah, what's number eight?
Wait a minute slow now which old man is this
He's the crazy old man is going to cure you of your homosexuality. Oh, yeah, he's gonna cure my homocysteine problem
Gonna get the gay out of you. Yeah, 305
No, you know what I mean? He fell 948
7279 7279 maybe you can call it a reday this old man up who evidently is very lonely and looking for a
Some companionship like maybe a boyfriend 305 948 7279. I guess he wants people to call him up and wish him happy holiday
Please better you than us and
And you know we discovered of that other old cretin okay that the police had to go knocking on his door and trying to take away his guy
Them callostomy bag. It's amazing. I'm gonna tragic old parts that were out there
I mean who have no life every single day. This is their life without round fedwards even
Here's a mobile and crow spring. Hello
Yes, I've been listening to the show for about a month now
And I'm just trying to figure out why it is that you've got something against Pat Riley in the Miami Heat. Yeah, huh?
Against the organization. Uh-huh. It doesn't make sense to me
Playing to why you black ball them black ball them on what what are you talking about do you have any idea?
Uh-huh
That's his idea of humor. This is the guy that yeah, uh every time calls in about it
We were doing the thing about the kids getting shot out there in Denver
He calls in about something about the NBA and just keeps battling right along you know like he's got blinders on
You know this guy that just called this is a classic example with that New York sound of what I was talking about the other day
Go back to New York by the way sir. No wonder Rudy Giuliani kicked your ass out
See when they were talking about him cleaning up the city up there what they were really talking about was getting direct like this out of the city
And I was saying just yesterday people like that once were young
What could he possibly have been like when he was young this this asshole this New York piece of sewage
This piece of driftwood that drifted down the coast evidently in the wound up here on shore
What could he have been like when he was younger and I think George had the right answer. He was a geek
Had to be what else could he have possibly been?
If this person ever unless he was old when he was young you follow what I'm saying
I'm sure you all know people like that who never really were young only in terms of years
But even when they were young they were like old
Here's the mobile and crawl spring. Hello
Yeah, Neil how you doing okay sir good
Listen yesterday. I was interrupted from my listening by an appointment
But I'm not sure to give her come to a conclusion with the juniors
in with the Jews
Oh, it was always terminal. I mean like that the Oscar ID do this and this one
Here's your kids after I was a geek. Yeah, here's the way it works
The naming is has nothing to do with the English name first of all if your uncle was a Bernard and he died
They don't name you with a B it has to do with the Hebrew name. That's first
The second thing is it's an old Bubba mindset that see I hate to break the news to you
I don't believe that that's done anymore. I mean maybe there maybe the orthodox do that
No, pretty much so I mean the Hebrew name because when the baby's born you go into the temple and you pay them and you name the baby
But the junior has to deal with it's an old Bubba mindset that if you name someone a junior
You're stepping on the seniors grave. Yeah, somebody mentioned that you know, so that's basically what a bunch of
What a ridiculous bubble might you know like anybody with anything on that glass, you know
stepping and breaking the glass at the wedding. Well, what are we gonna stop doing these idiotic symbolic stupid idiotic things?
Well, my one of my daughters just got married and I paid her basically
Not to have a big ceremony go to with justice of the piece get married
Be happy here's the money that we would have spent on the big deal
Don't waste on that and buy an extra set of dishes or something. Don't have a good time. This is something you do
It's up to you to because there is no guide right
Except for sport
Okay, thank you so much and happy world day owner
5 6705 60 boy. We got the big indie 500 weekend coming up. Maybe that's why Joe Castello's nose is so red
Either that or what is that it looks like a bad thing and you didn't even notice it before that's the first thing
I noticed it is a giant pustule. It's a boy. Oh, jeez. I don't want to get you nervous, Joe
But when you walked in here before I want to say anything is that anyone who will arm you but I was thinking oh my god
Wow that looks bad
What is it is it is it is it going to go squeezing in your face
What about to say it's a big
Joe Castello has got a big zit on the end of his nose
And if there's anybody in the world who doesn't need any added appendage on his nose it's Joe
Now I remember when Clinton was on TV that time with all that heavy pancake make up on and his nose kept getting longer and that panochio think kept happening
That could be happening with Joe because when he said that he doesn't like feet
I think that was one of the first details the kids that he told
And then when he was talking I like crap about shaving his nuts
Did I just say biowner? I think I yeah, I just kind of like psychologically a segue into this
Are you selling your home or looking to buy one?
Why?
There you
West
There you
There you
There you

So it's 1131 at 560 wqm the employee of the month was just in here by the way
I said you know the air conditioning is really a screw up
It's getting really hot in here and he said yeah
He said maybe it's a distribution problem
He said there's too much blowing on the other side of the building
And I said you we already know that we know who the parties are too, but that's beside the point
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line
I could tell you about Greg Reed coming in here this morning, but then again
Here's a mobile in Pemberg Pine he'd need to him various Pemberg Pine tell him
Neon eel yes sir how you doing great hey listen
I do listen you show all the tip all the time
I'd like to address a few of the things that you've talked about really yes
Okay, first of all George wants one of those little floor air conditioners
I purchased one at De Longi
They blow a little bit of cooler out the front. They blow hot air out the rear you know hot air out the rear
Yeah, up the back
So they kind of neutralize each other they don't and they are very loud. Oh good
That would distract the audience from these calls that would be excellent
Yeah, we just want to hear you now. I remember years ago you telling me it is
We're not telling me telling me and everybody else an incident about him coming into work with a 45 or something like that
Oh, by the way John penis from the sales department just brought us in a bunch of great cigars from next answer matches too
Go ahead. I'm sorry light one up
Yeah, which nerve came in with a loaded gun or something like that? He did that every no now one time every night
No way air every night he had a
357 magazine would put the briefcase down on the counter and coming about a quarter to midnight and he put the briefcase down
And he would open it up and he'd pull out the first thing we do every single night like a ritual would be pull out that
357 and lay it on the counter
Yeah, and I the story is that I had a rabbi as a guest on that night and he came in and he pulled a gun out in the rain
This is a true story and a rabbi put his hands up and he like it was a stick up
It's a true story
He went boy
And you know about abortion he's conservative. I have it all wrong
I mean you know very said we're that guy with a beanie on his e-juction. I said yeah, and Jerry said
Anyway, go ahead
Uh, whatever I'm here. What if I happen to me? I don't know. I think he's uh his hair. He slipped his wig
Old jay somebody's still at the hairpiece now. I think the the conservative like Jim bush on that they have it wrong
They should legalize abortion and
You know make band guns you don't stuff the other way around. Yeah legalize
And band out there's yeah that or give every feed is a gun so they can shoot the
From the end shoot their way out. Yeah, exactly exactly and the other thing is this another day
You were talking about how corporations, you know like they know they're gonna you know get bought out
They don't give a crap about the employees
Well here's here's the story on that they're not supposed to say anything because I would affect the value of the sale
Yeah, so if they were to be like hindered in solitude
Okay, Cox broadcasting if they would have done that then of course
I would have started looking for a job and that would have uh jeopardized the whole sale of things they don't
But that that's the point though
That they don't care about people all they care about is themselves and anybody who pretends to be your friend all that they care about themselves
Neil you probably want to cover their ass right? Cheryl and Bob right now you understand it my I have understood it for a long time
The American way right have a great day sir. Like happy whatever it is happy uh drinking day
5 6 7 boy. It's sticky and uncomfortable in here now the humidity is high the heat is uh
And then maybe that's why like extra added compounded the
nauseated feeling I had for meeting that stuff from Duncan donuts this morning
Huh, I know they were trying to do something nice for me and see I turn around and I'm a prick now
I'm just telling it like it is didn't I say the other day how delicious that thing was that they made my
Appreciate and I thank the guy in here. He was trying to do something nice and instead he made me very very a loggy
Not sick, but loggy. You know what loggy is
We feel like you have no energy and then it starts getting real warm
And you want to just like hibernate in the corner like uh smoke you the bear
That's how I feel right now
And if you open up the window we can get the smoke in here to go with the smokey part too
I say about a six month fast sounds good to me for maybe some of you guys
5 6 7 0 5 60
About 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Let us know how you made out
Here's a mobile and crawl spring. Hello
Good morning, they're yes, sir
You just bought up a medical term which I wish you would explain because the doctor told me my
Homo system level was high. Uh-oh
Is that your blood sugar? That means you're in the closet
No, Homo system is which I didn't know about till I got that book which I don't have in front of me right now
But that's a very important thing because it causes heartening of the arteries which leads to stroke and heart attack
It has to do with the Homo system is it's just stuff that it's like a cholesterol
It's made naturally in the body, but if your level goes too high
Uh, it can be very dangerous and you need to take a lot of folic acid you take folic acid. Yeah
He told me folic acid go on a low fat diet. Well the low fat. I don't know if you take a lot of cholesterol was
165 yeah, well, that's good
Yeah, but cholesterol or Homo system is really a lot of sweet stuff. Oh, yeah
Well, stop eating that crap stopping that drug, but take the folic acid. How much are you taking?
Well, I'm not yeah, well, I didn't mean you're not yet. I just went yesterday
Well, I went yesterday to and I went again this morning. I feel like I might have to go again
20 minutes you don't know the name of that book, do you? What's the name of that book George the one with the uh the Homo
Assistine guy you got a written the heart guy the heart guy what is the name of
Georgia's got it one moment please. Okay
It's called the heart solution by Kilmer McCulley killed dr. Kilmer McCulley the heart solution. It's a heartback. It's very very good
I appreciate it. Oh, we have any idea how high your Homo system level was what did I know? I didn't know that well
Why not yeah, listen you people are gotta start being a little more bossy with your doctors
He's not doing for free for you. Is he don't you pay him?
My insurance your insurance pays him so you have a right to know find out what the numbers are and start getting a little more involved in your own life
Okay, thanks. Okay
See I I hate doctors man other than dr. Mark who's a good guy, but we don't hear from him and that's just as well
That's good he hears that I'm still alive and he's grateful, but uh, I'm telling you man doctors you you guys are a bunch of butchers
You don't share any information. Don't educate the public and this fat thing. It's an illness
This is enough forget about cancer forget about AIDS forget about tuberculosis forget about berry berry and leprosy and scurvy
And green apple quick step the number one illness in America is fat
And you doctors out there you don't know your ads from fat, which is why these grave robbers were able to put the for the low fat scam over on the public
And now five or six years later now they're coming out and saying oh well guess what it doesn't work
We were wrong
When guys like atkins and stillman and other guys were saying 25 years ago that dietary fat hasn't got a goddamn thing that it would make in your fat
But the doctors out there did they know anything about nutrition?
No, they know anything about any of this that would be like I said this a million times before like a guy who
I'm a mechanic who works on your car not knowing anything about the goddamn carburetor and the fuel you're supposed to put in there
So it would be like putting shardon a in your gas tank
Like putting color in water in the gas tank and as much as we love our color in water
I mean I'm not think I'm going to put that in the gas tank. No, no tanks
But when it comes to putting stuff in your body which uh oh jeez
You doctors you're responsible nobody else don't blame anybody else don't blame the food manufacturers
They're just trying to make a dishonest living like everybody else
And the the more they appeal to our taste buds and the better it tastes to know the more we're going to want it and more we're going to spend by in their crap
Because they're trying to make a living. They're not out there to be altruistic
Whatever they are. They're just business people
You're the ones that are supposed to be concerned about our god damn health. For example
They have a PSA they're running or uh some series they're running on cdc in Canada
About prescription drug advertising. Are you aware that up there? It's illegal in
Canada to have ads for prescription drugs and that they have some drug companies trying to circumvent that
But nevertheless, that's the big controversy because it's it's illegal
To advertise prescription drugs whereas here you pick up time you pick up newsweek
newspapers magazines all over because what's important is that the drugs are good for you that they really are safe and effective
That Pfizer makes a lot of money and all these other goddamn uh grave robbers
Because in america everything comes down to money even your health isn't important as long as somebody can make a big buck off it
And especially those grave rob grave robbing doctors
You're a bunch of butchers doctors. That's what you are butchers with the capital B
21 before noon at 560 wqa any so get away from the ball mother
I see the man at the point oh shop putting in a change
Behind the glass booths appear some drugged out hole with names
He tells the girl to take off her clothes with shame in his eyes
Just don't romance just another fat ugly guy
God forbid you have to walk a mile in a shoe
That my friends is what we call the horny man blue
Then you really might know what it's like
Hey
Then you really might know what it's like
Yes
You really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like
1145 at 560 wqa I'm trying to think you know even though I have a very short memory
If we ever had anybody that causes in any of the places that we worked caused as many problems as time direct and such a short period of time
See I guess the little going out and selling like new accounts or anything like that
Just they sticking around and stirring up the same pot and continuing to cause more problems
Taking away other people's accounts things like that, you know
Sturing the pots stirring it stirring it if you smoke it that's fine, but don't steer it
560 7 0 560 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line have we seen him up here by the way to a service those accounts? No get us that copy no
Just checking
Here's sunrise hello
Hey, how you doing? The okay sir
That's what I call, you know
Yes, I read in the
the
I think I'm nervous uh the
You're right, isn't it?
about
Jeff Bush was talking about he was you know he was you know they're talking about
Imaging the lawsuit about a money to pay to
You know like like you like to say a plane or something crashes some you know, but uh huh if it's more than 12
Live go that yeah, I can't believe that. I mean what a what a what a well
It's his friends in big business. He don't want to make them liable for you know all the crap that they're doing it
What's what's the crap?
You know
You know as I was the other thing in the middle about the the the
I'm trying ratings and then I'm gonna put you on the outstanding. We love you sir. Okay
Well again, you hope you have a
Safe trip where you're going. Are you leaving town? I'm getting very far out of here. I'm going to the North Pole
Do some exploring have a great weekend
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless now we've got a couple of lonely calls on there
Couple of little lonely calls here and there. It's kind of a scattering smattering those of us left in town
Everybody's bailed out you could see that coming to work this morning very very light traffic
Although we they have a lot of accident. See there's one thing about this town
Doesn't take a whole lot of people to be out there to create real chaos
That's good. It makes up for those days when it's bumper to bumper
You could have like could be like Christmas day like nobody's on the highway
It still have massive wrecks all over time because it takes only a select few
It's just it's not a question of quality. Yeah, a quantity. It's you know what I'm saying
It's a question of which assholes are the ones out there behind the wheel
By the way hide in my good new friend that published she last night I went over to get some dog food
After the hockey game I was depressed or went and got dog food
And the young lady at the express the lane. She said the young blonde lady very attractive
She said you know I always wanted to say this to you, but I was always too nervous. You're really very funny on a radio
Wasn't that nice and I said thank you so much
They love me at the sawgrass public. I'm legendary. I'm bigger than god damn Muhammad Ali bigger than
Hiram Walker and Johnny Walker
I'm Tony
Here's a mobile in South Miami. Hello
Now mobile, but uh, here's a stationery in South
I'm in my backyard. Okay. Um, yeah, I mean to get tangential there
What you're saying about traffic. Yeah, that's a whole nother call for me, but I think I'm gonna get back to the jabsor
Um, I just got back from California and moved back after the election
So I don't know what the hell happened, but you obviously won. I guess buddy mcay was like watching paint try and there
No, he was paint drying. Yeah, so there's no way that when you run a dead man
It was like running Bob Dull for the repulsive. Okay, I figured that
I mean the he couldn't what's cool and at least I felt comfortable. I'm scared to tell
We're six months into this guy's administration
Um, a lot of people remember this. I was here in January
So I do remember like one of the first legislative acts that he did
Um, and I don't know where this isn't a pipeline was attached his name to some bill sponsored by those twisted
Republican pro life
Twits in like wet Florida like camp or Orlando saying if you want to get a divorce
You there's gonna be mandatory counseling you have to go and get counseling. Yeah before you want to get away from the person you want to get away from from the pope
Yeah, I mean, so it's like I've been waiting like maybe in inject the you know religion into what is basically
I think I think you're complicating matters just make it simple choose life to exactly
Put his name behind anything that says anti abortion
Anything that
Is put in front of him that says that he's gonna slide now you know marriage is a legal contract
You know, it's not a good thing. What are you getting all bent? Oh, you sounds like you're getting very hyper to me
I'm very mellow here. I'm sorry man. Well, yeah, you know
I have a nice pro domo ex in my mouth
I don't have it didn't light it up because it's a non-smoking building
And I want to get all been on the show
And actually it's so goddamn hot in here that the smoke from the vents would make me even mean nauseous because there's no circulation in here
It's steaming in here. It's just boiling
Well, okay, I'll let you go then but like I said I'm scared we're six months into this one
What do you mean you're scared? What would it be?
It looks like we're going back to this like the dark days of
The day that we elected Jeb Bush we went back to the dark days we turned a clock back 300 years
So what is that a bullet me and all that's just the way it is
Before the effort away man, this keeper eye on the guy and that'll teach you to move to Florida again
Good luck now. I'll go back back. He's going back to somewhere anywhere
Okay, we have 600 open lines. We're never gonna make it to one course. Georgia's on his own between one and two
Gonna be attacking the Scientologists again or some some outrageous unacceptable thing like that
We'll be sacrificing the chicken to the new good
The dark overload. Oh, and I'm you know something else. I'm getting like because I'm hunched over because it's so goddamn hot in here
I don't have the energy to set up straight like a man, you know
I need to have a Marlon Brander come and slap me around a little bit. So I'd sit up straight and be like a man like El Martino
It's just schwitzing in here. It's just the unacceptable the Greg Reed effing wave man
Just you're brutal. He's just absolutely brutal
That's gonna be our poll question on Tuesday. Who's the bigger asshole Greg Reed or Todd Dreck
5670560. Seriously, that's a tough contest. I want you to think about that over the weekend. Well at least Greg is nice in person
Greg
Okay, it's in oh here it is. Here's a mobile in candle. Hello
The day sir. Yes, sir. I have three things for you if I could
First of all, you were talking about old days since the other day what should they do if they like hire them there or
How about you could do the dolphins pregame all seven days of it, you know because
That's basically where they go through you know all week long pregame postgame post pregame
Okay, here's a mobile in Miami. Hello
Neil yes, sir. Yeah, how's it going great? I just want to tell you we're talking about travel great till I last call or till I last the pups
Sorry, there's a lot of traffic. I saw the motor vehicles accident. It's two ladies. They're about 90 years old
One of them takes a light in Holland. They don't sound dixie highway
Smash into the other lady does a 360 keeps her foot smashed on the pedal smashed right into the other post
Mindy, I get off the car and go over there see how she's doing. She doesn't even know where she's standing
And she just caught the biggest accident there. Well, maybe her bag ran over that might have been it
You know that overflow
Maybe she forgot to press the overflow valve before she hopped in the vehicle 5 6 7 0 5 60
pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. That's what happens when you have dead people driving
I hate to break the news to boys and girls
Well, you have people over the age of 200 driving getting automatic license of renewals in the mail
Which I keep screaming about and nobody cares
See up in Tallahassee. They're worried about you know
Pumping out the license plates that say choose life and shoot an abortion doctor for Christ and things like that
Well, when it comes to like important stuff like getting the dangerous people off the road the people over the age of 300
The people the illegal aliens driving their little old brown toy odors
With no brakes and no headlights and no brake lights and the ball tires and stuff like that all these things
Do they care about that? No, no
Not to mention of course the 60% of the people in the county driving them out with no insurance so that if they hit you
S.O.L
Here's a mobile and sunrise. Hello. Hey me. I got a no-j airport. Yeah
You're looking to buy a house and plantation acres. Yeah, I can't believe it now. I was seriously
Did you see something the budget cuts that Jeb Bush proposed and?
Well, they were wonderful. Let me answer you something. Why is everybody talking about this now?
It's a little bit late isn't it the horses already halfway to god damn Jacksonville
That's all I'm happy about it
He cut three hundred thousand dollars from park improvement to call springs
Like call springs needs three hundred thousand dollars. Well, where are those gangs gonna hang out if they don't have some nice parks man
You better get with it
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line
I don't want to talk about Jeb Bush. It's Memorial Day holiday all these people are want to give me depressed
I'm not interested in Jeb Bush. Okay, you got him you wanted him you got him
I warned you I told you I could smell him a million miles away
Now fascist by any other name would smell the same
In fact, I wish it would have been any of the name because if his name wouldn't have been boots that he wouldn't have got elected in the first place
But you're dealing with such stupid people in this state not just in the state
I guess it's anywhere in the US of a
Because the people are too busy watching inside addition and the ET and crap like that
And standing online to get into sea star wars the too busy with the important stuff like that
So that it's just name recognition if it's incumbent 98% of the time they win only because somebody oh yeah
That's right. I remember John Lamello. I remember Rowell Martinez
Of course and highly everybody out of ballot their name is Martinez. So it's kind of tough to tell
Here's a mobile how about how's home birtho doing by the way?
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir
But let's leave you to know about three months now. What's it? Yes
And if nothing else to figure out who Roy is could you explain that
Roy and you know
It's interesting because when we worked at IOD for the Paxon people they had a chief engineer whose name was
So that originally was done
For his sake because he was a real asshole and you couldn't talk to him and tell him anything
So we always used to draw that then we came over here and of course one of one of our say
I hate to call him a saleswoman because he's just a face man
He's not really a sales guy. He never sold on account in his life
But when I hang you know when they need an x-jock to go out and close an account with some client out there that's impressed by x
Football players and guys that used to wear a jock strap it's
But they take along with it and I'm coming to find out that he's real good buddies with OJ and recently
Trying to talk to management here in a hiring OJ and the management said no and that's why I and Z started that big phony baloney
Deal this morning and it didn't do anything for him
Basically, yeah for now. Okay. The worst publicity stunt in the history and what would you expect from the worst radio company in a history of other business
I thought they didn't care about ratings
Well, that's good because they're never gonna have any that's a damn good thing
No, in fact that's people. There's a slogan over there. We don't care about ratings. We're just concerned about ruining people's lives nice job
Great job
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line. I got now
Oh
No, I'm a nigga you're a nigga. He's a nigga. We are all nigga
Oh
That's what our greetings friends like all black people do
But why do you want to say it to so they can sound real cool
I'm in your universe. He's a machine that you're where all make her booze
Now the big it's half the fine another word to you
It used to be real bad
Now it seems okay when that's what can I'm not
I can't address themselves that way
I'm in your universe. He's a machine that you're where all made her booze
Longers of vernacular
For racial abuse
You
That's
You say but now
I'm by black folks every day
I'm a nigga you're in your universe. You're in your universe. Oh
You're in your universe. You're in your universe. Oh
Yeah, it doesn't matter now. But everyone is
Yo
I'll be grand master's food
I'll be switching my
Playing with my reaction
I'll be twisting
I got a reason
Southampton did
Put the lotion in the bathroom
I
Trembo two of five sixty WQ I N
Yeah, I like to talk to Neil speaking
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I got a cure for your homosexuality man. Yeah, okay. Thanks
Isn't that interesting when I pick him up cold? How it always turns out to be a whole different program five six seven oh five sixty
Pound five sixty so anyway the story behind the story god damn it. Yeah
About that horrible attempt that weak feeble attempt at a publicity stunt by John Ford and the people over at stupid talk
With that OJ crap
Come to find out the Rick and suds we find this out from the inside
Someone close to the situation
Rick and suds weren't even told about this pathetic embarrassing humiliating degrading unacceptable
publicity stuff they walk in this morning and of course it's been in the newspaper non-tv and they're like
You know
They're going like god damn it. Yeah. Well, they go to bed early enough. Yeah. What are they gonna say?
Of course it was on a 7 30 news, but they're on the air already by that time
And if they wouldn't know about it the rumor has it that they would have called in sick and not showing up because they're humiliated and degraded and any
I mean there is nobody with any self respect that's gonna stay working on a radio station if they bring that murdering son of a bitch in
I'm telling you that I told you that two days ago, and I'm telling you that again today
I mean we all gotta eat, but there's at some point you have to have a little bit of self respect
You know what I'm saying Roy
Maybe Roy can look with with Todd direct that would be a merge made in heaven. Huh? Oh god
I got my fingers and legs crossed
I'm crossing my eyes my legs
everything
Todd direct is the anti-Christ make no mistake about that. I want to apologize personally the Jeff high Gary Sarner
Any other names come to mind that I've really trashed
Not that they're such wonderful guys, but everything to the sales people. Huh? Yeah, everything is relative
Well Bob Eisenberg
Anybody else
Because they're great. They're wonderful people all relatively compared to Todd direct the anti-Christ
And you know I keep mentioning that one account that we've got a real
Problem with the copy where they love me and I love them
But we seem to have all kinds of problems popping up because somebody injected himself in it and stole the account from Peter Lenin
Which I apologize to Peter Lenner too by the way
I especially apologize to him because he's the one that got screwed on this deal
And to read you know why this stuff all goes on because we don't have anybody running a ship
We got any five sales managers. We got Ray Perry who's more impotent than Bob Dull
He needs a bottle of sales manager Viagra or something to put him up. We don't see him for high
He's
Calgary in a room closet somewhere
We got the other one back there. Of course. We know what he's busy doing Roy. Yeah
And so everybody's like over there all like I've told you this is the truth everybody's got their own little empire going here
And nobody's running the ship
And so that's why this Todd record like a whirling division like I said is he servicing this account?
No, we have copy that makes any sense. No, we're getting a resolution
No, all we're getting is this guy running around like he was a few weeks ago making problems
Like when he was running around a hallway up here in the yell and neo-rodgers and that's what everybody said okay
We know that so what's the bulletin okay?
What's the big deal
You're the asshole Todd you're the anti-cry you're the sugar in a wood pile
You're the impediment to our lives just at the point when we finally said screw it
We don't care, but in your case we make an exception. That's right
Here's a mobile in poppano hello
Mobile in poppano hi, yes sir great. Hi. Do you watch the game last night? Yes, of course
Now where did Pat Quinn get that shirt from? We did what?
Where did Pat Quinn get that shirt from the Eden Center? I know
I called saw Carmen today he never saw one like that before and he swears that by all his clothes there
Well, what do you care about what what kind of shirty was wearing last night?
I mean what is that got to do with the price of peanuts with with the goals that Sylvan Cote and Alexander Carpitz have handed over to the
Say what otherwise it might have been a much much different game just
What kind of a pass was that that Sylvan Cote was making in front of his own net? What was that?
Is that that's a by the way somebody better tell John Shannon the CBC for the second time in two games in a row
They're doing some stupid interview with Martin Biron there while there at least are scoring a goal and you know
Bob Cole is sitting there like that
He can't say anything because they're doing a stupid interview while a game is going on. I'd scull on John Shannon
I hope the CBC fires your ass
But anyway, anyway, no that you're right about that
The least handed the saver's ad game and the first goal that
Hashek would in was it a pure American leager? I mean that was
The the ESPN thing was was constantly talking about him and they were
Darren Pang had his eyes focused on him all night you didn't you didn't talk about the whole rest of the game
Yeah, yeah
You see that every that you got to see it but Bob Cole couldn't call the goal because they were busy doing an interview while the game was going on
Yeah, well, that's that's normal. That's the the new producers need to get Dave Hodge back
There you go bring Jack Dennis back dig his ass up
What's up? I said get Jack Dennis back dig him up and word Cornell
You think you think
We got the secret weapon. We're bringing Bill and foster back for game five game four whatever
Thank you by a say on okay, okay, have a great life. Okay
That's right little do they know okay the savers when they expected the least for game four on Saturday night
We're bringing Bill hewitt back
On the face up right in the ghetto
It's right we're digging his ass up. We're bringing fun. We're even bringing Harold Ballard back for bad luck
Now let's start talking hockey down here. They resent it. They don't understand it
They don't know from it. They don't know anything or they think they know something about football

I hollered we played songs we I mean did everything I could and now that he's in there
It's like oh jeez. See what's going on. I know what's going on. I agree
I got my new passport. I got a brand fresh new and with lots of pages on it
I agree because none of your Cuban Americans or your black Americans are calling to you
Yeah, right that's number one number two how many black Americans voted for jet bush puddle
There's a couple of a couple of those turncoats up there in telehansi
In there the other thing that you were talking about earlier
Where was god when that poor little 12-year-old kid was getting killed on Sheridan Street? Yeah, where was god when Ted Bundy killed that little girl up there in
Wherever it was Lakeland or somewhere right yeah, absolutely have a great weekend
And back to you by the way, what time is the Ted Bundy show coming on the stupid talk?
Yeah, you guys I'm telling you you really do it you just keep embarrassing yourselves worse and worse and worse
It's not bad enough that the numbers keep coming out which is enough embarrassment since you don't have any
And it's always easy to say well, you know clear channel broadcasting
We have all these zillion stations and we bought out jcore and we want to you know something the audience doesn't care about that
Nobody cares about that
We're not impressed
Just like that crap that paxon was running a
American stock exchange listed company like of course
A for neglected to mention the stock was dropping like a rock and it still is they neglected to mention that and losing the rance with paxonet
5 6705 60 pound 560 on a mobile one one

Yes, sir
I'm a messenger from god. Yeah
and
I just talked to Neil the messenger from
Eagle come on. Yeah, and what's the message?
The message is exactly this. How about speaking into that thing that's got the holes in it so I can hear you sir
Okay, do you hear me now? Yeah, that would be good. Okay, so I mean if you got a message from god
It's very important that we hear it. That's right. Here's the message. Yes
That God does exist God is real. Uh-huh. And that God is in Israel
God is everywhere. Yeah
And then if we open our minds and hearts, we can understand and have a relationship with him a relationship
But listen, have you ever has number absence of having a relationship with him
Then you will always question his existence
Yeah, because you do not have time to talk to me when you should be talking to him
Well, because he wants me to talk to everybody. Yeah, I've been my time talking with him
What did what did he tell you? What did he tell me? Yeah, where's not a thing that he what he tells me is what did he tell you?
He reveals to my heart and to my mind a guidance and direction in my life
And that brings about a piece and an understanding that you seem to be very
About of all the things that's happening in the world. You don't have any answers to them
Yeah, because I have answers to it's only me. Okay. What are the answers sir? What are the answers to all the violence for example?
Is the violent yeah
What I answer to the war in Kosovo in the Chinese feeling all our nuclear secrets. I will tell you that
There's always our business to go and find a way
As long as people are just a piece into the word of God
The same God that told the Israelites to kill their enemies to go out and slay them
Listen, man. Is that the god you're to be talking about sir?
Sir, I'm asking you a question now. Is that the same god?
Listen God
Are you gonna and don't tell me listen answer the question, Dumbo? Is it the same god that told the Israelites to go out there and slay their enemies?
If God tells sir, are you gonna answer the question or not?
Well, are you gonna listen? I'm waiting for the answer. Okay
Now when did when did first of all tell me at what in what past does the Bible?
Yeah, I don't even waste the time with this guy's up fake or what we're in the Bible that he say that
Don't read the Bible instead of making stupid phone calls to talk shows and then you might find out what it's all about
And then you also will say what a pile of crap that is numbers chapter 22
Yeah, and number go out you get somebody with the numbers. Okay, damn it
7.11. Those are the only numbers you need to think about
And seven people won a lot of relic week anyway, so forget about the numbers. It's a small jackpot this week
5670560. I mean all these people with their glittering. What are you gonna get a brain? What's in your brain pal?
What's in your brain? I'll tell you a big fat
Nothing just a bunch of glittering generalities number something gets even minimally specific with you is like
Like that, you know
Where does it say that
God
Man, oh man. I'm gonna light up this guy damn Stoke. You know, I don't care what they'd like or do not
I'm gonna shove it right up Todd direct them
5670560 pound five 60 on the mobile one line. How do you like that?
Another one of these guys find that that that that that that I just talking babbling crap
Every one of these so-called religiousness if you spend more time putting something into your brain besides just babbling a bunch of foolish crap that somebody else told you
That was you know what I said yesterday and it's a miracle. I did it on a date like yesterday because I was somewhat distracted but nevertheless
No seriously, and that was the most profound thing I've ever said
And that is what is in the brain of most people especially in America compared to most places I've been
What's in the minds of most people is crap that somebody else put there not anything that people themselves deduced or conclusions
They came to or things that they've really thought about
No, somebody else said fill in the blank. That's right. So therefore you're thinking right
Just stop and think about that for a while. Okay
Just examine all of these things that are cluttering up your feet a little gray matter, okay?
And I think you'll eventually come to the same conclusion like I said
That's something that you decided that you understood it's some crap that somebody else stuck in there and brainwashed you with
Here's Hollywood. Hello. Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey
Just changed the subject a little bit
Next time you go to Amsterdam. I was there a couple years ago
We stayed in a houseboat right on the river. I'm not sure where you stayed there on a canal
Yeah, on a canal yeah, and it was just happening it was about 250 bucks American a night, but it was sweet and
High-class and real nice and we headed to ourselves, you know, not like one of those little rooms one of those hotels
Anyway, look into it next time. What do you mean like one of those little rooms? This is I stay in a little room
Well, I don't know. I don't know. They're a big shot like me don't stay in a little room
Okay, we'll check out the house and a big shot like me also don't pay 250 bucks a night American unless you're out of your mind
Okay, it's always great to be out there in a houseboat. You know on a canal
Not but if that's what you like, I'm glad you had a good time
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line
85,000 empty lines is in one call on the board again
Well, this has been spotty today and they're all the way for the holiday weekend. I know they're all bailing out right now. I understand that
But we got 40 minutes at least I got 40 minutes here and I'm flying out of here
I'm gonna race out of this door like you wouldn't believe I'm gonna run out here square like screaming making guttable sounds as I get out the door
Yeah, just to be the as far away from Todd records. I possibly can be
A man who just insists on creating chaos and
Psychosis everywhere he goes is opposed to solving problems. He's busy creating ones
Never seen anything like it in my life every time you think you've seen it all in this business
And then somebody like that comes along in a rest of the management or like that
Yeah, yeah, instead of saying cut the crap and start the servicing the account and let's get with the program and stop all the
Craft disturbing, okay, you simple than you
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello
Hey, they all hide on okay, sir. Hey, I can't believe that guy who called you are

He also used to talk to God all the crazy people. They're busy talking to God
Yeah, every time you go into a big city and you walk around downtown
Whatever city it's in and there's these crazy people on street corners handing out leaflets and muttering
Nearly a lot of gibberish and you think what these people are crazy and like I've told you before the more religious
They are the crazier they are exactly the more dangerous they are
Exactly the fanatics the conservative morons. I'm telling you you know, I mean the symbol of the city
With the way I should look at it as long as there's poor people in homeless people here
Yeah, what I do about them where we how many how many billions that we waste on those space shuttles that blew up
Until we finally got one off the ground yesterday how many billions was the three in a row that we wasted like five or six billion dollars
And in the meantime people are starving to I guess God isn't given very good instructions as to what to be doing with all that money
It exactly. Feel it's just a bunch of morons. Don't pay any attention. God bless you here. All right. Okay. Don't take too much

5, 6, 7, 05, 60 pound.
They're working on it.
Okay, they're working feverishly to correct these things because they know that some of
us might not come back for many, many days if it's going to be a sweltering and here we're
going to be schmitz in our brains out.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60 pound, 5, 60 on a mobile one line.
Hope you have a wonderful holiday weekend.
I hope that most of you are going to get to go out of town, go to living and breathing
places, which this is definitely is not, as you obviously know.
And of course the rest of you, I do understand why so many of you sound bitter and psychotic
because you're here.
I can relate to that.
Here's a mobile in Pompano.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
What's your take on that University of Miami-Hurk, who's team is here?
Uh-huh, I'm taking it.
Hey, listen, Neil.
You know what the scariest part about old Jeb?
My stroke there in Tallahassee is.
Can you imagine if his brother is one of this country?
Yeah.
That is scary.
Uneffing-ble-able.
Hey, also, let me ask you a question.
Now America's obsessed with Bush, you know, let's depend.
Listen, I asked you a radio-
Never had that problem myself, yes?
No, but you have a question.
How come is it that you can go into a radio shack and buy a little portable grondig radio
and pick up the BBC something that's 10, 15,000 miles away, but you can't pick up a
AM station anywhere within this country.
Why is that?
Because you're right.
You want to know the answer?
That's the American f**king way.
That's right.
No, seriously, you know why-
You're trying to-
You're trying to-
Well, can't you buy a short-wave radio?
Yes, that's what I'm saying.
It's on short-wave, the BBC.
You're not getting it on like on AM.
You're getting it on short-wave.
Short-wave travels like all over the place.
Is there any radio that you know-
Of course, when you have short-wave, you've also got a msshh like in the background, but that makes it like more British, you know.
Is there any portable radio that you know that you can't buy, which you can't pick up a radio station in this country?
What do you mean radio station in this country?
What does that mean?
Oh, okay, like say-
Like EDR?
No, I mean you guys.
I'm going to be moving up north, but I want to keep in touch and I don't have a computer.
No, I'll get you a computer.
Forget about that.
Well, I'm going to spend for a goddamn high-powered radio.
It gets you a computer.
Okay, two quick things.
Get with it, man.
I mean, I'm not having a computer in America today.
You're like way behind the times.
Get with it.
Yeah, I'm like, I can't afford a listen.
You're getting-
We're still one, then.
You're going to have one.
All right, listen, two quick things.
I don't even know no Godfather and like a calli-on said, dance.
Like a calli-on said, that-
What do we do with a piece of-
Fuck, running around saying this if he's saying these things, huh?
What do we do with a piece of crap that's running around a building saying the erogies is an asshole?
What do we do with a bearded guy?
What do you do with a bearded guy?
A bearded guy.
What?
You're a weird guy.
Yeah, I'm a weird guy.
That should be the worst thing was ever said about me.
I'm a weird guy, okay?
That's a bulletin.
Yeah, and it's interesting, too, compared to Todd Dreck.
I'm about as normal as they come.
Talk about weird guys.
And talk about Michael Corleone.
He's in here a few weeks ago, this Todd Dreck.
And I ask him a very simple question about a new account and he's like,
but I mean, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
And I'm looking at him like, what language are you speaking?
I mean, I ask him the question and he keeps repeating this.
It's like a non-answer over and over again.
Now, of course, many weeks later, I understand why he didn't want to give me an honest answer
because it comes to find out that the account belonged to somebody else
and by hook and by crook all of a sudden he wound up with it
and then wound up in somebody else's hand.
We have all of these things going on now.
And in the meantime, is the account getting serviced?
No.
Are we getting copy?
Is somebody doing the job that they're supposed to be doing?
No.
And I'm like, in limbo, as usual, I'm only the guy that's on the air
who's the asses online trying to do a job for people out there.
And am I getting any assistance whatsoever?
No.
I got people too busy running around, stirring up crap.
I mean, where the hell did this guy work before?
Has he ever been in this business before?
I mean, well, where did he work?
That he comes in here and he's got this ego thing like he's going to show me.
He's going to run up and down the halls, writing graffiti.
My name on a wall or something.
Okay?
Is if I give a crap.
Just spell it right.
Here's a mobile in four-lotterdale.
Hello?
Mobile in four-lotterdale.
Yeah, how are you doing, sir?
Okay, sir?
Yeah, Neil, right?
Speaking?
Yeah, how are you doing?
Listen, I just wanted to let you know, you know,
I've been thinking about you bad for a while because I usually see you on that TV show
and usually wearing that Yamacock.
I haven't been on it for five months or so.
It's been off for a long time.
True, true, but, um, anyway, I saw you wearing that Yamacock.
You know, at this time, you miserable, too.
I don't even want to listen to anyone who want to look at him.
Yeah.
And I'm driving in the car today and my friend always listens to you.
Yeah.
So I'm going to review some kind of an anti-semitis.
Is that what you're saying, sir?
No, sir.
Oh, I just...
What do you mean miserable, too?
What does that mean?
I'm not miserable at all.
I can't stand these people.
You what?
I just can't stand these people.
What people?
Jews.
So that's what I just asked you.
I said, are you anti-semitic?
And then you said, no, I'm not anti-semitic.
I mean, I don't think.
I'm not anti-semitic, but I just...
You just can't stand Jews, yeah.
You do what I need, I got it.
So what's your point?
What's the...
You've had to change your heart.
Anyway, anyway, I found...
I'm driving in the car with my friend and he's like...
He's like, listen, this guy is not a Jew.
He's an atheist, right?
Yes.
Well, I just want to let you know I'm going to start listening to you.
Well, for you, I'll make an exception.
I'm as Jewish as they come and I am circumcised, too, by the way.
But I don't just offer a date.
56670560, pound 560 on a mobile one line.
And that's amazing.
And again, another moron who didn't understand the reason that I was wearing the armakers
that I was making fun of the whole practice of putting beanies on your head.
Too stupid to understand that.
And you want to know why, sir?
Because you were blinded by your bigotry.
That was the problem.
Just like Josh says, okay, if those Arabs would stop being blinded by those schmothers
that weren't on their heads.
If they would just see the fourth for the trees.
And I don't play the faux-fer change in his name to the fourth.
I mean, Rogers always worked good for me.
22 before 1 at 560WQA.
I'm one of the Friday US kids.
We're built to cause Monica the China.
All right.
You let the other gay go.
When he makes it we go.
Monica is not the kind.
You can do in the behind.
Put a cigar in her vagina.
She don't mind.
Correct them.
Well, he don't know where a soggy goes.
I can see how there was some confusion between humor, door, and human horror.
Yes.
And then Arkansas, the term Cedar Bach, means saw her naked.
Stars report can lead to going blind.
Woohoo.
That's my thing.
He was working hard late nights in the overrear fence.
Working on a practical joke.
He took a mac and noodle, put an explode in.
Loading for Monica was blowing rings us slow.
Builds the cause and Monica the China.
She let's start a gay go.
Every time he makes it we go.
Monica is not the kind.
You can do in the behind.
No.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, before feel that Hillary's been made a fool of biodegradin.
Feel that Hillary was wronged.
Up in the Lincoln bedroom, she was born in morning.
And our door was doing her with bills old bomb.
Builds the cause and Monica the China.
She let's start a gay go.
Every fricking time he makes it we go.
Monica is not the kind.
You can do in the behind.
But us, a car and her, but John, a sheet all by.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's not the right.
Oh, yeah.
What you got to do is take a tin marillo.
And put it in the ground.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
From 45 to 560 WQM, I haven't done this because it's very depressing, but never
less.
For the first time since Madeline Murillo hair vanished in 1995, investigators said the
nation's foremost atheist and two of her children were killed and the crime was orchestrated by
her former office manager and applauded to steal $600,000.
Oh.
And first I'm sure he's a good religious.
So another example of the non-believers being murdered by the believers who want to rip off
their money.
That's basically what it's all about.
If you're looking for their bodies, by the way, they might be an oil drum, some of their
smells too good right now.
Well, she was getting old.
Here's Sunrise.
Hello.
With two question marks, by the way.
Hello.
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
I have a preview for the 1 o'clock hour.
How come there are two question marks on this phone call?
I'm just a computer here.
I'm sitting in for the old man who went to go get hot gay sex, Cuba, Cuba, Montana.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Here's the mobile invoker.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Okay.
If you'd hate this, uh.
Go ahead, George.
Hello.
What is it?
If I hate this town, how come I'm here?
Oh.
Yeah.
What does that mean?
Yeah.
You know, it's good playing about how you can't stand the town of Florida.
Why are you here?
The town of Florida's Florida Townsor.
Oh, what?
You were to find it on the map.
You know where to find it?
You know what I'm saying.
You hate it so much.
Why are you here?
I like your show, and I'm just curious.
You're a curiosity-kill-the-cat, okay?
Yeah.
Maybe I like it here.
Are you like it here?
I said maybe I like it here, but it would be boring to say I like it here.
It's more exciting to say it's a grotesque.
Okay.
So you do it for...
I didn't say what I'd do it for.
Maybe I hate it here.
Maybe I like it.
I'd rather be an indigma.
Keep you guessing, okay?
Okay.
Anybody think I love it here?
No.
Okay.
I'm making a lot of money here.
Pal, I'm doing okay.
And like I said, I don't give a crap anymore.
Now I really love it here.
I'm not going to worry about professionalism and about people doing things right.
And about people running business the way it ought to be.
Forget about that.
This is Florida.
We do it the Florida F and Way, man.
Get with the program.
WQAM.
Going once.
See, every time I pick it up cold, man,
if I have the greatest luck, it's always something that I catch off guard who's waiting to do like some crap, you know?
A little crap up their sleeve.
Every time.
Because it's like dealing with a bunch of schools you'll be doing this show.
That's what I've discovered over these last 70 or 80 years have been doing this show in Miami.
It's like dealing with a bunch of little school kids.
And like I said before, some of these people are honest to God adults in their 30s and 40s and 50s.
And what were they like when they were kids, you know?
What were they like when they were younger?
Were they assholes then too?
Is that what it was?
Because when you were an asshole, when you're young, the logic is that maybe when you get old, you'll be an old asshole.
I think that makes a lot of sense to me.
You know what I'm getting at?
I think you do.
Here's Pompato Beach.
Hello.
Pompato Beach.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you?
Okay.
You keep it in the same hot to see it's finished here.
Yes.
Are you?
Uh-huh.
Got a question for you.
How do you make four gay men in a bar half?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Another joke.
Another guy with nothing to say.
Okay.
Who starts out of my keeping the same hockey seats?
Are you writing a book, sir?
Oh, well, quite frankly, if you're going to be sitting close to those seats, I might reconsider.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Pompato Beach.
Yes, sir.
Hey, how are you doing today, sir?
Great.
Never been better, pal.
I've got over my little indigestion I had.
And I'm feeling real good.
I'm going to get out of this town and God only knows what will happen.
Well, I know you're probably not going to want to talk about it, but how about two bars?
What about it?
Well, you're going to get winning after that.
I saw it.
Yes, of course I saw it.
You stew barns.
Who was the one that was screaming when we gave away stew bars and also Jason Wolley, by the way,
who had the first goal for Buffalo the other night, huh?
Exactly.
Yeah, exactly what.
You don't have to sell me on stew barns.
He's a hell of a clutch player.
I know that.
Yeah, I should ask you.
You should ask Doug McLean and Brian Murray about how about that stew barns.
Where's what's Doug McLean doing now?
He's sitting up there in Columbus.
We were waiting for the straight jackets to start.
No chance that he's going to come back into the internet.
He's with Columbus.
He got a job up there.
So he's not coming back here.
He's coming back to St. Louis Phil Henry's coming back.
Oh, God.
Here's the man who didn't like Marty Strocka.
Didn't like stew barns.
Doug McLean, they like you know he was a good guy.
Good sit down comedian.
Was he a good judge of talent?
No.
Is he coming back?
Huh?
No.
Don't start pretending about hockey with me, sir.
The people in here in this town, hockey, and you're hockey, you know nothing about it.
Stick to something you know about.
Like early bird dinners and outcome I hate Florida so much.
Stick with the maturity and know something about.
Very limited categories.
You know what I'm talking about?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's it.
Stick with that.
You're excellent with that.
There's nobody in the world better than that than the Floridian.
Yeah.
Especially in soft Florida.
Over on the west coast, you people in Fort Myers, you better work on your...
Yeah.
So you can catch up with us.
10-4-1 at 5-60 WQM.
And the George Rodriguez show between 1 and 2, so that guy who called a couple of minutes ago
was Montana and that you were busy talking to somebody.
That was one of your banshers, by the way.
One of those assholes.
I got news for you.
Okay.
George does a fine job.
And even though he's off in full a crap, never less than that.
You know, we're not here for content.
We're here to do a show.
We're here to entertain.
We're here to help to kill a little time in your life.
You know what I'm talking about?
And beat that gator me.
Shutter who say the mother f***er.
Shutter who say the mother f***er.
Shutter who say the mother f***er.
Shutter who say the mother f***er.
I racked the crappy little constraint.
That was like the mustache on a face.
Yes.
Just get rid of that.
You're in drinking chubby and blow up the whole bad damn place.
Shutter who say the mother f***er.
Shutter who say he's the mother f***er.
Shutter who say he's the mother f***er.
Shutter who say he's the mother f***er.
What time?
Shutter who say the mother b***er.
Shutter who say he's a mother f***er.
Shutter who say he's the mother f***er.
Shutter who say he's the mother f****er.
So George just made during the break just as it was about to end by the way.
Aren't you leaving now?
See the reason I did that is because it's a force to have it.
I'm used to running the last break at 10 to 2 as opposed to right before 2
because I don't want to backspot in a hang show because no only assholes do things like that.
Like every now and then at the morning show and I really don't play them
because when they got their format, what are they going to do anyway?
When you got all spots radio.
And now that I understand that, I don't play them as much,
although in Dito's case, I'm not going to exception.
But at any rate, so that's the reason I did that.
I'm going to have a force to have it.
So here I am stuck with another 5 minutes here where I could be out there.
I could be already down in the car.
I could be out there, where she is right now.
But why would I want to do that when I can talk to a lady in Indiana?
Hello.
I have an idea for you.
Okay, double jeopardy is not legal in United States, but it is in other countries.
So we need to find out where it's legal and we can send OJ there and they can try them again.
Do you like that?
No.
Okay, bye-bye.
Okay.
She's calling from Indiana allegedly, but she sounded like the Ditsy broad to me, didn't she?
Huh?
She wasn't from Indiana.
Maybe she was from Boy Gary, Indiana.
Maybe that was Boy Gary doing a voice.
Anybody seen him lately, by the way?
No.
Yeah, we want to apologize to Steve Nichol to Boy Gary to everybody, because now that we've
met Todd Dreck, now we really understand what's scraping the barnacles off the bottom of the ship is all about.
Man who doesn't have the cajon's to come in here and deal with his accounts.
A man who, like, you know, serotonously is running around in the middle of the night whispering and writing graffiti on a wall.
And uttering all of these things.
Like, Neil is weird, really weird.
And here's Davey.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Did you see the movie The Unforgiven?
No.
Well, they had to sign up in front of this town for no firearms.
I know I'm being naive.
But why can't we get some kind of referendum certain places about not having firearms in our county and so forth and so on?
By the way, also Mr. Rodriguez show is excellent.
I would even consider listening like listening and better than you when I love your show.
Right, better than me.
Oh, that's good.
And he's good.
He still sounds like a fact, but he's good.
Yeah, huh.
But, um, the NH.
Well, okay.
Another guy with no material.
One of your biggest fans, okay?
He sounded like Kathy Bates to me.
Here's a lady in Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, man.
Hi, Neil. This is the elevator lady.
Hello.
The elevator lady?
Yeah, from the Panther game.
Oh, it's too long ago.
It doesn't matter.
I'm calling to that lady.
Oh, yeah, from the older lady, you mean?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, in a while.
From 100 years ago.
Oh, yeah, okay.
Good.
This is for Jim Baker, not a little Hitler guy that calls.
You didn't realize that you're not an atheist.
You're God.
Yeah.
I want to let them know that.
No, I just don't like, I just want to let you know that I did.
That really bothers me when people are so ignorant.
What bothers you that there's anti-short hands?
Yeah, exactly.
Big of a chopper?
Yeah, it's ridiculous.
It bothers me.
It really bothers me.
It's warmly, you know?
Well, maybe somebody else steals his beanie for the holidays.
They shouldn't take the show so seriously, either.
Okay, have a great weekend.
Bye.
That's right.
They shouldn't take the show so seriously.
See, you're taking them seriously.
It's only business and you're taking it personal.
You know what I'm saying?
Just calm down, lighten up, have 30 or 40 more beers.
It's the American F and Wayne.
Enjoy your Memorial holiday.
Anyway, we've backed myself into a corner here.
But you know what?
There's always an easy way out.
For trading outside this beanie, don't you betray me?
I have to support holiday.
It's still a lot of time to allow her.
Well, a word is no more beer than I've got no beer.
Won't be nowhere to miss, don't be for me.
If I go and live, and move that beer,
the choir's taste that leads you in for you.
Oh!
They easily disgusted.
They said it's heinous.
But like a faith man, I'm so good in your ainus.
Oh!
If it's like a fan, it's gonna be.
Don't be that thing to write a scene.
Your mood is shining on the beam.
It's like a penny to me.
Well, say that you've prayed.
The tongue-latches I just gave.
Makes the hair of my dad's fan straight up.
Now I'm all real.
I'm out of my tongue off in your Cooper.
You tellin' I'm cute, tellin' it's difficult.
I got a mustache B to B C.
My friend told me in number two,
I heard you yelling Chacha,
but I prefer you to do.
You heard it's like a petty thing.
The feeling is made to write things.
The moon is shining on the beam.
It's like a penny to me.
That's the only way that K.Y.
is Arlin.
I'm goin' and strifein' like a...
Shut me, I'll ball her chin.
Things get not daily when I see rail door to room to room.
They're holostos and I'm goin' through.
When what I do,
please make feelings like a man.
You'll find it hard to sit down
when I get done with your can.
Are you sure?
It's like a penny to me.
We've been surviving.
Your moon is shining on the beam.
It's like a penny to me.
It's like a penny to me.
