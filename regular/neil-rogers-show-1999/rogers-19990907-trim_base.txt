their desperate to get a real talent on that station besides reconciles are belonging after none of course
how do you like that fill hundred we're we're gonna have them here on q an no what would you
folks rather here would you rather her ed cappelin with compulsive gambling in the same stupid sports
course at night every night from ten o'clock at night and of course we couldn't do it anyway you want
to know why because we got all those stupid god damn ball games on there if it isn't a baseball
game it's a hockey game if it isn't a hockey game it's some stupid football game we got games we got
games up the record games that haven't been invented yet games up the duck and ass that's what we got
and by the way speaking of that word see while i was going this time on vacation i had like about
five minutes i must have had like imagine what it was maybe a mental fog brain fart
about five minutes i thought about this place and i thought about that fine you know this
alleged fine which i still don't know the status of any of that because they're not bothering to talk
to me which is fine with me do you say fine let me trust you yeah fine and i thought to myself you know
we're like a bunch of children in this country we have to play these games with the FCC and prove to
them that we're sufficiently a subdued they've subdued us you know okay okay we won't say crap
and for a while there they had us putting in the bleeps and that was supposed to be okay but
then evidently from what we found out this last time maybe it is maybe it's not we're just not
going to tell you we'll let you know after we decide we'll give you a fine okay that's how we're
going to do it we'll play the game so i decided i'll just start my own new vocabular and i'll say
whatever the hell words i want we just leave the first letter off of every word in the in the universe
that sounds fine to me then you don't have to worry about was the bleep long enough was it uh you
because they put the bus see i think what they did is they heard vana up there at the FCC
yeah she's sticking the vowels in there we take them out she keeps sticking them back in there
we see s h t t they stick the eye back in there again they stick the
back in there again even though we bleeped it out yeah they stick it in there again
so i say therefore a hit is what i say that's right a bunch of bullhead just just take the letter
out take the one offending letter out and make up your own word okay like usy and
ok and all these other words that we can't say on a year that's going to be my new approach to
broadcasting because i say up the FCC is what i say ok them big time bunch of mother-uckers the word
police a bunch of silly silly people up there who think that they're going to subdue us and just
make it up as they go along oh yeah we're going to nail that we're going to get them the knuckle under
that's my comment to you okay so what did i miss while i was going huh must have been a lot of
upsetting crap happened down here i have nothing read a lot 10 beautiful days in Amsterdam did it rain
one drop no sunny it was low 70 72 75 low 50s at night nice breeze oh it was great

creative this guy what nobody with a brain sereness is this something that they don't like what I
want is to talk about something anything that's going on here anything that I've mentioned anything
that I haven't mentioned anything that's going on in the real world if you consider this part of
it we consider this well let's stretch it a little bit that's what I want to talk about not how
boring George was if he didn't like it you didn't have to listen very simple just like now if you
know like it you don't have to listen doesn't doesn't face me at least but I'm sitting here on his
trend that just came out we've got some of the highest numbers I've ever had in the history of my life
we're number two and twelve plus ten to three we're number one and twenty five and number two
and twenty five fifty four with a uh over a seven share between ten am and two pm we got a six
eight from ten to three we're doing over a seven share eighteen to thirty four persons which
isn't even our demographic we got a seven point one between ten and three means we're doing over
an eight share that's persons and then we're doing double digits eighteen to thirty four that's an
FM demographic we're kicking serious ass and I care whether you were bored whether George was I don't
if you liked it fine if you didn't like it fun it makes no difference to us we're doing the best

hey stupid to the sixth to seven that seven that six or five we got talking baseball donny b
doctors at the marlins at the six thirty the pregame seven oh five the game tonight any interest in
that no they had twelve thousand rain soak alleged in that ballpark yesterday probably about twenty
five hundred people really showed up and on a front page of the paper all this is where John
Henry wants to build a stadium he's narrowed it down that's what Barry Jackass says on the front
cover the same newspaper by the way that last summer was telling us oh yeah Don smiley that
deal's almost done now it'll be done any day now one day it was the hero the next day will be
the sun sent well one day was very jackass the next day was Alan snow every day with miss with
misinformation on the front page nice going guys and as far as John Henry's concerned
one million pounds for needle rod to season the his out like I said see I just I don't really care
at this point and I'm saying I just don't care I'm indifferent just give me the money and I'll
just show up every day because this audience they just tear your kishki's out they just they
they take your heart out you know you coming with the best of intentions and then you know
don't care after like five minutes just like this thing about the Cox broadcasting this isn't
this isn't a talent driven industry anymore not at all this is strictly a monopoly game that's
what the government's made it into Cox broadcasting swaps KFI AM and cop the coast FM in Los Angeles KOSD
for 14 radio stations from AMFM Inc including EDR here in Miami so now they got Cox broadcasting
got three stations here in Miami two of the three are spartial stations how do you like that
do you like an ad or what no I bet your Bob and Cheryl like that a lot
yeah they can be minorities right there in their own building now they'll find out what it is
to be are they already know what it's like here's sunrise hello hello yes sir Neil how you doing
welcome back it's good to hear from you and I was gonna say is what give me a cool place I can
go to an Amsterdam what does that mean well I'm I'm getting ready to go there in November and I was
wondering you know you can give me a good place to go to and visit you know smoke a couple of
cigarettes the greenhouse effect the greenhouse effect yeah oh man can I call somebody to do
spy no five six seven oh five sixty go to the stable master pal you'll enjoy those jack off parties five
six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line here's Miami hello
hey Neil he's already in training for me yes sir how are you great I figured out the problem with
with the with the audience that caller about 25 30 minutes ago could have nice that the one
was talking about the parking on this can't go right now this guy was putting me into a coma here's
the problem that whole that whole price hike or what it is it's a tax on parking downtown was all
detailed in the Miami herald all the guy has to do is pick up a newspaper once a day turn off
wwf and mtv and pick up a newspaper and find out what the hell's going on right I know I know it's
hard thing to do in this time because of the mind it was the most boring call I can't even imagine
anything being more boring than that but the guy he even a virgin tender guy but the guy pulls
into the parking lot downtown if he read a newspaper he would be prepared for yeah so that's
that's the problem uh turn off mtv and pick up a guy I don't care I'm not I don't want to sound
in different I mean I don't care about his parking problems and nobody else does either yeah
but it just it drives me crazy because people they walk around on the fog all the time I mean
I see what you mean about the you know the majority of the people this is this is La La land I've
been telling you that for a hundred years and I call somebody a douchebag five six seven oh five
sixty yeah count five sixty on the AT&T wireless line here's a mobile in Miami hello hello new yes
sir I'd like to give you as you say the real Simmons with George the real uh Simmons
Simmons came in the end of the end of the year yetish right man remember the crossby swill
and I saw no teacher uh children the yiddish right I'm going look at you going he had a very good
show he's not you you're you he's been I could tell you why are we wasting our time with this
you're exactly has been doing my vacations now for a long time we'll continue doing them and
and why does the audience feel I need to hear a critique every time I come back George had a very
eclectic show you could tell you what eclectic show he out of that too spanish that he looks a
little spastic from it yeah look at that doctor he's cut from the same old issue you can tell he's got
no he's not he's nothing to do like me it's got a little bit of the iron a little bit of the sarcasm
yeah that you have but he's him the show was an entertaining show and any of these idiots that
they're calling up they just have to judge George first all these swing clubs because George
believes that he knows something about the sexual reality of life and I just finished reading
another Gord Vidal book by the way George knows nothing about sex he knows nothing about life
and he's into this you know this terminally Cuban mentality which he is in denial about but
that's him you know which is great that's him and I mean I found that interesting I mean it's a
fantasy mind to go to a swing club my wife would kill me let me ask you sir in all honesty how much
do we need to hear about fricking swing clubs already George has got through the win a whole week on
swing clubs well like I said I'd never heard about it before except no an occasional reference but
I found it entertaining and for anybody who says different I mean school it go great exactly kiss
my head exactly and I hope he says the same thing I mean I hope he doesn't lose any sleep over
these idiot calls sir nobody on this side of the radio loses any sleep over callers probably
my thing oh hey ratings or everything and have a great day right ratings the everything and we're
kicking ass baby this friend we just got here is so big that buddy never does probably poking his
eyeballs out right now just thinking about it with little opinions little pricks
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line who was that that's our contractor guess what we're
getting because I have to try to come the air about it we're getting a real exhaust suction
fan for that bathroom so we can breathe in there and a light over the stall so that we don't have
to guess when we wipe it out what does that have to do I thought we're getting something that has
to do with a radio show like a real phone system or something you've never gone in that bathroom
after Jeff Hyde was in there no of course not oh see you would sympathize if that ever happened to
you if I if I see him coming out of there and I have to go real bad bad I just use a plastic bag
from publics I would never go in there after he came off here's Oakland Park hello yes Neil yes sir
welcome back on that help oh man of buddy I might have to cut this short because I'm on break
at work but yeah man of buddy might come on for the conclusion on your show is uh
George is actually the real homo and you're probably straight correct yeah right
I mean uh you okay five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless lines we
continue searching for our first real call of the day we found one yet no but it's only a ten after
eleven Hank Goldberg show coming up at two today and you can talk about where they're going to
stick that new stadium I hear the rumor that the big location for it's going to be buddy never
been back down in sunny insides an inside job that's the rumor that I'm hearing and how come nobody
has fact me that article by the way if indeed there was one that appeared how come we don't have it
yet there's our facts machine working and we're we seeing one facts yet this morning no even from
the chronic factors no no there's something wrong here man something really really you can smell it
nine minutes after eleven at five sixty wqm you know Floridians dumb after we took it back
you cleaner attach some crazy scissors to the end of the nozzle and voila we created the flowbee
unfortunately no one bought it but now we're trying again we're taking a vacuum cleaner attaching
some other crazy stuff to the end of the nozzle and boom we created the all new blow me
and the best part is I only look stupid when I'm actually using it half the three weeks afterwards
like a float call from me hey the name of the product what do you want by yours today
looking for 14 at five sixty wqm by the way did we get one call about Phil Henry when I read the
release which is an accurate release about his show has been syndicated starting September 29
did you get one call when I asked would you rather he had cappell and ten o'clock at night to one
in the morning or Phil Henry one call no and how many calls have we had since Phil Henry went off the
year when Paxen bought WIOD how many calls wouldn't you like to have a dollar for every call we've had
about that have we had one today no no just to show you though that we're not being outdone by
the Cox people are got EDR now and hot 105 they got all the sparsers of corned now
leave it to a glaze your company like Cox Broadcasting to corner the sparser market nice go on boys
boys
Beasley Broadcasting not to be outdone of course they don't do business with AMFM they do business with people like
Forest Communications which by the way as of this transaction which I'll read you in a moment has no more
radio holdings in the monopoly game called radio broadcasting and I'll also call television broadcasting since the latest FCC
a charade
the Naples Florida base group Beasley Broadcasting picks up two Atlanta AM's AM stations they're buying
for ten million dollars that's why you can't have your bonus yet George because it cost them ten
million dollars to buy two AM stations W A E C and W W W E A M guess what the format is of these
stations by the way Beasley says it plans to keep the religious format currently airing on the
airways on both stations oh oh oh oh I don't even like that uh this is the kind of people that
work stuck working for that's why George can't get his bonus that's why we can't get a new phone
system in here because they're spending ten million dollars on two religious stations God damn it
when you know what I say to the Beasley's up them that's what I say to them yeah and your mama too
here's Hollywood hello yes I'm concerned about what happened out in in the mile high stadium
oh they're riot I mean I saw like a four play on it but I didn't see the whole story last
none of us what happened it could so well first of all college football game right the college
football game and the team that law that that one or lost I don't really remember what rioted
and they virtually tore up the place and what do you mean you don't mean the team rioted you mean
their fans rioted yeah it was like a soccer game and you know right and uh it's it's it's such
concern I have friends that are in law enforcement that they're getting technical advice from
Chicago in regard to use the forces in regard to proud cow control crowd control and uh I think
it's setting a trend and I think you're going to see it occur more and more often and uh
another good reason to stay home by the way another good reason we don't need to build another
stadium well unfortunately public money they're going to build another stadium where you like it or
not uh just think about the stadium the built in Cleveland uh the stadiums they built for uh
other other communities uh that they shove through they'll still they'll find it find a way
of doing it they'll the masses are are ignorant they don't give it damn about anything except
watching TV and uh and ball games and ball games yeah so they'll have a day better to listen to
people that call the sportsers you think we got bad colors listen to the sports there's that call
I've said it a million times before I'll say it again and you think of yourself this is scary
that there are people out there that this is what their life consists of this is the kind of
stuff that they're concerned about well when 42% of the people who graduate can't read their diploma
yeah we got problems boy they know pal I have a nice day by the way welcome back and thank you so
much I've been seeing you five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18 T wireless line
let's go we got any women today except that one freeloading bitch had called before no no
and George said he he had women up the breakfast we've now that may have been into swing club
he's talking about not only here he said he had a zillion calls from women up their last week
and now what you said couple now that's not what you said few you said that you had a ton of
billion billion billion that's what you said all the sex talk they were calling up saying they want
theirs too here's Miami Lakes hello thank god you're back and thank god about that information
about Phil Henry that you know how come nobody cares about that that's the best news that there
is better for you sure yes that's how what's it they want to keep people on all week while you
were gone you would say like Phil Henry he was going to play some Phil Henry yeah and you couldn't
get off the you know you had to keep listening hoping that Phil was going to come on because you know
well that swing club crap really sucked okay it's great all we need now is how would you and
Phil and we have we could be on the radio all day long yeah and what about between two and 10

yes because I was better when you when it was like that animar okay hang sucks okay do you feel
better now I feel so much better when we have things close one last thing he's a tub not as bad as
he used to be but he's a tub you see if you can get along pretty good with man this and I really
think he's a long a fault no he's not always not now he's always talking about the shard may sit in

myself okay well one of these okay he took a lot of showers with guys okay just to think about it

quickly okay I don't promise I promise okay this is a promise I was uh you mentioned something
about George's denial about Cuban being Cuban I don't think that he's in denial at all I think
he's just telling it how it is being being a Cuban that was born in America and raised in America
he's just seeing it from a very intelligent perspective no he's not oh no no why not because he's
a professional Cuban who's in denial about being a professional Cuban he's obsessed with it
that that he can't let go of it he's not obsessed he's not sure you're wrong I know him
like a book he's obsessed he he's driven by it he's driven by it because he he can't stand the fact
that Cubans could be the way they are he can't stand it he's a Cuban who can't say okay well
say goodbye there's nothing wrong goodbye thanks for the free shrink for the free analysis and have a
great day they either want to talk about the show you did last week it was great or it's
sucked away or they want to analyze you now he this is what happens when you become a big superstar

well let's let's make an effort okay okay okay all right thank you all right you're gonna make
an effort no now now we got all those stupid ball games they'll never go for it but nobody cares

like everything else here nobody cares if I said Phil Hendry just walked in the door he's gonna be
doing two to six this afternoon Hank had decided to take the day off with anybody care no no you

Besides the food isn't very good.
And that is too many shfarts.
That's the only problem.
If you were to ask me what's the one negative that you would say about Amsterdam and the Netherlands.
Too many shfarts.
Other than that, it's like heaven.
Here's a mobile in my knee.
Hello.
Hi Neil.
Welcome back.
Thank you so much.
Is this a lady?
Yes, it's a lady.
I've been listening for a long time to your show.
A who yet lady no less.
Yes.
And I am Cuban.
And I am ecstatic that Phil Henry is coming back to town because I think he's...
Well, first of all, I don't know if he's coming back to town.
His show is being syndicated.
Well, at least it's a hope.
Huh?
At least it's a hope.
I think it's a good chance.
I would think if they got any brains over there at all, which I doubt.
But if they do, you know, clear channel will put them on.
Very good.
I mean, if we had any brains, we'd put them on, but we don't.
Of course.
You and Phil are the best thing that ever happened to this town.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
I agree.
Neil, on your many trips to Las Vegas, have you got chance to see that new show O at the Veladjou yet?
It's called O.
No.
No, not yet.
Not yet.
Okay.
Oh, like Neil.
Is it good?
Well, it's terrific.
Terrific.
And it's well done.
Oh, yeah.
It's a Cirque du Soleil.
It's got another one at the Tritio Island.
Okay.
I'll check him out.
Great.
I'll be there another.
Thank you so much for your wit and keep it up.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Have a great day.
There's a nice lady, a holy yet no less, who didn't want nothing.
Okay.
Actually, it was nice.
Who wanted the big girl she wanted.

part uh... let's say like the sounds of the ballpark
and the crack of the back
and he'll make like
you'll make a whole show that
but hilarious
and the outfield they'll say all the time you still on his head he smashed his head
in
uh... it was incredible
it was incredible but i'm not like you'll take like classical music and
the governor
i see how it is a good that those were not my favorite bill and we showed like
when we do that ball game thing
that was something that uh... would have been good for about you know twenty
minutes and
filled with the n again it was because people would call him
so he would drag it out make like a two or three hour bit out of it and it
really uh... cut pondras
yeah but what is all of the love for that was not his best of by any stretch
it was funnier than that at least i was better in full than half of the
sportscasters give on this
this
for station
during a ball game that is
you know
at first what i hear
at it he's hilarious i just hope he comes back in uh...
i just thought i'd say you have great show like everyone else is saying
because i have a little more than everyone else is saying everybody's very upset
that i'm back
that's yes the audience is very very put out i'm considering taking another
couple months off i was having a great time i interrupted my life so i can
come back to do this and uh... you know i'm having second thoughts about it
you probably ready to go to Italy
now i'm ready to go back to Amsterdam
have a great day pal
you do back to you
well i unfinished work there believe me
five what you're laughing about
five six seven o five sixty pound five sixty
on the eight t and t wireless line
here's palm springs north hello
meal
yesterday i don't really often
uh...
philandry
it was the excuse me for being stupid but
it was uh...
indicated with time would come on i mean would be like delayed or
ten at night to a in the morning seven to ten in Los Angeles is ten at night
to one in the morning here
which would be perfect for us here instead of that
uh... gambling show we got a night that narrow casting show with an audience
about five hundred compulsive gamblers in a uh... phone booth somewhere
but the best places be a half right after you
yeah i mean how you have to do that well
i don't know but i can come in the morning
but this guy's in the morning but yeah well
but there's nothing else to listen to in this in in my amy anyway so i got
a listen to him
i mean it's it's it's not here radio sucks in this time it's weak it's the
worst but that i can
uh... i'm embarrassed to be a part of it
that's all i got okay pal thanks for the good news
okay six hundred open lines here will ever make it till noon i mean it's a
forget about two o'clock that's a given that that that guarantee that there's no
chance
but till noon that's only twenty three minutes away we're not gonna make it
till the
what course you come back after ten days away when it is in the way you want to
like jump in all four hours
couldn't put a ball game on today uh... let's let's put the tape on
yeah let's play the rangel a part of yesterday's ballgame
was the rangel a two or three hours let's play the rangel a part
from before yesterday's marlin their big smashing victory yesterday
against another you know if you took if you took the and they're all excited
because they want fifty five games which is one more than they want to ask you
if you took away the games that they want against Tampa Bay
Montreal and teams that were like swooning when they play the elected
dodgers if you took those wins away they wouldn't have twenty five wins
much less fifty five
but i'm a bad guy i'm a caveman i can't wait to see that but he never
spiced
and when you know i got really courageous punk like him would wait till i go
on vacation to write a piece about that
whatever the hell it was
although i will say this at least he wrote something
the time jica ever write anything about that last spring rating book no
about that fcc fine no well i came to okay while we're at it
yeah you're real you're real genius did he ever write that story about dick
caster the one radio maven it was ever in this market the ever right about
him no because he too god damn lazy to go out and talk to the people and find
out what the caster did here because that was before his time
you're just like all the rest of the time okay strictly bush league
strictly bush league
if i it's convenient for you know if if if there's nothing else going on if
it's convenient maybe you'll make the effort to write something
as opposed to really covering it like with a blanket
and i got news for you time i mean i look all that great but if i had a head
like that i cover with a blanket
or with something
oh
some say don't ever watch sugar ray and that's good advice by the way all
your kids out there if you're playing hooky today from school don't ever watch
sugar ray you'll start breaking out in the hives
even your back home will start itching bad i'm telling you
i'm getting a twitch right now i just tasted your snapper
congratulations get alive
these eyes
what
we look like
I'm not a saint, he's a saint in a day
Oh, big friends, I swear I'll be your old girl
The sacred and cute SMD, yeah
As they get older they all figure out
We're hiding our late-tencey
One thing is for sure again
Let it join you
Why so close, what a delicate cycle
What a stupid choice I should make your fire go
But today we think that we have better say
We still win our game
I still win our game
145 and 560 WQM
Nice going there Brooke Sweetheart with that big one point
Oh!
The person's 2554 and his latest trend
She's dropping, she's going to all points in the next book
I'll tell you that right now
Summer book, she's going to be in the minus column
So anyway, this Jim Druckenmiller story
And I guess I own a poundy to try to bring it up before
But you know, I got a little bit nervous when I heard that
Jimmy, this and Jimmy that
Because I don't want to start that crap
Okay, we got 20 hours of that swill
Of that garbage on this radio station
20 hours every day of your life of these sports nerds
Jimmy Farts, we got to hear what flavor it was
And did it affect his hair?
Is it still all in place?
Is it in place?
Oh, thank God
But this Jim Druckenmiller guy
I think the reason he originally was interested
Because he liked his name
But I forgot, this is the kid
Who was found innocent in Blacksburg, Virginia
Of an alleged rape
He was on trial for rape and got off on it
But still faces a lawsuit filed by two men
Who say he and three other men assaulted them
They were a Blacksburg bar
That is still pending
So now we find out why Jimmy wanted him
And got him on the dolphins, okay?
Because even if you were acquitted on something
I mean rape, there you go, that's a good one
And he's still got other crap pending
If you have crap pending, Jimmy likes you
You were disgrace, man
You were disgrace
And the people that suck up to that stuff
They were a bigger disgrace
5670560, by the way, Robert
Thank you for the facts
Robert says
Bring in fill because Eddie is a piece of hit
That's bad, okay?
That's really bad
I call Eddie a K
And he also says JJ,ucking sucks
Nice going there, Robert
5670560, pound 5660 on the AT&T wireless line
Here's Miami, hello
Hello?
Yes, sir
Hey, Neil, yeah
We just saw like a lot of people listen to Billy and kids
I don't listen to the show
People might 24-teen angels try to get his tapes and stuff
Yeah
And supposedly, you know, hours of genius
And you're good with radio stinks here
And I think seven to ten
It would be the perfect time
Because there's nothing on TV
You don't understand what's on it
You're missing the point, he's on seven to ten in LA
That's ten to one, our time, ten to ten
That's fine
I agree it's fine
He has a better time than during the day, personally
For me, at least
And for a lot of people
And for me too
And I'm not going to fill but I've heard his tapes and want him
Because he actually appeals to a much younger audience
I think a lot of talk radio
And Miami definitely does
Yeah
So, I hope he comes back
I hope he's syndicated here
Okay, well how come the people at ClearChannel are so stupid
He's going to be syndicated
Starting September 29th
We just don't know who's going to carry him locally
And if they are, why aren't they telling us so because
Obviously, this would be the place to put the information out
Yeah, the promoting in here is down here at all
Oh, no
What's up with that?
Okay, I'm promotion
This guy's talking about AM radio
And the promotion in the same way
If you like that
This guy's got a great sense of humor
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60
5, 6, 6, 7, 18, and T-line
Let's hear it for the beesleaves
Who brought those two religious stations in Atlanta for $10 million
So George can't get his motor
They said we don't really want the stations
In fact, we might just shut them off
We just spent the $10 million so we can't have an excuse not to pay people the money we own
Because that's just the way we like doing business
We're just porky like that
It's just our nature
We're just a bunch of porky red necks
In case you haven't noticed
Here's for a lottery deal
Hello
Neil, yes sir
Are you ever actually in town when
When George is on the air?
No
So you just hear people calling and say he does a great job?
I mean sometimes like if I'm leaving to go to the airport
I'll hear him on the way to the airport
Sometime for a few minutes
He's terrible
He's unlistenable
Well what does that mean?
It's terrible
So
And
So they shouldn't have him on the air?
I mean have you listened to that?
It's not worth the time
Yes I have
What did I just get you saying, you sir?
And you think he's good?
I think he does fine
I think he's getting better every time that he's on
I think he tries to be you
And I think he's overwhelming the...what is it?
He tries to be you but he doesn't have any sense of humor
He talks about the same things you do
But when you talk about it it's funny
Yeah
But he talks about it
Here's my suggestion for you
Okay, next time he's on, find something else to do
That's my suggestion
Because it'll be next time I'm not here he'll be on
I'm less like yesterday
Which was a holiday and we both had to do it off
It'll be a take
You just don't get it, do you sir?
Or some of you other people?
I don't care
Okay, I've heard George plenty
Unlike times when I go to Toronto or wherever I'm going to Vegas
And I'm on the way to the airport
And George takes over the middle of the show
I hear him on the way to the airport
And yeah he's a little spick
But he's doing just fine
And he's better than those tapes
That's the option you got
Do you want to hear those boring tapes
A little crap from that's like totally outdated?
No
No, no! That's the choice you got
Okay, and don't give me your song and an answer about how great the tapes are
Only a jackass like Rimmer
Who has a personal grudge to bear with George
And a hate each other like Poison
Only Rimmer would say that
Which he said to me on the phone yesterday by the way
Which I don't want George to hear me saying that
So I'll say real quiet, okay?
Because they hate each other like Poison for whatever reason
He could do the show
And then he, oh yeah
He could do the show
Then you'd find out what Owing points is all about
Oh my God
I said to him yesterday
I said hey Rimmer remember those hockey shows we used to do when he said they stopped
Yeah, even he said it
And that was an understatement
It's the greatest testament to my own survivability in this market
Is that I survived those hockey shows
It's like trying to serve Halava to a bunch of Eskimos
It's just ain't going to happen baby
Ain't going to happen
How did I survive that?
How stupid could I possibly been?
They stuck
Hey we'll take some free tickets
Is this the thing where they go on the ice?
And they kick each other, crap out of each other?
Oh yeah, we'll take some free tickets to that
Oh, it's picking up that
Speaking of that sound
Have you been seeing any of these promos because Oprah starts today on Channel 4 as I'm sure you must know
With Angelo Ray interviewing
Oh yeah, everything's fine
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Every time I see her I think get the butterfly
And that this woman needs mental health
I really believe that
I believe that Angelo Ray needs assistance
I mean, she's sitting there and of course here's this totally talentless wonder
I have no clue as to what her...
She must have...
Oprah must have naked pictures of every woman in America
With a billy goater, with something
Because why else would anybody watch the swill that she puts on that vanilla crap that she puts on a year?
But even setting that aside
Here's Angelo sitting there yucking it up
And then the laughter just starts getting more and more intense
Like a crazy person
Pretty soon she's gonna start sounding like that babbling
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Yeah, like that one
I got the one point
Oh!
In the last trend
Nice going to sweetheart
Your numbers keep dropping and dropping
I hope I carry your boobs down
Drop as fast as your numbers
They'll be down to your ankles pretty soon
And don't forget to move that hot candle wax either
Oh
Here's the mobile candle
Hello
Hi dear, good morning
Yes sir
I'll take George over any of your tapes any day of the week
Amen
He wasn't bad
And one more thing, keep feeling kind of for him
I need that gambler's shot tonight, okay?
Okay, thank you
Okay, you have nothing to worry about pal
Nothing to worry about
Ed Kappel and he's also got naked pictures of Greg Reed with the...
Well
5670560
Oh, by the way, there's a character in the...
What's her name?
What's another unit of share?
It's Barbissen, the woman
That's Dr. Evil's assistant
And the Austin Powers movie
What does it name for?
I just saw it on the plane yesterday
Shag this, Shag your...
The spy who did it, you know
So anyway, her name is Freedda Barbissen, something like that
And if you want what you will eventually be sure and see it for free on TV or something
It's not worth going and spending five or six bucks to see it
It's got the... two or three of the same laughs over and over again
It's okay to kill a couple hours on a plane
But anyway, Freedda Barbissen, if she needs to water not, the...
I don't know who she is
Check that out, same person
Here's a mobile in Del Rey-B, chill out
Oh my God, and you know that Brook Daniel's laugh is terrible over the phone
She...
I can't expect you to place some fill-in reskits
No, maybe...
No
No, fill-in re is going to be syndicated
And hopefully he'll be on in the market, but this is still a near-roger show
Okay, let's not get back into that again
I love fill-in is a great talent, but we've got just a few of those things that I played eight million times
And the answer is...
No
No
5,670, the answer is...
Are you sure?
Positive
5,670, 5,660, 0.560 on the AT&T wireless line
Here's Coral Springs, hello
This is the best news I've heard in a long time
Yes, the oil is going to be on life
Sir, I don't know, I said his show is going to be syndicated
Whether it's going to be in this market or not is still up for grabs
Oh, he means it's not a sure thing
Right
Oh God, well I don't know, anyway, as for George, I look...
Are you?
I listened to him a few times and he was very interesting
There you go
Especially the stories about him and his wife
And whether they're going to make it with this couple they met
Yeah
No, that was kind of interesting
Did they?
I don't know, I mean she keeps needing the oxygen
Well see that's because he keeps forcing her to go there
He keeps licking her up all the time and dragging her in the car
She's screaming and kicking and doesn't want to go
And he keeps schlepping or enforcing her to go
She doesn't want to go
She doesn't want any part of this crap
Yeah, she's only doing it for him then
No, she's doing it because he's forcing her to do it
What a jerk
How can he do something like that?
Because like most men he's no longer satisfied
With that limited sex life that wears off after the first couple of years
He wants to expand, you know, which he already of course has on the side
Which he don't know about that part of it
But nevertheless, he wants to make her feel like she's a part of it
Which quite frankly, he'd be more than happy and up to leave her ass home
And just go by himself
Well, you know, monogamy sucks, what can I tell you?
Exactly, very well said sir
Welcome home
Thank you
Excellent, no, no, seriously, I was reading a thing which I don't dare bring up on the air
Because it'll sound like some kind of a bad conspiracy
But you know, this idea of physical attraction between people
As far as I mean, yes, there are couples that live together 40 years, 60 years, 70 years
But as far as them being sexually turned on by each other after 30 and 40 and 60 years
No
And you can call here and lie about it if you want, but you're liar
It's not true
And then they said basically two or three years
That's about the max, two or three years
After that, forget it
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60
On the AT&T wireless line
W-T-R-A-N-E-M-I-K-S-E-R-S-E-R-S
We're the same million and we're the ones who spoke of the President
So like we party, the President is a little bit awkward
On the AT&T, we watch the President's red ocean stare
As it's the power, this is what we use to do
In times we feel the hands with the truth
And times we see it facing only us from public and more
And we're on this interest over the human
And we use the special interest of the Christian rights
So they're lonely, certain things we can say
So this could save all the life
And to much push is the moment we can wait
In the cold, in the cold
In the cold, in the cold is the fact
In the cold, in the cold
What's the reason we'll be trapped?
That's that, that's that, that's that
We're looking at the same time
What's the opportunity?
Provo 205 60 WQAM, Hank Goldberg, it's to this afternoon
It's taking a brutal beating here today by the way
Permanent is pounding
And then we got the four play for the ball game
The night ball games and ball games and more ball games
That's what it's all about here on QAM
If you don't like ball games except from 10am to 2pm
You're screwed on this station
That's why you won't hear Phil Henry on QAM
Because this is Greg Reed's ball game station
Like the Marlin games, we got that Marlin game tonight
We're making money on it
No, are we losing our ass on it?
Is that the reason we can't pay George his bonus?
And all these other people are bonuses from the last reading book?
Uh-huh, there you go
Cost a lot of money to keep feeding that expensive ego
That we got there with that bad crappy haircut of his
And that real cheap suit he's always wearing
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60
Well he don't want to dress too good
He'll make the beef lose feel bad
Here's a mobile and four Myers
Hello, speaking the beef lose
Hello?
Yes sir
Hey Neil, it's Tony Lee from Four Myers
How you doing?
All right
Hey, what do I do now?
I got a hard dog on my butt
Is that funny?
You got one?
A hard dog on my butt
Dolphin toll
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60
Pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line
There's a dolphin guy for you
There's one of the sports nerds I'm talking about
In fact, that's a guy
He'll be at the first dolphin home game with a hot dog
He's sticking out of his mouth
Correcto
That'll be the guy right there
Tommy Lee
Okay
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60
Pound 5, 60
That was our West Coast contribution today
By the way, thank you so much
Allegedly in Four Myers, all the way I have my doubts
Here's a mobile and Kindle
Hello?
That's why I moved out of the West Coast
I don't blame him, man
God
You know, a network is probably one of the old time best movies as far as I'm concerned
I know you're the same way
Yes
A rented movie the other day
Bullworth with Bady
I don't really crazy about Bady or Bady
But I don't know if you've seen it or not
But man, for the 90s, it's a good runner-up to network
Really?
Oh yeah, I mean, you know, I was very surprised
Someone said that I'll read it
Bullworth is a senator that
Wasn't that a dime store?
Yeah, right, Bullworth's right
Well, the whole message when he's running for
Supposedly set back in 1996
He's running for senator re-election in California
But, you know, the message is he starts spewing
You know, basically he doesn't care
Like you want, you know, it's one of those things where if you know you're not going to live
You kind of lose all your inhibitions and
Climax, man, it's hell!
All I look for is acres and you're going to go home!
Oh man, the whole corporate, political interweaving, the conspiracy keeping the masses down
I mean, it's a great film
Had nothing to do with the promotions that they were running on TV a couple of months ago
You know, made it look like an idiot comedy film
Someone said, Rended, I rented it
I played it and played it and played it over and over and over again
I almost wore it out
So I should go, uh, rent it
I highly recommend it
You know, look at it, watch it with an open mind
You can get through the, you know, the first 20 minutes seems like I've been here
Oh, I'm so glad that you mentioned about watching a movie with an open mind
Sir, I almost forgot about this
Thank you for nothing else
Bringing this back to my memory
I watched the movie, which has been so highly touted over the years
Sunday night, I had to get up real early yesterday morning to catch my plane and answer them
So Sunday night I go to bed at 9 o'clock
And I will attend 30, I wake up
And I'm, I'm not going to sleep
But I know what I'm saying and I'm all slept out
So I turn on TV and what movie is on on the BBC Raging Bull?
You've never seen it?
I watched, well, I never got through the opening scene with it
I ate my, uh, minutes of music, you know, and all I bullcrap with him, fattoboxing
How anybody could say that this is a great movie?
It is so far beyond me
Raging Bull is Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci playing to each other
That's all that movie is for two and a half hours
The biggest bunch of crap I have ever seen
And the ending just, it just ends, that's all
It's like, okay, we ran out of material now
And Martin Scorsese got tired
And, uh, he, you know, it's gonna make him a big name and that's the end of it
That's it
It's years since I've seen it, I mean, I liked it at the time
Well, why was there to like about it?
I mean, like I said, it's been years since I've seen it
I can't remember, you have to apply for it
Jake Lamatta wasn't even a, uh, a great boxer
Even assuming that you like boxing, which I don't
But he wasn't even a great boxer
Well, what's the big deal about making a story about Jake Lamatta's life?
And the fact that I remember, at the time there was a lot of hype
His ex-wife, Pope in a penthouse
You know, the 50-year-old, broad, with a great-looking body
So there was a lot of hype around the movie
And I think it was, there was a time way back
And I think that was from the 70s, you know, a lot of short movies were coming out
That's man, that is the biggest pseudo intellectual piece of crap
I remember the word you started in the all the time was Mr. Anti-Sports
Oh, but it's not a boxing movie
It sure is how there is 85% of it
It clips from all these fake fights
And then the worst acting by the way, and it was fake
And again, the kid that they used to play Sugar Ray Robinson looks about as much like Sugar Ray Robinson as I do
Well, you'll probably see it on TBS because this month it's all fight boxing
No, let me say that again, that's on the BBC
Yeah, oh, this is on BBC
But anyway, rent bowl worth, I'm pretty sure you'll like it
And I'd be curious to see what your take is on it
Okay, I'll do it
Bye now
Thanks
Gotta be better than that horrible raging bullhead
God, garbage
And you know something I see I never watched it far enough
It was like apocalypse now
It was one of those movies that I've tried to watch a million times
And I never get past the first few minutes
So I never even got past the opening scene where the music goes on and on
I never got past that
So I didn't even know that Joe Pesci was in it
And up until I saw this I used to like Joe Pesci
And now I realize that Joe Pesci is just one dimensional
He's like the Neuro, they always play the same character
Yeah, if your mother and I just fuck out, yeah
It's like the jury spingershow dragged out to two and a half hours
Yeah
And your mama too
Just pathetic
And they talk about this, see this is another one of these pseudo intellectual things
All the suits, oh that's one of the great masterpieces of all time
Yeah, right
The raging bullhead, piece of crap
Well you just didn't understand it, and that must be it
It must be too stupid to understand these great masterpieces
And of course the best part of the deal is that part of it was down here
When he finally retired from these fixed fights
And he started his club over there on column Zavino LaMotta's
And then he started doing a sit down comedy
In fact there's one part of the movie where he starts looking like Voka Brian
Well seriously, and then I knew that he was in big trouble
9 minutes past note at 560 WQM
Spider-Vase, spider-vase, old broad-gett, spider-vase
Who is that? It's really gross
That's why they use that kid and the old TVWer over there
Spider-Vase, I just find it a bit weird
Spider-Vase, you see, it's not a pretty side of you
It's more like a little peanut, a little crab-crab, a little crab
It is not 13 all day or giving birth to the frequent way
It makes that space and grow inside
From her ankle to her thigh
Spider-Vase, it's a spider-vase
Well 14 at 560 WQM, so Alan Funt dies
Alan Funt, what word did you say?
And nobody cares, Candid Cameraw, one of the great pioneers of TV
Good guy, Jewish, maybe a little bit too Jewish for American
560, what did he have to do with Best Myerson by the way?
I guess he used to be the one time the co-host of the, yeah, be for long before your time
I believe so, before he got into politics, stole all that money
I think back when she was wearing the mint coats
560, 560, raging bull, don't waste your time seeing it
Okay, don't rent it, don't watch it, don't waste your eyesight
Don't let anybody give you a song and a dance about what a brilliant movie it is
And by the way, Jake Lamatta dead, I'm assuming he probably, I would think he's dead
By now, do we know, do we care?
I mean, what an unbelievable waste and by the time the whole thing ends
Have you ever spent a lot of time and invested a lot of time watching a movie that's going on?
And what does it go on forever?
Like once upon a time in America, which at least wasn't entertaining movies, speaking of Robert De Niro
At least he was good in that
And the movie goes on for about seven and a half hours and finally it ends and what?
And what just, you know, what just happened?
You're wondering, what did I just miss there at the end?
And the same with Raging Bull
He's doing this stand-up comedy in New York now
After he spent some time in his slammer for beating up his wife
What a shock, huh?
But some athlete that beat up his wife, what a shock
In fact, the Jimmy Johnson wants to know is he's still alive and is he young enough to be able to play for the offense
Now that he finds out that he spent some time in a dead county stockade
And then he went back up to New York and did his sit-down comedy
And then it ends, that's it
And I'm thinking, what the after I miss?
Even Joe Pesci should be embarrassed by that
And I never even knew where Joe Pesci came from
So yeah, the first time I ever saw him was in good fellows
And come to find out this is the stale old routine that he's been doing since day one
He just does the same f-ing thing, the same up-and-thing over and over again
And he just says the same four or five words and that's it
He doesn't act, he just, that's just him
Here's a lady in North Miami Beach, hello
Hi, North Miami Beach
Yes, ma'am
You just made my day
You did two things nice
Yes
It's not free to for business, it's frown, she's my daughter
She's from North Miami Beach
The actress?
Yes, it was all my business
She got the part, my smile, she was in both movies, she got the part
And she says, mother, please tell me what everybody laughs when they tell them the name that I'm playing in the movie
Oh right
So she doesn't even know where you're at
So we told her, she does not look like that
She's adorable and she's very talented, she's waited 26 years for me
You know who she looks like when I have her dressed up with that spectra, she looks like Imaging Coco
I guess, I guess
Doesn't she?
From the Sinti there
That's it, and also
Jake Lamata is alive
Jake Lamata is still alive?
Yes, his ex-wife was one of my best friends who was the one that he beat up
Oh, he is
He is alive in New York and suing the airlines because one of his sons was killed in that with their craft last year
Are you kidding me?
No
Well how old must he be now?
Jake
80s?
Yeah, in his early 80s
And he's still alive
He's still alive
And he didn't even take care of his child, they were divorced and everything
But he's still in the air
Great
And she's a wonderful girl and the fellow said she wasn't in Penn House, she was the first, she was in what's the other one?
Hustler
No, the big boy
Yeah, playboy, she was 52 years old, she still is beautiful and nice as she can be
Oh right
The actress who played her in a movie was a knockout to blonde?
Yeah, she became, yeah, she was very good
But this lady is in her 60s and absolutely magnificent
How do you like that?
And I got a comment daughter in teller, he saw Schraff for this and that
Yeah, teller I enjoyed it
It's a real for this and this
And teller, what a putty
And it's Mindy Sterling
Teller, what a putty on that Mike Myers can
I know, he's not Julie, is that amazing?
Yes he is
No, his wife is
Oh I see
What is Canadian?
Yeah, but when he does so many expressions and he's very talent, he's very nice, believe it or not, he's very shy
I believe it
Yeah, he really is
Especially with teeth like those
Oh yeah
Oh, okay sweetheart
Thank you so much, you've made my life because you've done something with my mother who died last year at 100
She didn't do anything from 10 to 2 every day but listen to you
Right, well you made my day
She told me what you ate at your mother's untuced
Thank you for making my life very happy
Thanks
Bye-bye
How do you like that?
You see you go through 6000 calls and you get a good one
Oh!
Boy, she was just loaded with good stuff
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, frow farbisson and believe me when you see the Eiffelic you'll say oh it's the water Nazi
It's the same person
Yeah, it's her
Here's a pompano, hello
Neil
Yes sir
First of all, I've been listening to you since I think I call it your first in Palm Beach
How many years ago is that?
About 50, I feel like an old girl
Yeah, 600 years ago I was at JMO
Yeah, and then I've been following your own ranks
About a couple of weeks ago I sent you an article I got on the internet on the pen commandments
Did you get that?
It doesn't ring a bell
Oh God
It was so good
It was the new version of the Ten Commandments, you know, if you forget God and all that
You never got it
Well, I didn't know
Probably got intercepted by the God Squad
Probably, probably
Well, what I never think what happened I was up in Singapore Island a few weeks ago
Oh!
Before weeks ago
And I'm sitting by the pool these guys are talking religion and this and that
So that's crazy
Wait a minute, you're going to change your religion because I'm going to change point
So I died, I bought it in, you know, and I said let me tell you something
I said why is it that every time there's a earthquake there's this, there's that, there's that
Four people get buried, you know, I gave them a whole speech
So the guy said open your eyes man, open your eyes
God has taken them because
He took that three year old deal like a shop the other day
And they can't even
I said oh boy, I'm going to start praying that he don't love me and want to take them
Just consider the word for me
Just consider the source, have a great day
God bless us, okay
Yeah, see I'm giving up on that
If people want to be crazy, anybody who could believe in this Jewish Christian God has got to be certifiable
I'm not going to waste any more of my time because it's pointless
You have to be crazy to believe in this garbage
And let me give you one good example
And I hate to admit this on a year because George will say see I told you so
But in the Goroven albukh I was reading, he makes a very good point and that is circumcision is brutal
And there's no purpose to it, it serves no purpose
Because if indeed there would have been a God and he wanted the Jews to be a circumcised
They would have just been born with no law for skin
How do you like that?
Da da, they would have been born because this was the omnipotent God who could do whatever he wanted
But instead of that we had to make it, everything always involves a lot of pain and a little bit of blood
You know, always got to involve SNM, it's the SNM God
In addition to which, it's just like any other thing
If there was no reason to have forced skin in the first place, then you'd have been born without it
And after all these trips to Amsterdam and my European exports, I've discovered that
If you can't beat him, join him or just beat him
5670560, 0560 on the mobile one lie
If you can't join him, beat him
Here's the four-letter day, hello
Yeah, are you doing me?
Okay, sir?
All right, I have a two for you and a two for George
Yes?
Okay, I spent the week in Balexia, Mississippi
And it was, I went over to it with the, you know, thinking this is going to be terrible
I was going to hold onto you, but I enjoyed myself immensely
It was wonderful, that the windows are beautiful over there
The people are very, very, very nice
I just, if I have to recommend, I, I, this thing to you shows several times I've heard, I've heard some comments about the Lexington City
Don't go up there, this and that
But if, if I, there are people always tell me to go, but I know one of them always says I'm not going to go there
Because I have the same visions of it that you, you know what?
You have to stay away from Tunica, which is North Mississippi, which is about 35 miles outside of it
I never were one myself
Okay, and, but Balexia, that, the, you know, the southern portion of the Mississippi is beautiful
Okay, it's nice, you got a lot of old, old, nice restaurants over there
Steve Winnes got that bow-roof-as-over there, beautiful
Excellent shows over there, the great casinos, also another casino that's very, very nice
I'm an average player, I play 25, 50 dollars a hand and in Blackjack, my average bed on the craft table is probably about 80 bucks
And I was comp, you know, room, my meals, and I enjoyed myself, it was, okay
And for George, don't do it, I've been in that situation before, and it's just don't do it
What situation is that?
The last week he had a, he, he, he, his show was about experimenting
Yeah
And, um, just don't do it, it's, if you're not mentally prepared for it, don't do it
Don't do it
What, don't do what?
Swap the wife with another man
Swap your wife for another man?
Yeah, with another man
Oh, I see, with another man
With another man, you know, you take the other guy's wife and you gotta take sure wife, you know?
Yeah
But, um, no, don't do it, um, you know, your wife is your biggest secret and that secret should be kept to yourself
And, unless you're ready to part with that, it's, it's not a good thing to do
I'm not getting involved, okay, thank you, have a, I'll see you in the next one
Take care, Mr. Rye, thank you
I'm not saying a word, because I know too much
5, 6, 7, 05, 6, 8, 05, 60 on a mobile one line
Here's Miami, hello
Oh, yes, I just, uh, wanted to put my roden for George
I, I tuned in yesterday and I heard the best of Niel
And it's like, is if he was fired from the job or something
No, yesterday was a holiday, so he wasn't working
Oh, I didn't, okay
Well, I think he does a good job
Well, thank God
All right, thanks all he wanted to say
God bless you
You too
And, uh, your mama
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on a mobile one line
Now, this, never paying the attention to the audience because they're a bunch of mouth contents that people have called
And, no matter what they say, they're full of crap, you know
Ah, he was terrible, he was great, he was terrible, you're awful
You know, they don't know what they want because they're here
I can understand their frustration, they wake up in the morning, they look around and they're here and they say, oh, Jesus, any place but here
I can relate to it
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on a mobile one line
No calls about that movie, by the way, if this were any kind of a town
Somebody comes on the air and attacks one of the greatest movies allegedly in a history of, many people will tell you by the way
That's the greatest movie of all time, that's what the bird your friend used to tell me all the time, raging bull
Greatest movie ever made, better than Citizen Kane, better than Citizen Kane, better than Mr. Ed, you name it
Greatest movie in a history of mankind, raging bull, I'd like somebody to tell me why, what did I miss?
I saw it from beginning to end, and I'm still, by the way, in shock, the way that it ended
What happened there?
It just ran out of film, I guess
God, that was a great movie
Somebody's got to be a mental case to tell me that was a great movie, which means we probably get a lot of people calling this show to tell us that
Based on our audience
By the way, let me say it again, congratulations, brook
On a stellar one point, share persons 25 to 54, your median demographic there, your target demo baby
A one point, 50,000 one radio station with an ass kicking signal right in the middle of the dial
This woman has done what nobody thought she could do in such a short period of time
But I got confidence that she can bring it down below a one point
I really like that, wait till the next trend, wait till the whole summer book comes up, she'll be there in single digits with a decimal point in front of it
As in a all point, nine, or less
26 past noon at 560 WQM
Having trouble falling asleep?
Yeah, every night I try counting sheets, but they stick
Well now you can relax, we're the new limited time offer that stints in a different way
It's the best of outdoor
Outdoor, I want to be a sleep, not combatoes
Shut up and listen to this
And we have this today because I created the internet
Whoa, I feel and drassy already
That's right, after just a few minutes of listening to Democratic presidential hopeful outdoor
You'll forget what's bothering you and start thinking about who's bothering you
I love the environment because environmentally speaking without an environment the world would be a terrible environment in which to raise our children
I can't keep my eyes open
Yes, you'll drift off to the land of Wink and Blanket and Nod as you subject yourself to the most uncharismatic public figure in the history of American politics
I have made an illegal phone call or two in my office, but at least I didn't have the listed sex in there
It's true, nothing puts me in the mood to be unconscious, more than the vice president
Oh, I've been in office
My wife
Don't stop me through another sleep last night, get the best of outdoor today
And tonight you'll be sleeping like this
You ordered the best of outdoor, I'm Sadian, because that just got a wide hundred
1232 at 560 WQ, I have one question by the way, in addition to the eraging bull, bull hit
And that is about African people
Now I was on a plane from Amsterdam to London because I did this virgin shaglantic, which I'll ever do again by the way
Although I did appreciate being a bump up top or class coming back, not going over but coming back
But so I was on KLM from Amsterdam to London and it was a jam packed flight, yesterday morning
And there were a couple of Africaners who came on there wearing those schmatte that they were
The Hussage Shaka
No, not a Hussage Shaka, I don't know what they call Shiki, but whatever they call it, Shiki
A schmatte
And my question is, do they all smell like that?
That was question number one, and question number two is, since these were people that were brought on right at the very end of a full
You know what I'm saying, when they bring people on who are like standbys, why did she sit him right across the aisle from me?
That's my question
I mean, did I do something evil in my life that is erred that evidently the answer is yes
You know, there's this amazing thing it's called soap, I know it comes in a great shock
Maybe that's why they call it a Hussage Shaka
5667 0560, 0560 on a mobile one line
And what is that?
Ja, Jaik Le Mata is one, granddaughter, hello
Hello
Yes, ma'am
Hi, is this Neil?
Yes it is
I am actually starting to listen to you about two months ago
Right
And my friend of mine just called and said they're talking about you
They are not about me, about the movie on the radio here
And they're talking about Vicki and everything else
And I just want to, quick up to you, what we guys say, and I just called they sit here, call right away, and I said, well I don't even know what they're talking about
No, I just happened to see the movie two nights ago in Amsterdam as I went on vacation
And I couldn't fall asleep and I turned on the BBC and they had raging bull on
I've never watched before and I'm afraid
You thought it's a shock?
I thought it was horrendous
Really?
Yeah
Well let's see, I mean, what was it that made an interesting movie? I'm just missing something
Well, okay, this is a little nervous here
Well, a couple of things
Well first, I didn't see this movie came out, I was about 12
Right
So I really didn't understand everything I thought, let's see, I thought Robert De Niro was my grandfather
I was a little confused at the time
And
Which would have made Joe Pesci my uncle
And but I was like, I don't know
We have to understand my natural father is Joe Lamata, which recently passed away with Air Crash
And my mom was divorced when I was about two and remarried
Right
So I always knew there was, you know, somebody out there that mommy dated but I always had my dad, my dad's my dad
But as I got older and the movies came out and the playboy issues came out and all those things
I began to realize, you know, what was all about?
When I saw the movie, for me it was something different because it was like, I didn't know them
I didn't know the stories, I didn't grow up, you know, with a boxing or anything like that
So I, my, for me, it was like, you know, a family experience
It was a very ugly story, I mean, there was nothing about it that was pleasant, the whole thing was ugly and the...
Well, listen, first of all, I'll take you on word for word for anything about the Godfather
Because that's my favorite movie
Right
Second thing, what's ugly about it, actually, it's a, from what I understand, it's, you know, pretty truthful
You know, it's before my time, it was before I was born, I've spoken about 26
Oh, so basically what?
Twenty-six years later I had a meeting with Joe, he flew down from Miami because my mom went into Vicki
Down here, she lived in this area
She looks the same, exactly the same, just as pretty as she was way back when
And then my natural father flew down after 26 years, let me tell you that's not easy meeting
And there's reasons, anybody out there listening, there's reasons, people don't teach other for 26 years
Yeah
Alright, and then of course things, you know, we had our problems and our differences and then a couple years later than there was the crash
So I don't know why I didn't like the movie, but for me...
Is your name Naomi?
No, my name is not Naomi
Oh
And I...
I wanted to know why I have no idea what was called, somebody thought he knew it
Okay
No, and the thing is, for me, I like the movie because it's like, well, there's grandpa and there's grandma
You know, there you go
You, I don't know why you didn't like the movie, it's got great actors, it's done by Martin, twist the case, you robbed it with a mere joke
I don't see...
I don't see, I'm not one of those people that goes and enjoys or doesn't enjoy a movie based on who the director was
Right, I don't know
Who the actors were or the actresses
I enjoy it based on...
You know what?
Whatever it is
And I thought it was just a gross, ugly, sorted story that wasn't even...
I don't know, there was no point in doing it
So, like, the Mike Tyson story is a better story of...
No
It's real life
And you can accept real life for what it is
Yeah
You can appreciate it, you know, so what if he brought a roses every day?
Would that make a better story?
No
That's what happened, if that's what happened, that's what happened
I mean, I wasn't around, if that's the story, that's what happened
And I mean, I think it was done pretty well, it was done pretty realistic
And yeah, yeah, from my understanding he hit her
Yeah, he hit her and he was neurotic and just...
And unfortunately, you know what?
I got the same genes
Yeah
Yeah, it's the lead, each and every so have a lot of things to do with it
But if you don't like the movie, you don't like to turn it off next time
But I just think my friends, all I know I was in my apartment hanging out...
Again, I hate it, I'm glad you called, but I hated the movie
And nothing you say is going to make me like it, I hate it
You know what? That's okay with me
Thing is, I'm interested because they're talking about the special air crash
I was coming back from Costa Rica that day
My plane was taken off, I guess the dead air plane was not
And so I get off the airplane and the first thing you know I hear is
Did you hear what happened? I was in Costa Rica, no, what happened?
So that was a little shocking for me because I never got to say my goodbyes
Or I'm sorry, or have any type of closure or anything like that
Well don't say closure, please don't say closure
Why?
I just don't like the word, it's just that
Please don't close the closure, please
Okay
But I was...
That was close, I know the friend came running in here and said
They're talking about Switzerland, they're talking about Texas, they're staying there
They're staying there and they dialed the number for me
And I'm like, Hi, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey You know?
You know, and I know
Any questions or any...
I don't know what's a video
Have a great life
T Healthy Later
Thanks
You know, not seriously, there's only one thing
That I can... one sound... that I can utter
At this point, that would echo my sentiments
Do, do, do, do, do, do
That's all I can say.
And I still hated the movie.
Just like Jack Lemons said in that movie, Mass Appeal, I hated Yugoslavia.
I hated the raging bull shot.

21 before 1 at 5.60 WQA.
I'm some amazing stuff going on here today in between the raindrops here.
I thought can't treat the packer in his pants.
Hi, this is Joe Pesci.
And I would like to be serious with you for a moment.
The talk to you is about a little known yet devastating disease.
It's called Tourette's Syndrome.
Many people suffering from this affliction aren't even f***ing aware of it.
It can happen at almost any f***ing time.
This is one big f***ing problem over here and I'm trying to make you f***ing assholes
aware of it.
What the f***ing laughing at over there?
Look at that guy over there, he's laughing.
You think this is f***ing funny?
Well, you think I'm being f***ing funny over here?
What the f***ing so f***ing funny over here?
Did I say something to a news news?
Look at this f***ing guy laughing over here.
Alright.
Alright.
Come on, Joe.
Come on with that guy.
What did you do that for?
You're going to have to do that.
You're going to have to do that.
You're going to have to do that.
I'm a f***ing f***ing guy.
I'm a f***ing f***ing guy.
You're going to have to bury somebody.
1244-560 WQM.
You know my Joe Pesci thing, Joe Pesci days are over.
Sorry.
Bye, Joe.
Well, I can't be seeing you or that we'll be I can't see you.
How have you want to put it?
He just is one, no, no, Charlie.
He just does the same thing over and over again.
That's all he'd be doing.
It was a horrible movie, sweetheart.
It was horrendous.
It was pathetic.
There was no reason to do the story of Jake Lamatta.
I mean, there ain't been any other marginal scumbags out there
and they could have done the life story of them.
It would have still been a piece of crap.
I don't get it.
Here's Pompidol B.
Hello?
Hey, Uncle Nail.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to touch all the bases real quick, especially rage involved.
Yeah.
First of all regarding George, he does a great job.
He's different from you, just like Mandage and Boat Camp.
We're different from Hank.
It's horrible.
You know, as simple as that.
I like listening to Hank for some things.
I like Mandage for some things.
And George does a good job.
So whoever doesn't like George, turn the dial.
Regarding the girl and the woman who was on the phone,
they were telling the truth.
That girl, I'm not going to say her first name,
but she used to work at a restaurant called Bermuda Triangle.
That was down on the beach.
She's an absolute knockout as was her grandmother and everything
and everything she was saying.
I mean, I'm not a fight fan at all, but I thought
that the rage involved was a fairly accurate account.
If it was not a good movie in your opinion,
just like people don't like George or Hank,
you know, if you don't like rage involved, that's understandable.
Yeah, but it's not a question of whether it's understandable,
but the fact is that the pseudo intellectuals,
the so-called movie critics have built this up over the years,
is one of the great masterpiece.
It's one of the brilliant, because Martin Scorsese directed it.
I just don't understand it.
I mean, somebody would have to explain to me what is it that I missed.
Yeah, but the thing about Pesci is,
the reason I have one big reason I wanted to call was that they had this four-part series
on arts and entertainment last week, The Rapp Pack.
And up there, do it the HBO thing.
I think that they put it on and you know,
it can jump you with it whatever.
The thing about Pesci, Pesci is not a bad actor,
but every one of his characters is, you know,
just runs at the mouth like crazy.
Yeah, I guess you just walked away.
You're the same thing every single movie.
No, I was watching Casino a few weeks ago.
And then they had on the entertainment network,
they had this thing about Las Vegas, where they showed the guy Lefty,
who D'Niro played in the movie Casino,
and you know, how it all paralleled together.
This guy Lefty, that D'Niro played,
he owns a place up in Boka called Crocs.
He owns a restaurant up there, and he's still saying,
oh, I didn't do this, I didn't do that.
Now that Sinatra is gone, and Dean Martin,
a lot of the old-time Vegas people are gone.
So I'll come on out now.
I mean, obviously you've known, because I know you read all the Kennedy books,
and you're a big reader and everything.
All the stuff about Sinatra helping Kennedy,
and then when Kennedy gets elected,
Robert Kennedy still goes after the mob,
and Sam, what was it in Gianca?
Giancana, yeah.
And Conna, I had to be Giancana when after Kennedy.
He had to be able to do something to do with Oswald and all that.
You know, this stuff never ever came out,
as long as Sinatra was alive.
And now that he's gone, all the stuff is coming out.
The movie...
What stuff is coming out?
I'm not all coming up,
but now instead of being whispered in the books for years,
now it's sensationalizing it all over television.
No, they're not.
In fact, that's the thing that's shocking to me,
is now that Sinatra is dead.
You see, even when somebody's dead, there's value.
You know, the record company's a god-value,
and selling more of his records.
So even after somebody dies, no matter how much of a scumbag,
and he was, there still are people who have a vested interest
of protecting the image.
Yeah, that's right.
No, you're right about that.
If there should be an expose on Sinatra,
it's not for there to be just brutally honest,
and in fact, this whole vaguest thing,
all of these, not all of them,
but so many of these entertainers who were big in Vegas,
especially that other people couldn't sing a word of a paper sack,
they were big because they were owned by the mob.
Right, and Sinatra was a part of it.
You know, that's absolutely...
No, I was just saying,
I mean, the whole thing about Sammy Davis
and Lawford, how he shut him out, things like that.
Getting back to Lamata,
I guess I was not a fight-stander,
or whatever, I did, right during every years ago,
seeing the grandmother in Playboy Magazine,
she was beautiful and all that.
The Neural...
The Neural I always thought was a great actor, Pesci.
Like I said, he just fills in with the boy.
But I'm missing something there, I'm not raging ball.
No, no, no, no, no, sir, can I say something?
I'm sorry.
Everybody's making a big song in a dance about how beautiful
his ex-wife was and the granda.
There are a lot of beautiful people around in the world,
but nobody made a movie about that,
and it doesn't make them important.
In other words, we all appreciate human beauty,
but I don't understand what that has to do with why he was so important
that they needed to make a movie about him.
If you weren't a fight fan,
since 85% of the movie was clips
where these staged horribly fake stage clips
from these boxing matches,
with the blood spurting and the guts spurting,
and Don Dumpy sitting there, breathless at the ring.
I mean, I even know I'm not a boxing fan.
It certainly is a young person.
I watched enough boxing.
I've seen a million boxing, a million fights.
There was nothing, and he even, even minutely,
realistic about that.
Let me make a, let me make a,
let me make a,
and then the one fight where he stood,
his last fight, I guess,
where Sugar Ray Leonard beat the crap out of him,
and he just stands there,
and it's like this thing is frozen to spend it in space,
and the pseudo-intellectuals must add a field they would have seen,
because it's like all suspended in time.
It like takes 45 seconds for the scene.
He just stands there with his arms open,
and Sugar Ray Leonard just,
he's thinking about it,
and then he finally comes up and just beats the smart out of him,
and there's blood and sweat,
all over the goddamn thing.
What happened?
What was the point?
I mean, what was the point?
I'm gonna try.
I'm gonna make a, a valiant attempt to try and explain it from what I understand.
When Lamada fought Robinson in that fight,
if the fight had gone on like another 20 seconds,
Robinson practically could have been killed.
Lamada just went to bananas on him at the end,
and the ropes held up Robinson,
and that's what kept Lamada from being the champion.
That's from what I have read,
from what I've seen on ABC's,
where I want to score stuff like that.
Lamada in his era, allegedly.
I mean, he threw fights because that's the mob control,
the fights back then.
He was what the people referred to,
and you know, you're from that era, not me.
I was born in 1960,
but to a lot of people from the 30s, 40s, 50s,
he was the unclown champion,
and that's why he was such a lovable guy as bad as he was.
Was a lovable guy?
No, no, no, no, he was lovable.
He was like, I'm a man.
I didn't like, no, I used to be a lovable guy.
I used to be a lovable,
and he was a neurotic scumbag.
He was the wrong boy.
He was paranoid.
I mean, all in...
He beat the whole murder.
The only thing he was concerned about
was his wife's crew and his brother,
and that one, did she kiss some old man on the lips?
Oh, there was one.
He was a paranoid scumbag,
is what the movie said.
There was one story that came out to be true
that before he was fighting this one guy,
his wife saw a picture of the guy,
and just said to him,
she goes, oh, he's kind of killed.
Now, I'm out of the movie.
And he walked into the ring,
and he said, my wife likes you,
and just preceded the character,
and he said, I did not mean to use the word lovable,
but the fans loved him.
They knew what he was all about,
beating the wife and all that,
but the fans just got behind him,
and that's why he became one of these mystical figures
out of the war.
I mean, again, first of all,
I'm not as old as you think I am, okay?
I would have...
56, okay?
So the fact that most of his career was in the 40s,
the timing of it has got nothing.
I'm not a contemporary, he is.
But based on my growing up as a kid,
and the early days of television,
he was never in a same category
with Joe Lewis or Sugar Ray Leonard
or Max Smelling or any of the great boxers.
He wasn't in that category.
No, okay.
So when you're trying to make him up to be,
you're trying to fit him to make the mold of the movie,
and he wasn't.
Okay, I mean, Neil, it wasn't my errand.
I'm not about...
I understand what you're saying.
I think you understand what I'm saying.
No, I don't. I don't understand what you're saying.
All right, listen, I noticed other people on the line.
I heard a lot of people say, I'm going to do a spagged.
Thank you, bye-bye.
Anybody know what he just said?
No.
No, no. Here's Miami. Hello.
And now you like to move any better, Neil?
No.
You understand anything better?
No.
Hey, man, we'll make a business deal
with you since you're an important family person, though.
Hey, man, when you die, man,
I'd like to give the concession
to sell tickets at your funeral.
Yeah.
Over the funeral, and Joe, I'll be stadiums.
Uh-huh. Let me sell the tickets there.
Yeah.
How does that sound?
You got a long way, pal.
We had Joe Kusche collecting that.
Yeah, he had a long way.
How about when you died?
Oh, I don't know. You can leave it to him right now.
No, okay. Okay. It's a deal.
Ha-ha.
He must know, uh, what's your name?
Angela Ray.
Ha-ha-ha.
5670560, £560 on a mobile one line.
Here's Marguerite. Hello.
Yes, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I'm here to tell you what the picture meant.
You really didn't miss the point.
Okay.
Now, you don't have to really even care about Jake Lamada
to understand the connection of it was about a very flawed person
who nevertheless was a survivor.
And we've known all known people that have beaten their wives
or whatever like that.
He was a survivor. He was a survivor.
He was a bomb at the end. He was a tutor.
But you see, the thing is, in other words,
is that some of the greatest pictures that you've ever seen
are about flawed people that nevertheless just move on.
In other words, that makes some interest in the fact that death's life.
No, his wife is very harsh, very tough.
In the fact that at the end, he was just- he was moving on,
no matter how much it was going to happen.
He was moving on to what?
He was moving on to what?
He was moving on to another part of his life.
That's the end of the life.
Which was what?
Which was what?
Which was he was on the stage?
He was on the stage.
He was a flunky.
He was performing in Nickel and Dymna clubs.
You have a life of survival.
That's the life of life is.
And there's another thing.
In other words, sir, this wasn't about somebody who was a survivor.
This is about somebody who became a failure,
who had riches and lost it all,
who had a wife and a family and lost it all,
and became a bum.
You know what I'm going to do about surviving?
I don't know. You know people like that?
So what about it?
I know a lot of people, but I wouldn't make a movie about it.
It makes an interesting story because it's a book called The Heart.
It was not an interesting story.
It was an depressing story.
But the depressing story is that that's what life is depressing.
But-
No, this call is depressing, okay?
Oh, I feel so much better now.
Oh, what a breath of fresh air that that call is over.
So you can rationalize anything.
I'm delighted because I did ask the question.
But I'm glad that I'm stupid and this guy's smart.
You know, like Frado, he's smart and I'm dumb.
Wanna go fishing by the way, pal?
You sure ain't saying off-hael marries?
Because you never know who's sitting behind you in that boat.
Oh.
I mean, you talk about desperation to try to make something out of nothing.
And again, because-
Because these so-called experts have told you that this is a great motion picture
and that Jake Lamatta was a very important American figure.
And in some way, shape or form, sports figure, some kind of an icon, some kind of something.
Is anybody believe that?
No.
No.
If I had to think back, political sports, all the various public figures in the course of my lifetime,
would Jake Lamatta ever come to my mind if I wouldn't have seen that movie?
No.
No.
He was a piece of crap.
And there was nothing complicated about it.
He was just a paranoid, manic, psychotic piece of crap, who was uptight and just out of control.
He was like borderline should have been put away somewhere.
Dangerous.
To the extent that even his brother, even Joe Pesci there, and then that scene toward the end of the movie,
where he runs and he sees his brother out there on the streets in New York, wherever the hell it was.
And he goes up to him and Pesci keeps walking away from Joey, I guess his name in the movie.
And he finally corners him by his car.
Joe Pesci's trying to get into his car to drive away to go home.
And he corners him, come on, speak to me, talk to me, I'm your brother.
And this of course is after he had come running into the house and beaten the crap out of Joe Pesci out of his wife.
And then beat the crap out of Joe Pesci in front of his wife and kids,
because he was so paranoid about thinking that his brother, Joe Pesci, screwed his wife.
And so all these years went by, the Joe Pesci wouldn't speak to him, and he finally corners him in front of the car.
Do you remember that scene?
Come on, kiss me, kiss me.
I thought that he was going to do him right there, I mean it was just ridiculous.
If that was somebody's idea of a good acting job, then you know, and that's Robert the Neuro for you again.
Here's a guy who is another like the Rascal House.
He's the Rascal House of Acting, the Forge of Acting, state of mind.
Oh, it's the Neuro, he's brilliant.
God.
1256, you know something, if Robert the Neuro had never been in Godfather 2,
it wouldn't have detracted from the any of the three of the trilogy in any way, shape or form.
He contributed nothing to the Godfather, nothing zero.
Mama Corleone, what the hell was her name, the singer of Morgana King?
She contributed more, even just by making a good sauce.

I can just walk outside and look around and realize that I'm here and I'll be depressed immediately.
So the idea that because life is depressing and then this guy he sounded like Mr. Depression. He sounded like you know the movie could have been about him as
in the loser
Here's Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, can I change this up a little bit? I just want to get your opinion on something kind of serious and see where you stand on it.
President Clinton's offer of clemency to those Puerto Rican terrorists and now Hillary. I don't have any opinion on it. No opinion? No.
Did you know what I'm talking about? I know what you're talking about and Hillary of course is a once-or-one from center from New York and that's big with the Puerto Rican to New York City.
And so she's saying one thing and they're saying the opposite. I have no opinion.
But you know what she recently did over the weekend though. Now she's making she wants the prisoners to you know have a deadline by this Friday.
Right. Which is so far the three weeks that they've made the offer they haven't seen you asked me. I don't I don't care.
I first of all I don't care about Hillary. I couldn't care less about Hillary. She didn't know interest in me. I don't know.
I just thought I was kind of stupid to let terrorists possibly go three for just three for just you know denouncing violence.
Okay. We'll denounce violence and then we'll be free. Yeah. I say that's kind of stupid. I say give me a knuckle sandwich would be good.
Okay. As in that kind. Okay. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 6. I mean you're going to get this to ask me. It's like this middle east piece agreement.
How many middle east piece agreements have we had?
And how many times have I told you there is not going to be no peace in the middle east. Okay. They just get through signing it.
They have another big ceremony there. Here's Madeline. All right. Here's yes or error fart. Here's all these baroque barouh.
All right. Whatever their name is. Another blow on up buses again and they're all blowing up whatever the whole bus. Same old crap.
It's never going to stop. Never going to stop because it's a crazy world.
With crazy religious people because as soon as you come up with a word religion. You're talking superstition.
You're talking crazy people. People who have no respect for the planet. No respect for life.
People who have no brain crazy people the only people who could believe in this sick SNM God.
And like I said I'm not I'm not going to waste my time with it anymore. I'm it's it's it's been way not that I'm so much holier than now so to speak.
But it's it's just a waste of my time. I'd rather say you're going like that and feel I'm doing something more productive.
And waste that my time arguing with people who don't have enough common sense to realize what a bunch of horse crap.
How ridiculous these bubble mice these are. Here's Boka. Hello. Boka. Yeah. Hi. How you doing? Okay, sir.
Just a couple of comments on Joey and that. The movie was terrible. In fact, he always was about my uncle Frank used to live two bucks away from him.
And when they're abroad things to beat him up regularly. So he just had people back. But as far as Joey.
Joey's basically a comic. You know, they used to have that aristocrat group him and Frankie Vincent. Right. I've seen that you know the elder Adam supper.
A long Alan. Yeah, but you know, he's done a lot of different things besides all these hoodlums movies.
He did easy money. He did home alone. Those lethal weapons. He can do other things. He's home alone.
Home the homelones with a little kid McCormick. I'm not into a little kids.
Yeah, well, I don't know Jackson.
We've all weapons. He was like all over the board. Yeah. In fact, the one that maybe I just had bad luck.
And that every time I see him in any movie, he's always doing the same care. That is him though. I mean, I'm from the club.
I used to I kind of followed this guy because I liked him. I found him very very funny. Yeah, they were, you know, Vincent and Pesci.
You know, Frankie Vincent was with him most of them. They were a stand up comedy act.
And that's where the nearer remembered him from. Joey was managing. I read this was managing at a 10-A restaurant in the Bronx.
One of the nearer called for that part in that raging boat, which I didn't like.
And by the way, left the his uncle is enough. You want that crox out there in book or that's gone to.
Okay. So there's just a few facts. Okay. Thanks. Right.
See, yeah, Joe Pesci just walked in.
Not really. I'm not sure if he's Joe Pesci or Robert De Niro as Jake Lamata.
Boca Brian. I mean, there was no surface. There was one point in the movie because they kept changing his nose
and making it wider and wider as he got older, you know.
And at one point, he was like sitting back in the chair and I thought, gee, if he had a little bit less
here, it's Boca Brian. 5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's North Miami Beach. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes, Neil. Oh, no chance. I'll just get a little bit.
Neil, I have a few hockey cards. I would like to make sure you have anything. Oh, great.
Here's a mobile in Gainesville. Hello. Hey, Neil. I just wanted to say that movie was not very good.
I was tired of you talking about how you could never get into a apocalypse now. Right.
That first thing we're Martin Schiening, you mean, with all the music and he's in the room,
you could never get past that. Right. That's as far as I get. I don't blame you. I've seen that movie
before. I get a warning desire to shut it off that I do every time. That movie's just not. It gets,
it's a little too unusual and that's one of those other movies that everybody says, oh,
it's so good. Oh, it's so good. Yeah. And it says that's okay. And I never really thought
French is for a couple who was very good. Even though the Godfather is very good, I think,
I think if we had had somebody else in there, it could have been just as good. Right.
And then he had to try to the third one. He tried to make it his own. And he has his daughter in
there and he brings in people who have no right being in that kind of. Sure, he's handled in, yeah.
Right. And he like, Wallick and people. Come on, Eli. Another canola. Eli, quick.
He is fast. Please. We can't stand it anymore. But I agree. I think the Nero and a lot of his movies,
the Nero and Pissue play the same character. You look at good fellows. I mean, those movies with the
Nero was playing the the Waco and it capes fear and then he played in that movie. It was the
snipes. He's playing the same Waco and the same off the guy in every movie. Right. And he didn't
really add anything to Godfather to nothing. That's the only zero. Well, I think about the Godfather
and the L.P. Kino James Con Robert Duval. Absolutely. I'm not going to be thinking about that.
Well, men's a Tessio. That's right. By Zini Tattaya. All right. Now you're talking.

Once you know more. I always wanted to know. There was one thing I was wanting to know.
Why would a cradle get into a boat along without nearly? Because he was smart. Not dumb. Like
everybody said, he was smart. Yeah, you see if I could I would never get into a boat alone with
our nearly. If he would have just said two more Hail Mary's, that might have done it. Have a great day,
pal. You too, no. See you. Five six seven oh five sixty. Pond five sixty on the AT&T wireless line.

Georgie Bush says that his nose is clean and never but the fitted.
Cuddy's running for the wide house. So he just can't admit us.
Don't drunken that's not all even down the beautiful.
Carlo can he drunk with you? He even dropped the message to.
Why won't George just come out and simply say he did it? He preferred the press which shut their mouth.
But it's not he got their business. He did more than what you think.
But he watched it down the city. And he preferred cocaine to have.
That's the question that he does. Can he make his point much clearer?
Like a razor on a mirror. But he wants us to believe. That he didn't do anything.
Georgie Bush says that his nose is clean and never but the fitted.
Cuddy's running for the wide house. So he just can't admit us.
Georgie's cream. Georgie's cream. Georgie's cream.
All right. One 14 at five sixty WQM. Tell me another movie that I saw a little bit of while I was
on the vacation. You know, come in late at night and you turn on your TV and not really
ready to go to sleep yet. And the flip it around and find something that's in English.
And the movie. And I don't want to say who on the station is always raving about what a great movie.
Hey, stupid. Then always quoting from this movie.
Hey, stupid.
Stalk 17. Well, I never maybe I saw it years and years and years ago.
With William Holden. Why love William Holden? One of the great actors of all time.
Little drunk but the ain't feel no pain anymore.
I watched about 25 minutes of that and I flipped it off and went straight to sleep.
Worked like a charm. Put me right into a coma.
Awful.
Talk about depressing. Of course, I guess most war movies are depressing.
Not good.
Not good.
Fine. How can you say that? I just said it.
Not good. 5 6 7 0 5 60.

Pound 5 60 on the AT&T line.
Here's Tamarack. Hello.
Hello. Neil. Yes.
Good to have you back.
Uh-huh. Listen, I have to agree with you on Raging Bull.
One of the worst movies.
Plus, it was painful to watch this.
There was so much Carson.
There was more Carson in that movie.
Probably any movie ever made.
And it was just gratuitous.
I mean, there wasn't any point to it.
It was just Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro being uh,
Bums the whole for two and a half hours.
Usually I agree with you on everything,
but I have to disagree with you.
We'd rob with the Niro.
To me, the man is the greatest actor of all time.
Oh, and listen, the greatest actor of all time.
He's not only make gangster pictures.
Did you see the King of Comedy?
Yeah. King of Comedy.
That to me is the greatest movie that was ever made
where he played Rupert Pumpkin.
Yeah.
The scenes with his, when he was down in the base
with the cardboard with Liza Manelli
and his mother called him and the scenes with Sandra Bernhardt.
He's the greatest actor of all time based on one movie.
Not based on that.
He's a great comedy actor.
Do you see analyzed this?
I wouldn't watch it.
It's just another gratuitous role where he plays.
Give it a chance on telling it.
This movie.
I wouldn't watch it.
I don't want to see Robert De Niro playing another Mophyosi again.
He plays a comedic Mophyosi.
But the whole idea of that,
it's like saying, you know, it's like playing a comedic hitman.
You know, it doesn't make any sense.
It's a terrific movie.
You're so short.
Listen.
I know.
I've got issue questions.
How come Hoppano Race Track doesn't take the medallions
flat tonight when Calder is closed?
Do you know?
Nobody seems to know the end.
I haven't got any.
Listen, if I could tell you why they do anything there,
it would be a miracle.
I have no idea.
Okay, great to have you back.
Please play to Britney Spears on.
I know you say you look at my eyes,
but I know you're checking out my thighs.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, Britney's big over in Europe.
I'll tell you that boy.
Oh, her and Enrique, although he's a lot prettier and she is.
Nice going Enrique.
We doing that video.
Nobody wants to see Guy Dame Will Smith.
They want to see a lot of hot flesh in that the Remade video
and that Baila Mosis humongous over there.
Every 14 seconds they're playing it.
Just keep rubbing that belly Enrique.
You'll find something there.

We're critiquing film today,
like Lee J. Cobb used to say in the exorcist,
used to like to sit around and in between exorcisms,
you like to sit around and critique film.
Here's the lady in Carole City.
Hello.
Yeah, Nell.
Welcome back.
Thank you.
Well, I saw a rage in,
and the only thing that when they were advertising the promo in the movie,
it was, this is the greatest black and white.
All they talked about that was that black and white
because most of the movies during the time it was,
Sean Lee, you know, colored, not colored,
but they were films in color.
And I saw the movie.
Of course, at least we knew what color Sugar Ray Robinson was.
Right.
And it was a black and white and it was slow.
And he was like a maniac.
And I don't know whether they was trying to promote him,
or try to get people,
because the people were staying away from boxing.
And then everybody came out and it was the greatest
boxing film that ever was.
And I saw the movie.
I saw it over there.
And you can only imagine if it would have been in color
with all the blood and the dust that you had this bleeding out of the ring.
I mean, 85.
Let me say it again.
80 to 85% of the movie was these clips,
these stage clips from all these different fights that he had.
And with nothing but blood and guts and sweat spewing over the ring
and people getting splattered in the front row.
And then it's all it was.
That's all it was.
And I saw it.
I remember the date I saw it in was a hundred and sixty-third street.
I don't know whether it closed because of the movie.
I have to the movie.
I think that would do it.
That was it.
That I saw the movie.
And I agree with you.
100% it was the worst movie ever.
And I can understand the question.
And now I can understand a grand door or more.
You know.
I can understand.
The problem is in her genes.
Right.
I can answer the guys in the audience are hoping to find it.
OK.
Have a great day.
We're done.
Bye bye.
OK, 5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
More hype jobs.
All these fantastic hype jobs that Hollywood does,
that the politicians do, that the media does.
And people say, oh yeah, that's great.
Like this, my friend before it gives me, I mean, you know,
it's subjective.
If you think Robert the Neuros the greatest actor of all time,
I mean, OK, who might argue with you?
If I never saw him again, it would be too soon.
The only movie I really enjoyed him in was Once Upon a Time in America.
But when you got an actor and actress who always plays the same role
over and over and over again, even the word typecast isn't sufficient
to describe how ponderous it gets.
Like Joe Pesci would say, oking ponderous.
Here is the four-letter deal.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, you're right about that.
But the problem is, is you're blaming the actors for them being typecasts.
All right, it's the casting directors that say,
OK, why don't you play this part for the 8th Billion Star?
I agree with that.
OK, I wouldn't.
But it's like this guy tells me I should go see analyze this.
No.
They have the Neuro come back again.
And they make up another mob role for him.
That's right.
They get into a comedy.
Yeah, but you can't say that that's his fault.
I mean, he wants to make a buck and he's going to go do it.
I mean, there's no doubt about that.
Don't you think somebody of his stature can make a buck
by finding a better part than that?
I may be not.
Maybe because he's been typecast so much
that's the only thing they want to cast him in.
That's all the hard to hard to do.
You really think so?
I mean, what about Joe Pesci?
Oh, Joe Pesci at this point, he's what you see is what you get.
I don't think he can do anything else.
Well, I don't think that I don't personally think that's true.
I think that that's all he's ever been.
That's all that's ever been put on his plate.
And you're saying the other thing that I disagree with is
you're saying because the subject matter of life
or Jake Lamatta is disgusting and he's a prey,
and he's an asshole or whatever you got.
I mean, that's true.
I mean, that's what the guy is all about.
But why was it interesting?
What was there interesting about him?
I don't think it's necessary.
I mean, what makes anything interesting?
Neil Good or bad?
I mean, it's just an opinion.
If you like it or not, I thought it was an interesting question.
But don't you think that if you're going to do a movie
that's based on a life story of somebody,
whoever the person is, fill in the blank of Mr. Schwartz,
Mr. Jones, that there's got to be something interesting enough
to make a story about them.
I didn't think he was interesting.
I would have been something if he went from
going to lose it all his money and lose it all his champion
and then becoming a bum and then making some kind of a comeback
or something interesting, something, but they weren't happening.
But all he did was it just showed that he was another part
of this corrupt world of boxing where the fights were rigged
where the mob controlled everything that was going on.
He became a, he was a scumbag of a human being
who was just hysterically jealous and psychotic
and paranoid about his wife and a brutal and sadistic
well, I don't understand it.
But Neil, don't you think that's great
that they showed it in such a true light?
I mean, you have to agree that usually they're going to pull a punch
with you and say, oh, there was something intrinsically great
about this guy or what they showed him as the discovery.
So why didn't they just come on in the beginning and say,
Jake Lamatta was a scumbag.
Well, here's a good movie.
They could do that with anything, you know?
Here's a good movie that isn't about Jake Lamatta.
That would have been much more interesting.
I mean, you didn't think the movie was good.
You just don't like the subject matter.
No, no, I don't like the Nero, right?
No, no, it had nothing to do with whether I like the Nero or not.
It was the Nero, it was the definitive Deneuro and Joe Pesci.
It was like, yeah, we're doing the movie to each other.
Well, you know, I have to agree with you on that,
but that's what those people were.
I mean, those people were that.
The cursing and the low lives and no clasps.
Let me ask you like Marlon Brando.
Okay.
They get all the different roles that Marlon Brando has played.
But Marlon Brando was offered a lot of great roles.
I'm saying that these people may not have that opportunity.
In this day and age where everybody's cut in the bottom line
and they can't even get through.
Maybe Joe Pesci, but I don't know.
I can't agree with you on that.
You know, they can't even get people to go into a theater
to see a movie with one great actor
and it has to have 5,000 actors in it.
And then maybe somebody will show an interest
or like you said, it's a hype job like Titanic.
Everybody, oh God, you got to see, I mean, you know,
where it's nothing.
Yeah, I'll stick with Thrall Farbissin to myself.
That's a great thing.
All right, Neil.
All right.
5,6,7,0,5,60,
05,60,1,8,0,
and speaking of bad teeth,
so I'm flying over on Virgin Shagolandic.
And there's a guy sitting next to me
who smelled a British guy, smelled so bad,
and had the typical British teeth.
Only this guy was a real pseudo-intellectual.
A guy would say in his 60s, around 60s.
Now, the only good part about this is that this man never shut up
for a minute until finally he drank so much wine
on the plane that he knotted off the last hour of the flight.
So that part of it made the flight a lot shorter.
Bap,ap,ap,ap,ap,ap,ap,ap,ap,
but talk about a pseudo-intellectual.
And this man, oh, he had a meeting with the half,
what the hell's the name?
From Assyria, Hassad,
and he had a meeting with the CIA asked him to do this.
I mean, this guy either, it was four different kinds of passports.
This guy either some kind of a sinister,
cloaked dagger, international spy,
or just a paranoid psychotic Brit with too much of bad booze.
And when I started telling him my opinions of the British,
which he doesn't live in London anyway,
he likes Paris to this favorite city,
which is where he's going to,
he likes Italy, he likes Paris.
And I started talking about the Brit's and about the world,
and of course at that point,
it just like would be like trying to talk to George about Cubans.
It was the same thing.
You couldn't possibly get through to this man.
Total denial.
The British are in such unbelievable demand.
Oh, and every people's need something to cling to,
and that's why the thing with the royalty,
and it has such great significance,
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
and of course the queen, how could she possibly
have done a better job under these circumstances?
I mean, the stuff that this man was peddling me.
Maybe that's what smelled.
Maybe it was really good, you know, but it smelled like.
I have a philosophy in life for all you people out there
who don't look too good like me, okay?
If you can't look good, at least smell good.
Ow!
One thing about me, I always smell good.
Whether it's brute, whether it's whatever the hell it is,
oh, the toilet, whatever I got splashed on me,
I got a shower, I got some stuff on, and I smell good.
I can't look too good, but at least I smell good.
Oh, man, there is nothing like getting on a plane
as a captive audience, and having somebody sit down
next to you knowing it's going to be about eight, eight and a half hours,
you're sitting together on that plane.
I mean, how much time can you spend enough in a crapper, you know?
You, there's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
And this man smells like a Brit,
like a drunken old smelly Brit, with those bad, black,
crooked, jagged teeth, that even Austin Powers would be embarrassed by.
Although he did keep going like this, he got a hundred,
26 after a one at five, 60 WQ Emmets.
Alonso, you're so big.
All right.
Yeah.
Your
I know
So
How young is too young?
You should be kidding me, because you could go to jail if you see with me.
It's my friend, you're with her friends on me.
She was 25 but she's just a thief.
No, 16, I've been my last upgrade.
Daddy called a cosmoner.
I just saw perfected me, because I helped her to be so much better.
My birthday's right now.
Of my show.
All right.
She'll pay.
You should be fine.
You should be scared of her.
Yeah, never holding stones when they're the sign of life.
What a sign.
She's looking by my side.
I'm seeing this trophy, but she's just a thief.
Wow, they're all cool.
133 is 560 WQ.
Anymore, I was away with that school teacher.
And those kids, those underage kids, which of course brings back that same question again.
How young is too young?
Nothing about that.
All those hypocritical meals out there.
Oh yeah, that's okay.
My 13-year-old son of his bank and his teacher.
That's okay, as long as it's a woman.
And as long as it ain't my daughter.
In which case?
560, 560.
And what about the hookering in the Haya Lea and in Kendall anymore about that while I was in?
No.
Well, I tell you, the new shirt travels slowly down here, doesn't it?
Here's sunrise.
Hello?
Can you, sir?
Yes, sir.
Okay.
Hey, we're finally getting out of this trash dump down here, moving up to Rochester.
Yeah.
Well, isn't that good news?
Yeah, it's good timing, too, but by timing it up there ought to be up to your armpits and snow.
That's right.
So, farewell to this dump.
Okay, good choice.
Nice timing, too, by the way.
560, 705, 60, 05, 560 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's Kendall.
Hello?
Kendall.
Hi.
Yes, sir.
Oh, sir.
First of all, who is the greatest actor according to your opinion?
The greatest actor of all time?
Yeah, in movies.
That's what I gather.
You were talking about some minutes ago.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe Marlon Brando.
Marlon Brando.
Yeah, I agree with you wholeheartedly.
I would like to drop a little whatever.
You see, I know.
Something, yeah.
Yeah, I know.
I think that this guy, the needle, is kind of old.
And he takes whatever.
Furthermore, if you have a team like the Kubrick Disaster, you know, a husband and wife,
a husband and wife, you know, a husband and wife, you know, a husband and wife.
So, I just want to hear.
It makes you feel better, though, that there was a big flop.
I'm very happy about that.
Oh, and I'm very happy about that.
But I'm glad I started too happy, but I'm happy about that.
I am very happy that you feel the way that I feel.
Thank you, sir.
And, God bless you.
Bye-bye.
I'll refit-arch.
560, 705, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello?
Yeah, Neil, how you doing?
Okay.
I just wanted to come to the club for points.
I heard some old bastards call you before and start talking about what happened in Denver with the football fans.
And he was saying that the fans were rioting and that this was a trend.
Well, this guy's full of it because what happened, there was the kids there wanted to rush to feel like we're doing a lot of college football games after a big win, right?
And the police just went overboard.
They started throwing tear gas at the public and stuff like that instead.
And that was the only other tease that I went to bed, I guess.
It was on some show they had on last night.
And we're talking about the fact that the question was, was it the fans who were overreacted or was it the police?
It was the police.
I mean, I went to the US and when we tried to rush the field there, the police knew how to take care of it.
They would just take the first couple of guys rushing the field, slam them down, throw them down, make an example out of them.
But this guy says, when the third guy, if they had no clue, they would have thrown it at the public.
But just don't rush the field, you know?
And then the second point, Robert and Neuro, have you ever seen a midnight run?
No.
That's a good movie.
He plays a total different character in that.
And not to say he's a great actor, but I think he's decent, you know?
Well, I'm not saying he's a bad actor, but I think he's highly overrated.
Do you watch the time he driver?
Yeah, that was the greatest rule he was ever in, yeah.
That was a great movie.
And the night run, you should see it.
It's George.
No, George Rodin, Charles Rodin.
Oh, Charles Rodin's in it.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, here comes lunch.
Oh, here comes the breakfast challenge.
Listen, he's growing like poison.
Oh, he and the full man.
All right, my man.
Okay, thanks.
Okay, we got 600 open lines here.
All of a sudden we were rolling along, singing a song there.
Once we heard from Frater, if I'm Suston Brown, whatever, from Abyssinah.
560, 560, 0560 on the AT&T wireless line.
Surprise the hell out of me.
Okay, let's see a little something here between now and two o'clock.
Let's see a little something.
Here's a mobile invoker.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon.
I'm calling regarding the Raging Bowl movie.
Uh-huh.
And I kind of disagree a little bit with you.
I think the movie was not great, but I think it was very interesting.
I think it was interesting in a number of ways.
What was interesting about it?
It portrays Lamada as he was back in the 50s where it was a different era of boxing.
It was controlled by the mob.
It was told by a friend.
Different from what?
What's different about that?
Well, how many fixed fights have we had?
Is Sonny Liston still sitting in a corner there?
How many fixed fights have we had?
I'm just talking about the ones that we know about.
But his whole career was based upon being told when to win, when to lose.
Yeah.
So what made him different from anybody else?
You think they singled it out?
No, because fundamentally he was a good boxer.
It was not a question of a guy that had no talent being pushed by the mob to win when he had no merit.
The guy had merit.
The guy was never put down because he had to be sugary for the fight.
But what makes him interesting?
Don't you understand?
He was nothing.
As you look back through history, whether it sports history or any history, he was nothing.
He was not an important figure to most of us.
Wait, as far as that, I would agree.
If you look at history who was more important, he obviously would not rank in the top whatever number.
Right.
So then why is his life story significant?
The fact that he was a scumbag or the fact that he took a lot of falls?
What does that mean?
Who cares?
I just thought that it showed a different era.
It brought out into a lot of people the undermining of boxing, the undermining of one of personal's toes.
He was also a guy that had only one fight.
Only they showed him throw in one fight in that movie.
There was only the one fight and then he went berserk after we were to win it.
I do this about it.
The whole song of dance.
They didn't show that going on all through his career.
They showed one fight that he threw.
I happen to know him very well.
I think the question was there were many fights that he was told what to do and when to do it.
If you don't do this you're not going to get a shot.
Right.
But that was part for the course.
That wasn't unique to Jake Lamatta.
Well, I think at the level of where he was it was more it was not as common if you will as in the underlies.
I don't believe it.
Well, okay.
I just don't believe it.
I think boxing is the most correct.
The first of all it's not a sport.
It's one of the most corrupt things we've got in America today.
And the people who are hooked on it they just keep supporting it no matter how obviously rigged it is.
No matter how grotesque the people are who participate whether it's Tyson or anybody else.
The you know, Evander Holymoly field who's turned a religion now who's only fathered 26 different kids by 26 different women.
Besides the one he's had with his wife.
It's part of a mental illness.
It's a part of the American psyche.
It's like the Spaniards with their bull fighting.
It's the same thing.
It's part of a cultural illness that we can't divest ourselves out.
We can't get rid of it.
20 till 2 at 5, 60 WQM.
How what is Plato's record?
I'm hard to try.
Can't get hurt a day to gather to tell where it is.
She won't touch up in there.
No.
Shacety I'm grieving.
It's so hard and believing.
Cause it's really like the sun.
Today the guy is really hot.
I can't believe she's the last being.
You must be something wrong that she's gay.
I really don't know where I went wrong.
I can't believe she's the last being.
I really don't know where I went wrong.
Maybe she hurt something.
She's saying I saw her.
146 at 5, 60 WQM.
There's only one thing I missed the 10 days that I was out of the country.
One thing that I missed not being here.
And I was it.
Other than that.
5, 607, 05, 60, 05, 60.
So who is most important historical figure?
We're going to make movies about people in history.
Who is more important?
Judy Garland.
Dorothy Killgallon.
Well I had a throw her in because of Brokus in there.
We always have to have a Dorothy Killgallon line from.
He's obsessed.
He's got a blow up dial.
Or this marginal boxer.
I just don't get it.
Jake Lamatta.
What was the big deal with Jake Lamatta that we had to make a movie about?
See if we made a movie about Judy Garland's life story.
Was there a movie?
I don't think so.
Was there?
No.
Now there's a good one for somebody to make.
That would be depressing because her story was depressing.
But at least she was a significant person in this era.
Okay?
Oh, what are you going to play now?
What are you looking for?
That Judy Garland saw.
I don't want to hear a judge.
I get depressed.
She makes me nervous when I just think about it.
I saw Judy Garland at the RKO theater in New York.
I was 14 years old and went there in 1956.
I saw senior Wences to the old.
Side-eye, side-eye.
He was great.
He was dead by the way.
He was 99.
Whatever he was.
Just died.
And Judy Garland.
She was great.
She was a tremendous performer.
But she was neurotic.
She was an alcoholic.
She was a...
You know.
Here you go.
Somebody who's a little cumulon.
Days gone by, like Jake Lamata.
But somebody who was important, somebody significant,
that we wouldn't mind getting depressed about.
I'm...
I'm...
I'm...
I'm...
Okay, get rid of it.
Getting depressed.
I'd rather hear Dorothy Kill-Gallon sing.
Which is why they killed her by the way.
She was getting ready to sing, I think.
Here's a lady in D'Areal.
Hello.
Hi there.
Yes, ma'am.
It's nice to have you back.
Well, thank you so much.
I call...
I call basically a tell you a funny story about being on an airplane.
But I listen to all these people.
I feel that I gotta say something about this love affair that we have with violence in this country.
Uh-huh.
I don't think it's just this country, though.
We're talking about the Spaniards and their love affair with the violence of bullfighting and all that.
But it's all just the perfect...
There's all of this, all these different movies.
The perfect example is how hype has completely tainted people.
Because they're talking about this jakeless model like he was somebody.
He was nobody.
Right.
I mean, if you want to talk about the fighters of the 50s, what about Rocky Marciano or Rocky Grazio?
Rocky Grazio, I don't know why.
Yeah, I mean, they were fighters.
They were real men.
They didn't have to go beat up their lives.
Or maybe they did.
Who knew?
And who cared?
Right.
Yeah.
No, but I could understand if somebody made a movie about their lives because they were that important.
And most people knew who they were.
But the thing that bugs me about this movie, the raging bull, is that the pseudo intellectuals, the movie critics, who aren't even boxing fans,
or most of them aren't even sports fans, but they rave about this as though there's something...
Cosmos and Black and White.
Well, excuse me, but it's not exciting, huh?
But the all the more reason it was boring.
Exactly.
I mean, basically, ooh, it must be art because it's a black of a white.
Yeah, oh god.
That crowd, man.
Those people need to be fed off in a space.
I'll tell you the story about being on an airplane.
My husband and I were coming home from Europe.
And there was this...
I usually sit by the window.
This absolutely beautiful woman.
I mean, she was so intensely beautiful.
That next to my husband.
And started coming on to him.
And I mean, really coming on to him.
Oh, right.
And I'm looking out the window.
And I'm just ignoring the whole thing.
Hey, you know what the hell?
I got him.
She can play around all she wants.
Hold on, man. Where were you sitting again?
I was sitting at the window.
See?
And we were three across.
Oh, I see you're in coach.
Yeah, honey.
How much have I ever known?
I tell you, at least I go to Europe.
That's the start.
So on your rate,
he's kind of like a trying to avoid her.
And finally, he says,
you know, you always hogged the window.
I never get to sit next to the window.
And I look at him and this is kind of strange for him.
You know?
Oh, okay.
All right.
We could switch places.
So we switch places.
In coach, this is a lot of problem.
Right, of course.
So we do.
Okay.
And then I sit down next to this woman.
Right.
The ungodly smell.
From this absolutely gorgeous woman,
who could be a model on any runway.
Exactly.
It was her time of the month.
Now, I know if you've sat next to a woman when it's that particular time,
who is not clean.
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
