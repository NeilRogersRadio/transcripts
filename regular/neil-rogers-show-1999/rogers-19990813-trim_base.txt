Play by play on the radio.
Play by play.
I'm going to be a little bit more.
I'm going to be a little bit more.
I'm going to be a little bit more.
I'm going to be a little bit more.
I'm going to be a little bit more.
I'm going to be a little bit more.
I'm going to be a little bit more.
And out inside the room it's a shooting scene.
Rolling powder tastes strong.
The sax we loaded in here comes that band again.
And if you say my play on the radio.
Play by play on the radio.
So, play by play, I saw it on the radio
We know the splinter to match your sky
And then after my baby time died
Very in there, and my voice of prince of a guy
And out of thin air, pictures on the house of kings
You smell the thunder and the seas to be
And help me excite the crowd to get a cheer
And if we say I play on the radio
Say I play on the radio
Say I play, I saw it on the radio
Say I play, I saw it on the radio
That's right, one more!
It's ready, it's ready!
I just put it in the camera and it's gone
And I just went to that long drive
And deepened the right field for it
With that back, back back, back to the old day
And you're paying just a good high on the motorfront of a bride
But then after my baby, make it come out
Oh, what a catch, isn't long enough to try
Turn it up loud, those pictures are coming in fine
And if we say I play on the radio
Say I play on the radio
Say I play, this is damn insane
Say I play, I saw it on the radio
Say I play, I saw it on the radio
It is going, it is going, it is going
I said it once and somebody is real lucky
That Harry picked yesterday to die
Somebody upstairs who has to take a few minutes off
Or what I would have done a four hour marathon here today
I am wound up tighter than a snare drum in heat
And I want to take back something I've been saying the last few weeks about the Gary Sarner and our sales department
Being a mosquito tool, that's an exaggeration he's in a Meba tool
There are things that go on in this place
And I said this right at the end of the show yesterday
About that bizarre thing where we had the same spot run twice in the same break
Which wasn't the end of the world
But it was just to give me a kind of epitomized everything that goes on here
But there are things that go on in this company
The likes of which I have never seen in my life
And I'm going to talk about all of them today
And some of you people with big mouths who work in this company
And there's more than one by the way
Who take great pleasure, who's the way of making up I guess for very tiny egos
Is by abusing everybody who comes in your path
Guess what, that ends today
Because if I ever see it in front of me
I'll get the two by four that I'm always talking about
And knock your head from here to kingdom come
Because the one consistent message that I've told the people who listen to this show for years
Don't take crap
Because life is too short to take crap from people
Because usually the people who do a lot of the crap are people who are crap
Now you're probably wondering what I'm talking about
And of course I'll have to set this all up
I left here yesterday in a great mood
I go to my car
I almost made it to the door
I had the button pushed on my kitchen, unlock
I heard the little click
I'm ready to get out, it was two seconds away from sanity
Now that was two o'clock yesterday
So it's 20 hours later and I'm still psychotic about it
About a display in the parking lot downstairs that went on
That is so unacceptable
And if anybody ever opens up a mouth like that to me
They'll have a knuckle sandwich in two seconds
And the people I'm going to tell you when you pick on
See this is something that really just amazes me
It's real easy to pick on underlings
Anybody can do that, the board ops, the producers, the...
Whoever it might be, anybody can do that
See I don't waste my time with that
I spend my time dealing with management who are always incompetent
And here at a level that is so staggering that it just blows my mind
But of using the people who work around you
And by the way, most of the people I've encountered here
The so-called little people who are underpaid and overworked
Are pretty damn good
Joe Costello, Robert, Josh Friedman
He may be fat and smell bad but he did our show a few days ago to find job
Tommy in the morning, I don't know him but it seems to me he probably does a good job
I don't know who's the... who does...
Who has to put up with that crap every day
Josh and Jason
Josh and Jason
Who has to be a gun who's all the time
See I'm going to tell you something
They had a bad day at the track
If you had, you know, not getting laid enough, whatever it is
Don't take it out of the people around you
It's not acceptable
Not acceptable
And it said that I have to waste time on this show today especially
And I always outspend plenty of time on it today
I feel like a school teacher here
I know I talked about it when I first started on the station eight weeks ago
And I said I'm going to have to bring these people kicking and screaming into the world of real radio
Or at least something close to it
Because they're so far removed from it that it's just unbelievable
You'd have to be here to believe it
You'd have to see it with your own five eyes to believe what goes on here day in and day out
Under the name of business
And abusing the people you work with every day
And I know that most of you listening to me right now you work for other people
And let me say it one more time
If you work for yourself and you make a decent living
I'm not talking about rich
But if you work for yourself and you make a decent living
I can't tell you how envious I am of you
Because working for other people blows it blows
Because most of the time you wind up working for people who are inept
Who are assholes, who are wannabes, who are liars, who are procrastinators
Who don't know what the hell they're doing
But that doesn't mean you have to take crap
And I'm not going to mention any names on the air today, fellas
But I'm going to tell you right now
Don't ever even dream of opening up a mouth to me
Because you'll not only have a knuckle sandwich but your head will be on your reiners
W-I-O-D-E-O-I hate that station
He's back and he's stalking the psycho
Who wants to make the Chicago Cubs pennant contenders
Clint Eastwood is dirty, heavy, carry
How everybody, this is Harry Curry with Steve Stone and the f***ing goodness s*** feet out of the bag
Clint Eastwood gives a whole of fame performance as the legendary Cubs broadcaster
There's action
The pitch, strike is the f***ing history of that f***ing alright past clogs
Suspense
If f***ing faith is the f***ing country, there's a f***ing override
Romance
Oh look at that f***ing dog, that broad Steve, holy cow
Clint Eastwood is dirty, heavy, carry
Coming to a theater near the youth
My baby, here we are
I want a tool, a tool
Three, three out of the ball
Ten, three out of the ball
One, two, three out of the ball
That's always root, root for the coffee
If they go with it, so change
Four, eight, one, two, three out of the ball
Get it!
Like I said, it's a good thing
We knew he was gone this time, we knew that was all over
And it was just a matter of time
But it's a real good thing, I guess, that for me also for my sanity
Because it'll break up today, what's going to go on initial?
Just a little bit of a diversion
Because Harry Carey made me a cubs fan, I couldn't have given a crap less about this Chicago
Cubs until I got a satellite dish in 1987, big dish, watch WGN
And there was Harry Carey doing a cubs game, and of course there's a little kid growing up
See this down here, like I've told you many times, is a wasteland
All you get on AM radio down here is no speaking English, but I be, but it's a tower of babble down here
Because it's so low, Florida's flat as a pancake
And as a result, the signals from like living in breeding places don't get in here very often
Very rarely
Maybe once in a while, if the wind is blowing in the right direction, you get WSB from Atlanta
Which blows
But as a kid grown up up north, you become a sports fan based on that radio
Back in the days when there used to be real broadcasts, there's not a bunch of X-Jocks
But people who could pay the verbal picture and make any sport exciting
Who could make the hair stand up on the back of your neck, who'd get you involved and make
Whatever the sport was, whatever the game was, get you emotionally involved in it
Even if it wasn't really all that exciting, they could still take it and make it exciting
And so I grew up listening to real broadcasts, there's not, unfortunately we got like one and a half generations now
Who've grown up being exposed to bush leagers, to X-Jocks
Joe Dajiola, Phil Rosuto, Jerry Coleman
People who couldn't broadcast their way have a goddamn paper sack
Because they want more a Jockstrap
There were a couple of exceptions to that like Pat Someral, who's a great football announcer
I don't care what anybody says, Someral's great, especially when he's sober
But most of these guys are garbage, but when you were a kid and you grew up listening to Mel Allen and Bob Prince
And Vince Gully, who I'm not a fan of his, but nevertheless he's still around
Not to, in fact, there's almost, and Ernie Harwell, who's also still around
And Harry Carey, K.M. O'Wex, doing the cardinals forever and ever
And Jack Buck, who started doing Rochester Red Wing baseball in the early 50s, won up in St. Louis with Harry Carey
And so Harry Carey made me a Cubs fan and the only reason I ever watched Cubs baseball
And I was lucky enough that the second or third year, I guess the third, well the second full season I watched Cubs baseball
Is the year they won the division and went to the World Series
With Sandberg and Mark Grace and Mike Balecki and Greg Maddox
And I mean, and then of course, IOD because Mike Disney, our GM at that time was from Chicago
And when it comes to Cubs fan, we started doing that thing every year where we would go up to Chicago and do a show from Murphy's bleachers
Right across from Wrigley Field
And it was a waste of programming, I mean there's no question in my mind that doing those shows just blew off the entire audience
But I loved it, it was great, it was a lot of fun
And George, you've got to go a one year for about two minutes until they said, okay, get back on a plane and go back home
Because you're having too good of a time and it's for free and we're paying for it, right?
Yeah, and we were sitting right under him, by the way
When he leaned out saying, take me out the whole game was ready
Well, he also came on the show the one year, I don't know if you were there that year
No, that was the year before where Marvin got to go even though I was your producer
Yeah, well Marvin of course, that's another story
But at any rate speaking of abusing the producers, there's somebody who should have abused and I didn't even abuse him
God, we're a waste, we should bring him back, try it again for about just one show would be good
Make up for lost time
But at any rate, so the one year, I guess it was the first year we did the show up there
And at that time, Saul Fouce was my agent, I wonder if Saul still in jail
But anyway, he was my agent, he was also Harry Carey's lawyer and agent
And since they were so tight, Saul Fouce was kind enough to get Harry to, you know, come over to Murphy's bleachers before the game
Which was a big deal because everybody's always, Harry was driven by limousine from the hotel he lived at in Chicago
Which somebody will call him, I don't remember which hotel it was, but he and his wife Dutche lived in this hotel
And because Harry didn't drive, because he liked to be a bud man and the imbibe by hell of a lot
They used to bring him by limo to really feel every day
And so we're on the year doing the show and it gets to be, let's see, in Chicago would have been the game start there at 220
So it was 120, we're still on the year
So maybe it was like about 1230, I guess
And Harry had been supposed to come by around that time, didn't show up
And I'm saying, well, of course we know how busy he is, he's not going to be able to make it today
But it's really great to be here across from really feel
You can at Murphy's bleachers, you look out the window and there's the ballpark right across the street
And now as I'm saying this, the door opens
And here's this very little unimposing man with these big glasses walks in and there's Harry
Who took the time because Saul F. Astman do it and came on the show
And he was just as amazing in person as he was on the year
A real character, one in a billion
And I brought back the days when he did St. Louis Billiken's basketball in KMOX
Which most people of course don't even know that they ever did that
And was great at it too
I mean to think that I'm listening to University of St. Louis basketball on the radio on KMOX
I mean how the hell could I have been interested and really wasn't
But he just made it so goddamn exciting that you couldn't help but listen
And back in those days, Buddy Blatner
And there's another ex-jocke and he was great, he did the St. Louis Hawks games
Back in the days when he had a few white people playing basketball
And you didn't have to be a seven foot freak to play and there was a great and exciting game
When Bob Pettit and Cliff Hagen and all those guys were playing for the St. Louis Hawks
In fact, Buddy Blatner was so popular in the St. Louis that when he tried to retire one year
There was such an outcry from the fans that he had to come back and do another season of Hawks basketball
So anyway, after all these years of growing up and listening to these people then I got to meet here
And like I said, 87 got the Satellite Edition became a big cup fan and watched all those games
And even last couple of years as bad as the cups have been
If I was home in the afternoon, especially on a weekend and there was nothing else on
I'd flip over to WGN and there would be Harry doing the games
And it was kind of sad
It was kind of sad because the last three, four years especially
After he had the insurgent, not just so much after he had the stroke a few years ago
But after he fell down down here, that was about three, four years ago at the P.P. Park
And he really was never the same again after that
And of course, here's a guy who had a stroke
But you know, it's the choice you make
He wanted to live life to the fullest and he was a carouser and a drinker and etc.
And that was his choice
But he still made it to 78, which ain't all that bad
Not too bad, especially to be able to live life the way you want it and enjoy every minute of it
And so Harry Carey has gone to what that basically leaves you got your early hardware in Detroit
Who they tried to screw over and then they fans forced them to bring him back
And then Scully and Los Angeles
And you got a bunch of, you know, a few people like Mike Lang and Pittsburgh
Who are real creative, real personalities, real strong identity, real great broadcasters
Who can paint a verbal picture and make sports exciting
But boy are they of anishing breed
Another 10 years, there won't be anybody like that anymore
I became a hockey fan in 1958 and never saw a hockey game in my life
Never saw it
There was no hockey on television then
And as a kid flipping around on my radio there and I used to listen all that baseball
I'm on Saturday night
I'd come across 740, a CBL in Toronto
And I would listen to this man on there, it was Bill Hewitt
And I thought, God, this is awful exciting, I don't know what it is
But it's very exciting and it was hockey night in Canada
And I started listening and I became a Maple Leaf fan 40 years ago
Based on listening on a radio
And I would tune in every Saturday night and then I would start following the results in the newspaper
And here 40 years later I'm still stuck with the same crappy team
But nevertheless it's an important part of my life
Based on great broadcasters
And so when somebody insults my intelligence
And tries to tell me that pretenders
And I don't want to mention any names Chris Moore
But people who sit and try to be comedians and refuse to describe the action
That people who couldn't make a game exciting if he held a gun to their head
That these are broadcasters, these are sportscasters
Most of these guys today are a joke
Fred Q6 just retired and bossed into the Bruins for 100 years
One of the best, one of the greatest
And he was in, I know Fred was about the same age I guess his Harry carry
Close to 80
And he could still be working
Could still be working and could still be one of the best
Because he made the game exciting
Because he was into it, because he was a fan
Because he knew how to paint a verbal picture even on television
Even on television
Painting a verbal picture
Last night came across because when we got these Olympics there's nothing on
It's a joke
Came across on classic sports on a small dish that were shown the final game between Canada and Russia
From the Canada Cup 1987
And Dan Kelly was doing the game on CTV
And one thing about classic sports that bothers me a little bit
They dig up all this great old footage
But they never give credit, in fact I don't think they even know who some of these people are
They never give credit in taking who the announcers were
And Dan Kelly, there's another voice from KMOX and St. Louis and the St. Louis Blues
And before that the Montreal Canadians
One of the greats, the Suncanned broadcast is way out of a paper bag
Over there with the avalanche
But nevertheless Dan Kelly was one of the greats
And there he was last night doing that Canada Cup game
So that's one of the reasons that this whole we were talking about yesterday
This synthetic era of sports
With all these contrived songs and all this bull crap
And with the signs up there that show you a window applaud
And when you're supposed to get excited
And all these prefabricated ball parts that all look the same and smell the same
Not a question of living in the past
It's a question of having had something taken away from you
Because it used to be fun
And now it's nothing but business
It's all that is just business
There isn't even the slightest element of fun to most sports anymore
And of course here we are on your all sports station
And in a couple of days or a few days or in a couple of weeks
When they start wrapping the bombs on Kuh-An-E-Rak
I've been wondering this last few hours because I did see several times yesterday
They see an end show that over and over
And that the meeting they had at Ohio State
That was supposed to be an orchestrated thing
And there you know, bubbles on earth the other day
And hey I'm all for them
I hope that they bomb the Iraqis into the stone age
Because like Clemens has said in Godfather
One, if they'd have stopped Hitler at Munich
They wouldn't have had to be there right then
But here's all these punks at Columbus
You know there may have been about a dozen to make it a lot of noise
So they showed that over and over and over again
Of course it's very obvious the seeds are being planted now that we're going to go in there again
And I'm thinking to myself I'm taking that one little finger
Now I'm scratching that little spot on the back of my head
I'm playing Gregory Jr. now
And I'm scratching that spot
I'm looking down at the floor and I'm asking myself
What's going to happen when Gulf War Part 2 starts
Having been on WIOD during Gulf War Part 1 and during Hurricane Andrew
And during a lot of other things that were going on in this community
Where people tuned in to hear us talk about them
Oh I do have a TV set up here thanks to Jeff Cohen
We have a satellite this year thanks to Digital World Satellite
Digital World Satellite Company
We're kind enough to donate to us
And I do have a window so I can look out the window and see if there are any mushroom clouds forming down on 441
There are any magic mushrooms going in the parking lot
But other than that I have what do we do just as Bob Prince would say
We just kiss a goodbye
We just kiss the audience goodbye
And I hope that it's a real quick war
No one lasts for two or three days
Saddle who say the mother fucker
Saddle who say the mother fucker
Saddle who say the mother fucker
Saddle who say the mother fucker
I racked a crappy little constraint
It sounds like the first action on a space
Just get rid of that
You're in drinking chubby
And blow up the whole goddamn place
Saddle Moses the mother fucker
OH Roland no to this
Dude come here
Diplomations
Mobile in for Lauderdale. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes sir. I have a group Daniel Spy report.
Yeah. Before I tell you the Spy report I have to tell you the thing about this.
Yeah. The Domino's pizza situation I think that's the biggest abortion I've ever heard of.
What the driver is not going in a certain neighborhood? What do you mean by that?
Well I mean the fact that the drivers are wanting to go in a bad neighborhood and a bad
neighborhood happens to be black. The black people are being persecuted.
Right. Yeah right. Exactly. It's always the same thing. You're you're
persecuting your discriminating because you're not willing to risk your life and come into a neighborhood
where there's all this crime. Exactly. The judge ought to be like I said the judge ought to be
forth to go to work for Domino's for a week and make him deliver all the pizzas in that neighborhood.
Let's say what tonight about a year ago at Florida A&M University the ratlers
yeah the pizza companies absolutely stop delivering in those neighborhoods because they were being
ripped off and beaten up and everything I think even a year ago someone was killed over a
friggin pizza. Nice. Now the Brook Daniel's Spy report. Yes sir.
Besides who also by the way was extremely abusive to work board ops and totally unacceptable
in her behavior. Go ahead sir. Besides the fact that she's having my baby I saw her on young
circle okay pushing a push card around the circle and you know what Neil her leg is not wood
it's plastic. What did this man just get to what was that what did he say you don't remember that
they were making jokes uh pretend he had a wooden leg on the air no I don't know who started it
whether it was on that show or Rick it turns there and he's having his baby and she's got a wooden
leg I don't have no idea what this man was just talking about very very old but since you mentioned
Rick Riley though and I was talking yesterday about how much I like Rick and Sudden we had a lot of
fun working together that's all true the one thing that did disturb me well or a couple there were
several but one thing that disturbed me the most about Rick that he did that is unacceptable and
that is abusing the board ops you don't do that and especially Adam who is a hard worker and really
dead it whatever show he's working on he puts his energy into it he's a dedicated trooper man
next to George he was the best over there and you ought to appreciate it when you have somebody
good working for you you should appreciate it and treat him right that doesn't mean you always
have to agree with him but to abuse people the brow beat people and to do it on the air or off the
air but on and off the air it's unacceptable and we had a mistake and yes I did go ballistic over at
the end of the show I wasn't taking it out I needed to bloody in particular I just was pointing
out that it's par for the course on this joint because this place is so screwed up and so somebody
upstairs our traffic lady which I don't want to mention filous by name but somebody upstairs
gets wind of this which I'm sure she's listening right now and I'm very happy to know that and
starts calling people over in the other building at QA and abusing and screaming at all kinds of
people none of whom by the way were responsible and even if they were wasn't the end of the world
it was a mistake and it was embarrassing playing the same spot twice in one break but it wasn't
justification for reaming people out and carrying on and screaming and abusing people some of whom are
working for minimum wage or next to it and having to take a lot of crap and so if I have to spend a
lot of the show today and I'm not I'm not doing it to try to paint myself out as being Mr. Primadon
I'm not but I just don't believe in abusing the people that you work with now in management I'll
make an exception for that because they deserve it these people especially you can't complain about
our management because we don't have any we have wannabes we have people who make all kinds of
promises and grandiose representations and then you come to find out well they really don't have
the final say on these things anyway because the beasley people over there in Naples these are the
ones that control the purse rings on this outfit which is why every single check for any amount no
matter how small it may be has to come from Naples and has to be signed off on by the beasley's which
is also why people wait for weeks and months and for lifetime sometime before they get paid by
the beasley's and I'm not making it up I have no reason when I came to work here always like when I
started with packs in the first three months were at paradise they left me alone we were having a
good time we had some actual engineers and max but generally speaking now it was paradise we had a
great book that fall book was gigantic it was humongous the log was sold out with real spots by
and it was paradise then of course when it came down to renegotiate that window in my contract and
buddy bud started acting like buddy bud packs and then we started having some real problems and even
though George will find this distressing that I would say this after they blew out Steve Nichol
because they thought they were doing me a favor and brought in Pete Boulder and Walter Sabre
the body twins and started dicking around with the programming and putting all those corny that
corny crap on here and brought in John Ford to bring back the old corny iod jingles how's iod doing
now by the way how's the talk on iod oh they're not doing talk anymore they're all news
w i o d oh i hate that station but i went in there with the best of hopes in spite of all the things
that been i've warned about buddy bud is born again he's this he's that he's a madman etc i went
in there with the greatest of hopes because they inherited me they inherited my contract i had no
choice at that time and so when i came over here i had the best of hopes and people gary sarnor
is telling me and this one up there the one i'm talking about today which i don't want to
mention filis binding they're telling me oh you'll never work for anybody better than Greg
Reed he's the best guy in the world but i beat by the boop he takes care of his people his word is
gold and yada and then of course i proceeded to go through several months of near nervous breakdowns
every time i was back in town and you know thank god i spent most of that seven months out of town
and out of the country far away from here or i'd be in a rubber room right now i'm only right now
at this moment starting to calm down just a little bit from the first 50 minutes of the show and
they're preceding 20 hours which other people might not have thought so much about but to me it
epitomized where i am and what's going on here and it's an ugly picture and it's not going to
continue like this you have my word on that it is not going to continue like this so yesterday at
the end of the show in our final commercial break we had a spot that ran twice this is the second
or third time it's happened this week a thirty second commercial that ran twice in the same
commercial break at the beginning of the recorded spot and at the end and i sat here with my mouth
open down to my puppet and i came back on the air since it was the end of the show and i gave a
little two-minute seminar to the people in sales and in traffic and whoever else works here that you
don't run a sponsor's commercial twice in the same break and then i find out the reason for this
was that this is petaloma restaurant and it really bothered me it bothers me for any advertiser
but it bothers me because we had a great meal there several weeks ago George and myself and John
and the crystal and the the the zolten and his wife his name is zolten by the way not zolten whatever
whatever hi well whatever it is we'll get to that in a minute by the way there's a thunder clap at
the end whatever it is but in any rates that we had a wonderful dinner it's a great place they
gave me my own little special usagara locker there and they're very nice people the food was
fantastic great steaks and Italian food they got a nice smoke room in there it's a wonderful place
great sponsor and it disturbs me because they're paying their money and they were buying a 60-second
spot and evidently gelled these over there in Japan playing a squeaky voice to radio and he's not
here to redo the commercial and as a result so instead of instead of scratching the commercial
which they're paying for a 60-second spot because we only have this 30 instead of scratching
in the words instead of writing a 30-second spot in twice in two different parts of the show
to be the equivalent of a 60-second commercial some genius over there decided that we would just run
the same spot twice in the same break well it takes up 60 seconds that would be like my sitting
here and saying I got a 60-second spot to do for a pizza lot so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
say hey pizza lot really has great food hey pizza lot really has great you know pizza lot really
has great food and do that for 60 seconds that would not be a commercial and Jeff Cohen would not
pay for it although he would like all the mentions see he likes getting it for free now which is
why I'm doing it and the spot too so I went a little ballistic about that and to come to find out
that after I walked out of here at about 203 and not all that overly concerned but it was just another
another one of these QAM aberrations that I'm becoming used to although I don't like them
and I'm trying to do something to embarrass people into correcting them and I was on my
merry way out the door and I got down as far as that stoop out back and there was speaking of stoop
there was Gary Sarner there was mosquito tool himself sitting there on the stoop smoking a
baget I said how you doing okay get to my car I pressed that little unlock button on my keychain
I'm only moments away like two seconds from opening the door and being on my merry way
toward the turn bike and I hear Neil and it's mosquito tool and it comes wandering over because
he wants to do the anti-routine wants to get into a whole anti-song it a dance about all these
rumors about the station being sold and what he has heard is that Cox Broadcasting wanted to buy
power 96 and kiss but had no interest in buying QAM and of course it would make no sense to me
really in spite of all the hopes that I have it would make no sense for the Cox Broadcasting for
the sisters to sell IOD with a much superior signal and practically give it away including the
property and then come back a year or so later and buy this station with all the debt from the
Wayne Heisenga with all the sports franchises with the big payroll with the inferior signal it just
wouldn't make any sense even though that's the rumor that we continue hearing so I'm engaged in a
conversation about that and then he asked me something about a certain sponsor which is one of his
accounts which has been running multiple times on this show he said you know those people are
only buying one spot a day they're only going to pay for one spot a day I don't know what that's
all about why is she putting and I said I really don't know but I find it very annoying because it
becomes extremely repetitive and I don't think that company A will call them just for argument just
to use a letter that they're trying to buy all those spots every day it really isn't necessary
and they're spending a lot of money and I don't think it's right that you know so now the person
that I've been talking about here today all I do not want to mention Philis by name comes
wall-sing out the door and starts saying at it and at that point there wasn't even a half a word out
of the amount I said hey Philis how come company so and so is running on my log twice today
and three times yesterday because it's Gary's account and he tells me that they're only buying
one spot a day well at that point at that moment remember when we dropped it bombs on Nagasaki and
Hiroshima at that point they're unleashed as she came racing over to where we were standing close
to my car all the way across the parking lot a torrent of verbal abuse at Gary's Sarner the
likes of which I have I don't think I've ever seen from anybody in this business to another human being
and because the guy evidently is wimpy I mean he never stole a free train he's probably not that bad
of a guy maybe I don't know him that well or really don't I have no grudge in the wax to grind with
him but because he's wimpy and kind of a putts I guess it's another easy target when you've got
people intimidated and they're used their condition into being screamed at and now pay for now it's
another effort spots and I'll get got dead great and this I I'm telling you I thought that
eyeballs were going to come popping out of this person's head and I'm standing there we're not
going with a discrepancy to banana and now the conversation switches to this playing the pet
aluma spot twice in one break at the end of the show yesterday and Luann ourselves manager such
as she is is standing there also so now there are four of us standing out there and this conversation
is developing I call over there and I told Joe and I told this and I tell and this hysterical
performance is going on Linda Blair on her most psychotic day in the exorcist never came close to
way performance like this I mean we got the Oscar is coming up very soon why not make our own
nomination and then she turns to me the body you know that account that's Dalton Dalton and say
that you think is so great and at that point is when I should have just walked away and got into
my car and left the premises I never said Zoltan Zoltan whatever's name is with so great he looks
great which he does and he's a nice guy which he is and is bright and articulate and we had a good
dinner that night he's got a lovely wife and he probably could be this is his first job in
radio sales like many of our people and he probably could be a damn good sales guy with a little
bit of guidance and assistance and not too much brow beating but you see that you see the way
this all fits in together everybody everybody is inept everybody is incompetent except this one
person is the alter ego of the general manager because he's been here a very long time and will
defend into her death will defend the defenseless will make excuses for aberrant behavior for lies
for procrastination that is unbelievable I don't need a lecture from Phyllis or anybody else about
the experiences that I've had with this company these last 11 months with the near nervous breakdown
of having to coerce people to live up to their word to build these studios such as they are
with attempts to get paid for things that were supposed to be paid to me like for hockey tickets
and to get people paid who had done shows for this radio station I could give you a list of stories
and we're still working my lawyer by the way I'm wearing those tv spots and billboards to promote
the show that are in my contract and we're promised that we've had a half a dozen different dates
we've been told they're going to start and I've been on here here almost two months and still haven't
seen a guy with a sandwich board promoting the near Roger show or the Hank Goldberg show or the
worst team or anybody else haven't seen it anywhere nowhere and I'm out there for 55 minutes I might
as well go home and argue with my dogs at least they would have smiled and I wouldn't have had it
wouldn't have heard any bull crap so unless there's anybody in sales who needs to speak to me about
business let the word go forth today from bill got let the word go forth at a 201 every day Monday
through Friday that I'm here I'll be gone I'd rather go run naked in traffic for an hour then
spend another hour like I did yesterday listening to stories and rationalizations and then the other
the big guy and I could John what is it named John Jaros I don't know what he seems like a nice guy
means well he drives up in his big catalog what is his title what is his function oh we don't know
something to do with power 96 but also another one of those people we have all kinds of people upstairs
we got that ray guy we got we got we nobody knows what they do I know seriously you're laughing but
it's true we don't know what they're very very we don't know what he does and this particular guy
has met me in the elevator on a couple of occasions over the last month and a half and so all of the
mark when you're people from mark when you're that's Mike son his advertising agency are going
to be coming in tomorrow to shoot some footage for the promotional campaign we're going to run on TV
great excellent never happened so I've asked him some questions about that and he tells me
all we had all this TV time reserved and we're going to do this and about a beat and spend a lot
of money and then for some reason which nobody can get an answer to it was all put on hold you
know remember George before W.I.O.D. was sold they had a $200,000 TV campaign that we're going to
run and then inexplicably it all got pulled remember that I'm not suggesting that there's a parallel
but I do remember the figure very very specifically that there was a $200,000 TV and billboard campaign
to promote W.I.O.D. it got put on hold and we couldn't get an answer why and then all the rumors
started really flying out in the heavy and the next thing we know Paxing bought the station oh god
he's got his fingers and legs crossed and his eyes too very enough with the pamphlets already
when the hell was the baseball he'd get anywhere here's Andrew dice clay for diceroni all right let's
say you're eating you sick and tired of potatoes and that's stovetop shit do like me honey eat this
dice droni come on it's almost as simple as you put the f***ing bag in the f***ing pot and you turn on
the f***ing stove you think you can manage that honey hey but I've been a f***ing thing done so remember
thank you doodle came to town right none of the phoney stuck a feather off is a f***ing thing called
it dice droni all right it must have been little dice roney on the despair I like that that was a
great effect all right all right nice going guys listen you hear that the CD is hyper ventilating
and it's going a shot why does it seem that it's always I don't know about you but it seems that
it's usually women who think that they have not always I mean you know I indicated we have more
than the one person here guilty of brow beating of the troops in the screaming and hollering and
going psychotic but it seems that generally the majority of people who behave this way toward
their fellow co-workers are women now back at iod we had a woman a young lady who is still there by
the way which is astonishing her name was Sarah still is oh she hasn't changed that I would and she
was the promotions lady and they had a very silly promotion that they ran one time it was called
the wiod tragic trip maybe some of you long suffering listers remember that deal wiod oh I hate
that station is a really dumb promotion and it was a very vague and ambiguous nobody really knew
what it was we were going to send somebody to someplace where they really didn't even want to go
and the whole thing was just a disaster and she came into me one day and she stood in front of me
during a commercial break while a show was going on no less but during a break and I had indicated
that I didn't want to participate in this promotion because it was just a garbage and it was
kind of I really don't remember the details but in any rate she said and I was we're trying to
promote your show you ething on grateful son of a bitch screaming and shrieking here's this I'd
say early 20s how will we say she was about 21 22 years old and she's standing there not not
the you know because I consider myself such a big big shot but I do happen to be human being
and of course I wasn't in the middle of a radio show now I'm going to tell you something because
this wasn't the first time she had done it she had also done the same thing with Rick Riley as
are we call remember yes I remember was it about this or something else whatever was about
under shielded adam wants to should have been oh that's right adam what was the line about adam
that's why you were just aboard up right that's why you're just the board off see women and minorities
they think that they can get away with anything in the workplace because uh well you fire their
act is going to be a sex discrimination lawsuit there's going to be a racial well whatever it is
going to be a lawsuit so once you got women or minorities man there are a lot of companies that
are terrified to ever turn them loose because no matter what they do they think they can get away
with it and they're the first ones to yell by the way they're being harassed and the scrimmaged
against and yeah I know those stories from upstairs by the way too I know all about that crap
pilot garbage and then we also over with the packs in iod we heading and let me say it again she's
still there Sarah in the cocks building over there where by 100 used to be on 29th avenue in Hollywood
should have been fired on the spot that day should have been fired she's still there she's a woman
and at the packs in iod which I will not mention any names here because I'm not that stupid we had a
lady working there who was so incredibly incompetent and that if she didn't take 10 years off George's
life I have no idea what possibly could because he and I'm not going to say what her job was or what
her name was or who she be but I'm going to tell you this right now he had to redo her job every
morning before the show started and boy talk about a big hostile mouth and an arrogant hostile attitude
I mean just look at that lady cross side man and the wrath of Jesus and Moses and Abraham Solomon
would come down right on your posts I'm telling you man this is this is if you get nothing
else out of the show ever do not take crap from anybody that's my message and maybe people think
that they've been able to do things for years here with impunity but that's before I showed up on
a scene not that I'm such a big shot but obviously I'm not intimidated or threatened by George
Beasley or Bruce Beasley or Greg Reed or Duff Lindsay or what's her name Phyllis upstairs I'm not
here to abuse people I'm not here to browbeat people I'm not here to do any of the above all the
you know I'll do my stick on the air I'll do my usual poke and fun of the sales people I'll go
quite frankly most of my experiences with the sales people are been very fine no problem really
but I'm not here to abuse people or to play God or to look down my nose at anybody else and so the
shenanigans that have gone on here for far too long stop now because I'm going to tell you something
if it happens with anybody in this building or the other building again I'll hear about it and you
single time I find out that this kind of crap is going down at WQAM power 96 kiss anything to
do with the Beasley Miami stations I'll put it on the air if that's what it takes to for some people
to either look in the mirror and assess the way they interrelate with their fellow workers or maybe
in some cases and I really don't know get some assistance for whatever it is that is troubling them
and you may be chuckling when I say that in there but I'm telling you I don't I just don't I don't
I don't cut into that kind of behavior I'm sorry here's a mobile lady and there's a lady mobile in
Davie hello hey hey okay man I gotta tell you some advice I'm embarrassed to say it but I'm from
Davie if anybody calls from Davie expect retardedness to come out from them they're very slow
screwed up people yeah and so I would expect any smartness to come from them folks they're all
redneck kickers and sitting there drinking okay great but what is there something going on today
that we don't know about I thought Monday was the holiday I thought that was president day maybe
they maybe they celebrate like a president's week this is them amazing today this is astonishing
we're having an impact on this show the likes of which I can't even believe we're reaching everybody
we're reaching even the retarded people today people on the inside who are locked up and padded
cells we're reaching them here's a mobile in Miami hello hi good afternoon yes sir I want to tell you

can't say crap on the air sir I totally understand your frustration I share it with you believe me
here's a mobile in Miami hello speak to me sir okay yeah so if you're talking about
pun I need six plus or no I don't know if you've caught the channel 10 interview a private radio
thing with a kid Terry for five ninety six now I heard about it I already left his walker home
yeah well I was one of the jocks on one of the supposed of pirate radio stations that's
an an important price and you know here's like you know saying all these things he's been on top
of forever he's trying to shut us down twice already wait a minute wait a minute let me ask
you this why should he not try to shut you down why the hell should you be allowed to have a
pirate radio station where you're on their spooing crap on the airways you have no
after absolutely not so absolutely not we were we're the only radio station we're all we do
is play the disco freestyle and then and uh retro music and we try to get a license but you know
you need half a million dollars to get a license sir you're not listening to me okay I don't care
what you're playing you don't have a right there are laws about this the airwaves are governed
by the government you don't have a right to just to put out a pirate radio station and then call
me and try to defend it as if he's a bad guy because he's trying to get you off the air you
have to be off the air no all the sudden yes yes all the sudden this covers but so reason's
ratings are going down we're taking all those listeners sir power 96 is the number one rated
station in the market number one and number two you're breaking the law do you understand that
sir you know what that means I understand that means but we're we're we're still in the FCC so
we're we're doing something you can sue the FCC from now until the year 25 25 when Zigerin Evans

trial here in O'Cala pertaining to the so-called obscene t-shirt reached the conclusion yesterday
of jury of five women and one man found a guy not guilty on all counts how do you like that
unbelievable they waste the taxpayers money to take a guy to trial because he wore a t-shirt that
some porkers decided was obscene and they dragged his ass off the jail and had to go through a big
song and a dance and the jury said you're full of crap anybody remember the first amendment right
up in O'Cala even though you still remember what it was nice going guys and thank you Frank

hurtled across the median as shocked motorist pulled over to help him Steven had
died lost consciousness only as paramedics placed him on a gurney the boy was in serious but stable
condition with broken bones on Thursday night at St. Mary's Medical Center was undergoing cat scans
and Barry Jackson's worried about if we're gonna have the Jimmy Johnson press conference
see what i'm saying we're worried she i got this tv and here thanks to Jeff Cohen in the satellite
this thanks to our friends at the digital world satellite not so i could watch ESPN and find out
if there's any big sports score stories breaking but so we could have CNN on here and find out
if the president's gonna get impeached if he's had any good blow jobs this week if we're gonna have

that guy was talking about anyway this little boy's mother Chris and had a 30 of west Palm
beats was charged with attempted murder and aggravated child abuse and was being held on $60,000
bail at the martin county jail it was had a second child abuse arrest in 1991 had a plea to guilty
to child abuse charges after her infant daughter turned up malnourished and convulsing at a hospital
emergency room she received five years probation court document she'll and here's the best part
her dad was going through a divorce and had won temporary custody of her children court record
show how do you like that she was going through a divorce and what temporary custody of her children
her dad and apparent manic depressive it was no longer taken on medication it lost a lot of weight
recently she'd become obsessed with the notion that a secret agency was trying to steal her son
according to neighbors and friends probably the uh... illuminati or the trial at a commission
she told them she discovered a plot on the internet was playing with their child
oh the plot was on the internet just like all those great NHL trade you see on there about 1045
a.m. traveling north on ian and he five it's been to up to eighty five miles an hour
the dot through the toddler out of the driver side window and then skidded into a ditch
the boy hit the ground screaming witnesses told police and continue to cries witnesses race to
comfort him a dad ran back to her child running about pornographic movies and poor international
news coverage in local papers according to witnesses and police well not at last part i think she's
got a point about poor international news coverage there's nothing in there about the disney
connection no she uh... i heard somewhere on one of the radio news is obviously not the
well thought us we would know we would know she was throwing out that she'd rather see the kid dead
than uh... to be exposed to uh... the pornography of disney movies oh yeah she probably saw priest
well maybe she smarter than we thought she knows that his most fact in the church she probably
saw priest and got better to shape this woman she's getting custody of her kids the first one
the little girl was convulsing and starving to death and this one she throws out the window
and people are worried because we're having too many abortions because we're not making enough
babies and the purpose of running around telling people to make a lot more babies and no
no with that birth control that'd be bad oh god almighty but i bet you the right to life is
not going to be screaming about this because this kids already alive see they never care about
anybody that's already alive it's only that fetus that they're in love with here's palm beach hello
and you know good morning i'd even talking about porkers the last few days uh... you just saw a story on
standing a north florida man arrested handcuffed taken away for standing on the roadside with a sign
that says speed trap ahead you was in our sea this reminds me the thing about the flashing your
lights to warn the other motorist that there's a speed trap how can they do that i just thought on
that i guess what they say is that you're interfering with law enforcement when you do that is the
technicality of just obstruction of justice oh my god is bad is bubble i don't even get any uh...
i'm job out of it a great day here's north my me hello
and you'll yes sir read me out the my m your morning rags here and uh... very jackass got a
caught article there about you
on how a disservice is to the sport idiots that they're not having the uh... sports
updates every hour on your show
yeah i mean police
you know that very jackass is a little immature asshole if there was anything very
earthshaking and important happening in sports it was fact that you was over here in the
middle of the show and i would put it on the year but the fact that not only that
like uh... joe saki gets injured we find out we had it on the year here yesterday
so if there's anything or taking i mean anybody that's that much of a fanatic
that has no life whatsoever which is very jackson by the way i mean this guy's
pathetic and of course he's nothing but a shield and an asshole
no the thing of it is you do there is no those fanatics who listen to the station
the i hear him yesterday the fucking up the hang
the sports
shrivels i mean it's it's it's a thing
it's a life so don't listen to the if you don't want to get a
entertaining but yeah it's just too bad that we can get all these people well
and when you got a sports station you're going to attract a lot of those people who
this is their entire life they're incapable of thinking or talking or doing
about anything else in the world and they want it they want to soak that up every
minute of the end and those you're right those people are pathetic i said that
since the day i came on this station and very jackson is one of them
yeah and then he goes because you didn't care they didn't carry out Jimmy
Johnson's uh uh press conference last week instead of interrupting you as a
floppy no we are going to be interrupting the show for his Johnson already
buddy else is not here about the free ages to free ages people to spring
a town football season is over if i hear one more talk about football about
the dog is dropping i mean god these people get a friggin life already amen god
calm down okay but he's right see very jackson this is not a sports show
i hate to paint you a picture i'm sure you're listening right now your little
putt whacker this isn't a sports show it's the neo-rodger show which is probably
the best god damn thing that ever happened at this radio station if i do say so
myself and the notion that we're going to be interrupting it to put Jimmy Johnson
out of the go blue like that get a life okay take an interest take up a hobby
like uh... rule russian roulette would be good okay berry take up something really
worthwhile and get with it but but see he feels compelled to write that because
he's catering to exactly the people this guy's talking about that's what his
column is all about broadcast sports here's a mobile in my me be tello
a new i was uh... who's gonna be the thirty first traffic for Seattle like a
coming summer for the i think i'll get with a great arm who plays for ischbubing
high in michigan absolutely correct i'm sure lots about that coming you know if you
thought i would be one crazy on draft a uh... in april every year just wait to hear
what goes on on this station when the NFL draft comes about oh jeez
well i think i'll need a lot of that would i saw that the cover of the herald that
would have that that crazy woman running down the highway drop in her kid eighteen
months old not two and a half so that that's it that's a fee i mean
and the mother they want to give the kids to the pop in my paper here the kid is two
and a half years old really other herald has uh...
eighteen months well i guess i don't know if that doesn't matter i guess it actually
big difference whether it's eighteen months or thirty months or whatever
the other the soft is a little is a little kid and she threw them out the god damn
window on the i-95 just said i can't and then you know the other woman that
stabs the mom in front of the kids i mean it's not so well and people like
very jackson are worried about who the dolphins are going to draft in the thirty
second round i mean you talk this last guy that called was right on target he said
everything that i've been saying and thinking for a long time i have no respect i
have nothing but disdain for people

Let's do Miami.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you, sir?
Very well.
I just wanted to take the time and see if perhaps maybe you permit me to speak.
I'm a pastor of a local church.
And I hear your program on a regular basis.
Yes, sir.
I can't say that I'm critical of your point of view.
The only thing that I don't understand about you is your atheistic...
What is it, atheist?
I believe you're an atheist, correct?
Yes.
God forbid.
Okay, meaning that you don't believe in God whatsoever.
Of course not.
Okay, what kind of watch do you wear around your wrist?
What kind of watch do I wear around my lip wrist?
Well, for example, Rolex watch.
No, I don't wear a Rolex.
Okay, well let's just say I take a Rolex and I put it in front of you.
And I tell you that that Rolex happened by itself, that it just created itself.
Wouldn't you say that I'm a ignorant person for thinking that that Rolex happened by itself?
Sir, you know something I wouldn't give a crap.
You're not...
You don't worry about how this planet came in.
No, I absolutely do not because I know that we don't know the answers.
We don't even know answers to things that happened a few years ago or a few months ago.
We don't even know if Monica Lewinsky was even given blow jobs to the president.
And you're trying to get me to believe a bunch of bubble-myses
that were written by primitive people thousands of years ago.
So, see if I did care about those questions.
See, long time ago I said to myself, we don't know and we're never going to know.
And that's the end of it.
I'm not going to waste my life listening to a bunch of fairy tales that are being spread by other people
for our purpose, for like taking over your mind and your money.
What happens when we die then?
You go right into the ground, just like Fido goes into the ground.
Just like the cockroach goes into the ground.
You go a dust-adjusted, etc. and so on. That's it.
I mean, I...
I mean, are you really afraid of death?
It's not a matter of being afraid of death because...
Sure, it is.
No, listen, religion is about two things.
Fear of death and money. That's the only thing that really...
You know what, you are absolutely right.
Religion. You don't need religion.
What you need is a relationship with God.
Not that there is...
No, God, sir. There's no such thing as God is religion.
There's no such thing as God is religion.
Well, yeah, I'm not going to play some medical games with you, sir.
There is no God. If you believe in a God that the Jews invented or the Goyam invented
or the...
Okay, so there's been thousands of God through the years.
Every culture has invented their own God.
The Aztecs with the Sun God.
Everybody had God. You know something?
It's all just a bunch of double talk.
That's all. But if it helps you to hang on to that,
I don't want to deny you that, but I'm certainly not going to be dying an opinion to express...
No, I agree with you.
I respect your opinion.
And I, like I say, I hear your program and I am critical of your point of use.
But now there are certain explanations that are logical.
So then there's only two things.
Either evolution...
But, sir, I want to ask you this question.
Okay? This lady, the tour kid out of the car yesterday, all right?
Are you listening to me?
Yes, I am, sir.
Thought I'm who's saying is making chemical biological weapons over in Iraq, right?
Are you listening to me, sir?
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.
Okay. We have El Nino, which is causing flooding and all these grotesque things happening
and people dying, right?
Right.
Now, if God is omnipotent, how come all of this is going on?
There's also Satan.
Ah, Satan. Where did he come from? Who invented him?
Who invented him?
Sir.
Who invented Satan?
Who created him?
Sir.
Who invented him?
Sir.
Who invented him?
I'm listening.
God created him a perfect angel.
Yeah. See, here we go again.
He created him as a perfect angel.
Obviously not.
I thought that was JT snow, and then they traded it with a giant.
He was a perfect angel.
Well, how do you explain?
See, if something is perfect by definition, it's just like God.
He's omnipotent and he's perfect.
But he keeps screwing up all the time.
And we have leprosy and we have cancer and we have bubonic plague.
And we have AIDS and we have all of these other diseases.
We got this new disease that we're talking about.
Every time you turn around, there's another new disease that affects the brain and eats the brain away.
Every time you turn around, there's another new disease.
And it's Satan.
See, that's a convenient excuse.
That's for morons to say stuff like that.
God is great, but Satan.
See, if Satan, if God is omnipotent, all he's got to do is get rid of Satan.
That's all.
Hey, you're gone.
Like that.
Like he snapped his fingers and he created the universe.
He also snapped his fingers.
Satan's gone.
Let's have peace and tranquility.
You live 300 years of peace.
We don't have all of these problems.
We don't have wars.
Man is perfect.
Doesn't have free choice.
But then there won't be anyone to test us.
Oh, yeah.
We have to be tested.
Like Abraham, go kill your kids.
I was just kidding.
Psych.
Yeah, just testing you.
Just checking out to see what kind of a good you, you really were Abraham.
And by the way, I won't get any circumcised.
Who you can...
Ishmael was.
Yeah, Ishmael.
Ishmendrick.
Schmendrick was circumcised.
Okay?
Ishmael.
All of these...
These problem I see is my God.
It just...
It boggles my mind.
But you know something I don't waste a lot of time thinking about it because I realise
especially...
The one good thing that's happened to me doing this kind of work and doing this show every day
is I realise how weak most people are.
Most people are such sheep like these people we have sitting on hold and somebody says something
while they're on hold and that they can hear.
And then we punch them up on here and they repeat it like a God damn parent, like a minor
bird.
Because their minds are so weak they don't have an original thought and their brain if
you could find it.
But thank you for your call, sir.
Always religious notes they're afraid of saying three little words that make it very easy.
Then when you start asking all of these questions for which we don't have any answers all you
have to do is say, I don't know.
There you go.
And people can't say that and never have been able to say that.
So since the beginning recorded time everybody says, oh well how did we get here?
And then okay we don't really know but we'll make up an answer.
Instead of just saying I don't have any freaking idea, let's make up an answer.
Let's make up some fairy tales.
Sounds reasonable to me.
And you know something?
They could have done a better job.
They could have made up some...
Like the Virgin Mary on the side of a bank building in Pensacola, I mean, come on.
Other cultures did do a better job.
The Virgin Mary on a toteen of pizza at what's your name's house?
Rosie, Rosie Riccardo, whatever her name is in Hollywood.
Oh, Rosie Lopez, I forgot all about her.
She's small potatoes.
Here's a lady in Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, ma'am.
Hi, you know, I just wanted to say I'm really enjoying your show today but I had a comment
to make.
Okay.
Isn't it true that homosexuals aren't supposed to go even gone?
What the hell is that, ma'am?
I'm just asking, is that the reason why you don't believe in me?
No, it has nothing to do with anybody's sexual orientation or anything like that.
It has to do with not believing in fairy tales.
So here's...
I don't consider it a fairy tale.
That's why I said fairy tale.
Here's another example of a caller, just like the other Julio that called before with
this...
Oh, yeah, sure, sure.
Same thing.
Same thing.
I really enjoy your show but now you want to take a little shot.
No, all you're promoting is negativity on the other hand when God promote...
Then let me ask you this.
Why do you listen to the show then?
Because you pissed me off.
I usually listen to the show but you know, this time...
Because it...
Because it what?
But this time, you know, you really...
No, let me ask you again.
Why do you listen to the show?
Nothing is negativity.
Yeah, you'll okay, then go find something positive.
Go find yourself a good vibrator, that's real.
And make sure it's on positive.
See, this...
You're not fooling anybody, sweetheart.
You're not fooling anybody for a second and if somebody says something that makes sense
and challenges all this garbage that's in your brain that you can't get rid of, then
right away you have to...
Oh, it's because you're a faggot.
It's because you're this.
It's because you're bald and old and you're Jewish and whatever it is.
And she just can't handle it.
She can't deal with it.
Well sweetheart, if you want to believe that there are little green men on Mars and on the
moon and on the cockamoon, whatever you want, it's a free country, go right ahead and just
be a bozo the rest of your life because that's what...
Nothing negative about reality, while it's pretty ugly but nevertheless, if you can cope
with it unless you're a weakling in which case you need religion.
And obviously you do.
Besides, there are a lot of self-hating religious facts.
Oh, there are a question about that.
That's why the Catholics have that dignity thing so that they can go there and pretend
that the church loves them and so on.
Even though the church, of course, the Catholic Church is just loaded.
There's nothing but fags in the church.
Just read anything you want about the Vatican.
There's no fags in the church.
Like I said, make no mistake about it.
You show me a guy in a dress and I'll show you a faggot.
Or a guy who likes to dress up.
Or both.
Under Johnny Bench likes to dress up.
Here's Kendall.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
How you doing, Neil?
Listen, I know everybody looks up to all the other Hawkshire toasts, but I don't get...
I don't get it.
Don't take this wrong, but how can you mix sports with real topics?
You ought to just stick to sports.
Sir, let me say it again.
This is the Neil Rogers Show.
It's not a sports show.
Yeah, but the bodily function jokes.
Who you're feeling to?
Nine-year-old boys?
What's the deal?
Nine-year-old girls, yeah.
What's the deal, then?
So in other words, you're listening, but you don't like the show.
That would you tell me again, sir?
You're never listening.
You're never listening.
You're never listening.
You're another one of these people who's calling to tell me how to do the show.
But for some reason, which you refuse to explain, you're listening to it.
Why are you listening?

I'm going to board again by the way I did bring in my Charles Templeton book through World of God, which evidently we must have somebody listen about there this time
because evidently we got a lot more response than that just from my talking about it on the tape from the old IOD tape on Monday that we did back when I was talking about it live
everybody there brother wants this guy damn book and unfortunately it's a Canadian book and I'll give the number I'll put that I don't know if you're going to have any success because it may actually be banned in this country because it's so honest
there's nothing ball that controversial about it up in the fact that he says religions a bunch of crap and he used to be a minister and used to be Billy Graham's best friend
and talks about what a phony he is which we all know but I do have a thing I'm going to read from there a little while because I figured in fact maybe I'll just read the whole book on the air
I'll just do it like not like Mark Scheinbaum I'll just do it a few sentences at a time as opposed to putting everybody into a coma
in my usual sneaky way of getting that stuff out
here's Miami Lake, hello
Oh yeah I know my friend
Yes sir!
You have it all wrong I'm sorry just saying
it's not that despotic
the real downfall of the society has to fall on all of the high meets will control the media
Oh the high meets will control the media
Great okay thank you very much Louis Farakhan do it a voice
The high meets are controlled in the media how do you like that?
I didn't know the media was in charge of our educational system
Of course the media brainwashing the public that's right they may be brainwashing them
the name of the book is farewell to God the author is Charles Temple and unfortunately it's published by
M and S publishing because this guy is a Canadian A by McClellan and Stuart in Toronto
and it's not available in the US which is a very I don't understand why that is
why the hell should this book not be available in the US?
Damn it but I will give you the number to call it's an expensive book it's 30 bucks
it's a hardcover book and it's well worth it because it's probably the most best investment anybody will make if they want to
if they want to immediately if not sooner have all the arguments that they're looking for
really we shouldn't have to argue because if you tell me there's a God if not
in cover about me to prove that there isn't that's always the logic and reverse that the religious use
oh there's a little there's a little green monster around the ceiling there oh yeah well prove that there isn't
oh well I don't see it well yeah but how do you explain?
Yeah right so anyway on the chapter called the God myth and this is very brief but it's you know I'll just pick
little passages from this it's very well worth hearing and Charles Temple and let me give the phone number first
it's area code 905 713 3852 and you have to talk to the order department there's a book number but it's just too many numbers
905 713 3852 order department that name of the book is farewell to God and the author is Charles Temple then
who says Christians are a small minority in the world approximately four of every five people on the face of the earth believe in God other than the Christian God
the more than five billion people who live on the earth reveal or worship more than three hundred gods if what includes the animist
or travel religions the number rises to more than three thousand are we to believe that only Christians are right Christians
need to remember that their beliefs came to them from the Jews they inherited the concept of God from Israel and expanded
to include the worship of Jesus of Nazareth as God a practice most Jews regardless blasphemy in New Testament times
the Jews were a relatively small group of Semitic people living mostly in a forbidding land at the eastern end of the Mediterranean
it was there belief that their God was the only true God and that the God's worship by their neighbors were all false
Christians having superimposed on Judaism the Christian faith have the temerity to insist that there is only one God there's and that the God of every other people on earth are spurious
the Apostle Paul stated bluntly in a letter he wrote to the Christian community at a thesis
there is no other name under heaven given among men by which you may be saved for there is salvation in no other such in sufferable presumption
and consider the implications Paul is asserting that anyone in the world who does not worship his God is damned forever
but let common sense rule for a moment it is reasonable to believe that if the creator of all earth and the father of all mankind
wanted to reveal himself and his well to the men and women of the world he would do so only to a tiny group of Mediterranean people
leaving the remainder of the world in ignorance but many Christians do believe in teaks this they believe that apart from their God
all men and women of impagant darkness indeed it is this conviction that provides the motivation for Christians
and their efforts to get the gospel message out even more incredibly Christians believe that the failure to accept Jesus Christ as Savior in order to be consigned to death at an endless hell
the implication of this belief is clear it is that the vast majority of the men women and children who have lived on earth are in hell suffering endless torment
and will remain in this condition forever to believe this is to make the Christian God a monster beyond imagining any intelligent human being will recognize that the concept is incredible
yet it is the clear teaching of the New Testament and a quote from that chapter by and of course this guy was a Christian minister for 19 years
and Toronto a good buddy of Billy Graham who says his full of crap and finally came to his own conclusions and left the church and has got a brain now
and thanks for himself and has written a fantastic book and he bunks very simply and very directly and very easily and very accurately all of this garbage all this kaka
with the gods with their the Jews with their god and the Graham with their godness one in the mud it's all a bunch of baloney
and of course in this country where we got all these religious fanatics running around trying to stick superstition and gobbling up into the school system
if we had as many people running around trying to teach you learning something in the school system we might have people with an IQ bigger than their finger nail
who would not be asking you no questions let's go to a mobile in candle hello hello yes sir
CEO how you doing I'm weak I'm weak my voice is weak like I'm okay I can tell you need to do something about that quote
no cold is going away it's just this audience I'm weak I'm more now I'm starting to hear that I'm burned out from assholes
I've been listening to you for a while and I haven't heard you kiss nobody's ass
yeah I don't I'm not a NASKISSER yeah look if I had a player on here and he's playing great I would say you're doing a great job
okay but I'm not going to kiss somebody's ass just because they're on a certain team yeah what the point is I do you when not only that we got so many other ass kisses in this town with
all of I need to kiss ass for you're right you know I think I am a hockey fan I play the sport every week practically yeah and and regardless they're not doing good oh well
there's no money but what is wrong with these people in this town what has happened to this to the audience what has happened to people are supposedly support this team
they have they have locked you on out they have nothing to say I'm going to tell you something after today I will never mention the H word on this show again ever
you got a lot of people that love the H word well that's not the same word have a great day pal all these hockey calls on plan is my glang stuff and Bob Cole and Bill he would
what's one of my waste and my time for here and I think there are people I then of course then the rib man you know people
love to show yet people the only calls we used to get off the earth George would get 10 million calls screaming and yelling complaining get this crap off the
air and the only calls we never get are people wanted freebies they start that's right that those shows were an abortion because the only thing people
wanted we used to be away free tickets panther t-shirts and just like the ass holes in the stands when they're throwing those t-shirts up and
it's not only the little kids that get hyperventilating even the adults at the arena hey I want it they're like killing each other for a stupid
goddamn t-shirt that's the epitome of the excitement in the arena please don't tell me it's because the players are singing that means a lot of those guys
are trying they may not be all that good but a lot of those guys at least they're going out there and give it a shot and compared to the first
two years which believe me I remember that like it was yesterday on our most co-lipose days were great
compared to that Roger Nielsen garbage they were playing fragile who value old coach oh my god I'm serious I'm doing a show in
Sanskrit I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm doing a goddamn show in Sanskrit these people are like Greek they're Greek
Brackdom that's it and like I said after they never they the hockey where they'll never hear another breath about it
those people I tune in to hear about that on the show find a new home baby you won't find anybody else in this town talking about it
and for good reason too because even if they knew something about it they'd be spinning their wheels they'd be wasting their time
I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm in the middle

Making a motor or an autonomous ride
peekaboo street my ass is this tell you what's wrong with the world today in
other's poor Canadians man those poor bastards are lost their gold medal
because this gabriotti guy the scoop ball tested positive for pot now pot
stays in your system for like a month three to four weeks okay now I think the
whole thing is ridiculous at best because certainly marriage we need is not a
performance enhancing drug by any stretch of the imagination no way Jose
unless you're unless the count contest is an eating contest then you got an
edge or a watching TV content right but other than that I mean if anything it
would be a performance dulling so you know maybe three four weeks this guy so
stupid that he smoked some weed back in Canada which of course is very common
place to say the worst extremely common place like out on young street and
church street all over Toronto way and I'm sure in Vancouver even in Moose
jaw wherever this guy is from he's probably from Whistler BC or someplace
like that oh yeah he's from Kitchener and the medicine hat and Whistler a what a
silly bunch of people I mean love a Toronto but what a silly bunch of people and
anything right so is so stupid you know these guys practice their whole lives
to do the silly crap and go over there because it's such an honor and such a big
deal and the smoking dope like three or four weeks before the go over there so on
the one hand naturally it's stupid and just like now there's an article in the
Sun sent over which hasn't learned about that yet I guess because they're sleeping
but pot testing games support for the NBA and some of the NBA biggest stars
favor mandatory testing of players from Erdogan are breaking ranks with the
players union and it goes on about Chris Weber and Isaiah Ryder and this one and
that one and the peekaboo street and etc and so on Joe says that the guy says
that he got it from second hand smoke at his going away party second hand smoke
they're like sounds like Bill Clinton now we're kind of like a second-hand blow
job that's gonna be the new excuse after today after the grand jury testimony
was second-hand job job oh sorry can't say that
I'll get you was more than a second hand job well at any rate I wanted it
hey you done for Capriotti here and when I'm at the left and ball on the court
I'm getting don't off my hand and I get my best hit off the judge for Capriotti
set his ball can bomb that's right it's the Jennifer Capriotti tennis ball can
burn cops will never suspect it innocent looking can just empty the balls
screw on the ball filling with water and yours set to destroy brain cells the
Jennifer Capriotti way
oh this is so smooth it's the bomb that's things it's a tennis ball can
a tennis ball can that's things it's the bomb proceeds benefit the Jennifer Capriotti
labels it that's but normal approved okay so that big goofy David Robinson all
star center of the San Antonio as per says we should be tested we should all be
tested it's a no-brainer meaning marriage or winning and I said you David Robinson
you're an asshole okay and a goody two shoes in the phony why is it anybody's
business unless it affects somebody's performance why is it anybody's business in
any profession all this mandatory drug testing all these different jobs now
it's nothing more than a goddamn witch hunt and it's nobody's business if you're
smoking weed well it's illegal so are a lot of positions in sex to okay but
that doesn't mean that it's anybody's goddamn business oh it's picking a
positions in sex I'm at mommy's house I'm gonna have to start taking notes every
week she comes up with another classic now she's decided that probably the
president must be gay and I said why would you say that with all these women
that he's doing oh but he likes oral sex forget notes you need to rotate oh my
god talk about out of touch with reality talk about from a very distant
generation of the long long past and I try to explain to her ma all men
like oral sex and of course she just went out to her next topic well that
explains why your dad so early you really want to get me started don't you
even Monica Lewinsky wouldn't do that okay for a lover money trust me when I
tell you the thought is so grotesque the thought of that is so puke inducing that
I can't even begin to tell you oh my god so no wonder ma's got an aversion to it
I think he did make a good point a bit in reverse but anyway yeah the president
to fag it okay because he likes her all sex so that goes back to the survey we
took last week which most of you lied about by the way but there you are my
thanks to president's a fact because he likes to oral is moral but anyway getting
back to this we business it's nobody's goddamn business and unless it affects
your performance at the orifice on the plane field of it some stupid goddamn
sport in the snowboard whatever the hell is guy is riding over there this
poor Canadian bastard this a capriotic gabriotic whatever this guy's name is
he ain't no peekable street I'll tell you that they got listen they got a
curler a woman curler from Canada her name is Sanders Schmurler I swear to
God we laughed so hard last night I thought I was gonna pee in my pants what I
heard on the CVC they were talking about Sanders Schmurler the woman
curler and she's from Whistler B C or some god damn place oh my god oh and you
people are taking this seriously any of you oh man Sandra Schmurler the lady
curler from Whistler B C but she ain't got nothing on peekaboo street I'll tell
you that who is almost as good as I I be hip or whatever that the coons name was
that basketball player from Maryland or Virginia who have a healthy play for
nobody cares about whether jox or anybody else is smoking weed because all this
audience is and they're second-tiered to be in drug tested like this is some
kind of a like a police state oh it is sorry I'm telling you that for years it's
a god damn police state they're gonna give you a drug test because you're
gonna work in Walgreens or something they're gonna give you a drug test to be
sitting behind a desk somewhere because you're the executive vice president of a
bank that's got like 75 customers in the Pukipsi New York they're gonna give you
a drug test based on what that's like the frickin ward police we got up there at
the CC that the congress gets together Jesse Helms and all these other Nazis and
they get together with these old prudish parts and they just make up a list
well you can't say this yeah based on what what we said so oh that's great that
sounds like the American way to me that sounds exactly like what the founding
fathers had in mind founding fathers who the hell were they and what how what
they're scoring the Olympics they grew hemp the founding father yeah they were
smoking the rope is what they were doing and they were also doing the slaves the
slave women but we don't want to talk about that because that's that'd be bad
let's go secondhand we've heard of the dangers of secondhand cigarette smoke
now we got the dangers of secondhand marriage we need smoke but it gets you
disqualified lose your metal baby and they'll stick your ass out there on
peekaboo street here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale hello okay sir first
I think actually hit did say for Maryland I think so but who cares yeah
about the drug testing thing yeah where do you draw where do you draw the line
you say it's okay that they smoke marijuana and they try to draw the line
marijuana is not a it doesn't affect somebody's performance it doesn't it
doesn't enhance their performance and people are like I just said a minute ago
I'm gonna go around stealing money and robbing banks and seven elevens and
gas stations to get money to support a marijuana habit it's ridiculous so
that's that's your reasoning for not testing it because of why what is your
what is your reason that you should test for marijuana well I'm not saying that
they really should I'm just saying that I don't think if they're gonna test for
one they should test for all I don't think they should draw a lot of they
test for nicotine to see if you smoke in cigarettes cigarettes are illegal but
what difference does it make whether it's legal or illegal like I said before in
the state of Florida any sex other than missionary position man and woman is
illegal okay so should we arrest everybody or should we go into people's
bedrooms and find out if anybody's doing it in the wrong position no I don't
I don't agree with that's what differences to make if we have a lot of our
care stupid laws whose businesses it if it doesn't affect anything or change
anything what difference does it make well then it looks like the problem is
actually with the law not that they're testing for marijuana I mean I agree I
think that they should I think that they should test for marijuana there and I
think that they should test for marijuana in the in the NBA based on what based on
I don't because I think that the jobs get away with as much crap as they as
they possibly they get away with too much so another way it's only only only
wait a minute only jock smoke marijuana is that what you're saying sir but no
but that's what we're talking about here is where the testing is done you brought
up that they're testing in the NBA they're they test in all look at you know
as well as I do that if you go and apply for a job in a lot of companies in this
country not just sports in any kind of endeavor government job you're gonna
they have random drug testing you know that I hope and based on what what
what is it their business if you're smoking pot I don't know maybe they're
afraid of your job performance maybe I'm not really sure I can't really I
can't really tell you why they do it I'm just saying that if they're gonna test
for how is that gonna affect your job performance well you mean if you smoke
marijuana the night before yeah exactly I'm not giving you an answer for why
they do it I said no but but we're having a discussion I'm not asking you to
justify it but what how is the smoking weed gonna affect your job performance
I'm not saying it will I don't know what's so what's the point well like I said I
think it's because they're gonna test for one they're gonna test for all I
don't think that if you say okay well hey it's okay if you go and smoke marijuana
we're gonna test you out for cocaine son of the
you know you don't see a difference between hard drugs and lower one we don't see
okay get a new phone sir and call me back I'd be delighted to do a debate with
your phone blows this guy doesn't see a difference between cocaine which is a
highly addictive substance which affects people's personality and behavior and in
many cases causes them to become dangerous that is correct trust me when I tell
you I have known people who become totally changed personality change are
untrustworthy those people most of you don't want working for you if they're
really addicted to cocaine if they have a serious crack problem or any other
kind of a coke problem for heroin this probably the night they had some
brought on their one of the in one of the tabloids shows last night the night
before he croaked how much they how much heroin heroin and coke and fish
food and whatever else he was doing all together and vodka on top of it just
to make sure you wash it down you gotta wash it down with some good vodka that's
right that's what Boris said bad enough it wasn't bad enough that he was doing a
heroin but he was doing coke too so he's dead Chris Farley there you go but I
mean this this guy comparing I mean oh yeah they're getting away with enough
is it is who cares about that why don't we get all upset if they're beaten up
their wife and their girlfriend why don't we get upset about that how come nobody
gave a crap at the Jimmy Johnson sign up Lawrence Phillips who's nothing but a
goddamn gangster how come then nobody cared about that but we're concerned if
he passes a drug test or not that really concerns me whether he's smoking marijuana
not whether he's gonna be beaten women up all over the place what kind of
mentality we'd be talking about in this country man we're talking about people
they just they can't sit down and look at this thing rationally because most of
them are emotional cripples emotional cripples and this crap about the NBA is
gonna do podcasting David Robinson says oh yeah we should all subject to it it's a
no-brainer the NBA as a no-brainer okay it's for a bunch of illiterate freaks
is what it is David Robinson you asshole here's Miami hello a meal yes sir how
you doing okay go ahead sir I'm listening okay well anyway on the second
hand smoke with the marijuana I have a friend who basically did not smoke
because of the government watching over him yeah and he enjoys burning
every couple of times so when he went to get a mandatory you know this test and he
came back positive he told the his his probation officer he's like oh no I was
in a room with a bunch of people smoking yeah an approvation officer gave him a
bunch of like I got a great bit for both of Brian by the way the tune of second
hand rose second hand smoke but anyway anyway he says that the
probation officer gave him a bunch of evidence about how much second hand smoke you
had to be in exposed to for you to come back positive for even a
miniskule amount you had to be in a room that was fought up for a couple of
hours you know constantly breathing it yeah and I mean if you smoke pot in the
bath at any point if you like to smoke that stuff and you're in a room and they've
been smoking it for two hours you're gonna tell me you're not gonna take a hit
or whatever and I mean snowboard so let's still let me ask you so I'm good
good well no wait oh I want to hear this about snowboarding what's here this
this I mean snowboarding in the Olympics who is not gonna think that these
snowboarders are not pot addict and you think all these guys are a bunch of hot
hot and it's oh yeah I mean they are the biggest burnout all the
surfers I knew in high school yeah surfers and snowboarders there you go I love
your logic man this is great I mean it's just follow the bouncing dots here we go
from A to Z to T to the FU okay great great job pal excellent that could have
been the greatest call in history oh man those those chronic pot heads man those
snowboarders I wonder about Sandra Schmurler the Curler I wonder what she's doing
she's probably got her hair up in curlers that bitch oh and Sweden by the way
when a woman a woman's curling mitre against Canada oh my god the Canadian like
95% of all curlers in the world are Canadians and they already lost one match
between that and maybe losing this gold medal they may never come out of
hiding they may like start to like the Escobos and build igloos and go inside and
never come out come out here's a mobile lady in Hollywood hello hello Neil yes
man good morning I just the first time I'm calling you however I listen to you
for years and I do admire many of the things that you say but however I take
issue a little bit this morning with the pot testing with regard to your
employment there are some situations where it is very dangerous to smoke pot
particularly if you like to drink beer lunch or even have a drink at lunch and
you mix it with the pot there are things you can do that you normally wouldn't
do like what well for example I know of a personal experience because it happened
to be an insurance agent and we have a very serious situation that occurred in
one of our insured business operation with a man did that just that at lunch
time came back and in a job that he had been working on for 10 years stuck his
hand in the mixing that and cut it off all right excellent well I'll teach him I
guess he won't be doing that again no I guess he won't so what's the problem well
the problem is that drug testing on the job is in many cases very important and
so if you smoke pot you shouldn't be doing it while you're working I mean maybe
if you're working in a job well wait a minute you said you shouldn't be doing it
while you're working but if it stays in your system for like up to a month
then how do you know what when you're doing it suppose you smoke it
recreationally on the weekend at home now when you're on a job well I don't know
very much about how long it stays in your system I just got through telling you
up to a month well that you're testing after lunch yeah that's right how about
booze testing after lunch let me tell you something about a breathalyzer test
after lunch well I don't I mean where do we stop this insanity is what I say
actually I really do believe that we have become insane with testing except that
in the case of drugs it is a very important thing in some situation I'm not
saying that we should be testing everybody for everything because we're
losing totally our rights in this country we don't have any rights in this
country we have a right to be oppressed by a fascist police state is what we
have I don't have any rights this is the free country it's a joke hey listen we
still have the right to talk to you about these things which makes it a right
yeah unfortunately we're limited as to what we can say you still got to watch
your language or the word police are going to come down and take you away
that's something else again I don't agree with that either I think if you want
to say foul things you can say them and that shouldn't be oppressed by
anybody and whether it's on the radio or TV or wherever but the point is that
there I don't know if you agree to this completely maybe impartially you
agree that there are certain situations where drug testing whether it be
marijuana or heroin or whatever is an important factor I would say if you're
working in a candy store then they definitely should be able to drug testing
you want something or in any kind of a restaurant they don't want you to
let's profits right don't let's shop that would be good one have a great day
sweetheart we have an open line indeed five six seven oh five sixty and five
sixty because God forbid if you smoke we'd like two weekends ago and you had a
beer for lunch today we know that you are a danger to society God forbid
pizza chef or delivery boys definitely yeah that's right Chinese food delivery
I don't tell a ways he would never and he didn't even have to smoke weed how
do you like that and he still had the munchies he was a hungry boy he was just a
big chubby hungry guy that's all and he ate all forty dollars worth of Chinese
food on the way back to the house can you imagine if they tested radio
management for alcohol after lunch oh yeah if they went up there right now oh
my God how about brain testing for management that sounds good to me of course
where there's no sense there's no feeling here's North Miami hello hello yes
sir yeah you're doing the great I have a question yes I have two questions and then
I want to say something about the far how come you can't get ice cream like
Italy here because I had a lot of pistachio I don't eat a lot of ice cream but man I
used to eat I eat it every day in Italy pistachio ice cream and a lot of
dessert gelato is not ice cream it's gelato it's made with it doesn't have a
lot of cream and it's not all at the chalk and artificial crap it's made
from all natural stuff and they don't make it here there's you know once in a
while a place to come along and try to make good gelato and even if it is good
the public's taste here are so bad because they're busy eating briers and
seals and eat ease that those places go out of business man I used to I mean
I don't I'm not an ice cream but I was eating it every day twice a day yeah
every little shop had it well when I go to Italy I eat it a lot and the ice cream
too hey I have a question for George you guys you have this commercial called
feet field extreme watches which is voice on it yes oh yeah he apologize
this profusely for it too and about let me ask you a question if this guy would
have been from Amsterdam or it's legal to smoke pot what were they gonna say to
the guy well you know it's interesting because I've married that now that is a
good point marijuana they were just saying on CNN that marijuana is not among
the substances listed at the Olympics as being illegal but that it reverts
back to the country and the laws there so if it were one of the Dutch players in
like a soccer player of course then I'll play no soccer in the winter or a
little bit but whatever the Dutch competitors are ice skater the event it would
not be a problem how do you like that in Canada says that's blatantly unfair in a
bunch of crap and they're a crying foul hey I don't think that's very fair how do
you like that I like them green apples huh those green apple I don't I say that
this guy this Grafciano or Greg Gabriotti what I say you should move to how Amsterdam
would be a good idea hey there you go at least you'd have a good time and as far as
drug testing in the workplace yes till they can figure out till they can drug
test you at the moment and know how much you've had at that particular moment I
think they should just band it all together because there's no way that you're
gonna tell me what I have to do in my house in my car or what I do at any time
that I'm not at work because I only work for them for eight hours not the rest of
my day so that's the bottom line next thing they're gonna be doing fish food
testing hey there you go yeah why don't we just survey and let's see uh let's
pay your fat I want you to pick a sea of much food you've been eating right
exactly I mean where do you draw the line you know I mean let me get a cute
tip and check this woman now maybe she's been giving moral sex to somebody in the
parking lot now you're talking okay have a great day pal okay sounds like a job
he wants I did that one time about 15 years old so anyway let's do a mobile in
West Palm Beach hello Neil can't disagree with you more about the pot smoky okay I'm
an ex pot addict from the age of 15 to 25 yeah I'm telling you I was more
dicting than coat than anything I mean we had to smart more dicking than fish food too I bet
correct George Martin is panting at the room better take a sample by the way before we thought
38 now I stopped 13 years ago but before we played baseball we smoked before we went to
movies to smoke yeah where we had sex we smoked before anything we need a pot we couldn't do
it without pot yeah a lot a lot of my friends are still well let me ask you this as much as I frowned
upon people who are like obsessed with pot because there are people who are juvenile and sit
around sifting and picking seeds all day and they think that's a life but nevertheless
no we have to wait wait a minute but how do you have this green stuff that had no season I mean
how did it affect your life it affected it tremendously because it opened the door to and you're
gonna think this is joke it opened the door to um coke it opened the door to be made yeah yeah
no once you violate your body so I guess you better never have a beer because next thing you're
gonna be I don't I never like beer but I'm telling you it affected me in the workplace it affected
me driving I had a lot of I know but but the argument that you know it's the same argument as you
better never have a beer because then you're gonna become an alcoholic and you're gonna start
drinking uh you know sticking vodka bottles in your pocket I mean there are there are always
going to people it'd be people no matter what you're talking about they're the alcohol stains of
the world are going to go out and eat until they get to be 500 pounds does that mean we should
outlaw any foods they're a fattening no no but I you know why I've changed I have two kids of my own
now and um they're 14 and 11 and they're getting to that age where um we're I remember when I
would say you better stop yeah yeah no no I I've stopped a long time ago but but I'm saying now
overprotective I feel like there's a bring in there's home I mean by Paris like George's there were
refugees from Cuba they came down here yeah well no humans don't smoke we know that they didn't know
any better they were working 14 hours a day I was alone at home and all my friends did it we did
and I'm telling you I didn't know but I couldn't disagree with you more I'm testing for it and I hope
they keep it out of everything because it's like my life you know something I know that when I go
over to Holland man every time I've only been in Amsterdam about 30 times I'm gonna go over there
it's a miracle that the country can function you know it I'm well let me tell you something um well
while we're on it we were less aggressive sure let me ask you have you ever ever been to Amsterdam
never been to I'm well get on a plane to go there you might learn something there's a pot addict
for you there boys and girls there's a good lesson for everybody he's obsessed like the fish food
addict I say we go to public right now I may enforce them to take it right out of the freezer container
because we have fish food addicts already and those people are going to kill themselves on that
crack because they're out of control and let's close down every bar because we got alcoholics
let's bring back pro-abitian baby let's prohibit everything then we got sex addicts just watch uh
what's his name Jerry Springer he'll do about 20 shows on that this week sex addict people who can't
get enough they're doing it the NBA they want to do drug testing we got a guy a Canadian the jock
if a snowboarder can wear a jock strap whatever the hell he was this guy may lose his gold medal
because he may have actually inhaled a little bit or may have actually smoked a little bit or
may have actually walked through a room somewhere where somebody may have smoked it or not as the case
maybe and they found like a little trace it is the court court yeah and they're having a nervous
breakdown now because you know suit a fat what else what else can we test for in your system definitely
have fish food testing because we know it makes your blood sugar go away up and you become
irresponsible and got only knows you're gonna you're not fit for driving I wouldn't be surprised
if they stop you at street corners now it's stop lights and they do on the spot checks blood sugar
tests you know they give you that little pin prick if I can say that and uh yeah look at my
fingertips man look at all those pin pricks that's right when you diabetic you have a lot of pin
pricks on the tips of your fingers but at any rate yeah they're gonna be starting to do that spot
checks and speed corners now and if your blood sugar is like over 250 but you're on straight
to jail you're on menace this society you're gonna kill somebody out there airline pilot before
you get on that plane make sure he didn't have no fish food before he took off here's the four
lotterdale hello yes sir uh first time color I guess I'd be in acute colors since uh I'm not chronic
okay but uh anyway I can throw myself a well-trained high precision cynic you agree with a lot of
the things that you talk about but in the United States of course uh what right we all have really
is the right to be as irresponsible as we want to be until you know you reach a certain limit
and we have these freedoms when people sort of they abuse them until it starts to cost
somebody some money somewhere and then they gotta go and do something about taking that freedom away
but uh well what does that mean when is marijuana ever been decriminalized in America uh well I
mean it hasn't but but the reasons for that for me they tried prohibition with booze nature
work real well didn't it no and everybody it's a part of your candidate real well we can't
expect our people to be responsible with the freedoms that they have like we have a small business
and uh we've got you know it's we do contracting and that sort of thing and and you got guys they're
not exactly the you know top model society but uh they go out and they're doing physical labor for
you and uh they're either climbing rooftops and things like that and we've had cases in the past
where people were on data for instance they get vaccinated and then the customer
all of you if you're liable for it I can understand and you're talking about a person right
I understand that and then not only that but the employee who's you too uh even though he was the
one who was irresponsible on the job so yeah so what do you do about that well in that case that's
an exception I wouldn't have any problem with that I I can see in the NBA where if a guy is
stone he's not gonna injure somebody on the court if anything you'll take fewer shots and he
probably wouldn't beat up the coach uh good point but uh the thing is we have something that we do
at work here not that it works but it's an attempt anyway that's called a drug free workplace
and you start off your relationship with the business under the assumption that you know you're
not gonna this isn't gonna be something you're to be doing on the job so we're allowed to drug test
before you start the job and up sort of thing and what's sad about this is it's amazing how many
people who call up looking for a job and you say oh but by the way this is a drug free workplace
how many people show up fill out the forms and then just never appear again
it's a huge amount but isn't that their choice you just got to go back really but you know
but the thing is if business is gonna be responsible for what its employees do then we have to know we
have to feel safe and secure that they're not gonna be out for a case of a job.
Yeah no I would agree with that I think that you got a you know you have a right because you're
liable and you have a right to make sure that they're not doing whatever might impair their senses
etc but that's a very rare exception if somebody's doing an office job at a desk unless of course
they're making decisions decisions that you know are like a national security risking something
like that. Yeah I can understand that. Or for radio equipment or something like that.
Exactly and I think it might help to have some drugs for these bastards over here.
But the thing is you know once again as a society if the people aren't gonna be responsible enough
to be able to like winter they are going to use the substances you can't expect to be.
But you know something you can't expect to be.
But you know something you can't expect to be.
Let me say something to you and that is that as long as things are forbidden when you go to
Europe there is no drinking age in any country that I know of in Europe and yet with Italy especially
public drunkenness is frowned upon to such an extent that I mean they would they would come and
beat the crap out of you if they found you staggering around drunk on the street they would take
you under cover somewhere and give you a lecture and sober you up and tell you better not
never do it again. Yes but you don't you don't have any problem of young people staggering around
drunk or killing each other because they're drinking and driving you don't have that.
Now the French habit because they got a bunch of drunks over there to begin with but I'm talking
about in countries where they're generally socially responsible in the first place like Italy and
like Holland and those you don't have that problem.
Yeah but there's no drinking age there's no small drinking age.
There's no small drinking age.
And from Spain and Russia have very high up a horizon rates and they also have
what does that have to do with Italy?
It doesn't but you know it's it's it's not.
What does that have to do with Holland which is the freest country in the world what does that have to do with it?
Depends on the culture they grow up with that kind of freedom and you want to be a hero.
They know that's what I just got to say and then so I wonder if you make things for bitten
the more people want them that's my point.
Okay before I leave or you cut off your coffee.
I want to give you something I don't know if you can use this as a card but I want to do a
celebrity impersonation for you.
Yeah.
Okay see it now that wasn't bad.
Georgia was almost cute it wasn't a very good yeah the consensus is let's see Mike from the
key says it's too expensive that's his well that's his opinion he likes a little weed now and they said to them expensive.
Here's Miami hello.
Neil yes sir.
What's up Neil I love your show.
Thank you so much.
Listen it is kind of expensive but I wanted to say this little marijuana thing is just out of hand.
I mean the government they must be some like babbling chimps pushing buttons from where they'll
realize that marijuana is probably the safest in toxicant on this planet.
It's less harmful than alcohol.
It has never been documented to give cancer like you know cigar and cigar which I'm not
complaining about cigar.
It doesn't tend to your blood sugar raising up like sugar does either but sugar I guarantee you
right now sugar is a lot more dangerous than marijuana ever can be and I don't think they did
any sugar testing on this Schmendor Gabbriotti guy at this snowboard that want to go metal over
their noggino.
Absolutely it's sugar.
Let's take his blood sugar and see if he was doing a fish food before he did the thing.
Absolutely and you know I like to go as too while I was listening to the idea I was wondering
how come you didn't like carcinan vagus I wanted to ask you that as well that's like my cigar.
Do you like carcinan vagus?
Oh you like them?
But it's they don't make them in nicks which is my sponsor so I'm not going to come on here
and say hey I smoke carcinan vagus.
Which ones do you like in particular the galantes?
You never had the English coronavirus?
Oh I don't touch those English ones.
Oh yeah the English coronavirus are fabulous especially if you're rolling your toe pin.
Oh okay um but thank you for having me.
Okay have a great day.
Let's go to Miami hello.
Neil.
Yes sir.
Hey how's it going?
Great.
Well listen you know a couple bad things unfortunately marijuana is classified as a schedule one drug
which means it's right up there with cocaine heroin,
methamphetamine and Jerry Springer is perhaps the worst drugs of all mankind.
Uh huh.
And fish food.
And fish food.
But you know this is just a word for that guy who was that guy of kidding when he there was a guy
he called and he said I run a workplace and I tell people that I drug test but I don't really
drug test and then that just sort of weathe out the pee part in mind the point.
I mean weathe out the people that really don't want to drug.
That's not what he said.
Well what was it?
What was I missed that whole thing about he said that he drug tested.
No he does drug test and he said that a lot of people come by and they fill out the
application when they find out it's a drug free workplace that they don't hear from them again
is what he said.
All right well I think he's a fascist because you know he's basically just got a bunch of people
that we're doing like yard work or something you know.
Anyway.
But they're going up on roofs and the things and he's responsible he's got the liability insurance
for that I can understand that.
I don't know man.
I mean if you're still looking if you're still on any substance I don't care what is
I don't want to be responsible for your work or driving or whatever else you're doing.
You know the thing is that they might not be up on the roof and be stoned at the same time.
They might go home, watch Jerry Springer and then be stoned and then go back to work and be
perfectly straight and still fail at miserable test.
Okay I think that shows on now.
What the hell was the point?
I wasn't going to wait around long enough to find out.
Here's a lady in Miami.
Hello.
Hello Neil.
Yes ma'am.
Hi how are you?
Great how you be doing.
I'd be doing fine.
All right.
I just wanted to make a comment about the pot head that called earlier that he's small for 10 years.
Yeah.
He said that the marijuana made him try other drugs.
I think that he's been betrayed as everyone else has been betrayed by all the uptight people
in this country because they tell you that marijuana be bad for you and it's evil and all this
stuff and then when you try it and it's not that bad you say well they lied about this
or maybe they lied about everything else too.
This poor guy's going to go back to Canada with his metal between his legs.
Never be the same again because they found this little teeny tiny trace of marriage wini in his
test.
Neil.
Yes.
I say we all get on a plane go to Italy and smoke a blunt.
All right.
All right.
See you.
The Pope is over there.
He's doing it.
If it's okay for the Pope how come I need so good.
Will you think that big puffer over the Vatican is?
That's not what you think it is.
That's the celebratory smoke.
Yeah.
They're celebrating it all right.
Why do you think they keep burning incense?
Covered up.
That's why they do a lot of things.
That's why they put those gowns on to cover it up.
That's why there were no skills in Scotland baby.
Covered up.
When it scores some pot.
Here's Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
I've never listened to your show before but I was
interested in your views on why it's illegal in the first place.
I mean is it all a conspiracy?
Sure because this is a repressive society in which we live.
Let me say it again.
These are KXotomy laws that are in the book and most dates in this country
in which anything except a face-to-face missionary position
sex between married male and female.
What you're laughing about it are okay.
All right.
True.
All these are KX laws on the books because this is a country of hypocrites.
A country that's living in the stone age because we got a bunch of old
funny duties up there who don't have the balls to repeal these RKX stupid
intrusive laws that have no place in the civilized society.
Well in marijuana case, hemp, whatever.
There would be no national debt if they would tax them and
grown it the last 20 years.
Well let me say this to you sir.
The idea that the federal government, listen to this.
The federal government can tell you what seed you can plant in the back yard of your home
on your property.
The idea that the government can legislate that is so outrageous and so
unacceptable as to be inexplicable.
I agree.
I can't argue with that one bit.
They've always helicopter wasted in time because people are growing a few plants
in their backyard.
In the meantime, up the corner, kids are shooting themselves because daddy left his six
his six shooter laying around and everybody in their brother in his
country is running around with a goddamn gun but God forbid if somebody's
growing a few plants in the backyard, we got the helicopters going overhead.
Baby, we're going to catch you.
The the pot police are there.
You maniacs.
Just like in a low where the hell I do with that.
Local section this morning.
Here we go.
Business man or sex per fair police this Arthur van Morke Kirk and whatever name is
Kirk in Jerkin.
Granted, a six million dollar prostitution ring.
How do you like that?
In Fort Lauderdale.
He had 50 women on their payroll.
Their names neatly lined up on a magnetic board under heading such as
blondes, brunettes and overyentals.
The clients more than 20,000 men between West Palm Beach and North Miami.
You'll pay $180 bucks and cash or 200 by credit card for acts that range from
straight sex to unusual fetishes.
So who the hell gives a crap?
Probably ran a clean operation.
Probably not too many people getting no diseases from that operation.
Probably headed on the up and up.
He's going to jail.
Everything in his goddamn country is illegal man.
Everything is the forbidden fruit if we can say on.
Of course that's so forget that.
Talk about a fruit.
Forget about that.
Everything's illegal.
Everything's immoral unless of course it's the politicians who are doing it.
Like Dan Roelmer, he's doing it over there.
And like Bill Clinton, of course, he's doing it left and right.
And which we like him a lot more and respect him because he's getting it.
That's okay.
But if we're getting it then of course it's evil and we all go to jail.
Chuvanal and unacceptable.
Unacceptable.
Your brainwashed baby when you're going to just wake up and sniff it a little bit.
And the flowers too.
Brainwashing.
Goody tushus.
We have to have a drinking age and we have to have a we have to have an age for everything.
A smoking age.
In other words when you're 21 it's okay to get yourself lung cancer.
But if you're 19 then you're not old enough to make that decision.
Just like this crap about the age of majority.
Every most countries, what it doesn't just the matter of opinion.
Most countries even some that we consider very backward.
The legal age for consensual sexual acts is 15 or 16.
In this country it's what?
17 for heterosexual acts and 18 for yes there's a different age for heterosexual or homosexual acts.
Of course.
Or is it 18 for both?
There's all of these gray areas depending on which state you're in.
I didn't say gay areas.
I said what's well we'll find out.
What state you're in lies in the prone or what does it do?
If you're more than two years older you can be 16 as long as the person isn't more than two years older and over.
Well it's an added credit.
So in other words if an 18 little guy is banging a 16 year old chick he's in violation of the laws that we were saying to me.
Something like that.
Isn't that ridiculous?
Yeah.
Isn't that absurd?
Here's a Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes sir.
Hey Grasmos.
Back to you happy sickest.
Yeah on the prostitution ring the guys from a broken out Fort Lauderdale.
No big deal.
Yeah there you go.
You're right.
Click enough for us.
Yeah you got it.
Another thing on the pot.
I own a business.
I drug test.
Right on the application.
He brings the drugs and I test.
All right.
Oh.
All right see you at the track back where we certainly know nothing about drugs.
There's your kind of boss George.
I thought we had that.
Oh yeah.
He wouldn't know what to do with him.
As in.
I think I'm going out.
Happy for him.
The frog got back and I think I want to kill what.
What is that back?
He's got me off going down to it's one.
I feel like crap.
It's time to 45 but it's doing 22.
Damn it I'm trapped.
So watch out frog because I'm coming after you.
I'm gonna.
Yeah I'm gonna run you down.
But yeah you're fed as I just found frog beating out is such a scary guy.
He's sick.
The waitress knows there's no tip tonight.
I hope he's good.
He doesn't speak French and the frog gets pissed.
Why is he sick?
But when the check comes we can read him list.
Boss Martin.
Yeah we know for the silly.
But do they have to be so cheap?
Why must you frog?
My baby all the way to Florida.
Go fast.
Go fast.
Why can't you just stop at south of the border?
Go fast.
We don't want you.
Well from the peaks to such a scary side.
Look at that.
So bellies doing over and the sandic cold side.
Wow are they fast?
I wish they'd just go fast.
I can't take it anymore.
What is summer coming?
Oh help them pack.
We're gonna grab and trust.
You know you know I was hanging a gluing around this country and
50 drabbing across the interstates.
And the staff are one of those stickyies or stuckies or whatever they're called.
Man talk about packed with glam with bad taste.
Although I do like some of that candy.
The peanut brittle is okay.
Never have a nut rule.
Yeah when it slipped out of my hand.
Didn't roll too far though.
Here's a coconut grove.
Hello.
There's no fags in Columbus.
Yeah that's what I hear.
Hey Neil do you remember a couple years ago maybe one or two.
A guy was driving down I-75.
He was depressed.
One of the commit suicide and he jumped into his pick up truck with a fixed pack.
Started driving down I-75 the wrong way.
Right I remember that.
Yeah sure do.
Stuff like that that makes me think.
I don't understand why alcohol is legal and my one is not.
Right.
I was saying I'm a smoker.
Good point.
Real quick.
I don't think how much we would have had to spoke for the same effect.
Think about it.
How long would it take?
Real quick Neil.
I heard a song about tongues.
Religious tongues, beginning tongues and I kind of gave me a flashback.
Yeah.
My mom used to be a penicostle and I grew up and I mean I remember seeing my grandmother
my my mom and just like talking in tongues and dropping on the floor and I would just
sit there and giggle.
You know I made no sense to me whatsoever.
Mm-hmm.
Anyway real quick Neil.
It's enough to get me the heebie-jeebies just to get me.
I thank you a song once.
It was for the panthers and all said through and I got to know the one.
Please let me sing it.
Okay go ahead.
Okay.
I'm Chris Weber.
I'm Chris Weber.
God arrested for a bag of red hair.
I'm the ghetto dream to play be brought without a drug screen.
I'm Chris Weber.
I'm Chris Weber.
Call time out when I got sprayed with pepper burn.
My eyes that's mean.
How about a couple drops of viseem.
I'm James Brown.
I'm James Brown.
Neil.
Yeah.
Uh, including.
There's no facts in the church.
Here's Mimey Springs.
Hello.
Yeah, hi.
No, I was calling because I heard the guy talking about the fact that it was legal and
it was legal.
But you know, I don't smoke marijuana.
I haven't done since college days.
But the thing is I'm a firm believer that as long as it doesn't kill you and you're
harming me, but he else go ahead and do what you want.
Let me ask you this.
Can you go into a drugstore right now and buy rat poison?
Yes, yes you can.
You can't.
And that will kill you.
And you know, it's got warning labels on the on the can or whatever you're buying it.
And you can go you can go into any story going to a supermarket, you go into a drugstore
and buy legally all kinds of substances that will kill you.
You can go into home depot and buy paint thinner.
And if you drink it, it will kill you.
I guarantee you that make no mistake about it.
So the idea that something may or may not be harmful for you, which is all very subjective
by the way.
And a lot of it very dubious and debatable.
But since when is that the only job that I see the government is to tell us, you know,
give us the information.
Tell us, can this be harmful to me?
How harmful is it?
And then let me make my own guide then the session.
Well, that's what I'm saying.
You know, the thing is that the only reason it was made illegal is because it's relatively
easy to grow and difficult to tax.
And by the lobbying of both alcohol and cigarettes, which it's, well alcohol is relatively
easy.
But the question of cigarettes, growing it, drying it out and actually making cigarettes
on your own, most people aren't going to do.
Whereas anybody could like grow plant in a backyard and they just simply take a few leaves,
let them dry out in the oven and then smoke it.
Oh my God.
And apparently that's what they don't want.
And there would be a lot of competition for those two other industries.
Oh my God.
Whereas in tobacco, that's proving beyond a shadow of a doubt.
That's killing people every day.
There are people puffing on faggots right now who are going to cook from lung cancer and
emphysema and we've warned them and we've warned them and we've had all those craggy voice
guys.
The guy that used to play Hamilton, Burger on Perry Mason, what the hell was his name
that I'm talking about?
I'm dying from lung cancer and John Wayne and all these other big macho guys that are
croaking.
And if you, you know, they tell you that and you still want to smoke, then go ahead.
Be my guest.
And enclosed.
Just don't blow it in my face.
That's what the monocle said.
They're puffing on cigarettes too.
Exactly.
Have a great day.
All right.
Okay.
What are we getting all worked up about?
Not just because we realize we live in a country where our freedoms are very limited and we
have a bunch of, we have a bunch of assholes sitting around deciding what you can do and
what you can't do and telling you what's good for you and what's not.
And then we have some idiots who are going along with that who want to be manipulated.
Well, if you want to be manipulated, okay, go to some fascist goddamn place.
Go to some communist to come.
If you go to Cuba for Christ's, go live with Adele.
He'll tell you what you can do and what you can't do.
Go live with the Pope.
You'll have one hell of a time there, man.
Go live in a Vatican under the watchful eye of the Cardinals, man.
I don't mean Stan Newsiel.
You won't be able to do anything that's fun because they're busy doing it.
Taking it all up themselves.
Then in chains, just the way I like them.
And then this morning I'm coming to work and I'm over there in plantation, which by the
way I'll get to plantation.
I would like to report right now that I believe that there's a chigger in the woodpile
and sin plantation and the call we had from the cop last week on the show.
And now we have this plantation, this big thing, this is step campaign starting today,
by the way, which I'll get into.
These selective enforcement, traffic enforcement programs, step as in step on this.
That call was from some porker over there in plantation is what it was all about because
this article in yesterday's paper, which I appreciate somebody bringing to my attention
by the way.
This is a carbon copy of that phone call we got last week.
They're trying to condition us to doing this and do it in a meantime.
I'll come back from the track last night and come west on sunrise Boulevard off the
turn bike as always.
And there are people I'm going.
It's 45 is the speed limit.
Okay, I'm going 50, 52, whatever.
It's a little bit over.
People are going by me as always 70, 75 miles an hour on sunrise Boulevard.
And I say you people need mental help, including you.
You're telling me that you were one of those people going 70 miles an hour on sunrise last
night.
Well, 65, 70.
I don't usually do 70 until I get a mental home mental help by the people.
You don't need, okay?
There's nobody else on the road.
Yeah, okay.
I don't run any red.
One of the one that the guy is talking about that wants to make it up as you go along.
There's nobody else on the road.
You're going to go 70 on a residential street.
That's nice.
We know that 400 just gets away from you.
Yeah, I know it's you.
I see that.
I'm lucky I only drive it in Corvette.
That can only go 155 miles an hour.
You've got that big, powerful 400.
I mean, I can't compare with that.
A lot of rumors about this station by the way.
We'll get into that.
So anyway, getting back to this thing.
Well, first of all, there's all these rumors before I get into the thing about the plantation
porkers.
There are massive rumors about this place being sold.
This radio station, or maybe I'm not sure if it's just this station or if it's a kiss
in the power 96 also, all three of them, the beastly properties.
And what we have to say to that is, oh my God, are we praying?
We got our legs crossed.
We got our eyes crossed.
We got our fingers crossed.
We got our nostrils crossed.
I'm even wearing a cross.
I'm rubbing my rosary beads right now.
I'm going to lay some to fill in and whatever else I can get my hands on.
Any kind of a we're going to rub the Buddha on the head?
Hey, listen, we'll get the leprechaun and the rub his head to a little bit.
We'll get some lucky goddamn charms.
This is what we'll do anything that might make that come true.
Oh, God, would that be something?
Hallelujah, set us free, please.
Whoever you are out there, the rumored buyers, which I don't want to say too much about
it because once these things start leaking out, you can screw it all up.
So I don't want to say too much, but the rumors are running rampant.
You don't think that's the reason that we're just kind of sitting here like in limbo, because
you know that nobody who's a real broadcaster in their right mind would be running this place
this way.
So maybe that's what really is in the wind here.
Not that I want to get anybody paranoid and psychotic that works for Beasley Reed.
Being such an upstanding company like they are.
Oh, man.
Any rate this ties in so directly, not that I'm paranoid, but it ties in so exactly with
that militant psychotic call that we had on this show last Friday or Thursday, I guess
it was Friday.
And it was in yesterday's scum sentinel right on the heels of that conversation.
Plantation where I just happened to live in half for many years now.
Plantations break, BRAK with tradition.
Police departments plan to halt motorists to ignore traffic laws.
I want you to listen to this because even if you don't live in plantation, this should
give you an idea of the mentality that we're dealing with here.
Motorists who drive through the city of plantation should be extra careful to obey the law this
month starting Tuesday, meaning today.
The plantation police department will clamp down on drivers who ignore speed limits, one
red lights, tailgate, don't wear seat belts, don't signal or otherwise break their rules
of the road.
Patrol officers in police cruisers and undercover vehicles will be armed with radar and ticket
books along all major roadways and school zones in the city.
Airvey driver they see, no, no, no, no, no.
Airvey driver they see breaking the law will get a warning.
Many will receive tickets starting today.
If you violate a traffic law, you're going to be stopped.
And police kept in the Keith Hylgenfeld who overseas the department's road patrol and
motorcycle officers.
The month long sting, dub the, no, a sting, it's a sting, they're stinging it.
You feel it, they're stinging it.
Dub the selective traffic enforcement program, STEP.
How clever is it aimed at discouraging careless driving and decreasing the city's high
accident rates.
Plantation log more than 3,000 motor vehicle accidents in 1997.
According to Sergeant Frank Rabina, of these more than 480 resulted in injuries.
We had 15 fatalities in 1996 and six last year, that is outrageous.
Hylgenfeld said, how do you like that?
He said not only was it unacceptable, it was absolutely outrageous.
That's what he said.
We have a problem and we intend to address that problem.
Rabino said far too high percentage of drivers choose to drive in any manner they desire.
Is this all starting to, I want you to listen to the verbiage here.
Far too high a percentage of drivers choose to drive in any manner they desire with a belief
that there was a low risk for enforcement.
In many cases, Hylgenfeld said the people who complain the loudest about terrible drivers
are the same ones who later get ticketed.
Police chief, C.E. Sonny Sherrod Jr. said the point is not to see how many tickets we
can write for revenue or statistics, but to educate.
The hope is that once people get used to driving safely along the city's major road, they
will maintain their good driving habits on smaller residential streets.
After netting violators for the next three to four weeks, police plan to reinstate the
program several times the year end of quote end of story.
If that doesn't sound like a carbon copy of the conversation we had with that militant
obnoxious, disgusting pork or out of Friday on the show, I mean almost word for word is
what it sounds like to me.
And of course it's only a coincidence because I happen to live in plantation.
And guess what, I'm not wearing those seatbelt.
I'm going on the year right here with that now today.
I am not wearing a seatbelt.
See that whole seatbelt law is like telling me what kind of toilet paper I have to wipe
my ass with.
It's none of your business.
What I'm doing inside that car unless it affects the way that I drive and by the way
wearing a seatbelt and I've tried it does affect the way that I drive.
But that's right.
That's right.
That's exactly correct.
And if they want, I'll get a note from my doctor and I'm very positive I have several
doctors who will be more than happy to write a note saying like an excuse from school because
I got a head cold today that I'm fat pig and I have diabetes and I have blood pressure
in this and that and whatever else and occasional hemorrhoids.
And as a result, I'm not wearing that seatbelt.
And if you guys don't have anything better to do in addition to which the last time I
checked pulling somebody over only for not wearing a seatbelt isn't legal in a state
of Florida.
You have to be violating some other traffic law before they can put you over for that is
the way I understand it.
Why could be wrong about that?
Now maybe we'll start pulling people over for passing on the right too like on sunrise.
Now I applaud.
I'm all for pulling over dangerous drivers.
People who are running red lights.
People who are running stop signs.
Not maybe like not make it a complete stop but people are running stop signs.
People speeding in school zone.
I'm coming this morning to work out here on a honey hill road and I'm slowing down
and I graded those lights haven't worked since we had the big storm a couple of weeks
ago.
But any jackass can see what those see those people with the straps or the orange straps
on standing on the corners helping the little kids across the street those traffic, whatever
they call them.
That means there's school in session and the signs says very clearly school zone 8 to
9 a.m.
And I'm coming here 25 to 9 or 29 this morning and I'm slowing down to my 15 miles and
I'm here this big.
Our sparts are in a big truck behind me and this guy is like practically pushing me because
he's so pissed off because I'm going 15 miles an hour right on the dot.
Well it's a school zone you asshole and there's people speeding through there.
I didn't see them again any tickets of course.
People go in 70 miles an hour on sunrise like I said 80 miles an hour on sunrise and
Broward Boulevard people running those lights that I've been talking about forever and of
course this business they're going to be equipped with radar and ticket books.
Well that sounds like more the same to me and if you have art you know why don't you
get the speed limit like on hiatus they're up to where they belong like 45 instead of
35 and then none of us would have who are in all responsible but have any problem with
that.
But it's very obvious to me that some of those speed limits are so artificially low so
that they can do what they've been doing for years.
Maybe that's why they have so many fatalities and so many accidents if they haven't been
doing a good job of getting the really dangerous drivers off the road and they're sitting
there with too many goddamn speed traps.
What a concept in plantation huh?
What a concept and sitting around by my house a couple of blocks away off the under of
trees under Malaluka trees waiting to see if all four wheels on your car came to a full
stop but it came to that stop sign and maybe some of those trees got trimmed back by the
way so you could see absolutely clear in every direction there.
Maybe that might be a little help too instead of having big branches of trees hanging
out in the middle of the street so you couldn't see somebody coming if you're like to
pen it on it at certain intersections.
But this sounds like a militant that sounds exactly like this porker that called here
and it was on a Broward line by the way and I'd be willing to bet a lot of money if I could
get my bed in which I doubt but it would be willing to bet a lot of money that it was
the same porkering that this whole thing is an offshoot of this show.
Wouldn't surprise the hell out of me.
We're going to show you you, Faggot.
We're going to show you a thing or two and we'll hang out there right in it and by the
way if you also want to help save some lives how about it's really nice the city of plantation
finally got that light up there at 118th Avenue and sunrise Boulevard but you know something
it's been up there for weeks and all it does is flash and flash it flashes yellow and
it flashes red.
That's all it does.
It doesn't change anything.
It's no different than it was before because there are stop signs on the north end of 118th
and the south end on both sides of that intersection.
So if you would put that light in the motion put it into a work and get it working and make
it a regular stop light would like a real red light would certainly help the control traffic
and also stop people trying to pull out of there and make a left turn and get and killed.
But I realize I understand we're pushing a little bit too hard.
You want to make us obedient.
It's not a case of writing business.
We want to make you obedient like the guy said we want to condition you to doing things
right.
Right.
Like you're going to condition dangerous drivers and trucking drivers into doing things
right.
Okay let's try Miramar.
Hello.
Yes sir.
All right you can go.
Oh my god.
That radio yesterday was bad.
I thought it was my radio.
Thank god it's only your signal.
Yeah.
It sounded like the radio.
What do you mean thank god it's only my signal is an accurate.
Anyway about the poor case situation.
I hope first on the list are these cops when they're off duty and in their private cars
that drive around.
No they're not.
Sir what are you wasting your time with it.
They're not going to be first on the list.
They're not going to be on the list.
They're not going to be on the list.
They're not going to be on the list.
You know that.
And their family members that just because they have one of those little badges on their
tag me that they can drive any way they want.
Well that's all part of that whole thing that that whole fraternal order of police business
and all that stuff you put on the bumper.
I mean if people really don't get stopped because they weren't that stuff that's one of
the biggest hoaxes in history mankind.
That asshole that called you last week is probably the cop of the list of the guys that
drive around and weave in between traffic and.
How do you know that?
Well because they're all like that these cops.
Yeah.
That's a good point.
They think they're above the law.
They can't force the law but they don't have to abide by it.
Okay have a great day pal.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Yeah.
Hi.
According to the law turned on January 1st that anyone that does not have seatbelt on
cookie pulled over without doing something else.
It just started this year.
Well it's an accurate.
Yeah because when I had to go to the trash can school back on January 7th and I thought
that point up and the guys are on that anymore January 1st.
They feel called without a seatbelt.
If you're caught without a seatbelt.
Yeah.
That one little petty thing.
Oh my god.
They got it.
They got it.
I'm going to go out and buy some shaman today because I don't think I got to write kind
of toilet paper in my house either.
There you go.
Thanks for the good news.
Any clothing?
Yes.
Can I shameless request?
Yeah.
They Japanese are called and Chinese.
Don't get the judge in the office.
The Chinese.
To the Chinese.
Don't get to put a chink in the arm with their will ya?
All right.
Okay I'll work on it thanks.
Oh.
Hey.
Ain't nothing like the real face.
Hey.
Ain't nothing like the real face.
Hey.
Ain't nothing like the real face.
Ain't nothing like the real face.
No, no.
No, no.
I've got your picture.
Just hangin' on the wall.
I was riding on the train to Austin, Texas.
Oh, when the fairy loved and laid her set next to mine.
When she got a treat, she asked me if I would hold her
first place.
I was more than happy to.
And now there's more I'd like to do.
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.
I want to whisper, we've nothing been so weird.
I want to hold her behind.
Close doors and more.
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.
When she returned, she said she was an actress.
She showed me an album, a picture of her opening.
When she danced, it's not.
She seemed to be sweet as she could be.
But I'm clearly seen.
She was the kind of girl who holds and hearts and right don't.
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.
I want to whisper, we've nothing been so weird.
I want to hold her behind.
Close doors and more.
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.
Well, I'll never forget the dream I've done to all of them.
We're sayers of sleep and we shared our tales.
But as my heart finds a lever behind, we're dressed our all I find.
Because I hope that you're said in the end.
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.
I want to whisper, we've nothing been so weird.
I want to hold her behind.
Close doors and more.
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.
There was once a time that all that long ago, a few years ago,
we couldn't play that on the other year.
It was one of our censored pieces of material.
What does that tell you?
And that leads right in, it's segues right in the facts, which is a new one.
We had the story yesterday in Texas about the T-shirt.
Another habitual T-shirt violator, this one in O'Cala.
Jury selection began Monday in the trial of a 24-year-old Florida man.
A trial.
They're having a trial over this, okay?
Charged with obscenity over a T-shirt featuring a bear-breasted nun
and calling Jesus a profane name.
How do you like that?
A bear-breasted nun?
Probably.
Sister Mary Catherine Jesus.
That sums it all up, I guess.
Record store clerk Andrew Love was wearing a different than a record store clerk
wearing a new T-shirt promoting the
cradle of filth in November.
When security offers at Nocala Shopping Mall told him to turn the garbage in
the back of the shirt, he said,
before he was able to reverse the police showed up, arrested him and confiscated the shirt.
The shirt shows a bear-breasted woman in a nun's habit reaching between her legs.
On the back are the words Jesus is a using the crude term for female genitalia, the C word.
Third Steve Rogers, no relation thank God, disagreed.
Love was never jailed on the mystery near charge, was released on his own reconnaissance.
If convicted, he could be fined $1,000 in sentence to a year in jail, along with all
those other habitual like pot smokers probably.
Florida law defines obscenity as something the average person believes would
appear the way perient, shameful or morbid interest, something is obscene if a
depicted or described sexual material in a patently offensive, oh here we go with this again,
and lacks serious literary artistic political scientific value, which means that
none of those postcards that they sell the damn stood in on street corners out in the public
would they be able to sell here of course, like the ones that has showed the
Pope sitting on the throne taking a dump.
In this community meaning O'Calla, the T-shirt is definitely political, said loves attorney Jim Reich.
He said the case had sparked an outcry from fans of cradle of filth, civil libertarians,
and those of the anarchistic bent. Reich argued loves arrest amounted to unlawful
prior restraint because police officers determined on their own that the T-shirt
was obscene. Mary and County Judge Sandra Edward Stevens rejected that argument
and opening statements were expected to start in the case two days.
Another habitual T-shirt violator. So don't give me no sign of an answer about
American First Amendment rights because we don't have any, that's what it boils down to.
We have the word police, we have the bumper sticker police, we have the word police,
now we got the goddamn T-shirt police. Remember in Hollywood not too many years ago
in Mayor of Galantia had the T-shirt police arresting young people in Hollywood beach.
First of all, why would young people want to be in Hollywood beach anyway with all the old
frogs? The number two they were wearing T-shirts that said disgusting things which
were like by the way appailed into insignificant compared to that one.
So there you go with some more good police work in America as the, you hear the
boots stopping all over the place baby. So those rumors must be right.
They must be planning on unloading this joint.
Of course you hear that. Oh, it's all over the place. I heard a rumor on the radio
just a little while ago that two AMs being sold. That's what I hear.
Oh my God, you listen, there is no way that I could convey to this audience how
desperately we, George and I, and many others, but now I'll speak for ourselves how we
pray that that's true.
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Yes? You got a restaurant for sale?
Uh-huh. How much you want for the salt? Well, you come over and look at it and
talk to the boss. I come over and maybe eat dinner with you.
Okay. Does a job price include all the walks? Huh? Huh? What?
What? What do you mean? Chinese.
Chinese. Okay. You come over to the
old town. To the town? To the town? To the town?
Two people. To the town? To the town? Huh? To the town?
To the town? To the town? To the town? Okay.
Okay. I'm going to go to the town. I come over and pick it up and look at
the town. Okay. Okay. What you have? Uh-uh. You know, you, you know, you
get to the town. Where are you? To the town. To the town.
To the town? To the town? To the town? To the town? To the town? To the town?
Huh? To the town? Okay. I'll be right there. Okay.
I'll be right there. Okay. I'll be right there. Okay.
I'll be right there. Okay. I'll be right there. Okay.
Okay. Okay. Here's a mobile and Hollywood. Hello?
Yep. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay. Hopefully I turn out better than the others.
Neil, you, um, you've been getting a lot of tickets like everybody else.
The speed traps and I just got three of them. I've been doing what?
Getting a lot of tickets. No, I have not. I haven't had a ticket in years.
Well, you talk about a lot of traps in the cobblestone. I talk about it a lot because I don't think
that that's law enforcement is having speed traps. That's not law enforcement.
I agree with you. I get them all the time. But what would you say if I gave you a suggestion
how you yourself could change the system? Yeah. If you would promote, because you
know it's different around the road and see a speed trap. Yeah.
And somebody in the opposite direction has the headlights on blinking and warning heads.
Right. Which is against the law, by the way. It is?
Uh-huh. How about just putting your headlights off?
Oh, that's okay. But if you would promote something like that.
I mean, it's against the law, but we all should be doing it.
I always have promoted that. He did.
And the cobblestone, the cobblestone, the cobblestone, will pull you over and give you a ticket for that too, by the way.
They get very pissed off if you do that.
What the hell is that broken though? Huh?
They just can't give you a ticket because they feel like a lot of data.
Well, who knows? I have no idea. Because you're screwing with their game, don't you understand?
They resent that. That's why they resent me because I've been talking for weeks now
about the silly stop sign police implantation and about the radar traps on hiatus road.
So now they're taking it out on me and now they're going to take it out on everybody else because they're pissed off over there.
Somebody peed in their coffee at the food spot, I guess.
Yeah.
For as long as I can remember on this show, we've done these pig reports where people call in and they tell us wherever there are speed traps.
We put it right on the air.
That's the best thing that I can do and we will continue doing it.
How would they be able to give you a ticket though, just putting a headlight on it?
You're asking me? Who knows?
All I know is that they do threaten, they have pulled people over, they make them psychotic because for whatever reason, they say that they're not supposed to do that.
Just like they say that you're supposed to wear a seatbelt and they say that you're not supposed to pick your nose with the index finger of your right hand.
Only your left. Have a great day, sir.
Put on my seatbelt yesterday when I left here for the first time in a long time just to see what it was like wearing a seatbelt. I don't like it.
I hate it. Very constricting.
It's very uncomfortable, but of course in this town since most people are, see, this is like a guy to call from Massachusetts yesterday about what Jerry Williams did on a radio years ago.
And he got the seatbelt law repealed and the federal government intimidated them and made him put it back in and we instate the law.
The government's got no business, sweetheart, telling you what to do inside your car.
Any more than they have to tell you what to do inside your house.
The only thing they can tell you what to do inside your house is you don't like beat up your pet or your kids or your wife or anybody else because that affects somebody else.
And just like the example I used yesterday, the government told you what kind of toilet paper you got to use or which hand to wipe with.
It's no different.
Oh, but it's for your safety. No, it's not for your safety. It's just another way that you give up freedom and let the government intrude where they have no business.
How about letting the government send inspectors to your house at night to see you who's doing what in the bedrooms, huh?
I don't see a hell of a lot of difference. It's none of their business.
It's insurance company bull crap. It's revenue raising bull crap and you cops and plantation. I got news for you.
I'm wearing my seatbelt. Aren't I?
I'm here. Yes, I am.
And I understand I wasn't even homeless. I understand there was a plantation porker parked right in the corner.
I pulled somebody over for a not coming to a full stop at the stop sign there right by my house right by the house.
What a coincidence. Doesn't phase me in the least.
And this obnoxious arrogant prick that called this show on Friday.
And I wouldn't be surprised if it's this hillgun felt guy because his quotes, you know, the more I read, I got this one little column from yesterday's to a Monday's paper.
And the more I like and there's one line in many cases, hillgun felt said the people who complain the loudest about terrible drivers are the same ones who later get ticketed.
Who could he be referring to?
Yeah, who is he referring to? The people who complain the loudest about bad drivers? Who is that?
You open your window. Do you hear anybody out there complaining?
Later get ticketed. See, I hate to break the news to you, Sergeant. Whatever your name is. Captain Sergeant, no time for Sergeant.
But I happen to be a damn good driver and a safe and responsible driver. And even though I got a car that will go very, very fast, I don't drive very, very fast.
And yes, I do resent when people go by me. There are a couple of things that really piss me off.
Number one, when I'm trying to go close to the speed limit and somebody is right on my ass.
Tailgating because they're trying to push me because I'm not going fast enough to suit them.
And if I'm speeding, if I'm going seven miles over the speed limit, they're right on my ass because I'm not going fast enough for them.
I'm not getting the ticket to make them happy, okay? Tough crap. If you want to pass me around two WL lines, go right ahead and take your chances, baby.
But I'm not speeding up to make you happy. And the other thing is when I'm going like 52 and a 45 on sunrise, and some asshole like George goes by me 75 miles an hour on sunrise, boulevard, that really grossed my ass.
I go with the flow. I was only going there. When I'm going, everybody else is on the road.
I'm going to be like 95 miles an hour and I never, ever see any of those people get it. It pisses me off because those people are a menace.
You people are crazy. And yes, you should be getting tickets, but the problem is they're not the ones who get the tickets, baby.
The ones who get the speeding tickets are the ones who get caught in all these little radar traps that we set up.
So don't give me a song at a dance about you're trying to save life. You're trying to condition people.
The drunks continue driving drunk and getting their licenses back and the chronic high speeders continue driving 85, 90, 100 miles an hour.
And you know it and I know it. So go freshen up the coffee at the food spot and plantation and cut the crap because you're not fooling me.
You're not fooling anybody else and your sure as hell not intimidated me, you can make as many phone calls through this show as you want.
Doesn't phase me in the least, but I'll be wearing my seatbelt. Slow down and plantation by the way.
You don't want to get no tickets and buckle up your seatbelt and make a full stop and sit there for about half an hour at the stop sign.
And guess what? They still don't have the light working at 118th Avenue in sunrise boulevard.
The light's still flashing there useless useless as teats on a caterpillar.
That's how worthwhile that light is there, but oh, we don't want to want to all these vitality.
Well, and how about getting that light working? Okay. And one thing I will say since I do a grid of credit where credit is doing.
See, one of the reasons they're ticked off the plantation cups is they had a great thing going there for months.
Even back when we were still on here in Paxon, remember I used to talk about that 30 mile an hour thing, the construction thing on sunrise.
And they would just sit there right in the bus. And really you had no way of knowing where it stopped or where it started.
That's one of the famous scams with construction zones.
Is you really can't be sure where it stops and where it ends?
And there was no reason for their most days to even days when there was no construction going on 30 miles an hour.
So they're upset because they finally did a great construction job there.
And you know, there was some inconvenience to those of us who live out there in West Broward, but you know something?
They did a hell of a job, the DOT or whoever it is that we really give anybody credit. They did a fine job.
And sunrise Boulevard now is a wide six lane highway out there all the way to where the arena is going to be.
It's a Mahaya man. Nice job guys. All they got to do is put the reflectors down. That'll be all done.
And fix that. Stoplight and make it work.
But that's one of the reasons that they got to do all this other business is because that was it. That was like shooting fish in a barrel man.
That was that was a piece of cake.
Who's going to be going 30 miles an hour on a four lane, a big four or five lane, whatever the hell it was at the time? Highway.
Especially on a road where George is going 70 miles an hour.
There's the one you want to get after is George Rodriguez. Okay. Are you plantation porkers and wherever else in sunrise you're driving? Where is it?
For Lauderdale, what part of sunrise?
Like university in sunrise.
Yeah, plantation. There you go. There is one for you in his beige Toyota four one or okay. He's going 70 miles an hour.
That's a few. What? It's desert.
It's it's a puse.
License number. Yeah.
Oh, yeah, never mind me. Yesterday I'm driving home on the after all is talking to trying to go about these cops and all this bull crap.
And I'm driving home on the turnpike. And here's an asshole in a green van.
And he's like in the I'm in the middle lane on the turnpike. He's in the left hand lane. He's about to go by me.
But of course he sees the car. Obviously he knows what it is. And now he hits the break and he sits out there and he kind of backs up.
And I like he's looking over my shoulder. Was I wearing my seatbelt?
No. No, I was not.
But I am wearing my seatbelt now.
I'm all you plantation porkers. I don't want to give you an easy target.
I want to invent a new product. It's just a sash. It looks like a seatbelt and you just put it on and sit down and it looks like that.
That's not a new product. Oh, it's not. They've already know it's not. Oh, sorry.
See what I call that. You know, when do I get one of those?
Yeah, you go and see there. Not only does he go 70 miles an hour on sunrise right in the middle of plantation there by university and his pusa desert doing the four runner.
We're also advocating violent while lawbreakers. He's the one not me. I'm the safe driver. He in fact rich.
Shard the two maniacs. There's a man it drives 90 miles an hour in the school zone. That's not fast to go. This man is out of control.
The fat man. Well, he's fat. He's got a heavy foot, which by the way, my foot is still killing me. I think I need acupuncture from that crack proctologist and those magnets that I talked about the first day.
I came back out of here. Here it's the end of February coming up now and the bottom of my right. He was still a no different. No change.
Not getting worse, not getting any better. Nothing in there. They x-rayed nothing in there. And of course that's great podiatrist over there. Cleveland Clinic. Nice chat with you pal.
Nice knowing that Jeff Clark is your brother-in-law, but nothing. Oh, yeah, when you got to do the stretching exercise and stretch this. Still the same. Maybe I can get an acupuncture risk to come in here and do you think so?
Do they do acupuncture on your foot? Well, yeah, I guess because your foot is like, you know, countless. It's hard. I mean, that's supposed to make a difference.
Really? It's not supposed to hurt. It's not supposed to hurt. Oh, I see. But it doesn't. It's not supposed to hurt when the plantation cops beat the crap out of you either next time you're going 70 miles an hour, but it will.
I think I'm going to start talking sports. Maybe we'll take a week and I'll just talk sports for one week and see if we can search for one caller that has any clue what they're talking about. Just amazing to me.
Just an ongoing just words just for me. It's baby crap. And that's the exact expression to use for baby crap like all these people calling in like this is something that's meaningful in anybody's life who showed up at the White House yesterday.
Not to the Iraqi ambassador show up to see if we're going to avoid a war over there. Not if the president's lawyer showed up to see if he's going to want to be in a pizza or not, but did all of the Marlins show up there at the White House here today? This is important.
Virginia.
