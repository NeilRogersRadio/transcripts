and he and it is.
But you're dressing too quickly. He has to feel it by wearing something under too. Put your way to fall
Every time he comes you can see his mask
He's gonna try to wipe it off so now he's gonna try to do the sound
He's gonna try to wipe it off so now he's gonna try to see the sound
He's gonna let go of the sound
Uncondu Treasury
Up
So what's the first word that comes to your mind when you hear a think of Dennis Rodman, huh?
Scumbags. I've said it the first word that comes to my mind two words three words one hyphenated low-life nigger
That's what comes to my mind. I'll tell you who else calls that category Bobby Brown
And his charming wife don't call me Ray Whitney Houston
Low-life scumbags. We got to have we got to start a show better producer show get down on here call America's favorite scumbags
Yeah, America loves scumbags
The lovable scumbags they just never go away. They're always in jail. They're always getting in the fifth fights out in public
They're always a drunken and disorderly
Then he's Rodman by the way crashed you have this party after the event
The big breeders cupping out their Gulfstream
Happier's horse than he said last the horse that's named after him
So yeah, just to show everybody they wasn't in a bad mood. He spent a hundred grand put on a big party
400 females were there by midnight
That he'll he'll monkey around as they know monkey around 50 guys in here with 400 chicks not bad
But the word apparently got out to the all around bad dude Dennis Rodman says Josie land beaten his son for it in starter column
Still reeling from Fridays the rest of the scuffle with occasional wife bitch Kram and electric the tattooed one managed to sneak into heath's party
The aging playboy's personal bodyguards however kept Dennis the medicine is too beautiful us gourds
Well separated from their boss
Heath didn't want to be seen anywhere near him a spy reported
Is not a shock? No, he didn't want to be seen anywhere. They want to be on the same planet with him
Much less in the same room much less photograph with this low-life scumbag
But there are there are certain percentage maybe it's I don't know is it the sports nerds because it's not only sports people
Bobby Brown he is not a sports nerd is it all no?
But there's a certain percentage of the public out there. They're enchanted. They're obsessed
They're in love with these people. I can't get enough of them
The scumma you're the better
Dennis Rodman scumma and not only that by the way, but of course that fag routine that he puts on is kind of irretaining to a lot of us as well
Especially those of us fangs
extraordinarily grotesque and irretaining unacceptable
That drag queen
Minsing bull crap whatever that is that he puts on you think it's an act. No, well, whatever it is
Now Bobby Brown's case. I'm sorry
Don't start about Bobby Brown. I wouldn't use it again because we've heard all those stories. Okay. Nobody wants to hear that again
Radiation poisoning do you see that thing on channel seven you didn't see it? I don't want to get you nervous on a Monday right out of the box. Okay
One more great reason not to be here in South Florida two more words turkey. What's the point
They did the thing with kids they did test in Jersey and New York State and also here in South Florida
On how much radiation was in kids teeth. I don't know what kind of people come up with the idea
Let's do a test on kids teeth and see who's got the most radiation
Kids in New York and Jersey that they have like any really amount of radiation in their teeth any no not much barely any
Maybe a little left from Hiroshima and Nagasaki maybe some of the underground testing kind of like leaked in their backyard something like that
But here in South Florida twice the rate
A very dangerous and high and unacceptable rate of radiation in the kids teeth
Which means also of course in our teeth and adults teeth
We're getting radiated. We're getting new to our getting fried
What we are and of course the fp all spokesman comes on here
It says well they've done these things before and it's been debunked by the scientists that were paying off on our side
Etc. That are in so on
There's nothing wrong with a little radiation and in fact all these people that do x-rays all the time doctors love to do x-rays
Dennis love to do x-rays because it's very expensive and they make probably like 99 and 9 10th percent on it
Or maybe 2000 percent who they'll notice
And every time you people subject yourself to x-rays you're getting that
Cancer I don't want to get anybody nervous. Okay cancer abundant here in this town not just skin cancer
But all kinds of cancer
Why we're getting mook for getting fried radiation poisoning from nuclear power plants
What when you get nervous? It's in them in what's the point? It's in your food. They're telling you with a food
And the government's worried about cigarettes
The government's worried about getting you to stop smoking because it causes cancer. That's right
Radiation poisoning you know who I think has a severe case of radiation poisoning maybe that explains his stupidity George W
There is truly one of the most frighteningly stupid people I have ever seen in my life
Not just that little mini quiz that the gave my believers of the
That general I don't know his name that the guy a guy took over while he was he there was a coup that guy that general
In Pakistan
Everybody is that guy well some guy you know some guy he's a moron and he's about 20 points ahead
He's gonna be your next president. He is a dumb man. Not just a dangerous man, but he's a dumb dumb man
George W the only reason that he's uh ahead of anybody don't reason that anybody's even considering voting for him
Besides the fact he's got about 60 million dollars in the coffers is because his name is George Bush
Oh, yeah, we know that name. He was the president once right? Didn't we uh vote him out in 92? Oh, yeah, he was the president
It's scary. I mean, this is truly a dumb and mean spirit in man too, by the way wise guy
Wise guy not as much of a wise guy is John McCain, but a real wise guy
With an attitude. Well, you guys are always trying to trick me up. Yeah, but I'm not playing that game
You guys some guy, uh, you know, took over over there
Yeah, some guy and what's that kind of China? Oh, yeah Lee. I don't know is the Lee can we leave one or hung Lee uh
Whatever his name is mr. Lee
And there people actually got a vote for this man. He is stupid. He's a moron. He's dangerous
How about that? What's his name? Damon he was
You mark my words now. They're all gonna be screaming. Okay, Danny. You were great, but hang it up now
We got to we got to champ now, baby. We got a shot
That's right, and we're gonna use it on Danny if you don't retire
Michael male already did today. He did. I didn't see his column. He already said that
Michael hold the male that asshole that who still hasn't apologized any apologizer. They've ever stabbed me at by the way
No
Has got the audacity to say that that marina want to hang it up because this kid managed to fake his way through a couple again
Hey, play pretty good last night
Of course the fact that the ball bounced right back up
It was hands at one time that didn't hurry you're when he got a fumble the ball that didn't hurt either
Hey, played pretty good, but right in the close to show you when everybody in this town. Oh, yeah
We got a new hero now. We want a couple of games against girls teams nonetheless, but nevertheless
I'd like to what's that kid's a McNair is that isn't in the quarterback for Tennessee
He couldn't win a high school game this kid. He couldn't win a fixed high school game. That's how embarrassing he is
Oh
Yeah, do you see those interceptions I could have caught those
Unbelievable, but that's the NFL for you baby. That's the national football league
mediocrity edits finest it's dynamite my favorite game yesterday was the Ravens and the Browns that was
beautiful
In fact, I might just go home and start watching replays of that all afternoon. I might just leave now
10 past 10 at 560 WQM
Wake up with the first key no
No
Only on sports radio 560 QA
On
I'm 15 at 5.60 WQM.
By the way Joe wants me to be sure to mention two 300 times this week that he's making his
prime time debut this Friday night between 6.8 pm.
Not just that real early Saturday morning kind of like warm-ups show before most of you
are awake.
6.10 pm?
Yeah that's right.
4 solid hours?
Me and the booster boy nothing like break it in big time 6 to 10 pm Friday the booster
and Joe Constella from homestead motor speedway the big Penn Zool 400.
All right let's hear it for the Penn Zool 400.
I'm the thing about auto racing unlike golf and I can't stand either one of them but auto
racing at least once in a while somebody gets killed you know whereas golf is I mean
just so boring even the spectators don't get killed like by an air and drive or something
nothing boring but auto racing at least once in a while somebody gets a
hit.
Meets his maker and that's what everybody of course is in the wood is waiting for Joe's
got a big smile on his face admitting of course that it can't say it I don't want you
to say it on here because that would be bad but it's true.
Anyway here's our center one total I bought him somebody called by the way just so Joe doesn't
feel so bad because he's taking it personally that's realized that it's Monday and he doesn't
realize that the whole town is in a deep funk as it lies week 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on
the 18 teal just a little line checker here okay just to make sure the phone systems are
working here before I go on all this other good stuff.
This is unbelievable are we on a year?
WQM line checker.
Oh there you go now hang up his mouth count WQM.
Hello yes sir I want to talk to Neil speaking.
Hey Neil how are you doing okay I just wanted to say this town does not deserve that
Marina I'm coming to work to then everybody's like oh did you see you are he's so good
yeah that Marina should hang it up I am just that's typical of this time man I am
grateful bastard they should only cloak I am just sick I mean you know I don't I don't
know it's just sick me I don't know what to do I'm thinking I'm just gonna pack it up
and back back in man just pack it just go back there there you go good luck now all right
there okay all I wanted to see if the phone was working I want to talk to anybody especially
somebody that he pressed in more roast right in the beginning of the week so you say
that Michael Mayo wrote that column today which I never read his column anymore if I can
help it because he's a moron and a backstab we're in a piece of crap I don't see it I see
Dave Joseph writing about the horse of the year yeah they had a big crowd out there this
weekend is one dead guy by the way which we'll talk about it all depends which newspaper
read Michael Mayo had a column this morning are you sure how are you?
really positive I think it was in the the other thing in what oh in the dolphins extra
thing well I certainly wouldn't read that because any of the folks pictures on here cured
made two big plays says any of the pope silly old man he must have naked pictures I
Hank you know what he's got to have because he's always sucking up there that was from
and Hank knows that he's a silly old man never wrote a column I made since in his life
he's a dodging old fool at either pope let's see Michael Mayo writes I'm a
reno the undergo MRI dolphins pay tribute to Walter Peyton he's dead defense could take
dolphins along ways is the silly Greg Kotech I think you're giving me a bunch of crappier
is what I think lower left hand side lower left hand side or what well fine huh yeah well
not in my paper I read it this morning David oh well first of all this is the herald anyway
oh you know something it's that separate sports section that's the one you're talking
about which I think that's the one I probably didn't bring that's right that's the one
I didn't bring you know something in my probably a premonition we'll get you on it's
the separate sun sentinel dolphin thing I figured well one dolphin extra thing is enough
because who they want to talk about that anyway let the sports there talk about that I
don't want to talk about that Michael Mayo you should only croak okay very rarely say
that I'll only say that about you and screw in those are the only two people I would go
and dance on your graves if something horrendous happened to you and maybe it will very soon
see a guy to me that calls the show you're in a half ago and lies to me in the audience just
brazenly the way that Michael Mayo did and promises to apologize to Dave Helberstin who eventually
did get fired by the heat and well it only is married into a his wife's got a lot of money
nice going there David don't be trusted exactly please but you just have no class Mike
Mayo you're perfect to this town you're like my good friend Tom jicke you know Tom I know
you mean well I know you're on my side Tom but why you're so dumb you know why why you're
just so dumb did your brains fall out with your hair too didn't happen to me I'll get into the
whole thing but I'll get into it in a minute but but you know don't you know that Brooke Daniels
isn't on wiod yeah her producer was suspended then fired by wiod 610 for failing to bleep when she
said the effort on here she doesn't she's not on on wiod I did make a difference he still got no
number but I mean at least if you're gonna be supposed to be writing about radio TV Tom in a
major market god their newspaper in a highly prestigious Sunday book get it right Tom can you do
it oh Jesus Christ this town man it's a joke it's a freaking joke what am I getting excited about
I'm you know I'm excited about that I can talk this week I probably got because my doctor gave me
some antibiotics nice going doc of course did he take a urine test no no he wanted to take a
chest X reinstead did I take the chest X grade no more X raised you people out there unless it's
absolutely necessary they're nooking you they're frying you let me give you kids out there
an example of what happens take something and stick it in the microwave like maybe your cat
and take a look at him after about three minutes on a high take a look at the mess you got in there okay
that's what they're doing to you with this radiation they're nooking us and we can't figure
out what is this epidemic of cancer coming from we got liver cancer and colon cancer and we got
cancer kidney cancer cancer of every organ that's ever been invented testicular cancer speaking of
organ yeah we got cancer up the or we can't figure it out they're killer fri in us I know we don't
want to hear this because it's not a goddamn thing we can do about it we can't go down to a
turkey point and tell them to shut it off because then you'll be sitting in the dark
that's what they're doing they're radiating us to death I just want to go on record to say
that I've for once I believe something I saw on channel seven doesn't happen very often but there's
the one time this year here's our facts from Carol at center one our total so far 41,242 bucks after
a very disastrous start I mean there's so many components that that disastrous start between
that the CD is getting screwed up and a golf tournament which are we don't want to mention about
oh Jay we eventually will this morning 41,242 dollars and of course you can get your best
of niel CDs and cassettes at all the spec stores all over town and over in four miles on a
west coast it's specs and in is it coconuts and napoles I think the guy said yes and of course
will be at the specs in the gables this Saturday noon to two that's on somethings you have a
recross from you of them with all of our stuff including the prestigious buttons what till I do
my button every time I bring one of these in here somebody steals it or borrows their bags oh I
got to have on it yeah and then I give it to like Mark Hypnick but at least he paid for a nice
go and maybe there's one of the few people he has nothing to do with this show that Mark Hypnick
who was a real nerd at IOD but he comes over here and seems like a pretty good guy compared to those
losers that we have that mural on the wall over there including that bitch screw in that should only
poke and by the way the shirt you gave me screw in it's sitting over here on a on a cabinet with a
purple tinky tinky winky with a head supposed to be that's as close as I'm ever going to get to
wear an ed thing I wouldn't touch it with your hands phony phony bitch that's still stealing my
life spots by the way I you're not fooling anybody screw in but you know something who cares like
the old look you weigh in my motto I don't care I don't do whatever you want steal all the spots I
don't give a crap Greg Reed is still paying for it what do you care playing games down there again
on the second floor and our general manager is walking around with his hand his head very deep in
his head he's still can't finger it out God I mean how much self respect can you have when you work
for dumb people you know unless they're paying you a lot of money thank god for that that's the only
reason but I can possibly squeeze through so anyway here's a man speaking of the median how accurate
they are they had that big weekend of gulps in this only one problem one guy is dead now if you
read the sun sentinel talking about reading certain things in a paper and by the way I don't see
that Michael Mayo column come racing in here from anybody in the building when two thinking a
real radio station somebody come racing in here with that dolphin extra style from the sun sentinel
I've never worked anywhere but here oh so like I said you've never seen a real radio station no
so in a local section of the sun sentinel here's this article racing devotees fall a track fatal
about Jonathan Piri Lane this is the most glowing article he was if you needed help at the track he
was your man and what a great guy he was and he was always around to help and people and his family
from Ontario and he grew up near a racetrack as whole biography or what a great guy he was
and it's just they're still trying to figure out in the sun sentinel how it is that he fell
through this thing and crash landed and the grandstand and the died although with this say there was
some evidence Lane might have been intoxicated when he fell police said but the incident still under
investigation that's kind of a throwaway line in there now if you read the herald article on the same
story man falls to his death at races police investigate circumstances friend said he spent
that a watching the races and drinking alcohol he was drunk said his friend Bruce Jacoubrek whatever
to hell his name is a friend and clocker who works for equabase a company that provides race data
he was drunk he had been in the bag all day also it says he was wearing a press pass during the NBC
logo even though he wasn't in title to have one which gave him access to the press box and most
other is the track which is why he was able to go up there into that alcoe like an attic that sandwich
between the tracks roof and the grandstand overhang and oops he fell down and oops he's dead so there's
exactly the same story for all you people that believe in Jesus and all you people that are worried
about those guys they want to call it with a holes in the hands of the uh what do they call that
i saw the thing about this more what's it even that new movie that's out about the uh come on come on
mr catholic mr Italian Catholic what do they call that you know the name i'm looking for
i had a big model that's what it is it just see i have to rely my own sources because you're not a very
good brainwash Catholic what the hell is that stig moda what kind of a catholic are you for Christ's
good kind yeah stig moda with a holes in the hands it's the the name of that movie so another
had got a big saw so if you believe in that crap okay then you'll also believe that somebody's got
to write answer on the story but do we know which one no happened Saturday do we really have the
uh no see there you go and who killed cock robin by the way 1026 at five sixty wq only one south Florida
radio station has the had the door of listening to it and go for weekday afternoon to two sports
radio five sixty q a f it theaters now from the director of the six cents it's the eight cents
yeah me too my putting taste like Ellen's fun well my top-tier tastes like spub hall please
not said yet i know but it still tastes like him though the eight cents showing up
oh my popcorn tastes like tamila leaves old in plan whoa let me have some
that's thirty one at five sixty wq i'm not say you can nitpick i mean you can find fault or find
mistakes with anything but it's just amazing that both of our daily newspapers make so many glaring
mistakes not just little teeny tiny mistakes and when you're dealing with millions of words on
the printed page sure there can be a little mistake here the odd mistake here for example
michael meos column which uh Eric uh from morland or fax our new our guy our website guy
Eric with a great job he factored the thing already and it's uh the date on it says on the internet
november 9th 1999 the only problem with that is tomorrow is november 9th that's the only problem
Michael hold the man oh maybe you have a chance to reconsider the column between now and tomorrow
but anyway here's the front page of the sun sentinel here's a picture of Sam Addison three big
interceptions last night like i said my grandma could occur to the three right in his hands
and it says it shows him a do a little bit of that the jukin and jyve and niggery stuff that
these guys do when they you know make a big play hey look at me i'm strutting out the nigger but
anyway it says cornerback sam Addison of the dolphin celebrates his third quarter interception
return for a touchdown during the teams right off the tide that did he return any of those
interceptions for a touchdown no no no let me say it again he celebrates returning his third
quarter interception for a touchdown did he return any score a touchdown no no no no you as
holds you at the sun sentinel right on the front page oh god give me strength to continue in
this so imperfect pound i mean everybody has false even i once in a great while might do a bad
vn that's right but jesus christ i mean you know you're looking for something that's right just once
and by the way what about pavel burry and that little pinky finger huh he wanted to play
their advanced cover he wanted to play oh yeah and he now know the doctor said now you're
gonna be out a couple of weeks he wanted to play he wanted to get in there and the terry marisa
were worried about infection i think you got to be worried about a brain infection terry i think
it runs in your family if you know what i'm saying i i don't know about you but i'm getting a little
bit tired of this whole routine i mean i hate to say that but i'm getting a little bit impatient
would be the word impatient i mean call it bad luck call it whatever you want but i'm getting a
little bit impatient and you know something you know when the real test is going to come very soon
Wednesday night now thursday's an national holiday am i correct about that thursday's veterans day
as he turns around and says that thursday's veterans day it's the eleventh
he used to be used to call it armistice day now it's veterans day because nobody can say what
armate can spell it nobody knows what that means armistice day so it's a veterans day and it's
an actual holiday so i would assume the kids have off from school on thursday we'll find out
about that from some pain in the ass parent out there but i would assume that's the case
and there are probably a lot of people like people who work for the state and so on it won't be
working on through them i know that for a fact so what would be the exclusive going to a great
hockey game wins then at the macarena well let me give you a list of several thousand reasons why
most people will not show up a it's the Atlanta thrashers are going to be the opposition
anybody know who they are no no anybody care about them no are they like a big draw no and be
povelle bruay will not be playing the big black spartan named peter will not be playing
there's only 75,000 in fact you know what they ought to be given away tickets out on the street
corner right now also it's qam producer night at the oh that's another good there'll be plenty
album or my forgot about that come on we can wave to kneel but we got to scratch that off the
memo because somebody for a little caricature of the give me head there on the damn thing that's right
so we got so he rewrites the memo seriously i want to tell you right now i've met a lot of
pussies in my life i have never in my life come close to meeting a pussy like bluff lunzy he is
the biggest pussy in the world which is you know i mean everybody's got to be the best at this
but he is the champion pussy in the world is bluff lunzy i mean somebody writes a little
snotty thing on there and he just made a passing reference you know you guys are what's a free
me for the producers uh we'll have food and booze and whatever will wave to kneel because it's
a hockey game i'll be there okay so he puts that in there and right away the morning guys there
who hate me like but we have to hate jealous jealous jealous petty and jealous little silly people
like uh donnie b for example jealous our puss or maybe it was Robert greeper i don't think
Robert knows about anal sex i mean orals either one he doesn't know about those things he would be
drawn pictures was it anal or was it oral it was vandal always the mother's in that picture
act don't think i look at it again stay the hell away from me duff but at any rate
no seriously i mean what what kind of a a bunch of crappers that somebody writes a little character
i think so he takes the not only takes it off the door but he rewrites the memo based on whatever
they told him without my name and now we've got a new if we got a new and improved copy the
memo up there in a wall that has taken my name out we will not be waving it kneel it still says
wave at kneel oh no see that's one of the old originally better save that that might be worth
lots someday in our collection of bluffs memos oh my god pussy pussy pussy pussy so here's
Michael mayo column thank you Eric by the way kneelwriters dot com is a website off which you
can order all the center one stuff by the way and also see a lot of good stuff and Eric does a great
job and is right on top of things i mean i had barely mentioned the Michael mayo thing and here
it's coming over the facts machine life after marino looking good says uh Michael hold the mayo
you know Michael mayo he's an asshole but we know that and i'm even gonna waste my time with
any of the rest just the last paragraph what all this does is give marino a little margin for error
when he returns before the prospect of johnson pulling him if he stumbled seemed like half-baked bluff
but now after seeing what we've seen the last month it doesn't seem like heresy or lunacy
he's already dancing on his grave he's already just waiting rubbing his hands together waiting for
Danny to go back in there and start fumbling and stumbling and bumbling and throw maybe one bad
pass or maybe fart the wrong flavor or something like that all the time to get him out of there he's
all he's all he's washed up let's get dead damon in there whatever hell his name is damon you're
let's get him in there and by the way it's dated november 9th on here on the internet Michael mayo
in other words uh maybe it's not coming out till tomorrow even though it was in the paper today
maybe he'd like to have overnight to reconsider this uh huh and not put this swill in the paper
it's a girls league anyway what difference does it make it's a girls league you see that
chip shot field world got block green bay in the bears yesterday at the end of the game see when
you had the NFL package like that you see the highlights because there are no good games
except of course for the ravens and the browns oh that's my favorite what a matchup that was
you know something you could go to any sand lot in town and see kids heave it a ball around you
know for for free and see better entertainment than that the ravens and the brown
should to say that those are girls teams will be to insult the uh females of america
that it would be a stripe in the place
and let's see the uh the Rams and uh not yeah the samueless Rams and Detroit lines that's
your not to be a pretty good game nice going there teach right
out that's her not to be okay but basically you go up and down you're back and forth on all
those channels and uh Caroline and Philadelphia remember i was it last week was the eagle game
that the dolphin just barely hung on by the uh two weeks ago that just barely barely squeaked on by
and the eagles like i said they're not even like a little league team they're not even a little
league team so anyway getting back to wins the night it could be grim come on out to the macarena
because i don't want to be sitting there alone just sucking my thumb okay
but you have to start wondering you panagai eight million dollars
he's played eight games so far in fact out of the total number of games that they've played since
he's been here the number of total games he's played is very very minimal at best and embarrassing
at worst pop love let's get with it let's tape that thing up and uh you know suck it up like a man
bob bond scores the winning goal and overtime in nineteen fifty seven in the stand the cup playoffs
on a broken ankle for the Toronto Maple Leafs nice going there Bobby Bob on a broken ankle
this guy's got a little picky that's a broken he's got a broken picky he's out for two weeks
what's going to happen if somebody kicks him in the rectum or month easy
maybe two months if he gets a bruised rectum for last year i had a bruised rectum oh it's no fun
boys and girls and didn't happen the way you think either but nevertheless yeah what's going to
happen if pop else you get a bruised rectum oh six months easy put his ass on the shelf let it heal up
we're waiting we're getting impatient pop love we're getting really really impatient all ten of us
real fans out there the rest of the people that show up they don't really care because they don't
know who you are anyway all those drunks just like this guy who had a fall through the roof
bill stream the other day why because he was out there who was in it up all day just like the people
that go to the tailgate parties three four hours before the guy named game starts so by the
tando game so last night can you imagine can you be or were you there that's right you got my
tickets and were there any drunks in there not in my section but elsewhere what else were I had the

twenty before eleven at five fifty wqn and camp when knows the story
turning it down so the last team ends weeknight only on sports radio five fifty two
eight out okay fucking bow tonight on cbs the new fall season kicks off with an all new show
from the creators of two guys who girls in a van comes what's that smell the hilarious
misadventures of two janitors working in a retirement home to be Arthur Conrad

full question they do all old people really smell like that ten forty five at five sixty
wqm and by the way there's another paragraph which I didn't realize that Eric Faxman the third page
he would is no longer on proven he can actually be trusted maybe that makes marinos days a little
more uncomfortable says the anxious michael me oh he's an asshole but for the team as a whole the
prospect of life without him now seems much more imaginable even dare we say winnable
yeah maybe and maybe not anybody think that the uh dolphins would have won that colds game
with the heward playing quarterback no no chance out of chance in hell and by the way that was the
game where marino got injured in that game on the third downplay where he got just absolutely
wall of just creamed and pulled himself back up there and through the touchdown past the winnable
the fourth downplay after getting creamed and getting injured unlike certain hockey players that
are making eight million dollars a year they get a broken pinky finger and they're out for another two
weeks here's a mobile in Miami hello you yes sir wow and I hope for a walk hey I'm from a west
chest or seven time in day the every morning so I've been able to hear you for a long time
but uh what did you talk to you about a couple of things uh the first thing about the dolphins
with marino anybody who says that is just a pure asshole I'm gonna talk about that because that's
the sports geek right so I work at the airport in Miami yes and that's been a one of the ramp
ramps are you yeah I'm one of the ramps and I wear the badge pretty proudly boy yeah you know
according to that seems like a real hot place these days have you read the new times lately no
did you talk about that no no you get through to pace 25 in the new times I don't have it
what about what is it about it's more a cargo craft oh cargo craft yeah it's more you know
wrap wrap wrap severing heads and cutting people's hands off and putting them in concrete boxes
mm things like that sounds tasty yeah maybe I'll write in the right drawer my next flight
true I was reading the hell today I didn't know if you get it they had a free spot for club
Madonna in the local section did you get that no he did not like a whole article on club Madonna
yeah I'm strippers and so I bet you they had the right information too unlike us they can't
if you get the right information in the spot because our sales department blows well you know I mean
they only run those uh those stripper ads during the week they don't run it on the God's day
yes they do they don't run it on Sunday they don't run it on Sunday they don't run it on

poked my hand with the knife huh maybe that's what happened to Colin Ron maybe that was the stigmata
happened again and it instead on their hand it like was you know God messed up and it happened
on their neck instead huh you don't know the stigmata that's the thing where these guys it's
happened very rarely in history and only to a couple of like cardinals and I think maybe a couple
of Milwaukee Brewers had it too where they get holes in their hand and they start bleeding because
that's part of the SNM religion of Christianity you do realize you understand that is the fact that
he had to get nailed up there on the cross with nails in the hands ooh sounds real nice
and of course then when you drink the wine it's the blood of Jesus the blood of Christ a lot of
blood you know human sacrifice animal sacrifice and a lot of blood and so that's what the stigmata
is all about and the church as well we look at these things a little skeptically and we have
improvement in the ad but I beat but I will but yeah it's a miracle it's like the meriburge and
meriburge in Mary appearing on those two tennis pieces all the time happens all the time
pop on in the oven and little bonus there's the virgin Mary no extra chart they have to start
promoting that on the box that's right to teenos it's the only pizza in the world that brings you

two weeks then of course I'll be on vacation so we push it back again that's the way they operate
here just keep postponing the inevitable because it keeps the bill weighed down
here's pop it'll be chill out on the on the show
one thing really bothered me I know you don't you get into politics that the
was governor bush I wasn't so much that he got your trapped in the questions when he answered
about Pakistan that a general nother off is giving stability to the country I mean that's
like saying that's the leaning up to a no over we elected government before this
did you know that we're through the media to add a bond and you know and so that's scary that
here's a country that has nuclear war doesn't always answer anybody's talking about right and so
nobody seems to care okay the public is not public is stupid the public doesn't have any idea
what it's all about the public doesn't have any of it even the press they don't have any idea
that Pakistan is on the map sir that's right well that was the point that the press should have
really gone after him I mean you know uh... and it broadly feel that the questions what do you mean go
after all these guys get a free ride they're not going after anybody they all get the only guy
that went after was just even true of because he said things that are politically incorrect and so
after all they're expected to go after them and say hey here's a radical atheist piece of crap
and they went after him well it's right you don't know that somebody that he knows that there's
a nuclear power out there and he doesn't know that and these guys he thinks the country's
under stability because it was a military coup yeah and uh... and i'm not only that but his
his arrogance his uh... smart aliki that's right some guy some guy that's a kind of
pretty good and they're gonna have some guy some general uh... and when they ask him about
Taiwan he said uh... i think his name is Lee well that's a good shot yeah uh... i mean uh...
or then he said well either one of them low something like that or ten yeah and so uh
i think they got about the hair of his chinny chin chin okay have a rate they found conda
too emotional not gonna change american public baby because one thing we got in common
we're dumb or fat and we're dumb and that's the way we like it five six seven oh five sixty

Vatican introducing new Catholic life the religion with one third the guilt of your regular faith
new Catholic life satisfies your need for Christianity but it doesn't fill you up with a lot of doctrine
Catholic life there's no confessions no sermons and no lingering afterlife it's the perfect alternative

column question and i know Tom makes these up there's no doubt in my mind have you heard anything
on brook daniel's producer manic Larry being suspended maybe even fired after brook uttered the
f-word and he failed to dump it or anything on wqa m's oj fiasco and the suspensions that followed
sg via email allegedly says tom allegedly tom writes my colleague josey uh Jose josey whatever
his name is lamb beat had several items on both controversies yeah you're a colleague because
he's the one that writes about radio which you're supposed to be doing tom radio and tv but josey's
the one that's owns the radio over there to sunsend and a proof is in the next dissentence
manic Larry full name Larry Buckley was suspended then fired by wiod am six ten
is that correct no no no then fired by wiod am six ten no no
rotating between up brook daniel's message meanwhile she remains on the air don't blame ratings
in this case she has many how do you like that for a little dig there brook he says don't blame
your ratings because you don't have any pretty much the same situation pertains to wqa m where
promotions director sam duke took the fall for the hostility generated by oj is apparently well
compensated appearance at a charity golf tournament the superior here comes the best part where
tom redeems himself for screwing up on what station at bitch work so the superiors who signed off
on bringing in oj and then alerted the media to get maximum publicity for the station
skated of such episodes are revolutions spawned says tom jica
how do you like that of such episodes are revolutions spawned do we have a revolution going on
here no are we gonna have one no but that's an interesting thought Tom let's have a god damn
revolutionic you wait yeah let's all walk out come on i'll be first and i'll look over my shoulder
anybody following no no like i said i think i changed my mind very quick and very silent and very
short revolution here's hollywood hello hollywood ill yes sir how you doing okay have some

you are so beautiful going on and they know on people with injuries and what hard right and then
i'm looking in the last shot that they show is Ronnie lot and he's got his hand up on his face and
the first thought i forgot what his injury was and then the second time i look and i remember

girls league that's not even hockey there's something wrong here man when you see when if you know

a mistake and they're going to put it back in their force and to go back in their will allow them

excit point
they

You
You have a brand new style
To
Me love the way you
With the big city on your chest
And the group tonight
Just a banding girl in the middle of a crowd
Who's with the speed of a gazelle
And the bad guy straight to hell
With a building
For two
You're a cheap girl
With a building
And it calls in that
Zikata yet on its
Helping things
1132 and 560 WQM
That the New York Times
Spot was kind of interesting
You're not really fat
It's just that your self-images got a problem
Look at what it is
Just think about it and you'll be skinny by midnight
My son looking down here
I'm looking down
Actually a big, big roll of
Fat
Yeah that's myself
Although I will say this
When I was in Sarasota in 1973
I reached an all-time high 266 pounds
Yeah
Oh I was just enormous
266
And you know something I never paid any attention
In other words people
I don't know if it was just me or maybe all really, really enormous obese people
They just are oblivious to it
And maybe when we get older like more in recent years
I look at me and I go
Oh yeah, Jesus Christ
Yeah
In the morning you have to step out of the shower
Start naked as a jabird
And you're looking at me and you go
AHHHHH
But I guess back in those days
Maybe I just didn't have a big mirror
That's a good idea for all you fat people out there
Just don't have a big mirror in the back room or anyplace else
Do you like Dracula?
Just break all the mirrors
Yeah somebody hands you a mirror
Just smash it, say oh no
Not for me, I can't have a thing
It's called a pupic, a big gigantic
It must be
Because I see some of these people who
I mean just candy they waddle
They can barely even move
You know the ones I'm talking about
Like at the hockey games
And you wonder how in the world could anybody get a huge fat ass like that
In one of those teeny little skinny seats
Maybe they just have a self-immons problem
If they were just sitting think about, meditate
We'll find out at Producer Night
Here's Fort Myers, hello
Fort Myers
Yeah, hi Neil, hi, I can tell you
Okay, sir
Hey listen, I'm a fat guy and believe me
I got no mirrors in my house
Good, my house
First of all
Yes
Yes, sir
Oh, okay
Never mind
Bye
So it was on the floor
I'm on my hands and knees ready to
Say a prayer ready to rub my rosary beads
Ready to do a stigmata on my wrist
On the palm of my hands
It's going to be like this again this week
It's part of that birthday celebrate
It's part of that ongoing yearly thing
Like a curse, it's the curse of nails
What it is
I told you last week and it's the truth every year at this time
It's like a living hell, it's like a walking living and breathing out
This guy calls, we're paying for the line
This is our famous auto-tomel that I screamed
And I howard and I carried on like a lunatic
We're on a year and four Myers for Christ's sake
Plus we got all these people on the internet
But at least for Christ's sake for Fort Myers
And how about Palm Beach
And so here's a guy calls from Fort Myers
He gets on the air like
Oh, never mind
And then
That time
That evil sound
Yeah
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8
Like I said before
Today is the 8th when they will be the 10th
It's payday
That's what it's been reduced to
I hate to say that but I'll be very honest with it
That's what it's been reduced to
Because I got news for 23 years of pleading and begging
And whipping people to have an opinion about anything to say something
Anything
It's getting stale man
It's getting old
I'm getting old but not nearly as old as this
NOOOOO
But that was a classic
That was scintillating man
That was special
That's what Fort Myers had to say
What do they have to say today?
Hey Neil, this is Randy West
If you can't tell the difference between me and Ron Jeremy
You should try girls
Yeah, that's what they have to say
Speaking of fat Ron Jeremy
Is there anybody who wants to see Ron Jeremy naked?
No, see I don't understand that whole thing
If he wasn't good buddies with Al Goldstein
He never would have gotten a business in the first place
I'm sure that
Maybe he was like servicing Al
That must have been him
Because why would any person in their right mind want to see somebody who looks like that naked?
Even Randy West has anybody want to see him naked?
No, God forbid
Here's Pompano, hello
Hi Neil, yes sir
I got a great story to worry about crossing in sporting events
A story goes that how it goes so
And I suppose your machine was sitting in the front row at the boxing balls
And if the ring jumps one of these panicked guys
It's down in his hands and knees
Give themselves a big cross
And how it looks at the ice pressure consists of that help
And the ice pressure says
Only if there's a good left hook
Yeah
I thought that was great
How about you?
I thought it was slightly amusing
Yeah, that's about it
Okay, thank you
Okay, 560, 7.0560, Pomp-560 on the AT&T line
And out of town line, including Fort Myers by the way
Where they're loaded today
It's their material
877-785-0
877-785-6345
And we'd be paying for it
Maybe that dial call back
Maybe he'll put you up a little bit
You know, he did call back
What do you say?
He said someone came into the room
Yeah, naked?
Leave
Somebody came into the room and he had a leave
Okay, do we believe that?
No
Here's Miami, hello
Hello
You got stricken with bluff Lindsey disease
Yes, sir?
Yes, why am I here?
Yes, sounds like you
Oh, okay, I haven't met my newspaper today
And I looked at it
And it says on the local section
Juice loves soft food and sunshine
This newspaper is trash
Yeah
Stopping my favorite giveaway for God Fluffing OJ and his kids
They just can't stop beating us over the head with this motoring son of a bitch
Right, and there he is with taking a pose for a photograph
For some mother-lady and his child
And these people love him
You know, I live in Kendall
This guy might just move into my community
And I don't want this to happen
And this is this loose paper here just like just
Just a power gift
Well, don't forget Channel 7 is going to have a mon on it
Inside edition or whatever the hell it is that they're promoting on those spots
They're going to have him on again
We just think, well, not leave us alone with him
He's like a weapon and they keep beating us over the head with him
They keep placing us to pieces with him
It just embarrasses me
It just embarrasses me to live in this community
And to see our newspaper just adore him
And I don't know if you know
Dr. Sear, it's all over my, like I said before
It's like Dennis Rodman and Bobby Brown
And it's another scumbag at him to the list
And scumbags that we just can't get enough of
I know
And Bob A. Burring is a potato chip
You should sit next to Yenthal Green on the sideline
Okay, thanks. Quit while you're ahead pal
I was yet a Yenthal Green doing by the way
Anybody seeing him play lately? No
5607-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T line

From 46 and 560-Q-A-L
Many calls today about that stigma, and I want to talk about
Inquiring Catholics want to know
No
Here's the fact that I think tells it all
From Carlos R
Niels, you should have heard the mad dog yesterday
He talked about Pavel Burriolotti
He said the guy should have a D&A test
To see if he's a man or a woman and a lot more
Pavel, you should have a D&A test
Nice going, Carlos
He's like the guy who saw the Titanic victory on the front of the sports
They didn't thought the Titans won
Oops
Little better night school
Little better job there at night school might help
I think I'm going to go to the D&A test
560-Q-A-L
560-Q-A-L
560 on the AT&T line
Here's Pember Pine, tell him
Niels
Your first person to talk about the stigma
There is on Channel 7
Going to be a whole story
We don't know
Rick Sance is probably foaming the mouth waiting to tell about that
Or whoever is going to do it
Can I be the one to poke the holes in his hands though please?
Sure
Sure
Make it like Swiss cheese if you like
But they're going to do the story on Channel 7
It's going to be the night I believe
Just for information
You might want to catch it
I thought he was going to explain this to you
Tell us what it was all about
And all these fairy tales
Was he going to do that?
No, we'll just wait for Channel 7
See, I don't understand this scheme that we plan to show
Day after day after day
Month after month after month
Year after year after year
Don't you think that's a reasonable question to ask
Especially all the Hispanics out there all Catholic
And you are even a Catholic
Like you didn't know what the hell it was
And they have been a big thing about it now for whatever reason
It's making a big comeback
Maybe there are a bunch of people with bloody hands out there
Like especially the people of the Vatican
They got a lot of blood on their hands
Very reasonable question
Do I get a response?
No, 23 years I've been doing that
And then that one woman calls me
Oh yes, there's a lot of very bright people, a lot of good colors on it
Well, I got news for you, they've all vanished
They've all vanished
Except for Carlos R, who's not getting a DNA test right now
And a guy in four Myers
That was a good call
Well somebody came in the room
Yes, somebody came in the room
And he probably was too embarrassed to let them fight
He was calling on his show
That's probably what the problem was
Because he's over in four Myers
And they probably give him a little stig mod
Right on the hand and maybe on the head
Calling that fag in Miami from four Myers over there
So we appreciate the position you're in, sir
Probably prone
Here's a mobile in Miami
Hello
Okay, sir
I went to the game last night
After the dolphin scored the second touch
And I decided to go downstairs and get something to drink
And then before that I wanted to be
Line to the restroom
Or to proceed to the pop-up pimple on my ass
Got pus all over my jeans
Okay, great
567-0560, 05-560 on the 18th line
Here's a mobile in the pepper fine
Hello
Hello Neil? Yes, hey, buddy, how are you doing today?
Okay
I started with the right after I leave
Caller said about going to strip clubs again
I don't think Ken Jenny's going to have time to be writing them
Because apparently on the news of the night
He's considered running for the strong mayor in Breark County
I didn't hear any of your callers mentioning that
I thought maybe that would be okay
That's mentioning what?
That's not news I talked about that two months ago
I mean that's what he's wanted
Months ago I talked more than two, three, four months ago
Yeah, it's time to pack up and move then
He hasn't got a chance in hell
All the early polls he isn't going to win it
That's what I think he's been doing all the time
All that's pandering
You think he's going to be the Rudy Giuliani of Breark County
And the public is saying you can get the hell out of here
You both had a geek, we don't want any part of you
He's pasty face, look at him
Look at him
Oh my god, he's terrible
Along with the
Permanent sports
Hello
I'm listening sir, I know it's shocking
I'm still here
Oh you're still there, I'm sorry, I knew I usually get some static in it
I didn't hear anything of it
I'm still here sir, I'm right here
One that rhymes with boring, how about boring
That's about terminal
5,670560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line
As we continue the search
The 23 year search ongoing
Somebody out there, somebody with something to say
Something worthwhile, something interesting, something amusing, something perplexing
Something profound, something anything
Something like, eehhhhh
That
Here's candle, hello
Yes Neil, yes sir
This woman says, give me some proof on who killed her
Woman posing with OJ
Yeah
I don't think OJ is the problem, I think it's all these got people and people like this woman
What does that mean, give me some proof on who killed her?
Well evidently she must have missed a trial I guess
I mean she's a witness to D&A evidence
She's probably a Jesus freak
She's a proof for that though
Okay thanks, 5,670560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line
Here's Orlando, hello
Hello Neil, yes sir
Yeah let's hope I get through this call, I have a couple questions
There are some other brings up lots of air lines
I gotta talk about it
The gentleman I called earlier with the information on national airlines
Are they gonna be just out of Miami or do you know they're already flying out of some other markets
I don't know where
I just went to Vegas the 1st of August
And I'm about to tell my children you're talking about first class
Because I've never had the opportunity to ride in that
Is it that expensive to go first class?
Well you're like on the line to the high?
$2,500
In American, yeah
Early crap
I believe in the guy just if you were listening
The guy said it was like 280 I think in coach
And 1100 and something in the first class
Well right now
It's a lot of money but it's less than half what American wants to soak it
Right now out of Orlando they have all the airlines
Delta America West
I think Americans in there too
It's like round trip is 212
In 12th of August
In coach Hill
Yeah
We went and got a package deal
You don't like doing the all-in-one air inclusive thing to you
No
Wife and I both went and paid 972
Spade 6 days of my car when it was round trip air
There's America West
It wasn't really bad
I wouldn't do America West if they paid me $1,000
I would not fly in an airliner
There is no way in Hill
I'll ever fly in America West again
Don't you have an air bus out of Miami?
Is that what the plane is?
They use that other
Well they do now they never use those before
They're now using the air bus but they still
I just keep you in one horror story after another
I hear no good stories about America West
Well I've been Vegas twice
One Delta, one's America West
And believe it or not, America West was better for me anyway
Yeah
Next question is how close can I get the Orlando to pick up one of your CDs?
Palm Beach?
Yeah Palm Beach, West Palm
Oh boy
Or you can just order it off the website
They'll mail it out to you just nearogies.com if you have a computer

Hello
Neal, we're living in the SPIC model
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Here's a mobile in Davy, hello
Neal, yes sir
Hey this is Josh call from Davy
I just want a little information on the SPIC model
If you don't wonder if you ever heard of Padre Pio
Yes, they had a piece on him again this morning
Yeah, he's not sticking it anymore
They stuck him in the ground
Actually the truth of SPIC model is
They don't stick it through their hands
They stick it through the wrist
That's how the Romans actually cruised the part of him
Through the wrist
Through the wrist
Maybe that's why he had such a limp wrist
Yeah
Thanks for the good news
Also one through the hand to his through the wrist
How do you like that?
Yeah
And of course if he was through the wrist
And that makes all these other stories
Spony, baloney all together
Because Padre Pio
He had holes in the middle of his hands
And he would wear the gloves
And the bandages when he would do the things
Simply go to Mass
And then he would like to take them off
And the bandages too
And to you everybody his bloody hands
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60
You never heard of Padre Pio
Padre Pio, whatever, whatever
What kind of a Catholic are you man?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
You got to burn in hell is what you're going to do
I'll tell you that right now
I'll apologize that yeah I'm like
You're going to be burning in hell with those auto racing people

They don't want their kids to be smarter than they are
Excellent point Niel
Thank you
Here's a great letter to the editor in a hurdle this morning
From William Gehlberg in Delray Beach
Los Van Van Protester's mimic regime
They fled is the headline
He sends I'm really in
He sends those Cuban ex-hals in Miami who acted so disgracefully
At the recent Los Van concert
It indicates to me and many others that they're more likely
The spot dictator from whom they fled and used threats
Force and intimidation against people who don't agree with their way of thinking
Didn't they learn anything in this land of freedom?
No
We tolerate people to disagree with us and we don't try to impose our feelings
Through the use of force and intimidation
In addition they should know that most of us at one time or another
Also fled from this kind of bullying tactic
If these ex-hals can't readily accept our hospitality
Understand that America is not some third world tin horn dictatorship
Then I would strongly suggest they find another country
That would have them to practice their form of bullying and intimidation
Let's hear it for William Gehlberg
I just go on Billy Boy and Delray Beach
And just coincidentally on a friend page of the Herald
Floridian's welcome ad is wearing out
Cutting immigration returning rafters and ending the embargo
Our favorite it says
Do you favor or oppose making legal immigration in the US more difficult in date county 50% in favor of 45% opposed
And the reason for that being just a bare majority of his panic supports opposed making it more difficult
But even many of those said cut the crap
In Broward County however 68% are in favor of making legal immigration more difficult only 26% are opposed
Because in Broward County we don't have quite as many yet
But an abode people yet as they do in date county

The story is ways. Hey, I just want to throw my two cents. Thank you, sir

Mean bailiff by it. I'm humiliated by it. I'm grossed out by it. I'm nauseated. I'm sick and by it not sick to be sick for lunch, but nevertheless

Here's Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. How you doing? I'm okay?
You're question about the stigmata. Yes, and apparently the stigmata is produced by the faithful
On certain parts of body hands
There couldn't be too many faithful them because it only had a couple of reports throughout history right and
We're Jesus or the band of thorns around the top of the head they produce and on the side of the body where of course
He was punctured by the spear while up on the cross. Oh
And they produce these
Stigmata are we are bleeding on
Yeah, yeah, Albert spear on
certain times of the of like
lint and
on Sunday on Christmas on the on the
Chivalrous yeah, sure Chivalrous why not?
And who's good Jewish boy and on the resurrection right and that's there's been I don't know
I was watching a program on the history channel about the a woman that produced stigmata
regularly when she went into a a when she blood wants them up. Yeah, no
When she was devout and praying. Uh-huh. Oh
And the blood comes pouring out of your hand and she had it across her forehead and actually taped it of
The blood that come across her forehead went within the next day or within hours
Okay, thanks for the good news pal. Let's get a little bit to gory our lunches here. Not came standing more of it
You know what I'm getting ready to
Let's start from all the goddamn blood a lot of blood and violence in that goddamn Bible. Oh
Let's hear it a little SNM story for you
This stigmata, but you see the guys were right it was through the wrist and nails were through the wrist because if they put it through the hand
The hand would have it would just slip right down fall on the ground
Fall right off that then cross
But you put it through the wrist now you got to get the wrong support baby unless it's somebody with a real impressed
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line as the search for intelligent life continues here, huh
Here's a lady in four-lawnerdale. Hello. Hi. How are you Neil? Okay
I'm stigmata. It's not supposed to be external bleeding. It's supposed to be internal bleeding
Yeah, which creates marks on your wrist up to your palm and then your
ankles down to your feet and it's not necessarily religious, but I'm sure that people twist it in that direction
It's not religious. It's not necessarily religious. It's also a medical
Problem named stigmata also which creates internal bleeding. So
It's a medical problem
Yeah, it is a medical problem also and that's why like sometimes you see people like you know what blummishes on their faces and stuff right
That's stigmata and then but you know
Like WC fields head on his nose. Okay, all those bulbous veins in his nose like
Okay, yeah, but um these are legit people twist it into whatever they want to make these suckers believe you know
That they're it's enough to get the Lord yeah exactly
So that's stigmata
Thanks you're welcome. Yeah, there you go. There's what stigmata is it's a goddamn medical condition here. I thought it was burrow clothes veins
From your Nc. Say from your knee down your ankle something like that hip bone joint
Connected to the whatever bone the big bone. That's what Jeff Cohen said hip bone is connected to my big five six seven oh five sixty
Palm five sixty on the AT&T world of sign just just a thought of him being there. I mean why would anybody
That's seriously. I mean, I'm just picking him as an example. Why would anybody want to see him doing anything sexual
You know, I mean I sure wouldn't want to see him in the kitchen at the pizza lot
But the idea of seeing him involved in any kind of a sexual is just I mean see I'm doing everything in my power
So they don't eat too much lunch
nauseating puke inducing
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello
Mobile in Miami
Is gone. Okay, let's try a mobile in the deer field. Hello
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Uh, I don't believe in my I think it's all you know a little crap
But the people caught up on Roman execution
Roman crucified in several different ways. Some they didn't even nail you at all. They just tied your elbows
But it wasn't an account of for Romans to nail your palms entire elbows both
So it is possible maybe that Christ was nailed in the palms or not, but you know
I could be on things with the CC. No, I sound like a bunch of bull to me
Mm-hmm
And I suppose there's race Catholic, but I really know it sounds like that old black magic to me all over again
Yeah, I know you're right. Yeah, the Bible's full of a lot of sex and violence
So it's pretty good reading if you look at his entertainment
Okay, all right. Thanks for the good news. Thanks you
Oh my god, it's another act of God
How do you like that? Do you hear that? I need never line punched up and it was like a dial tone

Yes, sir. I would describe stigmata as a ghoulish Catholic parlor trick
Yeah, and when the Catholic religion is loaded with these kinds of things like
Your transubstantiation
The belief that the a host in the wine turns into the flesh and blood essentially that it's a cannibalism
It's just a it's a lot of it of course it's cannibalism and that business about to give the way for out your eating Christ
I mean what the hell is that and really really believe it is
I mean the hardcore capric to really believe that is in fact the flash of Jesus Christ
And did you know about that when they canonized saints they actually
Exume their corpses and then cut them up in little pieces and turn them into relics. All right
So you know if you believe in the saints you're gonna walk around a little
Crucifix about your really sick bastards to me man. I would have to agree

I've been working on other things, but I heard that you he didn't give all the information
I just wanted to make sure that you what we mean he didn't give all the information what information didn't he give?
He gave the fairs he gave the time he gave the date that it starts he gave my shoe size
The pilot's name he gave the store this is breast size. I mean, well, what else would you want?
If well no information on the first class upgrade
He gave a python the first class and that and there's no information on that as well
Maybe he's got more information than you got he got a price. Huh?
Well, I don't you know, I mean, I can't directly from the you know, and so maybe maybe uh
Well, you know, and I'm gonna wait to sit back and watch some other people try this first and if they come back alive
Then maybe I'll think about it, you know, all right. You know what I mean? Exactly. Okay. All right. Thanks Bob
You're welcome. What did I say thanks? Well, that was a good way of saying goodbye
5 6 7 0 5 60 but I sure love those hotel books baby. Leave them comments. We'd art
Here's a mobile and Delray Beach hello
Mobile and Delray Beach hello Neil. Yes, sir. How are you okay? Oh, I love you show a new listener. All right
Listen um before you cut me off. I know what it mean before I cut you off because I know I got this question about
So you got to cut me off
You did no, I did not okay
Um, what do you want what could possibly be the question? What what what why do we want to talk about him again? Wait. I want to answer something
Um, I started listening when the golf tournament came on. Yeah, we have the problems with the golf card. Did you have a chance to interview him?
What do you mean a chance?
Well, why wouldn't you want to like rip them all up and stuff? Because I wouldn't let him use
I wouldn't dignify him by putting him on the air. That's why
All right, that's why I just wanted to know because I would get him one second worth of air time
What's the point because I'm some kind of a sadist that I'm gonna get some kind of sexual excitement by calling him a murdering son of a bitch
I can do that without putting him on the air
All right
Now I'm playing with that 100 percent no question about it. So let me say it again. He will not be on this show trust me
You can take it to the bank. Thank you. Can you play with me for girls?
5667 05 60 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's the mobile in Miami. Hello
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey Dylan first on I apologize for the fact that Miami is surrounding you by idiot. Oh
There's it's it's reached the epidemic now. It's like an epidemic situation we got
I've been listening to you recently. I um, I've been out here for a couple of years
I did my postgraduate work and now I'm staying because my fiance is gonna go buy and get her my asterisk
And although I'm thinking really soon moving back to America and
I was I was
Was one day I person stuff you talk about education before I've been around town
I teach now at a local college which I'm not gonna name
But I have these people I go into restaurants and you know, I've applied for teaching jobs
I teach music so I was gonna teach for this thing
You go to houses and teach kids and instruments and then they told me my Spanish wasn't good enough and broken English
Which was real nice
and
You know I hear people talking about the dolphins
I'm not a sports fan and I but you know but I can if you're in this voice
I know you're in the hockey. I hear that you know and although these fans are a piece of crap down here anyway
For whatever they're listening to music sports doesn't matter
But at the same time these people talk about a bunch of crap on the radio worrying about what they're gonna go to a club
Why Miami isn't winning why?
Why marinos doing this and the same time I teach your college to get a bunch of papers in from these same kids that are talking a bunch of this crap
Yeah, and they can't even string four sentences together. Mm-hmm. You know, I do anything with a d and a test
I don't know what it is
But these these people want a bunch of morons. I mean I
You got it. You got it
It's really yeah, I could take it personally if I wanted to but I'm not an idiot
You know, I got a pretty good sense of humor. I got an IQ large and then my thumbnail
And I'm just surrounded in the town where the average IQ is in a minus column. That's all nothing I can do about it
I can do the best I can that's it
I enjoy listening to you Neil your your highly intelligent individual and
And I have a great time listening. I'm taking Wednesday's payday just to take the event
Have a great day. Take care of it. That's right Wednesday's the 10th of November. It's another payday
The only reason I'm here. God bless me. God bless America four minutes to one of QAM
This is 560 QAM only one South Florida radio station has
Sports radio 560 QAM
I
Want to do
Hi
Don't you love feel Bradley? Yeah, don't we need feel Bradley? Yeah, it's more than 60 cars
I always play for back at four. All right. Don't you love feel Bradley?
Yeah, we need him badly
He's gonna win the race
People of him call me if I'm now
Did I mention that he is now
Good
He played for the next
He doesn't bar up
Yeah, we love him cause he is now good
Not our goal
Not our goal
Not our goal
Yeah, he's not our goal
I say it one time more
We love feel a lot
But because he's not boring
out the door
Well, don't you love feel Bradley?
Well, it's still at 560 that's still empty. It's just so easy
See this is what happens when you got in the tanny. It was an auto racing like Mario and Dredy
Okay, he knows nothing else. He probably don't even know no past of his rule
No, seriously, you don't know anything about Italy. You don't know anything about
Catholicism all you know is auto racing and a goddamn Yankees
Which congratulations, but I've never left. Thank you
No, seriously, I learned the marri how could anybody say is not a tanny?
I mean, I'm embarrassed for you. I mean, it would be one thing if you were like Polish
But you're a tagging
Yeah, and he's a tanny don't be like my son. Oh Miltonborough wasn't Jewish
Or isn't or whatever the hell he is. He's still alive. He's not what Jewish Miltonborough. Yeah. Okay. Miltonborough's not Jewish and
Maryland or was not dead and
Ronald Reagan doesn't have Alzheimer's and anti-region doesn't wear red dress
In fact, Nancy Reagan is the devil with a blue dress on how do you like that
Or is that Monica one of the other? He's a titan god damn it. I had heard some
Her what you see this is what happens when you start spreading bad rumors
He's a dingo. He's a wap. He's a guinea okay. He's a satan
He's a good guy
He's and nobody in this audience all these sports nerds on his radio who call his god damn stupid as sports station
Danny this and Damon that and Jimmy this
There's the only reason that they're even in the goddamn running much less leading to the vision
Isolendo Marre
Olendo Marre yeah, there's the guy right there that little wap
Yeah, he's scored 95% of their points already
Besides that one great return for the interception and touchdown last night
Didn't he run it all away? No, no
Here's for Lauderdale. Hello
No, how you doing? Okay, sir. You got a great show. Let me just tell you. I moved here from LA a few months ago
And listen talk shows a long time. Yeah
Even if you didn't have one call it would be a fantastic show. There's something everybody all over the world
Are you to come down here and oh you're the greatest thing we ever heard in our lives other people in a business
And yet every day of my life here is like the first day that I'm on a year in his town
These are the most ungiving unyielding
Unbending goddamn people they will give you nothing and all they want is you to give them something for free
That's all they want. They're about your freeloaders
I think first of all just to tell it like it is. I mean you're just hilarious
I enjoy it every day
But here's my main point and I thank you for bringing a pocket because nobody talks about that
They wouldn't know a hockey puck from a goddamn lenders bagel. I've been a fanatic for 32 years
Let me guide you some might I watch this team burry's not the thing people just not talking about burry
This team has a bunch of primitonis with the exception maybe five guys that hit anybody
Yeah, you guys got six five guys like Kajla Kavashia Mike Wilson these guys could go into the court
They could go into the corner with an egg in their pocket and it wouldn't come out the cracked it all
That's right. It's a fan of pristine these guys think they're the players on his team right now
Okay, Ray Whitney you got Mark Parrish you got
Trevor kid
You got right ahead of him when he's not suspended and I'm trying to think of somebody else
Paul laws
That's about it. Simpson and melon behind him
Mel Melon be what he's head straight now
And you know what wins and hockey is not the fancy dance that the ice to page you need hard work and teams
And this team until I get rid of a lot of these free low. There's like a devora actor wouldn't touch anybody
Yeah, there's another stuff. I mean, this is pathetic. So it's not burry burry when he's in that's fine
But you're missing is this point and that is this for example Atlanta's gonna be our Wednesday and expansion team a
Test team nobody here knows the Atlanta thrashers from the the trash man. Okay, they have no idea
So if you're gonna try to get people to come out
You've got a guy that's making ten million dollars a year who for my money is still the most exciting not the best player
That's still the auger but the most exciting player in the world when he's healthy
But he's got to get healthy sometime
You know I agree with that but you know what the thing that really brings people out is a winning hard work and team
And you know when I go to these games if you lose you lose
But I want to go down fighting. I want to be a hard working when I saw that game Saturday night with no
Visellte I wouldn't wouldn't drop his gloves with somebody and no one be has to get a game is kind of yeah
But they won the game six to three. I mean they won the game. They won the game. Yeah, but they girls team now
I understand that but they got too many guys on this team that they're not character type guys
Yeah, and until that changes this team is gonna stay average at best and I just want to say that
It's not buried it's these other players that won't put out that's the problem. Yeah
There's nothing worse than a guy that won't put out. Yeah, you know have a great day. Thanks. They all like that
Let's get hockey intensive baby
And i just wanted to try my course on basketballtime
barroman
That I
Theetriour dominat Houor playing under the board of blue
and
and
i realize your bone eight no jigs michael

that's one of the problems we got in here is these radio broadcast i'm sorry
five six seven o five sixty pound five sixty on the eighteen t-line
things that are meaningful things that are important like hockey these people
don't know from they don't care about it they don't want to learn about it
they know nothing
the status day of my life was the day that i gave those guys and tickets away
and it grew old called in and i was given remember asking the numbers of
different players i mean about like yogger what not not i had a smatch
sunday you know i had a a Steve i's a man i don't know
and she's got a reading of the hockey news which i at least congratulate
her that somebody gave her a copy of the hockey news maybe she even bought
it herself
maybe she even prescribed to it
i think this town needs a d and a test is what i think
she's got a read out of the god them uh... roosters in a hockey news to be able
to win a ticket but at least like i said she came in admitted to me in public
it the arena
and i said i want to take its back
she was a big girl to by the way very nice young lady but she was big
enough to beat the crap out of me i'll tell you that some of those tickets back
i will i give it to you
she had a deep voice
kind of like that hunchback
nine minutes after why i still saw a upset about that olympa maribus
no seriously you know it's like it would be like saying just set me

Well, I came back here after a couple you know seven or eight years and I can't believe the changes I've seen
Yeah, it's just it's like a
vapid torped but now
Existence of commercial nothingness right exactly. I mean, I've never seen anything quite this bad, but I mean Europeans
You know, they understand it
Yeah, it seems to me that Americans don't see the force for the trees. They don't I I keep telling them that I keep telling them how
Civilized it is in Europe and how the people are right around shooting each other and nobody has guns and there's no this rampant violence and the people are
Educated and like in some of the countries people speak five and six and seven languages fluently and they're you know
Priorities education and how many material things that they've got and these people go
Like that they just don't care their brain washed well, you know, I mean after living you know
when you live in places like Florence right and
Rome being on the V evento correct. I mean what more can you ask for?
I mean you got people that are like you said civilized
Yeah, there's enough to make you want to go back to the Colosseum and you know and
Storse some Christian to the lions. Hey, listen. I got a little answer for you as far as big motto
Yeah, have you ever been to Tuscany? I'm sure you have yes
There's a little area that you got to get to it's up near a little town called a raco, which is where my relatives are from
Arrezzo Arrezzo. It's about 40 miles west of Florence and South
40 miles west of Florence
Florida. Yeah, 40 miles west and south
Right, Florence. Now if you go above there in the Ampeneins, which is just you know awesome territory
Much prettier than Florida. I ate this but it ate it but it's all of Italy's pretty unbelievable
And anyways, there's a little area. There's a little monastery called La Verna
And also one called Commaldoli. Now that's where St. Francis had his quote unquote
Stigmata. St. Francis of Assisi. Yeah, right. The same
St. Francis of Assisi anyways

Just like that. Hey have a good one. Thanks a lot pal. You bet. I'll leave it there to you
Oh
123 a QA and five six seven oh five fifty. Here's an incredible story and this story by the way, I especially want to dedicate
To all those bony red wing fans out there who show up at the macarena every time the red wings coming at time
With their red wings jerseys on people that wouldn't know south field from north field
People that never were on god damn 12 of a 12th street
People that wouldn't know the ambassador bridge from the ambassador to England
Members of a Florida television crusade red wings coach Scotty Bowman
Captain Steve izerman and forward Marpanne La Point abuse them during a game in Tampa Bay last night
Nice going lightning by the way
I watched that game
Which detroit lost three to two
The detroit free press reports today that Bowman shoved the cameraman into a stage manager in the old obscenities
izerman
Try to grab a camera during the third period of the wings three to two lost on the net and La Point threatened and spit
How do you like that for class?
I spit at the cameraman
The trouble began during the second animation after the defenseman Chris Celios was penalized when 10 seconds left in the period
Giving Tampa Bay a two-man advantage
Bowman left the bench walked down the tunnel tour the locker room and encountered a camera crew that was sitting up the interview associate coach Dave Lewis
Bowman allegedly pushed cameraman Richard Delaney who fell in the stage manager Amy Confort the camera striking her on a shoulder
loss
Delaney said Bowman just shoved me out of the way, but he didn't want to come in further
Act whether he was in Bowman's path. Delaney said I could have been
Confort said she was angry and planned to file a complaint
also
We were just trying to do our job trying to interview one of the assistant coaches during the period breaks
She said he did it with enough force to feel the impact then he started yelling obscenities
He wasn't a real happy person at that point
Lewis left the arena before reporters learned of the allegations
The trouble continued into the third period after the lightning scored twice to take a three to one lead at 201
But Rocky said he pointed his camera at isemen and LePont sitting dejectedly on the bench
But Rocky was and at an assigned station between the benches shielded from players by plexiglass
Isemen reached him on the front of the glass to try to grab the lens and I backed up at Rocky said when I backed up
Isemen backed off and LePont started on me
But Rocky told the newspaper that LePont threaded him saying I'm coming over the glass
Squirt Squirt
So the next thing I know the truck he said he did his spitting routine
He was arching his spitting over the glass to try to get at me
Nice classy job there Scotty Bowman and Stevie Y and Martana point nice going
Of course, you'd be pretty pissed off too if you lost to a girl's team in Tampa last night three to two lecture red wings
So all you phoneies all you're front running phoneies that go there suck at the red wings ass every time to come to town take that and stick it right in your
Correct them. Yeah
Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, no, I don't okay sir. Just wondering if you saw the article on the Sun sent me yesterday
I know charity is lately. I've been a touchy subject with you about the
Denise Brown charity set up for Nicole Simpson. I talked about that brother woman
Oh, did you okay? And they raise all this money and about two dollars is gone and do what the real charity?
Yeah, I just it really opened my eyes a lot to what these charities are all about
I mean, you know administrative fees. What does that mean you basically live off the charity the rest of your life in their pocket
That's right. Okay, buddy. Okay, so check it in with it. Thanks for the goodness. Okay, five six seven oh five sixty
Pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line twenty six after one a QAM. I wouldn't spend on the best part of the red wings

Check it out.
So call me up.
I really need a script.

The only thing I will not do is have sex with a llama.
So give me a break for goodness sake.
I used to be on offer and now I can't get on Ricky Lake.
Right now I got a one man showing, Paul Kipsy.
Basically I'm an unemployed gypsy.
I don't know if it catches what I need.

That's why I'm ready to get on.
I need to make ramble for it.
Absolutely.
Offer 8256 WQM.

You know, all that cheese.
Bad cholesterol, baby.
255.
Oh, LDL and unacceptable 190.
Oh, oh, oh.
Yeah.
Not too good.
Not too good.
Those blood test results last week.
Their cholesterol is sky high.
I think it might have been all that bad.
I think it might have been engineering.
All these lunch, meats and cheese.
All that fatty stuff.
See, I was thinking about this the other day.
When you're trying to, first of all, you want to do the addkins or you want to do some low carb diet.
And then you're going to cut out all the sugar and the starches.
And if you're going to also cut out cholesterol, what are you going to eat?
What's left?
What's left to eat, decide?
Yeah, that's about it.

8, 7, 7, 7, 8, 5, Nailed.
I'll figure it will be its specs in the South-Aid and the Gables.
The Saturday noon to 2 with our best of stuff.
Here's a mobile in the Helenvale.
Hello.
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
Okay, sir.
Hey, listen, you see that thing about the church root cave in it?
Yeah.
You know, the first thing they did after the root cave, yeah?
And what was that, sir?
They wanted to play the God.
Yeah.
You'll got it.
Walker, walkaway's root falls 23 hurt in the Ultimons Springs.
A lot of bad things seem to be happening in church lately, you notice?
Yeah, well, you know, thank God.
Okay, that's what's God's busy with the NFL.
Oh!
That's right, he's busy with those NFL games.
And in fact, you noticed another new thing.
You didn't see the end of the bear's Packers game.
Because the field goal kicker for the bear is to miss the chip shot field goal,
which would have given him a bigger lead.
And so then the kid for the Packers comes out there with a chip shot.
It looks like the bears are going to blow another one.
And the kicker's blocked.
And the kicker for the bear is going like this, and he's looking up at the sky.
And they showed a couple other highlights.
And after these guys make the great catch, or they score the touchdown, they're looking up in the sky.
Like something, maybe a pigeon up there had something to do with it.
What is it up there in the sky that caused them to win the goddamn game?
Did God have something to do with that?
Did God forth that field goal to be blocked?
Is that what it was?
Jesus Christ, they're crossing themselves.
They're looking up at a sky.
Like if there's a God, he's worried about God damn sports.
But God listens to QAN.
The wonder we've had sex bad weather lately.
You know, it must be pretty pissed off.
Hey, God, let me ask you what you're taking on that Sterling Heights nearborn game this weekend.
God.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line.
And 8, 7, 7, 7, 8, 5, kneel on the Florida line.
Boy, I can't wait.
Can't wait for that line to go nationwide, boy.
I bet you we get at least what?
Two, three more call a day on that thing?
It's going to be smoking.
Here's Miami Lakes.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, how the comment about the pain stored?
Yeah, huh.
Yeah, I got a pain for it.
Chronic, chronic spec.
Chronic, chronic, chronic.
You're boring, pal.
Chronic.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
You guys over in the sports case, I guess, the sunset.
No, just still running last week's spot.
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
Good guys.
And now he hasn't even finished it, and I can ask him what he's talking about.
He's already got the radio cranked up so he can squeeze himself with his son of his own voice.
Oh, my God.
This is just, it's you know what it is?
Oh, the lake.
That's exactly the word I'm looking for, man.
Thank you.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line.
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.
Hello.
Okay.
So that story about Iserman really sounds a little out of character for him, but I guess you know anything can happen.
You get a guy in a bad minute.
Yeah.
That doesn't sound like really something to do, but what I understand is that he wasn't the main perpetrator.
I mean, I guess the, uh, pushed the lens of the camera got the camera.
Oh, maybe he did.
The first time he saw the game said they really didn't play that well.
So maybe he was the bad guy for him.
How much the game, they didn't play that well.
They didn't play that well.
That's what I grewl's team.
You go in there thinking you can roll over on the next thing, you know, you're down at home.
Well, that is stuff happens.
People lose their heads.
What the heck?
You know, people lose their heads.
They lose their heads.
You're going to lose some games.
That's the excuse for anybody spitting at people.
That's true.
And pushing people down.
That's pressure on us.
It's the ones in the night to beat that new team.
So it should be interesting to see.
You're pressure on us to have 8,000 people.
What do you do?
You're up there.
That's the big pressure.
Well, good luck to us anyway.
Okay, thanks.
There's pressure to see if we can get anybody in that joint.
And based on the tremendous response I'm getting about is Pavel Buria.
Pussy, I don't think we're going to have anybody in that joint wins the night.
And let me say it again.
The kids are out of school on Thursday.
Oh, Jesus, you know what that means?
You know what that means?
You know who's going to be sitting in front of me Wednesday.
Oh, God.
Holding a little kid's up in the air back and forth.
Here's grandpa.
Here's the Oh, Jesus.
Them.
Them.
Whoever they are.
Them.
I don't want to attach a name to them.
All I know is it's them.
Them.
The back and forth people, the up and down people, the ante people, the ante in the pants people.
So let's go get some more goddamn food people.
Them.
They'll be back.
Although it is a pretty crappy opponent, maybe, just maybe they gave those tickets to somebody else.
Yeah, maybe the two guys that came last week who just wanted to stand up the whole time.
Yeah, just stand up.
We'd score a goal.
They'd stand up.
Everybody else would sit down.
They're still standing.
They were singing out in John.
I'm still standing.
Yet they were doing that in the number.
Yeah.
I'm still standing.
Oh no, kidding.
I thought that was your ass in my face.
Here's Bokeh.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
You ever happy?
All the time.
All the time.
All the time.
What can we do for you, sir?
I just wonder what you don't have any material.
See, that's not a phone call.
You don't like me.
You don't like the show.
See ya.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
Have a great life.
So long.
560-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T line.
Here's Evan Tura.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes.
How are you, sir?
Okay.
All right.
I guess he's calling.
I don't know what they're calling.
They're calling.
So they want to take a shot at me.
I'm holding the same.
Well, I'm holding on the line.
I'm hearing them.
And I'm hearing what they're saying.
I mean, you're right.
They have nobody has nothing to say today.
Anyway, what I'm calling for is, um, what's that?
I'm not sure what show it is.
It's that special edition or high-company around seven o'clock.
Evening.
Yeah.
They're going to have one commercial I tune in, a pound 96 there.
I've given a commercial for, uh, every time for OJ Simpson.
I could that.
Now, one more.
You could have the same commercial on this show.
Oh, man.
Yeah.
Well, anyway, uh, he's calling that one one called that.
He made a couple of weeks ago.
Yeah.
Well, they're going to have, uh, they're going to have this, uh, girl.
I know that.
Why are you promoting that?
I didn't know.
I didn't hear you talk about it.
I didn't mention that.
That it's going to be on.
I also mentioned we don't want to talk about OJ and have a great day.
Enough with OJ already.
Enough with a goddamn OJ.
No more.
Oh, man.
Christ.
Here's another guy.
He's, you know, he's putting him down, but on the set the same time he's obsessed.
Can't get enough of it.
He'll be watching.
Do I want to watch?
No.
Not going to be watching?
No.
No.
No, thanks.
El Paso.
560, 705, 60, pound 560 on the AT&T line.
Well, least thank God we learned something important today, Orlando Mares Italian.
I thought I already knew that before I came in here, but at least we verified it.
Okay, let's hear it.
Okay, for a very educational show.
We also learned that Jeff Cohen makes great food at the pizza lot.
And Jeff, when knows the scores, starting at 10 of the last 10 in,
we ignite only on sports radio 560, QAM.
You'll Nicole.
The legendary athlete, the extraordinary actor.
Now, he debuts in his new action series.
OJ Simpson stars in Miami Slides.
J.J.
L.A.S.
Come on, jump the field.
The juice is loose.
OJ Simpson isn't a vast cop named Bruno Mali.
The Viet Street of Brentwood, California,
the deadly streaks of Miami Florida.
Listen to OJ Simpson's ass-kicking top dialogue.
So, where were you's last night at 7 p.m.?
Answer me, bitch.
Bitch, bitch.
The bitch is going to fall.
You're going to fall.
My Ami's wife, starting OJ Simpson, has Sergeant Bruno Mali.
The hard rough stuff's caught on duty.
But the loving dad, uh, dad?
Yes, dear.
What's happened to mom?
The bitch is dead.
The bitch is dead.
I feel the bitch.
I'll get your room and do your homework.
Miami's wife, starting OJ Simpson, has Sergeant Bruno Mali.
On NBC this Saturday, the Dinchel is blue.
Like at the 16-0-2 or 5-60 W.
Let me see, the American public is obsessed with the same
like, cancel the stories that have all been
sationalized on television.
That's right.
So, the OJ thing that was like a part of everybody's life
for several months on and on and on,
they just can't let go of it.
And a same would like,
Oh my dad looks like me.
Yeah, the same would jump in a Ramsey.
Can't let go of that.
And even when you do want to go of it,
there comes MSNBC and everybody else with 15 more stories on it.
You got the OJ story.
You got John Bonet Ramsey.
You got now Denise Rodman's making a comeback.
Him and Carmen Electra getting busted,
sneaking into parties where they're not invited.
And all this crap with all these swill trash people.
And the American public just sucking it up.
Oh please, just a little more.
Just a little more.
Give me something to hang on to.
Something is a substitute for like a life.
Here's Northport Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hello.
5607-0560,
pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's a call from LaBelle.
Hello.
Hey Neil.
Yes sir.
Yeah, I'm from Michigan.
I moved down here about six months ago.
I grew up down here in the Detroit area.
Yes sir.
Relatives from Detroit.
But I found this kind of interesting
thing is that a lot of people around the area up there
and even around the whole state suddenly became Red Wing fans
after they won the...
Oh, forget about them.
They're down here where nobody here knows the hockey puck
from their god day.
Yeah, everyone on the roof.
All of a sudden these people, after they won two Stanley Cubs.
And even after the first one, but then the second one,
everybody's a Red Wing fan.
They're all show them when the Red Wing's coming.
When he's Red Wing's, he's on.
We've got 5,000 Red Wing fans here.
And let's face it, this is not an area here South East Florida
where we have a lot of Michigan people, believe me.
Well, no kidding.
And everyone's driving around up there, especially with their little flag.
I would bet you that the people down here...
Yeah, but at least at hockey town,
at least they support the team.
And to the second, then at least they pack the place.
Well, I thought that was good from the Michigan standpoint.
Yeah.
Good hockey club gets some interest going in the sport.
But down here, you know, people that were in those Red Wing's jerseys
at the arena are the ones that have no clue what hockey is all about.
Correct.
You know, come on out and support your own team if you have no idea what...
I thought it was a talent to be a front-running phony, believe me.
I guess so.
Okay, pal.
See ya.
See you in LaBelle, not 5,6705,60,
pound 5,60 on the 18th T-line, 877,785,0.
877,785,60,345 on the Florida Line.
Let's do a Daniel.
Hello.
Hi, Daniel.
How you doing?
Okay, sir.
Great show.
My complaint is about these morons that the Dolphin J last night,
where I was sitting, this guy was popping up in front of me every two seconds,
regardless if they were...
Who was driving or what was driving.
I had a bazooka, but I've nailed him in the back.
Yeah.
And I think that they shouldn't make it open market with bazookas before.
Okay, who was that in the doorway, by the way, that I wasn't paying any attention.
Who was that standing in the doorway?
How can you attract Adam Silverstein?
Who wants what?
Nothing from you.
A spot problem.
Oh, spot problem with our sales department.
Okay, great.
Handle it to a clock, Adam Silverstein.
Get out of here.
Go sell some spots.
We've got lots of evils.
5,670,560, pound 560 on the 18th T-Wireless Line.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Miami.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
And Marino injury is a scam.
I beg your pardon?
And Marino injury is a great scam.
He's not worked.
Yeah, huh.
Jimmy Johnson won.
Okay, skin this.
And by the way, next time you call, talk a little louder, okay?
And whatever show it is, which better not be this one.
Talk a little bit louder next time.
Okay, sir.
Thank you.
Here's Port St. Lucy.
Hello.
Neil, thank you for taking my call.
Thank you for making your call, sir.
I don't know if you touched on it.
I'm on my way down from the Tampa.
People say that.
Yes, go ahead.
I'm on my way down from Tampa, and I'm just getting rained.
I apologize.
I'm rehashing something.
I just want to find out what you thought about that of the judges ruling on Microsoft.
I have no interest.
Well, I think it's kind of ridiculous that Bill Gates is being penalized for something he thought of from an monopoly when the
you see is letting every week a few companies buy up here.
We already touched on this earlier in the show.
I have no interest.
Okay, it's a hypocritical country and hypocritical government.
Well, sure is, especially if you get tired of your electric, who do you get to go pick and choose from?
In addition to which, so they charged $89 for something that they could have charged $49 still made of profit.
I thought that's what's called free enterprise.
I thought whatever the market will bear, that's what you're going to charge.
And if you can get it more power to you.
And if a man is smart, what he would do is continue on what he's doing.
Just do not ship anything.
And within the end of three months, you'll see the government calling back home.
Okay.
Thank you, Senator.
If the man is smart, what's he worked 200 and how many billion?
If he's smart.
$567.0560, pound $560 on an AT&T wireless line on one of the worst days in the history of my life.
And this is not sure if this is enough to make you question your sanity.
This collection we've had here today.
And then between Todd Drek and Adam Silverstein, I mean, you just wonder.
You just want to go home and go, what the hell is that?
He can't even do that thing right.
No, everything is limbolybri like that.
Oh my God.
I think it's time for vacation, you know what I'm saying?
Long vacation.
Here's Miami. Hello.
Good morning, man. How are you?
Okay.
You're the best.
Yeah.
And...
I'm worried about those people who are giving us such a hard time because you said you do not believe in God.
Yeah.
I mean, you are a free person.
You have your right to believe or not to believe.
Uh-huh.
Who are those people who said that?
What are you talking about?
Well, you know, they call it, you know, they just give you such a hard time because of your belief system.
Who are those people?
I know what you're talking about.
Uh-uh.
Do you listen to this?
Name me one.
Do we have a colored day of giving me a hard time because I don't believe in God?
I have that today, yeah.
No.
Listen, uh, no.
Can you tell me why there is so much violence in the Bible?
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's a call from Gainesville. Hello.
Why there's so much violence?
