word that food 10 on 3 at 5 60 WQAM happy Thursday 2 now what did you say we were debating about
given that stuff away what was it something a tarzan passes tarzan passes but they're not the
four Friday the weekend and Monday through Thursday their what is only Monday through Thursday passes
only at the end of the year it's the summertime today is the last day of school whatever you want to
do no I'm not just slow down a minute okay don't get ahead of yourself I'm just saying that what
difference does it make what day it is now that everybody's out of school and it's summertime
and I write about that uh-huh day in F&A no but I was going to say before I was so rudely interrupted
I was going to say that we haven't given anything away on the show since I think about August
and done tremendously well by the way thank you and I think that would be like a real sellout to do
that today you know as opposed to like going over the list of the top 5,000 actors and actresses see
the deal with that and I better not say it because that'll screw up the whole thing but the deal is
it's like it's like it's just and of course it's a follow-up a year later to what they did last year
with the 45,000 best movies I mean if you're compiling your own list of like your favorite movies
of all time I can do a top five or top 10 but like how do you do the top 100 how do you decide between
what what what's what is differentiates between like number 87 and number 88 you follow what I'm saying
what kind of nuance in the movie pushes it like up about a half a point between like 87 and a half
to 87 it's ridiculous I'm on the face of it now granted it's fun and it kills a lot of time
and it gets people really pissed off and they like fight about it because they like fighting about
a lot of crappy stuff that's unimportant but nevertheless and by the way in Morning Crout
carpet munchers I'm serious I mean you know I said it yesterday and evidently well we're
getting the evidence right now you know same old crap again I mean would I ever take shots at
them on this show yeah why not I say all out war that's what I say it's gonna be a long hot
summer let's just beat the crap out of each other work the last time work like a charm huh
well of course see they let their callers do it and then they all get locked on at you yeah
they have nothing to say but beat that as it may oh this this is uh one of the great letters
every day I try to find a letter for you and either one of the papers and amazingly I'd say 95
percent of the day as I find one in the hero this morning rated our title please don't pay the
effort my neighbors from England are shocked to find a verb shagged in new acclaimed movie title teenagers
are snickering in delight they're snickering in delight that the smarmy synonym for the effort in
the film starring Mike Myers is in there how dare the producers writes key hulphman in Fort
Lauderdale the British synonym for the effort boy lethal pay the effort is in there how dare they
and then in the same paper by the way that's in the editorial page letter to the editor same
newspaper as you turn over to the business section here's a big article with a headline it says
shagvertizing in areas again Austin Powers this by who shamelessly plugs and it goes on about here's
a picture of with his milk mustache ad campaign oh I heard mommy had a milk mustache too one time
and then here over here is uh first USA visa and there's the a virgin Atlantic and all over the
goddamn place every day everybody look there's uh Mike Myers there's this Austin Powers thing
and uh all over the place don't ask me why I mean far be it for me to give my opinion about that
because you know me I'm an old buddy that he and I don't want to pee on everybody else's parade
that he's so goddamn funny is he funny oh nice you know
exactly a little bit goes along yeah yeah I mean it's the same thing over and over and over and over
and over again okay I mean it's the same with that same look and the same bad a phony bad teeth
no seriously that's what they did to make him look British they made the phony real bad teeth
because if you're British you have to have rotten teeth and it goes with the territory only the
royal family are permitted to have what appeared to be real teeth and who knows if they are for real
or not probably not they probably can't but something about the British maybe they're reading
like too much spotted dick oh probably a tea health man in Fort Lauderdale be writing a letter
to the editor Marbottes the fact that even on the talk shows now they're using British terms
like spotted dick well if it's good enough for the British to say why can't we say it it's kind
of like mama la penga if it's good enough for the Cubans to say and all the other do the Mexicans
say that oh no they just do it no seriously is that like a term that uh is indigenous to denotts
all the uh all the Julio's do that trust me so here again somebody very upset the word police
let's get those guys from Michigan what was the place standish standish Michigan let's get
those they're a little off a standish get them down here and see if they can't do something about
this guy damn Austin Powers guy and shag galantic the spy who shagged me you know I think it's a good
sign I think it's great I mean maybe just a little tiny bit we're growing up you know first it
was Monica with uh Bubba and blow jobs we finally blew her to that out oh my god you can't say blow
jobs well everybody didn't there you go thank you Bubba oh I was watching on the news last night
the wooden man even even Ron Diaz wasn't as wooden as Al Gore he's a good guy but he's as wooden as
they come he needs a personality transplant and I was thinking oh and and also then right after
right after they showed that they had the spot with Bob Doolan you know where he's doing the
Olympian spot and I was thinking of myself if you don't like Clinton's politics at least we had a
president this time who could get it up there's something to be said for that uh yeah we didn't
elect somebody who's got a limp that's not good for the American psyche okay can you see a sitting
president can you see if Bob Dool had been elected and he's in there serving out his second term
and he goes on TV it says well I have a limp but Litty uh doesn't mind because I'm popping
these pills Litty and I don't think he's talking about Litty Dool I think he's talking about G Gordon
Litty I think he's doing it can you tell me where Litty comes from by the way have you ever known
any but an indelizabeth who's been called Litty what is that all about Liz Beth oh speaking
of Beth by the way the guiding light now you'd like her even though she's a little old make-up makes
her look a lot younger definitely would like her she's now I would say the best female on that show
by a long shot Beth even though I can't stand the character she plays and her acting is like so
overdone 20 years for overacting sweetheart with a hand like everything but oh but uh Lizzy uh
well with a hand but anyway see I'm just rambling with them gonna kill some good time and I'll
pull the side the audience will let us know whether they we should give those passes away the
tarzana now is that what they're for tarzana movie maybe if we play tarzana and jane by toybox
in the background you would like uh do we have that here no anyway it's 1009 at 560 wqa m
thank you milk my jockey shorts and now thoughts do something today you've never tried before
like really putting in a full day of work you'll appreciate how much you get away with
once someone hurts you forgive them and move on unless you have a clear shot at punching them in the head
if there are no dwarfs in a circus does that mean there's a shortage of little people
how come you have to eat milk chocolate the drink chocolate milk take a few moments each day to
look back on your life and reflect why was that stupid look at yourself in the mirror and if you
think you look hot you are and if the man you're interested in won't give you the time of day
he's just gay if you think everybody is out to get you they are plant just one seed and it will
reveal a gift of nature that can be admired or stomped into the ground depending on your move that day
if you can't say anything nice about somebody make up something about their sexual preference
it's almost time to get jiggy with it
if I ever see him again it'll be much much too soon you know what I am trying to think of the people
who just get make me gag the most and they're several on the list like god direct for example
but we'll Smith I mean what was the story with him can he sing no can he and no is he like a
pleasant no he just makes me sick god oh there you go with that racist thing I don't care if he
woke up tomorrow morning his white is the fallen snow okay it don't have be having nothing to do
with that he just I find is offensive I just wrote test and just oh man not as offensive is Ricky
Martin but pretty close speaking of offensive by the way somebody faxes us 60 something year old
Jim Brown hey Jim Brown for all you jocks nippers out there great number 32 Cleveland Brown one of the
greatest running backs all those number 32s a arrested last night on felony charges for threatening
kill his 24 year old wife but he was white too by the way and he's another guy that likes white
chicks which is see there's nothing wrong with that generally speaking but there's something about
these athletes that there's certain ones again not to mention any names but they're very big
with white chicks what is that all about maybe somebody can verify that for us with the Jim Brown's
wife is whatever she might be so let's find out from the audience but let's you know because I
said Thursday it's a horrendous day I can just feel that you can smell it I can already anticipate
it but now we could play the easy way out and give away those goddamn parses and passes since we
have about 50 million of them but that would be a cop out so let's find out from the audience whether
they want us to do that or not because they will kill the show that much I guarantee you right now
there is no question whatsoever there were two things last year that were killers on this radio show
from like the middle of the summer until we stopped doing the giveaways in August to September and
that was the giveaways and number one even more than that was talking about that whammy show all
the time which nobody in listening audience wanted to see there were some people who watched it
about ten of them but those people weren't people who listened to the radio show because they had a
life or worked during the daytime so they turned it out at night to see just how ugly I was etc and
which smatha I was wearing that night and what a hypocrite I was because it was a religious thing
are you following what I'm saying so far no but those were two detrimental things so let's fight
out from these people should we give away and I'm not giving them away right now okay don't call
it say well I'll take some because we do have thirty six of them and each one is for good for two
people I let me ask you something this tarzan I'm a little bit confused didn't we just have a tarzan
with what's his name I can't think of the guy's name he's always on MTV for whatever reason you know
the guy I'm talking about you don't know the guy I'm talking about no on MTV he's always not a singer
but he's always on it for whatever reason he's like not a bad looking guy he's like I can't
think of what his name is he's definitely not on the list of the top 50 actors we did just have
a a tarzan though he did it was like a bomb this is the the cartoon the Disney thing oh this is a
cartoon this is a Disney cartoon or time who's that another doorway by the way that's got the
door cracked open there that's not ego is it that ego in the doorway no oh who was that some guy
some guy you didn't know the other guy who's very scared of you who is one of the salespeople
named not a track named oh you don't even know what his name is good we got so many salespeople
here that we don't even know their names anymore how many salespeople we got here at measly
broadcasting boys and girls how do you like that Brendan Fraser Fraser Fraser Fraser there you
go Brendan Fraser now you know who that is yes he looks adequate actor and they find looking young
men no I wouldn't say he's okay I give about a seven and a half to be late yeah he's adequate I
mean he's no you know but that was George the jungle comedy but that was a tarzan movie
the jungle man there's no you jungle man do we need any more tarzan movies no no
have we got any white cards he has an ugly guy huh haven't done it in cartoon yet who the hell
wants to see a goddamn tarzan cartoon are you out of your mind I do no you don't your daughter I do
you want to see a tarzan cartoon sure I love tarzan oh my god the one in turn you know we
open the tarzan so anyway so let's find out whether we should do giveaways and just this one time
I don't think we're gonna do it I'm very reversed to doing I know what they're gonna say what
no no I'm not I don't hear a dial tone so goddamn fast we're not giving anything away we're
doing a four play now to find out whether we should give stuff away to me that's the worst
thing you can do on a radio show I want to apologize to everybody in this town for going through that
period of time even those porn movies would give away even though it didn't reach many lives
out there in radio land I should say those adult videos you that's supposed to say porn movies
because then it sounds obscene and filthy which in America everything's obscene and filthy even
though everybody wants to see it and especially some of us want to do it but nevertheless
we'll find out come on let's go let's find out from this crowd out there you bunch of dead heads
just like I did that thing yesterday about manager Joe Rose and like you know three people I had
a force feed to have an opinion on it these people don't even have an opinion anything and you
want to know why they're not con because they're there were sitting back waiting thinking that I
will give them out and then they're gonna call right away and grab them and please stop calling
about Casper van being who is who who's the tarzan in the latest tarzan movie with Jane March which
was a very big bomb yeah he was the guy from Starship Troopers but the one in the face that wasn't
the tarzan movie no I know that movie was George of the jungle but they're so in the other way a
cartoon made a movie for the day when you made it from the god damn rope and he was running around
with a god damn leopard skin outfit on the same old crap you know yeah but he runs into things and
then he started doing the monkey WQ I am look at that these people are you're pathetic you really
are here's Kendall hello hey Neil how you doing okay sir listen I'm calling because I respect
your opinion and I like what you have to send the past about diabetes I have diabetes and
my doctor just prescribed Resolent have you heard anything about that not really no no
because there was stuff on the news they're pulling it from the mark I heard some negative things
about it yeah and I just spoke to the doctor prescribed it to me yeah and he's telling me that
it's all a bunch of false advertising all about but listen seriously instead of calling me why
does you go second opinion call another doctor I just I just want to call you and see what if you
had no but that's my advice is to get a second opinion from another doctor I'm I don't give
people life you know I mean that's when you have diabetes it's like life and death yeah
get another opinion all right okay good luck hello doctor I mean I don't want you know I'm
not belittling the guy because diabetes is a serious illness and you got to have it under
control because you go blind you lose your limbs and you know you start going little bit like that
but nevertheless find a real doctor out there and when you find one by the way let me know who it is
here's Miami hello hello Neil there's no interest in these passes by the way yes sir no giveaways please

scumbag anyway have a nice day wqa m no no no no no no giveaways please thank you what do say no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no one more no no

want those those were some of the worst shows I ever did in my life how could we easily have
of the 17 of the passes and can we have like a parking pass and a blueberry
animal? Boy, hate those people. Nothing worse than
freeloaders. Now let's talk about Ruth Chris again, how come they answer? Hey listen
though if you look if you're gonna spend first then you deserve like maybe a
little something you know a little demi-pass like I said.
WQAM? QAM? Ticket line? WQAM, hello. Yeah, how you doing? Great. Is this
meal? Speaking. All right, feel me. I got you in the first ring. Anyways I want
you to give it away and the tickets to Tarzan also. Yeah why? All right I don't
know. Sounds like a... You didn't want to yourself though did you? I mean it's a
stupid cartoon. You wouldn't go to a cartoon with you? Of course. You would go to
a cartoon? I live in Miami. You got to be a matured. Oh that's a good point. Okay well I'll
think about it. Thank you sir. Okay there's one who says give him away and he'll be
calling back in hurry if I say we'll give him away. Hey listen we can kill about
two hours doing this. Hey there's a method to my madness. I'll tell you that right
now. Okay I continue to talk about a bunch of boring sports crap and start
calling people names on a morning show like carpet muncher. We have that
here and pillowbiter. Oh yeah let's hear that. How long is it by the way? 16 seconds. Oh yeah let's hear it.
I'm 10 o'clock little pickle buffer. Why doesn't he take the call when he's
lifting out Joe like he is? All he wants is his little pillowbite is the call and
stick up on his side. He's a jerk. Joe you're absolutely right for
arguing because you're gonna work with those two guys. I don't know how you're
saying. Oh I mean that I take that as a high compliment a guy who sounds like
that. He's sucking up on Joe's side. Hey if that's the best you got on your side Joe
guess what you're in deep do do baby. You got a real serious tourist. And you know
something we just took a poll in the station there wasn't one person here that
came down on Joe's side even to people that hate death like poison all 40 of
them they said you know what kind of crap is that. But again another one
of the suckling sound like a real New Yorker with a same setting all sound the
same they all you know smell the same. Go back on a subway okay get out of
our lives. See I thought it was like maybe like a almost normal person that's a
high compliment to me. With something that's that much of an obvious scumbag with a
phony voice. Yeah you're cooper mature with the new one. But fuck it yeah. Pack this
okay you jackass. In fact just pack a small bag and get on the bus. That would be a
big favor to all of us. In fact maybe Joe could take you okay. Maybe the two of
you could like head north together or maybe do east would be good. That was great
1027 at 560 WQN if you talk dirty to me.
Alright 132 at 560 WQN we got thank Goldberg sure to a clock we got Josh Darrow at
6 o'clock tonight. How do you like that? All clarences on you like that. Yeah come on
he'll be great. He'll be great. It'll sound like over the age of 10. He's on from
6 to 8. It's filled a couple hours in here because we got nobody else. And then we got
the NHL game number five Stanley Cup championship they call it this year. We used to call it
the finals but that didn't sound like it's impressive enough. So Gary Beckman decided
well it's the Stanley Cup championship. Okay whatever you say a little tour eight o'clock
tonight Buffalo will beat Dallas. Oh man that would be great wouldn't that be something
if they beat him tonight. Well you love that. Give me sexual excitement. So anyway I you
know getting back to the carpet munching guy or whatever that guy was talking about the
pickle puffers. Let me just say this to you I would ordinarily dignify a jackass obnoxious
New York stereo typical scumbag loud mop like you but let me just say this as far as the
Joe Rose thing which I don't want to dwell on but I will anyway. See one of the things
that I find them especially a guy used to be a football player you know big jock macho
the whole deal. You can't be a pussy no matter what business you're in you have to take
responsibility for your own success or failure you can't always be looking to blame somebody
else you know. So if you have a crappy trend or a crappy rating book or whatever it is don't
be looking to blame the program director or the sales manager or everybody else or the
general manager which you wouldn't do because you don't have the balls to rip him on here
but nevertheless don't be looking to blame somebody else look in the mirror it'd be very
easy to say well we don't have any promotion on this body and our something we don't have
any promotion and we still just had the biggest guy named reading book in a history of WQIM
in a modern history of it anyway. Since way back in the days when there was only two stations
on the air and they still couldn't make 50% so how is that possible? I just I'm just not
too big on guys that are always looking for scapegoats blaming somebody else. I mean if
I'm on the air and like you know get a lot of crappy calls in the idiots and how can I blame
the people on the other side of the glass are they responsible for that? No. We got a whole
bunch of people in this radio station who have turned into emotional cripples lately I don't
know what that's all about. If you're having a crappy day you know what crap happens that's
the way it is just the way it works but don't be looking to point the thing with all the
underlings oh you're too full yeah how is it there fault are they making the calls? No.
Are they set up deals? No. So that's my best advice okay is that some of the people
are building need to grow up and take responsibility for their own success or failure. You're going
to take credit for the success don't be pointing the finger at everybody else blaming them when
you suck big time okay. I'm not blaming anybody else for those shows where I was given
stuff away those shows sucked. I apologize I'm embarrassed by those shows those shows were
worse than back in the days when I was doing those boring guests on WS News 100 years ago
and an I and Z at night hello that's that those shows I'm embarrassed by I apologize for
those I don't blame anybody else nobody how the gun to my head and say you got to put this
old fart on the air and talk to a bunch of 90 year old geriatric idiots who want to hear
some free medical advice and you know find out how to squeeze their bag the right way nobody
told me to do that I take responsibility takes a real man like yours truly to take responsibility
for your own or whatever you're going to say hey look we just had a great book fine then
when you have a crappy book don't look to blame anybody else Joe and others in this building
don't be pointing the finger at all the underlifts blame them when you're young doing a really
crappy horrible show say I suck today I'd like to have some of these people on this station
get on here and say my show yesterday suck and I'm responsible for it huh now my show yesterday
happened to be pretty good on this on this you know although we've had plenty of shows on this station
that suck and I take some responsibility for it I think mostly it's George no seriously don't
be saying that other people when you suck if I suck it's because I want a suck okay but that's
another story for tomorrow show let's see people are saying a synonym for the f-word yeah here's
thank you I can't stand will Smith is there anybody in this audience who can stand will Smith no
no everybody I know hates him like poison do the black people like will Smith no white people
yellow people purple people no eaters now they hate him who are his crowd who they be I think it's
another medium myth I think it's a conspiracy nobody likes will Smith he's just obnoxious he just
got that arrogant hostile attitude like my stuff don't stink god is he make me nauseous how come
Freddie Prince is dead and he's still alive whatever that means but it's I think it's a great
point here's pop it ob shell oh hey how you doing great hey six pounds and five days on the
act against all right hey one question to William hold the number 25 on that list yeah that's
ridiculous yeah and Peter Fincher's new violin list hey where's Peter O'Toole Peter O'Toole is
also not on the list I mean that's a that's the travesty no tools on this list their father O'Toole
is on a number 22 number 69 father O'Toole hey another question you know we can get like
copies of like the Canada Cup 72 Canada Cup and 76 Canada Cup on tape yeah in Canada like
if the world's largest bookstore you actually have real page you can get right right all right
hey can I second round for the tarzan I just had an accident squirt squirt oh my god
you see what I mean now and now you can make it if you know how to do it right this can be
re-entertaining in a very sadistic way and of course I am sadistic I'm a real sadist I love I'm
you know it's when you live in South Florida long enough you become a very kind of close
student unfriendly and be you start becoming a sadist anyone who inflicts as much punishment on
everybody else so they can be as miserable as you are because you have to be here wow that was
great by the way sir the answer is the answer is no we haven't even decided yet whether we're
gonna give them away we're doing a little full play here okay and don't throw you don't use
your daughter I love these people that use their kids as a tool okay use them as a weapon oh well
my little kid he's dying of some horrible disease we don't know what it is yet and we're not
really sure if he's got it but we think he might be dialed someday can we have the tickets no
what tickets we're not doing any tickets yet this is the four-player and so far the overwhelming
majority of people have said don't do that because if I do do it it's only because we want
persons a fault and that's George I mean mine no well he's pushing for it I don't know why you're
pushing for you gotta send them out he's getting the mailing labels all out you can in fact it's
more for you maybe goofball there wants some you know what would go see that would you
Stephanie might want to see it there you go maybe he'd like a pair and some tickets too huh
so let's give them to our friends in here if we have any that I want to go see it and not the
way start time with the audience going to see some stupid Tarzan cartoon what kind of a person
goes and see as a stars a star's a cartoon only somebody who goes because his woman you know
he's got a pacifier so maybe he might get lucky someday soon or you know or George wants to
put on a good actor his family like he's a good family man you know so anyway 21 before two by
the way I understand that we're all getting on a remember Phil Henry head that Ireland trip that
went over like a bomb because nobody believed it was for real I think we're all getting on a
plane and going to Shannon hey you what what's wrong with that Shannon Shaq Atlantic huh what do you
see now you get a little bit carried away don't overdo it you know I mean sweetheart don't get a
little too carried away see what I mean about him give him a little bit of opening up up up up up up
all these guys they're they want their own show I'm gonna tell you two o'clock today it'd be
dynamite Hollywood Seminole gave me this where they at what do you give me a look like that for he had
a crappy show yesterday I heard he had a hang show and he's blaming everybody else it wasn't because
everybody else because your collar stuck you ever had bad collars before what's wrong with you man
not a point I told you stop picking on the underlay was mister just because you lost 20 or 30 pounds
now you're a big shot just calm down and believe me you don't look that great any more than I do
everybody around here a little bit out of control like I said everything was going just great
we were on an even keel everybody was happy we had great ratings and then all of a sudden we get
one bad print or somebody farce the wrong flavor and then everybody's all bent out of shape here
must be a coincidence Greg's out of town when this is all going on too by the way is it a coincidence
no no pussy's 20 me 4 11 and 5 60 WQM I see it
this summer there's no law of illusion so you gotta see loser polo's
loser polo's 1999 no kids on the block
ss oscaritos
marky mark and the fungi and visor
guys from millions of the Auld
and
i hear
a fact from boss in the last year told you we had another out of the time
line here we get fifty million calls every day from living in breathing people
but nevertheless the fact that he still works
from scott and boss didn't says i like hearing you not give stuff away when you
give free loaders a hard time and makes my day my vote would be free to tell people
you were given the tickets away but did not actually give them to anyone who
asked for
uh... always done that before i've uh... pulled out you know
especially when we actually work in something away but had to go through about
a hundred people
uh... i don't know that's a bad
it's that statistics to be again that makes i like hearing people travel
especially for something insignificant is movie tickets you know there's nobody
listening to me right now can't afford like ten bucks for a pair of movie
tickets is there anybody no
i mean i realize that that she's a pretty expensive these days that grandma
boon but nevertheless
so thank you scott and boss didn't like that
five six seven oh five sixty i still haven't made up my definitive mind of
by the way
because i think the audience might enjoy hearing a lot of your people out there
gravel and uh... you know dehumanize yourself
i mean for ten for ten bucks worth of tickets these people do almost anything
they get out of their hands and knees and kiss my feet
oh sorry joe
here's a fact now where the hell is this this look all i see
panamocity that's what happened
a fourth grade student was reading a magazine when his teacher one the
Nelson granted the magazine that is
called it pornography ripped up the offending pages and threw them in a trash can
this was in panamocity only in america
only in prudish backwards america the magazine was national geographic
and the pornography was an article on evolution that included drawings
not pictures not photos drawings of naked humans
wow
yes today the cherry street elementary school teacher received a written
reprimand for inappropriate action
but the school superintendent didn't believe that censorship was an issue
they county school superintendent Larry Bolinger said he supported the teachers
right to stop what she considered a disruption but said she crossed the line
when she damaged the magazine
in other words it's okay to keep the kids from looking at those drawings but don't
be thrown in the trash because probably the superintendent wants to see it
later on
Sebastian Allen ten had taken his older brother's magazine a rare collector's
issue to school after miss Nelson that incurred miss
miss Nelson I asked down here once before nobody responded to it because they
don't want to admit that most of their teachers were bull dikes
miss how can you be missed I mean your miss uh whatever she was she was like
65 years old she was miss I had to teach her miss lines she was like 120
years old she was still a miss
there's something a miss here anyway he had taken the magazine to school after
miss Nelson and occurred students to bring reading material from home in case
they completed a state assessment test before time ran out so it brings in this
national geographic ten years old you think that ten year old are too young
to see drawings of naked people no I mean what are we talking about here boys
and girls ten years old is there any kid that too young to see pictures of
naked people because the message we want to send out of course is the human
body is dirty dirty dirty dirty the body forget about the sex part but I mean
just a body all by itself it's dirty especially if it's like a lot of hair
on it like an ape then it's really dirty when you know that hair collects a
lot of you know all kinds of stuff but at any rate so there you go Panama City
Florida where you'd expect to find that kind of crap going on by the way Panama
City bunch of uptight for reading the new people are talking about wow if we
forget casinos here yeah we're gonna get casinos here if you're asked we're
gonna get casinos because we got these places take a look at this state where
do you find a part of this state where there's like living and reading people
we have about what 500 of them here where else any of them in Tampa no we got four or
five over there and four Myers listening on our affiliate over there like I said
three or four Naples no got the bees leaves over there that you know it immediately
qualifies as subhuman Tampa oh no clear water no no Panama City no
Tallahassee no Jamesville say college students maybe especially if they're from
out of state there's a few but other than that the idea of living and
breathing in people people would IQ larger than their toenail in this state is so
ludicrous and we're gonna get casinos here we're gonna have like all these things
going on no we got we got license plates that say choose life and to take a
bullet for Christ we got those coming out but anything that makes sense that we
might be able to have a good time with okay all you spring breakers now Daytona's
had enough to get out of there push him up into Georgia push him up to God
them Savannah anywhere out of this state we don't want any living and
breathing people here we don't want to have a good time we want to make sure
that misery loves company and you're having it misery even even maybe we
ought to bring her here to be governor Kathy Bates she'd be a perfect governor
for the state of Florida she'd come over to your house and break your legs in her
spare time here's what is that boy beach or boi beach boy
beach where's that yes sir go ahead I say give the tickets away but only to
southern back this uh-huh I guess that leaves you out okay we're not giving away
no tickets unless we get a whole a runner people here who want them if you want
to be better call right now maybe I'll break down I doubt it but we never know
what well you're saying don't do it either I'm asking I asked you a question
not I don't answer the phone and just get addresses and stuff like that well
there's an honest answer see George never said that he broke his
Georgia's got a family to support he's like on a payroll but when you're not
making any money here I guess that's a real honest answer there right there
it's a pain in the ass taking all those names and I'll make him do it then he's
the one that's got all the address labels out five six seven oh five sixty
pound five sixty on the mobile one line it's great just great watching people
grow I want my daughter she so upset you have those tickets you're gonna share
them with us yeah share this I like to charge by the way in fact we might throw
some of that in the envelope with the tickets five six seven so you don't want
to bet enough to you now the one guy will give him credit he did ask it was
very humiliating embarrassing I'm sure a lot of people are calling him at home
right now or at the office just making all kinds of fun of them but it was worth it
for ten bucks worth a crappy ticket to some stupid cartoon movie and by the way
it's Disney which is why the guys have given to the Southern Baptist that was
cute pal just it just hit me okay I'm a little bit slow today five six seven oh five
sixty bomb a little bit slow because I'm still recovering for the abhorrent
behavior of some of our host here yesterday who were busy running around
screaming at everybody else you know we got some people here they can put on
this act of being a little bit civilized for a while you know no other
sudden than they be referred to their true form you know what I'm talking about
how do you know relax stop bitching everybody out you had a crappy show life
goes on you got a nice big fat check coming in there that big network check
coming into everything's going along great don't you know don't rock the boat
by the way speaking of disco yeah within my barbers here this morning and they
had and by the way guess what song air be where I go I mean you can't get away
from it in fact I'm almost getting tired of it is the goddamn backstreet
board the single you know I mean it's a great song but enough already I mean
just enough there's other great songs that an album and that by the way was one
of the first forty five thousand times but now just give it a rest wow so anyway
my I'm sitting there getting my haircut and on the radio I must have been
Y 100 because it sounded like a real bunch of simple things on there and they
were talking about Donna summer when they have done a summer on Y 100 is she
got like a new hit or something she does I guess that's what they were playing
anyway they were talking about well isn't it great that she was never stalked
and she was never getting all that bad public and I'm thinking to myself who
the hell is really ever heard until her little comeback here she was my
barber said she was doing gospel records there for a while you know that's how
desperate she was because everybody was running around with the trendy thing to
say disco stuff even though everybody loved disco but everybody had a
while saying disco stuff because they figure if you said that you like
disco that made you a faggot and of course it did because like it seems like
everything else you want to know how to dress turn to the faggot's okay you want
to know about music turn to the faggot you want to know about show business movies
art all that turn to the faggot now some people would say well if you want to
know about music turn to the Schwarzenegger because everybody's rapping it all
the young white guys and they're talking like guys Schwarzenegger listen to their
music but see basically white people don't have anything you know heterosexual
white people have no culture they had nothing of their own they steal everything
from somebody else that's an excellent point that I just made even I'm impressed by
it never really thought about that before other than maybe Elvis maybe that's why Elvis
is so high on that list because he's a who wasp he was a wasp he was a good old
country boy redneck who used to sleep with mommy till they were about 35 yeah what's
wrong with sleeping in the same bed with mommy till you're like 40 I don't you know
it's a little crowded but here's a mobile in top of no hello yeah how you doing today great you
want some tickets now give them to tell you guys 25 mothers and yeah and I paid four or five
of the swam satin the local flexion today we had to call about the preacher we got another bad
preacher okay thank you let me say four or five local section okay I'll dig it up in the
break valve whatever you say not another bad preacher it's just another isolated incident
there's no fact in the church five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line
I got a great fact from my nourished you ever get a fact from a guy named Nuret before no no
who is in Israeli those Israelis you talk about the sparsas haven't strange names those
Israelis like Yitzhak didn't Sean say his brother's name was Yitzhak but that's in Hebrew we don't
do Hebrew like Nahman my name is Nahman it's got a good and oh there's another one mmm delicious
Nahman I love that choose it got strange names sparsas I got really funky names I like
Moisha I would say all the names in America my favorite is definitely Moisha what be your favorite name
huh all right now see it's interesting that white people like to like the rap music and white
kids they like speaking to the nigger thing hey nigan all this other but you don't see white people
yet naming their kids Moisha not yet now maybe if your springer stays out long enough it might start
the you know putting into trailer parks can't you just see white white kids in trailer parks name Moisha
I like it five six seven and maybe mofo your money five six seven oh five fifty pound five
sixty on a mobile line do I sound a little incoherent today I don't know what that is I don't know
why I'm so incoherent maybe it's because I have to go to mommy's for lunch today and a little
bit off my feet that might be it now I'm not like the guy the guy who goes and printing on other
people's right is not business what you do is up to you why some folks parents the army I thought
this country was free as far as what anybody else likes to do I like to smoke it's me relax and I'm

from one of our listeners out there I can't divulge the source but it's a very credible source so
the rumor is that and maybe that's why he went ballistic yesterday maybe he was looking to get
canned but the rumor is that Joe Rose is leaving the morning show okay that's a rumor I
just heard passed to me by a very authoritative source so we'll find out maybe which might open
the door for yeah there you go we've been waiting he's been waiting in the wings for a long time
for that call yeah so we'll be tuning in tomorrow just to make sure because I hear it's like
imminent like any second here's Hollywood hello hello Nilo him speaking how are you

screw blend is God yeah screw lens apiece of crap yeah but say you know it's how he got
such another stupid penalty there at the end toward the end of the game like he used to with the
Panthers last two years I know he got rid of my said good ridden the bad rubbish yeah but say it
in verse okay thank you got it the first time sir it was weak the first time and then to repeat it
that's like unconscionable see I could just let that go on and on and then blame somebody else
for the fact that was a real crappy boring call but I'm not going to do that you know what I'm saying
I don't like everybody else like I said 5 6 7 0 5 60
5 60 on the AT&T wireless line I just dumped that I dumped myself is that what the third time
I've ever done that no I promised I wouldn't say that okay and I died and always keep my promise
most of the time that was bad it just kind of like slipped out but it just I just one of those
things you know when the prayer I'm like I said yesterday one bad trend and right away everybody
around here that was doing so great now all of a sudden they're starting to get like real you know
like that what's gonna happen if we have another bad trend and whatever it comes out in a couple of
weeks what's gonna happen then huh you can just only imagine the psychosis going on this building
just relax I think you'll be able to hold a seminar I'm a good student I learned the hard way
I don't give a sh** that's right through all those months of grief and screaming and yelling and
carrying on and getting the phone slammed out of me by Bill Tanner which at least has saved me for
having to speak then again by the way because you do understand this is the Tanner building
where we're going here is West Miami hello hello Neil yes sir uh pick report from West Miami
the cops busted I was getting the oil change the other day and the cops busted a guy out doing
stuff in the bathroom at jiffy Louvre yeah and while jiffy Louvre is even placed to do it I guess

work no giveaways please I hate those people that call they want their sweet lollies feel the sweet
low from the restaurants and they want free tickets God bless you sir and don't still too much jiffy

on the AT&T wireless line so far it's unanimous except the course for the free loaders who want
the tickets and I you know something and I might actually give some away here today I just pick
and choose one two appear line two wants tickets I already saw that I'm way ahead of you now see I
already did your favor by dumping the other thing out to just relax okay just stay calm I'm way
ahead all you people I'm so far ahead that's the problem I keep looking back but there's nobody
there five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT see if the audience really understood
what I'm not half of the stuff I'm talking about then I'd really be doing great or maybe be in
big trouble where's the uh facts I was talking about my Israeli friends what don't I do with that
so much good crap here today man and a lot of bad stuff too most of the factions that commit oh
here it is it's right here on top or it was it says dear Neil I heard you for the first time about
12 years ago this is our Israeli friend by the way who starts out by going oh I heard you for the
first time about 12 years ago in visiting the states from Israel my father gave you a hearty
recommendation telling me you were astounding so I listened to this day I all I recall is Pope
madness the pope was on his way here and you were in a frenzy I must admit I was astounded
I'm astounding and he was astounded what do you expect I'm astounding you should be astounded
so much so that I took your show back with me to Israel and tried to pedal it and Hebrew format
look at this they're even trying to rip me off in Israel I do you like that
Israel needed a good political religion the bashing radio station so I nagged and nagged and failed
oh there's mark mostly standing in the doorway so it's always good there's a wonderful good
people from power 96 image go griffin are there any other ones no no anyway it says they looked at
me contemptuously and they said they had heard of you and don't want they don't want such as you
nothing personally we're just too kind of heard of we don't want his kind on the air over here
is what they were trying to say got so close is what they said and they call their radio station
the voice of peace ha he says with an exclamation point I love that don't you let's all have all the
things that you see like in comic books you know it's like power like a Batman you know
power bam things that nobody ever says or makes those sounds but nevertheless ha anybody you
know ever say ha no no only at the dentist anyway to make this story long story even longer I'm
back here in Miami it'll be three years since I've arrived here every fresh breeze in the sweltering
decaying city I enjoy listening to your acrid brutally honest with unfortunately I can't leave
Miami so don't you leave either always a matter of fact now that you mentioned that Joe Rosen
I believe in the duet we constantly hear all the bad and corrupt I merely wanted to praise you for
all the good and compacted perhaps hopeful triumph over his experiences Samuel Johnson said whatever
that means listless in Miami and I'd rather recall a listless in Miami than Nuret because Nuret
is like what kind of a name is that that's almost as bad as Moisha don't be picking on Moisha again
we'll get that guy called again from Liberty City who was also iconic because he thought it was a racist
I don't care if you're like purple okay if your name is Moisha I can say it's
God changes eight minutes after 11 at 560 WQAM have we given any tickets away yet no I'm sure
thinking about it I got my thinking cap on I might just do it if somebody sucks real hard you know
if somebody gets me just in the right frame of mind mix up some cocka-mamae story I might give
away some of those tarzan to that great Disney carzan cartoon it's Disney so it must be great
and it's probably part of that homosexual agenda too by the way is this one more tarzan like
keeps dropping his one cloth on the ground I think that's the one
so it can't keep his packer in his pants
I think I can do drag city I go to the third world and path around the club on who be fired
my game

so both of you get off here I'm ready to talk about you mean you can't play no guitar
oh
I'm 15 to 5.50 WP so I almost forgot by the way yesterday thanks to our good close personal
friend Nick and Mike and all our uh William down there at Nick's cigars they brought all these
fantastic cigars up here including a box of Cuban bullets remember I have two are these real
strong and you said no and you were right because I smoked one on the way home and god they're great
these are in fact I think I like these even better than the prodoma reserve Cuban bullet there's
nothing I took a Cuban bullet surprise that's right pop that baby right in my purse
mm I'm so I'm just gonna like suck on one here during the show just to keep it you know in my
they got this aroma like something really interesting in there very good thank you Nick and Mike
and you guys pop a Cuban bullet in your mouth this week here and now let's do this lady she's
in waiting on their wild and four-lotterdale because I have a feeling she might want something hello
Neil yes hi Neil I listen to you I'm not a first time caller and I'm not a first time listener
and I think I deserve tickets for what for my daughter now what do I mean why do you deserve them
what what do you mean you deserve them because I'm a royal listener mm-hmm yeah so can I go can I get
what do I have to do to get to take a meal because because you listen yeah you deserve them see the way
you said that it came across I don't think you really intended to sound that arrogant you know like I
listen so therefore I deserve the ticket that just sounds yeah well let's take a vote what do
you think should she get them okay you don't get them five six seven oh well I just there was a
vote of one I'm the committee here and I decided she's not gonna get them I just didn't like the
way she but she broached that whole thing you know just like I'm a loyal listener therefore I
deserve them know you I appreciate you being a loyal listener you listen because you like this show
and I give me some free entertainment here every day that should be enough of a reward the price
is right to listen to show and it's otherwise got awful boring damn place but I mean to say like I
deserve them because I listen I mean that's just not good if you had something really creative like
my daughter's got a bad hang nail or something or I just broke my nails oh by the way hi to my good
friend Sylvia again oh I forgot the good news yesterday I left here and go through the turn
bike and here's my close personal friend Sylvia I said hey Sylvia I was talking about you today oh I
know I was listening and she gave me like a pad on the hand I said don't touch sweetheart I love you
saw Sylvia and then going home guess who I saw in my neighborhood yesterday will give me a big
friendly wave Rick the mail man oh right no it's funny because I saw him pulling out and the
mail truck too from the side street see how was that possible I don't get home at exactly the same
time every day and yet Rick the mail man is always pulling out from one of those side streets just
at the moment that I'm driving up to my house I don't understand that he must like sit off the edge
of the road they're waiting you know looking down the street to see what I'm coming and then pull
out there you know so we can like flip me off or whatever but yesterday they gave me a big wave
and I was like chuckling as soon as I saw the mail truck pull out because I thought to myself well
now is the moment of truth he almost turned it off but he couldn't get his hand quite on at
knob soon enough so where he's still listening I scroll and Rick you're high book just don't shine
me again I mean I usually don't give a crap on anybody thinks but there are a few exceptions and
Rick the mail man he's one when he starts when I'm when he turns his back on me then I know I'm
finished and I can't blame it on anybody else like certain other people on the station are always
blaming everybody else for their crappy shows five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the
AT&T wireless line no seriously I know it's not personally there it's business not personal like
headcaplin I love that capillaries a great guy but I happen to be in the car last night and I'm
going to tell you something oh have you ever oh please I realized there's an emergency they had
nobody to fill there until a moral game which didn't start so much later on last night but oh
I mean a shameless not just a gambling show I want to retract what I've said before I joke about
being the headcaplin gambling show and it like and I think I'm joking about I'm not it's not a joke
I wish I had the calls from that show the first three or four calls I mean right out of the box
hey that's San Jose State Sacramento game that volleyball game what do you what do you think the
over I got the under on the angels they they could put like a hidden mic at mugsy Solomon's
bookie joint and it would be basically the same as the headcaplin show how could we possibly have
that on there before ten o'clock I think the FCC should pass a law that had caplin even though he's
a great guy and we love him he should not be allowed on here before ten o'clock at night because
at least anybody who's listening after ten o'clock at night it's okay to have the GA crowd because
anybody else has got a real life they're not listening to the radio after ten o'clock at night are they
no no way Jose I mean that this was just uh exactly I'm speechless about it yeah
okay ticket central here's a mobile and four-letter mail hello hey good afternoon sir
yes sir good evening I'm down the copus now but I just want to thank you you should put me
on before the lady because I wanted to thank you I went over the neck I saw Mike yesterday right
and he gave me that extra 10% off for Theresa great and I just called the thank you sir and God bless
him boy do you have you tried these Cuban bullets nobody gave me one I'm gonna try it tonight
he gave you a Cuban bullet you know to do that well you survived it okay no I'm serious this is I
I mean everybody's got different taste but to me this is a great cigar oh they got great cigars
down I call away them from sunrise to go down the one I'm down in that area all right I go down
the roll of time for them they go they're great thanks a lot pal thank you but see you there you go
that's one of my people drives all the way from sunrise all the way down there to Miami to take a bullet
for a Nick now with that girl did out there as she took a bullet for Nick that for Christ sake for Nick
5 6 7 0 5 60 Palm 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line and nobody letting your little 10-year-old kids
say no to the National Geographic with drawings of naked and by the way what kind of National Geographic
only has drawings of naked people in it huh I thought that's the only reason that people bought
National Geographic was for the pictures of naked people in it they didn't have many pictures of
cavemen what does that mean that's what the drawings were of I don't know you're missing my point
you don't understand what I'm saying in other words if those were offensive what about the other
pictures you'd expect to find in a National Geographic about all those naked yeah you bangies
what hey listen I mean it's a genetic thing people can't help it if they have thick lips unless
of course they're doing something to intentionally stretch them now that's an interesting point
and there's a lot of guys out there who would appreciate a nice young lady with very thick lips
huh now I'm sure they will I mean when you say don't give me no lip I mean don't say that so fast
before you think about the implications man don't lip off to me oh gee as soon as said that again
do you know what I said I said lip off don't say that should I say that again no I'll be saying that
woo we'll be we'll be back to square one all over it but but but but but we want the page stop it
yeah just calm down just calm down and grow up that's my advice for some of the people in this
town calm down and grow up not necessarily in that order now what they do those African tribes they
have those lips or they put those like some people have a bone in their nose they put like a
bone in their lip anybody ever have a bone in their lip well put it any right no and then they
they have all those things what do they put in there and then they do this and yeah they they
stretch it way out oh they put a block of wood in there why what is that is it considered
lovely oh it's good oh look at that you're beautiful man wow yeah that's the most beautiful
long lip I ever seen in my life five six seven oh five sixty so now maybe there's I don't know I see
that I don't want this is a sensitive issue okay I don't want to start getting called all kinds of
names again but you do notice that in America there are many black people not not the the islands
people also have that are just the African Americans do like Jamaicans do Jamaicans have like a
little loose lip yeah what's good to hide your weed in there I guess huh oh yeah when you've got
just don't want to swallow any seeds because then they come out back don't say may they go in just
like corn but at any rate no seriously it's a it's an interesting thing there and of course it's
much too sensitive to have an intelligent mature conversation about that about thick and there
are there many black people for example now come on guiding on yeah young in the horny he don't
have those big thick you bang he lips doesn't know of course he's like white I think really he just
has a suntan but the thick lips I think that's like an African thing let's find out about the
Haitians and Jamaicans have thick lips excellent topic here's the crawlgables hello Neil yes sir
going I'm not the correct you on something you said right ahead I make lots of mistakes I have a
co-worker they named their kid show frame excuse me chef Fran Florene and their last name is O'Reilly
boy wow and it's already started it's starting and they look into that gangster rep and they're
they're even they're even talking about converting to Islam so in other words all of that's okay
as long as they don't move into their neighborhood is that what they're basically saying yeah basically
they're they're the middle class want to be black people they're white people who want to be black
right maybe maybe maybe we could have like national switch day when all the all the white people
who want to be black and all the black people who want to be white like all of a sudden wake up
and somebody stood like somebody steps their fingers and by the being you know I know and and
well next thing we got to do we got to switch Lenny Kravitz I mean we got to switch Lenny Kravitz

am I ever going to use them I couldn't care less about some stupid cartoon you know here's a great
fact by the way that I think it's got some interesting and debatable points it says here's the reason
that jocks and wealthy playboys always prefer white chicks it says white chicks are always shaved
bade and sweet smelling the best breast and receptive nipples are reactive nipples I'm sorry
they're into oral anal by responsive and orgasmic non-religious del party all night and love
dildos and they have the number one ass vacuum of any race Spanish chicks however says facial
hair sideburns and mustache and legs loose ass long lips talk a lot about their family not horny non
reactive nipples Spanish chicks black chicks it says smell like cheap lotion and have non-reactive
nipples black chicks smell like cheap lotion and Asian chicks have a bony ass smell like garlic
and it says hair in private is six inches long there you go oh it's not to like
five six seven oh five sixty five sixty on the AT&T wireless line unbelievable here's Miami hello

see it now at this ratio by about the middle of the next week when now this these
tickets are good for when George they're good for when Friday uh through the engagement
to who's engagement the movie's engagement which is what what does that mean for as long as it's
in other words for as long as it's in there but based on what I hear you better go see it quick
now it'll probably be around a long time it's a Disney movie and of course those Disney movies don't
we love Disney yeah we love Disney just because he pisses off the Baptist let's go to a Miramar hello
mobile in Miramar 17 and a half minutes they're still on there and they're not responding how do you
what is it hello yes sir yes okay you gave those tickets where already yeah yeah I don't want the tickets

guys over there publics or the lady in the told Plaza or maybe your mailman Rick the mailman I bet
you'd like to take one of his kids course I think his kids are probably like 25 but nevertheless
anyway that's a good idea take it give them the people who are nice you know there you go yeah
you know that's right because these people we talked to on the phone there are none of us we know who
they are they might be assholes for all we know you know am I right well hey goodby which is
oh anyway the main reason why I was calling I've been out of time for quite a bit and I was calling
regarding this rumor you were talking about a couple months ago you mean what about your
Rose leaving the morning show yeah I'm a big dog fan I was wondering about the Bolton Kaufman
if he's he doing a rise you coming to Miami or what yeah he's coming to Miami he and
him and OJ they're gonna have dinner with Roy all right man that's gonna improve our
afters big time yeah and the Bolton Kaufman's coming and LT he's coming too he figured this is
good the place of good stuff 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line what just don't
worry about Napoleon Kaufman okay he'll be all right he'll fit in just fine he's gonna come and give
Jimmy whatever he wants where we going by the way you read that thing a few weeks ago about how Jimmy
has never said to his lovely a girlfriend or fiance whatever you call her he never has said I love
you I mean that's between them but why would you tell a reporter I've met just to be a hard
ass is that it in other words just lie down in the spread your legs in the let's do it and then
let's get back to a diagram and football plays you know I mean what what what is that what kind of
a picture is that that somebody wants to make of themselves then he never told his which he's
engaged or something they're gonna get married but he never told her he loves her maybe he doesn't
love her you know maybe he doesn't love maybe can't stand her other than he likes to get laid
once in a while I have no idea what that's all about you think Jimmy likes to get laid once in a
while here's Miami hello because he's an asshole is that it I want to touch all the topics from a
day or so ago too your experience of Ruth Chris yes I think that I'm actually going to get a
response on that I don't want to touch three days to do it well you know they're a little slow I know
little slow is the sun and the heat and rain but you know if you go there all the time and
and you're pretty much a regular and all the people blitz yeah I don't give them angels in that they
should be you know kind of like they said you're at video what do you think the doctor is looking
each cheek that's right the Rogers can I get you this can I do this right can I buff it a little
bit whatever you know fun I mean that's a bunch of crap pretty lame I think yeah I thought it was a
pile of crap but I want to talk about another restaurant and it's your buddy um and maybe I want
to ask you your experience when you go to pizza off the food is great yeah but 20 minutes half
time left there last night man big time like a fifth time I went there is this something
lost or something well you know Jeff wants it to a public service he goes there's a lot of elderly
people here that have not a real good bm and so at no extra charge it's almost guaranteed it's

request for you yes sir how about that the F thing okay appreciate it you got it if I can

neighborhood mom and pop bus cigars store he gets in his automobile he drives all the way down to

that I like even better you know it's got to be pretty damn good the Cuban bullet I put one of those
in my put you know something I think I'm walking into mommy's house today she's always bitching
to me about smoke which I don't smoke a lot of cigars anymore one here we know and then bitching
and bitching it if it's not that it's something else I should walk in there smoking this doggy with

her out stop those lectures before they start but anyway check out the Cuban bullets at next and
all the other great cigars they got the dos rios la tradition san Jose those in men'sos for those
who like to pretend it got something big at least it's in your mouth will you fudge back in perhaps
one of the most interesting words in the english language today is the word out of all of the
english words that begin with a letter f is the only word that is referred to as the f word
it's the one magical word just by its sound can describe pain pleasure hate and love
f*** as most words in the english language is derived from germans the word flikin which means
to strike in english f*** falls into many grammatical categories as a transitive verb for instance
john f*** surely its meaning is not always sexual it can be used as an adjective such as john's doing
all the f***ing work as part of an adverb surely talks too f***ing much as an adverb enhancing an
adjective surely is f***ing beautiful as a noun I don't give a f*** as part of a word abso f***
unludely or inf***ing credible and as almost every word in a sentence f*** the f***ing f***ers
this you must realize there aren't too many words with a versatility of f*** as in these examples
describing situations such as fraud I got f***ed that they use carlot this may all f*** it
trouble I guess I'm really f***ed now aggression don't f*** with me buddy dismissal
why don't you go outside and play hide and go f*** yourself I'm sure you can think of many more
examples say it loudly and proudly f*** you all right okay it's eleven forty five at five sixty
double to q and we got the hang goldberg show in the studio at two o'clock this afternoon
that's right then we got what's his name Josh Darrell we got clearance at six tonight you know
it clearance is a good guy but how can he do it a show well if Josh Friedman can do a show on

one of the other ones I think uh Michael Pecker that little pecker is gonna get one tonight
five so you see and you notice I gave away one pair of tickets I finally broke down and you
noticed the diminishing response now several people dropped off because they've lost their
respect for me because I didn't stand by my guns I shouldn't have given a guy I don't know what
it is why did I give that guy the ticket it was you just struck me during a moment of weakness
tickets to see a Tarzan cartoon I mean what what kind of a person in the first place calls up
a radio show wait and believe me the ones if I if I actually had gone ahead and given those out
which number one I'd lost 90% of the audience but number two you think people would hang on forever
for those yeah you bet what is that that's from the movie oh like I said sounds pretty good to me
no no no sounds like crap let's have some movies for adults for crying out loud without Ron Jeremy

funny huh yeah what's wrong with them are they like against freedom of speech is I have no
idea you know I'm just glad we have a little off tight they don't want no rabble roses over there
they got enough trouble other wrong okay as far as the tickets I don't want them they make a
suggestion yes I don't know how many pairs you have left I have several pair okay why don't you do
this I have the phone number for women in distress here why don't you send them a couple pair women
in distress sure for you know some abuse women or kids they'll like have a little fun abused women
and you want you want I want you to stop and think about this okay here are people now listen to me
here are people taking their kids to go to see a movie and now all of a sudden the movie's about
to start and a whole bunch of distressed women all stressed out tears running down their eyes all
you know go and like that come in with their little kids I don't think so sir but you know your
hearts in the right place can you believe that women in distress are we giving our tickets to
women in distress no absolutely not under any circumstances we want to give these tickets the happy
people this is the happy show we're not going to give stuff to like handicapped people and distressed
people and unhappy people and suicidal people and people like days away from death we don't want to
do that this is this is your make happy station it's part of the whole deal now right yeah just
put out the most colored glasses and look around to give you everything is beautiful like
race even says that's a right it's who they're at q a m because we realized that there's a lot of
horrible things going on out there but I don't give a sh** me more that's right I mean if you're
going to adopt the attitude you got a light one up sit back and just put your feet up on the desk
and then of course once the months you start oh by the way don't forget if you guys want lunch go
ahead because I'm going to mommy's today and I sure don't want to spoil my appetite for that good
lunch she does cook good the conversation is always a little bit lacking but the food is great
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line medical marijuana defense
of indicated this is from a few days ago I'm sure you saw this speaking of the wicked weed speaking
of that evil weed that's illegal you know I said the other day I'll say it again I think that the
the thing up there in standard Michigan where the guy he's going to be sentenced in about a week
but he stands to go to jail for 90 days and get a hundred dollar fine for public cursing
which is the same first defense for marijuana possession I think I think it's appropriate I think
it's just it's perfect the idea that for things as ludicrous as public cursing and smoking a little
weed that they have any penalty at all so I think it's a great parallel there it shows you the
mentality of people that make laws like that the fact that we live in a country we're smoking marijuana
where we have to have all these things and you have to show that you're doing it for medical purposes
of course because you're implemented and even people who aren't tremendous pain and are dying
over there even they can't get it in a lot of states how do you like that however the Florida
Supreme Court said they decided not to hear a case involving a 61 year old man who smokes marijuana
to keep his glaucoma at bay which means that six people in Florida can continue to argue in court
that their marijuana use is medically necessary how do you like that so you got to make up a good story
you got to put a patch over your eye or something like that or go in there drooling when you go to court
like that drooling and say oh I'm gonna have my pot or else I'm gonna like be drooling all over the
place and like some kind of a babbling idiot okay here you go in fact here's some good addresses for
they've got a good deal this week right down there on 441 right near QAM right there and then
little Jamaica that's why we got the station here okay everybody is building smokes up a store man
this is weed central USA right here at QA even power 96 and I bet you those crap kickers over there
the kids I bet you they're smoking up a storm too huh that's what what not what not sunny Fox oh not
sunny not sunny Fox oh no no not sunny Fox I'm not gonna start on sunny Fox okay because it brings back
so many bad memories of that morning show that run and run debacle over there at Paxing
actually he was okay on that show you know he was okay there was nothing wrong with any
you know I didn't want to see him every day but he was all right and he just wasn't what they were
looking for they wanted to bring in that other kid who used to make fun of his crippled kid all the time
the one who had Down syndrome and used to call his kid a crib on here that was that was very
pleasant talking about the insensitive to oh god what a jackass that guy was five six seven oh five

there was in no farmer who's on a ride he's had in the middle just shaking his chest that some boys
who were down by the frick they're beating the water there is on their marbles and play things
and at half past four there came a young lady she looked like a pretty young creature she sat on the
she pulled up her dress and she showed them her rubble and leases and white fluffy duck
she said she was learning a new way to bring up her children so they would not spit while the boys
in a barnyard were shoveling rep you send later from yesterday's heart one of girls in the
middle was rubbing her eye let the fellow down by the dot he looked like a man with a side of the
home in the country with a big fence out front if he has her phone lightly she'd show him her
netto pet dog who was subject to fence and maybe she let him grab hold of her small tender and with
the movement so quick and then she bent over and sucked on his candy so tasty made a butter
sky and then he spread wood pre-mall over her cookies that she had left out on her shelf
if you think this is dirty you can go fuck yourself out
bubble three at five sixty WQM we're back we're back in a group now you know Joe had
that explosive thing yesterday I can understand he's getting ready to move on to other things
speaking ready to move on to other things wait till you're this I guess you read this already
from a casino stand about Henry Barrow what somebody had called about but it's much more interesting
when you read in print Henry Barrow a WQ no let me try it again a W I P a news anchor for 29 years
and for two decades color announcer from Miami Dolphins I didn't know he's colored now
boom's his baritone in the wine department gardeners markets oh Barrow sixty three retired from
broadcasting in March after 41 years in a biz new gig wine sales consultant for the four

O-E-N-O-P-H-I-L-E wine a file wine a file oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh a pet a file
as a resident wine a mauguzzler he guides patrons through the block the blocks burgundies and
boredows the pressure the pressure of having a newscaster ready every half hour something I don't
miss said Henry and he also said by the way that morning sure really sucked Neil was right
did he say that oh no come on you did so I somehow feel responsible for that but you know
something I take some credit for it because of the fact that we had that awful call from that
what was that ball-headed asshole's name they called that day and uh about the ratings mark
she leave it to me I know I know like a book called I owe you better some really interesting
things in a rating so we went and looked up the ratings and you know after a year you left the
whole audience was like gone and that next Monday Henry was also gone so what can I tell you
here's a horrendous story I know it's just another one of these isolated incidents Christian
brother convicted of 19 sex and physical abuse charges St. John's Newfoundland or his Bob
Coles say San John a Christian brother who taught at the Mount Cacheal orphanage for three years
has been convicted of 19 counts of sexual and physical abuse Ronald just in LASIK
maybe he was on LASIK a LASIK had been charged with 24 counts of abuse more than any other
religious brother implicated in the Mount Cacheal scandal a Newfoundland Supreme Court jury
found him guilty on Saturday of six counts of buggery oh that's a great word don't you love that
buggery that's a great word go bugger yourself two of indies in the salt five of common assault and
six other counts of assault for offenses that occurred more than 40 years ago but the jury

asher he's really ticking me off what is that you can't go by the guy with her them flopping down
like that guy that fell out of the NCR roof there and they killed him I needed that in the Toronto
series he's not so much now he's not doing anything he's doing here is he's like come away out of the
because uh you know he's I don't know what that's all about he better stay home he better stay
there in the net stay there in the blue a Dominic yeah he's got a good burn because you know
years ago you could go after the goal and give him a little check in the corner now that
yeah like there were addresses for Christ right and uh another thing the uh he's not going to get
burned he'll be just fine don't don't worry about him he knows what he's doing there's a
fact that his madness I don't know what it is but there's a method there's somewhere well I agree
we have three two for the Buffalo and I think Peckle will score two I think he's the best player on
their team shitan and uh shitan is great you know I'm gonna tell you shitan is if there's such a thing
as a beautiful hockey player he's just watching the way he skates in the moves he makes in the shots
he takes he's great shitan is tremendous yeah didn't I tell everybody all season long there's one
kid who was highly underrated he makes only 850 grand a year highly underpaid uh steel of a dealer
in Buffalo and scores 40 goals for the uh savers oh yeah he's great player like sander so I like sander
sander sander sander good like I said if he would play hard every game he'd be great but uh he shows
up whenever he feels like it hey fast yes he is crazy fast hey nil did you catch that on cbc
about the game I think it was for the good of the game where all the managers are talking about
changing the rules yeah yeah where did that into crease rule get rid of it that's exactly right
rid of it I guess what they're gonna do now they're gonna say they're still gonna do it you know
with the replay but then the uh referee is gonna decide whether or not the uh guy in the crease had
any effect impact on the goal which is stupid just get rid of it okay just get it out of there
if there's a man in the free if there's goal interference fine and uh the waves of all off but
otherwise they'll cut the crap how do they get away with the police not yes how do they get away
with talking the did you hear some of the words coming out of their mouth there at that meeting no
they were they were they said the sh word be me on cbc yep on that cbc they can say that I have a word
they want that's right oh yeah that's the Canadian way man they don't care I love it right

roundabout way to do it uh five six seven let's find some other privilege kids to give them some

there in the barn in the train as well like that they whistle and a horse peas on command of course
I'll do that too if there's like ice in the urinal ten minutes after noon and it's fresh ten minutes
past noon with five now let me find this out before we go to shulas we better find out if there's
ice in the urinal because if there's no ice in the urinal am I going no oh away
oh
yes
a
place. It's film
If anybody has yet to come in, that's 21-year-old chick that he got on a plane in
Chicago.
Did we tell you about that?
I'd better tell you again.
Boy, you know, it's not like a little extra bonus when it comes in here with the free
food we get to your all these sizzling stories.
Anyway, speaking of that, a onafile.
Thank you, David, and broken, by the way.
Am I pronouncing that right?
I get real nervous about mispronouncing words.
An onafile is a person who loves wines, just like a pedophile is a person who loves children.
Comes from the Greek word, oinus, oinus, meaning wine.
And it says, thank God for the unit in real audio because I can't get AM radio otherwise
in the office.
I mean, see, that's one of the great things about being on an AM.
And that's why most of our calls are on mobiles, by the way, because nobody inside of a
building, anyone here, this goddamn radio station.
Okay, thank you, David, so it means, comes from the Greek word, oinus, meaning wine.
And be sure and try the wine.
Nice go to Henry, he's doing it.
Nice game.
Just like that cigar Dave, that asshole.
Boy, he really is too, you know?
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 65.
We were talking to our good friends down there with Nick's last year, but we went down
there the first time.
Talking about Dave Zeppelwitz or whatever his name is cigar Dave.
And Nick said, oh, yeah, I know him.
He's an asshole.
Yeah.
And then Mike said, oh, yeah.
He's an asshole.
And then the old Nick yelled out from the other room.
He's an asshole.
Yeah.
They really got the far it up and pissed off about Dave, that about cigar Dave.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 0, and by the way, before we continue.
So getting back to our 8,000 best actresses and best actors, I was thinking about this
last night.
What, how can you do this?
It's an impossible list.
I mean, you can have your favorite actors and favorite actors.
It's like maybe five, five or six or, you know, but to say that one is better than
the other, that Humphrey Bogart is the best actor whoever lives.
Oh, my God.
And of course, the thing again was their debut had to occur before 1951 or whose debut occurred
after 1950, but who produced a significant body work before their death.
So in other words, if they were a debut before 1951 and they're still alive, that's just
still okay.
But if they started after 1952, they got to be dead.
You got that so far?
Peter Finch, by the way, is dead.
Somebody must have forgotten to tell them.
Because Peter Finch, I know with no John Wayne, thank God.
Or Gene Kelly.
Gene Kelly was an actor.
No.
Gene Kelly was one of those silly dancing people like Fred Astaire and Dottalo Conner.
He wasn't an actor.
Gene Kelly was a great actor.
That's an insult.
James Dean, you know how many movies James Dean made by the way, don't you?
Three.
Three movies that the Fag made.
I mean, I mean, James Dean, the Queen made three movies and then he died, that car crash.
So how could James Dean possibly be one of the greatest?
Another height job, okay?
Another one was big height jobs.
Three movies.
He made Rebel Without A Cause, giant with that fat Liz Taylor.
What was the other one?
Those are two of them.
Somebody will know.
Not that it makes any difference.
He only made three freaking movies and he smelled real bad too, by the way.
That's what his boyfriends said.
He stunk.
Robert Mitcherman, he was good.
I mean, there's some good people on this list.
Don't get me wrong.
Catherine Hepburn is the best actor.
I blurred it out Betty Davis yesterday only because she's the number two on there and
she's better than Catherine Hepburn.
I couldn't take it the best after actress of all time.
It's a silly pull, but like I said, it kills a lot of great time and we're really bored
in this country.
So let's argue about this frantically, fanatically.
How about Elvis?
I mean, if he's the most important person of the 20th century, he must also have been the
best actor, right?
Yeah, he was great.
All those great Hawaiian movies.
Here's Davy.
Hello.
Bell 4 is definitely in the bag for tonight.
Yeah.
Watch those panther, see who finds the penalty box first.
And you sound awfully damn good on siteban.com.
I couldn't believe this.
You can listen to it down on a radio.
Yeah.
It's got you live on the radio at this website siteban.com.
That's how I found you.
Right.
That's the, do you really believe that this is going to go seven theories, seven games?
All I know is the longer it goes, the better that is for Buffalo.
Because I tell you this Dallas team is old, old, old, baby.
Geek carbono and Brian Scruelin and that Benoit.
I hope that frog was coming back tonight and my keen and all these other old ancient guys
they got on that team.
Old man.
That's what they did.
They had downloaded what WOLLE at siteban.com before the game.
So you can hear them pirate it before the game.
These pirate and P3 downloads.
Yeah.
And it's often said that right before they go to the game.
Oh really?
And they've picked every, the Melrose even admitted at siteban.com.
He's been going there to get his pixie.
They've picked every game.
I go there.
I turn it on about five o'clock.
Yeah.
I wait for it at the sports section to be downloaded.
Yeah.
And they have like a little file there.
You listen to the player.
Well, what have I got to do with that?
How come I'm on there?
I don't understand.
It's for a radio.
Oh, I see.
You know, it's like a music.
And then I think it's spinner and one of the radio sites and it listens to QAM.
Yeah.
I'm on the internet.
Great.
Thank God.
Well, I know I'm on the internet, but I didn't realize that.
That's what I was on at site.
We're all over the place.
Thank God for that.
Thanks for the good news.
Hey, I want a chance for my kids for the tickets.
And go saverers and go work at the NRED.
Oh, is he gone?
He's going to give him some tickets.
He's gone?
Uh-huh.
Oh, damn it.
Fine.
Well, of course, I'm going to hung up on him.
But how could he be gone already?
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 10, 60.
I mean, he was a good call, too.
He was very enthusiastic.
He actually did a little bit of hockey and a good guy.
And I hung up on him.
Well, it's just a reflex.
You know, I figured when a call was done, I put my finger on it off button and he's gone.
And he was done.
He didn't know it yet, but he knows it now.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, he pounds 5, 60 on the mobile one line.
Come on.
Best actor and best actress of all time, huh?
I'm looking on this list for somebody that really like stands out.
And William Holden is down there on the bottom right under Edward G. Robinson.
I mean, Edward G. Robinson was a good character actor.
He was always like a gangster, but I mean, he was always the same.
You know, every movie he was in, he played the same character.
Tough gangster with a cigar and a gun and the same thing.
He was, you know, what he was.
He was okay.
Certainly not one of the top 25 actors of all time.
And more than James Dean, who only made three movies or Gene Kelly,
who danced to the Reign 2 God then much.
East of Eden was a...
East of Eden, thank you so much.
The turd.
That was the turd movie by James Dean along with Rebel Without A Cause and Giant.
It's gigantic.
That's what that Faghaeg Liz Taylor said.
And there's another person, by the way, I don't want to hear about her.
That's a good contest.
Will Smith or Liz Taylor?
Which one can you handle?
Not one more award and Ricky Martin.
There's all that he wins hands down.
Hands down is pantaloon because he wins.
I'd rather sit home and watch a Will Smith Liz Taylor Film Festival all day
than hear Ricky Martin's name mention one more time.
Or listen to those off-key songs that he's singing.
That he's sneering.
Oh God.
Who are you kidding, Hootsie Cootsie?
The women of the world and especially of the US of A were his biggest successes, by the way, in this country.
And you guys out there, you're lucky to sell it because most of the women in this country
their taste is deep inside there.
I mean, maybe that's what all those straight guys are probing for, you know.
Maybe that's what they're looking for in there.
Because they're sure a lot of search parties out there.
Ricky Martin, come on.
I mean, I will grant you we don't look bad as long as he's not moving.
As soon as he starts moving and you don't have a tonal on the ground,
then you start like sniggering a little.
And don't say sniggering because they get nervous about that.
Here's Hollywood. Hello.
Neil, how's it going?
Pretty good, sir.
I was just calling about those tickets.
What do you mean by that?
You still giving them away?
No.
Oh, look at this.
Here's one of the great Americans.
I can't believe this.
I was thinking about this man yesterday as I was watching the prices of all my stocks fall
while all the other stocks were going up to head, David.
Hey, how are you?
Are you back here?
No, in fact, I'm sitting in my desk shoving a pizza down here.
Listen to you on the internet.
I have to ask you a question, seriously.
I know I asked you this last time you called and it's probably boring to you.
But, you know, I'm a big fan of your network because I want to see all my stocks keep dropping
and they're doing a good job of that.
But what kind of these people ever sleep?
I mean, these guys, you're one of those guys.
You're there any afternoon.
Obviously, you must have some cloud because you're not working 20 hours a day.
But like Joe Kernen and Maria Bartiromo, for example, and the David Watson, they important David,
they're under like now 7-20 in the morning.
I see them when I get up and I come home any afternoon.
They're there four, they're there five, they're there with six.
What kind of a deal is that?
Hey, sir, give it up to your apartments.
They're giving up their lives, I think.
They do work hard.
That's amazing.
I tell you, you know you got really marginal stocks when the market goes up 200 points
and the last that goes up was it like 90 yesterday?
Yeah.
And everything you got basically the...
I was at 102 was the biggest one day point gain ever.
And basically what I got still went down, how do you like that?
You buying a wrong stocks back?
Yeah, now you're telling me that.
I just got to tell you, I was down there in the in May and I had a good day out at Close My Mother's Condo
and fortunately it was a weekend and I missed you.
Oh, there you go.
Yeah.
You weren't there and I didn't know what to do with myself.
And why should if you would have told me how to come in on a weekend just for you?
I bet you would have.
When I tell people that Ted David from CNBC calls this show, they think I must be loaded with the hot stock tips or something.
Not only that, I got got some pleasant email from some listeners who were also viewers.
Really?
Yeah.
In fact, I interviewed the CEO of Real Networks not long ago and I thanked him for his product
and I specifically said on the air I want to thank you because it allows me to listen to Neil Rogers and my amy.
Yeah, I heard what I was talking about.
I had 50,000 calls like that to tell me, oh Ted David just give you a plug on the air and I said no that's great.
How about a stock tip would be better?
I need some tips for myself first.
Come on, you guys did work on CNBC.
You guys must be getting something.
Those guys aren't getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning and working 12 hour broadcast days just for the hell of it.
I hate the disillusioned you but honest to God we are really a bunch of honest people.
Yeah.
Which means you don't know any more than we do.
Well, I can tell you honestly the only one and only stock tip I ever got was before I worked here and I lost money on it.
I'm a human contraindicator if I buy it it goes down and I sell it it goes up.
Maybe that's why we gravitate toward each other Ted because you go to whatever we buy it goes right on the old crap or right.
Well it's great hearing from you.
If it weren't for the internet I'd go nuts. I would not get my daily dose of Neil so thank you.
I feel greatly honored.
And I'm honored that I get on so easily so.
We'll put you right to the front of the line.
Talk to you next time down there.
Okay, Zagrishan.
I'll start the fire line and say hi to mom.
Thanks, take care.
Ted David from CNBC.
There you go.
You see what did I tell you?
You shipped through 50,000 calls and you get somebody that's a real mention here a celebrity.
Still won't give me any stock tips.
26 past noon at 560 WQM will rent.
Holy cow, Aaron's coming.
Hello and welcome to Redneck CSI, a collection of fine literary works has performed by that society element.
Most likely to consume large quantities of ethanol containing liquids at their sister's wedding.
Which incidentally happens to be their wedding as well?
Today's presentation is the project tale that is Richard the founder.
Well, in the world are they can tell.
They glory the summer, remember by the sun of York.
And all the clouds of the dirt upon our house in the date.
Blizz them on the ocean bears.
Ah, simply marvelous.
Join us next time for another most eating edition of Redneck CSI.
Okay, we'll go 12.30 to 5.60.
By the way, for that obnoxious lot of New Yorker that I know you're still listening right now to call before.
And it's called it several times over the years because he never misses a minute of this show.
Has anybody from CNBC called you today?
No.
You jackass.
I don't want to start being a name dropper because we already got some of those people in the station.
I don't want to start doing that.
But.
Now he's a good guy today, but okay.
You know what I'm saying?
Oh.
Good you, boy.
Only guy with two first names that I know you can trust.
Here's Timberpine.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
I just want to call you and thank you.
I went down and next took the tour.
Another guy.
I'll write.
Got myself a bundle and a couple of the Delmar reserve.
The perfect those are.
I'm on.
Yeah.
Absolutely excellent.
They are.
No, they don't even get a chance to call you.
I'm on the road.
Next time check out these Cuban bullets.
Those are theirs.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm going to go one of my hand right now.
I wish I could light it, but they're great.
Yeah.
Well, that sounds good.
Yeah, they could.
I was very surprised because I'm down there and I met with Nick.
Nick.
One of the owners of my team.
I think it was Nick who goes.
There's Nick Senior, which is the old man, the father.
There's Nick Jr. who's kind of a pudgy great guy.
Yeah, that was him.
The junior.
That's not.
He's great.
And he gave me the tour.
And I don't know.
I just thought it was great and why I just pressed my gratitude.
Outstanding.
Thanks a lot.
I give.
There you go.
We got a lot of happy campus from next today.
Oh, yeah.
How is Neil going to make it with those little cigar stops on there?
That's what that butt plot from my 100 was saying, huh?
That's footy.
Well, I'll tell you what you can do with your foot footy.
Yeah.
How are we going to do with those little mom and pops here?
Oh, brother.
You know, if you know anything about the business, okay?
You'd understand how much we're getting for spots on this show.
You know, how much money the station is making on this show?
Raking in the big bucks.
And that's the only question.
There's no question that this station is making money handover, money handover, limperous.
That's not a doubt.
The only question is, where the hell's it going besides in John Henry's pocket?
And Wayne High Pingers pocket.
And of course, the bee-leaves.
If they have any pockets in those old rumpal suits, they were.
I don't think they'd be able to put money in their pockets because they'd probably fall out on the ground.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the mobile.
And of course, a lot of people out there think that I'm joking about the beesleaves.
Oh, boy.
To see them is to know them.
Trust me when I tell you.
They have that just topped out of that dumpster look.
Here's the homestead.
Hello?
Neil.
Yes, sir.
I was just looking at just looking at the whole house.
I was looking to the channel last night and saw this wood show.
And I saw this huge chin on the screen, it would happen to be Jay Leno.
Yeah.
Given away some award to John Fervolte for a global wholesome crap.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And he walks up on the stage with his little go-t and stuff and straddles Jay Leno.
I'm thinking of myself.
Straddle them?
Straddle them.
Yeah.
Trying to pull you how it's done in there.
Uh-huh.
It was the blockbuster movie awards.
Oh, there you go.
Oh, there you go.
Yeah, that explains it.
It's got to get inside or inside or every year that Dan's Scientologist.
Yeah.
It was a little clay table.
Probably put too much mayonnaise on those fries.
That'll do it.
Have a great day, pal.
All right.
Thanks for the good news.
Okay.
There you go.
John Fervolte is straddling Jay Leno.
Spread the word.
Spread the report.
It's probably Jose Lambietl put on his insider there.
Along with all the other crap.
By the way, congratulations Jose.
A whole column in a Sunstintless morning didn't mention Ricky Martin once.
Oh, right.
And that sexual enigma that surrounds Ricky Martin.
Like there's some big mystery about his sexual orientation.
There's a mystery if you dev done blind.
That's right, Jose.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.
I mean, I don't wish I mean if Ricky Martin's going to make $50 billion from all that.
If there are a lot of people with bad taste, more power to him.
Okay.
It's the 300-price system.
It's the American F and Wade.
But I don't want to hear about it.
Here's North Miami.
Hello.
Yeah.
How you doing, Al?
Great.
You know what?
He's talking about all movie stars.
Well, your movie star that I really like is Candy, Reft, Garfield, Tracy and the Muni.
Yeah.
Well, well, well.
Well, we're talking about it from this century though.
Pardon?
I said, good last thank you.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, Pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.
Doesn't he sound a little bit like the guy who said that the nervous guy?
Huh?
Like...
Let me see.
I'm a little nervous.
I never called him already before.
But I knew it was a rest.
Yeah, I love the way he's snorkeling.
Yeah, that's my favorite.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, Pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.
Haven't heard from the nervous call in a long time.
I wonder why.
Stupid idiot.
Anyway, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, Pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.
We keep prodding and plugging along here.
Before we know it will be one o'clock, before we know it will be two o'clock.
The hump will be in the building.
He'll be on the air.
The theme song will end.
The show might start.
Well, they only got like 16, 17 people here today to work on Hang Show.
So, you know, it's a little rougher on the edges.
It might not be as good as usual.
Then we got Josh Darrow.
Probably will have to leave Hang Show early today, so we can work on a big 6 to 8 show tonight.
Clarence will be on her 6 to 8.
Talking to us.
I'm having to do these stuff.
And I'm sure hockey intensive will be hockey intensive.
No.
Because he's doing the, for the, for the, uh, the, uh, the, uh,
Prelude there.
The lead in the, uh, NHL game number five stand-up championship.
Buffalo at Dallas.
So you think that Josh should be really wet up on that hockey.
Is it?
No.
I don't know.
I don't even know if he doesn't really think about hockey.
If he does, he'd be sure of already in this building.
Here's sunrise.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I just speaking.
Hey, Pond for Pound are world's greatest actor, Marlon Brando.
Yeah.
Yeah, if you go by the pond, I would agree with that.
There's no Don Deloise, but.
Hey, how come they left off Don Deloise in all those great, uh,
Burnt Reynolds movies?
You know, you haven't been, uh, carting up that phone a long time, even.
Yeah, that's a good point.
I kind of missed the honey juniors.
Yeah.
Yeah, that honey juniors.
Yeah, boy.
Yeah, I'm cruising through sunrise.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
Yeah.
I want to ask you two questions.
Strip malls that are empty, completely empty in there.
Why?
There's nobody up here buying a shop owner that they just...
Where was this?
Sunrise.
Sunrise.
Oh, I'm just right now.
I'm up to McNabb.
Yeah.
And it's like...
And you have to ask that.
So, you have to ask that question?
Oh, my God.
Which is we just have 50,000 too many strip shopping malls,
and about 25 too many big shopping malls.
Other than that, there's no other reason.
And you can't see a sign for a storefront anywhere in sight.
Right.
There's a quarter of a mile back off the roof.
Plus, you got to understand the deeper you go into the heart of sunrise,
the more dead people you'll find.
I mean, most of those people are over the age of 100.
You can...
It's entirely over the banks.
Between them and the Jackie Mason wannabe is on every corner.
Yeah.
Okay, pal.
I'll get out of there as soon as possible.
5, 6, 7, we got 600 open lines here right at the moment,
by getting in and get some of those great tickets for Tarzan the Cartoon.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the mobile one line.
Where'd you get that from to the day, by the way?
Were you eating those great sub-sahemages from...
Is that from Tony's band chain?
From Chucks?
From...
It is from Chucks.
Oh, it's from the sub-center, our good buddy Chucks.
I would leave him out.
That didn't look like Chucks, by the way.
Chucks sent somebody over here.
Well, Chucks probably busy.
We hope he's busy over there.
Number one.
And, huh?
That would be Jay Holliday bringing it up.
So they can't get upstairs, remember?
Well, that's right.
They can't...
Oh, I forgot about that.
Most of the people can't get upstairs here.
This is a great deal we got going, because we're up here on the third floor now.
We used to be on the second floor.
Everybody else is on the third floor.
They moved us up to the third floor.
All of a sudden, everybody else moved down to the second floor.
I think they're trying to tell us something.
Uh-huh.
I was thinking that this morning, I saw one of those construction trucks outside
with a bunch of crap.
And I'm thinking this is...
This is so typical of Beasley and Reed, man.
The longest construction project in the history of mankind.
No one anywhere.
Even John Holmes never saw a longer erection than what's going on here.
Got it.
And you notice, like out in the front where the desk used to be out there,
the receptionist...
There's just nothing.
There's nothing going on out there.
There's nothing being built there.
There's nothing.
So I haven't got any idea what the construction workers are doing, you know,
or who they're doing.
Maybe each other.
I don't know, but they're sure they're nothing going on in this place.
And it just goes on...
Hey, that's the way it's gone, baby, because we've got to give John Henry and Wayne all the money.
Twenty-four-one and five-sixty WQM, if you want...
Oh, yes, what? That was the end of that break.
Father or two, God...
Ladies and gentlemen, if I could offer only one tip for the future.
Act strange, and people will leave you alone.
The rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience.
Put us fling you around your neck and try to walk downstairs backwards headfirst.
Sit naked in a large bowl of rice crispsies and sing feelings
while the kernels go snuff crackle and puff.
Go up to a ticket booth and try to stick your heads at the hole where they say how much.
Lick, a stranger.
Tell him you're from Bosnia and you're a country to sign a respect.
Take lots of pills. One of them might work.
Occasionally, ask the stranger if they've heard anything from Lewis.
Be annoying.
During an IRS audit, staple the guy's hand to his desk.
Moon, a funeral.
Play Gofetch with a C&I dog while he's working.
Run naked through a mall yelling.
Kill her bees. Kill her bees.
Say the word titty without smiling.
Try to figure out who said Paulie Shore should star in movies.
Don't be surprised if it's the same guy who said John Gacy should work with kids.
Ask an old lady if you can carry her groceries and try to make a run for it.

Okay, taking care of our fine friend there,
Align 7, with Francis O'Hare.
Oh!
Boy, that old guy could drive a horse man.
He had like a clock in his head.
He was great.
All these young punks to think they know something boy.
He was around the day.
If he would have been a young guy, he'd be a multi-millionaire.
Well, he must have been doing okay because he used to
have a big green Cadillac brand new one.
Nice go on, Frankie.
I mean, not that anybody cares, but one time I'm a Jackson Raceway.
I mean, I'm not going to start like some other people on the station
do like Eddie Kay and all the gambling stories.
But I'm a Jackson Raceway and Jackson Machine,
a little crappy harness track.
And the eight horse was a horse named Millie R,
which my mother's name is Millie, so obviously, you know,
and it was a good horse and Francis O'Hare used to drive that horse.
Well, his son, Daniel here, who couldn't drive his finger up his nose.
In one of the words, he's driving a horse that night.
And a horse is like four to one, five to one.
All of a sudden, something must have happened
and we must have got a bad bullet grits or something.
And there's an announcement.
Ladies and gentlemen, driver change number eight will be driven by Francis O'Hare.
And everybody is running to the window.
I go flying to the window.
The horse goes off to make a long story short,
even money wins by open links.
Anybody care about that story?
No.
But I did.
I did.
There was a significant moment in my life back in the days when I used to
cash a lot of tickets at the track in Michigan.
So I gave away another pair of tickets, George,
because the guy mentioned Francis O'Hare.
5.670560, 0.560 on the mobile one line.
Here's a mobile and girl spring.
Hello?
Neil.
Yes, sir.
I got a spy report on our favorite bank remat.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's going to be back in the banking business pretty soon.
Pretty soon.
Working out of the office to start his own bank up in Broward.
And he'll be speaking to you.
What do you mean, what do you mean, his own bank?
His own bank.
His starting his own bank.
He's working out with the Fed's now to develop his own bank.
How can he do that?
Well, it gets enough investors together.
And he can get enough capitalization to start making.
What was it going to be?
It's going to be in our community.
I'm not sure where he had.
It'll be opening this fall.
Really?
That's what he's looking for.
Excellent.
Okay, I'm waiting for you, Matt.
Okay, baby.
Okay, thanks.
I'm waiting for you, Matt.
Matt, of course, you're off great.
Never stole a freight train.
Always took great care of me.
I'll tell you that.
That was a real unsettling thing when I got that call on my
phone.
I was going to ask him to answer a machine that he was leaving my
bank because I kind of felt like, you know, left in the wilderness.
Yeah, like that.
And of course, it's only your money, so why should you worry about
something that insignificant, right?
Well, that's very interesting.
And glad that guy told me that because now I may just kind of like sit
around and wait to see what happens.
5.670560, £560 on a mobile one line.
If you want some of those tickets.
Huh?
Maybe that guy went to school with Brad Cramer.
Maybe he'll call it and maybe he'll get some tickets to the movie.
Oh, yeah, we're going to talk about harness racing now that will be
the end of this show.
See, that's the thing about this town.
They don't know anything about anything, things that are like everybody in their
brother knows anyplace else in this country in North America.
They know anything about it here.
You don't even know what that it is.
Oh, you mean those buggy horses?
Is that it?
Yeah, buggy horses.
What does that say?
Jackson Harness Race.
Here's a mobile in Palm Beach.
Hello.
Hey.
Yes, sir.
I worked at Jackson Harness track.
Oh, wow.
I was going to college there at Jackson Junior College.
I was on the basketball team.
What year was that?
So 63 and 64.
Are you serious?
I'm serious.
Remember the cast in Eton Jackson?
Was it, wasn't Leon Slaven with the president of the track then, right?
Yeah, right.
And I was, you know, just a young guy in college.
I was like 18 years old.
And I would take the tickets.
And I said, I should have got a hot number tonight.
I said, yeah, I said, pick four and a sixth race.
I didn't do nothing.
If you want the guy to come back, give me a 10 dollar bill.
Really?
I was just putting the numbers out just to be putting them out.
So a great time over there, though.
I was great.
And that track, I remember you could put $100 to win on a horse
and change the odds from $7 to $1, like $3 to $5.
You could watch the world match.
It was great.
In fact, a lot of times you could watch the warmups in a horse
that could still stand up.
Those are the ones you knew were going to win.
It was done there.
There was a big attraction there, though.
It's your one.
You had nothing else going on there.
That attraction stayed prison, those were the two big deals.
Now, if some of those drivers wound up there.
I used to go because I was on a basketball team.
So we could go play the prisoners over there.
And again, being running my eat back in the 60s.
So that is what the paintings guide with the robes
during closing everything else, right?
That means that those guys want to go shower, go shower.
Well, I'm worth thinking that I have little shower stalls, right?
Yeah.
We have a run-and-roll that has about 45 novels
that you just all stand there.
Yeah, kind of like the dolphins, right?
We've got all the prisoners looking at all these young guys
who are the drivers shower.
Yeah.
So I thought that was a good shower,
but back to the building.
Good thinking, man.
Take it from somebody who knows.
Stay out of the bathhouses, man.
You mentioned the objection list.
I had to try to return it, and I used to work there.
How's that?
Good hearing from you.
Okay, take care.
All right.
There you go.
Jackson, Rex Putnam.
Now we're talking.
Dwayne Dilworth, Clemonds A.O.T., Gerald Benfield.
All those glam, man.
Tommy Harmer, 5.670560, Pond 560 on a mobile one line.
That's what I'm going to do tomorrow, by the way, for a couple hours.
I'm just going to flip off a bunch of harness racing names.
Get us down to a zero.
Huh?
And then Monday, what I'll do is hockey players all for four hours.
Just name all the hockey players.
There you go.
There's Bobby Bond on the Broken Echo.
Look at that.
He's stuck right in there.
Nice going.
Anyway, you know, you got to learn new things.
You people are sitting out there with your finger and your nose pulling the limp here out.
Three minutes before a water keyway in.
Oh, boy.
It's the one to two hours.
Oh.
When the fog gets blown over every USHM, races are still just like that.
Yeah.
Welcome.
Good.
Let's start the game.
There's secret to get things.
We all are so excited.
Well, you're talking about time out of the show.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wow.
Time to go.
Here's campaign was brought up by the commies and trained for the French and they subdued.
The British was not the never-ending ones wrong.
He's been a careerist and went on side.
No, and not safe from the red, I be safe.
You know, these are kids.
Hail to the coward in chief.
Oh, right.
We're here for the anthem.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
That means I can't have done.
Whoa.
Wow.
Time to go.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
104-560-2QM.
So anyway, our vote for the best actor in the year is of the century is not getting no calls on that.
Good.
That's cool.
We'll say that for tomorrow.
5667-0560-560 on the AT&T wireless line of hand goldberg show at 2.
Josh Darrow, 6 o'clock.
He's a sleeper, baby.
6 to 8.
He's a sleeper.
You listen for a few minutes.
You'll be sleeping.
Now he's going to be fine.

You know what I'm talking about?
Yeah, with a yes in front of it.
Let's try a plantation.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, can I hear that?
That's flying.
That's flying?
What is it?
Yeah, that's sticking to my ass song.
Stick it in my ass song?
Yeah.
What's all song is that?
I don't know, you guys played all the time.
How does it go?
I don't know, it's got some woman saying no, just sticking to my ass and this man.
Okay, we'll look for it.
Okay.
Anybody know stick it in your ass?
Okay.
5667-0560-560.
What is it?
He's talking about ERECTT island.
Oh!
Oh, you mean...
ERECTT island!
It's the rectum time!
I'm gonna kick off my shoes, strip off my dress.
Oh!
It makes me wet when I see you, can't.
Oh, right.
A big, erectum.
That's good.
Yeah.
What's work?
That's the morning in kids.
And big, and stiff.
And dreams come until you take up his own water rep on his surrounds.
You're clothing too.
And make your wonderworm explode with clothes.
What's work?
That's the clock we're at.
And his son, Sir Cup 5.
Oh!
E-R-E-T-D-I-O-H-S.
I want to drink your balls.
E-R-E-T-D-I-O-H.
Okay, it's almost six.
I think that's what he wanted.
No.
I think it was.
5.670560, 0.560 on the 18th at P wireless line.
June 17th.
Not bad.
I'll be honest with you.
Not bad.
May and June this year compared to last year.
Boy, that was a death now.
That was like the end of the world.
Here's West Miami.
Hello.
No.
Yes, Sir.
I know you can give the city.
Okay, great.
Chronic.
I mean real chronic.
Sir, you're going to have to go get yourself like a voice
to a box transplant or something.
Because you're so obvious.
I mean, talk about telescoping it with that voice.
That sound.
Wow.
I did like the guy before said.
Get out of the way out.
And I second that emotion in your case.
Get your life pal.
Get you like a buddy, a little rubber inflatable buddy.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, Sir.
Hi.
This is our first time caller, longtime listener.
Uh-huh.
I don't really have any material.
I just went back and talked about Texas.
But I look at it and I miss you.
I really enjoy your show.
I heard you on the web a couple times up there.
Great.
That was a meal I get.
I am just a single Julio.
But I really like to have the tickets.
So that's okay with you.
You just came back to town?
Yes, Sir.
Well, wait till you're here a little bit longer.
Okay, then start free loading.
Okay, don't just come back from Texas and start free loading.
Practice a little while.
Okay, and then we'll maybe give you something for free.
I doubt it, but we'll work on it.
Boy.
I sure played my cards right today, you know?
Yes, I did.
Sure played this thing exactly right.
If I would have done that thing like right down the middle,
like somebody suggested George.
No, I know you didn't suggest, but you thought that I would.
You really did.
You got all those labels out and you thought that,
oh yeah, it'll be an easy way for the old man to, you know, buy a show and, you know,
I don't do that.
I want to have to go scrambling at the last minute if he decided to.
I like people.
Don't get defensive.
You must be catching it from him.
Okay, don't, you don't have to be defensive in there.
You know how easy going I am.
I'm not the one that's always bitching out the hired hands in the other room.
I'll leave that to somebody else.
I mean, I'm like I said the other day.
I'm not, I'm holding nothing back anymore, you know?
I mean, in this place, I see where all the cards are laying.
I'm not holding anything back.
And what's the point?
Let's be brutally honest.
If we're going to have some people in here want to play a hard ball,
a good like Joe Dajola used to say, good old country hard ball, you know,
a literate Joe Dajola, who made millions by being illiterate.
Only in America can you make that much money,
being like almost totally illiterate.
Nice going there, Dajola.
Good old country hard ball.
He got him.
He got him.
At a boy Joe.
Oh, I'd rather listen to Bob Costas than Joe Dajola.
I'd rather be dead than here Bob Costas.
I was a channel surfing last night and it was almost the end of the basketball game.
And San Antonio was like pulling away from the mix.
Now, I watched about two minutes of it until I realized that it was Bob Costas doing the game in assembly.
I had to go run to the room.
Oh boy, talk about Twerp, little Twerp,
little arrogant Twerp who is nothing.
Nothing.
There is nothing about him other than he's a little ass-sucking Twerp.
Nine minutes after one in 560 WQM, you heard me.
Oh God!
Roy!
Come on everybody.
Don't look here man.
We gonna play again.
We be snippets there, right?
We be snippets there.
And he's finally to be busy.
You think the bucket's all for it?
I think the bucket's still to be good.
Check out what I've been thinking.
You haven't found a tooltask.
Oh!
Jesus!
Jesus!
Jesus!
Oh!
Jesus!
Let me do homies.

16 to 560 WDQM, under Panknozi at the Jula Rosa's departed.
16 open lines, all of a sudden right now, was during the playing of that for some reason
that they were enraging their... just dropped it.
560, 705, 60, pound 560 on the AT&T line.
Here's the mobile or West Palm Beach. Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I like to talk to you about Jim Brown thing with the white women.
Yes.
Is he with the regular white chick?
I don't know.
Oh.
I just like to talk to you about why the black athletes prefer white women instead of black women.
Yes, sir.
The reason is that the black men, when they get the money, they're weak.
They get it, they get it, they get it, the black women, because they think the black women are going to take money from.
Yeah.
So they go to the white women instead.
Uh-huh.
That's about it.
Okay, well thanks for the good news.
There you go.
All your black jocks out there, stick with the white chicks, okay?
They want to each out of house and home or whatever we said.
Fine, they won't each out of house and home.
5667 05 60 pound 560 on the, so anyway speaking of that, speaking of Roy.
He did bring back, for those who have been following the saga of the missing large black rubber dildo that we had in here.
Which are good post personal, buddy.
Roy.
From our sales department.
I wouldn't want to say like a sales hole.
He is from our sales department, you know.
Roy.
Not in it, just from it.
But anyway, he kind of like appropriated this last Thursday or Friday.
He came storming in here, saw this sitting up on the leg and said, I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
And he ran out of here with it.
Somebody in Coherently.
Yes, today like right in the middle of the show, also somebody in Coherently came running back in here.
And plopped it right back up in a spot right up there running a thing.
Of course, before very long, as soon as he got out of the room, I ran up there in the grab.
It's to take a look at it and I'll, I'll leak at it to make sure that it hadn't been abused and show enough.
It had been abused.
Oh, yeah, this was a perfectly pristine, large black penis just taking right out of the box.
I forget who sent this to us.
Do you remember who?
What is he saying?
We're not saying who sent it to us?
No, we're not saying who.
Oh, that person sent it to us.
Well, we're not saying.
But nevertheless, we were very proud of this and it was quite a conversation piece around the studio here, all around the building.
And now it was like pristine.
It was like brand new.
It was shiny.
You know what I'm talking about?
Shiny.
It was a nice big black shiny penis.
Now, unfortunately, on the head, it's been, you can see all the warehouse spots.
You've heard that expression, none the worse for wear.
Well, this is the worse for wear.
You know what I'm saying?
Roy!
So the investigation continues to find out exactly to whom and where in and to what that was done.
Nice going Roy.
I've had only somebody had a real good time with that over the weekend.
Here's Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hey, Neu, how you doing?
Great.
I was wondering if you ever read the book The Godfather?
Yes.
Booking better than the movie.
I just got a hold of it and just finished it.
It's so much better than the movie, right?
Yes.
As good as the movie was and it's my favorite but nevertheless,
or next to network, it's my favorite but the book was much better.
Oh, yes.
Especially when they get into the scenes about, you know, the doctor and all that.
That was phenomenal.
See, see a lot of people, they think, wow, you know, pseudo intellectuals say stuff like that.
You know, the book is always, and I don't believe that.
Sometimes the book is better, sometimes it's not.
But in this particular case, if you like The Godfather, it's worth reading the book.
Right.
Two things. One, I was hoping to take it.
But two, also, I have another request.
The Aikman song, because in today's USA Today, they printed his salary for last year.
Yeah.
And I need to feel better about myself after seeing this guy make five, five, five, one thousand.
Okay, I think your little snowball is what it is.
Well, highball, yeah, I understand after I have one or two high balls, so really, it's wild.
I want to find her.
When the squad aback, it's lonely.
Yeah.
He likes receivers better, why?
Oh, right.
Some people say that number ages gay.
Yeah.
They say Troy loves the big brown eyes.
Aikman.
You go down on his knees, Aikman.
Yeah.
He's got a sparkless reputation.
America's team has world renowned.
But is Troy gay?
I've heard some people say boy.
He's got a sparkless reputation.
Aikman.
He goes down Aikman.
He goes down on his knees, Aikman.
Okay.
I can't some balls to squeeze Aikman.
Don't lift him, cause he likes it from behind.
Back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back.
Okay, well, calm down.
On 121-560 WQM, would it be something all those macho athletes?
Of course they all know.
But the fans, especially like some of those jocks, the first of the call is radio station.
You know, the other 20 hours a day, or pretending to be a sports station.
Those people really would be crushed.
You know, if they had like that long, long list of all those fags running around in the locker room,
showering with the other guys.
Oh, man.
They would, they'd never be the same again.
Oh, that's just a Roman, that's just, you know, I'll have Steve Young and Troy Aikman stuff.
Yeah.
And even if it is, that's only two, you know.
Yeah.
That's only two of the top quarterbacks in league.
Now let's get to the other positions.
Oh, sorry.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Yeah, hi.
Yes, sir.
I haven't spoken to you today.
You hung up before because I was on speaker.
And it's like, when you hear that clicky, you thought I was hanging out with you.
Okay.
Okay.
Anyway, sorry.
Okay.
I read in an article actually, they were selling a watch.
Just changing the subject a little bit.
The watch was for a millennium clock.
And you can set it to the year 2000.
And then at the bottom it says, even though the millennium starts 2001, the watch can work for 2000.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What, what is that smoke?
That would be intense.
Oh, okay.
Go ahead.
God, I went into a panic.
I thought the guy named Studio was on fire there.
Yes, sir.
Well, that's about it.
Okay.
Thanks for the good news.
I mean, he said something about the millennium clock and I wasn't paying attention because I was a little distracted.
We're not allowed to smoke in here.
And it's not smoke.
It's incense.
And peppermint.
That's probably to cover up, you know, the smell of the bad stuff.
Come on.
Well, you know, we happen to be in the neighborhood and Chuck is bringing over the lunch every now and then.
So, as long as you didn't hoodline up, bring over some good stuff with it.
Come on.
I think right between Jiffy Loub and the tariff change over there, whatever that place is.
Tar kingdom.
I think if you sneak like right in the back there between is where you find the real food you're making stuff.
I think that's where they go back there and kind of like jerk pork and jerk chicken.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pond 5, 60 on the AT&T line.
Here's four lotterdale.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
What's going on, dude?
Hey, check it out.
And I, I, I, I, did you say check it out?
Check it, yeah.
Okay.
And, and the book, too.
All right.
Hey, the hunt for red October, I read the book a long time before I saw the movie.
Yeah.
And I agree.
The books are much better.
Yeah.
Hey, I was just about to do that.
The sides are coming up.
Hey, check this out this morning.
Do you say check this out?
I had not again.
Okay, what's up?
All right.
What's up?
The old, what's up?
The old lady came home, right?
She pulled an online her last night, right?
She came home this morning.
I was okay.
She pulled an online her doing what?
I don't know.
I did the finger test.
I came up positive.
I gave her the finger test.
It came up positive.
Yeah.
But if it were anyway, while watching the tape that I got from you about a year ago.
Yeah.
And that, that was just great, man.
Okay.
Well, listen, watch your old dipstick.
5667-05, the patient is going to probably turn to the dipstick.
5667-0560, bomb-560 on the AT.
Then you know you got problems when your dipstick turns into your, uh,
a dot-squared, squared dipstick.
That's right.
But anyway, give her the old finger test.
I bet you did.
Here's a mobile and popular hello.
Probably right up to the elbow.
Yes, sir.
Oh, you liked my day.
Listen, I want to know.
Did you, uh, I sent a photograph to you about the ski slopes in Park City.
I want to know.
Yes, sir.
The glory hole place.
You love that?
I loved it.
It's up on the wall.
It's got a print right right by where the poke, the poke, and the upheap show is right next to that.
Well, when you go back on the way out, the wall.
In fact, it's interesting because the poke is peering into it.
So I guess the poke must be peering into the glory hole.
Well, I think you leared over too far for the current head the other day, Denny.
Yeah, he got a little, uh, yeah.
And that made the CBS ignoes.
But I'm not an, uh, the, the head thing was a few days ago.
Now he's got the flu.
And that was a big story on the CBS ignoes.
Somebody ought to tell those people are at CBS.
And when a poke gets a cold, it's not really a news story, okay?
I know there was a lead in yesterday morning on the news.
Is that incredible?
Nothing about cost of all.
And everything like that was the poke.
Yeah, right.
I'm a little, little, little couple of things.
Uh, page three of the hell today.
I bet the NRA is up in arms because Sheriff Ken Jenny was throwing the, uh,
all those guns overboard out there in the ocean to see that.
No, he didn't see that.
Yeah, he was, uh, showing a picture of him on a boat throwing guns overboard.
Yeah.
A thousand feet of water.
They're probably crying in their beer.
Well, I think next week he's going to be throwing guns overboard with one hand
and people from the swing clubs overboard on the other side.
They're swinging it.
They're swinging it.
Have a great day, sir.
He's throwing everybody overboard.
Now Ken Jenny, man, he never met a political office he didn't aspire to.
Fashes pig.
Watch out for him.
I'm telling you right now.
And just like with the jet bursting, they'll call me now and tell me that he's a fascist.
I told you that ahead of time before it was too late.
Did it make any difference?
No.
No.
And now the same thing with this Ken Jenny.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
You call that a Jew?
Do you?
Yes.
Do you close your head and then touched that wire.
She was twenty five, but she's just a thief.
No, sixteen, I said my last, but please, Daddy, call the cops with mine.
So I got so perfect to wait, because I'll have such a big, known of my customers by name.
My butt's a big one, oh, my show.
She's a big, she's okay.
She's a big, she's fine.
You should be sad, or sad.
You're a middle.
You should be sad, or sad.
You should be sad, or sad.
She's a big, she's fine.
She's a big, she's fine.
She's just a thief.
Anyway, it's 131 at 560 WQM.
Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin, and of course all three of these people are really big because they can really say.
Huh? Because they have great voices, and they can really build out a tune.
Huh? Is that the reason why?
No, no, I wonder how should it have to be.
If they look great, everybody likes their videos. Everybody's got their hand between their somebody's legs.
What's wrong with that?
I mean, you know, if the music is good, that may be a little bonus.
They want to think about my backstreet voice. They may not look all that great unless you got bad eyesight, but they can say.
There you go.
And their album's number one in about 5,000 countries all over the world.
And the best part of it is they're not Ricky Martin, there's like a public service.
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello.
Hi, how are you now?
Wait, never been better, sir.
Well, I'm happy to hear that.
I love listening to you show a couple of things I like to talk about.
First of all, about the actors.
You were asking about...
How come nobody is touching that, man? We should spend weeks on that.
Well, here I am. Okay. First of all, I don't know who's the greatest actors, but I know that two of my personal favorites were Gene Kelly and Jimmy Cagney.
Gene Kelly?
Yeah.
Wasn't an actor. He's a dancer.
I know, but I enjoyed his movies. Let's put that way.
You like musicals, well.
Yeah, but no, I like Jimmy Cagney, and he was one of the greatest...
Jimmy Cagney was good.
A great model, dirty rat.
Of course, he always was doing U-turn. He was up, but he was good.
Right, and the grapefruit, which was his invention. That was a great...
He invented the grapefruit?
Well, in that scene, with A-clock.
I mean, it wasn't supposed to be like that, and he decided to do that, and they kept it in.
And it was a great scene, one of the Hollywood's greatest scenes.
But here's another question for you.
How many actors today could have been an actor back then?
None.
Well, maybe Harrison Ford.
Yeah, he's okay.
Yeah, maybe Harrison Ford.
But the actors today, I mean, the only ones who are great are the ones who were like a carryover
from the previous generation like Robert DuVal and Pacino and those of us.
But the new crowd that you got there, most of them could not be able to have a paper sack.
Right, but I think like Brad Pitt, for example.
Right, but I think a person like Harrison Ford could have been a star back in the 40s and 50s.
Possibly, yeah. He had that charisma.
Right. And the other thing, you were talking yesterday about the restaurants.
And one of my students passed me to Capitol Grill. Have you ever been there?
No.
That's the old-sized Rivergate.
Oh, yeah.
And it's the Steakhouse and not bad at all.
Really?
Not bad at all.
And it was very good.
Good meat?
Yeah.
Excellent.
Okay, what was looking for good meat?
Yeah, well, you'd find it there.
Okay.
Okay, also, you're doing a Earthly movies?
You might do one.
You're giving away tickets for, not Earthly, so it's all done.
Oh, then just just ran out.
Oh, I was going to ask if I could get some.
Okay, have a good day.
I'm not giving him movies for the tarzant for a cartoon.
Come on, this guy sounded a good guy.
I have a little bit dangerous son, if you ask me.
We don't want him in a movie theater full, little kids.
5670560.
He, this guy's looking for juicy meat.
You know, you're not going to send him in there.
5670560.560 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's a lady in North Miami.
Hello.
Pardon?
I said, here's a lady in North Miami.
Okay, I kind of bleep when you said it because I told you.
That's a Linda Blur said, it bleeds and it burns is what she said.
Yeah, the phone bleep.
And JP said, if it bleeds, well, anyway.
Okay, and I told George, actually, I'm in New Orleans,
but he put me in North Miami being...
Well, he's old confused today.
So he doesn't even sound like himself today.
And I listen to you every day and I keep thinking.
I'm going to call you on my day off to tell you what I think.
Yeah, they think that if it bleeds, it leads.
I think of the channel 7 news, I guess.
And one of the things was these calls you got about George,
where people didn't like him?
I like five of those.
And we got an audience of 17 million people,
and only five people didn't like him.
I really got upset because if you listen to him when he first came on,
I'm like, I really think he was terrible in the beginning.
And he was terrible in the beginning.
And he was like, that's all I'm doing.
He was doing commercials now.
He's doing appearances.
He's getting ready.
He's getting ready to move right on in.
What do you mean he's going to happen about six weeks?
He needs a little more of your comedy cut.
Yeah, well, you know, that's something either you got it,
or you don't have it.
And of course being a serally little hard-headed spick like he is.
I mean, he's not a funny guy, but he's fine.
Also, the actors, I agree with you, Robert Mitchen.
I like him.
How about Robert Wagner?
He looked good.
He couldn't act.
He looked by today's standards.
If you look good, you're actually an actor, I guess.
Right.
But I was also wondering about Gary Cooper.
Gary Cooper is number 11, right behind Charlie Chaplin?
Oh, he is fabulous.
Right ahead of Gregory.
Now, how could Gregory Peck be down as far as number 12?
He's got to be in the top five, doesn't he?
Yeah, I like him.
Gregory Peck was great.
Most everything he made.
To kill a mockingbird?
Uh.
And now I think he lost it when he did that Omen.
I think that also hurt William Holden.
He did Omen 2 and Gregory Peck did Omen 1.
And I think that was an Omen for them falling down and listening.
It was a bad Omen.
Well listen, you have a great touch, though.
Listen, one more thing, if I could.
Are you still there?
I'm here.
Okay.
You know, when you go down Honey Hill Hill road, take your turn.
One, four, forty one going to work.
Right.
Okay, well, it's from 99 and all the different.
I'm going to work on the one I need to have.
Wow.
It's nice.
But you make your left, right?
Right.
And I go through that thing every day.
Oh, that's horrible.
And the people making left against us, I have counted as high as 14 cars,
making coming through the green lights, making that turn.
If they're in that lane, they're coming through.
There isn't any light there.
There's no, yeah, I'm 4.41.
Oh, you mean I'm 4.41, right?
Yeah, oh, yeah, forget that.
And I don't know.
Did you have any tickets?
I like, I'm like George, I like cars.
Get the honey tune, yeah.
Just ran out to me.
Don't have a great day.
Well, no, I mean, we have a quarter.
We can't give them today.
Plus, she's, we want to send people to see Tarzan, the cartoon,
who are like under the age of, I mean, she's very nice.
And I don't want to like offend anybody unless I have to.
But I mean, no, the answer is just plain.
No, don't take it hard.
I mean, you know, no, that's all.
No.
Am I going to give them to her?
No.
Did I have any bad feelings about no?
It's just the way it is.
It's not personal.
I like you, there was a call was okay.
I mean, not spectacular.
It was fair, yeah, it was weak.
No, it was okay.
No, but, no, she was very nice.
But just because you're nice to them, I'm going to give you tickets.
Like that one lady before, she wanted tickets.
And she wanted that fill all you can eat Negro.
Did I give her either one on?
She was still great.
See, that's a real fan.
Not something that if you don't give them something,
not you suck, yeah, I mean, that's, that's, uh, yeah, that's just a free loader.
And believe me, I can smell the difference between a real fan and a free loader anytime.
22 before 2 at 560 WQA.
Okay, hold her up the mold, mom.

I'm not here.
I'm not here.
I'm not here.
I'm not here.
I'm not here.
I'm not here.
I'm not here.
I'm not here.
I'm not here.
I'm not here.
I'm not here.
I'm not here.
I'm not here.
I'm not here.
I'm not here.
I'm not here.
Yes.
I really don't know where I went wrong.
Maybe he heard something.
I'm not here.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm not here.
Yes.
Yes.
that gets separated from the goal stick fairly often yes and i tried they've
warned about that that's a penalty
well i can any of the other players on the ice if you throw your stick is a
penalty and they warned him again the other night that if he keeps doing that
they're going to start to give him a penalty for the lay-a-game
my question was it can the opponent try to move the stick further away from
him and if they do is that is that a penalty no of course not if he throws the
stick they can kick it they can do whatever they want a bit
it just seems to me that one time i saw one of the skaters from the north
start from the start from the stars skate over it avoiding and i put the
the key thing to do would be to actually take it away yeah you're right
because his favorite thing i'm sure you've seen this is that he likes to drop
this stick in the in the right in the middle of the crease so that if he's
out of position like when he's at a lot of pressure
he's not a position flopping around that it maybe uh... well a shot will hit
the stick and it'll deflect it out so it's like adding another uh... you know
block to the uh... you're right though
but there he does all sorts of things and of course uh... you know he's always
well and then the great players that he sport uh... they get away with it well
and then that was some save don't you think that uh... that uh... any the ego had
with that goal stick when he was out of the shabby that was incredible yeah there
there were great saves on both sides that that game was one of the best i've seen in
the game these guys can really stop it yeah
uh... one question about an actor opinion on the opavik
who is it the guy that was the villain in uh... the clint Eastwood movie that he
played the deranged guy in the line of fire
i think that's the thing
a malkovich yeah
good at the end i don't even know who that is uh... okay
george says yes
you know what that means okay see it
john malkovich i probably would almost like some of the song i know my father
i mean clint Eastwood movies the only clinese would movie i liked
was plenty for me which wasn't like any of the dirty hearing movies it was a great
movie with Jessica what's her name Jessica
Jessica something whatever any why doesn't make any difference you know what i'm
crazy but she was great and he was good that was an excellent movie
and of course because he was a d jade of and you notice by the way if you watch
that movie never been radio if you ever were this jockey
he cues up at the way he cues up the record i mean how long would it have
taken to show him how you keep up a record before you're going to play it
and he likes to see uh... the needle on the uh... you like stick the needle on
the record you know it's like put the lotion the basket stick the needle on
the record and just like it looks that's not how you play it clint
no one had that cycle but chasing around
but he sure was a mean d j wasn't
here's a lot of the whole
he was better than pretty crews yes sir i had a question about the guards for
you sure
i spoke about the box press the guard the other day
a box press the guard yeah it was kind of weird to be like a usual
uh... cigar was like to squish down into like almost like a box shape
i was just wondering if you ever heard of that or if you know what the point of
box sheets pressing the guard on the pins on which box you put it i guess
now i guess you have to call up but he knows all about that
maybe it's one of those new monocles five six seven oh five sixty pound five
sixty on it
see i don't probably a lot of people around you know asking questions like did
he stick it in a record like where exactly did it go
i think they have a few file at point there people have no lives of the
one worried about where did the president stick his cigar and did he actually
lighted up after he stuck in her uh...
i'll whatever
and of course he'll be walked in and said
here's the new beach
and you'll get a good story for you okay
grandmother just turned ninety three years old
can't be too well
sure he's driving though
i've just renewed the license five in the mail
all right
here's i'm sure
fortunately we took keys away in the car about fifteen years
all you have to do with all folks driving around pull the keys from them right
when in doubt pull it out
thank you sir
what is it any ticket
five good story but no tickets he thought i would give them the tickets because
he did a good service great job there sir but i'm still i can be denied
the tickets were no more tickets today well maybe i don't know
and all the and all the pants i mean i like to look at the sperm of the moment
i mean whatever the mood strikes me if somebody says i like france is over here
was there any doubt about that no
science yield and deliver even without peter franthan he had those tickets in
a heartbeat
no question about it
you know how to get to me frances oh here
seventy two years old this old man would go out there and win race after race
that bucket day allords lady millie are all those horses you know
oh it's jane oh it's leo does anybody have any idea what i'm talking about no
i guess i have to call up jack rigs in the announcing booth up there at
hazel park
you know i first went to the track i was going to Michigan state and of course
when you go to school all those terrible things start having a start drinking
lot
drinking a lot of beer
and you start going to the track and gambling away your money
pointing your our tapery quarter
yeah i was very big in a pawn shop and he's lancing but at any rate
and uh... some of my friends got me going to hazel park to the track and we went
to the track the first time this is nineteen sixty thirty nine years ago

the first horse i ever bet on was number nine in the first race eldoa janko
given by dawn macklemorey i bet two dollars to show it came back he won the race
paid two sixty to show i made sixty cents on the first bet
out
and i was it
got me hooked
and jack rigs was calling the races at hazel park and used to do the runners the
third birthday afternoon at the rc and then drive over to the uh...
harness racing the same night used to double duty every day to it for years
and i was still doing a harness racing in hazel park jack rigs
not the greatest not the most exciting got a good voice he still sounds the
same as it thirty nine years ago boring but nevertheless good guy
that may be a thing to me no but it means something to me okay
