Thank you for listening to the New York.
Can I want a 560 WQM?
It's an amazing Thursday, boys and girls.
Wow, yes, Virginia, there is a press conference.
And will we carry it?
Well, before we get to that, let's read this fact
that we got from Peter this morning alleged,
which I'm sure that's a phony name, but nevertheless,
because nobody this stupid would put a real name on it,
even just the first name.
Neil, I am a Paul spelled APP A-U-L-L-E-D.
I am up at Pollard that you didn't carry the press conference
or Michael Jordan.
Jordan is someone who can speak properly.
He is intelligent.
One of the greatest basketball players who played for 13 years,
who was an icon in someone of high-statury known all over the world.
You arrogant, egotistical idiot, won't allow us to hear his press conference.
If you didn't want to listen, you should have gone home and leave George to complete the show.
Yeah, George would have been real angry.
Oh, right.
He was hot to try to put that crap on, right?
No.
No.
Today you had better carried the Jimmy Johnson's press conference.
Boy, you are so illiterate, Peter.
So the one you want to hear about you dumb jokes.
You had better carry underlying the Jimmy Johnson's press conference.
Who do you think you are?
I think I'm...
You're good.
Probably.
You must be miserable.
Am I miserable?
No.
You dislike everyone and everything.
No.
You don't like football or basketball wrong.
I do watch a lot of football as a matter of fact.
Not as much as I used to because quite frankly a lot of it's boring.
And basketball you're right.
I don't like it.
A bunch of seven foot freaks.
This is your rights.
That is your rights.
Peter, you are so illiterate.
You must be the one that's miserable and must look at the mirror and say,
God am I dumb.
Are you dumb?
Yes.
Why do you want to deprive us of listening to a press conference?
I dare you to read this on the air.
Reason is the fact that you are gutless.
Well, how do you like that, Peter?
I just read it on the air.

The Panthers made a great comeback there.
Sparked by Ray Whitney in the third period.
The fact that the Maple Leaves were like out of gas.
Too many games in two few nights.
But we don't make excuses.
We'll take the tie.
Thank you.
But again, the Panthers.
Fifth time in a row.
They made a nice comeback.
Ray Whitney sparked the comeback with the first goal.
After that, they won fire.
And Leafs were our gasping for oxygen.
Although I will say this.
And you know, Maple Leaf fans, we don't cry.
And we don't moan like some of the other fans about the officiating.
But the third in the time goal, it was offside.
Then he pulled it out over the blue line.
And interestingly enough, some of us,
they're all around me.
We heard a whistle.
It must have been some jackass in the stand.
And I sat back in my seat thinking, OK, it's offside.
The play is over.
Next thing I know, I look up the puckies in the net.
The crowd is on their feet.
They're screaming.
The game is tied.
I'm thinking, wait a minute.
That was offside.
But like I said, we make no excuses.
We ran out of gas.
And the Panthers did their credit came back and tied it up.
So everybody went home happy with the point last time.
Torenda's game.
Too bad there were like 5,000 empty seats.
This morning's papers will tell you the official attendance,
which includes a season ticket sold, 17,500 in some odd.
But the actual number of seats the people through the turnstiles,
and I know this for a fact from people on the inside,
was about 14,500.
And if all the teams in the league for some strange reason,
when the Leafs come down here, they don't draw.
They don't draw.
The most cool of any team in the league this year,
certainly one of the two or three most exciting teams in the league,
does that make a difference to these people?
No.
No, do not.
They don't draw.
And by the way, the people in front of me, the baby people,
weren't there last night.
God bless you.
Thank you so much.
Everybody in my section was well behaved on their best behavior.
I saw the whole game.
No problem.
We had 8 billion people come by and say hello.
The only one who acted a little bit bizarre and aberrant was unacceptable,
because we're not impressed by you standing in the aisle with your cell phone
while the game is going on, was Lenny the limo driver.
Which a couple of guys finally screamed at him.
Hey, sit down and ask the whole other game is going on.
He all of a sudden speaked in there and sat down.
Lenny, we're not impressed.
You're a good guy.
You're who you are.
You have a great limo service.
And also Ken's got a great limo service to McKenzie.
And this guest today apologizing profusely for that jackass that they're called Tuesday.
Ken, at all points, limo-zene services.
Great guy.
In fact, such a good guy that he didn't got other people impersonating him on the air,
which was the first on it.
All the years I've done a show.
That's the first that we ever had anybody calling in impersonating a limo driver.
So you ought to be honored, Ken.
That anybody takes you that seriously and that is that jealous I guess.
Maybe it was Lenny, I don't know.
But anyway, other than let me limo-driver, everybody was on their best behavior.
We turned into a scintillating game.
And again, the Panthers played only one period, the third period.
But nevertheless, turned into a terrific battle.
And two bad over 5,000 MTC.
The greatest column.
I thought the one about Leavon and about the fact that Dan La Bastard.
Oh, he was Cuban.
It was us.
We won the World Series.
I thought that was the worst article I've ever written in my life.
But the one today, the one this morning,
please Jimmy, reconsider and stay of the headline by Dan La Bastard and the Miami Hero.
This article could have been easily written by a five-year-old child.
Or by someone who has the emotional maturity level of, like I said, a two-year-old child.
Nine minutes after 10, we'll be hearing a Jimmy Johnson press conference from pillar to post.
As soon as it happens, you'll hear it.
On the bottom, I was afraid we'd be able to read the facts again.
That was pretty good, Peter.
You're a bastard.
I know someone like to do the sandwich or two.
Eight months that skinny chick, the skinnyest chick I know.
You do just bleak, that heroine's feet.
You got to lay off the blow.
Eight months that skinny chick, we want to know what's the deal.
To close the trap when you're in rehab.
You're worse than Ali McVeal.
14 at 5.50 WQM.
So getting back to Jimmy and all this shock and amazement here, the fact that he's going to resign and announce it in about 45 minutes or thereabouts.
Now you can look at this any way you want.
You can look at it from, you know, he says that he's got to spend more time with his family.
He's basically, don't want the pressures of all this BS anymore.
He wants to change the direction of his life, his mother died a short time ago.
His father's fighting cancer, he's on chemo, et cetera, and so on.
You can believe that and accept that as being the only reason he wants to leave.
Peter King of CNN, I thought this morning said that basically things, Jimmy doesn't see the players being motivated the way that they used to be when he was with Dallas
and how they just, they don't have the vacation and motivation.
And it's just too much of an effort to try each week, week after week to motivate them to get out there and play.
That's part of the reason.
Then of course there's the business about, you know, being thin skinned and doesn't like the media criticism, et cetera, and so on.
Which of course, if you don't like the media criticism, it's the wrong profession to be in.
But I will say this.
And I did listen this morning coming in because obviously this is a major story and needless to say it's one day when I have to be listening to what I want to or not.
And listening to the callers that called in and the Venom and the Hosta, it really, there are no gray areas.
There are no human areas here. In other words, maybe this is a guy who just fed up and he's got plenty of money, he don't need the money, et cetera.
I made just this amount of do this anymore. There is none of that.
There is either people like Dan LaBaster who are such emotional cripples that they're on the verge of tears and having an nervous breakdown
because the football coach is going to resign or the majority of the calls that I heard and I've heard about a half an hour.
The majority of them were like venomous and while we knew when he came here, he was a piece of crap and just ripping him a major ass.
Now like I said, if you're not emotionally prepared to handle that and you don't want to take that anymore along with the other stuff that goes on, then you're in the wrong business because it goes with the territory.
But you have seen it, especially during this past season, the only one press conference early in the season when he chewed the hell out of the press just absolutely went bananas.
And then of course the situation with this radio station and calling in on the morning show and then getting up the thing with Bo Camparaniere, the guy is very thin, he's a hothead.
And unfortunately, hell of a lot of people in coaching positions like the Marie Boers, they're a couple of hotheads, is what they are.
Can take no criticism and I don't understand that if you're going to be a public figure like that, if you're going to go out there and put on a show for the public and expect them to subsidize it and emotionally and tangibly support it, you got to have to have their skin on that.
But at the same time, is it going to change our lives?
No, I don't think so. But it's fascinating to me since this is the anti-sport show, since we get some of these factions like the one I just had from Eliterate Peter and some of these other morons, the Jacksonifers.
I was the one that told you two weeks ago, beyond a shadow of a doubt when it was told to me directly by somebody who knows beyond a shadow of doubt that Dan Marie knowing Jimmy Johnson despises each other.
And then I'm coming to work this morning for the first time on one of the other shows on this station. I actually hear that being said, not in language that strong.
But I hear it being hinted that they really aren't on the same page and they're not fond of each other and yadi yadi yadi et cetera and so on, which is maybe a couple of weeks, a few weeks ago.
When everybody was saying, well, you know, Jimmy didn't make such a big deal about Dan setting that record touchdown pass et cetera and so on.
Well, they don't like each other. They despise each other. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised even though I'm sure he can't admit it publicly that Dan Marino right now is dancing a kazansky. He's probably jumping up and down up there in Weston or wherever he is.
For joy, because he doesn't like Jimmy Johnson.
I mean, and how many times have I told you people called in and want me to talk about that stuff. He hasn't shown me that much since he came here.
He's improved the defense. They got a tremendous defense, but you know something you got to be able to score points and this fan and business of developing a running game. There wasn't any running game.
There never was a running game when they played against a good team.
So he really didn't show me that much, but life is going to go on. It's not like the end of the world, but you read this Dan LaBasse.
You think that this is sensational. Please Jimmy reconsider and say it's I'm not going to read much of it, but it's just it's pathetic.
It's written by somebody who sounds like an emotional cripple.
It starts out by saying is it true? Can it be?
Uh-huh.
Jimmy Johnson is resigning. That's the word that started spreading it about 10 p.m. Wednesday night, crackling like a lit fuse.
Making its way from the dolphins front office to the dolphins coaches to the dolphin players, causing an explosion everywhere it hit.
Like it hit the fan.
All we can hope is that it isn't true that Johnson just had one of his momentary mind melting like he did after the hurricane's 1987 fiesta bull loss and that he's just temporarily sour because he takes losing so, so hard.
How do you like that? Is that is that emotional or what?
It is so hard.
Oh, Danny LaBasse, you are a baske out of I was going to say a basket case, you're a bastard case.
And then at the end of the economy, if I can find it very way here in the hero's fourth section somewhere in the middle of the middle of all the important stories.
Um, not that I blame JJ if he does go back to that life, heck, he just became dramatically underpaid.
Mike Hombin doing the same job in Seattle just got double the paycheck. Heck, former coach John Madden makes five times with Johnson does just for describing other men's coaching.
Please Jimmy, reconsider the dolphins need you so very much clearly more than you need them.
Is that not doesn't that scare you? I mean, this is an adult writing in what is supposedly the superior newspaper here in South Florida.
Certainly the best known in America much more so than some federal. The Miami hero, the software claim prestigious Miami hero.
Here's an adult writing this. Oh, now I don't know not the kids of America. Okay, little kids, little infants, I think are far more mature and prepared to handle the hazards of life like maybe the coach of your football team, you're signing.
I mean, your coaches like as soon as the season ended, their coaches getting fired and quitting and going here in my home room leaves.
Pack the packers to go off the Seattle. I mean, it happens. I hate to break the news to you, Dan. You're better lock yourself in, brace yourself real tight.
It does happen coaches quit. Players resign after they get their first 10 billion dollars like Michael Jordan. Players resign.
Oh, no, how is life possibly going to go on for us now?
I mean, this is the classic. This really is. I'm going to save this. I'm going to frame it. Please, please, we beg you.
And of course, this coming from the same media that I've been dicing him up for the last several months now since back in August.
Just dicing and slicing and ripping and tearing and etc and so on.
Which of course, that's their prerogative. I mean, you're going to have to take that. If you want to be in that position, you have to take the good with the band. If they're going to splice you up so beat you can't have thin skin and be a professional coach or manager in sports. You just can't do it.
Like Pat Riley would say if he can't stand the heat and go follow some other team, that's what he said.
Okay, let's get some real serious input on this here now because I know obviously from here what I heard this morning, the town is full of shock and venom and psychosis.
I mean, this is obviously even more important. And of course, I guess you didn't want to be upstage by Michael Jordan to run. I mean, who the hell is he?
So he's going to show him a thing or two today. And we'll have the press conference for you. Don't panic. We'll have it, Peter.
In fact, maybe between now and the press conference starts, you can start taking some lessons in something. Open up a dictionary, learn a couple of words, add to your vocabulary. Maybe a couple of spelling lessons might help because I am appalled by your facts.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the prestigious mobile one line. Here's dear field. Hello. Hello, no.
Yes. Well, first off, I don't think that it's going to make any big difference to us. I really enjoy watching you play. Well, I'll be well because I'm not Dan LeBasterd. I'll get on with it and we'll get another coach.
And I personally think that Johnson will take a year off and then wind up on another team. That's one thing. And also, I feel that Dan Marinos' resignation will probably happen before next season.
Why is that? I just don't feel that he's going to go the whole next year. I didn't see it this year. He did great, but I don't know if he's willing to start.
Well, let me ask you a little bit. Realistically, how many more years can he play? LeBasterd in this article, he must have been unassured when he wrote it, he says, well, maybe this happened. Part of it could be, DeDen is Wayne Hypinger going to sign Dan Marino to a long-term contract. Long-term. How long is he supposed to play to? He's 45 years old? What is this man thinking about?
Well, I'm in a walker, they'll bring him out. Exactly. They're going to have to bring him out there to have to borrow Larry Flint's wheelchair to wheel him out there.
Either that or Marino is going to go to the highest bidder or just maybe he doesn't need the money, he will go to a super bowl team next year. That could possibly happen to. Those are my things.
And I know those two didn't get along and it was evident. It wasn't just that they didn't get along to despise each other bitterly.
And that's the hardest thing to do because they're both have a lot of pride and they just want to go their own way.
Yeah, okay. And on the top of all of it is Wayne Hyzinga so you can imagine what's going on behind the scenes.
Oh yeah. Thanks, Neil. A lot of zits flying all over the place. Zit hit the fan. Thank you, sir. Open line in Broward to and date, 56670560, 0560 on the mobile one line. Here's Boca. Hello.
Hey, Neil. First of all, you're the greatest. Yes, I am.
When's that press conference? I just got the tail end of it coming up around 11 o'clock or whenever Jimmy's good and ready.
We'll let you know. We'll have it. We won't miss a word. What about TV? You know, what about what?
Is it going to be on TV? Sure. Of course. Okay.
You like me. I mean, I'm only ghost. Huh? He's going to be like Michael Jordan yesterday. No, he's going to be more.
No, see the difference being it's Michael Jordan was anti climactic. Everybody knew he was going to retire. There was nothing exciting about sitting listening and talk for an hour about how he was going to have more time with his kids.
Yeah, but what was that? Everybody knew he was retiring. They loved him. He was great. Okay. We have a great life. We wish you the best.
But this is like out of nowhere. You know, so it's a major happening. The major. Right. This is major. Yeah.
It's happening here. So obviously we ought to be interested in since it's an open station. We ought to demo. Be interested in it.
So you think marino's history? Why would he be history? He ought to be ecstatic. No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying he's got a year or two left.
I would say one, one maybe two at the outside, but you know, one more I would say realistically. Yeah, because they get a couple receive his out there.
You got to understand every game that he starts could be his last game. You do understand that. Don't you with the two bad knees? Every game that Danny boy starts could be the last one he plays. He's the greatest.
He is the greatest to me. I mean, he is the dolphin.
And well, I agree with that. I agree with what you just said has been for 15 or 16 years. But the fact is again, you listen to the sport shows on his station and the people trash him like he's he's supposed to provide an offense without any support.
No, he's without wide receivers without any running game and a court. Any of them. If they want to blues even if he has a sensational game. Well, it's Danny. He's too old. He's a statue. He's this. What he does. He is a statue. But he's got two bad knees. But in the meantime, you can't you can't blame any of the deficiencies of the past. He's not him.
No, he's a if he they get a good coach or somebody, you know, bring someone in and get a couple receivers. They're on their way. Is they got a great defense? Yeah. Great defense is great, but you can't you got to score some points. Yeah, they got no running.
Okay, have a great day. Okay, no. We have an open line of day one in Broward 5 6 7 0 5 60. 5 60 on the mobile one line is getting real.

he's he's very concerned about free agents and and not getting much out of him and
he's been talking to a lot of people about about that the other is that he has
not been happy with the South Florida media in the way they've been reporting a
lot of things that that he's been involved with particularly when Dan
Reno had his 400th touchdown pass and Jimmy didn't give him the accolades in his
post game press conference and then the newspapers and radio shows went after him
for that he was very unhappy about that in fact very disgusted about that and
the third thing was on the day when the five coaches were fired that Monday I
talked to him right after that and he was he was pretty upset he thought five
really good coaches had lost their jobs and he started thinking very hard about
the profession so I think a lot of those things plus his mother's death and the
fact of his father was not dealing with that very well it brought him a little
closer to his family all those factors I think came to play and and so Jimmy walked
in that he Jones the club president's office yesterday and said that he wanted
to quit and that's when they summon Elaine and and of course they have to
meet this morning but he said he wanted to quit he he had not really technically
resigned and so I think that I think that when it was reported that he was leaving
it was just a few hours premature now Hank there was the talk that of that
Dan Marino is a working on a contract extension with the Adolphin's
management how was the relationship at least according to you know how between
Marino and Jimmy Johnson is Jimmy Johnson still firmly behind Dan Marino coming
back as the starter would that have anything to do with it I think he is on the
other hand there were times during the season where they didn't speak very much
so you know it's been somewhat rockier than perhaps they've either side is
let on but but the last month of the year Jimmy really felt strongly about how
well Dan had played and he was pretty vocal about that so they started talking
about extending Dan for two reasons one based on the fact that he felt so good
at the end of this the end of this year that he I think he has one more year on
contract they're talking about extending it into the year 2001 and
had accomplishes two things at three sub-sum cap room and also as a
commitment to Dan to be the starting quarterback for at least another couple
of years well I think we all know Jimmy Johnson is a proud man to say the least
now this has got to be eating him up to look across and see Dan Reeves coming in
and turning things around he had personal control bill par cells turning things
around he had personal control Jimmy's got all that yet he's still struggling
well he again he's very encouraged about this football team which is why I was
a little bit surprised that here that he wanted to leave it you know I do his
radio show with him and after the last show I asked him and this was before the
Denver game if he felt that he was taking a better team than Denver then he
took in the wing when the year ago and he said much better although this team
was very banged up and he and he said that if you took away the injuries
he felt real good about his team of course the defensive side of it and that
he would not really address the defensive side during this offseason that all
the floor focus would be on improving the offense to get a game breaking
receiver to get a big back who could catch the ball and maybe one more mean
offensive line and that's the direction that they'll go they have about four
million dollars in cap room right now depending on what happens with Richmond
wept they're all pro tackle who they have to sign but they've signed just about
everybody they want to keep okay well it looks like so anyway they're announcing
now it's not interesting they're putting the call on the screen on ESPN that
they've learned that Jimmy Johnson is going to stay with the dolphins and former
Bearshead coach they want that will come on board as a assistant coach and
Yadi Yadi in there you are thanks thank God for hanging so like he said
that he was very kind there it has come out to ESPN just maybe the rest of
the media a little premature evaluation and everybody getting sucked into
that because he said he wanted to quit but it wasn't officially yet so there we
on the front page of the heraldis morning front page of the sun settle this
morning the worst team psychotic all morning long as opposed to like waiting
to eleven o'clock and seeing what he had to say like maybe he is and maybe he
won't we don't want to do that doing no wait to see what he really has to say and
if he really is going to be done no right away you know you get a little piece
of material which again shows you the great responsibility of the print media
in this town they are so incredibly consistent you name it and they can get it
wrong the time of day they could get wrong whatever time it is when they put
that the ragga there's out they can get that wrong on the mast head that could
get the day of the week wrong whatever the issue was they're putting out that
day because there's nothing ever been invented that they couldn't get wrong
and they're holding the sun sent them so leave it to Hank nice going Hank baby
out and spread those stupid press conferences here's a mobile in Miami hello
a meal yes sir I had to do an adjullio calling for Miami yes sir I don't know you
were at the game last night I know you didn't get to watch Larry Flint I think
was on 2020 oh yeah it was pretty funny it's Sam Donaldson he's there they're
um asking him if he thinks he's doing a good job Sam Donaldson he's an asshole yeah
oh yeah no he's asking I don't think he's doing such a good job I mean in my opinion
I think Larry Flint's voicing most of ours opinion which is what's going on
here and should it be going on right and he's just bringing them down can I say hi
to a couple friends sure Larry Scottie douchebag okay every great day oh sorry
mr. Larry Flint well the hockey was pretty damn entertaining anyway we have an
open line in day one and drivers minutes away from Jimmy Johnson's press
conference but now it's kind of anti-climactic he's staying and you heard it
here first thanks for Hank calling us first by the way and then going on a
ESPN we had it first in the universe how do you like that very jackass okay a
little putt wacker over there at the hill which your newspaper got this all
wrong as usual just like you got Don smiley is buying a marlin's and yesterday
John Henry made it official the sale is complete to John Henry even though on the
front page of both our lose in the local lose papers day after day week after
week front page of the front section how many times did we read Don smiley
deal is all set to go it's like right on the verge he's right on the edge he's just
about ready to score score yeah and did he ever score score we did not no no so
just consistently when you deal with a bunch of little diggers like Barry Jack
ass and Van La Bastille and all these other guys although maybe we ought to give
Daniel Bastard some credit maybe that cheerful plea of like a five-year-old
emotional cripple there in the paper this morning might have into let's Jimmy you
think so I don't need it 10 54 we better do the breaker because God only knows we
don't want to miss a word of the season notes like I said gonna be a little
anti-climactic and one that'd be interesting now now I will be listening
Hank will be on by the way from Vegas this afternoon from two to six years out
there for the Mike Tyson the Dumbled by Saturday and then we got Booster from
six o'clock to six thirty Panthers of Carolina a very big game coming up
tonight and like I said we'll be keeping our ears peeled to see if we
ran think about the pop Elbowy deal with Vancouver because it looks like there
might be a good chance pop Elbowy is coming to the Panthers oh God that would
make it worth like driving the ten blocks to go down there oh God
Neil what's going on doing tonight and crying minds watching that that's why
inquiring minds read the Miami hero is Maurice for a really having sex with an
alien from outer space it's all a hawk and the crewmutter the elephant
man John Kennedy sleeping with Matt
Henry is Jim Baker about to get birth as Jerry fall well baby
I said the hell sex sex more
huh
Harry hearts amazing right starting from Florida a crop word puzzle that has no
answers our own public society is just for us
I post love letters to Neil Roger and we're so sorry Uncle Albert but we haven't
heard of bloody thing all day mindless badly rhetoric that's how and the
latest issue of the Miami hero available at supermarket checkout counters
everywhere and where finally the news for 1059 is they get it wrong one more time
okay but that's not the end of beginning wrong until they stop printing that
rag forever and ever and ever until maybe the day I'll come on a
real newspaper in this town that don't hold your breath so if you just tune in
and you're waiting for Jimmy Johnson's press conference at which you think he's
gonna resign guess what is he gonna resign no thank Goldberg called us about
20 minutes ago broke the story as he usually does I mean you know the bottom
line with is if you want to know what's going on in sports in this town listen
to Hank because he's the one guy who talks to all of these people who knows the
people talk to the people involved is opposed just sitting down and
pop pop pop pop you know talking off the top of his head through his ass
with so many of the people in this town do not to mention any names
we're not to mention any sports writers
just unbelievably embarrassing so we decided how we're gonna do this by the way
I just I just mentioned that in passing and let me say it again thank god the
Jeff Cohen and our satellite TV people because that's the only reason we got
this stuff up here it's a year and two weeks that we've been here on this radio
station and thank god to them that we have some contact with the outside world
so that we can put that stuff on there so that's your question yes no oh so
another day they haven't even bothered okay that's great nice going there
tough you're the best baby so anyway we can pot it up here because it's right on
ESPN in fact let's just pot it up right now because they're gonna go into the
thing George just pot it up right now
what is that
let me have a look at the cameras you want
let's see those seven
yeah
oh there's another one there
don't blame us folks don't get bad
you
Jimmy Johnson he's a sickin around but they're having music in the guys look
he looks like a senior wensers thought I thought I'd we could do better
to learn music than this yeah right this is pretty weak music so they have a
little bit of a problem are they taking that from
on ESPN
great what about the losers how about maybe ESPN okay well let's
switch around here and the final what the hell is going on
now there busy talking about unimportant stuff like the impeachment
trial of the president nobody cares about that
how about regular ESPN are they on top of this ago but the Jimmy has had
that's how well that's great but we already heard what Hank has to say we want
to hear when the Jimmy I guess uh what we'll do is we'll stick with ESPN and see if
they can make maybe contact this is amazing this is unbelievable
all the ESPN ones 206 207 to weigh it on the direct TV they've all got the same
thing under Jimmy Johnson and Miami there's the dolphin logo and all these
ponies who've been stabbed in the back by the way you're not going to be allowed
in the stadium anymore how do you like that
we've been tracing all the calls all these people at City was gutless and
spineless and he abandoned them and he was a piece of crap you're out
so people are looking for a season tickets now and they're going to be
extending his contract and they're going to bring it in day once that
I'd like goes on so how do you like that for a good old shot in the old
rectum how do you like it huh what is that George what is it you're doing
this radio station is amazing to me I mean you just talk about having
absolutely no game plan no concept no uh don't
worry the press conference being held do we like have somebody there no we
have somebody down there like with a QM microphone every time I see these
things on TV I see like a QAM you know logo on a microphone maybe it's just a
prop maybe we don't really have somebody let me maybe we pay somebody five
bucks I doubt that like I said maybe we pay somebody a buck and a half to go
down there put the QAM logo on their microphone but in any way the
Hank is the participating in going on to create lengths about this thing and
as soon as Jimmy steps up there there he is there's Jimmy going ballistic on
the sideline pair in a head set's off screaming and yelling and jumping over is
what is it what is it 12 30 is the latest rumor
from duct 12 30 and yes we do have someone out there
12 30 12 30 are you sure well I've messes up all our plans
just like Tessio said in the godfather that messes up all my plans
remember that can you get me off the hook time for old times sake no
can't do it Sally 12 30 and we were going to have an early lunch here thank god I took my
Adelaide by the way doctor Mark showed up at the hockey game last night and he's looked at my
neck and said oh yeah that's pretty interesting that red thing that's interesting
he felt my neck and it was hot he said don't worry about it you'll be fine don't worry it's
nothing could be one of the many many things it's nothing you'll be fine I said you know
doctor Mark they're going to put it on my tombstone they're going to put it on my tombstone
you'll be fine is what they're going to put on their quote Mark LaPorta he's a great guy but
he looks at you he feels yeah it's hot it's flushed you're fine
and I'm pretty damn sure it wasn't the Adelaide but my blood pressure you know George is
puking and they're watching me take him my blood pressure 80 times this morning
I'm really not in the mood to have another stroke just to prove a point for that lady with the
Adelaide so I'd rather have the flush and still be alive would be good speaking of uh
wait a minute speaking of flush here's guitar man I am he stopped with dolphins
a mother choking teens they play like it's time to quit they play like
fucking queens they suck they blow out of control now JJ's gonna bail
so call a way that fucking pain and say we watch you laugh back
oh wait oh wait hey great back up great step
I'll bring back up great step yeah great back to great step in the Bell jar with the tubes
in the wires and bubbles and stick it in an orange ball cart
rectum an orange and peel off parts and try the whole goddamn punch right up the
quill oh the ruff all right oh man that was emotional beautiful well done
how do you not bail him out he's think here's Bill Tarcell's on there the head coach of the
year get the argument fake let's say he is true which means the numbers will read like this
13 years let's have are you on time we're just all over the place are you on 207 I mean uh
yeah I thought it was huh Bill Tarcell's looking to be sure on hand one there's Michael Jordan
they're gonna give it to him are you on 208 207 look at that they're having all kinds of
audio problems on the ESPN news forget about don't put them on anymore until
Jimmy comes on which now we're hearing about 1230
which is absolutely unacceptable he screwed up all our plans well guess what we're still
gonna get lunch now how do you like that call up our good friend Chuck if you will give me my
regular you know our nifty balls in here and let's just have a little party because Jimmy stand
always told you I love Jimmy nobody believe that no I mean like I said I don't mean to care one way
the other it's not that's what off my ass but he's not leaving and they Wayne came flying in
in the hurry and said don't be doing this because you know my zizzer's starting to pop all over
the place and cut the graph and whatever you want Jimmy you got it we might even actually
spend some more money so we don't have to be the farthest under the cap of any other team in the
league might actually spring loose with a few bucks now they dumped the marlins here south Miami hello
hey uncle Neal I reuse her great I'm gonna change his subject briefly here uh got a memo
took my daughter to school this morning and got a memo they were passing out uh and I need to
read it to you because it's pretty important and I couldn't say to you I don't have a
fact machine you ready yeah okay it says be aware and use caution in large letters
the police officer working with the dare program has issued this warning the dare program
are the police officers that work in the school if you are driving after the police right
right yeah if you are driving after dark and see an oncoming car with no headlights on
in large letters do not flash your life at them this is a common gang member initiation game
the new gang member under initiation drives along with no headlights and the first car to flash
his light at him at him is now his target yeah he is now required to turn around and chase that car
and shoot at or into the car in order to complete his initiation requirements
oh my god make sure you share this information with your friends and all the drivers in your
family and also neo-rodgers listeners how do you like that you believe that well that's in that
great news to know some other words mind you all business and if you know what's good for you
unbelievable excellent anyway have a good one right sports fan thanks for the good news
we'll see you I hope don't flash it I guess that's a message we should all be learning right
bubble don't flash it we have an open line in date five six seven oh five sixty pound five
sixty on the AT&T line look at that built parcels having a press conference in hepsed
along gyrla new york are we gonna put that on you no we're not no we're not
too many goddamn press conferences with too many people with jock straps and like I said a lot
of stuff that is that nothing to do with us which I find terminal and just an insult to my intelligence
as they thinking a feeble human being by the way that was a big fat fake memo what is that old
fake letter what that guy called up with the watch and how do you know that somebody just called
the president oh okay so you can either believe that it was a fake memo or you can believe
that was for real and govern yourself according me whichever you prefer but it was rather interesting
in this slaughterhouse in which we live here's a mobile in for a lottery hello
mobile in for a lottery I hear you pukin but you're not I don't hear you saying anything going
once yeah near yes sir this mess is uh damn the pastor not occur not if it is morning
yeah it puts the lotion in the bastard okay thank it it puts the lotion in the basket all right
I love it and believe me it seems like he needs some yeah or maybe some baby powder would be good
on his fractal that would be good for little Dan LaBastry so now you don't have to cry Dan oh boy
the two dandies are going in different directions Danny marino he's crying he's pissed off I bet
and fired up and Danny LaBastry he's like a peeing in his pants he's probably
he's cappin all over himself he's so happy now that Jimmy stand please Jimmy please pretty please
what do we have to say he's standing oh yeah but are you sure are you positive are you sure
uh yeah we're sure Hank told us okay Hank told the world I'll tell you one thing Hank Goldberg sure
I mean not that he needed to do that because everybody already knows how he's got the inside
with all these people but boy sure turned this town out this afternoon this morning right here on
his show by the way how do you like that Barry Jackass on the anti-sports show here on his radio station
that we have Hank Goldberg live from Las Vegas at 737 AM Vegas time which again I thank him profusely
for straightening all of this out and getting the real information on here instead of just
a room where you went to win paranoia from our local media and some other people who easily
get sucked in not to mention any names nine minutes after 11 at 560 WDQM
you can do in the behind but a cigar and herb a china she don't mind
well he don't know where a stove he goes I can see how there was some confusion between
humor door and human horror and then I can saw the turn see the box means saw her make it
stars report can lead to go in blind
and when you're getting in the middle of the night
nothing he was working hard late nights in the overrear this working on a practical joke
he took from back the noodle for an explosion
loaded for my car was blowing rings us
oh
bills the cars and mine cars the china
oh look how
she let's start a giggle every time he makes it we go
my car is not the kind you can do in the behind
that's good
okay
or people feel that Hillary's been made a fool of by a husband feel that Hillary was wrong
oh
in the link in bedroom she was born in morning
alcohol was doing her with bills old bomb
bills the cars and mine cars the china
she let's start a giggle every fricking time he makes it we go
my car is not the kind you can do in the behind
I was a car and her but china she don't mind
walk and do you think yes does not hurt is that
the oh yeah what you gotta do is take a sip of it all
oh
oh yeah
okay 11 16 and 5 60 w3 m that by the way is going on i know there's not so many people in this
town interested in that they sent an impeachment trial of your president but that's not important anymore
is it no i didn't think so anyway here's the fact that it's the gang initiation memo
about shooting the first new flashes their lights at them is a hoax it's been urban myth
for about eight years on and off so there you go it's a hit and miss also here's a
fact from one of our chronic attorney factors who says i thought it was good of Peter to send you
the facts from new haven you understand what that means by the way i don't get that but at any
rate are you worried that Denise the pop-in missed last night are you aware of that uh
and is missing tonight due to the flu uh rimmer said he's got the same thing Victor
Croswell have had that they must have had dinner together on the road or something together
that what rimmer said they must have had something together uh they must have eaten uh
finally it says wait till you see the rimmer randy i used to play at medicine square gardens
it was witness goal number 12th combo tonight you'll swear you're watching public access it says oh my
god are you saying that rimmer and randy molar worked great on it to my two good friends worked
great last night they stopped i heard it to come on it's gonna be a big improvement over that
Denise pop-in that frog we hope the frog gets better soon don't we know we certainly hope it's
nothing serious like my you know hot skin in my neck which uh you know i did take my ad
life by the way doc just in case you're listening and i'm not really too crazy about 154 over 95
for blood pressure like early in the show because i would like to stay alive yes i do monitor these
things very carefully and even my doctor or anybody else do i take their word for anything now i
make sure i check out what's going on just to be uh you know i'm the safe side don't forget we
got this date line guys you under the other oh that's right we got the date line guy well we got
that once a day he's not on date line he just would like a date evidently from all you guys out
this guy uh is a new chronic and of course these guys don't understand they're pretty damn stupid
what's his phone ever 954 954 this is a guy who evidently uh is in a closet and keeps calling
here bag it by animal with all kinds of stuff for me and George and anybody else you might talk
this evidently is a closet guy who is really afraid to come out but has just been looking for
companionship probably of the male variety what's his number any talk like this
954 maybe you got something to smow seven nine two 954 seven nine two seven five nine seven seven
five nine seven nine five four seven nine he's bigger than anal by the way he's one
rectum yeah what do you say he's an asshole oh well obviously nine five four seven nine two
seventy five ninety seven probably seven of them works that they heard his son set
on with the guy maybe that's the problem because at first of all he works there he's an asshole
because i mean Howard Kleinberg is a good guy and i used to like Bob Rubin to be for a pretended
right and about hockey but other than that there's a few good people working with those two
moose paper time jk he's okay huh i mean once in a while time isn't pretty good guy he's like
on our side sometimes but other net he's okay so the press conference again if you're tuning in
probably a lot of people gnashing their teeth and really pissed off that's probably you know
who that probably was that probably was Peter by the way no seriously that must have been a
literate Peter the fact that code you from nine five four seven nine two seventy five ninety seven
maybe or maybe he was looking for Peter from the sound of it press conference at 1230 or
there about see i have a feeling that what originally happened is that they you know he wanted he
was thinking about resigning they set it up he was going to have the thing eleven o'clock this morning
that's what they alerted the media to and then after he involved he a chat of this morning
and they uh... you know got everything ironed out they have to push it back a little because now he's
got to change the whole deal instead of goodbye he's going to say hello and hey you love me here
and if you don't too bad because i'm not going anywhere and put away the steel salami sandwich because
i'm not getting on the bus here's a mobile in Miramar hello hey good morning good evening before i
get to what i really wanted to talk about when you're getting good stuff yes you know before i
get to the important stuff you said something about dav one step and could you believe he's going
to be assistant head coach oh okay well that makes sense right okay well that's what he was
you know widely rumored that they wanted desperately and he's coming okay that's what i thought it
might be that Jimmy was going to stay as general manager and dav one step i take over his head coach
i guess that's not okay but i thought he had coached and they're extending his contract
oh okay well good job for you guys to get on the story great job for Hank yeah for Hank
especially but anyway what i want to talk about is how can the senate stay face at this point
i mean i don't understand that they can't they can't impeach them or they'll lose in thousand for sure
so what do you what do they do at this point i have no idea you know i mean there are a lot of
obvious ideas i would be i'd love to spare especially with Larry flint wheel in this chair around
and threatening you jay to the right wing republican i mean you got to know that they're like
did they're caught between the rock and hard place because they're caught between the house the
fanatical house republicans you know who who are like uh you know the bob bars and of course
they already got him and Tom Delayson i think they're going to get him and all these guys they're
caught between them and this bus solve like them being the next one to be outed exactly and and
way i would get a gov like kind of like cut in the meat grinder that's a bad expression to use
and let it what happened a couple of days ago here but they're kind of like cottony or grinder
exactly but i i mean as far as the democrats go i don't see how they're going to lose in this
situation yeah i'm republican but i'm a little bit embarrassed being one at the point it isn't
embarrassing you know it's like i mean it's obvious i mean you can you can it's like it's like dog
crap you can you can put ketchup on it you can dial it up you can call it a different name no
matter what you do the way that still don't crap and they're taking stuff i mean i don't care
how many pages of information they have 80 million pages of information the fact is that the public
we we we we saw Clinton we so we saw the uh uh the uh grand jury testimony we saw that verbatim
then they put the polo Jones testimony on here and each time they put this stuff on there there's a
oh this is the stuff that's really going to turn the public opinion polls against them and this
is what's really going to be and it never worked and they just keep trying and trying and falling
on their ass it's accurate well that's the thing they keep they keep putting the same information out
and and trying to i guess trying to portray it in a different life but the whole thing is they keep
nobody different on the dog crap but you know something it's still a pile of crap right nobody
gives a shot about it at all right but but in closing i have something for Jimmy yes sir he's
put your hair spray in the basket all right yeah we better do something about Jimmy's duo okay he's
going to be staying here and everybody is pretty excited about that he keeps calling by the way
who's that the jackass the jackass from seven nine two seventy five ninety seven oh maybe he's
not getting enough calls uh from people out there that want to have a date with him okay from this
jackass pathetic and of course you do know what happens after we give them a barat and that don't
stop it then we move on like the guy that uh who don't have the phone anymore open line and date
one and brown at five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line
real interesting you watch the way that they're the whole tone of this community has changed
when they got caught with their pantaloonies now he's a quitter i mean i all i heard this morning
basically i did hear one or two guys who must have been related maybe what's that little bastard
doing a voice almost in tears please Jimmy don't do it i'm upset i'm stuck but other than that
i mean boy the knives and the weapons came out you can talk about fickle two-faced
alabaster than this time man they were ready to uh just put up a big uh cross there right in the
middle of god damn pp park and uh you know and crucify the guy let's have a god damn lynch mob they
doing one up there and washing them with the president let's have a lynching here at Jimmy
and i'll hang comes on here about forty five minutes ago and reveals the news that guess what
he's not leaving and they ironed out their problems him in baldy and he's standing they extended
the contract they bring in and davel on set and now it's like all of a sudden those people all vanished
they disappeared they put on the vanishing cream like ramaland they're all gone where are they
does anybody know where they are no vanish no here's a mobile in north maimmy hello uncle neal yes sir
i'm wondering if i could get your your opinion on something yes don't you think that all of the
firings and their uh quitting like jordan and jimmy johnson i just manufactured uh
employees by the media to get uh interesting something that people just still care about anymore
like the mba who would have cared about it if jordan wouldn't have quit and the dolphins i mean
they're waiting for the way to them it the jordan quitting doesn't help the nva it'll let
make it ten times hundred times worse doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't but but but
people are talking about it yeah and i mean and the johnson thing i mean i was already no
not that i'd really cared about the dolphins anymore but uh i'm actually kind of interested in
laying the same way that uh you know you're interested in a car crash about the dolphin now because
they're like they're like wounded uh this this is not some kind of publicity stuff i believe
absolutely that he was going to resign or that he certainly attended until he talked to
Wayne this morning and now uh whatever they discussed he's uh you know he's saying uh but but
you're but you're right to media milks this stuff just like right now i mean you you got to
understand when you've got a 24 hour sports network or 24 hour news network takes a lot of
crap to fill up all that time you're gonna have an nonstop and believe me that they give it to him
great well thanks for your opinion man that keep repeating that number over and over again
okay have a great day you still having conversations with our retard out there is that it
oh yeah because i hear some of it through the window and my suggestion is
please don't say the s word but anyway sorry about what?
how's still about one about uh people calling again well why is that i mean he's looking for
some companionship i mean we sure don't want to talk to him maybe there are people in the audience
who want to speak to this guy who's obviously got some very serious uh problems at nine five four seven
nine two seventy five ninety seven it keeps calling here over and over again and spewing up
studies and the vulgarity already i think the uh culture is to the cops anyway so good excellent
well that'll be good then here so he better talk to a lot of you folks today because after they
might not be able to talk to anybody see it's it's just always amazing having done this for about
five hundred years just how uh these people really butch up behind the anonymity of the telephone
they really butch up and even the most easily of pathetic individuals become real big macho guys
behind the anonymity and the little thing in their hand in the phone too a little dark thing in
their hand twenty six after eleven and five sixty wqa m
maybe you know my jockey shorts
i do want to get right on the internet coming behind the lots of sex every one of these more
converters just like me
you
30 of 560 WQAM Dan Labaski said please Jimmy reconsider please stay and Jimmy said okay and there you go and by
an hour from now we'll be hearing a press conference right from Jimmy's lips into your ears well I'd be really
embarrassed you know if I were one of those big mouth assholes that were called this radio station this morning we
had a couple of them on here too before I called in at about 1040 if I were one of those assholes always
gutless he's spineless he's a coward he turned tail and ran he's a piece of crap and we knew before he
came and just a tack it is he it's always the way it is always it's like in this business you know
when they blow somebody out after they leave oh they were always a piece of crap it's like the
beazer there's a good sports example for you by the way I hate to break the news to you my good
friend Jeff Rimmer and Brian Marie and all you other finger pointers down there at the macarena
maybe they're on their way to Carolina right now who knows they got that game tonight
hate to break the news to you John Bad Beas were got another shot out last night
it's four in a row for Philadelphia in which he's played three and a half of them when Heswell got hurt in
their one game over two hundred and twelve minutes plus since Philadelphia's a lot of gold with a
Beas are in the that's most of the way but he was the reason the Panthers were by last year right
oh yeah that's right so like I said once somebody is gone or you think they're gonna be gone
then you stick it to him you just stick the shiv in there and you twist the
turn he was a son of a bitch he was no but he was the reason for everybody else's problem
because he's gone that doesn't take any talent but only in this case now you got a little bit of a
problem because now guess what Jimmy ain't leaving that's what's on channel six but we can't get it
so so we're meaning what why do I want to see Dan LaBaster what's he gonna do if you can
well why do I want to see Dan LaBaster I don't want to see that jackass and what does he
care about Jimmy so much Jimmy's not Cuban here's my Amy Lake hello there's a little different
perspective yes sir I'm a Miami dolphin hater and a Jimmy hater so when I heard that he was leaving
I was upset I wanted to have anybody but hey I understand I want him to stay here and suffer with
those guys they're not going anywhere for another three years yeah so I'm glad possible and the
one okay and thank you so much well our good least of you guys being honest season title he
enjoys is one of those people that hates he loves hating Jimmy and that's the way it is just like
they show there are a lot of people that are foaming at the mouth of the idea that I might ever
leave here in spite of what they might tell you they're full of crap they would puke now did we
get launched by the way or is that like I'm working on it they don't have a delivery person
playing I'll tell you the details in the break I got to find a runner well when did you find that out
recently oh this is not good by the way what's on here uh-oh as in real bad but I did take that
about to hopefully it'll kick in one of these days bad idea dr. Marco case in 164 over 108
as in real real bad real bad idea two open lines in date 5 6 7 0 5 60 and 0 5 60 out of 18
to your wireless line here's a mobile in Miami hello hey me oh I had a chuckle yes sir had to
give me it wasn't over saying that he needs to spend more time with his dad he kept saying I need
Dave one said mm-hmm not a good day okay thank you okay there's the guys great a material thank you
very much sir open line and brown at 5 6 7 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on the 18t wireless line
here's the mobile in North Miami hello hey what's up how are you doing sir uh let's lift a big part
let me tell you why I come he don't say nothing about no democrats uh cheap in all that because he's
part because he's partisan he already told you that you've already you've already got the Bob bars
in the uh Ken stars of the world doing that how much you think the White House is paying them
I don't think the White House is paying them anything how much you think they're paying them uh I think
there either paying them or doing some kind of favors for them now they're all they're also making
up the stuff about Bob bar and Bob Livingston he just making it up yeah but what about all the
finger points the democrats are the ones who are the finger point is in the hypocrites it's all
these good Republicans you just are you just keep repeating the same thing over and over again like
a stuck record because you're a silly partisan fool is what the problem is you're a silly person
and no matter how many times I would repeat it he'd keep repeating it so is there any point
on continuing no of course not I'm assay you know both parties generally speak in suck it's only the
the democrats are the buffer party they prevent us from the right wing totally taking over
that's uh what they are around for thank god for that but they're both blushing our tax money down
the drain like it's coming like I was going through a toilet and have been doing it for years
but in the meantime at least if you want to preserve any minimal amount of freedom you just have
to hope that the right wing move takes don't take control which is exactly what they've been trying
to do without even a blood bath here's Miami hello hello yes sir yes um you know this morning I was
listening to a show and they had a lot of Jimmy bachelor's right and everybody they were ripping
him on me everybody was saying um spurious I noticed people is ripping him pretty good there this
morning Tuesday matter oh yeah well I did catch a little bit of that they were talking about
spurious coming down here that bozo yeah that dumb redneck and all he's good for is probably
offense yeah what can he possibly bring to the Miami Dough and yeah but offense and then what's
gonna happen to him yeah he's a dumb moboso so I think for all those Jimmy bashes I'm happy that he
stayed now they can they can die in their pack yeah now they can stick it where the moon don't shine
okay thank god pal can beat that day to meet yeah that's the perfect place up there in
Gainesville for Steve Spurrier that he fits in there like a rubber glove just to keep him there okay
I mean we've already got enough you know it'll be tartos running around this time without Steve
Spurrier coming down here like we got plenty of those already here's Miami hello Neil yes sir yeah I
get uh I'm I'm like a new zone I watch a lot of football and I got this coming I want to know if
you have the center pin that I do I used to look at Jimmy Thompson like a man who never quit you
know you still have this hardcore style of I don't know like defense is a hard man he's a hard man
yeah no not a hard man but you know what I mean so you just said you say it's a hard man which I'm
no I'm saying like I'm talking and now I see him like you I don't know how's it gonna put it like
now he quit and now he comes back like this nothing else but he did not quit that you're you're
nothing out on us he had that mentality of quitting he can go on to a football player and tell him
now you can't quit now now if you want to say no I don't now he can't he can't get to one
player and tell him now I'm out now the time but the fact is he didn't quit you know there are
a lot of people who have jobs including yours truly who have problems with their management or
have falling out or what and we don't know we haven't heard from him yet whatever the reasons
really might have been and evidently he met with the owner of Baldi over there and they got it
straight enough and okay now he's staying but he didn't quit and you're just assuming that
because everybody put in the newspaper and about your losers were on a ranting and raving this
morning on a you know a talk show using their telephone as a weapon again that that makes him a
loser and believe me I got no action run one way or the other with Jimmy because like I said
before he hasn't shown me a hell of a lot but what the other why here because I don't have any
really vector interest and I don't bet on the games 22 till noon let me tell you again 51230
press conference come up Hank will be on from Vegas from through the six he'll have all the
inside and again expect action or job by Hank Goldberg let's give him the employee of the

don't know i go in out of the truck i'm a serviceman but uh some woman called up and said i read
the paper and there's the end of life as i know it because jimmy johnson was at that time was
reporting if he was going to resign the end of life as she knows it yeah i had to turn the radio
off after that and i just have one more thing about the uh senate trial wait wait what what's that
that's on our line that's on the i-stee are we still on the year by the way what the hell was that
are we on what's the succession with hoki well Buffalo has to put ball came the greatest in the land

hell beat the heck out of having a fish on the helmet cuz they're not buffalo whole bills the best
football team what i ever seen in the history of my life they are the buffalo bills the buffalo bells

buffalo bells buffalo bells what would you rather have as a pet a buffalo or a fish
what can be dealt with after who could be a pet like an aliech like a but like a little puppy
dog and probably would do a lot of that in the house for you to could probably pay for training
we have an open line of day five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on the 18t wireless line
portlaughter hello hello yes sir oh yeah um i like what Jimmy Johnson's done so far yeah Jimmy's got a
defense a Jimmy Johnson defense he has a offense lacking a quarterback lacking a quarterback
yeah not like a fan not lacking a running back or why do you see this no no you're lacking a quarterback
can i explain it no of course not you think i'm gonna this first of all this isn't a sports
show this is a special event in the community that transcends the ordinary stuff that we talk about
so naturally we're gonna spend a lot of time and create a press conference but now if you want to do
the merino bashing do it on the other shows because i won't listen to it it's beneath my dignity
to sit here and listen to your crap okay sir and like i've said before it's this is this is just
like the people we're calling in this morning bashing Jimmy Johnson assuming that they knew what was
gonna happen and now let's start bashing Dan merino Jimmy's gonna stay now so let's back Dan
merino was only invested 16 years of his life in his town plus than besides playing the football
then i have a lot of great things for charity and it's well-liked all over time by most people
with a brain but don't confuse people okay don't waste your effort or your breath calling
this show to knock Dan merino yes he's a statue yes he can't run and yes he's no John L.O.
because he's immobile and got too bad knees but still without Dan merino the dolphins last 16
years would have been in the toilet in addition to which where's the where's the recruit the new
quarter where's the backup baby Jimmy Craig Erickson is asking oh yeah zip face forget it
even the mad dog that they was talking about Brian Greacy there how come they let him slip through
their fingers how come they haven't been like you know these people it's like it's like it's
less like a middle illness like Dan merino is gonna play there forever he's gonna be like a
George Blanda of the dolphins he's gonna play the least 110 years old guess what sweetheart
ain't gonna happen well let's blame him because he's a bad guy okay i'm assuming we did all the
spot there Joe yes okay very little technical problem there Zoltan's got lunch thank you very much
thank you to Chuck and E.C. over there across the street thank you profusely for a little bit of
lunch which will also make that blood pressure come down a little bit more that idea dr. Mark's
given that analyte a real real bad idea a dangerous idea that quite frankly i'm just a psychotic
about and guess what my face is still flush and i still got that to whatever it is and it ain't
different than it was yesterday whether they before or we could go circus yeah just cut that out
one is not cut it out i might change it about 10 points but a beep but a beep but a beep but a
everybody you know it's amazing how cavalier everybody can else can be when it's your health that's
it's state that that's the thing that's astonishing me oh it's a little bit of nothing it's not
this it's not that and yeah quit taking that it's a vaso dilator and the moon is on your
reinies and stick it in your rectum and to have a great life you know and the meantime i'm sitting
here not having taken the one that i left this morning and watching my blood pressure go up and up
and up and up to which point i finally took it and of course it takes about an hour to kick in thank
out i took it when i did take it otherwise i'm gonna be sitting here going boy like that with
the foot like this i can be doing my larry flame imitation yeah i don't drool as much so not
yet sometimes in my look like drool here's tempered pine tell all yeah and the alright we're the one
who kept it mentioned but we got that connected about the woman who said the end of life as she
knows yeah sorry about that that was right at the moment that we got cut off the ear and lost
their line and probably bell stop was sabotaging us again i'm sure i'm serious this this show gets
cut off more than all the other shows put together on this radio station we have this i s d n line
which should be their part there shouldn't be no problem with it and almost every day we get
dittled around with here sabotage sure i know my other point i wanted to make was as far as this
thing going on with the president and the senate yes sir i think a lot of it is like you said
is the definite conspiracy it's way too obvious that it isn't and secondly i do believe that most
of the old men wish they had a 24 year old uh humidor alright amen thank you man you bet thank you
those right wingers are jealous because the guys like bob bar there you know he's got some old bag
that he's buying new gingriches he that oh god that new wife of his woo heavy duty and i mean
makes a little trip another trip look like a woman that's how hot she is anyway better do this
the meal Roger show now on five sixy wqa my amy fort lauderdale
there's hang up potted up again would you please because hang is on the right now number now
what is what is that the 207 three three now we're finding out with Georgia's watching some other
relationship you're saying has improved or at least Jimmy Johnson is concerned about the
relationship and what about the post build on the wrong possibility if Dan Reno getting that
extension to remain the quarterback how's that going to sit with Jimmy i think things were a little
icy between them at some time during the season but Jimmy was very abusive and the way he praised
Dan's play three of the last four weeks of the season going into the Denver game he felt that
that Dan had played the best that he had since Jimmy had been there and and talking with Dan
he felt that way before the season ended he he said to me that he felt better than he had in a
long time and i think a lot of that came from their efforts to run the football in a way they
protected Dan and i and i think that they had been trying to they have been talking about
extending Dan's contract which would accomplish two things help him catwise where they already have
about four million going into the off season and keep Dan around for another couple of years
all right how about the addition of Dave Wands dad now Dave Wands dad of course and Jimmy Johnson
close friends a lot of folks that Dave Wands thought Dave Wands dad deserved maybe a little more
time in Chicago he had a lot of time it looked like he was finally starting to turn things around
injuries helped sidetracked at and immediately he has swooped up in Miami what is his role going to
be specifically and is this Johnson flexing his own his own muscles with power i don't think so
i think david's not the power part of it uh... david's want role will be assistant head coach George
Hill is a defensive coordinator did a great job they had the number one defense and points a lot
i think during the regular season and uh... and they have a terrific young defensive team and
George is 64 years old but i know he's going to come back and coach again next year i think uh...
Jimmy has always been comfortable with with a confidant somebody who's close to him david certainly
has been when david's first was uh... new he was going to be fired in chicago
Jimmy advised them that perhaps he's going to get two years of two million four hundred thousand dollars
that's a million two a year that perhaps he might want to take a year off and spend time with his
family and just sit back and sit through some offers i know one of the offers that he had was
to be George Seaford's defensive coordinator in Carolina i think dav uh... might be inclined to
to use this to regroup for himself and i think he'll be a head coach again a league maybe he'll
even succeed jimmy and my amy jimmy has one year left on his contract there's a possibility that
jimmy could step up his general manager but that's just speculation on my part i don't know that for sure
now i think we've got some numbers here as far as uh... jimmy's fourth year in the past uh... he was
very successful in balefin's fourth year winning the first of two super bowls and what about his
fourth year in my amy of course uh... the expectations have been high he is not yet made those
expectations take is this a make a break here for jimmy johnson well i think it's a make year for
jimmy in his own mind and that remember last year too he disappeared for about a month after losing
to uh... indianapolis forty one to nothing on the road and then they played those two games against
the patriots and they finished the season poorly and remember they gave up seventy six points in
the last two road games this year the last game against the land and and that game up in
then for last week so i'm sure he's a little sour that way but just uh... despite that he likes his
defense very much he went in a denver with several injuries jason taylor's best pass rusher and
him bones is best run stopper they'll be back next year they have to make a decision on richman web
who was uh... uh... his contract is up he's a free agent this year they're all pro pro left tackle but
let me follow me a couple weeks ago that this offseason will be totally devoted to building the
offense he feels that that defense is young it's quick it's going to improve he has outstanding
young corner backs he liked his two defensive line picks and Lorenzo bromel and Kenny makes and so
it'll all be offense is your big play receiver big running back another mean line
hey gober we thank you so much for lost Vegas to work the tyson fight can you bring it back
to t-shirt i think he should wrote the one either one which ever one cheaper all right
ok that's good to let go of the work of the press conference that was hank on the sp and news
great job hummer i uh... hammer i'll tell you one thing hank put himself on the map big time he
already was but i mean so far he's in shoulders about all these other tours that sit around
that that that that they don't just talk to the rest without talking to people involved who
really don't know what they're talking about hank knows them all baby when he could that's why
when he came on her and said that with the reading down my mind no no chance
so come up in twenty seven minutes or thereabouts give or take uh... who knows got only watch him
he johnson press conference and which he will now tv stand two open lines and date five six seven
oh five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line and like i predicted the tone and the
the sound of the audience has changed dramatically from what it was just a short time ago in most
of the morning what about from what i heard the assassins have withdrawn their spirits and most of
them have retreated to the back of the building here's a mobile in hollywood hello
yeah no yes sir a couple things first i want to i told you i don't want to thank you both for that
great cds and dates this year yes i took a lot of work on your part yes it is a second
regarding it jimmy johnson i uh... lift close to him down the keys and
couple streets over and i've seen some of the things like you said said that he's done
to help underprivileged philanthropy and so on so forth jimmy johnson not like other people if you
go up and ask jimmy even if he comes in the marina on his boat and you say coach can i have your
autograph no problem i've never seen him say no to anybody and i've seen some of the real big
easterl just that they're just push aside you know and uh... if he was going to leave i'd say the
major reason was knowing him because i i see him around i've talked to him occasionally uh... it
was family reasons you know this dad wants to be near a little bit more time and i think that's
probably what they've worked out it wasn't money it wasn't anything else it was basically he needs more
time to give his dad because he miss his not being with his mom as much yeah
yeah and that has cancer in his underhand chemo therapy and that's it and you have to spend more time
with family and he is i mean i'm sure that that's got to be a part of it maybe the biggest part of it
who knows i mean certainly uh... you know he's entitled to have a chance to speak his mind in about
a half an hour but to listen to the these people this morning coming out of the woodwork like a
bunch of thermites it was unbelievable i'm driving in here and i couldn't believe it i mean all of a
sudden they turn out to sky like a like a cornered rat yeah and there's no reason to because he did
not come to my any for money you know i mean it wasn't a money situation right now that he
came because i often met him i don't know he's not going to sit in the studio a fox with his uh... you
know that cropped here i can all the money one and make it a lot more right anyway that's it
that's a lot okay there you go all your stressons out there all you uh... many acts
and that that i'm so glad that that happened the way they that these people all got caught with
their pants down it's just beautiful because it shows you the true nature of the people in this town
of the so-called sports band of the people in general talk about two faced and backstabbing and
i mean turning like on a dime they can all of a sudden do this so incredible turn around
wow he's shocked anyway with like like for example if they announced tomorrow which of course
it could never happen but if they announced tomorrow that the panthers were and by the way thank
god for shan burk for you panther fans last night if he wouldn't have played great the least what
of what about seven of them last night he's the only thing that's kept those panthers in game after
game for last two or three weeks and you guys better kiss him on the ass but it was going to be an
out let's say he was playing lousy and it was an out that he's been traded the flies for john van
beesbrook then all these people would have said oh we don't like the way he left here he's an asshole
that was at all man he's been playing great thank god we're getting the bees are back bees bees
it's it's just there's no credibility there no credibility whatsoever and then of course when
you come back to what i always say which is that most of them don't know what they're talking about
anyway that that explains a lot of it look at that phone now all of a sudden baby they're
departing like flies on a file open line and broiled all three and date five six seven oh five
sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line that's a line four-letter deal hello
hey real yes sir the afternoon sir when is to you i was at the game last night it's very
disappointed about one i was very disappointed about the score i thought the maple least played a
terrific game i played two great periods and they ran out of steam yes they did they they they
didn't play very good in their own zone in the third day i thought that we were very lucky to wind
up with a tie i mean the late late in the third and early and at over time uh it was a miracle
that the least pull out the tie did you get to enjoy the game the i enjoyed it tremendously and the
people with a little baby stayed home thank god bless them thank them very much and i enjoyed it
very much saw the whole game didn't have people running around in front of me holding up their little
kids it was great that's good we still can't see the goal light down there on the shoe twice and you
know down there are the uh to my right the people all the people that sit on the east side stands in
the a macawena still can't see the goal light and let me say it again i'll keep saying it all year
until they fix that it tells me this is such a bush league organization they don't care
about the fans they don't give a crap about the people that spend all that money to put in
the Wayne's pocket i was sitting right behind the goal actually last night and if i'm correct i
don't even think that goal light that i was sitting behind and works doesn't how do you like that
so that that's a real big league operation yeah yeah well you know the macawena is uh
how much money did they spend on that money 200 million oh public money you can't even get a
goal light to work yeah i you know i volunteered way back in the early in the season i offered i
said who i get some real goal lights in there like they haven't made believe gardens or any real arena
i'll put the bill how much good a cost you know if you hundred bucks
so yeah it's just unbelievable unbelievable but hopefully the made beliefs will rebound they've
been playing well what he's so sad for crying out loud they they pulled the game out of their ass
and tampered the night before they got 51 points they're kicking serious ass so they they look
great last night for two periods that too many games in two short of a period of time and then
the back-to-back games on the road yeah they will run out of team when that happens to you they'll
don't take care of buffaloes fine they'll take care of their own business okay take care of yourself
they have a great day my Johnson is gone boy my gagging that's from trying to eat food while i'm
doing a show try to get my blood pressure down trying to save my life from a bunch of crazy people

bota i said in fact you know something lately every time i see him i don't see the
botanian where maybe they had a pawn is coalition of bota's i think you probably had to sell off
if you want them to make last month's payment um probably there maybe they're going to raise
the money to see if they can get pop out boring i tell you what this this Jimmy thank man everybody has
a story everybody thinks they know what's going on isn't it amazing all these people got caught
with their pants down opened up a big mouth i'm coming in this morning and all these experts
both on the air and the callers that that that that that that they're talking up a storm like they
know something hang calls in here 20 to 11 and just unmasked all of them and makes them all look
like uh pile of crap you you think they'd have learned you know time and time again hang's done
this to all the all the people in the newspaper all the media cause hang knows all the printables
involved and he gets his information directly from those people and this doesn't just shouldn't
read some stupid thing that uh some irresponsible jackass wrote in the newspaper i mean they'd be
better off just to wait for hang to give this report and then write it the next day
yeah i mean it would at least it would be you know that that doesn't kill enough good airtime
at least it'd be accurate right now you're now you're not taking keep your feet on the ground keep
your head in the clouds all right uh we have an open-ended brow it's five so how you always
decision and uh i'm a Jimmy Johnson i didn't i didn't know Jimmy Johnson was black did you
did you know that no what did that kind of do with Mike Tyson what what did she be talking about
does anybody out there know no i'll bend out a shape i think was that Mike Tyson think
the cutter saw cutter he's a scumbag okay a scumbag a convicted rapist and a piece of crap
and a lot of idiots are gonna go out there a lot of morons and pay 50 bucks to watch him beat up
some bum this Saturday out there at the mgm grand and it's pathetic and all i can tell you man
all i can tell you that no for a fact is that's the american fucking way here's a mobile in Miami hello
hello yes sir oh mr. Rogers yes i am i have a problem like you have with the blood pressure
and i had seven botches on my heart in 96 496 and was put on blood pressure medicine i've been able
to take myself off of that due to adkins and garlic yeah taking fresh garlic in the morning
like maybe a clove of it and chop it up a big yeah and it lowers that blood pressure that
distillate in 10 to 70s when i go off that can trouble shoot right up i just want to let you know
and i enjoy your show very much thanks a lot my best advice though is don't stop taking any
prescription medication without using your brain okay even if your doctor tells you to do it
just get a second opinion like George says one of the worst moves i've ever made thank god i got
enough of a brain to bring my little blood pressure thing in here this morning and that adalab
pills just in case as i said to myself what if i go in there because when you're working obviously
your pressure is going to go up and i've been taking this particular medication along with one
other one for like two years and doing very well on it and what if i go in there and don't take it
and then suddenly my pressure goes skyrocketing which it was and i don't have anything of course i
wouldn't have known anyway yeah another stroke of genius nice going you i think George may have
the best idea about this whole thing you know i'm saying okay the second opinion here's a
providence Rhode Island hello how you doing okay sir it's tough being a dolphin finna pick is
you got to rely on some second hand information well down here they rely on 10 ten in for my
child hanko that's true i'm glad to hear him or in his report just just curious i mean i mean
just to add another note that i mean i personally think of Jimmy left we'd be maybe not in
the shambles would be very tough to recover from that uh look i think we're moving forward and uh
i i you know i i'd that would be the worst thing for the team at this point but my question being i
keep hearing i search the internet i keep hearing we need a big receiver which i know we do a big
running back and we need help along the offensive line but the the thing is how are we going to do
this is he going to go out and get a big name free agent receiver i mean i don't see too many things
i think i think shulas said the best we need somehow okay call one of the sports shows call a
pank and talk about that okay i don't talk sports we have an open line of day one in brush see you
see the problem with this there too there are two different aspects it's a major new story in town
which is why i'm talking about it and why we certainly are carrying the press conference but on
the other hand the the people i want to discuss all the interest the sports ever sees do it
someplace else i don't do it and have no interest here's Miami hello how you doing new i'm sorry
i believe in it to use as you started in qm so i got to listen to your um woman catholic you know
the talk and the other day i was in my house my woman catholic talk yeah you know the the
talk about the church in the church right thank you that's what i want you to play and they
church they show this movie called judge they show this movie called judgment i don't
know if you heard of it now it's about the frank the father franko based story and the father
franko gay yeah as the whole story you know and then this kid at the end he gets at the you know
he gets on on trial he in the end yeah he confesses you know about the end you know and then
this says that he's still serving yep he said that he's still serving time so i you know i
just call you to see maybe you want to check that movie out judgment yeah it's called judgment
usually like uh on videos on tv is that i don't know i saw it in hbo okay all right i'll check it out
okay thanks a lot and don't forget pal this is my fact in the church we had an of course you know
you see a bunch of guys running around and dressed with a silly little beanie on i mean that's
uh probably you know that's the way it ought to be right yeah open line of days five so and of course
if you had any questions about you know life or about marriage or about anything in general i'd go
see a guy in the dress every time five six seven oh five sixty pound what are you laughing about
that makes sounds like in that perfectly natural thing to me guess we better do a bright you know
what i'm gonna do Joe not that you care i'm just telling you right up front let's do this a spot
from the next break because that breaks going to disappear you know i'm saying the one that's
written in there and then the rest of the break is that okay yeah that's fine it's okay okay is
it okay okay okay i feel like Dennis James is Dennis James dead by the way yes Dennis James is
that i like Dennis James see now there was all the people i like they're all dead the people i
can't stand like will be goldberg oh see there you go again why you be dishing yeah i'm dishing
that will be which is not as good as making will be but right up there it's all shagged in the church
he started out a regular guy who joined the rectory and made me ultimately sacrificed and bracing
celebrating father of two oh right amen fun fun father of two all three four days as time
was by his earthly me compromise his joy he found the way to get really by all three young
boys father of two amen from holding food time fun father of two all three four days as time

like that train if it was you or it was made like a supper throw the keys away father of two amen
fun thing
fun fun fun fun encourages
fun fun fun fun fun
how do you think that's going to be helpful to that sex
if you're think this is illegal fact in church plot twenty eight were coming up real close on
and bate we like right on the old recto of this press conference we do me Johnson come out
any second what why are you holding that out there i mean i'm watching the
espn news right now and they got rehashing my whole jordan what is it i'm
just pretending oh it's just a prop you're just holding up a prop oh it's the
phone it looked like a prop here's tamarack hello hello yes sir i knew this
now is one of what you're taking on this bmbs concerning uh...
couple for a not i don't think i mean for again the papers which are totally
incorrect about everything else they said this morning uh... you know that
the maybe it looks like we're gonna get him and when we get to get some news
about it i'll tell you that i don't like the guy with the eyes
you're right
here's western hello
hey me oh what up
about jimmy johnson they were sent one guy in western art isn't a guy in
uh... key west was saying that uh... or western whatever sender
he was saying that it sounds like uh... the reason that jimmy johnson would
have left if he had left at all what uh... was because of the family but uh...
i'm not so sure that that's accurate i'm thinking
uh...
all the time that he has in the offseason to be with his family that doesn't
really go well with me what do you think i think it may be part of it you know
but i there's a lot more to it than that
there gotta be a lot more to that you know i think i think we'll wait and see
what he has to say and she fits credible and i don't think i think we all need
to be a little patient around here don't i like those people with a big mouth
in the morning all these colors calling in who ready to put them up on a
cross and let's you know burn it said on fire amen you'll take care of a great
day
okay twelve thirty let's let's see what this uh...
was so i was in that in around davie florida to save the lease jimmy johnson
frustrating and his season is he got his banged up dolphins to the post even
humiliated thirty eight to three to hand for the broncos reports everywhere said
that johnson would resign today in eleven a and three press conference well
johnson had an early meeting this morning thanks to you know we're not going
and then marino and apparently that is not the case that you see he's in earlier
this morning i think that uh... pronto i mean winter baseball
in the middle of my way to get over there
and
and uh...
jimmy johnson has a change of heart and he will not resign as head coach of
the rami dolby's recording will stick around our own and go broke it
there you're joining
uh... you know that was that a talk up or what
and trying to evaluate what was going on jimmy said i know there are a lot of
things during the season
that were bothering him
he's been troubled by the fact that coaching change so much
just in a couple years that he was out in that
uh... it's difficult to deal with players uh... particularly the higher paid
ones
in terms of their responsiveness and
uh... the second thing that bother was uh...
at black monday when five coaches were fired and
he felt that was unjust and it cast some
negative feelings on the profession and his mind and the third thing was that he
was not at all happy with the media in the way that
they treated a lot of stories this year
particularly the week that dammarino through for four hundred touchdown pass and
jimmy
didn't give him
uh... a lot of platoon is postgame press conference which the local press made a
lot of
and the talk shows as well and i know i went into jimmy's radio show that week
and he was very concerned about that he said the means that what i supposed to
do about this you know i'm
if i say something they get me if i don't
they get me so i think that was bothering him too
well the number four has been very significant in jimmy johnson's coaching career
back at my amie threatened to walk he stuck around in his fourth year in one
of national championship in his fourth year the Dallas cowboys he won the first
of two super bowl championships
now the path ahead is to try to get it done with the money dolphins in this
his fourth year
that will be coming up here
meanwhile another surprise announcement happens this morning in the day
day one stats jimmy johnson's former assistant with the Dallas cowboys who
of course was fired by the Chicago Bears on black money a couple weeks back
has been hired at the my any dolphins
assistant head coach of the johnson word has it and when the day does approach
that jimmy johnson steps down his head coach
day one stat
within a soon the title of head coach
of the my any dolphins all right
back to my greenberg now on the fd a new thing
and then the
so there you have and that was beautiful just like i said give hanks and credit
the givethanc and credit so thanks at the end of the sky but step a little bit
so we're still waiting for jimmy okay over there in davis florida and we have
our people's name by it's really kind of said that i'm sitting with do they
have any idea i mean he's a jimmy there are their bodies there
no
he's not there yet
couple more minutes
well a couple more minutes what was he going to fall through the ceiling in
a couple minutes is he going to like spontaneously appear like spontaneous
generation
i think he's a little bit of ground he's one he's going to bust through the
side yeah
like an apparition
like the virgin married a rose a low pusses house that was yesterday this is
today
and with that movie
okay maybe we just squeeze in another color to here because it's any moment
now it's right more at any edge
as you're excited about it
you know here's a mobile in Palm Beach hello
yeah i knew yes sir
this is got all the earmarks of a phil handry sketch yeah
it's gonna be the next head coach right now when it be something if we had
phil handry on the phone doing jimmy's voice that would really be a
world i'm waiting for Brian to come in and say
fuck yeah
is he gonna be that coach him and watch that
funny you should mention that because i think i just saw his post on the screen
who's Brian cox Brian cox he was saying
something like that
number 51 that coach new head coach in my
brain Brian and Eddie jirvin ask you the only two jox they know where they're
IQ on the uniform but anyway
so they're still padding for time and thank god they got more than Michael Jackson
stuff see they knew he i'm but i say Michael Jackson Michael Jordan Michael Jackson
thing completion you know
at least Michael Jordan's got a better haircut and a better nose
where we go in here's a um mobile in kindle
hello
yeah how's it going great
listen uh two things one i am gonna see the mic
tights and fight but it's because i'm not paying for it i got that illegal box
okay and it's or nearly i ordinarily on the air you know i always have to say
that the how are the illegal box and it's a very evil thing but in this case
it's justifiable yeah and the second thing is i was driving out of palmella i saw a car
with a big dent on the side and it says with a bumper sticker Jesus watches over
me i saw he must have blinked
boy yeah how to go near well he doesn't always do a good job you know he's busy doing a lot
of other stuff we have two open i like you know
with these football games like i've always told you what is that welcome
a great addition to our coaching staff
someone that i had known for a long long time
somebody that's going to help us take that next step
and that's they want step they've uh they've and i coached together
at various places at university at Pittsburgh
at Oklahoma State University of Miami Dallas Cowboys
and uh he comes in as my assistant head coach
and when i say assistant head coach i don't mean like they have on a lot of
staff a token assistant head coach he is truly the assistant head coach
in that and whenever maybe i'm not in
mobile like at the senior bow next week i'll be there for a few days if i'm not there the whole
week he will take the role as the head coach when i'm not there same thing
whether that be our meetings here or at any in an applet on and on
you know going back three years ago
i made a statement that i was going to do everything
in my power to bring a championship to the Miami dolphins in three years
i can honestly say that i gave everything that i had
a total commitment to make this team the very best that it could be
although i'm disappointed that we didn't win a championship
i am encouraged that we are very very close
i really believe that that would allow us to win a couple more games
during the regular season which would allow us to have a buy in the playoffs
which would allow us uh to be able to be at home
for the playoffs and have success so i think we're really close
a month ago uh i've started a very trying period
on my mother passed away and um we went through
some time to where in all honesty it opened up my eyes
as far as me realizing that i needed to spend some time
with people that i care about as you all know coaching is not a
nine to five job we go through seven or eight months
of fifteen hour days and i went through that for about uh
34 years in my early days it uh cost me spending time with my two sons
it cost me a marriage and i could see some of these same things happening
and i could say when mother died i realized that i really needed to spend some
time with people that i cared about
ronda rookmaker and myself we plan on getting married
i wanted to spend time with her
and so looking at all this i didn't see a way that i could
juggle everything spending time with people i cared about
and yet fulfilling my responsibility to make the mind the dolphins the best
they could be i visited with Wayne hyzing this morning in
limiteria what uh for people that don't know
he is a special individual uh we have got great people here with my
immediate organization great people with the dolphins
and it all starts right there with Wayne we visited that length
and i talked about Dave and he said you know jimmy he said why is it
you can't just bring Dave in and it will allow you some time
for ronda and your family and yet you've got the quality of
someone that you respect as much as not more than anybody in the national
football league to fill your shoes on those days that you're not there
and uh the more we talk the more it made sense
um i i really think it's going to be a great edition
for the mined dolphins and let me assure everybody of this
my determination and my commitment is not one bit less than what it has been
before if anything else i think there's more resolved there
to get the championship to the mined dolphins i think we have strengthened our
staff i think we have strengthened this
organization and again i think there's even more resolved to make this team
one notch better uh not only did the Wayne
spend time with me but it uh it was important that all the people in the
organization the assistant coaches everybody from
stew to and everybody and then even dan marino came up and dan
sat down with me at length this morning and he said coach he said
we are so close we're really close to getting to where we want to be
and i think you know just the feeling of everybody uh
made me realize that i could you know do what and accomplish what i wanted
to accomplish in both areas and um i did talk to ronda a few minutes ago
and um and uh she's excited about me staying the only thing she said
was um just because you're staying i'm not letting you off the hook you're still
marrying me and so and so i'm excited about it i think it's great for the
mined dolphins and i can answer your questions later on
but now i'll bring up day one step assistant hate coach
it's great to be back in the dolphin organization uh
hopefully this time will be a long to stay than uh the first for some of you
who might not be familiar with i'm talking about i was
coach who will hire me when i was at university my ammy
uh got hired on here as the uh linebacker coach for seven weeks before
ending up in Dallas with Jimmy but uh seriously it's
this is a very exciting time for me to be involved with a great organization
uh with a great owner and Wayne a man who's permitted to do what it takes to
to be the best uh it's exciting to be to be back with Jimmy
someone who i respect uh you know as on a professional level on a personal
level and and we've had an awful lot of success together over the years as
mentioned and and that's the plan here to uh to get that done
as far as uh getting back into south florida you know living here when i
coached university of my ammy my wife and kids are excited about
about the opportunity and the challenge ahead
lastly you know my my responsibility and what i'd bring to the table my
commitment will be to do whatever i can do in any area to to make the dolphins
better and to get where where we all want to get
our defense coordinators George Hill nothing has changed there
hippie browns are offensive coordinator
uh and as i said before davis truly the assistant head coach
and uh he will be involved in meetings just like i'm involved in meetings
there may be times and davel be involved with sitting in with the offensive
meetings while i'm sitting in with the defensive meetings
our vice versa back and forth but this does not upstage
anybody on our staff George Hill has done a tremendous job is a great
football coach and i assured him uh that you know
days coming in is really working with me more than he is with the defense
and George welcomes it he said hey davin and i know each other well he said
davis a great football coach and he said you know i look forward to
dav having input to what we're doing so i think this is a real positive and
and again uh as far as our staff uh George Hill and hippie brown
both remain coordinators well the biggest thing again is
the the feeling that i had was it was hard for me to juggle both
roles and uh and have time for my family which uh is very important to me
and something that i'm going to do uh and yet have a total commitment to the
mind of dolphins uh there will be times that i won't be here
16 hours a day uh and in those times dav is going to be working as a head coach
there's sometimes i love personnel and i love you know
being able to put together the product and so there's no way in the world that
i'm going to miss any of that uh i think that uh
we can pull out my expertise in certain areas
and then we can add to it with davis expertise in certain areas
but as far as uh the feeling that i had as far as maybe not coming back
uh ronda not spent a couple days in the keys uh here the first part of this week
and that's when that was and then when i was able to work out the total
total program was this morning
no i i i never did actually do anything along that line but that
but all the uh the first time i had an opportunity to meet with
Wayne was this morning
do you mean it was because they do not avail it with the children's
this idea would you accept that?
i don't think uh i don't think any of us including myself
can speculate for us what might have happened uh it didn't happen
and again and i want to make sure this is very clear to everybody
you know my commitment and my resolve and you know my efforts
is not they are not diminished not one bit and if anything uh with another
person here that i care about uh i feel even more
responsibility to get in the job done
do you think was there a contact extension?
uh no no this this has nothing to do with contracture
anything like that and so and that was that was never even discussed and
and we had wanted to discuss it.
did you know it's how long have you and you been talking about this
you can think something together and i want to finish the work?
oh davin i talked uh i think we probably had conversations
at least once a week for the last uh
10 or 15 years and i'm not exaggerating
uh he's one of the few people that i i do talk to i i'm not much of a
telephone person as anybody in this room that's ever tried to call
my house might know um i've like i said i don't like talking on the
telephone but there are a few people uh my family
my sons days and occasionally north ferner and that's about the only phone
talk i've ever had
you're going to find me what they're doing?
well there were some uncertainties in that
Wayne hard me to do a job and he he hard me in a certain role
and i had reservations about going to Wayne
in the middle of the stream and saying wait a minute
because of what i want to do with my family
and because i'm getting married and because uh the time that i want to
spend with my father who's after he's finishing
chemotherapies coming down here in a few weeks
because of those things my role has changed and
and so it was hard for me to to go to him and say i don't i i don't want to do
these things i want to change it around and to
Wayne's credit uh we work through all of these things
uh to where we can accomplish what we want to accomplish
you mean there will be a day down the road when you step down
what that happened?
well i don't think we can speculate about that i don't know what's going to
happen when that day comes uh and i think it would be
foolish and i think it would be wrong for us to
say what was going to happen uh only thing i want to happen right now is
i want us to win a championship and i want us to win it this year
Jimmy football has been such a big part of your life how will you be able to
yeah i i'm stealing you know i say step back
who know i mean i step back another hour but at least my plans are
to try to spend more time uh with my future wife
and uh with my father and my two sons um i'm going to go uh out of my way
to spend more time with them because uh in all honesty and and and and don't
get me wrong i don't regret doing anything that i did i don't look back and
say i wish i'd done this or i wish i'd done that
but i can learn from what happened in those first uh 34 years or so
and i think that i can be a better football coach i can be more relaxed
i can be more upbeat and positive if i have a good family life
and uh and people you know you talk to coaches around the league and they say
well you know first comes uh my religion and in second comes my family
and in third comes football and yet they work at football 15-16 hours a day seven
days a week well that tells me football was first
you know and they go to church for an hour a week so and they're with their
family two hours a week so it looks like to me it was football you know a
little bit of family and a little bit of religion you know and that's how it
tells me what your commitment is and my commitment is going to be
the same as far as getting us to a championship
but i will try to spend a few more hours with my family
so i mean how much question do you know my answer to that is how long do you
move to a championship?
the front of the dollar and the economic risk and the
financial situation? why do you think so much of the
effort was the first move? that's what the professional library is
trying to talk about a situation? well it takes time and you know i i don't
want to stand here and say you know what was here and what we had to do
only thing i can say is this you know we we improve three straight years
we we were able to you know take a team and right now we've got a young
talented team we'll have more money under the cap next year
than probably anybody in the league we've got 40 three or four players under
contract right now and 15 more tenders we've only got two
starters they're not under contract we've got to make some decisions almost
two starters we're in great shape as far as the talent of this football team
and as far as what we can do so this is not like
a fiction team this is a playoff team that
advanced one notch in the playoffs i expected to advance again
you know i was all prepared to say this morning that
you know people should not be disheartened because
the best thing in the world is to be the coach that follows Jimmy Johnson
asked Pat Jones that went to Oklahoma state or
took over Oklahoma state our ass dentists and that won a couple of
championships that mind me our ass very switcher who won a super bowl of
Dallas so it wasn't the worst thing in the world to follow me
you know but uh for some of you uh you have me for at least one more year
all right
we need a couple more playmakers on how things i know that and dan and i
talked about it this morning we know that yeah and
you know i defend our people some because they are our people but we know we
got to get better in a couple of areas
no they will not be coaching the position and it will not be a coordinator he'll
be assistant head coach he will he will work with
all three areas offense defense special things just like i did
you got the headsets on sunday i will both have headsets on talking to the
coordinators
who knows yeah did you pick up the papers this morning
Edwin you probably wrote something you know i don't know
hey hey i i can't say what's going to happen a year from now i can't say
what's going to happen ten years from now
who knows i mean i you know you may be stuck with me forever i don't know
all i know is i know what i'm gonna do this year and i'm gonna coach like a
dick and to get us a championship
all these years you're up to do the full thing about not having enough time to
once you have this kind of
the thought is that there's something that you always have to trigger in your heart
that's that i have to do for you
when i went to mother's funeral i they had the viewing the day before and
i i wasn't able to do that
and um
and my sons were there
and you know
you know there's time that uh you pull back and you say
be with some people that you care about
and don't shortchange them
now they care about you they love you
uh there's support even everything that you do
give them just a little bit back and uh that's what i'm doing
the only reason we had a schedule is because that's what my contract was three years
um who knows what's gonna happen three years from now you know i can you know
i can say that we're gonna win this or win that no one can only thing we can
we can hope for i can hope that we're gonna win a championship in three years
the only thing i did know and i and i truly believed in my heart was
that we'd be better and i think we were better
and i would do it
oh uh finalizing everything this morning
yeah i've told them that
how many times i'll tell you that day
about half of those tongue calls
and that's and uh
yeah again a lot of this has to do with Wayne
because Wayne's smart enough person to see that this can work
and i think Wayne knows me he understands me
he understands my belief in what Dave can add to the table
and and saying hey i'd like to see this work
so a lot of credit goes there a lot of credit goes to Eddie Jones
uh
if anybody in their life they have somebody that they
value as being a really good
a really good person
well you know someone like Eddie Jones
and Eddie and i talked about it last night we talked about Dave last night
and so that's where the process started
Jimmy knew that wasn't going to take a year off
i was going to coach and right and my conversations were really
what opportunities might be present for me uh from a coaching end of it
they really had nothing to do with me taking time off
yeah yeah i said all along you're dan and as i told him this morning i said dan i said
we're in position right now that we've got to be a strong enough football team
that we can win without you having a great day
and there's going to be days that you are going to have a great day like you did against
Denver on that Monday night game and that's going to be a bonus and there's going to be times
we're going to need for you to do that but we have to strengthen this football team
hello this is on this is not a tumor each the one to two hour well all right sports fans
okay twelve of the eight is five sixty w two i'm there have Jimmy Johnson's press conference
with Dave wants that and i'm just wondering we'll talk about a moment come back after the break
i'm wondering about some of the egg on the pushes some of the assholes i heard on the year this morning
this is five sixty q a l
on the
long air
want
здесь
I'm going to have to go back to the night
Do this so soon that we'll have to decide
We'll be now in the middle of the kitchen
We'll be just careful
We'll be close to the trees
You should stop getting hot
We'll be in the post
We'll be here
Three people in long hair
In the wings, this is the guy with a hollow melody
Bob and Graham are the patient hair now
I know why I already have
Four miles after about at 5.60 WD Cream
We apologize for all the extraneous things going on
But hey, we got a program director running around like a bulb of the be and heat
Which he's got a lot of practice
Anyway, so this morning here are your two newspapers
Part for the course once again
Now that Don Smiley is out of the picture
The John Henry deal is final with the Marlins
Now we move on to another piece of crap
Front page of the stunt set in the upper left hand corner
J.J. to resign as Dolphin Ted Coach reports say by Dave Hyde
White on the front page
Not the front page of the sports section
The front page of the front section
Here's the Miami Hero
Right hand corner lead story
I mean here's the presidential impeachment on the left hand with the pictures
But the lead story is always in the upper right hand corner of course
Johnson expected to quit Dolphins by Armando Selgero
Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Hill
Report to the Dolphin Ted Quarters today to resign
Not it's reported wait till you hear this
Jimmy Johnson will report to the Dolphin Ted Quarters today
To resign after three seasons as the teams head coach
And a hastily prepared afternoon press conference
He's expected to cite family reasons for his departure
How do you like that?
Is this unbelievable?
And you see the problem with your newspapers is they have a deadline
So they have to go to bed by you know 11 o'clock at night, midnight, one o'clock
Whatever the hell at time as they go to bed
So for somebody to put this and the front page of the newspaper as usual
Show the ultimate the height in the responsibility just unbelievable
Not it is rumored at least the Sun Senals said Fox News was reporting last night
That that's what was going to happen
But Armando said Gero right here in the heroes
He will report to the center
So a lot of people with egg on their push today right
You said it
And like I said when I came on the year this morning
How about let's hear what he has to say
And especially after what he did have to say
And believe me he was a little choked up there a couple of times
I hate to break the news to you but even I know this comes as a shock
But even people who are football coaches and athletes and we're a jockstrap
Even those people when their mother dies or their father dies
Or their mother dies and their father has cancer
These people actually put their pants on when I get a time and have like living and breathing emotions
I know there comes as a great shock to the sports nerds out there
Who never bothered to think beyond the you know what they the odds are on a game
And did my team win for me to make me feel good about myself
And the swill that I heard coming in here this morning man
I'm going to tell you it's just unbelievable by both the collars and the people on the year
Spineless and gutless and there's and that
Right don't even give the guy an opportunity don't even get to the real story
Thank God for Hank let me say it again
Hey stupid! You people when Hank comes out from Vegas in two o'clock this afternoon you have to be
In fact this radio station when he comes back to town
They have to be kissing him all over the place
Well not tough but I mean like you know
No seriously they have to be lined up at the door to meet you greed to plane
With a welcoming home party for the Humper
Because he's the one that finally you know talk to the parties involved and got the real story
Instead of just you know taking somebody at face value
Or taking some report off of a TV newscast or something out of one of our local newspapers
Which anyone should know better than that
It's like this Pavel Brewery think like I said when I see it I'll believe it
When I hear that it's a fate of compilian it's done
Whether he's coming here or going someplace else
Then I'll believe it
So you can you can get as pissed off as you want with me about ripping our local newspapers
They suck! You can't complain about the journalism in this town because there isn't any
Just a bunch of overgrown kids like Armando Seguero and like a very jackass
And like some of these other people maybe a few years older and I'll know better but they don't
Which is why they're here
Very very pathetic egg on the old post
And those of you callers out there
And I know most of you are still listening that called in this morning
And like I've told you a million times I couldn't care less
I don't go to the dolphin games anymore
You know if they win fine if they lose fine
It's not an important part of my life I just don't care anymore I'm not into it
I get the free tickets those club seats they're great seats I don't use them
So I have no accident round one way or the other
But as so typical man of this town don't even give the guy a chance to listen to what he's got to say
And if I could tell you the number of radio every station I've worked on has been like this every news department
Rush to judgment let's go on you know every time there would be an incident that would happen in town
Like a major incident people call on the air
Well you know let's let's start you know judging somebody on the air I won't do it
I've never did it then I won't do it now
Let's start holding a mock trial on the air
Like Haralda was doing with a John Thane
That's beautiful let's hold a mock trial
Let's convict somebody in the media
Only a jackass like Haralda or this something like that
Of course we all know he's a jackass
But those people call in this morning with their venom and he's got less and spineless
And we knew he would do this well guess what guess what
Wrong again
They don't they have omelette on their face
I'm not talking about from the podcast and over show either they have omelette on their face
Well sure there are probably some people would like when not having omelette on their face
Maybe a few years ago I'm not anymore
But yeah not just egg not just not even a scrambled egg a big fat omelette all over their push
They even look worth a little crater push today
Because they rush to judgment because they believe the bull crap in the newspapers
You think that after a while you'd learn your lesson
You learn that when you read something in the local newspapers in this town
You better check it and recheck it and check it again and again and again
And then get a 10th answer just like this
What George told me about Kodo would doctor to get a second opinion
Which I think he's got a damn good point
Because I mean when somebody keeps putting something on the front pages of their newspapers
Time and time again
Because they're too cheap to go out there and get real reporters
And they hear a bunch of stringers and a bunch of pre-pubescent kids
And pretend that these people are news people
How the hell can they have any credibility
Just like I told you the other day
Michael Jordan's got a reason
I don't know it was actually this was when the NBA settled a strike
And the hero because of their insectivorous relationship with Mickey Erison
And the building of that needless arena there in downtown Miami
We call it crap that they pulled with that bogus election
And the role that the Tony Ritter played in there with Mickey Erison hopping into bed together
Put that one over in the public
So more important than the presidential impeachment
Big story leads to a ratified page
NBA settled a strike and spite of the fact that most people said we don't give a crap
Here in there everywhere else in America
That was the most important story
I mean give me a break
The only thing these people are out to do is squeeze as much advertising out of those pages as they can
And try to manipulate for their own profit
That's all they care about
For their own power and their own profit
That's why there's the non-group in Miami that fits you around the sides
Who's going to do what and who's going to be where and who's going to control what
And that's another reason why you'll never have casino gambling in this town or in this state
Is because these people don't want to lose any of their power
And they're a death grip that they got in everybody else
11 after 1 at 5.50
And by the way just mention this in passing because I know the really important stuff is over
But Henry Hyde is opening up his big fat push right now
The impeachment of the president is the trial is beginning right now
We are blowing out your eyes Henry
Go have an affair with somebody's wife
12 minutes after 1 at 5
If you could find it I don't think you could find it anymore
You think you could find it? No
Some jack
By me
I want to know if my Tyson will fight me
Okay
I hope he likes me
He really wants me
I'll be there if he invites me
For 30 million
I'll be a sport
I'll then wail over
Should he want more
And Tyson can fight me
Like a mortgage
For the boxer
For the boxer
For the boxer
For the boxer
Once 17 at 5.50 WQAM
Oh man
Exactly so we did Mr. Mike Tyson press conference
Where was that on? When did you see that?
It was like a TV interview
They were showing the highlight of it last night
Oh last night
I was at the Maple Leaf Panther game
You think I would be watching that QAM
But anyway, so I'm glad he lost it again
And was saying the
Mother
And the stuff like that
He's a real classy guy
I hope you enjoy your 50 bucks
Maybe you have one of those illegal decoders like that earlier guy
Because in this case we certainly wholeheartedly approved
Because it's worth it twice the price
Your South Miami Beach
Hello
Hello Neil
Yes sir
Oh you know mentioning Tyson you know the Holy Feel real deal
That's what the Holy Feel calls himself the real deal right
Yeah
So Tyson wanted to know what the real deal tasted like right
Yeah and moving along sir
Well anyway
You think about Jimmy Johnson
What I can't understand
We live in a town that's mostly Cubans right
He's saturday of people with their
Siturday of people
Okay have a nice day pal
Jackass
Two open lines in date
5 6 7 0 5 60 and 0 5 60 on the 18th
The Cuban saturday of people
I think this guy's been choking the chicken too much maybe his problem
We have that interview apparently
What what?
Red to go
The Mike Tyson
Okay let's hear it
Mike, Francois Bolthas fixed the one on the dog
Are there any concerns in your part?
I don't know anything about that
I don't know nothing about the number that I know what I can do
How about killing this mother
Okay
How about the 19 months fall
What about it
What about it?
Does it pose any problem to you?
Well see I doubt it seriously
You take into the rings a lot of rings
Does that work for you or does it work against you at times
You know who can't win a fight anyway
What does it matter?
Well for example rage against the event of Holyfield works against you
Well f*** it
You're the fight so whatever happens happens
Mike what do you have to talk like that
Well I've been talking to you the way I want to talk to you
You have a problem turn off your station
You know what?
I think we'll end the discussion right now
Then we could
You got it
Have a nice fight Mike
I'm the type of guy with a big squish head
Oh
I went on my fight except the ones dead
Yes I'm the type of guy
He's counted my distinct
And showed him that he's short
And it's boxing with a stick
I'm the type of guy
Who always inserts
I show Carl Williams
That the truth can really hurt
You're the type of guy
That sings and I'm a bomb
So I just said to you
That you I see you as he dumps
I'm the type of guy
With my leaving and my bobbin
I only lost my fight
And the biggest name was Robin
I'm the type of guy
Who makes the people laugh
And put the man down
You know
I'm the type of guy
Who makes the people stare
Just because I keep all
My traction don't keep hair
I'm the type of guy
And the public just attack me
And if you don't believe it
Then you had better ask me
I'm the type of guy
That's where I'm giving him
What you think was?
I'm the type of guy
Robin could have said
Yes I'm the type of guy
Next fight comes to my face
I'm the type of guy
Who makes me all
Come with me
What?
What is my safety?
I mean, he's a fancy guy
Real piece of human direct
Here's the facts
Here's one of our real chronic facts
That's why I hate press conferences
First of all, most of them are with people
We don't want to hear from any way
We have nothing to say
and number two you can never hear the questioners
why the uh... reporters and the media people out there in the audience
including some way back to the room
and it's always
uh...
you know and uh... so it's really really
bad radio but in this particular case i mean it's a lot of stations it's a
humongous story was on the front pages of both our major newspapers this
morning erroneously incorrectly reported incorrectly reported nice going
out
oh my god the egg on your face newspapers baby
i'd be embarrassed
i mean i'm embarrassed enough to work here but i'd be embarrassed to work at
one of those newspapers
even i was if i was just delivering it was a paper boy
i'd be embarrassed i'd have to hide my head and she left over a scheme ask
every morning taken out and delivering the guy that papers let somebody recognize
me
pure unadulterated beyond the shadow of a dot
that's what it is
non-stop
that
here's my baby chill out
yes sir
i was uh... i was watching that the press conference
uh... uh... to me is how they do me
the speaker from the heart especially when you talk about his mother
he got choked up i mean i took up
i mean it's like i said i hit the breakthroughs to people he's a guy he's you
know he's not some kind of a some kind of an automaton machine
he does have a mother and a father and
did have a life while he did have a
but uh... you know he i thought he showed a lot of balls when he still coach
that dumber game and
you know a lot of people could say what they want but i mean he's the right
it is interesting they were not getting for that i had a defendant for that
thing only at least he showed enough dedication to the team that is much uh...
you know and anguish is he was feeling he still felt that that was a
good thing that people expected them to be there and he showed up that's right
i mean you know that in this town you can't please these people no matter what
you do i've learned that the hard way over twenty three years but no matter what
you do you cannot please these people it's never good enough
and even if he would have left and want to see his you know
to be with his mother of any really would have gotten a
yeah i would have you know i mean i'm like anybody else i would have understood that
is mother yeah
but uh...
i'm not here to understand this is my amie he owes them something don't you get
it
i'm glad he's here another year at least and
you know
they get in the phone and every day pal you can see the handwriting on the walls
i think what the deal is he's gonna move a coach for another year
then he'll move upstairs and becomes you know wants that'll move and become the
head coach i mean he practically painted that right out there for you but don't
i g don't say that because then you know i don't want to confuse those people
the newspapers
open line in day five six seven oh five six the in pop five six the on the 18

the ongoing series of done smiley erroneous articles in both newspapers in this
allen snail in the uh... sunsettinal and buried jackass in the herald front page of the
front section front page of the sports section day after day after day month after month after month
and you really ought to say these should be collected that as i should save these the front pages
of both morning newspapers today no you know how people say newspapers from like uh

Yes,
Yes,
Wherein' on the TV,
He was come back,
He was come back,
And he always will be a come back,
And like Hank said this morning,
They've had that deal cooked up for this fight
At the MGM for over a year now,
And it was just that they went through all the motions of this hearing
And getting him his license back,
You know, it's just a dollar and cents,
It has nothing to do with anything else,
He can do whatever he wants,
And it still, as long as they can make the big bucks,
They'll still use him.
I thought he was in therapy though,
Yeah, he's in therapy, right?
He's in therapy,
Should be a nice person.
Mm-hmm.
I mean, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he wants,
What do I say, Chia Trist?
He, he, he,
I want to know more.
Well, I guess what, it didn't work.
Yeah, what do they call it,
Anger control, Anger management,
That's what they call it now,
With all these crazy jocks,
Oh, they need to go through Anger management class.
Anybody else they throw them in a guy,
You know, in a slamer for about five years,
For beating up their women,
As these animals say,
Oh yeah, well, beat up his woman,
Because that's a cultural thing, you know?
No, we don't know.
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello?
Hello. Yes, sir.
Yeah, how you doing? Okay.
Neil, let me ask you a question.
Um, Michael Jordan had a,
A mess conference yesterday.
You didn't show none of that.
How come you showed Jimmy Johnson?
I showed it.
Why did you see that?
Or you put it on the air, me.
Yeah.
Because Jimmy Johnson is a local story with Adolphin,
Which is the Adolphin station,
And everybody in this town
Was on the front page of our papers here,
And everybody in town cares about the Adolphin's Jimmy Johnson.
Really? Are you sure it wasn't because he's white?
Oh, that must have been it,
Because he's white.
That's right. I forgot.
Michael Jordan's black.
Thanks for reminding me, sir. Okay.
Next time Michael Jordan is in the news,
Be sure we don't put it on.
Because he's white.
That's why we talked about OJ so much,
Because he's black and he murdered two people.
If he would have been white and murdered those same two people,
We wouldn't have talked about him.
Would we? No.
There you go. Michael Jordan's black.
Oh, my God. Talk about paranoid.
You're more paranoid than Jeff DeForest.
And that's, that's the ultimate.
That's the ultimate slap I can give you, pal.
You're more paranoid than D-fo.
Here's Miami. Hello?
How'd it do?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Blaster looks like a bell to climb.
Oh, okay.
Open line of date.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on.
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
You're on the old hot sauce today, baby.
They're on the big jungles used today.
Here's Miami. Hello?
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I just called the community and
Thanks for doing such a great job on a brick and storage.
Well, next to one did all the work.
I just had it here and took his call.
That was great.
But the fact that you had it covered.
Yeah.
We're no one else with, when everybody else was
jumping to conclusions.
Right. And the fact is that I kept saying all day.
How come, how about we sit back and see what he has to say?
Right.
Because I was ready to jump to conclusions just like basically
everyone else was wanting to hear.
I mean, this guy was called every name in the book.
I don't hear anybody apologizing by the way.
You're saying, oh, well, you know, maybe I could prematurely
or maybe the media, you know, led me down the garden path.
I don't hear any of these people with the cajones to call and say,
well, I said the wrong thing.
We're out of line.
Right. That's what I mean.
They just crucified this guy.
They gave him a verbal lashing.
And basically for what?
It's not, I mean, did he do a bad job here the last three years?
No.
Every year they won one more game this year.
They want to play off game.
And, you know, and then they got the crappy out of them
by a far superior team.
I just wanted to call you a thing.
Way to go.
Oh, all right.
Thanks a lot.
Have a great day.
Okay.
What do you say?
You said it puts the lotion in your casket.
We have an open line to date.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60 and 05, 60.
On the AT&T wireless line.
Yeah. We didn't carry the Michael Jordan press conference
because he's black.
See, I guess I must like John Connures from Michigan
because he's light-complexed black.
That's why I like Malcolm on the young and horny.
Real light black and just beautiful.
Hmm.
How are you doing, Malcolm?
Where are we going here?
Here's a mobile.
And that's probably why we don't like Mike Tyson.
I'm sure we two dark.
A mobile phone.
A lot of people.
Yes.
What is it?
Yes.
How are you doing?
Okay.
Listen, Neil.
I'm one of those couple of weeks ago you were asking for crossover guys.
They're listening to the first game.
The cross-dresser?
Yeah.
Yeah.
The cross-dresser listens to the listening.
Yeah.
There you go.
Anyway, I have that.
I heard that.
I've been listening to QAM's about 10 this morning.
Right.
And the only thing I commend you, you were absolutely right
with what you said about John's.
I've been listening to you all day, off and on all day.
And the only thing is, is I didn't hear everybody cut
and everybody up dimmy this morning.
I heard a few minutes of it.
No, I heard a few disgruntled jet fans.
No.
And it's up with disgruntled marino.
No, I'm not talking about jet fans.
I'm talking about dolphin fans.
We're ripping them assed.
Because I think the band was out there.
I'm just telling you what I heard when I was coming over.
How about making that up?
Nobody said, nobody said you made it up.
I just said that when you talked about it,
if it's only heard about a half hour to 40 minutes,
it'll hold a whole.
It takes you up.
35 or 40 minutes to get here.
And during the time that I listened,
which certainly there was a lot of calls that came in during that period.
And plus what Joe and D.Fo were saying,
most of what I heard was just,
it was just caustic and slicing.
Yeah, but those guys, Joe and D.Fo,
listen, if D.Fo doesn't stir up controversy,
he doesn't feel like he's a part of the show.
I mean, they're great.
I've been listening to them, and I listen to you too.
Yeah.
And then I go right into hang.
But I got to tell you, every now and again,
the media gets a little out of hand.
Okay, I have a great thing.
Thank you, sir.
I really, I really, I really,
Okay, thank you.
We have an open line in the Broward,
56705, 60 and 0.5, 60 on the 18 years.
What is he laughing about?
What is this man laughing about?
Does anybody know?
Anybody, sit down.
Oh, Santa, Mickey,
the oldie thrive on that arcade.
Our building, Santa Rita,
scores up a happy new.
Happy to a Rita,
somehow don't seem right.
Better ask your phone for financial advice.
When the hands lock down,
there's no basketball.
They're all outstrike.
Ruck's work will play sound,
and insurance chest would show the nice.
Before we use our ass,
take a tan of gas.
Oh!
Like that, that's that.
All right, that's that.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
143, 143, 143.
Here's a great fact from Nancy,
a big, gym-and-its, friends.
Yeah!
This is when you're giving Hank Goldberg credit
for bringing the voice of reason accuracy,
which he was today, baby.
I mentioned also, gym-and-its.
I heard his broadcast last night on Channel 10 saying
that he thought that this men's JJ
would become general manager in day one,
so it would become a coach,
not entirely accurate,
but at least a better estimate of this situation.
Right on, Nancy,
who else in the world would say,
where you fudge back?
Love that gym-and-its.
I told you before,
gym-and-its is God.
And Hank, I tell you every day since I've been here,
I would go home listening to Hank
until those awful press conferences.
I'm not talking about today's press conference,
but those other ones.
And he made a joke about it this morning.
And I just can't deal with that.
Please, after I get home, in fact,
what I should do is call Hank here every day,
call the producers and say,
okay, I'm home now,
let Hank put on the press conferences.
Because you can't, first of all,
if you wanted to hear what most of these vozos were saying,
which I don't,
but if you wanted to,
you can't hear what the questions are anyway.
Hey, you think a coach can come over here?
I mean, what is that?
Well, but it comes to really getting the story
and putting it where it's at, baby.
There's nobody like...
Nobody likes a hump,
I'll tell you that.
That was funny.
Here's a mobile in Weston.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Great.
Hey, that was watching Channel 6 last night on the Segurdo.
You should have seen his face.
His face?
And he actually said,
I just confirmed this,
a few minutes ago,
Jimmy Johnson is with.
Uh-huh.
Nice going, Tony.
You jackass.
You silly.
I told you he's a silly goose.
Oh, my God.
People are incredible.
And about the Michael Jordan thing.
Who cares?
He's got enough money anyway.
Well, we already knew that.
There was no surprise there.
I am.
What did he have to say?
He's going to spend time with his kid
and have a great life.
You know, and great.
Good luck to him.
All right, Neil.
Thanks, man.
Have a great day.
So you loved Michael Jordan or you're indifferent about him
or maybe you hit him like poison?
But what was there to say?
He had nothing to say.
It's just another stage,
media events,
so they could kill a lot of time
and make a big storm of dance
and try to stuck some viewers in there
because, you know,
I mean,
the only other thing that's going on
is the impeachment trial of the president.
I mean, that's not important.
Is it?
No.
Okay, so don't forget about that.
Open line and date.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60.
On the AT&T wireless line.
Here's Hollywood.
Hello.
Hello, buddy.
Yes, sir.
How about Hank and Hank are there, huh?
Yeah, he honked up a good one today.
You sure they would.
Let me ask you a question.
No, I'll just leave you a group of you on this.
No, I'm just sitting.
Something just don't fit right
with this situation here.
Did you not fit right?
It doesn't seem to me.
Maybe you can agree or disagree.
I don't really.
I just got to understand it.
Yeah.
Okay.
It would bring his best friend down.
Give him a assistant head coach job.
Okay.
He slaps the media with all.
He's going to quit or whatever.
Or the room was going on.
You know what they did?
There was any kind of money.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
How do you know he started the room?
Is there going on there?
The room was, they didn't quote him.
They quoted people, the assistant coaches and people in the organization.
What about, what about, what is father?
His father said that he was going to retire.
He had heard his father.
No, he didn't call his father a liar.
He said that.
Yeah.
He didn't call anybody a lot.
That's true, but I mean, you don't think there's no money involved.
I mean, in regards to where his best buddy comes down here and he gets the assistant head coach job.
Yeah.
In other words, you don't think Dave Wonstell is qualified.
Is that what you're saying?
Oh, I'm saying that.
So what is the point?
Maybe how about if Dave Wonstell came down to your coach for free?
Would that make you happy, sir?
No.
Okay.
Thank you.
We have an open life.
Well, I'll tell you.
Like I said, they're just, they're all looking for an angle.
They're something mysterious.
They're something bizarre.
Always questioning.
I'm not like I told you before.
You cannot come to this town and do good.
It's that's not sufficient.
You must have an ulterior motive.
You must be basically a real son of a bitch.
You must there.
There's got to be something behind it all, okay?
Because generally speaking, whoever you are and whatever you do, we don't like you.
One open line of Dave wanted, Broward.
560705, 60.560 on a AT&T wireless line.
Mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Hey, Neil, one journal.
Back to you.
I'm a party, too.
Not that good of you.
But anyways, I've been Italy a couple times.
You've been near the lake, Cornwall.
No, I have not.
I've seen Merriol Cormon TV many times, but.
Okay.
There's a good movie.
I've seen Perricone always trying to sing.
Life is beautiful in Italian movie.
You see it?
No.
I heard it's great.
I saw it.
Very good.
And I just want to put my two cents about Jimmy Johnson.
Yes, sir.
I mean, I follow sports, but it's not my life.
I really don't care if he's here.
He's not here.
I mean, I just want to follow this morning.
I mean, this is not the end of the world and these people that are going off the deep end like Dan LaBanford.
And the woman I called Weeping on here in the morning showed this morning like this is the end of the world.
I mean, like you said, sports, keep it in perspective and get a god damn life already.
It's just like Michael Jordan.
I enjoy watching the big deal.
It's going to change my life.
I really don't know.
I wish I had his mom.
Absolutely not.
And yes, I want to hate to break the news to these people.
We play in Chicago anyway.
He doesn't play here.
A couple of games, the eerie plays here.
Other than that, he doesn't play here.
Maybe a game you don't want to weekend on television.
That's it.
I think if you get back to talking about Italy.
Okay.
Have a great day.
I'll be going to see.
Bon journal.
What open line in the day two and broard?
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
I'm still waiting for these people to retract their disgusting protest comments from this small world.
