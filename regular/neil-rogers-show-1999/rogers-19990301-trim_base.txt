Sports Radio 560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale presents the Neil Roger Show.
We're going to talk to Neil called 560 560 toll free for David Brown or Count 560 on your cell phone.
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers or anyone else on the show do not necessarily reflect those of WQAM easily read acquisitions or the Beasley Broadcast Group.
Now, Neil Rogers on Sports Radio 560 QAM.
Don't take any bulls**t on them.
That's Neil Rogers' like it was got to donate to the quiz in his side.
Smoke of good souls and ride around in his head.
He got a radio show.
He's just on the chair.
Are you happy anniversary to Neil?
The only thing in this town that's real.
You turn.
He fall into a mile from round just to hear that famous farting sound.
Turn around the edge of the inside.
Take the Braddock and stand with the light.
Take the fun of the marital bandage.
Oh right.
Neil Rogers, you're the best.
Well, Jerry.
You really put Miami to the cat.
Neil Rogers always doesn't know who they are.
Neil Rogers turns blind.
Tosses you a bit.
Neil Rogers, the only thing we'll miss when I go.
I went away for a weekend to start a town fart at blow.
Happy anniversary Neil.
I love this show.
Okay.
That was 2550 WQ.
I'm happy Monday boy.
This overhead is real funky today, man.
Real strange.
It's either like too low or don't mess with it.
Don't mess with it.
How George do last week?
You okay?
Yes.
Great.
No.
Okay.
Pretty good?
Yes.
Well, yes.
Sensational?
No.
Okay.
I got a fact.
Well, this is the, you know something I've come in here this morning?
And I didn't even realize it's March 1st.
It's happy anniversary.
Neil 23 years on the year in this town.
How do you like that?
Are you concerned about that?
No.
Do I have a card?
Yes.
You come George.
I have one card.
That goes to show you 23 years on the year in this town.
I've got one card.
Happy anniversary.
George.
What does that tell you?
23 F in years.
Even if I was on here like with 0.1 shares.
Even if I was on here like a little bit of the 23 years.
I'm faking my way through.
And I get a card from George.
Not that I don't appreciate the card,
even though I just ripped it up.
I'm not being on cards, you know.
Because I mean, what do you do with a card?
You look at it.
Yeah.
That's nice.
And then you rip it up and throw it away.
It's basically like I just did.
So anyway, I come back in the first thing that greets me.
Well, I get in the car this morning.
Of course, I hear it.
I hear that sound.
That raspy sound.
And I thought, oh, no.
Now I know I'm back.
Now I know I'm here.
I heard the raspy sound of the goldster on my radio this morning.
And I immediately popped in some music.
And I said, all right.
Here we go.
Feel like I'm back in Europe now.
Come in here.
And the very first thing that I see in here on this counter
in front of the board is the facts that George was kind enough to say.
Thank God for this.
And this is appropriate because 23 years on the year in this town,
one thing about Miami, unlike the hallmark people who care enough to send their very best,
Miami always cares enough to send their very worst.
Kind of like the sausage man, they always send the worst,
whether you want it or not.
They've always got a complaint.
And just what we needed was another no-life misfit.
Who doesn't have the balls, by the way, to sign his name or its name,
or whatever it is, just J-E in Pompano Beach.
Probably short for J-E or K, but nevertheless, J-E.
Great facts.
Dear WQAM.
Now first of all, you understand this, dear WQAM,
that's like writing to dear Uncle Sam, huh?
In other words, like WQAM is like a person, a thing.
I'm trying to understand what the deal is with your radio station.
Now just relocated to this area, you are currently a sports station when Hank is not talking about how he cut in line at some fabulously overpriced restaurants.
And basically, while waiting for us that same night.
And of course, when Neil Rogers spelled with a D,
is not talking about how the fans of the media in this town know nothing about hockey,
that is to say what he's not talking about to Pope, the media, the Republican Party,
or performing Felatio on a South American male with a foreskin.
Oh, Viery, insightful and entertaining.
The Shock Value is minuscule, it is a lame act.
Shock Value.
Is this supposed to be shocking?
No.
No, it's four hours of entertainment whether you like it or not.
Shock Value.
As in blow it out your ass, whole.
As I might imagine, you go over the money lead.
What a concept.
But perhaps you might not lead us so much in thinking that you are a sports day.
First of all, is this a sports station?
No.
20 hours a day at this sports station.
I'm going to tell you right now.
I haven't been away from here for 10 days.
There is nothing in there.
I'd rather hear somebody go and do something like that for 20 hours a day than hearing people talk about sports.
If there's been a more terminal and I don't care what the power is that be think about this,
it's just a fact.
It's a group circle jerk for a bunch of no life overgrown adolescents who refuse to grow up.
If there's a more boring format than all sports radio in America, I haven't heard it yet.
So thank God for this show of giving people a four hour break so they're thinking like, you know,
build their constitution back up, do you hear more about what the points for it is on Villanova Vassar tonight.
On a Hofstra temple game.
On the temple Yashiva game.
But anyway, GE goes on to say,
here's an idea.
One that actually involves sports radio, the Jim Roam show.
I'm willing to bet you can make money and still keep your moniker.
I thought we were done with her until Barbara Walters comes on with that crap and the books coming out Thursday.
You might want to check the references across the country for this indicated program.
Here this guy who moved here from I'm pretty sure I know where because we'll get to that in a second.
He's such an expert.
He's telling us who Jim Roam is, okay?
Maybe you'll even tell us who Dr. Laura is, who Howard Stern is, who all the other syndicated people from around the country are.
Time don't like us.
Think about it.
Jim Roam, noon to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday.
Tank can have a couple extra hours sleeping off whatever fair he died just at the night before.
Needle can find a platform.
I suggest a soap box in the port authority of New York, New Jersey.
Is that a good idea where J.E. might be from?
That actually suits his whiny act instead of demanding the listeners do.
By the way, Neil, when I was to listen to real issues, I'll dial up NPR.
Please, here's the best part.
Please curtail the Dreck you currently offer.
Concerned J.E. in Pompadal Beach.
He's concerned.
J.E., who, like I said, hasn't got the ball.
Even it sounded like a first name.
Much less the whole name is trying to say, I have no life.
But just doesn't know how to get right to it.
So we go through this convoluted way of all around the Mulberry bushes saying, I have no life.
And obviously there's not another misfit.
Just what we need another loser from New York.
Maybe this guy's like from Anglewood, New Jersey.
Because they probably wouldn't let him across the goddamn bridge.
Maybe he's waiting to meet William Holden at the foot of the George Washington Bridge.
What a jackass.
And is it interesting, by the way?
Another one of these guys, and you know he's listening right now, whoever it might be,
can quote, chapter in verse as much as he is repelled and as grotesquited.
And here's the Suda Winelocks who let here's all these important issues discussed on National Public Radio.
But listen to the Jim Rome show.
What does that tell you?
Week, I mean, can tribe controversy the most anxious, the most pathetic.
Assuming that we were, that anybody with a brain wants to hear about sports 24 hours a day.
Do they want to hear the Steve Cain of Sports Talk Radio?
No.
Jim Rome, who, the, oh my god, look at that uniform.
It's dirty.
Don't you, I like it.
Lawn in the uniforms before you come out here on the field.
No.
And he'd like to make a four hour show out of that.
Garbage.
But nevertheless, thanks for your programming tips, J.E. and Pompato Beach.
And we're delighted that you're listening.
He knows everything chapter in verse just like all the other Rene Sayers.
Every goddamn thing that I talk about on this, on this show.
Because he can't turn it off.
But hey, maybe we can get the Jim Rome show like from two to three in the morning instead of that scratchy voice.
What's that, the Ferrell on the radio?
Oh, God.
And there's another example of the sports nerds.
You could put a, you could put a goddamn monkey squealing on.
If you could somehow spit out the goddamn odds in the sports course.
And these same nerds would be listening to it.
Terminal.
Colma inducing.
So by the way, Niels, you have a good time at Amsterdam.
Yes.
The weather.
Terrible.
Food.
As usual, awful.
Great time.
Yes.
How do you like that?
Now, if you come here and the weather is awful and it's raining on stop.
And you have lousy meals.
Is there, is there a possible way you're going to have a good time here?
No.
But an Amsterdam, it's like going to Vegas.
It can be pouring in Vegas.
I mean, there are those periods of time when I had like those flash floods, you know.
And the weather is really crappy or really bitter cold in the middle of January.
And you still have a great time.
One thing about here, even when the weather is great, I don't want to say it.
I'm going to say after 10 at 5, 60 WQM.
But your is great to be back, baby.
23 years today on the year in Miami, man.
I will never make it past the first couple of months.
Or is our concerned Christian coalition lady, by the way?
Since it's March 1st and she was telling me that on January 1st of this two months ago,
I'd be off here.
Where's that bitch?
Okay.
I said, come on.
Say for the memory of your days that I am seen.
See a foreign KAT.
And the label.
And now you work for Cox and Cox's children up for me.
No.
Yes, thank you.
A gold medal.
Say for the number one.
Show your Reynolds, Randy Crowe.
Here he grew up to like a show.
And every other king in the ass that fed through I'll be gold.
Oh, yes, thank you.
A gold medal.
One thing here is a safety business.
And you have a change of it.
Even though you have to pay their s**t.
From P to G.M.
They're all like Vicky M.
Yes, they are all on the verge of hockey as a bird.
And yes, those folks heard you heard now that we think of it.
Your channel and as we work, I f**k you.
And gold.
1015 to 560 WQM.
Man, I tell you one thing.
You come back to Miami to see the big headlines here in the front of the lifestyle, the living sections.
Neo Rodgers, 23 years on your anniversary.
Did you see that?
No.
No, it's up there.
Just like the money we raised for a center one.
And you see it's only the first of March.
Anything getting ridden about that?
No.
Pulled you.
And I don't mention it because I expected to be written.
I just mentioned it to point out the fact that it is not because no matter what you try to do in this town,
if you're not one of the inside sucklings, they don't give a crap.
Right, buddy?
Nevin's ain't that right.
Yes, hold.
So here's the facts from Bill, happy anniversary, et cetera.
It's just thanks for 23 years.
There you go.
You're going well.
And here's the fact that says George amazes me when he fills in for you.
He shows our intelligent, funny and entertaining.
George is more to say in one of the four-hour periods than Scoot, Steve Kane, Greg, Mike Church, Karen Kay,
Passion Phone Bitch, Joey Reynolds, John Ford, Rick Riley, and Alice Rantell all combined.
How do you like that?
It says.
He should have his own show after he was the fact that he hasn't been hired as a talk show host
and crap like Brooke Daniels and Steve Kane keep coming back and back and back and back.
It's proof that this radio business is a joke.
Signed Dave.
Well, Dave.
Absolutely correct.
Are you right?
But it's a crap business.
Wait till I get to that talkers magazine thing.
So some really heavy duty news while I was gone, number one being, of course, the Gene Siskel die.
Now, you know, we've had a lot of people die and last this since I've been on QAM.
In fact, some of the people on the ear here, I think, are right in that.
Well, anyway.
But, you know, they're coming to go.
That's life like I keep trying to tell you.
Oh, and by the way, don't buy the farewell to God book.
What are you looking at me like that?
No, you're by Charles Templeton.
You want to know why?
You don't need a book.
I was thinking about this while I was on vacation.
Why, what does anybody need a book to this prove this bull crap?
Anybody that would believe these silly fairy tales and life after death and the spirit and the angels
and all of this other stuff, man, you've got to immediately seek out a shrink.
But anyway, so Gene Siskel dies.
And the fur, I know this is a bad thing to say.
But the first thing that comes to my mind, because I know he had the brain tumor in the operation, and I said,
I just got through reading an article a couple of weeks ago about he thought he may have come back a little bit too soon.
He wasn't doing that great, but he was going to be okay.
All of a sudden, he's dead.
53 years old, dead.
Somebody I liked.
I enjoyed Gene Siskel.
He knew movies.
He wasn't an ass kisser.
If he liked the movie, he would tell you.
If he hated it, he would tell you.
And so my first reaction is, how come it couldn't be the fat one?
No, seriously, my very first reaction was, I mean, I don't want anybody to die some horrible death.
But if it has to be one of the two, how about Roger Ebert?
That damn fact that I can't stand up.
Yeah.
Fat annoying.
He's extraordinarily annoying.
He just gets on my nerves just to see him makes me, yeah.
Cringe.
So Gene Siskel's dead.
God damn it.
But I didn't know the Lord works there.
Yeah, right.
There they go with that crap again.
Thank God that I was away for like 10 days from any of that.
Didn't hear any of that, bull crap.
Didn't see any of it.
Didn't encounter any people that like are involved with any of that.
And I thought to myself, yeah, I must be in a real place.
Then I came back to America.
Then I read the international hero tribune a few days ago about the grease man.
I guess George talked about this last week.
George talking to response.
What?
No response.
No response.
I read excerpts from the article in the paper.
Nobody called about it.
Not one.
Not one call about the grease man getting fired in DC.
Because he made another one of his tasteless comments.
See, I personally, I know, I know that I'm one of those guys.
I could have said the same thing.
There's some of the remarks he's made over the years that I would not have said.
Because you have to know where the line is.
They have to some kind of a line where you draw a little bit of a line.
But he played one of these so called hip hop records.
And by the way, what the hell is hip hop?
You know, rap music.
That wasn't good enough.
And of course, they left a lot of people started putting the sea in front of the rap and showing it for what it is, which it really is crap.
And so now all of a sudden it's hip hop.
But anyway, he played some hip hop record by some black recording artist by some bitch.
And when he got done playing a record, which he obviously hated like poison, he says, now you know why they dragged them from the back of pickup trucks.
And now what am I close?
Yeah, I think the articles in the pile of papers back there still.
Yeah.
So yeah, now you know why they dragged them behind pickup trucks.
Right, which is a very crude and tasteless remark.
But should you have gotten fired for saying that?
No.
Because obviously, number one, it's taken out of context.
And number two, you know where this guy is coming from.
He's irreverent.
Right?
No, I think he's the racist.
Well, what's the difference?
So seriously, I mean, the problem being that he's in Washington, okay?
There's too many, there's too many sparsers in Washington to go on a year and say something like that.
You don't come to the nation's capital, Greece, man.
No matter how many years you've been or doing very well and making millions of dollars, you don't come to nation's capital.
But all of the sparsers running around and make some kind of comment like that.
That would be like going on here and saying you're celebrating Martin Luther Cunday, something you just, you just don't do those things all he's done much worse.
But nevertheless, so he got canned, which I think was an act of total.
But that's America again.
So you can't really say what's on your mind, but I'm going to say today, anywhere with time I mind about something having to do with that and answer them, which I've told you before.
But now this time I noticed even more than ever before.
I don't know about you, but I'm not one of those people that's too crazy about having a lot of drug peddlers out on the streets who are like very blatant and flagrin.
They all happen to have one thing in common, but anyway, we'll get to that.
Here's a pompano. Hello.
The homemade Rogers, the stick to 23 years up and that's always happened.
Okay, thank you.
20 minutes and 47 seconds.
He waited for that a very, very poor.
He thinks he's going to get on the thing.
First of all, it's this overhead again.
So that's our fault, sir, but it was pretty weak.
You'll never make it.
He's hoping for another four years of posterity with that craft.
We have an open line of date, five six seven, five 60, pound five, 60 on the mobile one line.
Happy anniversary, Neil.
Thank you.
tremendous outpouring of mail and emotion here today.
Was there?
No.
No, actually, in fact, Sam, the promotion man, Sam Dusberg came down here with Duff Lindsay with a big banner that they made up for me.
Happy anniversary, Neil and Sam says, well, how was your vacation? Did you miss us?
I said, yeah, I was thinking about you, Sam, but I still came back.
Here's a mobile and crawl spring. Hello.
Mobile and crawl springs.
Deal.
Yes, sir.
How are you?
Great.
First thing I have two things.
First thing I wish you a very happy anniversary.
Thank you.
And the second thing is you probably know my name.
I don't want to give you my ad by my, my, my business, but I did work at your house once.
You did your house?
I did work at your house once.
Really?
Yeah, I purchased your coin.
You remember?
Yes.
George knows me too.
Right.
Right.
I will, for your anniversary, do anything you want for your birthday?
Yeah, you're right, Ty.
Okay.
Well, thanks a lot, my friend.
Okay.
And have a great day.
Bye.
So yeah.
Agriculture Department scientists say they have made a major stride toward developing an allergy free rubber.
Great.
How you doing, Henry?
Happy anniversary, Neil.
Thank you so much.
Here's the great Henry Burrow by the way who survived W.I.
Do you still do it at Make Police Show in the morning?
Absolutely.
Was Roger Magdalen?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're still there.
Well, I don't understand.
Because I heard the day, the first day that Reniri went off.
Yes.
And you were, they were playing music and then you came on in kind of like a lost child.
Like, well, we don't know who's going to be here yet, but we'll let you know when they are.
Where Mike is going and you're still there.
Yes, I are.
So I guess they just don't know about it yet.
It's the show is owned by Henry Burrow Productions.
Really?
Yes.
So in other words, you kind of came in and when Reniri got put, I don't want to say you pushed him out because that would sound bad, you know?
Right.
Right.
Which I did not.
Oh, no, that's why I didn't want to say it because I know you're not going to kind of guy that would do that.
Oh, I know.
Unless, of course, it was for survival, which is the problem.
Well, survival was purchasing the time.
Right.
Well, I don't understand.
So in other words, you purchased the time?
That's right.
Well, I'm confused then because they must have given you a different deal and we're going to give him.
I don't know.
I, I, I, it's broken.
Procured radio and then.
But you understand what I'm saying because Reniri got off of there because they wanted to charge him some exorbitant amount as you know, which he was going to have to work like 80 hours a day and not make any money from it.
And then you're coming on there.
You must be doing something right.
You must have naked pictures.
I, I think a pretty exorbitant price.
Do you?
Sure.
And who's selling your show?
I am and my partner, Mark Benson.
Uh-huh.
Mark, were you partner Mark Benson?
Yes.
Not the Mark Benson.
Yes.
Not the Mark Benson formally of citizens of the United, Mr. Antibyling will history.
Not that Mark Benson.
Mark Benson.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, do we make a nod couple or what?
Yeah.
Strange.
By the way, I thought of you at Skippel Airport.
Yeah, that's, that's a good place by Cuban cigars, by the way.
It is.
What a great airport, too.
I love that airport.
No, I didn't think about you because you were the first one that I ever spoke to who knew how to pronounce an envelope right.
It's a great airport.
In fact, you could put the whole city of Miami in the Skippel Airport and still have room left over.
Yes, you could.
Is there still, as you head out the front entrance, is there still a BP station there?
Yes.
But, but inside, they've, I mean, you wouldn't even recognize it.
There's someone there.
Of course, they got all the birdings all over the place, but just the enormous numbers of shops that they'd say it's miraculous.
You know, the amazing thing I found there, too, is that you can get the latest English, English language novels.
Right.
Before they appear in the States, even.
Yes, sir.
It's a good place to be.
Now, you're not doing this kind of material on a morning's show, are you?
I'm waxing.
I'm doing whatever I want.
So you're playing like old piggy lean music and stuff like that?
No, no, I know.
What are you, what are you doing?
What can I, I maybe I'll even listen to moral.
Well, I do the news at the top and bottom of the hour.
You know, we discovered something untapped and I really would like to get your opinion on this.
Roger Magillin's my business editor.
Yeah.
Everybody considered Roger kind of a goof because of the personality he was given.
Roger's a former stockbroker.
He's a former stockbroker.
He's a former stockbroker.
Right.
And he's a day trader.
And he really spends a lot of time working on his business reports.
And I think they're good.
And consequently he's on it a quarter after and a quarter of each hour.
And we also have a sports guy who has just started with us named John Roberts.
I'm getting a little tired of that crap.
I can tell you right now.
Yeah.
And what's Renery doing?
And we have, I don't know.
And we have Sean Toner doing traffic.
We have a full service morning show.
Great. Well, I wish you all the best and you're okay in my book.
Thanks.
And you know, you know, your daughter doing by the way.
She's doing wonderfully.
She's now the assistant manager of the Beverly Hills restaurant complex.
I'll tell you if I were that persuasion, I would have wished her off and he looked with her years ago.
Or she's unbelievable.
She's a big fan of yours all doing ask me to tell you happy anniversary.
I said my wife's Andy.
Excellent.
But I would like to say one thing.
Briefly, yeah.
Because we were talking about you this morning on the show.
Really?
Yeah. Mark and I and explain to you the people who have never heard it.
If there's never been a better baseball play by play man in this town or probably any other town.
Yeah.
I think you were going to be a event.
Right.
A big fan of that too.
Well, I'm working on this talk here with them.
Well listen, I'll be listening tomorrow, Henry.
Okay, Neil.
Thanks a lot.
Take care of yourself.
Okay, so Henry's still a micronary show.
How do you like that?
Neil Rogers, right?
I used to have to use it.
It pissed me away.
I'd be busted.
Now I got to give all my houses away.
I'd be busted.
Yeah.
The United States can't make the whole thing a bomb.
They must have used it and I've put them aesthetically done.
It made my somebody's now.
I ain't got none on me.
Plus it.
No.
I won't get the fidget without any prejudice.
I'd be busted.
Just because I kicked on chicken is better.
I'd be busted.
I'd be slimy guilty and I'd be so pissed.
When I got out of bed I'd be in a sack with my son.
I'd be in a closet.
I'd be in a closet.
I'd be in a closet.
I'd be in a closet.
I'd be in a closet.
1032-552-2.
Let me ask you one thing.
Anybody have a heart or a liver?
Well, we got us a celebrity studded the cash call today.
Jennifer Ram.
Happy anniversary.
Thank you, Jennifer.
23 years.
I know.
It's pathetic.
Isn't it 23 years to still be here?
You deserve a medal.
Yes, I do.
I don't have one for you but I do have a little story for you.
Yeah.
I was heading home headed northbound I-95 near the Hallendale Beach Boulevard
eggs that yesterday after the last 30.
Oh, I'm pretty sure that.
Yeah.
And there was a guy in a Honda Civic dark in color, spanking the monkey.
Welcome to chicken.
He was choking it.
All right.
But I'm the corn.
Uh-huh.
And today we're doing a story about the dangers of road debris and what not on I-95.
Hitting your vehicle that's...
Oh, my, now I know where that slick spot was on the road yesterday coming home from the airport.
Exactly.
My question to you is how dangerous is it to do that while you're driving?
Yeah.
I guess it all depends on how many hands it takes to a handle a lot for.
Well, for that guy, he had a grip but he really needs to get alive.
That's great.
So happy anniversary.
How do you like Henry Burrows' call, by the way?
All right.
You know what?
I was out doing an interview.
He didn't hear it.
Was he sober?
Yeah.
He was, he said...
And then he said...
And I said, well, Henry, how's Henry doing?
He said...
He was great.
He's doing okay.
Something's never changed.
Nice to see all our old, you know, Rocky.
Yeah, him too.
Keeping our heads above water.
Well, happy anniversary.
Love you.
Thank you.
Take care.
See ya.
Bye-bye.
Jennifer Ram.
Everybody loves Jennifer, right?
Everybody except the...
What's your name?
Jackie.
Jackie Bales.
Was that her name?
I got confused because we had like two Jackie's.
We had the real like macho Jackie.
What was her name?
They're having a...
You know, this place really amuses the hell out of me.
They're having a neo-Rigis anniversary party in the parking lot out here in Noon.
Am I going to be involved in that?
No.
Because I'm sitting up here on the air.
Oh, look, here Sam's got the balloons.
And that's right.
Yes, I did think about you and I'm saying Sam, but I still came back.
Like I said, look at all those beautiful purple balloons just like Tinky's winky.
Well, I guess what I saw on the BBC a couple of mornings, I saw Tinky winky.
And the whole, whatever that stupid show is, the telecom beauty.
Oh, yeah.
And of course, you know those British are all about your presses anyway.
So how can you tell?
Purple balloons, boy, this is pretty impressive.
Am I impressed?
No.
Here's a mobile and Cooper city.
Hello.
Happy birthday.
We have a handwritten.
You think our dimer you're dimer.
Are we paying for this?
No, of course you are.
Okay, hang on.
Well, no, we want to take the celebrities first.
I mean, here's an almost celebrity.
Hey, boy, what's that in your mouth?
Brian Andrews.
Happy anniversary, Neil.
From Channel 7.
The one and only.
From Channel 7 news.
How are you, Neil?
The one that says, we're out of that material, folks.
Not anymore.
How's things?
Things are great.
I just heard it was your 23rd anniversary.
And...
Well, where did you hear that?
I heard it on your show.
Oh.
This backyard, I was putting around to it a few things.
I could get out.
It's Neil's anniversary.
I should give him a call.
Right.
So, 23 years?
23 years of being...
And some of those...
Part of that time has been your colleague on IOD.
Yeah, you know, I was...
Everyone was there.
You won my wife and your colleague on IOD.
Right.
That was a long time ago.
Uh-huh.
But I just heard Jennifer Ram.
Wow.
Blast from the past.
Right.
And Henry Buron.
What do you never worked with Henry, did you?
No, I wasn't around for his.
Yeah, he was drying out, I think, when you came over.
So, how was being overseas?
Overseas was great.
Amsterdam is still there and it's fantastic.
And even with crappy weather and very marginal food,
I still had a great time.
And it's just nice to be among, you know,
living and breathing people for a few days.
And they're letting people down here.
No, not really.
Well, a few.
Anyhow, I just, you know, you're...
They say in South Florida, we need a circle.
You're not a man until you've been ripped on the year by Neil Rogers.
And Neil, I know you've ripped me many a time.
We're not talking about women.
And congratulations on 23 years in this market.
Thanks, Brian.
Give them a...
Where's Sanchez a big kiss?
Yeah, I hear you runs like a mother.
Okay, take care of yourself.
I'm Brian Andrews from Channel 7.
Are we impressed with that?
No.
He's all right.
He's a little confused.
That's what Adam said.
Here's a mobile and Cooper city.
Hello.
God, you preempted me for him?
Well, he's, you know, we're trying to get him out of the way, you know.
I'm half the anniversary.
Neil 23 down and four to go.
I'm wired.
And Neil, nobody's sense cards anymore.
I don't even get my wife in anniversary card anymore.
I just...
You know, an anniversary.
Listen, why should I expect the audience to remember this one?
I forgot myself.
Why should I expect anybody else to remember it?
Well, I'll come over and give you a big kiss, Neil.
Not pass.
And the best part of the anniversary shows all the celebrities of Colin Joey Reynolds and Mr. Ego and Alice and Rob Daniels.
Right.
And Randy Rhodes and the King Meister.
Neil.
Don't leave me.
Are you going to hear?
Are we going to hear from the phone?
I hope not.
I love that.
Somebody told me that Capri is back in town, by the way.
That's the rumor that I heard that he's working on RMS.
I have heard him, but he'll be Colin.
We'll find out.
Neil.
And in closing, you had your 20th anniversary show, I guess, three years ago.
Remember when Larry King called it from the airplane?
Yes, I do.
I got it.
Yes, I do.
I'm going to play it.
Thank you, sir.
Happy anniversary.
We love you.
Thank you so much.
How come we haven't heard from J.E. and Pompato Beach at this morning?
We're waiting for that call.
I know he's listening out there waiting with David Brett.
We have an open line and date one and Broward.
56705.
60.560 on the mobile one line.
How about you, every guy that made your personality in town?
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom Jicke calls in today, who missed the last book again,
by the way, the last ratings book, which we had a monster book.
He missed that again.
Missed our center one fundraiser that we did over 150 grand.
Missed that.
Missed my 23rd anniversary in the newspaper, by the way.
But I'd like to my good friend, Tom Jicke calls in here today.
Just because he's such a good guy, even though Sam is standing in front of my clock.
It's not important.
I mean, they don't care about the time.
They just want to know the guy named Gordon is the bookie, you're feeling better today.
I wanted to give you the real thing here, Neil.
Sally fits when her battery's quick, rick and suds
When they're pulling their cuts, Joe blows.
That most everyone knows.
That's just great, baby Joe.
Larry King, with that ball spot thing and there's Jim.
We know what Neil thinks of him, and Randby Roll.
When she speaks of her dolls.
That's just great, baby Joe.
Management, they're all bent on just running the show.
But they're just a bag of rants and two spags I know.
They don't even know as a ghost.
So, and he'll get the attention.
It's just what we're wishing for and so.
As we all hear a soul, paint a call.
And if you have the call, hot, so kneel.
And I'm sure you will feel and you're the guy.
I'll break tripping wild, just made way.
We're bringing on.
10.45 at 5.60 WQ and this overhead just cut it.
Anyway, there's a stupid article as usual, Michael Russo this morning.
I see the Panthers had like three big games while I was gone.
Phoenix, Philadelphia.
And then Ty and Detroit coming from way down on the third period.
Then they ran into the Leafs and Toronto Saturday night.
Anyway, so I missed a couple of very important and big home games.
But I did ask around.
Did they fix that the goalites at the arena yet can people see those yet?
No.
And not only that, but then come to find out the time clocks were back to that again.
They're not working again, right?
But hey, they're working on it.
But there's another idiotic column by Michael Russo.
And it's been interesting that somebody faxes me a copy from the Palm Beach.
See, this is the way it works in the local papers because nobody knows what they're writing about.
Just like that guy affects me, that thing I read in the beginning of the show this morning.
Your right, sir, they don't know what they're talking about.
All they do is they plant their propaganda and use the so-called columnist or writers or stringers or whatever they are like.
My fat Michael Russo, they put in there whatever the hell they tell them to put in.
The kitty core, GM Murray took his lumps for switching to youth seems he was right all along.
This coming on the day that the Panthers are like a ninth place.
They're tied with Boston and points, but they're at the moment out of a playoff spot.
But Murray was right all along.
Like when Marty Stracker got his 29th goal from Pittsburgh yesterday, we were saying, oh yeah, he was right all along.
And then he goes on about the core of youth and he goes, this is the same Michael Russo yesterday that ripped the crap out of Robbie Niedermaren as listless performance game after game after game.
And who does he list there in the kitty core, these great young players, Robbie Niedermaren, how do you like that?
And Roddoch DeVorek with his big deal 10 goals.
And Victor Kauslov, a bitter underachiever and Ray Whitney, who was a great acquisition by Brian Murray, but it's not part of the kitty core as a young veteran and it didn't come up through the organization.
So what are you writing about Michael Russo, you asshole? Another piece of crap. Welcome back to Miami, sir. Thank you.
Too many know nothings in this town. Too many losers. Too many people that haven't got any idea what the hell their job description is that no one know the subject matter of what the hell that they're supposed to be doing.
Like Michael Russo and David G. I spars over there at the herald. Don't say that. Look what happened to the grease man up there.
So anyway, getting back to this thing about Amsterdam, even when the weather is crappy. Oh, and by the way, somebody one of the Julio's and I think it was a chronic before I went on vacation was asking me about the Winston hotel, but there is such a place.
It's on the Rudi Vaseline, the Volmars to the right in the middle of all the red light district in Amsterdam.
But it's a great location, but it's for Schleppers. In other words, if you want to spend like, you know, 70 bucks a night for a flea bag dump dumpy place, but you we don't care because it's just a bed and maybe a little bit of water in there somewhere.
That's fine for you for your Schleppers. Great location. Would I stay there? Not on your life.
Not under any circumstances, but getting back to the said they only one thing. I mean, the bad weather I can take.
I mean, it's the middle of February. I'm there. It's raining. It's cool. It's windy. It's blustery out of out of the nine days.
I would say there were three days when you saw some sunshine. The best day was yesterday when I'm getting on a plane to leave beautiful, but that's the breaks.
I can handle all of the other. I can handle the fact that they eat a lot of fish and stuff that I can't stand and their food generally sucks. I doesn't bother me in the least bit.
So what I cannot handle the one thing that bugs me more about that city than anything else and I love Amsterdam is that as you're walking the streets and you're zipping around town and you go in here and there.
I know that this I've said this before, but it happens to be true. Maybe you can explain to me why there is this phenomenon.
Why the islands people is do any of them they have it like a real job. I don't think so.
Coke. Hey, coke. Coke. That's what we brought all of your makings in here for quite a lot. So we'd have a lot of good weed. Everybody knows that.
Yeah, that's why they're here. But these islands people like from the Dutch Netherlands and tillies or all these other grotesque islands that they I guess they have to let them in there.
And they're an impediment to your experience there not that they're dangerous. I don't think I mean you know they don't like come and grab you by the arm, but they're just a hey, what do you need mine? Coke.
Whatever you want.
Which is not legal there and number two which I don't want to be you know every two blocks or cost it to be buying cocaine and crack in the whatever else.
You know it gets on your guy damn nurse and it also contributes to that kind of attitude that you have that makes you feel a little bit on that racist side.
Like how come were there was there one single white person trying to pedal drustiny while I was an I'm stood and I'm walking this rate. No.
So maybe like that one person said a few weeks ago it's a cultural thing. Maybe that's what it's all about.
Uh-huh. Part of the culture. Open line a day two and Broward look at this open lines here today boys and girls.
23 years on the year in his town the facts machine ought to be buzzing these phones ought to be smoking off the hook we're hearing from big time celebrities Henry Barrow Jennifer Rem.
Broward what's his name Brian Andrews. He's almost a celebrity. That was yeah. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line.
Oh look what we got here it's enough of the sucking guy. Hey how's it going Neil. Great. Happy anniversary man. Thank you so much man.
And I'm talking I tell you what the man this was talking about yesterday.
But you've been you've been your anniversary really all you yeah. That's that's one of the reasons why I call you.
I mean the guy that's doing the updates the first updates on Sunday's day they were all celebrating you.
I guess you're anniversary I guess I call it it wouldn't be complete if Phil Henry doesn't call you in though. You know we missed a Henry here.
Are you shooting yeah from 6 o'clock in the morning till 10.
That sounds good to me it sounds like a big improvement over that crappy.
How about that punk in the morning talking to you know.
Yeah he just gets on my nerves.
If you guys have enough doubt if you guys have the tolerance to you guys have the balls to have a guy like that talking on the radio in the morning.
What can you have wet back radio from 6 o'clock in the morning.
Yeah I think that starts next week.
Well you don't come in.
I think we're gonna give Ricky Martin's gonna get a show we see he won the he won the he won the he was all excited about.
He's got a lot of people but he love he then.
Yeah and he brought me a crowd of their feet and they were screaming boy look at that orange hair Ricky's got there was screaming and squealing over it.
I really have the time to call you when I'm wearing like height lower pants.
It was so tight that you could see that he definitely is circumcised which I thought was pretty amazing for a Puerto Rican.
Yeah more more single size more than one.
Yeah he must have had the good moral he did a beautiful job.
I mean go yes.
So getting a round I'm out of being the one that she was driving next to you know.
Yeah.
Yeah so I don't know how far she doesn't share her eyesight isn't that good.
Okay I have a great time you go.
I'll be right back.
Good on you.
Okay we have an open line of days.
So anyway getting back to the thing about Phil Henry.
There's this obnoxious magazine that I told you about over the years called talkers magazine which was founded by and is written for and about a group of self serving assholes.
As Brian Andrews would say colleagues in the business.
Mike Siegel who used to work on WS News maybe some of you old friends remember Mike Siegel were trying to forget a humorless pathetic excuse for a broadcaster for a human being one of the most anxious people I've ever worked with.
But it ended of course Walter Sable contributes weekly or however monthly however often they put this rag out and they have these conferences that they go to and they also give awards to each other.
It's a self serving group of a flock is what it is.
Whether just the you know squeeze each other's genitals and pat each other on the back and tell each other how wonderful they are like they used to do with packs and giving each other all the awards all the time.
For screwing up an other station and destroying somebody else's life.
So anyway this February issue which so where did we get this who brought this in.
Greg or Duffer what all the general manager WQA mom she must have thought I'd be really impressed by seeing that.
Yeah my name in here the top hundred talk host in America for 1990 on is selected by the anxious talkers magazine a grotesque piece of turd.
Now I'm not going to waste your time actually I'm in there I mean to tell you know when you make the top five thousand that's pretty good.
Neil Rogers huge in South Florida offbeat wild character afternoons which are afternoons.
WQM Hollywood with the address and the phone number the fact and right on the dress wrong phone number right under my picture by the way guess who the next one is Jim Rome.
Now if you remember that fact that I started reading about you know shock radio it's a sports radio shock shock knows his stuff from your radio network yadi audio and there's his ugly place with that mustache trying to be controversial just with that look on his post.
But anyway when you hear some of the people that made this list and the one in particular who did not you are going to take your radio and plan your first to you're going to go and find out who published this guy damn talkers you're going to take your water say blow up that and just blow up the screen.
That's what they call the blow up doll because he blows on this list of the hundred best talk show host and by the way let me give you the criteria that they listed here okay.
They go through this long article which I never read this thing except of course I'm in it so I'm assuming you know I'm in I'm embarrassed to be in by the way I want to retract I don't want to be associated with most of what's in here.
The idea of importance these are the hundred most important talkers in America it's determined by any combination the following aspects of the candidates professional status ratings ratings.
Long Jebadi uniqueness as in a Randy Rhodes wannabe potential social impact yada yada industry recognition the courage talent and here is he's in their group Daniels she's a natural with a style all her own.
Yeah w i and g after the drive I'm going to tell you this is the worst Randy Rhodes ripoff in a day and why would you want to rip off Randy Rhodes that's the thing I don't understand that with all the respect to Randy okay she's got her thing.
Yeah where it is.
But I mean work Daniels is on the list now since this you know he mentioned and somebody else already has mentioned a certain name okay yeah that one.
So I'm looking through this this morning with much consternation is I'm seeing like Mike Seagal is in it all the people are part of this cluster fork that are you know that put this magazine out for their own a grandizement their own ego like time don't like his he's in there with his municipal numbers in every market that he's in by the way.
And I'm looking through here and I'm seeing various people are not in here like I see Mike in the mad dog from the fan this is a got sports talk people in and Jim Rome is Hank in here Hank no he's not in here.
A glaring omission is work are working suds in here well he suds is he in here no.
And then I talk to myself well you know who might leave it out and I look for Phil Henry I want you to those of you who know anything about talk radio in this market or just in general just generally speaking anything about talent like you recognize it if it hits you in the face.
Is Phil Henry on his list no keep in mind here's work Daniels is on the list at talkers magazine okay even she can't believe it because of her rating for influence for longevity in the market.
She got came back to the first month and then she was changing tires and tires and people who have got a best you want to come back to work.
She makes the list of the most important 100 talkers in America Phil Henry who's in Los Angeles on KFI 50,000 watts was one of the great talent in the history of our business.
Does he make the list no.
Damn it.
And you wonder why I say this is a horse ball business with a bunch of assholes and stuff of grandizing ass suckers right on it.
I'm going to tell you they ought to take Walter stable I told your just this morning tie him to a goddamn tree and make him wipe his ass with a real sharp willow pad and 500 copies of talkers magazine until he can't wipe it no more.
Shame on you you idiot you you jackasses.
But I do like that jacket time time like this Neil God.
I want to do.
I'm going to be.
I've got the power to hold.
I have a way to get your own show.
I'm on the stage.
I'm on the.
That's why I'm a consultant.
Oh my god. The idea of Brooke Daniels being on the list and the Phil Henry not being on there just it frosts my ass so much that I'm ready just to get up and walk out of here and go open up a goddamn shoe shine stand on the corner of the dam rack and something.
Speaking of the dam rack here's a man who you know makes it on his living.
Oh he didn't respond because I said it's a man who.
Al.
Put the food down now.
Happy anniversary.
I can hear I can hear the rappers crinkly.
I want to know if I'm talking to hear the hip hop was going to be a background Neil I'm going to be an answer to March 10th March 18th is anyone here to smoke it all up.
It's all gone.
I cleaned about you did what about the herring did you know the herring you know I had fact I cleaned your apartment.
I did not go in your part.
Why didn't you just because you gave me can't use a key stop it.
Yeah.
I was going to pay for a hotel too much.
I know my favorite hotel of Barbizon Palace was booked up this time so I had to stay at the Crasnipolsky and where that is.
You were six blocks from my house how much of you spend.
Too much.
You could have saved all the money all you have to do is perform moral effects of me and where even.
Like I said I love the Crasnipolts.
They have great dinners by the way.
Do they?
Oh it's a wonderful dining room.
Yeah.
You are eight blocks from my apartment Neil.
I know exactly where you're apartment.
I am going to walk in the back door.
I can say that it's a Crasnipolts.
I want to be the lunch and I love how.
Maybe you can answer me what it is.
Because I am always here and you make these comments or anybody else in the way we are supposed to be racist.
But you know what I am talking about.
You spend enough time there.
You walk the streets.
Everybody is happy.
Everybody is in a great mood.
The people are friendly.
They are very nice.
There is no guns.
There is a cops don't have any guns.
But every couple of blocks there is some raster schwarz standing out there.
You are a little irritating.
You are finally one to yourself.
People are always saying they have been deprived of an education.
Maybe a good haircut would be a good start.
They are working all the streets.
They should go back to Holland where they belong.
But Neil why don't you come from Holland?
Neil you said you wanted to live in Holland.
If I land in the apartment for you, why have you been cold?

Wow!
I don't know what I a Dutch I was coming back on a plane yesterday and Martin here with a very nice
Gentlemen, in fact, maybe he's even listening now, but I doubted he's doing business and
older Dutch gentleman who's like in the telephone business
cell phone and
He showed me at a Dutch paper showing me a review of a restaurant called the Jan Yang which is right near where one of the hotels
I stayed most of the time and it'll the restaurants in Amsterdam to be honest with you got to be a little bit adventurous to go in because on the outside they look like
Not too much even the good ones. Okay, so we picked up the Dutch newspaper. We're showing me this review and I look at it and like
forget it
There are few now like finish ever hear the finish speak. It's like it's like
Indian like it like they speak in a Cala would like so one of those strange Indian languages no chance that one I would not tackle
I know my 40 awards of a tadon. I know my 20 words of esponule every where I go try to learn a little bit of language
But Dutch to me. I mean it's a you just have to make a lot of good. What I guess is what you get for reading all that herring
And all those clams
A lot of clams being eaten in Amsterdam. I'm on guarantee of that
Here is a candle. Hello
How's it going Neil great? I heard you talking about David Janiel and all those riders about hockey earlier
I called you a couple weeks ago about Alexander Dayg
Have they said they were trying to get him for Philly and he wasn't with Philly anymore. You remember right?
Anyways, in today's paper have you read that David Janiel singing in about the Panthers in the least possibly meeting in the playoffs? Yeah
He goes on to the Panthers likely playoffs. But would be number seven or eight
They have more of a chance of getting three than seven. Yeah, I mean there's six points at a third and Buffalo has the seventh spot and
There are eight points up on us. I
Mean what is it with this guy that does he look he has no idea what he's writing about?
He really does how many sparts as you know they know anything about hockey?
I mean he really doesn't we go on to say it every time and you know people think oh
Well, it's just one mess up to but but but this fat Michael Russo which you read the hurl I guess
But in the Sunsendle just I come back yesterday. I'm reading to catch up on things
He writes this scathing. He finally writes something true about Robbie Needham are what a bust
He's been and out today. He's writing about how he's one of the great talent because this is the PR stuff that the organization is put out again
It's pathetic. It is. I mean how can you he doesn't even mention the fact that we
Have a chance to get the third spot. Yeah, I mean let's worry about the eighth spot first. Don't worry about the third spot
Right. Well, I mean, you know
Big game excited against that Caroline. Yes, sir and when's the night? We got the old fairy coming here with a Colorado
That's right another thing I wanted to tell you that talking about people that don't know anything whoever's operating
I know the clock that probably you haven't been there to see it. Yeah, but whoever operates
What it's put on the scoreboard as far as the graphics right there just getting paid money
They don't know have a clue what they're doing the starring line of a Philadelphia
When they put Eric Lindross's picture out there. Yeah, and they put his name underneath they spell it L.I.N.D. R.O.F.
S. I mean a superstar like Lindross. I mean yeah, he's been a Luther Vandross. That's
That's true. I have a right day pal. I had a run. Yeah
Got a run because we got another superstar Ed Kaplan my close personal friend has got the odds at a night's game
That's right. Somebody told me that the England Bergman was Gary Bergman's sister. That's true
Congratulations. I think it's the same person. I think it's Gary
Batman
Great thanks Ed
Bringing all kinds of stuff here. They're having a big the one thing about this place if I get great ratings
They have a ratings party for the whole station if I have an anniversary they have an anniversary party for the whole station
I think it's a real banana that I came over here for everybody else. Yeah, a lot of us have ratings bonuses
built on how the station does right?
I probably know you thousands excellent. I might have bad streak right now at those streams
So maybe a while. Yeah, but when they bring the good bands in though
Did see Dave Joseph's column yesterday, you know, he's a right on target man
These old old bands that even you and I have forgotten already. I mean that's just ain't gonna cut it
You probably probably record and count them to do hey by the way since you were one of the few people who would even understand what this is all about
I look at a paper yesterday and I wish to hell I would have been here although thank God I was on vacation
Saturday night that big 150,000 dollar racers pop it all
149 and four Parsons then the track record in in the end of February
Can you believe it must have been a mild night, but that's what a time that is
Yeah, I
Except the only thing is I think that not just in heart is racing all these sports
And I mean all the racing sport they just keep scooping up the tracks. Yeah, I don't know if these
You think this was it's faster than naya trance. You think they're scooping up the tracks are scooping up the horse as well
We don't want to touch that we don't want to touch that with the tempo. Well, thanks a lot and I appreciate it
I'm happy I have a verse me and the
People don't realize this but actually between our own mutual friend Peter Shapiro and then you can build harder
I thought he never would have made it back in my life
Like I said we got a bad connection in
Later, but like poor ed well. He had a rough weekend
You know, we have an open line and Broward to and day to bring in baskets
Look at that one I like that one with a big Jewish down the outside that basket
What is that thing in sports where there's this tremendous feeling touchy?
These people don't want to think about it. They're gonna become very known

You know a bit dirty or something
That's the best. Well are you familiar with that? Yam Yam? I heard of it. Which doesn't which is an Italian restaurant

The zinger kind of like spicy very very light breadings and after we're about too many carbs
Would like some kind of a special uh, squirt squirt sauce. Yeah, I think I know where it came from and not too bad
Not an award winner, but certainly better than eating all those goddamn McDonald's double cheese burgers with no buns
I don't care what the lady said. She was very nice, but the food there
Close it's a bit
But hey when you're having such a good time who's got that time to eat?

That was Paul Harvey Jr. Just blew up right here on the
Here I think you did that. I know you're not touching it but even so now I hear that when he calls you do touch it
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT call us back Paul Harvey Jr. or not as the case may be
He said a lot of problems in his life, you know here's West Palm Beach hello
Hey Neil. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Happy anniversary, man. Thank you so much, man. I'm a little in the U since 1976. Oh my god. Yeah, well 23 products
Um, I just want to say I would say this for all your listeners. I am at third generation
Floridian
Warner raised my grandfather came to my mama in 1911
My mama worked for Flagler and he he he went down on he would work for the railroad and he went down during a hurricane at 35
and during the storm at 35 to the keys to pick up the the World War One veterans that were
Working down there and he never made it back the train was found 100 yards away from the
Tracks and even the sawgrass wasn't disturbed. Oh my god and
And as a kid growing up in my mama and Kendall we lived at
68 51 Southwest 94 Street we used to go out and get our own Christmas trees in
1958 this before the Cubans came and the only Cubans we knew were were they were gardeners. Yeah, that's all there were with gardeners
Well, they know how to do that. I remember the first a good seeds across from
34 of a cube. Yeah, there was a there was the first burger king that ever went up
It was in 1958 my dad bought stock in it. Thank God
and he
And went on and on but the thing is
The big Mac was 35 cents. Yeah, and there was no there was no dry through
You just walked in and they were all yeah, they were all white. Yeah
And Neil
Well, you know white people here no more sir
This is it no more white for french fries with pen cents. Yeah, and
You can't turn the clock back, but you got to get you can't you got to go over the old hip hop you got to hop right on right and
I'll tell you I miss my Emma. I'm up in West Palm Beach. I'm a butler and
And for a family it treat oh wait, right? This isn't this isn't the crazy butler that calls us every now and then yeah, okay
We have an open line of date five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the
He was actually on I mean he was terminal, but he was almost the coherent there for the two or three minutes
Seems like what only an hour he was on
Must have only been a second drink
This is your ball and the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs. They don't come any better than Neil Roger
I've been listening to him for
I show five to six years and
I've watched the morning show evolve and everything and um
I have a problem when taking my kids to school and
thinking commercial for
For the guy that curses
nasty nasty things and there's no warning it just splurts out, you know
You
And you can hear the bleep you can hear the
You know and you can hear the venom in his voice and and you know
I don't have a chance to turn off my radio quick enough now. I heard it
You know I had a problem again the other day. I can't explain that stuff to my kids
I've been listening to this station for a long time and I think you're ruining it by
infiltrating it with his nasty language and
I don't know what I can do but I just thought I'd better call you know and tell you it's different when Hank
Hank calls someone in son of a bitch. He just heard the guy act like a son of a bitch. Hey stop it
There's a reason for it, but the other guy with his fart and his
Fall and just the way he curses is ruining their first pain and
I think Joe Rose should stand up and
And get this all pick off his program because there's a lot of people like me that
That are you know have children and and I just feel like you're someone say pissed off on my way to work
Pissed off gets me fired up when I hear someone say that and I don't think it's appropriate
I know if you're gonna have to nasty little program in the middle of your day leave it there to make the other program
If you mean toss in it and it really insults my intelligence there and you know that's not clear
I don't know what is okay. Thank you. It's love and 45 but 5.50 QM so by the way next door

But if Howard does something right away because he's one of those, you know one of those media maggot magnets
And like I told you the last couple of months life has got nothing to do with talent
It's got nothing to do with anything. It's got to do with one word H-Y-P-E baby height that is 99% height and 1% ability. That's what it's all about
Speaking of that

Hello, yes ma'am hi. How are you Neil?
Great. Thank you. Long time caller for a time. Long time. Let's the first time caller. Can't even talk I'm so nervous
I want to tell you that George did a very tough job while you're away. A very what?
Sucky job. Oh sucky job. He's talking about sat chicks which I am not yeah, but I don't want to hear about him
Talking about fix you the whole day talking about them. Do not now did he get calls from spits?
You guys you
Taste one to get call I can't get no calls from spicks
They're listening, but they won't speak to me. It takes one to no one you know
So they listen and they talked him he talks about how he's an American spec and he went on and on and on yeah
And it's boring. It's just like too much topic stuff
He's like and his his voice. It's enough. You know what I think it is
It just dawned on me one of the reasons I had such a good time in Amsterdam and spread the crappy weather
I didn't hear one word of esponial and there were no spicks
Ah
We know I wanted to sound exactly what it was it was a nice reprieve
There we and then as soon as I got back to Miami International and walked out of the airport
Well, he thought that was like a topic of the day that and sat people yeah, not that people fat women
Fat women
Yeah, I don't think he dare and talk about the fact
I'm gonna see a he had lots of calls here last week. He these phones were smoking all week long
I don't know before I'm stopped very boring. I'm glad you're back. Okay. Well, thanks for not going to be a good thing
I want to call my husband power hungry
Thanks. Thank you. She loves you George. We have an open line of data. We're talking about all fat people
Not just fat. Don't be defensive. She is giving her opinion. She thinks this shows you did suck
I'm sure they were fine and I'm sure she's fine
There are people listening to my show today. I think this is this show's suck
This show. Well, I said it again. Well, I'm eating now. Okay. I'm not paying that much attention
I'm getting to have a notice
It's my anniversary. I'm having a nice free lunch here
Everybody's putting on this big act. They love me today. Even I've capitol. I never see I never see any of these people
They're right upstairs. So he's here at night. That's his excuse
Never see any of these bastards, but even he made the effort to call in
To recognize a major accomplishment 23 years on a year in his market
Nonstop except for seven of the best months of my life when buddy Bud said hey here you go. Here's some money go away
Please and I said okay
But you know something it's just like this vacation. I just had
Everything is like a dream. You know what I'm saying? It's like a snap of the fingers even at seven months with all my trips all over the place the Vegas in Europe and wherever
Before you know it it just zips right on by and it's gone. It's just like a distant memory
So grab it and squeeze it while you can. Oh, we got all the pains in the ass here today Jeff Moss. Hey, Neil. How are you?
Okay, sir? Thank you so much. I figured I'd get my one call in this year. Yeah, I just want to say George George did a great job last week
I don't know what that bitch was talking about he was great. How are you offended?
I don't know. He does a great every time I call every time I was listening at the end
He said I'd like to give out the phone number but there were no phone lines open
So we listen to him. I knew I said I got one open line right now. It's my anniversary show
It's my goddamn show. He goes on there. It's every line lit up all week long and this bitch calls here and is a bed out of shape
I'm complaining and bed out of shape. I don't know Neil
I just wanted to call and tell you happy 23rd. I think you're great. You make the ease of pain here, Neil
He's the pain. Maybe closing out of a one card for you. Yeah, Mike
Okay, thanks Jeff
Nice phone technique there too. How is that Jeff?
Two open lines today. So the spits were calling you. That's why you had the phones lit up
Holy little sick day sure because I was ripping them
We're gonna be about what you were ripping my friend the spits out there. We need those people man
I've been specifically we need the Cubans badly desperately
Five six do we need the Cuban five six seven oh five sixty and pound five six the uneo tt wireless line
How come we haven't had one dark complexed caller today tell me about the CNS bed
Because now I'm confusing now I'm beginning to understand I'm a little bit slow. I'm beginning to understand why there's this tremendous
resentment
Between black Americans, which I will not use the word African American because there's no such god damn thing
that American black people
Who are like born here and many of the island people and I've been telling you also for years
I don't I know why any of you ever want to go to a vacation in the Bahamas or any islands
Because I know the one time I went to the Bahamas and we drove through Nassau it was all those kind of people that I'm just describing you the
Hundred of them or so that I saw I'm still analyzed nine days all the roster people out there trying to push their drugs on everybody on the streets
I mean if you want to get good drugs you don't have to go to the islands to do that
But how come so in some beginning to understand the tremendous
resentment that exists because if I was like a reasonable
Civilized hardworking black person trying to scrape my way through who had like a reasonable education
Released made an effort and try to get my kids educated
I would resent the stereotypes that are created by the scum that walk out there on the street crockman crock
I mean, and this is garbage
Swill you look at these people and say Jesus Christ and the wonder there's so few barbers in this town
Get you a haircut get something get it get a life
Gok
Here's a mobile in North Miami. Hello
Neil yes, sir happy anniversary. Thank you. I want to thank you for something that you had done for me a couple of years back
Would you have in the call? I was doing the overnight at the light bulb
And someone had called an aspiring port saying I was putting it down and dishing you which wasn't true
Yeah, and you uh promoted the show and I want to thank you for the words people don't realize
That you promote a lot of people that start out me. I promote everybody on here in this time not paranoid
I'm not terrified and I'm not a child like these other people that don't want to mention the callers
I mean, you know more powered everybody. I'm all for the talent the management for that the management can drop dead
But the talent those are the people seriously you know what I'm talking
I had to thank you for that because that was very classy and I appreciate that
Who is this? My name is chef. I was doing a show Jay Allen overnight at the first go around with talk and microobbers
Who's there right? Oh?
Yeah, long ago right and then that was a BS. That was before Steve
Before Steve right then I came into the studio to film the spot you were on a weight loss program
We were doing a spot for health week a TV show and Saturdays
And you were kind enough before I was not show for health week
Well, you were going to drop a top off
I forgot what you were on at the time and you were speaking in as a
Folks person for that and you were very nice to let us set up the cameras and such and then with the happiness going on
I just wanted to thank you for giving me a piece of that and for you know giving
So much joy over the years listening to radio and letting me be a small part of it. Thanks. Yeah
Thank you sir. See you. Bye. Bye. Okay. There's Jeff though who used to be on the light bulb
Whoever he is. I'm either good guy. He at least cared enough to send his very best which most of them do not
Two open lines and brown did we have a call from Steve Kenya today?
By the way, no, they can regulate me on May 20th
Which I'm the only guy that promoted Hesha one and they believe state that he's on 1470 or whatever it is
Did he call in today to say happy 23 years on a year? No
Now he's probably occupied. No, he's probably busy
Got a nice gift here from my good friend norm Ken who's recouping in Broward general by the way is going through a tough time
We're all thinking about norm
Get better soon norm. You know how they are in this joint. Okay
Better not mess around
The minute that they know that you're returning you sick or that there's something
You know that you're a little bit defenseless. I mean today, you know they put on a good act with the bass getting the big party outside
Just wait till tomorrow
Be right back to business as usual here
My back is like a symbol and my nuts are like pearl. I don't even have enough to pack us world
I try to seek with lotion and technology
But if don't get no bigger than a golf fee
There's nothing I can do
I only got a three inch two
You'll be disappointed when we reach my house
Because you won't know for sure if I'm a man or a mouse
You're there no big Mac or like a happy meal
You get more satisfaction from your high heel
You'll swear I would be in a pool
Because I only got a three inch two
Sometimes at night I wonder if they will ever grow
You call that a thing there
I couldn't even push in your shoe
It looks like Mr. Peanut with a chain
It's got capillaries instead of vain
I took a circulation with a pinkish ring
For Halloween I tried to like a buffalo wing
It's in a suction tube
Because I only got a three inch two
Even with a metric rule
I only got a three inch two
Tell them guys
Yes, we got a three inch two
My little baby
You got a three inch two
Coming here, honey
You got a three inch two
It's probably not quality
You got a three inch two
How about I get only five or three inch two blocks
I'm about to put it here I say it to you
Oh, we're gonna enjoy just doing helium
Oh
I don't want more fun
Anniversary cake they got
23 more years of QA amateurs on air
No, no, thanks a lot
23 more days maybe
Okay, we got two open lines in Broward
It's our big 23rd anniversary show
Have we heard from Tom Jikket today yet?
Terry Jackson at the Harold
No, any of our me
How about Ellie Brecker?
We heard from Ellie yet?
No
Huh?
See there's no there's nothing in this town as an event
To give you an idea
I just looked out in the parking lot
Because this hour is the free food
And we had one old couple standing out there
A sucking up free food
He's not gonna put that cake there is he
Yes
Are you starting to know it's in again
Just because you did a few shows here
And all of them you got great review
We're gonna do a lot more if you did any more of that cake
That's right
So you better say hey that looks just like your size that cake
Welcome up wow
Yeah, that's right
And so are you
I'm gonna say
Thank you, Duff
Here's Kendall
Hello
You know
Yes sir
Happy anniversary
Thank you
I really enjoyed looking
What a factification in here on the inside
Audience they're still in the coma
I don't know what that woman was talking about
George was fantastic last week
Yeah but don't you know if everybody called it and sucked ass
Wouldn't that be pretty boring
There's nothing worse than being boring
I enjoy when people call and rip the hell out of me
Rip the crap out of George
That's what makes it fun
Even if they're just making it up
Absolutely
Absolutely
I mean there's nothing worse than a boring suck fest
Well listen
Mandage was absolutely just talking you up yesterday
Really
It was fantastic
Always love Mandage
There's a real talent for it right there
There's a real genuine guy
At least every half hour
Every hour on the hour
He was like in the Tomarth Neil 23
Are you sure?
And on and on
Yeah
Wow
It was great
I really enjoyed listening to the yesterday
It was great
I'm sure he's gonna call you
But listen
How do we get there to see you
I don't know where you are
How do you get where
I don't know I want to come up and join the party
You don't come up here
Where are you
Huh
No in the parking lot
In the parking lot
We're on 441
Like about a half a mile north of Ives-Derry Road
It's 2-0 second trail
Is the street
Right right by Giffey-Lube
And there's the tire kingdom
And there's a stop right there
And we're in a big white building
You might see the whole deal out there
You'll see the QM van
And the balloons and the dumsand
I mean the sand of the shamb
Thanks for everything Neil
Okay thank you sir
Have a great day
Yeah they want some free food
They want to spend for some prizes out there
Let's get some activity going out here for Christ's
Let me go take a look
Nothing going on out here
You got to stress some of the free food
There's nobody on here
Hey this is party time in Miami baby
What a dead goddamn place
If it was me
Well not me
Because I can afford my own goddamn meals
And I can get free food at the pizza lot
But I'm saying if I'm the average listener
or schlepper out there
I'd be taking off from work saying
Hey I'll see you later
Baby I'm going to the track
I'm going somewhere
I'd be a high-tail under right over here
for the free food down there
Is what I would be doing
Right in the parking lot
Maybe I'll just take them while
Maybe there's a little on the slow side
Just a little slow
Here's a lady in Miami Beach
Hello
Lady in Miami
Like I said maybe they're a little slow
Hello
Yeah Neil
I want to congratulate the stations for having you
And I'm not sucking ass
You're a comic genius
You really are
So
And George did great
But you are one of a kind
And you just tell things as they are
This city is gone
There are more on
Just the brain damage
And uh-huh
And I would
I told
I was telling George's story
But the fire alarm went off
Yeah
All right I was in the
Quarter part
Third quarter of the bus
And the bus driving
I was going to leave gentlemen
Was playing Monica's vagina
And you could hear these words
So precisely
Yeah
And no one
I'm in the first third
They didn't hear it
It was
I'm not
My hearing isn't that great
And um
The bus driver was playing with Monica's vagina
Well he was playing it
And then I went up
And I said they're not
They don't hear it
I mean they hear it
And they're not
In Toronto
I think it's a
Land of the dead
And you
You're alive
And the land of the dead

In the parking lot
Sucking up to your free food out there
But let's get some action out there
Let's show Jeff Cohen
And it was worthwhile
He went through an elaborate song
And a dance to set up all that
Free good stuff out there
Didn't he?
No
Well he said he did
Beware of exploding balls
Two tables of food just salmon

A facet doe

The oil is still dying
You better get back in the kitchen.
Cause I got a sneaking suspicion.
Oh man baby.
Baby, you just burned my bow.
My father's on fire.
I'm not stupid.
The father's burning.
Give it to the father.
Push the water over.
The father's burning.
Give it to the father.
The father's on fire.
Give it to the father.
Oh my God.
Let's talk this ball.
Put him in my desk.
Tell my baby.
Let's talk this ball.

Let's talk this ball.
Come on baby.
Let's talk this ball.
Well, well, well.
Come on baby.
You know it just told me, how the hell would they...
You're welcome.
We're managing, remember, that it was my anniversary.
We've been telling you about that.
What is it?
It's Duffa Stone, everybody.
Oh, Duffa Stone, everybody.
He was around sucking around.
Or at least part of that.
We have an open-line at Broward, 5667-0560,
pound-560, animal-1.
Didn't hear from Jeldie today, saying happy anniversary.
Huh?
Did we hear from Jeldie?
No.
Duffo?
No.
He said it on the earth.
Who did?
Duffo.
Well, Duffo mened.
Did Jeldie say it?
No.
Open-line at Broward, 5667-0560, pound-560,
on the mobile one line.
Hank will be along from the Schulter State to today at 2 o'clock.
We got Big Fat Bug Shombie, 6 o'clock tonight.
Big gigantic fat oozing with Cellulite Bug Shombie.
And at 10 o'clock Eddie Kaplan.
And Kaplan called it today.
Which is a nice thing of him to do, especially so early,
before he's getting up time.
I would think on a day when the track is closed.
Here's Bokeh.
Hello.
Hey, happy anniversary, Neil.
Thank you, sir.
I've been listening to you since the days on INZ or Nights on INZ.
Yeah.
And as for George Black, we could do a great job.
I don't care what anyone says.
You did a great job.
And I was curious.
When you go to Amsterdam, what's the price of light there?
Because you were talking about Martin Air and how during Christmas,
you can get those 199 round trips.
And I'm thinking about going around.
199?
Yeah.
I don't think it was like 299 or 399.
No, I called them.
It was, it was 199.
It was 199?
Yeah.
Round trip.
Oh man, you got to go for it.
I'm telling you, Martin Air is like a half a step.
They fly the 767s, which are as comfortable as 747.
But you also have a little bit less legroom,
but they do a really good job.
What's the price of light there?
Like the red light district?
Is it really expensive or?
For what?
Like a blow job?
Well, yeah.
Well, whatever, you know, whatever you want to do.
You're asking me what the prices are in a red light district?
Sure.
Not that much.
No, it's not that much.

it's the word that we give,
that is that we've got a
whole, we've got
big chunks,
not just a chunk,
but we have big big chunk.
In this audience,
in a deliverance time
that take up space in this
time they have nothing.
nothing that contribute.
say, they've got nothing on their
mind, they've got no life.
And there's one of them right there.
As soon as he started with a Howard, the moment he did,
I knew exactly where it was going, in the old crapper.
Here's the lady in heaven, sure.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, ma'am.
First, thanks for this exciting bid I just
heard in my ear.
That was cute.
And I wanted to wish you a very healthy, happy,
23rd anniversary.
Thank you.
And also, I think you might want to know,
I live in Hyland Park, Illinois.
Really?
And there is nobody there, not Hyland Park or Chicago,
that can compare with you.
Even in Cicero, there's nobody like me.
Oh, please.
No, but not even in a home with it.
Yeah.
But nowhere, anywhere around.
And so boring.
So I have to come here for four months every year.
Just to get away and listen to you.
I don't blame you.
And I know.
But since Joe Martin, you turned 100 years old.
Chicago has never been the same again.
You know what?
Have a great day, sweetheart.
Thank you, David.
Don Cabell.
Bye.
Two open lines in date, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5,
60, 0, 5, 60, on the mobile one line.
Is anybody ever going to call and tell us what also
belief means?
And there is such a word, God, then.
I think it's like prego in a padded.
It means like, there you go, like air.
Yeah, OK.
Huh?
And then why did I ask the guy in a plane yesterday
that they have all the things I asked him about housing there
and about all different kinds of things.
And everything under the world, I
discussed with this very interesting guy in the plane.
All of these things.
Except I'll do belief.
And this was a guy who, by the way,
spoke four languages, fluently.
And it's commonplace all over Europe.
I mean, even the Schleppers, three languages, four, five languages,
like they got a brain.
And I understand, by the way, Madonna,
of whom I'm no fan, as you know.
But he got into a big flap while I was gone,
because she opened up her mouth and told the truth.
She said, Europeans happen to be a lot more intelligent
and a lot less uptight.
And back here, they got all bent out of shape.
But I mean, what a concept.
How did she have to go all the tell you a truth about all of these things?
Right.
Well, it was there.
I figured why not use it again.
Huh?
I mean, you know, all of these things.
Yeah.
We got this stuff here.
Let's use it.
He's an asshole.
I did it.
I did it.
Let's use it for four hours.
Huh?
That's what it's all about.
Huh?
How's that party coming by the way, Neil?
How about the thing?
How about the thing?
I'm in the open waters like people on this.
Whoa.
You know, people are starving and Jeff Cohen went to all that effort
to put all that feast together out there.
Of course, the staff will make sure that none of it goes to waste.
You know that, especially Sam.
That's why Sam took a personal interest in being involved
in that big good doing out there.
So we can stuff his fat pace.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
She won't go down but it is up and in.
You never gonna keep the town.
She won't go down.
But it is up again.
You never going to keep it down.
She won't go down but it is up again.
You're now going to keep it down.
She won't go down.
But it is up again.
No nap, I'm gonna keep it down
He tried to what's to drink he tried a bucket drink needed hunter drink to get a rinse again
He tells that that a really nice simple door to he doesn't know what the hell he's already got more
There's no way boy no way boy
She won't go down
He's up again, you never gonna keep it down. She won't go down
I need to stop again. You never gonna keep it down. She won't go down
What is it up again? You never gonna keep it down? She won't go down
But we talk about losing the man. He's talking about school
I look happy window just got a few things in it. But he out there to a free anniversary party bash and
There's like four people wandering around and got one goes how many of more care
Like I said, there's like three people wandering around. I think one of them is same
And that's it they better invite the rest of the building than her
They already been there in fact, mate. You know something probably there were a lot of people came by and oh sorry
It's all gone
Staff already had lunch
The same one I'll guarantee that there are assholes upstairs on the third floor which I could put a period after that
I guarantee that some of those people up there who hate me like poison not to mention any names
Who probably were out there eating a suck it up the free food
Like some of the same people are went to the ratings party that you know the near Rogers rating party that he didn't attend
So I hope you enjoyed it. Okay. I'll be enjoyed it. Have some water with it
Hello
Yes, your Rogers Robin Stephanie
Stefan
Where do those names come from?
Stephanie it's like a double whammy
You still got it
Are you used to got a job are you Stephanie? Yeah, so I'm still plugging away. If you got your lips plugged in there
Yeah
Yeah, we miss you big time
I thought your lips were stuck to Rob's back home
That's what I always used to say right here. Of course he always used to say a lot of things
It's just spiritual person, you know crap crap like that
Which really made it into closet
Yeah, I'll tell you this is a good thing. You know, I leave whammy. I was how you ignored that. Yeah, I'm what are you doing now Rob?

We don't have that the butcher Rob that come in here and make sure that we pay nearly every week
Got all my money out of them up front. Don't get right through the end of May
I'm telling you they're hurting for cash. That's a fact good

They were running PSAs in the middle of other Sunday that programming and I said
Yeah, man, I loved it. Well, I hope you're well at least. I'm doing good. I'm doing good. I'm actually producing for a universal television
Yeah, and that's definitely being treated very well
And so we're whammy. She loves whammy. Everybody that puts out over there gets treated real good out here
Yeah, that's why you're out. You gotta put up for the right people. Mm-hmm. I wasn't willing to
That's why Barry Dillard said you're out. I'm out. I'm out. Okay. Well good luck, guys
Well, thanks. We are okay. Thanks a lot and put you up

Not to mention this place
See let me just tell you I've told you this many many times before no matter what kind of business you're in
But when people show up way way before and especially when they stay way after they're working
Is done
Those are the troublemakers. Those are those are people that are being conscientious

Way over here. Yeah

That was that was so fun you could write a book about that week

I'm gonna tell you when you're an accident and you got to be real look choosy about what meat you put in your mouth
So to speak yes George was fine. Yeah, it's an impossible act to follow what a replace and you're you and there's only ever going to be one you
Yeah, and I know this comes as a great shot, but I look at it this way
Those people who enjoy George when he fills in on the show those people will listen
Those people who don't enjoy it they can find something else to do for those four hours
Just like the people with the tapes. I knew that the tape sucked
We had nothing else to put on because it was a cheap outfit over there
And they never had anybody else to fill in
So we put the crappy tapes on plus it didn't cost anything they liked it. It was different and but the bottom line is
If you don't exactly you've said it a million times to people who call you to aid you
You don't like it. There's something else and again, you're in touch back to follow and replace that's it
I thank you for having you here and I hope you're on the year another 30 years. Thanks for being ahead. Have a great day

Okay, well listen have a great time and they give me a big kiss for us. What does that say?
All he'd record I thought this thing that the printout there is so uh

Excuse me. I know my mother is

Yeah, I don't know why you know that's so mean. I mean she's gonna get very sick lump
Yeah
Well, maybe Cheryl will come over and comfort her and have an invite herself to lunch again someday
Where did Cheryl find this ritual?
She's met some ritual Jew who's gonna
Take her off to New York and she's making millions and millions and millions and then she'll tell that niche
Weenah thing or two when she gets done. How did she find this guy? You you're asking me
Probably like she found her one of her other husbands in a gay bar somewhere really yeah, she leads a very exciting life
She likes to get around

We've got the worst songs in America and we're counting them down
Wreckage toys are showing them
For some unknown reason you're buying them and I'm using them as coasters
First let's review the top three songs on the charts and number three guns and roses are singing sweet child of mine
Well, if I had a child around the house today, I'd have these four words for lead guitar and flash and his chords
Stay the hell away
And
Number two you who says they're eating a ribbon in a perfect world and especially not for you reasons you don't speak proper English
And a number one George Michael sings. He's got a monkey on his back. Well, I would imagine it's getting a little crowded back there
But then again you probably don't mind
And by the way George there are these remarkable shaving instruments called razor
I won and lose that silly
Other songs on the charts the band Johnny H. Jazz with I want to be a hero is moving down on the charts and deservedly so
Apparently Johnny also hate music
I don't think hero status is eminent Johnny so get a real job
And there is a song I like Rod Stewart's newest release forever young and for a moment I thought it was a song about me forever hung

And by the way, that's another thing they can thank me for
Which they won't directly but they can a young hero and tea you can bet your life on it
That if it weren't for the fact that I forced them to build a studio over here all those plans
They've been here at about for two years about being up on the third floor
Well, they be would they be up there now? No, not a china monshanson hill by the way. Yes. The food has been held over
For at least another 15 20 minutes. Yeah, because we haven't laid right let me take a look and see if we got a lay right
So we'll have there
But there's nobody that means that the rest of the staff has that a chance to go down here and hazard it up a little bit

Yeah, I can't believe there's nobody in your parking lot party. There is in one person out there
Everyone who is living there are people serving behind the
tables out there. There is in one eater
Are you are you serious? Yes, I mean if everyone who listened to you and polluting me was down there
I mean there wouldn't be any replace the park. Yeah
Well, we're not in probably you know, I choice part of town for our audience
Well, yeah, you should have it at your house in plantation. I would love to you
Um, you know, I have to tell you that
Of besides enjoying you so much you are so right about I miss in the morning and every time I see him
I think of the dead man in the tier that you say about him and it is so funny
And I also have to say that I can't believe by now
That some snow from up north that works with a big network hasn't come to Florida with his family and he's sitting on the beach
You've turned in the radio channel. He's trying to find something to listen to and he comes upon you
And says this is the guy we've been looking for
Because you should be everywhere. Yeah, my girlfriend and Phoenix listens to Howard keeping things funny
I said Nancy you have no idea what you're missing. She's coming here at the end of the month
I cannot wait from 10 to 2 we are going to be listening to you
I mean these people in other parts of the country don't even have a clue to what it's funny
If they think I miss is funny or Howard is funny
They I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna have no education during award on your penis. I mean just nothing entertaining about him anymore
What is interesting about your son sleeping on your hairy chest? Yeah, brother
Fred and ranch on you got next to yourself. He's so self-graciating with this ranch and who
He's not even interesting
All I do is picture you on there and think why isn't everyone in New York and all these big plates
Seeing the O'Rider's this just kills me. I thought for sure you'd be discovered on whammy
I find you that was the problem. I think that was that was the end of my career was being on whammy
Yeah, that should have been the beginning. That was the kiss of death. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Thanks for the
All right, well you have a wonderful wonderful day and another wonderful year and I'll call you
Probably in one year or maybe before and have a wonderful life
Thank you. See you. Why do you want to know a great movie really funny that I saw
Like about three in the morning on bbc
One of the great things over there is that you could all these four line watch or bbc
That is a four language because they can't speak it
But seriously even on the Dutch channels they have these four language movies that are not dubbed in but they have subtitles
So you can hear the original English and you can enjoy because you understand it
It was a Steve Martin movie with somebody that I cannot stand Charles Grodon
But Charles Grodon was great in this movie because he didn't have to act he played himself
He was a sad sack. There were like two lonely guys who had no
Don't you know the movie I'm talking about the lonely guy who's that it? Well, I had to be it
Yeah, that's old
I saw it on a TV channel at three o'clock in the morning. I didn't say it was like a new movie mister
I had never seen it before wasn't bad. It was it was great
I don't even think I can remember it now only there's one thing in there
They all kept jumping off the Manhattan bridge. There's no such bridges the Manhattan bridge is there
Isn't it the George Washington bridge last time I checked
And I kept racking my brain. What the hell is the goddamn Manhattan bridge where everybody jumps off
They don't jump off a Manhattan bridge. They jump off the goddamn Brooklyn bridge or the George Washington bridge like William Holden in network, right?
Yes
Thank you
Good movie though 10 minutes after one and five sixty QM
All right
And
there
Se пар There sounds real coupon bewilder
Bourdie

And talkers magazine rag you would even wipe somebody else's ass for top bad news
But top 100 the most important 100 talkers in America of which I'm embarrassed that I'm on the list
Brook Daniels makes the cut okay
Brook Daniels is one of the top hundred the most influential the most important talk radio people in America
Still Henry according to this is not are you sure oh well if it says so in talkers magazine you know you know must be a pilot

Here's a mobile in pompano hello
anniversary
Thank you
Congratulations, you spoke about Dr. Bernstein three months of
And that's the name of the book Hank Dr. Bernstein
Delighted solution wait a minute not three months. I'm waiting to see this guy. I go on Wednesday
Do you know what his program is no?
13 hours one on one with a doctor Wednesday Thursday and Friday. Yeah
Looking forward to it. I'll let you know what happens
13 hours with the doctor. I don't even get 13 minutes with the doctor
I'm gonna go on when you're going this week. Yeah, when's the
appointments at noon and you finish up by the one o'clock this guy that book is sensational
I mean, it's not easy to do but he's got it out of a science. Yeah, the guy's good. Yeah, looking forward to it
I'll give you a report. There's a guy's going to see the doctor. Oh
By the way, and you know since you mentioned doctors that thing gone from your no
Better here every day a little bit better a little bit worse
And I do think that maybe it was the Adlet but if anybody tells you that it takes a couple of days for a prescription
Drug to get out of your system
Right out of the room out of the building off of the planet come get out of here takes weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks
Some time. Okay, maybe like a couple of months. I'm thinking
But I've told you this before and I'll tell you again if you can find a doctor even a doctor who's incompetent at least
If I'll spend some time with you at least you'll feel better about it
But finding a doctor in this town is better that gives you more than just the usual lick and a smear and doctor feel good and
Where's my red nose to plug on my patch Adam's though? That's it. That's what you get here. You get nothing a lick and a smear
Speaking of a lick and a smear here's the expurgers rich pacter so there's three bridges that go across
Between Brooklyn and Manhattan you got one bridge Brooklyn bridge the two washed in bridge
Oh George Washington bridge goes to Jersey you Rochester guy you that's right and
Brooklyn bridge Manhattan bridge and the Williamsburg bridge
But a Manhattan bridge is not a famous bridge. Well not Rochester
I guess no and not anywhere. I mean if you said the George Washington bridge to anybody in America that's got an IQ larger than your head
You know they know where it is
Okay, I guess if you said the Manhattan bridge they figured it wouldn't be in Kansas, so they know where that was too
Well, they'd be near the midtown wall. Yeah, there you go. Anyway, happy anniversary
I think it's between the Radysman Park and Cobb Hill no doubt no down near any shophouse right all right
Right near a mama Moorys enough. I give up
Anyway, have a happy and I unlike everyone else. I don't wish you another 30 years play out the contract and
Right exactly. Thanks. Thank you. I'll see you
So there is a Manhattan bridge. Yes, Virginia. There is a Manhattan bridge and yes
There are those of us who are not from New York City and very proud of it by the way

Couple weeks before you went on your vacation you're talking about
Pharmacy problems when you go and get your prescriptions or try to yeah, well, I don't experience going into the bank
As soon as it happened to me, I thought of you and I ran to call but you are on vacation
So here's the story I go over to my
Local bank to make a deposit I
Walk up to the teller and she's standing there the managers over her back and they're kind of giggling having a good time
And I put my deposit flip down on the counter it says 180 and then I put $200 deals on top of it and
She looks up. She looks at me. I'm looking at her and I'm waiting and she says to me
So your deposit flip says 180 and I look down and said yes, that's right. It does say 180 and she's continued staring at me
And I'm wondering what's going on. She wants some changes. That's the idea. She didn't know what to do
I'm saying oh my god
I said to her what is the problem here? She's looking at me. I said man. It says 180 I gave you $200
What is the problem? Oh my god? I mean I couldn't believe it. I was stunned. I didn't know I
Was I was like in shock. I was like is this happening in my dreaming this? Yeah, I mean and this is like a young woman 24 25 years old

You were thinking about your work. You're not that dedicated

In fact the only time I ever did think about this place
It made me very angry and so I immediately forced myself to think about more pleasant things
Like anything
Made me very very angry almost as angry as when I see a name on the board
My god, and you know something I bet you're similar. I have that card, but I don't have any idea where it is
Would you get off that line for Christ's sake so I can put her on?

It was great. Well, it lasted

If I guess well, he said well if you're not going to pretend you've been to a rubah
I'm gonna have a real problem with that. I said well, that's your prerogative
Well, if you're not going to pretend you've been to a rubah then I might have to cancel the travel show
When you sat down when we first met you you said you were gonna cancel all the specialty shows. Yeah
Well, I might cancel it sooner. Oh, I'm scared. I was basing my whole career on this. He's an asshole

Stowed okay, but they haven't shown up yet

Race on Saturday. So you have much I've been keeping track Joe Anderson. I can't I already threw it out

Okay, the famous fat rich everybody and their brothers on here today including some people we never heard of before
Well, they all like jumping out of bedwagon. You know how that is even Jerry Sullivan
Jerry Sullivan's a good guy. The only you see the problem in life is that sometimes your impressions of people are based on events beyond their control
The last time I saw Jerry Sullivan he was standing in the control room at iod on the worst day of my life
The worst show in history. Could you narrow it down a little? No, you weren't that I think this is before your time
You remember Jerry Sullivan do you just from the shallow traffic
No, no, but
In fact one of the reasons is the worst day of my life is because Marvin was working
So that in itself explains a lot
But Jerry Sullivan for whatever reason he decided to go in there and watch my show as I died
I mean a wicked airy crank airy nutcase. I couldn't buy a real call for a thousand dollars for fifty thousand
Don't just one of those days in the big city
But here's the fact Jerry says congratulations on 23 years
I'm sure it doesn't seem like more than 50 to you
It's hard to remember time and software to when you weren't top dog in video
Again, oh again
Again, congratulations from the originator of news cruiser 610
Yeah, that's when Jerry was the PD one day and the next day they kind of demoted him a little bit
He was driving the news cruiser overnight to the four in the morning something like that
That's the business baby. Don't get in it stay out of it
What does that say?
Abe Lincoln. Oh Bob Lincoln. Well, it's the same age. Hey Bob
Hey
It's just time flies when you have a good time. It's like yesterday, but congratulations. Thank you

Now let me ask you something you get all these great deals. You're always faxing me
Which I give you a free plug once in a while to show I haven't lost my sense of humor
But all these great martinair deals to
You name right, but I guess they never do any other no discounts in the star class, huh?
Uh, no
They don't if you go to Brussels on the other one I can get you a deal on city bird
Uh, yeah, on city bird. I know I hear that's a real good airline and they use better planes than martinair
I hear they use like seven forty seven right and they're doing a real nice job. Are they?
Yeah, also I can get you a super deal bumped up to
Business class no problem if you go virgin air and then fly over
To answer them
If you go virgin air they go to to London right yeah, but you would have to go to wherever you would want to go answer them
Be it but I can get you a death leg. I can get you for sure bumped up to
business class right
You know my uh my new partner or huge fans of you excellent. Yeah
So anyway, Neil I just uh, you know, I've been listening to you for at least 18 years and uh, just keep knowing
Billing it the right way if right I was just thinking over the weekend
Maybe it was yesterday coming back on a plane

Thanks a lot bob. Thank you. Take care
