I will go see him there for a few minutes.
When I get my hands on who's crazy room,
I'll stop at his face.
I'll go the restroom smells like roses.
When ever I can feel it smells okay to me.
I don't do it 550 WQM,
but that overhead sure is low today, boys
and girls it's real real low but anyway we'll get you it one way or the other
speaking of doing a little lumber I got another great story most people don't
admit these stories when they happen to them because it only happens to me
okay nobody else will admit this just another little episode in life proving
that there is no god so yesterday morning we're in Toronto I got all kinds of
stuff about the air can the center about the game Saturday night about the
crappy seats that rumor got us oh yeah I'll see he won't be back with don't let
me forget tomorrow to repeat this for his benefit because I want to make sure
he hears it mr. Big Shot mr. Big Shot there five rows below the air
Canada club up there in the red seats yeah right you know something if you
would have told me I needed binoculars I would have taken a pair and some
binoculars too mr. Big Shot what is good for oh they come from so and so with
the team and yada and he's up there by the way we meet the same I'm back it up
now we meet at lunch at the pickle barrel on Saturday which naturally I bought
he gives me the tickets and he says oh well the good news is we can see me from
where you're gonna be sitting in the seats you can see me like I'm not gonna go
there to see the arena and see the hockey game I'm going there to see a
rumor like I can't see him anytime and he's up there waving and gesticulating
and all I mean just putting a lot of handbone but not as bad as Christina Moron by
the way they're seeing them the national anthems and I look up in a press box
and there's a rumor into the spot fan into their right there's Bob
Kohl and Harry Neal doing a game on TV on TVC into their right is Joe Bowen
to the least game on radio into their right I see a booth and I see some
asshole during the national anthem and he's waving like an orchestra he's
carrying on and sweating and putting on a whole big act for a guilty and Randy
Moler it's Christina Moron acting like a real jerk and I thought what a moron
yeah it's what I thought I thought to myself he's an asshole but we already
know that that Christina Moron God you had a seat to believe it so anyway we'll
get back to that in a minute but now yes any morning every Sunday morning they
have a great brunch this is a place next to the Eaton Center Eaton is the big
department store in Toronto like Burdhines and there's a big shopping mall
downtown called the Eaton Center and right next to it is a place called JJ
Mugs which is the very it looks like one of those like Daltz remember Daltz
like kind of a restaurant and during like any other time of the week it's
mediocre at best but Sunday morning they have the best goddamn brunch from
like 10 30 to 3 every Sunday so anytime we're in Toronto on the weekend and
happen to be there on Sunday morning never miss this Sunday brunch now one of
the things I love about it is they have like an omelette bar where the guy
makes you omelette fresh you know to whatever you want on it well one of the
things they do when they make the omelette of course what are they put in the
pan before they make the omelette what I don't hear what you're saying I'm
sorry I'm like a phone oil put oil in the pan right well I'm not thinking to
myself that you know 10 30 on a Sunday morning little oil in the pan might you
know what I'm thinking so we finish eating there and I'm like just before I
finish I make a trip to the immense room up there in in the JJ Mugs because I
thought yeah did my business I thought I did all of my business much to my
this made a find out moments later I did not so we walk out of there and the
walking through the Eaton Center and I said to John I say you know I think I
better go find because I know where the restrooms are downstairs in the food
court so he goes off in the music store and I said I'll be right back because
nature was calling for a repeat performance okay now we're off at one end this
is a big shopping mall by the way we're at one end of it the restrooms you go down
three escalators all the way to the bottom floor and they're way at the other end
on the very bottom floor and I'm moving along thinking no problem I get right
to where the door is right to the door you know what I'm talking about right to
the door and your mind is playing tricks with your body again and like oh no
don't and I take one step and oh no a little little bit of a problem and I
well I'll still make it I take the next step and oh boy well thank God for
boxer shorts baby yeah white boxers shorts no less yeah white boxes oh man so I
fly into there I do my business and of course now I'm also I'm removing my
boxer shorts now this is a busy restroom it's a busy tea room so it's not
like one of those situations where you can go in and like daintily take them
off and like throw them in the trash can almost have the shot camera well that's
what it is right so I had to fold them up kind of like you know and stick them
under behind the base of the toilet you know what I'm saying you know where
there's that one spot it's like a blind spot where the Italians hide the guns
right where the Cuban women hide the old toilet paper oh my god
what another experience I thought to myself God damn it there is no God
what that's it that's the end of that story but wouldn't brief be more efficient
for holding that stuff in no no not at all because briefs tend to be number one
thinner yeah which means that we go through into your pantaloonies you have like a
bad stain in number two oh jeez the thought of that but boxer shorts are more
like there's more different places working catch on briefs are very
skimpy it's like almost like we're in a jockstrap which you can just imagine if
you were wearing a oh jeez what's that on the floor oh boy talk about a crappy
life so that was one of the highlights before the snowstorm by the way that
was that was the first storm okay a couple hours later there was another
storm of a different kind was a real adventure this weekend it's always an
adventure when you get out of here when you're here it's pretty boring you know
but you get on a plane you go someplace else it's always an adventure so I
trying to call my doctor doctor mark which by the way I'll be there an hour
earlier today doctor mark because we got Marlon's baseball at 105 can you believe
that no Marlon to the match in New York Marlon's baseball any interest at all
no any I mean a minimal out of interest no how much of those attendance
figures on the games over the weekend yesterday on a Sunday on a beautiful
sweltering Sunday when it was 94 in the shade Alex Fernandez pitching the hero
you know come back after last year the big hero picks that great game opening
day oh yes the Cubans the law come out no Alex Fernandez's pitch it no and
announced crowd of 14,000 some odd I bet you you know basically because that's
ticket sold maybe they had like 10 or 12,000 people in there on a Sunday afternoon
hey to break the news to you John Henry are they interested no they're gonna be
any interest no none zero zip it do that I whoop my poop I I I I pooped my pants
hi this is Richie Simmons and since you haven't been sending me money for
anything lately I developed a big load of new diet merchandise like my
sweating to the oldies video then you'll laugh I use sweating to the oldies the
odorant when I work out honey I put out a sense that could strip the bark off our
redwood so don't offend while you've been get my yogurt stick and you like my
deal of meal then you'll laugh I do Richie Simmons I a poker game you play deal
with your friends and you know all their food and I've got a new line of work out
underpants I'm hoping we guarantee you lose weight because after listening to
Richie Simmons because ten minutes you won't be able to keep anything down
anything down 15 to 5 50 WQ I was just thinking I bet you there are a few I
should be in the Guinness Book of Records how many other people do you know who
have cracked their pants in Miami Toronto and Rome huh all three of the above
not anybody know anybody else out there no that's done that no I knew I'd
leave my mark on this world before I left it make no mistake about that so
anyway getting back to the inevitable the air Canada Center and our trip
now I will say this man just like you old Boston Garden in Boston where you
could take the subway and get off right inside the garden without even having
to go outside same thing with the air Canada Center you take the subway to
Union Station you get off and you don't even have to go outside you walk right
through and there you are in the air Canada Center just follow the sign beautiful
building spectacular brand new you know plastic much much better food than the
Macarena I mean much more different variety much much better food it all kind
of food but the aisles the walkways up in the you know in the walkway to
narrow much to narrow jam packed with people out there and then you go inside
like I said Rimmer gets us real real real real crappy seats I mean really you
know the price was right right there were free but you might as well sit
close enough to be able to see the game it's kind of like the goals that are
being scored at the other end which the least with those five goals in the
first two periods all were most mostly at the other end and you need
binoculars to see what's going on oh there's the red light at least you can
see the light come on but other than that you can't really see what's going on
down there way on the end bad and unfortunately the bad news is that thanks to
Gary Batman thanks to the sports moguls and all professional sports they're
just strong it's not only new arenas and new ball parks and new stadiums but
it's they all have to be the same they all have to be equally plastic and so on
the big scoreboard there it's generalized horrible acoustics by the way the
worst in the world they they play the same corny crap there that we see at
the macarena thank you Gary Batman you jackass you stupid little Jew you idiot
you know the thing with Gene Hackman that seems in the locker room and they're
doing the applause the one thing I will say though in Toronto though those are
very polite people don't get them going here they get sucked into that doesn't
face them at all they don't start applauding they're they're busy in a coma we
stayed for two periods of course you know the outcome of the game Toronto one nine
to one if I would have known they were gonna score four more in the third I'm
out of state and every time to leave score I jump up I'm screaming and I'm
looking around now I realize the crowd in Toronto they're like I said they're
very polite I think even when they shoot you they say oh sorry sir here you go
really the two polite but I mean the people in the air can of the center they're
not just polite they're in a coma they're in a coma baby I look around
everybody sitting yeah but we just scored a goal hey we just got yeah okay and
now what they're doing is like in the red seats I don't know about all the
other sections they got platinum seats they got the gold which used to be the
best at Maple Leaf Gardens they got the red and then the shluppers way up
there with the Mount Palomar telescopes and the binoculars in the green seats way
up there a million miles in the sky and they have the the usherette school
around like to do a pp park with their little order taking and they are a
little computer and they take orders for food while a game is going on so
people are passing money back and forth and passing credit cards so not only are
people getting up and walking back and forth which you never used to see this
at Maple Leaf Gardens but now they're passing stuff back and forth and food back
and forth and just incessantly goes on and on and never ends just tragic very
sad I mean it plays looks nice but they've totally destroyed the atmosphere and
there you can't complain about the atmosphere in this building there isn't any
there is none zero like I said the sound system blows they aren't blasting it
that got out they can get it they allowed to blast it it was just other than
the outcome of the game for me other than that it was just depressing very
depressing all the same garbage up on a scrubber all the same music that
that that that that you know this is what it's all becoming I was thinking to
myself why I'm serious about this why do we go to sporting events that are on
television for free huh seriously that's that's a magnificent question like for
example the Panthers have two more home games Wednesday against Montreal which
I'm still debating about that Saturday against Tampa Bay against the lightweight
the last home game of the season I'm not gonna be going to that no not not on
your life I'd rather stay home and take seeds out of my back and we'll go watch
the lightning in the Panthers but seriously why do we go they keep building all
these stadiums in the arenas and it becomes less and less appealing fewer and
fewer of the people who go there just like at the Macarena have any interest in
the sporting event that's going on there there is smooth it's a social event or
maybe somebody gave them the tickets they've got any idea what's going on and
you've got drunks and you've got assholes and all just the same old tired stuff
and the other doing it the your Canada Center to they put the people up there
in the scoreboard and they're not not as rock as it is here of course because
they're two polite but they're you know making assholes out of themselves
there I am on the big screen hey let me see if I can be an asshole hey why why
I mean television most sports on including hockey unless you were more on
all these people say oh I can't see the puck well there it is it's that big
black thing there any ice you asshole they they televised magnificently and
they do a sensational job of covering the event and you don't have to worry
about if you're sitting a million miles away and you can't see what's going on
I can't I can't think of any sporting event in the world that I can't see
much much better on my big screen TV on my Sony XBR with my big dish and my
small satellite dish and the cable virtually every goddamn game is on there
why do why do people go what's the point huh no that's yours I mean I give my
tickets for free there was a time like with the dolphins five years I paid
every year I've you know paid the schmuck for the dolphin tickets and there was
also a time on the first couple of years two three years with a panthers paid
for my season tickets very expensive would I pay now no I get the tickets for
free and I'll be honest with you it's a real chore and then the arena is like
four or five minutes drive away from my house and it's still a chore I still
have to motivate myself to be interested to go and know when it gets to be
another one of these and most of the games are boring I mean really coma
inducing terminal oh you could die from it and I find myself recently like in the
last month or so if the other team gets up like two nothing or something like
that praying for them to pop another quick goal or two in there so it can be
like so lopsided we know the outcome and we can leave early I just fly out
there when it gets to a certain point I just like somebody just turned on the
electric current and the electric cheer and I just zap up out of that
cheer and fly out of that place and I heard this you know D.
Faux but nice call by the way D. Faux wreck them do it now see that was a
14 slip doing so all this morning I sure hope Joe isn't sick enough they
have to take into that clinic you know they'll fix him up good there but D.
Faux was talking about how boring and terminally NFL draft isn't about
the draft next what assholes they are I thought D. Faux finally grew a little
period right about that but the first caller I heard on the morning show this
morning was chronic Joe you know with the thick voice chronic sports Joe you
you would know oh god I'll be hearing him in my sleep after I'm in the box I'll
still be hearing that voice and then some bitch calls in and she's going to all
I've been to two Marla games they won both games but what are we gonna do about
those crowds nobody seems to care there's no way what are we gonna do I thought
to myself yeah what are we gonna do what do we get over it honey nobody's
interested they don't care that's what we're gonna do is they're worried about
something more important than a stupid ball game which we have the Marlon to
the match by the way today at 105 or she let us out of here an hour early that's
why we care about it nobody cares and the sports nerds failed to recognize
this that more and more of this these big plastic facilities millions and
millions and millions of dollars being spent and I don't know I still don't
understand what's the big attraction why do people go when you can see it I
if it couldn't see it for free if there was no TV then maybe I might understand I
don't know about your house but in my house my living room my family room where
I have the big screen TV much much more comfortable than being in any arena
or stadium much more comfortable I can go to the refrigerator I can get
whatever refreshments of my choice the prices right the food is already there I
can get so does I can go take a leak without fighting crowds like I had to do
between periods in Toronto the other night you can sit in your underwear sit around
and you're underwear you can even you're underwear nobody will smell it that's
right I mean why do we go why why are we out of our minds are we nuts
what was the big attraction there I'm really I really am depressed about their
air canada center I would have thought I mean the building is beautiful don't get
me wrong and if it weren't for those narrow hallways out there where the
contestants are if they would have done that a little bit better it would be
perfect from the air every other standpoint but if a sterile is the inside of
an oxygen tent I mean there's no atmosphere and there never will really be
I don't think I mean just a big place with a lot of people and very very I
I can't imagine that too many people in that joint are really getting great
sight lines I mean there can have to be out of the 18,800 that the thing holds
for hockey they have to be about at least 12,000 of them who are not getting to
hurry good view of what's going on I must they have binoculars I mean it's far
far away I mean way the goal of the other hand we're sitting in the corner
behind the leaf shoot one squad I guess you'd call it and the goal of the
other end it looked like you were looking down the end of a tube at the end of a
tunnel that's how far away the other end looked and the goal of be
coordinated little you see that you can see the red light and the green light
they're up there out of glass on an unencumbered and uncovered like unlike
here but you can't really see what's going on there way way far down there
I mean I don't understand since they would normally to care about the fans
anyway I'm looking at some of the seats in the upper deck in the green section
I mean way up in a corner so far and so steep that if anybody takes a bad
step look out maybe that can be some extra added you know instead of that
stupid stuff they do it between periods with little kids playing hockey and
with all that other throwing a crap up in a crowd maybe they can do that have a
contest to see the cooking rig the most beers without tumbling out of the
upper deck down on the ice and then if they do everybody then we'll get some
reaction from the crowd it's it's sterile it's just not that enjoyable and
people convince themselves oh we're having a great time baby sit home you watch
that thing on TV you see everything up close and personally get the added
effect if you got good nonsense doing the game I mean you know it's an
enjoyable experience and we keep me you know and I used to I confess I used to
be one of those same people oh you got to go out and support the team you got
why why do you have to do that chicken have a bunch of drunks fill in
beer all over you getting into brawl's in front of you have a bunch of and
then by the way I've been to many hockey games that may believe gardens of
Toronto where people actually were paying attention to game yes what hockey
fans the people behind me the women they're doing the same crap that I have it
to Macarena that that that that the whole game they're talking about nothing
that has to do with the game and the food is going back and forth and we're
passing credit cards down to the end of the line and money back and forth and got
me two visas and one master card by the way deal Rogers and now the league of
greeners don't make fun they were very hard for this
game
so let's hear it today you want to go to the games you want to sit at home and watch
him free on TV huh why do you go why do we go why do we get in our cars why
do we hop on a subway why do we go to these the venues why do we spend a hell
of a lot of money or even if somebody gives us the tickets and by all of
that overpriced food and put up with all the other book grab and can't see
about eighty percent of what's going on what is the point I think it's a
magnificent question will he answer it today no probably not here's
book a hello yeah no I've been to air can this and it's nothing like what
you're describing is exactly like what I just described and everything you call
Gary Batman stupid you what are you stupid you what are you yeah ah
schmuck this guy wouldn't know where to find the air Canada Center if you
stuck out if you stuck a compass in a road map inside of his rectum uh-huh there's
a good call for you the air Canada Center of Boys and Girls the void of any kind
in fact I'm not just making that up they've been writing about that in all
the Toronto papers they all say the same thing there's no atmosphere in
here man it it wreaks of death in there they've got the foster hew up memorial
gondola I think foster's body is hidden up there somewhere I really do because
man in fact all through the hallways up there even remember mentioned to me
about the halls in the building they stuck yeah I think they got Harold
Ballard and foster all buried in there right inside the building yeah I just
made it up sir because I'm a male content and a bad guy here's Miami hello
and I don't okay sir yeah we got to get to the doff and you said like right
below what you said now we should come talk to you because my father wouldn't
let me raise me not to bother you but uh good nice going dad basically we
got to do the offing games because the seats are so good but I guess I see
what you're saying because how many people how many people are any sporting event
have great seats yeah we do a word we're second row we should have one forty three
yeah so they're really good seats we've got a game but I'm an NBA fan and I bought
the Sunday take another Sunday ticket to NBA league pass right and it's actually
good and I guess you're hockey fan you probably got that you can get anything you want
right I can come home from work about nine thirty the games already started and I
can flip through I can see any game I want to see I'm in home I'm in my living
home doing whatever I want and you're getting you can watch as much as you want if
you want to you know get up and go out and do something go to the store or go
on you know whatever you're going to do uh with you know three quarters of the way
through the game you don't have to worry about it oh gee he left early you know
like you have to answer to somebody I mean you do whatever how you want yeah you
don't get up you don't feel beer anybody don't want to throw beer on you no
white is complaining there's no yentos there's no uh... TV time I said there's a
TV time I you put on HBO right that's why you do a channel serving and you
you don't have to sit there and wait wait for something to happen and you can't
beat it you cannot beat it the other day I could see that you couldn't really do
it this is hockey I don't I mean I'm not a big hockey fan but I guess I would have
to be there why I was very interested but I guess if you really into it like you
was good and you enjoy it but I used to say that that nobody really enjoys the
hockey game till they've been to one live but with what's going on in these
arenas now I mean the whole they've killed it they've destroyed the atmosphere
in the ambiance it's nothing like what it used to be
but it's been a fan I mean nobody can go sit down and take all on the morning
fifty dollars right right
exactly okay
how do I make my show next one there you go there's a guy make some sense why do we go
in fact I guarantee I'll come over again those tickets for the a pan through
the Tampa game on Saturday I'm not going to that in fact I'm gonna say right
now those and there will be a lot of people maybe they'll even sell a place
after that but I can't imagine why not just because they've lost seven role
because they're so far out of hand they're because they suck okay not just for
that reason but why would you make the effort to go someplace to be bored like
you like you're compelled to go like you're gonna feel guilty if you don't show
up or some stupid thing like that I don't feel compelled to go if I want to
watch a good hockey game on Saturday I got my two satellites this year I guarantee
I'll find one it won't be in the Macarena watching two tragic teams see that
this is what's going on now they keep watering it down and all professional
sports watering it down at expansion and expansion expansion so the product has
become so mediocre and that's why they have to sell all the the flash to go
along with it that's that's like this NFL drafting that's what that's all
about and then you had to have to the man they have created an event out of
nothing anyway this big what is that I don't want to hear that promo okay that's
stupid promo oh yeah we'll be wrapped up we'll be taking baths in the NFL
draft they'll be drafting guys that haven't been born yet with names that nobody
even their mother can't pronounce
that's just a big hype job okay to try it because it's a substitute for quality
like all the stuff that goes on with your rain you see shooting the t-shirt
something in the crowd and the little blimp is going around and people are
running and screaming and knocking each other down and then the music you know
and all this look I couldn't believe the same corny clips the same cornball
film clips on the center ice scoreboard now I will grant you that when a team
came out for the lion for the warm-ups that they did a much better job than
here because actually there are people that understand who the players are
and what the game is all about so they would like do close-ups Matt Sundin one
goal away from his 30th of the season and they they would show you stats about
the various players courtes Joseph you know stuff like that but once the game
started baby it was all it all exactly the same all like out of a cookie cutter
for the whole league now every arena's got to look the same every scoreboard has
got to have the same crap on it the music so I got to be that that that that
you know all that same gerry glitter garbage they've killed it here's a mobile
in pember time hello okay sir the similar thing to the pantopetrol or
the breach of the game now they haven't got they haven't sunk that low yet now
that's that's what I was afraid of that if they get that low then you know that
it seems like all sports is seeming to go that way yeah I think only one game
this season and I went when the dancers played the devils and I enjoyed
myself but you know it is becoming it's it's they want to keep it's just families
and the little kids there and it seems like the adults are becoming little kids
too and I'm unfortunate I'm sick and tired of it could you I have a request
could you play the hockey mat in Canada theme no five six seven oh five 60
pound five 60 on a mobile one line why would I play the hockey mat in
Canada theme what is that all about of course not pound five 60 on a mobile one
line let's do a full-blown pinecrest hello how you doing sir can the
group of these pointy events you know what it is just these people have no
lives at all they work all day boring jobs and it's just they got they got
someone to go at night you know what I'm saying yeah yeah I mean all year long
I've been asking about the people in our in our arena the macarine and why
a lot of them are there because it's obvious they have no interest in the
game they're not paying any attention to it they show it seems like they
show up whenever they feel like it and they leave it the most bizarre times
not just because the game is lopsider but I have no idea I just don't
understand why people go to these things like I'm saying they're lives they're
basically stuck you know and they just want to let them know that they're going
to game at night just to say that they got something to do but it's ridiculous I
wouldn't go if they if they do if we take it I wouldn't go good for you pal
well if we took it buddy I knew that was coming we wanted to test we should
have tested them there huh hey sir you want those tickets no he wouldn't
say then he grabbed them in a heartbeat five six seven oh five sixty pound five
sixty on the mobile one line our usual spectacular response here this morning on
a Monday and see this is the wrong station for this anyway just like D-fo was

Go find a life
Okay, I was saying to read a break to George
Like the same thing with auto racing and what's the other one?
There's one other one too, it's the same thing
Where you see almost nothing of what's going on?
Golf?
Oh, forget it, look, I wouldn't even dignify those people
I will not discuss people like go to golf tournaments
Those people need serious psychiatric assistance
Okay, oh, but it's the masters
Wow, who's gonna wear the green jacket?
And by the way, a guy named Maria
Yeah, the guy that won his name is Jose Maria Schwartz
or whatever this guy's name is
What kind of a middle name is that?
Maria
Huh?
Is that like Jose Sally Aganzales?
I mean, what is the most kind of a name is Maria?
For a guy
Because I'm telling you, the guy's middle name is F and Maria, okay?
Maybe they wanted a girl
Auto racing is one of them
And there's one other one I can't think of at the moment
It's flipped my mind
But it's the same thing
You people go as hundreds of thousands of people go to any
They go to a Daytona
And they sit there, what percentage of what's going on?
The action that they really see
Assuming that it's worth seeing in the first place
Just will agree on that for the sake of argument
What do they see?
No, unless you're saying
What percentage of the actual race do they see?
Or if they're rooting for a particular driver
How often do they see him?
How many minutes he laps before they see him come around
for the next lap?
Out of the 50,000 laps that they're running
10%
Well, yeah, 10% maybe
See another great thing about sitting home and watching it on TV
Whatever the sporting event is
If it turns out to be crappy
You're turning something else on
Or you get up and you go out and get some fresh air
Or you get laid
Or something more worthwhile than sitting there watching it
Which is a hell of a lot easier than having to get up and slip out in the park
And find your car
You know, you know what I'm saying?
See the real answer
And I've been saying this for years is pay per view
For all sporting events
For everything, no more free TV
Not a lot of money
You know, maybe three bucks
Three bucks a game
You can watch any telecast you want
Hockey games, basketball games, football games
Three, four bucks a game
I'd be willing to pay it
Right there in the comfort of your living room
As opposed to going into these places
And then I don't understand what it is
I still don't get the people in that macarena
I'll never figure that out
They like it, they're masochists
They like Janine
They show up late, they leave early
They're milling around in the hallway
Kind of like aimlessly
Here's a mobile in Miami
Hello
Hello, Neil
Yes sir
Good morning, how are you?
Great
Good
I answered your question
It was really simple
One in the Marlins
Nobody goes in the Marlins
I mean, it's first week of the season
And the first week of the season
And now an old buddy cares
I mean, they can't draw flies
If they were giving away $50 bills
They still couldn't get anybody in there
Right, the heat
And they're talking about a new stadium
By the way, they tried to use that opening day win
Remember that last week?
Oh yeah, a new stadium
Where we're going to put it now
Like it's a done deal already
You know, try to con a public into it
And you know, the dolphins
I mean, you got so many die-hard dolphins fans down here
You know, you literally have to go to the eight games
That they have once a year just to go and see the game
Because you've always blacked out
Yeah, that's true
I'm like all the other ones you're right
Yeah, and as far as the panther
The only thing I can think of me is I'm Jewish
And I go to see you and my other two or three other Jewish friends that go
And that's about it
I can't think of any other reason to go there than that
You go there to see Jews?
Excuse me?
You go there to see Jews?
Well, the only other Jews that are in there
All you guys do is drive around and sunrise
That's all you'll see is Jews
You don't have to go to the Macarena and sunrise
You just drive to go on sunrise lakes
Wow
That's the only Jews you want
I definitely don't go there
I live in sunrise lakes
There you go, there you go, huh?
Okay, you can't fail
Zagizant
Whatever that means
5670560, pound 560 on a mobile one line
Very, very meaningful topic here today in this show
Is there a big response?
No!
They don't care
No matter what it is they don't care
But the draft they're whipped up about
That they're excited about
Because if football, football, man
Because they're morons, that's why
Because their low lives would no life
Here's sunrise, hello
I knew how are you
Okay, sir
At the risk of becoming a cornice
I feel compelled to call
Yes
I agree with you a thousand percent about the football draft
And about the attending the sporting event
I did go to the ballgame last Tuesday
I called you and told you I was going
Because I got the free ticket
The moral again?
Right
And they were up in the nose, greed section
Almost to the top
Yeah
Couldn't see anything on the field
But little sticks figures, you know
But we had a good time
And weather was nice
It was my anniversary
And we had a good time
You had a good time doing what
You couldn't see the game
Well, you know, just being there
Out in the open
In the air
Usually working inside all the time, you know
Yeah
But anyway, it was a game
I bet it was nice and comfortable out there yesterday
And then 94 degrees weather
That must have been beautiful
All right, I was working yesterday
Point is
That I am a met fan
And there are three games on
And out of the three games
Only one of them is being televised
So I can't watch it on television
Of course I can listen to it on the radio
Yeah
The other thing I wanted to talk to you about was
I have a person very near and dear to me
Who had the same experience you did
Yesterday as a matter of fact
That's exactly right
Yeah
So it happens like he said it happened
Craig, like that bumper figure said
The crap happened
That's all
The last thing is
I know they've been talking about the Shawshank Redemption
I don't know if you were Steven King fans
No
He wrote the short story
Not even in the least bit
But the movie
I'd rather watch Larry King than Steven King
I'd rather be dead than watch Larry King
Well, it's not a horror story in any way
But it was up against forest gum
For the Academy Awards that year
For his dump
Yeah, which I know you love tremendously
And um...
Well, I got it now
I haven't gotten around watching you
Organ Freeman
In fact, maybe Saturday instead of going to Panther Camping him
I'll watch your Shawshank Redemption
That's a better alternative
Okay
But Morgan Freeman was nominated against Tom Hanks
And I felt he should have won the award
As did William Goldman
I know who he is
No
Well, he wrote all the presidents, man
Why do you say you know I know who he is?
Well, I think you may have heard his name
You're an actor
You've never heard of William Goldman
In my life
Until this moment I've never heard that name uttered
Oh, well
I've heard of Irving Goldman, Saul Goldman, Irving Lipschitz
But never William Goldman
Well, you may run across his name now
And again, if you're reading about movies
I can do a lot
But anyway, just thought I'd bring a little bit of enlightenment to you
And that never spec'd
But it's a good movie
I think you'll enjoy it
See it at the ballpark
Okay, okay, okay
Not
5667-0560
We got 200 open lines here
5667-0560-050-560
On the mobile one line
Anybody else really been to the Air Canada Center?
At first caller from Boca, that phony baloney
He wouldn't know where to find it
If they stuck his ass right on the center right
Not exaggerating
Was very bitterly disappointing
I mean, just another place
They're all looking the same
And I mean, the hallways are interesting
Because they go out and all over all the memorabilia from April 8th
Gardens, that's great, a lot of history in nostalgia
In the hallway
But most of us don't spend the whole night in the hallway
Here's the mobile in Kendall
Hello
Hey Neil
Yes sir
How are you today
Okay
I was in St. Louis for a week
And man, let me tell you, I really missed you
I went up there
And I was sold impressed by the sports town that it is
Yeah
There were kids with McGuire's jerseys on
Fathers with McGuire's jerseys on
Advertising anywhere with McGuire
The town went bananas on home open at night
They had tech rallies
They really support the team up there
Incredible
The only thing is the town is a dump
It's depressing
Well, what would you rather have?
Would you rather live in a nice town or a place where they support the sports team?
Well, that was the point I was going to make
I come back to Miami
I couldn't wait to see the palm trees
I get here and I go
Well, wait a minute
This town ain't any better
The only difference is
Nobody supports the teams here
But what difference does that make me?
Did it ever dawn on anybody
What I've been saying for 20 years
This isn't the sports town
Did they ever cross anybody's mind?
It's unbelievable
You go downtown and it's beautiful
They have a new dome stadium for the ramps
They have the things
Who don't want to see them?
Nobody wants to see them
But they have a new Kiel Arena for the hockey team
But how many new arenas do we have to build?
How many new stadiums do we have to build?
That's my point
They're peddling crap
They keep expanding and expanding
And the quality is diluted to the point
It's like taking a fine wine and mixing half of it with water
With the turpentine
I mean, what's the point?
I would be like putting a dome stadium in green bay
And telling people to have to go indoors to watch the green bay packers play
Right
I don't know why they would build the dome stadium in St. Louis
But they did it
And that's how they suckered them in
To get a new football team
And look what they got
Well, wait a minute
You're not telling me that they're not going to play baseball in the stadium?
They only play baseball in Bush stadium
And I don't know what to say
I understand but of all the places where you need a dome stadium
Have you ever been in St. Louis in the middle of the summertime?
Oh, it's like the end of the end of the world
It's like being in a jungle
It's like the end of the world
It's 100 times worse than it is here on our worst day
People drop dead to come here
So how come they're not playing the baseball in the dome stadium?
They make them with tents
You tell me
Yeah
Okay, thanks for the good news, sir
5, 6, 7, 05, 60
Take me out of the ball game
Let me go back to the house
That's what I say
Let me go home, let me out of here
Out of the zoo, out of the circus
People with their ball games, with their tickets, with all these things
That's, that's why they have to have all these accoutrements
That they have to jazz it up with all this other phony baloney crap
Because actually what's going on now there has been watered down to a point
Like I said, it would be like taking a surloin steak, grinding it up
And mixing it with seaweed
Mixing it with sawdust
And saying, hey isn't this the best damn thing you ever put in your purse, huh?
You have it a great time here?
Right, we're having a good time
I have it on the first lottery day
Right, we're having a good time
WC playing hands, I have it on the first lottery day
Oh, yeah
Five hits, and I'm weak
It billows me out for the piece I see
Like that ball, here I go again
I got the mud cheese, makes me want to smack
And then I'll lie down, going to take a nap
And then I'll get up and I'm making tracks
A couple of toasts and the buzz is coming back
Now I get it real whenever I roll that weed
Talk about my favorite sets of delicacies
Mix the extra cash and I'll sell you a little too
Yama
Who's the only roll I've bought this loaf to bet
Boy, I'm gonna hate to take that pure intent
My back forages weren't got only those
With the illegal grass grows
And this good stuff has to give me golf, eh?
Yama
11-0-0-2 at 560 WQ, we got a couple hours to go
And then we got the marlins and the bets
Yes, we do, the marlins and the bets
No, I'm telling you whether you want it or not
Hank will be on after the game, good luck to you Hank
He'll be on after the game, go 6th and 6th at your list day 2
And then we got, what do we got?
6 o'clock we got the Josh Friedman
Josh Friedman
And Jason, we're gonna be doing an hour and an hour and an hour
Cause they were cheap, a lot cheaper than the Schvokor Mourney
And 7 o'clock we got the Panthers at Ottawa pregame
Game time at 730, anybody gonna be listening to that?
No, nobody
Yeah, I'm thinking of myself here, I think I'm talking myself into coming into the real world
To getting some common sense, it's never too late, even in my advanced age
It's not too late to talk myself into getting some common sense
And I think starting next season, even with these free tickets, for example,
If we marlin tickets, they just sit in the drawer
I don't even give them a wipe, I'm not gonna kill the show with giveaways anymore
So they just sit in the drawer somewhere
Wasting away
And with the Panthers tickets next year, if it's like when the Leafs come into town
Or if it's a game that I feel is worth seeing, or if Pavel Burry comes back
And there's some excitement out there, and it's worth going over there to see it, then I'll go
But just to go over there, just because I see, I feel like I'm compelled to go
You know what I mean? I feel like I'm obligated to go
Why the hell should I be obligated to go?
Because it's there?
To sit there and be, see, I'll tell you one of the reasons I do go to those games is I don't eat
Trying desperately, I mean, desperately to lose the weight
Which is, my weight hasn't changed a half an ounce in the last three weeks
And I've been on tremendous behavior
So when I go to the doctor today, he better give me off that hydrochlorothylxide
And put me on something else so I can lose some weight
But I mean, when you go to the hockey game, so I drink my diet soda, one of them
And that's it
Oh and by the way, the guy that called Friday was right
What am I eating meatballs for? Everybody puts bread crumbs in meatballs
If you're on the edge, you can't eat meatballs
You putt, you schmuck, you idiot-neil, right?
But seriously, well, I'm not going to feel compelled to go anymore like I have to put in an appearance
For what?
So I can be bored to tears and wait for the score to be lopsided enough that I can justify jumping out of my seat saying
Let's get the hell out of here! That's the hell of a great evening
So I can sit there with people holding up their little kids in front of me
And waving to non-existent people across the way
Who never seemed to wave back by the way?
Yeah, they keep waving but nobody ever waves back
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello
Hello?
Yes sir
How you doing, Neil?
Okay
I just wanted to make a comment about the golfer named Maria
In Spain, they used Jose Maria, who was the parent of Jesus for boy
Jose Maria, wait a minute, Jose Maria was the parent of Jesus
Jose Maria?
Joseph, I'm Mary
Joseph, your little name was Maria?
No, the mother of Jesus was Mary, the father was Joseph
Yeah
And so they used Jose Maria for boy?
What about your little son?
No
And they used Maria Jose for girls
And either gay, they can just either wave
How about Mary Mary?
Well, yeah, that could be another choice
Maria Maria
One donation now, and the way they use it
Okay, which is gracias?
Okay, see Maria, I still know by that, Jose Maria
That's a girly name to me
That is, that's my mother
Hey, what do you call somebody named Jose Maria?
I guess it depends on what they're doing at the moment
5670560, how they're addressing
And pound 56 on the AT&T line
Here's the mobile and cutler rage, hello
Hey, Neil, do you call him Mary for short?
Yeah
This and something, you had a pretty crappy weekend, I...
No, we had it actually at a good time
Actually, at a great time
I mean, we're all pretty good, caught in a snow storm
And also go to see a crappy, you know, once I did hockey game
Quick story related to that about two weeks ago, I have a newborn
And I run out of formula, I get three o'clock in the morning
Had to run out to my local 24-hour store there
And pick up some, and I had some formula
I had a tackle bell feast about two or three hours earlier
You know what I mean?
And right about two blocks before the old house, you know
Nature in Cogni, you know that, those little cramps that just
Remove like you have your leg
It starts with a cramps
And then the M disappears in that word and it becomes something like cramps, yeah
It was either my brand new truck or the street
And gets what I opted for, three o'clock in the morning
Street, right in the middle of the street, baby
All right, take care, Neil
Okay, nice choice, good choice there, sir, who the hell's gonna...
Huh? Maybe the turlith police would come along at three in the morning
The third police
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line
See this, they don't want to hear this, they think they want to hear just the opposite
I don't care, that's the way I feel about it
I'm not sure we had a bad time, I'm glad I had a chance to go there and see the place
And you know, the price was right on the ticket
Terrible seats, river, awful seats
But the actual experience itself, I mean everything that could have gone wrong
Paul Morris, who's been the least Pian answer for a hundred years
He was off his feet, he was calling the mispronouncing names
They sang both national anthems
And when they finished with the Canadian-O Canada, he says
Ladies and gentlemen, when you please rise, oh excuse me, he was reading the wrong card
He was like one event behind it
Everything that could have been out of sync, it was just depressing
For a place where for the last 600 years, they've known how to put on a hockey game
But not anymore
Because it's got to be the Gary Benton way, baby
I can't take one more of those deals, you know
In fact, you know what's going to happen now?
Now that I've had that experience
Every time I hear that song, I think it's going to like my bowels will start twitching
And it gets to that part where it goes
Like that, I think I may just cut it loose
And you can assume what that song
Can't stand that song
And I can't stand the people that get off
I mean, how many times do they have to play it before you finally say
This is boring already, place something else
Play that corn ball stop and Tom Crap they play up there
And, and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and play something like that
Anything play like like the bird thing there I hate to bird play anything remember that
Just don't play then that then add it add it add it add it oh stop already
It's coming out of my ears it's coming out of my
Oh God
And the rolls you can enjoy it and not not up there. I mean up there that we did as a doormy
Like I said, it's one thing to be polite. It's another thing to be in a coma
Check the air Canada center to see if there's a pulse in that crowd
I've never in my life been at a sporting event before when the home team keep in mind I'm a leaf fan 100 years now
The home team scores all these goals every 10 to the score go I get up and scream and I'm my whole section
They're looking at me like what's wrong they're all sitting on their hands
I'm not exaggerating. I mean I'm looking down below and to plant them seeds in the gold and there's you know some people standing
They're all sitting on their hands
They're sitting on their visas and master cards waiting for somebody to pass the change down for something to feel the change
Depressing
Are you ready for Lahada on the edge toilet tissue to never hit your ass then you're ready for XTV
Extreme toilet paper this ain't your typical food lie it's heavy duty to handle the heaviest duty you can throw at it
You're talking super-tarts turbo-fly corrugated cardboard with an attitude we're talking the inner prize certainly your age is rising out the
Queen on we're talking over the top and up your butt can you handle it XTV it's not just tissue
It's an utterly gnarly ran to get away to take care of business that'll lead you gripping the edge of your toilet
See extreme toilet paper when you want to do more than just wipe you wipe out
It's love and 14 I did at 560 WQA and this whole business about you know why it's a great sports town
Yeah, so what about it the idea that because a lot of people go to see ball games that makes it some kind of a great city
Sorry, I don't buy that at all not that this is a great city because it's not but it's also not a sports town
X pew public uses coach of sexual misconduct
Oh
Now guess which so-called sport this is in it ties right into what we're talking about a couple weeks ago on those
Fag occupations figure skating that's right figure skating and this is another one of these stories just like that
Sheldon Kennedy story with a hockey you know about how he had been molested for about a hundred years many finally decided he didn't like it
Even though I kept coming back to Graham James House every night
This is similar there was much better story in the Toronto paper yesterday which I should have cut out
I should have realized the paper or would have a very you know, but this is here and that's there
Richard Callahan who coach Terrell Appentke to an Olympic gold medal has been accused by one of his former figure skaters of sexual misconduct
The New York Times reported on Sunday. Well, that's why I read the story because I did by yesterday's times at the airport. That's right. That's why I read it
And I had the whole list of other names of guys who come forward now and said yeah, he's a whatever
Craig Marisi who skated for Callahan and later became a colleague
Well, what does that mean? A colleague
Told them just like you know Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Oh, here's my colleague Dr. Watson who lives with me
Told the newspaper they've been having sex in 1981 and he now thinks he was exploited. Now, how do you like this? In 1981, the beginning of having sex with guys now 36 years old and now he thinks he was exploited
As he looks back on it
Callahan denied having a sexual relationship with Marisi the time said
Callahan contends the accusations are a ploy to rob them of a skater that they Detroit skating club where he'd been the director of competitive skating
Jim disbroke president of the west biggest skating association said Marisi informed him last month of the accusations
This bro said his organization cannot act until it receives a formal complaint Marisi planned to submit the complaint in a few weeks the newspaper said
Disbroke was in Sweden for a weekend competition attempts to reach him more unsuccessful
Marisi 36 said the relationships started after Callahan moved to Philadelphia to coach and in the New York Times story by the way it says it continued to like about a year ago
For 18 years he molested this guy
And he just decided he was exploited
Marisi who began working with him when he was 13 finished 5th nationally in pairs in 1989 he had appeared
And then we didn't hear this line this is the best this is the greatest line in the history of the human race
At the time I thought the sex was consensual Marisi told the times now when I look back I don't think it was consensual
I don't care how old a student is whether it's a boy or a girl a coach would never have sex with a student
At the time he thought it was consensual
But now he doesn't think it was
That's like that would be like a woman saying at the time I thought I wanted to have it but now I think I was raped
For the last 17 years
Happened
Yeah, oh it does happen
Same ridiculous crap is what it is
Marisi never reported any misconduct by Callahan before he said he's able to discuss the matter now because of the support of his wife and therapist
It has a life you know
Oh that in France so does the so does the coach by the way
The time said it spoke with Callahan and for four hours at his office in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan and interviewed four dozen skaters coaches official agents of parents
I don't understand this Callahan said the allegations are awful
I can't believe I worked my butt off for kids back home to be successful in skating to be better people and this stuff happens
Callahan with Marisi coach Lapinski 1998 Olympic gold medal
He also coached Todd Eldridge to five national titles in a world championship
He and Marisi split as coaching colleagues last year
Callahan 53 is marrying with a grown daughter
It has a life you know
He resigned as the director of the Detroit skating club in March telling the time he was tired of travel and coaching grind
He was tired of grinding it
18 years this stuff went on and this guy suddenly decided Craig Marisi he was being exploited and he was then abused
And don't forget he has a wife you know
Here's a mobile and four-letter deal. Hello
Obviously he must have liked it
Evidently
Hey Neil
At least for 17 or 18 years then he maybe got tired of it
Yeah like the caller a couple maybe got sore about it
The caller last thing there was with the Jose and the Maria
Yeah
Didn't that guy just win the master's yesterday
That's what I was talking about yes
Maria Jose
Hey name is Maria Jose Sally Schwartz Lapute
Alley Balls
Right
Hey
Resident goes through hell all week
Aren't you just go ahead and slap them tickets my way for Saturday?
Yes, slap this, okay
Slap this
See there you go
Why don't you just go ahead and slap him my way
Slap
Trap
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60
On the AT&T wireless line
See they don't want to talk about using the
Well if we got free tickets like you did Neil
See that's not the point
The point is whether you're free or you're paying for them
What's the big deal of going?
What is the attraction when you can sit on like all the Panther games this year have been televised
And I can think of so many nights that I wasted my time and effort
Shlip it over there when I could have sat home and a game turned out to be a disaster
And then like very early on turn out something more enjoyable
Like a real game maybe
Here's a mobile in Hylia
Hello
There's no facts in figure skating
Not at all
On the Jose Maria thing
He is not married and still lives at home with his parents
Who home Maria?
Yes, if that means anything so to speak
How old is he 48?
33 years old still living in home with his parents
He's still at home with mommy and daddy like Barry Jackass?
Yes and very private they said on the telecast
He's a very private life
Oh boy
How about that now?
Oh but you mean to say that a possible a possible a suspected one of those may have won the Masters yesterday?
Oh!
Oh my god what's it coming to?
And one more thing
What do you expect to be an expert on balls huh?
That's true
Any one mentioned Hank interview with Alonzo Morning on Friday?
No
In true Larry King's form
He threw so many bouquets Alonzo is opening up a flower shop today
Did he did a marshmallow toss again?
Oh my god not one tough question even when it came around to the lockout type of thing
Yeah
Nothing he was kissing his butt the whole year
He took that
He had finally had a chance one of the key guys in that lockout thing was Alonzo Morning
And he just let him let him off those didn't ask him one tough question
Nice
And Hank great job
Okay
See you
How's it going Clark doing?
567 we got 600 open lines here it's another grim Monday boys and girls have a short show you better hurry but it get with it
We're only here to 105 and then we got the marlins in the midst 5 6 7 0 5 60
Pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line
Then my good friend Ellie Brecker wrote this ridiculous story about this Orthodox Jew
This rabbi Shmouli Boteach
I do like that name though Shmouli
Never made a guy name Shmouli
That's a great name
He says sex and marriage should be joyful
But as you read into this very long story which I have no idea they must have a lot of empty space in the paper
Or Ellie needed a few bucks to write a stupid story
He says that married couples though should have observed Talmudic law couples must abstain from sex for half of every month
He says
How do you like that you like it?
No
Ridiculous
And he also says oral sex and toys are okay sex toys they're kosher
How can you have kosher oral sex?
I mean how can you eat pork and it can be kosher right?
Every here a kosher pork?
No
But pornography and masturbation are not okay not so good bad evil evil
But sex toys that's okay
What about mutual masturbation?
No no no no no no no no
What about mutual sex toys?
Correct them
Huh?
Yeah the Orthodox Jews they must be having a lot of sex a hell of a lot more than just half a month
Either that or they're doing a lot during that half a month because the real support the more Orthodox they are the more they reproduce like rabbits
Like 10th world people the pope would be proud
Here's Miami hello

Two Georgia show on Friday from 132
Tell them to save this money on emailize this don't wait it's not too late
No it's not too late I have to take it back

Anyhow Neil I got a spy report of all you all I know who's like a rocket scientist took his establish a Florida driving test
And if I know you'll
He failed it baby
He told him but the book says and they said that's right but the book is absolutely incorrect sir
Oh right
So a guy who couldn't fail a trigonometry test if you have paid them
Fail to the driver's license test
Okay thanks to the good news
Boy that guy I don't know he that's one of those crimes but he's got a real annoying voice almost like that Joe that caused the sports cars all the time
Oh that guy grabbed me nuts
I know Diffo was doing it so all this morning in the show too so he didn't have much choice but that Joe
I'm telling you Diffo you want to get those numbers up on a worst team show get rid of that Joe guy I'm telling you take a pull on Joe
The audience is in revolt with Joe they can't stand Joe Joe mama get him off the air
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line here's Kendall hello
Either the viewership of the Panthers games is less than I thought it was or I missed someone's call to you this morning
But are you aware of the introduction given by Denise on Saturday?
No
No
You're not
Do you remember his description of how he felt one night?
Yeah
That you have on card
Right
Well in the first 60 to 70 seconds and his prepared remarks
I feel really really stupid
Yeah
Well check out if you'd like to take I will bring it to you tomorrow it's beyond belief
His prepared remarks
Yes
He described the Toronto Maple Leaf style of play with the Panthers playing underneath the handicap of all the injuries
He just picked their style they as that's right as one
Yes just what you played
He said that
Exactly in his prepared remarks if you'd like to take I could drop it off there tomorrow
He said that again
I promise you
He said it again
I listen to it
That dumb frog said it again I would give
I'm just amazed that you don't know about this
No
Well I know but I want you to do it three times
I'm begging you for that tape
Oh I will have it tomorrow
God bless you
You'll have it tomorrow let me ask you one other thing
Yeah
Because I was out of town
He said it again
But this is in prepared remarks
Oh
This is not ad lib
But I don't even understand what the point is in other words he expected Toronto to just roll down in the roll
I don't know what the point of the remark was I don't know why he would call their style of play that
And I don't know how that relates to the Panthers injuries I didn't understand that
But I am 100,000% sure of what he said
I feel really really stupid
Exactly
Tell me about the lovely lady
She's gone
Lovely lady
Yeah
What lovely lady
Lovely lady on 79
Lovely lady
What are you talking about?
What lovely lady
Oh God
Lovely lady on 79
Watch to your face
Oh Sandy I love you go from my guy you go from
That's the very important
They're both equally boring you read about that
She's gone
Yes, but gone for one time
Well thanks for the good news
I thought you'd like it
Okay, okay he's bringing the tape tomorrow. Thank you sir
Oh my God if Denise Pantman said that again
I mean it's one thing to be a dumb frog but sooner or later don't you learn from your mistakes
No
Don't you learn you can't say crap on a year
And I'm sure that we're still bringing him on the year on Thursdays at 4 in the afternoon
I don't want to be labor that point
A lot of books are needed
Oh, darling, I'm begging you
The thought is too stagnant
Donnie is through the moon
What's so bad with you?
Donnie is through you
What's so bad with you?
Denise Pantman
Denise Pantman
Denise Pantman
Denise Pantman
Denise Pantman
Denise Pantman
I'm so fed up with you
Oh, what a jerk you're so great you're a worse than a wise one
And I like you
You're so happy from your act to a fuck
I'm even crying Murray won't get here anymore if I do
Oh, darling, I value
A purchase to statue, Taiwanese through you
What's so bad with you?
Donnie, I value
What's not just to statue, Taiwanese through you
What's so bad with you?
Donnie, I value
What's not just to statue
He's a genius, he's a real raving idiot
1131 at 560 WQM just an hour and 35 minutes away from Marlon's baseball
Marlon's animates from Shastate him in New York
Any interest don't even say it
56070560.560 on our AT&T wireless line
Why do we go to games that are on television for free?
That's a reasonable question
Why would you make the effort to spend the gas money?
Especially people that actually have to pay for the tickets and for parking
And then people are belly again
Oh, geez, they're not supporting their team
Well, what they do isn't that a shame
Let's put them in the electric chair
They didn't support their team
Now see the guy before that call the NFL
See, they were the smart ones
With the blackouts, they knew how to blackmail the fans
If you're not going to fill up the stadium, we won't have it on free TV
And you won't see it
Here's Miami, hello
I knew
Last Wednesday, about 1230, I called you from Havana
Because I was with a small group of people
who listened to you every day
And I said, well, why don't we call them?
We were in the house, you know
But the station did not accept the call
They said the data and accept the call
The call had to be made through an operator
Right
And I thought you were expecting DC passage of several households
Well, it would have been very interesting
Because these people have, you know, they are fans of you
As I told you before, the only station that gets into Cuba very clear
is 560
Right
Because it's not a political station
But what they told me to give you a message is that they love to see you there
Maybe even do a program right from Havana
No
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
You don't want to make people crazy
No
No
Okay, anyway, you are invited
I'm not in the guys with beer, anyway
Not to do the program, but to visit
No
No, either
No
The Orioles went, what did they do?
Okay, put it out into the Orioles
But next time that I go, I'm going to try to arrange it with George
I'm going to try to arrange it with George so you can accept the call
Okay, I think we call this collector from Havana, what's that goes called?
He's that Rabbi, Catholic?
He's Catholic, he's reproducing to make the Pope happy, right?
Okay, Neil, nice to meet you.
I'm reproducing like Rabbi, it's okay, I'll read it, Ertchi
Thank you, Neil
And Gratius
567, special hello to all our friends in Havana, by the way, I'll ten of them down there
who are gathered around our radio listening for the truth as Fidel is the AL Antichristo
and the Tupacabra all rolled up into one and hasn't bathed in ten years
But other than that, he's okay
567, that's our poll question, who's worse?
Iliana Gross-Latinan or Fidel?
That's a tough one
That's like Nippentuck
567, 0560, 0560, on the AT&T wireless line
Here's Pompano, hello
Neil
Yes sir
Hey, how you doing?
Okay
I got it, man, I do go down to the Panther Games, I'm a level of penguins are in town
but I do pay for my own tickets, but that's the only time
Yeah
Still 100 Spy Reports for you
I was listening a couple weeks ago, I tried calling you a couple weeks ago with your phone system hung up on me
He had a guest on the other day with all the Y2K craft going on
The guy had an appliance shop from Pondontan LA
and he had offered a, if you brought in your toaster and your blender
he'd do a real cheap microchip change-up to help you comply with the Y2K
Yeah
And it was hilarious, I guess you have to listen to him, I mean
Are you sure?
Can I have a shameless request, Neil?
Maybe
I've been trying to call you for so many weeks, I never get through and the...
Anything still 100, maybe even the...
What's the one that?
The Jews against the Niggers in a hockey
The Jews against the Niggers, okay, never write that
The Jews against the Niggers
Okay, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
The Jews against the Niggers, there you go, are you gonna play that?
No
No, at least he said Jews
Yeah, the Kites against the Spicks against the Waps against the Niggers
5, 6, 7, we got 400 open lines here today and hour and 30 minutes to kill
But let's put the ball game on early, what do you say?
Come back and tell you my experience and these people that cats got their tongue again today
They got nothing to say about, they like going in and shoosin' around
They don't give a crap about what else is going on there, they're having a good time
They like sitting there and seeing the big push up on the screen
and acting like a bunch of jackasses and getting drunk, they maybe have it a good time
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line
Here's Miami, hello
Hello?
Yes sir
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
Okay, we come back from Las Vegas, Italy
and it was real nice last week
Yeah, probably not so bad the week before either
Huh?
No, I mean, we say at C-Sers
Right
Well, you know, we find a deal about the best of all of this
We went over to see the New Wanda in Mandalay Bay
Right
It's brand new, you know, and it's pretty young all that
but somehow he got no...
No personality
Like Bellagio, I was very unimpressed, it's gigantic
and they got all that art in there somewhere
but just another big sterile place, it did nothing for me Bellagio
The New Wanda, I've been going to open it in a few days
The Paris and the Nation
No, Paris isn't going to open in a few days, isn't it November?
November, well, one of them is going to open it
The Nation's opening in a few days
Yeah, it looks beautiful
Well, they outside, you know
Well, it just keeps getting better there, you know, if you don't like one place, you go to another
A lot of five people though, a lot of five people all over the place
A lot of fat people?
Yeah
We're in trouble
Okay, whatever you say, pal, I'm glad you had a good time
A lot of fat people in Vegas, okay?
Do you ever know this thing?
No
I notice a lot more fat people here than I see in Vegas
In fact, you can go speaking to the Macarena, you want to see fat people go to Pat their hockey game
You'll see more fat people in your section
No matter what section you're sitting in, just in the one section, then you'll probably see in all of Vegas
I don't see fat people, I see like any, and he's probably hanging on the wrong places
Probably out with all those fat Mexicans
Well, Mexicans are fat, they're either one or two things, they're very skinny because they're undernourished
Or they're very, very fat because they're, again, nourished poorly, bad food, you know, bad diet
They're eating all that to starch
Other than Luis Miguel, have we ever seen a really well-built...
Oh, and by the way, speaking, now who is this that he's supposed to be hanging out with now Mariah Carey?
Mariah Carey
Is there anybody that she's not doing?
Me
Seriously, and why? You think that she's, you would do Mariah Carey?
Yes, and you think pictures are her lately?
Not lately
Oh, one of the tabloids that I read on the plane had a picture of her in Luis on the beach during a Capucco
Oh, my God, I thought Jesus Christ, Luis must have found a beach trail out there
She just hoarded up, she's gross, she's really gross
I'll take another look
I'd rather do Andy Carey before Mariah Carey
5,670560, I'd rather do Hugh Carey
Is he dead, by the way? Dead or alive, Hugh Carey, remember him?
From New York, wasn't he the governor, the mayor, who was something in New York?
5,670560, 05,560, I'd rather do the AT&T, where I was flying
Don't go to Vegas, you'll find too many fat people there
All that guy says
What? And if there are?
Did like, there's a punchline, one of your people don't ask me
I don't speak his language, whatever language he was speaking, I don't speak it, okay?
It was one of your people
And quit picking on Kiano Reeves, okay?
Just because he looks like a dead end Rukunan and Sam the Shamar Promotion Man
What? Like a Mongoloid, like Sam
Want a Lonely Top Little Boy?
It's the musical show everyone's talking about
In their only area performance, the Spice Girls tribute band, This Spooge Girl
Is he one of you massacred like this?
He got a gift for his boots
They're here, they're hot, and say love
Spooge
This is the Spice Girls, this is the Spice Girls, this is the Spice Girls, this is the Spice Girls
Hello, where's the Spice Girls?
All songs represent Spice, love is everywhere
We believe in Spice, how are they?
I believe in you, where they think that's the Spice Girls, this is the Spice Girls
This Spice Girls, in their only area performance
If you don't see this show, then you don't know Spice
16 to noon, our poll question
How many years do you have to have sex with somebody before you decide that you were being exploited?
Huh?
200 years? How about 500 years? How about 157 years?
Marisi says at the time I thought the sex was consensual
This was for 17 years this went on
Now, when I look back, he says, when I look back, I don't think it was consensual
I don't care how old a student is, whether it's a boy or a girl a coach had never had sex with a student he says
Just like Shelley Kennedy, or whatever her name was
You know about Shelley Kennedy, the hockey player with Graham James, or Shelley Kennedy?
He has a wife, you know?
Oh yeah, and the O'Ferry?
He has a wife, you know?
Oh, he was just in the back seat, he was sleeping, I'll show it
He didn't know nothing
I mean, these are the most bizarre, and they put these in the newspaper like with a straight push
You know, like, yeah, this makes sense, does the mechanism sense to me?
No
No
Here's Cutler Ridge, hello
Hello, doctor?
Yes
How are you doing, Neil?
Great
Listen, I want to lodge a complaint about
Broadcasting, Marlant's, baseball
If I'm not going to go to the stadium and forbid myself to watch them, why would I want to listen to it?
That's the idea, we want to give it the opportunity, you don't have to go especially since it's in New York anyway
You can't afford to go there right now
You can listen for free
That's a joke, man, I want to talk to your program director, I want to kick his ass
Alright, come on down, that will take about 30 seconds
By the way, nice desk in there, bluff
Is this as the, uh, a, a, a desk coming yet?
No
For pussy galore?
No
No
Well, maybe James Bond stole it
Seriously, it had his name on it, pussy galore
I walked by through this morning, I purposely looked in there to see if he was still sitting in there with a little tiny table
With a pewter on it and all that other stuff
I mean, no
Not there
No desk
It's only the 12th of April, this can be another one of our contests for the QAM audience
Take up an office pool
What date, what month, what year, what century, which lifetime, even Shirley McLean is laughing about this
Which lifetime does Duff get to desk from Greg Reed?
We can't afford no desk
We got to keep paying Wayne and John Henry
And boy, if you think nobody wanted those Marlant's bots before
Hooh, way, no way
Gonna be unbelievable is here
They can't draw flies
You know something, what I did in my pants in the Toronto with the Eaton Center
You could do that, like the guy that went out there in his truck three in the morning on the middle of the street
Nature was calling, you can drop the load in the middle of the street
You could do that right in that second base
They could have the whole organization just do a big, they could take a dump truck out there and try to take a dump
And they still couldn't draw flies
To it
Because nobody cares
Oh, but let's build a new stadium
You see how ridiculous this is?
You see how in Congress it is?
How alludeic, recit is?
Nobody cares, but let's build a new stadium because then maybe somebody will care
Will they care?
No
Will more people come?
No
In fact, fewer people will come because who the hell wants to go to downtown Miami?
They just don't want to get the message
The only people who care about Marlant's baseball and this listing audience are the ones who resent the fact that they keep preempting parts of the game
And they show for stupid ball games that nobody cares about
Those are the only ones that we ever hear from
560-560-560 on the AT&T wireless line
Here's Coral Springs, hello
You carry is alive and well
Mariah Carey yes
And the Harold did a faux-pai yesterday that was unbelievable
Yeah
They created a special section for Disney Resorts
And you know, I didn't really pay attention
I was like, I'm not going to go there, I thought that on the floor
And I went into the main section on page three
They had to reprint the entire front page of the Disney Resort cover
Because the one that went out was only a proof
Full of errors
And they had to reprint the entire cover in color on page three the main section
Great excellent
Announcing that it was a problem
I hope that they have a lot of sleepless nights over too
I'm sure we did need it maybe one of the last times we'll get some advertising
Excellent thanks for the good news
Bye-bye
Anything that bad that happens to the Harold can only be good and active God
560-560-560 on the AT&T wireless line
We continue the search here pressing, pushing and plotting
They won't tell us why they go
They won't tell us when they can watch that swill on TV for free
Why they keep showing up?
Why they keep driving from Palm Beach from Dade County
From from Yannem's Vell from Monroe County
From over there on a West Coast
What are they doing it for?
Why did they show up?
When they can see it for free better in a more comfortable environment
Without all that effort
When they can like turn it off anytime they want they can avoid all the dead spots
I don't get it
Here's a mobile in Wellington hello
Neil
Yes sir
I'm going to try some Palm Beach to go see the games
Yeah
Come down to you once more I don't know man
Next year I'm going to really seriously want to think about this
When you get your wood a game you feel like you've been entertained in other words enough to make it worth your wilder of driven down
No I feel like it's been over that's what I feel like
Right
Absolutely
Yeah
Even on TV I feel like I'm going to be a little bit more careful
So what are all those people doing there?
Why can't why will they not tell me what it is that they keep coming back for?
I'm begging I'm pleading they will not tell me
Free T-shirts dude that's what it is
They're not but how many people get free T-shirts about ten of them during the whole game
And all those little pucky kids get the T-shirts
You're right hey I heard there's 1100 people at a White Sox game where we can do that
You're 1100?
I couldn't believe it somebody told me I could
Sure if that's true I'll have I will have a sexual accident in my pants
I kind of think maybe Popman was saying that Toronto had a Chippy team
Well Chippy
I don't know if they're really Chippy no they're not I don't think so
Well what can only when I was Chippy out there was a big black guy named Peter
And it's a good thing for him Chris King didn't beat the crap out of him
Yeah I heard his last comment last year in person but I didn't hear this this year
I believe that he's bringing the tape tomorrow and I just I can't wait to get my hands on that
I can't wait to hear that that's a true too
Hey up here in Palm Beach remember where that priest was a Catholic priest
was in trouble from less than all people over all the years
Right
That same church got hit by some vandals and these kids robbed it
And they stole the place where they keep them
They got Jesus' body
Blood
Yeah
Yeah it's blood and body and they're all freaked out because well first all they stole it
And they dropped out in the field and they just they just they just created his body
Well God sure isn't doing a very good job of protecting his houses of worship
But I tell you that all these churches getting burned down and vandalized and stuff
He better get with the program and stuff weren't so much about ball games
You know my neighbors go to that church and they don't go to that office
I was informed I informed them over a weekend and that happened I said listen
If you want to convince me that there's a God these guys were been dropped dead
Right in the middle of the field I didn't stole that I believed them all
I believed today right now that they're the God of that will have
If they just got dropped in their tracks out in this field they robbed that thing
Okay God bless you sir
Hey Neil, I have a great life
My wife wants to a gang but she calls it the Baptist Church
Okay
Later on
5,6,7,0,5,60,0,5,60 on the 18th

Why are you list line?
How many years do you have to be molested before you decide that it was wrong
You didn't like it
110,755,2,000,1600
Here's a mobile in Miami hello
Hi Neil
Yes sir
I can tell you what a Denise said Saturday night
Yeah
You're trying to say shini hockey but I guess you had a little foot of the tongue
Okay thanks that's what the guy said well let's wait till the tape comes all of a sudden now
Everybody's on his said Denise Pipe had bad luck and now everybody heard it
I'll put it on a guy called before he's got the tape
Nobody heard it okay
Now everybody in the brothers and not only they hear it but they all have a different version of it too
I feel really really funny
Yeah
I mean when you look up the words dumb frog

Look up dumb frog in your dictionary
And there will be a picture of Denise Puthan
Old number five
Five they wanted to give him a higher number of the islanders you couldn't cut that high

All right
Okay good luck

Yeah the wife you know Rob Low has a wife are we buying that no not for a second
5 6 7 0 5 60 Palm 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line here's a mobile in Miami hello
Hello I'm Camille yes sir how you doing great I'm Camille in regards to my Aunt Mariah Carey
I saw her at the Oscars the other day and she's a house looks like she swallowed a baby elephant that's what the pictures look like she looks like she's ballooned up like somebody stuck a bicycle bump in her
Correct though she's ballooned up the way D-fo has oh my God it's ridiculous and by the way I'm on my way to
We can go country right now so if I see them together I'll say hello okay I was out of town
Yeah Louise the kiss for me
I was out of town last week but what was your dick on the the debacle the 911 debacle the what?
The 911 debacle with the Panthers I was saying what do you mean debacle what do you mean debacle it was great
Well for a Florida Panther fan that that I am but anyway for Toronto Maple Leaf fans which I am it was great
Yeah we stayed two periods it was five to one to two that was enough for me and then I get back to the hotel
Turn it on and find out the final score was nine to one I said how come we left you got to love the Panthers
But the air Canada Center sir they're all the same they're all cookie cutter arenas there's no atmosphere
There's no noise they had the same corn ball clips on the screen there the film clips it was a bitter disappointment
And the seats that Rimmer got us sucked as well
Really so
So other than that
Okay Neil wow thanks a lot
And have a great day
Thanks a lot
Yeah yesterday morning we have our you know breakfast our brunch at JJ Mugs there by the
Eating Center I had my little experience in my pants go back and you know freshen up
And all of a sudden a little bit later it starts snowing out of the you know what a forecast at
Cloudy rain in the afternoon well just a little bit off
Like about two inches of snow in about two hours and everybody's freaking out the near pork. It's all screwed up
I just want to say this okay because I can't stand delta. I hate delta we're going through Cincinnati
We went up that way it was supposed to come back the same way and
We go to the terminal three terminal one. I'm sorry terminal one there a person report delta and
Everybody's backed up and every trend we forgot all the everything's all backed up now planes delay they had like an engine to have a
Snow this is this is Toronto okay not
Miami I got to understand if we had an engine to have this no on Miami it might screw things up a little bit
Okay, it was like the world was coming to an end but they were very nice once we finally got up to the counter and we got on the American flight
Non-stop out of Toronto which was on time miraculously and I want to say it one more time
I know a lot of us were very pissed off with American even if we weren't flying them at the time during their strike and rightfully
So it was a grotesque thing but like I told you last week
Well, you fly wherever whoever's flying where you want to go. That's all you can't be that choosy if
You want to go you go with whoever's going at the time you want to go
And I know Hank was talking about the fact that unless you run certain flights you get based even in first class almost no food on
American absolutely correct. He's right about that
But wait, so pick a flight where they have a meal because the food on American Airlines
I mean I'm gonna tell you it's not good. It's sensational
For airplane food. It is phenomenal. God bless you American with your great food even though the one that pilots drive sucks
That was bad, but you know, you got overlooked these things right come on a good meal
Had a turkey brushed with zucchini man. It was good. She won your heart in the miracle worker
Despite her handicaps. She left behind a lifetime of achievements and now with a discovery of rare audio jigs found in a basement somewhere in New Jersey
Death Jan records makes available to you Helen Keller saves the blue

sure was that the eating center i hope nobody found those underwear
here's a mobile and son rise hello
yeah near yes sir
i like going to the games because i like watching the game live
and then the old arena it was great and now this new place
i live six blocks from the place yeah
and don't find the maries i will not really like that just for next year
great good good news to hear that and that's the you know but i love enjoy the
game so i mean i can understand you got good seats like i have great seats
almost right at center rice in the arena i have tremendous seats
but i i the people that sit like way up in the corners and then those little
narrow seats i wonder why they keep coming back what is it i mean they really
such great loyal fans which i have a very hard time believing that i mean
what is it that keeps bringing those people back i have great seats but they're up top
but the great seats that you know that i can see the game and that's what i want to see
i mean i i'm i'm telling you we had seats that were supposedly expensive seats
in the zircan at the center toronto thirty night and that the seed what was going
on in the other end you have to have binoculars i mean it was just too far away
but i've walked around the arena and like i can see the go lights when they come on
i can see everything from my seat i see your seats but it's just that's a hassle
now it's just like it's often games became a hassle the marines became a hassle
now the hockey's become a hassle i will not renew if they don't fire the maries
excellent maybe my gmail come true sir
hey show show on southeastern hour show
yeah well that starts in our you know everything is to start small
okay that's what i keep saying okay i have a great day
everything starts mall and eventually like uh... maybe mushrooms up
like a button mushroom five six seven o five sixty
five sixty on the mobile one line any interest in the metham marlins come on
let's hear from some baseball people some people who can see you can smell that god damn
raw hide that leather huh can you smell it
here's a lady mobile in west pond beach hello
hey nil yes man i was fortunate enough to be listening when potman said that
the other night he did that again he blankety game
oh i have to move out of the room and i screamed my husband pop and he said it
i get him he's an asshole wow i believe one guy that guy has it on tape
so you can hear it i can't wait for this yeah it was great
that's for the good news okay
yeah the these potman are more on of the month not just for April but any
month you pick any year you pick he is a moron
five six seven oh five i mean i can understand that when the game was over
that it was pretty shiny or whatever sounds like that
pantheon getting wild nine to one the biggest loss in the history of their
organization by the way the biggest uh... margin of the feet also
first time they forgive up nine goals in the game leave it to the end and you know
the sad part of it is if he didn't watch the game well maybe was said if he
did watch it was that in the first period for most of the first period like we've
seen so many other panther games the least weren't the least but interest in that
game they did just uh... you could tell they had no interest
and all of a sudden uh... you know panthers caught up a couple real easy goals
there at the end of the period and they said well you know we do need the two
points we're trying to self-worth please okay let's kick the race
and they did
here's a mobile and jupiter hello
and i didn't see sir
i think i can explain why on some of these all these arenas are now
becoming so superficial
because uh... if you try to cater to a real hockey fan
like uh... you are kind of i am to i mean how many fans are going to be there
especially in my amy how many how about in Toronto
why do they have to i mean they got the best hockey fans in the world there
why do they have to bring in all this plastic stuff all this prefabricated
contrive bull crap on the scoreboard the gene hackman thing with a phonial
applause to try to get the crowd i mean i'm sorry but it did just made me want to
try to see that into here you can expect it because here these people that's what they go
forward the contrive crap they don't even understand what's going on
that's the only thing i was uh... thinking about all the shouldn't have to do that
but around here if they just cater to the real fans we have uh...
and i'm gonna tell you it's not working up there either if anything it's having a
backlash because uh... i mean that crowd is gotten so combatoes
like i said every time i jump up and cheer i look around me and i thought
she'd better sit down and make an ass out of yourself
as much as i hate to say it i i definitely enjoyed watching the game in the old
of my memory and better than i do now i agree absolutely
so i do have a good day and meanwhile you're a big fat goose bag
all right maybe he'll be in Vegas soon that's where the fat people go that's
what we hear you hear that fat people in Vegas
have a funny part of that is i don't i mean you i look i started to say before
before interrupted myself when you go to Vegas
uh... most places you see a lot of really beautiful people
like especially the mgm grand
beautiful people young people living in breathing people people
actually like our uh... human
which you don't see too many of those here
really know you have to really scour the countryside to see any way that looks
like a real like i said living in breathing for but you know nothing's perfect
we got that nice weather was 120 70s today in the shade
nothing like leaving a snowstorm in the middle of April
with two inches of snow on the ground and the temperature must have been
right about thirty three or thirty four degrees because it was like hovering
right in between and coming in you get on the plane in the pilot says
all nice weather down in my mind the current temperature is 94
if i didn't have bad for you when you keep those extreme temperature changes
doesn't look like me because i'm starting to like a little frog i just thinking about it
a little bit of a frog in my throat
trying to think if i ever did have a frog in my throat
nine minutes past noon if i wonder if i didn't even ever had a frog in it
well you know about the news he has uh... problems
if you love those great songs from those great mafia movies
you flip over real mob hits
not only does real mob hits give you more of that great mob music
but you also get awesome sounds of real mob hits
like look at the ice pick the armor getting his at the hundred and six
street barbershop forget about it
or who can forget solid fish getting the old piano wire across the trope
if i remember correctly it was a bee blast
so what a real mob hits now if you know what's good for you
just by dialing one eight hundred bottoming real mob hits
hey it's real forget about it
before 14 and five sixty wqm our poll question today for our guiding light viewers

you're the one alright there's one I knew we get some interest if we pumped it enough
you know I have even tickets to the Marlins this season so I guess I'm the only one that I'll care for
so why now why do you have tickets to the Marlins games
I enjoy baseball and I guess that's why you go to the hockey games you enjoy hockey
yeah but I'm not seeing very much
well I'm serious most of what I've seen this year has been so painful that I wouldn't categorize it as going and really seeing the entertaining hockey game
I enjoy hockey but I don't want to see crap
well that's kind of what we're getting on the baseball field now but you know at that point
you just hope that sometime you'll see something good
yeah that's the way I look at okay have a great day I always hope for seeing something good
okay look at this two lines left on the board here a coma inducing a crowd again today again can it be possible
that these people are even dead than those people who were sitting in the air Canada center around me
who all look like Rip Van Wink a lot of bad day
I mean it was kind of like they were afraid they might irritate you if they made any noise like
two polite two polite say something maybe there was one group of guys goal leaves go they were trying to get you know
the crowd pumped up and forget it I mean granted it was the very website of game very shortly after that
especially after the first period but I mean get into it a little bit we're having a great year baby

I mean I put them in too that's what leads you after watching a television program I'm surprised that you could watch me make that come in yourself after watching what
after watching your television program I was surprised to hear that come out of your mouth because you know
well this because somebody is ugly I'm young and good looking I can say something like that no no you're wrong about that everybody has taste
okay you know you don't have to be a gourmet cook to enjoy a great meal any more than you have to be beautiful to be able to spot a beautiful person
if you're complaining about a soft Florida look with the people yeah you're not making it any more attractive but I'm not going anywhere
sing okay not only that but it's the lack of excitement when you're in your interview in your radio program in the TV show
is the right I'll do like excitement about life you some things are bummed all the time I'm not from the dawn
there's a guy that walks the TV show and listen to the radio show it is also making the effort to call me today why do you why did you watch and why do you listen

okay well grad I hope you enjoy listening to a waxy 790 server because you sound right in their median
demographic about death plus 10 we don't care don't you understand it's like the people

just like the people want to rehash the light bulb and mr. ego this and all is all enjoys
Kaufman that nobody cares that's not the audience we want we don't want to talk to any of those people okay ever ever
ever baby sitting dead people I did that for like 15 years okay 10 years that was enough of that

see if if there were a god he would make anybody look like this we all look like that guy that called the only way he looks like
right we'd all be beautiful if there were a god but God of course being the sadistic bastard that he is he made some people look really really good
and some people look really bad I'm doing okay sir they come as a shock to you I'm doing just fine

I love you too much to look at anyone else there a land is I had a dentist appointment that day and I was nowhere near the sheriff's metal lips hotel
I would never cheat on somebody who treats me so good with all those grimy sats on all that money

he's looking to a bunch of crap right you only doing a radio show but he's you know I'm actually around it
when he called me a while ago and said you're going to come over 145 right I'm going to run after the office I may be 15 minutes later than that

yes sir the only team in town got a shot make the playoffs is that my every he we're not talking about talking about who is going to make the playoffs
okay oh you're a bandwagon jumper in other words whoever's going to make the playoffs is who you follow bandwagon from running from each
I guess I'm not interested in a bunch of 7-foot sparsas shant slam a jam in it okay go slam a jam in it and you're back to none of my face boring turd burger
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line obviously asked a question today that's a little bit too complex a little bit too difficult for asking people why they go to these places
okay I know that's a little bit of a tough question like if I were standing by the escalator there at the macarena went denied and I stopped all these people saying why are you here tonight
what did you come for what would be the answer to your question the game is on television free why are you here tonight and they would go
you know how they would go like that I keep asking all these things that they can't answer because you know something they don't have the answer themselves they don't know why
here's Kate Coral hello let me add to your list of a fact professions I consider myself the only straight member of this particular profession as funeral directors
really particularly in Howard why didn't know that oh my god it's they're everywhere not you know not that I have a problem right but yeah they seem to be attracted to professional not sure why maybe staring at others old naked men all day
maybe staring at stiffs yeah but yeah there seems to be a lot of gay people in funeral directors and now we do have to arrange a lot of flowers but I'm not sure if that's the easy one
maybe that's it maybe those panties might have come in handy but they're attracted that's a put that on your list okay thank you okay
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line not that he's one you do understand we believe him huh we believe him here's a mobile in pompino hello yeah three words for a week we don't care listen did you catch any of that what does that mean I mean I agree somebody call as I call what is most ridiculous crap it's unbelievable
oh you mean we don't care about what he was saying yeah well he's only about two weeks behind now yeah I mean that show is like you said 1987 I think you know life
842 listen Neil every time I call you keep on talking listen let me tell you this did you catch any that Pittsburgh game yesterday no I'm telling you better off I didn't realize how dirty this guy was he slapped the stick over
on these wrist he broke his 50 hit him so hard and there wasn't even a penalty yeah I mean this guy's unbelievable and I brought those back in that he looked good yeah I know
that Pittsburgh and Toronto I don't like that match up though I'd rather hit three into one of what that that's not going to be the match up in a playoffs I don't know
figure that you think you think the penguins are going to finish fifth yeah well they they got the Rangers they got the Rangers and the Islanders out of their next three games yeah I really
feel he's got to play Buffalo I know that yeah so one of those guys getting points and don't forget Buffalo's got four games left you guys only got three games Buffalo's got four games left
well personally I hope it's Pittsburgh and Carolina I'd love six bucks I'd love to see that yeah but I if you guys if I'm you guys I'm written for Buffalo to move up ahead of Philly
why is that Philly scary I mean either you're banged up I would I would suggest you that Buffalo's probably got a little bit better
gold-titting than Philadelphia I could be wrong about that but I don't know you could be right as usual right could be right as usual I will not
well hey we're happy just to be in fourth place pal we'll take it all these lean years we're we're thrilled and in closing
yes I'm bigger on your douchebag okay five six seven oh five sixty we're just a half hour away from Marlon baseball time you
can smell it in the air the excitement is so thick you can cover with your big toe how can you feel it you smell it
here's a mobile and bureau B cello
no yes sir okay hey listen I think I got it it's almost like an image thing going to these games for some people
you know they're obligated to go I you're right about that I feel like I've been obligated to go in fact
I don't think I'm even going to go by the going Wednesday why should I go these last two games I mean the
the quality of what I'm seeing is the whole team's injured anyway what's the point what am I going to
accomplish as though I have some kind of obligation to somebody to be there because I got the tickets what's
the point I mean I've been I've lived in New York I've lived in Cleveland good now that I've been to some
games and good fans and I came down here I'm a big doll from fan and I even had I had the opportunity to
go to the Super Bowl big hype that's all it was yeah I was disappointed it was like and the
Super Bowl's not for the fans anyway it's for all the you know hot shots I think you're more
tall of the thing I mean I was I was way up top in it you know it didn't matter I was there
was a once in a life I mean there's there's an event I mean professional football television and
football it's a marriage made in heaven that's why the NFL was lucky as it wasn't got to be where
it did was because of television because it is perfect in fact it looks better on television by far
that it doesn't person and great day okay you're crap it out and that's the truth five six seven
oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line yeah they don't want they people from the
Macarena they don't want to admit it they don't want to admit they're there to be seen and
smooth with their friends they couldn't give a crap less what the score is who the teams are that
are playing they don't know the names in ninety percent of the people that's before all the injuries by
the way and now forget it they don't want to admit that but like I said I'm I'm I'm gonna start
being a hell of a lot more selective and if people are gonna call say well you know you didn't
you're out for this game you know what tough crap that's my business too bad tough to pay this
like I have some kind of obligation written in my you know on my forehead that says oh well you
know you must attend otherwise you're not the maven or whatever the hell I don't give a crap
people going to places where they seem to have less than no interest just list I am and like I
said the air can of the center in a city where they live breathe and eat hockey where they sleep
where they have a puck deep inside their recto and sometimes think and these people were like
most of the game at least in my section of course leave it to remember to put me in the dead
section oh it's only five rows below the air Canada club yeah like way up in the uh boom docks
up there in the red seats I got I got I got red eyes just from trying to squint to see what was
going on the other end the whole game I know there's somebody way down there I think there's a
goalie and then I wait on the other end there huh sorry 21 before one man we're creeping up on
it you can like I said you can smell it marlin's baseball there's a big big heaping pile of marlin's
baseball coming any second we don't want John Henry to take it personally as he wants to they
don't care they're not interested they're not going to show up they don't care and all those extra
Cubans that we're going to come out for Alex Fernandez nice culinary yesterday baby who the hell are
you kids they forgot that they hold the big cock fights in highly every Sunday can they compete

until the day
300 the
right about 43 at 560 WQM as we move precipitously toward the top of the R105 exactly straight up and
down we got the marlins in the midst in New York our pregame show Hank will be on from
shulestake 2 after the game till about six o'clock good-like to him he'll need it following
that baseball game. Then six o'clock we got Josh Big Fat Josh Friedman and Jason from
six to seven and seven o'clock Panthers pregame Panthers at Ottawa to take another
shellacking tonight game time 730. WQAM. How you doing sir? I'm a lobster buddy. You're
a what? A lobster. Meaning what? I sat in Ricefield to watch that model game yesterday.
Many acts. Let me tell you. Okay now let me ask you this. They said 14,000 some do you
think that that was accurate? How did it look out there? I can see anything to
go around so so so big. Yeah. Let me tell you something they should be able. If you
say to Ricefield you should be able to bring them brothers in there because that is
that is a damn torture man. And this is all this is only not even the middle of
April yet. I don't think it should be able to bring a decent on
broad to cover yourself because you will get skin cancer sitting there for a full
season. There's no doubt about it. There is no doubt about it. If John Henry wants
public support for a dumb stadium he should start in Ricefield okay. Okay or
get or get the money from the dermatologist to South Florida. There you go. This
lesion brought to you by the dermatologist to South Florida. And maybe they can
have the American lesion sponsored the new stadium. 5 6 7 0 5 60, 0 5 5 60 on the
mobile one line. Here's Fort Myers. Hello. Hello Neil. Yes sir. Hi, this is Jim.
First time caller calling from Fort Myers. All right. After listening to you show I love it. Keep it up.
You've got me into hockey now. Yeah. Going over to walk to Florida ever blades. The
one the Florida ever blade ever blade. Yeah. International hockey league. Okay.
I'm going to come over here and watch it. No. All stadium. Yeah. I know you're going to come to
Fort Myers and I don't think you really want to. I might even want to. I'd rather
the beesleaves if I went over there. I don't want to see them. Give me 2D press. I know what you
mean. After living in Miami for 37 years I was dumb enough to come over here but I'm
going to do. Yeah. That's about the only way to go and make you appreciate here. Well,
I don't know. When I come back over there I can't leave fast enough. Okay. Like I said, this
is the only place you can visit that would make you appreciate over there. Yeah. That's
about the way it goes. Okay. Jim. Well, go blades go. Go blades go. Okay. Have a great
day. Whatever you say. Want to see the blade? No. Matadors. No. 5 6 7 0 5 60, 0 5 5 60 on the
mobile one line. Here's a mobile in high a. Hello. By the way, Bokar Brian was looking for the
crowd on the way to the Marlin game today when he was coming down from Bokar. Didn't realize
the game is in New York. Mobile in high a. Hello. Going once. Going twice. Must have got
out for the cut fights. Here's a mobile in Bokar. Hello. Hey, Neil. How you doing? Okay, sir.
I call you around a month ago to tell you about the fixed races at three hole. Yeah.
The three drivers will found guilty yesterday. Well, I hate to break the news to you, sir, but
George Brennan, you know, again, I don't believe you because George Brennan's been driving
in the middle and I will talk to you. Yes, but a meal. Yeah. Spension starts today. Yeah. Okay.
They're bought from freehold. They're repealing at the six months. The spend. Well, they're
bars from freehold. What about the middle? Because the freehold is a public is a privately
on track. The metal and the state owns part of it. While they appeal, they can still drive
at the metal land. Yeah. If they found guilty. If they lose their appeal, they're bought from
the metal land two for six months for six months. Yep. Also, what's the big deal with that?
Hey, you know, and not only that and it's freehold gets to keep all the money. They didn't pay
out to the to the patrons. Great. You know, the, you know, the, and Jack Lee will probably come back
and want a piece of it. Well, the carnal's coming to. Okay. We'll post you later. Whatever you say.
Oh, God. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line. As we continue our search, it's a never ending.
It's an ongoing search for years and years. We've been searching and looking and squeezing
and grasping. Have we found it yet? No. There's a mobile in Avengera. Hello. Hey, how you doing, Neil?
Okay, sir. I've spoken to you a couple of times in the past. I still love your show. I want to talk to
you a little bit about sports. I'm a listener. What? Sports. Sports. You've been talking about how this is not a sports
town. I agree with you 100%. These people out here think. Why does it have to be a sports town? See,
that was what I made the point I made before. Why does it have to be a sports town? First of all,
the median age here is 100. So why should it be a sports town? Exactly. And then all these
banana boat people, then the only sport they care about, like cock fighting and, you know, stuff like that.
You want to go to a real American sport? You want to go to a real city, go to the city of Cleveland.
Jacob. I want to go. Why would I want to go to Cleveland? I've been there. That's a toilet. I don't
want to go to Cleveland. If you're going to Jacob's field. No, I don't want to go there. I wouldn't go to
Cleveland if you paid me by the minute. What the hell are you going to see there? I was born at my hometown.
Oh, by the way, it's my birthday. Okay, well, happy birthday, you, sir.
No call us again. Please. Okay, we got 16 minutes to kill until a baseball time. Are we going to do it? No,
I don't think so. It's been a real dicey Monday here. I'll tell you that. They just don't want to
mess up. They will not confess their sins on this show. Why they waste their time and they could
sit there on their fat ass having a great time enjoying themselves be comfortable. And they go
out there and they create all that traffic and they go to these places and they get ripped off and
pay this wild extravagant amount of money and they go see a product to say second rate would be a
major overstatement. Okay, or understatement depending on how you look at it. A tenth rate product
and leave there and leave their bitching and moaning and grumbling. I hear them all the time on
the way out out of the arena down that escalator. They're bitching and screaming. If you, you guys,
you suck it, you know, and they keep coming back just like me. We're a bunch of massacres.
Just like coming back to this place all the time. At least there's a paycheck waiting at the
end of the rainbow. That's the only thing to come back here for and to go to camaraderie with all the
nice people that work around this job. Now there's some nice people here at Josh Friedman. Here's Miami.
Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Oh, yeah. How you doing? Okay. I'm with the rest of the other day and they
tried to offer me some flam. What does flam? It looks like it's not slime. It's not there. You think
it's good, but it's not fine. Okay, one call left on the board. Here we go. 15 minutes. I can
understand we die right at the top of the hour when you got the Marlon baseball game coming out with
a myth that nobody in there right mind would listen. But here we got 15 minutes to kill and that's it.
That's the that's the cruxier material here on a Monday.
5 6 7. I'll let you do the last 15 minutes. Okay. They like talking about that fact. You were talking
about on a key and a Reeves. Quit picking on him. Okay, just because he looks like what's his name
that you hate? Don't say it's a damn. No, same. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line.
George has got to think against Venezuela. In fact, anybody that isn't Cuban George, basically
or ain't too crazy about. Here's a mobile in Hylia. Hello. Hylio. Yes, sir. Can you feel the heat
in your mouth? Yeah, feel this. Get out of here, Sam. See, that's the problem being up here on
the third floor. Okay, go back to some work. I know that's not a new vocabulary. Go do something
productive. Also not new vocabulary. And close the door on the way out, Sam. See a Drew. Your friend,
Gianni. Here's plantation. Hello. Nihil. Yes, sir. Why do these people complain about sitting in the
key there for the mall and the dolphins playing September one o'clock in the afternoon with 72,000
people there? You won't see me out there. Same son. You won't see me out there. That's right. If
they're on the sunset, if that's sitting there, baking their brains out. Take it out. Even with all those
people, even those worklockings, you spit your guts out. Am I right? Absolutely right. Fits
in over there. And then these people, they don't even know what they're doing there. They don't
know. They just get sucked into it. It's the American FN way. Somebody convinced them that this is
what life is all about. They're in La La land. These people have a good and back to you. I
mean, I'd come back here. I could have told you boy, that crowd in Toronto, those people were great.
And that arena was really the atmosphere and air was spent. And that wasn't either of the above. It
was depressing. It was a gigantic. I mean, unbelievably depressing situation. Forgetting about the
game, which I love the course. I'm so good about that. I mean, not anything like what I thought it
was going to experience. Like being in a time warp. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line. We
keep, we'll keep plugging along. We'll make it toward the top of the hour. We'll get up there to
that goddamn ballgame with you like it or not. Because guess what? It's coming, baby. Squared Squared.
Game two. We had that one lady. It's always a lady. It's always some broad out there. Oh yeah,
I'm going to be listening to my own. I'm not talking about women. Okay. We don't have any women
listening anyway. We had women listening. We'd have a 30 share.
Women are too watching. They're too, too, too watching. Wiki watchy. They're too busy watching
that crap on TV. They were watching Jerry Springer. They're watching all that slime on their
on TV. Jenny Jones watching people blowing each other's brains out. All that's all those
snuff shows on TV. I used to watch them, but I finally said that's snuff.
74 1 at 5 60 WQM. See, I could actually kill the time in between here and go to the doctor,
but I can't eat. That's the problem. He knows that, too. I can't eat because I'm going to do blood test.
So I can't eat.
Oh, I love the liquid and that is why I become a singing lesbian.
Mr. Mary Catherine was so impressed with what I done. She gave the action with her son.
Can you see for safety leaves? That's it. Some went to number one. Because I was on none.
Sound away to make some hash and hope the royal piece will last because retired none.
Don't get none. I never made it that big because I didn't look that great. So I got the
young who have it. Two in drugs and getting laid. Had my one and only hit him and the Vatican got hit.
The hope said there's my big now that I'm dead. I can't reveal how much I wanted Sally
to go with my wheel.
1259 at 560 WQM. Well, that picked me up a little bit. Now I feel better.
Usually, the book of Brian comes around and gets depressed. Oh, time show, man, died. What am I going to do?
They're going to know me up there. They don't know you. Just walk, just waddle in there.
It's all there's that depressing guy from Florida again. They don't know who you are.
Here's a mobile and bouquet. Hello.
Yeah, how are you? Okay, sir.
There's some long time listener. You have a great show. Yes, I did.
Pack me up. Listen, I want to know what your opinion is. Oh, I'm sorry, but that's nothing I can do about it.
I want to know what your opinion is. I hear you criticize and cut down fun office and coaching of our
marlins, our panthers, our dolphins. I'll talk to you. You'll criticize it. What you criticize about
is just say the heat in Pat Riley. They seem like this such a clean click. I'm not interested in the
heats. I couldn't care less. I couldn't care the least bit in Pat Riley. I don't have an opinion.
Sure you don't. No, I don't. They're the only sports team that let me say it again. I couldn't care less if
I tried. I don't care. No, I will not. And I won't. Okay. And you can continue baiting and baiting and
baiting and masturbating. Whatever else it is you're doing, sir. And to play in your game. I'm not
interested. I don't give a crap whether they run well. This isn't a sports show. Number one.
In case you haven't noticed it's not an FN sports show. And sports nerds like you that that's all
you can talk about. Shame on you, sir. Let me say it again. Pat Riley listens to the show. He knows
basketball sucks. He knows it's a big bunch of seven foot freaks. He knows it's a pile of crap.
He loves this show because I'm the one guy in this station that's got the balls to tell
it like it is about that crap. And thank God for depot this morning. Finally,
grow a little pair over the weekend. Maybe got lucky this weekend with a Zon again off
again marriage and again out and again marriage. Talking about the draft and all the idiotic draft
nicks out there and he's silly no life people that make a big like this is some kind of a sporting
event like it's some kind of an activity. Something that people with a brain out of he interested in
which we know it's not. Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line.
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir.
An issue you went through a couple weeks ago you kind of counter-dicking yourself here, pal.
About what? You said that you're you're tired of going to hockey games and different people
sitting around you they're giving their tickets up they're not showing up and then you sit here
and you talk about you're not going to go anymore and you've had it. I didn't say I'm not
going to go anymore. I said I'm not going to go to the last two games. Neil, come on. Sir,
are you looking you have a conversation? Now, is that possible? Oh my god. Okay. Another asshole.
Another asshole. I'm asking you, sir. I'm asking you why do people go if they don't find it
entertaining and what I'm saying is that it hasn't been entertaining for a long time and to feel like
I'm obligated to go to last two games I'm probably not going to go. Is there anything contradictory
about that? No. No, there is not. And I've asked a million times by the way I'm not
contradicting at all. I've asked a zillion times during the course of this season why people are going
to that macarena since they don't even have an interest. I have an interest in the team and the
sports release when I do go I have it. I have a reason why I go. A legitimate honest to God
reason. Not just to sit there and smooth around and be seen by people and walk around and
stay up in front of everybody else and act like a jackass but you can't have a conversation.
Can you? No. No, you can. Oh, I sure got you. Go back and put another
jaw on your cheek. Okay, sir. Back to that cheek too. Here's Daniel. Hello. Hey, how you doing,
Neil? Okay, sir. Good. Neil, my question to a lot of these people down here is. What is your
question, sir? My question is all these people down here that don't like it here and brag about
Cincinnati and brag about New York and brag about Canada. It would be nice to see them all
ahead north of 595. Yeah. That's all. Okay, that's a original. That's a original, sir. Take the
bag with you and don't leave it or however that little bumper sticker goes. That's a original.
Maybe maybe a lot of these people have a point. Do you ever think of that, sir? No.
No. Maybe people like you are the reason that some people are unhappy with it down here. Do you
ever consider that, sir? No. Here's sport Lauderdale. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir.
I need a how you doing? Okay. Great. I've not listened to the whole show today, but I just have
a couple of little topics for you. Couple of little topics. A little bit. A minute and a half to go
and you're going to do the topic. Okay, real quickly. Is there any, I'm serious. Is Pat Riley was
no? The he, the, um, am I? Here's a mobile and crawl spring. Hello.
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing? Hey, listen. I'd rather hear about Rick Riley than
Pat Riley any day of the week and I mean, I want to think about Rick Riley. Yes, sir.
I'm from Boston. Yeah. And I went to the new fleet center up there and I was very
disappointed. Right. Same problem. That's right. And a lot of empty seats too because it's prefabricated.
These people don't understand what I'm talking about. I've been, I've been trying to convey a message
here all day and you're, we finally get to the end of the show you the first person that knows what
I'm talking about. You know, since the seats they used to go straight up in the air and he was sitting
right on top of the ring. But now they've got them situated where you really, you know, it sucks
the good old game anymore. Yeah, you can't see a goddamn thing. You were a million miles away.
All right. Well, God bless the Boston ruins anyway. Okay. Well, I'll need it. Okay. They'll need a
blessing. They're doing okay. They got that famous in us. Okay. That's going to do it. See,
you know, what they want to do? They don't like the message. So let's attack the messenger. Okay.
We can't really, we can't discuss it with you because we don't have the capacity to do that
because it's a very reasonable and logical and rational thing that you're saying. We can't do that.
So instead of that, we'll attack you because we like doing that. And you know what? I couldn't
give a flying craft bless. How do you like that? You like it? Good. I do too. And have a nice
F&D. Oh my God. We got, we got a baseball game. Cutting up. We're just finding to get and
look at that momentum. We got it. We got a call on there. And now we got to get the hell out of
here for our dumb ball game. The Neil Roger show on 560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale.
