Still Rogers got.
To take a spoon of cinnamon
and two or three eggs white.
I have a stick of butter
and a little melted.
Stick it all in a bow baby.
Stirring with a whisk.
Mix in a cup of flour.
You'll be in handy soon.
Say everybody have seen my balls
they're big and salty and brown.
You never need a quick pick me up
just take my balls and you're my
balls.
Ooh, the dough must go.
It's all good balls.
Okay.
Stick it in the mouth and stuff them.
The dough must go.
It's all good balls.
They're fast full of vitamins and good for you.
Just for my balls.
And you get to it.
Oh.
For the couple months we need chocolate.
And a half a cup of brandy.
It's the way I'm either to it sugar.
And just a bit of vanilla.
Breathe out the cookie sheet.
Cause I hate when my balls get.
This three heather I want to treat city.
And give that spoon a lick.
Say everybody have seen my balls
they're big and salty and brown.
You never need a quick pick me up
just take my balls and you're my balls.
They're all my chocolates.
They're all good balls.
You're going to help you get them.
They're all good balls.
They're all my chocolates.
They're all good balls.
They're fast full of goodness.
I ain't fightin' on.
They're all my balls.
Oh, hey.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Hey, wait a minute.
What's got some mail?
They're all like chocolate buns.
Well, I don't know for fun, but
long back in my mind they don't fight.
They've been better get back in the kitchen.
Cause I got a sneaking suspicion.
Oh, man, baby.
Baby, you just burned my bow.
Come with me.
My father was fired.
Let's do this.
The father was burning.
Give it to my father.
Push him right over.
The father was burning.
The father was a circus and he was blowing the phone and he was standing.
Oh, so come and get your chocolates out.
Okay.
For the minute, my son's come.
They'll find me, baby.
The father was a circus and he was blowing my pants.
Oh, so come and get your chocolates out.
I'm gonna make you fall.
Baby, you're gonna make me fall.
I'm gonna make you fall.
Come with me.
Well, you're gonna make me fall.
Four minutes after 10 to 5.
50 WQ.
I'm happy to do it.
Here's the talented Google Young through the card until Ranfield.
Yeah, whatever you say.
So anyway, Jews and Turnell Stripe boils over.
Front page in the hair of this morning.
This is another example of what I'm always talking about.
Another great example, which we'll talk about today.
Let's pick on the Jews today.
Okay.
The Orthodox, the crazy people with the hats and the schmottis and the tiffilin and the smell real bad.
Need a real, real serious dose of something under the right guard, left guard.
Audio net is back on today, by the way.
Back on the audio net for our listeners from coast to coast all over the world.
Finally, we're back on the audio net.
By the way, if anybody needs our program director, Bluff Lindsay, he'll be at the dentist around 12-15 getting a crown put on.
You can beep him right there, right in the head share.
You can beep it.
Hahaha!
Man, is this place a joke?
Is it a joke?
It's hysterical.
It's a panic.
God!
See, I've gone...
You reach the point of ultimate frustration and anger and pissed off.
And then finally, you get beyond it.
It's like hopping over a little fence.
And then you get on the other side and it's just so hysterical.
You can pee in your pants.
So you just have to laugh at it.
Oh, God.
Even he couldn't keep his straight face when he's telling me this morning.
Well, if you guys need me, I'll be at the dentist.
I've got to get my crown.
It's right around the corner, though.
You can beep me if you need me.
If we need you for what?
If we need him for what?
Is there anything tangible that you can think of that this man has accomplished in the 13 months that we've got on this radio station?
Anything?
No.
One thing.
No.
Could you answer a question?
If you asked him like a tough question, like, why don't we be moving in our studio up on the third floor, which I asked him this morning?
Do you have an answer?
No.
What time of day is it?
No.
A little bit too tough.
But at any rate, he's the right nutpin' down that shaft and having a good time, I guess.
You know, it's amazing to me.
Why should it be amazing since I'm a slow learner, I guess, that the things that are so painfully obvious?
I mean, it's like looking through a paint of glass.
It's right there in front of your purse.
And because this is such a dumb, dumb town, people here, they just don't get it.
The sports writers, all these columnists, things that you look at, like, like, there's a dead cow sitting right in your living room.
And you bring in all these people and they look at it and they're like, I don't know, what do you think that is?
Looks like a dead cow to me.
Well, you know, I don't know.
That's Miami-Fore.
That's this town.
Like this thing with Eugene Robinson.
Yes, most of us agree that it's a tremendous waste of police manpower and they've been doing these things on Viscan Boulevard for 100 years with a John's, the decoys and all his bullcrap been going on forever.
Not just here, but here a lot.
But that wasn't the point.
That wasn't the story.
The story is that here's a guy that's always quoting from the Bible that said himself up as the moral leader that just the morning of his arrest received this award.
As being this upstanding great moral, he's the prophet, baby, he be the whatever he is.
And he's out there looking for a blowjob.
I'm just getting Boulevard 9 o'clock, Saturday night.
That's the story.
Not whether it's a waste of police time and taxpayer money, which we, anybody with a brain knows that already.
But do they get it?
No, they don't get it here.
There's that dead cow right there in front of your foot.
It's like two feet in front of your left foot.
There's a dead cow.
But yeah, but you know, I'm not so sure you're right about it.
I don't, I don't see it.
Why are these people so slow?
Just that thing about Lawrence Taylor I was talking about yesterday.
I don't care what the rules of the NFL are.
And you know, it ties right in with that pros and cons book that have been recommending very strongly.
And most of you need to read it badly, by the way.
Most of the people who listen to this station need to be forced to read it or have somebody read it to them.
Because one of the things that they talk about in that book is that the National Football League is very uptight about gambling scandals.
I heard Hank yesterday mentioned that Paul Horning had to wait 20 years to get in all of them because he was in trouble for gambling.
See, gambling reflects on the integrity of the game and brings into question whether the games are on the up and up.
But as far as gangsters, they don't have no problem with that.
Drugs, murderers, rapists.
They have no problem with that at all.
So the question should be, you know, not what the rules are, but what they ought to be as far as induction of the Hall of Fame and how you could put a total scumbag like Lawrence Taylor in there.
That's what people ought to be talking about.
Like OJ.
I mean, if he would have been convicted in the first trial, an equiminal trial for getting about the civil trial, which I guess nobody ever bothered telling the NFL, if he would have been convicted in the criminal trial, he would still be in there.
He would still be in the Hall of Fame.
In that special criminal division behind the bars, he'd still be in there because they don't care.
Just as long as you don't do any illegal gambling and maybe baseball has, you know, like a touch of the same illness.
That's why they're so upset about Pete Rose.
He wasn't the screwing around that they knew of.
He wasn't beaten on any women, but he had a little gambling problem.
Therefore, keep his ass out of the hall.
That's what, see, those are what the real issues are, but don't confuse these people with the facts because they can't see it.
Nine minutes after 10 at 5.60 WQM on a great Tuesday, I think I'll make it a little bit of a comeback, you know what?
I think I'm going to share that cream on my record.
Like what we're going to do today, one of the many things we'll accomplish today is we'll do the illness of the day.
Every day we'll get, no, it's better than go out of the doctor. They don't diagnose anything.
So we'll just make something up. We'll diagnose something different every day and then we'll talk about what the symptoms are.
And a lot of people will be going, oh, I think I got that.
So I'm looking at those medical books.
Every disease you look up, oh yeah, I got that. Oh yeah, there's a lot of that.
And then you go on to the next disease. Oh yeah, no, maybe this is what I got because I got that and I got this.
In my rectum, it's oozing in all kinds of problems.
Oh, that was a retro.
Oh, that was a retro. Well, I'm listening to these stupid carts.
That trace you just brought in here. What are these supposed to be funny? Fat boy brought these over here.
Fat boy stole some carts from Queer Channel, by the way.
I don't want to get them in any hot water when he just started here yesterday.
I don't want to get his ass thrown out of here quite yet. Do I want to get him out of here?
Uh-huh. Oh.
Stole some carts for them that I can tell that we're sitting right on his desk and it's a bunch of terrible rehash.
For those of you who are jones for the a passion phone thing, see if this was like a real open, if it was a show open,
but it's just a music band.
I got that.
Huh? I got that. Yeah, so what's the big deal with that?
I mean, if I had something that related to her on there, like maybe like that or get down on your hand and ease and lick my boots.
Or maybe like like the john really gets my panties and a wide maybe that might have some significance.
So I shop against fat boy, but we didn't we didn't need to bring him over here.
The other parts what speaking of him.
Yes, was a message on my voicemail from Andy Corge, the sales manager over there.
Yes, well, he just left saying.
Oh my god. Andy Corge was saying.
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.
Saying boy, you guys lose.
Yeah, there's something we need to have.
Shylock Holmes investigate this whole deal of how that guy he wound up.
You know, they have this non-compete thing with the sales people that over there, a queer channel.
But somehow he was working there on Friday.
He shows up here on Monday morning as in yesterday.
In spite of that non-compete, I think it's like a six month non-compete or something like that because he threatened to sue them.
Is that what it really?
Well, that's just the story we hear, of course.
Oh, yeah.
So what do you really try to say over that love?
He's an asshole.
Yeah.
Oh, god.
Over there. Love tap that the guy gave him an any started like swooning and passing out and having all these problems because the guy tapped him on the side of the head.
Maybe he was just kind of a problem over there.
And they wanted to ship him over here and of course, he ran being the idiot that she has said, uh-huh.
Okay.
And of course the fact that her husband, well, I guess he separated now, but that doesn't make any difference.
Maybe in fact, maybe that's why maybe that's part of the separation is that Todd Winnick is trying to get even with her now with us.
So therefore they shipped fat boy over here and she said, okay, because she's a knitwit.
And because their general manager is like in La La Land involved in God only, oh is one.
Maybe we can get to God then soccer games on the station and I mean make Phil Shane happy anyway.
We can get the mad at or games on here.
Come on. Let's get some more stupid dumb sports crap on here.
That's what we need.
I'll get to the adieu story in a minute over there in Jerusalem where their psychotic is usually orthodox.
You're just not orthodox enough.
That's the problem you American orthodox.
You're just not Jewish enough to make those crazy Israelis happy.
But anyway, yesterday we had a couple of calls on the show which I thought really showed that after just a what 13 months now on this station were finally graduating.
We finally have reached the level or graduating or is it that we're going in reverse.
We're being held back.
We finally reached the level of the sports show some of them on this station where the callers are like such idiots that were like or I'm talking about the sports calls like that.
But we had two calls yesterday about the Panther Dallas game which I didn't see I was out of town and they lost they got beat they got sock they got pounded they lost the game.
And both of these callers wanted to analyze they wanted to go through this excruciating well how come they lost a game and what did they do and Terry Murray did that and I thought to myself oh my god it's like a disease.
It's contagious it's broken through the membrane walls that exist attended like these little barriers that exist there were 10 o'clock in the morning with the big hand is on the wall whatever it is and at two o'clock in the afternoon there these membranes that are kind of like separated us at least to some degree for the last 13 months.
But I guess maybe February 1st yesterday with the dividing point at which the membrane walls finally like a cave then and some of the started seeping in some of this disease some of this illness from you sick pathetic sports nerd that talk about such minutia and have to take each I mean it's one thing to be a sports fan you know something to enjoy it that's okay.
But it's another thing to take each event and have to analyze and dissect it and sniff it and go through this grotesque this unbelievable exercise because really you don't have to go through all of that to prove one thing what's because if you're if you're doing this we know what you're really trying to say I have no line exactly.
I mean that's a given that's guaranteed if you have to go through this excruciating mental exercise of trying to figure out how come hey guess what when you play a lot of games you're going to lose some oh no is that possible.
There's that sharp pain again in the wrist yeah about two three times today that happens let's diagnose the illness okay it's about seven or eight weeks my doctor says I don't need him and I think I'm starting to agree.
Well no when your doctor says you don't need me I think what he's really trying to say is you need a doctor that might give you a diagnosis and help you get over whatever your problem is.
Is that is that the code for what that means when a doctor says you don't need me.
And my dermatologist that they seem like very nice people give me some of this cream that I'm smear and it seems like this rash is going away very slowly but it does seem to be going away but all these other symptoms this dip neck the sore neck maybe I've got a yeast infection was my guess for the day market on account if they were could they were going to discuss yeast infections all over.
Well my vagina seems fairly clear at this point doesn't seem to be affected by this it's all from the neck up it's all in your head maybe that's what my doctor was trying to say it's all in your head.
You know that hot skin and the stiff neck and the pain behind the eyeballs and the occasional like two or three times a day the real sharp pain in your joint for like a in your wrist for about just one or two seconds like a sharp shooting pain sounds like a yeast infection to me.
Anybody in the audience know anything about a yeast infection no I'm not talking about like individuality now doctor atkins in the book for all my atkins people out there he does make a very interesting point which I used to poo poo a lot anybody out there ever poo poo a lot then when you go on the atkins you stop poo pooing all together.
Well sure I used to make fun of that value says most bad people have yeast infections they don't realize it and most doctors can't diagnose that of course some doctors can't diagnose anything but that's beside the point.
You don't need me you're fine.
So let's talk a little bit about yeast infections today along with all this other stuff and maybe we can analyze how come some maybe your team lost the game recently and we can analyze we can you know hold hands and we can say a prayer over that.
Let me say it again for all you experts who write in this town and on you a journal so called journalist the real story with Eugene Robinson wasn't the fact that he got hot caught with a hooker which nobody with a brain cares even his wife have it only she don't give a crap.
But Jesus cares it's the hypocrisy again it's the same with all this bull crap up there in Washington with all these senators and congressmen that are screwing around screwing everything that moves but are pointing the finger at Bubba and see the difference like the guy that called yesterday the professional right winger the biggest difference is we already knew Bubba was a flanderer nobody cared they elected them anyway including a second time and they still like them they don't care how many blow jobs he gets.
He's not setting himself up as some kind of a religious leader some kind of a moralist he's not winning any goddamn awards as the moral leader of America.
But here's another one of these phoney baloney jocks with a Christian prayer breakfast and all the awards and a moral leader and he's out to get in the head looking for head on biscuit boulevard that's the story.
And isn't it pathetic they have to like draw a diagram for these bastards because they just don't get it you know that dead cow is sitting there in their living room and they just can't see it they can't make how what it is.
Jews and turn ol' strife boils over us rabbis are constantly over mixed sex prayer in Israel.
Hi!
In an ugly confrontation of course when the orthodox get together it's always an ugly confrontation you ever take a look at them they're always ugly.
So that's a good poll question today anybody ever see a good looking orthodox Jew.
No.
What if he shaved him?
I think they'd be a lot uglier look at your accountant for example look at David but all the respect I know you like him and he swindles the government real well or whatever it is he does for you but nevertheless he is truly truly ugly.
Anybody ever see an orthodox Jew that looked like really really good.
No.
In an ugly confrontation 100 orthodoxy a Shiva students surrounded a group of American reform rabbis who went to pray at the western wall on Monday morning in Jerusalem.
The students booed loudly and shouted insults past border police officers.
Oi!
What was most chilling to the Americans was that the youth their faces contorted an anger under their black hats.
Screamed that the rabbis should go back to Germany to be exterminated one explained later.
Drawn to the protest by cars with loudspeakers that circulated in their neighborhood the students jostled and pushed at metal gates that essentially penned in the 33 male and female rabbis.
There nothing but biological Jews said an orthodox member of parliament of Ram Leiserson who went to the pen to yell at the Americans.
Enter the pen.
Most of these bastards ought to be in the pen.
They had there before to spend a week with Sean Penn.
The class with the latest scrimmage and war between the orthodox and the reform and conservative movement which many fundamentalists believed to be such a dilution of Judaism that they're not the same religion.
You think you're Jewish because you put on a kapa or skullcapped yell of my or a crow's?
Crowds?
Sounds like crowd.
You want to do a new religion fine.
Go do it somewhere else and tree-lank or leave us Jerusalem.
What the protesters found particularly provocative was the fact that the men and women were praying together.
Oi!
Which they do not allow.
That the women like the men were skullcaps and prayer shalls.
Oi!
And that a woman on up Hoffman of the Jerusalem City Council held the Torah.
Oi!
Oi!
If a group of rabbis can't go to the wall then who can go ask Rabbi Emil Hirsch, sonny's brother?
Executive director of the association of reformed Zionists of America in New York.
Who does it bother?
Who considers it provocative?
It's only provocative if you succumb to the ultra-orthodox worldview which sees the Western wall and all of Israel as not the heritage of the Jewish people, but as a giant, ultra-orthodox synagogue.
As this big, right-wing, far-bisoner shoul.
The Western wall, the most hallowed Jewish site, is long been a battleground between traditional and less traditional Jews.
The prayer area directly in front of the wall is divided into men's and women's sections as in Orthodox synagogues with a men's section, much larger of course, goes without saying.
Because the women like most religions are like under-hundredlings.
The reforming conservative movements have petitioned the Israel Supreme Court for the right-told mixed services before the wall.
A group called Women of the Wall has sought court-order slated members to read from the Torah and wear prayer shalls there.
Oi!
How do you like that?
Women wearing a tollus?
Oh my God!
Strictly Orthodox leaders have successfully fought all attempts to change the status quo at the wall.
One Orthodox group, Amahad, faxed a statement from New York to condemn the right-before-mabbi's trip as a provocation.
They were trying to say he was an Ojyan provocateur, I think, is what they be saying.
The message from Rabbi Avon Shafran, Aviyah, whatever's name is, said in part,
we asked this morning's American visitors to turn their energies to constructive, not destructive,
and to confront the plagues of assimilation and intermarriage that are raging in their own American communities and allow Israel's Jews to preserve their own relationship with Jewish religion as law and tradition.
And publicize these.
The confrontation boils down to a showdown between Jews over the legitimacy of reform and conservative Judaism, the dominant movement in the United States.
Absolutely correct, sir.
Which are very small here.
The incident also touched another thorny issue which many see as an ownership battle over the Jewish homeland.
Many as really see the Jewish diaspora as vital to their existence, others resent what they see as American meddling.
Diaspora?
How do you pronounce that, George?
Come on, let's cycle it.
Diaspora.
I think that's what I got, diaspora.
Doesn't that tell a kind of a skin-cream diaspora?
I think that might do the job for me.
Let's get some.
The students, Monday, repeatedly shouted for the Americans to go back to the United States, said,
I read by Stacey Offther, Minneapolis, we come with so much love of Zion.
It's very hard to be reminded of how hateful some people feel toward us.
Now these are Orthodox Jews shouting and screaming and condemning and carrying on with other Orthodox Jews.
I rest my case right there, okay?
Oh, crazy people.
Crazy, crazy, crazy people.
Dressed in the garb of people from thousands of years ago, like relics,
walking around with their tallices and their schmokas and their big goofy black hats and their payets and their titsons.
If I can say that, can I say that?
No.
Their titsons, I'll say it again.
If Jim Manage can say it, I'll say it, with their titsons hanging down.
God.
And I'm supposed to be on the outside.
I'm supposed to be the bad guy because I tell you that all this religious crap is a bunch of bull crap.
Just ask the Jews in Brooklyn.
Just ask the less than Orthodox, the less from Jews in Brooklyn, how they like the Orthodox and what they've done to them and stoning their houses and trying to drive them out of the neighborhood because they're not quite Jewish enough.
That's right.
Jews attacking other Jews.
Christian, just like when a pope was here the other day and he was attacking the, he was making a hawk at a trinic in Mexico about the infusion of the born again Christians who aren't quite the same kind of, the same brand of Christians.
It's not good for his business is what he was trying to say.
Even though they're all supposed to believe in Jesus and all those other bubble might see it's not the right brand. Don't you understand it's not the right brand. Your bad for business.
1027 and 550 WQ and holy cow, Aaron's coming.
This time I'm watching the animation.
All the faiths, demos, all the things that don't be stupid.
1335, 650 WQ. I'm happy Tuesday for my Jewish friends here at 5.62. I'm which we have many by the way. Lots of you lost working here and quite frankly, not quite so orthodox as they would like over in Israel.
By the way, haven't we told you many, many times don't ever trust the Israeli businessmen doctors. Anybody Israeli when it comes to business don't trust five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 on a mobile one line. It's curing the disease day.
It's let's hear from the Orthodox Jews day.
Oh God, here's a call from Reno no less. Hello.
Okay, sir.
Long time, Mr. of your son, a little Miami, but you got away from Miami for a superboat. What a crap is going on.
Good move, by the way, excellent move.
So I went to San Francisco now. I'm bringing the kids here like the whole and this is game. Let me tell you something.
What ever happened with this guy getting trouble trying to get a blow job? What happened with that?
What ever happened to move what?
With the guy from the other guy.
You gene.
Yeah.
What do you mean whatever happened? He played a crappy game Sunday night and now he's going home.
Anyway, I pay what in such a small place like like here and not like how in 20 mile radius of this place. There's more living and breathing people.
More fun and.
There's no question about that. This town is dead in Adorniel now that all the intruders the invaders from the Super Bowl are gone yesterday was one of the deadliest days I've had in years.
And I can see already today. I got one other call on the board. It's 1035 already. I can see today's it's going to be just like that again today.
You know what I'm saying?
And with nobody trying to catch you because you want to get a blow job. It's just unbelievable.
You just don't start going to have to fly back to that.
You've got to understand the old like I said before the reason that that was a big story or should have been a big story.
It's not because he was trying to get a blow job is because he's he sets himself up as another one. He's a Bible thumpers. He's the prophet.
He's the prophet. He's the by. He's always quoting from the Bible. He's better than all the rest of us. Don't you understand?
He got the word Saturday morning. He was presented the award at the Christian athletes prayer breakfast.
And then Saturday night he goes out and gets arrested on biscuit and boulevard for getting a call with the decoy hooker.
I love it.
Have a great time, pal.
Okay. 100 brains out.
Two open lines in day two and powered five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 on the mobile one line.
I got news for you. I'm not screwing around today at all. No way. No way Jose.
They want to play the game today. They want to talk. They got something to say. Great.
This is where it's at, baby. Just unleash your attice. You got nothing to say. I got music up the old record.
I got tons of good music today. We'll play the South Park. We'll play the whole damn soundtrack is what we'll do.
Here's a mobile in the crawl springs. Hello. What's up, Neil? Yes, sir. What's going on?
Hello. I'm listening. I'm listening. Are you any good mood today? What? Are you any good? I want to talk to you. Let's call. I was in a great mood. Yeah.
I want to talk around for some figures. Figures for what? I wonder where you got a speeding ticket, Jackass.
Two open lines in powered five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60. See right there for the guy in Reno.
There is one more example while you ought to be real glad that you're where you are out there and not here.
Here's the guy to think he's being real cute real funny. He's got nothing to say. He has nothing to say.
Nothing to say about any goddamn thing in the world.
This is the dead end. There ought to be when you go when you get to the Palm Beach County line.
I'm talking the north Palm Beach County line. There ought to be a big sign that says dead end.
No matter where you want to go, you can't get there from here.
Here's a mobile in Cooper City. Hello. Hi Neil. Good morning. Yes, sir.
Who did you give your tickets to on Saturday nights, Pamper? I didn't give my tickets to anybody.
Are you writing your seats? What? I sat at your two seats. Well great. I'm happy for you. Probably needed both seats.
So you didn't give the tickets away? No, I did not. Well, you didn't use them. Thank you very much. Section 101, row 16.
Right. It was great to be at the Panthers in place. So good. Yeah. Then again Dallas is probably the best in the West.
Okay, have a great day, sir. Have a great life. Oh, God. Nice job by the usher's by the way. Not checking who's sitting in my seats.
Nice job there again by the usher's at the Macarena. I mean, you talk about hopeless and pathetic.
That's the usher's in that joint man. Don't confuse them with the facts. Well, we got to be nice to the customers because yeah, right.
Because if they want to stand up during the game, if they want to run up and down the house or sit in somebody else's seat, that's okay. They're the paying customers.
We have an open line in day one in the Broward 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line.
Here's Miami Beach. Hello. Yes, sir. I was reading that article today in the Harold about the the rabbis.
Oh, yeah, I can't believe it. I mean, I thought they were all Jewish. I'm not Jewish, but I mean, I thought a Jew was just a Jew.
Oh, man, you ain't heard nothing yet. You don't get it. A Jew is just a Jew. There's all kind of Jews. There's conservative Jews.
There's reformed Jews. There's orthodox Jews. There's ultra orthodox Jews. There's culinary dietary Jews who just like to eat deli like I do.
You know, it's not just your everyday generic Jew. Well, I know that you got orthodox and you got regular Jewish people stuff, but they're all Jewish. That's what I'm saying.
No, that's like saying that all people believe in Jesus are Christians. No, that's not true. No, that's not true.
So, the orthodox Jews are trying to do is they have all of them look like them with the beard and the curls and the...
And they want to keep the women in their place. Like most religions, the more orthodox they become, the more sexist they are, they want to keep women way in the back and their barefoot and pregnant.
I'm like in a Jewish trailer park, barefoot and pregnant. Right, exactly. They're living in the stone age, my friend. They're living in the dark ages, so tell them.
That's like the death penalty. They're storming the people with that. Take a pride. Right, that's right. Now you're talking. Now you're getting warm. They're standing there at the wailing wall and they're rocking back and forth. They're not even playing the Gary Glitter and they're still rocking back and forth.
Oh, I'm a real hodon. And they're carrying on. Seriously, I like to get seen by this dance in their pants. Like crazy people in the art.
Oh, man. Hey, can I also want to do some? Go ahead, sir.
Chris Bush, you're an asshole. Okay. There's a guy that's not too happy with Bush. We have an open line in day two and power. Boy, this overhead is like all screwed around.
You know, Gregory with a great sense of humor that he's got who's got the audacity to actually come down here. Look me in the face. And by the way, did our program director ever get those numbers that I asked him to run for me off the like it was a big project.
Did he bring those down? No, 10 to two numbers. Now that he's up there with his computer before we go to have the crown stuck in his place or anything else putting his mouth.
Did he do that for us this morning? No, but you know, that would require a little bit of effort on his part, not in his vocabulary, not in his job description.
Yeah, Greg Reed says on that board we got upstairs in that studio. All it the engineer tells him it's like state of the art. It's only a couple of years old.
And I said, yeah, I said we don't even have a thumbtack in this joint that state of the art.
For back radio.
And all back to chicken jeopardy on your home.
Alex for me. We move on that to double jeopardy.
Any you have the low score at the end of the last round choose a category please extra terrestrial for 200.
It makes strange noises in the chicken coop late at night. Yes, bonus.
Like Purdue, no. Cajun. No, what is a poultry guy?
Okay, got any new spill had control of the board to be or not to be for 600.
He was the star of the Omen.
Oneless.
We'll return the vital chicken.
We'll be choking the packer.
One thing I did learn on it, too, by the way, can't keep a packer in his pants.
You know, but can't keep a packer in his pants.
And if her condoms, she's getting all worked up in the foaming at it in the mouth, too.
We have an open line of day one and powered five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 anybody called you about the disease.
The yeast infection. No.
Where can we find in South Florida? This is my question today. Where can we find somebody who can a diagnosed an illness, even like a migraine headache would be a good start.
And the do something to get rid of it.
Wouldn't that be what a concept, huh?
Is there such a person in this town? Is he exist? No.
Here's a lady in Perrine. Hello.
I'm yellow. Yes, ma'am.
I hate to make this all Eugene radio again today, but I must tell you the hero got it wrong.
That picture of Eugene in his wife was taken Saturday.
Oh, and they made it sound like it was.
Yeah, it said it was taken this morning, meaning yesterday morning, the day after he was arrested.
Exactly.
He had a big smile on their post and I wonder what what that would this be?
Right.
But what?
But you have to understand that since the picture was taken Saturday, it proves conclusively that she was here on Saturday.
The day that he went out the cruise in the mind of biscuit and what are looking for a blowjob.
Exactly. I think what they do that night before the Super Bowl, the families are taken are the players are moved to a different hotel away from the family.
They probably moved him in the army. That's a good neighborhood.
You know, biscuit and biscuits.
The players were on their own that night.
Yeah.
But anyway, the implication that she didn't take it bad, I mean, they had his father on it.
She was terribly upset.
So, you know, I hate to think that, you know, everybody's thinking of that.
You know, I mean, they've been hereled made another mistake.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Another herald mistake.
Another big, big, big mistake.
Yeah, but big mistake.
Because it makes it seem like she's from Bimbo that doesn't care.
Right.
I mean, they were going Congress.
I mean, they both had this big smile on her face.
Oh, no.
Like they just won a lottery for 10 million.
I thought it was shocking.
And then I saw the same throw and CNN says Saturday.
Yeah. The herald just absolutely blows.
Isn't this embarrassing that we have to be humiliated by too such garbage newspapers they hurled being by far the worst?
Very well.
I love you, Neil.
Thanks for the bad news.
Bye.
Once again, stretching tear into hearts of real journalists from coast to coast.
The herald with this phony, baloney image that they've created.
She has another one of those mine things I keep telling you about.
It's a mine fork.
That's what it is.
Like the forge.
Same thing.
Oh, it's one of America's great newspapers.
Oh, my God.
You hit me.
You have to be out of your mind.
They make more mistakes in one day than most of those papers making 40 years.
Any section, pick up any section today.
You'll find mistake after mistake, error after error, wrong names on pictures, captions.
I mean, you name it.
They got it.
Cool.
Here's a mobile in for Lauderdale.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you doing today?
Okay.
Listen, though, I don't know if you noticed lately, but Jerry Falwell just pronounced that the antichrist will be Jewish.
Yes, sir. That's an old story.
That's her last week.
I haven't noticed lately, but I didn't notice last week when the story was on.
I did talk about it, yes.
Well, I tried to call you all week.
Oh, I finally got three minutes to talk about it.
Well, what do you mean you tried to call me all week?
Then you should know that I talked about it.
I dial and I dial and I dial.
Oh, get out of here.
These phones, yesterday, were dead as a door nail.
Well, I didn't try yet.
You could have driven a Mac truck through this phone bank yesterday.
Well, you know what it made me think, that'll do.
What did it make you think, sir?
Maybe you're the antichrist.
Yeah.
I'm not Jewish enough.
You're not?
No.
I thought it would be great to kind of have a campaign.
Go AC.
Yeah.
How about go AC DC?
We have an open line in Broward, two of them, five, six, seven, oh five, six, six, these.
See what I mean?
Was he exciting or what?
He was pretty, no, you're right.
Five, six, seven, oh five, six, the pound five, six, the, on the mobile one line.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Great.
You know, I was out this weekend, the cops weren't only after the Johns this weekend.
They had speed traps all over town.
I was driving up eight seven four.
By the way, big speed trap on.
How you this road again between sunrise and Broward?
I don't know if it's still going on.
They're right there shooting it on their motorcycle.
Go ahead.
Check this out.
I was driving up eight seventy four northbound.
And I see a whole line of cop cars.
You know, they had the speed traps and go over the airplane, flies all over.
Yeah.
They were, you know, I'm driving northbound and I'm warning the guys, you know, I'm flashing my headlights on and off.
And about five minutes later, I see this on my car, pull me over.
And the guy was going to give me a ticket for flashing my headlights to warn the other motorist.
He gave me a bunch of.
I'm glad you brought this up.
You must be psychic because I was thinking about that this morning because as I came down hiatus road,
there were people flashing me their headlights warning.
Warning that there was this speed trap up there on hiatus, which they're there almost every goddamn day.
And I'm thinking of myself, this is your first amendment, right?
You're communicating with the other motorist out there.
And if you want to send them a message that's your first amendment, right?
And if the cop doesn't like it, tough bananas, too bad.
Well, this guy was, I mean, he started giving me the third degree.
And I told him, listen, all I'm doing is that I'm saving you.
You got trouble down the road and he's going, oh, you're obstructing this and the other one.
And he pulled out this.
Ah, but that goes to show you what a bunch of liars they are because they're not there trying to fill out code
and write a bunch of tickets.
If they're really trying to get people to slow down, then you're right.
You're assisting. You're helping because you're helping a slow traffic down.
Exactly. Well, he gives me all of this. Well, you know, the people will be mad if they see us in the, uh,
at the Dunkin' Donuts seating. So we're out here doing our job and you're, you're, you're intruding in our, uh,
So in other words, what are you saying? What are you saying is that they're only two alternatives,
eating at Dunkin' Donuts or running radar traps.
And there's no other police work that needs to be done in this town.
Is that what you're saying, sir?
Exactly. That's exactly not. He was fumbling through his rule book. He said, well, this is a, this is in the line.
The rules, this is a law. And, uh, you know,
yeah, I'm believe, I'm believe where's your Friday when we need him?
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, you gotta get the volume up on this on your, uh, on your,
Oh, I'm glad you mentioned that again too. Thank God for you. Thank you, sir.
And have a great day. See, there we go again.
Get the volume up on the list about it.
So he's gonna look into it. Who's gonna look into it?
When.
When. What year? You know, I'm so sick and tired of hearing about what a great engineer we got.
And I know how overworked he is, but you know something.
that we are on the air.
We're doing a radio show.
What comes, what goes on the air comes first.
All the other window dressing, all the other
pot skiing around upstairs with stuff that can wait.
That comes last.
That comes later on down the road.
And our engineering department as small as it is
and as overworked as it is, what they don't understand is
that we would like to do things right down here.
Even though that may be a pain in the ass to them,
we'd like the listeners to be able to hear us
when they're on hold.
I know that's asking for a lot.
And it's something that takes maybe two minutes of their time
to do that, to make that adjustment.
But we get the short end of the stick.
We've seen the program director this morning.
We saw the general manager down here this morning
with his usual look on his face.
And that's it.
And in the meantime, we get the short end of the stick.
We're sitting here with a goddamn 10 share
between 10 and 2.
We're bringing in more goddamn money than Carter's got pills.
And we still get nothing.
We get absolutely nothing from these people.
And the audience calls in day after day after day after day
and you'll hold your breath.
When is somebody up there going to do something about this?
As opposed to have a program director that runs around
giving us his schedule of where he's going to be
and how he can get a hold of him and we can beep him.
What do we want to beep him for?
Because if you tell him about any of these things,
all he says is, like that.
What's the point?
It's an exercise.
It's an exercise in total futility is what it is.
Because when you cut away all the extraneous horsemen
or they just don't give up crap, that's all.
They won't lift a finger for us.
Nothing.
We had a threaten to take him to court
just to build this goddamn studio
in a to damn good thing for them.
And they built a studio because otherwise they would have
no place to have the other, the whole station running out
of during the week that they were trying to oppress
the NFL people with a Super Bowl last week.
So it's a goddamn good thing that we did force them
and threatened to have to take them to court
to build these studios.
Don't confuse them with what they promised
or with what they're supposed to do
because they don't know from nothing.
You can't do business with these people.
They can't do business.
Everything is a joke.
Everything is small talk.
Everything is, but if you bring up anything like the thing
with a sales situation that we talked about
with what's its name?
They just look at you like, oh really?
And it just keeps scratching that spot on the empty spot
there in a head where a brain used to be.
Maybe.
Here's Virginia key. Hello.
Hey, Nail.
Yes, sir.
Can you hear me, all right?
I hear you.
How about when you were on hold, sir?
Could you hear us okay?
No, when I was on hold, it was worse.
Better now.
But was there where you much clearer now?
The volume was low.
Yes, when I was on hold.
Yeah, that's our problem.
That's our problem, George Carso.
The volume is low and the colors are on hold.
You idiot.
Any help, sir?
I only told him yesterday afternoon.
Yeah, right.
That other color who called it.
Late afternoon.
The other color who called about,
you know, the Jews talking about this with days.
Yes, sir.
You know, it's, it's, it's,
the Jews shouldn't be any different than,
look at the Muslims.
Oh, hey.
They've got so many different sex of Muslims.
It's like the American Muslims.
Muslims are having sex.
Uh-oh.
Yeah, they have the Elijah's sect in America,
which is a black Muslims, you know,
and it's like religion is all based on business.
It's like, as soon as somebody
found that kind of NBA, that old black magic.
Yeah, there you go.
They used to be in the NBA and used to be on TV
and used to be, you know, some.
Exactly.
You know, as you can found a new religion,
you know, you, you, you've made your million.
I mean, when you've got people within their own religion,
even though they may be in different sects of the religion.
Right.
And you've got people hating each other
and condemning each other and screaming
and go back to Germany to be exterminated
and all of this other crap.
Doesn't that write there?
Doesn't that demonstrate very clearly
and beyond the shadow of a doubt
that religion reads nothing but hatred and contempt
and has all throughout human history?
That's right.
If you don't see it the way I see it,
you know, the hell with you.
Exactly.
You're going to burn in hell and drop dead
and, uh, et cetera, and so on.
And speaking of it.
And your senses aren't the same shape as mine are,
then, uh, you're going to burn in hell.
And speaking of that, you played a great bit yesterday.
I think you did it ad hoc.
You played the power for Christ compels you with a bunch of...
Yeah.
Did you play that again?
Would you get a chance?
No.
Oh, well, I'll work on it.
Thanks.
Have a great time.
Two open lines in day two and power.
Maybe you'll be able to hear us one more.
You're on hold, maybe not.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hello, me.
Yes.
How are you doing today, Neil?
I'm OK.
The level on the volume on hold is a lot better today than it was.
I called you two days ago or not Sunday.
Well, I only still must be fairly crappy, though,
because we got people complaining about it.
Yeah, I guess.
But it's not too bad for me, actually.
I wasn't talking about a little bit of religion, Neil.
I called you about two months ago.
And I was all, uh, I was saying, uh, born again this and that.
And I tell you what's been happening lately.
Well, he said, bull crap.
And you know, it's how I laid that over there very nicely and almost covered up the shot,
but not quite.
You cover up the shot.
OK, one call left on the board.
It's going to be time for some very, very outstanding music, I think when we come back
from the break after 11 o'clock, some really good stuff.
Next week, boys.
It's 1057.
Our number, by the way, just in case there's anybody out there with anything to say about
anything in the world is 5, 6, 7, 05, 60 and pound 5, 60 on the 18th.
You wireless line.
Oh, god, Neil.
So you have a baby, so you probably have sex.
And now everything's a little disheveled down there.
And although you don't miss sex just yet, you will.
And when the urge comes, you want to be ready.
So you can try all the kegilexercises you want or you can try the brand new product from
the makers of Shrinky Dinks called Stretchy Spray.
Each night before you go to bed, spray Stretchy Spray on your most private of privates and
apply the special heat pad.
The Stretchy Spray adheres to your skin and just like Shrinky Dinks, after a while, the heat
will compress everything back to a smaller, tighter shape.
Warning, overuse of Stretchy Spray could result in...
What the...
It doesn't fit.
Excessive tightness.
He's only as directed.
It's 11-01 and 5-60 WQM, another chromatose crowd out there.
Today we got one call on the board and then I'll read all these numbers.
That fat boy Jeff Hyde brought us down.
Funny is a good guy.
No, he's not a good guy, but he's just useful at getting stuff like this.
While our program director is up there going, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
going up and down the shaft, which he's got a lot of practice doing for motor understand.
What is up there going, boom, boom, boom, boom, like that.
Jeff Hyde sends down here.
All of the stuff from 10 to 2, all the tap scan ratings between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. which
is last time I checked.
Those are the four hours we're on here and that's what we want to know every time the
book comes out.
How do you like that?
So you may knock him this, do I think you own an apology?
No.
I think you own a big fat, disgusting smelly apology.
No.
Yes, I do.
Okay, let's take our one call.
Here's a mobile impompano.
Hello?
Hey, what's up, Neil?
How you doing, sir?
You know, when I heard that thing, it did Atlanta player.
I'm like, wait a second.
Who's in charge of this thing?
It's tourism.
Okay?
When the super volesent town, that's the time you close your conversation.
So I don't understand.
Don't you understand the real story here when you say to that Atlanta player to the self-proclaimed
religionist, Bible, fumping, Bible, quoting goody tooshos who won the award for being a great
moral example on Saturday morning and goes out with his wife and a host sitting in a
hotel sitting on a rash back there and is looking for a blowjob on this game Boulevard
and the point in the story you're getting about is bad for tourism.
Yeah!
Not the story.
That's it.
Okay, granted.
His religious beliefs, whatever.
Okay?
No, no, no, not whatever.
Not whatever.
Let me say it again Saturday morning.
See, why is it so difficult for you people to understand this?
Don't you understand what the word hypocrite is all about?
Okay, he's a hypocrite.
But I don't think we should be out there trolling for guys.
Sure, we're doing it every day.
That's the South Florida f-ing way.
You better get used to it.
Okay, that's the number one.
In fact, they do that every time there's a convention in town, they do that all over
the place.
You name the place.
And here's another guy who doesn't understand the story.
He doesn't want to get it.
That's the more they scream and holler about how religious they are and how they're condemning
everybody else for doing this and that and the other.
They're the ones who are doing it.
Not a single call on the board here.
It's 1103 and I'm sitting here looking at these numbers.
You know what I can do with these numbers like that old lady used to say I can...
That's right.
With all these big numbers we got.
We got these gigantic ratings.
Can we get anybody in management and engineering upstairs to do one little goddamn thing for
us?
No.
It's like we're...
And I'm not even stepchildren anymore.
It's like we don't exist.
It's like we don't even exist.
And Jeff High who is the greatest at getting these numbers he doesn't do too much else
that we want him to do but nevertheless.
And by the way Mr. Smarley-Pantz I know everything who's always telling me about how all
the Julios listen to this show.
What have I told you?
These numbers that we got in this last book which were pretty damn impressive.
I noticed by the way our two newspapers don't write about radio ratings anymore.
Thank you very much.
I don't want to know if they write about the money I raised for charity which I'm used
to buy now.
But they also don't write about the ratings when they come up because I guess they figured
nobody cares.
Sure they don't care.
Hispanic men 2554 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. George.
Number four.
What's the share?
I don't see the average range.
Where the hell is the share?
This doesn't even have a goddamn share.
It has average rating but it doesn't have the share.
This is a crappy piece that you brought us to Fat Boy.
Number four.
I'm radio on more in WXDJ in power 96 with the 1.6% rate.
I don't know what share that would translate to.
It means nothing.
But we're not doing so great.
That's 2554 Hispanic men.
Week.
Week.
We exactly week.
So we're getting these big numbers in spite of them not because like I said before that's
to that thing.
That was one average book that we got over their attacks in the fall two years ago.
It was an aberration.
And you deluded yourself.
Oh, they're all listening.
They're all listening.
They're all listening.
You're always telling me you don't know any Cubans.
Just a family.
Yeah, just your family.
How many people is that eight?
100.
Yeah, right.
They do multiply like crazy like rabbits.
Not like the dark folks.
Oh, and then the dark Cubans.
Wow.
Wow.
So anyway, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
I mean, every, every number.
He's got graphs here.
He's got charts.
Night going fat boy.
We still want to see it though.
But look at this.
Men 25 to 18 to 49.
Number one with a 9.2 share.
Look at all the good.
It does me.
Okay.
I said or talked to myself every day.
Men 25 to 54.
Number one with a 9.7 share.
Let's miss the 10, by the way.
So I take that back.
We didn't make it 10.
9.7.
Sorry.
Men 35 to 64.
10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Number one with a 10.5 share.
Number two is love with a 5.3.
We got double the next stage.
And that demographic.
Here's adults 25 to 54.
Number three in the market with a 6.5.
We have a 10th of a point behind Hot 105.
And a little bit behind the life, which is elevator music.
At adults 35 to 64, that's men and women.
Number one with a 6.6 share.
Out between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.
And two bad.
We don't have TV.
Too bad for just two minutes.
We don't have that whammy crap back in.
Because here's the graphs that fat boy.
Look at that.
Nice job, fat boy.
Look at that graph.
Look at the dramatic difference.
There's those four hours that jump right off the goddamn page.
Even though we don't count down here,
because we're not a jockstrap show,
because we're not talking about, you know, the, uh,
the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, Davis and how butch he is.
And about how they're recruiting from, uh,
from some high school in, uh, Lima, Ohio.
Or is it thinly Ohio, the home of Joe Mars, junior?
Maybe that's where the recruiting from this coming year.
You talk about narrow casting.
You talk about a neurosis.
That's what these people suffer from.
Not too unlike Mickey Mantle.
They suffer from the roses of the liver.
From too many tailgate parties.
And having no life.
From being obsessed with something that ought to be something
you're interested in, but not a life.
It's not a substitute for a life.
Now the Toronto Maple Leafs, yes, that is a life.
That's a whole different, uh, that's a different category.
That's not sports.
That's a whole different category that most of you
could never understand.
But nevertheless, they'll be here tomorrow night, by the way.
Kickin' ass.
Let's see, men 25 to 54.
I do, do I dare read these?
Because I know we got some people in the morning show.
I don't want to mention D.Fo with birithin.
Skinny gets very insecure.
I can't imagine why anybody in this business
would be insecure or paranoid.
Can you?
Yes.
Between 9 and 10 a.m., men 25 to 54
that's our target demo.
They've got a four point here, okay?
Our four hours here, we've got a 9.3,
a 10.1, a 9.9, and a 9.5.
At two o'clock, that goes to a 6.2.
Which isn't bad, by the way.
Not bad.
Not shot liver.
At least not the kind you get at the arascaline.
By the way, I didn't realize that was one of Hank's sponsors,
the arascal house.
I love the arascal house.
Well, no, I don't want to be knock in a place
if I know what somebody else's sponsor.
I heard him talking about that yesterday.
I didn't realize that.
Man.
What, why are you laughing?
Do you know that?
I never knock any other place
if it's somebody else's sponsor.
I do, name me one.
Besides that two place, name me one.
Then I've never knocked.
See, I'm starting to get that infection in here again.
Eeeh!
God!
I'm telling you, there's something in this room
and you people keep laughing at me and laugh at me.
Eeeh!
Gagging on it.
There's a fungus among us,
and it's right in this goddamn room.
And that cheap prick upstairs, Greg Reed.
He's running around talking about crap.
He brings me a story down here this morning.
It's just crap.
Pure $1,000, oh, don't talk about it.
Okay, fine.
I wouldn't waste my time talking about it
because nobody cares.
I don't care.
He's an overgrown wannabe jock.
You're absolutely correct about that, George.
He's an overgrown...
You're in the middle of those things.
wannabe. Yes, you did.
You said he's like a frustrated
to jock a sports wannabe is what he is.
That's what you said.
You didn't say that?
I said he's a sports guy.
That's what I said.
No, you did not say that.
You said he's a jackass.
You said he's a sports jackhole.
He's like a fat rat.
No, he's not.
You already got that bonus money.
You don't have to talk around now.
You got the contract.
George said he's an asshole.
Yeah.
I haven't got my bonus for this ring.
Oh, well, let's see.
It's February 2nd.
I give it a few months.
I give it till about November.
What's dormant feeling?
What's dormant's up and around?
It's being a lot stronger.
You don't have to make a few calls.
By the way, we're getting some money from whammy.
Oh, gee, we can't believe you were suing us.
Yeah, we were suing you, okay?
Since you always the money.
You goofballs.
I'll get back to those numbers in that graph in a moment.
How do you like that?
The way that we stand out here because I hate to break the news to you.
We're not doing narrow casting on this show.
We talk about all kinds of fun on this show.
Not just about some quarterback that's eight years old
as playing at the candidate when New York candidate
will academy high school that might play for the dolphins in 20 years.
We're not talking about that.
Narosis of the liver.
That's what they suffer from these sports nerds.
Don't ever forget it.
They're obsessed with what their lives are.
Their brains have turned up.
I know that the Lord even loves neo-rodgers.
The most controversial movie of our time,
Martin Sports says he's the last temptation of thought.
Recently, he became available for home viewing on cassette.
Religious groups, mid to the release of a film theatrically,
became outraged on the event of its home distribution.
And so, for your spiritual education,
and for those who don't have VCRs on a Christbook movie ticket,
we are proud to present, live,
part one, the radio version of Martin Sports says he's the last temptation of Christ.
Oh, ah!
What?
Want to buy a hot stereo?
Ah, ah, gee, I better not.
Okay.
Ah!
Oh!
It is so the controversial continued.
Two names are modeled from Martin Sports say he's the second last temptation of Christ.
Good day.
Good day.
Docton 15th, good day at 560WQM.
And doct 18 plus, I know that these are boring these numbers,
but it makes me feel better about my life.
Okay, it makes me feel that I may actually have somebody listening out there.
Because one book, all by itself, doesn't mean that much,
because the research is bogus at best.
But over a period of time, over 600 years,
like I've been on here in this market,
it tends to start developing a pattern.
Like adults, 18 plus, which is the entire listening audience,
except for little punky kids which don't count.
9 to 10 am, we got a 2.4 share.
During these four hours, we got a 5.6, a 5.9, a 5.4, a 5.3,
which are two o'clock turns to a 2.4.
So if you take the 9 to 10 hour and the 2 to 3 hour,
and you put them together, that's a 4.8,
we still beat that by plenty in any one of the hours.
How do you like that, huh?
Ow!
And what about that many team plus?
Man, this is a, this is a sports station, okay?
This is supposed to be the magnet, the magnet for all those men out there,
those jocks nippers.
The sports shows that the one that should have the big numbers in men, right?
Yes.
9 to 10 am, they got a 3.9% in many team plus.
We start with a 9.3 share.
9.1, a 3, 8.0.
That's 1 o'clock, which is 2 o'clock,
drops to a 4.5.
So if you take the 9 to 10 hour and add it to the 2 to 3 hour, that's 8.4,
which in two of the hours we beat the 2 and put together.
And on and on it goes, which I don't want to read them all,
because maybe they'll embarrass some people,
but nevertheless, I mean, I understand they're doing, you know,
they're doing their thing, they're bringing in plenty of money.
The only thing I'm saying is that you get really tired of feeling like the stepchild,
like where the outsider is here, when we're the magnet baby,
we're the big gigantic fat oozing, six-thinking magnet on his goddamn radio station.
And we can't get this program director or this engineer or this general manager
or this sales, whoever the hell the sales manager of the week is,
to do anything for this show.
They come down here and they make small talk.
They come down here and a program director tells us he's going off to the bar
for the afternoon to see if the crew is a little bit, whatever he's doing.
I don't know what he's doing.
Not much, I guess.
Here's Coral Springs, hello.
How you doing, Neil?
Great.
I had to wake up from the morning and just left my head off
at Eugene Robertson's play, being such a hypocrite.
Yeah.
Just make your job a whole lot easier having jokes like this and...
These people don't get it, they don't want to get the story,
they pretend they don't understand it.
To them, the big story in this town is that we got things out there
with the decoy cops, like that, something new, like that.
How about the other 24 guys that got busted?
Nobody seems to care about them.
Oh, no, I just love those.
I could use a Bible Fubbing.
That's something that's a great...
And I'll bet you the other 24 guys weren't about your Bible Fumphers.
I bet you none of them got any awards Saturday morning for being the great Christian
more leaders that he supposedly is.
Oh, it was beautiful.
This is funny.
It's not so easy.
What is it?
We'll be fit for Christmas in the year.
Yes, it does, sir.
And God bless you for appointing that out.
We have an open line in Broward to and day.
They're pretty weak today.
Man, they got the cats got their tongue.
Even the Jews out there.
They're going, you know, oh, that's one thing about us Jews.
We always want to hide our head, bury our head in the sand, and pretend, oh, you know,
we got so many problems already.
We've been so oppressed.
Let's not, you know, let's not air our dirty laundry in public.
Right.
Any reasonable Jew ought to be psychotic over this behavior of the so-called,
the self-styled Orthodox Jews over there in Israel, who are wishing the Orthodox Jews
from America who aren't hysterical and stone age enough to suit them, wishing they should only
go to Germany and find a seat they can find an oven they can hop in before it's too late.
Nice.
Here's a lady in Miami.
Hello?
Yes, ma'am.
Hi.
I'm calling Miami.
I was just calling about this thing to stop.
And I don't have a football player.
I just find it totally outrageous, but I'm so happy that he got found out.
Yeah.
Because I mean, how are you coming around, you know, telling everybody you're all moral in looking for a flow?
Can you like Henry Hyde?
In the Bob Livingston and Bob Barr and Newt King Rich.
You mean people like that?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
And looking for a blue child on this cable.
Number one, how does he know?
While his wife is down a street away in a hotel sitting there cooling her heels or maybe drinking a,
whatever else she's, you know, with the kids.
A slow gin phase.
With the kids.
Right.
With his two kids.
And number one, how do you tell them how to find this?
He's not even fond of Miami.
You know, so they need me if he had to go ask around.
Probably is probably somebody in the hotel who didn't like him told him to go over there.
He's an idiot.
Probably somebody who was a, a Bronco fan told him.
Did he not think he was not going to get caught?
Evidently.
Oh, he's an idiot.
He's a jackass and a hypocrite and a piece of turd.
And I'm so happy you got found out.
And have a great day.
And then Dan Reaves, they show yesterday doing the dirty brewery.
You know, they're having their big celebration in Atlanta, welcoming home to losers.
You know, but they had a big year in here.
Dan Reaves, you know, his heart still on one piece.
And he's doing the dirty brewery.
And you know, something everybody in America is looking at it and they're saying,
he's an asshole.
Yeah.
I hate to break the news to you, Danny Boy.
White guys don't do the dirty brewery.
That's a shwo thing, okay?
White guys don't do the dirty brewery.
That's an embarrassing look we talked about that week ago, okay?
It's pathetic.
But for a white guy to be out there doing the dirty brewery.
Man.
You turd rhymes with.
We got open lines in date, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Any advice on this yeast infection thing today so far?
No.
Anybody on that?
Anybody out there can diagnose an ailment that's been a lingering no.
No.
Any doctors out there that might want to take a chance, just maybe like an educated guest.
No.
Here's Hollywood.
Hello.
Hey, Neil, how are you?
Okay, sir.
You know, for someone who has got the greatest ratings of all of South Florida,
why are you so miserable about it?
Misurable about what?
You're just a miserable, you know, you have great ratings, you agree?
Let me ask you this, okay?
Because you sound very, you sound miserable.
You sound very unhappy.
Why do you listen to this show?
If I, you know I listen to the show, Neil.
How is that?
What, that's beside the point.
No, no, how is that that I know?
Is this this Mitch at?
Which, which asshole is this?
It's not Mitch.
Which, which one of the professional assholes is this?
What's the difference?
Yeah, yeah.
What's the difference?
Is it another professional asshole?
But no life.
That's the difference.
And since you all starting to sound the same, what, what difference is the mism?

hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Pasty, look they got, you know? Yeah, they sure do Really look pasty Between that and just slowing the Guinness Now that might do it Yeah, let me get a mic you a little flush like I got you know in my voice I'm glad this Super Bowl is overboying about the high speed already If by the way the lowest watched it was the second lowest rating for a Super Bowl game in US history only 1972 had a smaller percentage of US homes watching You know when I heard about Eugene Robinson, I mean the guy's such a loser I heard his story last week Yeah
A friend of a friend works for a catering company. She's working a party at a star aisle and heard they were gonna be big stars there and Arnold Schwarzenegger and everything
Winds up it was a Denver Bronco orgy. Uh-huh. She claimed that L.A. was having sex at her feet. He was having sex with her feet? At her feet? At her feet? With her feet, yeah. Yeah, but maybe just did a little score at honor feet.
And I'll tell you this whole thing that the hype that's with the Super Bowl in this pan it just shows you I mean there's nothing else going on here. Yeah, and now that it's all gone, you know
They want a painting they painted lines and I was very wrote and I'm coming to work this morning and I'm asking myself why did they waste the time? Everybody's gone now, you know?
Yeah, I mean with the lines were fine before the way they were they were too bad you could actually make them out if you look real close.
Anyways, maybe the Irish know a thing or two about like is that might be it. Yeah, okay. Happy poor and bacteria.
Oh, and by the way, speaking of cocaine, you know, that really bothered me that called yesterday because the guy sounded it. See, when I get a goofball, never bothers me because a goofball is a goofball.
But when somebody comes on the earth, he sounds like articulate and like he's got his head screwed on straight. You know the one I'm talking about?
And then he started that business about what you know somebody of your persuasion, you really have to be careful because you know the religious right as though I based my opinions about issues in life based on what somebody else does, you know?
I don't give a crap about the religious right what they think about this or whether because they're all crazy anyway.
But the idea that all of a sudden I better watch my opinions about drugs because they might like that.
Like I'm some kind of a supporter of drugs.
Let me say it again, sir. Cocaine is bad bad crap and those of you who are doing it, which I guarantee we've got plenty of people in this audience who are doing a few lines right now, by the way, you're dealing with serious.
Say, I know this comes as a great shock, Virginia, but nobody goes out and robs a 7-11 store holds up a liquor store kills anybody because they need money to buy marijuana or hash.
Huh? I know, sir, I know that comes as a tremendous shock, especially if you've been exposed to this refer madness that's so prevalent in this country.
But people who are hooked on that white powder and especially people that are hooked on that crack cocaine on those rocks.
They have this predilection of going out there and becoming all consumed and obsessed with getting it. If they don't have the money to get it, then they find a way to get the money with which to get it.
You follow what I'm saying? I think you do.
So you people out there that think that cocaine is, you know, his comment about recreational drugs. You know, he was just using recreational drugs and LT, whatever we're talking about.
Recreational, my ass. I don't give a crap what you're doing if it doesn't affect anybody else.
But there are a hell of a lot of people. There are millions of people in this country who are doing cocaine. Just ask Robert Downey Jr.
How is he doing in your favorite Christian Slater? That's scumbag. That piece of walking turd.
So we're not just talking about people in the ghetto. We're talking about a lot of people that have too much money and don't know what to do with it.
Like my old friend Johnny Depp, who's here to do a real scumbag over there, got busted again in London yesterday for acting up.
Wonder how River Penis is doing by the way. Johnny's nightclub. Anybody seen him lately? No.
So the idea that because you're liberal because you're, you know, against these idiotic archaic marijuana law.
And suddenly that makes you into some kind of an embraceer of drugs.
Sir, you need serious help. You need serious assistance.
Here's a mobile in Boca. Hello.
This is my take on the Eugene Robinson thing. Anybody who frequents these areas of prostitution knows that any one of those girls down that area, they look good.
Stay away if they cop. If they will.
But on that point, I mean, how would he know he do not be living here? You understand?
That's the take somebody should tip them off. They just, if they, I'm telling those cops, they look too good.
You can go for the ones that are under a hundred pounds.
Thank you.
And the ones that are under a hundred pounds probably, you probably, they'll give you something for at no charge.
We have an open line at date to an empowered five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I go Roger. I just want to go back to how you doing Rogers.
Yeah, I do.
Rogers. You call people by their last name, sir.
Yes, sir.
How about Mr. Rogers to you, sir?
All right, Mr. Rogers.
Yes.
I just wanted to go to the tragedy during your show.
And are you complain about women earlier? You know how they complain and all that?
But you complain a lot more.
About women are complaining when did I say that?
Yeah, you complain about women that they're always bitching.
No, I did not. I never said that, sir.
You must be having, are you having hot flashes? Is that what it is, sir? You're hallucinating.
No, no. I was hearing earlier.
No, you know, sir. I never said anything about women complaining.
I was talking about the only time I even mentioned women today was about the fact that women are being discriminated against by the orthodox Jews in Israel.
They want to keep them out. That's the only time I even mentioned anything about women as they clans of people, sir.
Do you understand that? Do you have a grasp on that?
Yeah, but that's no problem.
Yeah, but that's what?
That's no problem.
So what does that have to do with the price of peanuts? Okay, sir?
Go give Ileana Ross-Latin and a big kiss on the pulse, okay?
We have two open lines in date.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60.
See what he's really trying to say?
What he's really trying to get?
Metacon, Metacon, Metacon. You are the biggest one note, Charlie's, I have ever seen in my life.
You little Julio's you. That's all you know, man. That's all you know.
And I understand when you're obsessed when you have all these guilt feelings about your own natural sex impulses. I understand that.
That you have to take it out on somebody else.
Because that's the diversionary tactic. It's always the one. You know, the closet one.
Just like a Bob Livingston and Bob Bar, always the one with a skeleton to their closet, who's the first to scream the loudest, ah, pervert, yeah.
And how many families you break in up lately? How many broads you screw in and Bob Livingston, by the way, we never really got a number.
So many that we couldn't keep track.
All of these dalliances that he had outside his marriage, which I'm not knocking at his business, but don't be a goddamn hypocrite.
All you, ah, Madagone, it's grande.
With your bullcrap, with your grandma, uh, my area, you know the grand me here. That's the big pile.
Two open lines today, five six seven, oh five 60 and pound five 60 on the AT&T Rital Slime 20 till noon at QAM.
This is the most disgusting program. I urge everyone to complain to this station.
It can strike any of us.
Just, just, just, just.
The tragedy of sexual stuttering.
It frustrates you and it infuriates the guy in the apartment next door.
What you saying, same already? You're making me sick over here.
The sexual stuttering afflicts you. Take heart.
I said it.
Oh, sure. My name is Bob.
To get on the road to recovery, call the sexual stuttering hotline at 1-800-0000-00.
It's 17 to noon at 560 WQAM. I was just thinking during the break.
I was wondering has our program director ever addressed any of the user problems technical or otherwise?
And the answer is, you know what he's doing? He's upstairs addressing envelopes.
That's what he's addressing. With difficulty, by the way.
We have two open lines in date, five six seven, oh five 60, pound five 60 on the AT&T Rital Slime.
How about some information about the guy named yeast infections here today, huh?
How about some good side effects to some chronic grotesque diseases, huh?
Like some kind of bacterial infection.
Like some kind of gross thing from outer space.
I mean, we might as well do self diagnosis because the doctors in this time they couldn't diagnose a goddamn blister on your finger.
Here's for a lottery. Hello.
Hi, Neil. Yes, sir.
I called you about a month ago. I told you I lost 35 pounds smoking crack. I'm up to 41 pounds.
Yeah, yeah. Cracked this.
Open-line at Broward 3 and date, five six seven, oh five 60 and pound five 60 on the AT&T Rital Slime.
Here's a mobile in for lottery. Hello.
So here's to you Eugene Robinson. Heaven can't be found down on this game.
I'll fill your pain. What's that you said Eugene Robinson?
40 bucks is such a deal for you.
Oh, man.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Great show now. Keep it going.
Good start. Okay. Work on it and the song too.
Okay. One line left on the board there. That's it.
One call left on there.

Facts as me a thing here about another sarcastic article written by the New York Daily News.
In the sports column about Miami and about what a joke this place is.
It says perhaps the best media moment was when the Miami hero. Then one of its.
I can't read the bad facts on ending special Super Bowl sections.
Trumpeted the game between Denver and Minnesota.
It says the hero had it just right at the big frat party.
It really doesn't matter who's playing anyway. That's right.
It's not a ball game. It's just another week to get drunk.
What it is.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Hank will be here at two. We got the booster.
Now that schedule up there. I can't make edge of tails.

end of the day.

I love these sports guys on ESPN.
This is not the first time.
Is that why it's an indiscretion?
Yeah. Yeah. It's not the first time for guys like him.
But again, that's not the point.
I don't begrudge a guy going out looking to get a lead.
But the fact is here is a guy who has set himself up as being a
whole year than now.
Who's quoting from the Bible.
Who's the prophet.
Who just got an award, Senator Deemora.
I mean, this story is, it's like a big elephant walking into your living room.
And these guys still can't see it yet.

their name they believe you know such as god in the legend and all this other
nonsense there's no mention we are proof of dinosaurs I saw these religious
nuts what about that dinosaurs so that's part of that the comic conspiracy you know

an area even prostitution on the map itself worth this cost to you and it's in
red and it's in black it's in black ink and it's in it's in a red area or so
yeah that's right in between probably that area where he was that yeah well

that that was one of the that was one of the areas that was on there at the
map and I heard your I heard you were looking for that information I'm sure I'm
telling you that all the areas on the map are marked do not go there stay the
way okay okay
George guys can question seriously did that man have like even a inkling of a
sense of humor no I mean like a little teeny like a shred like one fiber of a

existing buildings on earth about one or two thousand years older than the

the Christian religion the Irish had the oldest buildings on earth even older
than those buildings in Rome like the Colosseum yep yep oldest in
pyramid yeah also they they saved the Christian religion yeah and also the
potato famine yeah it was a duke conspiracy yeah that's it that's all I got okay
great what I talked about the riots what about all the other what does that tell
you when you know when you're a drunken Nick what does that tell you open-minded
brown one indeed five six seven oh five see drunken Nick that's like you know
repetitive redundant like bagspick exactly like Julio Madacone know him
here's a mobile implantation hello hey Neil yes sir hey how you doing okay
next time you're at the pants again my name is Bill I'd like to invite you to it's
New York come on in with you and your friends on me what what is it New York
New York right next planet Hollywood on the 17th Street Car's Way we got great food
there well what what what what what next time I'm at the Panther game well when you're
done you want something neat we're home to a lady but but but Bill I need to break the
news the I live like ten blocks away from the arena and the arena is way out
there in West Broward and you're on the 17th Street Car's Way and after the
Panther game I would go over to the 17th Street Car's Way for something to eat
it so in other words Bill you try to get a little free plug here is that what
you're looking for now I'm gonna send you some food send me some food to wear
you know where the station is yes we know where the station is yeah what are
you gonna send me Bill in other words like the arc I said you want to get a free
plug why don't you just say that Bill you'd like to use this show to get a free
plug I have no problem with that we're gonna send you what would you like for lunch
for lunch when tomorrow what do you got anything you want what do you got salmon I
hate salmon I don't eat fish I can't stand fish just a thought of it makes me
want a puke chicken sandwich or steak whatever you want yeah name it whatever chef
make it for you no we have an open-ended Broward one and a five six seven what
are you what are you laughing about I don't want anything that he's got he's on
the 17th email Scott must be desperate after the Panther game I'm gonna go
out of 17th Street Car's Way what is that about 25 minutes for my house that
that would how about if I go down the homestead first snack after the Panther
game man I feel so ready to take up a collection for poor Billy sounds like
he's having a tough time of it sounds like things are really hard I don't want
no food okay what I want is a doctor I want a real honest to God not that the
thing is so bad today but it just doesn't go away it's lingering it's lingering
I'm not concerned that it's something maybe it's allergies maybe it's like
some kind of a viral infection like low grade maybe it's a leprosy I don't
know but I like after seven or eight weeks of it and every now and then we hear
from somebody it says oh you know I've had this for like four months and five
months I'm not one of those people that wants to have something that's annoying
and irritating for four or five months you know what I'm saying no a doctor who
actually can do whatever testing it takes to get a diagnosis and then give you
something even if it's a blow up the brain and whatever it takes to alleviate
the situation I know in Florida that's a novelty maybe in the US it's a
novelty because you know the way medical practice is in this country that's
the American way they got a bunch of little cubicles and they sit you in there
and they make you wait and you wait and you wait and you look at your watch and
you pick your nose and you scratch your ass and you wait and you wait and they
come in and they give you a lick and a shmere and I do mean a lick and a shmere
and you're out of there here's the bill here's a bag of stuff go home and
they feel better next that's American medical practice they don't even give you
enough time to finish the sentence of telling that what what the what the
symptoms are that's why I still have that line about you know the guy goes
into the doctor says hey doc how do I feel that that's the greatest that's it
that's American medical practice for you oh you're fine you don't need me no I
need something it's gonna tell me something you're right I don't need you I
need somebody that's gonna tell me something tangible that's gonna do
something that's gonna actually perform some kind of something something even a
lobotomy sounds good at this point especially when you work for Greg Reed you
need a lobotomy and you're right he has a putts
now why why do you get so embarrassed while I say that you you can butch up now
you're you're saved you got a deal you got a contract you're not going anywhere
yeah but the contract says they can fire me for a person that he's a putt
okay how's that they can fire me for the car how about how about just dumb dumb
he's dumb he knows nothing sports guy he's a sports nerd is what you said he's
obsessed with the silly with a silly sports crap even though we got the
thanks to Jeff high who's my best close personal friend we got all this
task and stuff here from the ratings we're like we're not just I mean when I
look at this you look at the page and it just astonishes you like there must
be something amazing going on on the station between ten and two every day you
look at this chart here's this big thing sticking up in the air yeah there's a
big thing that's right sticking right up in the air right there in the middle of
the page right in the middle of the day in those four hours just zooming
way up it looks like a ratings viagre pill that's right straight up in the
air and they still don't get it we're still like oh gee you know we need him to
get the numbers up and get that money in it but he's such a pain in the ass we
like to sports stuff we want to get more of that sports stuff under talking
about you know Rutgers and Temple and all these other girl schools vassar all
this other direct all this pure unadulterated total bull yeah that's what that
makes this place go and they're the only people like it any assistance we got
like me and George that's it now that the poor Joe Castello he's got only
what he's doing probably hiding in a closet up there so they don't find them
in between paydays so there's two people working on the show every other show
on this station got 75 people working on the goddamn show which we discovered
last week much to our astonishment and quite frankly it looks to me if I'm
looking on his page if I'm reading this right they may be underachieving or
based on based on what they're talking about they may be overachieving when
you come right down to it yeah but don't get used to man upstairs with that
because he's the sports guy he's yeah they make him feel like a real man and if
you look at that haircut I think you can understand why it's 1157 at 560 Q.A.M.
it's a
in Miami town at 560 WQA
you
do you ever think when you're shiny it ain't walk a chicken bottle fat
signings yet the food tastes great so you don't complain but that's not chicken
and then the chicken chow mein seems to me out of Sweden sour pork but Garfield's on my
form it's perring here on my form
there's a cast in the kettle as a bee king the place that I eat every day and
do think it's me to cast and you'll never know once they're out there
up in the boys right right real quicks in the
old
chow mein asked if I wanted more as he was dialing up his buddy at the old
that's good and not today I lost my appetite
that's too kept in my belly and they want to fight I was sucking on a roller
and the thumbs are too when I swear I heard it mute and that is when I knew
oh there's a cast in the kettle at the teaching moon think I got a stop
even there at noon they say that it's peaceful to show
for but it's perring there on my form there's a hair fall on my floor
202 and 550 wq am I'll tell you one thing if I were running this god damn joint I'd be down here
and I'd have my lips firmly planted on neo-Rodger's
rectum and to that right now take a look at these numbers the god damn Messiah has come here to lift
them out of the doldrums we know it was supposed to be their big fall dolphin book did it work
did it work no no lifted them from the depths of the spare they ought to be down there kissing
all right instead of giving us an excuse for everything we ask like getting the god damn
volume up there so the people on the whole can hear something is that like a major request
no should anybody in the world be able to do that yeah like a real radio station yeah
ask for the most miniscule the most the most marginal little things and it's like wow you know
we got a program director who's got excuses that haven't been invented yet by anybody in the human
race and the reason that we got the numbers from Jeff high by the way our great fat sales guy
which I'm starting to like him a lot better say there's one thing about you you don't understand
he's not going to create any problem for us he's going to create problems for them and you know
something they deserve it but he'll do stuff like this for us because he wants to ingratiate
himself don't you understand you know that by now until he starts bringing clients in unannounced
and I don't I don't care what we do is kick them out starts but oh yeah I forgot about that when
he brought the food in that time from that time well I'm thinking of the one that the pizza joint
would probably tell you used to be the old pizza lot after he was told not he was told specifically
do not bring them in I will not endorse their crappy restaurant do not bring that food in here
what was that the pizza addict or something like that that's what it was that they lost and then
they had to change it from that oh that's right used to be the pasta loft at the beginning then
the Jeff Cohen forced them to change it because they were trying to rip off the pizza loft name
and then it became something else and I told him no he will not eat food from there and we're
not going to be too out of good close friend Jeff Cohen even always got that smarty hairdo and
it was awful fingernails we won't do that and he still has them show up and did we eat the food
no no did we no we said it back we said it said take it next door take it over to channel seven they
deserve each other you know match made in heaven take it over to rich santa's let him squat over the
bag here's Miami hello no yes sir happy Tuesday to you sir

impressed with that well i mean you know at a hundred twenty five dollars a pop that that's
what's a lot of money and i just got through saying they left a lot of money here we're glad to
have the money that's that's what i said and being an angle i but that doesn't mean that there's
a lot to do here because there's a lot of golf courses because the weather is good i mean what
is that mean well i mean what do you do anywhere else i mean the weather is good in Mexico city too
but i don't think i want to go there yeah i wouldn't know what cultural the weather's probably
pretty good in aca polco but i don't want to go there either yeah um being an angle in a in a
very Latin area i'd like to say that the latins have contributed a lot i mean they're the ones that
are building the cities populating and buying the big ticket housing items that allow the car
deals to out and buy their cars or turn around and spend a little all brown corollas that
what you're talking about is that just the Haitians and the ijamaicans buy them i'm sorry i
uh the little brown corollas i don't know about that but i'm just saying that the latins have
contributed a lot and you know like any other like all the fixed up fixed up elections that are
lying right you know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know
say the latins were blind i just said that uh you know that what they've contributed to this show i
think reflects in many ways what they've contributed to the general community large well i think the

contributing uh thank you so in other words you're not contributing either is that oh and he's gone

communicate and this to us this Greg read care if we even have a list of the uh where they are
and who they are no we don't care about that we just want people's money that's all we're here for
that that that that makes it even worse that makes it even worse i wonder i wonder who the AE

oh yes
oh
why don't i say those who were not on hold listen gorge with segurin last break at all you little
who knows out there you bunch of little fangots it's 12 45 at five fifty wq i'm here's a
fact from somebody i won't mention the name i work for american airlines and not too long though
they prestigious mime hero ran an ad saying that we were selling one way tickets to the carabee
and for seven bucks round three fourteen bucks it's absurd to believe that american airlines would
have seven dollar flights but we had to honor the advertisement and american airlines is
suing the hero for the different just another example of a first class job that the hero does
every day how do you like that if it's in the hero you know beyond a shadow of it out if it's
right there in your god damn mime hero in the front of your post it's a bunch of crap right
one of the worst newspapers one of the most anxious organ organizations
here's a sunrise hello i shot way to pool okay great congratulations we have an open-ended
grower at five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line here's a lady
in four-later day hello um yes yeah roudras yes man hi i listened to your show all the time and
i think you're doing a great job yes i am and um great community service oh thank you
i do i um i wanted to let you know i recently uh came across a book that i think might
shed some light on maybe with you being sick all the time it's called the yeast syndrome
and um they're finding that a lot of people that they've ever been put on antibiotics right um it
breaks down their immune system and it not only kills the bad bacteria but it also kills the good
bacteria i need some acid doffelus well yeah that would help exactly that would definitely help
but um a lot of i took a bath in yogurt you think that might do um i don't think that would do
i see a yogurt all over my flesh no i don't think so but um there's a pill that i'm recently
taking because i had a lot of the symptoms that you had mentioned that you were having it's called
hsso formula by primal defense and it's very very good it's a pill that you take anywhere from two
to three of them a day and herbalist and nutritionists do have them it's an all-natural product and
what it does is it builds back the good flora in your system so that you're able to digest the
food without getting sick and um it's very very helpful and i don't have any more headaches i have
no more sinathetics um it's great i feel like a new person again what is it called h2 all
back to well i know it's called hsso formula and it's called primal defense it's about 30 bucks
a bottle but um it's worth it and you can ask a nutritionist about it and they know about it
what an asking nutritionist about like an health food store oh yeah sure um i'm not sure of
agency would have it the more localized uh donnigan has it up uh in in bokeh return down
donnigan they have some other ones i'm sure you know that's my good friend jay is that jane
donnigan um jane donnigan yes right she'd be on my show a hundred years ago all the time
oh is that right yes jane doesn't send the abodilog it's for crann out i know well if i talk to her
come on jane get with it please tell her it's for neo-rod your she'll send me anything yeah but
it's very good and i think you'll find um by taking that um you'll feel a lot better you'll have
energy now what they did also put me on in in conjunction with this i had to go on a sugar-free
diet yeah which was very difficult yeah so yeah i've been on the sugar shock for weeks now and
i think that's that's contributing to this thing lingering on and on and on and on and on like
i don't want to admit that i had a pint of ben and juries um what was your last day oh chocolate
cherry garcia frozen yogurt last night oh okay well that was good yeah it tastes good but then the
after effect is what you pay for filling it so if you can you know maintain yourself for at least
a few days to get it out of your system drink a lot of water you'll feel a lot better
so i'll tell jane i want it i definitely won't if you get a chance pick up that book the e-sendrum
because it's not only women that are going through this it's men and they're that's what dr
aconsens is in the acons book he says that's the most overweight people most people that got a
sugar problem they've got a yeast problem they don't even know it that's right it's underlying cause
and the medical doctors want to dress it it's the holistic doctor's don't know any they don't want
to admit it now they don't and we're just like sitting here trying to fend for ourselves
okay thanks i wish you well thanks a lot thank you sir bye bye see finally we got a nice lady
there and who knows maybe it's just a bunch of witchcraft i don't know maybe it's for real

You can do in the behind, put a cigar in her vagina, she's all mine.
Well, you don't know where a stove goes.
I can see how there was some confusion between humor door and humid horror.
And then I can saw the term Cedar Box, means saw her naked,
stars reportedly to go in blind.
Now, listen, he was working hard late nights in the overy office,
working on a practical joke.
He took from Max and Nudo, put an explode in,
load in, load in for a mine girl, was blowing rings a smoke.
Pills the cars and mine girls a vagina.
She let's out of Giggle, every time he makes it we go,
mine girl is not the kind you can do in the behind,
but a cigar in her vagina, she's all mine.
Well, people feel that Hillary's been made a fool of by her husband.
Feel that Hillary was wrong.
Up in the Lincoln bedroom, she was born in,
born in, our door was doing her with bills, old vongiards.
Pills the cars and mine girls a vagina.
She let's out of Giggle, every friggin' time he makes it we go,
mine girl is not the kind you can do in the behind,
but a cigar in her vagina, she's all mine.
Not righteous.
Yes, does not stir, is that so?
Oh, yeah, what you gotta do is take a sip of Rillow,
and put it in a ground.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
104 at 560, I thought he put the cigar in the f***.
Anyway, we have two open lines in day two and brown at 567.
And by the way, is that interesting?
Monica had nothing new to say yesterday.
What a surprise, huh?
And for an injured nibbettin, don't be having nothing new to say today.
It's gonna be gloom of thaw, but you don't be having nothing new to say tomorrow.
What a shock.
But they just can't let go.
They just tenaciously keep, you know, the best part of the day yesterday,
and I missed it, I was in a shower.
They kept, you know, how they are supposed to be having these press conferences or announcements,
and they showed the microphones, and somebody's supposed to be coming out of the White House
or someplace, like right now, there's Dick Abhardt,
he's standing in front, let's see what he's saying.
Come on.
George.
Oh, he'll be focusing on winning Democratic control of the house.
Okay, and I'll put it on here, and he's pasty anyways.
Probably Irish.
But at any rate, so yesterday, the president's attorney came out of there,
the little adabit kindle one that lives in Kendall,
and was announcing about how they had gone to court,
and they're looking for, they're filing charges,
a complaint against the Ken Star for abusive power,
and for all these leaks.
I mean, this guy's got more goddamn leaks, George.
And that would a colostomy bag.
He's leaking all over the place.
And I thought to myself, yeah!
Not that they haven't already tried to do this before,
but just keep doing it, baby.
Because like I told you yesterday, most countries in the world
can star by now, who has been treacherous and treasonous,
he'd probably be in prison by now, for a hell of a long time.
And there's some countries like I said yesterday
where it might even be worse.
Because he just won't take no for an answer.
But of course, we understand it's nonpartisan.
Here's a great fact, by the way.
The Irish patented, did you read this?
Yes.
The Irish patented famine first in 1845.
Half the crop was wiped out.
It became worse in 46, even worse in 47.
The disease that attacked the pateta was 5th of,
something like that.
You see that?
I can't pronounce it any more.
It was bad.
The Irish population was faced with starvation.
This is when the first wave of immigrants escaped to Canada.
Funny thing is, it was the only patented crop
that failed in Ireland.
Wheat cats, beef, mutton, pork, and poultry roll
and excellent supply.
But Irish anglic landlord shipped these to the European con
into soften the starving there
and received big bucks in the former larger profits
than if they took care of their own people God forbid.
Why does the hatred exist today?
The hatred between the Irish and the English stems
from ships leaving Irish ports loaded with food
at the same time that their ancestors were eating grass to live on.
Let's see if that is smoked it.
If they were to learn the manja laganja.
The English government was unwilling to give any money
to Ireland with help against the famine because they said
the Irish will only use it to buy guns to be rolled against them
or buy more booze as the case might be.
And it goes on and on.
Thank you very much, sir, for a great fact.
So, case tonight I know about the Irish potato famine.
You learn something on this educational show every day.
We have an open line in Broward, two in date.
We're looking for the first holio of the day
who's got something to say about anything besides penis.
Okay, if there's one holio that can call us
and have a conversation about anything,
you'll be the first one all day today in the entire four hours.
You'll make everybody in South Florida stand up proud.
That's right.
After another disease yet another,
the 54 million disgraceful display of ineptitude
and one dimensionality of our South Florida Julio population.
Here's the wrong line.
Here's Pompano. Hello.
Yeah, me, you know, the pharix kind of stole my thunder there,
but I wanted to say I was told you stole your thunder?
Yeah.
All right.
The potato famine.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, here's a mobile in the...
He's called before by the way.
Keep him off.
Here's a mobile in the adventurer. Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hi, I'm actually from West Davie.
I listen to you all the time I work in adventurer.
I just want to let you know there are maple trees.
I don't put mangoes.
We do have maple trees.
Oh, you want to play out about that?
What?
I said thanks for the good news.
Okay, one call left on the board.
We got 52 minutes to go here today and we got one call left on the board.
I could, you know, something I could play...
I could listen to that all day.
I was thinking that when I was playing it.
God do I love that.
Then who's bumping down my...
Oh, yeah, I could play that all day over and over again.
That is one of the all-time classics.
It just is so...
I don't know what words...
It fails me.
I just can't find the word to describe how beautiful that thing is.
How perfect.
You just stick this finger right on it.
5670560, pound 56 on the AT&T wireless line.
Hank Goldberg today, too.
In fact, I don't see anything on a sheet about Hank being outside.
It's Hank doing his first show in the building today.
I believe.
Wow.
With no bugs and no rats and no infestation yet.
And then we got Boog through 6 to 10 talking baseball.
And we have no idea why in the second of February.
And it's Kaplan of 10 with the gambling show.
So is that true? Is Hank actually going to be upstairs today?
That's what we were told.
Wow.
Woo!
Here's a mobile in Miami Beach. Hello.
Hello, Neil. How are you?
Okay, sir.
You just missed something on the Ken Star Report.
Finally, the government came out and they said,
yep, we spent $40 million on the blowjob.
I think Mr. Robinson is a lot better off with his $40 bucks in this Ken Boulevard.
Good question.
Where should we spend $40 or $40 million on blowjob?
Excellent points here.
We'll be taking a poll on that tomorrow here on this show.
Dave County lines who open all 256705.
By the way, we're on the Air and Fort Myers.
The audio net is back on. We're all over the world.
I just mentioned those things again today.
Okay. Just in passing.
Because slowly but surely, they're finally putting the pieces of this joint back together again.
That they tore apart last week for the benefit of everybody else.
And now, like I said, our program director comes down here.
Oh, I'll be with the dead.
It's, oh, oh, oh, oh.
You know, not a bad guy, but totally and utterly useless, useless.
Like having a roll of toilet paper on your plate in a fine gourmet restaurant.
Here's a mobile in Hylia. Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you doing, sir?
Great.
Hey, I think I got a reason why you might be breaking out.
Why I'm breaking out?
Yeah. And while you're getting that complexion problem.
Complexion problem, yes?
Do you still do the Herconsize?
No.
No.
Okay. Listen, this is what happens to me.
I have been doing the Herconsize and I've been doing the Herconsize.
I'm on the bed and Jerry's ice cream diet.
Oh, you are.
Well, this is what I found.
Whenever I do the Herconsize and I happen to get off of it for any reason.
Right.
And I go back on trouble hydrates.
I noticed that my face starts to break out also.
Really?
Really?
Maybe it's all this sugar.
You think that could be it?
Maybe.
I don't know.
It's from what I started.
It's from what I started to see.
It's a fusionist, enormous amount of sugar that I'm consuming.
I think it's killing me.
Could be.
That's what I think is happening to me.
So whenever I get back on the Hercons, it goes away.
You know something I'm doing it right now.
Great.
Seriously?
Are you?
Haven't I stayed in you?
I'm back to you.
Thank you.
I'm doing it right now.
I haven't...
I've eaten nothing today.
I'm doing the Herconsize.
So far, I'm going to Mommy's Philanth today where she will have only Herconsize or else.
Open line of day two and Broward.
In fact, you better not have anything on the Herconsize.
That's not on the Herconsize.
Because I've told you there are a lot of people lined up waiting to buy that nice condo or hers in Hollywood.

yeah yeah I told you the last game I'm going to
see is tomorrow night baby
because I feel I'm seeing one of the best
people well so what does that mean that's the last
game you're going to see why I think it's a
sense in that I think it's the last game I'm

fed up with the with the new arena and I
want to go see one of the best teams yeah

suction here man everybody's getting a little
action
I think I have to stick your hand out the window
there you go more of it
Browards open 5 6 7 0 5 60 0 5 60 on the AT&T

embarrassed by you and your behavior they're
embarrassed Harold Harold Ballard is
embarrassed by you that's saying a lot
here's Miami hello hello yes how you doing now
okay I'm calling you for a couple things
number one what is going on at the Harold

Miami and I think I think I think they're
communist safer I mean I hate it I hate it
and then right when I say okay let me pick it
up to see you know they they blow it again
so I just hate the Harold yeah anyways I
called the Macarena yesterday okay and
twice they hung up on me I think that
they're sick what did you say you say

I'm in Broward you're alive you're listening
you're in Broward those are all three very
very very positive signs I didn't want to
just call for no reason but it occurred to
an article I had read in playboy a while back
concerning and it all has to do with the
presidential thing it was about blow jobs
yeah it said that high school students
these days considered a blow job almost like
shaking hands right they don't consider it
sex well that was that the guy that got
fired was that the story about the journal
the American Medical Association they got
canned for printing that that study they did
similar to that correct yeah that one now that
was at at the college level but they they
agree they said that what was 60 or 70 percent
of the college students did not consider
oral sex to be sex correct this was high
shaking hands there you go
they're shaking it hey it was just a
almost like an informal greeting right there
you go oh I mean what's that for us I mean
nice to see you can I service you for a
couple of minutes here and have a nice day
now I have one question I know I'm a big fan
of the godfather like you but have you
watched the sopranos on HBO have I watched it
yeah no you should it's it's not there's one
character yeah constantly quote just when I
thought I was out there bring me back in I
love that that's basically why yeah it is
and it's a fancy little speed and
advanced from the street band yeah very
appropriate to the uh the situation is
the character but you see every Italian
actor who's ever been in a mafia movie
is in this program and it really is
worth watching I recommend it highly it's on
HBO HBO Sunday night all check it out thank you
so have a nice day
mouth that's the word that comes to mind when you hear this music
fake you know there ain't no small
two music and history is great you know the
best thing when you're sitting in Rome in a
great trotteria enjoying a fantastic meal
and there's the music you know in the background
and then that that comes on just like that
and you're sitting there in Rome in Italy in
not in stichia necessarily thank god but you're
sitting in Italy and you're playing the god
father in the background and they're all
giving you like looks yeah by the way speaking of
a mafia I didn't know there was a port of
weekend mafia now it's only one house
and it's in springfield no it's on guiding light

Here's a mobile-infor-law today.
Neil God.
Yes, sir.
Hey, I wanted to talk about,
I wanted to touch on something first.
Go ahead, touch away, sir.
Ah, that's better.
My brother is devoutly religious,
and he drags me down to his,
calls every once in a while.
How's that?
And I asked him,
I said, so I'm taking it,
that God changed the laws of physics,
and made the first rainbow.
I was just covenant with man,
and he'll never drown us again,
because he loves us so much,
because next time he's going to burn us.
And you know what, my brothers said?
It didn't rain before that.
Right, that's right.
I couldn't know what it was.
I didn't have to rain,
because God created all the oceans,
and all the other stuff.
It never rained before the flood.
I'm like, they're so brainwashed.
I get, I get, I get, I get.
It's all, I get to.
Except tonight I rained in Georgia.
That's all I got to say for you today, Neil.
Thanks for the good news.
God bless you.
Okay.
I mean, you know about tonight.
Now was it, was it the last train in Georgia
that showed up the night I rained in Georgia?
And what was that yesterday about
Gladys Knight has become a moron or something like that,
and she's wearing the magic underwear.
Remember the guy called yesterday
and said something asking me about Gladys Knight,
and how it should come to be a moron.
Maybe she's got the hots for Steve Young.
I don't know.
Maybe she wants to rub their magic underwear together.
Open line and Broward, two in date.
We're still waiting to hear from all those Julios in the day of county.
All the heterosexual Julios in the day.
You can call right now, five six seven,
oh five sixty.
We're waiting.
All the heterosexual, okay,
that's the poll question for tomorrow.
Who's going to call first?
A heterosexual priest or a heterosexual Julio in the day?
Five six seven, oh five sixty,
and five five sixty on the AT&T wireless line.
In fact, maybe we'll kill two birds with one stone.
There's no fact in the church.
Yeah, maybe that's a fact it'll call in tomorrow.
Here's a mobile in Pompo-no.
Hello.
Mobile in Pompo-no.
Going once.
Long gone.
Here's a bokeh. Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, don't know.
Hey, we're asking about these Puerto Rican mafia.
Yeah.
All right, we got a group over there in Puerto Rico
called the machete wielders.
They run around machete.
They're going to kill all these American people
because they don't want to get together with America and Puerto Rico.
Yeah, I didn't know OJ was in a cult.
Oh, mayors.
So that's what they do.
And one time there was an FBI agent killed down there in Puerto Rico.
They wouldn't let them,
they wanted a barium on the top of the hill.
And they wouldn't let them.
So finally, the United States went down there,
buried them on the top of the hill anyway.
All the machete-wilder boys went up and took the body out from the hill
and threw it down the bottom.
Great.
Okay, thank you.
And they all moved to Springfield.
Okay, thanks for the good news.
Guiding light, man, you got to be a man.
You got to be a lunatic to watch these soap operas.
But then again, when you've been watching them for like how many years has it been now?
Fifty-nine, forty years.
Forty years from going to high school and coming home for lunch every day.
And there was a fifteen-minute.
There was.
1230 used to be the, what was that show?
Ant-Meta used to be on it.
Search for tomorrow.
Used to be on it.
1230.
For fifteen minutes.
And then guiding light was on it.
1245.
For fifteen minutes.
Can you even begin to envision a show that would last for fifteen minutes?
And it would actually like do a show and keep your interest?
Can you imagine that?
No.
No, not today, you can't.
And then they eventually evolved into the thirty-minute shows.
And that will lead to the real crappy shows like the Bold and the Beautiful,
which has got like two characters.
That one guy from Player has been on there for six hundred years.
What's his name?
Ridge.
Ridge, yeah.
Oh my God.
I say shove his ass off the Ridge and watch it.
Man.
They got like two characters on that show.
Because it's only on a half an hour.
All three.
Ridge and the two women that he's always torn.
Like I said, you watch that show?
That's the wife watching it.
Sure.
Your wife watches the Bold and the Beautiful?
All those, what is it?
NBC?
All the NBC shows?
All of these things.
Well, she also watches the days of our lives there, no doubt.
No, I'm on the wrong network.
She watches Bold and the Beautiful, the other way around.
It's a beautiful couple.
She's a young and a horny, then.
Young and a horny.
Yeah, the horny, right?
Oh, she might have the hots for a Josh Moore, then, for Nick.
Yes.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Oh, well, you got George, but hey, Crystal Luppen's perfect.
Here's for Lauderdale.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Can you, uh, you may think I'm crazy, but that little laugh that Hank does.
That cracks me up.
Yeah.
What, that was what you mean, that was laughing at, Neil.
Greg, Greg Read and Dufflin, they came and distributed together and said, can we do anything for you?
And he went, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
All right, okay, there you go, pal.
That was funny.
Hey, by the way, Hank, with his first show and I was exciting new studios with the same old crappy equipment.
By the way, if you think that's funny, Hank, Greg Read with a straight face came down here today and said, oh, yeah, that board we moved over here.
That's state of the art, man.
The engineer said that's a really great board.
You believe that?
Yeah.
They got it in the key mark on sale day.
They got it in a radio shack.
We have Broward lines open, 600, them 566, 705, 60, 05, 560 on the AT&T line.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Hey, what do you think about all those scummy blacks that came down from Atlanta's off beach?
I'm just scummy blacks.
How about the scummy whites?
They're all none of that.
Like yourself.
Okay, open line of day three and Broward.
566, 705, 60, 05, 560 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's Boka.
Hello.
Yeah, Neil, you're a douchebag.
Okay, thank you.
All right, the good collars are coming out now.
They saved the good material till the very end.
Okay?
Thank you very much, sir, for sharing your brilliance with us.
Here's a mobile in Weston.
Hello.
Well, that's a hard one to follow.
Yeah, that was great.
He waits for how many minutes to come on here.
You know, you're a douchebag.
Clicked.
That's good.
Excellent, pal.
Come on.
Work on that telephone technique a little bit.
You'll be great.
Like the guy that was doing the Pavel Burry.
And then all of a sudden, he started hearing a hum job on the phone.
He had a run.
He started feeling like I'm dripping in his pants.
I heard you talk about, Derek.
Touch on Raul and Martinez.
Yes.
Did you read in the paper?
I'm going to put it on the best part of him.
Over the weekend, or I guess last week,
the City Commission voted to give him $1.2 million in back pain.
Right, I did see that.
And that's why I saw that article by Carl Heist in Highly
of Univermented Criminal that they didn't like and they deserve each other.
That's the article I read.
It was a match made in Purgatory, right?
And that only one person showed up to contest it.
Of course, because they all, I don't fear for their lives over there.
And they're preoccupied with each other.
That's the cop fights, right?
All right, Neil, that's all I got to say.
Thanks for the good news.
Can I call Jolly a douchebag?
No.
By the way, what was that movie, Eating Raul?
Two open lines in date, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,
pound, 5, 60, 180, 18, 20, 20.
Maybe that's what they like doing in Highly is like Eating Raul, huh?
Maybe that's why he's still be there.
