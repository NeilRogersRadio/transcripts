in Hollywood. Thank goodness somebody's still on there. What's going on here? I guess
those guys are right out to get the operation. Well, maybe it's lunchtime. Well, they're
doing it on their way. Listen, that's all they're calling about is dog scooting. About
his dog's wife. Skooting. Well, he was just that wasn't for real. He was a he's a goofball.
All right. And listen, if you have a dog, you have your two dogs. If you go to
school, it's good. It's not always warm. I just can't. But they're not scooting. Well,
wait a minute now. Okay. Well, what do you want me when they start scooting? Have you
like given them instructions to start scooting? I don't want them to be scooting. I got
enough problems with that. All right. But every so often they have to scoot. In fact, my
little dog last night during the middle of the night did something in the kitchen he hasn't
done in months and it wasn't scooting. I'll tell you that right now. Well, we started with
the same letter ended with the same one, but that was about it. We all make big accidents.
But anyway, watch out for him. He's dangerous, man. He's just a letch. Well, it's either your
dog's family. It took the University 101 of you, event. That's all the only class he
attended. I want to teach you something tonight. I learned. I got your keys at him. Now,
what is it about scooting? Take it down to the vet and tell them that you want his anal
express. His anal express? He will explain to you. Is that like federal express? May I tell
you what it is? Yeah. In other words, if you don't like somebody, send them a package
through anal express. Is that what you're trying to say? No, no. It appears to be. What
time is your show on? You got better material than I do. I'll tell you that. The anal express.
Uh-huh. It's a truth. I just came from the vet today and here, Crowley, come down. Is that
American Express? Don't let them when they go to the bathroom. Now, here, let me put
my hotel bill on my anal express. And you'll ask your vet and he's going to tell you
that lady's right. Well, lady is right. Oh, you mean you? Me? Yeah. Okay. Anyway, when
they go to the bathroom, something should come out with it. And when it doesn't, wait a
minute. I don't understand. Something should come out. I'm coding. Yes. I'm coding.
Yeah, like it. Well, I really don't inspect. You know what I'm saying? I'm just not
telling you what car there are some people who are into that, but that's not my cup of tea
if I can say that. Well, I mean, you'll save your dog a lot of. There should be a coding.
Yeah, like it. Please, you know, a coding. You mean like on a cam, like on a soup can
in a supermarket, a universal pricing code. A goo. A goo? Yes. And this is in the middle
of the lunch hour and you're talking about goo on poop. All right. Now, what kind of a
show do you think this is? It wasn't bad enough that we had the thing from the Euro Dynamics
Center. This is important for your dog's old. They're doing just fine without the goo,
okay? Yeah, but I mean, if ever happens, that's always good to be prepared, okay? Anyway,
they have two little glands by their anal. What? Two little glands. A gland on. And I'm
Miriam's joining and they have to squeeze it. What do you like? Of course, a perverts? No. I'm
not going to start squeezing my dog's glands. Listen, I need to get kicked out of the neighborhood.
I don't have enough baggage to carry. All right. Oh, he squeezes his dog's glands in the back yard.
That's a few people nuts. No, no, no. The SPC will be there in a half an hour. That's an
necessity. It's an necessity. Right. I got to squeeze my dog's glands. Maybe not. I don't think so.
They were fixed a long time ago. I don't think nothing's going to happen. Squeeze in air glands. Listen,
when the dog's towards you, take him to the vet and he doesn't have worms. Ask him. Does he need?
Adam wants to come back in and I consider squeezing his, but that's about it. Listen,
everybody can't do that. You've got to take to the vet or to somebody that's going to do it. I thought you said
I got to do it. Now the vet is going to squeeze his glands. That's right. I want the dogs. And then it empties them out
and now my little girl is gone. And if he's one out. The group that didn't come out with what she
came out. The coding. This is the group lady. The next time you call me back, you just identify
yourself. You can be the group lady. Okay. It sounds like you've got a lot of expertise in this.
No, I'm not serious. I just hit dogs all my life. It's the anal express lady. And this is the first dog
my pug that I beg your pardon. I see I've hit dogs. What is it? I'm a pug. I have a little
pug. Yes. A darling little pug. And it's the first time that I've got it. I've learned that's what
Sud said too. I have a little. You know what? Yeah. When you talk about your little girl
dog lifting her leg when she makes the wheelie. No, it's a little boy dog. Oh, well,
then she's sitting with the leg. I thought it was an girl dog. Well, he only, he like
alternates every other one. He's undecided now in between. I didn't girl dog. The
like potty habits are died. Is this like your area of main interest? I just like a happy dog.
You like a happy dog? They have an itching. They can't scratch. Just eat the poor dog. That's why they
scoot. They scoot because they have an itch that they can't scratch. That's right. So,
if you don't want to dog the scoot, scratch it. You're ever having itch that you couldn't scratch.
Yeah, let your dog do it. Tonight on ABC, it's America's most heavily armed singing sensation,
the cartridge family. I'm sleeping as a prouder in my bedroom. So I'll spring up in my bed
and outpump him full of lead. I think I'll shoot you. No seven day waiting period for
this family. Is surely yes, Rubin. I've decided to up my feet to 20%. It comes as I give it,
10 will be five. Then with daddy falls for a rather macho looking woman. It's L.A.
Laws, Susan Day to the rescue. Can't talk my brother, you ANCDC miss, FAM.
And you like cockroach. You'll love the cartridge family. It's domestic violence and it's musical bass.
Traveling along with our beast with the whistle. We're here happy. We're here happy.
The cartridge family tonight on ABC following the final episode of Brady.
To hell with Elvis, Paul Simon's in Central Park tonight. Who the hell gives a crap about Elvis?
And there will be a whole bunch of people are in Central Park and it's going to be on HBO at seven o'clock tonight.
But of course Paul Simon's got some talent so we don't want to get too excited about him and he's kind of ugly too.
And Jewish. Here's a lady in Miami. Hello. I'm Neil. I'm the first time caller. Well great.
I love your show and let me tell you something. I do care about Elvis. But I don't think I'm alive.
What did you say you do care? I do care. What do you mean you care? What does that mean?
I mean I care about what's happening. Whether people are seeing him or not.
Oh, but anyway, it's funny. I ran into a president Lincoln at Kmart yesterday. It was incredible.
Yeah. And do you know that that beard was one of those past on jobs he never even had a beard?
Did you ever see any of those pictures? No, listen to me. Did you ever see any of those pictures of Abe Lincoln?
We're here. All those like big gigantic like bumps on his face. Yeah. Well, so he used to wear one of those costume beards to cover it up because he was grotesque.
You're kidding. Now anyway, he slapped that baby on there and Kmart yesterday said, I'll be damned.
I know you anywhere. What did you ask him about Elvis? As a matter of fact, he said that you just had lunch with Elvis at Wayne Arnels.
Why anyway? I heard you say that. I heard you say you didn't want to show. So I just wanted to say that.
Give us the rundown. Okay. First of all, I don't believe he's alive. I think that's just a bunch of crap and they're doing that to get money, to make money.
Can you imagine what he would look like if he was still alive? Oh, baby. Oh, baby. Oh, baby. Oh, baby. Oh, baby. I'm really sorry. Oh, Elvis. Oh, baby. Oh, God.
Anyway, anyway, 79% of the people they called in actually said that they believe Elvis was alive. Of course. And probably spend about 20 hours of their waking week thinking about it.
And that bill bickety. I mean, I think the only reason he did that stupid show was because they killed that green creature he used to play on TV because he's desperate for something green.
And it's not a creature. Yeah. Why anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I did see it. And so what, but I mean, so what was the upshot? What's the deal?
Well, they're saying that it was all it could be a government cover up. Did they show sightings? Did we see like make-believe pictures?
Oh, yeah. They showed two pictures. One of them he was with Muhammad Ali and Jesse Jackson and Jesse Jackson. Well, he shows up everywhere. You know what I'm screwed or he is.
And they were apparently this was a live show because they were saying that Jesse Jackson or any friend or relative of Jesse Jackson. If you're out there, please call him and let us know whether that's all personal now because Muhammad Ali did say it was Elvis.
Incredible. Oh, Muhammad Ali said it. Yeah. I was he was he coherent at the time or was he like was his head bobbing around like Linda Blair?
Well, they didn't say they didn't say, but I bet it was like Linda Blair. You think Domino's will deliver this late?
Anyway, Neil, I love your cell and I'm really nervous about talking to you. Well, you've been great. Well, this is Elvis. I may be dead, but I'm still a king. You know what I mean? I think you did. I do. Well, listen, have a great day. You've done a sensational calm down. Okay, because 500 years from now will still be looking for.
Thank you, Neil. And they'll be looking for us too. Oh, by the way, before I go, what came or did you spot Lincoln in?
The one where they sold that Mary head a little am tape. Okay, same one. Maybe there's a connection there. Good thing. I'm going to look into it. Okay. That'll be the next show with her all though. See you. Wow.
It's 10.19 at W.I.O.D. We have an open line a day. The Elvis thing has got everybody just going nuts.
One nine. We all ought to be honest with you quite frankly. I'd rather her but Elvis than Luke Perry. I will say that. You know, we finally got line six fixed, but the ball been here and I finally died out. It's been dying over here.
You've bought his records. You've seen his film. You'll even purchase the day glow velvet memorial paintings of the gas station. As a true Elvis fan, you think you've heard it all, but wait, there's more. Now you can buy secret recordings of Elvis's last telephone conversations.
Yes, it's the Elvis tapes. I want you to come over right now and make me a big peanut butter and never so much. I'll be in the butter and then I'll tell you what you're really good at me.
You'll hear Elvis in his most intimate moments. All the pieces of mail. Yeah, this is the almost once you bring over a couple large piles. Don't make it three. Don't make a sex double cheese.
Yeah, I'm hungry. I'm alone. And I'm hungry. And you'll hear Elvis reveal how he really feels about the one true love of his life. I want you back. I want you back in my life, baby.
And on your way back, would you pick up some donuts, please?
Legally clean, don't talk. Crawl as G. Davis to all of my big honey glies don't.
Without them, I can't do the Elvis tapes. Okay, baby. Give me give me give me more. Don't.
Abailable now in rod stores everywhere. All of these. All of these living on demand to do.
I get a big pot of spaghetti. He's ain't dominoes on delivering this late. 10 55 at WIO and D and we'll go to Miami. Hello.
Hello. Yes, sir. Mr. Rogers. Yes, I am. Would you like to welcome to my neighborhood? It's a beautiful day in your neighborhood. It sure is. But a hot for this sweater though.
Would you like to know what really happened with the Hank Goldberg comment? Yes. This is the show where we get to the bottom of the truth. And we twist and distort it and manipulate and exploit it.
Exactly. Okay. First of all, I don't know, you know, what these guys are on. We're calling up with these descriptions. Like the first guy one guy who called up about the Elvis show.
Yeah, it was funny. They think he's alive. Well, what happened? Well, they thought he was alive. They just didn't get any information out of it.
The only person that got information out of was Laura. And she's in the building here. The colors are unanswered.
I saw about 20 minutes of it on and off. And I know more about it than I have heard on the show anyway. But that's not why I called.
Okay. And I fell of this stuff already. I was listening to Elvis. What is it? I say I was listening to the micronary show this morning.
Yeah. The micronary show. And between 9 to 10 or 9 30 and 10, there's a dolphin report with Hank Goldberg on tape.
Not talking to anybody on his show or any woman. And he said roughly trying to pick a winner in an exhibition game is like trying to pick a winner in a show.
That was a beauty contest of women over 30. Don't want to really stand out. That was funny. That's about your crap. Well, I disagree.
And it was not it was it was a renary and sunny were in the room. You know, in the studio. And when they heard it, I guess they hadn't heard it. They went, oh, you know, and then renary said something about.
Well, what does Sonny know about that? Well, I don't know. And I disagree with Mr. Goldberg also as far as that goes. I think there are some very beautiful women over there.
Women see, I've made that point many times guys after they get to be like 22 or three. They get David Johnson syndrome and their face starts falling apart and their features get all distorted. They get ugly women when they're like in their late 20s and all the way many of them into their early 40s become more attractive. Become beautiful. So Hank, a corporate. It's a topic. Hank don't know much about.
Okay, well, thanks at least for straightening a south. So to speak right. You're quite welcome. Okay. Have a good. See you. See all those hookers at salad gold. Hank, they're all like old babes. They just have a lot of makeup and they're far away from far away. A lot of people even look. Perry looks good far away.
We have an open with a bag over a set an open line and they'd 751 W I O D. Thank God we got rid of all those pimply little kids had been calling all week long. Maybe they're getting ready to go back to school.
To we hope we pray to Ralph. Hello. Yes, I am. Hi, Neil. How you fine? I like to say something to you in Spanish. No, don't do it. No, something good. Something good. Yep. I like to say take care of much. Oh, isn't that sweet. I thought you were going to say.
I'm just trying to land the boy up. I like that. I beg your pardon. I'm so what is it? I only once once per customer. Okay, they care. I'm just trying to land the boy up. I can't. Yeah, what does it mean? It means that we're going out for a chicken at noon.
Don't choke on it. What? It means we're going out for chicken at noon. Don't choke on the bones. I like you very much. I like you. I like you. I like to say something to you know what we need. What? You know, we have this one cart that says.
Wait a minute. We need that in Espanol. Hello enough of the sucking. We need that in Espanol. Do you know how that would be with that would.
In Espanol. Is it again? Is it again? It's not as fun. You're let's portuguese. Oh, you speak Portuguese. And don't for the stock. No for the stock. I think. Yeah. I have an idea. Okay. Somebody will call him. We'll get that on tape. That's a good one. Because we have to have like a bicep by a lingual show. I said, I hope you're having a great day. I really.
You're very nice. I really like you. I am nice. I get a bunch of my mother. Well to you. Bye. Bye. Have a great day. Wow. Little juicy there too. Huh? Speaking of juicy. When's it juicy for its bottom?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
Yeah. Yeah.
They said, hey, we need to drop blind.
I closed my eyes, cause it's getting too late.
My career might die, but I'm feeling greedy.
And he bull can't see how much I adore it.
I get better menus, cause I'm going forward.
I didn't hurt anybody else, so leave me alone.
So I can touch myself.
No, no, I mean hurt, no, anybody else.
I hold up my hands, police officer, but I'm busy now.
I'm like a media popcorn with butter on the side.
That's better myself.
Let it all sound like a WID, thinking a lot of you have been pretty hard on Peewee.
Let's go to a Fort Lauderdale, hello.
Oh, Elvis.
This is Elvis.
It's the King.
Let me tell you something.
I'll be dead.
I don't like the way you've been ragging me on the air.
Yeah.
I might be a big fat ass, poor Robin junkie, but I know my hands love me.
And they say I'm behind me, baby.
This is over.
I'm a little older.
I may be dead, but I'm still a king.
I think you do.
Let me tell you something, another disorgan from you.
Okay, Elvis.
But I don't like it, baby.
Bottom's up, baby.
And Timahe's with a douche bag.
Okay.
Oh, man.
He's everywhere.
Oh, God.
You know what I found the other day?
I sure hope I didn't bury it in here again, but I'm sure I did.
Now, here it is.
Look at that.
I'll be damned.
I found a Mojo Nixon and Skidropper.
I've been looking for this CD, and we had it buried in the balls of our thing here.
And I haven't played this in ages.
God.
Wouldn't this be great?
When I look out into your eyes out there, when I look out into your faces,
you know what I see?
I see a little bit of Elvis in each and every one of you out there.
Let me tell you.
We'll see you there.
Elvis, you there.
Elvis, you there.
Everybody.
Elvis, you there.
Elvis, you there.
Oh, baby.
I'm a man.
What I want to do to see is I'm a man.
I want to see you there.
That's all I've been doing.
Elvis, you there.
So anyway, we can just kind of like you said in the background all day today.
Because it's Elvis week here on 610 WIOD.
So after your homework assignments completed night, we'll tomorrow get the answers to the
musical question.
Which one is dead?
Which one's alive?
Luke Perry or Elvis?
Pembroke Pines.
Pembroke Pines?
Yeah.
Neil.
Oh, here we go.
Here I knew it was too good to be true.
Yes, I am.
Can you put the apple for?
No.
Nine minutes past 11 at WIOD.
We have an open line in Broward.
If you're not at least four years old, do not call this station today.
We'll come and beat the crap out of you and take away your Luke Perry.
Look alike, doll.
Miami.
How can I follow him?
How you doing, Neil?
You couldn't. You shouldn't be too hard.
Okay. I have it.
If you're ready, I'll translate that for you in Spanish.
Okay.
Yeah, you don't have to dump it or anything.
You sure?
What I lied to you?
Listen to this, George.
We need our interpreter.
Yeah, it's my instinct Spanish.
You can listen to this.
Sure it does.
All right, ready?
Yeah.
Should I do it like a test run, or?
Drive run.
Yeah, no, my love, my love.
My love.
What?
Is that okay?
Was that bad?
It wasn't bad, but it's not right, you said.
What?
Well, why is that so difficult to translate?
Yeah, well, yeah, it is enough.
It's the last time I say bot, yeah.
That's too long to say, you know.
You want to keep it short, and we say it real fast, it'll work.
Keep it real short. I can relate to it.
Well, you know, I can say it real quick, and it'll slide by.
Okay.
No, no, no, no, no, I'm not meant to.
Just like that.
Great.
All right. I'm a star now.
All right.
You're going to be, are we going to lift that off of their Georgia?
Are we going to remark that?
Try to get.
Georgia is not too impressed.
He's like, oh, you know, what do you want?
He's not a correct translation.
He's not a correct translation.
It's not a correct translation.
You said he thinks you're Jewish.
And Jewish.
And he wishes to come down here and prove it.
Oh, I've got it to the seat, right here.
Well, let me see.
What translation do you want to use for sucking?
Hey, listen, this is getting a little tense for me,
because I have no idea what either one of you perverts are talking about.
So that's just, that one's good for me.
All right. One more time.
No, no, no, no.
Okay. One more for the West Coast.
For the West Coast.
No, no, no, no, I'm in my.
Oh, that was good.
That kind of like rolled out of there.
All right.
Thanks a lot, Rick.
You're a king.
See ya. Good day.
Rick Sanchez, ladies and gentlemen.
Open line and day, 751 WIOD.
We're going to have like enough of the sucking
and 75 different languages before we're done.
Now this is everywhere, man.
I bet you Elvis is over at Sonny's Market right now.
You know they got snappled at Sonny's Market?
Neil Rogers. That's my one.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Miss Oprah Winfrey.
You know, they say being on TV makes you ten pounds heavier.
Well, child, I'm on TV five days a week.
So do what I do.
Give in.
Put that pudge back on your frame with Oprah Winfrey.
The fattening diet that lets you eat whatever you want.
It tastes terrific and it's really rich, just like me.
I just have a shake in the morning.
I bowl the fruit leaves with cream, another shake at ten,
an eight slice pizza, another shake at noon.
Shake it loud. I'm fat and I'm proud.
With Oprah Winfrey, the instant weight gain diet
that really works.
Another shake at two o'clock.
I'll hold on a second.
I'll try you full, 20.
Just put it over there.
What the fuck is off to you?
I don't know where it was.
Oh yeah. A Bloney Grinder, a port of a mouth, a bag of...
Oh, it's a revenge fast.
Give in if you're weak.
We'll put on the waist.
Side of feet.
The state of Idaho.
Fice of it.
11.15 at WIOD.
Let's go to Miami on a starline.
Hey Neil.
Yeah.
How you doing?
This is JCM.
I'm the port of Miami here.
Yeah?
I just want to let you know that tonight you're going to walk
over the hills for...
102 on 34678.
Yeah, that's the way.
You might get a surprise Neil.
You might even see Elvis.
Really?
Yeah, Elvis is in that program.
It's Elvis's look alike.
Is he playing as a role as a teacher or something?
Are you cereal?
Yeah, I'm serious.
I'm really serious.
Wouldn't it be something you've turned out that Dan Rather was Elvis
wearing like a mask?
That's good.
Well, I just want to let you know so keep your eyes looking.
Yeah, I'll keep my eye on it.
Keep your eye on it and take it easy.
Okay.
Let's see it.
Well, he was a good guy.
He didn't want anything.
That's unusual for our callers.
We have an open line in the starline there.
It's star IOD.
If you have Bell South mobility, it's just smoking.
We're doing it.
Poor Lauderdale.
Hey Neil, what's up?
Yeah?
You know that last caller that mentioned the Elvis look like in Beverly Hills?
Yeah?
3063.
He did play Elvis.
Who did?
The one in place, the acting coach on that Beverly Hills.
Not Luke Perry.
No, he's, I don't know his name, but he looks a little bit like Elvis.
Just like the guy in there.
Everybody.
But he did on the Elvis TV series that was on ABC.
He was Elvis.
God, you just can't get away from him.
He's everywhere.
How about your Pat Sejack is probably Elvis too?
Probably.
Or Vanna, one or the other.
Well, Vanna's for Stella.
That's it.
I got it.
Here's a question for you.
Can you name, there's only four of them now.
How many?
Okay, Babe Ruth, Luke, Eric.
How many actresses played Elvis?
Actresses?
Actors.
Betty Davis?
No.
Joan Crawford?
Yes.
Okay, how many actors played Elvis?
Yeah.
I know that guy Jerry Apussy, Gary Pucy, whatever that can't stand him.
He just did something about him.
He played him right?
Right.
Well, he played Buddy Holly.
Yeah.
He played Elvis.
Did he also play Elvis?
No.
Okay.
Don Johnson.
Don Johnson?
Perfect match.
Kurt Russell?
Oh, God.
Remember?
Kurt Russell.
Remember?
Where I hear Kurt Russell's keeping Walt Disney's grave warm.
That's just a rumor.
Okay, who else?
Dale Midquid.
Dale Murphy?
Dale Midquid.
That was his and your team.
Yeah.
Wonder if Elvis wore a button down fly.
You got to ask Tom Jicke about the Seeking kids.
Wait on Speak to Tom Jicke on your 610WYOD News Intensive Station anymore.
Sir, he's a little slime ball, a little creep in a tour.
Oh, well anyway.
He's sleeping with the fishes as far as we're concerned.
And the final actor and the great movie Heartbreak Hotel was David Keith.
David Cassidy.
David Keith.
David Keith, Cairidine?
No, David Keith.
Who the hell is that?
Who the hell is that?
Who the hell is that?
Who the hell is that?
I don't know who he is.
Some washed up back.
Well, I tell you one thing we're discovering.
This audience is Elvis Intensive Man.
You got it just from head to toe.
It's a sickness.
It is.
It's an illness.
It is.
You got the cure?
Oh, wait a minute.
What happened to my cart?
Jeez, this is just getting a minute.
Okay, have a great day, sir.
We're going to play it for you in just a second.
Thank you.
See ya.
Well, I know you must share the same way after all these years.
It's been a long time.
Well, a couple of times, when you have a problem,
it helps to talk with others who have the same problem.
Okay, Elvis, you guys are under the chair with a group now?
Yes, I do, Elvis.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.
Hold on, Elvis.
You should have me ordered some double cheese pastes for you.
We'll get some peanut butter, nan or salmon to serve.
I'm here, Elvis.
I'm here, Elvis.
You're listening to an encounter session at your local Elemon Center.
Elemon, where chronic Elvis impersonators go for Elvis.
I want you to get one without you saying Elvena.
Well, sir, I think it's time that people
stop discriminating against us female impersonators of Elvis.
You know, I got so I burned to it.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Learn to recognize the early warning signs.
Switching lips.
I see your control, my friends.
Swinging hits.
I'm all shook up.
Incredible weight gain.
More twinkly splint.
At Elvis Enonymous, we understand that impersonating Elvis is not a career.
It's a disease.
Let me tender.
Let me sweet.
Give us some truth.
So please, send what you can to L-Anon, members Tennessee.
And thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Why do you like it a lot?
Why do you like it a lot?
Why do you like it a lot?
It's not only me.
I'm all shook up.
Oh, yeah.
He's ain't dominoes of delivering this late.
He's in your cheeseburgers.
Elvis is in nutty buddies.
Elvis is in your mom.
He's in everybody.
He's in the young old, the fat, skinny, white, black, the brown, and the blue.
People got Elvis in them too.
By the way, all your little kids out there, if that's true, if Elvis is in your mom, call a police immediately.
I know.
That's a chicken's deputy.
On your house.
Alex, ruby.
We move on now to double jeopardy.
Penny, you had the low score at the end of the last round.
Choose a category, please.
Extra terrestrials for 200.
It makes strange noises in the chicken coop late at night.
Yes, oneness.
Frank Perdue, no.
Cajun.
No, what is a poultry guy?
A poultry guy.
Penny, you still have control of the board.
To beak or not to beak for 600.
He was the star of the Omen.
Oneness.
Correct.
We'll return with violent chicken jeopardy where a category will be choking the peck.
Right after this.
I'm surprised to hang the land on the chicken coop.
1155.
We have an open line on the center square in Broward at 524, WIOD, Miramar.
Neil.
Yes, I am.
How are you doing today?
OK.
Hold on a second now.
Hold on.
Listen, you're not going to go away, are you?
Hello.
Who's this?
Yeah.
It's Phil.
I know.
Listen, I got a confession to make.
Well, wait a minute. I'm not taking you now.
Oh, come on, I only got a minute.
See, that's...
Now, wait, hold on.
Are you going to be upset?
Very upset.
I've been holding here since 7 o'clock this morning.
All right, just say.
He said he's going to be really hysterical.
He's full of crap, but take him anyway.
All right.
He said you're full of crap, but go ahead.
Well, don't, that's my business.
Listen, you're translation.
Yeah.
Spanish for enough of the fucking.
Uh-huh.
It's pasta de mamar.
What?
Why are you laughing?
Is that bad?
No, no.
No, I mean, George, he's like, he said it's not right.
He said you're full of crap.
Oh, two people said you're full of crap.
Two people?
Yeah.
So you must be.
I got some great baby candy for you.
OK.
How about some of the candy you had last yesterday?
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm probably going to express it right over.
OK.
Listen, I got a bone to pick with you.
Uh, your sports department.
In the evening?
That's not me.
Well, I just want to complain.
I try and listen all day long.
Yeah.
Or something about baseball.
All right, well, hold on a second.
Are you getting exasperated?
Didn't I tell you?
What?
Hang up on him.
No.
He said I ought to hang up on him.
No, I'm telling you he's crazy.
All right.
He said you're crazy.
Yeah, you know what he's full of.
All right, now come on.
Let's get to it.
Anyway, I've got a confession.
I've never missed Beverly 90210.
Yeah, it figures.
I'm serious.
Anybody with a pasty orange complexion like you, God.
But, uh, what I'd like to do.
All right, hold on a second.
Now, what is it?
He's full of it, tell him.
All right.
He said you're full of it, too.
That's what my neck is.
OK.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, come on.
Um, what I was going to ask you is, um, I'm going to be by the airy tomorrow.
I'd like to stop by and help critique, uh, great.
The show.
That would be great.
It'd be our first, uh, uninvited guest in a long time.
Listen, as far as that, all the thing goes, I watched the first five minutes.
And as soon as his relatives said, when I was looking at him in his coffin,
and I saw his wig sweating.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I love it.
It was time to change the station.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That wasn't on your hometown station, was it?
Oh, I guess it was.
Oh, hey, listen, I'm telling you, they're just, uh, it's, it's just too much.
I'm, uh, President Kennedy's going to be out with Rick Sanchez tonight.
It's going to be great.
I believe it.
Yeah.
Now, who's past year between the two of those?
Uh, who's got the bigger brain?
That's the question.
Oh, anyway, well, get that other guy off the line.
Is he still on?
I feel pressured.
Why are you now?
I feel like I just swallowed a sorbid.
Good day.
Listen, I'll see you tomorrow then.
Good day.
Good day.
Okay, we got rid of him.
Listen, Dushra, I get off the line.
Yeah.
I listen to you, uh, first of all, uh, first time caller, long time listener.
What do you mean first of all?
You've already been on for like three and a half minutes, uh, you know, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't try to play that game like, well, you know, what I really called about was, uh,
but listen into you since I and Z at night.
Uh, and I really want to thank you for being on the radio every day.
Sure.
Well, I do it just for you.
It's kind of like a pubic service.
Or, uh, it's definitely, by the way, where's our checks, George?
I'll go ahead.
Okay, I listen as far as I was saying about sports at night.
I can't believe that we're two thirds of the way through the baseball season.
Yeah, and they're talking football.
It's all they want to talk about is football and the ugly hurricanes and the dolphins and the, uh, don't have anybody signed yet and, uh,
yaddy, yaddy, yaddy, yaddy.
All you know here is football, football, football, football, it's all they know.
And what's going to happen when the Marlin start?
They're still going to be hockin to try to talk about FSU football and this geek that plays for the,
Gators, who the hell cares, you know what?
And, you know, the thing about it is you turn to the other station and they're talking about, uh, football all over basketball.
Yeah.
It's all a bunch of yahu's you got down here.
Yeah.
Yahu's redneck and douchebag.
They got the wrong ball, sir.
That's a good thing.
Have a great day.
Same old friend, you have a good day.
I'll pass the message.
Thank you.
One in seven Americans suffers from a terrible affliction.
And while others find it funny, to those who have it, it's no laughing matter.
It's called frequent burping syndrome.
It's terrible.
I'll, I'll be on a date or a business meeting and, and, excuse me.
See? See what happens?
I know it's a burping syndrome.
It can ruin your life, but it doesn't have to.
Now there's a clinic that can help trained specialists, sensitive to the needs of the people.
It's a place of compulsive belchers, a special place known as burp-inders.
Gosh, burp-inders saved my life.
Joanne and I were in love.
I really wanted to ask her to marry me, but I just knew that when the moment of truth came, I'd let out with a big ripper.
You know?
Burp-inders.
No shame, no guilt, no more tummy rumbling, smelly belches, no more stopping in mid-sittance to uncoork a big cheesy blaster.
Just carrying professionals and to help you need.
Don't wait. Here's the number to call.
555-2877.
It's 555-Burp-inders.
Call today and stop being so gross.
1217 at WIOD, your gross station for the 90s.
Poppano.
In a meal, I think that movie you refer into was called Wild in the Streets from the late 60s.
That could have been it.
Yeah, he knew that Luke Perian, when he watched it on it, 90210, I think looks a lot like a young Mickey Rourke.
Oh, jeez, oh, I already had my salad. It's already starting to work. It's back in you.
Yeah, I know.
There's the button to fly a spot again.
If he don't look like him.
Hey, did anybody talk about that?
I think he Rourke looks like walking puke.
I hate to put it in such gross terms in the middle of the lunch hour.
Wow. Hey, did anybody talk about that open phone session that he had on the old file?
Maybe it would be a little better of puke on wheels. How would that be?
That would be good.
Puke on legs.
Okay, they had an open phone.
Yeah, and the first guy they called in, F-Bickbee.
Ah, the saline Elvis.
Yeah.
F-Bickbee, hey, you were supposed to call a Howard Stern show today. Why didn't you do it?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
We have an open line at Broward at 524, it's ringing right now so one of the are going to fix that ringer in there by the way
They were going to fix that right now. Well now that we've got line six fixed lets not get carried away
Sunrise
Thank you, you're welcome
This is Elvos, baby. Speedy you from the heavens of gals
There's Eddie
Yeah, I would like to take this time and I think each and every one of you
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Oh, what you doing with me?
Oh, I'm a little okay.
Oh, baby, you know what I mean.
I think you do. I really do. I love you.
Okay, Eric Lambert.
You're a strike just struck out.
Ring the gong on Eric.
What's that little puny I hated that guy?
Chuck Barris.
Get Chuck Barris in here.
We have an open line on our center square now in Brad where Elvis just hung up.
Probably got a call from Bill Bixby.
Ray Waltham was that the guy's name that played to my favorite Martian?
I think so.
Nobody knows nothing.
They're just up said Elvis and Luke Perry.
That's it. That's all anybody knows anymore.
We got the little girls running around screaming Elvis and the older girls and guys
for some bizarre reason looking for a triple cheese pizza with Elvis's picture.
That would be now how come they didn't do that?
How come they didn't get like a pepperoni and black olive pie with the picture of Elvis in it?
Like they do with the shrine of the Immaculate pizza down in the Latin America.
Where they're always coming up with these pizza pies with a virgin Mary's face
and the Jesus and Elvis on it.
Poppano.
Poppano.
Hello?
Yes, sir?
Hey, Neil.
Yeah?
What's going on, man?
How you doing, sir?
Why are you so mysterious?
What?
Are you mysterious?
Nah, not at all.
Oh.
Hey, I just wanted to call you.
Your show's great.
It is great.
Listen to it all the time.
Well, that's good.
Now where's the shot?
Pardon?
I say how you doing today.
Oh, OK.
OK.
I wanted to tell you about this idiot on a morning radio on FM.
He's stealing everything.
Who's that?
Taps and over.
Oh, you know something.
I looked at the trends at the she-morning numbers there.
I had to get to like about the eighth page to find it.
Forget it.
I like to music, and I have to put up with it.
Yeah, call him up and tell him just crank out the hits and shut the hell up
because nobody wants to hear his crazy.
Hey, no idea.
He read a hate letter the other day with the guy following you.
Hey, that's a Reginald Paul.
Keep it up, baby.
You're really doing it.
I wanted to call him a douchebag because I know he's taking notes right now.
Yeah, I know he's listening to you.
Call him a mindless douchebag.
We never had an original brain in his head.
An original piece of what is it?
He has the Andrew Dice Clay thing now, too.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
That's great.
This is incredible.
I listen to him in almost...
Oh!
And tomorrow he's going to have...
Trust me.
And then he's always going to have the next Monday?
Yeah.
Maybe he wants to be the king of morning AM...
I FM can sound effects.
So Juan Carlos Cotex will write about him in the paper.
Well, he tries to make it like your show in the morning when everyone just wants to be...
Forget it, Paul.
You're no talent.
You're on a mediocre station.
Crack out the music and put a lid on it.
Right?
Yeah, really.
Great job, sir.
By the way, I saw Sally in a...
A sporting goods store the other day.
With Elvis?
No.
She's buying a new set of knee packs.
Really?
Yeah.
Wow.
I thought you was buying like matching pair one for her, one for Rick.
And one for Penny.
All right.
What do you want Sally would say about this call?
The I admit it to look like a helmet sometimes.
Have a great day.
Yeah, how are you giving the other day?
You see?
Okay.
Hello, Buenos Diaz.
Yeah.
Listen, enough of Elvis.
Yeah.
Nothing blue, Perry.
Right.
I don't want to...
Let's get down to the real headline.
Let's get a hold of the real stories.
You see who signed as the world's highest paid rock band?
Erosmith.
Can we make a request?
50 million dollars, ladies and gentlemen, a minute.
News.
This is real news.
That's how much the Mucky Junkals pay in Steve Tyler.
50 million a minute.
Can I make a request?
See, the problem is the Erosmith is for like people over the age of ten.
Hmm.
They're so old.
Well, I happen to have right in my thing here.
Dude?
Dude, you're part of the lady dedicated to Steve?
Dedicated to Steve Perry?
No.
Perry?
Luke.
Luke Perry.
Wow.
You hear that?
I'm ready for it.
I'm getting off.
What is it?
Oh, wait a minute.
Hold on.
Is that it?
Are you there?
Do it.
Wait a second.
Ah, geez.
Okay, I'll fiddle with it.
Please.
See ya.
Okay, we're fiddling with it over here.
I'll tell you one thing about MTV, man.
Erosmith is on there like every four minutes.
More than the juicy fruit spot.
And quite frankly, as much as I love Erosmith, I'd rather see this spot.
We have an open-line.
I'm not sure if you can find it on a world-free line.
I'm sorry, but we just got Erosmith rejected by our CD player.
How do you like that?
Boy.
I'll be back on Zeta 4, kid.
I've just got paid.
I have a feeling it's not quite like being on Zeta 4.
A little bit more in the envelope.
1230 at WIOD.
Let's go to Cutler Ridge.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Neil, how you doing?
I'm doing great.
Erosmith Rules, sir.
They suck.
Oh, geez.
I can't believe it.
Oh, my God.
I love Paul Simon.
Let's talk about real things here.
Let's talk about the Braves and the 49ers.
Raven, what'd you say about Paul Simon?
He sucks.
Paul Simon sucks.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Okay, what is it, the Braves?
The Braves and the 49ers.
Braves and the 49ers.
What the hell is one guy to do with the other?
They both kick butt every year.
Yeah.
They both kick butt.
Yeah, the 49ers kick everybody else's.
Yeah.
And the Braves kick their own.
Oh, see the Braves.
Nice talk up, Neil.
Even though he steps all over Paul Simon.
Always step on a short guy like that.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, I'm a short guy too.
I just like to say to say.
How short.
I think.
Okay.
How short.
Where's the decimal point?
At the end.
Okay.
You know, we listen to you when we were in South America.
Yeah, we come on.
Get out of here.
There's the we got you a short wave.
On where?
In South America.
How can you give me a Columbia on short wave?
Because you can get any registration you want in short wave.
Are you serial?
Yeah.
Well, I'll be damned.
Hey, wait a second.
Yes.
To all our drug dealers in Bogota.
Two people told me to listen to this my second day here.
It told me to call.
Yeah.
And how's it been?
It sucks here.
There's nothing to do here.
Oh, there's nothing to do in this time.
At least Columbia's.
Are you from Columbia?
Yeah.
Boy, now let me ask you like in Bogota.
I'm from the West Coast.
Well, you've been to Bogota.
Yeah.
Okay.
Is that like a safe place to go or do you just don't want to ever go there?
If you want to go there, just don't even take your underwear.
Don't take them before they take your pants off.
Are you serial?
Yeah.
Wow.
So in other words, it's a good time.
Yeah, you have a good time.
It's more exciting than here.
Hey, listen.
Anything.
Purgatory is more exciting than here.
I got news for you.
You have a really good show there.
You're damn right.
I keep it up.
Well, thanks.
Listen, have a great life.
Thank you.
See you.
And leave your underwear at the door.
Boy, Columbians, man.
Are they beautiful people?
Aren't they Columbians?
Oh, God, are they good looking people?
I don't know about him, but seriously.
You don't think so?
In other words, you don't want to get close enough to find out.
Hey, that Columbians are not all drug dealers.
Don't start.
They are all.
Okay, Columbians are all drug dealers.
Says George.
Send all your hate letters to George.
George Smith.
Oh, God.
Who's he?
Here's a pay phone in Palm Bay.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I'm doing great today, sir.
We're just, we got a full schedule today, man.
Take us all the way up till midnight.
That's good.
And George is back.
George is back.
That's why we're full of vinegar and something.
Yeah, but he's been in that Alex.
He's a little twerk, Alex.
Alex was a little.
Alex was okay except when Adam was in the middle of the night.
And he was in here hitting on him.
Hey, he was supposed to send me a picture and a bumper sticker and he never did it.
Who was?
Alex.
Yeah, he, well, he's waiting for his own pictures.
Yeah, he took all the information down now.
I'm going to get a hate mail.
Well, screw him.
Yeah, send me the picture.
George, George will take the info down next week.
Willie, hey, I got an interpretation for you for the, uh,
Oh, I know I'm going to have to, I can tell I'm going to dump this.
It's nice.
Yeah, I can, I can just tell.
I can just tell by the side of your guy.
It's a good one.
It's called Turtle Talk, right?
It's a something that we used to talk, okay?
Turtle Talk, isn't like stick it in and out like a turtle.
Okay, I'll see you off the, off the, off the, off the, off the, coffee.
What do you think of that?
Well, that's, uh, not bad.
The mouthful.
Yeah.
I couldn't have put it better myself.
Okay, wait a minute.
Did you, did you hear that laugh?
Not bad.
On the hand, man.
Keep working out of pal.
That's what Peewee said.
Have a great day.
All right, bye.
See ya.
Bye.
Palm Bay.
We must be putting out more than five watts today, huh?
God, we're just smoking today.
It's incredible.
I, I just, uh, wife and said, you know, it's just hard to figure this place out.
It's just some days you sit here and you have, you wonder if there's anybody out there
alive.
Today we're getting calls from Colombians, no less, trying to make drug deals on the radio.
And judging from the sound of some of the colors they've already been working the outside,
26 till 1 at WIOD.
That is the best record of all time, by the way.
I'm not going to be carrying on like those little girls throwing their panties in the
Macy's Mall.
Gonna be a bunch of old stone guys throwing their underpants at the Paul Simon.
And then of course at 9, we've got to watch Beverly Hills 2903456786.
Wonderful.
Larry Bessler watches that show.
You know, I wish I had some idea where I put all this stuff, you know.
I have just some, see, I found it.
I have a general idea like in which rack anyway, right Larry?
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.
Yeah.
Now what is it, Beverly Hills 9021?
1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 2, and 10, 11.
There we go.
We got to watch that at 9.
And then for the really desperate, horny young girls out there and maybe some others
if they get, see, I'm not, I don't care about Dylan or whatever the hell his name is.
Let's have the other guy and with our, hey, I wouldn't care who was on with our
senior, if Pat Peterson and the juicy food people run their stark naked, I don't
think I could bring myself to watch our senior.
Oh, God.
I mean that, there are no words to describe it.
The plasticness, the phoniness, the crappiness, exactly.
Just stick a telephone pole down your throat and gag forever.
I mean, forget it.
There about is cool as a rats, a rat passing gas in the sewer in a hot July day in Paris.
Excellent job.
Speaking of that, let's talk about pizza law.
Man, I'm telling you there is nothing.
Well, hey Jeff.
