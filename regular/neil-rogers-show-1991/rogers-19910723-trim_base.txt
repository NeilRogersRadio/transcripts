of the people and I had a good fortune in meeting my husband. Well wasn't that nice?
It turned out to be beautiful. Well that's great we married 38 couples off my dating show.
Is that exciting? Well we married almost six seven years. Well congratulations.
She was strictly because his friend heard your show and we were not on a double date and
that's how I met my husband and I just wanted to thank you and said that it was a big thing for
people who were very lonely at that time. Well that's great. I don't know why it went off. Well it
just kind of ran the course you know it's just there's a time and a place for everything and
now of course we got a lot of other people trying to do the same thing and turn it into a
pornographic dating shows and all of that crap but now while I was widowed and he was widowed
and I guess we were just right looking for something. Well that's great. I wanted to thank you
because it wasn't for you I never would have met him. Aren't you nice? And after all this time
and you still haven't tried to get through a couple of times ever could but anyway thank you
and thank you and keep you well. Lots more years to you. Thank you. See you. Okay bye bye.

Pizza Loft we're going to be up there 7 to 10 pm. It's going to be great we're going to be for
charity only of course for our Vietnam veterans to get that van that they desperately need.

see you tonight you'll be there yeah great what's your name Christine Christine I'll be looking forward
to see you see it bye isn't that nice we're gonna have a big crowd up there tonight in spite of
Jeff Cohen's hysteria over the fact that while he was away screwing around an acapulco or
wherever the hell it was we had a you know a couple of Sarah's over here a couple of times okay big
deal don't get all psychotic and the reason he's psychotic and neurotic is because Denenberg handles his
account you know he's like a Mexican jumping bean and heat which is why Jeff probably went to
Mexico in the first place W I O D yeah I talked to Neil hold on a second I'm not talking on that line
here's a mobile in Miami on that terrible connection hello Neil yes sir good morning how are you
you saw a connection when I picked it up was really bad listen yes fireport yes
they're on those kids out there could clear up their complexion as fast as your phone line cleared
up we'd have a great world listen on the Rick and such show yesterday the guy that does the
enough of the sucking calls so hard me what is it the guy that does the enough of the sucking call
yes yeah the Rick and such and he's the same guy that does the godfather and Michael Jackson did
you know that enough of the sucking no I didn't know that he did it and supposedly he said this
is finial and they recorded it and everything so I've reconciled what where is it I don't know
if he must have taken it at whatever I don't know oh boy and he said enough of the second he
and he said it pretty much close to what it was the first time and this is turning it to be a
marathon you know you would think that he would have been able to do it the 56 times we had him cut
it that other day last week but I think it was more relaxed yesterday and I know I heard Rick telling
whoever you know supposed to record the show did you record did you get that did you get that
well we don't have it so much to be in Marvin because Marvin never gets anything but they said they
got it yeah I'm saying but it's not on a cart not that I see unless they're hiding it somewhere
as before they probably want to get money you rent some money or something for it yeah well
I'm gonna make them an even swap they can have oh my lord they can have that I'll see you tonight
a pizza lot okay they care guys later well it's about time we got to the bottom of the barrel here
I mean the bottom of some of these questions now have you been handed anything yet I'm playing with
my nose not bad don't start asking a lot of personal questions that wasn't too bad let me hear
I'd got a queue up again I just got through playing it and off for the stocky that's pretty close
ah close not that and the board goes back it's not it it is it but since you are on the phone
I want to know what Corey was doing in here again yesterday that was the most disgraceful the only
thing worse than that was after William Shatner was on yeah and you sucked around with him for a
and at the end of the call I thought you were going to kiss and run off and get married in the
Tahoe or somewhere and then all of a sudden after really he was only on a half hour and he
wouldn't take any calls he said douchebag and he slipped slide it around that thing on Saturday night
live about get a life and a spineless and try to promote his new stinky movie why didn't you tell him
that why didn't you tell him that why didn't you do a Chuck Meyer rats on soupi sales routine okay
we need some people in the station with some balls I think you'll be it on so close to Hank I think
it's starting to rub off this kissy kissy with all the guests okay I'm going to rip it some ass okay
this town is talking to a man who's still asleep is not very effective that's true that's true although
maybe subliminally it'll sink in well you know I mean he was still let's get back to Corey again
what the hell was he doing on here I thought we were going to you know talk about the song the guy
gets on he said we don't need to talk about it he's been promoing it and suck it around and
siphoning off airtime for months on it now and hanging around here like he owns the place the
fact that we played it you know and then he comes up with this crap well what's it gets on the FM
state it'll really take off yeah better than then us okay we don't have three and a half minutes
to waste I'm crap like oh man well we're in the video what's not in the video oh that's why
you're sucking around huh well the video gets produced we'll probably have to do that and off of
yeah see now we got it on two carts we can play it back to back like an endless loop forever
tooling sucking you're on the video well isn't that great that in 40 cents will get you about a half
a cup of coffee at Wolfie's actually bringing out something to send them home oh great I'm
serious somebody stole a balls in this joint I'm telling you that right now okay so William
Shatner's on the phone and you're gonna tell him he's a whole is that and he's a jerk and he's a
yes I wouldn't have had him on the first place what that's sad to talk to him about that yeah that
star Trek stuff is turmeric you know let me tell you something I've thought about this many times
because such as like an overgrown infant okay we all know that including him but science
it overgrown science fiction undergrown ingrown science fiction is for young adolescent males like
when you're like 11 13 14 15 years old and then you outgrow it because you realize it's a lot of
hookahs focus it's like Santa Claus and God and of tooth fairy it's a budget crap yeah and then
you go on to bigger and better things okay like sex I mean you know you you outgrow science fiction
it's for kids it's for young males well why don't you have a little father to son talk with him I
don't have anything to do with that show that's your job that's your show well you know I'm just an
appendage to your show you're letting the tail wag the dog is what it sounds like to me because
I'm a nice guy no because you're a wimp not a nice guy because you have no gonads pal well I thought
it my you got it anyway you lost a lot of weight now I realize it extended beyond just a waistline
buddy let me tell you that right now Jeff can't see the force for the trees left his
a pistachio not cups in here for you you're right he says the full fits you are going to
beat a lot tonight okay well that's right you will be there I forgot to mention that yeah everybody
can just take a look for themselves and see that I'm right that this man is shriveling away maybe
I'll get some gonads now and refuse the appearance Jeff brought you some back from Mexico and he said
that's no bull either yeah so I I don't like your card yeah by here that Cory on here on this
station one more time I'm burning the building down no I'm going to call the investigative team
next to our channel seven and have them come here and root it out you're right with their
with their Sally Fizz roto router not just because you say so I learned yesterday boy I did just come

kept promoy go out tomorrow the stadium and the stuff will be on sale and marlin t-shirts and
bapabab and we still haven't seen anything over here yet well there's don't Stalin now far
sports the part of the if our sports department was on the ball if they weren't so damn worried about
hurricane football in the middle of july they'd be over there and they'd have a whole bunch of that
stuff over here for us to rave about and promote and talk about and whip up some enthusiasm and
get everybody into the swing of it speaking of your friend with them they're busy swinging it
works by season tickets hey I don't know where that fat douchebag is don't ask me do you have your

dolphin tickets that have like he's impaled somewhere inside of his body they're impacted yeah okay
you know they have that expression about your brains are fried because it's so hot down here

in the morning worst sick and tired of the news on this station that's why we're just yanking it
right off the billboard okay this is just your weather and traffic station now no more news because

management I'll tell you that I think he ought to pay W.I.O.D. for being on here he ought to be banned
from the property we ought to have like a 24 hour security guard if he comes anywhere near this
place that had just card him off with cement shoes yeah that commercial you just had on last
break that guy was going yeah okay I think that that sounds like half the audience every time they
hear that cori on here I think you could have a point I think you're on to something I think
maybe you're just on something I think they'd rather have a bout with I mean we've tried everything
we know to try to give this guy a life and to try to legitimize this embarrassing crappy rap thing
that he did and it's it's sucks okay I hope so and then he then he tries to legitimize it by saying
he's going to give a part of the proceeds to Camilo's house well where I'd he never discussed that
with me not that I'm the spokesman for Camilo's house but it's interesting how he tries to siphon
that in there so like we'll legitimize him and put him on and put up with this crap I'd like to see
if he really does you notice how Eric Lambert just disappeared from the human race remember him
with two live Jews remember that yeah he was he was a star for about six minutes and he was on
with Regis and Kathy Lee and on MTV and he disappeared like he never existed okay like stepping
