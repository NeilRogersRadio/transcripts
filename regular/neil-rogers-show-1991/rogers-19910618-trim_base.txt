A chicken farmer went out when dark and windy day
By the crew he rested as he went along his way
Lullin' once a rotten egg hit him in the eye
It was a sight he dreaded
Ghost chickens in this guy
A farmer had raced chickens since he was 24
Working for the colonel for 30 years or more
Killing all those chickens and sending them to fry
Now they want revenge
Ghost chickens in this guy
Everybody come up!
What, what, what, what?
The pigs were black and shiny either as we're burning red
They had no meat or feathers, these chickens were dead
They picked a farmer up and he died by the claw
They cooked a extra crispy meal
And ate him in close line
Everybody!
Ghost chickens in this guy
All the chicken all the time
I think chicken describes adequately some of the people call this show today
Here's a fact we just received two Mike Disney

in Miami hello what's happening now okay I have a little blue head by report yes the other day
I'm not a burger king on about a hundred and eighty of street in college can I ask you a question
sure because I look on a screen here it says old guy in Miami I nobody even asked me where I was
from or you know it sound like an old guy to me 27 years old guy well it's pretty old I guess
to George I mean you're like a couple years older and he is I didn't even talk to George well
that said okay anyways how'd you get on hold I don't know I just I just called up and all
some I'm on hold nobody talked to me or any when did you call about 20 minutes ago and you've
got on already yeah good okay so that means I'm out of it's Burger King it's a 180 street in
Collins and I'm waiting for my food and there's an old guy up there and he's ordering his food
and he's ordering for like his grandchildren I guess the entire family and he's up there and the
guy brings him his order the he's like he's yellow and he's complaining or whatever the guy
brings him his order and he looks at it and he goes this is not what I ordered and the Burger King
dude looks at him and says sir just where it says on the ticket and he goes well I don't know
about you but you sound like some stupid idiotic jerk I was on the floor no swear to guys are you
serial on the floor in the oil I was no was it him was it the bridge tender I was afraid to ask
and this guy he looked like he was right homicidal that's the word on blue I have a good day
thanks pal man I wonder if it sounded just like
I don't know about you but you sound like some stupid idiotic jerk I shatter before I beat
the crap out of you 20 after one at WIO Miami yeah hey how's going it's going okay I was wondering
if you were able to see the um planetary alignment over the weekend the I was watching some ballgame
and they were showing like mercury right on top of Uranus I mean they were like right next to
each other right right well I don't know I don't think the weather was that um do you think that
explains the behavior of the people today perhaps well could have something to do with it maybe
somebody broke their thermometer in hell and there because I always hear these astrologers
astrologers saying like mercury is in Uranus right right which ought to be painful I would think
well anyway I was going to give some advice to some people who might have had some trouble
with the telescope like we did yeah well there's a small grass refructor on the inside of it
right by the eyepiece and the thing is we're working well we're reaching rivals from Boston here
and go to school it up are you uh thing is real oh you've got a telescope over there I
you're probably like looking through the dorm windows across the way I know right right right so
what you see anything good yeah well anyway we're looking through it we can't see anything come
to find out you have to take apart the inside piece right near the eyepiece and there's a small
grass refructor there uh-huh and that came loose from the um from the glue that was holding it together
and um this well you know it's uh it could it could happen so in other words it's like an
instructional call today I say anybody else has the same bad experience exactly you know it's uh I
mean when you're really desperate and you've got it aimed just at the right window where you know
there's always something really hot going on and then all of a sudden you can't see a damn thing
right okay I see where you're coming from yeah have a good day well wait a minute wait a minute
it was that like a nervous affair well like we finally discovered why you're in and no but nobody
just runs around with a telescope well we we had brought it because of the um alignment
here you know I know the alignment you wanted to see which one was on top okay right well it only
happens every hundred yes you know huh it only happens every 120 years right that's what a lot of
our callers say have a great day pal right see yeah boy who's he kidding four-letter deal
the top of the I'm up in pomp and oh now and the hell how's it going
congratulations here you're making some serious progress by the end of Rick and Spud you ought to
be out of this god for second state a little bit a little bit a little bit first I got a blue
there and then I got a question for the answer man yeah start out with up and this is a real good
one now gal pulls then she cuts off full lanes of traffic to cut into a gas station gets out at the
pumps to fill up her car and old blue here this is up in in pomp and oh now and she just leaves the
car and gear gets out in the car just drives across the parking lot on a phone a rat
dashes into a concrete wall stupid idiot yeah it was kind of I stopped at the grade but just
stopped to watch this thing however as it happened um question for you I'm planning a phenomenal
trip I'm going out the Vegas for five days over labor day lucky you that's going to be the spot

those are the three teams we can beat every now and then yeah that's it oh is up there last
week it really feels so the um other cubs take two out of three from the giant yeah so what a
what a fantastic place where we feel a lot of fun see that's the thing people don't understand
even when we get the crap knocked out of us which is often it's still fun and people here can't
relate to that I mean I mean my team right the giants were losing it and actually we had a great time
just a fantastic place to drive way back my beyond the hood this first career hall
see and we lost the game but it was exciting oh then to add to it we had dinner at the night

the great man himself yeah he's spent a lot of time there and he was as the evening went on he
was well into his his his bedwizer more and more and more and more and he becomes rudder and
redder it was an interesting phenomenon yeah and um it was just really interesting by the way

if you don't take a large group uh we went there around eight o'clock and and they told us that
the front of two hour wait they got us in about an hour and ten minutes yeah there there are a
I would don't want to generalize but a lot of the really good restaurants like scusies up there
they're really a tiny restaurant they don't take reservations and usually have to wait about an hour
it's yeah and it's worth it though yeah no you know you're on an hour's worth of memorabilia
on the walls all the different photos and I'll tell you another restaurant I love is the palm down
there right on the lake sure boy that palm is great steaks and lobster yeah yeah um well we had a
great time and told that you have a great time when you go up there and uh I guess I maybe the
giants will will be able to well maybe they'll finish 500 at best but like you say the bottom
line is it doesn't really matter if they win or lose it's just just having a great time it's going
