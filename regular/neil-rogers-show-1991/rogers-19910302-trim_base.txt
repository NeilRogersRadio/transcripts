Best of Rodgers highlights of previously broadcast Neil Rodgers programs.
The opinions of the hosts, guest or callers, are not necessarily those of this station or its advertisers.
Now, the best of Neil with your host, Neil Rodgers, a news talk radio, 610-WIOD.
Right now, for the game show where politicians question the answers they came up with
and the last three years, it's election jeopardy.
And now, here's your host, Alex Q. Popper.
Thank you for returning today for final jeopardy as our reigning champion, George Bush.
Are you ready to risk all you've earned so far, George?
Yeah, I'm gone for brawl.
Sort of like the over-taxed middle class.
Now, wait.
All right, here's your answer.
The reason George Bush could lose in 1992.
Oh, J. Swindler, Selena, Ron Bumtsin.
Well, now, well, he didn't like you the first time you know how well.
Is that all I say?
No, I got the nightmare on the session's split.
Wait, I got it.
All right, George, let's see what you got.
No, new idea.
One more question please.
Oh, you mean like, why don't I have any new ideas?
Yeah, I do.
Hey, this guy called voting audiences decided your time's up.
Why?
Run the Wellington.
Come here, it's Joe.
And this list is called the election jeopardy.
Here's the lady in the gables.
Hello.
Yes, ma'am.
Neil.
Yes.
Your favorite person.
My favorite person?
Yeah.
Orlando, your voice is chill.
No, I hope you know I meant well with the Veele.
Neil.
Oh, is this Johnny Dark's sister?
No, this is the animal rights person.
The animal rights?
You were not the animal rights person the other day with the Veele lady.
What's that guy do with animal rights?
Well, what does that mean animal rights?
What does that mean?
Just like they say human rights or, you know,
Well, since when do animals have rights?
Since they feel just like we do.
No, that's what they feel that rhymes with Veele and Neil.
That's what I said.
Next Veele on a squeal.
And I think it would delicious Veele.
Let's everybody go out and have a Veele Parmesan sandwich for lunch today.
Neil.
The door has a good one.
Veele?
I guess you took it personally, but anyway, I just want to do it.
I didn't take it personally at all.
Why in no respect?
I just want you to know.
You really want to take it personally.
No, you did not mean well.
You're just a conniving bitch trying to tell everybody else what to do.
No, I don't.
I don't think I do not care for as people try to tell me what the hell they do.
I've never tried to tell you what to do.
You told me you came right on the other end and said I've got to change my attitude about this.
I'm not saying you told me you must or else.
Change and every city of God.
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't mean it.
Did.
Did.
No, I didn't.
Did.
No, I didn't.
No.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
See what I mean?
It's true.
It's true.
Let's move on to something else because I'm not going to change my mind.
I like Veele.
I'm going to keep eating it.
I'm going to eat whatever I like.
That's not my business.
You mind your own God's business.
That's not my business.
Nothing illegal about buying Veele, okay?
That's not my business.
I don't want to hear about all the poor baby cows.
There are people out there dying on the street.
Slap the ****.
In your life, have you ever heard anything like that in your life?
Twice.
I had it.
You know, they're making a difference.
But I mean, twice you got it in there.
And back at you, bitch.
Boy, the most obnoxious, the most disgusting.
No wonder she's like,
she's into baby cow.
Certainly nothing human would come close to her.
God.
That call was worse than the other one.
Is the lady in Pembroke Pines?
Hello there.
Hi.
Hi, I'm a long time list, Herobius.
Well, that's great.
I'm 83.
I'll be then.
I've got to be serious.
I received a beautiful, beautiful letter from Harry Somerville.
From who?
Harry Somerville of Camille, I found.
Oh.
And I think you should...
I think I should read this over the air.
No, everybody who adonates gets that and the rest of them don't want to hear about it because they're interested.
Isn't that a damn shame?
Yeah.
It'd be crazy.
95% of them are very close to that lady who called before that they didn't get on the air about it.
Wasn't she a charmer?
She was what you called her.
Exactly.
First class bitch.
Right.
Exactly.
That's why you have to be subjected to...
And I am too.
I think it's disgusting.
There isn't enough money in the free world that anybody should have to sit here and be subjected to cowardly people like her on the phone.
Right.
People who sit behind the anonymity of the telephone and act real bold and brave and spew mong all over the portacola.
It's sad.
It is.
It's sad.
It's sad.
Our generation has come to the point.
That's the voice that it's sad.
It's sad.
Well honey, it's a beautiful letter and you've got credit, the WIOD and the O'Rodgett.
I get credit for nothing.
I get blamed for everything that goes wrong.
I get credit for...
I'm not in this letter.
I get credit.
Well I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about here.
Well.
Everything bad that happens.
I'm behind it.
I'm responsible for it.
I'm a part of it.
I'm like just a loose cannon.
No, you just stay well.
As William Conrad would say, a big loose cannon.
You just stay well honey.
I'm 83 and I hope to live another 510.
Another 110.
Well you sound pretty good to me.
You just take care of yourself.
Okay, and you start.
Thank you.
Bye bye mom.
You're listening to the best of Rogers on NewsDog Radio's.
610 WIOD.
Don't worry, Ben.
Jerry Stix is heading here again just now in the middle of that traffic report.
And sister me, I thought you agreed we weren't going to do the music.
Now then we take a little poll on this the other day in formal poll.
And like we talked to 4 million people and every one of them said we want the music on the traffic.
See, like the list of ship, we got these big numbers in here between 10 and 2.
This particular book and of course I know the books are all full of crap,
but nonetheless I'll take credit for it.
I mean it like stands out.
Like it just jumps out at you.
Those enormous, enormous.
I'll give you an example.
Okay.
Let's do our own horn here for a second.
Okay, you're probably used to that.
Henry's used to tuning his own.
Where the hell are the numbers?
Here we are.
Date parts, 9am to 10am.
The weakest hour of the Henry shows that 9 to 10 hour.
I wonder why?
3.9.
At 10 o'clock we got a 7.7.
Then an 8.1.7.9.7.7.
And a 2, Rick and Suds of 4.6.
So anyway, what I'm trying to say to you is obviously this audience wants the music behind the thing
because it's entertaining, it's amusing.
And now Boy Geary says that the traffic of the people are having a fit.
And they're just to go nuts in there.
But the crybabies is what it is.
And I think, you know, there's a certain time to draw the line in the sand and put your foot down
and say I'm not going to whip out.
And I'm not putting up with that crap.
And like I said, if it's okay to have the drum meets behind the time passed in George Michael, whatever his name is at 5.20 on Channel 4,
then what's a little soft music?
It's about that level.
Behind the traffic to just to kind of spice it up a little bit.
Right?
That's what I say.
I could be wrong.
But I think, like I said, there's a time to draw the line in the sand and don't let the...
once he starts muscling in here, man, then more in trouble, then it won't stop.
Mesh what success.
Screw their traffic, okay?
We could do better traffic, taking it out of a 10 gallon hat like they do the ratings.
I'm not going to make a big issue out of the thing.
I mean, you know, if the people, if the guys, it's a traffic watch patrol.
And not only that, then I get blamed for a day of grave lying, getting canned too.
Okay, that makes it even worse.
I get blamed for that.
He gets fired because he didn't have my support.
I have nothing to say about anything that goes on in his building.
Even on my own show, I have no control over it.
And he's got the emitting a host by to blame me for canning grave lines ass.
That takes some real big ones.
I'll tell you that.
Must have been sleeping with the elephants last night in Stole Appair, Gary.
That's incredible.
That unbelievable?
He got fired because he didn't have my support all these months.
How about the audience's support?
Man, it's just unbelievable.
You know what I mean?
If like a bird drops a big one, I'm one of the upper level management people's car.
It's my fault, okay?
Because the bird was listening to this show and he came like over to the building to give us a message.
Up with the music down with the traffic.
That's what I say.
I mean, I just can't believe it.
And it comes in here like all of it like this is a bulletin.
I mean, we've been doing this for days now, okay?
We had the one newscast that we knuckled under.
And the audience said, we're not putting up with this crap.
We want our music.
Don't we pay BMI and ASCAP big bucks every year so we can play music here on both of these important radio stations?
So anyway, the music's gone.
That's history.
It's official now.
They're putting their feet down, man.
In clay and stone and granite, your music has been stolen on the hourly traffic reports, okay?
So you can all call up Joe Brennan, Mike George, Michael Paxton, whatever his name is, Roberts.
And Tanya Cruz and all the others say, cry, babies.
Cry, babies.
Now, I want to see when Channel 4 takes the drum beats off the news at 520.
That's what I want to see, okay?
How come they don't went by to Channel 4 and kiss up to these guys with their inaccurate grotesque highly overrated embarrassments?
That's the first time I've ever seen something traffic reports.
How come that is?
George?
Oh, excuse me.
Oh, jeez.
This place, I'm Tanya.
See, this is what happens.
The book just, that's the first copy of the book.
We actually had the four hours on this show, like skyrocketing, gigantic, almost enough to give you a little ego,
which in this building is impossible.
And then, man, it's like, okay, let's put that thumb.
Do we have under my thumb by the stones?
Let's play that instead of the news at noon.
We do have it. Is that in there?
Sutsprod in that double stone thing, but I have a feeling it's probably long gone.
I don't see it.
Oh, there it is.
I'll be there, and that's Sutsprod's man.
What a guy.
Always like that, Sutsprod's a lot.
But I bet you that's not on here under my thumb.
There it is. It is on here.
Okay, we're going to play that in lieu of the noon news.
We're playing under my thumb.
It's up to George.
It's his choice.
You're a choice.
You're either pop up the news or the cassette deck.
One or the other.
Oh, my quick.
Yeah.
I mean, this is getting ridiculous now.
It's like somebody just opened up a gigantic, like a big dumpster,
and they turned it upside down, loaded with elephant droppings,
and just turned it upside down on our heads in here today.
As a way of saying, thanks for the great job you're doing for us.
There you go.
Man, I feel like I'm covered with it from head to toe.
Hmm.
Kind of interesting.
Hey, listen, I'm going to knock a lot of it.
They pay me enough. I'll do whatever they want.
Let's go.
I will.
Whatever the hell they want.
They want me to play Chinese polkas here for four hours every day.
If they just keep the checks coming, no problem at all.
Whatever you want, you got it.
Disney.
He does have it.
You can see that.
I'm going to look in his face.
Here's a lady in Miami.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
How you doing?
I'm doing well.
I need some advice on going to the track.
I have never done.
Don't.
No, I just did, Joe.
If you go to Pompo, no, don't sit in the dining room
because Ralph will put your next to a bunch of loud-out obnoxious people.
I think I'm too far away to go to Pompo, no, because I'm in Miami.
No, you're not.
Why is that?
Just go up 95.
Get off an Atlantic Boulevard and make a left, and you're right there.
Well, no, but I thought that Haia Leo is closer and closer.
Well, Haia Leo is closer, but unfortunately it's not open at this time.
So you can go there and see the flamingos.
They're still doing it, but that's it.
Can't lose any money there now.
Well, that way, actually.
Also can't get in.
Both of them said it's no good.
Okay, so if I was what I would like to do.
Come up to Pompo, no, we need your money.
Post time, 730, Monday through Saturday nights.
We need your money.
It's a lot of fun.
Well, how long can you, how long?
It's from 730 until when.
So whenever you want to leave.
When did it close?
The last race is about 1115, 1130.
Okay, and if what I would like to do.
But I mean, they don't like lock the door and lock you in.
They would like to, I'm sure, because they want all your money.
But you can leave whenever you want, like I did the other night.
Well, give me an idea.
In terms of how much money I could.
I don't want to spend lots of money.
I want to bring a visiting guest up there.
Right.
And I don't know how much money I could make.
Make reservation in the clubhouse.
Call my good personal friend Ralph.
And the clubhouse.
Make reservation.
Have a nice dinner up there.
The food is good.
Get the stir fried.
I'm in soup.
How much does dinner generally run?
Oh, maybe 15, 20 bucks.
Okay, so for the two of us, that'd be around $30, $40.
Right.
How much should, if I know absolutely-
You bet $2 a race.
You'll feel for fun.
You say for about $78 races, that'd be $15 a piece.
So that's like, for less than $100, you can go have dinner in a good night.
Okay.
And in terms of the racing since I know nothing about that-
That's the way you're going to win.
Just pick drivers, colors, or horse's names, and just bet to show.
If I like the way I would-
Just to show everybody.
Just bet $2 a show.
Then if they come in for a second or third, you can't.
Okay.
Okay.
Just pick a horse to show.
Okay.
And it won't get a lot back, but at least it'll give you a little something.
It'll be a good introduction.
Yeah.
Just go right up 95 to the Atlantic Boulevard in Palm Pato Beach.
You get off there, go left, and you go to the, uh, to Power Line, and you're right there at the track.
And I can do this for the two of us for around $100.
Less.
I mean, depending on-
I can't control how much you plunge if you get to fever and start going nuts.
Don't call me tomorrow's-
Oh, gee!
I can't help that.
Well, maybe I'll-
I give anything if I would have been there last night.
Man, oh, man, Jeff Gregory with 19.
Bet on Jeff Gregory, okay?
All right.
Jeff Gregory is God.
Okay.
Well, thank you very much.
Okay, good luck.
Bye.
She'd probably go up there and wouldn't like a trifecta for $14,000, and I'll have to hear about it.
My any beach.
Yeah, hey, Neil, I got the fiery port for you.
Yes?
I went across the street and had food at the wonderful Thai restaurant you keep talking about.
Yeah.
And I was sitting at a table with my back to a man, and a voice was real familiar.
And-
You went across the street here?
A carat across the street.
I am, uh, by and by the bay here.
You right.
And I heard this voice order a some young guy soup.
And I turned around and it was Rick Sanchez.
I believe it.
He never stopped talking and he finished a whole bowl within 15 minutes and just never stopped.
Yeah.
Well, you know, he's real original at Ricky Sanchez.
Well, that's why he-
See, the reason that he had to go over there, it's the only place in the area he could walk for lunch.
They won't let him drive.
Right, and he didn't even have a beer with dinner either.
At a boy, Rick, you're putting up now.
That's it.
Thanks for the report.
Okay, thanks now.
This is Newsdog Radio, 610WID, with a vast of Rogers.
You won't miss them at picnic everywhere.
All across the nation,
at a moment of patience,
roasting.
All across the nation,
green beef and the nation,
staying out again.
Not again.
Oh, please do not cry your cats in the forest.
All gables.
Deal.
Yeah.
What's your order?
How you doing?
Uh, K-Passen.
Got a fire report for you.
Yeah.
From Rick Sanchez.
I called you last week, told you that.
You were kind of cry-dressed.
Yeah.
Well, take this out.
He-
A couple of my friends are coming over to my house,
in the-
In two cars.
Yeah.
So, he was like six houses away from me.
And uh,
they both pulled down the block,
and they were driving a little fast.
Yeah.
So, I pulled him to my driveway,
and uh, he's come walking from the house and told both of my friends
that there's no way to drive in a residential area.
Yeah.
And uh.
Oh.
He didn't have his little Channel 7 skycam, did he?
No.
I think it's because little kids were playing outside.
Oh, you get so emotional, you know.
Yeah, it's funny.
Every time a pedestrian walks up the causeway here,
like in front of Channel 7 and IOD,
he sticks his head out the window and sings that.
That is just a dish bag.
He's the best.
He doesn't like you very much.
Really?
Yeah.
Why did he tell you that?
No, no. Well, I didn't really talk to him about it.
I don't want him, maybe he might be listening.
Well, how do you know that?
Because, you know, you're always talking about him.
Well, you're right.
He hates me like poison.
But he does listen every day.
He's listening right now.
Oh, well, that's great.
So, you know, bottom is all pretty.
He's listening right now.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, then Rick's answer is your dish bag.
I'm saying, I'm telling you.
Mine, your own business, Rick.
Leave these punks alone, okay?
Get a life.
Jerky zips up and down the block like he's your own road.
Yeah, well, that's right, because he's got the right connections.
Have a great life.
See you.
Oh, man, are they emotional today, huh?
You're confused as to what we're talking about.
You're enjoying the crowd, okay?
We just got so much going on.
Now, we also have a memo here from Boy Geary.
It says it's been determined that Neil Rogers is responsible for the following.
He's even doing stick-nails, doing material, Boy Geary.
Neil Rogers is responsible for the following.
Hot 105's format change.
All traffic tie-ups on 95.
Rick and Sud's bad bits.
Lank-thick coffee breaks at the FCC.
Steve Keynes' birth.
Manuel Noriega's complexion.
Sunny Fox sounding suspiciously more and more like Ronsang John.
Worldwide shortage of snappled.
Sales people asking plastic surgeons for an asshole removal.
Ellis Rubensigo, the demise of the purchase ratings.
St. John's basketball loss.
Not so loud to UM.
Patricia Bowman screaming Michael instead of William.
Forcing WQAM to use a microscope to speed their ratings.
Governor Charles, Waxi's music mix.
Dexter Layton and Zanemplummit.
Alex Betts, talent.
Johnny Carson's retirement.
W.L.Y.S. market dominance.
All losing horses at any race track.
And the firing of Dave Gravelock.
I'm the man from the world.
Sorry, David, it's all my fault.
This is the same programming department that hired Alex Bennett.
That hired Dickie Farkel against my strenuous hysterical opposition.
And anybody really believes that I have anything to do with who works here or not?
Man, it's all my fault.
Here's a lady in Hollywood, hello.
Hi, Neil.
Listen, I'm just calling you about, I don't know if you remember yesterday,
a guy called about parents.
Oh, yeah, he had that yellow thing.
Right.
He had a yellow thing.
You know, if you...
How many worked in the Chinese restaurant?
I hope we're really...
If you decide that you are going to get a bird.
Who said I'm getting a bird?
Where did that come from?
Well, no, because you were talking about yesterday.
And you were pretty impressed with the way that the bird's tossed, right?
That don't mean I'm going to get one.
Well, no, but I was going to say if you decided that you were going to get one.
Yeah.
You could talk to your buddy, K.C.
Okay, C, from the Sunshine Band is a bird man.
He's got like all kinds of birds.
Absolutely.
Yeah, he told me he's seen a bird or two in his time.
I guess so.
That's what he said.
I don't know what he meant by that, but I think I have a pretty good idea.
Yeah, because I think Rick Reed is his manager or was his manager?
Rick Reed?
Rick Green.
Rick Green, I don't know who that is.
I think I'm not sure.
I met him back in 1979 or something like that at Cable Car.
At what?
At Cable Car.
It's a pet store.
Oh, a pet store.
Call Cable Car?
Yeah.
Why would you name a pet store Cable Car?
I have no idea.
But they got...
That's my name in a flower shop, Streetland.
Right?
I don't get it.
You miss it, something.
You know.
It would be like naming a sandwich shop subway.
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Now I understand.
Okay, now I got it.
No, but I met him there with your other buddy Bill Tanner.
Yeah.
And they were there together.
Why do you say my buddy?
Why do you say that?
Well.
Now that he's into this whole mess now, everybody wants to link me.
You'd be like my good close personal friend.
Okay, so...
Am I seen twice in my life?
I'm being...
Not that I'm trying to distance myself.
You do understand, although my feet are moving rapidly.
Right.
Okay.
All right, as I said, I was being suspicious.
Of course.
Okay.
But as I said, you know what?
I don't have any idea what you're talking about.
You started out about getting the bird and about Casey and Big Bird and the yellow bird.
Oh, well, no one knows.
And now we're talking about Tanner and Dancing Your Pants and I don't know what's going on.
Casey's manager was at the cable car with Bill Tanner.
Right.
They were getting Casey a bird.
Well, don't be given that information.
They were at the cable car with Bill Tanner giving Casey the bird.
Oh, this is getting worse by the minute.
You may have to give a deposition on this whole deal.
Uh-oh.
That's a crap.
Am I going to get one of your infamous letters?
No, that's for sure.
Okay.
Well, listen, have a great day and they're a happy bird to you.
Okay, thank you.
Good bird is a happy bird.
Absolutely.
See ya.
Thanks, bye-bye.
That's what the scooting lady would say.
I wonder if bird's food, do you think so?
Fort Lauderdale.
Hey, how you doing?
How are you?
All right.
I just want to call a voice in my opinion that I think the trapper, they think they suck.
I just down with them.
Yeah.
What they should say?
Like a crybaby.
Exactly.
You're going to be a crybaby at least to have something to stand behind.
You know what I'm saying?
They're trying to change the world.
Right.
They're like a bunch of ramen there.
Exactly.
They're busy out there looking for Buddha on the highway.
You should play the cuke you said.
You said that.
Yeah.
Two for the price of one.
They didn't say you couldn't play music.
They didn't say you could point anything else.
Oh, you mean you should play the cuke you'd be on it?
No, it's his five minutes.
Now, Boygary said that the news is his five minutes.
Now, of course, he doesn't realize all the times that certain people I don't want to mention
Elaine or Lisa's name went over the five minutes.
So over the last three years, they owe us about six and a half hours.
He don't understand that.
That's right.
Because I've been keeping track.
They owe us.
They owe you a lot.
You bet.
They owe me their lives, okay?
And what do they do to respond?
They don't even go out.
They wouldn't even walk across the street.
If this was a real class operation with this book that just came out today, Boygary would come in here and
whip the three dollars out of his own stupid wallet and say, I'm going to go across and bring you back to soup.
Just as a way of showing that we do appreciate even as minimal as it is.
That's right.
The writing to down there should all be beat.
Yeah, right.
All right.
Thanks a lot.
Have a great day.
Good call.
Not a good call, a great call from somebody who's got some cajonis there, not like certain people I know in this building.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Yeah, I don't know how you can say anything about the traffic reports.
I could just hear the poetry with those with that.
About the what?
The traffic reports.
West Thursday morning.
I'm coming across 595.
Traffic is beautiful.
And they said there's an accident at 595 and it's unbi-gek.
There was no accident there.
Of course not.
He didn't hear this morning that we're talking about the thing on Alligator Alley and they had the helicopter and it was and then it's heard out there was nothing there either.
But that all over the place.
It just makes stuff up.
Wheel of break.
Yeah.
And there's an accident.
I mean they told me about that accident three minutes before it happened.
Yeah, that's the psychic fact.
Look at that.
And he just got you just cut himself off.
And your phone just died, sir.
Okay.
And I could have told you that about like three seconds before it happened.
Here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale who would go get a suit but she's not close enough.
Yeah, you're right.
Yeah, you would do it for us.
You sound nice.
Yes, sir Wood.
I kneel.
Hi.
With all this bird talk I had this flashback.
I had it two birds like a year ago.
Yeah.
Not so very long.
But you're talking about...
That heart rack is really doing it today.
These two birds when you would the one when you would hold them on your hands.
Yeah.
He would like...
Drops down.
And he would like rub on you.
And I would like to...
It's like a flip one for a two-shot.
You know?
We had a bird here that used to do that.
That's why we had a gear rid of it.
Because like you were talking before but with a bird.
I don't know what he used to do.
Yeah.
Well it probably sounds like school but not all the letters are the same.
But it's a very mind of you that the bird was so crazy.
I hated them.
Yeah.
I've gotten to feel that way too the last couple of years.
I keep my distance.
They're just noisy and messy.
And they can laugh around in that cage and knock all the seeds and their other dropping all around the living room or wherever you got them.
And it's just...
You know, they're kind of useless.
You have one of the nice appetizers sometimes they're not too bad.
I guess I had a scooting bird.
Yeah.
The old scooting bird.
Well you have a great day.
And next time a bird drops up in your hand I'd wash it.
Thank you.
And your hand too.
Have a great life.
It's the best dip rodgers.
And this is News Dark Radio 610 WIOD.
It was a kind of an acknowledgement that the fact that I had a gay life.
And I understood what day 6 was about.
That you know that it was not about you know, a factory at all.
It was about violence and savagery in a lot of senses.
I think one of the things that stunned me when the record was released was suddenly I realized that I just had a lot of fun.
I found a female audience.
Just by being honest about the fact that you know, I have...
I understand.
You know, I understand how gay people feel.
I understand and I identify.
And I know how it feels to be a woman.
I know how it feels to be a woman because I am a woman.
You know, I won't be classified.
It's just a man.
In that book I made it clear.
The magic part.
What's other men is where I'd be.
The magic part.
At Roger's all clear, I come time to stare.
The magic part.
I like his walk and I like his hair.
The magic part.
I watch his tease when he starts.
The magic part.
I just love his magic part.
The magic part.
When we're all too old, I just hold.
The magic part.
He'll lose his grip and drop the soul.
The magic part.
I see him.
I see him.
I see him.
Magic part.
Magic part.
Let's go to a higher lea.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
How you doing, Neil?
Pretty good, sir.
Here's me, Gail.
Hey, Miguel.
Can't pass.
No, that's okay.
I have two problems with what I just got with you.
No more uno?
Hello.
Part of me?
I have a first problem.
I'd like to discuss with you.
I'm Svai.
Drey, who do you fear?
What do you talk to you about?
I'm just talking different languages.
Now it's your biolet multilingual show.
I want to get Sandy Peyton pissed off.
Okay.
I have two problems.
I want to discuss with you.
Yes.
What do you think about the cubist?
Three cubists that went to Cuba.
Now what am I supposed to tell you about that?
I don't know, then.
What are you supposed to say about that?
You think they got executed?
Do I think they did?
How to hell the whine us?
I think the anchors are going to independent.
I don't know.
No.
I had my other problem.
Yeah, it was a wait-a-man.
That's your problem?
No, I really want to know what's going on there.
I want to know who, if you think it.
No, you know, wait a minute.
You see, you want to know if I think?
Well, no, I don't.
You're going to get executed.
No.
I don't know.
How the hell do I know if they're going to get executed?
No.
Well, I hope not.
But how do I know?
Why would you call me as me about whatever I think?
Because I don't.
I don't think that's why I come here and do this show.
I stopped thinking five years ago.
Okay, what's the second question?
I hope it's not as morbid and depressing as that.
Okay, okay.
What do you think about the pros and the kissing club?
There's too many people.
The one?
There's too many people at the kissing club.
You're not one of the kissing club people, are you?
No.
Then how do you know there's too many people?
There's too many people.
There's too many guys.
It's crowded.
It is jammed.
Jammed.
Well, just open the door and say jammedness.
They'll all run out of there like bad out of hell.
Okay.
Have a great life.
Good day.
Boy, this thing with the kissing club, I must be missing something over there.
It's like off in the corner.
You know where the 21st Street parking lot is there?
Across from Wolfees and across from what used to be the 21st Street.
They closed it down to a cinema.
In the corner there, it's where the C-girl used to be.
And there used to be a kosher restaurant.
It's been about hundreds of places called the kitchen club.
And I never knew it had a name.
And all the punky kids who can't squeeze in on South Beach at night.
I guess the kids who were not fashionable enough dressers
and good looking enough to go down on South Beach,
they all go in there.
And they're like jammed in there and they're like lined up.
And I don't know what goes on in there, but according to Little Joey,
probably a little grab ass, huh?
Hollywood, hello.
Hey, what to say on my right up there?
On my line on the computer.
It's just as Hollywood, why is it supposed to say something special?
Yeah.
Like?
This is Jeff, the Mr. Music Kid again.
Who?
You can't remember me this time.
Who?
The Mr. Music Kid.
Mr. Music.
Oh.
Let me tell my colleague we have to explain this.
He's joking.
I'm a bit curious.
Yes, I remember.
It's just having a little, I'll just funnily have Mr. Music.
All right, okay.
I have all those green label cassettes in my house.
Yeah, how'd you like those?
I haven't listened to them yet.
Good, don't.
I save up all that stuff for my retirement.
So in my daughtering years, I can let's say,
oh, listen to all this, isn't this great?
You know, hey, speak with him.
My rock and cheer, rocking on it.
Speaking of cable car.
Yes.
From the last time I called you, I had an eel in my fish tank.
You had an eel in your pants?
Yeah, I called you during the trousers.
I don't want to talk about eels and people with lizards and snakes.
I just, I find that all just.
I just want to tell you he kicked it.
I don't, he won?
He died.
I thought of my cable car.
It just was big quick.
You bought an eel of cable car and it died?
Well, yeah.
Now, Bill Tanna wasn't in there with you, but it was he?
No.
Good.
You just have to be real careful with your water.
You have to be careful with your eel.
Yeah.
Because if your eel gets into some bad stuff, man, it can die on you.
Hey, listen, I got it.
Is that right?
That's a good lesson for all of you.
Puncture out there.
If your eel gets into any bad thing,
it can die right on the spot.
I need to make a disclaimer right now if you don't mind.
About?
Every time I get a chance to call you,
they either let me off or I'm at home sick.
And if you don't mind.
What do you mean they let you off?
I have a day job.
And right now, obviously, I'm at home.
So I called in sick today.
I'm not feeling too good.
And let me come and call you.
I get what do you call, flat, the next day?
You get flat?
Yeah, I go back and I was like,
Oh, you want to sick the call?
Well, you get flaccid the next day?
Yeah, because they listen to you there.
Yeah.
And they're like, oh, you want to sick the call.
So I am sick.
Thank you very much.
You almost stepped on Mick Jagger in the stone.
You do realize that?
I say, you never liked that song?
You never liked under my thumb.
It could be the best record they ever made.
Please keep seeing this face.
Under my thumb.
You know, I do a good job on that or what?
Ooh, boy.
What do you mean you keep seeing this face?
Mick's face.
No, I don't want to see his face.
I like the music.
Okay, I don't want to see his ugly face.
But it just comes up in your mind.
And let's know it does not.
Maybe in your mind it does.
Maybe that's why you're ill-bied.
Yeah.
Okay, I was really broken up a little bit.
I would imagine.
You sound like it.
My wallet was real broken up over that.
I am.
Wow, how much was it?
Oh, let's see.
I think it was just under a 30 bucks.
You went out and spent 30 bucks for a goddamn eel?
Yeah, it was a big more eel.
It was really cool.
It was eating other things in the tank, which I liked.
You know, I put a couple things in there.
You know, they've pited out and all that.
Mr. Music.
Mr. Savist, you must program music on the coast.
Oh, it's a disco.
It's a disco.
It's a wine.
It's a food chain.
Yeah, that's right.
As they eat this.
You can have birds also, which is your topic, I guess.
Yeah, that's our topic today.
Bird talk.
I've had two cockatiels and I've had them for about...
I don't want to get in your personal life.
No.
They're right under cockatiels.
Yeah.
Like a mix.
They're like a...
Yeah, I know what they are.
Okay.
I've had them for about seven years.
And you might want to start off with one of those.
You know, they're nice.
They're not hard to take care of at first.
You know, it's if you like birds and not.
What? A cockatiels?
Peel.
Oh.
They're not even very expensive.
I have a line that is so good, but like I said,
tomorrow's payday.
Have a great day, Mr. Music.
Hey, thank you, Daniel.
Can I call somebody else?
Sure, no problem.
Timothy, Eve, and the bandal.
Who is the last one?
The bandal.
The bandal.
They're all the best people.
Amen.
Thank you.
Feel better, folks.
Feel this.
546.
I'm 610, WIOG.
All the music all the time.
Let's change the format.
Okay, that'll show those three robbers in their finger too, right?
Let's change the format to long cockups and make their lives miserable.
Let's make a most-day we're never born.
As a matter of fact, let's just take over the coast next door
and play some really good music if somebody wants to hear something.
Not bad. I thought that was pretty good.
Here's the payphone and the falls.
Nail.
Yeah. How you doing, sir?
I'm doing okay.
Listen, is it the right, if I say asshole?
No.
I'm serious.
Why?
I like to call two people asshole.
Well, why do you want to do that?
Well, because I think they're very close to you,
and you know them personally.
Oh.
Boy, Yuri.
Boy, Yuri.
Yeah.
And Mike Disney.
Oh.
Big jerk assholes.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
I can't believe what they're doing to your radio show.
Exactly.
They're messing with my life.
That's my opinion.
I'm like Disney.
I'm not going to take it anymore.
Right.
I mean, they go in there and they pull the cart out.
What in the house?
They come in and pull it out.
They tell you what to play, what not to play.
Right.
I mean, that cart, I mean, they go in there and they pull the trowel to trowel's cart.
What are you with?
What are you doing?
Oh.
I don't see anything wrong with that cart.
Right.
You know.
And then they start telling you you can't play music on the trowel.
Right.
And what it'll be next, and then we can't have any sample in the studio.
You know, I know.
No eating on the ear.
And I just really can't.
No phone calls.
No phone calls.
No music.
No carts.
No microphone.
No, see what they're trying to do is they're trying to knock.
Don't you understand?
They're trying to knock my numbers down.
I made my bonus again by a while, and they don't like that.
See, when we originally wrote the contract, the bonus thing was said at a number so high,
they thought they were a wise guy.
They figured no way in the world he's ever going to break a 7-year 25-50.
It just isn't done on an AM station, so they put a ridiculous...
And now I keep breaking it all the time, so you're going to have to pay me these big bucks,
and they don't like that.
Wow.
So they're going to do everything and their power to screw up the show, so everybody stops listening.
They want...
They only want 35 to 100.
Basically, they want people over the age of death listening, because that's safe.
The traffic reports sucks.
Right.
And they're such an embarrassment.
They think that the audience has an IQ of minus infinity.
They do.
They realize...
That's why they have this.
They realize these are the same jerks that do the traffic reports for life.
Right.
For waxy, and they're just as screwed up on those stations.
They have no stations, and it's like...
They may believe like it's their W-I-O-D traffic report.
Yeah.
Like they're fooling somebody.
Like the thing with Mike Roberts and Tom Pasten and Tom Roberts and Mike Pasten.
Like he's fooling like he's yanking our chain.
Like we're so stupid that we don't know it's the same guy, right?
Listen, by the way, I wanted this awesome mention.
I went by...
Wait a minute.
I didn't want you to have an action.
Okay, I don't want to step on his lips.
Run his tongue.
Listen.
I went...
The outback steakhouse over here by the falls is open.
Yes?
And I went by there.
I didn't eat yet.
Why not?
Well, because I have to, you know, get paid first.
Get that walk about soup, man.
Now, I was going to ask you, what is in there?
Because I like...
Got one of those menus, and we'll also take out menus.
Well, you know how it got the name.
When you look in there, you see things that walk about.
No, it's just a joke.
Oh.
Now, there's...
You like cheese soup?
Yes.
You like onion soup?
It all depends what...
Is it just...
Only onions and spices in all of them?
Onions and cheese.
Oh, it is so good.
I'm telling you.
Oh, right.
I'm serious.
Right.
So it's creamy and it's real thick and it's...
You'll die.
You'll wish you had found this years ago.
Well, listen.
I like to make another version of that...
...beijo en la polta.
Yeah, watch yourself.
Okay, no.
And this is...
It's still a Spanish, but it goes this way.
You ready?
Angomucho, beijo en la polta.
Which means I have a lot of chicken in the...
Yeah, that's okay.
That's all right.
And I like that.
You like that.
You like that.
You'll be a star now.
And you can mark this one down too.
And we'll wait this one until your hearts contend.
Okay.
My...
Boy Gary is not just an asshole.
He's a phenomenon.
That's my opinion.
I'm like Disney.
Have a great life.
Thank you.
Okay.
