Now here's Neil Rogers, a new doc radio 610 WIOD.
We're sorry we're not home right now. We thank you for your call.
We are such very people. We love you one and all.
Please leave your name and phone number. We'll call you back with luck.
But if you should hang up to soon, go take a flying.
Hi!
Hi!
Hi! Here we go!
What a fly!
What?
5-2-3!
3-2-1!
3-2-1!
Holy God!
I don't care if I have nothing.
Well it's an old Eskimo trick of how to catch a polar bear.
Now what you do is you go cut a hole in the ice.
Right, right? And then you take little peas and you place them strategically,
four inches apart all the way around the hole.
Right? And a polar bear will crawl up and he'll look at it very much curiosity
as to what is going on there.
Now when he bends over to take a pee, you kick him in the ice hole!
10-17 at WIOD we got a mobile in Miami.
How you doing Neil?
Great!
Big league baseball football basketball big league town now.
And hockey right on the horizon maybe we hope we pray who knows.
I hope so Neil. I'd love to see you do the announcing for you.
No chance. Why not?
Never happen.
I mean it's fun to talk about it but if even if the station gets the games
there is no I'll be given no consideration to do it. They're not a chance in a million.
Let me ask you a question.
I'm too controversial, too many potty mouth words.
Oh, I know.
No I'm serious. They don't want people like that involved in baseball. They really don't.
Answer a question for me because this is your profession.
How do they go about taking people to that?
Do they do auditions? Do you submit tapes? How does that have to do auditions?
People send in millions of tapes.
And whoever is the biggest jock, of course, they have to have like two jocks on a broadcast.
Of course you do understand there would be television and radio.
Right.
And probably not the same people necessarily.
I mean you can go to the bank channel seven and get to TV because they're the only major independent station in the market.
Right.
And they've been just waiting for this day.
Well you're right because when you listen to the Yankee games the people who do the radio are not the people who do it on TV.
Right.
But you know, there are some exceptions.
I mean like here he does three innings on radio in Chicago but generally you're talking different people.
Well I haven't talked to you in a few months because there's really not much for me to call in for but I do.
I do want to say it all, you know, seriously that the first time I ever heard you or heard your voice was when you're doing the UM games
and I was impressed very much then and I think anybody that heard you years ago doing those games.
And I feel this is the truth that it was the best baseball announcing I had ever heard and I was in May.
No further fucking funny.
I say there's no question about it.
No it's true and I remember very clearly that you know you used to do this thing with two outs and a guy on Nondec Circul, he would be next.
Well I stole that from Harry.
Yeah but it was great and it's a shame because I think you'd be just perfect for the job.
I know you'd love to do it.
Yeah.
I mean you really wouldn't if they said no.
But there's no chance.
I'm not going to get myself all wound up about it because there is no chance.
Well I say right now.
I mean I was going to do that one hurricane game with Hank and we could even do one lousy hurricane game and I did those games for six years.
Well you had those tight you know what's over at the University of Miami that's a whole different ball game.
I mean you know this is different and I want to say right now I want to start to give Neil a chance.
Yeah.
You have Neil a chance.
Really?
How about it?
Dream on Cir is Aerosmith would say Dream on.
You have Neil a chance.
That's the key phrase for the day.
Okay let's start a big writing campaign.
I'm serious.
Okay.
You're serious.
People hurt you when you're at the University of Miami say the same thing.
If it's on Merritt alone you've got to get the job.
Yeah but nothing is on Merritt alone.
Ralph Keiner and Fran Healey and LaGuana Range wouldn't be doing the meds games.
Well.
And Bob Murphy who's been dead for 20 years.
Well you know sports broadcasting ain't on Merritt anymore.
And most of the guys who get in are like X-Jocks.
Yeah I think there are some cities where all the announcers are X-Jocks which is really pathetic.
Do you have any of your old tapes from the University of Miami day?
Yeah.
I'd love to hear.
I'd love to hear some of them.
Would you?
You did some of your...
He could have written a letter home before he tagged him out and he just dropped the ball right on the back.
Yeah.
That's fantastic.
Well that was exciting, wasn't it?
Well hey, I'm telling you both fast-farting and excited about it on the radio.
That's right.
Well that's how you build sports casting.
I make a big deal out of it because when I was a kid growing up I was like had a fetish listening to Bob Prince and Mel Allen or Red Barber and Harry and all the great ones.
But now mostly what you've got are a bunch of Jocks who are semi-eliterate and inarticulate and second like McCarve.
All he wants is sit there and second guess every pitch.
I mean it's boring.
Well it's not exciting.
The people upstairs feel that the people out there are getting more from it which is ridiculous because people listen to baseball and the radio no baseball.
Yeah.
And I used to go to University of America and I was going to leave early and go home listening to the radio because I enjoyed it as much in the radio.
Didn't have a chance.
Okay.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Boy major leagues sucking around there.
21 after 10 at WIOD we have one open line that's in Dade County 751, Go Marlins.
It's almost unbelievable isn't it that anything good could happen in this God for a second place it's like a miracle.
And I told you this weeks ago man and he was just talking on his flap of his gums.
I told you this was a done deal Miami and Denver.
Score tied 3-3 in the bottom of the 17th.
One ball and one strike.
Cooms in the wind up in the one one pitch.
Swung on.
Oh baby did he get that baby out of sight.
Eight cream added it.
Revolves to strikes.
There's a try.
If the wind does the hole it up it'll be gone.
It'll be gone.
It'll be gone.
Holy God.
Okay calm down Harry 1025 at WIOD let's go to North Miami Beach.
Good morning Neil.
Yes sir.
I just got back from Houston my hometown I went in there just to watch the met series this weekend.
Nice game last night.
It was great.
Why didn't you see the one last night that's all the first two that we blew in the night.
You realize Houston could have swept the whole series.
Oh yeah very easily.
Seven walks in the night inning in one game and it gave away the other one too.
I mean can't complain about the Astros bullpen because they don't have any.
That's right.
The only head one relief pitcher in a let him go and we got him in the Chicago.
Of course we don't have any chance to bring him any more because we're never close enough.
Late in the game.
Well they played well they're exciting.
I'll tell you this.
Steve Finley maybe the next Andy van's like.
I mean that kid plays the outfit with reckless of bandings hitting 289 now.
Really come on.
Mark Craig Beasio is okay in my book.
There you go.
Next to God almost.
Yeah.
I was in the gallery down there and I was walking by the gungeal store and I thought about my favorite talk show host.
And I went in there and I bought you a few mac anito cigars.
Oh listen to this.
You were telling them bad ones.
Listen to this.
I was ripping the cigars that Al Goldstein sent the other day.
So this morning I get another package from New York FedEx no less.
And I opened it up and it's a whole bunch of white owl in these cheap day nobly cigars.
And a note in it from Al that says this is more your speed cheap pathetic rejects from George Burns.
Well anyway I just I went in there and I got him for you and I got a couple for you and one for George.
And I'll get him to you when I can.
I don't know when I can get over there.
I was going to try to get him to you at miracle game but I'm going to be working late at night.
But anyway I thought you think you might enjoy him and I'll get him to you as soon as I can.
You're a great American.
Thanks Neil.
Thanks.
1027 and WIOD we have open line at day 75.
One let's go to Miami.
Hello.
How you doing?
Okay.
I have a good idea.
Yeah.
Harry Carrey and Neil Rogers calling for the Miami Nailies.
Yeah.
Right.
Well you just played that short part of when you were calling one of the games.
I'm not a real big baseball fan.
But you sounded very good.
I think so.
So it winds up as a double steel.
Shields is thirty third.
Car has third.
And now for the fucking call you sounded great.
You sounded great.
I was thinking I am the best.
Yes.
And let me ask you something.
I have another question before I go.
I'll be honest with me.
Would you prefer calling baseball games or doing what you're doing now?
How long do I have to think about that?
Well by eleven o'clock.
I can give you an answer in about six seconds.
So what's the answer?
Baseball.
Not even close.
All right.
See if this were a different kind of town.
I mean like after days like yesterday.
Did you listen to this show yesterday?
No I was working.
I'm working.
Well everybody else was working yesterday too.
I wouldn't wish that show yesterday on Billy Martin or anybody.
I mean it was just the most every Monday in this town is like talking into a vacuum tube.
I could have a more intelligent conversation with my dogs and often do than I have a Monday's here.
Normally I listened to you a lunch but yesterday for some reason I couldn't.
It was raining outside.
I couldn't get to my car.
Before I go this weekend I'm going to New Orleans.
Have you ever been there?
Oh don't do it.
What a smartly crappy place.
Well I heard it smells this time of the year.
Do you like, are you a big drinker?
Johnny Walker Red.
No I'm not asking you what you drink but I mean are you a big booze sound?
If you are you'll love New Orleans.
If you're not a drunk there's nothing to do there.
It's a crappy town.
What I was trying to do is see if by any chance you've gone there to eat.
If you could recommend any kind of...
No because I haven't been eating for the last year or so.
I'm going there for the...
That sounds funny doesn't it have any?
I mean I haven't been eating in restaurants.
The food there is great.
If you want to eat you want to drink that's a place to do it.
Oh okay I'm working at the restaurant.
Just as long as you don't go outside.
Just as long as you don't walk around.
What a...
Oh really?
A lazy, smarmy dumb place that is.
I mean dumb.
There's a lot of people over there.
He says it smells by this time of the year and he says don't walk alone.
Yeah from February through in November it stinks pretty bad there.
He says don't walk alone.
I thought I didn't think that's the best advice he ever gave you.
Don't walk alone.
Really?
In fact just stay in a hotel maybe they got good room service.
Well we're supposed to have a party Saturday night at Hogshead Saloon.
That's New Orleans alright Hogshead Saloon.
Alright you got it.
I hope to hear you announcing for the Miami baseball team soon.
Okay don't walk alone.
See ya.
We should play and you'll never walk alone by Tony Bennett or somebody.
Oh what a horrible city that is.
There's an open line at day 751 Meng 751 WIOD Fort Lauderdale.
Hey, how you doing?
Great.
I just got a couple requests for Wayne Hazing if he's listening.
Yes sir.
Number one please name the team after Miami and not South Florida.
Yeah that's Miami Marlins.
Yeah well I don't even like Marlins.
Well listen I mean it's better than the Panthers it's better than anything else that they've been tossing around.
Definitely definitely I like to make those myself.
Miami Mico's not a pretty good.
The what?
Miami Mico's Mico's Sharps.
Mico's?
Yeah.
Never heard of a Mico?
Yeah but that's pretty weak.
Oh well.
It's pretty borderline you know like on the edge.
Well Marlins and Dolphins is too close to me and uh Miami definitely South Florida and
maybe not after reaching it.
I don't think I don't cut it.
And the other request is please do not give it the colors after the Dolphins.
Give it another color.
Tell them it's something new.
Dolphins have a weak color and I don't think it will be good on the other side.
Yeah.
How about Marlins with purple polka dots or something?
No actually I was thinking more like taking out to the seminal color.
Oh they got ugly uniform.
Starting to go now.
Yeah they got ugly.
I mean the colors may be okay but the uniforms are really ugly.
Oh yeah they have a couple of other ones.
They got a couple of nice ones.
Same with Miami Hurricanes.
Bad uniforms.
Couple of nice ones.
No they don't have bad uniforms.
Hurricanes?
They got a couple of goons like the away uniform that gray one that says Miami across is nice
and the white one that says Hurricanes across it.
Yeah.
But the one with the orange shirt.
Oh no I agree.
Those are gross.
Yeah those are gross.
Those are like something Charlie Finley would come up with.
Yeah that.
Couple of requests that maybe Wayne that he's listening to think about.
Okay.
Thank you.
See ya.
We love you Wayne.
Not Wayne Arnold.
But we love him too.
By the way he was in here with some more cigars this morning some good ones.
The ones we like since we're very choosy and when they're free we want them to be good.
And he lost 23 pounds Wayne Arnold.
How do you like that?
Because I jumped all over his case and I talked about what a fat sloppy become.
I couldn't tell.
And he got hysterical.
You can't tell.
You still look pretty damn fat to me Wayne.
Cut it out.
Here's a lady in Miami.
Hello.
She's gone.
Hello.
Oh there you are boy.
I was in the cold sweat.
Well that's close enough.
Hello.
Yes ma'am.
I happen to be a long time listener and a first time that I managed to get broodied.
Wow.
Neil I wonder if you know how popular you are as far as being the one to broadcast the game.
Well I think I'm in.
I think it's a lock.
Well I'm really seriously thinking of a writing campaign.
But I mean a real.
Well we don't even know which station is going to get it.
Suppose WINZ gets the rights to the games.
Of course if Channel 7 gets the TV rights I'm right next door here to Channel 7.
They're my best buddies over there.
Oh I know they must love you because you can hide them up in the cell.
Ulrich Sanchez and Sally and Penny.
They're my buddies over there.
No I'm really serious.
Now if you listen to Hank last night or you caught any part of this show you'd be surprised how many people called in.
Not sucking up for you but really to suggest you doing the car.
I only heard a couple of minutes of Hank last night in the car and somebody was saying
that he should do the games with Bob Costas.
Of course Bob Costas gets the game.
I will personally go over there and shoot him because he's the biggest twerp that ever said foot on the face of their costus.
Isn't interested in doing games.
He just wants to make himself the focal point.
Just like during the NBA him and what's his name or doing all these stupid things shooting baskets.
Nobody cares about whether Bob Costas is shooting baskets.
You know it's a Pat Ryan.
Much a crap.
You're right.
People want to see it.
See it always bothers me when he's ex-Jocks or little twerps like Costas who isn't even next to him.
When they want to focus the attention on themselves rather than the game.
That's the big mistake they make.
Nobody gives a damn about Bob Costas.
You're right.
I'm a real sports fanatic and I cannot thank you enough for all the hours of pleasure you gave me when you broadcasted the UN Baseball game.
Well that's when those hurricane broadcasts were exciting if I do say so myself.
They really were.
And you're being a good person.
Not as excited as Joe's a Gaggy but.
Now really you're the fact that you are so controversial.
I think is a plus that me get a drill twice as many listeners.
Well we don't want somebody who's boring in terminal.
We want somebody who'll make it exciting and lively and you know even if it is boring they'll make it.
No that's why we want Neil Rogers.
Right okay.
I'm ready.
My bags are packed.
Okay.
Incredible.
That's what I say.
The infield in one-oh pitch inside almost did roll in with that one.
It's two and a one wider habit is control Bob.
I was in a crowd who's not happy.
Well I guess it sounds like I'm campaigning for it.
There's not a chance it's going to happen.
Okay. There's no chance.
So I don't want people to think I'm on here here campaigning to get the job.
We don't even I mean it's not even to done deal yet.
The owners have to approve the cities and then there will be a frantic bidding war.
And see the thing with the station is because WSB in Atlanta,
one of our sister stations owned by the cocksisters,
has the braves and has had for years.
And evidently either loses or doesn't make any money on it.
Well that's their problem.
Okay. I can't help it that they're stupid up there.
That's not my problem.
So they're not real enthused about getting baseball here.
From what I understand that's the rumor.
I could be wrong.
Hopefully.
I'm wrong.
There's a lady in town.
She's an orthodox Jew.
And she needs to buy bread that is unleavened.
But it's late and she knows that the stores are all closed.
And she really needs to make a sandwich.
And she's buying bread at seven.
He lives.
And the bread is wonderful.
10.55.
I can hear.
Riva really got a feel of very embarrassed on that one.
As he had to ball-weighting for car car was even had...
He wasn't sliding, conceding, being out.
And Riva dropped it right at the back.
Drop this.
Okay. We have an open line in Palm Beach.
655WIOD.
Coral Springs.
I hear a deadly silence on that line, don't you?
That is the deadest sounding line.
Is there somebody on it?
Oh, listen to that.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
You there?
We catch you a little short.
Deal.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
There's a customer came and walked out of that chance.
Hey, listen, the way things are now, don't pass up any customers.
Sir, believe me, the way this economy is.
I thought that was ignorant, but I was playing with that.
That's okay.
Timing was great.
Hey, I nailed it.
Now, you have to stand up for yourself now.
Right.
I want it, and I want it now.
Well, say you want it.
Make everybody make sure you find it.
I do want it.
I've been offered the fucking...
Yeah, I want it.
Don't win back at this one now.
Hey, listen, I've been saying I want it for years and never accomplished much.
I mean, this might be the last rull you have before your...
Before I go to that big talk show booth in the sky, that's right.
Right, this is it.
I want it.
This station...
Let me say it right now.
Let me put it right on the table.
If this station gets Major League Baseball, and I'm not included as one of the announcers, I'm walking.
But don't say that.
Right downstairs to get my check on the way out so I can come back the next morning.
Don't sit back.
Do all this yelling and stuff like you usually do.
You'll be able to complain and make them...
But we don't even have the thing yet.
Don't you understand?
Yeah, it doesn't matter.
Start winding now.
Then it'll get the point.
Yeah, that's right.
And the colors, they're going to definitely be the same as dolphins.
Yeah, they're going to be a variation on the same team.
I don't see anything wrong with that because it kind of fits them with the stadium.
You have to fit them with the stadium.
Well, I see you got all these people who are just belly...
The colors aren't going to be right.
We don't like the team's name.
We don't even know for sure what it is yet.
See, that bothers me.
This should be the most exciting week.
One of the most exciting moments in the history of this entire God forsaken Yahweh town.
And we still got all these people out.
It should be theirs.
It should be that.
The colors should be pink with yellow polka dots.
Who cares?
As long as we got it, right?
The stadium is great.
The stadium is the best.
It is state of the yard.
It's comfortable.
It's beautiful.
It's magnificent.
It's impeccable.
It's in a great location.
You're a driveway.
I mean, I've heard of drive-through fast food places.
But whoever heard of a drive-through stadium, you drive right in there.
I live in Coral Spray.
This is piece of cake on the back.
Exactly.
And it is so nice.
I mean, coming from three river stadiums in Pittsburgh, that was a pain getting in.
Yes, sir.
This is great.
You better have any better than this.
Okay.
I want it, sir.
Okay.
And I want it now.
We ride.
Take me out to the ball game.
Take me out to the crowd.
Fiveies on peanuts and crackers.
I don't care if I ever get back to risk food.
Food for the whole team.
And don't wait.
It's a shame.
No, it's one.
Two.
Three tries.
You're right.
You're right.
Okay.
Hey, Neil.
I'm the guy you love to rip on.
I'm I'm his own.
Scotty man.
Carthard Shields at second.
Nobody out in field.
Drawed away in.
Here's the stretcher.
They two out of row to swing.
And a fly ball.
Well hit the left.
Men's are going back at the fence.
And it is.
Pull me down.
1115 at WIOD.
Let's go to Hollywood.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
What about his baseball fever?
Yeah.
You sound pretty excited about it.
It's great.
Yeah.
Hey, speaking of baseball.
Okay.
Got that one for you here.
What do you do with an elephant with three balls?
Send him to Ripley, I guess.
1115 at WIOD.
Throw another one high and outside.
We have an open line at Broward.
5249463.
Opalaka.
I'm mad at self.
And you're not going to take it anymore.
I don't blame you.
Stayed up.
I was a little while ago said that the Spanish discovered America.
There were people living here when he showed up.
All he did was introduce plague, pestilence, etc.
I bet you he's never even been in Columbus.
Well, yeah.
I just...
I think it makes me crazy when I hear that the Spanish...
Oh, listen, sir.
All this ethnic crap.
I mean, forget about it.
Okay, baseball, there will be everybody.
There will be anglos and Cubans and blacks and whites and grins and purples and Jews and goyem.
There will be all kinds of people, young and old and in between having a great time.
Can hardly wait and we need the monocampane to get you on this announcer.
Yes, sir.
And Richard is a douchebag.
They're not for the fucking...
Have a great day, sir.
Take care.
Okay.
1116 on the voice of the Marlins, 610 WIOD.
Let's just pretend like we already got it.
Kind of a...
You're a news-weather traffic and Marlins and Dolphin station and just general fishing around WIOD.
They've already got the news-weather and traffic up there on the marquee out in front.
Let's get Dumburdo to put Marlins station up there and see if we get a little rise out of somebody, okay?
Come on, Dumburdo.
We got enough letters in the thing yet.
Go on out there and put it up.
Could be his last act, though.
That's my opinion.
I'm Mike Disney.
We're having a great day.
Everybody's in a wonderful mood.
The phones are blazing.
We're actually getting people with IQ bigger than their jock size calling in.
And George tells me, eh, not only am I choking on a cheap cigar from Al Goldstein.
George tells me that it's pouring cats and dogs again.
This is getting old, man.
It is getting ponderous.
God, every stinking day.
And our weather people, they lie like hell.
I'll tell you that this is getting so f***ing ponderous I can't even describe it.
Blighten Beach.
Morning, Neil.
Is it raining by you?
No, it's not. It's cloudy, but it's not raining.
Well, just wait.
I know it happened to me yesterday afternoon.
I got it about three hours after you all did.
You got it about three hours after we did, huh?
Yeah.
Well, that's interesting.
Hopefully you got it early.
But, uh, we wanted.
Couple of things.
I'm going to change the subject before I say something I might have to admit to it.
Okay.
Okay.
First of all, in the dreaded Palm Beach Post this morning, there was an article.
There was a series of questions and answers about the team.
Have they discovered we're getting it yet up there?
Yes, we actually did.
And it made it a great day to work for them.
Good work for the Netscox and newspapers for it.
They're on top of it.
They mentioned that the team colors were probably going to be aqua, white, and some other, as they put it warm color, whatever that means.
Yeah, like Puse.
Right.
Also that, the thing about spring training, that they said that, uh,
High Zingah has some land near Joe Robbie Stadium.
They're speculating they think he might use it.
Well, you mean they would be here?
Yeah.
That would be incredible.
This would be the only team that had spring training, uh, in the same area where they play.
That would be amazing.
It's saving some money.
He's probably doing it.
Wouldn't that be great?
And maybe if he wants to be real nice, if he's got a little change left over, he can build a bigger arena for the hockey team up there and for the heat.
That's right.
And finally, enclosing my nominations for, uh, broadcasters, including yourself.
And someone who has not been mentioned lately, who will be available in that year.
Yeah.
Ernie Harwell.
Oh, great.
How does that sound?
Fantastic.
That would be tremendous.
All right.
Well, that's about all I have.
Thank you, sir.
You're great, America.
OK.
Bye-bye.
1126 at WIOD.
In fact, we could, uh, one of our sponsors could be Brick Oven, because they already have the big, uh, Ernie and the big Neal.
We have an open line in Palm Beach, 655 WIOD.
Let's go to Miami.
Hello.
Hello, Neal.
Yes, sir.
Welcome to the Voice of the Marlin, sir.
Hey, how you doing?
Congratulations on your new job.
Yeah.
I can't wait to start.
We're going to do a mock game tonight just to get practice.
Hey, I'm a first time caller.
I'm 21.
Uh, my brother got me hooked on a show about two months ago.
I really enjoy it.
I'm trying to get my friends to listen to it.
They love it.
They love the cat noises.
They do love it.
They love it.
How about the show?
They love that too.
I'd like that too.
And I'm glad to see that our young people listen to your show.
Millions of them.
Jay and Zah.
I mean, you're one of those who admits to it.
One of the lucky ones.
Hey, let me tell you all this crap about the colors.
Who cares?
Exactly.
Now, here's our kind of caller.
Here's the guy who's got the right altitude, man.
The color could be puke and fluorescent orange.
I don't care.
I'll still be out there going.
Wait a minute.
Puking fluorescent orange.
That sounds pretty good.
I like it myself.
Yeah.
How about the colors?
Hey, that guy with the signs.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, you keep bragging on me, huh?
That guy with the signs.
No, it's just that's just part of life, sir.
It's just part of whatever we're doing here.
Just to go with the flow.
Hey, you know that guy that called about the electronic sign
with the numbers and all that?
Yeah.
At least in my part of town, I know that the jerks would be raising to see
who could get the biggest number on the screen.
Exactly.
Well, they're always comparing big numbers in that part of town.
So far, they're only up to about a four, I think.
No, three.
Oh, wow.
Okay.
So, I just want to tell you to keep up the good work and, you know,
I'll be watching you soon on TV.
Okay.
Okay.
We're ready.
See ya.
Later.
Okay, it's a done deal.
We're doing it.
Now, the question is, should we rip off Harry's shoot?
I do the games like Harry and Steele all of his stuff.
That would be Bush League, but it would be a lot of fun, though.
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
Seven thinning stretch.
Can you see it?
One, two, five, three.
Only one problem.
I'd have to start drinking heavily, I guess.
28 after 11 at WIOD.
Palm Beach.
Look at that.
Well, I'm not going to chew them out, because they probably can't even hear us.
Is it really raining bad again?
Like a deluge from a hell, George said.
He said it's just coming down in buckets.
I think it stopped.
But it may have stopped briefly.
Okay, just long enough to give you a false sense of security.
These weather people in this town.
Did you hear the thing they did to teleport yesterday?
I think it was in the morning.
And one of the guys, great cause, by the way.
One guy was ripping a traffic patrol.
It was absolutely right on target about how they got no clue what's going on.
And another guy was ripping our weather in the morning, with Bob Soeper
that's been recorded from like six years ago on Puraum.
You're right, sir.
We haven't got any idea what the hell the weather is.
We just have like six different carts, and we play any meany, miny, and schmo,
and pick whichever one whichever color looks good.
Look at that, the star line even dropped off at star IOD.
I shouldn't know.
We had a tremendous start, and that's going to peter off.
Four-letter deal.
How you doing, Neil?
Great.
What the hell is Tampa Bay worried about?
Hey, school, man.
They're getting a damn hockey team.
Screw them, that's right.
They want everything over there.
They're lucky they got like high-button shoes over there.
See, it's all I see now.
What a bunch of greedy bastards.
Oh, they're crying in their beard too bad.
Screw them.
You got one thing at a time here.
You know what?
A bunch of last time you were over there.
Oh, geez.
Such a Yahoo place.
It's strictly a blue collar, a Neanderthal, kind of what they're also going to do, kind of place.
What's your bare game, a bare butt game, a football, but that was like eight years ago.
That's Stady Mothers, too, boy.
That's a real piece of work, and it looks like a block of cement that somebody dropped out of the stunt.
Yeah, kind of funny shape.
Yeah.
Anyway, I went to.
What's with this three-plane covers?
Where the hell are these planes when they're calling in?
You know, it's a guy who had a good point there.
Tampa.
Tampa.
Yeah.
On the way, because I, you know, I just, I just, I'm not much.
They're given, they're given like stuff that's going on the Cross-town Expressway in Tampa, an I-4 and 75.
They don't know what's going on here.
Listen, real, in closing, a, a, a fire report on green alligator he still hasn't crossed the finish line yet.
And he's now down to 75.
They're really, they're punching their guts out.
All right, take care.
You too.
6, 10, tough to fire your wing.
This is the show of the tomorrow with you, Rahir.
This is the celebro.
The Ares-Brenk will dust.
Enough of the fucking.
22-till noon at WIOD where it's raining cats and logs.
By the way, the lovely Maria Genero of Channel 6 weather is doing a weather this week because of what's his name Mark McEwan is on vacation on CBS Morning News.
And she's doing a great job.
I have a feeling she may not come back. She's a little bit too good for us.
Two balls, two strikes, two outs.
You know, the Cubs won all the way from their sixth to the roll.
The pits.
Hey, stick them out.
Cubs win.
Cubs win.
They win their sixths and the roll.
As we mark, it picks up his first save.
I can't believe that.
There's a drive right back to my feet.
It's going to be a great time.
Paul Leicard.
Sean Dunster.
Nice home out of the air.
Well, you know, those are all from the distant past.
It's 11.54 at WIOD.
Bointin Beach.
Well, that's the shame about Tampa, huh?
Yeah, that's a rough break, isn't it?
I'm going to lose a lot of sleep over that this weekend.
Yeah, they had their nickname.
They read an ex-picton.
The Yahoo's.
No big night over there is a crystal in the ABC lounge.
That's it.
Big guts for your buddy from life once working there.
God, I hope so.
How about resurrecting his last today for the all the people of Tampa area?
Oh, geez.
This sounds like a request to me, you know what, sir?
I could be wrong.
Maybe I'm prejudging, but it sounds like it's bordering right on the edge of, you know, something.
I don't know where the hell it is.
Where it is.
It's a little bit more fun.
It's a little bit more fun.
It's a little bit more fun.
It's a little bit more fun.
It's a little bit more fun.
It's a little bit more fun.
It's a little bit more fun.

I was born and raised in St. Louis, which means a lot.
I am not.
I am not.
I'm not saying.
Oh, oh, oh, don't start with that.
I'll wait.
Listen, I'm talking about baseball.
It's the man with a cap, ladies and gentlemen.
And I don't mean the Marlins cap.
I was fortunate enough to grow up in a town that had two major league baseball teams.
Yes, the Browns.
The St. Louis Browns.
I mean, you know, they were not really pen and winners a whole lot.
They had one World Series in my memory, which is 1946.
I was the little kid.
I was seven, eight years old, whatever.
But trying to explain the relationship that develops between a community and a major league baseball team,
to somebody who has never experienced that, is like trying to talk about people, maybe, or to somebody who never lived through it.
You just can't do it because there's an emotional tie there that is just beyond words.
And unlike football, which is once a week every Sunday afternoon or Monday night or whatever,
this happens almost on a daily basis.
And you can plug in, plug out, get involved to whatever degree you feel is appropriate.
And just great.
And I think the guy who really deserves an awful lot of credit, well, he guy, obviously, is he's putting what $125 million on the line here.
It's all set and done.
And you can take $125 million, put it in the bank and live very happily forever after on the interest.
So he's really sticking his neck out, eight miles.
And when you look at the fact that a year and a half ago, we didn't have a snowballs chance in hell of having a major league baseball team.
And now we're locked.
It looks like it's going to happen for sure.
That's a big turnaround and a pretty short time frame.
Do you hear what Rick and Judge did?
Or do you hear what you tell it?
Boy, you are just worked up like a lot of cloth.
Well, I'm proud of you.
I am thrilled.
I am happy.
I hope that everybody who has had somewhere in their background the opportunity to share what can happen when you have a major league baseball franchise in your community
is as pleased and thrilled and excited about the possibility as I am because it's just great.
It is great.
It's a best thing that's happened here since the mix.
Thank you, Neil.
That's Mix 105.
Oh, gee, don't start now.
Don't get carried away.
Johnny Jarkle be in here and knock us off the years.
I know you're a big baseball fan.
I was talking to Greg.
You know about it.
He's a big baseball fan.
I'm a big baseball fan.
So I just wanted to share that with you.
Thank you, Rick.
Okay.
Get a new hat.
Never got one.
See ya.
I'm a big baseball fan.
Just wowed up as tight as a drum as a snare drum.
Wasn't he?
Man.
Just on and on.
That's the kind of stuff that we strive for.
I know.
118 at WIO.
That was the real Ricky Tickey ladies and gentlemen.
Man, just flowing it out.
Of course, he's not allowed to say much over there anymore.
So all these FM guys, you know, when they really have something to say, which isn't often, but they come right here to do it.
Cutler Ridge.
I call myself a major douchebag.
Uh-huh.
Now you're going to prove it to us.
Yesterday, uh, I called and you cut, I called myself off.
Yeah.
But first I want to, uh, did it hurt?
Oh, man.
Did it.
But, uh, this bad boy club, the other day you had a caller wanting to know where these stickers were the bad boy club.
Mm-hmm.
Sounds like a bunch of Yahoo's to me.
What about, but that's what it sounds like.
Well, they're not a bunch of Yahoo's.
You know, these little low riders and stuff that they go around in.
Yeah, they got a little rebel flag on their thing.
Yeah, and they got another one called salty dog.
Oh, yeah.
I wonder if that's any, any, uh...
I've seen a few of those.
Something like salt, Peter.
I don't know.
I guess you didn't say that.
But, uh, no, that's in like with the hair.
The caller after said something about the hair and now you call it a porcupine tail.
Yeah.
I cut mine off.
I had one of those for a while.
Yeah, exactly. Then you outgrow it.
You stop being so childish.
Exactly. Like if you're about 10, it's okay.
Well, I had a little girl.
And they liked that?
Oh, they love it.
Yeah, but the problem is they were 10, too.
They what?
I said the problem is they were like 10 or 11, too.
That's a problem.
No, no, no.
But, uh...
Yeah, and...
What do they like about that?
It gives them something to grab onto, is that it?
Well, no. Well, that's not a story with me,
because they got plenty of grab onto it.
I'm sure of that, yeah.
I take care of that part, but it's just for the look.
Uh-huh.
You know, it's a problem.
Well, maybe they got bad eyesight.
I don't know.
But, uh...
First of all, I mean, uh...
Last of all...
Last in closing.
Right.
That, uh...
I hope we...
This team...
Hope it works out.
I hope it does as good as the braves are doing right now.
Yes, sir.
And I'm glad to hear that you're following the braves now.
What do you mean I'm following the braves now?
What did I say that?
Well, because now you're always talking good about them.
Well, because they're playing great.
I try to be honest.
I love the cops, but they suck, okay?
They don't mean I don't love them, and I don't watch them and get, uh...
Heartburn and...
Asterical, but, uh...
You gotta be honest, sir.
One thing I'd like to see is, uh...
Harry Carey...
Come over here and do ours.
Now you're talking.
Now that would be good.
Well, let's take up a collection, okay?
If we get enough Budwizer and take enough money, we can do it.
And, uh...
Little thing from the archives, I just want to tell you, you know,
Them douchebags out there?
Why are you talking about my teeth?
Okay.
And, uh...
In closing.
And closing.
Bye.
See ya.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Wow.
Talk about a multi-faceted call.
That just had everything from A to Z, from soup to nuts, if we can say that.
Okay, 21 till 2.
Let's go to Miami.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
First time caller.
Great.
And, uh...
Well, I don't want to smooth around, but I do have a request.
The number of the fucking...
Right.
Um...
Trying to record the quadricks from Nancy and Ron Reagan,
from Frank Sinatra, but every time you play them in the car,
I'm ideal.
Every time I play, you're in the shower?
In the car.
Oh.
And, um...
So I cannot record, I was just wondering if you can squeeze that out.
Wait, do me, Franky, Panky, is that the one?
Uh, no.
Where he records about Nancy, yeah, Franky, Panky.
Well, what do you mean, no?
Yeah, that's the one.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Because I got it right now.
You do?
I'm ready to do it for you, but if it's the wrong one, that's the end of this, you know?
I bet you have the right one.
B.O.
You sure if you got your thing going?
Uh, it's going.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
Don't do it again, though.
Okay.
One time per life per customer.
Sounds good.
So, yeah.
You think that is this the one he wants?
Bio Records presents Old Blue Eyes on an unauthorized new album called,
Franky, Panky.
When I'm around there,
she just can't say no.
That's why the first lady
has a tram.
Yes, Frank Sinatra is back.
And this time he's in the Lincoln bedroom.
And now your end is near.
And so I draw the bedroom curtain.
Frank Sinatra, the legend, the latch.
Run and Nancy, run and Nancy.
One was snapped while the others and see.
This album is so hot even the Reagans are smoking.
To be, to be, to be, to be, to be.
You'll get bitch crap.
It was a very good rear.
And of course.
And then you go and spoil it all by marrying someone stupid like Run Reagan.
Let me see your moon.
And let me send away the guards.
You'll get a kick out of Franky, Panky.
Available now on busybody records and tapes.
I did harm my way.
Well, I left a little space there at the end because he's taping it.
And I don't want to jump right in there.
Who knows what he's maybe playing it on another radio station.
We don't want to jump on it.
Hi, Alia.
How you doing?
Great.
I'm on a mobile.
And I hate people who drive in hi-alia.
The douchebag that designed hi-alia as an asshole.
Yep. Well listen, they can't even figure out what the names of the streets are.
What they'll you want.
They have to renumber them.
Give me a break.
Like 49th is 103rd and 102nd is 102nd.
Who knows what it is.
The budget crap is what it is, sir.
Yeah, sure is.
Separately.
I got a solution.
We could get this team together here.
All we got to do is get all these eastern airlines machine machines and draft them and start building.
We're working them out.
Okay.
We don't call them wild because we can get some of those airline pilots.
We can call it the Mimey pilots.
Yeah.
Nobody's using that name anymore.
That's true.
That was it.
Okay.
Just want to call it the designer of ILEO-A2.
See ya.
Hey, listen.
They were the Seattle pilots.
I like pilots better than mariners.
Mariners sound like a bunch of old seafaring Cape Cod curmudgeon-like old farts, you know.
Those old salty nasty, surly guys with that Ricky Tiki-capped.
Did you hear that call, by the way?
You didn't hear Ricky Tiki's call.
He was wound up like an alarm clock in heat.
About the baseball thing.
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, how he grew up in St. Louis in the 1820s.
And, oh man, just on and on and on and on.
He got to say more here in three minutes and he gets to say over there in like five years.
Let's go to Pembroke Pines.
Hello?
Mr. Rogers.
Yes, sir.
Hope you and South Ford appreciate what the Godfather has given you now.
Yeah, we do.
Okay.
Now, we know there's a couple of concessions that he made.
It will be named Miami Mafia.
Any wheel control, a concession.
The couple, they threw the two to the end.
There's a two to the end.
There's a two to the end.
200 wheel sleep with the fish.
Okay.
We got it.
143 at WIOD.
We have an open-lined and broiled 524 Tom Hagen is back.
Let's go to North Miami Beach.
Neil.
Yeah.
This is a guy that sent you the mung beans a few weeks ago.
Oh, yeah. They were delicious.
Yeah, I'm sure.
But, Joey Reynolds.
Better for those toads in my backyard.
Just to all of you and under back taking a long rest.
Joey Reynolds spy report.
Uh-huh.
This afternoon, for tonight.
WSRF.
Oh, today's the day, huh?
With special guest Sam Friedman.
Sam Fier?
Sam Far.
Who is Sam Friedman?
Who the hell is that?
Sam.
Another wash-up-
Wash-up old fart?
Yeah, you go.
I am that hemorrhoid now.
That sounds like it.
Yeah.
Today is the day.
It's 430.
It's a big show.
Okay.
We're going to-
I'll be listening with Bated Breath.
I'm sure.
Me too.
I'll get my shirts out just in case.
Okay.
Thanks for the warning, sir.
Yes, sir.
Okay. Speaking of radio celebrities,
you get to say very little while they're pumping out all those cornball hits.
That's not how you bet.
Yeah.
I had to call and tell you about this thing about Larry Kanga.
You know the thing I like about Joey Reynolds the most, though.
What?
He's dying stupid!
Oh, anyway.
This morning I was driving to work.
You can't get CNN up in Coral Springs at four o'clock.
So I was listening to Larry.
Why not?
There's a signal as well, so you can't get it.
CNN.
Oh, you mean CNN radio?
Yeah, I.N.Z.
Oh, God.
Oh, I like to keep informed before going on the area.
But anyway.
When I used to work at I.N.Z.
doing nights, I would drive going home to Pembroke Lakes.
I would drive up the road to Pembroke Road, which is like about, seriously, like about a mile away.
I couldn't hear the station.
It's depressing.
That's like working at surf.
Yeah.
Boy, is he going to be a monster over there?
Well, anyway, last night Larry had Dave Barryard.
That's what I heard, Mr. Historia.
Yeah, right.
And they were chuckling it up and somebody called from Miami and he had to dump them.
And a couple of calls later, someone called from Fort Vododya and said, there must have been Neil Rogers.
Oh, yeah.
And then Larry, what a pony this guy is.
Larry goes, Neil Rogers is a East German radio and...
I don't know what to do with that.
Yeah, right.
And Dave says, oh, yeah, he's on I.N.Z.
He's on there.
He's on talk show.
He goes, Miami, because I thought he was in Fort Vododya.
And Larry says, well, Larry is the same market as if he didn't know.
Yeah.
And then he said, Neil, I haven't seen him in years.
I wouldn't know him if I saw him.
Well, I'm the only guy who weighs 8,000 pounds in town, so I probably stand out.
Well, no, there's a thing.
I talked about contradictory.
Just before he said that, he said, the last time I saw Neil was a pompadot harness track.
And then he proceeded to say, I wouldn't know if I saw him.
Yeah.
Well, the interesting part of it is I've never seen Larry at pompadot harness track.
And of course, he doesn't know anything about the show.
Hi, this is Larry King and they don't come any better than Neil Rogers.
One thing about Larry, he may not be consistent, but he's sure full of crap, you know what?
That's for sure.
Yeah.
I just want to let you know that.
Well, listen, he's got a check in the mail for you for this car.
OK.
If you want to go play basketball tonight with a bullseye.
By the way, hello, hello.
Yeah.
One thing.
Don't panic now.
I'm still here.
If you don't, I took all the couple calls and the show this morning about baseball came up because of the headlines.
And other than you, which I think would be so astronomically revolutionary, you probably won't get the job.
That's right.
But somebody suggested Mel Allen, wouldn't that be great?
And now for the fucking...
Well, I would be great if Mel were still alive, because they have to prep him for 12 weeks before he tapes that this week in baseball.
So if he were still alive, it would be great.
Well, good luck here.
Thank you, Johnny.
Bye-bye later.
OK.
147...
Oh, that Larry King, man, I tell you.
He is a piece of...
I'm going to do it there.
Something.
OK, let's do our last break of the day here while we're still on a good mood and we'll be right back.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
I put one of your...
One of your talking about...
These bridges...
About orange and boats that you talked about earlier?
About what?
Brigers, cars and boats.
Now, we're talking about bridges over the...
...causeway, not the ones in your mouth.
I don't have any of my friends.
OK.
OK. Yeah.
Calm down, sir.
Take a deep breath.
Those are regulated by the United States Corps of Engineers.
You got to choose.
No.
Well, it is.
All bridges over navigable waterways.
See if I knew that I wouldn't have been asking, sir.
But, sir?
I said if I knew the answer to the question I wouldn't have asked it in the first place.
OK.
Well, I'm saying, sir, is that the United States Corps of Engineers are the ones that regulate bridges over navigable waterways.
Over one?
Navigable waterways.
Yes, sir.
OK.
Yeah.
So it's up to them to decide what time the bridges should not be on.
It's open to the marine traffic.
Yes.
And what time should they not be open to marine traffic, sir?
Yes.
I'm telling you that they come up with the times.
Well, what is the time?
I believe it's that rush hour times, sir, that they are not open to marine traffic.
Other than that, they are open to marine traffic.
So in other words, any slump with a boat can come along and back up traffic for two months.
Absolutely correct, sir.
Well, what kind of a communist bunch of crappers there?
That is not a communist bunch of craps.
Sounds like some kind of the end-of-the-all fascist Tommy Pico conspiracy to me.
There's got five people to be used to one boat.
Right.
Exactly.
What a boat is going to stop for five thousand cars?
Is that it?
No, I think that fifty thousand cars ought to stop for one jackass in his boat.
I think that's what they ought to do.
Man, you better know your laws, Mr. Because you sure don't.
That's right.
I suppose you want the man-briggs closed to both sides of the good heart and two.
I want the bridges closed period.
Okay?
I want them closed.
I want the bridge tenter to go home and watch your MTV and get the hell out of our lives.
In other words, you want those bridges closed?
Let them use the junior tunnel, okay?
You know, I'm not the one that has the most of those.
I think they ought to go out into George Washington bridge and jump all of bridge tenters.
How do you like that, sir?
Well, I don't know about you, but you shot like some stupid idiotic jerk.
