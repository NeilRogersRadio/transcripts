The opinions expressed in the comments
by the guest's hosts or callers are not necessarily those of this nation.
Now, here's Neil Rogers on News Dog Radio.
610 WIOD.
Well, this is the Neil!
Not a like to stand on.
It's Democrat Man!
In today's story, Democrat Man and his faithful companion,
Page Boy, are trying to counteract a strange force that is turning Democrats into Republicans.
Where are we watching the tape over and over Democrat Man?
Because we must discover the Bushman's secret power that is ruining the Democratic Party.
He didn't do politics, you're a pretty good job at that already.
Why, Page Boy? Did that buzz in the background?
Yeah!
We wind a tape slowly.
Okay, but I don't think...
Listen, don't keep bad.
Bellisman.
Good.
That's it.
The Bushman is sending some movable messages.
Now, let's turn that off, Page Boy.
We gotta go.
Page Boy, are you okay?
You kinda mean good.
And, well, brilliant.
Oh, no!
Page Boy!
We will us again next time when you're here.
You're not a good guy.
Kinder.
No, no, no.
There's only one thing left to do.
Put in my Ted Kennedy exercise tape.
I'll wrap this to the left.
I'm gonna get top down.
Take this guy so good.
You drive this in, Baby, it drives you.
Yeah, it's got to visit Capri.
So come down, please, make him a jury.
Hurry for the $2000 rebate on Capri.
Yes, yes, yes, this is Capri, you are your king.
Okay, that's for sure, Leuke,
because he just happens to be standing in the other room.

Here's a lady in North Miami Beach.
On the star line, who's gone?
Hello.
Oh, you're there.
Hi, Neil.
How you doing?
Good, how are you?
I'm doing okay.
I want to say happy birthday to you.
Well, isn't that nice?
No, why?
Why?
My birthday's today, I'll tell.
Well, back at you.
All the great people were born on November 5th.
That's what your older said.
How old are you?
How old am I?
49.
My last birthday in the 40s.
Yep.
I'm a quarter of a century.
Now, you're just like a spring chicken.
So what are you going to do today?
What am I going to do while I'm going to do a great show here?
Not, and then I'm going to go to Mommy's for lunch, and that's about it.
Uh-huh.
I'm dead, huh?
Go get my car's emission check.
I went over there yesterday, and the thing is closed on Monday,
which really frosted my brains.
And then paying the wrong week specific place in the city.
Yeah.
I mean, I found it with no problem.
Thanks to the audience.
Give me directions.
I go over to Hyatus Road.
I take a little turn.
I go down to the thing, and I thought, boy, this is great.
There's nobody here.
And guess what?
There was nobody there.
Closed on Monday.
Huh.
I'll remember that.
I'll see that also.
Well, have a great day.
You can do something special today, like go out to dinner or, um,
Yeah.
Go rob a bank?
Yeah, something like that.
I was planning on that.
Good.
Selfie.
Yeah.
But you better hurry up there.
It might not be anything left.
Yeah, somebody beat me to it.
Well, have a great day.
Thank you, Tunele.
Bye-bye.
All right, bye-bye.
1027 at W.Y.D.
Now, for Alan who wrote the facts, she didn't call to get into any great intellectual discussion.
But does he think that she's some kind of a bubble brand that couldn't have a discussion about something more meaningful than Joe Blow is a douchebag?
Shame on you, Alan.
This idea that you have to be one dimensional in life is just a pile of crock.
As some of those right-wing football coaches would say, it's a pile of crock.
Sturt.
Oh, happy birthday, Neil.
Oh, no.
Yes.
Are you, are you in, Stewart?
I'm on my way to the fabulous facility down in West Palm Beach on Flagler Drive, even as we speak.
Oh, great.
Nothing like it.
I would have said a card, but have you seen how much stamps cause these days?
Yeah, I know it.
That's why it's easier to use other people's material to it, comes cheap.
Anyway.
Yes, Lee.
Junior.
28 years ago today.
Yeah.
Alex Bennett was exactly the same age you are now.
No, it's a matter of fact, I've just read the examiner, and the rumor has it that he's still out there in San Francisco.
Oh, no.
And he's getting his jolly's on a trolley and he's like just turned 17 today.
Absolutely.
So maybe he'll find some cheesecake after all.
Well, or some beef cake.
Yeah, things are happening.
That's correct.
You know what?
I heard a speaking of strange things.
Uh-huh.
I heard Stan Major on the Sun Network the other night.
Well, that is pretty strange.
How's he doing?
Well, I just want to say, uh, Stan, don't give up your day job.
Somebody hasn't got a day job.
It's just a joke.
Okay, Lee.
Uh, by the way, Debbie Ellis.
She was supposed to get a job interview with WLS in Chicago.
Yeah.
Uh, five guys from the stock yard, right around her up in the street.
Okay, Lee, hang in there.
I'll keep the piece.
Okay.
Boy, he is out of control today.
Isn't he?
Trent 29 at WIOD.
Let's go to the Coke and a Creek.
Good morning, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Just wanted to call him.
Wish you a happy birthday.
Well, thank you so much.
Thank you.
Uh, for entertainment that you provide to us, Bailey.
And thank you for all you do for our community.
So again, happy birthday and have a terrific day.
Thanks very much.
Thank you very much, Ian.
See, that's the kind of cause we ought to be getting today.
As people are a little more grateful in these little pinheads
slabs out there who have nothing better to do than call and make
good, well, sounds on a radio.
What are they going to get little gratitude in this town, huh?
For all the hard hours of sweating and puking and pouring over
cassette cart tapes.
And by the way, I don't want to pick on Rick Riley again or
Sudd.
In fact, there is a Sudd said to me that on Friday, he was going to go
through and straighten out that the new rack over there.
And I took a whole bunch of carts out for that ill-fated remote we
did Friday to play out there.
So left a whole bunch of slots in there.
What they did is they took a bunch of their stand wherever there was an opening.
They jammed it in there, so to speak.
Now, how are they ever going to find?
Of course, I took them all out and stuck them on the back thing here.
But I mean, how the hell would they ever find them again?
Talk about organization.
You can't complain about theirs because they haven't got any.
It's embarrassing.
It's almost as embarrassing as the fact we got three open lines on the board now.
This is going to be, I can see already the fifth consecutive day of absolute
desperation on this show.
Not for any particular reason, just they're just not in the mood to talk.
They don't want nothing to do with me.
They're upset.
They're angry.
They're hostile.
They're psychotic.
Whatever it is, they just don't want to play the game.
Lighthouse point.
Marit and Peter here, belly ache.
Yeah, pop about this.
Okay, see what I mean?
There we go.
Miami, hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right, all the great people are born on this thing.
Another one?
Yep.
Well, how about that, sir?
What are the odds of that?
I'm telling you.
Pretty slim.
Yeah, I want to wish you had the first day.
Well, thanks a lot.
And I want to wish you had the first day.
We could just do this for four hours.
It beats talking to assholes like Peter that we just don't have the phone.
Wow.
And today is David Duke's first day.
So you're right.
I'm on the greatest people are born on this day.
Yeah.
Very funny.
I'm not kidding.
They all have a great day.
Bye-bye.
Load out your notes.
1031 at WIOD, let's go to Lady in North Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Happy birthday.
Well, thank you.
I feel the same to you by the time of the gold war.
And unfortunately, unfortunately, I'm hooked.
Well, isn't that great?
Thank you.
And isn't it amazing that's how we managed to play a lot of humorous stuff about the war
and still managed to do a lot of serious talk all at the same time on this show for about two months,
which may come as a surprise to Alan the Maven on the Facts machine.
I have the radio on it to work whether my boss might could or not.
I'm sure show.
Bad reception in this area, bad radio, whatever.
In North Miami, you have bad reception?
Yeah.
Well, wait till we get our subcarrier in North in the North Day.
That'll be great.
Yeah.
Well, thank you so much.
Have a great day.
This is great.
The suction man is tremendous.
I'm almost getting the yank bread out of the seat.
1032 at WIOD.
Here's a mobile on I-95.
Yes.
It's Frank.
How are you?
Okay, Frank.
I want to wish you a happy birthday.
My friend.
Thank you so much, my pal.
And I really don't have anything to say.
Just have a great day and enjoy yourself and a happy birthday.
And we'll see you at Poppano Park tomorrow night.
