wrong it's one o eight at w i o d we're gonna take a lot of calls here in this big
one to two hour
and build up to a crescendo to a fever pitch
for rick and putt who are going to be out there uh... doing it
in the parking lot and i was a weather held up yet going to be great because i
was driving home yesterday and uh... what's his name who was just on the phone
who called in from the car who must have been about a half mile behind me i was
i was looking around my head was split spent like linda blare i want to see all
the action
but anyway um...
as we were driving up the road it was just nasty and dank and he was saying what
about a rain out you know
and if it was like it was yesterday by about three good luck to all of us i
good luck to you because i'm not going to be there seventy five seventy five
breezy it's great that's the aquifor cast
it's blowing cold in serisota
let's go to the grove shall we
newton yeah
uh...
native my mom and uh... been away for fifteen years living in Salt Lake city of
all places oh boy you hit all the high spots
well i'll tell you know i guarantee you there's no uh... program like years out
there yeah i'd be big out there for about ten minutes but ten seconds
till donny osman this family came
well done about donny but you know a few years ago they passed a uh...
uh... and a cable decency law
they would have outlawed hbl
and uh... sure why not yeah and uh... the governor
vetoed it uh... good guy
and then uh... let's just pop in for a spot come on out there either
they don't like the thing or anywhere near the waste
well it's later over wrote the veto they took it all the way to the dam supreme
court spent about a million dollars of the taxpayers money for for a waste of
course
but it's interesting though with all the pseudo-piety that goes on and we're
talking about this couple weeks ago all the
almost all of the mass murderers seem to be like in uh... you taught and up in
my uh... but washington state and organ and
you know there's like a whole uh...
thing out there there's like a lane
yeah but he was out there for a while
when he started up their work this way down that's right
he was re-u-ta
he was the only place they actually convicted him for a while and it won't be
calirado uh...
uh... the trial is kind of walked out one day got tired of sitting around there
waiting walked out
the reason i called you was uh... i'd like to get some of this music that you're
playing and take it back to you down shock the hell of some of my friends
well probably in a cassette recorder be a good idea
we're gonna get it
get what
get this music that you're playing
get the music that i'm playing yeah you know like this uh...
one was that
what was the syphilis who and uh...
you know this kind of stuff
yeah we're gonna buy it
working you buy it
yeah don't you sell it
well i don't want to get too personal
no no no the music the music
no we don't sell it now come November first will do our commissar's thing
again but that's a long way off we have a tape every year the best of tape
so this stuff that you're playing is not for sale i'm a story now of course not
you have to have to have your cassette recorder see if you were smart
and that's a big if because you've lived in some bizarre places but when you do
is you take the show every day and then
what is so funny about that
and have somebody
easy and by it but definitely now nothing's easy if it's easy it's no fun
well it's a deal it's uh... pleasure talking to you uh... harder it is the more fun
again
that's okay thanks yeah
well you don't want to listen to me you don't want this stuff is just want
somebody to hand it to him right on a platter you know
we have an open line and date seven five one nine four six three and one on the
starline
star i would be by the way skipper chuck is a good guy he really is the show last
night
that's another story
now the show is good up until he had that stiff on i'm so tired of the station
bringing all these old line farce
that want to talk about how great everything is and all we're doing just fine
and boy it's great having the sidewalks roll up at nine o'clock at night and
chasing all the living and breathing people are
i'll tell you one thing if we didn't have south beach
that's our only and you know maybe the grove if you're one of those people are
floats but
seriously if we have south beach that would be it
we can just roll it up like sand augustine say okay used to be great here
and we can have like monuments on other used to be a lot of stuff going on
over here and what's the big uh... bar where they uh... they used to have the
wet t-shirt contest
the button on the beach and for a lot of other turn that baby down and build
them like probably a nursing home or something for bob cox
and the city commission
well you're gonna need someplace to stay
oh man i'll tell you all that's great hey this is this is fabulous all those
europeans are going to come over here and just go nuts when they find out how
they've been ripped off of the snapple guys on the starline

duress about this must yes quite a bit while somebody was hiding in under
their duress but uh... we finally got a hold of it i'm glad you did enjoy it
good health talk to you later and it's saying to you thanks jerry bye he's
getting to be regular we like that we like our snapple regularity in fact i think
snapple does keep your regular we have an open line at day seven five one it's

no wonder we never get the good stuff we got a right here in our hand so cut the
crap so we got like a whole bunch of fandom jury hellers out there in
radio land i wouldn't be surprised if we have a few more one-sixteen we have
an open line on the starline star snap let's go to the port of Miami hello
now i'll hang it okay straight out
yeah the good news i'm leaving you're leaving that news i'm going to the
hamas oh boy yeah uh-huh who sucked into that deal now i i i work for one of your
favorite people that owns a cruise ship or nine yeah i can't say because he's a
big fan you can't turn it off mm-hmm i'm sure that love those cruise ships boy
and that food can't be done with a stick now that somebody already beat you to it
i shouldn't be saying that kind of stuff because i know
say on what stuff the truth okay let me ask you a question i guess when you work for the
cruise ship lines like they have to lie a lot yeah whatever happened to the island queen
uh probably uh got lost in a cruise ship somewhere
no really probably got lost cruising somewhere
be funny our workles are i said probably got lost cruising somewhere but you stepped all over
me brutally they're like what with your rudder okay anyways well bond voyage
so you're going to the Bahamas yeah for how long just for the weekend just for the weekend
i work for i work for uh don't say them don't say it now i'm not we'll have a great time and have
us some great show and uh love chuck you why don't you just just like i remember one day i was
listening and you were just like ripping them a new ass and like could you just like do that for
no i'm not going to say the same crap all over again it's every done it repetitive and the fact
that it's a bike or rip off in fact this guy i don't you got me started the guy that was on
with skipper upchuck last night i have i think he was a guy from woometko about a 400 year old guy
used to be there skipper chuck too but anyway this guy was going on and on about the well if they
want to gamble we got the cruise ships and they go out in the middle of the wall she and they go
around in the circle all they do is they're floating crap ships and people can gamble if that's
what they like it bap bap baan yada yada and how great it is all the people that come down here can
do that well yeah all the people come down here do that they get on a plane they come down to the
airport here they get in the cab they go over to the port they don't spend one dime in the stinking
town they get on the cruise ship they give these ripoff artists all their money well that's great
that's wonderful yeah they don't leave a dime here they don't create one job in this area they don't
leave one penny for us that's a biggest pile of crap and the only reason the Bahamas even exist
is because the mobsters have kept gambling out of our god for sakin town and the people over there
he had gambling here at landic city would fold up like a prune and the Bahamas would fade off into
the bermuda triangle never to be seen again keep going keep going have a nice day okay
119 at ww idea toadia wasn't going to get worked up about it
i think there ought to be an investigation as to who the powers are that continue to prevent this
community from coming into the real world and offering fun with the sun and making this the
dank depressing monument to stupidity that it is who's the guy that owns the what's the guy
has got all the money one of disney's friends you know the one that's got the billions of dollars
the cruise ship guy come on come on what is his name boy oh boy man i'll tell you do you just keep
going out there folks and getting ripped off and spending all your hard earned bucks okay
now we're not talking about discovery because they're great
a 119 at wiod for lauderdale hello hello yes sir deal i'm strong first sir for me a robert to you what is it
i'm sorry Neil first of all as i said i'm from the Phoenix Valley i've been listening to you for
about two weeks i'm here for about 21 days uh-huh and uh i finally come to the decision that you are
very very good about creating uh in the minds of people a creative power uh i'm impressed with that
anyway why would you call it power 96 pardon i say you're absolutely right
well you make people think and impresses me uh the reason i call something about uh we haven't
talked about or i haven't heard well here's a great video on mtb at salt and pepper salt and pepper
yeah that'd be good yeah country so full of crap man i'm tired of this uh this is a literate uh
crap anyway uh i'm a blumber service plumber have been for some time and i heard the word crap here
quite some time ago yeah from Jonathan crapper uh he designed the first toilet in England about
turning the century right you also invented crapless crap yeah right well what happened uh
would they have decided 20 years later that's big an allendale by the way crapless crap yeah south
beach a little bit little bit but uh they decided that was a worse mistake society ever made but they
had to make the best of it well we don't know what's gonna happen but an interesting point
to the can i ask you a question you may what the hell are you talking about but what am i talking
about yeah well the worst thing that we've gotten probably the best thing that we could have the
plumbing system in the united states there you go now we're talking about something i will say
that boy the plumbing down here is the best except of course in my backyard where i have that swamp
next to the city of plantation oh god so you want to get me started on plumbing okay i've got a
i've got a some plumber i've got like a it's like swill it's horrendous oh god so many places are
just no previously god just standing water i know when i was in service plumbing i
ground is saturated now because they dug this big canyon back there and they can't figure out why
the water don't soak into it anymore oh god for the ground either but san francisco's got the worst
plumbing in the world oh i'm not touching that line sir you're not touching that one now anyway
i the plunger i see plumbing becoming something in the future there's gonna be very creative yeah i
would say that households will be self-sufficient there will be a grid beneath the house this is my
opinion okay but i there'll be a lot of grit beneath the house if we can think about it i think
it can be i think you i think you may rhyme with that but i don't think it's grit well listen it's
been a real educational but we got to move along here all right have a great day take care don't
ever do it again boy oh boy 22 after one at wio d as we build you can feel the tension uh just
building here man you can cut it with uh your little toenail god it's just building up to that now
they're a whole bunch of naked babes out there in the front parking lot you'll have to come buy
to see and by the way don't worry about it because this is the best neighborhood man it's um you
know if you're coming on 95 and you come each done 79 feet don't don't be confused the fact that
there are a bunch of illegal aliens riding in the streets up don't worry about that or the fourth
fire as you see that's just a little gas up there on a causeway and when a bridge is like up in a
year after you get through the railroad tracks it's like it's like an obstacle course it's like
davi road in davi with the railroad tracks and if you don't make the railroad tracks you get the bridge
well it's the same way here on 79th street as you're coming across uh miscane you know first you get
the railroad tracks then of course that's after you get around the 75 big gold uh whatever those
vehicles are you're carrying schlepping stuff behind them that's falling off that they just picked
up out of dumpsters all over the highway and you evade that part of the obstacle course you get
around the attracts and then you finally you think oh here it looks like clear sailing you get past
taco bell there not all of a sudden you get past floors and here's the bridges up in here
oh god i blew it man and the bridge tenters out there having a meeting with the io d executives
is how they're gonna get the bridge up out your head
