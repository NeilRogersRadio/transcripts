to beat the crap that he has.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
People are watching women are staring at their green blue envy.
Oh.
But I'm not sharing something.
Some say his brain lives.
Oh.
Not much going to talk in.
Not much to look at.
But I ain't looking.
His mouth's just a little too much.
His mouth's as far a little too close.
His mouth is just a little too long.
But while they're running,
I will be molting,
tall, thin.
His got a really big trouser trout.
Those girls look screaming at me,
let it out.
His got a really big trouser trout.
I'm fishing for love.
His got a really big trouser trout.
That boy can make me just twist and twist.
And he's got a really big trouser trout.
I'm fishing for love.
His got a really big trouser trout.
His got a really big trouser trout.
His got a really big trouser trout.
His got a really big trouser trout.
Boy, does he have a lot of hoodspot?
You've seen the TV commercials now.
Let Joey Chitwood and his big whales teach you how to do it.
Thank you, mate.
Yeah.
Are you getting the great poo-poo?
Tertivore!
Pull that ring on up.
Oh!
Shoot too far.
After just one week of Joey Chitwood's great poo-poo on stunt-driving school,
you'll be swiping spicy djong with a big rig.
Joey Chitwood, king of the 85 mile per hour condiments washed.
See if you've got what it takes to cut the mustard.
He terrorized you in silence of the land.
Hannibal the Hannibal.
Now he'll tandalize you at Hannibal House.
Yes, Hannibal House, where the food is always flesh.
And now try our new Schmorgas morg.
Featuring all you can eat finger food.
Uh, yeah, I'll have the hand and Swiss on rice.
I want a hot long foot dog.
Hungry for breakfast? Try our 69 cent special.
Scramble legs with French toast.
And I'd like a coffee too, please.
It regular or decapitated.
Uh, never mind.
And don't forget dessert.
Try our world famous hot apple pie.
Ah!
This week order to standard liver and onions with a drink and keep the glasses.
Or a hearing aid.
Even a complete set of dentures.
Why not bring a friend for dinner?
Hannibal House.
Tick tock like mom.
And now it's time for Senator Ted's New Year's party taste.
Happy New Year.
Every New Year has some people all room by.
And responsible friends like myself should step forward and offer helping hands to a fellow party.
Go as if whose judgment may be impaired.
Hey, everybody need a ride home?
No thanks.
I already got one.
Sleep it over.
Another New Year's party tip from Senator Ted.
I'm dying out of here.
What else is new?
Out in Hollywood.
Anything going on?
Yeah, this kind of one sort of disturbing thing.
I saw a pretty woman there.
No, what is called this pretty woman.
I already saw that with Richard Geer.
And I kind of put it off.
I'm not a big Richard Geer fan.
Right.
And I think the thing that really bothers me is that I read now that he wants to play Buddha.
And that's not even...
Does anybody else?
Richard Geer is a Buddha.
He is often described and he would like to play the life story of Buddha.
And that's so horrible.
Miss casting thing.
Which they have a lot out there.
And I'm thinking of Richard Geer as Buddha.
You know, like what's next?
Robbie Benson plays Jesus.
Robbie Benson is the Lord.
Right after you make Guy Burr.
Come on.
Right after you make Guy Burr.
Ricky Schroeder is Mandela.
You love the bit of silver spoons now.
CM is Nelson Mandela.
Right after Matt Laugh.
Jim J. Bollock is Mussolini.
You love them in sequence squares, Hollywood squares.
Now CM has the Italian dictator Mussolini.
Right after Baywise.
Dick Van Patten is no Stradamus.
Right after the Golden Girl.
Oh, geez.
So what I'll be on the next album?
Hardly nowadays, two spags.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

A chicken farmer won't out when dark and windy day
By the crew he rested as he went along his way
Lullin' once a rotten egg hit him in the eye
It was a sight he dreaded
Ghost chickens in this guy
A farmer had raised chickens and he was 24
Working for the colonel for 30 years or more
Killing all those chickens and sending them to fry
Now they want revenge
Ghost chickens in this guy
Everybody put my mind back
The pigs were black and shiny either as we're burning red
They had no meat or feathers
These chickens were dead
They picked a farmer up
And he died by the claw
They cooked a match the crew smooth
And ate him with coslo
Everybody
Fuck, fuck, fuck
Ghost chickens in this guy
Wow, boys this pressure radio or what?

Now I was born in a woody
I'm finding it impossible to
Can see how I'm spotting a woody
I feel like an absolute out of wheel
And so the ghost of the list
He was part one too
Followed him up to the gates of basement
Just to see what he would do
His ghosted face was beaded
As he headed for his room
There's a printer in a ghost
Just waiting for his post
Down in the jungle room
Respawning wood is a man-fess
It's really impossible
To conceal spotting wood is a man-fess
I feel like an absolute out of wheel
Spotting wood isn't man-fess
It's almost impossible to conceal
spotting wood is a man-fess
I feel like an absolute out of wheel

Happy nowadays, douchebags
Here's my story, said my true
About a girl called Sifiliso
Had a bug and ran it around
Gave it to every guy in town
Gave it to me
I didn't know whether you're an airy drip
A part of all will always be with you
So stay away from a Sifiliso
It took a close I should have seen the signs
Smell the scent of a friend of mine
You got it back to now I've got it too
So keep away from a Sifiliso
Keep away from that girl
Hoping a Sifiliso now
Gave it away from soon
She likes to sleep around
Gave it to dinner with my bastard house
We did it then I started to cough
Now I'm afraid it's falling off
Here's the moral of the story from a guy who knows
Used to have a horse where this fungus grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew
A keep away from a Sifiliso
Yeah, keep away from that girl
I don't know what's out of the douchebag
Banging out the douche
Binging out the swords and weather
And the management too
You don't know why this being traps
Yes I'm fool with you
Nest your arches drive the ground with you
Everyday, I'm vain
Nest your arches hushed in the round
And some day the space show
