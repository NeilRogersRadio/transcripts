Fort Lauderdale, our lonely, Broward Call.
Hi Neil, this is Bailey Herman.
How are you doing, Billy?
I'm a good woman, say, I'm silly!
Ha ha ha ha!
Okay.
All the Broward lines open up like a SIV.
524, WIOD, the ladies, we had one lady in that first hour today.
We're like right back, we were yesterday, it's like Desi Rue all over again.
Isn't it?
This is just like an instant replay.
Boca on the award line, hello.
Neil?
Yes.
In honor of Peewee, bring back the lightning round.
Yeah, bring back this, sir.
We need the license, okay?
One open line and Broward, two of them, 524, WIOD, maybe that cloud cover is covering
up in Broward again, maybe they can't hear us.
Or maybe Greg's talking about how he pressed he is in suicidal or wants to quit and
just evades him like poison and everybody in Broward's listening, I don't know.
Hey kids, if you thought Peewee was fun tune in this Saturday morning for Aini's Playhouse.
Drop your eyes, get out of bed, bang, bang, bang, the bed guy said it's time for Aini's Playhouse.
Hi boys and girls, welcome to Aini's Playhouse.
Today's word is oozy, watch.
Wasn't that fun?
Meet some of Aini's friends like Terry the Teradactyl.
Hi Aini.
Hi Terry.
Consider yourself extinct.
Wasn't that fun?
The fun never stops at Aini's Playhouse.
Now, let's go over to the talking head.
Hi head.
Yo.
Okay head, tell us the future.
Okay, your next movie is going to stink.
Oh really?
Okay kids.
Let's sing.
Hi head.
Hi head.
It's time to eat some lead.
Don't know this Saturday morning madness on Aini's Playhouse.
Don't go away.
We'll be by.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Look at those phones popping right off of there during that.
Isn't that amazing?
Man, something to sit here and watch those babies pop off.
Two lines open and Broward, 524 and we were all filled up there for a second or two but
that don't last long.
They're just not with us anymore.
See they hate Rick and Suds and they hate me too but they don't have the gumption to call
in here and say that because they're not listening anymore.
1-800-944-WIOD on our toll free Florida line.
Miami.
Neil.
Yes sir.
Listen, maybe you can tell me if this rumor is true.
Yeah.
Alice Rubin is going to Sarah Thodeur to get him off.
No, I don't want to get into Ellis personal life.
We have an open line at day, 751 and 1 in Broward, 524 and went on the world famous WIOD,
see the world line.
Neil.
Yeah.
I need the P.E. music.
I gotta phone for you.
No, it's going to be something gross.
Everybody's a musician today.
Everybody's a comedian.
This is when a show starts taking a turn for the Worsh.
Oh no, it's not gross.
Oh, okay.
You sure?
Yes.
I know.
Okay.
That's it.
I need it from the beginning.
That's it.
I like to watch movies.
Every time I see a side, I feel like grabbing my sign up.
Him.
I wanted to ask who I to film the next episode.
Oscar Award in Show.
Listen to me here.
That is not smashing anyone because I am in my voice.
Yeah, that is a bunch.
시다 of the record, if someone in my voice would be a unit piece of丁 urban in the
I don't know y'all sound like they're on drugs.
Listen, I owe you apologies.
For what?
For yesterday.
What happened yesterday?
Well, you hung up on me.
I called back and the guy answers and said I said the slang word for-
You didn't say any slang word.
You said a disgusting four-letter grotesque word that begins with SNNs with T.
Uh-huh, right, right.
So would you accept my apology?
No.
Well, I-
This is a radio show.
This is kind of a pornographic payways P house or something.
I didn't know if this is.
Well, I don't care how you're admitted.
You have to be a little more careful when you're on the radio because we live in a fascist
world where everybody's so concerned about words, okay?
Yeah, I know.
I- well, I've listened to you about a handful of times and I've heard other words-
No, they're worried about a handful, too.
That's over in Sarasota or half a handful.
I mean, it's just- it's pathetic.
It's tragic.
It's embarrassing.
And I wasn't pretending.
We live in a fascist, we are the way-
What about with a William Kennedy Smith trial to take time out to worry about these things?
Oh, I know.
When does it start?
I don't know.
No.
But I recently-
And also all of you who don't have a satellite dish-
So anyway, what were you saying?
Oh, boy, I originally called you about the lobster season yesterday.
Oh.
This is not the micronary show.
I'm not interested in lobsters over there.
Oh, that's what I have to call me-
Not interested in fishing or golf or lobsters.
I'm not interested in that.
How about beefball?
What about it?
Well, you told the game that they- he hit the ball and they missed and-
If it opened a lot and groward by the way, 524WID.
What is it?
Hold on a second.
Yep, it's working.
I'm just checking.
Okay.
Well, your team won by the guy missing the ball.
I'm not into baseball, but I know you are.
Well, last year, I don't know what the opposing team was, but the dolphins won a game like that.
The opposing team kicked-
Well, you don't want to go back to last year.
What does that mean?
Oh, nothing.
I had a thrill over it that-
Well, I'm glad you had a thrill, okay.
You know, the thrilling game that they won by them-
I don't know.
I heard something on your show yesterday about the winning-
You know, the guy posting the baseball games-
Hosting the baseball game.
Oh, whatever.
I think your sports knowledge, ma'am, is full of-
Right, you're right.
Like what you said yesterday.
Exactly.
Right.
Well, hey, I told my husband-
The controversy was, anyway, I wanted to call you up when nobody was lighting up your lines yesterday.
Yeah.
So I gave him-
What have I had to break that was?
Yeah, I get home and wait on the line for an hour.
We had a great conversation going-
You were late on the line?
Yeah, and then you got the news going and then I get, you know, shut off because of the-
The, uh, in-a-word.
You know?
The in-a-word?
Hey, I got recommended by my brother-in-law by saying that word to a little kid by accident.
And I just felt bad.
I got recommended by your-
Do you have any idea what you're talking about or you just do-
Like every morning at about 10-
No, I have two children.
I'm lucky there being a white right now.
You have two children?
Yes.
Get HRS on the phone, George, and trace this call immediately.
Okay, well-
Have a great day.
You too.
See ya.
Bye.
Don't ever, ever darken this phone again.
Hey, Billy!
Blow my finger!
Tonight on ABC, it's America's most heavily armed singing sensation, the cartridge family.
I'm sleeping.
There's a prowler in my bedroom.
So I'll spring up in my bed, and I'll pump him full of lead.
I think I'll shoot you.
No seven-day waiting period for this family.
Is surely-
Yes, Rubin?
I've decided to up my feet to 20%.
Come to think of it, ten will be fine.
Then when Danny falls for a rather macho-looking woman,
it's LA law Susan Day to the rescue.
Can't talk my brother, you ACDC Miss Fetter.
Oh!
And you like Godbrok, you'll love the cartridge family.
It's domestic violence and it's musical bass.
Travel along with our business and whistle,
We're here at B.
We're here at B.
The cartridge family.
Tonight on ABC, following the final episode of The Brady Boo.
1126 at Good old WIOD, where we unveil our big new sign out there, man.
I bet you there'd be like millions of people just flocking by crowding the cause way to see that on Friday.
This Sunday night, it's history's funniest home video.
We have a classic clip on the Lincoln family that they fall getting ready.
Hurry up, babe.
We'll be late for the theater.
So late.
What are they gonna do?
Shoot me.
Watch as escape artist Harry Houdini runs into a little trouble at home.
Harry telephone.
He writes down.
Hey, stop it, stop.
I'm not dead.
Woo!
And we'll go all the way back to the Revolutionary War to check out this hilarious video sent in by Mr. Patrick Henry.
Give me liberty.
Oh, give me death.
Death.
I meant death.
Give me liberty or give me death.
Yes, it's history's funniest home videos.
Sunday night at 830, catch you now before it's history.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Hello.
Yes, are we having a problem on the phone today?
No.
Can you hear me?
Just barely.
You can barely hear me?
Just barely.
No, you're, you're full of it.
Okay, look, I have a question.
A couple days ago, you were on the air and somebody started talking about these two books.
And I don't remember which one was called the plumber.
And the other one was called something else.
You're the electrician.
No.
Sins of the, you see, you don't want to listen?
Sorry.
Sins of the father.
Sins of the father?
Yeah.
I meant to write it down.
I was remembering it on the drive home and then I got home with God.
Sins of the father was great.
Which one was better?
Did you read the plumber?
I didn't read the plumber.
No.
I had lunch with Gordon Litty but I'd not read the plumber.
Are you going to waste your time and read it?
Yeah.
Really?
If I can find it.
Huh.
Anything with all this Peewee stuff?
Yeah.
The show is not that good anyway.
It's no great loss.
Really?
Peewee?
Peewees play house?
I'm afraid I don't catch it.
It's not a good, I'd be the set for my neighbor's kids.
It's not a good show anyway.
So who cares?
Well it's something for people to get all excited about, okay?
I guess so.
I suppose it would have been Dan Rather than we really could have gotten into it.
Oh, just...
And if it would have been Dan Rather dressed up as Peewee then we really could have been great.
Would that have been great?
Great.
All right, well that was it.
Well, believe me, read them both.
Read them both?
Kill a lot of good time for you.
Do you know what happened to the author, would you?
No.
Somebody you'll call in.
All right.
Some wise guy who's smarter than we are will call in.
Oh, boy.
Have a great day.
You too, boy.
Cool springs.
I know how you're doing.
Great.
Listen, I just got back in California.
I was in San Francisco.
Yeah.
And I had a video accident.
I turned on and there was Alex Benin on the...
On the tube?
What an ugly fuck.
Oh, what?
Yes, ugly that guy.
And he had a radio...
What did you say the first time in ugly one?
Ugly sucker.
Oh, sucker.
Okay.
Well, my ears are plugged up.
Okay.
Now you're trying to take advantage of me.
I don't know why I asked you to repeat it.
It would have only made it worse, but it could have been interesting.
He had an audience.
Yeah.
Well, at least he's got an audience.
Okay, it's more than I can say.
Well, only a minute.
We got a bunch of deadheads out there.
Oh, boy, we love your audio.
Yeah, a bunch of spastic's is what we got.
Spastic's.
Listen, a couple things.
I don't want to...
I want a quick one, Peewee.
I just want to know one thing.
We lay off a Peewee already for crying out loud.
Jeez, lay off the Peewee.
I just want to know how many crimes were committed while there's police and we're in that theater.
There were probably rapes and murders and arson's and drug deals probably within a 30-foot radius
of where they were peaking.
Peeper.
I know you're being...
No, I'm not.
I'm serious.
No, I'm not.
You are too.
I'm dead serious, but nobody cares because in this country we have a bunch of
hypocrites and everybody's worried about who's touching below the waist.
It's all the biggest bunch of crap I've ever heard in my life.
It really is.
What if they just leave everybody alone for crying out loud?
And I've got to tell you, I've never seen that.
We've got the touch yourself police and the sidewalk police and across the street police.
And oh, yesterday I'm driving at the store on sunrise in plantation and there's the
most pathetic motorcycle pig sitting on a corner of Nabhil and sunrise under a palm tree
waiting for somebody to do something naughty and not nice.
I mean, just a pile of crap just sitting there with a surly red neck look on his face,
give me a break.
Well, you go do something constructive.
Go sit with Peeper yourself.
You know, get out of here.
We broke down some day now on the turnpike and luckily I had a mobile phone.
Yeah.
But I got to tell you, we were there an hour and a one police and came back.
I could tell you how high my blood sugar is right now, sir.
You would probably have a stroke right on the phone just from hearing the number.
My head is swimming.
I feel like Marlena Dietrich on a bad day.
Well, I got that problem.
I feel like Mark Spitz.
Yeah, give me some of that coke.
That'll do it.
Give me a little sugar.
That'll do it, George.
Well, why do they do this to me?
Why don't they stop?
I'm telling you, before 2 o'clock I will find out the name of the person responsible for bringing
that slime ball back here with the food and sicking him on me with that crap that I don't want.
I've screamed.
I've yelled.
I've hollered.
I don't want it.
I can't eat it.
I've been sick, the stressed, the food, and they just keep insisting.
I'm going to sue this place.
I really am.
I'm getting a good crooked lawyer and I'm going to sue the pants off of them for food malpractice.
Listen, one other thing.
As soon as they pay me off, yeah.
How come when you go to a movie theater and you sit behind or in front of these older
people?
I don't know what it is, but it's moving.
Yeah.
It's like you would swear that you need to be in front of older people.
I said, be in front of young people.
Okay.
I'm going to be with you.
They're in the movie with you and they're together and I don't know what it is, but it's
moving.
And then of course you got to find out what it is.
What is it now?
Why is it the older people?
They're together, okay?
But they keep describing the movie to each other as if the other one's not there.
Because they don't care about anybody else.
Don't you understand that, Sonny?
It's their time.
Don't bother them that the only ones that's like on the road, the same thing.
Get out of their way.
It's their time.
Oh, look at that.
Look at that.
I'm watching MTV now so you have to excuse me.
I'm just being a pervert on the radio and I enjoy every second of it.
Okay.
And if it offends anybody up yours, okay?
I'm tired of all you phonies out there with your closet lives.
You make me sick.
Right?
Sir?
Sir?
Yeah, me.
Yeah.
You're not listening to anything I'm saying.
Yeah, I am.
This isn't a conversation.
This is like, I don't know what it is.
Listen, I take luke control.
Do you take anything?
I take luke control also, sir.
Oh, okay.
But unfortunately, when you haven't taken any, I'm not saying I shouldn't eat before noon
anyhow.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
And I've been having a problem and it took me four days to get my sugar down to where
it ought to be this morning, not too bad a level.
And I felt great.
It felt sensational.
You know how it is when your blood sugar gets real high?
Yeah.
And you feel like you're dying over there.
And that's, and then the guy brings the food.
They bring it back here.
Oh, here's some goofball got a bunch of food.
This guy could be like an ax murderer.
I know.
And they just wander back here.
I'm telling you, this place, if they'd ever get their act together and here, and stop
worrying about how much show the billing is, if they'd ever, you know, run a real radio
station, this could be a fun place to be.
It really could have, once upon a time it was for a couple of days, I can't remember when.
And it's tough because it's a matter of money.
What is wrong with them?
They got like 8,000 people here and nobody takes any responsibility.
It's like they're all just shuffling around in the hallway.
Like, where, what's going on?
Where are we going?
Let's, you know, like they're lost.
Like the land of the lost.
Why doesn't somebody assert himself or itself in this place and say, no, we don't just
open up those adraps by the way, George, there's a lot of commotion out there in the hallway.
I think we're going to find out who brought that asshole back here.
Well you have a great day, sir, and keep, uh, what?
Did you bring that person back here?
Stephanie and Gwen?
No, they did not do it, but they did eat some of the food.
Well, I'm not blaming them for that.
Have a great day, sir.
An open line in Broward.
524 pissed.
I am.
I'm just, I'm smoking.
Smoke is coming out of my ears.
This is Tom Brooks, John New York, President Bush House, Paul, a surprise news conference.
We suspect that he may have changed his mind on the Supreme Court nominee.
We now join that news conference, O'Reary and Poverty.
So, in my mind about the previous nominee.
So, instead, I've decided to nominate three women to the Supreme Court.
Right, girls?
You mean it's the three's court?
Hey, this court's a white enough.
It's like this to the white enough.
Everybody's having a listening to you.
Now we're getting down.
You can't turn it off.
No, you just have to wait.
We're too busy singing.
There's no time to measure sleep.
We rock that in the Senate.
Now the wind will black steps in the face.
Probably not.
Let it make me look real good.
No, no, we make fun of.
That should fit.
You have flat.
Yeah, well, Diana, I've got the same flat than B flat.
Don't you get me.
I just need some way.
Yeah, well, Diana, you out of the band.
No, you wait on right now.
This is your own bull job.
I'll soon meet.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Another IOD emergency staff meeting ladies and gentlemen
to address the serious problem of these male contents,
these miscreants, these slime balls that muscle their way
into the building mysteriously with arm loads,
butt loads and truck loads of food,
WIOD deer field.
It's the wonderful day in the neighborhood.
Can you say master bait?
Sure you can.
How's it going Neil?
I am telling you, man, the whole world is so riled up by this.
It's just incredible.
Isn't it wild?
I think it's about time for somebody to take this into hand
and get a hold of it.
That's right.
Before it gets out of control.
You know, thanks for your show today.
It's a relief, a lot of stress for me.
I know you.
Yeah, I'm sure that that's great.
The meantime, I'm going to have another stroke here on the air.
People are taking up office pools right now all over town to see what time it happens.
Yeah.
Well anyway, Neil, you're the greatest.
That's a good one.
See ya.
And I'll put it in the corner.
Open line and Broward, 524 WIOD.
My head is swimming.
I feel like Gertrude Italy.
On our way across the English Channel, as in what channel are you on?
Hey, A.
Open line and Broward, 524 WIOD.
Let's get some women on this phone.
Let's get some living and breathing people WIOD.
Hi.
You don't sound like a woman.
I'm the most good thing.
Would you like to dress up like one?
I do, at least.
Okay.
Listen, I wanted to say,
and bear with me a P.
We would say.
Uh, even more P.
We material, more P.
We material.
Look guys in there, wankin' it.
What do you leave them alone, will ya?
This isn't about P.
We are.
This isn't about one of those.
No, but I mean, what is everybody?
You know what it reminds me of?
It's like, uh, it's like the thing I touched myself.
It's like this song, like these little punky kids that are listening to Power Night.
They just invented that.
You know, they just discovered it.
We discovered it a long time ago, kids, okay?
I didn't have to sing a song about it.
I think even though the crack addicts are running rampant and throwing elephant turns through the windows in a water deal.
Yes?
Yanking people's arteries and chains from their necks.
Yes?
I think it's just great that Nick Novorow took the time to go in and brush that lady for having sex in her own bedroom.
I want you to find me.
And I think if he gets Rick Sandchest for his press agent, he could probably make the next Supreme Court nomination.
Yes, sir.
Good stop, oh pig.
Right, you got it, pal.
Heinrich Himmler lives.
I hope these people wake up before they wake up one morning and realize that they're not going to be here.
When they get that new Supreme Court justice confirmed, I be right wing.
That'll really a cap it all off.
I don't think they can get any further than a right.
They're going to make a round circuit.
Right.
Look, those around comes around.
You got it.
Listen, keep up the good work.
Keep your passport handed.
I'm going to try.
See you.
And your trench coat.
1242 at WIOD.
See, that's our motto for this week.
Keep your passport in one hand and your trench coat in the other.
Can't get in too much trouble that way.
It's the Pillsbury Du Bois.
He looks more like the Pillsbury Du Bois if you do.
I'll say that.
Poppin' still.
What a day.
Do you want to start at one?
Oh, man.
You got a lot of cars.
Yeah, 1 a.m.
How come they're giving it a nice and quiet?
How come they're giving the time on the Channel 4 news now at 5 o'clock?
And it odoses.
It's 5 minutes after 8.
It was actually 508, but he can't read the clock too well.
Really?
Why are they giving the time?
I can't see that.
There's another chance to screw up.
Well, that's not a clue.
People call it and rip you to your face.
Oh, right.
I don't like that.
I'm ripping behind the back.
Really?
And so what if you are divorced?
I mean, I exactly.
I don't understand what the first of all is.
It's nice they send their condolences.
It's nobody's damn business number one.
Secondly, most of you idiots, if you're not divorced,
now you will be by the end of the week.
And what's the big deal about it?
Like it's somebody's business out there, and all of a sudden
you used to be an ice guy.
Right.
You know I got a divorce.
Yeah.
15 years.
Oh, man.
Next thing you'll be walking around with a trench coat.
Fort Lauderdale.
Neil.
Yeah.
How you doing, buddy?
I'll go into it.
Good.
I want to say something about the big property.
Or we turned to the blue lagoon as coming any day in a theater near you.
Boy.
Neil.
Oh, some hats.
Thank you so much.
I thought that was food for just a second.
Oh, sir, I want to tell you you almost just were a part of a radio accident.
Wow.
The young lady from Florida just came by and she had a bag.
Yeah.
And I thought there was more food in it.
And I was just about ready to have a cardiac arrest.
We were going to make a cardiac arrest.
I want to get off the P. We hermit, sir.
I want to get off the P. We hermit for a minute.
Who was on them?
Oh, these are florist pizza hats.
What does that mean?
Okay, go ahead, sir.
I'm sorry.
We're very confused over here.
People on South Florida stock.
Yes, we know that.
Last week, this is my first time to be able to call since last week.
Some guys called up.
Yeah.
Some guy called up and he was a bitch and already about the hats for the Miami Marlin.
And they weren't even out yet.
I know.
He just was looking for something to bitch about.
I know it.
And the amazing thing to me, the one legitimate gripe they've got all through the years,
I hear all these belliacs about the stadium in the parking.
The one legitimate gripe that they have, which we talked about the other day,
about the price for the exhibition games being ridiculous.
And you would think that we were commonistas now because we said that.
I mean, that's a legitimate, right?
I know.
It's a beautiful stadium.
We got a great team and the support all of this.
But for a crappy exhibition game, those prices are ridiculous.
And we have the audacity to say that.
Now we're bad guys.
Okay.
I don't understand this type of guys.
Oh, yeah.
Are you serious?
Do boy?
I went on and on.
I'm a dump boy.
I know.
I did too.
It's ridiculous.
What is?
Any people are just looking for something?
I'm behind the dolphins as much as anybody.
You've got to cry it out loud.
You got to, you know, call it as it is.
You don't care about the dolphins, sir.
Who?
You.
I love my dolphins.
I love my dolphins.
Cheerleaders.
Well, that's part of the packet.
Yeah.
Let's get to the meat of the man who got the crap.
All right, Ross.
I am divorced, you know.
Relatively speaking, how?
He wouldn't know Dan Moreno from Marinara Sauce.
Go ahead.
How?
He does make a good Marinara Sauce.
Yeah, he does in that restaurant.
Yeah.
I wish he'd change his lips, though.
Sure.
Call her otherwise.
Yeah.
That Joker look with those lips has got to go, Danny.
What is it, sir?
Relatively speaking, how quick will the Marlins be?
Will they improve faster than heatwell, being a new franchise?
He probably, yes.
Yeah.
Oh, definitely.
Good, definitely.
Because it's a whole different ball game.
I mean, you know, baseball is different than basketball.
They'll be competitive within your lifetime, not mine.
Yeah.
Good.
Thanks for the call, Neil.
Okay, we'll call you again.
Neil, you're a great American.
I know.
See you.
Okay.
He's doing all of my lines.
Boy, oh boy.
I see I got all screwed up right off the bat this morning because it's Tuesday and Grave Line was over at the mailbox, pilfering stuff.
And I thought it was Wednesday.
And now I don't know what the hell's going on.
But you got nice hands.
And then I ate that.
We got, thank you, Flores, for the nice hats.
They're nice people over there.
They're great.
They're wonderful people.
And they're not a pain in the ass and they don't bug us and they don't send food.
Well, we don't want it when we do want it.
They do, boy.
Holy cow.
It might be.
It could be.
It's the one to two hour with Neil Roberts.
And now back to chicken's deputy and your host, Alex Fabiz.
We move on now to double jeopardy.
Penny, you had the low score at the end of the last round.
Choose a category please.
Extra terrestrials for 200.
It makes strange noises in the chicken coop late at night.
Yes, bonus.
Frank Perdue, no.
Cajun.
No, what is a poultry guy?
A poultry guy.
Penny, you still have control of the board.
To beak or not to beak for 600.
He was the star of the Omen.
Bonus.
Correct.
We'll return with my own chicken, jeopardy.
Where a category will be choking the pecker.
Right at this.
106 at WIOD, the Marlon caps, understand her in the building.
Incredible.
We have an open line at Broward, 524 WIOD and one on the star line at star IOD.
The
All the way from Deerfield Beach.
Here's a gentleman with a Marlon cap.
What is that thing that he's got on the trailer?
I don't know what it is.
Boy.
Yeah.
But it's moving.
I can't believe it.
What is that candle?
As soon as I got off the phone with you, Veggie called me.
Oh, Veggie from Bocca sent us over a candle.
Look at that.
I hope that Lord doesn't see that.
And some great caps here.
Some Marlon caps.
Let me be the first one to grab it.
Look at that.
Not bad.
Commemorative July of something your other 1991-19th Florida Marlins.
Thank you, sir.
A gentleman in the scholar.
I'll leave these to your discreet.
Thank you.
Great.
Thanks a lot.
Appreciate it.
You almost got one over by Rick Sanchez.
Well, it would have been worth it.
You made the five o'clock anyway.
Thanks a lot.
And thanks to Veggie from Bocca.
Look at these beautiful flowers with a nice little note.
Some nice boogan velias or whatever.
I know nothing about flying.
And a couple of pansies over there.
Some flowers, too.
Open line on the star line at star IOD.
It's as hope things get better in this God for second town.
You light up our lives.
Veggie from Bocca from Strictly Roses, Flourist and Flowers.
1335 South Federal Highway in Deerfield, Sweet One.
And I noticed that Alex just came in here and appropriated for himself
a whole bunch of Marlon caps.
What is it?
One's for me and one's for Mitch.
It's just a joke.
When you relax, man, these people are so uptight.
See, the audience thinks it's me.
This is just a radio show all the way and pissed about the food thing.
But God, you people are so sensitive.
I wish you ought to come in here and do the show just one day.
Like Rick Raleigh comes in.
Oh, he called me Don't Boy.
Don't Boy because he's upset about the, you wanted to guys in the bikinis.
I don't care what you got in bikinis.
Okay.
Ring dogs in bikinis.
I could give a crap.
All right.
Everybody is so damn uptight and so full of crap in this town.
Why don't you lighten up and have a good time?
Stop being so concerned about your masculinity and you women too.
Let's go to Kendall.
Hello.
How you doing, Neil?
Just great.
Neil, why in the world do Channel 7 have Sally Fitz do a bit on Pee Wee?
Well, maybe the story fits.
Maybe the story fits.
She was shaking in her seat.
I'll bet.
Did you see it?
No.
Well, I just wanted to.
Was she carrying a trench coat?
Maybe there's a little more there than meets the eyes, sir.
She might have had it under the counter, I don't know.
You never know.
Well, I just wanted to see if anybody knew what was going on with that.
I'm closing a light to call somebody douchebag.
Yeah.
May I?
Yes.
You don't have to ask me.
Okay.
Miami.
Hey, Don't Boy.
Do Boy.
He's not in here.
He's out in the hall.
How are you today?
He's taking orders.
Neil, you have a major sugar problem.
And I have the cure.
Yeah.
Get the salt shaker, unscrew the top, and pour it down your throat.
Five minutes, your pH balance will be normal.
Okay.
And as far as Peewee, I think we need to start a defense fund.
Yeah.
Lend Peewee a hand.
Right.
Lend Peewee a hand.
Outstanding.
See you later.
Okay.
Good job.
That's what Peewee said.
Wellington.
Hello, Doctor.
I'm dying over here.
Okay, hurry up.
Open line on our Florida line, 1-800-944-WIO-D.
Here's the lady in Fort Lauderdale.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Neil.
How's by you?
Fine, how are you?
I'm a little better.
Good.
I'm recuperating from whatever happened today.
Good.
I'm working today, but I'm not that calm to see how you're doing.
Yeah.
Doing good?
No.
No, why?
Well, you haven't been listening to the show.
I haven't listened to the show about Peewee harm, I think it's good.
And if I forget about Peewee harm, and forget about Peewee, I'm talking about that food that they keep saying.
They're sending in here, they're keeping making me sick.
Get new food.
What?
Get some more food.
Get more food, new food, different food.
Okay, let me try to, before I get, have a stroke on here.
Let me try to explain it to you, okay?
I know.
I have diabetes.
I understand.
Okay.
I can't eat all this food.
Do you understand?
I'm over, I had a stroke a year ago April.
Okay, which everybody finds very amusing, all right?
I can't eat.
Right.
Okay, I have a little salad that the people across in sunny days
are nice enough to bring every day.
That's all I want for lunch, okay?
Just a little salad.
Healthy, nice little crap, okay?
Okay.
I don't want food.
I've been screaming and yelling and puking on here, no more food.
What are you going to do, just drink fluid.
You do that?
Neil.
So.
Dumb bitch.
127 at WIOD.
I mean, how is it possible to be so stupid?
How is it possible you, you like practice?
I've heard of practice makes perfect, that's the motto in serosota.
But you're like a new dimension of stupidity.
New food.
How about some old food, honey?
Miami.
Here's the head of young man.
Okay, Harry.
Miami.
Neil.
Yeah.
How you seeing Gilbert and David together?
I was thinking about that.
The life is very close.
All right.
Yeah.
Well, I don't have any more material.
Okay.
There is Martinez guys.
Later.
Two open lines, both in Dade County.
751-9463-751.
Here's a mobile in Port St. Lucie.
Driving home.
Let's go to where's George?
Oh, there he is.
You kind of get lost in the mail stream in there.
Man, it's like a circus in there today.
God.
It's like Barterman Bailey, aren't they in serosota?
Yeah.
Let's do a remote.
That's what I say.
Rick and Sets can do two to six from the donut shop.
And I'll do a 10 to 2 from up the road a piece, okay?
Bring your trench coats.
Four lotter down.
Neil.
Yeah.
Hey, man.
Just calm down.
Will you, sir?
Don't be a parrot.
No, sir.
My friend here is exposing himself to me.
I wonder if I can make an assistance arrest on him.
Yes, sir, right now.
Brad's the high.
Hey.
No, I'm sitting here.
I've got lots of things to talk about.
Let me just say this, too, sir.
Nothing that small could ever be admitted into evidence.
I hear that, man.
That's a problem I've been having.
I don't want to break up on their minds.
It's a story.
Hey, but you're going to hear that.
Oh.
Make sure the radio's down.
Yeah, crank that baby down.
Hey, crank.
Turn that, get that thing down.
And the radio, too.
And, uh, hey, I'm going to medical school in a couple of weeks.
Great.
You got any advice for me?
Yeah.
Like, don't go.
Be as dishonest as possible.
If you have no scruples, no ethics, if you're nothing but a blood-sucking money-hungry douchebag, go right ahead.
And good luck to you.
I got dollars, sir.
Doctors are douchebags, sir.
They're full of crap.
They don't know what they're talking about.
Does that make me a pre-duche bag?
Yeah.
You're going into pre-duche.
Hey, if I told you I spoke to a dead person last night, what would you say?
I talk to him every day.
No big deal.
I mean, for real.
I spoke to him for two and a half hours on the old Weegee board.
Yeah?
On the Weeney board?
It was a guy who died as tutors in a parachute accident.
I knew him.
I got a friend of him.
I swear to God.
I swear to God.
It was so incredible.
I could tell you the whole.
I don't know what it is, but it's moving.
Yeah.
Oh, and Brad, he wants to know something.
I mean, he's a little upset about this whole Pee Wee thing.
Yeah.
And you know, I mean, he wants to know.
It doesn't cap the kangaroo and give a truck ever to rank off, you know.
They never got half before it.
I'm sure the Pee nut gallery.
Why do you think they call them Captain Kangaroo, sir?
Right.
Have a great day.
130 at WIOD.
This whole thing with Pee Wee's getting a little bit out of hand.
We have an open-line at Broward, 5249463.
5249464.
I never even knew they had such a horrendous place of ill repute in Sarasota.
I would think that a bunch of upstanding old farts over there wouldn't even permit such a disgusting, degrading place.
I'm going to go out and check it out this afternoon.
Homestead.
Homestead's gone?
Yep.
Oh, there you are.
Are you at Homestead?
Yep.
Well, I'll be dang.
Yeah, I'm at first time, caller.
Great.
How is it so far?
I don't know.
You're pretty ridiculous.
I tell you.
Yeah.
That's your idea.
Oh, yeah.
You did pretty much to these people, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was born down here.
And?
And I'm telling you.
And you're pretty bitter about it too, about all these slime balls that have come in and destroying it for you, aren't you?
I'm very extremely bitter.
I don't blame you, sir.
Stand up and be counted.
Don't be another do-boy.
Do-boy.
Who's the do-boy, Rick?
Rick Raleigh.
Yeah.
He's the 1991 do-boy poster child.
Do-boy.
Yeah, well, I just like to tell everybody that.
In fact, he's going to be on, if CBS makes a hit with bringing back the, what you call it?
What's the show they're bringing back?
The Car-Bullwinkle and Rocky.
He's going to be a Dudley do-right do-boy.
Yeah.
Well, I'll just tell everybody that's not from Florida and Rags on those Floridians.
You all are do-spatts.
Okay.
Thank you.
Amen.
131 now, W-I-O-D.
I just stay.
I don't understand it at all Tuesday.
I really don't.
I somewhere along the line, we just kind of lost control.
It slipped away from us.
And we can't get a hold of it again.
Let's try Lake Worth on the Starline.
No, not going to talk about P.W.
Good.
I'm just going to ask a question.
Yeah.
If the Marlins and the Dauphin's play at J.R.S.
Does that make it the fish bowl?
Yeah.
Not bad.
I give it about a two.
Thank you.
See you.
132 at W-I-O-D.
We have an open line on the Starline.
It's Star-I-O-D.
Games in Tokyo this weekend.
But we'll have it.
Mr. Weaver and Mr. Goldberg.
Now, I question, of course, is, aren't they leaving today, I think?
Who's going to be doing Hank Show Wednesday Thursday and Friday?
While he's in Tokyo, y'all get it up with Mr. Weaver and all the boys.
Who's going to be doing the show?
Do we know?
Who?
Miami Zone.
Oh, Miami Zone.
Well, better than Graveline.
Tamarack.
Tamarack?
Yeah, Neil.
I just want to tell you something.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Are you in Tamarack?
Yeah.
And I had to say it three times so you could say the Cubs suck.
Oh, and I wanted you to talk a little bit about the Reds.
Get it like the Reds.
Oh, yeah.
They're really hot.
They're going to beat your butt this week.
Yeah, like they did last week.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
We'll see.
I'll call you back after the game.
Good luck.
You'll need it.
What are they like?
45 behind other Reds.
Man, you noticed that nervous twang in his voice?
I'd be nervous too, spewing crap like that.
You can get arrested in this town for spewing propaganda like that, sir.
Miami.
Hey, Neil, how's it going?
OK, it's almost over, sir.
Thank God.
Can you do me a favor and pass a message to Rick?
Rick who?
Rick Riley.
Do boy.
Yeah, tell him that Peewee is more of a man than he is for Christ's sake.
All he's doing is whining, whining.
Such got more repulsed.
Call him up and tell him that.
OK, you'll be, you know, all these macho guys that call me and rag on somebody else.
Call him up and tell him to his own ear, OK?
You spineless jellyfish.
But he does have a point.
Miramar.
Hey, welcome, Neil.
How you doing?
Hey, let me ask you something.
What the heck is a finger popping crazy?
You know something?
It's amazing that you asked that question.
Wait a minute.
OK, do you want to hear one?
Go ahead.
All right, here you go.
Hey, Peewee, blow my finger.
There it was.
Now I'm talking about the traffic promo.
OK.
Yeah, I know what you say.
Hey, listen, don't play.
Don't get me involved with those disgusting grotesque promos that the audience are puking from from coast to coast.
Oh, man.
I have no idea.
We just, they just will not get the clue here.
The more you scream about it, the more when they put on the ear.
And Larry Bessler keeps screaming louder and louder about the weather geeks and the finger popping crazies.
And I don't know.
Who knows what they're talking about.
Stupid.
I know it.
It's like an insult to all of our intelligence.
No way.
Anyways, Peewee Herman is OK in my book.
OK.
Bye.
See you.
Pervert.
142 at WIOD.
What does it say?
Oh, we have a new promo minute and 22 seconds long for what?
What is it for?
Music, yes.
For the news, let's go to Miami on a Broward line.
You know, two things.
Did you hear the Peewee Herman's going to start writing Jackie wacky?
Next thing.
And what do you think about the Mike Tyson of Andrew Hosefield?
OK.
Let's go to Miami on the star line.
How are you doing, Neil?
OK.
Who do you think was right?
The Empire or Dawson?
Joe West is a pig.
How do you like that, sir?
Well, he is a pig.
I just think that I need a pig.
With a crappy smirk on his face.
Somebody needs to wipe that smirk right off his fat, stupid face.
I'll bet you Peewee Herman will do it.
There you go.
Listen, now I just wanted to change the subject a little because I'm sick of hearing about this jerk.
Oh, that's all we're hearing all day long.
I know.
These people are like one note charles.
I know.
I mean, once they get a hold of it, they just can't let it go.
I hear him.
I hear him.
See you.
Well, 145 at WIOD, we have an open line in Broward 524.
And one on that world famous star line.
If you have Bell South mobility, pick it up and give it a little tickle.
Star IOD.
Here's a lady in Miami.
Well, George paid me to say this.
He has got.
Oh, come on.
George is out of control.
Well, always.
George's vacation start tomorrow or there's, oh, tomorrow.
So this is his last day before vacation.
Oh, George.
Yeah, he goes on vacation for a week to.
What is it?
We're told he could go on vacation.
Are you there?
Yeah.
I just wanted to be betchy today.
Oh, well, why should you be any different from anybody else?
Exactly, exactly.
These people are around.
They're like on a suit-a-fit.
They're like, man, they're nuts.
Did you see the new people magazine?
It's in the waste basket.
Those pictures inside are the...
Well, save your money.
Really?
The pictures inside are the grubby-ist.
It looks like they took the Nelson's heads off and put them on Evander Holyfield's body
or something.
Just disgusting.
Oh, really?
Forget it.
Save your money, honey.
Oh, man.
What a letdown.
Yeah.
I mean, I thought I was so excited when I saw it the other day.
And I was like, oh, I got to go get one.
Don't do it.
Forget it.
Been for a small disappointment.
Oh, well, I'll save my money to eat them.
Okay.
Thank you, Neil.
Have a good day.
Bye.
146.
At WIOD, the end is in sight.
We can see blight at the end of the tunnel.
751 WIOD at Open Line and Dade.
And one in Broward rhymes with coward.
5249463.
West Palm Beach.
I know.
How you doing?
It's got a good story for you.
I'm...
What is it?
My mother told me this story.
You ready?
Yeah.
You know, it's about the folks at a cemetery village.
Hello?
I'm here.
I'm listening, sir.
I'm listening.
Okay.
You know, once a week, they all get on the bus and they go do their shopping.
Uh-huh.
The public's a wind mixer where it is.
Yeah.
On a recent trip.
They all have gone in and done their shopping.
They're about...
They all got on the bus.
They're ready to go.
Yeah.
And the manager steps aboard the bus and says, okay.
One of our employees, somebody in the bus, deals some food.
No, I'm not going to embarrass everyone.
And I want that person when you get back to just leave it on the seat.
We're not going to call the police or anything.
Do you know how many times I've heard this story, sir?
Is it that great?
They all got up and got off the bus and every seat there was stuff left behind.
I'm not the Phil II shopping basket.
Right.
That's great.
A Tiscuit of Tascuit, leave it in my basket.
Okay, but you haven't heard this one.
Okay.
As Teewee was being read out in handcuffs.
Okay.
152 at WIOD.
Boy, they got that beat scene on MTV again right now.
And I don't have time to be bothered with this stinkin' show.
Okay, look at, was this the one that I was watching yesterday
and about the same time?
No.
Different cast of characters.
Not bad.
Anyway, let's go to Miami Beach.
Hello.
How you doing?
Okay.
Bonk's more entertaining than that, Rayce.
Yeah, that's good.
Okay, I boxed this.
Hi, Johnny.
Have a nice day over at the coast.
Pember of Pine, hello.
Yeah, what's up, Neil?
How are you?
Great.
I'm talking about Las Vegas.
Yeah.
I lived out there for two years and I tell you,
I always hear you say what a great ton it is.
I hated it out there.
Why is that?
Nothing to do.
I mean, except drinking gambling.
You gamble out there, you get into a board.
Oh, bring it out of here.
Nothing to do but drinking gambling.
Go away, way up.
What else?
What else besides that?
I was here for two.
I made great money.
I was a bartender out there.
Yeah.
But I made great money.
But I don't drink, okay?
So there must be something else to do out there beside drinking.
Well, you tell me one thing since you've been out there
so many times.
Tell me one besides drinking.
How about the big name entertainment?
How about the show?
How about the food?
How often do you go to that?
What?
I mean, if you live out there, how often can you go in?
There's a ticket, there's a ticket for it.
I'll go out there.
But you don't understand.
The point is that at least you have the option.
When you live somewhere, you have a series of options.
People live in New York City.
Don't go to a Broadway show every day of the week.
But once in a while when there's something they want to see,
it's there and they go and they enjoy it.
They don't understand that, but at least out here,
I mean, at least you don't wear a towel or you can do the football thing.
We've got baseball crumbles.
We've got basketball.
I mean, there's no sports out there.
I mean, you know, there's no sports out there at all.
They're all on the big screen in the sports pool.
I don't go and see whatever the hell you want.
But that's not the same thing as watching it on the bigger.
Yes, sure.
So life is more than just a ball game, okay?
Then just waiting for a ball game.
It'll be great when we have baseball,
because baseball is just about every night in the summertime.
That's great.
We used to get so bored out there, we would go out and look for deserts.
Well, you're the only person I have ever spoken to in my life,
who gave me a song in a dance like this.
Wait a second, there's a different song.
I'm talking about, I'm talking about people who lived there.
I'm not talking about people who visited there.
No, I can't understand it.
I mean, it's a hundred percent.
In addition to which this is supposed to be a tourist town, okay?
Professional sports is not what a tourist town is all about, okay?
That's not what it's all about.
What is it all about?
It's having things for people.
What do you think you go out there and retire and gamble?
I mean, they end up spending every nickel.
Oh, sir.
Go have a Hershey in them, will you?
Get out of my life.
They go and spend every nickel.
I'm talking about tourist places, places for people to go places and do things.
Dumbbell, no wonder you're here.
God almighty.
If you didn't like it there, I'm happy for you, okay?
North Miami Beach.
Uh, no.
Yes, sir.
Me, coheron, estrangle, and wait.
Only in English, okay?
On the show, only in English.
Let's try Miami on the Star Line.
Hello.
Mr. Rogers, what's your blood pressure there?
I know.
These people are nuts today.
That guy from Vegas, that man is the biggest dipspit I have ever spoken to in my life.
Anyway, there's nothing to do there.
Yeah, it's exciting here.
We're going to sit around and wait for the marlins for a year and a half.
Okay, it'll be great when the meantime.
You had to go live in Des Moines or someplace like that.
Oh, God.
Anyway, I spoke to you earlier this year.
I'm not one of your scum-sucking bandwagon jumping cups fans.
I'm a Dodger fan.
I'd like to thank your cups for beating up on the braids.
It was an exciting series.
Yeah.
Uh, that's...
Well, we'll try to help you out tonight, but you guys are going to have to get some hits.
You know, you have three hits in two games and I'm getting the job.
We hit our way out of a paper bag.
It's just pitiful.
We almost got no hit three times in the past six days.
But, uh, keep it up and good luck and I'd like to see you guys beat up on the reds.
It's quite that early guy.
Well, we're going to try it.
Thank you, sir.
We're going to take Bring Our Bats.
I'll tell you that.
All right.
See you.
Not necessarily for the game.
156 at WIOD, Miami.
Rick and Suck Suck.
Okay, thanks.
Miramar.
Yeah, yeah.
I went and got my head over a blockbuster and I love it.
Go Marlins, Dennis, and Joe, your major douchebags.
Okay.
Good job.
Right to the point.
He got it all in.
He touched all the bases in Halleluia.
Miami Beach on the Star Line.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Neil.
Yeah.
You got a minute to talk sometime off the air.
About a fundraiser for a commemoration house.
What do you mean about a fundraiser for Camilo's house?
Well, I was introduced to something last night that would be, I think, very interesting to you
in Camilo's house to raise money for Camilo's house.
And regard to what?
Doing what?
Racing money.
But I mean, what is it?
Well, you could tie it in with your end of the year if I meant you always do to raise money.
Okay, hold on a second.
Sure.
Why do these people call me on the air with stuff?
Why don't they talk to we event?
Why do they talk to boy Kurt?
I think I'm losing it.
North Miami.
Whatever happened to Ron St. John, Jr.
Good question.
And Benny Goodman had a big smash hit in 1945.
Yeah.
Call it got to be this or that he actually sang on the record.
Wow.
And novelly vocal by the man himself.
Okay, call up Stu Goldstein.
He'll be right over to compare notes with you.
Well, that's going to do it for us and none too soon.
Let me tell you that boys and girls.
Carry your trench coats even on a sunny day.
That's the message we learned today.
Rick and Puddle, I'm sorry.
A Duboy and Puddle be along after the two o'clock news for four exciting hours.
Joe Zagaki and Sunny Hirsch will be here on Sports Talk to do their usual Tuesday evening.
