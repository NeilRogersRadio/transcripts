Well, join us.
Get out of the way.
Hey, Rick, it's Bob.
The Rogers on News.Radio.
Six dead.
W-I-O-D.
It's the one to do our...
...
...
...
You know, when I was a little kid,
I used to have this WebCortate PC-Corder
and I used to sit like an old corner of the living room.
With a little microphone and play radio.
And that's basically what I feel like we're doing here again today.
It's like being reborn all over again.
It's like reliving your childhood.
Here's a man who dresses like he was just crawled out of a gutter.
He's got more money than God.
How you doing, Preston?
Preston, hand ladies and gentlemen.
Close friends with my good buddy, Sheriff Nick.
Only he's got better here than you do.
Yes, Preston.
To apologize for what?
How about doing a microphone?
To apologize to me and apologize to Nick.
I'm threatening you.
Yes.
For what?
Are you putting those lights on here?
Oh, geez.
That's beautiful.
Get that thing out of here.
Okay, I don't do snakes.
I'll tell you one thing.
Get that, Grotesque.
He's got a snake, the size of a laski here.
Don't put that baby on me.
I'm telling you.
Jews don't do snakes.
Okay.
It's not kosher.
It's drafe.
Just say you're sorry.
I'm not sorry, okay?
No way, Jose.
I apologize for nothing.
And I got a real good lawyer too, okay?
So get that baby and you got lots of money to cash in on.
Oh, geez.
I think I'm going to trip off the stage on a way out.
Thank you, Preston.
You got her.
You and Sheriff Nick, a sense of humor from hell.
Great guys.
Is he here?
Where is he?
Is he hiding over there?
He's hiding over there.
Come on.
Come on.
Quick hiding over there.
What did you just because that horse is still running at Papano?
I bet you're really sunny from the market.
I knew that Sheriff Nick would be lurking in the background.
That's why our phones got screwed up.
He's getting even for that horse.
Anyway, it's 107 at WIOD.
Let's, where's Adam?
Okay.
I'll tell you what to do.
Because I know it's a terminal.
I mean, the show has been horrendous enough with all our problems.
We've done our best.
It hasn't been very good.
It's been putrid and best.
We got a whole bunch of these.
Now, the ladies like in the who haven't won anything.
In the first three or four rows down there, you just stay in your seats.
And here, Adam, and there's about a dozen, fifteen or twenty.
All those nice ladies down here.
Because they're the ones that come here in shop.
And by jewelry and cosmetics and all the other great stuff and clothing and schmattas and whatever here at the swap shop, they love it.
So, just give those out.
We're going to try to make as many people happy, especially the ones who are closest to me.
Okay.
Just keep them happy and everybody will be okay.
Okay.
Hi.
And let's talk to our next caller in beautiful Boka.
Welcome to 610WIOD or a screwed up station for the 90s.
Sir, man.
Boka.
Boka, that's what I said.
Hey, Neil.
Yeah.
How about those cops, huh?
Yeah, we're doing it.
Do we get our new manager yet?
I don't know.
Too busy wrapped up worrying over the braids.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, you sound...
Ronnie Gantt Jr.'s doing the Tomahawk chop again, okay?
Oh, not that again.
Yeah.
And Jane Fonda is pretty upset about it.
Yeah, let me shift you.
You better watch yourself, Ron.
We're going to have the seminal Indians come over here from Bingo and nail your ass.
Okay.
Watch it, Ronnie.
Yes, sir.
Go ahead.
Buddy, shift gears.
Please.
Connection is beautiful.
Great.
You sound great.
It's killing me.
See?
We went through all that crap just so we could finally get our great one to two hour and everything's
all straightened out for the moment.
I know.
Since some of your staff out there like an hour ahead of time to test it out or something.
Sir, we were all here 830 this morning.
We were getting southern bell involved and when you got Sheriff Nick lurking in the background
and when Joseph Gackie and his lackeys are working sabotage at the phone company, what the hell are we going to do?
Well, to quote my grandmother, always a.
Exactly.
And I'll leave you on that note.
Have a good one, Neil.
And the same to you, Sheriff.
I'll ask for a clear connection.
Okay, I had nothing to say, but it was a nice sound to good connection.
Let's go to North Miami Beach.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
I just want to say a thing.
What do you sound so bummed out about?
You sound like you're ready to blow your brains out?
No.
Don't do it till after the lottery, okay?
I'm on for the third time. I think it's great.
This is the first time I've ever called you, so.
Well, what do you mean you're on for the third time?
I'm in the guy now, little.
Oh, he keeps putting this guy back on the phone.
You have it, isn't this cheering you up a little bit?
Yeah, it's great. I'm in isolation, so.
Yeah.
And you got pneumonia, right?
Yeah.
And you're spreading germs and disease all over the hospital.
Hell, yeah.
Let me give you a little clue, okay?
You know, the vent that's up there on the ceiling.
Uh-huh.
Just take that baby out, get a long pipe and just keep bricking into that thing and squeezing and ram down.
You'll have more fun going on in that place that we change in our diapers every five seconds.
It'll be better than the huggies halftime show it to Dolphin Game on Sunday.
Okay, hold on, sir.
You're going to keep holding it?
Yeah, I guess he is because Alex just put him back on hold.
Ten minutes after one at WIOD to kick off exciting new 92 season.
Where is he? Where is the Paris?
Huh?
He left.
I would have left two if I were him.
To kick off the exciting new 92 season Toyota of Hollywood is having a one time only event.
The World Series of Savings.
And you know what?
It's happening last weekend.
Unbelievable prices on a new all-star lineup of 92 Toyota's.
The kind of prices that knock all the other dealers out of the ballpark.
And last weekend Toyota of Hollywood was making some big headlines.
Special savings on Tursell's.
Crescent is pickups and preview of fans.
So it would have been a good idea for you to be first at the gate.
To check out Toyota of Hollywood's most valuable player.
They all knew 92 cameras.
It's the most beautiful, the most spacious camera they've made yet.
You won't believe the deal they could have made this past weekend during the Toyota of Hollywood World Series of Savings.
You should have checked the back of the sports pages in last weekend's Harold for record-shattering prices.
See, this is a spot it's kind of like learn your lesson.
And next time we tell you, you'll check the ads and you'll get your ass down there.
Okay, it's to make you feel bad.
They were really expecting a large crowd.
I'm sure they probably had one turn out.
So you should have heard on down.
Special finance experts were there on hand to offer you big bucks on your trade-in.
And low monthly payments on that great new 92 Toyota.
The best selection, the best prices.
And Patrick Murray who couldn't get arrested in the rated cheerfnick's house.
They're all waiting for you at Toyota of Hollywood on 441.
Between Taft and Sheridan streets in Hollywood where people come to buy.
And not to shop.
And we'll come back live.
We're making a wee bit of a comeback here at the Swap Shop.
If you wear glasses or contacts, listen to this.
Another bag.
And we have one more.
Man, rich has pulled these things out of I don't know where.
Jim Gurgis.
Not here.
Dave, uh, G-O-L-N.
G-O-C-N.
Wilton Manners.
Is Dave Goln?
I guess Dave's Goln.
Steve Adler, North Miami Beach, slept all the way up here.
To win a breeder's cut bag, we pulled his name out of the thing.
And Steve is not here.
Steve, joy mirrors of Parkland.
A joy forever.
Is a thing to hold tomorrow?
Not here.
Otto Blanco, Miami Lakes.
Otto.
Well, I heard a gushry from way in the back there.
Is that you Otto?
Okay.
Stuff that baby with all kinds of good stuff.
Okay.
And the bag too.
Okay.
We got a one breeder's cut t-shirt left to give away to Hermann Gehring.
Oh, Jerry Gehring, a Fort Lauderdale, G-O-E-H-R-I-N-G.
Where's the guy in the SS outfit?
Jerry?
Not here.
Joe?
Troholis of Hallendale.
Joe?
I heard another gushry.
Where is Joe?
There is Joe right over here.
Joe, you got the t-shirt.
So that takes care of all that.
We're going to give some snapple away.
And we'll take a few more of these incredible calls.
Now we can all get out of here and say, hey, it was a great experience.
Was it a great experience so far?
Yeah.
That's what I would say about the same enthusiasm.
Okay, let's take a call from Kendall.
Hello.
Kendall.
Okay, next one.
Miami.
Hello.
Miami.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
The guy in the hospital.
Yeah.
That's my brother.
Oh, yeah?
Mike, you're on tape.
Isn't that great?
That's awesome.
Oh, did you hear that?
I sound like I'm under water now.
Did you hear that?
Can you hear it?
I've been hearing it.
Yeah, it sounds like it's repeating, like underwater.
Well, let me tell you, when you hear it.
It's me or can you hear it?
Listen to that.
We're under water.
All right.
I bet you even Joy Reynolds never did this.
Hello.
Yeah, so now you and your brother are big stars, right?
We're mega stars.
Can you hear that?
The way it's feeding back?
No.
I can.
I like it.
I'm getting a sensual thrills from it.
Well, all of that, when you were doing that radio with your paper quarter there, it sounded
much better than this show.
On guarantee of that.
Neil?
Yes, sir.
I want to call somebody to do space.
Go ahead.
Ed and Eric, you guys have a major do space.
Okay.
Florida State Number One.
Go visit your brother.
Give me something to do, okay?
I did last night.
Okay.
All righty.
See ya.
Bye.
And he visited his brother too.
Once 17 at WIOD, now things are starting to pick up.
I like the sound of this.
Could we figure out how this works and take it back to the station and do this every day
at the underwater show?
Where we're drowning over here.
Let's go to Lauderdale Lakes.
Welcome to WIOD, where we're just confused and glad about it.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Michelle.
How you doing, Michelle?
Great.
I was there earlier.
Early in the morning.
I was sitting in the front and I had the two kids.
Did you win anything?
My mom did.
Yes, you called my name and she picked it up for me.
Well, that's great.
It's great.
You got to say hi because I slept here from Miami Beach this morning.
It's great to be there.
Well, hi, Phyllis.
Congratulations on winning our big schmata whatever was we gave away to you from WIOD.
Where we spur no expense to send the most mediocre.
And you know what?
Is that you?
Oh, that's the lady down there that came up here 17 times to win a prize, right?
17 times?
At least.
Listen, let me tell you one other thing.
She said you were number one, by the way.
Oh, let me tell you something about you.
Yeah.
I was told not to be disappointed and I wasn't.
I thought you were pretty cute and funny.
Oh, huh?
Yeah, I was the thin tall guy that would keep carrying the box all over the place.
Everybody thought that was Adam.
That was really me.
Oh, oh, now I know.
Yeah.
Hey, Neil, you're cool.
You did a scene that gigantic snake that the Preston hand set up here to put around my neck.
Yeah, I heard you just incredible.
We were about like two seconds away from a major lawsuit.
Yeah.
I noticed as soon as I mentioned my lawyer and lawsuit all of a sudden the snake disappeared
and pressed them right over to see Sheriff Nick.
Oh, well, listen, they need to get a life.
Yes, they do.
So let me ask you something, is you were driving home from here?
Yeah.
I want to keep pressing this, but I'd like to get the the the Emma's.
You know, I'm saying I like to get an answer.
You're the harmonica?
That's Aubrey.
Is Stevie Wonder visiting or what is that?
Her name is Aubrey Cantitorian.
She's dynamite on the home.
Great.
On the mouth organ.
That's good.
Now listen, as you were driving home.
You found it fine and you found fine in the house too.
Great.
Well, thanks for the good report.
Yeah, what can I say?
OK.
All right, Neil, take it easy.
Have a lovely life.
Bye, mom.
See, she said bye, mom.
And she said you're still number one.
With the other hand.
A mobile in Miami.
Hello.
How you doing?
OK.
You don't sound like you're underwater.
Good.
We don't hear it.
Only you do.
But it was, well, maybe it was just the effect of the show.
It's having on my mind.
It could be.
I want to talk sport.
I'm taking a mental barrier.
I'm animal when I get home.
It's going to be great.
Are you?
OK, go ahead.
Whatever you like, sir, this is America.
This is W-I-O-D where you can say almost anything you want
as long as we agree.
Go ahead.
Who is the N-L-most valuable player?
Who's the most valuable player?
Yeah.
Terry Pendleton.
Not Gantt?
No.
Gantt?
Yeah.
Oh, he's sucking up to you, sir.
I think he wants to date.
No, but Terry Pendleton hands down.
No question about it.
Go to the bank on it.
Did they have a chance to come back?
Of course.
Are you rooting back?
They're a coming back team.
I'm rooting my brains out.
Oh, yeah.
As long as we keep that pink O-Jane fondant
or sleeping husband out of there, we got a chance.
So what's the story?
She said she's not going to do it anymore.
She's not going to do it anymore.
And she's not making the chop anymore, either.
What about him, if he's looking at me?
He and I'd look in from him sleeping.
I think he's been doing it for a long time.
OK, believe me.
Well, you take care.
You're the best, but I know it.
All right.
What's sucking around?
OK, 20 after 1 to 2.
If you can do this show today, the way this show has gone
and somebody calls and says, you're the best.
You know, either the desperate, they want to date
or they like your life.
20 after 1 at 610, W-I-O-D.
And let's do a little break here.
Alex will come right back.
We're live at the Swap Shop.
We got 40 minutes.
We're counting it down by the second.
Thank you, Tim.
123 at W-I-O-D.
We're live at the Swap Shop.
Let's continue with the calls.
We got some snappled to give away, too, by the way.
And is that it?
I don't want to make sure we give everything away
that we got.
By the way, lovely Laura is here from the former continuity
at W-I-O-D.
Remember, Sife tonight?
And all the great stories about Laura's rabbi.
Laura's here.
And she would come up and say some disgusting things
about management, but she's getting a good settlement.
So she's going to keep her mouth shut.
Good thinking, Laura.
123, let's go to Miami, a mobile.
Hello?
No.
Yes, sir.
I'm angry.
I'm disappointed.
Your mad is hell.
I'm mad at hell.
OK, join a crowd.
I got a call.
I got a couple of golf fans in the car.
And we got a vent our anger.
We've got a call for Sammy Smith, Mama, a dispatch.
Yeah.
I know it.
I'm sorry.
I'm angry and hurt.
I took my season tickets.
They look great on a brushed brush frame in my office,
because I'm certainly not going to use them.
I'm sitting at blazing hot sun to watch that trash.
Good luck, sir.
I know it.
You're nothing.
Hey, hold on.
Yeah.
Here's another one, too.
If you want to call someone a dispatch, too.
OK.
Yeah.
Hey, Marbys, this is your bag.
OK, thanks a lot.
OK, Rick Weaver calling it on his day off.
124 at WIOD, Little River.
Hello.
Little River is gone.
Pembroke Pines.
Hello.
Pembroke Pines going once?
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
OK.
I just have one thing I want to talk about golf in a minute.
Who's the running back coach?
Do you know for the golfants?
The running back coach?
Yeah.
Feats me.
I just came down here from New York,
in the last few games at the golf and played.
Sammy Smith jumping over to top with one hand.
Would I own a ball with two hands?
Right.
It's just amazing.
Yeah, it is amazing.
That's what Shula said in the locker room after the game.
He said he must have told Tony Nathan.
That's right.
He said he must have had two hands on a ball.
And then one of the coaches, it wasn't Tony.
One of the coaches said, no, he didn't.
And Shula just had a spit-eating look on his face.
There is no way you can jump it to the end.
They all are holding the ball in one hand.
Of course not.
And even Higgs was talking about the way how he leaps sideways
to make sure he's got the better angle.
And he's got both hands on a ball.
And Sammy just goes in and we're low for bread.
And they're looking for it.
It's the only chance they got to stop it.
Knock it out of his hands and bingo.
We do it again.
I don't know if he's too excited to get in or what.
Wasn't thinking.
I don't know.
Never should have happened.
It should never have happened.
But you see those Toronto Maple Leafs against those
cannot fly off night?
Yeah, they're great.
Why was it on?
Yeah.
Oh, I didn't see that.
Thank God.
Didn't see it.
Yeah, enclosing.
Go Rangers.
OK.
Right.
125 at WIOD.
Don't forget sports channel has come to continental cable,
which gives a lot of people a little more of a life.
I just can't believe the it's either these people are loyal
who are here today or have no life at all.
These people have been here.
Is there other people have been here since 10 o'clock?
Look at that.
There's like a whole bunch of hands
of people have been here since way back at 10.
I can't get over it.
Get a life.
I mean, talk about loyalty.
Talk about just waiting for something exciting to happen.
I got news for you.
And the last part, it ain't.
But Phyllis is still there.
She's a celebrity now.
Her daughter was on the phone.
It's, you know how that gets in a week.
They'll both be chronic.
They'll be like Bonnie and Sandy.
Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
I want to talk about the dolphins.
Wayne is the, sir.
Yeah.
Do you think Sammy sucks?
Do I think so?
Yeah.
You want an honest answer?
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah?
Why did you start?
OK.
Thank you, sir.
I take it as a great compliment.
126 at WIOD.
Oh, jeez, he said I suck on.
No.
My mother is listening.
I mean, that's the same mentality.
OK.
I mean, you're either going to butcher up and take it
like a real man or make believe.
What are you just going to be a wimp like?
Sammy?
Hollywood.
Hello.
Hollywood.
Oh, no.
Yes, sir.
Hey, first time calling.
Great.
And I think you're agree.
Uh-huh.
And what is it you want?
Huh?
What is it you want?
Nobody sucks around like that without wanting to.
I'm leaving.
I'm moving.
Where are you going?
San Francisco.
Oh, boy.
And I'm going to miss you.
Uh-huh.
And I'm going to miss you.
Well, you're going out there just in time
that Alex Bennett got camped out there
so you won't have to worry about him.
All right.
But who else is in a listen to you, Alex?
Nobody.
Nobody.
No good.
And I'm just happy to get out of Florida and Miami
and all the cockroaches and all that down here.
Take a lot of tapes with you, sir.
Sorry.
I'd like to call somebody a douchebag.
OK.
Knit and a viral first of all.
Yes, sir.
He's right here.
He heard you said you're number one.
He said you better get out of town fast.
And tell him to stop going to the adult bookstores.
OK.
And he said he's got a good selection at home for you.
If you don't find what you're looking for.
I'm sure he does.
Yeah.
And two more people.
Twelve and her Z are big anal beach bags.
OK.
Have a great life.
It's a great.
OK.
And don't drop the soap.
128 at WIOD.
By the way, is anybody selling two live crew here
at the Swab Shop?
Wouldn't that be great?
We could have a live on the air bus.
It could be better than Channel 7.
We could get Rick to come over here and squat over our
Sheriff Nick's head.
Man, we could have a big on air thing and save this damn show
today.
Mobile in Key Largo.
Hello.
How you doing, Neil?
Great.
I just want to comment on the post game show.
Yes, sir.
When him was talking about the fact that one guy put a towel
over his head.
The other guy said don't put Sammy in.
As far as I'm concerned, they were saying the same thing
as the fans.
Right.
Except the fans don't have any way to voice this off except
in the stadium.
But how come on we say it that all of a sudden we're bad guys
and we suck and we shouldn't come back if we want to criticize?
I still can't get over that.
I never heard such a thing in my life.
It would be like if I had a restaurant, OK?
And you came in and you had what you considered
was a bad meal.
And you called the waitress.
You said, I'm going to send this back.
I don't like the food.
And I said to you, I said, if you're
going to complain, don't ever come back here again.
Would anybody ever say that?
That's right.
Unless they were out of their mind.
Yeah, somebody like me have only been saying,
only been saying, pick it all just for 21 years.
Yeah.
I guess that gives us a chance to say something.
You bet.
Have a great face.
Terrible phone.
John Feinberg in Atlanta.
Neil.
Yes, John.
How you doing?
Great.
I called him my portable lollipagot.
You were sounding loud and clear early in the show.
Yeah.
So I heard the show.
How'd you hear the show?
Well, I called on the 800 number.
Oh, I see.
Nobody ever picked it up.
No.
Well, he was busy trying to save his job.
But it sounds great.
Good.
I listened to the whole show.
This town's gone crazy.
Yeah, I bet they are.
These people are what I want.
By the way, you bet.
Oh, it's 130 already.
And Ronnie Gantt is still sitting here in the first row.
And now I got news.
We better get that plane in here.
You guys going to be in big trouble,
although he has left a lot of runners in scoring position.
Hey, I didn't want to dump on you, Ronnie.
But I got news for you.
That foul, pop fly with runners at first.
And third, the other nice shameful.
I agree.
I disgrace in the top of the eighth, Ronnie.
Butch up.
I'm surprised you're not coming here tonight.
What do you mean by that?
I got a work for a living.
OK, I can't just flew around like some kind of butterfly.
Well, I'm not independently wealthy like Preston Han.
If Preston gave me a big bag of money,
I'd be up there in a couple of hours.
No problem.
I'll think about you tonight when I'm doing the chop up.
OK, go braves.
Go braves.
OK, and screw those Indians, sir.
Hey, one thing they want to trade Sammy Smith
for Tim MacIer up here.
Yeah.
We'll pack a sandwich you can have both of them.
All right.
130 at WIOD.
And let's, I don't even know what we're doing anymore.
I'm just doing it on automatic pilot.
I could be here like midnight now.
It wouldn't make any difference.
Let's go to Miami.
Hello.
Good afternoon, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
Let me ask you a question.
Are we making a little comeback now?
You're doing great.
OK.
I'd like to make a quick comment about Cambra Marshall.
Yes, sir.
OK, this guy.
He's out of this world.
I'll tell you.
Oh, yeah.
That's true.
So last night on the sportscast, he just
went on and on about Sammy Smith and just how the fans
and how it's just a game and how it got out of hand
and this closing comment was, for all those fans
that boot him, get a life.
Oh, no.
Not only is he stealing my material,
but it is just a game.
But the people who go out there
got a right to complain in Beliac
if they're paying their 26 or 28 bucks, don't they?
That's right.
And I just want to know how many more time
to see enough to fumble before we finally get rid of him?
Probably as many times as it takes for Don Schule
to convince himself that he can't get the job done.
And heaven help us before how long we figure that's going to be.
I don't know.
Hopefully something will work.
Can I ask you a question?
How come, like when Marino makes a real bad play
at a crucial time in a game or has a bad game?
And he's had several this year.
Marino says it was my fault.
I can't play anybody else.
I have to take responsibility.
I didn't get the job done.
He's the one of the few stand-up guys on the team.
We don't even try to blame our...
When Schule makes a call like that,
and he sends in a guy who you know is going to fumble the ball,
he doesn't say it was my fault I call the plays as well.
We just got to put this behind us.
Yadi, yadi, yadi, yadi.
How come he never takes a blame for it?
You're right about that.
I mean, you can't just keep getting kudos and credit
for those previous 300 wins.
We'd like to have a few more before we die, you know?
Is my right?
That's true, yes.
Have a great day.
Thank you.
See you.
Not that I want to get excited about this again today
is the last day for any of this, okay?
In spite of any intempered bashing or crap,
you're tired of hearing about this?
Too bad.
Okay, 132.
Hey, you got it in your system.
You have to win it out, let it out.
Am I right?
Even the Nots landing, ladies said,
put a lid on it already.
Did you say that?
Since Pat Peterson left the show,
she has been such a wreck, man.
She just can't control herself.
It's been so long the show has been on.
I don't even remember what it's about anymore.
130, what is it?
You did what?
Did I sit up here and let you take your picture
and let you humiliate and degrade
and make a circus up here?
Did I not subject myself to all this fall to all?
And now you're still hawking me a china kabad.
Just relax, okay?
40,000 years from now,
nobody will give a crap about any of this, okay?
Right, so just relax and have another beer, okay?
133 at WIOD, mobile in Miami, hello.
Are you there?
A mobile in Miami, who's about to speak?
I can't believe it, there's a sound coming
through the end of this thing, yes sir?
Yes, it's working.
Okay.
Well, first of all, I just find it so amazing
that they have Tony Nason as the running's back coach,
because that guy was notorious for fumbling when he played.
Well, at least he's a good teacher.
Oh, man, it's the most incredible thing.
And also, I'm finally glad that everybody's taking
Mandage and the gaki to task for this,
because they've been doing it all season long,
just ripping all the fans.
And I'm finally glad that that asshole's getting his-
Say, there's a difference between ripping front-running
phonies who don't show up unless you got a winner.
I mean, that's legitimate, I've been doing that
for years and I stand by that.
But to rip the people who do show up
and the people, the thousands of us,
including me who left early before that little episode
happened and to start painting everybody
with a big brush and a fan suck
and to try to turn it around.
That's a pile of crap.
And I am embarrassed and nauseated for those people
who listen and call into this radio station
who call into suck around to agree
every time those guys get on and say that crap,
because it's a bunch of garbage.
It is. I mean, when Sammy dropped the ball
and they recovered and they called it,
I immediately got my son, we stood up and we just walked out.
I was too disgusted to hang out anymore,
so I didn't really hear the episode.
Well, we stayed, fat rich and I were there,
just blowing our brains out.
We stayed, I mean, hoping we'd get the ball back one more time,
Houston started that series.
They made the first down, it was less than two minutes to go
and we had no time.
And at that point, you know, we're not getting the ball back.
We left.
So whatever the episode that happened was right at the very end,
thousands and thousands of people, including me,
were out of the stadium, but because we were there that day,
all of a sudden, we're guilty by association and we suck.
And the thing is that we're really pissed me off
because that he would let these jerks
that come from other towns like Philadelphia, Chicago,
or whatnot and ripped the fans that were there.
We're voicing their own opinions.
And like, he would just let them go on ad nauseam,
these apples that come here from wherever else they come from.
All they know how to do is to-
I'd like to hear, I'd like to hear Manichin Zagaki talk
about what would the reaction have been
to Sammy's second straight fumble in the end zone
if the game were played in Philadelphia if he was on the Eagles
or if the game were played in the Middolands,
if he was on a giant to the Jets,
what kind of reaction would he have had then?
He wouldn't have came out alive.
Well, Neil, have a good win.
Keep your blood pressure down.
See ya.
135 at WIOD.
You know, a lady in Miami purchased a red 1990 Honda Accord
for what she thought was a pretty good price.
The odometer on the car said only 8400 miles,
but surprise, when she got the car home
and looked in the glove box,
she found any missions test print out from June
that reported the car's mileage to really be 34,000 miles.
It's more than 25,000 miles more than she thought,
and that was four months ago.
In a panic, she called our friends at the 140 at WIOD.
Okay, we're gonna have another cheer from this crowd.
We still have, I almost every seat here is filled.
I can't believe it.
Don't not that kind of a cheer, not that kind of a cheer.
At the count of three, I want Neil Sucks, okay?
Because I want to prove that I can handle it.
I'm gonna leave here.
I may have a few tears running down my cheeks.
This guy's still doing a chop.
He's still chopping it.
Well, it's a good thing you don't have a pastrami over there.
So we could have some good sandwiches.
What is it?
What?
You know that snap on you brought was delicious,
but it's starting to back up just a little bit.
Okay, here we go.
Glenn, calm down.
One, two, three.
I want to trade.
140 at WIOD, I want to be traded to QAM,
so I can work with some real sports people
like my fault friend Eddie Kaplan.
There's a great guy.
20 bad handicapped, but a good guy.
19 till two at WIOD.
Now let's give the snaple away here
because these people are holding a hope out above hope
that they might get their name called.
Arlene's bill, Folk, La Bocca.
We got seven or four packs of snaple.
We're never gonna get to this.
Okay, because most of these people are going,
how are we gonna do this?
Where's Adam?
Adam is over there, hawk on the china.
Let's give the snaple away, okay?
I'll let you use your own discretion
so they can blame you.
Just wander around, find some people back there
that look desperate, that haven't won anything,
that looked like they're really needy,
that love snaple, that maybe you want to make a date with you,
and I'll come and watch.
Okay, we'll take care of that,
and that means that's it.
Okay, we did everything.
We give away everything that we had,
and hallelujah, and thank God for that.
Let's take a few more calls.
You know, by the way, I heard that promo.
Did you notice who was on that promo
in the last break who shined us on the one day
when we desperately needed them the most
when we could have used their assistance
when we're having all kinds of technical problems
and I was ready to pass out,
we're sitting, we're spitting over here.
Reconcords, you'll notice, shined today.
Not that I want to turn you on or anything like that
or that I want anybody to call and attack them
for being douchebags and turncoats.
Reconcords, total shined today.
I can't believe that.
Now, trust me when I tell you, okay?
Huh.
Huh.
We'll have rubbing my eyes.
Reconcords, ladies and gentlemen,
shined artists didn't show up,
and suds, by the way, is on the phone from the house,
not from the studio.
I got news for you.
If I were you.
We didn't want to show up because we were afraid they started chanting
that we thought, if I'd have been you guys,
I'd have stayed away from here today too.
Yeah.
I'd have held a wine on.
We weren't invited.
What if they started saying we suck?
We decided we were going to call in all of the sudden.
On three, Reconcides suck.
One, two, three.
Yeah.
They said it like they meant it.
Two, a couple of people said it two or three times.
Well, sure, our moms are there.
Boy, we could have used you here today.
I want to tell you, this is the mother.
Of course, considering it is my last remote broadcast ever,
I, you know, it's not.
I don't know what you're laughing about.
That's the Emma's, okay?
That is the living truth.
My show is out of the studio.
We got the cards, the phone.
It's comfortable.
Everything is.
I was on my way and then I heard what was going on.
I turned around immediately.
Chicken.
Total color.
You got it.
You're turning into another Zagaki lackey.
You probably didn't have the courage.
Hey, hey, let's keep in mind one to radio here.
It's right.
You guys probably had a facemet six o'clock.
Didn't have the courage.
No, they were out there.
No, I'm talking about tonight.
Oh, well, the show ends at five.
That's 50.
Now, let me ask you a question.
Since you have a sheet and I don't, who's doing sports talk tonight?
Football talk.
Shoel talk.
Who's doing it tonight?
I don't have a sheet.
You don't have a sheet?
Not yet.
It's not joking.
Oh, here we have a sheet.
Okay, we have a sheet.
It's Joe and Sunny.
Oh, yeah.
With Terry Cashman, baseball composer or poser.
We're talking baseball.
Well, that's a good way to sweep it out of the carpet, isn't it?
And then Hank, it says, no game due to World Series.
Yeah.
What does that mean?
That means that Hank is...
That's exactly what it says.
Hank is hanging out somewhere there.
It's not a game due to World Series.
What does no game do to World Series?
Yeah.
Exactly.
Well, they must have watched the first two in Minnesota.
I can't even speak anymore.
Well, hey, then we got to go.
Now, wait a minute.
Wouldn't you guys like to start a few minutes early?
Because you probably got a lot of material.
I always say, I have all this stuff here, and I'll never get to it.
Maybe today could be the day you get to all of it.
And then some.
Just be quiet.
And you might even...
You might even be able to play some of the cards out of Rax 1 and 2 if you play your
cards right now.
Okay, let's do the show, hey?
Drive home with the...
Oh, by the way, so what happened with that?
Okay, wait a minute.
We got a big crowd here.
Hold on.
We don't have to do this by phone call.
Everybody that wants the old rickensuds opening theme back.
Hands, let's see hands.
Ooh, pretty weird.
I guess you'll be pleased.
No, pretty weird.
Let's hear those people.
Okay, everybody that hates the old song is thinks it fits by the baby old song sucks.
Okay, everybody that doesn't give a crap one way or the other.
Oh, that's got the winner right there.
That's the one, okay.
Wow, by a landslide, wasn't even close.
Everybody that shuts the radio off at two o'clock.
Okay, let's say, oh, jeez.
Like I said, it's so good that you're over there.
Yeah, yeah.
There's no idea.
These people are brutal.
Okay, we'll be looking for you guys sooner than you can think.
Yeah, you can be right there.
And when Joe comes in, give him a big kiss for me, too, on the forehead if you can fight
it between those eyebrows.
You got it.
Tell him he makes me puke and tell him to get into...
Tell him to darken out his face on it, show on 39, man.
People are starting to talk.
Let's go to sunrise.
Hello, welcome to WIOD, your family station.
Neil, how you doing?
Pretty good.
Neil, how come the announcers in the play is down here?
They don't realize that when you pay your money, you have certain rights.
They cause there a bunch of shills, sir.
There are shills.
They cover up artists.
They suck around together.
They sleep together.
They have an incestuous relationship, and they can't tell it like it is.
How's that pronounced?
It's a good analogy.
I'll give you Eddie Arcaro used to get booed for $20 a ride at three to five when he dumped
on a favorite.
Right.
And I was one of them.
Hey, let me...
Hey, let me...
At the racetrack, the railbirds, the people that go down and stand right by the rail.
I have an occasion in the summertime when it's an ice day, you go down and stand by the
rail.
They come out for the post parade.
And the fans are like five feet away.
I mean, it's a captive audience.
And I remember one time at Yonkers, I'm standing by the rail, and Carmine Abatello comes
out from the post parade.
And there's like a whole bunch of these nearer, Carmine, you suck.
And I mean, they're screaming.
And guess what?
He goes in there and he does his business in the next race, whatever he's got planned.
You know how that goes?
And life goes on and that goes with the territory.
Of course it goes with the territory.
And he doesn't cry and say, I'm taking it, I'm going to freehold.
I'm not putting up with this thing.
I'm taking a red mile.
I don't like it.
Exactly.
It's part of the territory.
Of course.
And these guys are making big money.
And to listen to Hank and all these other sagretto and toning and this is shameful and
how could anyone person take the abuse?
What kind of crap is that?
We all get it.
And if you're in a public limelight, you take a lot of crap.
And if you get paid well for it, then you just smile all the way to the back.
It made a hell of Sammy going to go to the things he wound people.
Yeah.
Good luck to him.
Thank you.
See you.
Excellent call.
Finally getting my adrenaline going again here today.
147 and WIOD.
It says, please tell all these slime ball termite inspectors to inspect this from Mike
Petrazino of the Florida termite inspectors.
You're a great American Mike.
Inspect this.
Okay.

There he goes.
He looks like my bug man as a matter of fact, looks like I wrote a bad day.

153 our final few minutes.
I say with deeper grad here at the swap shop.
It's been a day that we won't forget for a long time or Orlando.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Neil.
OK, Orlando.
What's up?
Now I'm just calling you.
I haven't talked to you for a week.
You know, I just seen what's going on.
We could have used you out here today or Orlando.
A lot of a lot of guys.
I mean, girls out here that would love to have had a date with you Orlando.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, these two young ladies down here.
They would have just crawled all over your bones.
Oh, I guess it's like I got her tongue all the way down to her knee.
Oh, man.
Hello.
What is it?
Orlando, what happened?
I don't know.
And you got cut off there for a minute.
Don't worry about it.
Just keep talking.
OK, that's what I've been doing.
It worked for me.
Just keep talking and pretend that there's nothing's going on.
OK, now I just got back from New York last Wednesday.
Remember last time I talked to you.
Yeah.
I went to New York before I left New York.
And nothing to Sunday was my birthday.
Well, happy birthday, Orlando.
26, 27.
26.
Getting up there.
26.
26.
Why?
For a guy that old to look as good as this is pretty incredible, you know?
He thinks, you know, but I then you know, I went to a dolphin game on Sunday on my birthday.
Yeah.
Now, you were one of those guys that was sitting around at the end of the game saying,
Sammy Sucks, were you Orlando?
No, I wasn't.
I didn't do that.
OK.
I really didn't know.
I thought I kind of felt bad for him, you know, because I know he didn't do it on purpose.
Right.
You know, I know he could have put two hands on the ball going over.
Right.
I don't know.
Well, you can probably relate to that putting two hands on it, right, Orlando?
OK.
Yeah, wouldn't do it right.
Yeah.
Well, listen, it's always a pleasure to hear your voice.
The ladies down here are going to go out and buy 40 copies of your calendar and we'll
be seeing you around.
Great, Neil.
Great.
Nice hearing from you.
OK.
OK.
See you.
I'm going to go out and buy a couple of them.
I'm going to go out and buy a couple of them.
I'm going to buy a couple of them.
I'm going to buy a couple of them.
I'm going to buy a couple of them.
I'm going to buy a couple of them.
I'm going to buy a couple of them.
I'm going to buy a couple of them.
I'm going to buy a couple of them.
I'm going to buy a couple of them.
I'm going to buy a couple of them.
I'm going to tell you this.
I played golf yesterday with the Breeders Crab Group and the Joe Pavia team was 99-1.
Really?
And finished right where the odds would indicate.
Up the track.
Yes, sir.
The Nick Salvy team was the winner.
Nick Salvy.
Nick Salvy.
Oh, boy.
Where's Raven over when we need him?
There was nobody watching that team though, so you know those harness men.
Yeah.
A little hanky-panky on the back side.
Oh, I don't want to say.
OK.
We'll be there post-time 7 o'clock Friday.
I have a feeling our sports department will be there, but we'll somehow survive without him.
It's a big night.
OK.
Can die laughing wins?
Look out for three wizards, sir.
That's all I can tell you.
Richie Silverman talks a good game, but look out again for three wizards in the deep stretch.
They all twirled out last week.
12 dollars.
You're about four days too late.
I know it.
We had him.
OK.
We had him.
You didn't come and ask me, did you?
No, I didn't.
Eddie Kaplan came and asked me, so can anybody beat this horse?
I said three wizards.
Did you really?
Yes, I did.
It was a good tech.
Yes, sir.
Very good.
Have a great year, Dave.
OK.
Let's take this.
OK.
Move along here, Alex.
Let's go.
Let's go.
It's only got three minutes left.
Man, is he slow?
Four-letter day.
Hello.
Miami.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Where are you?
I'm in Fort Lauderdale.
OK.
Well, I'm on a head of you.
Go ahead.
Are you?
Yeah.
Yeah, Neil, I just got a big gun for a couple years.
I just wanted to have no bird.
You speak with him on the radio.
Hold who?
Bird.
Oh, the bird.
The bird.
The bird.
The bird is in Lakeland.
He's working at U-float them.
Is he?
He's floating them at U-float them, yeah.
Yeah, he's floating.
Yeah, we had little parting of the way, sir.
He's making a lot more money, maybe.
Oh, yeah.
He's making about $375 an hour now.
He's got that now.
No more free lunches.
In nice talking day, I enjoy your show.
I'm just back.
I'm moving, but it's nice talking to you.
Where did you move to?
Alabama.
Oh, yeah.
That's where I'm going.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
When?
OK, with a band you want my knee.
Have a great life, pal.
OK, Sheriff Nick is over here saying, man,
if you think it's repressive in Alabama,
just give me another couple of years, man.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
157 at WIOD.
Lakeland.
Is this the bird?
Everything's fine.
Yeah.
As long as I have my place of pizza.
OK, there he is, straight from Brickovan
with his slides of pizza.
Great.
OK, have a good nice life.
Get rid of him.
Miami, hello.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think I hold the record for the most
calls in one day.
What does that mean?
Did we hear it from him 400 times?
Well, that's what happens on remote.
You will, then.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I know you're running out of time,
so I'm going to get to the point real quick.
We're upset that we're running out of time,
but what the hell can you do?
It's only a four hour show.
Yeah, OK.
Sammy Smith, you were flaming first round
fumble-finger, Tom O'op Chopping,
seminal sucking douchebag.
OK.
Great job.
And we got some of the,
we got a couple of people here with guts
who applauded and agree with that.
Well, that's going to just about kick it in the head for us,
isn't it?
And I want to thank all of these people.
You have been incredible.
I just can't believe you, people, have been out here.
Some of them since 10 o'clock this morning,
they're sitting wondering when the hell the show starts,
but hey, listen, life wasn't built in one day, OK?
We did the best we could under difficult circumstances.
Enough sports tomorrow.
We're not going to talk about any of the fact.
I got enough material here today.
Believe me.
And we're going to talk about a great break.
Oh, I'm sorry.
We can't talk about the race victory around
because Glen from Irmer gets all psychotic and bent out of shape.
Well, we'll whisper about it, OK?
We'll just play the, the Tom Tom thing in the background
for four hours tomorrow.
Anyway, have a great life.
Thanks again for coming out.
Let's stick around for Rick and Suds.
I guess the verdict is with anything song,
it's still basically the same, right?
That's what they're trying to tell you guys.
We got football talk.
She'll talk at 605 tonight with Joe and the poor sonny
who gets rubbed in all of this crap.
Don't blame him.
And Hank has the night off tonight.
805.
We got it throughout the room in the car.
If you're lying on the beach, if you're just psychotic,
you're running around with answering your pants.
And you're not near a TV.
We got Game 3 of the World Series.
The Braves beat the twins.
805 tonight from Atlanta, Fulton County Stadium
and Butchup Jane.
See ya.
This is South Florida's
news traffic and weather station.
News Drop Radio.
610 WIOG.
Miami Fort Lauderdale in the Palm Beach.
And now we're at our WKIV Key West.
