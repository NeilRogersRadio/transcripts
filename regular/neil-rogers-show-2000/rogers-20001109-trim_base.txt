What? What's that?
It's special, though.
Yes!
Oh
Hello to a 560 WK. I'd like to point out before anything else today that all these old
geese who allegedly are so inept in people are pointing a finger at them. They've been
voting for years. They're the ones that actually turn out in vote, not just in Palm Beach,
but everywhere. So the idea that because they're old and people in a bunch of yinches, that
makes them stupid and unable to cast a vote that's a proper, I don't think so. And I've
talked a lot to people under the age of 100, people under 20s and 30s who voted in Palm
Beach. So I looked at that thing and I went like, yeah, see because I'll say it again.
Just like Bob Wixler just said on Fox News Network, the sample ballot and the ones in the
newspaper didn't show the punch holes. Remember I pointed that out yesterday? So they
don't show why it's confusing. In addition to which we're talking illegal ballot. I think
that's really going to be the crux of the whole thing. Now the difference is only 941 votes
scores, picking up lots and lots of votes in the recount. There's a zidian different
things to talk about here today. Do we have time? I don't think so. No. And that's with
only 32 out of the 67 counties in the state recounted. Now another interesting thing is that
last night, Pinellas County was doing their recount and they came up with Bush losing.
I forget I don't have the, I got too much stuff here in front of me. Bush lost about
40 votes and and Gore gained about 400 and some. We came to a difference of about 500 and
then they said, wait a minute, we're taking that back because there's some vote of the
word recounted and yadi yadi yadi and they got to do it again and we'll get paternalism
in the mommy today, which they have to seven o'clock tonight to get this all done. The
recount. But if you assume that Gore is going to pick up, say, even 400 more, that's just
in Pinellas County alone. Just one out of 35 counties still have to be recounted, which
will cut it down to 400 votes. And we get so much misinformation. First of all, for the
guy that called yesterday, well, and then this is my fault for not remembering. Parents
Thomas was confirmed the Supreme Court, his nomination by like 52 to 48. I think we don't
need two thirds of the Senate to confirm a point, a point either the justice is Supreme
Court. It's just a simple majority. That's number one. Secondly, that chronic right-winger
that calls us every day with his bogus statistics that's been telling us the expert on the
absentee ballots. Maybe he was down there setting a few thousand out because that's also
a big thing here, not just the vote and palm beach, but this real mystery of the absentee
ballot, which are some real great stuff written about that in the papers today. It says,
the Florida Department of Law Enforcement calls the absentee ballot in Florida the tool
of choice for those inclined to commit voter fraud. And like I said yesterday, first we were
supposed to believe there was 350,000 absentee ballots that it was a half a million and then
it was like all of a smigot. I mean, something's rotten in Denmark. Also, the overseas ballots,
which this genius that keeps chronic with these bogus statistics, Mr. Expert out there,
Thomas, all along he's been saying, oh, there's 30,000 of those votes from overseas. There
are two or 3,000 ballots overseas. There were 2,319, 1996 and Clinton won almost half of
them. I should point out. And this year are two to 3,000. They don't even know the exact
number. And in a vision to which the ballots had to be postmarked no later than Tuesday
election day, but the fact is many overseas votes were counted on election night because
they arrived before the polls closed. In other words, who knows? Who knows? Who knows
how many of them are actually still outstanding and how many will arrive by November 17th, which
is the deadline, which is still eight days away. In other words, yeah. So this is the way
it goes on. And I'm hearing more and more people talk about the fact that there's going
to be a reelection in Palm Beach. Let's do the poll on it today. Our poll from yesterday,
do you believe the election results in Florida are honest? 1,624 people are chimed in on
your wagers.com. 281 said, no, 79% said no. 247. Yes, that's 15%. Don't know 96% 6%. Our
poor question today should Palm Beach County be given another election? Yes or no? See,
we're not just talking about the 3,400 Buchanan votes. There are so many irregularities here
that I got about 600 pages from both newspapers here. And we don't even get to Palm Beach
post so I can imagine what's going on with that newspaper. But the regularities at the
S. And of course, the big headline on the front page of the Sun Central this morning is
about the 19,120 ballots invalidated in Palm Beach, just in Palm Beach County. Thousands
of votes were disqualified because they were punched twice in the presidential race. And
interestingly, a very, very heavy majority of those were by black voters. So here you
have got all Yentos who went to vote for Gore and Lieberman who wound up voting maybe
as many as 3,000 or more for Papu Kenan. And then you've got a lot of black folks. And
also we've got all kinds of stories about this. This is like something that before the Civil
War is it's unbelievable. Black people who weren't allowed to vote who were being given
a son advance by FHP. And by the way speaking of FHP, thanks to my good friend out there.
There you go. Got stopped for speeding on the way to work on the turnpike this morning.
Going 75 on the turnpike a little frustrated trying to get around somebody who was going 50
in the left hand lane. I'm going 75. Here comes the red lights. And for the nice FHP officer
who opened a window handed my registration driver's license. Look to me. It's a nice
to meet you Mr. Rogers. You're going 75 a little bit not not outrageous speed a little bit too
fast. He's just hanging on a second. He went back. He's writing and writing and writing.
I thought he's writing a ticket. I thought wow here we go with Randy Mulpass and the ticket
defense team again. And he came back and I written here a warning citation and said have a nice day.
Thank you officer. You're a hell of a guy. You're okay in my book. In Palm Beach County,
19,020 ballots invalidated. So if you take those 19,000 you tack out on the roughly 3,000
vote is Buchanan votes in Palm Beach which clearly by any measure are votes that were
intended for Al Gore. You're talking over 20,000 now. That's 22,000. And the balance right
now is Bush's head 941 votes and 35 counties still to be recounted. And part of the good
news of this is maybe people are thinking well you know that is good news if you're
for Gore. Hope that he wins. People are probably thinking well you know a lot of those
votes must have been in Broward. Guess what? Bush actually gained one vote in Broward in
the recount. So it wasn't in Broward. Wait till Voluzia County comes in with their recount.
Wait till Orange County comes in. And like I said wait till Pinellas comes in with their
final recount because it looks like Gore is going to pick up four maybe 500 votes maybe
more just in Pinellas County alone in this recount. And I'll say it again. You saw that
scene there on election night on all the networks. The Bush family sitting there very
confident very cocky just like now. All we want their stuff they're starting their transition
team now. What did I say the other day? On election day they believe that they can talk
themselves into something. It didn't work in New Hampshire and it's not going to work
now. You can't talk yourself into winning either you win or you lose. And then they come
up yesterday with a box mark 90. I guess it's precinct 90 and they showed the supplies
the flag and the crayons in there. That's only one. What about the one that we saw here
from the black church that was had the number 79 on it. So you know it's a different ballot
box that was supposedly filled with uncounted ballots. And isn't it interesting how after
they discovered this 93% black vote for Gore in the state of Florida that all sorts of
different things were revealed about the way the black vote was being handled and the
black's been turned away. Black votes not being counted. Not that there's any races in
the state of Florida. I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that. I'm not
that. I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that.
I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that. I'm not going
to say that. I'm not going to say that. I'm nothing. kort History book. The majority of
Americans. There's language, everybody has a White дог about Bearings Law and so today
people look like they were in the 60s but they were pretty eloquent college
educated they were asking them what happened when they were devoting booths and
they seem to be pretty intelligent people so they were saying concert with
everybody thought that it wasn't a bunch of old senile people right all I had
lots of facts yesterday from people who were like under the age of a hundred
who are and I looked at thing and I'm not a senile old fart yet I'm getting
close but I looked at that thing and unless you the holes see the problem is
it's illegal because even though goers name was listed second was on the
page the fact is he was listed as number five Bush was number three Buchanan was
number four and goers number five and the whole opposite the name wasn't in
line you see what I'm saying the girl hole if I hear maybe that's a new word
we got a girl hole is kind of like asshole boy hole yeah the great hole was
was should have been the second hole not only his name have to be listed
second but the whole that you punch has to be second in addition to which
for the law requires that the candidates for even of both parties came up with
this boys or ballots they had to be listed on the same page now you saw
were they on the same page of course not they they had that Monica give me more
head there on the bottom of the next page yeah they Clinton writing
candidates they had a couple of the people said that they even some of the
people they say punch two holes because they were confused the one person said
that because it was so confusing looking he thought that he was supposed to
punch for alcohol and so leave them in the way the names exactly and that's
where the 19 thousand votes got because you know it's well as I do you vote
punch both holes for president then your your voters invalidated yep and
and when you got the two holes both in that same little box Jesus is getting
the nasty but you've got a problem figuring out which one to stick I hate
when I know I know that I'm hearing one girl was almost in tears they were
interviewed when she said that she realized she voted for Buchanan and she had
even like volunteers but let me ask you this how did you feel if you're like an
old Jew you see Lieberman's on a ballot Palm Beach County was I think number
one in the world in hysterical old Jews lining up to vote for Jew Lieberman
and you go there to vote for this for the supposedly liberal guy which he's
not but in any and any wider voting for a fascist like Pat Buchanan and he was
on TV if I if I go into vote for Jaime Mosquit and you mind a voting for
Heinrich Himmer I mean you know you're not so too happy about it this car
how high was it was on earlier this morning and he says that they would have you
would have gotten more votes for yes or arrow shot at Palm Beach County than Pat Buchanan
that is absolutely correct yes sir and Pat Buchanan was on too and he admitted he
says well he was obviously if they were like two holes punched for president there
their gore and Buchanan he says obviously that it was gore people that
accidentally voted for me even he admitted yeah and that their his first reaction
was kind of like you'd expect but then yesterday I guess he was lightning
up and saying if they really wanted to vote for somebody else I don't want their votes
yeah okay well listen go vote again yeah and if we do get the new election
which I think is going to happen uh round them up have a wonderful day and you
too see here's a mobile in DC hello yes you know can you play it from George
Bush yeah okay five six seven oh five fifty a mobile in DC it's AC DC he's got
a finger in it right now back home uh-huh here's plantation hello hey how you
know okay now we got all the boys back and up the getaway car you got to
know and all these other guys on air saying well he's got to compete today we
we we we got to get the thing over with haha yeah they're in a big hurry we
we know as well as I do that you know what it's like when there's a light like a
like a like an a hockey game for example that I want to mention last night another
disaster but like if there's a dubious a call and they're in any sporting event
and then they want to get the game on like in football and nobody appeals a call
then once they snap the ball then they can't change their mind you know what I'm
saying everybody everybody say oh come on step-of-all faster they can't appeal
because we know we were wrong and that's and that's obvious that's how these
people are looking it's like the book it's like you know when Bush knows the DNA
comedy goes kill him anyway he won't step-man throw no tail exactly the whole
key to this is the boys are coming with the subpoena and say back will be a
bitch oh you got it uh and that's that's that's the irony of it all because that's
the way things get done and I hear Janet's gonna come down here personally just
showed her press conference as well she's going on there personal and beat the
crap out of men not going to shape when when they start putting jabs are under
a what what with with these little little deals going on here you talk about
irregularities here are these boxes of eight bags full of ballots in
Valencia County disappeared and then all of a sudden they showed up again I mean
there was more desperate attempts to fix this election because they knew the
blackboard and the Jewish folks that was what was going to put the nails in the
coffin of the Bushmeister a lot of the thing that's what do I think Ed Rollins
was with with found guilty of throwing walking around money around remember that
he had boy yet hundred dollar bills he's to hand it out to people remember that
they yeah the scandal and he's on there going well the other thing that
when this is the way elections are run in this country and this is this is
you know everybody knows it miss the way elections are on now except
it's less than and a and a clean up right away to say I got to go just one
second to be counted we think of their count of fairly it'll be pretty clear
that I don't want to hear one the only one the knowledge as well the
popularizing I can't I say I cut him off but that's okay here this time was up
still line 41 but you really can't tell because you're dealing with millions
almost six million votes there it's still line 41 we don't have anything new but
as soon as we do I'm on MSNBC I'm on CNN I'm on top of it I'm in it I'm out
of it still 941 with 35 counties yet to be counted all you can say is I'll
say it again some of those supposedly overseas ballots already were counted
because they arrived before the deadline on election day and they were counted
so and the best part of the deal is they're saying oh we don't have any idea
how many areas to be counted they have no idea nobody knows nobody knows the
trouble we've seen you got to say one thing if nothing else as screwed up as
this state is between all the stuff that goes on in Dave County with
alien all the other garbage that goes on and now this bogus election at least
we get some excitement we don't have too much good excitement but we get
whether it's bad excitement but at least we get some excitement here's
90 beats hello 90 beats yes sir just wanted to point out I hate to cite the
total was like an example here but in addition to the 19,120 votes and
Palm Beach that were valid and validated yes sir there's initial 17,000 in
day day County yeah that's right okay with in black areas of Dave County
yeah if you look at the counties that have reported there were two things that
jump right out at you in new vow county who picked up a hundred and eighty
four votes 16 for Bush you look at Palm Beach and glove picks up seven hundred
and fifty one you've just had those two together that's almost all the the
votes that that get counted in that in the Gore column all the other
counties are fairly close but the two wide variants are Palm Beach and new vow
yeah but no we haven't had Voluzia County which there was a big stink up there
we also don't have panelists which we know it's going to be four to five hundred
votes there boys gonna pick up yeah one other thing and then I'll get off
here the all of the networks use a kind of a food computer system now they know
when they make a prediction they know the vote count that they have and they
also have the sort of demographic idea of the way the vote should go now on that
basis they predicted or yeah all of a sudden come this company me stuff that
doesn't make any sense I don't think it was the network that made it the
state I think it's the the huge data that the republicans provide well you know
it's funny because I it was either Kim Russell to Bob Sheeper I remember I
remember just minutes after they took back the early projection and Florida
going to Gore and one of the the network funded said there's a problem with
some of the precinct in Dade County and as soon as I heard that I thought oh
here we go yeah it was uh it's with angel action yeah okay good luck to us you fight
here's a fact that says as you know the selection has been pretty close but in
Florida as long as two weeks ago there were rumors that some kind of voter fraud
would take place we can see evidence of such fraud now where Dade County took
as long as New York State to count its votes and the process did not count
15,000 votes and black areas tenons of votes were not okay damaged in West
Palm Beach there were 19,000 votes also not counted and discarded and 3,000 more
counted for be cannon intended for Gore and it was not about a little paranoia
here but yeah I'll say it again based on everything I'm here and then leading
this morning those ballots are not legal because the hole isn't the second
hole got to be delicate the way we described this but the the Gore hole has to be
right under the bush hole remember that the hip-hop connected to the red bone
and the air hole connected to the b hole and it was not they stuck at Buchanan
hole but we know it's a lot of it he's a man's hole they stuck at Buchanan
hole in the middle not acceptable and you both are and and nobody I don't
hear anybody including me we're not suggesting that it was done the confused
people that it was done in a partisan way it was done by stupidity because
there's plenty of stupid Democrats and 20 stupid Republicans which both parties got
together and approved that ballot crap in Palm Beach that kind of a ballot
unacceptable any legal here's West Palm Beach hello okay
sounds like you're a little sour graced you little boy what what does that mean
don't you don't you think that whoever the one the election should read the
president or you're gonna rule yeah so what a moron so I'm taking to the
sour graced land what are you gonna say are you gonna be singing sour if this is
the kind of children the kind of juvenile assholes that we're dealing with go
back to New York asshole go back to New York what I'm moron see my philosophy is
whoever got the most votes that who should win and since the election is
determined even though Gore's only had about a hundred thousand the popular
vote he still had there but that doesn't mean anything whoever get one's the
270 plus electoral votes he becomes the president and I have this
real bizarre very partisan theory that whoever won the Florida election should
get the 25 electoral votes if Bush wins it he's the president if
grow and he's the president Scott nothing to do with sour graced but you're
looking overgrown child and what really is what's really bugging you and you can't
stand is the fact that everybody won't say okay we're gonna coordinate the
King Bush here and just go ahead you know you fix it up real good and we're not
gonna fight it we're gonna be the great healers that's not gonna happen because
that's what assholes like you would love to see happen and see the Bush
people with the governor with his brother the two governors helping each other
steal the election right and broad daylight are we gonna let that happen no no
we're not and then you're gonna be squealing sour grapes all the way back to the
Bronx you New York asshole you 26 after 10 at 560 WQM if you're fat and I'm sure
that last guy's probably about fat or nine you can just you can just envision him
can't you want those big New Yorkers are the huge big beer belly the big puppet
oh not to make you want to puke real hairy Floridians done out church okay 10 30
at 560 WQM we have anymore overgrown children like the asshole at New Yorker
from Palm Beach County don't waste your time okay you'll be on like two
seconds what's the point are we gonna we have gotta be our man like I said I
wasn't happy at the 2 30 in the morning on Tuesday night Wednesday morning
whatever once when they all declared Bush the winner but I said okay that's it
gave it a good shot didn't what I like to bed I wake up yesterday morning and
will be hold it still up in the earth in limbo limbo case a Ross or Rob but this
idea that well just let us steal it and the stop client's our grapes and let us
roll off into the sunset and see a election I don't think so let's coordinate
King George no I don't think so and don't forget King George had a bad list
here's a more blood west palm hello okay I'm a Republican in West Palm I did
vote on the ballot let me tell you it was confusing it needed a second look I
feel like you do you know the bottom line is at 2 30 in the morning you know I'm at
this point with this election wherever the chips fall let them fall however the
one thing that you normally get really excited about I don't understand just
Jackson and flight Al Sharpton and flight you know here they put it on the side of
this Al Sharpton should have his ass kicked out of this day because Al Sharpton was
sitting up there sucking Ralph Nader's butt in New York the baby 40 election and he
has no business being here as far as Jesse's concerned let him steer them all up you
know what I'm not okay I'm not trying to catch up I don't like Jesse Jackson
anymore than you do although you got to admit that he's a smithy steward let me
ask you this you really believe that in South Florida Valuesia County when we
take you know the moronic level of this country all across America yeah that
bags weren't dropped off here and delivered a day late here everywhere else I
mean the honestly believe that this is where it happens he only reads well let me
ask yeah how come we're not hearing about it anywhere else because it's where the
state maybe it's 25 votes so now in an edition of which Palm Beach County out of
67 counties Palm Beach County was the only one that had the problems with the
voter confusion because it's the only one that had the ballots screwed up
no I totally agree with that and you know what throw the vote out I don't believe
in a revote because both parties agreed on it well what do you mean you don't
believe in a revote so you're going to disenfranchise all the people in Palm Beach
County because the ballot was illegal that's not the way it works those people
have a right to have their vote counted I'm sure you'd like to see that because
then that's inches of for books but that's not the way it works those people
first people just can't be told well we give you an illegal ballot so
therefore you can vote of course not those people still have a right to cast
their vote who gave us an illegal ballot who gave it to you the the powers that
be in in Palm Beach Democrats and Republicans whoever the ones were the people
were responsible for that illegal ballot supervise their election
Democrat it doesn't make any difference you want you want to do it on the
technicality I'm not saying I'm not saying it was done partisan I'm saying it was
done by ineptness and the ballot is illegal okay you know let's just the one
step further and I'll leave you alone okay all right as I said you already I at
this point don't even it really doesn't matter to me because you know as
well as I do focus on the public they're not the own men yeah so it really
doesn't matter I mean as far as I'm concerned I look let's face it I mean I
grant you it was a terrible choice I said that from the beginning but the fact
is can't we agree on whoever won the most votes you get the election
Neil absolutely no doubt in my mind okay in fatically yes okay good luck to
us thank you thanks 98 votes at our first with Palm Beach kind of be given
another election 83 yes 15 no over 80 percent well over 80 percent so yes I think
that's what you're gonna see happen now it's 85 and a half percent on the new
reload here scored scored it's reloading MSNBC is doing something which I don't
know if CNN I'm not gonna turn it because I have to I feel like I got to keep
watching that so the second that there's a change we can pass it along to it but
at the bottom right hand corner in fact at the bottom of the screen they're showing
the actual popular vote in in Florida and in the right hand corner it shows
Bush leads by 941 they're gonna keep changing that immediately as soon as
new numbers are released in this county by county recount they got to seven
o'clock tonight to do it and there's no reason why they shouldn't be able to do
it fast enough it is absolutely unbelievable here's Boca hello hey Neil I'm so glad I
have to follow that guy let me answer him very quickly the reason you're not
here about this in other states they don't have Jeff Bush is their governor thank
God oh my God I remember the first time that he ran against child I'm saying to
myself you know what is what is Jeff Bush doing in Florida what's his
connection to Florida probably the same thing Hillary was doing in New York I
would imagine well let me just take this a step further grab some power well
yeah but I think this is an orchestrated plan from way back then of course it is
just like the Kennedy's did the same thing the powerful rich these are the
people there were the the Roosevelt's the Rockefeller's the Kennedy's the
Bushes this is an aristocracy that we've got these are the guy then emperors of
the universe here absolutely they didn't vote George Bush at George W.I. on us
until they had Jeff set up down here right and they got big I jump waiting in the
wings well this time this time he's a shot himself in both feet I hope so Neil
let me ask you if you were gonna pick one one state in this country to corrupt
an election which one would it be you're in it pal absolutely open a window look
around you can smell it I just want I want everybody to open their eyes widely and
see what's going on and thank God I think it's finally starting to you know
to come come to life and I just don't think that there's any way that they can
give this thing to Bush I think to quote a famous football coach who turned out
to be a real asshole we got a shot absolutely have a great day pal
Joe Costello 67 Saturday morning and this week Sunday 9 a.m. till noon because
of that big NASCAR thing down here why from the event so all you motor sports
people the infamous Joe Costello two chances for the price of one and actually
when some people are awake Sunday morning from 9 to noon look for a
default and a Q and Vand at the Citco gas station corner of 177 the Collins
Avenue Miami Beach noon to two they'll have the best of the LCDs because that's
teachers and teaching that's the Citco gas station corner of 177th and Collins
Avenue Miami Beach all you to with D.Fo who's everywhere that man is just
he's at the hockey game up there and the I've got boot loudly too I should point out
here's a mobile in pop and oh hello and you know how you doing great
I can't agree with that last call and said the call it before you have it had a
little bit on the money I mean you know a lot of things bother me and a lot of
the people bought this election I voted in Palm Beach I looked at that I put it
in the slot and I said this is a little confusing but I look five or 10 seconds
yeah and I said okay here's who I'm voting for and here's how it goes the thing
that bothers me the most is this if the ticket or the or the the
form was bad and they didn't correct it before it happens that's too bad if you
put it really wait a minute what do you mean it's too bad well you know what if
they if they look at it and they and they want you to calm down for a minute
take up that and listen to them all right all right the race for the for a
congress between Elaine Blooming Clay Shaw which Shaw allegedly was ahead by
5.63 at the last count there were some precinct in their district in Palm
Beach County because they heard that district is part of Palm Beach and the
date and proud right along the coast that didn't even have her name on the
ballot now you're suggesting because it because the ballot was wrong there that
was you should just say well too bad I lost because that's really not the point
and then what are you saying the ballot is illegal and those votes can't count
all right let me tell you the point I'm trying to make is this they knew if I mean
just looking at that ballot they should have known that it was a legal number
one and number two the people that thought that they voted for the wrong
person why did they wait until they voted and put their their tickets in the
ballot box before they came up with the idea that hey I might have voted for the
wrong person what I'm only asking this what do you do if you've already put
your ballot in that box and I voted right nearly on Tuesday morning what do you
do if you do that you're gonna go back in and say okay you got to open the box
and go through all the ballots and we have to go through the computer numbers
and try to match up which one is mine that's not gonna happen absolutely
we're done you're right so how can they do it they can't they can't repote
this a lot they're sure they can in Palm Beach County they can naturally if the
courts declared that the ballot was vague or that it was even illegal sure
they can be could do in Palm Beach now let me ask you one question now how do they
correlate like when I when I got the card the first thing I looked at I signed my
name I got the card and I said well how do they know this is my vote there's no
correlation there evidently there evidently somewhere I never cared there's a
barcode somebody called explainer yesterday I thought just like you do that
they couldn't tell who there's a barcode on the top part that they tear off and
they put that envelope and the same one matches up that goes in the ballot box
well I'll tell you what to say can do that then then I am for I'm near one of
them for these two meatballs I can't believe that they're gonna cut it for
the party yeah come off with anybody better than this right but if they can do
that if they can literally match up who voted for who and when they should do
it and the thing that bothers me the most is that and it really does bother me
you may think it's it's not and I'm not for going I'm not for Bush yeah is that
court couldn't win this home state if you want a home state we're if you know
that when you run for the Pran on national election you don't have to win
specific states whether it's your home that's the dumbest thing I ever heard in my
life he couldn't win his home state so different is that make an
addition to which Tennessee is the most one of the most Republican Yahoo red
next state in the history of mankind to become more Republican by every minute I
am in fact the case we could have had just the election that could have just
voted in Tennessee in Texas and then said okay well Bush won Texas and
law of Tennessee so that's it and the election Bush is the king well that's
pretty silly he couldn't win his home state oh they couldn't
win on their home field after I should say sports thing now what it is but
Neil Roger show sports radio five sixty okay here's a fact it says one
question why in Palm Beach County on the top of the ballot was George Bush's
name first and not the Gore I spoke in my mom in Maryland on her ballot
was on top I can ask it that very easily the state law requires that whoever
whichever party has the gubernatorial as the governor of that state this
stated to be a Bush being a Republican in Maryland of course as a Democrat so
that's why alcohol was listed first whoever the candidate of that party is
for president shall be listed first the governor and whoever won the second
most votes in the gubernatorial election the most recent election has to be
listed second that's where a big part of this problem lies that even though
Gore's name was under the Bush name the hurl that you punch for our Gore
wasn't directly opposite we got a whole problem
what is I just reading about here it says the representative Robert Wreck
Wreck Wreck was on the Sunday C right now produced a memo from La Pore that's
that brought up there the elections the supervisor in Palm Beach County to
poor workers telling them to remind voters only to vote for one candidate and
follow the numbered arrow to the whole Wreck's Wreck showed it said it showed
La Pore knew there was a problem Pam Eiorio had of the Florida State
Association of Supervisors of Election said Palm Beach County was the only
county in the state to use the so-called butterfly ballot formation Eiorio the
election supervisor for Hillsborough County said the ballot configuration is
up to the county supervisor and then it goes on to say a single ballot page of
presidential candidates as they preferred design used in Michigan and Illinois for
example in Los Angeles they had seven that said we had no bound the capacity
issues County McCormick registered recorder for Los Angeles County which has
4.1 million registered voters they had seven candidates on one page which is
all the candidates who are one including Monica whoa hard whatever that was
but not in Palm Beach in Palm Beach confusion and then the idea that you've got
to disenfranchise people and accept their votes based on a techicality based on
oh you shouldn't own better that's not acceptable that's not the American
S&W and speaking of that here's no him Ken so I want to echo what Congressman
Wettler said and you asked me the question what's the problem with the Palm Beach
County ballot the other day and I went back and did some research the bottom line
is that the Palm Beach County ballot is statutorily deceptive even if
confusion was not an issue amongst the voters and I want people to understand
this because any citizen can make this claim whether they're Republican or
Democrat 101.191 of Florida if a one-sentence statute to read so simply it
says the general election ballot shall be in the following form to vote for a
candidate whose name is printed on the ballot mock across in the blank space at
the right of the name of the candidate for the desired vote and the words at
the right are in capital letters bold what this Palm Beach County election
commission did is on her own she changed what the state ballot must legally
be she said she did it because she wanted elderly voters to be able to see it
better that's all well and good but what she did was the statutorily designated
government official violated the state laws and what a ballot should legally
be and she made an illegal ballot and the proper judicial reminit ultimately
could be for the clear all the votes for president that were made in Palm Beach
County non-invoid order a new election just for president on a ballot that is
constitutionally and statutorily proper it's that simple she on her own
change what the state ballot must be we've looked at her ballots compared it to
all the other 66 counties in the state this is the only one that's wrong yeah
so there you go it's very conceivable that separate apart from whether or
not or or bush conceives this afternoon based on the recount oh that's not
gonna happen that that a group of citizens on their own challenging this
ballot could find in a court that the ballot was illegal improper and water
a reelection justice the president after those people who voted why do you think
mm-hmm now what what would be a reasonable time for him if they did
ramp on beach or real another election I think that because the electors don't
the electors vote like in early January they vote actually they need to
number 18 so what could reasonably happen is this could speed through the
courts within the space of seven to ten days and they could designate a
revoke within thirty days only allowing those people since people when they
vote they have to as you know sign the form allowed those people who voted on
November 7 come back on beach county alone and let them vote solely for the
presidential race on a ballot that is statutorily exceptionally pretty easy
because they have all those a road or a registration rules and all the
signatures so they know who is entitled to vote right it is not that difficult a
task to pull off and to pull it off within thirty days they can designate a
special election and prepare a new ballot overnight so I was right before when I
said that the ballot in Palm Beach was illegal no question in my mind no
question in the mind of anybody that's a lawyer of any sort that the ballot in
Palm Beach is illegal it's directly attributable to the negligence on the
part of the government official that prepares the ballot and it doesn't matter as
Congressman Mark Foley tried to say last night on Riley Kingline Congressman Mark
very deep in the you know what Foley tried to say that well this was
published in advance and people had a right to look at it in advance that's
legally in consequence or Mark the point is the burdens upon the government
officials to prepare an acceptable ballot and the fact that nobody challenged it
in advance just doesn't matter right okay so look it up there you go nice
none we have to go to guards her next he said a special message up move just
across the semigo actually would have there are foreign customers that are well
well thank you so much nice Nick and at Frank we got the pin-out of there so Nick
got the a pin-out in the as the car business he got the middle man out and
so it's actually the right and we got our middle man Frank Jackass there in
sales we got him out of the picture leave me okay so there you have it right
from the illegal Beagle's horses mouth Palm Beach County Commissioner Bert
Aaronson in discussing the alleged votes for Buchanan said I don't think we
have three thousand not to use it Palm Beach County nice God bird yeah oh
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18 T and four eyes
and wireless lines nothing new under recount here's the facts so there's a
copy of the ballot to some friends in this report came from one of the most
intelligent women I know he says would you believe that we are two of those
people in Palm Beach County we registered to vote in Florida because we
knew going needed our votes in Florida more than in Illinois and so we
requested absentee ballots when the ballots arrived I opened the envelopes to
use them I was taken aback by the layout of the names I had a sit down with a
straight edge and line up my selections with a circle to be pierced that I did
the same for Harry's ballot until nearly 15 minutes to complete the process can
you imagine voters facing the situation the booth align a voters waiting
outside to get their votes cast and go on about their business I'm beginning to
wonder if even I voted accurately there should be a new election with a
revised ballot for voters in that district et cetera and so on amen nice
going to look at them
here's your field be chill out yeah me a lot working that one of these out the
conquered communities in Boka and you've got to see the chaos it's going on
it was the funniest thing that's why I've had in a while and these people you
know they they just they think they voted for Heinrich
uh...
yeah
must be having a best laugh of his life no not now he's not now he's uh...
become very every pent up about the whole thing is that if he's both
were intended for him that they ought to go to a war and a herbivore intended for
and he's a good man
at least for today anyway thanks you okay thanks
here here here's when it's marine doubts college he says all heck let's just
keep Clinton as I said yeah nice to learn marine I agree
let's call a whole thing off and just keep up in there for a few years to
you know who cares about the guy named Constitution anyway
here's called the goals hello
any yes sir
I mean it should be a election but they should be like the whole they should do a
whole state
we'll let
why
well obviously palm beach is a very democratic county so you're going to have
one very democratic county doing a
doing a reelection
that's that's not the only we don't do reelection it's not a question of
whether
the party must be in other words I can't say anything in response to that okay go
ahead make a little speech
I look at the ballot yeah and I'm pretty sure that if you vote on that ballot
and I vote on that ballot we would have voted for the person we wanted
now because somebody said they can't see or
celebrate or they can't
it is it's very obvious that anybody listening to you including me that you're
trying to talk your way out of this it isn't going to work and we just got
just before you we had Norma on there talking about the fact that the
Palm Beach County ballot doesn't conform a state election law it's an
illegal ballot so the fact that you like the current outcome or the fact that
you would like to have another statewide vote which would give the Bush
machinery an opportunity to have another set of the where we can there's no
way that we can afford to go through that embarrassment again no chance see
this guy's problem is he knows Palm Beach is heavily democratic he knows that
there's 20,000 votes mostly black votes that got ripped off with the double
piercing in there so you don't get the double piercings man it's back for your
health and that these old Jews that voted for Buchanan who wanted to vote for
he knows it's a lost cause you're trying to talk your way out of it you know I
want to say something to you in all fairness in all honesty to urge W. Bush
ran about this business of bringing integrity back to government who's the most
honest and who's the most honorable and getting all this book crap up well if
that's the case then how come he and his henchman there are are forming their
goddamn transition team and they keep trying to talk themselves in but like okay
okay let's go continue already what we want as opposed to saying we're going to
go along with whatever process is necessary to make sure that whoever actually
won the vote is going to be the next president I haven't seen one slight bit of
humility or fairness of anything because it's not a their vocabulary the
Bush family doesn't know the meaning of those words any of them they have this
sense of entitlement it's here to have and nobody's going to take it away from
them so please don't give me this song and it's about it's not fair because
it's in Palm Beach County now for what have been in DuVal County for
example or even even there a goal on a pit and screwed out of 400 both in the
recount yet it ain't got 400 more it would have been some heavily republican
county then he'd be singing a different tune you don't you don't have
re-election based on the political preference of the people in that area
you do it on wasn't the election was legal and proper or not and it wasn't what
this may 1056 and and don't even forget this this all this is all over and
above the challenge to the absentee ballots which think the high heaven on top
of it which also should help to explain you why all the networks declared
go of the winner based on all the information the exit for the break out that
they had a real absentee ballots they factor that all in and now because
I remember Mary Magdal getting all whiny but oh they got all those absentee
ballots so these networks are going to be sorry they and and Bill what's
the name Schneider got very upset about that on CNN said we take that into
consideration we have that information that's part of our our thing of all
the statistics we put in there but as the night went on all of a sudden 350
thousand became 500 thousand became a million absentee ballots and God only
knows where they came from
4.850560 WQA and Miami Port Lauderdale a beastly broadcast group stage and WQA
and dot com or the world
there's a new launcher shell
this is your brain
any questions
go there now they're not saying go away the very nice and polite but there are
no new members and yesterday the decision was made to release these numbers
county by county as they came in what we're trying to find out is that they
changed their mind are they going to release them all at once for some reason
but right now no new numbers just an indication of our viewers through there
was a there was a room just in front of us here that we apparently are going to
get numbers released possibly by paper form when they come in but again that's
not completely clear just yet other thing we want to point out right now
James and Andrew who is the lead surrogate the former secretary of state is
standing out here in the plaza with reporters right now he apparently is going to
talk more about his dealings with the secretary state Catherine Harris here
in the state of Florida yes you know his role along with William Christopher's
role who was the surrogate for war is to kind of
oversee this process of the recounts and leading up to the certification of
the results but how do you do that frankly I mean if he set up stairs and
oversaw anything would be someone taking the phone call or a fact and we'll have
to find out which what more there is to this because what's going on is
really outside of Calhassi in terms of looking at ballots that were
voided and things such as that we talk with James Baker who is running life
you're on CNN he was quick to point out that there is no evidence right now any
indications of foul play Republicans are not making that charge in any sense
more in a second with Mike with first act of Atlanta and Darren Kagan there is
breaking news in another part of the country down back to you that's right
there were a lot of questions on election night about what was taking place in
Missouri questions now being raised by Senator Kit Von of Missouri let's go
ahead and look at the next. To me this is prime of face evidence that there was a
scheme underway to have the voting polls kept open in the Democratic areas with
me is Thorhan and a attorney who was monitoring that process and
participated in overturning the order of the court by in that process we found
other acts of a parent-wereful at least dereliction of duty when dozens of
ballot boxes are left ungodly when we hear evidence that judges may have
improperly allowed unregistered voters to vote when we hear of a number of
the activities that went on I think the evidence and on me major
experimental enterprise wow first of all Bush won Missouri Burry Handley although
the Carnahan thing they see another pissed off at the dead man but you know I
and I brought that up I brought that up first thing yesterday morning about the
fact that this judge oh yeah let's talk to people in St. Louis which of course is
mostly a very heavily a black and a lot of a democrats let's put them all
vote another three hours then the other judge said no I don't think so so they
did give like a certain amount of extra voting time and wasn't that was enough
to make the difference in the senatorial election remains to be seen how do
you like that vine america baby here's a mobile and booker hello I knew how you
done okay I just want to echo something enormous that I live in
a book or time I've you know there's nothing's been said really about this
butterfly you know ballot the one thing it really hasn't been brought out is
the instructions that were provided by the election the supervisor election
told you to mark your selection to the right of a candidate nothing was ever
mentioned about any candidate on the left hand side of the ballot instructions
were wrong say that again she the instructions were to mark your one the
instructions will provided to a face they all shook this a booklet right I
know I know I have that here somewhere okay on the instruction page on how to
vote right I chose you to make your mark and punch all the way through to the
right of the candidate how can you do that if you have candidates on left hand
side of the page
but it was you couldn't if you wanted to vote for Buchanan you have to vote to
the last thing right now I never thought about that that's an excellent point
excellent so even the instructions were invalid the instructions were in
valid right I don't know if anybody's ever addressed that never heard that on the
national news so I think you can't allow the protest to absolutely because
anything and you know that there's more head yeah yeah but the point okay
thanks pal excellent point okay how do you like that so it's totally screwed it
up in Palm Beach as opposed they've only had 70 million elections in Palm Beach
County over the years just like all the rest of us but as opposed to just doing
it the good old fashioned way that seems to work all the rest of the time no we
have to come up with something new and innovative and exciting and confusing
and anybody who saw the long lines at the polling places on to they realize
is that you feel a certain amount of urgency no matter how old and people you are
or maybe how much or whatever your other circumstance may be a certain amount
of responsibility a hustle along and get it done as opposed to just standing there
hovering over to you God damn ballot trying to figure it out for a half an hour
you can't do that it is absolutely mind-boggling here sunrise hello you know
you've got some of these people calling saying Democrat the election supervisor
approved this both parties looked at it they say else to note that the principal
right for a legal and unconceiving ballot wants to the voters really does
matter if it was Democrats Republicans whatever the voters are at the
principal right when it comes to voting they have the right to a clear legal
power right in an additional which if if I were sitting here anybody also
supporting a figure and saying oh well this was designed intentionally to
confuse the voters nobody is saying that nobody is saying it was done
intentionally for that reason but the end result in the outcome is what's
in doubt exactly have you been have you checked out bushwatch dot com recently
yes that links to other stories there are problems in other county I don't
know if you get to them one of the most egregious they got a link to a cbs
new story is about the lish county right which I don't know if that's one of
the counties that's reported in the recount no not yet I don't know if you read
that Jane Harris the social candidate right that and this is on Bushwatch that
9888 votes in bullish accounting he got a total statewide of 10471 so over 90%
of his votes came from bullish accounting that is very hard to believe it's
not the people's Republic of the Lusia County unbelievable the second thing is
then do all county which you mentioned briefly before it's also on Bushwatch
that guy email this to them they have a link to a Washington post article 9%
over 9% almost one out of 10 ballots in Duval County had no selection for
president now meal this was an election where there were 10 candidates on the
ballot that can be old days when they want to give you Republican Democrats
maybe you can make an argument as a protest people would leave for president
blind but as they try to tell me that people who actually went to the polls and
who actually voted that almost one out of 10 wanted to leave president blank I
don't believe that and that this is also on Bushwatch I recommend everybody go
to Bushwatch they have the links to the articles the original sources land
of sentinel CBS news I mean some of this other crap is unbelievable and I'm
wondering if some of this is what the delay is here on the recount it hasn't been
a new county posted today and I believe in up until last night it's been
some time so it's pretty interesting we're keeping a around all right yeah the
Bush brothers are work okay thanks thank you yeah there's nothing new like
bill hummering that guy said a couple minutes ago but we're there CNN is doing
the same thing monkey see monkey do I don't know which one started a
good surprise the other keeping the count right at the bottom of the screen still
Bush ahead by 941 but they still have 35 more counties to recount plus the
mysterious number of overseas ballots which who knows what that's going to be
when they're all going to get hit and how many have already been counted and they
have to look ever 17 for just eight more days now some of these sends me a
copy of the Howard ballot which I voted on that and is this illegal it says
punts the second spot on your absentee ballots vote for Gore and you just
voted for Bush which I don't understand that because it looks pretty pretty
clear to me I don't get that but anyway and again you really don't know
anything because if you don't see the holes if you can't see the hole where the
hole is and I know there are a lot of folks who have problem with that but
otherwise it doesn't mean any of them.
10 times the letter to 560 WDQ went only under banana republic baby only in Miami
and Palm Beach
everybody's taking a brand new now
no more baby take a little portion if it's not seen inside of you making you
feel now no more baby take a little portion no not to give it to we did it to you
just back on the baby if the stick turned blue so come on come on say to fill a
portion on me
oh look at this we got another rally coming up maybe maybe we'll need to have a
potlock supper I think let's leave the rallies to Jesse you know what I'm saying
for all of you who are outraged by the oh this is unbelievable in South Miami is
there any reason to have a rally in South Miami that I can figure out no
crap every time we have some kind of a problem we have all these people want to
and party in the streets and we're going to be a little from Bob's once again probably
because he's involved now you know he's on the phone all I do know that he sent me
a fact yesterday congratulating me a lot of wonderful job I'm doing which you're
coming from you Bob it has no credibility whatsoever so say about facts paper
and I'm sure that even though his name is not in the state they think that they can suck me
well we don't promote all kinds of rallies but there's no need for them
Jesse's got his first I mean his people out there and they're doing their thing
and they were disenfranchised and treated I'm trying to find out there are only 8000
articles in both papers here so one about where the black people were like
black men were stopped by FHP guys at the ballot places and had their
criminal records checked and were turned away I mean they did everything in
their power to discourage black turnout in this state can't imagine why can
you know the fact that they voted ninety-three percent for Gore can't figure that
out not that there was any pattern in the state of just absolute sheer voter fraud
on Tuesday then we had that road block up there in telehancey which is
coincidentally in a very heavily black area was only 1.4 miles from the polling
place where they just pull everybody over because they wanted to save gas yeah
that's right's part of their gas conservation program
oh this is just beautiful yeah let's have recounting this constant in Iowa
now here's one that's interesting that conflicts with what Norm said before
this is a half-disagree with it our using is voting machine ballots which is
not covered which is covered under one of 1.27 that's the statute that gives
a 30 the county supervisor of elections I'm not in turn he just a citizen who
can read and has a web connection so anyone who wants to try to get a
revolve based on a faulty ballot design won't find what they're looking for in
the statute that norm cited so
293 votes out our polls should pop each be given another election 228 say yes
that's 78% 65 say no that's 22% it says apparently the Monday morning
quarterback Republicans complaining about the dumb Democrats who were confused
by the Palm Beach ballot have never heard of Murphy's law saying that if
something can go wrong it will it's easy to see the arrows on a ballots when
shown on TV and in the papers after they're leader put it out to them that's
why we have product testing with real consumers before the product was on the
general market medical procedures are changed would even well-trained
calls and doctors find ways to screw them up likewise airlines crash when
their well-trained crews are given new procedures that haven't been well
designed or thought out properly
hello
candle yes sir I'm not a free for history that's not all right we haven't
wait just one second we got a new Italian Bush's leaders now 35 of 67
county 799 oh good kidding closer excellent I don't know if all you're
listening to aware of it but Jeff who's been a business partner before to make
your developers that year for years and years and if I don't suppose something
wrong there I mean what just like just like the thing with the
citrus canker program well I don't want to get into that right now but I've
been giving they said this canker workers I see that's a good that's not
big about them well I recommend is somebody's big a close look at the
financial connection here between the Republican Party and you have business
contacts now here something just smells funny because I've got a neighbor that's
an election worker and she's saying also what the same story goes
it's really yesterday afternoon became a parent that's up you don't be a
wasn't winning like you showed up okay thanks pal what are you saying so now
they're talking about recounts in Wisconsin and Iowa and maybe even in New
Hampshire or Bush or one but with only 7200 votes out of more than half a
million and on and on of course see that they can drum up all kinds of
recounts which is fine I don't see any problem with that I mean like I said
whoever actually got the most votes should win but the fact is that
up until now we'll be hearing about any voter regularities in Wisconsin
no Iowa no New Hampshire no I'm not said isn't to say that there couldn't have
been any because this after all is America landed the free in the corrupt but
this seems kind of strange it seems like there it's a reach like well this in
case we better cover our ass just in case this Florida thing blows up in our
face we better start to get the machine we go in somewhere else here's
your side hello we'll ask your ass idiot 5 6 7 0 5 60
pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line here's Helen Dale hello
yeah I'm here I have a question to ask you the whole
Florida Florida Palm Beach County from the themselves if I wanted to
approach it like not know the president's on candidates there were other
things for me to fall down for the issues for you know for the train yeah no
really instructions just say you make a protest conference is not
five everything has it you follow that what do they have to pull up those
ballots with the other issues on those ballots that mean my purpose not counted
that is correct that may be the following this day well when the
house is ready to turn it I'm glad and you we counted them on these
okay come down take a milk count and just go over the corner there relax empty
the bag out not I mean he just a little bit to what just says I'm worried about
him he's right he's got a right to be exercise but just come down a little bit
man and of course you just have to wonder about those night you know you
say build also one by five points which made it suspicious that the grow might
lose the state you have to really believe now that bill also probably one
buyer significantly more than five points like at least a couple maybe two
three points more than that so let me say it again 35 of 57 counties have been
recounted now and the bush leaders windled another 142 votes it's down to 799
with still 32 counties to go now following the math on this they sing how close
this is because when he started he had 17 number 84 vote lead half of that
would be eight hundred and some not so he's lost a little more than half of the
vote with a little more than half of the counties and even though you know
some of the big counties already have been recounted like Dayton Howard and
Palm Beach but keep in mind I'm sure I don't know which traditional counties
we had here because if Penella County I doubt that that's in that total
right he was asked about the ballots that appear to have been punched twice he said
well you know the usual cases that you throw a ballot like that out it's invalid
and was in was in he was asked about confusing ballot he said well that's
something that election officials democratic and republican should have caught
earlier he did also say that we should remember that this is a leader process
rather than a political process he didn't go any further than that but one could
take that to mean that the bush campaign is going to make something of the
Gore campaign's decision to seize on every irregularities that has been found
down in the state of Florida. Jean I know it's logical to expect that we won't
hear from the governor until he's actually got something to say but we're all
fascinated to know how he spent when he went into the
now we're not at least bit fascinated know how he's spending the time if he's
twiddling his thumbs if he's got his finger up his rectum you idiots on CNN man
you make me sick we're all fascinated know if he's having a good ball movement if
he's got like wild diarrhea now people in the media and Tom Dick has got a good
column in a some central about the early projections and that it's got to stop
it has to come to an end nice going there Tommy boy amen the wild frenzy who
can be first who can come up with who can screw up the election the best and
would seem to me that no matter which side you are he liked the go or you are
bush that you ought to be really pissed off with the networks because he
caused they caused both candidates both we have somebody calling yesterday I
think from Margate wherever was was online and he and a friend were going to
vote for Gore and somebody among those little TVs there they were online the
lines as you saw were gigantic in a lot of places around the state and all
of a sudden the networks declared Gore wins for it and they instead of waiting on
those long lines they got in their car turned around and went home and then the
people up there in the panhandle which is more Republican territory they also
probably didn't buy the voting because the networks just evidently so many
must have forgot that they're on central time up there
in Pensacola and that you know not heavily populated area but never less than
election this close every vote's got a bit count and everybody has a right to
make the vote intelligently and not be swayed by early history and panic
are foimated by the media shame on them here's a lady mobile in Miami hello
yes ma'am yeah hi I've said I actually live in Western but I'm in Miami now in
the court okay I've spent two days on the telephone and as NBC uh-huh that left
better than how many times in the next year because I'm really not gonna go
friendly neighborhood where I am at but I myself did vote for Corvus this is not
a political issue I'm outweighs I have friends all over the country that have
been calling this yesterday California Pennsylvania New York that are telling
me you know what's it has been going on this down there but nobody seems to
understand that there are a good committee reports of a regularity of
nationally speaking and I think if we got the public
behind the people down there particularly the Palm Beach people which is
inevitable that obviously the count there is just completely incorrect not to
mention that I mean if you will hear we constantly are hearing about 20 30 40
different irregularities in several counties that's just one and it seems
every time they give us a report on the count of the vote already going on has
picked up over half of the margin right right right is it all going I mean this
can't be a coincidence no it's not all go I mean Bush is in fact Bush in
Broward County gained the net of one vote in Broward so he he yes no I understand
that it's just getting a few votes to every like two and three
three right right right the goal and it's going up to counties I mean they've
already counted 35 counties so the question is well more when you hear about
the irregularities for we should count these on beach counties valid South
being lost right here in Broward County nine o'clock at nine on alection night
they had an amount first yes they were local media people on our local
channel seven new saying that they're standing there be let whether they're
counting the balance and nine boxes will miss you for three and a half
hours I mean this is the city and the other people in this country with the
population has voted for more as it stands right now you know there's
questions that needs to be answered and just because the national media make
a statement that doesn't make it so yeah I was listening to that message and
and Chris Matthew says look if there's people confused in palm trees on the
ballot then why don't you ask for assistance well they would I heard a lot a lot
of people didn't know that they were confused they thought that they were doing
their right thing well not only that I heard on three different channels people
calling and so they were working at the election polls in Palm Beach County
yeah and they were volunteering to help and people were constantly asking about
that question and they said they didn't have enough people to assist
everybody that wanted to ask questions that's what I want things I heard and I
also one way the actually said that in heart where she was working they told
that she could not tell people to punch number the number of the board but
that was not around yeah okay so we'd our staff yourself and it's getting real tight
28 after 11 at 560 WQ up
but Neil Roger show sports radio 560s Q a
pan okay 1132 a Q and this is great block is brought in the Palm Beach Post big
big front page with a picture of Bush and Gore ballot bedlam is the headline
ongoing recon cuts Bush Lee from 1776 to 1782 I know where they got that
number but at any rate the current or off to the moment number is Bush's head by
799 votes with 32 counties still to do their recap they have no seven o'clock
tonight to do but I have a thing it's gonna be a lot sooner than that we'll see
if it continues going down and the number two if it continues dwindling and dwindling
and dwindling and you'll notice that the Bush people at no point have said
that they'll abide by whatever the findings are they make some kind of a
generalized the week statement the other day yesterday but they have a
week to say that they'll abide by whatever the final decisions are and now
that we got James Baker down here yeah now here is a rally that I'm gonna
promote got a fact that says a grassroots rally a schedule for 3 p.m. today at
the town center mall in Boca Raton the location will be in the parking lot
facing blades road in front of the restaurant Fridays and stir crazy it's
expected that there be TV coverage and possible appearances from Congress and
Wexler and or Jesse Jackson depending on their schedules the DMC in Washington
is reported positively the purpose is to demand a revote and that Bush can't
steal his election none of what has happened passes the smell test and his
suspect I think is what it means at the bottom so subject is suspect or like
yes he says if it don't fit it's foolishness so at 3 o'clock at the Boca Town
Center mall for people that are pissed off and fired up how's our pool coming
to the 50 votes should probably try to be given a another election 271 at 77.5%
said yes 79.2.5% said no no and that's where we stand and they keep counting
and counting and counting and you know I understand that there's little
sheds on the back there's little paper chairs in the back of the or tab
whatever you want to call them on the back of your ballot sometimes those things
if you don't punch all the way through they get stuck and if they want to
going back in flattening out then your ballot your vote doesn't get counted
that's what it will be a punch the whole and as you look at this Palm Beach
County thing again very clearly because they have the ballot on the front
front page it shows you the holes I mean this is a spirit a great picture the
first hole is the Bush hole the second hole which you'd assume would be the
grow hole is the Buchanan hole and since the guy called earlier is correct the
instructions the voter instructions that they sent out to everybody tell you
to punch the hole to the right also the right of the candidate on the second
page but most people wouldn't care about that because it's readily a parent
it's Buchanan and the socialist David and Garendel's and so I nobody nobody cares
about that for the most part so they're focusing in on where they're voting
you to Bush or go and leave them and I can easily see why tons of people like
the 19,000 people punch both holes there because technically the second
hole is almost opposite Gores name and a third hole's opposite leave them in
name and if they're telling you to vote but to punch the hole to the right of
the candidate you're voting for it's easier to see I mean how can you condemn
those people should maybe they're a little slow maybe they're stupid whatever
but there's nothing that says you have to be smart to vote that's for damn sure
if there's right now I'll allow you would have been kept home on Tuesday in those
instructions to the same thing about the arrows the right of the arrow by the
person it says look out for leapy leave so little arrows you call a book of
Brian he'll tell you about all those little parts here's a mobile and
north water deal hello hello me up yes sir I was born and raised in Toronto I've
been here for five years and a year ago I became a citizen yes sir how about
them kicked ass last night but anyway now there's more important than hockey
game right now right almost I guess this was the first opportunity for me to
vote for a chief executive officer the head of state of the United States right in
Canada we vote for like congressmen who then of that party the Thai
minister is the one who would need to speak to the House in that sense for me
right now I am so disappointed that more people aren't really upset across the
country why I'm sure I'm sure that they are that people in West Palm Beach have
been defiled of those their franchise and I'm so far yeah at this time of the
year being remembered state coming up in a few days the American revolution
was for the right to have that vote right I would be really pissed off of my
first vote went for a incorrect design on a ballot I think that they should have
a reach out not a reelection or revoke in in West Palm Beach County for only
those people who voted right not for everybody else right I think that can be done
and that's there sure it could easily be done because I've got all the ballots
and I've got the the of read the poll or list of names to people in their
signatures right people who signed in should be able to come back and do it right
and I hope it's done right and go and thank you so norm factors me the sample
ballot and the instructions that go along with it and the first to vote this is
in Palm Beach the vote use the punching instrument attached by chain to the
automatic punch straight down to the hole to the right of the arrow by the
candidate or issue of your choice do not use any other punching instrument is
that correct no no the ballot is improperly made the instructions are
improper but don't confuse people with the facts because if it came out you're
afraid then you're just going to suck along with it see it's one thing and I
can only speak for myself and I'm not trying to sound healthier than now but the
fact is that if we're exactly reversed if Bob Graham or still a governor and
who were being done for go this way and we're exactly reversed I wouldn't be
sitting here trying to steal the election because you've got and I'm pretty
damn partisan as I'm sure all of you know but you've got to be really just a
wing that you've got to be out of your mind to try to support the results of an
obviously flawed election and for holding for dog catcher okay big deal but
we're not this is 560 you weigh it on 17 before a noon of 560 W.F.
and the Palm Beach Post editorial asked in their headline could a ballot mistake
elect president asterisk Bush may win White House because of voter confused
no for names in the middle of it it says the confusing Palm Beach ballot
combined with a close vote in a flurry of lost and found ballot boxes put the
bush can't particularly the jet Bush wing on the defensive when Florida
Attorney General Bob Butterworth a Democrat who has missed a grower state
chairman in a possible calendar to governor Bush in 2002 made the obvious
point that both sides need to monitor the recount mandated by law Frank
him and Jeff Bush's deputy chief of staff charge irrationally Mr. Butterworth
was trying to hijack this process and play Robert the jet Bush appointee a
state election chief said we don't need the Attorney General to tell us how to
follow the law Mr. Robert however showed his own bias when he claimed
problems of the Palm Beach Post ballot had been exaggerated I don't think
they're confused he said I think they left the polling place and became confused
does anyone doubt that if the anomaly affected GOP votes that the Bush
can't be the first in line demanding a remedy anybody doubt that no no and my
good friend Howard climbers that have great column here 124 years to the day
Florida Pivotal Hilden Hayes Tilden race in 1876 Hinsdon and remote date
county it took them 26 days to decide that election between Rutherford B.
Hayes and Tilden
Samuel Tilden no Samuel Tilden right in either but at any rate according to
summer reports the New York Hill actually asked in print where the hell is
date because there was like nobody here did back then there were like five
people in date and there are a couple people in Monroe and six cows down there
whatever it was just a Yahoo place oh I'm sorry I mean was here's a mobile
import waterdale hello yeah yes sir yeah I've got a few things I want to get
up my show right ahead number one in regards to the woman who said that the
poll assistant poll workers are disallowed by law barred by law from
assisting voters okay they could not advise them on food of vote for they can
advise them on instructions right period okay even top you can and today
suggest that Gore won Florida he said that those people that you were honestly
voted for him those people vote his votes should not have counted
I'm not a state com today okay to stay calm okay secondly right before the
election the Republican said that it's Howard has a 200,000 that a
Brown has a 200,000 voted damage gold would win well Broward had a 209,000
voted damage let's see what else what else in addition to the black
voter in intimidation and the and the unbelievable 19,000 Palm Beach votes that
are just disallowed you mentioned about how the the poll has to be to the right
of the name okay not to the way not to the left to the right also that of
Knox's Delray Beach caller that right wing of apology yesterday with that
talking about his his crap about the overseas votes yeah he just makes up the
numbers as he goes along it's not 30,000 okay it's two or three thousand we know
that I said that's the beginning of the show and and many of them have already
been counted and many of them are from Israel right okay yeah but you have to watch
out because there's been a lot of Jews won't for be canedly also it's very very
suspicious that all right I'm in bushes up to 830 now they counted three more
of our counties 38 to 67 counties it's 830 votes okay it's very very suspicious
that Bill Nelson would get 51% right howdy duty would get 46 right really
Logan would get 1% with equal 80,000 and somehow all those people that voted
for Bill Nelson suddenly changed their vote to to Bush a whole bunch of me
if you believe that and which really really suspect are these absentee ballots
okay why not why was Bush so confident you know the exit polling showed that
girl was winning he had a three to three time I mean I've been to all of that we're
just rehashing that I know he had a three to six point and why was he so
confident I remember 19 that everyone took their head at waiting in the wing exactly
if you remember 1997 former mayor X mayor Xavier Suarez election was
notified because of absentee ballots voter fraud dead people exactly
people like to vote down he was he was removed Corolla was it was was was put
in place and so it is all things smells and I hope they declare this
election I hope they declare a revote in Florida I mean in Palm Beach County
if they don't it's a crew it's an absolute okay take two and I'll call us again
from day the Bush campaign waits in aggressive campaign to gather absentee
ballots in Miami's little Havana and other Republican strongholds at the
hallway headquarters of the Bush campaign a crew of about a dozen people
work together ballots filling out and mailing ballot requests for voters
calling them to make sure they voted even stamping and mailing the balance
after they were dropped off at the campaign office
Miami commissioner Joe Sanchez who supervised the Corolla office it is
crew helpful in about five thousand absentee votes and they were mostly saying
of course which is okay assuming of course that they were all people who
were legitimate voters they were all like a lie that that generally is a
I mean even Melcona handy maybe one of the election in Missouri maybe but he
couldn't have voted because he didn't lie here's Stuart hello hey Neil you know
back back to just the Belisha County for just a second yeah what a story up
there the socialist candidate got nineteen thousand votes nationwide he got
ten thousand in Belisha yeah that's where the switch was made that's when the
fix went in uh-huh ten thousand votes from Gore disappeared and all the
sudden showed up for the socialist candidate now on the sample ballot in Palm
Beach County the approval process was invalid like that's like ten thousand
of both difference there to me there you have it there's the approval process was
invalid because both major parties approved the sample ballot not as it was in
the booth the holes were not on the ballot they approved the holes from this
line it's both part you know something that's an excellent point that's a very
good point the holes weren't in there it was just like the one that was a
fact to me the other day and when you see without the holes you really don't see
any confusion all you see is the arrow right and both the Democrats and the
Republicans would have said no way this ballot is totally with the
missile on the holes there's no way they would have approved it there's nothing
worse than this align holes man you got it I'm an attorney and I have done a
couple of recount of content contesting of elections in Palm Beach County
right and I will tell you it's the way it used to be when Jackie Winchester was
supervisor of elections we go by ballot by ballot and you didn't even have to
punch it all the way through we would fight over whether the whether the little
square had been dented and they ballot by ballot they would say okay that
one counts or that one doesn't so it's the election over again in Palm Beach
County give us the 10,000 votes back in Belucia and then let's see what happened
and I have some advice for a Theresa LaPore don't buy a house thank you let's have a
reelection for her too okay thank yeah 417 votes on our poll on new
Rogers dot com should Palm Beach County be given another election yes 324 no 93
77.5% to 22.2% well there's James Baker who looks about 110 years old now a lot
of the issues surrounding this recount process it's I know the position
secretary state it's certainly the position of Governor George W. Bush that we
would like to see this process carried out in a very transparent open deliberate
yeah you're right and seriously as possible of course no national but in
keeping fully in keeping with the requirements of the law Florida we feel quite
confident that that's the way the process has been conducted so far and we're
hopeful of course if that's the way it's going to be concluded sometime during
the course of the day now I'll take a few questions but I can't be a true
point to consider Governor Boyce felt it in a lot what point will that come well
you're you're jumping the gun here because we have to first was lead the recount
and then and then we have to and and and and completing a recount may very well
depend upon what happens with respect to overseas ballots it depends upon
where the parties where the two candidates stand at the
answer you really can't answer that question
well we don't know that we do not know we do not know we do not know at this
hour this afternoon whether it will require waiting from November 17 or not
this is a court of Florida law we're dealing with the law Florida here and we're
going to respect it and operate accordingly as as a quite confident are the
officials of the state of Florida and the Gore campaign okay Jimmy there's
old James Baker good old Bush Reagan Croney 5 6 7 0 5 60
pound 5 60 and you know something they really pissed me all there they go now
that's they don't have it there how about the MSNBC one moment please now both of
them they take that thing away we know it's James Baker okay we know what he's
talking about even with a sound down I know what he's talking about anybody
with the Ikea bigger than their toenail knows who that is we want to make sure
that we don't miss that thing and also how can they're not showing us which
counties are sounding in here with the recount because I sure like to know if
Penelope is in if Illusion is in which I think is highly suspect at that best and
Orange County here's a bubble in Western hello hello yes sir got a very simple
solution to getting rid of the electoral college okay it'll never ask because
they're republican know the Democrats will win the election every time you make
it popular vote all eight you get rid of the electoral college you first make
it a natural holiday because here we have a lot for Columbus Day which is the
daughter's holiday right right from this came here in slaughtered Indian right so
everybody gets off at the same time the polls in the East Coast are open from 9 a.m. to
9 p.m. on the west coast of from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. there's no predictions ahead of time
there's no counting until all the polls close nice and easy and how about getting rid
of these paper ballots get rid of this arcade transporting paper ballots in bags
and in boxes since we have all this unbelievable technology now what's
while we're doing it computerized where they have a central computer of
bank where all the numbers are funneled to there and all of our other computers
so there's no way to dick or my word ballots and screw my word with the result and
you can have it instantaneously as soon as the poll the last vote is at
tallies you have your press the button there's the number and you got what you got
you have it 30 seconds after the poll close absolutely correct but it will never
happen because the republican's now they'll lose every time well I'm gonna let you
say that because the final popular vote missing is less than a hundred thousand
votes now I mean go ahead yeah but don't forget okay that's yet in half it's got
a pass like three quarters of the state right that's right the guy who's got
Wyoming will never approve it two thirds I think two thirds okay God bless it
well yeah you're right although why would that be then because it would seem to
be that's back as the people in Wyoming their vote is worth almost nothing
now they got three electoral votes and that would make their votes as
desirable somebody in New York in addition to which the people in my
only then might actually have somebody besides the vice president dick who
happens to be from there coming and speaking them and the people in Vermont are
little states too as opposed now that most of the the overwhelming majority of
the campaign is done in the big states because that's where the candidates want
to get the big chunks of electoral votes so we'll put everybody on the
equal footing makes all the sense in the world just say no to the local college
830 that's worth 38 out of 67 counties bush leads by 830 votes right now
this second this is 560 Q.A.F.
Portrait you 560 WQA M Miami Fort Lauderdale a
Beasley Broadcast Group states have WQAM dot com for the world if
exactly 12 loon in 560 WQM they got to hang come up into this afternoon
both shot about no brute for a hanker to we got B.O. Cook with Boogie 5 her
cool hotline from Raymond Honda 6 all God you're gonna believe we got it
they're going to get in a new total but then if you threaten number yesterday
said afternoon he didn't say which day now looking again at the wording and you
know something now starting to sink in very clearly because not only the
instructions mitigate against the candidate candidate to were on that right
hand page in Palm Beach any president of candidates because there were no
holes to the right of those names but also when you read the instruction then
you look at the ballot again which is very clearly there's a really good
picture on the front page of the Palm Beach post and it's a vote use the
punching instrument attached by chain to the voter matts punched right down
through the hole to the right of the year by the candidate or issue of your
choice and you look and you see that even though there is an arrow with number
five which again that really technically is the wrong number it should be
number four but those those depending on the align into the ballot and in the
machine however far down your second they could have appeared to those 19,000
people who had their ballots thrown out that those holes are to the right of
the goalie remains names because they're all within that box within that space
to the right of that space and even though it does say singular here very easy
mistake that people could have made thinking that they had a punch both names in
or why don't ask me I have no idea
here's a call in Miami hello you there yes sir I just want to make a comment on
the people in Palm Beach County there are a bunch of senior citizens that are
claiming they were confused and they don't understand the ballot but this was
the same ballot that was published in the paper after just the election without
the holes that we didn't show the alignment of the whole you know there's no
excuse for stupidity or ignorance that you know this ballot was reviewed and signed
off by Mr. Lexler have any have you actually seen the ballot with the holes in it
yes and you don't think it's confusing what about the other thousands of Palm Beach
voters were they confused you know something we've heard from many people who
said that they they're pretty sure they voted right but they were confused and
I look at it for a couple of minutes because it was confusing to them not all
old people well that you're talking about in an addition to which when they
point out to you the people who vote the most in Florida are the senior citizens
so I'm sure that this wasn't the first time that they voted in their lifetime
I understand that what what was the first time was that they were confronted with
a so-called butterfly ballot which was confusing to anybody and in the
instructions which I just read you again which somehow you're ignoring I'm sure
you heard it the instructions are incorrect well listen you there's a big
influence from Palm Beach County by the Kennedy family oh get out of here you
crazy person or what big influence it get this man out of some help get him a
straight jacket big influence in Palm Beach if that's the case then how come
they didn't have 50 billion votes how come they didn't have a bunch of bad
wind by a zillion votes so we wouldn't have to have maybe a recount you idiot
God talk about a paranoid I can't even deal with him I'm getting a headache from
him good God call up Lordass okay I'm sure that he'll love that
conspiracy the Kennedy's done it right head yeah five six seven oh five
sixty Palm five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line 38 out of 67
counties the recount continues all afternoon bush leads by 830 about half
of what a little less than half of what he originally had here's a mobile in
Palm Beach hello Neil thank you for cycling for a minute while I stopped laughing
hysterically oh my I'm a 41 year old white male in Palm Beach County yes okay I'm
registered I was registered in the pendant okay when I went to the polls my
wife they would not let her vote because she had not changed her driver's
license to our new address okay but they did let me vote because I was registered
independent and guess what my wife was registered
Democrat absolutely and she went to two point places once at the old house I
drove over there while waiting to go late make my son late for a hockey game
drove her way to the old polling place for 45 minutes what she went in there
and it wouldn't tell her she take her name and number and call her she could
figure out if it was okay for oh yeah listen listen and let me tell you the
whether this guy wasn't just hung up sounds like a paranoid really all from my
end right this time because of it you take a nixon that's polling question for
Palm Beach County only and ask them how many people are enamored with the
Kennedy's in Palm Beach County and watch that number be less than one
you people who do know from the five I look how I would I wouldn't dignify this guy
with a response I mean the dumbest things and that covers a lot of territory one
of the dumbest things I've heard that's their running that's what they're running
out of ammo the last you both think I love huh huh huh huh they like that Kennedy
amazing you know take care good luck out good luck to us five six seven oh five
sixty pound five sixty on the 18 T and Verizon wireless line out of town line
eight seven seven seven eight five sixty three forty five
I'd encourage you and we all encourage people to go to polls and vote and
90,000 people one time they must have a poll to vote and they've also been
thrown out that now we just uh been told the William Bailey and Warren Christopher
who's also a growth surrogate in Florida plant have a new conference in about
an hour from now to give their latest version of what's going on give
them their insoritor for our goal I'm sorry for George W. Bush who's had a
new conference this seems pretty confident that if the key starts punched the wrong
button on that dollar and Tommy's telling them you just have to throw it out that's
the way we've always been to be said and that was that campaign expect hey to
break the news just we'd hope that the instructions are invalid the
instructions are wrong punch the hole to the right of the era by the candidate
a issue of your choice and there were several candidates on the right hand
page and there was no arrow to the point of the right and no hole to the right
but don't confuse the people in Palm Beach I mean we're talking rocket science
up there in Palm Beach County Teresa brilliant genius here's Kendall hello
Kendall going once here's a lady in Hollywood hello
Ramoblan sunrise somewhere I don't know where I am here's a mobile sunrise yeah
I got I just I wanted to ask you questions like I'm so glad that the
Democrats are so concerned with the Democratic process the 67 counties of Florida
how many did Bush win well what is that what's in the Zebra 51 counties and
with which counties there's a Democrats why I've revoked it probably count the
one that's the highest concentration of you as well as I know I forgot it's a
ten-kinda the energy you can see that's it I forgot about that the
juicy conspiracy who and who on the most states wish one by far the most
states that we like to present it on that we like to govern based on who
wins the most county low I love the way you know it's pathetic I'm not
in an already public until like a bunch of little children but certainly
something to think about like a little bunch of infants don't confuse this
with the rules or the way the elections work like we got to call me yesterday
about all we've got 50 the electoral college is great because we have 51
different elections I said to them does that mean that we are both for governor
that we have 67 different elections is we have 57 counties and he said yeah yeah
God so if the Jews and it's the Kennedies are the Kennedies Jewish I
refuse eight minutes after we're in the five sixty WQM the Neil Roger show
sports radio five sixty you so Joel has already just said the formal office
of the place that I sound nasal I'll tell you what tell you what I'll do I'll do
anyway we have nothing new to report as far as the tallies concerned bushes
still ahead by 130 votes nobody has any idea how many of those overseas
ballots are coming in they've got to November 17 they've got eight more days
to get them all in that's the law that's the deadline because I pointed out
before a lot of those were some I'm not going to say a lot some of them
already came in and were counted on election night so nobody knows nothing and
the business about the way that the absentee ballots are handled in this
state is mind boggling to me because how can there not be a tallies somewhere
somehow how can as the election is going on the supervisor of the of election
saying well if it could be not just a half a minute it could be like almost a
million absentee ballots well how is it not possible to know how many have been
distributed who knows here's Fort Waterdale hello
hey no how you doing okay hey like the guy said by before ignorance is no
defense you have the opportunity to pull your ballot out find out what number
you punched yeah match it up with your ballot okay walk over to the lady or
man tell her you made a mistake they're not going to be a ballot you're missing
the point that most of those people didn't know they made a mistake well then how
do they know they did make a mistake if they don't know well certainly the
candidate voters in the state even he himself
scream if somebody else power came out interested in you screaming at me over
the phone hey hey yeah don't confuse anybody discover the facts you know you don't
like what's going on now because you want to resort see I hate to break the
news here but the American public people are good conscience of any party people
are good conscience aren't going to let either candidate see all the election in
broad daylight and isn't it interesting that black and Jewish votes I mean maybe
that's just a coincidence they seem to be the ones that are being stolen and
big numbers they're the attempt going on here in the state of Florida whether
it's for Lucia County whether it's Palm Beach County and guess what there aren't
too many Jews in the Lucia County and the Kennedy's don't live there either so
come up with all the conspiracy stuff you're like a bunch of little children like
I said before if you don't get your way and it looks like you probably will get
your way but if you don't get it easily if we just don't hand over the keys to
the kingdom and say here you go you're wine like a bunch of little kids and also
don't confuse you with the facts like the fact that it appears very and and
judges legal legal experts are going to have to make the decisions on this the
courts will have to decide one of these ballots were legal whether they were
misleading and again if you have even the slightest degree of fairness because
your candidate is the guy who said oh we want to bring back decency and
morality back to Washington yadi yadi so if you really have any degree of fairness
any any slight spirit that in any fiber in your body then you'd agree that
everybody out there who was registered had a legitimate right to vote now if
they were stupid if that was it just stupidity then I say you're right you think
there were 20,000 people really that stupid that they they punched both holes in
there and if you look at the ballot it's easy to see why if you look at the
ballot with the instructions it's very easy to see why there are a few people
maybe a few old the old yantas they can be stupid or they can be seen out or
they can have bad eyesight but to try to tell us not the 23,000 people were
stupid because they're both a position franchise and it didn't go the way that
you like pretty obvious pretty transparent the quote James Baker it's
transparent let's see what he's saying around we began the day at 941
both lead then it went all the way down to 790 now we're crossing that out now
it's an 830 lead we can tell you that 38 of the 67 counties have been
counted so far we are expecting a five o'clock deadline today by the time all
of the recounting is done however we prepared to go much longer than that
want to read to you the latest news we've received the NBC is reporting how would
the overseas ballots be announced because there are great many of them more than
a thousand according to the power to the head of the elections division in
the state more than a thousand the ballots have to be received through the
10-day window no I know that postmarked military from the date of the
announcement they the state will not certify the count from the overseas
ballots until that 10-day window for receiving them has expired however he
does add that each and every county on its own in deciding what they want to do
on this issue some counties may announce the count of the overseas ballots when
they receive them on an on going basis in other words we might be getting those
overseas absentee ballots and an updated count day by day who knows may be even
hour by hour okay great so just put yourself up on the edge of the seat don't
fall in your hands that's my suggestion here's a lady in Hollywood hello hello
yes ma'am I found out my ballot card was different from most people and I found
that by listening in Hollywood and Hollywood yeah how's that possible I
was present because it was so confusing of taking Bush and Gore and Buchanan
and and I found out because my husband has been in the business right beside me
and his card would be like anybody else's with a pencil is straight across some
bush and then straight across some door mine was not like that I was listening to
you show on the way back Tuesday from voting right and the lady that called you
and said she thought she voted for Buchanan but she was in Palm Beach she was in Palm
Beach yeah well mine had little holes right in the middle all crammed together they
was not across from the president and if you went straight across some
doors name yeah in the first hole there was no errors no numbers on the
controls well then why didn't you go and ask for another ballot they wouldn't
I had no idea and so I started hearing people call your show and saying the card was
confusing I was saying I was confusing in Palm Beach they used a completely
different balance for the presidential election I was present since Tuesday and
Wednesday that it was confusing I can't believe they don't have it on TV yeah and
to find out my husband explained to you said draw me a picture of it that drew
him a picture he said that's not what my card was he said the controls were
separated straight across from the president and when I heard people on your
show saying it was confusing I think you they had the same card that I had that
there's spread around because it I your first reaction was you first straight
across and he pushed the first one it would have been good and then you and there
has a big number three by go is name and as a well it's the third button you have
to count down okay I understand you're a paranoia in your psychosis but
nothing I can do about it now I mean I understand people are very
upset they want to make sure their vote was counted that it was right but CNN
just says that Florida law states that the holes on a ballot must be on the right
maybe that's why they put you can't over there on the right like a far right
let me say that again CNN just announced Florida law states the holes on a
ballot must be on the right while the holes on the ballot for the presidential
election on the right no in Palm Beach County no no absolutely not so it's
looking really darker and darker for the forces of darkness I can tell you that
right now because it looks more and more like these were unacceptable ballots
that were in violation of Florida law in many respects here's Bokeh hello
yes sir high Neil couple re a couple comments one is when I've ever heard the
Republican in my stairs talk about the absentee ballots the obviously ballots
especially the military in a very cocky manner they say well they in a
path they've pretty much gone to the Republicans because of the military right
but unless I have missed something every time I see pictures of our military
there's a lot of Afro-Americans who are part of our military yeah so I'm not
really sure where they tend to be more Republican however I'd like to point
out that there were 2300 overseas ballots in 96 that actually came in almost half
of them went to Clinton in addition to which there are some quotes from
people over who were overseas when they mailed their ballots right back now
somewhere Jewish there are many people overseas in Israel there this isn't just
military they keep trying to make it sound because you know they figure if they
talk it up they're gonna convince you into it like it's all the military
there these two or three thousand votes whatever they were over there and they're
not and they just got to say they're about a thousand left and aren't in but
there are a wide variety of people their tourists who are traveling abroad
or by trip schedule during the election and military people and all kinds of
people the other thing the other is the margin in that vote it isn't likely to be
all that great and although you know even a couple hundred will make a
difference now but it's not likely to be that great the other thing is people are
criticizing the voters in Palm Beach County being senior citizens and having a
you know problem with their minds and with their ability to see properly on the
today show Teddy Kirk interviewed a whole bunch of young and middle aged people
very some of them very well educated very bright and many of them on the show
this morning stated they had the same problem here and the same difficulty so
for people to put the onus on the senior citizens this is gone across the
ages in terms of well you know something I just like something like a light bulb
just lit up over my head I'm looking at this ballot on the front because they've
got a full color picture and I bet it's black and white but still it's a color
picture of the ballot and the holes in the bottom front of the Palm Beach post
and you can see just by looking at it that this is an illegal ballot because
you can't enforce it for example before I'm party there listed as number four
there on the top of the right page the arrow is playing to the left and the
hole is directly to the left that's in violation of the law float a law
say it again and this was just reported by CNN says that the holds have to be
to the right of the names on the Florida ballot one other thing real quick you
may have said it already so excuse me if I'm repeating it you can and was
interviewed this morning and he stated on I think on the today show right he
stated that he does feel that the vote that went to that went to him yeah should
really have gone to go and so of all people he acknowledged it was not fair
that's right thank you okay thanks so I guess the worst people will be lucky again
huh haha oh 24 past noon at 560 WDQAM no changes
okay on these almonds that Peter Leonard brought in here he always brings me
something to gag on if he's a crap that Peter Leonard gag on this Peter here's
Naples so on yeah is there a man what is it you can form the floor to
statue the ball the whole has to be on the right hand side of the candidate's
name yes then what are they going to do with the Spanish pages on the right side
with all the arrows going to the left beats me well that makes it that means all
the other counties got throughout all the ballots yeah well let's just do the
whole thing all over again well I'd like to meet explain that because the in the
Hispanic ballot the you know almost every other county there's a Hispanic
balance on the right hand side of the page of the year was going to let
Bobby Dan check it out sounds to me like Florida don't know how to do an election
I guess but if they if they're going to go by a streak a strict legal
definition according to Florida statue then none of the ballots are valid okay
thank you thanks what's he trying to say yeah five six seven oh five
six the and how come we got ballots in the some other language I know a lot of
people are going to be asking the question is there any reason why we should have
ballots in some other language no of course not here's what it says that voted
in Palm Beach crack and have any difficulty out of your in there's another
once is we're all they're putting in on MSNBC and the Democrats are saying one
thing that you'd expect the Republicans are saying the opposite that you'd expect
and you see a lot of people did leave there without any idea on suspecting that
maybe they points the wrong thing the obviously answer was that's a tally
for the cannon showed that problem forget about the nineteen thousand that
they threw out that's another issue but the 3,400 votes of which at least
three thousand more bogus in Palm Beach at least most of those people weren't
even aware what they had done and we remember that Tuesday on election day that
one woman from Palm Beach County calling I'm sure if you were listening you
remember she was hysterical and she you know I got frustrated because I couldn't
relate to what she was talking about because unless you see the ballot where
the holes are and unless you live in Palm Beach and you voted not kind of a
butterfly ballot you can't you can't envision it but she was apple
practice and rightfully so and I'll say it again you don't have that time when
there that many people lined up and that then that few campaign many
appreasing workers most of them are over the age of a hundred sitting around
there was one campaign guy in Brown yesterday we're talking about the fact that
they told us to call headquarters election headquarters and if anybody had a
problem we couldn't find them and they kept calling all day long and getting
busy signal and could never get through to find out if these people had a
way to vote or not 26 past noon at 560 WDQM
but you're there are days all right okay let's do I'm cut I did 795 is the new
kind of just got cut by another but that's with how many now 40 45 though 45
out of 67 795 22 counties to go do we know what counties they are no let's see
what let's see what the Bozo Assainer and MSNBC West Palm Beach County that
rallying held outside the Palm Beach County courthouse and DC Suzanne Melville
joins us there live Suzanne right we are expecting Reverend Jesse Jackson to
arrive momentarily but I don't know if this is ground zero this is the epicenter
of this ballot controversy that has really gripped our country for about
48 hours and people here are angry there are hundreds of protesters that are
outside of the governmental building here at Palm Beach County and they want to
make a phone that they do not believe that they're both count they don't believe
it really reflects their choice first of all 19 pounds about double counts
as you mentioned and they feel that because your votes were as well out that they
are different land triad truth you know you realize this that just for
getting about anything else assuming that this recount stays about the same
the next 22 counties and Bush wins by a few hundred votes forget about the
19 thousand who punched two you know whose ballots were tossed out forget about
the overseas ballots because there are less than a thousand so it will be counted
if you just take the 3000 grow votes that went to be cannon game over and then
of course you also have the 19 thousand and some odd whose ballots were tossed
down because of the same confusing illegal ballots in Palm Beach County
with incorrect instructions here's a mobile in pop and oh hello yeah the
networks call war about nine o'clock and obviously they were right because of
the exit polls I think about 10 to later was 10 to 8 well anyway five minutes
later the whole Bush clan which is seeing the whole panel half their bags go back
to the government mansion where they know the phone lines on tap and then
yesterday at the press conference they asked Jeb well what do you do when they
call Florida going down on them
and that's all I got to say me a joke thanks do you believe Jeb no no we don't
believe it for two seconds sweetheart five six seven oh five sixty pound five
sixty what they got some crowd up there outside the courthouse in Palm Beach
they are forming at the mouth out Palm Beach County revoked that's what
they're saying we vote revoked they're screaming and they're waving it
organization that felt that they wanted to get this message out and self
of the cloud that is the perfect jacket would help them and we are expecting
that he'll be here but really a lot of the scientists is 19 thousand MIAs
let me find out the museum for that rally of three glass roots rally scheduled
for 3 pm at the town center mall in Boca today and a parking lot facing the
Glage Road in front of the restaurant Fridays and stir crazy it's expected
there'll be TV coverage possible appearances from Congress and Robert
Waxler and or Jesse Jackson depending on our schedule the DNC in Washington
has responded positively it says demanding a revoked in Palm Beach
here's Miami hello yes I just want to make a few points there was a
gentleman called that person is like he was about to have a heart attack yes about
the fact that people voted for Bush and then there were votes for Nelson I'm
a ticket splitter and although I voted for Bush because I thought he would be
better nationally I thought that Nelson would better serve the interest of
Floridians so you know for people to imply something fishy is going on there I
know from my own personal experience you know I voted for Graham that I've
also voted for Jeb Bush oh god well I know but I mean you know at least I don't
go straight down the line like a mindless automaton just I understand that
it just it seems strange there I mean a 5% different seems like a pretty
significant amount we know the other point I wanted to bring up was although I do
think that some people voted for Buchanan that meant to vote for Gore yes if
there was that misleading considering over 200 and some thousand people voted
for Gore you would think that a much larger proportion let's say 50 or a
hundred thousand but you're narrowing it down to the 3,000 she actually there were
23,000 who voted for Buchanan but 19,000 them also voted for Gore in other
words they punch both of those buttons both of those holes to the right of
Gore's name so what they were doing is voting for Gore and Buchanan
unwittingly well I'm not a spoken and I don't mean to interrupt you but if I'm not
mistaken they haven't determined that those 19,000 that had two punch all would
Buchanan and Gore some of them may very well have been a whatever they were I
agree with it but they punched two holes oh understand I'm saying that I'm
an out of an advantage vote for Gore huh I said you can't say well that's why
there needs to be a revolt I'm not saying we ought to assume it and just say okay
here we're gonna hand in those votes of course not those people have a right to
have their vote counted although it was a heavily black hero is a lot of them
well the last point I'd like to make is that on the issue of a we vote although I
don't see where the Bush had win if he didn't legitimately get the vote right
they never know however my fear as somebody who voted for Bush would be that the
neither voters who by and large are more liberal they would be able to come back
and go ahead and punch for Gore as opposed to their original votes for
later yeah so another word so they did back on yeah he's a lot of the
baller right with Monica more head and whatever but they now know that their
native vote over they should know it from the very beginning yeah no chance of
winning right but they now can affect the election whereas before they
probably didn't even consider their vote valid other than a protest vote against
the two major parties well by the same token all those thousands of people
who supposedly voted for Buchanan over three thousand of them if they really
wanted to vote for Buchanan they can vote for now in the you know or they can
vote for Bush that's a good point if they're going to vote Jim I say let's find
out what people really meant to vote and not not decide a presidential election
based on the confusion in the technicalities I agree and it's a shame that it's
come down but of course that's Florida that's the ineptitude in the state we
can't do anything right here well let's just go for the best okay thanks for
45 out of 67 counties do we know which ones they are I mean I can't listen to the
audio all the while but it doesn't obviously not because they're just not
announcing it which is really stupid because if a loser county just as one
example is still out there or Pinellas County and I'm gonna say what that deal
isn't Pinellas that sounds really strange to me you miss that they were
recounting a late yesterday and they first turned over the result saying that
the go ahead picked up about 500 and Bush had lost 40 he had 40 fewer than
originally thought then they said oh wait a minute we found some other
ballots that we didn't count so we won't give you the number till tomorrow when
goddling knows me even he has his doubts yeah it has no idea here's a call from
Miami hello hello yes sir how are you doing yeah okay okay those meetings are
the points that uh yeah that you're on again yeah 21 before 1 at 560 WQA
the Neil Roger show sports radio 560 QA and the where of exploding
ball 17 to 1 a QM this is a great in Marines out to column this is sensational
she says all these psychograms boiled over on election night bill watching in
a suite at the height as he waited to go downstairs with Hillary was furious all
over again at Al for not deploying him better and bragging on the record more
Alan Nashville was just as mad as Bill because exit polls confirmed that the
president was a big drag on the Democratic ticket Hillary was so at bill for
summaries no all reasons and may no attempt to hide her chilling this on Tuesday
which must have made Bill so at her giving all the great advice that he gave her
that helped her at last get along perch of her own the Bushes were so driven by
Clinton poisoning they had poured jab under incredible pressure to deliver but
Mr. Grohl called the governor at 3 30 this morning to retract the guest
concession W. said he knew one the election because Jeb told them so let me
explain something this is more absolutely like the lecture W your younger
brother is not the ultimate authority on this so like you had heard but of
course we didn't know the details the second call not the ones from course
saying I'm going to conceive the later one saying guess what I changed my mind
was an unpleasant exchange and there's W and that kinder general compassionate
George W saying I know I won because my little brother told me so and he knows
because he knows where the bodies are buried and what the dead people are who
voted were all his absentee ballots came from and yada yada yada
here's a mobile and pepper time hello and yet yes sir number one thank you for
being a shot with sherry in this banana republic shopper than OJ baby thank you
and also is there any phone number or email address that we can call or write
the Democratic National Committee not to concede until everything is gone through
the court that you have to worry about that they're not going to do that no no
no have no fear all right well then we'll have to count right this time
more in Christopher's down here with the three eagle eyes yeah I hope he stays away
okay okay see it Pokemon ribs 45 now they're going to tell us which counties
they are because if so enjoy stability bush winds now that you know without
getting the nation's popular about the outcome could fuel new calls to outright
abolish the electoral college yeah we agree okay
these guys they just they slay me like a bunch of little children but it's like
not much your name on ding dong school if I was in in Francis Horwich ding dong school
of course you were talking a little kid but these people they talked about maybe
that's what a public acts like little kid because the media deals with them
like their little kids 5670560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line
here's a lady mover in Miami hello I knew yes man you're God I love you thank you I'm
trying to say unlike the last woman I'm so pleased I know that I'm not paranoid I voted
at 619 which is on Suncut Drive east of US one and I had the butterfly ballad and I knew
that mine was different because my boyfriend voted within a half an hour of
thought when I voted he voted in coconut grove so I was on incorporated date he
would study at Miami and I was discussing how about it's different and so it wasn't
only West Palm Beach and I haven't heard anyone else talking about that and which concerns me but
I know that I'm not crazy I just wanted to let you know okay I think maybe the whole state needs
to be voted um definitely West Palm Beach deserve it thank you all right thanks we got
bye bye that's our poor question that they should probably try to be given another chance
another election 543 votes already 419 yet 77.1% no 124 22.8% say absolutely not we won we got it
and the quit whining quit with a sour grapes now this is interesting in the Palm Beach post
when they're talking about the recount in Palm Beach County last night
it's as part of what's increased came from precinct 29e which came up empty on Tuesday
but showed 358 gore votes and 23 bush votes on Wednesday the precinct is near the
Fountain Community of jog and Lake Worth roads they were also before it was the state division of
election you hear that it came up empty there were no votes allegedly at all there on the election
night but then on Wednesday go ahead 368 and bush 23 how convenient just like those votes in
Valencia County just like those 10,000 votes for that what was his name again the guy that nobody
or yeah I don't know fuse Howard Hughes whatever the hell his name was Chatsky County Pingle yeah
look at that now they're showing the 1824 we don't care about 1824 okay we want to see some numbers
now we want them now we want to know what the hell is going on or else you crazy bastards in
the media here's plantation hello yeah I was just wondering if Al Gore wins the recount do you
still do you still want to have a new vote mean what if Al Gore wins this recount why not and
Palm Beach and then why not of course so we should sell why just in Palm Beach because that's
where the dispute is in Palm Beach well how do you have to go there hasn't been people across the
state that we also have problems because the ballot in Palm Beach was the only butterfly and if
you look in your in your pants maybe you'll find a butterfly so you're flying around okay grab it
real quick before it gets away get you a little net you should play butterfly kisses yeah I was
thinking about that funny you mentioned I was thinking of playing that the butterfly ballot I've
heard a butterfly in a stake but not a butterfly ballot because butterfly and then you hear something
that's why they didn't Palm Beach because the people in Palm Beach like it because it's free
butterflies are free anything in place free I don't want to start attacking the old Jews in Palm Beach
I don't suspect it's absolutely necessary oh and now look at this what the hell was that
got a bunch of crazy people are police a protest there we'll keep an eye on it yeah we got
some Bush changing people more grotesque juries shit I'm going to hand sidebabies oh like I said
these are the public and just slay me and we still with fair and square and you're not going to
get those votes okay no matter what that you do we still with fair and square man like I said I
hit it I hit my phone right out like a bunch of little children like a food fight in the cafeteria
in junior high school here's plantation hello yes sir I just wanted to call and say about
coming about the guys that said about the Spanish ballot yeah what it showed earlier on
an MSNBC they had the supervisor of elections from up in Tampa yeah and she shows because they have
that Spanish ballot also on the right side or on left side and side in English and directly across
is in Spanish or you know if it's Bush it's in English on North and Spanish on the right yeah and only
one punch hole but it can't be any confusion on you know that type of guy right that's still
technically not legal but at least it's not confused well they did or did I guess for the Spanish
speaking you know coming that we're heavily with the Spanish ballot yeah I guess that's an awful
lot of hopes in big county we're just gonna have to throw out huh yeah but then in the other
county you know that they did that I think I think all he is I mean I realized that hispanics
are on the rest of the state but in big county we realized that there was that question about
the F.C.P. ballot so I think that the fair way to decide that is to take all the Spanish votes in
big county and when and doctor so mouth yeah let's have an ethnic food fight we got the blacks and
the Cubans and of course the old Jews you know something this when it come right down to it this is
like a mirror of the state of Florida it's like a microcosm of our entire lives here in this
country for second state the old Jews the blacks the Cubans who were leaving out who didn't get into
this well the crackers or the crowd the crackers there you know they're running them out of their
signs there more dirty tricks they're busy that back with their sheep today their sheep was
lonely on election day Tuesday they got to be back and keep in company they okay don't worry about
the crackers here's a call from Palm Beach hello hello yeah yes sir
hi this is a colonial religion and we have income see that's fine
the court yes sir listen to what are they anyhow I voted for Bush the ballot I
I didn't have any problem however I can see you work a lot of people might have been mistaken
I agree I think we should have another election in Palm Beach County right but by the same talking
kneel I don't think there's that many Republicans anyhow in West Palm Beach so why I mean I'm
not trying to be cynical so if all this 19,000 plus mechanics etc that means go one with more power
to him then why should I vote again if I know that you know it's go one with fine you know
but that's not a good way to look at it I mean if you want to just you know he he's certainly
not going to concede while he's ahead theoretically and the numbers they got now and why should you
join the town that's not right but you see well coming from I mean I know I know I know I mean
unless you that lukewarm about George Bush I mean I don't understand it well I've been
the few days that I have to be realistic okay well I think like I said he made a good point and
if they do have a reelection in Palm Beach I think you're right the Bush people probably should
all stay home well because you know they said it's a least based at least at least one in West
Palm excellent point amigo all right thanks okay don't you think that's a real good idea let's have
the Bush people stay home that day because it's a numbers game baby I mean if they have a reelection
and recount they're not going to be able to dick around with those votes because they're going to
have more and Christopher down here and Janorino's going to be there with a real friend and they're
going to be watching it like crazy that's right they're going to be there with Billy Cubs baby
you're not going to put up with any more of this crap this Jeb Bush crap and Jeb Bush beer
and how are they a bunch of Bush Schmidt
here's Miami hello deal yes sir hello yeah good one of the assessment remarks was saying
that I voted for Gore okay here's the sign that says we've been Bush lacked I'm going to be
very disappointed if you lose this election but listen to me yes and we probably disagree on this
I see them now at some Palm Beach three or four times yes there's no way me walking in that booth
I'm gonna make that mistake I think the people that did or either careless you just not that bright
you know what when I go into the line I let me say this you have to be right to vote in America
is that a requirement well listen to me when I go into the voting booth I'm expecting you know
to really bear down to put my thinking cap on I scrutinize the language of these proposals
I really really focus okay there's no way I'm making that mistake but that's neither here nor there
if we're this you they school or loses this election okay I don't think you should I don't think
that the Democratic Party should sue I don't think they should put this country through a
attractive legal battle demanding new elections that I don't say in other words you're not
just you're getting forgetting about just about you're not disturbed about all the other
irregularities and the eight boxes are ten of those big Republican conspiracy to screw this up man
and you know what I think it'll show a class on the worst part if he's gonna do it in your
red-handed show clear why is it so important for him to show class and just hand the election
over to somebody who went into fix why is that important no it is not no it is not no
it is not if you're willing if you're willing to hand over to George Booster Keith of the Kingdom
and let him appoint fear for supreme court justice is we're not just talking about what's
going to happen for the next four years we're talking about what's going to happen in the next 40
or 50 years so if you're that room for him and you're that week then I don't I you know we're
entitled and you're talking about the people being careless about those people what about you
you're like the other guy the Julio just called before you oh he already threw in the top why vote
for Bush because they have a reelection and you know something the fact that that man called I'll
say this at least he's honest at Julio from from Morgan help Wellington because he knows Dan
well that there's a hell of a lot more Democrats in Palm Beach see the point that he's missing
the election in Palm Beach isn't going to decide the state all by itself not like it not like who
wins Palm Beach but of course it's by how much it adds to the total Florida vote you only get the
votes in the state of Florida if you win the popular vote by one so naturally I mean just comment
sense with him if you're for Bush every single vote that he gets is crucial because the margin
will be the difference we don't know right now how much Bush is going to wind up being ahead if
at all when they finish the recount here and after those other mysterious outer outer space ballots
unfolding down this is 560 QAF for radio 560 WQAM by having Fort Lauderdale a beastly broadcast
group stage hand WQAM dot com or the world one across the QAM it's a lot of the two hour
so a lot of the two hour it's not two thirty to say afternoon there's going to be a federal court
hearing to address possible voter irregularities in Florida I don't know how do you like that
federal court hearing now somebody faxed me channel 10's website click 10 dot com and it says they
have updates to the recount from each county with the original vote was but I can't I got their
website on here now but it got only knows where the hell it is I'm on their news page please
whoever faxed this to me tell me where the hell I find it maybe you can find it because I just don't
have time to do the way wow yeah here's a great fact from our Morris and Miami who says
throughout George W. Bush's presidential campaign he promised that a vote for him would be a vote
when politics is usual in speech after speech in almost every TV ad he vowed to restore honesty
and integrity to national politics and to be a healer not a divider now with a presidential
election hanging in the balance he has a unique opportunity to put his principles worse campaign
rhetoric has been it's become painfully apparent that perhaps as many as 20,000 voters in
Palm Beach County have had their votes invalidated as a result of a confusing ballot and that those
votes would have gone overwhelmingly to vice president gore if Bush wins the recount as of this
writing it's still unclear whether he'll prevail and the voters in Palm Beach County are deprived
of an opportunity to have their votes count the way they intended governor Bush will be awarded
for as electoral votes and the election in that event who has to accept the president's enuing
full well that's safe for a confusing ballot in Palm Beach County would have lost the election
this presidency would be tainted by the country's realization that he achieved that by
worthless disregarding the actual intentions of thousands of Palm Beach voters many of them older
and firm and duration as unpalatable as that scenario is if the governor hadn't promised he'd
put it into politics as usual it could just smirk and say when the election parents square that's
politics as usual and politics as usual dictates that it doesn't matter how you win as long as you win
can you find that thing but the governor has promised to restore honesty and integrity to politics
and that is precisely his dilemma he is hoisted by his own rhetorical patar if he truly is a man
of principally purports to be then he should refuse to accept a tainted election a man of integrity
would demand that the original election result in Palm Beach County be invalidated and a new
special election be held if Bush truly wishes to restore honesty and integrity the government
let him put his words into action let him do the honorable thing and demand a special election if
it does if he does it'll rebound to his credit and bowed well for his political future in the future
of our country if he does not he proves beyond that all about that despite his rhetoric it is just
politics as usual my score and amorace in my hand if we find it oh we're having trouble
loading it scored scored oh god maybe somebody will be fast maybe we have a fact to me that
thing about the channel 10 did you find where to find it or not it does not just
okay what do you mean 66 counties we don't have 56 counties
channel 10 let the recounts begin yeah
but it's not going there it's trying maybe there's eight million people on there maybe I should
have kept my malt shirt okay well we'll find it because that that's really the key is to find out
we know that they're 45 of the 67 counties that have reverted a re recounted and 795 is the
lead for Bush at this point but we just don't know which of the counties there is nothing there
well like I said please read this lesson guy facts minimum fine where it is
okay where we going here's a lady in Miami hello lady in Miami oh I'm sorry yes ma'am just
to comment on the challenge of the Florida statute saying the balance it has to be the right hand
side and that gentleman saying that the Spanish one is to the left right I hope somebody is searching
the Florida statute to see if they address that particular issue as far as populations are
and probably the instructions in Spanish to those people would be that vote to the your last
so I hope somebody's looking to that because that's a real challenge it I think the only hope we have
is in court and that is a real bad as it doesn't hold up well all I know is that the one in Palm Beach
I have it right in front of me the instructions the voting instructions say the vote use the
punching instrument attacks of the chain the chain the automatic punch straight down to the
hole for the right of the year by the candidate the ratio of your choice and there's no Spanish
from the other side no not a lot of Palm Beach no okay so then maybe we do have we do have a
chance with that regardless of the Spanish thing yeah I don't think the Spanish things are going
to come into play okay good those are not disputed votes okay thanks bye bye okay we are do we get
anything I'm looking at the facts machine nothing coming what does that piss me off because
requiring minds including mine want to know I want to see if the luci is on there I want to see
the panels ever showed up I'm not talking about the mirror I mean the county
here's Miami hello yeah hello yes sir Neil how you doing good isn't American great yeah I'm
out of it so it isn't it I'm in a community and there's like thousands of people protesting right
there for a quarter of the West Palm Beach going eight shot man they're just losing it yeah the
piece for a lot by the side of the army I mean they're not tearing the city up they're just
the screaming yellow I'm wondering when the West Palm Beach police are going to be to top out of
them and if they can't what on they call them as a county and the city of Miami police go
and be to top out yeah okay say hi to alien give me a big kiss asshole five six and I don't see
anybody you know I'll wait a minute it's the same thing and they're not showing which counties I
don't see anybody setting any buildings on fire starting any fires in the streets there people
who they're signs they're marching and protesting and making some noise that's the mercaneff and
they're not going to be a cop out learning the lesson learn how it works they're not blocking traffic
they're not screwing up anybody's life throughout their way they belong in front of the federal
courthouse there in Palm Beach not blocking off them across the crossway or doing any of the other
ablution things that we've done down here so yeah I all your sarcasm is fallen on deaf ears by
everyone in the Saudi it's with a brain larger than a bar bearing and guess what we're talking
about a presidential election not about a custody challenge between a father and a son that don't
confuse you with the fact and alien oh gee you know something I wonder if he had his happy meal today
Christ he had his unhappy meal here here is a mobile and candle hello
Neil God yes sir the gorge bushland that election over there in Washington
over there in Washington yeah what do you mean by that
didn't you watch the re the south and gorge the north sir I don't know get it get some help
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18t and horizon wireless line and by the way Washington
war one and both Washington DC and Washington AC and stayed up here's mobile and fort Myers hello
hey you know how you know okay uh if you look at the uh the uh the ballot uh the example ballot
yeah yeah and you see the arrows it's the the moment the no holes uh it's pointing at the line
that separates the candidates the different parties you see it like it's pointing to the line
no wait I got to find yeah well the one that I have with no holes on it is just pointing uh both
yeah it's pointing to that or or is on a line though okay yeah which is good okay but there's no holes
there and if you look at the real one you see that the arrow is not only below the line now
along with the hole but the arrow is also further to the right it's it's i believe there's a
greater distance uh so it's off screw yeah the arrow is right over against the edge of the page
yeah but as as opposed to the ones on the right hand page which the arrow is about an eighth of an
inch just to the right it's just a clamp it's just inconsistent it's in collision and I'd like to put
a request and if you define it time I don't know if you played as soon as three of us you might
apply it right in and uh maybe you should rename it uh sitting on a ballot box in the Del Rey
okay thank you thanks not a bad idea they go blind sitting on a ballot box in Del Rey squeezing it
okay here now here's another one it says go to oh here it is thank you god bless you
instead of having to touch you around here on the internet as of 1250 as of 20 minutes ago the
county shaded in yellow oh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh shaded yellow have already
answered the recounts what the hell does that mean the one shaded yellow of course it's in black and white
but at least it's got the numbers next to me I mean I think I even I can figure that out
now let's see which of the ones were considered about oh there's another page well on the plate
okay let's look at the counties that are still yet to come in
but what was the one I was considered about panelists panel all panelists is not in
uh in there yet panelists is not in there uh oh and valuja valuja is not in there yet George
halluja is not in there yet so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
you're self-intitte baby what about orange county orange county in there yet no orange county is
also not in there you know that corridor over there that I floor corridor wow oh no wait
but we have a new is this a new one 793 what was it before I'm on to go we see in 795 two votes there
46 out of 57 counties, it's now 793 down from 795, but I've point hastened to point out
that the counties where it's possible there's a big change at least.
Last night we were led to believe that the Penelope says maybe it's 4 or 500 vote change.
They're not in yet.
So we have 21 counties to go yet.
God, this is enough material.
Kishki's out.
I'm as mad as hell as I look for the biggest thing for us.
My wife took the card of the wall.
She drives my bullet and she's three feet tall.
I wouldn't write with her no way.
I said I'd be there there leaving it again.
So I'm just sitting on a bench in the rain.
Waiting for the only person to take me away.
All I'm just sitting on a bench in the rain,
it's time to change.
I'm as mad as you try to tell my change.
But if I say this all I say the same.
I don't know what to do but never tell me to do.
The time that her legs keep us paying.
I'm just sitting in resting my bones.
When then why my wife won't leave me alone.
We've talked it over and I never win.
I just wind up shripping through the wall again.
Only so I sit on a bench in the rain.
Waiting for the only person to take me away.
Only just sitting on a bench in the rain,
it's time to change.
And there it is.
I can't die.
That's where we all stand in the bench with a hell of a gun.
Only so I can't die.
I'm trying to count the number of counties on here.
Thanks for facing me.
There are some counties where they have dashes in the air.
Under Bush and Gorge.
I'm assuming now that maybe that means they were counted.
I'm assuming that there's no change.
Because the other ones are blank.
But I'd have to add them up to be sure if it comes out to 46 or what it is.
I don't know what it is.
Let me just count the ones where there's a number.
There are two four six eight ten twelve fourteen sixteen eighteen twenty twenty two twenty four twenty five twenty seven twenty nine thirty one thirty three.
Now there are two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven.
Yeah, I guess that's it.
So the wall.
So the loser is in there.
The loser has been counted and there's no change.
And what was the other one we were looking at?
Penelope?
No, Penelope is not in there.
That's going to be the big one.
If it stands as the way it was last night.
Here's a lady in Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, ma'am.
Neil.
In old Cone, you don't know area this tonight.
We were told by the mail carrier that four boxes were left behind.
And this night of the election in the African American area.
And I don't know if they were sent up or what it was, but I sent it as her off to the commissioner of this district.
But I didn't know that I heard from the mail carrier that four boxes were not sent up.
I mean, definitely regularity that should never happen.
And then the second thing is that they're talking about the army.
Bringing in these votes.
And all the folks, the whole election, George Bush, they're talking about the army.
He's going to do this and that's the other, and the Chinese blah, blah, blah.
And the Americans seem to have a very short memory that he was a big Chinese who cut this down signs the army and cut everything right after the Gulf War.
He was the one responsible for all the army going down to nothing.
Yeah, well, he was trying to live up to his men.
And he's trying to come back now and say that they want to do so much for the army.
And if the army boys were listening, they would realize that our goal is fed.
He was going to spend $10 million more than George Bush on the army.
And so these two oil flickers, you know, if they get him, we're going to have oil all over the White House lawn.
Amen. We're going to be up to our ears in the oil.
And then I wouldn't be surprised, you know, if the backlash of the alien saying, with the Cuban vote, you know, with Cuban mafia,
with a few republic clans had something to do with all the issues.
Okay, I'm sure, in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if alien becomes the next president.
Oh, yeah. I think that's where we're going to solve it.
Maybe tomorrow we'll take that poll.
Didn't he win the right one vote in certain places?
I think in three water, he did pretty good.
In fact, in highly they said, let's build a new stadium.
We'll make alien the president of the baseball team and he can pitch on alternate wins.
Now, here's one of the facts that I just, I can't finger this out for a lot of money.
It says, if the whole has to be on the right of the name, and the English Spanish area has asked yourself this,
is the whole to the right of the name and the answer is yes.
The name is also on the same line to the right of the whole, but the requirement for the whole to be on the right of the name was met.
Are you following that?
It says, the name is on the same line on the right of the whole, but the requirement for the whole to be on the right of the name was met.
It was not met.
For example, if you wanted to vote for a Buchanan, the whole was met.
No, no, this is the ones that had a Spanish.
Oh, yeah.
Everything to the right on those two.
The far right, yeah.
Yeah, way off to the right, as you'd expect.
Now, what's one of the pieces they want?
What's it?
What hints you?
Wow.
Okay, now here's the fact that says, for my nine-year-old God child,
it says, dear whom will they ever be concerned?
Hello, before I say what I need to say, let me tell you a little bit about me.
I'm nine years old.
I live in Florida, South Florida.
My parents are Democrats, and I have a complaint.
Whoever made Florida's ballots is not very smart.
Everyone knows whether they want to admit it or not.
Florida's ballots were confusing.
I think you should hold a revo for the state of Florida.
If you're not convinced, please write back, and I'll write you again.
I hope I made the least of small difference in this year, but anyone, thank you, Amanda.
Nice go, Amanda, who's up there in Boka.
And I'm sure it probably has a much better understanding already, even if it be a good nine of those ballots,
than some of the people who voted, because they're confused.
Here's Evan Chirra.
Hello.
Even the Ohio you doing.
Good.
I got a question.
When we had the mayor election for Miami, it was a big scandal.
What did the federal court report?
About the dead people.
Sorry?
About the dead people who voted?
Yeah, wasn't there a big scandal?
I mean, wasn't the federal court coming in to die to throw out all the absentee ballots in that?
It wasn't the federal court that came in and long after it.
What do you say?
Well, I saw an interview.
Absolutely, I don't know.
You know, they get you out the ones that were in the ballot.
They ensure, of course, they ensure, well, not the ones that were dead people.
I think it was a decision that said that they were going to get all absentee ballots in that.
Yeah, and how about I bring the second back here?
You may be right.
I think they may have thrown them all out.
Well, my question is, I saw Janet Reno on CNN do a lot of...
I think that's all the absentee ballots that were out.
Yeah.
Well, my question is, like, when I saw Janet Reno on her press conference on CNN,
she was saying that she was not going to get the federal government involved in this.
And, you know, I'm thinking it's not crazy because if they came in and got involved in the net election,
we have so much allegations of impropriety here with such enormous national implications.
Why would the federal government not get involved in this?
Okay, I got to go.
Another...
Now, what is this?
Penalty is complete.
Bush lost 51 votes in Penalty.
And, Gore gained no Gore loss.
How the hell are you going to know?
I mean, I've got it backwards.
Yeah, that's right.
Bush lost 51 and Gore gained 404.
So that's a difference of 455.
But I don't see that that doesn't reflect in here.
Because I'm looking on...
Now, let me just check the totals on here.
Bush was originally...
Okay, well, then that's not on here yet.
Where the hell did he get this?
Whoever got this must be way ahead of me.
Or else he got these numbers out of the newspaper,
which I think what these numbers are,
what they came up with last night.
But they said, we're not.
We have to recount this a little discrepancy in there somewhere.
But I'm glad to get that number again,
because if that's the case, 455, if that's right,
that would cut the margin down to 338.
Just in one county.
But it is not reflected in that total at the show right now,
46 of the 67 counties, and Bush with a 793 vote lead.
So how do you like that?
I'll look him say is...
But for the Bush people out there,
there is some good news.
Some reassuring news net is that the judge,
this federal judge who's going to be holding the hearing at 230
and the irregularities, is a Bush Republican.
A good old boy.
So things may turn out for the Bush-Minds-Durant.
Well, they may actually wind up stealing this election.
Of course, this is the only one thing.
This is just about voter irregularities.
We don't know what that counts.
What that encompasses.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello?
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I got two little spirited ports for you.
I'm driving my little banana.
I'm going to stick my phone out the window.
Ooh, it's, ooh, it's, ooh.
Here's the other reporter.
I'm talking about Liberty City now.
Woof, woof, woof!
Okay, good.
246-8.
Who do we are now?
Let's see.
Here's...
I'm just barely there.
10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20,
22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 33, once I do, through.
This is not right.
This stuff that was faxed to me just do not be right.
Because it doesn't have anywhere near 46 counties on here having a...
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not counting the ones with the dashes.
Let me try it again.
This compound, folks.
Whistle Dixie.
246-8.
10, 12.
14, 16, 18, 20.
22, 24, 26, 28, 30.
32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 45, and then the one additional one that they came up with, it's right.
So, panelists is still not in there.
Alex or the county.
Yeah, let's put Mayor Pena Picanian a box.
And a lock box, that sounds good to me.
So, how do you like that?
So, thank you, Joel, but your numbers are.
They may be accurate, but they're like recounting them a second time and they're not included in that totally yet.
Woof!
In fact, I said, this may come down like one vote, George.
To that we have the illegal aliens in the studio who can't vote.
I'm so ashamed.
Well, you better go vote right now.
I think it's still open.
Yeah, if you go down there and come, you can speak Spanish.
It's all my fault.
Just go down there and do it.
In fact, when I leave here, I'm going to go back to that volunteer park and plantation acres again.
I'm going to vote again.
Just to try to tighten up a little bit.
The Neil Rogers Show Sports Radio 560s.
You a heck.
My life just decadled us more.
He drives my doin' best, he's three feet tall.
I wouldn't ride with no way.
I said I needed real easy to do.
So I'm just sitting on a pension delivery.
Waiting for the police to take me away.
I'm just sitting on a pension delivery.
It's my film's time.
My flight is tight to time and change.
I wish the bus kids don't always be the same.
All I'm gonna do is get it tells me to do.
Besides at high rates, she must be in pain.
Just to begin, rest in my bones.
When then, why my wife won't leave me alone?
We've talked it over and I never went.
We just wind up schlepping through the wall again.
Only so I sit on a pension delivery.
Waiting for the lolly bus to take me away.
Only I'm just sitting on a pension delivery.
It's my film's time.
There he is.
I can't find that sweetly obvious in this bench.
Where the hell are you going?
Where the hell are you going?
What does the Bush campaign say?
They blightfully disarrisged the disenfranchised of thousands of Floridians as being the usual sort of mistake made of valence.
They cite legal provisions about published ballots in Texas.
They were barely.
They put a demand for finality ahead of the pursuit of fairness.
As for the substance of these responses, what we say that they aren't out, it remains unclear if the sample ballot published really contained all the elements including the alignment of the punch holes that the actual ballot reflected.
More importantly, let me be clear at what is at stake here.
Technicalities should not determine the presidency of the United States.
The will of the people should.
Demanding an ed to this election is not the same as demanding that the person who the people want as president takes office.
Here's what we intend to do about this.
Today the appropriate Florida Democratic officials will be requesting a hand count of ballots in Palm Beach County as well as three other counties.
The Lucia, Dade and Rower.
In addition to them announcing that we will be working with voters from Florida in support of legal actions and a man from redress for the disenfranchisement of more than 20,000 voters in Palm Beach County.
We believe that with so much at stake, steps should be taken to make sure that the people's choice becomes our president.
In addition, we are still collecting accounts of other irregularities, voter intimidation and other oddities and other parts of the state.
They can ifs substantiated and appropriate, they too will become part of legal actions.
Now let me address the concerns of those who say that these actions will delay the conclusion of this election or somehow we are seeking to drag this out.
All we are seeking is this that the candidate who the voters preferred become our president.
That is what our constitutional principles demand.
That is what true fidelity to our Constitution suggests.
That is what the American people truly deserve.
A wrath.
Moreover, we will move this meta head as quickly as as possible.
We do not want delay.
What we want, however, is democracy fulfilled.
Finally, let me address some remarks to the Bush campaign.
I believe that their actions that try to presentively crown themselves the victors to try to put in place a transition, run the risk of dividing the American people and creating a sense of confusion.
Let the legal system run its course.
Let the true and accurate rule of the people prevail.
And if at the end of the process, George Bush is the victor.
We will honor and obviously respect those results.
But we would expect the same measurements, the rule of law and democratic process, from their campaign in return.
Old claims, not based on the rule of the people.
Endanger the orderly transition of power.
Taking the time to ensure that the people's choices are president.
Is the best way to respect our democratic values and honor our Constitution.
That this time let me ask the former secretary of state war Christopher to make a free brief remarks.
Welcome in the ribs.
Come on.
Thank you, Bill.
Well, to shorten this up and then the neighborhood to get to your questions.
Let me just associate myself with Chairman Daly's comments.
I could put it in the single sentence.
We've come to believe that there are serious and substantial irregularities resulting from the ballot used only in one county.
But that ballot was confusing and illegal.
And the rising out of this is the need for regress in order to make sure that the will of the people can be properly honored in this situation.
Here now, I think that.
Okay, thanks.
What's my car keys, by the way, George?
He'd be doing it down there.
Is he?
No, I didn't let you.
They're in there amongst the best.
I saw him in music.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
I think he's going to be doing it.
Okay.
Did they all have to approve it?
Yes.
Well, not all the Democrats in the county, you know, whoever is in charge of the elections
office, they've made it together.
Okay.
But they all looked at it and they all did approve it.
Yes.
Okay.
And it's still illegal.
Yeah.
Okay.
If they lost that 19 hundred votes or 19 thousand votes, 19 thousand votes.
19 thousand votes.
19 thousand votes.
19 thousand votes.
19 thousand votes.
19 thousand votes.
19 thousand votes.
19 thousand votes.
And the county of the 19 thousand, too, they already threw them out.
Get the bottle out of your mouth.
Wait a minute.
Yes.
They already are sticking it and get with it.
Jesus Christ on this guy probably voted.
Oh, man.
God help us.
All I can say is get on your knees and pray to God and ask for forgiveness, sir, for your
idiotic whatever you're going to get with that skewed and that was just coming to the
phone.
It's nothing like making it want to take a hot shower.
21 before 2 at 5.
60 WQAM.
Are we back?
I'm listening to a.
Yeah.
I want to report us saying that the Republican side is saying, well, they already saw the
ballots ahead of time and yadda yadda.
And that's not relevant legally because you know, when something happens that in effect,
as the effect of taking away voters right or disenfranchising their votes, that's not kosher.
It's not legal.
Now, Joel, who in, and by the way, thank you, Joel, for the information, but the fact that
there's these insistent that I keep checking Channel 10's website and the fact that it's
panellas, they're wrong.
If it is, if they do have panellas on there, they're wrong.
The numbers are right from last night, but I'll say it again.
It was in the newspaper this morning, and it's also winning a sunsettinal, which they're up to date on it.
They had recounted panellas.
They were about to turn them in and they released the numbers, but then they said, oh, hold on a second.
We've got some other problem here and they still haven't turned it in yet.
Maybe they're waiting till the last end, huh?
Maybe they're waiting till the very end.
And we can lose that 500.
What was it again?
How many?
456.
I think it was like 1,800.
I think it was 2,800.
1,800.
And panellas, 45,000.
So they're waiting till the end.
Here's Palm Beach Garden.
Hello.
Hey, hey, Neil.
Okay.
I just had to tell you my experience with those because the ballot, that whole thing really was totally screwed up.
If I hadn't taken my sample ballot with me with all of the things, you know, go or and all that, all highlighted, I would have screwed it up at one point.
I was ready to just pull the super card out of there and start punching the numbers because I couldn't tell where the numbers were in there.
Right.
In the thing.
Right.
And then I hear these people go all these people on Palm Beach Garden. They're just making a big deal.
Well, they're really well.
If you sound like you're under the age of 100 to me.
Yeah, exactly.
And I couldn't even figure it out.
Right.
That's pretty bad.
And it is kind of cute those people working on those booths.
I mean, they're older than fire and just losing out there.
I went and asked the one girl and she's like, how are you helping me make a mistake because we've had the void about 20 of these today.
And I'm like, oh my god.
Oh, great.
So if that didn't tell them something, I don't know, you know, hopefully this will.
Well, I'm glad she had the void anyway.
That's usually a big problem of this.
Thanks for the good news, pal.
Cross your fingers and your legs.
It's coming right out of the wire, baby.
Still only 46.
It's pretty slow now.
You know, what do we have when we started day 32?
And then it was 35.
And then there was like a little spurt in there.
Gord's Gord in the middle of the late morning and early afternoon.
And then we just kind of stopped.
We come to a screeching hall at 46.
Now, how do you like what Bill lately said about the hand recount in Palm Beach and Valusia and Dave?
All I can say is about Palm Beach, Valusia and Dave.
And then we called Jack Webb, called Shylye Corms, called Colombo.
Didn't say Robert also.
He also said, and Howard, and there was another one.
We'll see.
Long way to go on this because we're talking six million votes in the state of Florida.
And we're talking about a 793 vote margin so far and it's still our count of yet.
Out of six million.
Here's a mobile invoker.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, I'm happy to be here.
I'd like to have a talk with you since you were a face to face.
Thanks.
You know, I want to give you a little example of my experience with this.
I wasn't, it said cover a phenomenon of work brought in a whole registration cards for all the dead that worked with.
If they weren't registered to register.
So we were like 18 registered.
And every single guy that registered as Republicans, there's went through and they were able to vote.
So I wouldn't vote the other day.
And I wasn't even in the system.
There's a 29 day rule you have to have your registration in within the nine days of election.
And the 12th second cover is when it was made over.
And vote for gold.
Okay, your foreign scrapping out.
But I think what he's trying to say is there's some strange reason that the people sent in their applications for a voter registration card back in September.
Republicans got theirs and he did not be in the Democrat.
And I may sound paranoid, but the fact is, reading about all kinds of things that have...
We had millions of people calling yesterday who said for the same reason they were denied the right to vote and give them a big run around.
And that was it. That was the end.
So I guess if you were black, you had a much tougher time.
If you were old, you had a tougher time.
If you were registered Democrat of any press weighs in, you had a tougher time in this state.
Yeah, get you a son sent in on a herald and a Palm Beach post and locked the door from the inside real tight with a couple of padlock.
And just sitting there with a flashlight in a dark corner somewhere and read all this crap.
And if no matter what your political persuasion is, if you don't come to the conclusion that there was a massive attempt to steal this election, then good luck to all of us.
Here's Bokeh. Hello.
Yeah, Neil.
Yes, sir. You played these songs like two Jews in Del Rey and all these are the voters that are there.
They got Cadillac. They got all timers.
What about them?
What about them?
Well, how about the guy who just called just before you were on. How about him?
He was the young guy probably in his 20s or 30s. You think he's got Cadillac and Alzheimer's?
No, I think you got a guy named Hoel and your head.
You got a Red Compe.
You know something, sir?
They're both counters, much is yours and mine.
Now, I agree with you. I'd like to get them off the road. No question we can always agree on that.
Get them off the highway. Take away their drivers license instead of in Sohan.
But you don't take away their right to vote.
And speaking of Alzheimer's, how's Ronnie doing? Seems to me he was president.
Oh, don't forget a grassroots rally schedule for three this afternoon in the town center, mall and Bokeh.
The location will be in the parking lot facing Glades Road in front of the restaurant Fridays and stir crazy.
It's expected there'll be to be coverage possible appearances from Congressman Robert Waxler and or Jesse Jackson who says if they don't make it fit, you're then your full of Schmidt.
The DMC in Washington is responded positively. The purpose is demand to revote and that Bush cannot steal a solution.
That's three o'clock today, town center mall and Bokeh.
Yesterday, Hank did a stellar expect packet of job of continuing talking about this.
Unlike the opposers in the morning holding the whole bar game and crap on this station.
I see Bruce is going to be throwing in there. I don't want to put any pressure on him because I know he's got a whole piece.
You know cook it five. We'll see what the booster comes up with.
Whether it's just some more like a bar game crap.
Here's a middle and must pop B. Hello?
I don't know. Okay.
Yeah, you know, the point thing about this whole thing and I'll sign a call yesterday, but I guess I couldn't get through with you.
But the phone that Bush is using is the same phone that it did in Ronald Reagan.
We was in a billion dollars deficit and go on playing golf.
Well, here they push and nothing you got one vote if they remember the billion dollars deficit that we was in back in the days.
And everybody was given out today.
Okay, Jay. Okay. Well, hang on to your butt a little longer because we still don't know who won yet. Okay. Hang on real tight.
A little bit late for campaigning now. Okay, boys and girls, I think it's a little bit late for that.
Here's a lady in Miami. Hello?
Hi, Neil. Yes, ma'am. How are you?
I had the same problem. I registered online to vote back in June.
And I was unable to vote on Tuesday.
I called them and they went back and forth with me and told me they had thousands of cards to process and it would be like looking for a needle or a haystack.
Well, it was an accurate. So they just took away your vote and I was able to register for primary September.
I mean, that I got my application in June.
And I couldn't even vote in the primary.
So I lost out. Good luck to once we got it.
But I'm a Democrat also. Well, that's probably why you lost out.
Good luck. Thanks.
Bye.
151 at 560 markets are taking a gigantic. Oh, look at that. That was down to 75.

He's going to be some right buying opportunity George. Now is the time to start thinking about bouncing on it.
You know what? It's taking a big dump because their guy is a day.
No, they know what's coming. Baby. They can smell it.

He's an apple-tractic over the whole thing and who the hell is it?
I mean, can there be anybody?
Well, I got my hair cut this morning.

But it looked good about everybody's up in arms and filming at the mouth about this stuff.
Still no no no no no no no.
