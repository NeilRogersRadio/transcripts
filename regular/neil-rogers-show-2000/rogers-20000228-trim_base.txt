In OSD, Y-M-T-K-S.
Father, like a bomb school!
Rock party, fast-power light!
Don't know how you made it, yet.
None of us did we know, right?
It's okay.
When I get out of the engine, here,
But right now, my major is stringing and beer, just in tune.
And for the lack of fast-power,
I'm not in the back.
I'm not in the back.
I'm not in the back, too!
You're not allowed in class!
I'm just a messer, but the system is for many acts!
Yeah!
I've been here for four more years.
There's more beer than beer, yet the truth.
I'm not in the back, too!
I'm not in the back, too!
I'm not in the back, too!
I'm not in the back, too!
I'm not in the back, too!
I'm not in the back, too!
Yeah!
I'm just checking it out.
10.0.2.5.60.
Nobody queue, I'm happy Monday to it.
Hey, listen!
When did doubt? Check it out.
You know what I'm saying?
Right!
So what is it going to be?
The Ramsey's of the Beach Boys for the rest of the mini-series.
Got to be sweep-sweak, isn't it?
The networks are frantically putting this crap man, old man.
I mean crap.
Did you see either one last night?
Not last night.
I saw a Ramsey thing earlier in the weekend.
I thought that was like a condom.
What do you mean this is like more of the same?
I thought this was the first episode last night.
Oh, I don't know.
I think it made the difference.
What?
Why can't I hear you today?
I don't know.
How is that?
Is that better?
There you go.
Oh, okay.
Do the whole show that way.
Okay.
Why the hell not?
So how the hell are you?
Oh, seriously.
This is with the first I believe.
And then on the ABC they got the Bleak Boys.
I mean cheesy, cheesy, cheesy acting.
And the Ramsey thing.
I mean, are we going to learn anything new on that?
No.
Well, what's the point?
I was watching some news thing.
Oh, and guess who the producer of this mini series is on CBS.
Lawrence Schiller, the one that wrote the book.
The 7,000 page book out of Ramsey.
In which he said, uh,
yeah, absolutely nothing.
Yeah, him.
Who also wrote an OJ book.
I'm going to tell you if you need anybody that didn't write an OJ book and they're,
they're, they're, they got to be down and out.
Everybody I know wrote an OJ book.
Even I think,
Roy is working on my one right now in a book too.
Yeah, they're really desperate boys and girls, okay, here's how our pool came out.
Wait a minute.
One moment, please.
Yeah, here's how the file came out.
I should realize that Eric always waits to all of a look at it.
We got 12 more votes, be time the between the time I left the house.
And let's see, we're even, uh, yeah, one bag.
Uh, it's kind of interesting though.
When we started this thing on Friday during the course of the show,
the number of homosexuals, uh, was considerably higher.
And then maybe they changed their mind over the weekend.
You think that might be it?
Oh, yeah.
Maybe with a new opening of a backstreet, back door, whatever that places.
Do you consider yourself exclusively heterosexual,
exclusively homosexual, not sure or bisexual?
We had 512 votes.
Not too bad.
Not too good.
I would have thought over the weekend we could have got a file.
I think basically it was that about the same 350 400 people.
That we have voting on the website, neo-rangers.com,
which is okay, because that's a pretty good sample.
And you know our intellectual crowd.
Yeah.
Exclusively, heterosexual, 416, 81.2%.
Oh, I wonder if that guy, thank God that we had this much of audience out there.
Oh, I feel so much better now.
Exclusively, homosexual, 38, 7.4%.
Which is about half of what it was running during the course of the show on Friday.
Like I said, maybe they changed their mind.
Or maybe they got the cure over there in Brandon.
That's possible.
Yeah.
Maybe they got cured.
35.
Oh, now this is interesting.
Almost as many not sure as homosexual.
35, 6.8%.
And you left.
You, E, of little faith when I put that category in there, not sure.
Because I didn't think that people like that were out there.
Yeah.
But it's still very funny that there are people like that.
It's very funny.
I don't think the word is funny.
Yeah.
I think it's sad.
I think it's sad.
It's not rocket science we're talking about.
And by the way, that cream they were talking about at the end of the morning showed there that the ED cream.
How long do you have to rub that on?
Anyway, not sure.
35, 6.8%.
Bisexual 23, 4.4%.
So if you take the exclusively homosexual and bisexual, that's like 11.8%.
Which I've always thought it would like 10 to 15%.
In spite of the fact that they're right wing.
You notice how the gay population of America has been reduced to like 3% now according to the right wing ultra-finanics.
Because they can manage handling the three if they admit that it's like 10 to 15% then gets out of control.
Well, you might as well lump the not sure in there.
Also, that would be like, well, I mean, there's a percentage of those that maybe it would break down along the same, I don't know.
Does anybody know?
I mean, if they don't know, how do we know?
And keep in mind, because we're doing this anonymously on our website, we don't have any idea what the age is.
They might be people who are very young or people who are very, very, uh, boy.
Oh, speaking of that.
Now before I get to that, oh, I got, I got stuff today, baby.
Woo!
Heavy, heavy.
Doodie, got my whole life has taken a major turn around since Saturday.
Yeah.
I've finally seen the light.
I'm not going to waste any more of my time trying to wake the dead.
24 years.
Day after tomorrow, I'll be 24 years of it and try to wake the dead here.
And now after Saturday, I will no longer waste my time doing that because now I understand that, oh!
There's our middle name.
But anyway, today's poll question on our website, neo-riders.com.
Let's see, how did I word this?
Do you agree with the not guilty verdict of the four New York cops?
Now, we don't have to mention the name in this, because they know what the case did that was decided in the Bronx.
With a totally unacceptable verdict, by the way.
And we'll talk about that today, maybe.
Maybe somebody here actually has an opinion on that, because there was only 41 shots.
Yeah.
I mean, how the hell could you find them guilty?
And this stuff that you see on television, you know, see they don't get enough target practice. That's the problem.
If they would have just shot what they thought was the gun which turned out to be a wallet.
If they would have just shot there out of his hand, then he'd probably still be alive today.
We wouldn't have all this crap going on.
And we couldn't be taking our poll today.
But they don't do that.
You're watching too much gun smoke, I think.
Yeah, too much smoke.
Anyway, that's our poll question.
Do you agree with the not guilty verdict of the four New York City cops?
Yes or no?
Very simple question.
For very simple people.
How do you like that?
See, they don't like it when we get too personal with this stuff about, you know,
are you a pedophile?
Have you ever molested an altered boy?
Things like that.
So anyway, get one better to do the break because once I get started on our experience on Saturday,
it may go on for a while.
It may go on for quite a while.
How's Line 4 doing by the way?
Duff is warned us already.
Oh, there you go.
It's better on the problem in a line for this warning.
He was right.
Although we actually did get it disconnected from the other thing in there.
And you'd be pleased to know that the new phone system is on the way from San Jose literally.
Is it here yet?
No, but it's on the way.
That's the warning we're killing.
And of course, when it gets your way...
Oh, come on.
That's no fun when that thing disconnects.
So we actually did get it so that it's disconnected.
But when you put it on the ear...
It's got a little bit of a problem.
You hear that?
Can you hear me now?
Yes.
How about that?
What do you want?
9 minutes after 10 at 560 WQF.
No portion of this broadcast may be reproduced without the express written permission of WQAM.
Be at least acquisition court.
I know.
I know.
I don't have a clue.
Tonight on VH1 Storytellers, it's a very special evening with Christina and Aguilera.
Like I got the idea, you know, for this song, one day when my manager told me, I had this thing.
Get the story behind the music from the woman, the lady, the adolescent who conquered the pop music world with her own unique style.
I got the idea for this song from Britney Ferris, you know.
Then I liked her my record company.
And the guy right at home and stuff.
Christina Aguilera on VH1 Storytellers.
I think like a big turning point for me musically, you know, was like when I finally realized,
I had a breast implants.
When they write the pop music history books, they'll file Christina Aguilera under A.
Hey, well?
Oh, no!
Christina Aguilera tonight on VH1 Storytellers.
They show where people who have nothing to say say, you know, stuff.
Throw out my back, Christina, huh?
I just can't stand that for that.
10, 14, at 5, 60, WQM Happy Monday to you.
We got a big Panther Buffalo game tonight.
Are the Panthers going to show up tonight?
No.
We don't know.
They haven't been showing up too much.
And by the way, the amongst their...
Oh!
And three.
I noticed they've scaled that thing down.
Almost of the poem works completely disappeared.
The bell, I don't mind.
Although they're not ringing it very much, because they don't screw up very many goals.
The bell, but the one monk over there we can handle.
With that music.
Panther's rock!
Panther's rock!
And that whole deal, man, those monks, they start.
Yeah, that's what everybody in town...
I ain't even asked Rimmer the other night.
Last night he calls me.
I said, how the monks do on Saturday?
They start.
You can't stand that over and over again.
How about the Panthers?
They start.
Yeah, that too.
But we got a big game against Buffalo tonight.
And, you know, look on the bright side as bad as this team is playing with no defense whatsoever.
And if the goalie whoever plays that night doesn't stand on their head, they get blown out.
But they've been standing on their head anyway.
But look at that.
Three games, they get four points.
Two ties and a win.
It's a freaking miracle.
I mean, two regulation ties anyway.
Anyway, getting back to Saturday.
I just want to make it an announcement now that comes very propiciously two days before my 24th anniversary on a year in Miami.
Saturday was my last public appearance ever.
Yes.
But Neil.
No, no chance.
But what if we...
They got enough of those stupid dumb picture cards, okay?
And by the way, no, we don't have any hockey tickets.
Now, there were some nice people that came by their Saturday.
I certainly don't want to disparage everybody who came by, including the one young couple that George kept very far away from me.
The ones who go to the swing club that he kept way, way, way away from me.
That wasn't by design.
Yeah, right.
I'll ask you.
Do I believe that?
No.
Oh, kept pushing them farther and farther like toward the valley.
They were pushing them away from you.
But at any rate, they wouldn't like that guy.
They wouldn't like that guy.
You wouldn't like that guy anyway.
Why not?
He was mediocre looking.
He was okay.
Not as good looking as his wife.
They were both okay.
In fact, I wouldn't mind watching him.
Anyway, he knows them from the swing club, George.
Anybody George knows.
He knows them from the swing club.
Just keep that in mind.
Oh, yeah.
They call.
They hang out.
So they speak.
I'm going to wind up going all over the place here.
I hate to do this, but I was thinking about that when I was thinking about them.
And I did think about them briefly because they were the only people under the age of 300 who showed up at all.
By the way, hey, Miguel.
Wheel, wheel.
Oh, this experience Saturday, you have to have to have been there to believe it.
But anyway, I was thinking about people.
It's like you're our good close person on the front.
I almost said your friend is still mine.
Joe Castello.
I mean, why should he be surprised?
See, I don't understand.
I understand people that go to a swing club to swing.
You know what I'm talking about?
To participate with other people.
And I guess there must be those people who are not swingers.
They're just exhibitionists, which is okay.
There are warriors there.
And of course, if they're warriors, they have to be exhibitionist.
Because if you want to look, there's got to be somebody to show you something to look at.
But don't tell me you were a swinger and then go there and, you know,
do all your stuff in front of everybody else.
And then complain that somebody is looking or swinging their face.
You know what I'm saying, Joe?
Seriously, I mean, Joe is an adult.
He's got plenty of places he could go with his lovely fiance.
And they could do whatever they want.
And I'm sure they do very often, especially on the days when he saves his nuts.
But I mean, you know, but don't go to a place like that.
And then complain that some old troll, some old fag is swinging his face in your face, okay?
I don't understand that.
I don't get it.
It was just too close for a comfort.
Yeah. Well, it all depends on who's comfort we're talking about.
And like I said, how many drops do you have to put on it at lotion and, you know,
how long you have to rub it?
Didn't you hear that spot at the end of their show this morning that ED?
No.
I think we're regressing here at QM.
When I first came here, the only spots we hit on the year were for the paramutials and limp of
chemises is all it was.
And now I think we're regressing.
Or maybe if that Bob doll ED spot me, that's what put him over the edge.
And by the way, Peter, we're not taking any with us, okay?
We want to wish the best of luck to Peter Leonard, who's leading us to go us off of the coast.
Wish him the best of luck with the Cox broadcasting.
Believe me, he'll need it.
Salonette Slice selling that Michael Bolton glory estiph on crap.
And let me also mention since I'm digressing from my appointed rounds,
because I'm trying to think of how to be diplomatic in presenting this conversation,
Dan LaBanstew, another who just a hint of thing in the hair over the way.
And we want these awards, Dan LaBanstew, and the award first to Peter the User are a moron.
Have you read any of his columns lately?
They stuck.
Oh, and the one this morning, talk about trying to rationalize away scumbags,
sports superstars discover reality hard to come by.
How can they be so strong when they put on the armor and so weak when they take it off?
And the whole thing is really a defense or rationalization for all the scumbags in sports.
And he says at the end, the surprise frankly isn't that so many of our athletes feel entitled.
The surprises that some of them don't.
Oh, give me a break.
Okay.
You, you jockstrap liquor, you phony baloney, professional spick, get out of my face.
Go away, Dan LaBanstew, you and by the way, don't ever use that studio again while we're on a year.
We're having enough phone problems as it is.
How is line four coming along?
I bet it's making a big comeback.
Let's hear it.
Huh?
The audience loves this sound, by the way.
I bet you we just left this on from now until the end of the book.
It's 22 years.
Yeah.
So anyway, I think that the pull we took on Friday over the weekend is pretty revealing.
Like that asshole that called me a couple of months ago, well, you got a lot of people listening who are light and the loafers.
You really don't have that big of an audience.
These ratings you've had over the years.
It's from all those what he's really trying to say is it's all those fags who listen because you know they want to hear another fag on a radio.
That certainly doesn't appear to be the case.
Does it?
No.
No.
And we did have a, we had sampling of smattering on Saturday.
Believe me.
At the appearance we had, if you wonder what I'm talking about today, seminal Indian casino of Hollywood, our good close personal sales hole friend Brian there.
He said, oh, yes, say whatever you want.
I like the publicity.
I mean, and I appreciate them having us there.
I'm really not sure why we were there.
You know why we're there besides for me to make some money and kill a couple of hours.
That was it.
Yeah.
Just a minute.
Like the same reason we show up here.
We make some money and kill four hours, which we do a great job of for the audience.
That's what everybody tells me.
Oh, man, it's great.
It makes those four hours go by.
Kills four hours and I'll buy this boring terminal life here.
And it's got for second very geriatric wheelchair written town speaking of wheels here is by the way, getting back to our thing.
Now, maybe it was just the time of the day that we were there.
It was the middle of the day on a Saturday.
You would assume that most living and breathing people middle of the day on Saturday, they're doing something.
And like maybe at night in the evening.
Do you follow what I'm saying?
That there would be a few people under the age of 200.
And please don't get me wrong because there were some very nice people there.
There are some nice old people, not too many, but there are some nice old people.
There were some.
But if I were to say to you that the crowd there was old, that would be the greatest understanding in the history of the human race.
And thank you.
And you know something I hate to say this.
Thank God for the guy with a fanny pack that came by.
Usually when I see him I learn my uptruck.
But actually he killed about 40 the last 45 minutes.
Because when you go on these appearances, if there's any kind of a turnout at all, two hours goes by like that.
We used to do three and four hours.
Remember those horrible days?
Too long.
Can you imagine him and Peter Lender together?
Oh, what a max made in Perkettor.
I'd love to see it.
But at any rate, he came by and killed because every minute was like an hour.
Every minute was like a lifetime like Eons.
Just incredible.
And you go into a place where there's all this gambling going on.
But like I said, if you like, if you have a weak heart, something like that, it's not like at the Panther games that when they did that thing last week with a fireworks, we're nearly have a heart attack.
You don't have to worry about any sudden outbursts or noise because there isn't any.
Is there any music?
No.
Are there bells ringing?
No.
Are there people?
Hey, all right.
No.
No.
They're just sitting around very quietly.
I mean, even I was going to say like, kukuznes, but they weren't quiet.
You know, there was nobody going, I want my cigarette.
There was nobody doing that.
And they had music.
They had Monovani.
They did?
Yeah, that's what nurse ratchet kept playing.
Oh, oh, and you mean the kukuznes.
Yeah.
They didn't have it in the background.
That's right.
They had Monovani.
No, there's no music.
And when we were there, I think they probably didn't want to disturb any of these people.
Maybe wake some of them up.
After you die.
What?
No, seriously, after you die, this is where you go.
I mean, I have never, and I don't want to sound unsyphatic.
I don't want to sound crash and cruel unless you feel that way, which is okay.
There were more people there in wheelchairs, walkers, canes, neck braces.
It was like the old and the infirm.
I have never seen anything.
Now, maybe this was just for my benefit.
Maybe this was a put on.
You know what I'm saying?
Because I can't imagine having lived here for almost 25 years now.
I can't imagine that there's all those old people, especially in Hollywood.
Oi!
You know what I'm saying?
I mean, it was unbelievable.
It was shocking to me.
And at that point, I said to myself, what in God's name am I doing here?
I don't mean in the casino.
And they were like, I said, I appreciate them having you there.
I appreciate them even wanting me to come out.
But I said, what am I doing here?
I mean, this is a place.
And both of random dates, I'm coming about the bathrooms.
I said, there are no bathrooms.
Here it's like BYOB.
Bring your own bag.
And or diapers is the case maybe.
I mean, the crowd was just a little bit on the old and quiet side.
Oi!
Death plus ten.
Oi!
And I'm saying, and I'm thinking about myself, why do I do these things?
What's the point?
What was the hook to bring people out there?
And then poor Miguel, who by far was the youngest person in the joint.
And they were, let me say it again, I saw some of you fags out there trolling, okay?
Stayed a hell away.
He ain't interested.
But he's sitting there with the QAM wheel.
And what are we giving away?
Those big fancy prizes that only QAM could give away.
QAM caps, baby.
Don't forget plastic cups and mouse pads.
Yeah, right.
That somebody else dropped off here by mistake one day.
They shifted the building and we intercepted the shipment.
So, and he's putting these people are coming up, spinning the wheel.
Okay.
And they're coming back over and over again.
How many times can you get to spin it?
And then when Miguel would step away from the wheel for like 30 seconds,
which would happen very rarely, I noticed, because I said they're staring at him the whole two hours.
Well, he might as well enjoy it somehow.
But at any rate, he'd step away for those things.
And then he'd say, hey, I'm going to go back to the hospital.
And then somebody purposely would have come wandering over or wheeling over the case.
But, will, will, to get him back to spin wheel again.
So they might win a QAM cap or one of those great mouse pads.
Will!
Shocking.
Absolutely.
And by the way, a couple of people, a couple of our listeners came by and said they had called the place.
Nobody there had any, just like your appearances at what is it that you go to?
A primeco.
Just like when George does his appearances at primeco.
It was kind of like the same thing.
Nobody there had any idea that I was going to be there that day, or George, or Volkabriner,
or Miguel or anybody else.
Nobody.
Well, we don't want to shock anybody, you know what I'm saying?
Sudden shock in that place would not be a good, a sudden loud noise like,
that would not be a good idea in that place.
We lose a whole lot of folks all at the same time.
I mean, what's the point of going out and how many picture cards could anybody possibly have at this point?
You know, those stupid picture cards.
I can understand if we're giving away a car, we're giving away even hockey tickets.
I had several people, are you giving away hockey tickets?
No!
Now get out of here.
I have no hockey tickets.
Including that one snore that's always sitting on me at the hockey games for free tickets.
Got an extra tickets?
He was there.
That's probably why he showed up there.
He was waiting for extra hockey tickets.
Just like the ones we're giving away on the year of the day.
For tonight's Buffalo game, I see five thousand unsolved tickets for tonight's game,
probably because of that performance by the team.
They stuck.
And the month.
They stuck.
26th after 10 at 560 WQM.
Oh, God, Neil.
Jane Bond, the Sager Byron.
Two tech turners.
The pack your bags don't let the door.
Hit you in the ass no longer he will never be your tech turner.
You don't want to be your fellow.
He's had it with your scams.
No longer far from a real life.
Why don't you just go back to Vietnam?
You spend eight years with tech turners.
And now it's time to give you new threats.
He bought them that's not bad.
No longer he will ever be your teacher.
Okay, that's our musical pull-quack today.
By the way, the Beach Boys better than the Aramzies.
1031 at 560.
QM speaking, I'm using pride.
The way here's the facts.
You want to get really depressed.
All these 104.3 WOMC's Dick Purt and Radio Thon benefit in the Salvation Army and the
Bed and Bread Club raises a record breaking.
726,384.
How do you like that?
How long is it a 16 hour free-giverware to hell?
They do a radio thon and they raise almost three quarters of a million dollars for the homeless.
We used to raise money for the house here.
We have to raise anything close to that.
You have to forget about raising money.
It's like trying to raise the dead.
The timing is perfect.
Thank you, Fred Wolf Jr. for the fact that this is me.

T="#ıyorlar, Spirula iPod,
Princess Fyodor,
I think any other citizen or anybody else in the same situation would have to have seen
the gun.
This man goes in his back pocket to pull out his wallet.
First of all, there's a language barrier.
And when he comes up with the wallet or when he starts to come up with the wallet, shooting
him, I believe it was basically an attempted, they wanted to kill the guy.
There's no doubt.
They didn't want to stop him, they didn't want to subdue the individual.
They just basically wanted to shoot him dead.
If they didn't, I can see them shooting him once or twice, but 19 times.
Yeah.
And how come they weren't trying to shoot what they thought was the gun out of his hand?
Well, that's a little difficult in a tense situation.
I really do need it.
It is?
Yes, it is.
And I really believe in more cops.
Well, I also believe that you have a situation where these guys...
I mean, they were shooting to kill this guy.
Exactly.
There's no doubt.
Also, I believe that what they did, they did out of just being totally frightened.
I mean, they were very scared themselves.
I mean, you know, just because they were for police officers at the door, they were very
afraid of the situation surrounding area, etc.
When they shot.
They were very afraid of the surrounding area.
That's their job.
True.
But they were afraid nonetheless.
They were afraid of the white guy.
But cops don't ever admit to the fact that they're afraid, but they are afraid.
And this is a perfect example of them being so frightened to the fact that they overreacted.
Well, maybe they overreact to me as an understatement.
Absolutely.
Overreact.
They went bananas.
They went ballistic if you pardon that expression.
Okay, and have a great day.
They were scared.
They were terrified because this one guy was going to kill him with his wallet.
Now, I will say this years ago, back during those days of Maryl Boliv, I had two handguns
that I got.
And one of them was a handgun in the, it was a wallet handgun.
Have you ever seen those?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
And you can pull it all your back pocket and guess what it is a gun.
But did the guy have that?
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
So, where was it on?
Maybe MSNBC about the guy.
He's an opera singer in some kind of a Broadway play.
Whatever hell this guy does.
Black guy in the wrong place at the wrong time.
This was an LA.
See LA in New York, these are two great ones.
This stuff happens all the time.
And there was a report that there were four drug peddlers, young Hispanics, 17 to 21.
This guy's like 35 years old.
Doesn't look anything like 17 to 21.
And he's, I guess Hispanics, of course, could be black.
But in this case, he was dark.
And they come in and they handcuffed him and they first him and they act as if I asked
off the jail.
This is a police state, baby.
A police state.
Here's a call in Wilton Manners.
Hello?
Well, Manners.
Yes, sir.
How you doing, Neil?
OK.
I don't know if you think about that the New York police department situation with a guy is
in shot 42.
Are you listening to the show?
Yes.
And you wonder what I think about it?
Yeah.
Well, you're not hearing what I'm saying, right?
You don't like the situation?
I don't like the situation.
What does that mean?
How about those panthers, Neil?
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line, another more run.
You know, I can't tell you how many people come up to meet the hockey games and they say
to me, what are you doing here?
We just, we feel so sorry for the fact that you come on here every day.
You're entertaining.
We love your show.
You're brilliant.
You're brilliant.
This is how you get it.
And then this is what you get.
This is the response.
Only in this town.
Only in this town with dead people and illegal aliens.
And what am I getting upset about?
I've been doing it for 24 years.
Here's another asshole with absolutely nothing to say.
Nothing.
Probably a Wilton Manor's cop, if you ask me.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
This is the only place in America where there's any kind of a talk show with this story going
on.
I mean, forget about anything else that might be going on here.
Where you'd have to wait.
You'd have to go through like a mini-snit again to get a response.
Day after day after day, five days a week, 47, 48 weeks a year, whatever it's been.
To try to have somebody with some coherent thought on anything in the world.
We got more and more on for Square Ench than any place in the universe.
That's another one put on our goddamn resume, baby.
More assholes for Square Ench than any place you can throw at us.
We got you licked.
Here's Bokeh.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing today?
Great.
Neil, I got a Pauling story for you.
First of all, I got some more on.
No kidding.
What do you think of it?
A list of the show facts.
Anyway, Neil, I've just come from Sears.
I'm going in an hour late for work to get these tickets.
Somebody told me you get these tickets for $14 to the game.
So I'd be a schlepper and go down and get three tickets and take my buddy.
I go down there and sign at Sears.
I know where Sears Town is on the sunrise Boulevard.
Uh-huh.
And a ticket master says, ticket master closed.
You got 20 people in line just sitting there.
So I forged my way up to the front and I asked the lady why you're closed.
She's doing that.
I get to do the telephone bills in there as well.
She goes, the person from ticket master didn't show up for today.
So you got all these schleppers there.
Why would you want them to show up today just because we have a game tonight?
Right.
So I stayed at the lane and I said, well, what's going on?
Is there going to be somebody that's going to come in and punch these tickets?
You know, and you could, I would have paid for the regular tickets.
I just wanted to get to the front and get the tickets.
You could tell these people got a back change on the line for the two Panther packs,
the three Panther packs.
So he goes, no, we're closed.
I said, well, I'd like to speak to the manager being that I'm in the hospitality business.
I just couldn't see that happening.
So the manager comes down and she says, I'm sorry.
We have nobody that's capable here to work the thing.
And we have nobody that's here with a code to get into the computer.
And I said, well, that's on its set, the bike.
If somebody doesn't show up at a business, you just close the business.
Well, we're not responsible for ticket master.
Guys, I mean, she's telling me, we only get $1.75 from it anyway.
And I said, well, what is that?
They don't give a crap.
And then finally, the general, now I'm on the phone with ticket master trying to get tickets
another way, who I can't get through to anyway, because there are more on over there at ticket master.
And then we want to know why people don't show up to these games.
So finally, the manager, the store manager, she called herself the general manager, comes down.
She tells this lady that we have been talking to to go on the computer and sell the ticket.
So now we're at $10.45 now.
So finally, she logs on and gets on the computer and she goes, I'm sorry.
We're all out of pants with packs.
It's just crazy, Neil.
It's crazy how you need to send assistance from New York City police.
It's, yeah, 41 times in the back of the head.
That's what I think it is.
It's crazy how people treat businesses run down here.
Right.
And then they want to know why they don't prepare this one word that sums up this entire area.
Schlock.
Schlock.
Neil, the way business is done here, the way everything is done.
Schlock.
Promotion.
Schlock.
It's terrible.
So I was sucking around for the tickets.
I think you pardon?
So I was going to suck around for the tickets.
Suck around for what tickets?
For some pants or tickets.
From who?
From yourself.
To help a brother out for the night's game.
And where would I get those?
Oh, you got connections, Neil.
You're the man of the 10 years.
And you're the man of the 10 years.
And you're the man of the 10 years.
And you're after all of this crap that I just let you be on here.
This terminal is unbelievable boring crap that I just listened to.
And after you got through, I telling me, and you telling me that the guy before me was a moron and a bozo,
which he was.
And now you're the whole purpose of this is to suck around for tickets that I don't have.
You always have them.
Yeah, yeah, I have mine.
And I'm not giving you my tickets.
I'll trade you.
I give you some tickets to go to a pomp and a harness tonight.
Yeah, okay, great.
I sure miss those old people from Saturday.
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T while it's not.
Come on.
Doesn't anybody want these pants or tickets?
Here's Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Fort Lauderdale.
Yeah, hi.
Yes, sir.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Can you hear me?
Hi, here you are.
Can you hear me, sir?
Oh, I can't hear you.
Don't swear it's unbelievable.
I love your show because it's controversial.
Sure.
And you bring up a lot of emotion in the oven down here about four or five months and I enjoy it.
I enjoy it.
But I got to enjoy what?
I enjoy your show because you'll bring out all my emotions.
Okay.
Absolutely.
And don't say crap against it.
I had to dump the pleas that were on the radio.
I didn't hear it.
What did you say?
You didn't hear what?
Whatever you dumped.
I missed it.
I wasn't paying attention.
Shoot.
What section are you in at the hockey game?
I know you said it 25 times.
You know what just happened here?
Look at that.
Okay.
If you notice and I go to show I must be getting old and slow.
We just, this guy disappeared just like he never existed in line eight came on by itself.
Excellent.
Segway, by the way.
Yeah.
And it sounded like the guy had found the fountain of youth.
He just lost 20 years on his age, all of a sudden, or 30 years, or maybe 100.
Anything was 100?
Yeah.
All of a sudden the guy got younger.
This phone system is not only unacceptable.
It's a piece of crap.
It's still doing the same funky unacceptable things that it's been doing for two years now downstairs upstairs inside outside.
That was in the history of your life.
I don't think anybody has ever heard that before on a radio show in the bathroom in their closet.
Just go from the from the middle of a word from one guy and all of a sudden here's another guy comes on from the hell out of nowhere.
On this line eight on the magic line that just pops on whatever it's in the mood.
How do you like that?
Yes, the Viagre line.
It's just kind of like pops up whenever it feels like it.
Oh, these people this company this Greg read this place.
But the good news is the new systems on the way in the mail.
Go to jail.
1056 and 560 WQ.
WQ?
It's summertime.
Yes, get down with the man who puts a disk in this functional and see summer.
It's the album that's running its way to the top of the shop.
Please have a don't hurt yourself.
Yes, I did.
You get unable to touch it.
Have you viewed her and the stammer's latest lies?
You got to.
But critic degree about MC stammer.
Billboy says, get it out.
MTV says that's easy for you to think.
And Ebony says, say one homie.
On the hell.
Please have a don't hurt yourself available everywhere on CD record and tape.
Okay, I'm about to a 560 WQ.
I'm going to have to go over it.
Chula's it to Geldey on game nine to six.
Panthers in a Buffalo Sabers to really struggling teams pregame at seven seven thirty at the macaroon.
Eddie K after the game got that so far.
Good.
Yeah, I got some a panther tickets.
Here's a mobile in North Miami Beach.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, Neil.
What can you expect from a town I'm driving right now and the person in front of me has a bumper ticket that says.
My boss is a Jewish carpenter.
Oh, yeah.
You know, I'm looking at you.
Right.
Okay, and please don't leave us.
Okay, I disagree with about 80% of the things you say.
However, I really like to disagree with anything that I say but nevertheless.
Okay, right.
Okay, the bad thing about the cops shooting this guy is that that he's dead.
Yeah, no, I bring up people like Sharpton and Jesse Jackson who had the balls to go and talk at a Jewish.
Oh, I.
You know, I do it.
Yeah, really.
I mean, I'm a Hispanic, okay, but I know what Jesse Jackson thinks of Jews and for that matter for his panic also.
You know, that's what the bad part about this thing is.
Of course, and it's not and no seriousness.
The fact that I shouldn't have been, you know, shot 41 times.
And then Jesse comes down here and starts to think about this FHP thing, which we all know about that about the grotesque.
But if the victims would have been two white brothers instead of two black brothers,
would Jesse Jackson have been out on here screaming about the, I say FHP, the FBI would have been down here screaming about it?
No, no, no.
The last time I just like to do, just like the students up there in Illinois that he was screaming about those fights starting scumbags in his face.
Yeah, they were blacks and actually he's up there screaming and so on.
Like I was saying, you know, the last job Jesse Jackson had was making hamburgers and spitting at the person with white.
Yeah, and he had the guts to come in.
Yeah, but at least he was spitting the soup anyway.
That was really good.
Okay, have a great day, pal.
Stick around.
Okay.
Do you think they speak around five six seven oh five sixty.
That we wouldn't have sung by the beach boys.
I speak around.
Yeah.
Beach boys are the Ramses.
Come on.
Let's hear it.
Well, they only had that one big hit.
The Randleys.
Yeah.
It was a killer though.
Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line.
I mean, you talk about desperate to fill up all these hours.
One thing I like about MSNBC they got five shows and they showed over and over again all day.
Five shows.
We got the one on JFK Jr.
We got the one about the the bad pills and we got the one about his swallery and they show the same five things over and over again all day.
But you know what it's your beach John Gibson.
Please don't put John Gibson's post on there again.
Put anything on.
How's the market doing by the way?
It started out.
It was up about seventy four a couple of seconds and then it went to the look.
That's bad.
All right.
No wonder people are busy.
They're buying stuff.
Yeah.
That was up a hundred and seventy freaking point.
Yeah.
Nice next down sixty six but too bad.
That tech is direct.
I've been trying to tell you that.
All your people they bought pool my at four and now it's a hundred and sixty two.
True story.
Went to a hundred and sixty two on Friday.
I was given a tip at four dollars a year and I'm sitting here.
So it's an admission on my part.
I'm a moron.
I'm a schmuck.
I'm an idiot.
I'm a fool.
I'm a jackass.
Dunderhead.
Schmuck.
Puts.
A hundred and seventy.
There's a good friend.
Ted David.
Ten percent of its shares.
Yeah.
Camel Camdonted.
Look at that.
Don't look anymore.
See this is like it's like watching a lease game.
I don't do it.
I just turn on real quick in between the sea with the scores because I'm bad luck.
If I watch for more than ten seconds the market will take a precipitous drop.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Yes sir.
Happy Monday.
Thank you.
You know that incident in New York couldn't have been avoided if one of the cops hadn't
been a clock.
Yeah.
Right.
When the guy told the guy he was walled out there deadly wallets.
One of the cops yelled he's got a gun.
And as he went to point it at the guy.
He fell off the curb and shot the other cops.
So that this guy had just shot there.
So what about when he was a little balanced.
Is that what you're saying sir?
I'm sorry.
A little unbalanced.
Yeah.
I think.
Yeah.
So to speak.
Right.
Okay.
Well he made his point and he's busy now.
He's got to go buy some stock before it goes through the roof again.
Got to buy it at these bargain basement levels.
Everybody get out with your broker right now and buy buy buy.
Come on let's go.
Let's get that thing up to 15,000 before the day is up.
Let's get it up to 25,000 and I won't have to come back here again tomorrow.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
The company that refuses to care.
The wannabe's leaves.
And I'm so pleased to know by the way George that Bob the Moose is outraged with Bell South.
And with this.
Yeah right.
Outrage.
It's a little bit slow but once he gets pissed boy look out for him.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes sir.
Good morning Neil.
How are you?
Great.
I just want to talk a little bit about that the situation in New York with the police officers.
Yes.
I agree with you that there was a degree of overreaction on the part of the police officers.
Overkill yeah.
The grief.
However those situations when the first part of a bus, the drug bus like that.
By far the highest probability of a police officer.
What what it means drug bus?
Well it's not a drug bus.
They thought when they're when they're when they're involved with when they have guns drawn and they're in the process of holding you know getting a prisoner or getting a person to the point where they're restrained.
This guy with four guns drawn reaches in to pull out his wallet.
But it does not sound like a very smart move on the park.
I mean if I've got four police officers who are holding guns on me.
I'm not going to reach in anywhere.
I'm going to keep my hands behind my head and wait for a police officer to restrain me.
Yeah.
I mean just in the defense of the police officers it's a lot of people don't take a position where they realize they're facing somebody who's got deadly force and who's accustomed to using deadly force to protect themselves.
And you've got police officers like this.
They don't know if the guy's going for a gun or if he's going for his wallet.
And none of them are willing to risk their lives in a sense and take a bullet to wait to see if the guy's actually pulling a gun.
Yeah but how many how many how many let me ask you this how much via how much it's like the Rodney King thing how much force was necessary to restrain somebody or to shoot the gun out of his hand or whatever once he had his hand.
Does it take 41 shots?
They will not shoot the gun out of anybody's hands.
Why not?
It's for two reasons one because they don't have they don't have good enough aim.
Why not?
Armed somebody.
They don't have enough aim.
Generally speaking because if they start firing and they don't dishon the guy they're going to get killed.
When they clear our, they're out shooting their army.
Sure there are four of these armed cops okay and one man.
Four.
Count them.
But they're procedures I'm telling you that the procedures that when they draw their guns they don't draw to dishon somebody.
They draw to kill them.
They draw to kill them.
Well that's great that's perfect.
Thanks for the good news.
Thank you very much.
Once you draw the gun and the guy says gun that's what the one officer yelled he said gun and all of a sudden.
Two more.
Thank you.
They're defending.
They're defending.
I feel safer.
Yeah I feel a lot safer knowing that this scumbag serial rapist only wasn't.
He wasn't the guy.
He was the wrong guy.
Uh huh.
Wrong guy.
Never stole a freight train.
Never did not.
But he reached for his wallet.
That's the lesson for all you kids out there.
Don't reach for your wallet.
So if you get pulled over for a speeding violation of the cops let me see your license and registration.
Don't reach in your pocket for your wallet because you might be reaching for your peace.

Above a sidewalk
Here's a claro
After all of my hit record, all that my god ever said was,
So take back to find the job, when you get back from being a slum,
Yes, find that.
Give them at all.
A big foul.
You think at all?
Yes, we all try.
Use this fist, he says to put those kinds of cosmic rods,
And those bitches who are there for long.
Come on, hide in your plunder there.
Say you're today standing over there for long.
But in all seriousness, I was saying we'd have to put those on my chest.
Come on, shut up. You're fucked at a little retard.
Come on, hide.
As you never walk along.
It's one of five sixty WQM, get out of here, Jerry.
Okay, and take your kids with you while you're at it.
Five, six, seven, oh five sixty.
So panel log, we just had somebody call in a vet, a dog person, somebody.
And we're on the phone right now.
Georgia's on the phone as we speak.
I'm going to give me some panel log and I'm going to go home and shovel just gallons of it in my dogs.
Here's an in the see how it works out.
Five, six, seven, oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T line.
Here's a mobile in Miramar. Hello.
Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir.
What's up with these pig, Neil?
These teag...
What is it, sir?
What's up with these teag the New York, Neil?
They out to get us.
Five, six, seven, oh five sixty pound five sixty on a moon, moon, moon, moon line.
Anybody in town from out of town, by the way, I hope you understand that everything you're on a show is an accurate and very accurate and a student reflection of what this town is all about.
Everybody know that, don't you?
Please, please understand that. Please absorb it.
Don't ever forget it.
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello.
Mobile in Fort Lauderdale.
Yeah, hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I got cut off. I was talking to you a few minutes ago.
Any of that, I was...
You got cut off. You got turned into somebody else.
Yeah, well, I lost it on this end, but I wanted to touch base with the old people.
And some of your people would call in.
And of course, you've made the same comment too.
That you're sick and tired of them.
I didn't send sick and tired of old people.
I said there are too many crabby old old people in this area.
The demographic here is lopsided.
Well, it is. There's no question they came down here.
You know, but God.
Yeah, I mean, what are you going to do with them?
Well, here's your guy. Just set a record.
And only this time, somebody else didn't come on.
You know, this is too much today.
This is more than any one person should have to endure.
Let's get some food from Tonys in here.
Let's get a bunch of pizzas.
No salad, no meat and cheese, just a bunch of nice pepperoni pizzas.
And I'll just scrape all the good stuff.
I'll scrape the cheese off the top.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless lights.
See, it's America, sir.
You can't say Schmidt on a radio.
Don't you understand that?
No, you get it.
It's America.
You can't say it.
You can take one.
You just can't say it.
Maybe you can take one.
Are you still allowed to take one?
No.
No, just hold it.
Here's sunrise. Hello.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Yes.
How are you doing this morning?
Okay.
Best I can.
Yeah.
And this morning, you probably do them better.
Nice morning.
I've sent my wife over to the Macarena.
She asked her to pick up tickets for the game tonight.
Once she'd come home with, Tina Turner tickets.
Why does that?
Because she was going to get her tickets, but she forgot mine.
Oh, son, she just got the Tina Turner tickets.
No, I went back and I'm going to get the Panther pack sold out.
That's f***ing bitch.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Any chance I could get tickets for tonight?
Yeah, they got a lot of the 5,000 seats to get right back over there.
She had a lot of tickets.
5,6705,60, 05,60.
One good thing about this show, at least this audience is consistent.
Yeah.
Picking right off where we left off last Thursday and Friday.
Don't let a weekend get in the way of these vases.
They ain't nothing will stop them.
Let's see.
What is this saying?
If you're stopped by a Fort Myers cop, if you're white, just say,
how do you officer?
I'm on my way to the clan meeting.
If you're black or Hispanic, stay out of Lee County.
There you go.
I'm going to go to a little warning for you.
If you're black or a fixed out of Lee County or else,
or else they give you the official Lee County greeting,
which sounds something like that.
So basically, generally speaking, the cops are always in the right
and these other people they can do no wrong.
5,6705,60, 05,60.
On the AT&T wireless line, or as John McCain would say,
those gooks can do no wrong.
Isn't that what he said?
Something like that?
Uh-huh.
By the way, speaking of that since nobody seems to care,
George W.
He picked up some real big stuff over the weekend.
He got what?
Half a delegate somewhere in a Virgin Islands and the territories
and all the ships that see.
And a special hold of the servicemen, whatever that was,
caused the human use to say.
George W picked up more than two dozen delegates
to the Republican National Convention.
You know, this man is so dumb, it's scary.
Did you see him when they cornered him on the thing
about interracial dating and his appearance at Bob Jones University?
He couldn't.
He tried to clarify it and he kept getting wrong.
No, I'm a post-interracial dating and what he was trying
to say was he was opposed to their position,
but he couldn't say it.
Or maybe he just couldn't bring himself to say it.
One or the other.
And he just kept just stepping all over his tongue.
He couldn't be speaking this man.

George is not when he did not let me try.
Go ahead.
What's the republic in shape?
It is a ten to six in the same page.
He said he's going to have to take.
He said he will never play with cocaine.
George is not when he did not let me try.
Go ahead.
11.45 at 5.60 W.C.M.
They got a thumbnail sketch of the four officers involved in shooting into Bronx.
Edward McMillan, 27, has been on the four six years.
He hung loaded.
15 shots.
He's had five civilian complaints alleging excessive force abuse of authority and racial insensitivity.
All deemed unsubstantiated by department officials.
Sean Carroll 37.
Three civilian complaints against them.
We're all deemed unsubstantiated.
Kenneth Boss, the boss.
Three civilian complaints alleging excessive use of force.
We're all deemed unsubstantiated.
So you have pattern developing there.
Richard Murphy 27.
He had no prior shooting incidents or civilian complaints in four times.
I mentioned that in passing.
It's interesting so far.
All the calls that we've had, the one young lady who obviously sounded to me like she might have been a little dark-complexed.
Here's a racial thing again.
It's okay for black people to get shot at.
41 times.
I wonder if there's anybody in this audience who's called to give me this big pseudo intellectual condoning of the police action.
I wonder if it would have been somebody in their family white darker or in between what the hell they would have said.
Or somebody that they knew who never stole a freight train and never raped anybody.
Well, my family member wouldn't have been a black South African West African.
And he certainly wouldn't have assumed that combat position.
Here's a call in Chicago. Hello.
Hey, how you doing?
Yes, you're great.
Yeah, the cops should hang.
I mean, there's no reason why this should happen that they go away.
But you know that nobody gets abused by cops in Chicago for quite a while.
Yeah, right.
I mean, I've been there.
That's an understanding.
Yeah.
But, you know, the OJ thing, I mean, he's banned from society essentially.
What I'm concerned about is this ramsy deal.
How these two can just float off with nothing.
Well, I think the reason being that the ineptitude of the investigation was so grotesque and in the first hours following the murder,
they allowed the evidence to be contaminated so badly that they're never, they're never going to convict anybody.
And they just get you with a whole grand jury thing and they're promising us this and that and no indictments.
No, nothing. And life goes on. They're never going to nail anybody.
I guess we just got to watch our back.
Yeah, there you go. And watch patchy too while you're at it.
Take care.
Okay.
Yeah, I think, yeah, I think that if mommy, all you little kids out there, if mommy comes home with a bunch of duct tape from the store,
what else was it that she got to duct tape and something else?
The cord.
And the cord, yeah.
Let me show you what kind of like tied that on the billi-cord back again.
That might have been, huh?
That might have been something.
Maybe she wanted to do macro.
And I want you to stop and think about this scenario.
Okay.
We got these people that have planned this kidnapping.
This was supposed to be not a rape, not a murder.
This was a kidnapping.
They go into the house.
They find a way in the house while the parents are still in there, by the way, because she was never in there alone.
And they and they borrow a pad, a pad and a pen.
Patsy's notepads and they write the ransom note.
And they just happen to know the amount of John Ramsay's bonus that they asked for the ransom, 118,000.
Is there anybody with an IQ larger than, then, who believes this craft?
No.
No.
I say just to be on the safe side, probably both their asses.
What I say is, let's try both their asses just to make sure we get the right one.
Because whichever one didn't do it has been covered up for the other one anyway.
Or maybe they both done it.
Maybe he was doing the rape and maybe he was doing the strangling and masking and whatever else was going on.
560, 560, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's a lady in Margate. Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes. I want to let you know, I don't agree with the verdict in the yellow case.
Yeah.
I just heard on TV that the defense expert who said the police follow proper procedure was never cross-examined by the prosecution.
Why is that?
I don't know.
They thought he should have been cross-examined.
Because maybe they didn't follow proper procedures, but they never cross-examined them to find out.
Nice.
Anyhow, I'm from Albany myself.
And I thought those people up there would get it right.
But, lo and behold, they came out with that verdict.
And they had four black people on a jury.
They had black people, yes.
It's amazing.
It's really amazing.
Maybe Regis brought in the bag of money or something.
Okay, have a great day, sweetheart.
Good to see you.
Bye-bye.
See you in connected.
No.
560, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T line.
They took fighting out of hockey.
Would you still go to the game?
No.
No.
Not down here.
They took the big black number eight away from the team.
Would you still go?
No.
No.
See, I love hockey because it's a fast game because it's exciting.
The speed, the skill, the passing, the scoring, the great saves, the breakaway, the penalty shot.
That's what makes it exciting.
Not the stupid fights.
And we got people talking about the Martin McSorley-Dommel-Bershire episode who never heard of either one of them.
And everybody's got a goddamn opinion.
But like a lot of intelligent, rational people have said if the violence weren't permitted and even condoned in the first place, then stuff like this wouldn't happen.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Good morning, Neil.
How are you?
Okay.
I'm a black male.
I'd like to make a comment on shooting in New York.
Going back to the declaration of independent, it starts out with a quote as I went in the course of human events.
Yes.
Blah blah blah.
I think the only thing I think that would rectify it is that the cops themselves were taken out.
And taken out of me just like the kid was.
Yeah, who's going to do that?
Well, I would hope society would.
Society is going to shoot the cops.
I would hope so.
In other words, you believe in the vigilante justice.
Is that what you're recommending, sir?
No, sir.
Then how does that happen?
Who's going to do it?
We're going to appoint a committee.
Is that how it works?
I'll make a difference.
Something new in novel.
I've never quite heard this one before.
I must have missed that part of the declaration of independence.
Well, that's why I made reference to it.
A lot of people know it's there.
They don't read it.
They know what's there.
What says, take the justice into your own hand if you don't like the verdict in the trial and go out and shoot the cops.
What part of the declaration of independence is that?
That is exactly what it says, sir.
That's exactly what it says.
Okay.
Let's get a copy of it, George, and read it.
He said that's exactly what he just said.
That's exactly what it says.
And he said that.
Yeah.
Says when you don't like the verdict, just like the OJ thing.
Oh, I should ask him about OJ, too.
Let's take care of that one first.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
You see, this is very tragic because this is also part of the American way.
It shouldn't make a guy that had been a difference.
What color this guy's skin was where he came from.
Shouldn't mean anything to anybody.
But so far, all of the people on the one side, except the nice lady that called a couple of calls ago, all the other people, all the men, all the macho men, they're all for the cops, except we had one young black lady who was upset by the burden.
And then we got this black guy who wants to invoke the declaration of independence, the clause there where it says, if you don't like it, blow their brains out.
Okay.
If they did a quit, then they're full of Schmidt.
Whatever color of the thing goes, and that what it says is if they did a quit, then they're all full of Schmidt.
Yeah.
Woo!
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.
You know what? We're calling off this year's presidential election. I'm taking over.
Oh, come on.
That's right. That's the only hope you got, Moa. I'm boys and girls. I'll take it at that right now.
The only hope you got.
I'd be taking over right now.
It's going to be real interesting to see what I get to Eric Faxes over the first numbers from our poll today.
You agree with the inocuity verdict of the four New York cops?
Yes or no? Very simple. Yes, I know. If you agree, if you think that it was the right verdict, you say yes.
If you disagree, if you think maybe they should have at least a slap on a wrist.
At least they suspended a sentence, something, something.
Here's color red, yellow.
Come the ridge.
Hey, Neil, how you doing today?
Okay.
Great. Good morning to you.
And back to you.
George Rool's Neal's God.
Yeah.
Sorry, you know, there's a poetry contest over the weekend.
And it involved a Harvard Yale gentleman and a Tennessee Redneck.
And Eric, he's given the same word and he had two minutes to come up with this poem.
And the winner, of course, would be the winner.
And the Harvard Yale guy went first and the word was Kim Buck too.
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.
Now, now that was beautiful. I just punched up the mobile in Miami and our phone system just made them disappear.
Don't blame me. You could just hear it. You hear it get yanked just like that.
You see, you guys in this building, bluff Lindsay and Greg Reed and Bob, the most oldies, other beastly people,
you can keep howling about Bell Sof all you want.
Like I said, there's other options.
If Bell Sof can't provide a phone system in this room that works, there's a Zenny and other options.
We've had people that have begged to come in here for free, put in their own phone system from their company.
One that actually works with fiber optic connections with crystal queer connections.
And this place is like, like they're in suspended animation. These people, they can't get off the goddamn dime.
Here's Miramar. Hello.
Miramar. Hello. Yes, sir.
I'd like to make a couple of comments about the thing in New York.
I am totally disgusted with the police there.
I understand from a couple of reports that I've heard on today's show that this guy had five bullet holes on the bottom of his shoes.
Right. And the bottom after he was done, he kept on shooting.
They kept on shooting. Right.
Now, let me tell you something. If that would have happened down here, I think that the people down here would have rioted.
And that I don't think that the people are very, what's the word for you don't give a damn about?
You know how they're in different conditions?
Or maybe conditions.
And they don't care.
I remember liking the Rodney King thing.
I don't agree with you. I think they just had too many incidents of racial violence in New York already.
And even the national like Al Sharpton is warning them, don't come out there and start up because that's not going to solve anything.
That's not the way we're going to get to the bottom of this.
But what about what about the mayor?
Doesn't he have anything to say about anything?
What do you mean nothing to have to say? The mayor is a fascist. The mayor supports it.
The mayor said that Jerry did a good job. He gave us apologies to the family.
And he said, but nevertheless, we support the constant of the right thing.
Oh, they did the right thing.
The mayor is a Nazi, sir. Don't you understand that?
Yes, I do.
The mayor is a card carrying fascist.
I understand that.
I understand that.
Lots to be a member of the U.S. Senate, by the way.
Have any of your listeners watching today show this morning with the eight jurors that were on this morning?
I don't know.
They are more on this.
And you know what they had to say?
They listened to what the judges and structures were to say.
And the judges and structures were to say to put yourself in the cops position.
What about this poor bastard decision to walk out of this apartment and just be there and try to give them my ID before they blew away?
What about him?
Yeah.
What about him?
Well, I don't like him.
Different stem now, I guess, because he's dead.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Here's the first results from our point.
You're going to, well, it's at least a little better than the poll I saw on the road runner thing.
Our poll question today on neo-rodges.com.
And how come there's only 60 votes, by the way?
What's the story?
Is this audience?
Have they all died?
Is that what it is?
Oh, Jesus.
I think that that thing we saw on Saturday at the Indian place.
I think that was a, that's going to give us a big message.
60 votes?
By noon, two hours we got a whole 60 people that have made the effort to voice an opinion on this.
That's been the number one story in the news.
All Goddamn weekend long.
At any rate, well, do it after the break.
Three minutes before noon at 560 WQS.
A neo-rodges show.
Sports radio.
560.
QA.
And.
WQA.
And.
I am the only daughter of the devil.
I don't have to grow up.
I'm a gunner of kids.
So I can always feel myself for something that I did.
It's going to be cool when I kill everyone at school.
So if my dad said it's okay.
I'll exercise my rights.
That's why we have R.A.
That lets me be a gunner of kids.
In the guns are us kids.
I told them how to shoot.
What he really loves to sound of.
What? No way that can't be cute.
I'm a harmless title.
Nazi redneck.
With the size down the internet.
I'm a lifetime number of the NRA.
That's why I raise a gunzer of kids.
Here son.
Oh boy, it's like a gun.
I'm glad that you're a gunzer.
That's the American way.
Okay, 1202 at 560 WQA.
You see this wasn't a serial murderer they were looking for.
A serial rapist.
So I guess maybe instead of if he would have.
Instead of pulling out as well.
If he would have pulled out his.
Yeah.
Then it could said, oh yeah, that's the guy.
And then it could.
Pull him away.
Anyway, here's our poll results so far.
60 votes in two hours.
And we're not in the air.
Maybe that explains it.
Wait till we go on the air.
Do you agree with the not guilty birth of the New York City cops so far?
Yes 25 41.6% no 35 58.3% 60 votes.
A little bit too close for me.
That too close.
And like I said, the one on the road run around this to their national poll was even Steven.
I think the yeses were like a little bit ahead as far as agreeing with the verdict.
Not that I want to put any ideas in your head or manipulate will wait you say.
Okay, especially after you read that part of the Constitution or the Declaration of Independence or the Louisiana Purchase whatever the hell I was talking about.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Mira.
I think it sound like the devil's advocate for the cops over there in New County.
But I'm a young black male and I got to tell you those guys run circles around the cops over here.
Yeah.
I travel back and forth over the Naples and here like every other weekend and one weekend I was really testing the cops was going like a hundred miles now on the trail.
One of those cops over there in Lee County, over a drop off of windows because I have dark pants and was really dark over there.
So I'm dark and tight.
Right.
A lot of darkness going on.
Yeah.
Make sure I have your song.
I am also have a good weapons for me.
I have like two guns and a vehicle.
So I kept both hands on the steering wheel to maintain a nice length for popular.
I'm legally carrying two people to the weapon.
In brother asked me where they were and did not say what what type they were continuing with the process.
I think for my driver's license registration.
Yeah.
For sure.
So anyhow, I've been talking to a guy like five minutes of conversation.
There's let me off with the warnings.
Mind you after a hundred miles an hour and two guns.
They said, hey, have a nice day.
You know, okay.
So now, same incident coming up and coconut growth my life is Hispanic.
Yeah.
I was doing the speed limit on US one.
Right.
Maybe like 35, 40 miles an hour.
And I started to caught the left hand side of the road with its guns.
I wasn't ready for it because I wasn't speeding.
I looked up the letters you may see him coming down behind me.
He tried to play again with me.
He stayed in the middle of the hand.
He came over and he pulled me.
Same thing.
I dropped off one window and checked hands to attend and told him, you know, I have a concealed weapon on me.
He told me if you touch it, I'll blow your ass in hell.
Get out of the car, make me scratch them.
You know, the whole nine yards like if I had just killed ten.
Yeah.
So again, I hate to be the devil's advocate for those guys.
Okay, well, let's see.
I'll see you.
I'll see him for Myers.
There you go.
I got one.
Can you play snow in eight miles from me?
All right.
All right.
Okay, slow down, pal.
Slow down.
Here's your guy that's got way say 15 concealed weapons.
Sorry, he's going 120 miles an hour.
What else wrong with you, Poli?
Anyway, five six seven oh five 60 pond five 60 on the AT and T lie.
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Hey, I don't know where to start with this.
Right.
A big thing.
The problem is as far as I see is no accountability.
It's the same thing when you work for the city, the county, the state.
They can get complained.
It doesn't matter that they're not fined.
If anything, they're on, we've used on duty with pay.
And does this happen anywhere else in the world?
Any other country?
And I watched part of that on court TV.
Yeah.
I got mixed up.
I thought the prosecutor was one of the defense attorneys.
Just by the questions he wasn't asking.
Nothing pointed.
Nothing that rattled.
Anyone on the stand?
Yeah.
Maybe he knows Chris Darden and Marcer Clark.
And we were laughing at that other guy, but what if the shoe was on the other foot?
Well, what if it was for citizens who shot a cop?
Or as he was reaching for his bandage?
Well, let me ask you this.
What about it if it would have been for black cops?
And while the victim would have been white?
You think that the people calling they would have had the same opinion?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know if it's a black-and-white thing.
I don't know.
You know, I shouldn't be.
But there's no question that it is.
You can just, just by the few calls we've had about it here today on this show, it obviously is.
I do know they have too much authority.
And not enough accountability.
OK.
And say hi to those cops with that 10-year-old prostitute down there in Kendall while you're at it.
Hear any more about that over the weekend?
No.
It's only the 28th of February.
By the way, in two days it'll be March 1, 2000.
Are we ever going to hear any more about that?
No.
No, we're not going to hear any more about that because it was a cops that done it and they swept it under the carpet.
If you guys go out there and you're having sex with, if you're set up a goddamn horror ring with some 16-year-old girl,
even if you're 19 years old and you're having sex with a 16-year-old girl,
it's statutory rape, you're going to go to jail.
And here we had a bunch of cops setting up a prostitution ring in Goody Tushu, South Florida,
America where prostitution is illegal except in one county in Nevada out there.
And our local news media with a big song to dance for about two days until they got tired of it
and decided that we want to hear more about God damn John Bonet who's been dead for she ain't even like Luke Warmer anymore.
Maybe Luke done it.
Now seriously, have we ever heard one more word about this?
No.
No.
Because it would be too embarrassing to do many cops and too many law enforcement agencies in the state of the county
so as a result certain individuals managed to sweep this out of the carpet
and certain brilliant journalists in this town have managed conveniently to forget all about it.
The prostitution ring with minors and their best customers were porkers,
do one to others, how does that thing go?
Screw one to others?
Don't bring screw-in to this place, he's got enough on her hands.
Nine minutes past noon at 560 WQ.
I don't give a sh** anymore.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome the two newest New York Yankees.
Darrell Strawberry, I'm Dr. Gooden,
and their personal coach Steve Howell.
Howell, that's what I'd like to know.
That goodens in the wind up, the straw man snort the line up,
he's ruined like a dog who heard a bell.
He's high as a lab rat for smoking the cracket of that.
He does in like cocaine just like the way it smells.
Snort an A ball,
Sarrows roll enough for plenty, Snort an A ball,
and he's given good and plenty.
They lick the 20 dollar bill.
Their teeth are grindin' like a peppermill.
Doin' A ball,
out the hole and pills.
He's in the stuff.
Steve Howell is in the bullpen.
His nostrils are wide open,
he's no f***** up beating, he's on the braids.
He gets advice from Doc,
and Doc prescribed some rock.
The first he blew a line and then he blew the safe.
Snort an A ball,
they abused the magic powder Snort an A ball,
sprinkle it on their clam chowder.
Prescription's got the pet you will refill.
They do it in the pool if they had gills.
Doin' A ball,
out the hole and pills.
All that money.
A ball,
out the hole and pills.
I like a welcome you all aboard.
It's your manager.
High five.
21560 WQA and 567-0560,
pound five 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
The officer said the five foot 650 pound
the yellow darted into the dimly lit entrance
of his building into a black object that looked like a gun.
Boss recalled that the yellow was in a combat stance.
The officer said they feared for their lives
and opened fire.
Carol and McClellan,
the McMellan, whatever the hell's name is,
the first to shoot, emptied their 16 shot gun.
Boss fired five times in Murphy for
while backing up their partners.
Carol wept on a stand while recalling the shock of realizing
the black object was just a wall that I said,
where's the effing gun?
In closing arguments,
prosecutor Eric Warner told jurors the yellow never stood a chance.
After the officers made a snap judgment that he was a suspect
looking in a bad neighborhood,
a corner intensified that most of the bullets probably stuck the yellow
as he was falling or while he was flat on his back.
Although one witness said she heard an officer shout gun
before the shooting,
several prosecution year witnesses testified.
They'd never heard the officers' voices before the gunfire started.
Alrive.
Here's a lady mobile in Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hello.
She's got the radio up and then nothing to waste to kill a freight train.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, man.
Hi.
Yes, I am.
Hi, who are you?
I'm a 20 year old white female and I have an opinion about the thing going on in New York.
Yes.
I believe that it's about race.
I mean, people are making it all about race,
but it's about human life and the loss of the human life.
Yeah.
And I believe black, white, purple or pink,
these men should be sitting in prison.
Regardless of what color they are,
because if it was white police officers that shot a white man,
I don't believe that the black community would be so outraged about it.
Of course not.
But I just believe that it's about losing a human life.
Right.
And point blank.
You know, if it was the black officers that shot a black man,
then it would not be okay.
But if it was white officers that shot a white man,
then the black community would say,
okay, it's okay, brush it under the right gear, right?
That's my opinion about it.
Okay.
I think they should be sitting in prison right now.
Having right there, okay.
Does anybody know what she just said?
No.
I can't figure it out.
But anyway, just like OJ and the two white victims see the same thing,
strictly racial.
The only people who would love to defend OJB said the few assholes in this building are black folks.
Some of them very small minority, I think, at this point.
And then of course they're the black folks who say,
okay, well, we know he did it, but now it's one for our side, you know,
because we've been getting screwed so long.
As if somehow we have a whole series of these.
We're going to look like a contest to see if we can't even it up.
Is that what it's all about?
Uh-huh.
And a bottom line is you live in a country,
and I've been telling you this for years where human life is as cheap as stepping on a cockroach.
So what's everybody all been out of shape?
Well, I think about it.
And more people killed here in one hour in this country than in some civilized countries in a whole year.
Well, you know, that's just the way it is, okay?
Go someplace else, screw you, Neil.
Go someplace else.
Okay.
Thank you.
5, 6, 7, they never called back with my, uh, your stuff.
I'll call them to the next break.
Oh, boy.
What's what's the code again?
Community panel.
Oh, not the play.
Oh, the name of the place.
Panel.
I keep repeating that because maybe somebody will come by here with a few tubes over the bunch of pizzas instead,
which would be even better for that.
Because who wants panel log for lunch?
Anybody want panel log for lunch?
No, but if we had a bunch of pizzas from my Tony's from our good friend Brad and our delivery guy that just brought him into doors, I spoke.
That would be a good shake.
And we could do the scatkins again today.
See the other thing I'm doing well on that other diet to 2030.
But the only problem is my blood sugar is sky high because I'm eating pasta again and the things that you're supposed to eat on that diet.
And my blood sugar was like too high, not good.
Not good.
Can you hear it?
Uh-huh.
Yeah, it's gurgling.
So I'll do weekends for a couple hours today, I think.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the 18 tail.
And then of course, we got the big hockey game tonight where you can do the Wayne Heizinga diet.
So overpriced and so bad.
You would need any of it in the first place.
Maybe a little diet soda.
Although I will confess I had the onion rings Saturday.
And it worked that bad.
In that bad, I'm confessing that I, uh-huh.
Because I cannot tell a line unless there's something that informed me.
They weren't that bad.
So if you must eat something at the macarena, get you the onion rings in the soda and 20 or 30 beers and you'll feel great.
Here's a mobile and four-letteredale.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
There's two things that disturb me about this case.
First of all, you know, I guess it's a public gun in general consensus that it's two-nose shots.
Concephalus is what?
41 shots.
Yeah.
And 19 hits.
Yeah.
Why, um-
Even their old strawberry never had that many.
What, what did they, um, approach him initially?
Because they thought they, he looked, he looked at the description of the suspected serial rapist.
So why didn't they just rush him and, um, you know, banging down?
Why didn't four, four against one?
Why didn't they rush him and banging down?
How's they thought he was pulling the gun?
No.
I mean, he even got four guys against one.
Listen, you don't have to debate with me.
I agree with you.
And all these vozos defending it say, oh no, well, you know, they're not trained to do that.
Once they start shooting, they're going to kill you.
Which I don't, I don't understand that.
But you know, I'll tell you, you know, in case of a police,
uh, uh, uh, uh, protocol, you, uh, just like in a justice system,
you're innocent and proving, interproving guilty.
Yeah.
And you think, you feel like these guys would have surrounded this individual.
And, um, they would have had the upper hand.
And if this guy would have, uh, uh, win in, in this pocket and, uh,
uh, present any type of weapon they could have rubs to, um, to do with him.
How, how, how are they?
Why did they, how, wait a minute, you said they could have to do them.
How?
You see how four guys against one?
Yeah.
It couldn't have to do with him.
You mean you take four white men to, uh,
what, what, what's everything to make whether they were white?
Well, they never do that first.
What, what's everything to make that they were white?
What do you mean to tell me that you can't get four guys to, to do one, one, one,
one, but you keep using the word subdued.
What does that mean?
You suggest that they rushed him.
And if it turned out that it was a gun, he would have blown one or two away.
And they thought in fact that he was, uh, uh, uh, perpetrated.
And he did the crime that he just rushed him in, in grounded.
And then talk about it later.
What, what do you mean, you mean, you mean before he pulled out the wallets?
No.
If they, if they thought this guy was involved, they didn't kind of cry.
They should have rushed him in grounded.
So, so, so, so, so, those guys just rushed it.
So, in other words, if somebody sees you walking out of street and they confuse you with a
suspect, I would move it and being killed.
Yeah, a good point.
Excellent.
Good point.
That is a good point.
You know what?
Okay, calm down, sir.
I want to get stressed out while I'm meeting here.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 0, 5, 60.
Because once you get stressed out that old, IBS starts up again, which knock on wood.
Knock on wood, boy.
Since I had my nice vacation here, I've been doing pretty good.
Knock on wood.
It just is very, very incredibly disturbing to me that in the end,
and again, the guy had a good point there at the end.
At least if they rushed in, shrew you down before he had a chance to reach for anything.
Even if you're not the guy, at least they're not going to blow you away by accident because they overreact.
But again, keep in mind, and I'm not, I'm not saying I necessarily agree because I don't know.
I don't live in New York.
Thank God.
Although I do live here, so I'll go through show you.
It says these four police officers allegedly, allegedly,
were being excessive because they cracked down on crime by frisking,
frisking young, stopping and frisking young black men without cause.
So in other words, just because you were young black guy, they would stop you and frisky.
If you look dangerous, if you look like something that they didn't like,
and of course all four of these guys happen to be white.
It's not working, folks.
It's not working.
The racial experiment in America, it ain't working.
Got news for you.
How about if we just split up the state?
Okay, sounds that sound.
Okay, South Carolina.
Let the crackers have Georgian South Carolina.
Here's a mobile in four-letter mail.
Hello.
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
Okay, sir.
Neil, I got a couple things I want to talk about.
The first thing was, yeah, these cops,
and the police nowadays are, excuse me, they're out of control.
They really are.
I mean, it seems like it's more harassment than anything else in that phase with the police.
I mean, they fit there on load on that guy like that.
I mean, you can just put it together like you're doing.
I mean, I'm not going to tell you that there is a definitely wrong.
The other thing I want to talk about is, I like Peter Warwick.
And I like it when it gets out there and starts fighting.
Peter Warwick?
No, I mean, Peter Warwick for the...
What's his name?
I thought Peter Warwick was a football player.
What's his last name?
Peter.
Peter, Peter, get out of here.
56670560, pound 560.
I mean, I'll be glad to talk about it with you and whatever your opinion is.
But if you don't even know the guy's name, then what kind of conversation can we have?
You know what I'm saying?
Like that?
Any real hockey fans out there, what you just heard is a classic example of hockey knowledge here in South Florida.
Peter Warwick.
And let me ask you this.
Is Warwick done?
And what that kind of a name is that?
Anyway, I know Dion Warwick.
You think she'd be kind to them?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
And how about that Derek Thomas in those seven kids by five different women he had?
Or you want to make another urology?
Is that what it is?
26 past noon at 560WQM.
The Florida Panthers live here.
This is Keith Ford!
The Panthers!
This is Keith Ford!
This is Keith Ford!
Sports radio, 560.
QAM.
Well, I've never thought I'd find because I know right that I need to give around these two days.
Now, it's a classic set of wheels fixed up the way a brother would try to kill him.
Now, with the cleanly chotted and the drippest cold and the dyes of the my seat, I got some kinda liquid cherry yokes.
Oh, baby.
With the crudal of Derek, I'll be baby grease.
Oh, baby.
Shiny, middle-filled, middle-sped, and deep-diffrous suspension.
Now, it's the one-pounce down the road in a bit.
That is super-now-a-use.
Now, with the hotest top-poked geels a day, I'll get around the peaks of the craigs.
By 1979, my phone got a little bit on her.
She's so looking-right now, it's my baby cat-a-legged.
Oh, baby.
Quarker-na-cozada-jelly cherry-up-y baby grease.
Oh, baby.
Shiny, middle-filled, middle-sped, middle-sped, and deep-diffrous suspension.
I've got a window down on the hot summer day, cause the AC don't work no way.
This wedding crash with our seats starts to smell and gets the dust that you were getting over time.
On my back, I see you find that shiny grand as well like live, like my coffee-channel,
that you've been having washing it with on the road.
Da-ha-ha-be-he-be.
Quarker-na-cozada-jelly cherry-up-y baby grease.
Da-ha-be-he.
Michael Schaffek-Hill's rolling both his feet off, saying, from school.
Da-ha-be-he.
Freshman's all-in-tiering of the facet of the baby grease.
Da-ha-be-he.
Oh, wow.
And 560 WQM.
I'll tell you this thing we're dealing with is pull on the website.
This is great.
It's given me a whole new insight as to what it's all about.
Of course, I've always told you about the ASSUSKIN that goes on.
But Eric faxes me the newest results, which all of a sudden after I chewed about a half an hour ago,
the result is double.
From 60 to 120.
But he points out the votes were even until 11 o'clock when you gave your opinion afterward
the no votes took to leave.
And didn't I tell you the one on the road runner thing there was like even Steven, like maybe a point apart.
But now, because he ever understand that, we know they're anonymous.
What's the point of sucking around on the website?
Did it make me feel better as that?
It's just like last week.
And over the weekend, there were more facts in the audience over to, you know, until all these other people came on.
But while I was on the air like 14% of more like a limperist.
And then over the weekend all of a sudden it was going down and the tally too.
Yeah, everybody was going down, right?
Uh-huh.
We got 120 votes.
Do you agree with the not guilty verdict of the New York City cops?
46, which is 38.3% and 74 say 61.5%.
And of course this can't possibly be a black and white thing on our website because are black people allowed on the internet?
No.
Not yet, I don't think.
Huh?
Al Gore's working on that.
But I don't think what?
What do you laugh at about?
Black people aren't allowed to vote on these polls, are they?
No.
No way, Jose.
Here's a mobile-invoting B.
Hello?
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I just want to make a comment on what you've been talking about.
You know, this was a human being.
It doesn't matter if he's white, black, purple, green, it doesn't matter.
They shot at this guy 41 times.
He's been trying to time by the time the third bullet went off.
It already severed his spine.
Uh-huh.
Two guys empty 16 out of two guys.
One says it's five shots.
The other takes four shots.
Right.
I mean, does there's any rational person in this world can figure, can justify even if their lives were endangered?
Yeah.
What's the next point?
What would be their defense to say?
We have to see another 30 bullets in the hole.
The one defense was this guy that called earlier in the show.
I don't know if you heard it was talking about the kind of bullets.
These nine millimeter bullets that they're shooting.
And he's saying that, you know, they're not like the hollow points and like blow a hole when they go in.
He says that you can shoot somebody three, four times with these and they're still standing.
Well, this guy wasn't still standing.
You see, but don't confuse that guy with the facts.
Most of the shots hit him.
I don't know.
He's either as he was on the way down already already down.
Exactly.
I mean, it gets to the point.
I mean, this is just this is such an outrage.
How anybody could even, I mean, I know it's hard to be a cop and I know it's tough and they're lying on the line.
But anybody in their way, Mike, he justifies their actions.
It's hard to believe in it has no bearing what color the guy was.
It's a matter of fact that they just went, they just went way too far.
They killed an innocent man.
The guy never had a chance.
He was already half dead before he hit the ground.
And keep it my, keep it my, these guys weren't in uniform.
These were playing close guys.
So if he was acting a little bit peculiar, I think you can understand that.
I mean, the guy's just going into his apartment house.
He's just walking down the street.
His English wasn't that good.
Right.
He was only in the country a little while.
It's just ridiculous for any, any rational person to even justify any kind of act like that.
I agree with you.
I mean, shocked that when I looked at that pool last night on the roadrun or on the internet,
and I saw that it was even and the people agreed were not even a little bit ahead,
I couldn't believe it.
And then I'm here in this morning.
All these people making excuses is how this was acceptable.
It's just an average.
My wife happens to work in law enforcement with DEA and the FBI and she's just in shock.
It's just mind-boggling how they could destroy a man's life, kill this guy.
He didn't do a thing wrong.
There's no accountability.
They went like the wild, wild west just kept shooting bullet holes through people's feelings.
They couldn't kill the other people in the supply center.
They didn't care.
They don't care.
Nobody cares.
It's just one life who cares.
The guy was probably going to do something anyway.
I mean, it's just a joke.
It's a travesty.
It's a joke.
Well, he came here to find a man.
He came here to find the American Dream and he found it, man.
Let me tell you something.
They should be and they should be indicted and sent to prison for murder because that's what they did.
They murdered this guy.
Okay.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Hey, man.
There you go.
There's a guy who articulated very well the way I feel about it.
So I won't bother repeating because I'm eating a nice lunch here.
Thanks a lot, Brad.
Tony's pizza.
Had 193.29.
Northwest Second Avenue.
Right up down the street here.
I just, I just can't get over it.
And race does play a part.
There's no question about it.
All you had to do is listen these words to an hour and a half hours of the show and you find out that race plays a part.
But why the hell should it?
The problem being that human life in America is meaningless.
It's like open up your water faucet and every drop of water that comes out.
Oh, there goes another one.
You don't care.
Don't care.
But God forbid if somebody out there is smoking a goddamn number has a pin joint near God damn a straight.
Great to jail.
And of course this is in the same state by the way that they have all those great Rockefeller drug laws in there.
That they send people away for 20 and 30 years mandatory minimum sentence.
Same state that thinks it's okay for cops to go over and deploy your brains out because they think he might look suspicious.
You might have a faint resemblance to somebody that they're looking for.
Here's mentally.
Hello.
Medley.
Hey Neil.
Yes sir.
My name is Ted.
You don't know me.
I'm an old man but I had a lot of experience with dogs infected ears.
Yeah.
And my doctor is looking right across the street from the racetrack.
Highly a racetrack.
No, I don't think we're near there.
Oh no, no, that's a hot guy.
I wouldn't agree if I'm going there.
And I'm telling you this doctor has improved my dog's health here.
And all of those I have had German shepherds.
I had colleagues.
I had the dogs.
Talk a poo.
Yeah, no, right now I have a poo.
Yeah.
He did a wonderful job on him in very quick order.
But yeah, if you want to know his name, it's a wavy animal clinic.
I'm Paul Mavian 32nd.
That's right across from the highly racetrack.
And his name is Dr. Swaringin.
First, you got to understand that they have-
Dr. Swaring?
Swaringin.
Swaringin?
Yes.
And what you have to do is you have to understand.
You have to have the dogs to take a culture.
You put the swab into your tachylin and then you have your animal eyes.
And he knows that it's a staff infection of the yeast.
Yeah.
And they can give you treatment real quick.
Okay, thanks a lot.
Fine.
Thanks, Ted.
Am I going there?
No.
No.

I think it started with Roy.
Need me help?
Your daily dose is right here.
You're happy to eat and then go get your key.
Just swish real good before you leave.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sport radio 560 QA.
Get the hoover out the monmer.
Thank you for attending today's conference on how to deal with the Y2K problems.
I would like to announce the development of a new software system, which will be used
in the year 2000 compliant.
This program is known as millennia year application software system or my app.
Next Monday there will be a meeting in which I will show my app everyone.
We will hold demonstrations throughout the month so that all employees will have an opportunity
to get a good look at my app.
We have not addressed networking aspects yet, so currently only one person at a time can use my app.
This restriction will be removed after my app expands.
Last week my secretary said to me, I'm a little nervous.
I never put anything in my app before.
I helped her through the first time and afterwards she admitted that it was relatively
painless and she was actually looking forward to doing it again and was even ready to kiss my app.
As you begin using the program, feel free to put anything you want in my app.
As my app grows larger, we envision a time when it will be commonplace for a supervisor
to hand work to an employee and say, here, stick this in my app.
It will be a great day when we need data quickly and our employees can respond.
Here it is.
I just pulled it out of my app.
You can kiss my rear end.
El Paso, 1245 at 560 WQM, I got Hank and Chula, I got Geldey on Game Night at 6.

Those Panthers tickets for tonight?
Buffalo Sabers, Dominic Aschick, huh?
Michael Pecker, always going from Buffalo?

Stewie Barnes, don't forget Stewie.
That would be a good thing.
What's the new Barnes number on the Sabers, give away a pair of tickets number 41?
Here's Miami, hello.
Miami.
How are you doing, man?
Okay, sir.
I just thought you might like to know, you're talking about cops with our friends at BSO, we're doing this weekend.
BSO?
Yeah.
Instead of being out in the high-crime areas of Broward.
Right.
They were out in the darkies, right?
They were out in Weston, a wild place.
They were going to go to the safest and boring towns.
We're all the drug petlings going on in Weston.
It is.
We'll get this.
Crossbrings in Weston.
But that's not what they were doing.
Or they doing.
Saturday night at 11 o'clock at night, there's a cop.
In his car with the radar gun, just giving tickets to people who are going by.
Is that ridiculous or what?
11 o'clock on a Saturday night just because people had a few too many.
What's that all about?
No, not even.
They weren't even testing for alcohol.
They were just giving tickets.
I got one for six miles over.
Ticket defense team, man.
Don't pay it.
Don't you dare pay it.
Yeah, I need to get a good lawyer.
No, you ticket defense team.
George, don't give me the number, okay?
All right, thank you.
Hang on.
I'm going to get a lawyer.
Get the ticket.
Okay, you're getting that guy the number.
Whatever you know what the number is.
11741TEAM, whatever that is.
Six miles an hour over the speed limit.
There you go.
You got a pin joint, you're axed right.
You're going six miles an hour over the speed limit.
Your ax is going straight to jail and put your hands on your goddamn ass.
And freeze or I'm going to throw your crap away, okay?
Police state.
Police state.
You can make you can chop it.
You can dissect it.
You can twist it.
You can yank it.
You can hack a trinic about it from now until the other time.
The fact is America is a police state.
How could we have more people behind bars than any other country in the world except China?
China.
They're the only one.
And also, by the way, it's the only country in the world that has capital punishment left in the western world.
And of course China, by the way, is the only one that executes more than we do.
China.
As John McCain would say, those crazy gooks.
How do you like that?
We want to be free just like China, right?
Yeah.
Oh, I know.
I mean, start the thing with capital punishment.
And I waffle on that thing.
I should be eating at the waffle house every time the subject comes up because it's very tough with me because they're all these scumbags.
Well, how can you make an argument for it?
And only three states, by the way, are still using the electric chair.
Nebraska Arkansas.
I think it's one of them.
What's the other one?
I don't know.
And your notice Florida just we just finally got rid of it here.
A little bit late, but better.
Not that I have the option.
What is it?
You get to pick.
You get to pick what you want to sit in like a recliner or a regular sofa or you get the needle.
That's pretty damn wide of them.
You know that governor, Jebster.
Don't come no wider than Jebster.
By the way, Jeb, I wouldn't be planning on no second term or fire where you.
You got the smarts is all whipped up against you now, baby.
And everybody else that thought you were something that you aren't, which, you know, card carrying fascist just like his brother.
Here's coconut creek.
Hello.
Coconut Creek?
Yes, sir.
You know, talking about these police officers and the shooting in New York, their house just like you know.
Couldn't understand, you know, 41 shots.
But you know what was presented to Jeury and what the defense was.
Yeah.
You do?
Well, I'm listening.
Okay.
The first two officers saw this person and that alcohol up there.
Right.
And the car pulled up.
The man off the run, the passenger side gets out, goes up the, going up the stairs.
I imagine he's speaking to him because the second one, the driver is getting out.
The first officer falls backwards, flips, I guess, down the stairs.
He sees the guy with his hand coming out.
Keep in mind that these are playing closed officers.
Right.
They're not uniform, right?
Keep in mind, yes.
The first guy, the driver is getting out.
Now, he had called for backup.
So as he's getting out the driver's side, he sees his partner falling down.
The man coming out of a pocket with a hand, hollers, gun and starts shooting.
The second two come up in the car.
There is already firing going on.
They just come out and start shooting.
That's what was presented to the jury.
And this is where it went to, and this is where the jury said, okay, the guy, the first guy to fire, he thought his partner had been shot.
Now, whether he heard a bang or a file, or what, all he did is saw the man coming back down the stairs, just like he'd been shot.
So he got her gun and started shooting.
And the two guys, the other two guys came up and started shooting because they were already shooting.
So this is what was presented to the jury.
And this is how the end of the verdict they came to.
I agree with you, 41 shots, 19 hits.
But it's a crazy damn scenario.
And I don't know what I would have done if I would have been the guy's partner.
And if I sent on the jury, I don't know what I did.
Now, it's either the truth, or it's one hell of a nice scam.
Well, we're never going to find out from the victim.
Right, yeah.
And, and, and, I don't know if there's witnesses around or what not.
Yes, lots of them.
But, I mean, they had to cooperate some of that that the other, the other backups came in and started firing at the first one.
So I don't know, but I was just like you, you know, 41 shots and one guy.
And he was not on a street. He was up in an alcohol.
Right.
Like a brownstone or whatever they got up there.
And eventually that's where he went. He was going home.
Yeah, and this guy was going.
And he didn't stop. They kept y'all in from the stop.
And they were, they were ununiformed.
Right.
And he didn't stop.
Right. Right.
And to be quite out of the, I don't blame him.
So the other one officer is going up the stairs after him.
And I don't know, you know, he trips, slips or whatever the hell he did.
Yeah.
And comes flying back out in the first, this partner starts shooting.
And he got hit.
So that's all I know about it.
And I can, I can understand the jurors dilemma there too.
And I can understand people, but it's a hell of a shame when somebody just loses his life.
It's something like that.
And particularly when they're, you know, playing coals, you know, and the man is not a national.
You know, he's out of the country doesn't understand probably good English.
Right.
And maybe the guy said ID, give me ID and he's reaching for it.
Right. That's correct.
And so if he hadn't fallen, everything probably would have been alright.
So when he fell, that's when the other one started banging.
So that's all I know about it.
And maybe it'll help somebody out there.
Okay.
Thank you.
Or listen to it.
Thanks.
Right.
So in other words, whether he's trying to say the cup is a little bit unbalanced, that would do the same.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0.5, 60 on the AT&T line out of town.

Here's North Miami Beach.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes.
Are you doing okay, Neil?
Great.
First of all, 41 shots.
19 hits.
That's what they failed.
They ranged test.
Right. That's what I said.
They hit bad aim.
That's why they couldn't shoot the wall out of his hand.
That's the fact.
Does anybody learn anything about the rapist?
I suppose the rapist was was anybody ever found?
Have the rapists stopped?
What's going on with that?
Does anything about that?
Well, of course the rapist wasn't found.
I mean, you know, no.
I don't know.
We don't have any more rapist who now knows in the city like New York,
there's probably so many who knows who's doing it.
Well, actually, that sort of was in particular area.
You know, so we gave them one area, whatever.
That's all I got Neil.
Okay, thanks.
Are we concerned about rapist in New York here in South Florida?
No.
No, not really.
You understand that?

Here's Hollywood. Hello
Hollywood
Judging from all your intelligent informed comments, I might have believed that prior to you being in the radio business
It's you also worked for some law enforcement agency. No
Why is that have you ever been put in the situation such as that?
So in other words if you don't work at law enforcement, you can't have an opinion. You can have an opinion
Yeah, it doesn't sound like a very educational look at the way educational
You mean educated something to them. Oh something that effect. Yeah, maybe I can help it with your grammar
About it. I think I could but anyway, what's the point because you disagree?
Therefore I'm gonna ask is that it? No, I just what is the point?
You need to have some experience before you can jump into making some conclusions
I'm gonna tell you something everybody in everything. It's low. It's your ass. Don't raise your voice to me
I'll spend this is my show as hold you old fossil. Oh, he's the guy who was sitting motionless in the chair of the
Cassino on Saturday
He's the one that they put the dude off the stirrup side next to him
Everybody in America who has heard this story has an opinion on it whether they're in law enforcement out of law enforcement black white purple younger old
And this guy's telling me that before I should have my opinion and start mouth and off on it
I should have some experience. No, thank you. No, thanks
God like I said at the beginning of the show
It's a place where even young people can't have a good time because the old fossils like him
You always tell me that I don't want to say where it was. Okay, one of our fine sponsors
You always tell me that the people have actually died there while like sitting at the tables and
Nobody discovered it for like a period of time

Bob Cunt by by the way, Bob do you ever have a real job? No, it's kind of like Jesse Jackson never had a real job
No, but anyway, he facts me this
Shalom international he's present of this Bob Cunt their motto is oh
But nevertheless, I think he's got a point here. Did you see this thing over the weekend where this Pope this old disgusting Pope of the dress?
The Catholic Church released the statement from the Vatican that Pope pies the 12th was right your main sign that about the holocaust because then they saved all those Jewish lives
How many more people would have died if he would open up a mouth?
Huh, yeah, well this is the response to the book about him that revealed what I got him and never met an oxy didn't like
And the Concordat which we already knew about the most people are too stupid to understand that but at any rate
Well Bob Cunt is being the protest. Well in that case
And the BB that Neon who's gonna be there on that day. Sorry. So it was a secret apparently that there were Jews and Europe and
If nobody had said anything about them nothing would happen. That's right
Don't be knocking pious baby. He was a snappy dresser last time I saw him
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 man what a lovely dress he was under a lot of dress
Here's a lady in cool Carol city hello
Yes, man, no, I'm listening to the mother this morning and she was on one of the
Morning shows the mother of this the ologodica killed it correct and she said her son was left handed and they said he had the wallet and the right hand
And they had eight of the jurors on the lot on the show and two of the blacks that they were afraid they had children
Like if they had on the other way maybe the offices of their friends would have come after that
and
The they also said the judge told them to think like an office and not like the dead man, you know not like the guy that was shot
And I've never moved to Florida if they don't think like a dead man
Right
Not that case and I can understand that the judge told them to put themselves in the office of shoe not into the sky shoe
And they say we did what the judge that's inappropriate. Why no?
That's what they said that's crap. They said they did what the judge told them to do and the prosecutor didn't have a taste and
But I don't know who said they should have
The do him yeah, I guess the only thing they could have done was shoot him in the lake. There you go
That's right. We're telling him all the time
This is the way you do when you got a little problem like this when you're a little bit nervous. Shoot him in the leg right
When did that bring him down?
Shoot him in the leg. Oh
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 you see you can say anything you want the guy thought his partner was shot because he stumbled and fell
Backward because he was a clutz whatever the thing might have been
But the idea that they needed to fire 41 shots and make 19 hits and then most of the hits were as the guy was on a
Way down and also after he was already down and a bunch of shots in the feet
Just stop and think about that
If you look up the word overkill a dictionary you'll see these four cops pictures right next to it
You know I'm a sense, huh?
But don't let me influence your decision
Here's a mobile in Dorao hello Neil hoist. They're okay
First of all
Goliani's not a nasty like you were saying yes, he is no, I'm sorry
And you shouldn't use the work here. I do yourself and you should know what a nasty is and not he's a not
He's a fascist well you're a fascist. You're a racist too. You hate all kinds of people
You hate things you hate your let me say again
We're off to Goliani is a nutty. That is my opinion and you you are one of them too. Yeah, sure
Whatever you say. What's the point? Let's go to the meat of the bad
What you go you're a Canadian Jew. Yeah, I'm Canadian five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT by the way
Say hello to early on for us. Okay, while you're at it
Count five sixty on a AT&T wireless line
Let's take a call from Coral Springs. Hello. Hi. Yes, sir
Is the steel sounds like me any other stuff?
I guess you got one comment about that about that shooting up there. Yes, I think it's a hunter's mentality
meaning I'm meeting that
When you go out hunting
You go towards the shoot
One other shoots. Mm-hmm. Yeah, those are gonna shoot. They are yeah, that's what I'm thinking on that
That's not the main reason I'm calling. Okay
You still there I'm here. I've you have you ever been talking but I'm still here
I do heard a thing yet about the on the internet
Would it start charging to go online
When they're gonna start charging all companies are gonna charge us to go on the internet and
The post office is going to start charge and post it. Well, let me ask you this
How does the phone company gonna charge me to go on the internet when I don't do it over a phone line?
It's gonna be voted in the Congress in about two weeks. Yeah
But you but you don't need the phone company to go online. There's a zing another like the roadrunner
I'm getting do you have cable and also also the post office sure do you have you have cable to you have cable TV
Yes, I do then just say goodbye to the phone company you to the road runner
You get the five hundred times faster service and you don't need to type of phone line
Do we need to be on a phone line to get on the internet? No, no
And they also have those other one. They call those little the small computers not a laptop and the little ones where it
It's strictly for the internet. You know
The ones I'm talking about huh, but yes, but you've seen them
Yes, and you don't need a phone line and that's the whole sales pitch is they don't tie up a phone line and it's always on
Just like the road running you click on the icon and it's within two seconds. There it is and it's always there
In fact, you don't even ever have to sign off of it if you don't want to because you're not using a phone line
But nevertheless don't confuse the sky with the facts because he wants to pick on a phone company
Do we like the phone company? Oh, phone company blows sir the phone company sucks. That's just one more example
Just listen to these phone lines and see there should be a lawsuit in fact
I think if this goes on another couple of weeks and they don't want to do it. I'll have Norma do it
If these people are too chicken to submit to suit the phone company and then they're the ones that are paying for it
They're paying for the service and they're getting like a good swift in the ass
Boy you talk about great business people oops. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that
How's that all it's a eight minutes after one at five sixty double the queue
All right
Copy
Okay. All right.
One 13 at 560 WQM.
Here's the important news of the day.
Well, you're all worried about some poor guy that got shot
19 times with 41 bullets.
Lopez Dress meets and beats laws of physics.
All right. There you go.
And here's this picture of Jennifer Lopez
from the Grammys last week with her like undressed
from Donna Televersa.
Of course.
Everybody in her Saudi is of course has been here
more than a couple years.
Members Gianni Versace.
That damn bag. I can't stand them.
And anyway, it says she went over there to look
for a some piece of crap to wear.
And at the house of Versace, she found a wisp of address.
The floor life gown in Rainforest Green was printed
with lush pattern of palm fronds and tropical leaves.
The gown with its long,
gothsemers leaves plunged several inches below the navel
and was being held together by a spectacular brooch.
All right.
The dress was open below the jewel pin and had a teasing tendency
to blow back and away from Lopez's muscular legs
and big fat ass as she moved.
How do you like that?
Welcome.
Yeah.
See, this is the whole thing with the FCC,
with American General.
And it's another part of this constipated society
that you live in.
You can show boobs on TV.
You cannot show nipples.
That's the difference.
So you can see this.
I mean, is there anything left to the imagination here
in his dress?
No.
No.
Besides the fact that she's, I mean, from the neck down,
okay, I can relate to it.
From the neck up, all I can say is,
here comes lunch again, Jennifer.
But so how come that we don't have a lot more shows showing breasts
and just like, you know, doing a little thing on the nipple?
When most of you guys like to do a little thing on a nipple?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
God, I don't get it.
So is that taken care of, by the way?
So, oh, I got the number.
Oh, that's good.
That's a good start.
And don't take any crap from them.
Tell them I want this stuff and I'm not bringing the dog in.
And I don't want to have to go through another psychotic episode.
And I don't want Dr. West giving me a big song to dance about how he's got
very, very, and left for scene.
He'll be dead any day.
He's doing just great.
All I want is some crap for the ears.
Okay.
They're great people over there.
But boy, they are pitchmen.
And oh, yeah, well, you know, you might want to bring them in again
before the end of the week so I can look at them.
No.
And maybe maybe the staff didn't know.
No.
No, no, just give me the crap.
Here's some money.
Give me the crap.
Have a nice life.
Here's Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Oh, how are you?
I just wanted to say, I think one point that everybody is missing is the re-problem here,
which is this crazy drug war.
I think that's what's created this whole...
What did the drugs have to do with this case?
It was a...
Wasn't it a drug thing?
Well, by the thing that the...
I think, you know, they're saying this guy
looked like that could be just a cover-up story.
But I mean, it's...
No, no, they said that he looked like a suspected rapist guy.
Look, if we're not a bad guy, do you?
Well, they had to come up with some reason why they stopped this guy and everything.
But I mean, just the whole way that they operate,
the whole motor stop around, I think, is...
Yeah.
I mean, this undercover plane closed...
Yeah, man.
...you know, the whole way they operate is...
And with the magnitude that they go after people is all fueled by this drug war.
Well, that's America, man.
And the guy they called before that was agreeing with my opinion.
He said, his wife worked for the DEA.
And I just bit my tongue until it started bleeding because, as you know,
the DEA is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Yeah, but I mean...
They have to keep this stuff going on,
or they're going to be out of business, not of a job.
But that's the way police work is done these days.
Yeah.
Is with that ferocity.
Okay.
And have a great day.
He said, they're ferocious is what he said.
You know what he said?
For rocious, baby.
Is that taken care of?
Getting taken care of.
What does that mean?
I'm unholted.
They're checking to make sure that they have it and blah, blah, blah.
Maybe you should send them a message like an analog.
56670560, 0560 on the AT&T line.
This has turned into quite a project today.
Just getting a little stuff to put in my poor yard dog's ears.
Just getting like a little 20 or 30 gallon jug of that crap.
Is that a trap to slop in there?
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
I want to part of that trial.
And Sean Carroll is the one who identified the guy
and looking like the rapist.
But under cross examination, he told the jury in the prosecution
that he couldn't tell the race of the individual
or the sex of the individual.
Could you tell the sex of the individual?
Correct.
I'm losing my mind.
He could tell whether it was a black guy or a man or a woman.
But yet he could tell it and let the guy mention the description of the rapist.
He was trying to figure that out without him.
Wow.
And the witnesses...
Maybe he thought it was Whitney Houston.
No, it's Tutol, I guess.
And some of the witnesses said that our four cops got out at a car at the same time
that they didn't get out.
Peace me.
One guy got out at the car.
Yeah, I don't know what this other guy's story was where that was coming from.
And then the reason...
I didn't watch it on court TV, but I've been reading about it.
And I never read anything like that.
Well, I watched it on court TV.
And the reason the guy, that one guy Macmillan, fell backwards
is because he was just firing so many times.
You know, the kick of the gun knocked him back.
And when he got knocked back, that's when the other two guys jumped in
and took over where Macmillan left off.
But you know, it's just like you said.
It's more evidence, more evidence of police state.
And I fear for my two little boys that are going to grow up.
And the thing that's the most terrifying is that there seems to be about half of the public
that accepts this.
Like, oh yeah, they're just doing their job and tough crap, you know?
That's the scary part.
Thanks for the good news.
Have a great day.
Here's the good news for you.
The Dow is up 175.
Cut it down now, okay?
Shut it down.
Or just go buy some more stuff.
Call your broker right now and buy some stuff.
Buy some GE, buy some IBM, buy some AOL, buy some time order, buy some stock.
Okay?
Buy some mutual funds.
I hear the Netherlands is going to go through the roof in a couple of months.
Buy that, what?
Write Equal Fund Netherlands, man.
It's making a little bit of a comeback.
A little bit.
Not too bad.
Now, I could tell you the rest of that story.
Did I tell you that actually we wound up being a head on that stock and not behind?
Because there was a capital gain just before the end of the year.
That my man forgot to factor in and buy the beat, but a boot, which is like more than a dollar or share.
And so it's in the plus column.
The only thing that leaves me worried a little bit is if he's supposed to be handling all of my money.
How come he forgot about that?
You know what I'm saying?
Wayne?
Oh, that's why he's okay.
It's only money.
You know, I got all these people come up to me with their business cards.
And all we want to, you know, this one's works for this company,
potential base and working in the dean, but all these other people.
It's only my money.
Why worry about it?
I mean, you know, it's my bank over there.
Somebody's going to help them.
I'll book a brand and just close this account with them because they pissed him off.
You know, I don't want to piss those people off.
They're maybe metal come back someday.
You think so?
No.
No.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Plus, you know, man, he was starting to lose his hair and everything.
He was a good guy, but here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.
Hey, how you doing, Neil?
Great.
You know, you can always tell 5 or 6 callers ago when the cops call up.
They've all got that clip delivery like Joe Friday.
You know, you can tell, well, you know, you're a bit of an individual.
Yeah.
Right.
Anyway, there's an old saying, if you give a kid a hammer, everything's going to start looking like a nail.
And I think, you know, the police, a lot of it starts there.
You've got to start pounding a lot.
I'm telling you, it's a blood loss.
And, you know, they got those rods hanging off their legs there.
And I mean, it's, I had a cop I know.
They got a rod hanging off their legs, yeah.
Yeah, those guns, those phallic symbol guns, they're just, it's in the use them.
And in a case like this, this is what happens.
They got a chance to use it.
And believe me, had that guy had a gun, they'd have been high five in each other back at the station.
And they'd have been heroes of the police station.
But, you know, unfortunately, for the guy that got killed, it was a mistake.
And the people at Willem, did you shrug it off?
They know this is only the beginning.
They dodged the bullet if I, you pardon that expression.
But this is only the beginning because you wait till the civil trial and then the federal trial.
You mark my words, these guys aren't getting off.
No, I know.
Eventually, eventually they're going to nail them.
I mean, maybe Rudy Giuliani thinks he's living in a little closed world there in New York.
And he can run his little god, Dan, not the empire, the way he wants to.
But he's going to find out the rest of the world is watching. It's not going to happen.
That's right. That's right.
But it just, you know, I...
And let me just say one more thing, is that by agreeing, by supporting the jury's verdict in this,
he's just nailed his political fate.
That bitch Hillary, as much as I despise her, you watch.
He's going to pound his ass into the ground in November.
Yeah, that could be.
That's right.
Well, at other cops have to carry guns, and they have to protect us.
And most of the time they do a good job, but there's that...
Well, let me ask you something.
How many times have we ever protected from a danger by a radar gun?
Never.
Okay.
Never. That's a whole different story.
That's a scam, the old Georgia boys, up the...
You know, running the red lights and all that.
Yeah, the old Florida boys.
Okay, have a great day, sir.
You too.
Although I disagree with you, like I said,
they're running the red lights.
Those are the people we want in jail, attempted murder,
like the one that nearly killed me last week.
You crazy son of a bitch and your purple people leader, whoever you are.
You scumbag you.
You subhuman slime ball.
It's one thing to run a light.
It's another thing to wait until it changes, and then decide to floor it.
Lunatics.
Oh, and by the way, speaking of cars, I almost forgot the most important,
the bad news in the day.
Guess who retired, George?
Who used to put a smile on my purse any day that she was working?
Sylvia.
Driving home on Friday, and I drive through there and hand-reached my dollar bill
out the window at the Turnpike toll plan, so by a PPS.
Oh, it's speaking to PPS, new name, by the way.
And the Harold steals that from Hank.
On the front page, the stadium formerly known as Joe R.
I mean, how do you like that?
How do you like to do that?
How do you like to do that?
I don't really have to do that.
My stuff, Alhamdulk.
They're still in your crap, too.
Yeah, because pro players go out of business, so they're going to have to have a new name.
So Wayne can make millions more now.
But nevertheless, Sylvia, that used to work that thing, and she says,
and I noticed her hair was like dyed brown instead of red,
and she looked really lovely, more so than usual.
She's my last day today, Neil.
Oh, no.
She's retiring.
Sylvia, that was one of the few bright spots in my life during this five hours,
whatever it is every day.
Six hours, two guy named Long.
Let's see, eight in the morning and the two, three, six and a half hours for people
that think I put in the short work day.
These seven to eight hours a day, she was one of the brights by Love Your Sylvia,
have a great life, sweetheart, and congratulations.
Can you imagine the bozos that they have to put up with the people who are working
on those tool classes like answering phones for a talk show?
Oh, man.
Only she couldn't hang up on it.
Here's Jupiter.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, Neil.
Yeah.
Yeah, man.
How you doing?
Okay.
I got three things to say.
I got to written down on my deresity schmucks that I call you.
Okay.
Had nothing to say.
Number one.
Yeah.
Neil.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Come on.
Let's go.
Number one.
Let's do number one.
We'll do number two.
And we'll do a tango.
Come on.
Okay.
Number one.
Number one.
Yeah.
Pito's pizza.
What is it?
Pito's pizza on Belvedere.
They import.
We didn't know from Palm Beach.
We're not going to find out what's up.
They import.
Number two.
Come on.
Let's go.
Number two.
Is this bird just murdered?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
All right.
Number two.
Yeah.
Um, get out of here.
5'6", got the 05, 60, 05, 5'60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Hi, this is Todd Simpson.
And nobody hits harder than Neil Rogers.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mumbles number five.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
One, two, three, walk out.
Everybody in the car starts with my last ride.
See the looking star on the car.
The boys say the Northern Tennessee.
But you don't want to see it much like a head left knee.
I don't say deep, but it's all big deep.
All right.
Turn up.
Turn up.
Down.
Turn up.
And here, that's what's taking us off, girl.
See, girl.
So, what's going on really, that feels like a lot.
And we went and set off a spot.
And she got, we thought, good.
What do you talk about?
Please send me something.
Only a little bit of vodka in my life.
And there's an herb, a lot of vodka.
And what's going on for my feet?
And there's an herb, girl.
And there's a candle, a lot of vodka.
And there's a baby.
A little baby.
No rock, no.
And then the baby gets it on.
You are, yeah.
A little baby.
And take the blood, girl.
13 to 550 WMW.
We had a lot of stress here, evidently.
I don't really know what happened over the weekend.
You see the water Nazis.
She was down there squatting and peeing in the parking lot this morning.
560, 7, 05, 60.
And maybe she was just...
Squared.
...scored.
...scored.
...scored.
...scored.
Actually, I was...
...been subjected to court TV there during the past few weeks.
Yeah.
And actually, there came up to a subject where Sean O'Connell,
or Carol, or one of those potato haters.
And...
Carol, or Carol, over a conner?
Exactly.
One of those guys.
Yeah.
Archie Vodka.
There was actually a wallet gun.
That was...
That that they thought.
In the...
No, they didn't.
Yes, they did.
Where did that just come from?
No, I watched it on TV.
Court TV.
Yeah.
And they thought it was a wallet gun.
I never heard that.
I never read that.
Absolutely.
Why you probably won't read it?
Because those guys keep that in the...
...you know, in the dark, like mushrooms.
Yeah.
I don't know what to say.
Okay, well listen, feel better and say how to eat it.
560, 7, 05, 60, 05, 50, 50, on the 80.
That's why Norman Lear was revolutionary.
It was the first show in history of TV where they actually said,
I'm going to eat it on the air.
Here's North Miami.
Hello.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Dale.
Yes, sir.
Okay, this guy, I'm under the owl or whatever his name is.
Yeah.
This is the owl.
The owl.
Yeah, the owl in Spanish means devil.
You'll I know.
Yeah, okay.
Maybe he plays for New Jersey, I don't know.
So, could you use some help lately?
And if bad, there's two.
Listen.
There be on health.
Yes.
Okay, now, I mean, these cops are going to claim that all day,
he pushes him in his pocket and all this and that.
Maybe we just feeling the change.
Maybe we'll see there's something to there.
You know, he puts your hand down all the way down.
You can use something.
Right.
The change.
And so they're going to shoot.
Okay, shoot them in one to twice.
There's three or four.
Let's have five times.
Then I have to shoot 41 times.
You know, that's my big problem I have.
Anytime this cops want to shoot somebody, they shoot to 30 or 40 times.
Well, the least one thing we've learned today is that once they fire the first one,
they're not going to stop.
Once they decide it's time to shoot, they're going to shoot until you're dead.
I mean, and I mean, and I'm not a final new thing.
Now, they shoot you in the bottom of your foot,
right?
Right.
Right.
And the best part of it is he was still standing up if we're supposed to believe them.
How do you do that?
Those must be those new treasure bullets.
I know.
They go along the sidewalk and by the bull, they go right up your feet.
Right up your rectum.
Yeah, they should get it with that kind of bully went to the bottom and came to the top.
They went through Connelly's neck and back around and back at you.
Jackie's person right up through his neck again.
Yeah, magic bullets.
Get Arlen Spector on his.
He's right next to New York.
They're in Pennsylvania.
He'll spray it up.
He'll have another magic bullet for you.
Have a great day, pal.
Okay, man.
Arlen Spector.
That's his reward for stupidity now.
The people of Pennsylvania and their ultimate wisdom.
It must have been all the amish.
Do they vote?
No.
I'm going to say something to do with it.
Arlen Inspector.
He's been here for five thousand years in the U.S. Senate.
He's the one that came up with the magic bullet theory.
Oh, yeah.
The magic bullet.
That went through the goddamn president's neck and up through his brain and down his anus
and through John Connelly's neck and up his arm and under the guy in windshield and back on a steering wheel.
And then wound up on the guy that demonstrates where Parkland Hospital and Dallas in pristine condition.
That makes a lot of sense, don't it?
No.
But don't confuse the American public because if the government tells you it's so, it must be so.
Anybody in this in this world who believes something that their government tells I don't care if the government says it's Monday, I'd recheck the calendar.
What a Greg Reed and the U.S. government haven't common.
Besides the obvious.
Yeah.
5 6 7 0 5 60.
On the 18 T.
In fact, is that McCain's big thing that he's running around now just like Bush was saying I'll never raise taxes.
And here's McCain running around.
I'll never lie to you.
Does anybody believe that does he believe it?
No.
No.
This great performer they went through the whole thing again yesterday by the way about about his his voting record.
He makes strong thermo look like a liberal is how conservative he is.
And also yesterday he got all tongue tied to on this week with David Brickley's eyeball.
Yeah, David's the honor anymore.
They just took his eyeball out and put it on the table there.
And George Will keeps poking it around, you know.
Now what is that?
Oh, here's my good friend Matt from family formerly from family bank.
How are you doing, Matt?
Hey, Neil. How you doing?
Here's Matt who's got a full head of hair these days.
Hey, I was just in the car listening to you.
Oh, no.
And I said, what about your hair falling on?
No, I think you're not lucky.
Oh, good.
I didn't drop off the face of the earth.
I did leave family bank.
I've been gone for a long time.
All things aren't the same since your gone.
I've heard that here and there.
Boy.
But I just wanted to tell you what I'm doing.
Give you something to look forward to.
Yeah.
I am opening fit first bank.
It'll be in plantation.
It's a new community bank.
I'm working on that for about eight months now.
Well, what date is this started?
It's probably going to be in about two months now.
Yeah.
But I was looking to provide a different level of service
that the public was offering.
Any way I could do it was to start a new bank.
I'm doing that.
And I'm hoping that you'll be a customer when we open it.
I'll be your first customer.
You're going to be account number 001.
Oh, yeah.
I'm really looking forward to it.
I've been listening to your show more often.
Now I've got a little more flexible days.
And I enjoy your show.
And I look forward to you being my customer.
I'll be there with gels on.
Just sit tight.
Okay.
Where are you going to be in plantation?
Just north of 595 and university.
Oh, great.
Any old transporter plaza.
Outstanding.
It'll be the fit first plaza.
You come on me, my friend.
All right.
I look forward to it.
Okay.
Take care.
Let me know.
All right.
There's my close personal friend Matt, formerly a family bank,
who's opening up his new thing.
He's just been waiting.
I mean, the other bank is very close and very convenient to me.
Am I going to stay there?
No.
No, I'm going with Matt.
I'm going with my buddy Matt.
Not just because he happens to be a good-looking guy.
Although that's part of it, because he took good care of me.
You get personal service.
You know what I'm saying, George?
Personal service.
Like I was saying to McGellor on Saturday,
personal service.
And he kept looking the other way.
Every time I look over, he'd like hide it, say, behind that wheel.
Hey, wheel, wheel.
If you people could have just been there.
If you missed the beginning of the show this morning,
our experience, which was my last public appearance by the way,
for all time, this is not a joke, that's serious.
Not that it makes any difference.
Who now needs to see me?
I'll see if the hockey game's okay.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
I'll see Matt at the bank.
But I'm going to tell you that was one.
I could have written, if I do ever write a book,
that'll definitely be a big chapter.
Because that was not that I don't know.
But if I had any doubts about what this time was all about,
that appearance, that experience around Saturday,
was the definitive one.
There were people in chairs at some of those tables
who had been dead for 20 years.
And they were still sitting there.
With that content look on their push.
So look that says, yeah.
Do you know where you are?
Man, there was to jam rolling around the aisles.
It was unbelievable.
Every now and then, it was very quiet.
But once you knew how to hear the sound of a bag squeezing something like that.
Yeah.
And then you hear those creaking sounds.
Like in Superman 5, you know, I only have to play that.
The creaking sounds that one guy wheeling his way over toward Miguel.
Will, will, will try to win that QAM hat.
Finally noticed toward the end there.
He just took one flung at him in the cap too.
Here you go, Crip.
I mean, whatever you said.
God, that was not going to our chairs over to.
I walked in there 57 years old.
I walked out feeling like 15.
That's how young I felt walking out of that crowd.
22 before 2 at 5 60 WQ.
Here's your coffee, Zona and the first beat, the Breakfast of Champion.
Oh!
Morning, 6 to 10.
Wants Radio 560, QAM.
A Lanzo, you're so big.
I'll take a slow.
They know the daddy.
What you can.
Is David Crosby.
Where to let the end.
We truly can't see.
Here is your cup.
He lives up.
You never have guessed it.
You are thought that it was bad to eat.
He's our friend, Zona.
And then alcoholics.
We sick, David Crosby.
Couldn't find somebody.
He is our friend, Zona.
Quirk, Quirk.
And if we do, we'll get again.
We'll use all the essence.
And then he is our friend, Zona.
I've said something to Miguel Saturday at the Casino Junter about being my sperm donor.
He hid behind that wheel for like an hour and a half.
560, 560 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's Loxahatchee.
Loxahatchee.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
This phone screwed up.
Loxahatchee is the land of time.
Last week I had the misfortune of going to a meeting and I had to wait.
In the waiting room they were piping in Dr. Laura.
Oh my God, what a thank-a-monia.
I'm not just man-haired and val.
These people are calling up and I got the wrong tulips for my wedding.
What should I do?
Who do they think she is?
Who do they think she is?
Yeah, I can only tell you why she is.
That's f***ing bit.
One Dr. Laura is flying.
The other one is that big-headed Judge Judy.
I think it's a plan.
Have a great day, pal.
But you've got to understand there's a lot of man-haiding women out there in America.
That's who gravitates toward people like that.
Judge Judy especially and Dr. Laura, that bitch, homophobic right-wing bitch.
Isn't it great by the way that we have George E. W. W.
Now try to back away from that whole thing, Bob Jones University.
And he's writing the letter to Archbishop O'Connor there in New York who also never met a Nazi didn't like.
Is he fooling anybody?
No.
No.
Oh, he's very much against interracial dating.
I mean, I'm loving that.
Yeah, what do I mean?
I'm against interracial dating.
He must have said it four times.
And he kept getting redder and redder in the pus.
Does he have any idea what he means?
No.
No.
He's a bubblin'.
Just give it to him, okay?
He wants to be coordinated.
He wants to be the dick, Peter, okay?
Just give it to him.
Here's Halendale.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
It's a girl, but I have a little voice.
First of all, the living and breathing people come to the seminal casino at night.
Oh, thank you for that.
Yes, the other two.
We were there to run her line.
I have never seen it.
Even in the clubhouse at Poppano where the average age is 122.
I mean, I have never seen this one.
This wasn't the sea of blue here.
This was the sea of white here.
Yeah.
Okay.
And then death plus 20.
Yeah.
That's the first thing.
Second thing is, I don't think we're part of it about your dog.
But my dog is a similar problem.
Oh, this is, I mean, I have something called auto max.
It's auto max.
It's auto max.
It doesn't work.
See, the problem is, it's like when you're taking antibiotics, you're human.
And they'll work for a while.
And then they stop working because they develop a resistance to it.
So they have to try something different.
I've been, you know, you know, it doesn't work anymore.
Yeah, that doesn't work anymore.
Okay.
And the last thing I wanted to say was about the, the cops in New York.
Yeah.
Julianne reminds me a lot of Rizzo of regime in Philadelphia.
Uh-huh.
It was a police state.
Only worse.
Only worse.
Only worse.
I mean, at least I never heard that.
At least Frank Rizzo never went after the dog.
It's a hot dog vendor's anyway.
Uh-uh.
Well, no scars.
I know.
Okay.
Have a great day.
All right.
Oh, he's not a Nazi.
That Rudy Giuliani.
He's a great upstanding, a law abiding American.
He's a fascist.
He's a Nazi.
You got it.
Don't ever forget it.
And man, you wait and see the backlash against him in November.
It's going to be a convey for Rudy Giuliani.
Bye-bye, Rudy.
He's the only guy in America that could make Hillary look good.
5.670560, pound 560 on the AT&T line.
I don't know what it is.
It just, uh, most people, uh, even if they agree with their politics,
whatever the hell they might be this week, but, uh, they just don't like that big.
I mean, the Hillary, you know what I'm saying?
The ex-princess.
They just aren't too far to that bitch.
But compared to him, see, these are the kind of choices you get in American politics over and over again.
Which one do you like the least?
Which one do you just spy the least?
Just like the Canoevo family.
Which is the lesser of two evils?
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes?
God, Neil, you know, every time police officer's judgment comes into question,
you get all these other cops calling in defending them blindly, no matter what the fact.
Yeah, you've been like the guy said before, he's in the spot in a mile away.
You know, these guys emptied their gun clips on this freaking guy.
He was trying to get home.
Right.
You know, he doesn't.
And he had no idea who they were because first of all, he knows spaghetti and glaze very much.
He's from an animal country.
And number two, they're playing close on Mark Carr.
He don't know who the LAR.
Yeah.
And Neil, you know, if you or I messed up and killed someone,
which that's exactly what these guys did, they were.
You're going to fry, man.
You're going to fry.
I mean, the least you're going to get is a manslaughter conviction.
I mean, these guys got slapped in the hand and said,
oh, that's what I just can't understand.
I mean, nothing.
Even though the judge instructed them poorly,
as far as looking at through the eyes of the cops,
but nevertheless, at least he gave them the right instruction as far as, you know,
you can give them less than second degree murder.
And nothing, zero.
I mean, our tax paying dollars go to train these guys to be able to make the difference between a black wall at a 357 magnum of one.
You know, this entire thing just gives me the Hershey Scorch, man.
Exactly.
I think a lot.
Okay.
It's in the bag.
As they say at the seminal Indian casino during the day time,
thank God she called before that lady because at night time they got living and breathing people out there.
They got alive.
The crowd.
If you want to go in the daytime like we did, nice and quiet.
I almost almost felt kind of guilty there being there and then taking that money on Saturday.
Almost that I feel, no, I didn't.
No, because we had a rather poultry turn out.
There would like a lot of people there.
And it's the way it goes.
I mean, who wants to come on and see an old bag like me on a nice Saturday when they go out and be having a good time, you know?
They don't want to come and see me to get those stupid picture cards.
Did we have anything any hook to bring them out there?
No.
We only think about promotion on this radio station.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
There's been a Fahrt back there saying this was not something,
maybe its, you know, I put on my occupier car and get off the rails and I said,
then I'm just going to like, I wish I could open a cafe next door and say,
okay, do you want to come and have a discussion, you know,
during last year's that, if someone's looking on ["Run!!!"]
Some of the obstructions on the toilet was kind of partnered with us.
got fired. I mean before Sam left. Wasn't he working on something like that? And then of course all that money.
All that money, uh, anyway, it's 151 at 560 WQAM.
This is 560 QAM. We got your sports right here.
Yeah!
Sports radio 560 QAM.
Please don't say the F word.
My ex to we we you only have one movie done.
I like the four of them. No, no, you're only supposed to have one.
Is daddy the four? No. He has to we we. No son. He only has one. Believe me mommy. No.
No, he has two. Two. Yeah.
Hello, one is paid with a great big one. He brushes the baby. He said a state with 156 at 560 WQAM.
I almost ran out of time before passing this along, which I'm sure most of you saw the weekend.
Another great sports story. Let's hear it. Anthony Mason of the Charlotte Hornets was arrested on the Salt Charges early Saturday after a fight outside of bar in Harlem. Let's hear it for Anthony.
He was arranged in the misdemeanor of Salt Charges, posted $1,000 bond and headed for Jersey with the Hornets lost to the Jersey.
That's he wasn't in the building at the start of the game and Dale Ellis took his spot in the starting lineup.
The fight broke out about 430 AM outside perks bar police said Mason to form our next player and four of them were involved in the fight against the others.
A lot of athletes and a lot of. Sparges involved in fights and bars. You notice that? Yeah. A lot of dark complex and athletes.
Thank God Pete's doing it. He was a good white boy. He never had no drinking problem.
560. 560 on the AT&T line. Here's a lady in Halea. Hello. Hey, Neil. How you doing? Okay. Neil, you know those cops that shot that nigger.
You know those cops that shot that nigger that shot that nigger. Yeah. You know, they went 19 for 41. That's on the high. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Shot that nigger.
She's in Halea by the way. Okay. That bitch. And here's a couple for you, sweetheart. Here's Pember of Pine. Hello. Yes, sir.
So did you put my call before her? Yeah. I have a quick question. So far. Yes. Okay. A question in a comment on your website. You have a diet.
You have as much water on that as you want. I haven't got any idea. Really? I don't know because it's something that somebody fangs to me.
And I've never been on it. It's called the Assange O Hospital Medical Center. And you'll notice it doesn't say anything about water. But I would assume so. You're sure not eating much of anything else.
Don't step into it. But it's just like a cup of coffee for breakfast. No, but of course you have water in between. You got to drink a lot of water.
I don't know. Just remember when and doubt flush it out. Okay. Get out of here. That crappy phone. Here's a Hollywood. Hello. Yes. Yeah. Yes, sir. Yeah. How you doing? I agree with you would have come to Julie. I'm from New York now in Florida. And let me tell you cops are basically majority of them or nothing. But a bunch of hoods were guns and badges. Hoods with guns and badges. Yeah. You got no. You take that gun over from they wouldn't know how to be a man. It's really in the sad to say. I think it's really cool.
I think it's going to cause. You may take a war in the streets. From people to start. You know, it's time to stop this. It's time that you go because it could happen to somebody in your family. And that's the way I think that's the only reason to stop me from being a cop because I will turn all over.
Men. You know, and then my wife would be in danger. So I didn't even want to be a cop from that point on. It's really going to take. It's going to take. You know, I think it's going to take cops dying in the streets. That's just my own spin. You know, but it's sad to say that.
But that's exactly what I feel is going to happen. We can't trust them. It's hard. It's hard to trust them. And you notice them. Good ones out there. But the good. Let's talk to a good one. Here's Dave the cop who's busy with the sandwich card and the lineup.
No, I'm not concerned with the same little part of me. I'll need to send out that lady back that big if I'm finally a bag with Ellen.
