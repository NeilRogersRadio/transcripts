Adjusho on 560 QAF to talk to Neil all 567,
all 560,
Troll Free in Dayton, Rower,
all 560 on your cell phone.
The opinions of Neil, Discussion Colors,
you're not necessarily represent those
of the easily gruck aspirated staff,
advertisers or agencies.
Now, here's Neil Rogers on 560 QAF,
and both people are idols.
I have to buy a Cadillac,
or take a stick into the hole.
Why would China have a honey pack?
There's not too much good standing snow.
Those red heads down the mountain tway,
those greeny-celled walls,
but the team with the boiled down,
and now we're getting raw,
the cadillac is right there.
All the cadets up,
all the cadets up,
all the cadets up,
all the cadets up,
all the cadets up,
and now we're getting raw,
the power pole,
we could chop the stuff we do,
fire up the cadets by coal,
and blow those towers and throw away.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right, kid.
Foxy cadets up,
Foxy cadets up,
and now we're getting raw,
Foxy cadets up,
Foxy cadets up,
look at the cadets by kid.
Foxy cadets up,
10 out of 2 at 560 WQ,
I'm happy Wednesday to hear big day today, baby.
I don't know why,
but you can feel it.
Can you smell it?
Yeah, it's in the air everywhere.
Big day, gigantic, humongous day.
I think it relates to the turning point, you know what?
And all those children,
all those childish,
right wing,
hateful obnoxious,
disgusting curls.
That's what they are.
Decrease, disgusting tools.
We've been here from every day for the last few weeks,
the yesterday lots of them come out.
Are you intimidated by bushes?
That's a problem, Neil.
Are you intimidated?
Yeah, by his stupidity.
That's what intimidates me.
Enjoying tell me was getting a lot of calls off the year yesterday,
but all the way,
heading to polls,
it's all over,
well, guess what,
occurring the sun,
send off,
yeah,
not a mistake in the sun,
send off,
that has to be my mistake,
isn't it?
No,
no.
Right on the front page,
will there latest Florida polls showing
a statistical dead heat,
whichever,
I don't understand,
when goers,
they hit by two points,
it wasn't a statistical dead heat.
Now they got bush-head in Florida,
by five points,
and it is a statistical dead heat.
I don't get it.
But anyway,
the sun sent off,
front page article today,
which is totally behind the times,
totally wrong.
From the very first paragraph,
I'm chewing its entirety.
It says,
in an apparent reversal,
like the first streams in the rest of the country,
by the way,
nice going,
Matt,
we want a game.
Thank God.
Hapy Yankees.
And that's saw a post-Jourish time-bother.
See, look at his post.
Oh, boy.
He looks like he's got
a massive death on his face,
by the way.
I don't think it's going to be too long.
He definitely has the mask of death
written all over his post.
In an apparent reversal,
like reflex,
trends in the rest of the country,
see, there we go.
The public and George W. Bush's
edging democratic outlaw in Florida,
an available aftermath
of the presidential debate.
And then it goes on to say,
the shift away from
growing significant point of observers
because it's consistent with pros and cons around
the country that you're bush-moving ahead
since the stream.
Yeah.
Hey, to break the news,
get this on several,
but as usual,
why they're on a front page?
I guess they want to outdo the hero
by having mistakes on the front page.
Every major pull now,
even though it's laser-tight,
every major pull now shows,
go ahead.
Oh, the latest MSM,
what is it?
Reuters MSNBC,
their track and pull shows,
45 to 42,
for GOR today.
Even CNN,
which over the weekend,
had bushing it by 6,000 points,
all of a sudden,
they got GOR ahead by a point,
which for them is quite a concession.
Seeing that Gallup interview is 99% Republicans,
and it's smart that GOR still had by a point.
The CBS purple got,
but it'll go up by two points.
How do you like that?
Yeah, I like it.
And like Bob Turing,
I see Bob Turing,
a celebrity that I'm a credit senator from New Jersey,
who was on with our good buddy,
GOR, last night.
He and also had crops.
He had, they both admitted that if the election were right now,
Bush would probably win,
but it's not right now,
it's like, uh,
two weeks from yesterday.
And the fact is that each and every day,
and he's poorly in the polls,
GOR's getting more advantage,
pulling a little bit farther away,
opening up a little bit of a lead.
And of course, when people see this
Rand report yesterday,
challenging Bush's claims on education in Texas,
they're going to say,
he needed this guy's the biggest liar of them on.
I mean, they're all a bunch of liars,
we know that.
But they need to discuss the big liar.
A report raised by a respective think tank,
raises questions about one of the test
of Governor George W's key boasts,
concerning his record on public education,
that during his tenure,
the gap in scores between white minority students
on the state standardized test
has now significantly
a good one.
What crap?
He's absolutely full of crap.
The non-partisan rank corporations
that they found that the record breaking test score gains
on many black and Hispanic students in Texas,
apparently the result of intense drilling
the past standardized test,
past that the coaching does not help the youngsters
become proficient in this subject,
and that it might be great education.
And also said,
the massive numbers of Texas school dropouts
miss the eating list,
leadingly shrinks the test score gap.
So guess what?
Another false claim.
The RAND study supports the views of many Texas teachers,
instructors in the state,
teacher colleges and critics of standardized testing,
who say Bush is overstated as achievements
in public education.
The report's central finding is that
minority students gains on the Texas assessment
of academic skills tests are partly illusory
and not reflected in the batteries of other tests.
How do you like that?
Sounds like fuzzy math to me.
The S may.
Sounds like they're fuzzy all subjects
if there is dumb and serious.
So maybe that new book ought to be
as our children learn and not so good in practice.
How do you like that?
How that Pokemon yesterday
knew I'm so glad you asked.
And he's not here today anyway.
Not that he would care.
Fan hanks in New York, I believe.
How come the morning guys didn't know that?
The Pokemon he's going to be on.
Booge is going to be on.
They're not quite so fat as he used to be.
Who's the ugliest WQA in personality
was our question yesterday?
Hank Glover 264, 40.4% for fat hanks.
A few hundred and sixty four out of sixty three.
It was hysterical.
And guess who was the second place
who's almost never even on the station?
Fair for glad to.
We guess.
136, 20, 28%.
I was third, which I thought I could do a lot better
than that with only 90.
13.7%.
Josh Friedman's site unseen.
This is quite a tribute to his grotesqueness.
Is that when even almost nobody in the
onsite has ever seen him and they already know
they can smell it a million miles away.
They can smell the aroma of
ugliness or grotesquery.
Josh Friedman with 35 came in a
respectable fourth place, 5.3%.
Followed by Joe Rose with 26.
But a Georgian there had 23.
Jim Manditz 19, Geordie 17,
B.F.O. 15, 88, 10.
Or it's every freshing now, one more place.
The pause that be fresh is.
I hate this thing.
And he would tend to move with a Joe Costello with 6.
And both camp were the only four.
Because like I said, people are very
scared of both campers.
He's big and mean and the beat to crap
out of you if you mess with him.
Here's some bad news for the Gour
Librement Camp.
Librement Urges Relive Discussion.
Boy!
Again then a second.
He was out again seeing a little wild girl
mixed my skin crawl.
Oh yeah.
He's the Chigurian rib pile.
He's the impediment.
I mean they're saying Nate or in the course
I thought they had Donnie who was a
daughter when he needed this point.
He just totally lost it.
Too much to hanky panky with moral
autonomous I think.
Boy I mean they're married.
I think she's still married.
Yeah, that girl.
That girl.
So anyway, oh what's her name?
He's Lebbeneen.
He needs any Thomas Warrant.
One of those era beings.
He'll probably like her.
But anyway,
oh I like her.
She's fine.
But I like I said too much hanky panky with
being a Thomas made Donnie who just lose it.
They're saying that Nate or the impediment
the Chigurian rib pile.
And that's two to a point.
But it's really Gour
them.
They don't like Gour
Librement.
And not just I mean there are
certain people don't like him because he's Jewish.
I don't like him because he's too Jewish.
He's not really Jewish.
He's obsessively Jewish.
And I just I have a real
or distinct for people who are obsessively
anything anything.
You know what I'm saying?
I like that's a good example.
She had to fill that in because
they're all being like that a lot.
I was a student.
It was Cuban.
See there you go.
Nice.
You feel better now?
Oh, good.
In fact, every morning,
most people out there having a rough time
and having a bad day.
When you get up in the morning,
you say,
first God damn Cubans and then you'll feel better.
Yeah, just when you're looking in the mirror,
shaving in the morning.
God damn those Cubans.
Works for me.
There you go.
Well, you're talking about what it is.
10 times 10 is 560 WQA.
No question of the first one,
no disease could have a stress written
permission of WQAMBD.
Oh.
I can't prove incorporated.
Hey Whitney, has you affair?
Wow.
There's a rural girls by her stone tire checker.
But all the mudbub and juice flow
for five stone tires will have a
lawsuits and breaks.
Nobody wants to visit this here.
Sure.
And what
fails are now in the young
into the homestead or equal one home.
So here at Earl's by her stone tire center,
we're cleared out the inventory
and on the other side.
This is right.
It's our fire stone tire pull off sale.
Here you rest you be into our parking lot and tread
into our shore for deals on
fire stone tires that are out of control.
Our by her stone tire pull off sale
only at Earl's where we're always
to play two tries.
When it's out,
well without 1015 to 560 WQA
and had to win,
they got us feel good today.
I feel like we got a shot.
You know what Jimmy said?
And look what happened to him.
But we got a shot.
And it's almost it's gotten to the point.
It's almost like a guy didn't work with
just in the dolphin.
But you know, like out of spite
because the bush people are so obnoxious
and so disgusting and so full of hate.
And so just oh, they make your skin crawl.
Yeah.
Why are you intimidated by him?
Is that the problem?
No, I don't like him.
Is that okay?
Can't stand it makes my skin crawl.
Like I just said,
not as much as do Rubim and though.
In fact, my skin is crawling a lot these days.
I was bitten by his effects from a
royal jurellis,
which I find is thanks a little bit
bizarre because it says,
went up to Newport,
Rhode Island and Boston,
slipped and fell in Newport,
and Boston.
So you think he slipped and fell
both in Newport and in Boston?
Or what does that mean?
Anyway,
he's sent a clear distract.
You can't move his left arm
above his waist.
Was I getting in a sublippable message
since my following accident?
Yes.
I'm glad it worked.
Hey, you'll be okay.
See, when you overcome these things,
it makes you a better person.
That's why I look at it.
Doesn't that sound good?
I mean, it's corny and it's not true.
It's a lie.
But it's a rationalization.
And this way you figure,
well, you know,
I can get through through this
and I'll be a better person for it.
Whatever it doesn't kill you.
And when I can go and see my good friend,
Louise,
at my rehab place again,
at my therapy.
Oh, don't say therapy now.
Am I, I mean my,
yeah,
I'm talking about therapy for my hand,
for my hand,
back of my,
and you know something,
if I was going for like psychological therapy,
doing this show every day,
especially the last couple of weeks,
would there be any shock to anybody?
Oh, I don't think so.
Which reminds me that C-SPAN calls George this morning.
Why can't we hear this?
You know how C-SPAN goes around,
especially at election time,
and they take
talk shows in different markets around the country,
depending on what the issues are that they want to get.
And they want to come in and take the show
to hear our discussions of the election.
And I said to George,
I got news for it.
I can bear seeing it off to be on here,
talking to these Boseos every day,
and getting the kind of calls that we do on the show.
If you think I need the nationwide embarrassment,
I'll put these idiots on here.
Do you imagine that?
Yeah, here's C-SPAN sitting here.
Here's the first call from South Florida
about the big upcoming president.
This is Eddie.
Not a corn.
And your fact you fact.
Oh great, okay.
There's South Florida's feeling about the election coming up.
Yeah.
Who the hell are you,
people kid in the C-SPAN?
We got a bunch of,
and this isn't just my audience.
See, I mean, people could not hear.
While it's your show,
you know, you play all those hardening sounds,
and it's not this one,
it's this area.
This area is over.
This one's the drivers out there.
This area is loaded with Boseos.
We got more Boseos per square inch
than even in the guy named Circus.
That's right.
Speaking of Boseos,
let's take this call,
a mobile implantation for us.
Hello?
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
George Bush looks like he has bitter beer face.
Don't you think?
It'll be a pussy, huh?
He may, if he sees those poles,
he might get a little more bitter.
Yeah, well,
and I'm not looking neat quite as good.
Right.
It's the intimidation factor.
It's anything.
Maybe it's because usually,
the intimidators are bullied
so don't have anything up there.
Now, he's not a bully.
He's just, he's pathetic.
You know, when you look at him with that
whimsical look on his face,
with that dish over gray hair,
like, you know,
he's like a step away from Admors Factor.
Who am I, and what am I doing here, you know?
Actually, it's like a lost soul.
Yeah.
Well, things are looking up now.
Thanks, Neil.
Okay, see you two weeks from yesterday.
Oh, I'm not going to be excited about that.
I get to vote at the fire station.
No, 121st and Broward Boulevard.
Oh, man, I got my voter registration card out.
I'm squeezed.
But first time I'm voting in many, many years.
I'm highly motivated.
And see, here I wasn't going to vote just two
three weeks ago.
I was going to lay out.
You can't afford to lay out.
Liberman urges religion discussions.
Oh, he is.
Just, why didn't you just go away?
Well, because these are important.
I think that you're really being extremely unfair
to my position.
And we're just trying to have a civilized dialogue.
You're an immigrant.
Now, Dan, the fact that I went for a win like this
is just a very accurate reflection
in my Wimpy personality.
Don't you get it?
Yeah, we get it.
South Bend, Indiana, of our places
at Notre Dame, he's speaking.
First, he was down there at Jorge Massey's tombstone
the other day.
With a heavy heart or heavy part,
something like that.
Now he's in South Bend, Hocken and Chinatown
to those good far-briestment Notre Dame.
We turn to one of his most cherished and provocative themes
Senator Joseph Lieberman called themes.
They, for a greater worth or a religion in public discourse
as a source of shared moral principles
and an antidote to the vacuum of values
in American culture.
So just keep that in mind.
If you're not religious, you can't have values
according to Senator Lieberman.
That's the answer is religion.
Like all those child-mossed increased,
they have values.
We're meant to let it's become unacceptable in many circles
to discuss religion.
Lieberman, the Democratic nominee for Vice President
said in the speech at Notre Dame,
that we've gone a wrong way toward dislodging our values
from their natural source in moral truth.
Without the connection to a higher law,
he says, maybe you started about Hebrew National.
Huh?
I do like the salami.
He says, without the connection to a higher law,
it becomes more and more difficult for people to answer
the important day-to-day questions that test us.
Why is it wrong to lie or cheat or steal?
Why is it wrong to settle conflicts with violence?
Why is it wrong to be unfaithful to one's spouse
or to exploit children or to destroy the environment
or to defraud a customer or do you need an employer?
Yes.
I've got the answer, Juleberman.
The NH, do you know how?
That's my religion.
That's all anybody needs.
They don't need any higher authority.
They don't need the threat of punishment and hell,
burning and hell.
Everything is a sin.
Eating too many hot-fried Sundays.
Why is it the sin?
Enjoying too much sex.
That's the sin.
Whatever it is that you enjoy.
Whatever is that's good.
It's the sin.
Don't need it.
Wraive your magic wand, Foggy,
and just make it all disappear.
The world will be a much better place for it.
And give it a crazier people like that man in the dress
who's forcing people to procreate
and have already done wanted babies
that they can't feed.
That society can't support.
That there are no jobs for.
That there's a hopeless existence for it.
Postetic Jewelie Bremen.
This far I totally, he's the equivalent
for the Democrats just like Pat Robertson
and J.A. Farrell, while under the Republicans.
I guess everybody's got to have theirs.
Unfortunately, the Democrats decided to run for vice president.
Bad move.
Take him out of the equation
and go as got about an eight and nine point lead
at least the way I look at it.
With the without a native.
Here's a mobile and plantation.
Hello?
Mobile and plantation.
And what is it?
What is it?
It's a clear?
Yeah, and here.
So, what's up?
Yeah.
You know that Bush, though, is what good for it.
Yeah, oh, that's a good boy.
How we remember to see what voice you've got to use.
That's a good boy.
Now take the Sakari Rector
and your foot out of your ass.
Let's see how things go.
See, that's what we were going to have with Searspan
right there.
This way we're going to have to wait long for a good example.
He's got 15 pounds of styrofoam crack over his purse.
He's got the phone stuck four feet into his rectum ass.
I just want to see what kind of voice he'd come up with.
You've got to admit it was pretty weak.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on the 18T
and provides a wireless line.
Out of town, all those hot shots over there in the West Coast,
all those great intellectuals.
8, 7, 7, 7, 8, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5, all those julying idiots.
I mean, here's a mobile and four-letter deal.
Hey, Neil, how are you?
OK.
I definitely believe in the same thing as far as you know harm to others.
I got a short story.
I was up in Boca the other day having lunch
and the strangest thing ever happened.
Long story short, there were two 80s with two kids sitting there
at a Friday's restaurant.
Yes, sir.
And they were facing us.
And the child just continuously screened
whenever it wasn't being fed.
And basically, I was just looking in that direction.
The next thing you know, she gets up,
starts screaming at me and pointing at me saying,
you will not talk about my child like this.
And then it ended by her walking over to me
and I was saying, excuse me, I said I was never looking
at you.
I never made a gesture.
Now, was this your making woman?
No, no, no, no, no, no, it was a Jewish woman.
Oh, a Jewish woman?
Yes.
So, how do you know she was Jewish?
Was she bringing Mrs. Orlando on?
Well, she looked like it.
I gotta tell you.
No, she looked like a Jew.
Anyway, she didn't even have a George too much.
Anyway, she decided you wanted to threaten me
with a coat in my face.
But the one?
A coke in my face.
Yeah, I know it's your charge.
And no extra charge, obviously.
And the next thing you know, we were trading coats
and trading water.
And that's all I got.
To the cutting water.
See what I mean?
I'm calling the seat stand back.
Car seat stand back.
They missed out on some really
close to the kitchen's observations there.
That's all you got.
That was the only thing that you was worthwhile in your call.
That's all you got.
That's precisely the truth.
Believe me.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60.
Let's keep it going, baby.
We got four hours here.
Three and a half times here's our poor food today.
If Clinton campaigns for Gourmet will help,
make no difference or hurt course chances.
We're doing the three choices there.
Make it easy for them and all that too many chances
because there's too many choices.
Or chances.
If Clinton campaigns for Gourmet will help,
make no difference or hurt course chances.
Pretty simple, pretty straightforward.
You got it?
No.
Now, well, think about it for a while.
Hey, I would suggest if you were interested in one of our great
puts the notion in the back.
New y's the best of key chains since they were in the 1500.
If you don't mind up in the predicament that happened last year
when they ran out of them because I don't assume we're going to make any more.
We're not going to have time.
Right.
So they're going to go like hotcakes.
That had no idea.
Is there anybody working in promotions today because
some people in the hallway were belly-icking about the fact that
our promotion department seems to be,
in fact, the whole place today seems to be pretty much out of the lunch.
Course, drop is on vacation and maybe Greg is off
for being here in the service station.
So I have no idea what the deal is.
But it seems like we got a little skeleton crew here today.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
But I'd get on the horn and get one of those key chains.
That ordered from our website,
www.newwagens.com,
www.qam.com
or call on Miguel's extension to your 565 or 156.
Because that's your only post you can get the key chains along with our
vanhits.
You can get the CDs and cassettes, of course,
it specs all over South Florida,
including Naples and for Myers, no less.
And all shipping and handling is being donated by
Pac-Mail Centers of America,
965 North Nottingham Road and Plantation.
All proceeds this year benefit plan,
per and good in South Palm Beach and Broadway counties.
Got it?
You got it?
No.
Get it.
Here's the mobile one, hi, Alia.
Hello.
How are you?
You're locked doing.
Okay.
Very good.
How's the pulpit going to focus?
Yeah.
Good.
What can we do for you, sir?
I just wanted to emanate the rest.
Yeah.
And that's good.
That's great.
And I believe in DNA.
Yeah.
To the harm.
Uh-huh.
And
you hear an echo?
And
well, I believe that you...
Okay.
565.050, pound 5...
It gets you spanned in here.
Come on.
I mean, I deserve to have been in here.
So the public realizes that I should probably make about three times what I make.
And I'm making a lot of money.
But I deserve at least three times what I'm making this time.
Because I'm trying to make a show out of talking to these.
But and this is it.
Well, you hear right now.
This is it.
I'm going to say for 25 years.
Used to be in the olden days of the topics and the guests.
It was older seeing our people.
But now it's just younger assholes.
Which we've got an endless supply down here.
That's what makes the show so great.
And we never run out of assholes, right?
Right.
Everywhere you look.
And for many of you,
you're just in the mirror.
You're not going to leave home.
26 after 10 and 5.
6 to 2.
Will you flush back in?
And that's in doing cooking and fraternity, huh?
And when I say coca-do not mean foca-coca.
Chio where they go.
Oh.
They're all stuck to me.
They told me they're still.
Don't you just don't need a pretty plane to say George Bush?
Ew!
USA George.
But sure.
USA George Bush.
Oh.
Oh.
Why are you doing that?
Why are you doing that?
I'm not going to leave for a while.
It's not the time you've got.
Run it down.
Step, step, step.
Spock in and die.
Oh my George Bush.
He's in USA George Bush.
They'll be being dumped by his villain,
as I will give a speech to like only father can
catch George Bush.
He's in USA George Bush.
But she doesn't have to be in USA George Bush.
Oh.
I don't know.
So.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you soon.
Oh.
How we take so fear and free fun?
The show rise on F.F. on.
When it's F.F. out, on the call.
We got back up and take so long.
Well, it looks like it's F.F. as much as George Bush.
And just like F.F. one, turn him to his house in George Bush.
Oh.
He will let it go.
It's Bush.
He will teach George Bush.
He will teach George Bush.
He will teach George Bush.
Currently, here at 560 WQM, they're
proposed by George W the Republican
presidential candidate to remove US troops from peacekeeping
missions in the Balkans.
It's provoked a wave of anxiety among European allies,
who first had to move with split the NATO alliance
and damage faith in American leadership.
While reluctant to be drawn in the final stages
of the US election campaign,
senior European diplomats and officials
that NATO headquarters said Mr. Bush's call for a new
division of labor within the Western Alliance threatened
to create web principles of shared risk and collective
security that have sustained the alliance,
the Atlantic military partnership from
one and a half a century.
And he liked that.
Also, the governor, who pushed for
inside legislation limiting civil lawsuits,
filed his own lawsuit against the Redalcar agency
of a minor incident involving one of his daughters,
who likes it.
That's right, back in September 8, 1998,
enterprise-rendy car, a little offender bender.
So you don't want you to be able to file a lawsuit
with George W. He likes filing his own.
Couldn't serve the papers or couldn't find the bitch.
I mean, the nice lady here at Redacar.
There's Greg Reed who says...
Oh, that's what he said.
Something like that.
Cool, don't forget.
If we find out that he voted for Bush,
we're locking him out.
He was a board person.
He was word of word that...
No, yesterday.
You know, last time he was in here,
he said, oh, I don't know.
He tells so many lies.
Well, you ought to be used to that.
And then he had to be able to relate to him.
God, in fact, the bees, he's got a love-gore.
Although I didn't get paid today.
And I just go on, Greg, got paid on 10,
and he had to wait two checks,
but because they screwed up the original,
but I'll take it anyway.
In any form, even in the Bush or basket.
Gore, vote three or four times, or else.
I don't want to start pushing you around,
but we can't afford to lose any votes.
So Greg, Reed's voting for our goal.
Wow!
George would vote for Gore four times
if he wasn't a legal alien.
Sandra votes seven or eight just to make up for you.
Thanks for all four to 20.
Is your vote my voting?
Absolutely.
All right.
And both of her friends?
Well, she used to have a lot until she married you.
56670560,
56670, how about all your Cuban friends?
Where they were voting for George?
Uh, guess.
Oh, I don't have any Cuban friends.
How about your Cuban voters?
Is your mother voting?
Ha, no.
Is she a citizen?
Yes.
And she's not voting.
No.
Oh, good.
Yes, that's the best.
Excellent.
That's the best news I heard.
Rocking your mama up all day on a election day.
She wouldn't have to find it when the power booth is here.
Here's from over on plantation.
Hello.
Yeah, good morning.
Yes, sir.
In a couple of weeks, when you go to your polling place,
you're going to be going to the wrong polling place.
What do you mean by that?
I have a vote on my registration card.
Well, you said your vote was $120, first and then it's been changed.
Well, how am I supposed to know that?
Well, just telling you, I just got an envelope.
It's fire station number three,
121-01 West Valorant and Plantations.
That was in 1875.
Now you're going to go to Victoria Park.
What?
Yes, we're going.
118-10 some ice.
How do I know that?
Well, I'm telling you, I just got a neighbor's yours.
I'm about six longs now.
I just got a new voters registration card.
That's where I'm supposed to go.
You mean a little park where there's nobody in there?
That's the one I've never been there before.
Well, where are you going to vote in that place?
There's nobody there.
There's a little building there.
Is that what's going to be?
I think I have a portal left.
Yeah.
And that's where I'll probably be going.
But that is your voting place.
You better check that out before you go.
I can walk up there.
Absolutely.
Because in my opinion,
I don't want to have to go too far from home.
That's the news.
Okay, thanks.
You're welcome.
Now, how are we supposed to know that?
See what I mean about making it more difficult for people to vote?
They're always bitching.
Already, American people, you're a bunch of long kids,
which is true.
But I mean, even sitting that aside,
long kids have a way to vote.
And they just keep making it harder and harder.
And the voting thing, too.
God damn it.
Now, see if he wouldn't have called me.
I would have gone over there.
I'll bushy.
I'd know.
I'd never said, oh, you're in the wrong place.
Maybe assuming that, I mean,
here's one of my neighbors.
He wouldn't screw out.
They wouldn't go.
Victoria Park, there's nothing there.
You know what it is?
It's like that empty.
They made a park there.
Nobody uses it.
Nobody goes there.
Nobody does anything.
They got like a bike trail there.
There's nothing there.
I'm, of course, a sunrise and, um,
what do you say?
Sunrise and one 18th.
Here's a mobile and four-letteredale.
Hello.
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
We have got the wrong information.
He's supposed to go to volunteer park,
which is the new building that was just
built by the city of Flanagan.
And it's supposed to be part of the new park system
that's being developed.
It's on sunrise, full of water,
and on the 118th, it's not Victoria Park.
And it's not that smell park that's north of them.
Is that new bit of facility that was built on,
on Sunrise and one 18th?
What new bit of facility?
What are you talking about?
The volunteer park water toilet.
The new building that the city of Flanagan
is going on.
What about it?
There's no water toilet on Sunrise and one 18th?
Yes, there is.
There's no water toilet on the right to corn.
You got to go over the ones in a while.
There ain't any go over there.
It's like a two-bore four-bars for my house.
No, it's a brand new facility.
15,000 split-foot building.
Okay, thanks.
I think you ought to know what's on that corner.
There's a 15,000-square-foot building on the corner.
118th and right.
They're now a Luka trees.
These are blue who obviously bush people.
See, that's how desperately I try to just,
yeah, they figured my one vote, that could be the edge.
And it could be.
So let's spend from now to two o'clock,
fighting out what I'm supposed to go vote.
I mean, this is, this is pathetic.
This is tragic.
Now, we'll see.
It's Victoria Park.
What was the other one I say?
Look out the park.
The Jaina Park.
Something to the V.
Who's with the V?
Venus Park.
Bread Park.
Oh, speaking of bread park, how about those patterns?
I'm the, uh, uh, uh,
Firm on.
Only 6,000 MPSE or also tickets for the right scheme against
well, I'm not playing anybody that good with this
defending stand-up champion, and usually devil.
And like I said,
I'm never tuned anybody out again for not showing up,
but because the prices are ridiculous, they
raise the food prices again.
The, uh, what they're putting in what I saw on Sunday,
there's no way that if I for work,
if we want that close, in fact, it's right kitty corner
from Victoria Park.
If we want that close to my house,
I don't think I would go plus getting the free tickets.
Find a pay for this in no way.
See, I hate to break the news to people in the organization,
but the public, if you're going to soak them in a leg
and the fleece to hell out of them,
they want to, they want to go up in and see a show.
And they also want to be entertained
in an environment that's enjoyable as opposed to that
true, any sample, my first,
of what I'm going to name is,
that's a Bitch from Channel 7.
And then they got that band playing now,
which it'll be my first, uh,
oh, opportunity to be annoyed by that.
How about making it into, and then the PA and
after that we used to know and love the guy with the hand,
and they got this new guy, which you heard on a spot they played
before, who sounds like a 10-year-old child.
Oh, man, they just, they won't listen to anybody.
They haven't got a clue.
They just haven't got a clue.
And they wonder,
why there's all those thousands of NPCs.
And you look around the league of the attendants,
I looked at last night's games on a separate NIC in New York,
where there were a lot of people missing
because they were at the Yankee Met's game,
but nevertheless they still had a sell-out.
They sold all the tickets like they have for years.
But even in Montreal, 2000 NPCs,
on the show's tickets, all among the league, it's bad,
but here it's really bad.
I mean, it's real bad.
Better get in gear pretty soon, boy.
It's DM and TM or it's going to be Austin away.
The last fella who's the baby,
how's your angel doing?
Let's bring him into coach.
24-11-560 WQF.
But Neil Roger shows sports radio,
560, QA.
If you blow too much, you're in trouble.
No, settle down, class.
As you all know, we can no longer put up
the 10-community in our classroom.
There's a link in an effort to avoid
attending anyone who might have been
politically, religiously, or ethnically offended
by our pledge of allegiance.
The politically correct arm of the
justice department has rewritten the pledge
so as to be completely non-sectarian
and non-offensive to any special
interest or protest group.
So, that's the game.
I voluntarily affirm my devotion
to any symbol I choose from
whenever my ancestors come to the origin,
maybe.
And through the same collaboration of various
special interest groups that yet symbolize it.
A diverse melting pot under a deity
that nail manadocates with the discretion
to be divisive at our own realm.
And a freedom to burn this symbol
or to hear it in elephant tongue
whenever we see six
and ten and a half.
Yeah, 10.45 at 5.60 WQM.
So, Wayne Arnold said what he votes
where a pineal number one
and Howard the courthouse annex.
They have a office of voter registration
and whatever right there.
Yeah, you can fill out your little card.
Yeah, but what about that gigantic
80,000 T.O.B.
Torn on a corner by my house there?
Didn't look as it was
at across the street from my house
and I just missed it because I'm not
really observant.
I had a lot of pain for my arms.
I just dehoned all the mallas with the trees.
And that might be it.
This is pathetic that you can't even
fight out where you're supposed to vote
and you wonder why people don't vote.
You wonder why people
because you want to blame them.
Is that what it is?
Jesus, K Christ, Mary.
We have a pair of tickets for the right
to the game.
Anybody interested in that game?
No, I'm going.
Just out of boredom, I guess.
I'll go for a while.
Do you know just how bad it gets?
We got to pair right up on the glass.
What the session did you say?
133, row one.
Is that what you said?
Session 132, row one.
Right in the front row.
Right up here and put your nose on the glass.
Take a look at the witness.
He still looks as good as you usually.
Take a look at Pabels.
He's got a,
gee, that one to the spot.
You know, maybe that's what's killed a lot of
fans away.
Don't always look like Pabels.
Breath those biggest anticoanacover.
Like maybe they had like a swap.
A little exchange.
You have a program going there.
Here's a mobile and Pabel Pines.
Hello?
Hey, no, how you doing?
Okay.
You need to explain something to me.
And you just explained?
Exactly.
I don't understand why you're pushing all these people to vote.
Can you explain to me why you vote for the president?
Is that an understanding of voting for local government, state?
But why am I local and state
doesn't have points of being court and federal judges?
That's why.
And then they have a great,
and nor does your vote elect the president.
How do you know that?
Because the electoral courts.
So let me say it again.
Whoever wins board of a just 25 electoral votes,
which very well could be the difference.
If we were in Delaware,
I would say well, you know, maybe we're not going to make
very much difference.
Florida could be the approval state.
Sir.
If I vote for Gore, and you vote for Bush,
yeah, and Bush wins, what is my vote?
It's where it's supposed to be.
Well, what does that mean?
It was supposed to.
So there was white vote in any election.
If you voted for if you voted for Clay Shaw,
I voted for Elaine Bloom,
and the one that you didn't vote for wins,
where did you vote for?
What kind of logic is there?
I've heard some stupid rationalization to my life.
That's pathetic.
What candidates can't win, sir?
They can't both win.
Is that what makes it worth voting as long as the candidate
you voted for wins?
No.
So what are you saying?
What are you talking about?
The general public doesn't elect the president.
So why need us vote?
No, so what do the electoral votes come from?
Those are where they come from.
And has the president always been elected by the...
Oh, God.
So long as the GFC's been in here, come on.
They've got sport about it.
I think how long, how many minutes do you think
before they get all their crap together and get out of here?
Can't you just sue them on the way out of there?
Oh, wait, crap.
We're getting a hell out of here.
These people are crazy.
Kind of a show is this.
Hey, I ask myself that every day or two o'clock,
but I got to check in my pocket, thank you.
How about the slides, guys?
Hey, you know, the people don't do this.
Sir, you're a lazy piece of crap.
I've been lazy for many, many years.
This year, I'm going to vote.
I'm not that impulsed about how good to say the best,
but the fact is I'm real impulsed against the other one
and against the people that he stands for in the surrounded by.
And everything that they're all about, okay?
They got it.
They're all about one thing, intolerance, selfishness, hate,
and intolerance, like I said, three things.
5, 6, 7, and I assume the fact that we're given away
that credit tickets for the night's passage is a game
and not even all the lines are lit up.
What does that tell you right there?
What does that tell you?
Plus, line 6, I guarantee you still don't work
because the program director took off on an obligation
and nobody bothered getting the guy being thrown fixed.
I mean, there's this scrapping, this like,
just like Todd Dreck, with that spot that he doesn't care about.
He doesn't care about the fact that the copy is delivered
and doesn't make any sense,
and I'm supposed to make Chop Live a lot of dog crap.
They just don't care.
It was that when we first came here three years ago,
it's that way.
Now, it'll always do that way here,
because it's the easily effort away.
They just fake their way too wise,
and like I told you earlier this morning,
just take the money.
Just take the money.
Like with the thing that's a Panther game,
I mean, if they lose every game,
they're worth to do, which is a possibility
with the way they're growing.
Just take the money.
We're doing the best we can.
I try to get people out there.
I try to reach in a little excitement,
and we'll support nobody cares.
And it's not only just the fact this is a bum-fork town,
which it always has been always real.
That's the part of it.
But the fact is, I mean,
you're just pricing everybody out of reality,
and you're putting out a crap for product.
How about the excitement?
How about the environment,
which people can enjoy themselves,
instead of the constant,
bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
Yeah, three hours of that.
You walk out of that feeling like you need therapy,
or I'll say therapy again.
How about just for my hand?
In my hand will be trodden.
And it won't be, I don't think it'll be trodden
from applauding and cheering on those pants of oil.
So I could be wrong by having a feeling,
you know what I'm saying?
Or simply feeling the pit of my purpose?
All I want to do is find out where the hell I go in both.
That's all I would like to do.
I looked at my voter registration card.
It's one that made the mistake of saying on the year
where it was, and now I've had 72 different people
with buildings that hadn't been even been built yet.
There's a 95,000-feet city
on a corner of sunrise and 118th Avenue.
And somehow, even though I drive by there every day,
50 times, I haven't seen it.
Yeah.
There's a whole complex.
There's a sports complex.
There's an arena.
There's a baseball stadium that John Henry
hasn't discovered yet either.
It's right there on a corner.
And it's not, that's all from steak and shake.
Here's Merimar.
Hello.
Maybe I can go vote of steak and shake.
Merimar.
Hello.
Good morning, Neil.
Yes, sir?
Pleasure speaking to you.
I don't know why all these people are coming
for a push and a push and a push.
This is one guy who does know
cannot pronounce the name.
Yeah.
Merimar, let's go.
Come over taxes and change coming in a couple of taxes.
Where are we going to get this tax now to pay everybody?
Peaches, doctors, nurses and so forth.
You have to get more state taxes.
Take the social security money.
You want to put it in bonds.
Then that bond can wrap it up.
Where are we going to pay?
I don't know what America and the American
really wanted in this guy.
He cut them taxes all.
All he...
I don't want to much from my just want them to go away.
That's all.
That's all.
I just want to buy the taxes for the same way.
All the taxes and taxes and taxes.
Send them back to the office.
You want to show them one,
sanitary treatment.
Months first.
Then it's right now.
She will remember one of them.
Really all these other people.
You know, I have the personal,
the people that are here.
Okay.
I appreciate you.
Thank you very much.
Okay. I'll see you after the stadium where we all vote.
Yeah. That's where everybody votes.
There's this big joint.
There's this big place.
That's what we're going to do today.
We're going to find out where we all vote.
We are even in Dave Broward,
Mundo, West Coast.
We all vote in that.
I think we're voting in that Tico arena
where they're in Fort Myers.
In the...
What is it?
Oh, Nico?
No, it's not Oh Nico.
It's a sterile.
That's where we're voting.
I'm getting hysterical about it.
Just trying to find out where to head you
supposed to go and vote.
It only takes about five minutes.
That's all it takes.
Because it certainly will pay any lines
early in the morning when I'm going.
In fact, I probably have to get up
around six to pull open at seven.
I'll get up around and go out at six.
And I'll try a few different spots.
Is this why I vote over here?
No.
How about over here?
No.
Is this why I vote on?
No.
No.
Probably I won by a bunch of Bush officers.
Any of the great people,
they know they're here for good.
They tell you, you can't vote here.
Here's plantation.
Hello.
Hello, Nico.
Yes, sir.
Oh, it's a pleasure.
560.560 on the 18T and Verizon Marbles Line.
It's not about the mayor.
Here, too, that was Mayor Velfi.
Yeah, old fart.
Crossed you with 520 years of your hood.
Yeah.
Here's a mobile plantation, huh?
Yeah, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, man, I just want to make a new one.
I drive for work and I'm not a plantation anymore.
But there is a new complex right over there if I have.
It's a, it's on the Southwest corner of 118th and Southern.
The Southwest corner of 118th and Southern.
Do you know where that Equin Park is?
There are question parts where they ride the horses and stuff.
Make the lead park, yeah.
Yeah, well, it's right there.
It's right north of that.
They broke ground on it about 34 months ago and they're already done with it.
They're done with it?
Yes, sir.
I must be oblivious.
I must have had blinders on.
Yeah, because I used to do that never.
I don't know if I'm sorry to the other side, but I know that already pretty well.
I saw him building about 4 months ago.
Okay, well, when I go home to the end, I'm going to a skull.
I'm going to go over there and search like crazy.
You can't miss it. It's on the sun right.
Okay, thanks.
The features on right.
Okay.
Yeah, man.
Do I remember any of these people?
Oh, no.
Yeah, I saw that movie with Charles Boyet and who was in the England, Bergman.
Wasn't even the gas light where he was trying to drive with crazy.
That was a great movie.
Not for a huge shock movie, I do believe, wasn't it?
I saw that.
5.670560, 560 on the AT&T.
Too bad we don't have seats man here for that.
Oh, he's killed an hour already.
Nobody said anything.
Although I did like that guy with the shmink head guy.
He was good.
How are you, Shmink head?
He was good.
That sounded like Maddie Bell doing the voice.
That was Maddie Bell.
You know Maddie?
He's an asshole.
Yeah.
And where's those number?
That's right.
He don't have the disc yet.
He didn't have the disc.
Hey Maddie.
Come on.
Come on.
52 votes in our four Clinton campaigns for goal over.
Health course chances 32.
Health course chances 14.
Make no difference.
6.
Oh, and then there was one of the shows last night.
They were interviewing you know, the new shows.
They always have to have one for goal and one for abortion.
One who's like, uh, all first up in cup is the Chinese say like confused.
So they had one young Julio guy out there and it was them on California.
And he says, though, I think I'm a book of Bushness about all his big Spanish.
And I just let out a, you know, that the AC say 15 routine is yeah.
The 15, the 86.
My little dog speaks in type of Taco Bell dogs speak Spanish a thousand times better than W.
Did you have the trouble speaking English?
Forget about Spanish.

Recent court rulings concerning the sexual orientation of scout masters has made it nearly
impossible for the average parents to know what kind of scouting experience their sons can expect.
But one organization has a reason to make things perfectly clear.
The gay scouts.
Okay, true of time.
It's an up cow.
I've been ditching it for hours.
The gay scouts will teach your son the art of self-preservation in the wild.
Oh, man, it's natural light.
How are we going to get this fire going?
That's okay.
We can make our own body.
But here son joins the gay scouts.
He'll hear late night ghost stories.
And when the severed body was found,
he was wearing a tonic Quran on some with clashing the pelt that had been out of season since the labor.
Oh, that was the scariest thing I ever heard.
So if you want your son to bond with other like-minded young men,
have enjoyed the gay scouts today, where our motto is.
Jesus, hey, to try to understand how old it is.
Okay.
One more clock at five, 60 WQM.
We got Bruce Chabby for Hank Lashaf, and we got Hank Lashkown after being voted the obvious two impressionality.
He couldn't have known.
It was that one in New York, anyway.
Her name is Senator Lashwig.
Make that your game or two in the series.
So the Bruce people will be there to fill those big shoes.
And then we got Gelly on Game Night, six o'clock tonight.
Gelly on Game Night from the Hard Rock Cafe.
Over there, right by that big arena that they just built, not far from the sawdress.
And then we got the death, the death of the panda panties, seven o'clock to pregame.
Game time, seven thirty with Judge McDonald.
And then we're serious getting them before in progress after our hockey game, after the panties do what they're going to do.
Do what they're going to do.
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound five, 60.
You know, it really just amazed me.
See, I was just reading some, I'm getting all the stuff over the facts.
Most of which is pretty interesting.
I don't want to bore you with it on the air because none of you care about it.
But the fact is, like somebody said, the other day.
In fact, he was republicant.
And he was one of our few rational honest Republicans who said that the right wing is a more motivated.
And he's right.
They're highly motivated.
They're salivating.
They're forming it to mouth.
The equipment leaders, the bubble haters, they're forming it to mouth.
And the rest of you and you can tell from this program.
Yeah, the rest of you all sit in back.
And of course, we got, see, look at the different elements.
You got the Jew factor, the old Jews.
They're all pissed off at me because I won't cause you up to Jew Loubriman.
And I'm not going to say, you're not going to cause you up to anybody that I'll believe.
And he's got matches.
He's disgusting.
He's everything that any, all he needs is the pace and the amulacate and the guy being my shmack on.
He said, just to be one of the, how soon and that's all he needs.
Those are the causes.
Everything that we can't stand about Orthodox Jews, that's him.
All these guys do is to go over there,
or rock it and mold against the waiting wall over there with all those other krujihasudam.
And believe me, if he had the opportunity, he would.
Makes me nauseous.
While you don't understand, you're pissing off all the bush people about it too bad.
That's my comment to them.
See, I wrote through this every four years.
At a lesson climb.
And there's a certain part of the audience.
And then they go away or they just get pissed off.
Too bad.
I'm going to sit here and express my opinion.
That's what they pay me to do.
And if you don't like it,
to you, okay?
Too bad.
In addition to which, like you said, that's a big part of our closet audience anyway.
All those right wingers out there who distribute just about everything I say,
but just to squeeze themselves while I was at it, between 10 and 2 here.
Like that crusty old fart and plantation, the mayor.
Where's the fat, the gofag?
Right here.
Segalah.
Oh, little Segalah, yeah.
Oh, you.
Here's a mobile and four-letter day.
Hello.
How you doing, there?
Okay, sir.
Yes?
Yes.
How you doing?
You having a pretty good show now.
560.
05.50.
Palm 560 on the AT&T.
And Verizon wireless line.
Here's a Miami car.
Hello.
Oh, the audio device.
Okay.
Hey, I was wondering.
No, you still giving up that ticket?
Are you partying?
The tickets.
For the hockey game.
He said you were giving up to take us to hockey.
What hockey game does this week?
I do.
So I expect what hockey game is in?
The one boy on the night.
I was telling.
I've never been to hockey.
Oh, okay.
560.
7.05.60.
Palm 560.
See if you don't even know who's playing.
I mean, I'm not going to get to something tickets like.
Oh, no.
He wouldn't know.
Scott need a word from Robbie.
Need a word.
Chris Scott won't be playing.
He's not signed.
But believe me, Robbie won't leave.
Even though he is signed for 2 million years.
He won't be playing much either.
He'll be in uniform.
560.
670560.
Palm 560 on the AT&T
and Verizon wireless lines.
Here's Bokeh.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Neil.
Yes, I am.
How you doing?
Okay.
Uh, okay.
I just wanted to let you know.
You turn me on to that little red caboose.
Yeah.
And they're great.
I must have driven by their 200 times
and didn't know they had those little hamburgers.
And just love them.
They're good.
Yeah.
And just, uh,
want to thank for that.
And I wanted to get your opinion.
If, um,
or didn't have Lieberman,
you think you got a better chance?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes, I do.
All right.
I think it'd be a similar.
I think they have hot, for example,
on there would be great.
There were a whole bunch of people
who could be on the ticket with him.
Uh, how about the guy Tora Sully
from New Jersey?
There was some last night.
There are, there's Ziggin people.
Yeah.
And one other thing.
I mean, what's the plan tonight?
What is it?
Is Vincent playing tonight?
No.
He's not.
He's still out.
No.
Not playing.
Okay.
You still have those tickets?
No.
5'6 7'5 60".
Pont 5.
See this guy calls him for things he's
talking to me about something else.
And there's, uh,
Greg Reads walking around with his
glove button on.
Oh, let's hear it.
Now he's come out of the closet, so to speak.
What a big smile on his post
like he knows what else is going on.
I am still trying to figure out
what he'll I vote.
I can't find out where he'll
I'm supposed to go and vote.
What is Robert's town?
And you wonder why we don't vote?
I have voted about 100 years.
If like now, uh, think about it.
I don't think I ever voted him for that.
I'm thinking maybe back into the soda.
I don't think so.
I've voted Michigan.
I'll tell you that.
F and A voted for Hubert Humphrey 1968.
How's he doing?
This looks like in the church.
Yeah.
What about he'll be?
H H.
Slowed dead?
5'6 7'5".
I mean, what kind of business is it?
You can't find out where to go vote.
And then they rip the public
because we were, uh,
uninvolved and we're not enthusiastic
and we don't participate.
Listen, you know, how about having,
how about if they have the ice cream truck
come around the neighborhood?
You know the moments with the bells
that are those stupid ice cream trucks?
Why can't they have the voter
that they come around in the hood?
Well, some hoods.
Here's a mobile in camera.
I tell you.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
What's going on, Captain?
I've been gone here for about eight years now.
Right?
Never registered the vote this year.
Definitely.
We can't let that clown bus get in.
Yeah.
I'm going definitely for go up.
So I'm, I guess, I'm another go up ahead.
I'm believable.
If this guy gets in,
forget it.
We'll be two step in all kinds of music.
That's right.
I'm telling you, he's out there.
If he gets in, we got three trips to that park
right across from another state of the neighborhood
just built by my house.
Free summer vacation.
5'6 7'5".
Get two Spain in here.
Come on.
Get the channel seven.
Get channel 24 and six.
Who do we appreciate?
You're good channel eight.
Really?
Yeah, get clandying in here.
You're in the double clandie.
And then they would say,
see, that's why we don't have a show on anymore.
This is the kind of crap that he's got on the show.
See, if they were to put any work into that show,
if they were to put any,
at first of all, people could have heard the audio.
That would have helped.
That was the way I should,
if I were to have a lawyer that had any brains,
which I don't,
they really would have had some balls.
He would have sued the rest.
Right?
Am I right?
What they did for me,
I wouldn't do to God them if I browned.
Or Cheryl?
I mean, it's just unbelievable.
What they did.
Virturing, technically,
and then I kept telling them,
don't put the calls on.
It's only like a 20 minute show,
but you take the spots out of there.
They put calls on.
Put me on there.
I'm the one that's saying something that makes them sense.
That's provocative.
If you run over to the humor,
you're going to get it from me now.
These Boso callers,
I don't know what Maddie wants for them calls on it.
And then they would put calls on there
from these people where I've let them go too long,
which I confess,
back in those days,
I was still doing that,
which I don't anymore very often.
These long,
ponderous calls that went nowhere.
And then they wonder why nobody would watch that.
Post-effects,
it couldn't hurt.
I mean, the fact it couldn't hurt
didn't help too much either.
And in spite of that,
I still get all these people.
Oh, yeah, remember your show on Wanda,
what time is that thing on?
Just imagine if it would have been done.
Would any,
any, even,
just a little bit
of involvement,
a little bit of,
something.
I'm still thinking about those little
five, six, seven,
oh, five, six,
two,
five,
six,
three,
on the AT&T
and Verizon,
whatever's lines.
What are you,
what is wrong with you?
Just tell you,
just so,
such a silly person
since you did those shows on eating ass,
you know,
just never recovered from that.
Well, it just came to mind
when I was thinking about
eight minutes after,
a limited of five,
six,
three,
two,
a certain degree of read.
So you said that,
now you're going to get people
rendered all upset.
He was in here this morning,
giving me a big sign today
about all his domestic problems.
I go to get my,
my therapy,
my hand therapy that is,
I go there and,
Louise,
we are great Louise,
but I'm sitting there.
She's got me as a captive audience
because she's squeezing it
in my hand real hard too.
And she,
I hear the whole life story,
and by the big,
but about,
but about for her son,
that this,
oh,
oh,
you know what I can hear
right now?
Here's a big
fat one in my purse.
That's right,
a big fat cigar from NYX.
It's legal.
And would be legal for us to have
something through.
Do we have any?
Do we have any?
No,
because Frank,
Mayor is an asshole.
But you don't care about that.
We do because we're pretty pissed off about it.
We can't seem to affect any change on that.
What's the succession
with hope to you?
Good evening, Governor Mills.
I suppose we,
so,
are you,
are,
did you, uh,
have you formed
any guiding principles
for exercising this enormous power?
Maybe,
maybe,
maybe,
maybe,
you don't believe,
that's what's, uh,
a goal that, uh,
we should take sides
and this,
it was all this way.
A lot of people pushing,
hey, we,
the United States should declare itself
and, uh,
and not be so neutral.
And this,
now, have I got that wrong?
All right, Heather?
Okay, yeah.
We're going to figure out another question.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
Uh, um,
uh,
the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, uh,
how about you, uh, what the, the, um, uh,
how about you, uh, no?
All right, did you, uh,
let's move on.
Yeah, Vice President Gore,
would you support our sign as President of Federal Law,
banning racial profiling by police
and other authorities
at all levels of government?

Thank you, Vice President Gore's watercolor manburt
for your next week to now

next.
And I'm just going to play the 5th fish issue and Boston brewed the fire coach Pat Burr.
Oh, you like that.
Harry said in that cheap prick is going to have to pay him off that year for not working,
which he didn't want to do.
And Mike Keenan, according to Guilty, I've got the release in front of me here.
The brewed fire coach Pat Burr is following a tumultuous offseason in which Manning has
been blamed him for the heinous problems last year but decided to keep him on.
The Keenan had opened the season 3-0 and one brought the last several games.
They got in the tank and he's going to be the skate coach.
Pat Burr is really last more than two years any place.
He was under verge of starting a turd but two years is about as much as Pat Lai,
Montreal, Toronto, wherever he good guy for about two years.
That's it.
The team said it would name success over the clock this morning.
It's now 11.16 and it says Boston Hill reported Ranger coach, former Ranger coach Mike Keenan
was a favorite in Jolie says he's in Mike Keenan.
So if they think they had problems with Pat Burr, wait till I have to put up with Mike Keenan, huh?
And he has to put up with cheap Harry Simons.
So here's somebody that's been saying about Malachi.
The Bush can't send this to bring Bob on.
Yeah, bring Bob on and bring up the moniker thing again.
What they don't understand is that they would blow up in their face because every time they start
with that moniker and the impeachment stuff again, the public gets more and more pissed off
and if you think about that $60 million that they could have spent on going to the
goddamn ballpark or something like that or going to that new Victoria Park Place.
So here's the facts.
Where do I vote?
What's the website?
Somebody faxes me a thing here from Jane Carroll, Bowers, Supervisor, Vol.
And there's a website here, but I don't see where the hell it is.
It doesn't say anything.
It just says here, oh, I see it on the bottom.
www.browards.org.
Slice voting slash info.htm.
By the time you get into a put all that crap in here,
you could have gotten voted four or five times.
You could have gone around the goddamn neighborhood and find out where you went to vote.
This is embarrassing.
We've been on for an hour and 17 minutes and I still can't find out where to go and cast my vote,
which might be to deciding one.
You do understand that.
That might be the one to put and for that asshole before it might give the 25 electoral votes to go.
And if I don't go, it might wind up being crap.
Or some asshole might go out there and vote for Ralph Nader because they like Phil Donahue.
Oh boy, you talk about tragic.
He was out there standing in front of Shay Staten before the baseball game last night
and saying the same stupid idiotic things, same old tired crap.
And Bill Preskept the same.
You know, I really admired you very much back in the days before your brains got scrambled.
I really thought you were great.
Phil, here's the mobile invoker.
Hello.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Hey, Neil.
I live in the North Bakers on the other side of Sunrise.
Right.
And there is a volunteer park.
It is brand new.
The only reason it's kind of hard to notice.
It's set back from Sunrise and 118th Street, about 100 yards.
Oh, I haven't seen him.
It's in the corner of that property.
And that is where we vote.
It is where we vote?
Yes.
Well, that's great.
I can walk right over there.
Like I've been there.
I mean, I'm the first time caller.
I'm only sorry that this is all I have to call about.
I appreciate it.
That's great.
Thanks, thanks a lot.
Thank you.
See, there's a guy who sounded rational.
Sounded lucky to when he was talking about.
And now I don't feel quite so stupid
because the fact I can't see it,
it's blocked what he say by a bunch of malalucatries
or something like that, probably,
because plantation is infected with malalucatries.
And also with a police chief who's illunatic.
But they were stopping the chief they called before.
They were like, hey, you'll fag that one.
Yeah, you make up those rules as you go along.
You drive in 90 in your car vet.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
See, just because somebody drives a car vet
or a really hot car doesn't mean that they're irresponsible
drivers, like most of you people out there are.
Believe me, I've seen you driving.
It sucks.
It blows.
You know what really bugs me, I mean,
every day I could take one thing that drives me nuts
about the way these people drive.
You're approaching a school, though,
like when you come off the stadium,
the turnpike there by the stadium,
and you come around Honey Hill Road to come here,
and you make that left hand turn.
And then why there's not a stoplight there,
I still have no idea why,
because they're all these terrified,
timid people are refused to make the turn
and they got everybody backed up and we're waiting.
Are you gonna turn now?
It's pretty clear about a hundred miles in each direction.
And then it's a very short distance from where you make
the turn to where the school zone starts,
by the little sparsers, I mean,
that little school over there.
And what they'll do, like this morning,
I had some, Schwarze, I mean,
some of Doc Lady in a SUV.
Doc Lady in the Doc SUV.
And she's very late and long from behind.
Just totally oblivious.
I mean, ladies, don't you understand
there's a reason why the cars up here
all have stopped in a slow-down and crawling along.
It's a school zone used to be bitch.
You idiotic, Schwarze, it's a frickin' school zone.
See you next time, honey.
But hopefully not on the same road at the same time.
Ended in an act like they're so guided in the patient
because first of all the speed limits,
very often there are brokers under the overpass there
or over the underpass over you look at it
and they enforce that 35-like life in debt there
because it's right going into the school zone.
And the speed limits, sweetheart,
is not 150 through the goddamn school zone.
It's 15 thick in miles in our edition
which you got all those cars stopped there.
You're not going anywhere.
It's like people like you're very impatient
because you're slowing down for a red light
that's ahead of you there.
And they want to be second at the red light.
They're in a big hurry.
They want you to haul ass and slam on your brick.
We'll see your bricks are going to last a lot longer
if you don't slam on your brick.
There's no point in doing it.
Only stupid people do that.
His haul ass to get to the guy in the intersection
and slam on the brick for the red light.
They don't freaking know how to drive.
And I'm going to say it again,
mandatory vehicle inspection desperately needed
in this God forsaken state.
Not just the old tube up your rectal.
That was a part of it.
That was just a scam to get your 10 bucks
but real vehicle inspection.
And then I had, remember that I brought it up
last week and some more, ah,
we are a USATO of a bitch.
We don't want it be bothered with that.
We don't want any bother with it
because you're irresponsible.
You're the ones that the goddamn chief is talking about.
We'll make it up as you go along.
No headlights, no taillights, no goddamn brakes,
wall tires, and you're out there like a,
like a goddamn driver.
And your head comes up to the bottom
of the freaking steering wheel
and your deaf dumb and blind
and discarding your NISTICS,
your renewal of driver license to the mail
from the freaking state of Florida
where everybody's a driver.
So that's one good thing.
You go to your nearby convenience store
or your main market at the gas station.
You can buy your lottery tickets
and also get your driver's license
to the boxer cracker jacks.
It's great.
It's sensational.
Everybody hears a driver.
What percentage?
How many people since the last 50 years,
how many people do you think
got turned down for drivers' license
in the state of Florida?
Yeah.
That's what I would say.
Here's a call in Miramar.
Hello.
Hey, glad for me in Mar here.
Yes, sir.
When you're not,
not you know what a, what a vote.
You're gonna go to Moshe or Homosexual Agenda?
Yes.
All right.
I'm only both from the canister
and Dwarfs' buddy in R.A.
Uh huh.
That's right.
Uh huh.
How you feel about that?
What happened,
like you had to get some bad gold boards
richest morning or what?
Uh, I just, uh, I sport the other day.
I believe it right.
Yeah.
And that's it.
And how about you?
No.
Yeah, you're gonna call me a gun hugger,
and you're gonna go, no.
What's the point?
You are, I mean, you already just did.
Oh, you know, you're hugging, you're squeezing it.
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe if you had a penis,
you wouldn't have to have a, you know,
be squeezing your pistol.
Glenn.
Yeah, Glenn from Miramar,
what about chronic regulars who love the show
but hate himself for loving it?
Yeah, identifies himself.
Glenn from Miramar, who's been listening to the show
for 100 years.
Hey, listen, you're a time to be a gun love enough.
That's, that's okay.
It's a miracle.
You might guess.
Fine.
And it makes him feel better also,
even though he loves this show,
and it's been listening for 600 years.
It makes him feel also better.
He's got to get that sagging in there
because it's big news.
December 17, 1976, like 20 years ago,
in a couple of months,
that I came out of the closet on KAT.
I've been out of the closet, proud fag
for 24 years in this town,
but to these people, it's so, it's so news.
It's still an issue.
It's still the one thing that they got
to hang on to in squeeze.
Because if I disagree with them,
it's always,
bag it,
bag it, yeah.
Tell us something we don't know.
That I'm a fagging, you're dumb.
Tell us something else we don't know.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Yeah, sir speaking.
Yeah, I agree with you on the panther issue.
The chronic get out of here.
Go play with your boyfriend.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T and for
rise and wireless life.
Here's a mobile invoker.
Hello, hey, shouldn't we be worried
tonight the new journey devil was going to be up
to play in the panther.
Yeah, that's right.
They're playing one of those really hot teams from last year.
What was that?
That was one of the most ridiculous statements
ever made in history.
TM yesterday I'm not mentioning passing that when we played
the other teams that they're really up for us because we
were so great last year,
I guess what he forgets is the fact that those people read
the newspaper too and they see that we have a one again
this year and they see the tapes of our
with logic and our pathetic this team has played this year.
I guess he's forgotten about that.
Yeah, and the fact that some poor games last year,
we might only lost by a goal,
but we were totally dominated.
You know what it's called?
It's called a lame excuse.
That's what it's called.
Anyhow, I was born as Glenn in Neomar concerned.
I thought Faggot's thumbs and slow up
heinuses go hand in hand.
Yeah, I mean, I got a new set of ear plugs
and he shot me getting them tickets.
No, five six seven, I see once you say Faggot,
you're not getting the tickets.
You can say that you get the tickets.
Then we'll take them back.
Five six seven, oh, I mean, I couldn't care less,
but it just, yeah, it's just good to bust your balls,
which we like doing on this show a lot.
A lot.
Five six seven, oh five 60 pound five 60 on the AT&T
and Verizon wireless ones.
Maybe we'll get a line six fish come day.
What is that?
No, no.
Now that our PD is going on vacation again,
got only knows what's what's what he's doing.
Love it 26 to QA M.
The Neil Roger show sports radio.

Our ancestors
They'll be very upset to see
that in Canada they just pass much stricter legislation even on those of fully
make-believe guns and nobody in the age of 18 can buy those and it's a
gigantic like $5,000 fine and they do not pass through and go straight to jail
and stuff like that because they're sick and tired of the American violence
sleeping in over there and all these gun nuts coming in and they also had a one
of those you know turning your gun in the programs where they give you like
500 bucks whatever it was per gun and it thousands of them turned in it was a
massive success but of course we don't want to do that here because we don't
want to apply great strong Americans like Glenn of his peace 5 6 7 0 5 60
pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless lines is there anybody in
promotions today or what no that those guys taking the day off I guess
everybody's off here today this is what it will be coming for today I'll
give my check that's right you can always be sure I'll be here on the 10th and

good pull question I like that yeah that's a that's a sensational question okay
here's the end of the first pool today if Clinton campaigns for Gore it'll
help course chances 69 I didn't make the number up anti-dead no I didn't
16 9 correct scores chances 25 make no difference 18 out of this crowd they
think it would help I agree that's how I voted I say bring Baba on baby they

the stake through the heart of assholes like Bill McCollum and all these other
guys and fully masturbating his moderate who the hell you kidding how do you do

or love them both huh that should be good yeah let's give an opportunity for
all those hate mongers out there ones that hate us like poison but are devoted
to oil that's all we care about as long as they're there every day because we
got to fill their desperate need to let vacuum in their lives the big vacuum in
their rectum uh-huh great here's probably waiting for an answer to the hockey
ticket didn't get on though 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 and of course anybody said
their nose in on an old rectum yeah here's a mobile and four-letter hall okay
I got a new one for the spot you JB JB Jack Black Jungle Bunny yeah I was calling for the
biggest when you're wearing the summer sky and for the spring so yeah I gave
the summer sky and we asked the mother's income was before we gave them
a we didn't want him to some spots here see that again and this one we don't give
hockey tickets to sparkes it's not that we discriminate on the show we do make
the exception that area we like some nice white people are the hockey games we've
already got one spot to their plan on the team that's enough he's allowed in
uh it shouldn't be he's allowed in there that's it you people you've taken over
football you've taken over baseball totally taken over basketball let us have the
one thing that we still have is a white person sport we lot of few of you people
in there accepted that's where we draw the line no moss no moss no more
sparks is not he because as soon as they get their foot in the door all of a sudden
you turn around you wake up the next day and they've taken over the whole
goddamn thing except of course for that swimming thing there's still
other problems with that yeah this hole is gonna be great here's Miami hello
yeah yes sir yeah I agree for should win and you should both from because anything
that represents your best interest you should both for but after all you know
he is kind of arrogant and anal and so are you on the show but then again we
each have a right to press our opinions on your show that way every day so you
should be open for their opinion and don't cut off everybody like five six seven
oh five fifty pound five sixty on the 18t and Verizon were the slime
here's what mine is home yeah me how you doing okay listen back in September when
we had local elections over here in the county my wife and I have recently got

registration card back it was for independent so my wife had to vote as an
independent when we called the supervisor of elections over here in Lee
County yeah for Linda young they're answered to that me only we're just going
ahead and vote for an independent this time so I mean the best of
you now when you've got a vote over here you got 65 Republican booths yeah

independence I just I just thought you made by that interesting you know thanks for
taking the call thanks for the making the call thanks for the good news that they
just screwed up over there as we're over here but at least they had the good
common sense to get rid of that make do we'll fascist take that was great nice
girl said again congratulations in Lee County as opposed to the numbs and
brow to keep putting this they just they never met a Nazi they didn't like
in Broward which which is boggles my mind all these liberal Jews in Broward
County control I mean what are they 90% of vote up yeah and yet the
weather was at stack or Bobby Butterworth or Nick Navarro or this a long list
of Fernando of course this Ken Jenny son of a bitch every fascist year if they
get in they keep putting it overwhelming they again maybe just as they're so
stupid if they recognize the name they put it back in there you know what it is
of course they do like Elaine's room because she's selfish and she's good how
do you like that that's right she's Jewish and I'm just in case you didn't know
that I want to mention nothing is to have an influence on your vote but she's
Jewish oh Elaine's room play shot he's a boy I just I just mentioned that in passing
father paranoia
just salvage and get this poll on here because you think you're gonna win you're
not even in the win the running you're not in the running here's a mobile in
Miami hello okay now there's another hockey asshole here's a mobile and
Fort Lauderdale hello hi Neil yes sir oh four four year poll I love you a little
bit more than George but I love you though let me be truthful okay it doesn't
really matter who is elected here you know Republican or Democrat they're not
gonna keep their promises it doesn't matter it does matter sir it does matter
because they're gonna appoint justice to the Supreme Court and they're gonna
they're gonna shape policy in this country on a whole broad spectrum of issues
not just abortion but a zillion different issues so it does matter they're
all full of crap we know that before you hang on this helped me I've been a
Democrat until this year and I'll tell you why I changed the reason I've changed
is that I've seen a lot of my hard past dollars like yours those for funding
fund programs that do not work like welfare I hate to break the news to you but
under this administration the last eight years the welfare rules have been
like clean right out when did that they cleaned them out well that's true the
last couple years and they say I'm not sure either what Bush keeps saying they
have signed down government dramatically out of this administration which we
are going it was very much instrumental in doing that but wouldn't you be
a Bush is far too far I wouldn't be for a Bush under any circumstances and if
all you're gonna vote for is based on your pocket books here I hope that's
somebody had I hope you got enough money to bid your ass out when they throw
you over the hell they're gonna throw you selfish knee-end with all prick that's
exactly right yeah and yes I would I wouldn't save a lot of money you know what
you can sick that money right up his goddamn rich billionaire spoon fed ass
that's what he can do with that money him and his goddamn cronies in there who
are polluting the air so bad that he can't even you can't see five feet in
front of there in Houston and pretty soon all over Texas and that's what you do
to the goddamn Everglades and the environmental whole goddamn country all
him and his good buddies in big business and that's why the stock market all
OC EOS are just salivating to try to get him in here that's why the markets in
the Schmidt House again today and the Nasdaq is down 40 and 50 points every day
and that Barton Biggs son of a bitch on Morgan's families honor yesterday well
we got a lot more work on the downside to do on an Nasdaq you get down to about
2500 yeah they only wish they could get it down to 2500 like to date before the
election they're not fooling anybody they're not
saking anybody out in it I'll give you a classic example of how much your
government cares about you when hell is that article about that crap I'll find
it oh yeah early strokes linked to diet aid and decongestion and you see this
the other day about ppa no and ingredient in dozens of popular over the
counter died in cold medicines maybe the cause of several hundred hemorrhagic
strokes suffered annually by people younger than 50 the government finally
assigned to set Thursday a wide variety of over the counter decades old so it's
a feno pro-pro-pro-king pronounce it ppa found in products ranging from
dexatrim to triaminic but the FDA says yeah cannot be classified as safe
yada yada so what they're doing is they're not gonna let them make any more of
it but the stuff that's already on the shelves well you know so what if we lose a
few hundred more people go ahead and sell it because we don't want to do anything
that's bad for big business that's your government whether it's gonna cred
over public in the only difference being that once the bush gets in there it's
gonna be a hundred times as bad
but you go ahead and worry about your goddamn panton tax cut that you're gonna
get sir and that's 60 cents a day I hope like hell it really comes in handy
maybe if you save up for a few days maybe you can buy a box of triaminics
try him you like him 24 noon at 5.60 Q.M.
Here I'm fast
I think you got me to meet you
Oh man don't you ever take a step
I'm gonna have to wait where you going
oh
he's the one
check it out I can slow bubble
I know it
it's not just that's what you say
I ain't telling you but I know
it's very easy down
you're like this and inside that's where they do you
this is just one of these
so that might be it's not what I'm going to do
get it fixed but everyone's been
stuck in and scared
walk through hallway sideways
and these covers is going to be a lot of ahead
I'ma say he's a carry
he's a carry and some new means please
I'm a ball
we're not too sure what's going on there
stay away from me
Josh free food
to have you safety money
but he's not standing here
I'm funny as if he don't come to your feet
Josh free food
he's looking at his teeth
and I'm not letting buttons
and televised the bounce
that's what that is
got to explode
and
you can't just buy all over the room
there's tables up and down
and move things
welcome
just to hold in all that greasy old food
stay away from me
Josh free food
and he think I care
if it's what I don't like me
I think he does
so come to me
Josh free food
come here
there's a lot of things
going to be from the museum
there's a theme
and something called the anathlete
14th of November
I played that as George just informed me
a story that I had never heard before
an astonishing story of how I don't want to mention
Joe Costello's name
over the other building
and the rat and fester
bug and fester's studio on Sheridan Street
in the old days
Joe evidently was running the board
producing the show
and Josh was standing in the control room
next to him
gas is the aroma
that sweet smells of success
kept getting stronger
and stronger and more
pungent
and less evil
and only several meals
because he just couldn't handle it anymore
that's our own Josh swordman
for station
it got the guts
to keep somebody on the payroll
who smells
and looks that bad
a lot of courage to do that
if what we're going to have that freak
remember
He was netting praise, he was giving me.
And calling him the thing.
Yeah, the thing says.
Well, I mean, that's him, the thing.
And the thing, and like I said, the people that showed up at those appearances,
we appreciate it over the years, some very nice people, a few, a handful, couple,
but I mean some real things.
Some real things showed up at those appearances.
I don't want to see no things, not his thing.
Ooh, he's got one.
What's that vote so far?
Who do you hate the most?
George or Neil, love them both or hate them equally.
Let's see, he's refreshing now.
It's 34 votes, hate them both equally too.
Neil3, George7, and love them both 22.
I'll give her a head so far, but don't get too caught on by it.
There's other ones combined.
Here's Poppino, hello.
Hey Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Okay.
I was on a house the other day, paying the roof.
And I heard you mention boy at filming and that's 99% of the people don't know what you're talking about.
That's correct.
I like it when that happens.
Yeah.
And actually, I'm on a...
What is it?
I'm on a page phone over here and it's going to copy off.
But do you think I've got the same face?
For you, Salmin?
Yeah.
I don't remember that.
He was a great defenseman.
He was a Swedish defenseman throughout all the police for a hundred years.
I grew up in Missedaga.
Right.
I got a joke.
It's not too good.
Okay, good.
We'll talk to Don Cherry.

He's not for the abolition of the Second Amendment.
So I'll call his show and make up a bunch of stupid right-wing crap
because nobody in their right mind is going to believe it, okay?
God!
What a jackass!
What is that?
Ow, and well that was quick.
Ow, goreces, I believe in the right of sportsmen and hunters
and law-biting citizens to own firearms,
but I want mandatory background checks
to keep guns away from criminals
and mandatory child safety laws to protect our children.
That's his position which has nothing to do with even your interpretation
of the Second Amendment being eliminated,
which of course your interpretation is wrong as we all know,
but nevertheless, and how's your militia doing?
5, 6, 7, 05, 60,
05, 60.
See, this is a thing that's such a deep-seated sickness
in American society that you're never going to overcome it.
Not to mention, of course,
the millions and billions of dollars that they are spent
to manipulate these puppets.
And I'll say it again, the NRA is the number three
contributor to the Bush campaign behind Philip Morris,
the backhoe company, that's right,
and the pharmaceuticals also in the top five at number four.
Any oil companies?
But thank God he pulled big business.
Here's the lady in Halliday, a hello.
Hello.
Yes, ma'am.
First of all, I bought the book,
is our children learning.
And I will share that with every Bush supporter I know.
Great.
Maybe you could read it to them.
Yeah, I'm going to have to over some of them.
The last caller that you had,
Bush campaign is sending out some propaganda
through the mail because of mail carriers,
I've seen it.
Saying that Gors is the second amendment
does not support people having their own firearms.
But there's this propaganda through the mail.
Not true.
I know.
I'm saying they are sending that out.
So that's probably where I'm at.
It was even discussed with the base.
If anybody would open up their ears during the base,
he answered that question.
Right.
And for George, I'm on my way to the US.
I'll send pictures.
OK.
Thanks.
Bye, bye.
Get your Lixon Route 66, 560.560,

Let's give away some more hockey tickets.
No.
93 votes.
So do you hate the most?
Love them both 56.
Rhymes would root.
And the George 25, Niel 6, hate them both equally 6.
So you see 12 out of 93, that's almost 13%.
Who hate either you or me or both equal.
How do you like that?
Yeah.
13% of the audience.
And that's not even the deep closet audience that
wouldn't even dignify us by going to the goddamn,
somebody showed them how to hop on the internet and cast
the vote there because for fear that somebody would find out.
So we've got a lot of background and deep background and deep
showed and deep closet, deep closet lockbox.
I think the macoms are going to put them in that lockbox
that they stole from Al Gore.
Everybody wants to put everything in a goddamn lockbox.
Here's a mobile and bokeh.
Hello.
Hello, Niel.
Yes, sir.
I'm a big glass of butter and I just wanted to get you
a send in.
I've lately been a lot of editorial rights yesterday,
since I've known about I'm wishing the big dog Bob
Bob's a lot and starts stuffing it all up.
Right.
Flames states.
And I really think we're a means that and they think it's a
lot of everybody because of human's case.
But he needs it.
He needs it bad.
He's a touristy girl.
I say turn him loose.
He's the best campaigner in the guy in the country.
Turn him loose right now.
And if the Republicans dare to bring up penis skate again,
it'll blow up in their face just like it was doing during
the impeachment hearings.
I'm totally great.
I think he's got out and then the fake face and the big
face and the first thing he's got to get out and swing it.
You got it.
All right.
That was the thing.
I'll see you at the polls.
OK, vote for four or five times, please.
Turn bubble loose, baby.
That Mary Magdal and that's what last night on the crossbar.
Oh, yeah.
Bring him on.
Bring him on.
We can't wait.
Bring him on.
Yeah.
Bring him on.
My ass, sweetheart, or your ass.
Or she's a disgusting man.
Oh, man, when they invented that word,
see you next time.
They were thinking of her.
Mary Magdalene.
Can you see her in the sac with that little ball-headed
James Carville?
My name must be a real.
M.S. be a real laugh a minute.
600 open lines.
Not a rock.
If any hockey tickets away.
As if we had any hockey fans out there, which we don't,
which you'll see tonight.
That PA guy I'm telling you.
What was wrong with the other guy?
He had to be the scapegoat.
I wonder who's going to be the scapegoat when the BM and TN get
their ass can who's going to be the scapegoat then.
And who's going to be buying the new bow ties for Bill Torrey.

And if you have an opinion on that
Here's the mobile and e-ha junction hello to you. Yeah, I need you. Yes, sir
It's just amazing that there are people out there that would go and vote for George W
I mean if they read the paper if they read they see where he's coming from even if some other world
They vote for this man. I know I don't get it. I mean
I don't need a post. I'll be a president every day. I read the editorials
I read time magazine and they talk about about where he's coming from and what's gonna happen if he if he becomes
a elected president and the fact that out what if he blows this it'll be absolutely
unbelievable and if he doesn't call in Bubba
Who might say to that? I mean he really is and he's gonna be thinking about this for a lot of years to come
Yeah, well, I think his handlers are making a lot of bad mistakes
I do too. I mean, it's just because they really want to be following this thing
I've always been interested in politics and you know to hear you talk
I wish the hell you are
syndicated
I mean I drive a lot I hear a lot of talk radio and I hear a lot of these assholes like Rush Limbo
They're all the same. They're all the same garbage. Yeah, what about somebody who likes you on you have a thought about going
National
National what working for these people? No, I'm talking about being on is on
I've thought about it many times about sitting here and saying the same things and actually getting real
Cross from real living and being people which of course is impossible to do here
Absolutely. You have your thought about it. I mean, I mean, you really we really need a voice
I do it to be going all over the country as opposed to a limbo
Limbo okay, well, hold the take a deep breath and I'll let you know what I'm I thought about it about 10 seconds
Yeah, wouldn't that be great?
Here's a call from Boston. Here's a call from if saliety here's a call, you know
Living and breathing people
Softal people not just a bunch of wives
You think even even the people you think are rational like that's a Glenn from Irma that just the comedy just totally off off guard
Usually he don't call usually he like who writes something
You know, and he's one of those people it's been listening for years
And not because we have a discipline on something political
But when he starts with a bag you're there's about you know, you're an asshole Glenn
It's all I can tell you man. It's very sad. It's tragic. Yeah, I'm a bag and big deal. I'll guarantee you a hell of a lot better person than you'll ever be
5 670 560 pound 560 on the AT&T and provides a marvelous line
And that's one thing I don't believe is running along calling people names as hell
Here's a mobile in western hello
Yeah, now yes, sir. Have you ever heard of such a thing called a misery index? Yeah
1936 when the inflation rate
The unemployment rate was less than 10 the incumbent party is one the election right it has a fail since 36
Okay, so now we know it's gonna win. What is the misery index right now? The misery index is like that
I'm appointed a 4.2 I think yeah, and the inflation rate isn't bad. I don't know what it is. It's probably 2.5 to 3 percent right
So that's less than 1010
It's worked since 1936 every four years. It hasn't failed
All right, thanks for the good news. You're welcome. There you go
We rest our case bush losers
6,000 open lines here today. I thought for audience yeah that guy
You know it's depressing when I hear that guy talking about going syndicated and going national being on all over the country
And saying the same you know fantastic things and being a thoughtful and talking about religion being a pilot craft
I really getting thoughtful interesting people to call as opposed to the bumholes. We got one round down here
Yeah, and we have an endless supply non-stop and I get paid the same either way very
You know healthy amount so for the same effort about is well
Talk to real people do we have any here? No, and like I said at the beginning of the show the the rational people
They're just laying out on this whole deal. They're just laying back the right wing the gun nuts the Bible
Fumperies the a figures huggers. They're all highly motivated forming it the mouth like they always are and this is the only reason it's even close
And in the so-called younger activists. They're all with his neighbor crap. They're all wrapped up in a phantom and illusion
Trying again to figure out how to screw up the election and really great way to waste their vote
And they found it they found a way
But I still believe that that's more and more of these people saying this I believe as you get closer and closer like each shippur
And when they give them that polling thing the two weeks from yesterday. They're not gonna vote for native maybe him. They may be two percent
Because once they get in there. They're gonna say well. What's the point? What is the point just to make sure Vonny who happy? He's not gonna get on TV anymore. Oh far
Here's Hollywood hello
Hello, and he was married to that to Arab bar. Yeah, go ahead sir. Hello. Yes, sir. Neil. I was wondering
Uh, here's the guy that's running for the presidency. Okay. He's an admitted
recovering alcoholic whatever that is
Yeah, he's also
refusing to answer questions to his past and
and drugs
I remember I remember doing the cockers campaign that they made a big deal out of the willy willy hoort and say
Yeah, now why isn't it all of a sudden the cocky stock willy hoort and take for the tigers. Yeah
Well, what I'm proud of is how come the Democrats have allowed this guy to get away with that stuff when this is fun
Because they've been running a pussy campaign and this is what's cost and desperately that's why it's so close
They were a pacified campaign and the rest pacifying of all was Lieberman there with the kid gloves who teamed with Dick Cheney
That was pathetic Dick Cheney's got one of the most obnoxious records when he was in congress
The most obnoxious right wing extremist records and just unbelievable and yet Lieberman just wouldn't touch him
Yeah, another thing
Keep repeating over and over what is the compassionate conservatism. Yeah, I don't even know we had a party that
Was headed by that name. Well, that's what Hitler said to a compassionate nachos. What happened to the republic and party and George
Pursuant he a member of the republic and party he's a member of the fascist party. So you don't ever forget it
At a rate they pal. Yeah, he is he's laughing. I'm serious. That's what the Republicans have been taken over by
And you notice see it's one thing on the one side you've got bubble in the
Working and we're working there afraid to bring him up and on the other side purposely kept in the background
Trafflot, Tondale, Jesse Helms, Storm Thermon, Dan Burton all of these right wing fascists
Pat Robertson
Jerry Falwell all keeping them kind of like and then they finally tried it out that obnoxious little connoble and Gary Bauer yesterday morning
What a piece of turd he is
Man, it's a just if you'll be called see people are sure memories
In 1996 that the Republican Convention wasn't in 96 it was in 92 and became a made that grotesque obnoxious hateful speech
was in 92 and he's a high six and
And now all of a sudden grow it but Clinton went up like five point and then it was one in the landslide
Not that they all remember the limper
Remember had a chance anyway and again a limper and a game pan
So you know
Not too many people around the country said let's give Bob bill we're hoping
But anyway, you can't get up there makes this grotesque homophobic racist sexist obnoxious
crappy speech and everybody said we don't want to part that well just what
Those are the people now and I'll say it again like I said yesterday the reason you can it is making no enroads at all
And hanging in there with his one or two percent usually about one percent in the post is because the right wingers
I delighted with W
He's their stuporant baby. He's
He's their man
And how just just on the abortion issue alone just on a Roe v. Wade when I see them saying all the the gender gap and women is narrowing
How is that possible? How is it possible?
And then of course this business about well married women you know
Mary couples much more conservative and married women are much less for go. Why the hell is that? Don't marry women have any daughters last time I check
And brisk supports and amendment I hate to break the news here that doesn't allow for any exceptions
On a version illegal period
No exceptions. Careful the mother no exception
We're doing first right princess no exception none zero Zipri do off. Of course straight to jail do not pass go
Just on that one issue alone forget about how stupid it is forget about how many antiforcs forget about how inexperience
And how he doesn't even know where close of always on the map admittedly saying these things knowing nothing about throwing the fears
At a time when they're talking about how we're on high alert over there in the Middle East because of the terrorist attack on the US as cool and now they're ready for another one any day
And the craziest rail use in the Palestinians are busy. They're trying to blow each other up as quick as they can
And we're gonna put some bozeb and air based on
Crack
About promised tax cut
Because I know that all of you are making over 300 grand a year

My
About thirty two at five sixty WQM. So I asked the nephew must be a mom now leaving in a month
Must be just kind of a coasting on two and Miguel works his story
He occupied today
He's a promotion department here. I don't want to start getting pushed or anything like that
But I noticed that we're not to not get enough of all the inputs some days
Like yesterday a ring they got ringed up. He has been today. Huh?
So you see what you know in fact what's his name?
Yani from our shows the problem was like walking on the halls belly aching about the fact that they work about four minutes a day
And you can never find them and stuff like that. I just go on yani didn't take him on to figure this place out. He's got a stunt on it
Where we going here's a mobile in four-bottomedale. Hello?
And you know how you doing okay?
Hey, I've been trying to get 3D guys for like three days. So I guess nothing's changed with the phone systems on there
Um, there was a guy who called you the other day and said that that you were
In so many words profiting on the device of this that you're putting up. Yeah, that was yesterday. That was that what is it?
Hello. What was it like you were saying? Yeah, um, that was like a couple of days ago yesterday
It was yesterday. Yes. Okay. Well, I just wonder is everything still your fault
I mean the kidnapping of the limber baby and the assessment
That's right. That's that's that thing with the kids in the class in Arizona yesterday
I was responsible for that. I told him to do it. You did okay? Well, you know, I just I wanted to talk about this election a little bit
Meal because I think that this guy
Bush is the scariest
Individual since Nixon yeah, and what's here for the most
I think that was done
That says oh, it doesn't matter the president doesn't really have that much to do with running things
I mean what planet is that guy from he's the leader of this party
He's supposed to be the leader of the free world and bush thinks foreign affairs and having sex in the other country
And this guy doesn't think that that's reasoning up the vote against him
I listen and there are people are assholes out there who rationalize their their indifference the refusal of doing anything
refusal to go both now rationalize it away and say it doesn't make any more changing
Well, I'm saying because the Bush's tax program near look
I make more money than using money and I could
spend that tax cut real well, but yeah, I think it's I think it's a way
They could spend it they could spend it a whole lot better
improving the country
Then giving it to a bunch of rich assholes already having enough money anyway
First another thing about the damn Republicans there would be about $60 million more money in the in the surplus if they would have left
Boba hello
You got it and
And
Okay, thanks and Bush has always thought about well we believe that your money it's your money
Well, that was $60 million about mine did anybody ask us if we
Were pre-impermanent to spend it anybody ask us oh no
They just went ahead and peed it down the toilet like it was coming out of a faucet $60 million
That we have kids with no textbooks to take home in big county and kids over there and to a soda who are standing with no
With no places to sit down with no desk
I'm
Gonna say it again, and I don't give a damn what any of you say or what you think this country doesn't care about its kids as it's pathetic
You don't care about kids period maybe you care about your own kids and in some cases probably don't
criminal
For all these policies is get up there all we got to take care of the kids and we got to a AM give a flying crap
They can find money up the ass. They have an endless supply. It's under mattresses
It's in some guy them or look how they just found out in Ross Perot's ears somewhere they find money for all kinds of crap
So all this will be is about education and about building new schools. I was a when the hell is that start when does it start
And please don't tell me boys are there from Texas with always Tony Belonis statistics there that he's gonna be the ones
He never got an education himself and he's making a speech up there in
We haven't heard was they counted this morning and they showed I'm 10 and a little while ago and here's the audience this old old fart audience
But wait for I get to a good news for him in a minute the people are like him little kids and old farts
And they're all the old guys with their VFW and American Legion hats on and I'm thinking to myself
What kind of a veteran respects this guy who finished during Vietnam who was supposedly on an Alabama in the National Garden that didn't show up for whole guy them year
Who the hell are you kidding and the military they're respecting in the same people that gave bubble crap because of the fact you pose the war in Vietnam which so did a lot of other people a good people with conscience
So if the old craggy veterans they're the ones that are big on WF or whatever reason
Because of the Republican elephant blood in their system and here's even better news if kids were both for president next month George W would be
Al Gore-Handley 55 to 45%
At least that's true for the kids who watch Nickelodeon and participate in next kids vote national poll
Which delivered a good news to go about abortion especially audition of nick news 8 30 p.m. Sunday
And Nickelodeon survey of kids is batting a thousand. It predicted one of each of the last three presidential campaigns. Well, we'll be do. That's what a slick in it
331,000 kids almost all between the ages of six and rather participated in this thing
So little kids are dumb enough to like bush and all the craggy veterans
With their WFW caps on
We respect the guy who just high-tailed it and disappeared going on a prolonged drunk
Doing the war in Vietnam
Here's a mobile and full-water day. Oh, yeah, yes, sir
Here's the greatest indication of girls momentum the Iowa electronic electronic markets
Which is a real money futures market. Yes, sir. Okay, after Labor Day
Girl has been ahead up until the last debate when his stock dropped
Bush's stock rose okay and two days ago Bush's stock was at a high of 65% well guess what
Today his stock has dropped all the way to 51% courses now up at 49% and it's rising
Okay, people are putting their money on the line. Okay. That's what this is about
This Iowa electronics market. That's where the contract pay up for bad. It depends on who wins the president. It's winner takes all yeah
Okay, I'll see you in Vegas. Did you get me to make a shot?
What the hell is he talking about?
See I do that's the same up. Yeah
We okay guy. Yeah, okay
Okay
Okay, it's okay
He's okay
He's just a little bit hyper
152 votes in our pool who do you hate the most love them both 93 George 43 hate to both equally eight and four nils only got seven
I'm in last place god that it
That's okay
152 votes that you like the H2 like point but you say it's different because if you you were taking the pull that you were filling in
Then it will be just the odd other way around
No, they still hate it. Oh, they know okay
21 before one is five sixty wqway well that's because you're killing he's a killing he's a killing
He's really nick a lot
How is it is about like a sad that doing he trials off here
He's been helping guys killing that ball spot and doing a spectacular job over the pregnancy
So myself over 25 years here's another piece of copy that we're definitely trying to get an answer on from Troy
And Troy the boy that he ever we spawn to your question about no, and seriously do they ever respond to your question
About whether the discount is $200 off or 300 off because we played remember I mentioned that to you there today when you play that paid spot and
It's so busy
So check out Charles Alpheer's new skin like hair system. It looks so great
It's a hundred percent on thankful because it looks like the hair's going on in a scale here
With that ball spot forever without any dangerous pills without her building your head without him how she looking with you
Twice your assistant for 30 days if you don't love the way it looks feels and smells return it for a full refund
And if you call matching you heard about here on the new Roger show Charlie will not
Off the regular price. Well, I don't know whether it's 200 or 300
Because our salespeople won't give us any guidance and information because this sales department now has reached
Just when we thought it couldn't get any lower it's reached
Locked bottom they refuse to give us any information and wait period is running around the building or
Yeah, yeah, that a boy Ray. Yeah, I took a dump next to way a couple of days ago. Remember that I told you no
Oh, yeah, it was in there. We were a twin whores there side by side. That's your time. I've spoken to him about the year and a half
So it's pink yeah and the dump too
But Neil Roger show sports radio five sixties
You
Listen to me. I want your show
Oh
Any question
When he
I'm gonna fill in the next four years
Whether go hard for us we still have a fear politician to sell incense here never quite is on
This is a with a fear shake hand to give babies our kids and later on up to something so
Can't the last no wonder we're all so confused
They get how old and terrible it's that thing of you
That's what we will never again need the trade like a matter and teach the problem
Hey, cross your fingers with day by after a lecture day
It was the story of a girl
But to the president for a world
That you can feel glad and runny bad that we never did recover when he lies
That's good good
The
161 votes
28 the most George Neil love and both hate them both equal
Love them both 94 George 49
Oh, look at what I look what I got up to now the ice and hit him both equally eight
She asked a question about hate and they're just like that they're rabbit. Oh, I can't get in that guy didn't to the fast enough man
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AP and T and Verizon wireless. I can't stand up
I don't think I personally but that's the way see we play that combo and it shouldn't do that
That panther thing because they got the guys voice a new PA guy
I don't hate him because I don't know me maybe a very nice guy, but his work blows. I mean he's bad
The other guy was great. So we put you in a few names big deal
He was great. He was like partly on beyond so we got used to it's just like when they fired J. Wilkich with a Marlin and look what happened to the attendance
All vanished
Yeah, soon as John Henry thought I'd he was yours that was your real peach
That's right
George put him up to him
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on it. Oh, that's right. All the Jews are voting on there. I couldn't figure it out
Here's Western hello. Oh, good morning. Yes, sir
That question, you know, all these people who are complaining to be aftertaste because they say that both
People are both of the candidates are non-presidential. Yeah, I have to look at the fact that Gore has been for eight years
Has been making policy decisions and you may not agree with them all the time
But if he has been a major part of the executive branch there
That is correct and George stop you on the other hand
If I was a Republican and I've been a registered director over 20 years
But I'm the Republican if this is the guy that the party boss is considered to be the best guy to win the election
That's embarrassing. Yeah, but in the meantime is either even or ahead right now
Which goes to show how many people are locked up with that type of mentality?
Who's locked up and who's that?
And you're that, right?
Okay, and I have two questions though
One that I was talking about the misery index which I thought was well, but is I think like my pathologist misery index finger and two
What's the controversy about Shankar eradication?
See you later. Okay
Well, we know what he's got his mind though. Don't get so about it pal
Got a few other lines on here like six or seven
But what's the service got nightline? Oh, it's a middle of their lunch hour over there
But they always say we'll drop everything will be right over
Remember they always say call on us anytime and here it is. It's almost one o'clock
And I don't want to be eating a whole bunch of stuff before I go to get my therapy on my hand that is
Because I don't want you know, let me to be sitting there squeezing and all of a sudden. Oh gee, I got a sigh
Yeah, try to make a mad dash for that room
Can I tell a rather unique story about that mommy? It's not all that bad
But I was waiting for my um my on doctor Dr. Birkewitz back when I was doing the thing with a cast a few weeks ago
I'm going to wait in the room and there's all these people in there the average agent is about 150 to death and
All of a sudden I had to go take a leak. Okay?
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay and they got a restroom
They're coming why am I eating these they're killing me
So I gotta take a leak
And I get up and I walk across the woman I open the door. It's unlocked open door the restroom
And here's an old I'd say about 140-year-old lady sitting on the crapper, you know
And didn't even give me like a stab look away
And they're just sitting there oblivious and I thought oh excuse me and I kind of like kicked her away and closed the door
There these amazing things and that door does have one on its weirder because I checked
They're called locks. They don't go with dagels that they're called locks
Always a weird bit idea even if you're 145 years old when you're in a public place like that
It's to turn a little lock on the door
Unless you're looking for an audience
Here's why I hate from somewhere hello
Hello hello yes sir
And you know how are you today good?
I'm calling from Florida to listen to the show for the last hour of hour and a half for so and he's got a couple of comments. Okay
Um first of all on the pappers if they just played a long go they might have a chance to win again
They probably how do they play how do they win a game without screwing any girls
Well if the long go can shut them out
Why do you have to do is put in one he shut
I'm gonna sort of Sunday and they didn't put in one the worst thing in the league you can put in one
Well, that's up to burry. Yeah, the so
A one-man offense
Well, he's got guys there to back him up
Such as such as the other Russian
But don't know a man like that to complain hockey. Yeah
Meanwhile on the on the presidential raid. Uh-huh. I agree with every word that she said on
uh
To put bush in there as as the
presidential candidate is a joke if I can just make a couple of comments
Uh the most ineffectual aborted incentive drop of tedious
Trite arduous arduous montane
Reprobate
With pacimons
Have said your real worth of actualism
Pacific
Equations. Yeah, what's the most quick? Okay, thanks
5 6 7 0 5 60 what do you say about eglary on offer maybe we start about Victor Kraslov while I was Russian
Do you start about maybe we start about what's your name
Anna Kovar
Kovar you 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless one we're a c-span where we need him. Oh god damn it
You blew it George. We needed them in here today
We'll go and do
Whenever you grade
Here's a mobile and full-water nail. Huh? Yeah, I'm glad you found the marlin's attendance problem and they're able to dip that in the bus
Yeah, maybe that's the issue with the two presidents
Which public schools are their kids go to? Yeah
Okay, number two obviously there was a private school
Correct. We need to believe that the government whenever they do provide a service
Which one of us better than nothing? i.e. Medicaid, Medicare, etc
And yeah, they have a social security for retirement
I'm warm and fully feeling. Have a good day
Anybody know what he just said? Oh, no, he's with the government blower's which of course he's right about that
But that the don't be clouding the issue, okay?
Don't be given people a reason excuse because that's the way I felt a few weeks ago
That's not sufficient. That's not going to get the job done
Yeah, it's a real crappy choice and people are getting real tight hearing about it especially on the show
Or supposed to be having a really great time and sticking our finger up each other's active laughing in the trolling
What does that stuff come out of this game
stuff
Saxes from the other machine why are they coming in the other machine?
Because because our people are getting a stupid of the sport there's oh boy. That's really bad
Here's your fuel beach. Oh, just saw John McCain
Something for the shrub up in Jacksonville Florida. Yeah, I think he on with that melanoma might have steeped into his body
He's just gonna say he's still got that big thing on his side of his head. Yeah, sure
That's that's all you need to know you to love that this morning on feet span, you know the Prince of virtues
And I would say built that it oh god
He's got more chimps in a Chinese phone. We're seeing a high-mercumular together never
But anyway one of the first calls into him said
mr. Bennett I know you're a very religious man and you're a champion of virtues
You believe in the sin of gluttony and he said well, yes, I do he said that's enough set
There's a hung up. Yeah, because he's a plucker. I think I hear that he's been doing the pulp. That's what I'm hearing
Maybe just a rumor that's what I'm hearing that they're doing it
By the way if you've seen Jane Paulie recently on television now
I think she's been getting into the chunky monkey really she's really put it on
Maybe she's hanging out with watching them over there in channel six. What's an anger?
Our good friend on channel six news that ways had to be a little bit of a cray
Oh god, yeah, I even blocked it out of my mind
Cray because we like this almost but she was she with a 420 now these days
Come on, guys, listen, Neil. Yes, one last thing. I gotta get I gotta give this website again
You gotta go see it. It's barcops.com if you hate fat tick-bots if you hate Dr. War and if you hate
Sure, the shrub that's the website to go barcops the a rt c o p dot com. Okay, okay, see you
Okay, we got 7080 open lines now in the seven minutes ago before bootshumber comes in and graces you hear Miss Julio and Hank
Goldberg show lots of lots of open lines waiting for your perspicacious comments things that the people of America will really be proud to hear on
C-SPAN and CNN and Fox News and MSNBC things that really will put you guys on the map and sure America just how articulate and
the impuny all were the events of the day
Anybody buying that? No, here's a mobile in Parkland. Hello. Yeah, I got a comment in a joke boy. You know, Joe's comment
Okay, comment is I've I've just gotten about four phone calls and about 30 different flyers from Bush
talking about how he's so wonderful
And how he's gonna do wonderful things the United States
I have not gotten one phone call or one piece of mail from
Gore and Lieberman. I don't know if they think they can rest on their laurels and you know something
I'm glad you mentioned that because I talked the other day about seeing a Bush or a Chinese
A sign on the lawn of one of my neighbors their couple of years of blocks away. I haven't seen one grower
Lieberman bumper sticker not one sign not nothing
I just thought if they opened up their Broward distribution center
How goers.com has all the information on it. Okay
Thanks. Thank you
Also if you want to grow bumper stickers, I just find that number the Jonathan the semi yesterday
It's 305 438 1483 and they get the address of the office nearest them
Where they can pick up their bumper stickers, pensions, etc
And why the hell they're not out there. I have no idea
What are you waiting for waiting for like the week after the election?
But it's pointless
305 438 1483 and they'll tell you where to go leave me
And it goes back to what I said before the right wing is the zealots they're motivated man
You can smell it you can feel
You can see the form in the corners of their mouth at least I think it's form
They're rabbit they got rabbis
And rest of the people wow I don't know
Yeah, you better you better get motivated pretty soon. It's a guy be in 25th of October last time
I checked and the election is to be from yesterday
You better wake up and split the guy dead dandy lines, okay?

101 at 560 WDQA and that's the best
Just got this on the fast machine
Governor George W Bush under record
This is from a website
www.bushandguns.com
All one word Bush and guns.com
On May 26, 1995 Governor Bush fulfilled a campaign promise
By signing in the law measure the laws
Texas citizens for the first time
In a 125 years to carry a concealed weapon
Two years later when 1997 Bush sounded up
A carrying concealed weapons law
CCW
That removes churches, hospitals, nursing homes
That amusement park from most of the places
Which prohibit concealed weapons
Let's read him again okay
Churches, hospitals,
Nursing homes, amusement parks
From most of the places that prohibit concealed weapons
Then on June 19, 1999
Just two months after the mass shooting
At Kalaban High School in Kalaban
Right over the claim 15 lives
Governor Bush I get another irrational law
This time borrowing Texas cities and counties
From suing the gun industry
To recover damages they incur as a result
Of gun violence
So for Schmendrick there in Miramar
And all you other gun squeezes out there
He's your man, baby
He's your man rather than riding in on his wild horse
Nothing like taking a piece to the amusement park
Here's a mobile in Hollywood, hello
Mobile in Hollywood
Hello, Mr. McEy
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale, hello
Yes, I don't know if you're listening to me or not
Hello
I'm listening
Okay great, I wanted to let you know that the gourd
Leatherman signs are all over
Potts of Fort Lauderdale
If you go from Rower to Sunrise
You'll see them all up in the yards and the businesses
And the yard signs can be obtained by going to a restaurant
And Wilton Manor's called Storks
Which is located off the Wilton Manor drives in 15
Okay
And I just want to say one more thing
I think that Gour should bring
Clinton on the campaign trail with him
At least a couple of days
To energize the base
I said bring it
Go ahead
I'm sorry
Go ahead
I was going to say
The people who ate Clinton
And would be offended by that
Are not going to vote for Gour anyway
That's right
But what Clinton can do is energize the base
That's what we need
You got it
All right, thank you
Thanks a lot
Okay, there you go
Of course, out by me out there in West Howard
A lot of Yahoo's
That's why I don't see any Gour signs
Or bumpers, stickers, or anything out there
Maybe it's prohibited
Probably the mayor said no way in Jose
Or the police chief
Or both
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60
5, 60 on the AT&T
And Verizon Wireless Line
Here's cut the ridge, hello
Not now
Yes, sir
Talking about the other day at Chicago
And the real north there is that
If Bush and Cheney win the election
Cheney is going to resign for medical reasons
Yeah
That means the cave is going to be vice president
Okay
Jim McKay
Yeah Jim McKay is going to be vice president, right
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, fine
Well, why didn't he or not
Jim McKay, huh?
He's seen him come and go
He's done a lot of horse and around
He must know where
When there's brother and law
When it give us Xerox
Here's a mobile and summarize, hello
No, yes, sir
Hi, I wanted to call because I was on hold
Making a phone call to think Lewis
A little bit ago
And I was listening to you all morning
And all these people calling in about these
new ads that Bush is running
About gore taking away the second amendment
I hadn't heard anything hadn't seen anything
I'm on hold with 98
Why 98 in St. Louis
And they had an ad that was Chalton Heston
With like the end of the world
speech how gore is going to remove your second amendment
Because the second amendment doesn't say this
And doesn't say that
And if he gets elected
He's going to put in his three Supreme Court
Justices
And you know that if he has his
Justices and his system will go the way he wants it to
And then they even go further
To tell you what would be
If one of if the three Supreme Court
Justices that he put in were Hillary Clinton
And I forgot who the other two are
Could you imagine and that's how it ends
Yeah
Holy Kent and Clinton go cross the enraged lower problems
It's that's I I was very shocked in here
I'm glad to hear because it sounds like they're desperate to me
If they got a trot that will fossil out there
That gun potent fossil
Then the end of all
It must be getting desperate
It's been talking to if he was almost dead
Yeah
He will be soon
Okay thanks for the good news
I'm glad to hear it
Thanks
Wow
Chalton Heston huh
He was so about Ben
Moses Ben her Ben him
I said
I wonder if he knew about Tony Curtis in that movie
Sparta Cruz
Jerry Oyster's old name
Oh
5670560
Palm 560 on the AT&T
And Verizon Wireless Line
Here's a mobile in Miami, huh
Neil
Yes sir
Hey Neil first time caller love you show
All right
Don't if we always raise you but anyway
The question that I have for you sir is the following
Go ahead and
When is all the anti-gunners
When I wake up
There's no the coffee
And understand that this is the whole line
What is it
So this is will never lie
You're right
That's the state of the public
Public gun laws are
Washington DC where blah blah is
And New York City
And yet
The same states have the highest crime rates
Is that steep for himself or not
Crime, the crime of violent crime in New York is way, way down
I don't know where you're getting your statistics
Sounds like fuzzy math to me
Well let me tell you I mean
Over and over again
You can tell me anything you want
But it sounds like you're just making it up
No it's not sir it's it's a fact that
Washington DC has the strongest
And New York City you can't like the work done
If he's a pick without getting arrested
And yet I mean that their crimes are out of control
No they're not
They are not
You're absolutely wrong about that
The crime in New York City is way, way down dramatically
In fact violent crime in America is way down in the last eight years
From endlessly down
So all these people
All these people talking about how crime is
Will be handled so much better by Bush
I guess the thing he's going to execute
Everybody but if that's what he's going to do
If you have a seven-level
If you pick somebody's pocket
Kill him
If you J-Walk
Kill him
If you speed more than 10 miles over the speedrunners
Kill him
At least we just deserve was population
I like going W
Although we can't we have to do that to
To balance out the fetuses that we're going to be saving
The W in there say
I'll be on Monday fetuses
All the babies that he's going to force you women to make
I'll say it again
You show me a woman for Bush
And I'll show you it's like it's like
Fags for Bush
No difference than Jews for Hitler
Say exactly the same thing
No difference whatsoever
See we didn't know we didn't know he was going to send us to camp
With Bobbi offenses
So I'll get fucking blow
I've been going to my house
You're fast asleep
I can't trust you
There's no one to use your time
All that's to say
How did this day go?
It's like the stuff that's made me
Can't even talk to Jews
That's why I go
I'm waiting for a seat at the base of time
Jews
Everyone please do Mantel
Perfect
Right
We were sold into money
Sold to Anyone
We ran all over the river
Like that
I'll be going to next day
Oh, okay.
We're having a good time here today, baby.
One 13 is 560 WQAM.
Oh, yeah, I did hear that rumor that the Ranger Texas Rangers almost went out of business
because he kept starting up the truck at a first and two base lines.
That's where I'm hearing.
Here's a lady mobile and boy and beach.
Hi, Neil. How are you?
I'm doing good.
That's good.
My husband and I were trying to get through you after the last debate.
It was kind of funny.
I know you watched the focus cute group right afterwards.
Oh, good.
Do you remember the guy that said, I'm a teacher?
I like what boys said.
What?
And then, let's just say you're going to vote for me just, oh no, I've done that.
I prefer Bush's policies on guns.
I don't understand it.
You're going to give up your livelihood to carry a gun.
Yeah.
I just kind of was totally mind-boggling.
And we're glad to see that you're involved because I was really nervous back then when you said you weren't going to go out and vote.
Well, well, it wasn't easy.
I know, but it's the rest of two evils.
And the other thing is, it's funny that James Cardon has not been involved at all in this in Gorge's campaign.
And it's because his close ties to Clinton are always upon negative life.
Really?
Yeah, and I think because he was interviewed and I guess they're asking him about the strategy for Gorge's campaign.
And he's like, if I were doing it, this is what I said.
And we decided he needed to be in a backroom, James, where no one knew where you were.
And he needed to be plotted from the get-go.
Right.
Because it's careful, but I still think he's going to pull it out.
It's getting a little better every day.
I hope, and I really, it's like I'm sitting here going, oh my god, how any woman, how anyone who is gay, be a Republican, I just don't got it.
Anyone who's black?
Yeah, I thought so.
Anybody who's anything but a smart person?
Anyone, anybody who's Hispanic, I've been in the green tooth or Cuban's down in Miami?
Okay, I'll get you there.
Anyway, I have a great day in Yale and let's go board.
Okay.
Take care, bye.
See you in that park.
I'll be wandering around looking for where I stick my pool.
5.67, 05.60, oh that's what happened to that guy, that's the trout guy.
Remember, James Dopson's the right in, right in the 10th man.
He was up there looking to where he stick his pool.
How unusual, I can't, I can't, I can't be getting excited, the sexual side of specs I get from just reading those stories.
Every time I do these pony baloney, right wing, finger pointing, assholes, guppinale, and oh, James, guess what?
Gotcha.
Yeah, all right, all the finger pointing, they find that their finger is in somebody else's rectum.
Wow, how about that?
So it's your change of descent.
Here's a mobile in the sunrise, so.
Hey, you know, how you doing?
Pretty good.
Hey, love your show.
If you stop back in the car, you had mentioned, I heard you guys talking about presidential bumper stickers.
Yeah.
Other, not many of the gold leave them in, it's up there.
A few, there's a website that has thousands of them for actually both sides.
Presidentialstickers.com, and they range from like the conventional all the way down to the unconventional.
Okay.
Like one of them I remember, because you're not Jay, even though you don't like Bush.
Both.
Yeah, that's the point of them on there, and I just figured out, hey.
All right, thank you.
Thanks a lot.
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.
Out of town, look at that, there's a call from Delray Beach, hello.
Very new.
Yes, sir.
Yo, what's up?
Oh, that guy called up and said that New York and Washington DC, Washington DC, does have a high crime rate.
The reason New York City don't have a high crime rate is no more, because they have one heck of a ban.
New York, they've been picked up by no games.
That's right.
Yeah, they arrest people for Jay walking in there now.
They put them in death row.
Oh, if you want them out of the death penalty.
When it comes to locking people up for Jay walking, that's California.
That's Angerly San Francisco, got the most stringent Jay walking would know if they're out.
That's a hobby in LA is walking, taking a step off the curb and forcing the people to sign on their brakes.
If you want to be brave enough to do that, still bring that to you in LA.
That's your problem, but you will be riding up road there.
Very cute.
Not like I think a lot of people, like in Spirf, you okay, my friend?
Thank you.
Whatever you said.
You end the dark neighborhoods.
I don't want to say it to him because I don't want to say it to him.
But the dark neighborhoods out there in LA, I don't know if they still do it.
But they like to hang out in the middle of the street and then dare you like, you know, just stop traffic.
They do it here.
In the dark neighborhoods, what are you doing in the dark?
Because you said find out working on this is not a dark neighborhood.
No, no, this is a Jamaican neighborhood.
Yeah, yeah.
They're not dark.
They're not like mocha.
They're not real dark.
Aren't they?
You haven't seen that Cleo commercial?
Cleo?
Cleo, the Taro lady.
Who that's called?
Who that's called?
She'd be Jamaican.
No, that's right.
I forgot she's a Jamaican.
Yeah.
I love that.
Cleo, she'd be my favorite.
And whatever happened to show a grip, and I guess they finally had dumped her as bad ass off of her, huh?
Since they found out that they were getting all these fortune colors from the Salvation Army or whatever.
Here's a mobile and popular.
Hello.
Yes, they all have you heard any more about Larry Flint and his ex-husay of Abelish?
No.
Nothing?
Not a word.
We're still waiting.
I mean, I said we're still waiting.
We're still holding our breath.
Yeah, I hope something comes on with this thing.
incidentally, what's the name of Phil Downey who has been doing the funding for...
Neater.
...Nater.
And if you heard what they said yesterday, I thought his veins were very come out of his throat.
How he attacked the fact that we're giving money to the killers of Palestinians and all that sort of crap that's in both Nater and Hexboz.
They both were ramping and raiding him.
That's the fact that we stopped giving money in the world of Finnish, and that's definitely being out of Israel.
Because they are the ones with the guns and the other ones only have stones.
And I guess he's rid of the bombersport.
I think he forgot all about the fact that there's an Alishovah.
They're also with the carry gun.
Yeah.
Okay.
Speak for itself.
Yes, Phil Downey, you just say...
Just say...
Oh, the Phil.
And just say...
Oh, the Nater.
If you want to say...
Oh, the Buchanan, that's okay if you're going to vote for Bush instead.
Yeah, let's get those Buchanan people out there.
I think he's got a real clear message from America.
In fact, there was going to be a little bit of...
Yeah.
That's past message.
If you like those footballs...
If you want to go to the blue...
Huh?
Then you'll absolutely go.
Pat.
What is it?
To my mention, my name's right master Go.
Anyway, I'll pull questions today.
Who do you hit the most on the show?
George 71.
Neil 11.
Height and both equally 11.
But London both are 118.
I really like that.
They're in 11 mood today.
They love us.
Can't you tell by these calls?
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Miami.
Hello.
Yes, sir?
Hey, you know, I registered as a Republican when I was 18.
I always voted Republican, but I don't think I'm going to vote Republican this time.
And I have probably a real lame reason why, but when I was watching the debates a few weeks ago...
Yeah.
When they asked Bush about the problems in the environment, they asked the same question to both guys, and they asked them what would he do?
And he kept going, well, I was opposed to Vice President Gore.
I would do further studies to prove that this and that.
Like, you need more proof that there's holes in the ozone layer, there's pollution, and there's deep forestry.
And just for that simple reason, basically honest, I'll probably vote for Gore.
But that's not the main reason why I called.
Okay.
We have a business in Miami and we put an ad in the paper for employee.
You know, an hired to employees.
And I guess a job placement agency read the same ad and they factored it over.
You know how they would help us fill our positions.
There are an employment agency.
And the letter on the back was, we have employees from all positions from blue color to white color.
They may go down the list of communications to hospitality, but not blue color to white color.
Hey, look what you can do to stand out in the crowd, man.
I'll tell you the truth.
Well, I'm looking for a real good blue person to, you know, or white color person could come down and help us out.
No, what's your fact number?
What is your fact number, Georgia?
Because I want you to see this so you can, but so you can see that we got.
501 98.
What is it?
650198.
650198.
Oh, what's that?
505, dig County 305.
The audio is great.
Thanks.
Sent some of those blue people over here.
Huh?
That's why we're getting blue.
567, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
And you have a built-in, got two jobs in a white house.
We got to bring morality back.
Who are you people kidding?
All these goody two shoes we got to bring morality back.
Yeah.
Like Roosevelt and his mistress and Nelson Rockefeller, that could republican with his mistress.
Of course, he was too liberal for them.
And Nixon with his Chinese girlfriend.
And God don't know about Bush.
He sure couldn't have been doing Martha Washington all the time.
He had to be spreading it around.
Although I don't remember.
There was a thing about Bush.
I almost forgot about that.
There was a he had the thing going.
They all got their thing, but back in those days, people had enough common sense to realize
that they're just people and they take up practice like everybody else and they put their pantaloonies on one look at a time just like we do.
And keep your nose out of their goddamn clock and everybody would be a hell of a lot better off for it.
And it was an interesting how they still have the hoods, but to keep running around screaming about that about this morality,
which is just code for penis game.
And they just seem to have forgotten about Bob Bob Livingston and Henry Hyde and Dan Burton and his illegitimate son.
And all these other crony baloney and Bob Balman there with a 50 year old kid in Maryland.
All good Republicans.
See, I hate to break the doors here.
Just like that buddy there of James Dobson for a lot of the, I hate to break this to you boys and girls.
They better, you better buckle yourselves in for the exciting news.
But even Republicans have a penis.
Yeah.
How do you like that?
Including some of the Republican women like this Philoshoof-Y with her gay son.
Don't hear too much from our Philos anymore, do we?
And how about the Chinese with their bourbon-like daughter that is kind of hovering one toe in and one toe is out?
It must be kind of a dangerous position.
Kind of straddling that line you know I'm talking about with one foot in and one foot out.
Here's the lady mobile and color red.
Yes, hi Neil.
Yes ma'am.
I listen to all the time.
I know both you and George and George does a good job when you're not there.
The best.
The best. You got that right.
So I wanted to say I'm out of material.
But listen to all the time.
Okay, thanks.
Got ice.
What do you say?
She said 5.6705.60, 0.560.
How's that pull coming?
And I wish I'd get this message off here from power out of this space.
Better tell kids, screw me about that.
When you go down the hall and pee in his food, come there also out of this space on the same thing.
He's got nothing to do with that.
Oh, who does?
Oh, I forgot.
I know who has nothing to do with that.
It's probably Bob Vermouth.
Is that who has nothing to do with it?
That piece of crap.
Redneck.
Yahoo.
Neanderthal.
Piece of turd.
Walking turd on legs.
I just want to go on and look at again as making sure everybody knows.
Here is the corporate chief engineer who in the three years plus that we've been on this station.
I was done everything in his power to make sure that we fail.
And in spite of him, we did it.
I knew you like that.
Everything and anything that we needed, we couldn't have it.
Where's number one, Jimmy?
In spite of him and his crappy redneck attitude.
And if ever there was anybody perfect for the beesleaves in their corporate Neanderthal mentality,
this company, he's it.
He beat it.
Bob Vermouth.
Have another drink, Bob.
God.
If you look up the word, Trotterly right in the dictionary, you'll see his plus right next to it.
And his face too.
20th place after one is 560 WQF.
The Neil Roger Show Sports Radio.
560.
Q.A.
This is a bunch of hoots.
Wow.
How you doing, honey?
This is no fun in the present on the island.
This is my favorite blue women dress.
I'm not a few girls who stuff that was pretty, huh?
The billies here to tell you about girls.
They're not.
They used to wear makeup and ripped the white pants.
The women, this may not wear under my dress.
Wow.
You take your pants off.
Wow.
You take your pants off.
Wow.
So, Paula Jones, you got a new nose.
That moment does me much.
Well, you got the money.
That of you got the touch.
And I'll get the money.
Well, I'll bring you all right.
But that won't give me one.
That no man will want tonight.
That no impressed me much.
When you want to show me.
I'll take you another little girl.
She had a pay-break order and she kept on her phone.
And after she ate steak, she would bury the bone.
She got herself a wife all end up.
Tell me, time.
But she still has a way ever.
I can't put it.
Well, she's a better person.
Well, she's a better person.
So, in the trip, got some surgery.
That no man impressed me much.
Well, you got the money.
But if you got the touch.
That's okay.
Well, yeah, I'll bring you all right.
But that won't give me one.
That no man will want tonight.
That no man impressed me much.
All right, you forgot me, Paula.
Yeah, I'm on this next one.
A vague, chunky girl with a furt of the right.
That man, yeah, dressed nearly to be one.
Well, quick with ratings on my car with no more.
I could have told Wilk Jamer went on a score.
Well, I'm on this next day with a man on this next show.
Well, she's a better person.
Monica, you lost 40 times.
That no impressed me much.
Well, you got the ring.
Well, you got the touch.
And now I got the roll.
Well, I'll bring you all right.
But that won't give me one.
That no man will want tonight.
No.
All right, I'll bring you all right.
That no impressed me much.
I'm on this next show.
Well, I tried to cut the brakes on her car.
No offense, but I think I'd rather sleep with Gennestor.
Once you get burned, I'll blink her off strings and hatch.
They go away and then ask them that.
Oh, I can't make it.
So, I just like you so good at that.
So, Hillary, you're going to be a son of her from the York.
Not known impressed me much.
Well, you got the ring.
Not if you got the touch.
And now I got you all right.
But now I get that one.
And now I'm on this next show.
That no impressed me much.
Thank you.
And that is my second win on the dress.
And I'm on the mute.
The latest president in the history of my life,
I'll turn that right now.
I was watching him on the news last night and I thought to myself,
he is the best.
He is.
I mean, I was only a little kid when Roosevelt died in 45.
I was like, so what did I know?
I mean, we had Truman and I was still a little kid.
And he was kind of like a dumb farmer anyway.
Who was just crude and they liked that.
Give him hell, Hillary.
And then we know that he dropped a bomb on the Jeff Justice Skier's stallion
and that they were already trying to surrender.
Now we're going to drop the bomb.
Justice Skier, that asshole.
They had it covered.
Yeah, that's right.
A bunch of geek groups.
Well, I have, if it's good enough for John McCain to say they're groups,
why can't he say it?
Because he was tortured by that.
And then we had the illiterate Dwight Eisenhower who had a lot of interest in all these certain things.
They're very interested.
Illiterate.
And then what?
What do you have to, then we had Kennedy while we had Kennedy.
Yeah, Kennedy.
Who wasn't president long enough to really make a judgment,
but they sure had a good time in their while they were in there.
Talk about getting a couple of blow jumps.
They were a last at bubble.
I mean, oh man, this guy is a joke.
And take a look at the pigs that he's doing to on top of it, you know,
or a pike, or at least the Kennedys had better taste.
And then we of course, to follow that with Johnson,
who was nothing but an Eagle maniac.
You know, a lot of it social programs, but in the meantime,
bringing 50,000 kids back in body bags, probably outweighed that.
You know what I'm saying?
About LVJ.
Errogant Prick.
There's another one who was like a schlepper,
and all of a sudden he made all this money.
A while he was in politics, made millions and millions,
and brought up all these radio TV stations in Texas.
The defense contractors, all these buddies.
All these cooks in Texas, man, the Johnson's and the Bush's.
And then of course, well, then we had Dick and Nixon too.
Who in retrospect?
In retrospect, if it wasn't for the fact that he was paranoid and psychotic
and all these other things, I wasn't really all that bad, you know.
Yeah, he looked at that kind of like Dick.
And then after him, we had the dumbest man in the history of the human race.
So the dumbest man who ever walked into the White House,
forget about being president, the dumbest man in there was your four.
Of course, like that.
I mean a moron, a burzo.
What's the most guy?
He makes W look like a rocket scientist.
That's how dumb zero four is and was.
Yes, make no mistake about it.
He was also the one that told us that when he was in Poland,
wasn't the communist dominated country.
He was like, all confused about the...
Yeah, don't you remember that?
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, really?
Yeah, really.
Go back to sleep.
And then we had Jimicardo.
I mean, Jimicardo.
I mean, let's face it.
I mean, from entry.
Every time I see Jimicardo on TV, I think.
I look at what the band you up in the tree, that's what I think of.
And I get to the vision of Billy.
They're peeing on the side of a building somewhere.
Billy Carter.
The last George Quirk.
Billy Beer in the sand or something in the sand.
And then we slowly, even though the 85 layers of wrinkles,
what a claim that was.
There was like something from the Beverly Herbberies that I'll fit.
The Carter's.
And then of course, we had Ronnie who, according to what we know about Ronnie.
But he doesn't remember any of it.
He would just trickle down.
He was the first one, I guess, introduced that really not so compassionate conservatism.
And then we had Bush senior.
W senior.
Bubba blows him all the way.
I think I'm gonna stick about all your Clinton haters out there.
Okay.
You couldn't wipe his ass with both hands.
So here's that ad that I was talking about.
It says we have employed employees for all positions from blue color to white color.
From communication to hospitality, from finance to entertainment.
You are needed.
We got it.
From blue color to white color.
We'll take four blue people and a couple of whites.
Yeah, just to put those parties in your place.
23 before 2 at 5 60 WQM.
That would be good for someday.
Who would you rather have working for?
Dark folks or blue people?
Huh?
That's an excellent question.
I haven't met too many blue people yet, but it's simply something to think about.
How young is too young?
Alright.
I'm a white girl, I'm a white girl, I'm a virgin.
Play all the skulls.
Back with my daughter.
And now my hair and my hair are getting pretty good.
That can't be done.
Seven people to at 5.62 WQM.
Who's Shelby's in the building.
He'll be here filling the hanks shoes and chair.
Or at least part of it, between two and six.
And don't forget, who's going to be the first part of the show,
analyzing Rob Neetamar's very observant comments,
we need to have soft dumps.
That's the answer to the panties.
What?
See what was in the four-way on Reddus?
Rob Neetamar says we need to have soft dumps.
Or maybe hard around to make sure we get it by him.
So let's see if the panties have a few soft dumps.
Those 40 or 50 of us will be at the game tonight.
5.6705.60, 0.560 on the AT&T Inforizon Wireless Line.
Here's Boca.
Hello.
You know this is noodles.
Reminding you, it's a good time for the great taste.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Listen, still don't you.
The best is going crazy.
He's got wild eyes.
He's absolutely nuts.
Yeah.
And I really think there's something going on between him and me.
You know what I mean?
Could be.
Maybe he and Jerry Brown.
Yeah, well they're going to put him in the hatch.
While I've got him out of the house.
He's nuts.
So you'll have to walk.
Okay.
I'll try to walk.
See you.
5.6705.60, where's that noodle?
Will we still have that?
Is it in here?
What is it?
Noodle.
Oh, it's in there.
You said, good time.
40 days.
Great taste.
Neil, this is noodles.
Reminding you that it's always a good time.
Always a great taste.
Well, those were the days when old Greg B. Dell and noodles were groveling around looking for an audience in my show.
Remember those days when they were like, oh yeah.
In church of night.
That's before Greg went to work as a waiter with the stolen country kitchen there on the ceiling road in Hollywood.
And then ran off with the, still the bug man.
Oh, that's what I'm hearing.
I heard they allote together, ran off to Ramada somewhere.
What was it called to make it?
Here's a lady, mobile at Western.
Hello.
Hey Neil.
Yes ma'am.
I'm sure Bush and Letterman.
And he had some high-pollution and Bush was supposed to say that we got a lot of cars in Texas.
Uh-huh.
And then...
What a great answer, huh?
Great answer.
And then he asked him about the death penalty and how many safety nets actually have a death penalty?
Bush said, well, I don't know.
That's what I was talking about.
I read about that before.
He doesn't know.
Isn't that great?
Yeah, both of them.
Well, after we show him our course of origin of the map, maybe we'll walk on that one.
Thanks, sweetheart.
He doesn't know.
See, who get out we just discussed in this during the break when he was in here?
And it's true.
Anybody with even a tiny little brain, we just all continue wondering, how is it possible?
That anyone could vote for this man.
He's not only ignorant, he's unimpressive.
He looks like he just crawled over the sack with that bumpy, a gray hair.
He squints and looks like...
Not to mention, of course, the fact that he's always like,
Ooooooh!
Doing that.
Yeah, with those nasal passages.
Which he thinks has something to do with a goddamn Panama Canal.
Yeah, that's right next to those nasal passages.
Ooooooh!
Oh my god.
What country is that in?
I...
I lack.
I ran as fast as I can to go vote for Gore.
Here's Pepper Pine.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
First of all, I'd like to say that I agree with you on our plans.
I have talked to all the time as I go back to the late 30s.
And they say that Clinton is the best of the team.
I mean, they compare them to our leaders, the leaders.
And those things, they compare the Republican Party as being very, very partisan party.
And some of the people that I talked to, uh,
relays the Republican Party to send them a coffee.
Yeah.
All right.
And I want to say something about Bill McCollum.
You're nothing but a howdy-duty gringo.
Okay.
Of course.
Yeah, Bill McCollum, you're all done, sweetheart.
You guys got a Chinaman's chance in hell.
Where the hell is that thing?
Oh, Christ.
This thing's a piece of crap.
So sick and slow.
Where itself?
Yeah.
At the time you get to it, it's a kind of...
Limp again.
5.6705.60, pound 5.60 on the AT&T, and Verizon wireless line.
We still got 40-50 open lines here.
I know we only got two minutes to go, but it doesn't look too promising right now.
Does it?
No.
Not promising.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
All right.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I'd like to give all those gun loving Julio's out there.
It's quite a different perspective.
I'm from England.
The cold.
Gun loving Julio's?
Yeah, the gun loving.
I don't know.
I don't know.
You've heard from any of them today.
There are some of them, but usually our new years and forth that you are.
But anyway.
Anyway, where are I from?
Anyway.
Yeah, anyway.
Hello.
Yeah.
Where are I from?
We don't have a second amendment.
You don't even have a first amendment.
How could you have a second amendment?
I know.
But what I'm saying is there's no law on the book saying you can only come.
We haven't been subject to.
It all these Americans are white.
We can't own a gun.
What's to stop the government from just taking over and subjectating us to their place?
will and mark as they are these ones with guns. Well, that hasn't happened to us.
And I think another interesting statistic. Yeah, but you we weren't taking over by the
Queen yet. They're working on it like in Vermont, but anyway, it is pretty funny.
If you don't have any people who are killed by guns in the United States in 1998. 50,000.
It wasn't quite that many, but it was over 12,000. Yeah, many were killed in the UK.
82, 22, 22. Yeah, I know as well. I mean, I guarantee that we we too are more people in the good
of weekend here than they kill in all of Europe in six months.
Yeah, they should outlaw guns altogether, the ban them. Right. And all the companies right now
running some call almost places, but they make the guns they should they should obviously
dismantle the gun, make the equipment and try them into grove rooms. Grow really good
cock. A lot of people get high on the line. They're chasing each other. Now you're talking.
Huh? Now I said now you're talking. Is that a suggestion or what? A little or a good weed and maybe
some of that British spotted dick. Absolutely. Okay, I'll tell you something else. Yes. I would
I would ask you that this wiping issue. How to blaring people know when they're done wiping.
By the snow. Back to smell of fingers. They can smell their fingers. That's right. And when you can smell
your fingers, we need paper. Okay, tata. He said, take off for everybody.
Oh, yeah, we're supposed to be excited about it because he's for the criminalization of plot.
We're tourists, though, you know, that's why these young people are jumping on the bandwagon.
So if you had any chance, Ralph, and if you had any reasonable understanding of the world and a foreign policy
like in a real world, instead of all these story, I was going to say, Jerry Brown. He's like a hundred
yards beyond Jerry Brown. He's right here is beyond Jerry Brown in terms of right handedness and foolishness.
And all the impossible unrealistic things that he advocates. So while some of them may sound real good
to a bunch of upon heads out there, the fact is that he's ridiculous. Is that what I just said?
Oh, ridiculous. And somebody in his position can afford to look ridiculous.
Tend before it to it, but that's what we need for the cabinet. Don Coyleon.
Huh? Secretary of the state. I mean, I do like Madeline Lomboy, but I think Don Coyleon's got
to upper hand or the upper aside anyway.
Neil Roger shows sports radio five sixties.
You. Oh, Neil. My queen.
God. Hey. Are you obsessed with sports? Hearing from Baratine's and colleges you've never been to?
Where should things start? You're drawing men call for.
They call. Or maybe it's a four year whole opinion. So you're resort to calling that sport hall radio show for there.
But you need something to do in the clean game. Don't you? And you're being forced to fix.
Where does this great hall just drop down?
Just drop down. Just drop down.
Just drop down.
Just drop down. Just drop down.
Just drop down.
Surround yourself with sports inside and out with the satisfying K-Step growing Jews.
Just drop down is individually wrapped sticks of yellow ground, sorted in the flavor of your taste with athletes.
So embrace the dumbbells and enjoy a long lasting flavor of Fingeel dress.
Just drop down. Just drop down. Just drop down. Just drop down.
God's that way. We're all flavor doing. I'll sort out. Okay. Here. I want to read it again before the day is over when maybe two.
Two Lieberman should have been read this to by somebody.
So on that Kennedy, I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute where no religious body sees to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace where every man is the same way to attend or not attend the church of his choice.
That's what it's all about you, Lieberman. Not trying to force your God-bull craft on everybody else and trying to give us a big star in advance because you're a professional Jew with a mz.
Deep inside your ass.
God, I can't stand him. I guarantee that if we had somebody else on the ticket beside you, Lieberman, go and be 15, 20, 80 points ahead right now.
You know what I'm saying? Easy.
Christ, almighty. How do they do it? What do they find these losers? Michael do Kaka?
What you have to do is look at him and you say, oh, you people kidnay. Put him on TV for quite a stand on 16 telephone books.
There's a fact that says I'm in favor of neo hosting in November 70 election. You show in November 6th, there's choice.
Yeah, we're going to have an election show here on QAM. No, you crazy. Also, how about that NASDAQ? That's only down about 143 points. What do you want?
Don't you understand the forces of money? You've got to drive that thing down between our election day. They got a satellite hell and drive that down.
So everybody gets into a panic about the guy they market and thinks the economy's going to crap. That's what it's all about.
Here's Virginia key. Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
Hey, you mentioned earlier about you never met a blue person.
Oh, yes. Do you know not? Not anyone.
There's a lack of a better word to call him as a tribe of people up in the foothills of Kentucky.
And they're not immediately in bread like brother and sister, but they marry first cousins and second cousins.
Yeah.
And they have a blue tent to them.
Yeah, and they sit up in the tree and play the banjo a lot. That's exactly right.
And secondly, you're right about the electoral college. They can absolutely go completely opposite of the popular vote.
Sure.
There's absolutely nothing that by law that makes them vote the way the popular vote does.
Well, no, no, you're missing the point. It's not a question of which way the electors are going to vote.
It's a question of the popular vote isn't necessarily going to reflect the electoral college based on the states. That's what the point is.
Exactly. No, I agree with you 100% and people who don't know that need to wake up. Yeah, because it can absolutely happen.
I can smell the ghost of Ruffler Rehears just going to hallway. Have a great day.
Okay.
See the Ruffler Rehearser Josh Freeman. If you smell it through the door, must be Josh.
So they've discussed that problem with him and it hasn't done anything good. Is that what you're saying to me?
To go out.
They told him to clean up the Nile.
No, he doesn't.
He doesn't think that and we don't have to tell those chairs out and Joe Castillo didn't really puke.
Correct.
Now, that would be a good question for Joe Castillo.
Which makes him puke faster having Josh Freeman in the room or seeing Carlos.
Here's Miami. Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
I know. Yeah. I just want to ask you, did you think all the Jones left, Mike?
I saw the team here.
