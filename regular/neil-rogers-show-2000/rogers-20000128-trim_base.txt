QAM.
Sports Radio 560.
WQAM Miami-Fort Lauderdale presents the Neil Rodgers Show.
To talk to Neil called 560560,
toll-create credit for code 560 on yourself.
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers or anyone else on the show tonight.
That's the reason for those of WQAM easily read acquisitions or the easily broadcasts.
And now, Neil Rodgers on Sports Radio 560 QAM.
It's Friday, you're fast here.
Mr. Speaker, this is Vice President.
Members of the 105th Congress, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans.
I have a incomprehensibly large tool.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
All right.
People's hidden ground.
Cities on the town.
And on the highway is low range.
Can you know what I'm talking about, everyone you know?
Flip the bird's back so that anger,
the birds, the horses, the ants, the brave,
the kind of freaking morons behind the wings.
And all that's said.
Now wait a second.
Who's that Jack?
Asked me, how am I trying to pass?
He goes, ha, ha, ha, ha.
The truck's cut in line.
But no one's signal's gonna tie.
When you're in traffic,
now you try to squeeze yourself in.
When they're wanted with lines,
when they want to pick a fight.
That's no great you just cannot believe.
But they go, ha, ha, ha.
Everybody be tough.
Okay, it's time to go to the 560WQM, Happy Friday, to you.
So we're sitting here about a few minutes ago,
like 10 to 10, and the phone rings and they're in Georgia,
picks it up, and it's Fox News.
Oh, we'd like to talk to Neil about,
and I said, the answer is no.
In fact, I got news for the whole audience today.
We're here just like Monday.
Only I'm going even farther than Monday.
Today we're not saying the,
word, not once.
What do you say about that?
Oh, right.
Yeah, that's what I say about it.
I mean, that hearing with the judges on March 6th,
and I'm going to be here today.
So if you mention that name, will it get on here?
No, no, it'll get dumped immediately.
Let's hear it.
That's it.
We'll make it all request Friday.
We got the, yeah, not too much going on.
But I'll, you know, hasten the important stuff.
Georgia's going home, by the way,
pretty soon Joe Castell was coming in,
because Georgia is sick,
and his wife is sick,
and everybody is sick.
They're all like, you can hear guts out and sick.
Now that I'm getting healthy and feeling great,
everybody else is getting sick.
So too bad.
Ha, ha, ha.
Now that I want to sound unsyphithetic,
but I was sick as a dog for five weeks,
and out to your turn, everybody else.
That's what goes around comes around.
Don't forget, no,
today, don't even think about saying it.
Maxine Elliott Hicks, 95 actress in 200 silent films,
died.
She's dead.
Do I have any idea who that is?
No, but I figured we'll kill like about 30 seconds,
mentioning that.
Always good to look in the obituaries.
Maybe somebody famous croaked.
Somebody famous and really old.
She appeared in TV's Frazier movie, Beethoven.
Do you know Maxine Elliott Hicks, who more recently
built herself as Maxine Elliott, never heard of her.
Hope she's dead.
95.
Wow, that's old enough.
Name the road after.
95.
Yeah.
The then-pronitive began appearing in place in New York
when she was five.
She played the daughter of Ethel Baramore,
the eternal mother, and the bratty Susie Mae squags.
Nemesis of America, sweetheart Mary Pickford and poor little risk girl.
I have settlement so on.
So, uh, Marit Maxine Elliott Hicks, 8K,
uh, Maxine Elliott, is dead at 95.
Nobody knows who that is.
Nobody cares.
I haven't got any idea.
But they're killed like a whole minute with that.
Nice going, Neil.
See you got a parcel of this out.
And notice now the phone is out.
I love it.
Dead.
It's all request Friday.
Come on.
It's up to you guys.
And the kids are out of school today.
It ought to be great.
This is the best thing.
I'm going to play the rack because I'm not going to discuss.
Not today.
No way.
I'm doing a public service here today between 10 and two.
Today is only the 28th of January that hearing is set for the sixth of March.
The hearing about with judge.
What's his next.
Yeah.
So I'm not going to talk about it.
Unlike of course, 4 6 7 and 10, which all are riding in hell again today.
Together again.
We're not going to play that game.
We're not going to continue pounding away in the same ponderous crap that most of us with a brain
don't give a flying crap about.
Here's a great story by Dave Hyde in the Sunsend of the day.
Faith under fire.
This is not just a great story, but very aggravating too.
Well, what are these people doing now?
They're not saying the word.
Are they?
No.
Oh.
What are they doing?
Let's stay to worth, Hunter.
Staying worth, Himer.
I thought I smelled something like Toe Jan.
You think he ever took a bath?
In fact, that's our poll question that I who took a bath last Josh Friedman or Stan Worthhimer.
That's a toss up.
That's tough.
Or maybe he took one like a dance mills better.
Stan smells better than Josh Friedman.
Now, let's hear it for Stan.
Faith under fire.
This is about the Isaac Bruce.
Never trust a guy with two first names.
It's like Gary Bruce.
Like our buddy on CNBC.
There.
What's his name with the two names?
Ted David.
I'm just checking to see if you're alert.
I know you're sick, but just checking.
Since his four-lettered-ale childhood, Isaac Bruce is found covered in his Christian beliefs,
but Super Bowl week puts everything under a microscope.
If you're up, they don't catch him with a hooker just before the Super Bowl.
You know what?
That would be bad.
Just like Eugene Robinson.
This is the great column I'm going to read it by Dave Hyde.
Sensational about all these good self-professed Christians who are a holy of the mound better than everybody else.
And Isaac Bruce is running around saying that the reason he didn't kill when he got in his car crashes
because he said the word Jesus.
Sister Mary Catherine Jesus.
Just in the nicotine just before he was going to meet his Marvin Maker.
That's right.
Just before he was going to croak.
And as long as you say the word Jesus, nothing's going to happen to him.
And about a guy named Rick Riley.
How do you like that?
A guy named Rick Riley from Sports Illustrated who was doing interview.
He got very pissed off and told me get the mouth about the arrogance of this dickhead.
Pulled out my floppy last night.
Right.
Just covered.
Just covered.
What's that?
Right.
So we'll talk a little bit about that.
But we're not going to talk about today.
So if you're looking for that.
If the Fox people are looking for information about that, you'll have to look elsewhere.
Because we need a relief.
We need a break today.
And I'm not going to McDonald's because I'm on my lower fat diet.
I should have to buy that book to my mother.
I'll have to get another copy of that book.
Remember I was reading you the other day.
The fact grams.
The worst of all is Burger King.
By the way, you take Wendy's because Wendy's is like heavy fat and greasy and very good.
The delicious.
That's what makes it good is the fat.
But Burger King's got to beat which I don't understand that.
Because Burger King burgers are as dry as rubber.
I always say it's like a division of the good year of a tire and rubber company.
Burger King be real dry.
And you want to.
And that's because they boil them in those things.
You know, those things like they put the pizzas through a pizza hot.
They put them in those automatic broilers.
Now keep putting that through there and just dry it out like shoelutters.
But don't be disappointed.
All you fat add it's out there because Burger King's got them all beat.
Double hopper with cheese.
Man, it's got about five million grams of fat in it.
That'll put you in the ground with a big smile on your face at no time at all.
So I've already turned down the Dunkin' Donut people this morning with our usual Friday morning patty with sausage and bacon and cheese.
I said, no.
Oh, thank you.
And then Tony, you came up from downstairs on the second floor.
It was a good guy.
We used to work with a WI.
Everybody likes Tony.
He's a great guy.
And he offered us a said pizza's coming in today and we said, no.
No.
How do you like that?
And I feel great.
Low fat high fiber.
And that console that will really keep you regular.
Just shove everything right.
I'm telling you, right through you like a freight train.
Like a freight train.
I mean.
Wow.
Look out for that caboose.
Woo!
I think it just came out.
I don't want to get too loose rhymes with caboose, but too loose like tracks, like wrecked.
But at any rate, I don't know.
I'm a little punchy.
They because I'm all excited over the fact that I'm not going to talk about.
And I'll just play the wreck because it's obvious we're not going to get a big response there.
You should have seen yesterday.
You should have seen yesterday.
Almost never had to give the number out.
And then even after the phone system cracked out, what's your will today eventually?
They came all right back pretty quick.
But we don't care.
I sure don't care today.
I will not listen to the e-word.
The e-word is banned on this show today.
In fact, we may have to ban the e-word till the 6th of March, you know.
Unless something dramatic happens again.
Unless somebody goes...
I'm a little bit too loudly.
No portion of this broad guess may be reproduced at the express written permission of WQAM,
deeply-reheated acquisition court.
What's my pants?
Oh, all right.
I want to scholarship the other day.
The fewer than said we need you to play.
They made an offer that I thought was cool.
Just when it's with Paul, it's so bad about school.
We had food.
Oh!
We had food.
Oh!
We had food.
Yeah.
We had food.
That said, we got something to say to you.
Just when the game is all that you got to do.
You have all the drugs and women you've ever seen.
The party down the street in a little d.
He had food.
Yes.
He had food.
He had food.
He had food.
The NCAA they show got pissed.
They gave the school a little tap on the rim.
But that would say it's just another day.
He's gonna keep on doing what we do anyway.
We had food.
Oh, great.
We had food.
He had food.
He had food.
He had food.
We had food.
We had food.
We had food.
We had food.
We had food.
In 15 and 5, 60, WQM is a Friday.
It's a wonderful Friday.
Got to be excited about it being Friday.
Man, I don't go for that cornball crap.
Oh, thank God.
It's Friday.
All those cliches.
But today I'm excited.
It's Friday because we got the Super Bowl coming up.
I'm excited about that.
No.
No.
But it assures one thing on some of that doesn't really ensure it.
But it's a pretty good chance at least locally here.
And of course you don't have to watch the local.
If you got 15 satellite, this is like I do.
I was gonna say at least Sunday we can be fairly certain for about 500 hours.
We won't be hearing the f*** on television here locally.
But I have a feeling that there might be a few cuttings if you catch my drift.
Let's see how long we can go before somebody on this show today tries to say the f*** the e-word.
Well, get on the ear.
You can take that to the bank.
That's my final answer.
56670560.560 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Is that your final answer?
That's my final answer, sir.
What's up, local?
I'm happy Friday.
I'm back to you.
All right, man.
A couple of things.
First of all, uh, any team dirtier than NHL in the flyers?
No.
Think of the black hawks.
Okay.
I'd like to take black and impeter.
I don't.
I didn't like him.
He's pointless.
And let me ask you, did they win the game?
Neil.
So what difference does it make?
Exactly.
I mean, if they want to go out and put on a wrestling show, I guess he's okay, but they didn't win the game.
I mean, he's pointless.
That's right.
Are you great?
I'm not going to say that word.
Good.
And by the way, you notice, Spayla.
Nobody's talking about it.
But again, all they talk about is the nice pass you made to berate the spring on a breakaway for the first goal.
But nobody's talking about the fact that he resolved it again and losing the game because they filled off the third goal by wrecking on a power play.
Spayla stood right in front of Vernon and screamed him.
You never had a chance.
Burn played great.
But there's again, Spayla once again, giving up the winning goal in a game.
And nobody even noticed that.
Precisely.
Prevented him from seeing the puck in which he would have stopped.
But Spayla screams him and went and doubts.
Spayla thinks the join out.
Precisely.
So we got Burian Whitney and Whitney and Buri.
Two breakaways, one early one late.
And that's basically it.
Vernon, Burian, Whitney and Whitney and Burian.
Have a great day.
Neil, I'm partners.
Yes, including.
Please, can you please repeat the name of that herb that you said was great for hypotrish.
Oh, Jesus.
Please, polkaeus, lady.
Yes, I don't know.
I wrote it down, but I don't think I got it.
You don't remember?
No.
Somebody will call.
Okay, Neil, I had some E.D.'s ice cream.
Yeah.
Man.
Went right through me.
Okay.
Five.
Two.
So E.D.'s giving the schmitzes what he said.
Yeah, it's not maybe I had the thing written down.
Do I have it written down here?
No.
No, it's at home.
Did I go on by it?
No.
No, because I'm doing great.
My pressure is fine.
I'm doing sensational right now.
Maybe this is it.
No, this is a piece of a check.
I tore up.
Five, six, seven, oh, five.
What do you laugh about?
It's a piece of a check.
I tore up because they gave me the wrong amount.
It's at the end.
Crossbrings Medical Center.
They're the hospital.
And they, oh, yeah, we forgot.
It's also this.
And it's also that's a right to bigger one for us.
Okay.
Five, six, seven, oh, five, six, ten.
No, seriously, when they see you got the money,
and you're going to write out a check,
they come up with all kinds of other stuff.
Oh, yeah, that isn't enough.
Write one for another thousand, please.
Maybe that'll cover it.
It's a E.D. free Friday here at Q.A.M.
Oh!
I sure hope that, because I know that the rest of the sport
there chose because Hank's still in Atlanta,
he'll be doing the Super Bowl stuff again,
maybe for Rell on the radio,
he'll come back again and let Hank look his rectum
one more time before it dries off.
But I don't think anybody on this station today
is going to mention that un-mentionable.
We're not going to do it.
We're going to give you an opportunity to get away
from that crap.
That's swill.
Four, six, seven, and ten.
Rotten Hell.
I'll say it again.
We ought to be out there chanting in the streets.
Yeah, when are we going to have a local media here
that gives news for people who speak English?
That's what I'd like to know.
Wouldn't that be refreshing?
Here's plantation.
Hello?
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
Great.
I hope you feel well.
Feel great.
I would remark about somehow, well,
I mean, how well you feel about the,
what's going on around here?
Isn't it great that you don't have to?
Yeah, I thought he said Schmidt.
So we only had like two colors,
and already the second color said Schmidt.
How do you like that?
He didn't have any material anyway.
But I see this is the test, and the Knessa audience
might match up to us.
No.
Absolutely not.
I mean, you've been belly-ick at about the fact
that you don't want to hear this stuff anymore.
And I'm waiting for some new fresh alternative material here.
Am I going to get it?
No.
No.
What's Robert doing there?
You're leaving now.
Robert's taking over till Joe gets here.
Or Robert's going to do the whole show.
Yeah, Robert can add, look,
because we're just going to play a lot of bits today anyway,
and then he can pretend he's that they're funny.
56670560,
pound 560.
There goes George, he's got his shades on,
and those look like the shades he stole from
what's his name, that little kid?
Yeah, you're not fooling me.
Oh, that's where he's going.
He's not going home.
Sick, he's going over to
how?
See what's a little bit of attention.
And by the way, if the Fox people call Robert,
just tell him, no, get out of here.
Come and get lost.
We're not saying the f***er today on the show.
Ponderous, disgusting, grotesque,
beatness over the head, like we can't have a life.
Let us have our lives.
That's what we say.
At least I'll be on ears saying that,
speaking out for all the rest of the masses out here
or sick and tired of being drowned in a sea of f***ing crap.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Neil?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
If you want to eat, go watch the E Network.
Go watch the whole network.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I watched the news last night to see when this was going to end.
Yes.
And God, March 6th.
No, that isn't going to be the end.
That's just the hearing.
That's only the hearing.
Oh, God.
Little end already.
Little end.
Remember this is blended bead by the Beatles.
Let it end.
That's by the South Border Residence with the IQ larger than their thumbnail.
Yes.
Thank you.
Would you play that lotion in the back?
I'll do it.
Thank you.
God bless us, sir.
All right.
Like Tynie Kim said, one and all five five six seven oh five sixty.
I can't wait to read this article about Isaac Bruce.
Isaac Bruce is on the loose from Fort Lauderdale and his mother,
whose name is Kerry the theatic the theaticus Bruce.
With their fifteen kids, one of which is him, which plays for St. Louis.
And he's more religious and better than all your other good Christians out there because if he says, Jesus, then nothing going to happen to him.
What a what an arrogant disgusting obnoxious.
Sister Mary Catherine.
Jesus.
Attitude.
By the way, Bumble was great last night.
I was sitting there watching the whole damn thing.
I had my tape school in the least game.
How about those maple A's beating the Rangers first time at 10 years at MSG.
Go on air Stevie Thomas.
It's better Glenn Healey.
And I'm watching the Panther game.
I got two tapes going plus I'm watching Bubba live.
Well, I'll tell you and you know something.
I hear the word one time during that whole deal.
Maybe that's why Bubba deserves extra accommodation for that state of the onion address last night.
He didn't mention that.
The word wants to in that thing.
Nice going, Bubba.
Well, we're going to miss him.
I don't care how many blow jobs he got and how many lies he told about it.
We're going to miss his ass.
I'll send that right now in the rest of my so bad either.
Pretty good guy.
Did a pretty damn good job.
Everybody's happy things are looking up fewer people blowing each other's brains out.
Everybody's got a couple of bucks, a couple of nickels to rub together pretty much.
So now let's turn the clock back and bring our you know, back into that bush again.
Huh?
What do you say?
No.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Good morning.
Good morning, Tusser.
Hey, love the show.
First time long time.
Great.
I want to just divert to something else more important.
I'm the FBI agent that got licked up and killed us two young men.
Yes.
I'm actually resident of Kenberpine.
And I actually was less sorry.
They got a haircut.
I killed my car worked on.
And we were reading the scum's sentinel.
Yeah.
It's something interesting quotes in there about how if you flash your badge or put out call level
mysteriously goes to zero or people get memory loss.
It doesn't people I talk to somewhere as residents for about six months.
Some as many as 40 years and they all had all sorts of horror stories about the same sort of thing.
You know, where to, you know, sometimes flash the badge, memory stayed and blood out of the levels.
Always a good idea to get you a 40 FBI ID would be good.
That would work.
Just like in the Dallas that they went Kennedy gun assassinated.
You know, a lot of people run around have Tony FBI and Secret Service credentials.
That's always a good idea to have money.
Yeah.
But the Monday I can handle the corrupt cops making these counties their personal ATMs.
Like the 12 people I talked to which is writer slippers, you know, sample the Broward County jury pool that, you know, eventually I'm, they have to sit on a jury.
You know, they talk like the one, listen like one of Ken Jenny's deputies.
If he's not busy unloading drugs at a MIA, we got to take his word.
I don't think so.
No.
They love the material.
Have a great weekend.
Okay.
I'm going to show you a show.
Did you see the story about this?
She went to watch a show.
You know, one of the nice shows they have there in Vegas at the desert.
And she comes out of the show and she walks by and she sees the mega bucks jackpot.
There is like almost $35 million.
So she said, oh, well, I'll give it a shot.
She played $27 that nine pulls.
Nine pulls and she hits $35 million.
This wrinkled up old bag.
Oh, I feel like that.
And the rest of us we sit there were yankin it were twisted it were pulling it in the machine too.
And we went to God damn thing.
Oh, the mega bucks sucks.
Mega bucks sucks.
Let's hear it.
Let's all give it a chance.
Mega bucks sucks.
Mega bucks sucks.
Old wrinkled up bitch.
God, I hate that.
35.
I didn't even share it.
I didn't give him a robber to a couple of bucks.
A f***ing bit.
Yeah, she goes and wins a 35 minute.
Of course, I wouldn't want to because I didn't go to the desert.
And I'm curious about that.
See.
The people I told you this before.
The people who manufacture the slot machines.
They're the ones who program them.
The casinos have no idea where it's going to be won or when they're going to.
Yeah, it's all programmed by the manufacturers.
So I'm curious.
I'm assuming that all of the machines in that mega bucks are programmed to give it out like once every million polls or whatever the number is.
It's just a question of which one happens to be coming up on it at which casino and which old bitch is going to well pull the, yeah, it's going to yank it at the right time.
35 million bucks.
I bet you she don't make it till the end of this year.
So like I said, I like her a lot.
Yeah, she's my best new friend now.
And everybody wins something like that.
They get a lot of new friends right away.
Lots everybody loves them.
That's the use sweetheart.
God, you're beautiful.
Even your wrinkles are lovely.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Did you catch that game last night?
Which game was that?
Yeah, I've had the game.
Yes.
I'm dirty.
This guy, he gets back after four days out with his concussion.
And besides at the end of the game, he just kind of sticks somebody in the back.
Lundras.
And it didn't his brother out of hockey.
Yes, so there was a concussion and he always had three.
I think four would kind of do it for him.
What?
One is kind of, I mean, he's going to get chief shot of one day.
You know, it might just kill him.
That's one way guy like that.
That's his nature.
He's a dirty player.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I think that you know, one day one, they won a game.
Oh, see?
I'm saying that.
You know, what else?
What?
They put those two guys together.
You know, they're much better than the Panthers.
Panthers down.
You primo in Lundras?
Yeah.
I don't know that they're much better.
They've been crappy defense.
Right.
Crapied defense.
Plus they don't want to shoot the puck.
I mean, here's the geezer.
It was like a walking civet together and they don't want to shoot it.
Yeah.
Never up, never in.
That's my philosophy.
The fence when they came up, stood right up to Lundras.
The system is, uh, because I'm not really up on the Panthers.
That was big.
I never seen that from a Panther ever.
He, he, and their gasses, uh, four head wide open.
I've gone there Todd.
Oh, I take it easy.
I rate that.
Well, that's my close personal friend Todd Simpson by way,
the from the Panthers.
And they say, oh, yeah, he don't know who that you are.
The hell he doesn't.
Hi, this is Todd Simpson.
And nobody hits harder than Neil Rogers.
How do you like that?
Even Eric Lindross don't hit him as hard as I do.
And Todd knows it.
Nice going, Todd.
They still lost the game though.
Damn it.
Those sticking rotten flyers.
But Roberts, for you, little, I don't want to talk about it.
Okay, Burry and Whitney and Whitney and Burry and Mike Burry.
Nice going there.
Mikey for two guys playing great.
See, this team is defense things and people say, well,
how can I have such a great defensive record?
That's close Trevor.
Kid and played great.
Mike Burry and playing great, great goal tending.
But the defense, it's like, uh, they're in La La Land.
Sissy Space Act last night.
She was terrible and Spayla like, uh, oh, just awful.
Yeah, getting further in and screen them out again there.
Robert, you jackass.
Not you, Robert, the other Roberts, Fala.
Hey, screen them out on the go.
I'm not going ahead no chance because Robert Spayla.
Hello.
27 after 10 at 5.
60 WQM.
It's Friday, you were still right.
This is Debbie.
Hi, Debbie.
I'm in the student games operations done.
Okay.
And some body contouring and some liposuction.
Uh-huh.
And I was wondering if it's some tummy tuck and lip augmentation
doesn't let it compress.
Silly space.
All of these things.
Uh-huh.
And I was wondering.
Boy, you like steroids.
Well, I like steroids.
I need to get everything done.
Probably the first thing I'd like to have removed is my thing.
Okay, we don't do that.
No. Could you do breast implants though?
Uh, I can't be done.
I don't know what they would do right away.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Uh-huh.
How much?
Uh, 5,000.
Excellent.
I'd like to have my skin resurfaced too.
Uh-huh.
Laser surgery.

Thank you, do you think?
Don't hurt mommy's little baby.

I'd like to get the liposuction that I saw on TV.
Okay.
Can you make me look more like a woman?
Well, we'll have to see you first.
And then if I'm looking at you, we can tell you that when we see you.
Should I wear my skin suit made of body parts, mommy?
Uh, if you'd like to.

was arrested on a charge of indecency exposure while attending last week's.
World Series a fantasy baseball camp, according to a lead county sheriff's office report.
Why do you think they call them Dick?
William Seventy, who lives in Henderson, Nevada, is accused of walking naked outside the
his room at the rightest in the hotel on Cleveland Avenue at 910 p.m. January 17th.
And masturbating the report said.
A female female employee at Walgreens, which is located next to the hotel.
Well, the report of the incident to a sheriff's office.
She told the deputy Williams returned to his room when he saw her.
I thought maybe that's when he came out.
When deputy's knocked at his hotel room door, Williams answered the door and pajamas the report said.
When Williams was being booked in the lead county jail, one of the items,
inventory was in 1953 World Series ringing received while playing for the Brooklyn Dodgers.
During his court appearance January 18th, the county judge who starens released
Williams on time served the coin to jail record.

Here's Halendale. Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Did you read the local page, you know, the front sentinel local at the bottom of the page.
I think you'll get something.
Two graphs for Channel 7.
Two graphics for Channel 7.
It's about the seminal tribes.
They wouldn't take the ad.
They wouldn't take an ad.
I did read that.
That was in the post-Jewish language.
Did you read down at the bottom it says tonight, touch the stations,
you educated high quality worlds while this police video.
Right.
Okay, Neil, take it easy.
Thanks for the good news.
Yeah, Channel 7 turned out an ad from the Seminal Indians because they said it was
to a grotesque or crappy or whatever.
And all the other channels took it.
There's nothing to grotesque to be on Channel 7.
I needed a big pile of elephant.
Dung would be okay on Channel 7.
Be it a big improvement over Rick Sanchez.
I'll tell you that.
If we took a poll right now, guarantee you 95% would rather watch a pile of elephant
Dung at the news anchor desk than see Rick Sanchez as post ever again.
Watch that hyperventilating jackhead.
Oh, man, I feel better already.
Not just because of my health is so much better, but because 35 minutes without the
E word today.
Oh, God, do I feel better?
See, I could cop out here.
I could do the easy way up and have every line lit up on the board and rehash
the same old tired crept.
But I'm not going to do that.
I'm going to be the one lone as usual voice in the world of this.
Give me an alternative.
Give me an escape.
And the good news is another reason I feel so much better.
Guiding light was on yesterday.
All right.
In its entirety.
We want our soap operas nurse, right?
That's somebody else's goddamn soap opera.
We don't give a flying crap about that one.
We're tired of it.
And how about that flying none?
How about you?
She and Janet Reno probably have a little rift over that little difference of opinion.
A little split.
Here's Miami.
Hello?
Well, yes, senior Roger.
See.
How you doing?
Great.
I'm sure to call him to say I wish more people had the Iran has the oranges like you
when there were a lot more people at that on the radio and on TV.
Right.
And maybe we should recommend Mr. John Rocker for the city of Miami mayor.
How would his people have here like that?
Well, I got a great article about you on Rocker.
I'm glad you mentioned that.
I got a fantastic article from those weeks.
I'm telling you, they wanted me that many people left here.
Neil Washington, let's request for you.
Yes, sir.
Anything you want to talk about?
Panth, dickies.
What is it?
Dickies.
You know, what's the biggest dickies you've seen?
I knew I have a nice, great day, then, but I'll mention the email word.
Okay.
Thank you.
Is it all you had, dickies?
Hello.
You have reached Dickies' Workers Choice Catalog and Information One.
Do you speak with a representative or if you have a rotary phone, please stay on the line.
Thank you.

This is Luanne.
How may I help you?
Yeah, I'm Luanne.
Hi.
Hi.
You like dickies?
Sure.
I guess a lot of women do, huh?
Mm-hmm.
I believe so.
My woman said she loves to get dickies.
I see.
She likes a lot of them.
Yeah.
And I understand some gay guys like dickies.
Well, I really don't know.
I've never really thought about that.
What's the biggest dickies you've seen?
Well, sir, we go to a 72 waist.
Oh my God.
You like little dickies, too?
Sir, I think my girl basically likes big dickies.
Well, is there a point to this conversation, sir?
Yeah, just a bag.
I get to say dickie a lot on the phone.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, were you willing to place an order, sir?
For what?
For clothing?
But I want to talk about dickies.
Well, sir, that's what we carry is clothing.
Huh?
And Mickey dickie.
Mm-hmm, yeah.
Sir, if there's no other reason that you're calling this...
My mind like dickies and a lot of women like dickies.
Uh, sir, I'm going to disconnect.
No way.
You're talking about dickies.
22 before 11 at 5.60.
It's an E-free Friday.
That's right.
Here on 5.60 WQM.
They're only placing this, uh, God for a second town.
You get away from the f***ing E word.
Got him, I'm proud of that.
Uh, so Anna Quiddlin, whatever her name is, in the Newsweeks,
got a great column, which I'll get to a little later on.
As soon as we run out of calls in about five minutes,
ignore them off the field.
They can pitch past punch, but athletes are no more less
than ordinary human beings.
And basically, you know, she says John Rocker.
He's an asshole.
Why should anybody care what he says?
And then she also goes on to talk about these as scumbags.
In fact, there's a whole bunch of people in the Super Bowl this weekend
who are like criminals.
We're going to have a Kathy O'Brien.
Katherine.
Facts as me this.
There's a website, www.apbnews.com.
It's featuring Super Bowl rap sheets.
Highlighting criminals will be playing Sunday in Atlanta
and what they've done.
All right.
There you go.
You want to find all the scumbags that they're going to be playing this Sunday?

Rap rhymes with, you got it.
It's 21 before 11 at 5.60 WDQM.
Facts as Fukardic.
I find up a lady from Jennifer Smith,
who's seen the world's biggest corner.
Noah, dip all around.
Her response is,
Warhead.
Yeah, yeah.
Ha, ha, ha.
What the two of us get up to?
What else, please?
A man and a human push bump won't get right at me.
Then look like you're the headlight.
I thought like a deer.
I close my eyes,
but she's made like a wish she can't even name.
The big and thin my fingers, I've been gone too long.
The one is that from Wander's,
the main film is gone.
He's armed.
This is...
He's armed.
This is...
I'm just gonna help think and think,
and then you'll feel some of this kid.
He's armed.
He's armed.
This is...
When I had a bunch of dollars when I went to the space,
I could swear there was a smile.
I know I'm George Fates.
That was making my curse,
and candy can't elope,
so there was hiding food,
or just a sub like a boat.
It's made out of baby,
and fed it from their breasts.
They better buy that kid a really good life,
that's enormous.
That's the...
The dream of an armist.
I'm just gonna help think and think,
and then you'll feel some of this kid.
He's armed.
He's armed.
I know what you're pushing for, Mariah Carey.
He's just got one big one in the middle of her chest.
It's a 17-4-11-5-60 W to Q-A-M.
E-Free Friday, baby.
Vatis to seek out Mormons as witnesses.
Two Southern Vatis congregations are preparing a crusade
to teach the members how to convert cult members,
including Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses.
Cult members.
The cult of Earnest Impact Crusade is scheduled
for February 60th of Calvary Vatis Church
and Oklahoma Vatis Church.
Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses are not Christians,
since the Reverend Mark Quartz Calvary Senior Pastor
and the Reverend Philip Henry,
Assistant Pastor for Evangelism and New Member Simulation.
How do you like that?
So they went after the Jews.
They went after another going after their other goyem.
And they just won't stop.
The God damn Vatis just will never stop.
Will they stop?
No.
Lunatics.
Here's a mobile in top of no.
Hello?
Hey, Uncle Neil, how are you?
Great.
I have a vote also instead of not just banning the e-word.
Have a banning baby Jesus as well.
Okay.
Can you imagine if we didn't have the satellite dish?
You'd be stuck watching this all day long?
No, I'm not.
But I'm not.
Do you know, by the way, on the satellite,
when we stopped getting the free previews of the locals?
January 9th, 19 days ago, but don't tell anybody.
Really?
Yeah.
I thought it was supposed to be the beginning of February.
Well, they first said January 9th, and I already got mine,
and I'm paying for it, of course, like a good legal boy,
so I have no idea.
Of course.
Don't say too loud.
Certainly.
I have to tell you, Neil, I'm out on the road all day long.
You're the sole voice of reason in this town.
My whole family listens to you.
We all love you.
Yes, I am.
Thank you, sir.
I just want to make it a big surprise.
What's the best thing you like?
How about the guy trying to buy the...
Is inquiring about the Chinese restaurant?
No, have a great day.
No.
Like I said, almost anything you like.
No, not things that have been...
You know, I can't do that.
No, like no jack into box, no Chinese restaurant sale,
no way, young, Neil, no.
No.
The answer is...
No.
But have a great weekend, anyway.
56670560, 0560.
See, the object of these shows is to be entertaining.
I know that comes as a shock to some of the sports
that are done at station.
The object is to be entertaining.
Not just to get sucked in with the same repetitive boring
droning crap by people in the audience,
even though this was a good guy, but nevertheless,
he just didn't get it.
Jimmy and Danny and Danny, you know what I'm talking about?
Things like that.
Yeah.
Very ponderous and very, very terminally boring.
Even a moron couldn't listen to.
Over and over.
And that's going to be our poll question, by the way.
What you would do right here?
Jimmy and Danny or the f***ing e-word.
Not that you'll hear either one here, but that's tough.
That's a tough one.
It's nip and tuck.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Miami.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, what do you think about the game last night?
Which game was that?
The Panther game?
Yeah.
They are, they lost.
I know.
Yeah.
But why does it take two Panthers to jump out of the glenjos?
But, let me ask you this.
What differences make they lost?
The fights are when wins are loses the game.
They lost.
They lost cause of shotty defense in the first period.
This is true.
Uh-huh.
And you enjoyed that fight between War El and the...
No, I did not.
I'm not interested in fights unless there's, you know,
there has something to do with the game.
Peter Wrell is just a side show, a circus, a freak show.
He had nothing with the game.
I needed a Sandy McCarthy, either one of them.
Neither one of them should be in the league.
And have a great day.
You enjoyed that fight?
Hey, did you do anything?
No, they lost the game.
See, I don't enjoy it when you lose the game.
Now, you're one of those people.
Hey, come on, War El.
Hit somebody, War El.
Like those red necks that sit up there around me.
Yeah, come on, War El.
Occasionally, they sit up there more.
You know, if we have all the rest of the seats filled with their usual people,
there are no red necks up there.
Thank God.
There's that guy with the old tower.
Look on his face that if it's behind me,
they're in the first row, but he ain't going to change.
You're going to change now?
No.
I think he's stuffed.
Here's Miami.
Hello?
Okay, Carlos is aware of the missing information.
And he's going to be calling him shortly about that.
Then you call him in the selfie.
Okay?
Okay.
Neil.
Yes.
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
That was pretty interesting.
I thought that we were going to get in the middle of some kind of a good drug deal or something there.
No, buddy.
I'm sorry about that.
That's okay.
No, I just have two questions on.
Are you Carlos?
Is that like your boyfriend?
I'm Louis Kens.
Okay.
How do I get a copy of a, you know, a little bit of the post lotion on the basket?
Yeah.
How do I get, do you have a CD for anything like that?
Yeah, that's on the best of Neil.
That's on call center one.
Five, six, three, thirty, six hundred in Howard.
Okay.
And they got it.
Or you can just go to, if you got a computer, I would think so.
Some big shot like you.
I do.
I am a big shot.
There you go.
NeilWargeers.com.
That's our website.
NeilWargeers.com.
You can order it right off of there if you like.
Okay.
My other question, Neil.
Is Peter Warl guy?
It works for lotion in the basket.
No.
I think that guy named Peter, right?
Well, let me ask you this.
If the panthers can get a fudge like that, is this like a, you think this is going to be like a trend that's going to be happening in any cell?
No.
You're just going to get black guys and just, you know, palm line everybody else.
No, because the other black guys like Donald Brashear, for example,
are placed around Cuba, at least he's a player.
In other words, he has other skills.
He can, you know, once they're in law scores a goal and he can really skate and do more than just go out there and get stupid penalties and get into dumb fights.
So no, I don't think so.
Okay.
All right.
That's it, Neil.
Have a great life, pal.
Say how to Carlos for me.
Okay.
Thank you for us.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, what was he saying to Carlos when we came out of the conversation?
I want to give you a kiss.
Yeah, something like that.
I thought five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60.
God, I feel better already.
Just almost an hour of e3 radio.
I mean, what is there left to say?
Every guy named Story, look over here to file.

He said for 50 bucks, he couldn't mind him.
He looked at his wife, and if he had a child,
it would leave a clone, too.
I wasn't circumcised.
He knelt down the throat around and gave me away.
He said, I'm gonna go down right here in the plain.
I felt the sudden tugging, then I started to scream.
I cropped my drawers, I thought of Joe.
I found he's got weeks.
I couldn't see it on the left all right.
I only know my jeez for quite a time.

I'm falling back down.
Oh!

I'm falling back down.
I'm falling back down.

I'm walking like a cow, boys.
I'm just been circumcised.

Well, I mean, if you're a tire blew out, you'd probably love Jesus Christ also throwing the car out of control on the highway.
He jerked his hands from the steering wheel.
The car flipped twice every window exploded.
Bruce wasn't wearing a seatbelt and as recent accidents involving athletes have shown, the odds are a titty headline comes out of this.
In fact, these other accidents have become part of the Super Bowl story.
Bobby Phil is the pro basketball player who was racing his car and did not wear a seatbelt died in the accident three weeks ago.
The retomus the pro football player wasn't wearing a seatbelt was paralyzed in the accident this week and a riding companion was killed.
Bruce says he doesn't know their fate can't explain their actions, but what he says when asked about their fate and when he repeats when he kept being asked is this could never have been me.
Why? Because of my belief and my faith in God. He said I yelled off the name of Jesus.
There's no other name you can yell out and be saved. The name is a weapon to protect you even if you let yell out.
That won't do it. It's got to be Jesus.
A group of reporters is asking him about this. Bruce sits there with a little emotion is one of them. Rick Riley of sports illustrated you ignorant slide wonders directly about golf or pain Stewart's tragic fate.
A Christian a plane ride a death trip for everyone on board. How can explain his death Riley asks.
There are certain rights you have as a Christian just like as a driver you have certain rights. Bruce says, but you have to put into key.
You have to call out the name Jesus if he had called it out he'd be saved.
How do you like that? How come nobody told him that I hate when that happens for pain story if he just would have called out Jesus.
I just want Peter Alistan all that all of us American gov is on the right to come to we are Chinese too.
That'll teach you to make fun of the gooks there Peter. I mean the pain what are you the pain.
There is an anger growing from reporters and confusing the parent Bruce as to Riley I'm ministering I'm planning a seed in you.
Squirt Squirt is what he said. I guess his mother knows about that with 85 kids.
In Broward, a sister was at home fasting until noon each day and praying for St. Louis in his Super Bowl.
Let's pray for the Titans what he said.
Another sister was a pastor at a lottery lake church two weeks ago before a playoff game against Minnesota.
Bruce called his mother on a cell phone from the locker room after tweaking a bothersome hamstring and practice.
She was at the store. He began calling brothers and sisters finally getting older sister Juliana Joseph.
Juliana shows there maybe she's related to Curtis. Pray with me. He said they did.
He said his hamstring was healed because of it. He caught four passes for 133 yards in a touchdown that game because they prayed for him obviously.
Is that right? The Bruce's are a loving family a good family and especially close family.
The father Jesse is a retired roofer. God with 85 kids. How do he be having time to work?
Carey the carathy pathetic whatever her name is even once you kick the kids out of the house.
He said I would drive by secretly and check up on him.
Oldest Gray now the dealer that led it directly tells how many of the Bruce children played sports for the goldstein's hand where his well behavior is you'll find Isaac was a quiet child to always did his best.
Joseph Bruce the youngest child and a senior at St Thomas High tells how every couple of weeks this past season he would send video tapes of his games to Isaac.
The older brother would study them and pass along pointers now the five nine Joseph would consider football offers from Ohio State and Missouri says I wish I'd get that growth spurt like Isaac did.
Score it's court that's spurt. But few reporters come to talk family or football with Isaac this Super Bowl week. It's religion. It's Jesus.
It's why he lived when others died. There is general skepticism opened outing an understandable wondering some Super Bowl the religion story is former NFL great red G wife pumping loudly about his beliefs and those homos some Super Bowl's that Atlanta safety Eugene Robinson accepting a Christian award for his high moral character the morning before the game and being arrested for solicitation the same night.
This Super Bowl it's partially court Warner the St. Louis quarterback who openly credits his faith for allowing him to keep the faith in his talent when no one else did but more dramatically its Bruce who's worse remains calm and answers keep coming even as the questions do.
I want to continue that discussion. Marley said upon returning to Bruce after 15 minutes what about Cassie Bernal who is she Bruce answered who that be.
Riley said she's the column by high school student who had a gun put in her face while being asked do you believe in Jesus she said yes she was blown away.
Bruce he wouldn't have blown me away. I would have pleaded the blood of Jesus I say I plead the blood of Jesus and it wouldn't have gone off and the gun either.
Are you folks following this. Yeah. Riley I think it's offensive for you to say that I think it's offensive any Christian who died in the tragedy.
I think you've ticked off a lot of people today Bruce I think you've ticked off a lot of people Riley you tick me off I think it's offensive and stupid.
Bruce are you calling me stupid Riley I'm saying what you said is stupid Bruce we're done talking Riley walked away.
I do like that as he did in the perfect ending to another Super Bowl day as the epitaph to the other Super Bowl controversy and a story that began hundreds of miles away in the streets of Fort Lauderdale.
Bruce said God bless you or I think he said. I think that's what he really said well not yeah.
How do you like that another arrogant Christian with his Jesus craft see nobody going to mess with him because he's going to say Jesus just at the right time.
Let's pray for the Titans right now.
I am so sick and tired of these goody toos you like if there were such a thing as a God which we all know that there's not but if there were he's busy praying for athletes and he picks and chooses which teens he likes.
How do you like that. Yeah.
Let's do a God then exorcism right now let's cast a wicked evil spell on the St. Louis ring and make sure Tennessee kicks their big fat Mally of pseudo religious ass this Sunday.
What do you say?
5 6705 60.560 on the 18 T line. Here's a mobile and Coral Springs hello.
Hey Neil. Yes sir. How are you today great. Great. I was listening to the first team this morning when they were talking about Lindros and some guy called in and said he'd only heard two people.
They just hold career and I remember back for the year of the rat when he was playing against us. Yeah. He was cutting this up with a stick.
I haven't seen that much blood since. Okay. Right. And I couldn't believe that. He's the dirtiest player in the league or at least one of the top three or four dirtiest players.
No, he has no question about that. The guy is a butcher. Yeah. But in the meantime what they weren't talking about is the fact that they let him stand in front of the net there and keep banging away and banging away and poking it in there for that second to help you.
Did anybody mention that? No. No. Yeah. And he stuck it right in there. Right. I was the fact that Tissy Spasak was standing there watching while Simon Gagnek. It was banging away on his own rebound and putting their first goal.
Did anybody mention that? Oh, that Robert Sphala was screaming out Mike Vernon on the third and winning goal. Did anybody mention that? No. No. See that's all they can relate to is the fights and wore out to this and Lindros is dirty.
But in the meantime, at least one again. See that's bad. Very bad. Real bad.
Clintorius. Okay. Thank you sir. You got it. Have a great day. Can we say that on the year by the way? Clintorius? No. Oh, just play it.
9 minutes after 11 at 560 WQM. I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.
A Elizabeth Taylor Fabio. Share. They all have celebrity perfumes. Now from the right house comes the first perfume of the Clinton era.
Hillary. Hillary. The one that is the Torrance. Hillary. The leader. Is not. Part Hillary. Part. Notorious. The new perfume from Hillary Clinton.
Clinton. Torrance. What's that smell? That's my coin. Torrance. I love it. Nothing smells quite like it.
Smell it. I can't even find it. Is that it? No. Is that it? Nope. How about this? No. It's a little hard to find. But once you do. Holy mackerel. It's great.
Look forward at your perfume counter post office or at the Baton Tackle. Hi, all. This is Hillary Clinton and you love my Victoria.
Look for it in the little inbox. So little we're heads of the Tana Reno asked the sister Jean when she got off the plane in Washington.
What's that smell? Sister Jean said I just brought along with me a fish sandwich for the right. 14 past 11 at 560 W. A. M. Can't you see Janet trying to grab that sandwich or get a hold of that thing?
I'm sorry. That's bad. That's really. It kept flipping out of her hand and the sandwich too. 560 560. 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's a lady in dear field. Hello. Hello. Yes, ma'am.
No, I'm so glad to hear you. I've been listening to you for many years. And I wanted to let you know that yesterday and the today show.
I don't know if you've heard about it, but the Frazier's wife Kelsey grammar the actor came out of the closet.
So to speak and said that she has ideas and that she wants the public to be aware of it. And then we collect money from charity.
Collect money for what? For better diet, for better food. Well, yeah, because she's.
And then we have money. So we can all be turned on after putting up with the stress from the assholes we were poor. That sounds good to me.
Oh, the seven years she said she's been suffering with it and that she had problems getting up during the day and trying to figure out what she could do.
She could court in the middle of the day and she had to go run through the bathroom. Really?
At a moment notice and she said she couldn't live her life like that anymore. So she went to several doctors like you did and several testings and she finally saw that the doctor said that she had an IBS.
And with diet and knowing that she has stress at times. Yeah, that she was going to she'd able to control it.
It's not clear that it never goes away. But never goes away completely. It's kind of like well like being ugly. Yeah.
Yeah, no, but yeah, she can control it. She wants the public to be aware of it. She wants everyone to know that it's not a quote, quote, you know, a duty disease or anything.
A duty disease right that's a good way to put it right anyway. I don't know if you saw the Panther game last night.
Yes, Lindross who got penalized for the tripping of Whitney. Yeah. Excuse me. Well, he sat in the penalty box and Whitney was giving him some words and you didn't need a liquid to hear what the hell this man was saying.
Yeah, I mean, I couldn't believe I said this. This guy's got no class. But who Lindross? Yeah. But in the meantime, he scored a goal and then they won the game.
I mean, everybody keeps talking about what an asshole he is and about Peter did this and Eric did that. But they won the game. I know.
I'll account. We only just come back, but they won a game. I know. I know. I just hope that let me ask you. Would you take him on our team in about five seconds?
Excuse me. I didn't hear that. Would you take Eric Lindross on the Panthers? Oh, absolutely. There you go. So what best shirt? Yeah. Have a great day. So we don't take the BS out of the IBS.
Yeah. I'm the guy that took the BS out of the IBS and we took the E out of this show today.
Joe Castello's in her day. You'll be pleased to know that it's an E free Friday. We're not allowing the E word on the show today.
Got into an hour and a quarter already. Nobody's even tried to slip it in there in the word either. We're very pleased with that.
Very proud of this group so far. We're giving you a little relief, a little release, a little bit of a vacation from the incessant.
That they keep doing to us. Okay. And if we find a local channel here, which I seriously doubt, but if we run the local channel,
it's willing to provide us with entertainment for people that aren't obsessed with crap, and I'll be glad to let you know which one it is.
5 6 7 0 5 60 on an all request Friday, pound five 60 on the AT&T line, the out of town line. We're going to hello those people today.
877 785 6345. I mean, we're talking about anything and everything and absolutely not the E word. So you think, hey, there's my good friend Ken Maldon who said, oh, he said the E word.
We just said he's exasperated. Whatever that he gets desperate because they preempted his update yesterday to a clock because Hank was talking to some Bozo.
I was very upset about that when I preempted Ken molding you don't mess around with Ken Maldon on his station. Okay. You'll have to step over my dead body to mess with Ken Maldon.
He's one of the few guys we got in this building that there's an IQ larger than his thumbnail.
I like the way Ken sits in that the bullpen in there keeps watching all the old races from Biscayne on that video thing and it's great.
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello.
Bless you Father for I have said yes. Yes. The way that all these athletes talk about Jesus and God of the price that no one is trying to craft Jesus or God.
I mean, why pray to them get them on your team. How many yards did God rush for this season? Yeah.
I would think that would be a good addition to the game. Yesterday, Neil, I wouldn't have.
Hi, sure miss this game, Ken. I'll try to that. What a great place that was before this March is all over with an on sorry. What is it?
Yes. I had another anal adventure yesterday. I had the flexible sigway to scope. Yeah. It sounds like you're suffering the actor effects to be honest with you. He sounded a little bit lethargic from it. Yeah.
And it will. It was a thing of scope. Yeah, I did it. I don't know. I think he only went into one third of the call and I got to go back for the whole deal of.
Cool. Ask about you. Did they find anything? Yeah. They did. Yeah. Like what? A midnight poly. No getting. Well, that didn't they slip it out? No, this was just a.
Well, this was just a survey crew. Yes. Now they go back in and do the excavation. Okay. Well, good luck pal. Piece of cake. No problem. Call the Oscar be as much much easier than the sigmo. Ask because they give you that shot. You go like, you're like in. You don't remember anything. You don't know anything. You don't remember a real thing.
Route. As opposed to the sig board, must be where you're wide awake and they stick that thing and they keep pushing and twisting and yanking.
Okay, hang on with me. This one more second. I just want to take a look over here. They just jam that thing in there and the scope to 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line. What a difference from yesterday. I feel I feel great.
I feel so relieved. And I'll confess to you that last night I went to public. And I got myself a little pint. Just a pint of healthy choice.
Pre-lean crunch low fat ice cream. See two meals a week on this diet. You can cheat. You can have anything you want without gorging. And the whole pint only had 8 grams of fat. Did I gain any weight? No. My blood sugar this morning was 110.
Very nice to me. So this low fiber high. I mean low fat high fiber diet seems to work and tremendously agrees with me. It's not for everybody. If you're doing that, it's great. If you're doing Jenny Craig, great. And if you're doing that. I look at all.
I don't know for a picture and put my guts out that's fine to whatever works for you, but this is great for me. I feel sensational now that everybody else is getting sick. You look thinner. I look thinner. Yeah, right in the. Yeah. See that's always the first place I lose the weight. You want to know why it's going to exercise. I get as moving my gum like that. Seriously. Every time I go on a diet where I lose weight, the first place is in my cheeks.
No, not those cheeks. Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, new. Yes, sir. God bless you, man. God bless us. Hey, and Jesus, don't forget him. Don't want to get Isaac up, sir. The thing is that people, they can't admit that they're on their own. They need some leader. They need a crutch. Yeah, they need somebody to hold on to. They can't admit that they're on their own. There's nothing wrong with some of the hold on to them. I mean, sounds good to me.
They're not to me, boy. But anyways, they just they just they can't admit that they're on their own and they need them. They need somebody to hold on to and.
To all the people out there, they're like their Christians and they believe in so called God. Yeah, you're on your own, but he you're on your own piece.
Amen. Amen, brother. 5 6705 60 pound 560 on the 18 to run. It's not very good article. I said Bruce, nice going, Dave.
I'm going to hide and I just go on a Rick Riley there from a sports illustrator, whoever the hell he is. I thought there was really only one Rick Riley.
I need help, but it turns out there's one another one who was very offended and very aggrosed out as he should have been by Isaac Bruce.
And he's idiotic comments. He's the real Christian. Well, the real Christian, please stand up better than everybody else, holier than thou.
Nothing's going to get him because he's got Jesus on his side. Man.
I know what I'd like to see. Let's have Isaac Bruce after the Super Bowl winner lose. Come back to Fort Lauderdale. Time to the railroad tracks over there on Dixie Highway.
Oh, seriously. And when a train comes along, say, OK, Isaac, you yell out for Jesus and see if that train stops or what, what be having it.
I said, that would be fast. Put it live on Channel 7. Have Rick Sanchez squatting over the tracks. In fact, maybe we can tie him right next to Isaac. Sound good.
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you doing? Great. Good. I could game last night off. Yeah, the Leafs game. Leafs and Rangers.
I'm a flyer. Oh, yeah, I'm going to be honest with that. I didn't watch that much of it. I was watching Bubba. So I was taping the Leafs game and taping the Panther game.
I saw some of it. And then of course, I watched the fights and the lowlights. I saw all the goals because they were on the first period. The ones that counted.
And then I saw Rick when he's break away at the end of the empty net goal. So I didn't miss too much. Something which is stupid fights.
Yeah, well, I'm just calling to say, I heard so many listeners had trouble getting tickets to the games.
You know, through the ticket office at the arena tickets to what game to any game?
Oh, yeah, people that are having the problems right because nobody answers the phone allegedly. Right. My roommate, you know, he never watches hockey games. He's not really a hockey fan,
but I told him the last game last night. And I went to work and I came home for work. And he said, yeah, that was exciting game. He said, I want to go to a game.
I got on the phone this morning to take a message. I didn't talk to a human being and had no problem getting tickets for the out of the game coming up one off at work.
President thing. And you know, he's looking forward to it.
Well, it's just another convenient excuse. I mean, if you want the tickets, you're going to get them. You know, there's just another dumb excuse. These people, this is a ton of excuses.
Right. Did you notice the attendance left by it at the core state center? No, I did not. I was, I'm sure, standing remoling.
Okay, it holds 19,500 people in 19,750 showed up under the. And of course in Toronto, we have over 400 standing room every night every single home game.
But I don't confuse these people with the facts. Okay, that's all I got to tell you is no problem getting tickets for the game. If you really want to go.
Okay, I'll see you there, pal. Yeah, we got the big Edmonton game coming up tomorrow. And I realized they're not in our conference.
And that was the really great teams in league, but they're a young, exciting team to watch. And we should beat the snot out of my with that.
You know, they have no defense kind of like us. And it's going to be real interesting to see like Dave Joseph said yesterday, how many people show up for that game.
After watching almost 4,000 empty seats for the New Jersey devil's the other night, but you can keep talking about it and talking about it.
And you just can't force feed these people something good. They'd rather have their vanilla ice cream. They'd rather talk about Jimmy and Danny and Davey and this same old crap. They're boring, boring, boring place.
You got something exciting, something great going on. And all I start doing is rattling off the excuses. And let me tell you right now, I'm arranging with the Panther organization.
We're going to have a bunch of security guards. See, they're taking surveillance tape. They got the pictures.
This is a new technology. They've got the facial pictures of everybody who's coming all the games. You don't even need to have one of those punch cards I suggested.
And if you show up and try to buy tickets to the playoffs, they're going to like see your pussy.
And if you want to get to the regular season, they're going to say, sorry, you can't come in. How do you like that? Sorry, sorry, mister.
You can't come in. I hear you knocking, but you can't come in because you're a front running phony. We don't want none of you no more.
Front running phony, phony, baloney town. And they get the banners out like with a marlins. You know, oh, we love the Marlin. That, yeah, right.
When they were in the world serious, see, there's some places that are real sports town and there are other places that are not like Pittsburgh, for example, that's another bogus town.
Twice, they've almost lost the penguins came with an awisker. They got your armor, yaga. The second most exciting player in a guy named more nice to a beret.
And they can't fill up that place. They fill it up last night. I realized they were playing a girl's team Atlanta, but they should have been salivating at the mouth to see that to see them knocked the snot, which they did out of the trashers. Did they fill it up? No.
They usually don't fill it up. The only thing they support in Pittsburgh is the Steelers. They fill up the pirates. No, they've had, they've almost lost them a million times too. There are some towns that are real sports down like Detroit.
Detroit is one of them name the other one. That's it.
Not Boston. There's a zillion empty seats in that fleet center. Not Chicago, a billion empty seats in a new stadium they got for the black box.
Huh? For all the teams. Yeah, well, what's the real sports down? I mean, the Rangers, but of course they got 15 million people to draw from and you have to inherit those guys and tickets 18,200 for you.
I'm glad that we're 18,200 last night. And it's funny. We played Mary Healy to see Steve Thomas score pair as the least one in the last minute. Three over the Rangers. I'm glad there were 18,200 people there to see the Maple Leafs.
26 after 11 at 5. Sixty first time in 10 years. They won an as building. Let's hear it for Steve Thomas. I've gone there. Steve.
I'll do other glam. Stay Hoover. I'll see more on mine.
I've been through a bedroom with no right.
And five eight and keep doing my week.
When I did I knew who was crippled. But that ain't no good. Think you play for the fish.
I guess my girlfriend for rocket kill me.
That's another bitch with someone else as well.
And I'm sure they have a good beat in the building. And I found out who it is changed me with a knife. Why didn't that bitch kill me?
It was too dark to see.
She beat me with a revolving.
If that's the best out of me, he'll fail me now.
It's 1131. Great. From the Land Over Baptist Church.
The vought Satanist Ricky Martin orchestrates his sexually motivated invasion on American morality. This is from the Internet, of course.
One of the devil's favorite ways to corrupt this all is through music. The Bible tells us that Lucifer was an angel of life.
It was he that's at by God's side and strung the sacred guitar before legions of angels.
It was he who was in charge of organizing heaven's hymnal. But he fell from glory and since that faithful ae has been nothing but a boil on the backside of every God during American citizen in this country.
As Christians, we need to keep our eyes peeled open for the devil's next move. He's a slick one, but for the Christ-centered man, he's easy to catch.
Recently, Satan has begun to raise the stakes in the Holy Culture War in which we are currently engaged.
Ricky Martin is the devil's latest innocent appearing way to sidetrack the faithful and one that is possibly already stuck into your home undivided.
Ricky Martin's latest song, Living La Vita, Loka, Land Over Linguished Trans like this is living in for the devil in God's English.
It's causing young girls to have sex and get pregnant at the age of 10.
Oi!
This Latin heart drop recently dedicated his life to Satan. Recent reports indicate that he puts a banana in his pants when he goes on stage.
He can't think for sh**.
Young impressionable teenage girls are then intoxicated with a frightening satanic frenzy.
He has people staying up all hours of the night dancing and sleeping in until noon.
This ringleader of immorality was blessed by the Pope himself. The Pope called him an angel.
We know that Mr. Martin is nothing more than the devil's superstar recruiter for Satan's army.
After compromising his artistic integrity by leaving a satanic children's music group Menudo, which translates roughly to Pig and Testons cooked up in the soup as an offering to Satan,
he hatched a devil's plan of unparalleled scope. He's orchestrating a sexually motivated invasion on the Protestant morality that has kept his nation intact for nearly 300 years.
The invasion of the Beatles was a tiny threat compared to this one.
And it goes on and on.
There you go Ricky Martin.
It can't think for sh**.
Is the devil God demo with a banana in his pants.

Here's a lady in Miami. Hello.
Yes, I am.
Great.
I'm calling about a new project that they're going to they want to start in homestead, the homestead airport. I don't know if you heard about that.
No.
Oh well, since they're talking so much about the E word, they're hardly talking about that about the environmentalists now allowing the airport going up because of the alligators and the birds and the ever.
Right. We don't want to mess with those gators.
Oh wow.
It's like an alarm, no.
Yeah.
You get an environmental impact statement that costs $5 million.
The federal government did it and it says it won't do anything to them.
Can beat that gator meat.
That's right.
Oh well.
Okay, take care.
Thanks.
I think I was giving her away.
I think she was looking for a sympathetic ear.
I don't really care about it.
We already got Opaloc here.
Isn't that interesting how we got to see somebody of the little local airports featured in the last week or two?
Isn't that pretty interesting?
Oh, Opaloc Airport, Tammy Amier, port.
Let's get North Perry Airport.
At least they got that good restaurant.
There are good buddy Maydays.
What's the name of the place?
Wow.
What a mind.
What a memory.
Of course, I'm not eating any of that stuff these days.
No.
For a little while.
Okay.
Our good pizons.
We appreciate it very much.
I'm not eating much of anything.
Certainly not here on the air.
We eating today.
Well, let's see.
5, 6, what?
I've been on my best behavior.
I'm doing very extraordinarily well.
And just because we didn't have any food in here yesterday, you look like you might be interested in something.
I've got my smoothie.
Oh, like I said, we're not eating today.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's North Miami.
Hello.
Hey, Neil Williams.
Great.
I hope you have a good day.
Question.
I'm having a great day, sir.
I'm having an E-Day-C-free, whatever it is, day.
Yeah, that's right.
That restaurant has North Perry E-Day's.
I wonder what the overall for the, the sisters of this, this, this contribution was the Barry University.
Uh-huh.
And then a bunch of crap.
Ah, unbelievable.
The National Council of Churches, that bunch of Tommy Pincobasters and the Catholic Church and sister Jean and the Janet Reno God.
What a, what a crew.
And I heard that I think it was great, but I know how many days they already offered the file of two minutes.
See, there we go again.
He's starting to talk.
See, into that.
See, I guess maybe we're listening in the beginning, sir.
This is an E-free, say no, no mention of any of that crap.
Don't you understand that?
No.
No.
The answer is no.
Just say no.
No.
No.
No.
No.
You got it?
No.
That's what I was afraid of.
I'm not interested, sir.
I don't care.
I don't care if they offered daddy $50 billion net and age green stamps.
I don't care.
I want peace.
I want release from this.
I want freedom.
I want my freedom.
Freedom.
To breathe, to think without being infested with that crap.

Let's pray for those goddamn titans.
What do you say?
Yeah.
Who you pulling for?
A Tennessee, I hope.
FC, man.
All right, there you go.
That's right.
Good thinking.
Never thought about that.
AFC, maybe Tennessee Titans kicks him serious ass.
Kick those religious nuts all the way to King.
Kick the ass to hell is what I say.
Maybe they'll run into Ricky Martin now.
Uh-huh.
With a banana and his thing.
I already got a banana and I don't want to say it.
Here's a pepper pie and tell him.
Meal.
Yes, sir.
I was just listening to you several days ago and I heard you talk about co-cute can.
Yes.
What else goes with it that you were talking about?
What else goes with it?
Well, you said you had co-cute.
You're using the pear tree.
I mean, what does that mean?
What else goes with it?
No, you were taking something else.
Condroitin or...
Condroitin or something that goes with it because I...
I said, far-draightin cop something like that.
What does that mean?
Condroitin.
I don't know.
I thought I went to get the co-cute.
Taking it.
Taking for what?
Well, I'm taking a full aghancid.
Oh, okay.
Because I was kind of like the way you were.
It's just lethargic and then the weight and I just don't have any energy.
Right.
You know, when I...
I co-cutanism, but I might give you little energy, but it's great for your heart.
It'll get your pulse down and it's tremendous for your heart.
Yeah, because your body manufactures co-cutan, but in most of us not enough.
Yeah, because I've got very high blood pressure and I heard you talking about that.
Well, if you got a heart problem, co-cutanism must...
It's good.
It's great.
Not good.
It's great.
Oh, okay.
But I thought I heard you mentioned something else that you were taking with it.
No, I did not.
Okay.
I had some colors mentioning all these things, but I don't know what the hell it was and you want to know.
Okay.
Hey, Neil, since you're talking about Rick Riley, could you play Rick Riley stole my briefcase?
Absolutely, sir.
Thank you.
And have a great day.
What else you're taking?
All the occasional barrier, man.
Five, six, seven, on the seat.
Most guys they put up an end in their pants, Ricky.
They put it in the front.
But in Ricky's case, back home, yeah.
Well, I made him feel like, you know, at home.
22 before noon at five sixty WQM.
It's Friday, you bastard.
Rick Riley stole my briefcase.
Oh, I like the fart in his face.
That's where he dink what gives him the rights.
Oh, I think it's why what I'll find it up tonight.
Rick Riley stole my briefcase.
What, what, this trace to the human race?
Oh, rigorous muck and yogurt sucks.
That wheel of meat should also include Rick Riley's butt bowl bowl.
Oh, Rick Riley stole my briefcase.
I like a fart in his face.
Rick Riley, you're an asshole.
18 till noon at five sixty WQM.
Jail, is it cursi?
Is that Javan Cursi that plays for what Tennessee is?
Is that an MKERS?
Sure.
Okay.
I know you would know if anybody knew.
I think he drives the race car on a weekend in the spare time.
The brother of Tennessee Titans defensive end Javan Cursi won't get to watch Sunday Super Bowl.
The mighty not even earned the outcome of the game till six days later.
Joseph Cursi who was serving seven and a half years for armed robbery is in confinement for January one fight at the Soto Correctional Institution in Arcadia near Sarisota.
Prison officials say the only way he'll learn the outcome of the game between Tennessee and St. Louis's difficult to be telling him.
Joseph Cursi was stripped of privileges for fighting with another inmate.
He was moved from an open dorm to a cell and then isolated section of the institution, which is not permitted to watch TV.
Listen to the radio.
Read the newspaper.
Use the telephone until February five.
Warden Linda Williams said officials will not make an exception.
That's not there to the other inmates just because he's got a brother in the Super Bowl.
She said we can't say we'll let you watch and not let somebody else watch because they don't be having a brother in the big damn Super Bowl.
Nice going, Air Linda.
Whatever your name is.
So how do you like that?
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line and all requests Friday here.
We're not mentioning the word today once.
We've succeeded almost two saw out.
We had one guy that dangerously started dancing around the edges of it and I had to send him on his way.
He just don't get the message.
He's just, he's got a problem.
You know, he's obsessed with this and they've gotten to him.
We're trying to give him a little bit of escape so we can clear his mind.
Clear out his...
Brackdom brains.
Here's Virginia Key.
Hello.
Hey, I'm Bill.
Yes, sir.
One. First, I had to comment on that woman's last comment.
You know, everybody likes to live down here and you can't live anywhere without the environment.
If you don't take care of the environment eventually it's going to kick you in the fly.
She didn't seem to consider about the gators and the manatees.
I'm going to report her to Carl Hyerson.
You know, imagine if you're flying back from Las Vegas and you're landing in the swamp with all the, you know, water...
Well, for a first call.
Who wants to land in a home state anyway?
Right.
What's the point?
Unless you live there and there's only about 10 white people lived on there.
Well, I'm trying to get a unique apartment.
As far as you know, I'm saying they're not flying.
Would all those bros that are down there, do you really want to land a plane having like one of those herons sucked into the turbine?
No.
Exactly.
That's the thing.
I'm going to have to put it.
Secondly, did you see the standard union last night, obviously?
Do I see what?
The standard union?
Of course, I watched the entire thing.
I thought it was very good.
I thought it was very good too.
I was very, very surprised and pleased and happy that he ended things off that way.
And I guess in closing I want to request Smoke to join for Bill and for Mr. Bush.
For Mr. Bush?
Yeah, because he's smoking too.
You know it.
I thought you'd join in the morning.
I thought you'd join tonight.
I thought you'd join in the afternoon.
All right.
Make me feel all right.
I thought you'd join.
You'd time up here.
That's the only time I've gone.
I thought you'd join before I thought you'd join.
I said I'd join tomorrow.
Oh, my daddy, he wants to meet you.
He's got you, he's got me.
From mama, he wants to meet you.
You should be there, you can.
Then one day I met him.
I came from me and said,
hard work to do and hard work to find.
First take care of him.
So now I spoke to you, when I get up,
in the car I spoke to you, join.
I spoke to you, join when I believe you're gay.
And at every 10,000 points I spoke to you.
I spoke to you, join.
It's time up here.
That's the only time I've gone.
I spoke to you, join, you join.
I said I'd join tomorrow.
Oh, my daddy, he wants to meet you.
He's got you, he's got me.
From mama, he wants to meet you.
You should be there, you can.
Then one day I met him.
He's got me, I said.
Hard work to do and then hard work to find.
So take care of him.
That's why I spoke to you, join.
It's time up here.
I spoke to you, join.
It's making me feel all right.
I spoke to you, join.
It's time up here.
It's time up here.
I spoke to you, join.
And then I spoke to you, join.
All right.
That's what I do.
I spoke to the church with me any morning.
I spoke to the church with me every afternoon.
I spoke to the church with my mother.
I spoke to the church with my mother.
I spoke to the church with my mother.
I spoke to the church with my mother.
I spoke to the church with my mother.
That's what I do.
It's 1148 at 560 WQAM, your pre-station for the 90s.
You're e-free.
A couple of interesting things in the middle of a bunch of other stuff here.
The dolphins will be changing their name to the Mime tampon.
They're only good for one period and have no second string.
Dan Moreno will be replaced by Monica Lewinsky, who will no doubt blow a few,
but won't choke on the big ones.
Not bad.
Not bad, Julio.
I'll get to this to Anna Quinlan.
Will I get to that thing?
Maybe not.
No.
All depends on whether these phone calls keep coming in here.
And if they can handle, we've almost threw two hours of pre-eat talk today.
I'll request Friday.
A little bit of an escape for you.
This town deserves a break.
They deserve an escape.
Believe you, me, a big one.
5.6705.60.505.60 on the AT&T line.
Hank will be in the Super Bowl in Atlanta again today,
between two and six books tonight, six to ten.
Why sure, I hope he and Kiss and Chris more than once again tonight.
And then we got the Ed Kaplan 10 o'clock tonight,
who will give you the latest line on the Super Bowl,
and get a line up all these of the punks that we got out here working on.
By the way, there were two guys that got their legs broken out here this morning before it came in, Joe.
Yeah, two of the sports punks got their legs broken because they're like a week past.
Do we have a bookies?
Very sad.
When you told me, I mean, I already knew that, but to actually hear somebody say it.
Now, can we mention any names?
We want to mention any names of some of these sports nerds who are like in this gambling on ballgame stuff.
Sure.
All of them.
All of you above?
To the man.
All of them.
Now, how come I'm not Robert?
Because I was talking about this when Robert was in there, and he'd like, uh,
crawled under the table.
Robert bets on sporting events.
Little punky Robert.
I really like that.
I really like that.
I really play as a dernyine bucks on the Super Bowl.
What, I don't think he's to the point of having enough cash to drop on it, right, would like to.
He would love to.
I've heard the conversations.
Oh, yeah.
Well, they're giving up eight points.
So GA members in waiting is what we got.
Very sad.
Very, very, very sad.
5, 6, 7, 0, and I've got to say this is a record today.
This is the first time in all the years I've been on the air.
I've actually had three producers on the same show.
Oh.
George started out.
He's been sick.
And we had Robert for a little while.
And the joke came in again because you know, we can put it on his time sheet.
I don't understand what kind of job you have now.
You like being phased out or like, uh, what is it?
I am the, uh, I went from bored up, you know, uh, under length to struggling air host, hopefully.
Yeah.
And that's it.
So the Saturday morning, we're spider-bite.
I don't forget tomorrow morning at six o'clock.
That sports motor crap.
I mean, that's great.
I think George has got.
That's right.
And that's it.
That's my gig.
And they're paying you by the hour or something.
Yeah, they are.
And I can link some updates and do this.
This is great.
One more.

Then all of a sudden they disappeared and godfathers started
from this down and now the good news is godfathers is back.
Yeah, so who the hell needs all that

We probably wouldn't have this come in because when you're feeling this crappy as he is you want to eat no?
So isn't this like poetic justice? I mean George bailes out here this morning and all of a sudden we get Godfather's which he's gonna be really port off about that
Too bad George that'll settle again even with that e crap even though you're not responsible for it

We just want the money from the advertisers. We don't care about putting on a good spot. You know that
Why is the studio also the reverb on everyone in his spot too? Because somebody didn't close the potter a smoke it or something like that
I don't know I may see now you're nitpicking when I first came here a couple years ago
They used to play these crappy sounding distorted spots and I started screaming about it
And they looked at me like boy you stirring up trouble. That's just the way we do things here
And now two years later I say okay. I don't care. They don't care. Why should I care?
I thought maybe the point was to get my attention and get me upset so I keep listening right that's it now
Somebody caught on dammit. Have a great day sir

Keep bastards. Here's cutler rage. Hello
Color rich
Let me say it again. Here's color rage. Hello. Yes, sir. How you doing great. I used to be a manager at Godfather's Pizza
So I can give you time to get into mouth. Oh right here. We go now. We're getting to the meat of the matter
Which one where we at I was in color. I gave up at the time. Okay
What happened to it at the beginning was pills very came in and bought out
Godfather's Pizza Incorporated right and they started making them do things like the deep pan pizza crap and that
No, not really. All right. Well, they made them do deep pan pizza and they had the employees coming in at four o'clock in the morning
But I mean Godfather's is deep pan. I mean, that's what their product is
Well, remember they came out with a thicker thing as there was the original pizza
Which was then you know the one that came out with the original like then they came out with deep pan pizza
Okay, then we had to come in at four o'clock in the morning start baking its crap before we other even unlock the door
The employees were going home
Okay, so from the beginning
Pills very came in and started screwing everything out. In other words the problem is the pills very doughboy
He's the he's a chigger in the wood pile. That's right
And they made him spend like you know 150,000 dollars to roll out this deep pan out of every store
You know, they made him spend a lot of money
It's been a lot of my employees
You know, we're baking this stuff and then it didn't work and then
So then they just started losing so much money after that. That's good up a good thing
Right, I mean they came in. I mean the original pizza was the best of taco pizza. Actually, I mean no shadow of a doubt
It's phenomenal and then after that a couple years after that they folded to this guy
Who has a restaurant down in Kotler Ridge
Who basically I think his family you know set them down here to getting some to do
He took like what he and like 40 stores at the time he ended up taking them down to one
You know he closed all the other ones down even the ones that were making money he just couldn't run the business at all
Yeah, and then uh he opened up this thing called the Eddie Hux Wings and things and tried doing that
And he opened up three and then closed those down good
But Javier he was all show window dressing. He was a really yeah. Yeah, I'm a manager
He was windowed. He was pretty good window dressing. You knew Javier? Yeah, I knew Javier
I was there from the beginning. He used to come by my station in W.S. New Zealand. I'm a little abroad
You know right off the Dixie Highway. Yeah, he used to come by and bring us some good stuff and pizzas too
Really? Yeah
But was it wasn't his family that was uh, no, it wasn't his family. He was just a manager. Oh thank god
Because I thought maybe he's behind bars now. I know he'd be real busy if that happens
I mean yeah, the owner was a Polish guy from Omaha. Oh a Polish now they had their headquarters in Omaha, right? All right
That's what the uh, yeah, he bought the franchise from down here and the eventually ended up moving down here
But a Polish guy I think that explains it
Thanks for the good news pal. All right. Thank you. I know how it is. Okay. There you go. Oh this guy knew Javier
Yeah, that was always my favorite Javier pizza
567 that heavy on the pepperoni 567 0560 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line
See now for new Cubans down here could be just like Javier and Miguel
See like with Miguel. He's like generic. I mean you wouldn't know that he was Cuban
He could be like Colombian Venezuelan Puerto Rican Guadamal and he could be anything besides just looking pretty good
You know what I'm saying? He's hysterical though. What do you mean by that?
He and George have had some big time hysterical discussions in here about what about the Cubans and
blocking the streets and
Are you starting talking about that now?
Next thing you're gonna be saying that
And I'm gonna have a statement about your dad's penis pizza. Yeah hysterical Cuban. Oh, that's he's a professional Cuban my good friend Miguel
Absolutely, I could cure that I could straighten him out
560 at 0560 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line as we're rolling along on an e-free Friday here at QAM
The sports leader sports radio 560
Q a f it's Friday you
Hey four years the Italian people have been known for a few things
Goblin your shoes making threatening phone calls when you're bound to check in a family restaurant and carving little puppets
They come alive sitting in the little boys singing air goddle strings on me
But recently they've discovered a secret to nice hard crunchy spaghetti when you boil ordinary pasta
It gets off the mushy but barilla always cooks up al dente which is Italian for well
Technically it's some kind of term. I don't know
But if your pasta is not al dente then it's not barilla 40 years. I've been eroing my own pasta
But now with the advent of barilla by grandchildren don't even come all the animals a tradition passed down from generation to generation
Made of the finest shot up your face when I find it as soon as I thought a part of my family
I'll make a phone cause of my cousin schoengele and mr
Or whatever his name is will bite youself in the tongue of a leaky that's through a pasta the choice
I spit on you very little
From my father to do that to get us in the mode for godfathers today
I think we're already in the mood
Yeah, leave it to me to be the guinea pig to find out if this godfathers is justice
But in the course it's so many years ago. Am I gonna remember if it's just as good?
Oh, if it's good, I'll let you know though, and I'm pretty sure it will be
Here's you know, I hate to break the news to you folks, but this is twice this hour
We say we got through two hours with no problem at all. Are we talking about that today?
I said it's an e-free
Friday we're not mentioning that name and I'm gonna dump it you will not be on a year

Stop enough not anyone out one more word. Okay. No find somebody else that'll talk about that crap
Got a phone with the gallon there. He's all worked up about it talk to him
God is that incredible? I mean, I was rolling along no problem at all and all of a sudden they just after two hours

I'd like to I'd like to make a shameless request. Yeah, could you play stolen with darn L?
Okay, and could you do it before one of your breaks because it's over here and they're
I'm on seven seventy. I got to listen to you on and they always cut your bits off. Oh hey,
I hate when they cut that off. Okay, pal. You go. Great job. Thanks. Thank you
This is learning to spell with Don L
I've been Don L Jackson and today we're going to spell the word consensus
Philip with me now
Consensus
CONSENS US
Now let's use it in a sentence
Because what you say those cops consensus to jail
This is learning to spell with Don L. I've been Don L Jackson
This is learning to spell with Don L. I've been Don L Jackson and today we're going to spell the word defense
Fellard with me now defend
D-E-S-E-N-S-E
Now let's use it in a sentence
I ruined my new high top climbing over defense
This was learning to spell with Don L. I've been Don L Jackson
All right, there's all this stuff. It's over the price of one twelve sixteen and five sixty
I think what it is a lot of these people are getting forked off that we're getting the free godfather's pizza and they're not could that be it
Too bad at least I'm gonna be your guinea pig. I'll let you know if it's good or bad or indifferent in between then you go over there and spend your own hard and money
Here's poppin. Oh, hello. Hey, good afternoon. Yeah, sir real quick question about the game last night
Did you really think the winter said it was that blatant?
I didn't I saw the tape of it. I didn't see it live. I was too busy watching because I don't know what it is in this in this marketplace
Between Rimmer and Pott Finn and the two guys that know nothing about hockey in the morning
You would have thought that somebody was shot in the back of the head and was left late the dead. Yeah, I mean
I just don't understand. I mean it was a good physical game line of light and maybe it was it's like that many of the times that those two teams
And then the in the bottom line is that Philadelphia won the game that bad Panther defense in first period allowed them three goals
None of what should have happened and in spite of burden playing standing on his head and playing great
They still won the game so all these people that want to either talk about Eric is dirty and right
Isn't more well-gratin than we have all those great fights. It's all window dressing. It means nothing
Well, you know, I'm glad there's an actual hockey voice that knows what they're talking about here down here
And I appreciate it. Thank you very much, but yeah
And then like I said before there is a one
Panther fan with a brain with a brain that is who wouldn't want Eric Lindross on our team
But oh he's so dirty. Well, you know, that's just the way it goes
That's the price of peanuts in the big city. You're gonna go out there like Kim Bocampus says you want to play with the big boys
You can't go out there and cry and be a bunch of putteys
Here's a mobile and Delray B chill out. Yeah, sit down. Yeah, sit down. No, not you also. I'm sorry. I'm already sitting down
Hey, that's not as if I thought you should be happy to know I'm picking up my gun. I'm trading in on for a flight jacket
Yeah, get the gun out of the house finally
But that's not like old
Oh and congratulations on the shaky speech though. I mean godfather's yeah
Yeah, I'll give you a say it's not any shaky. No, I can't talk. I want to phone
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T like and see pretty soon
We're gonna be going to music and then we're gonna enjoy our pizza and peace, okay?
Because these people are out of material you're able to do it for two hours today
And I applaud you for that. I commend the audience
They were doing an e-free day today and they they we actually found some other things
There's not a lot going on besides the Super Bowl which do we want to talk about it? Oh no except for goat titans
But now you're pretty much the well has run dry because uh, and maybe the media's got a point here
Maybe you're just as one dimensional as your local TV channels. I think that you are
Because speaking for myself, which is the only person I can speak for I don't want to hear no more about that crack two day
And since that hearing is on the 6th of March that gives us all a month of February and a couple more days in January like this weekend
Where quite frankly, I prefer not to hear anymore about it
There's nothing to talk about. There's nothing more to say about it. How's it been enough
Enough of the crap
Here's a mobile and Jupiter hello
Leo what's going on? Yes, sir. Maybe you have a charge any people for calling here something
Have make a donation to the station. Listen God for his pizza. I had it about two months ago. And it was pretty average
Average I thought so. Yeah. Good pizza down here is about us common at a rational Cuban. Mm-hmm
So I'm not a material. Okay
Now he was like I said the audience is out of material
Three percent of the video. Yeah pretty perceptive

Oh look at this Pillsbury doleboy
Dear friends, it's with the set of start. I've got a pass on the following
Please join me remembering a great icon veteran Pillsbury spokesperson Pillsbury doleboy that yesterday of a severe yeast infection and complications from repeated
Post of the belly he was 71
Over was burdened slightly greased coffin
Thousands of celebrities turned out including Mrs. Butterworth the California raisins hungry jack Betty Crocker and the hostess Twinkies kept in crunch and many younger
Ungers long time friend Aunt Yamama delivered the old
Describing doleboy as a man who never knew how much he was needed. That's with a K
I couldn't help but wonder what kind of flower I should send
That's with an OU. This is cute real corny, but it's real cute. How about your beef o-synthes? I thought he was on vacation

Not some kind of gutless wonder like this guy not want to talk about that
Honduras boring crap that nobody would a brain wants to hear anymore about
Let's get with it. Let's get a life here today
And then the good thing is the way I actually had a few calls about that Panther game last night, but that's not even the most and more foolish myth
Out of Eric is so dirty. What are we gonna do? We're so dirty
Butch up a little bit. That's what I say you're gonna play with a big boys. You got a butch up isn't that the team that
The Panthers I mean the lead speed to play off last year. Oh, yeah, dirty or not
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello

Of course
Where do you think it goes? I've heard of payouts that if he dies, you know, sorry. No
I'll I'll be able to sum it go. I mean they can't do that. Can they do that? I don't know and quite frankly
I don't care because she's no bagging. I'm not related to her. So who gives a crap
Some 500-year-old bitch goes there spends 27 bucks in a slot machine
That's only nine pulls and wins the mega bucks jackpot that lots and lots of people including yours truly two weekends ago

And I'm just muttering and screaming and puking my guts out of this old bag

Oasis from this will
Is that the case? No, no
They're just abandon you every time you try to do something good give an alternative. They just abandon you
Oh, no, we want to talk about

Absolutely positively no
Oh
26 after 12 at 560 WQ
Manage toss
I am
Sports fans I love sports I eat sports drink sports
Sleep on sports and I listen to sports radio all the time
So I think you need the inside cake on what's going on
And now we got the Super Bowl coming up and I'm really getting hyped up at all this media stuff to do it
Like I like to follow along because I could be what's happening and
We're gonna do like
Go to like to my friend house with a 60 inch screen and we're gonna drink like three year and
Then we have bean dip you know and I'm gonna take off my shirt
Right there in the game like you see people do like a Super Bowl and I'm gonna make my arms go like this and go
And then I'm gonna do that y'all you know
You know that that that meaningless Yale
And you know sports is really all about my life because I love talking about sports talking about sports with my buddies and stuff
You know because you know some of them they got wives and girlfriend stuff and I
Have enough a chance to have one of them. Oh sure when I'm with my buddies
I talk about getting laid oh sure sure sure sure I've had one of those and I've had got laid but but the mainly sports
Forge is what I know that's right. I talk about sports all the time and and I go home
So I got really my efficiency is a hot plate and I sit in bed and drop cracker crumbs in my underwear
And that's all my life pretty much consists of outside of sports
It was a boy sign after all I
God my life
pathetic
Sign them up new PD maybe 1231 at 560 WQM 560 705 60
Palm 560 on the AT&T right-of-slime. It's a
Free Friday here on QAM
Four hours of escape from this grotesque crap this swill
This Schmidt
Here's for Lauderdale. Hello good afternoon. Yeah, sir
Bless you for the E3 Friday. Uh-huh. Thank you and the price is right. Yes, sir. I like to set you straight
You should part in the expression on the lady who won the 35 mil right?
She is a very hot middle-aged blonde cocktail waitress. Oh really?
Tell me was it old bang. No, she was on good morning America this morning. All right now. I feel better
And you know if I was traveling on a business trip in Vegas, she would definitely do no
She's gonna be around long enough to collect the money there you go
Well, she she and she wasn't a one-shotter. She went every week and put in
21 dollars. Yeah, half of it with hers and yeah, he put in 27 half of it with somebody on it
No, no this time she put in six extra and that's why she won it and she split it every week with her boyfriend
Right, and she's giving him half the money. Well, isn't that sweet, but she is hot. All right. Thank you
I feel much better. Thank you. See that's good
I mean, not that it really makes any difference
But it's just the idea of some old 90-year-old bag that's gonna croak in about two months winning 35 million while I was living in
Greetings beautiful people around there in Vegas. That would have been depressing
So are we glad that some beautiful young brought one instead of us? No, no, we wanted
No, I don't care how voluptuous or fantastic. I wouldn't care if it was like
Ray Whitney's twin brother who won I I don't care what they look like. I want to god their money. Am I am not that I'm greedy? Am I?
Oh, why not
Why's it always got to be somebody else see that this is the philosophy when you buy the lottery ticket or you go to one of those machines with a gigantic
progressive jackpot
You think in your mind. They've got your brain washed into believing somebody's gonna win it
So why not me? You know I'm talking about somebody's got to win it there will be a winner eventually soon or later
So why the hell not me it could be just as well me as anybody else couldn't it? No, no
No, not really
But you think that they've got your condition to the believing that and that's why you keep plunging in there and plunging and plunging
What are the um one of the mega
Whatever that make a bucks jackpot thing. I played in that one like 300 bucks on it
And I got up and I walked away and I'm watching and I some guy gets on air and hit like four spins later a thousand eighty bucks
What are you doing watching the slot machine you just left you're supposed to run as fast
Well, I was playing the the quarter wheel of fortune in there and it was right around the corner from this
So I just thought out a curiosity since this oh no, in fact actually I was playing the one on the end
I went back and played again and this guy had just sat down about his fourth or fifth pull
He was pulling it and he hit like you know triple triple something and he didn't even know what it was and I looked around the things
How much is that I said a thousand eighty bucks?
And his friend came over to oh good now you're here. Oh even for the day now you don't have to be in such a bad mood
Which maybe feel a little bit better in other words, here's a guy
But why did I feel better in other words? I had two or three hundred credits on there and I'm playing for a thirty two million dollar jackpot
That's supposed to be the idea is getting all those credits so you have more polls when it doubt pull it out
But I you know, but I've learned my lesson because
Feeding a machine given a money back if I could have all the money right now that I've given back that I was ahead over the years
I wouldn't be here right now. I'd be long gone
Done that's just dumb
It's just like if you find a hot machine and this is another example getting up and walking away
If it's loose it's loose if she's loose she's loose
Like this cocktail waitress
Maybe Frito was bangin' her and her friends to what a time here's power pines hello
Yeah, if I guys hold my funder she is a cocktail waitress. Oh, thank god. Don't we say what better now that uh no
No, not really if you go to our boyfriend and have she's gonna share where family she comes from family eight kids isn't that nice and
You know, I lived there for six years and Vegas really? Yeah
My wife dragged me back to a cemetery building. Oh boy, but I think I'm going back soon
I can't take it. I lived in this joint for 30 years. It's a toilet
It is and I'm I gotta go back. I can't take this place. Yeah, but how did you live out there that long without the
I worked in the casino. I worked at the Aladdin
There you go. I worked at the Aladdin before they blew it up right and
I'll be right by the banish others a shift boss in the poker room at the Aladdin
You know the only good thing about that old Aladdin was they had a really good before the Aladdin was the best
Hotel in the world, but they didn't take care of it. That's why they had a blow
It's not an end the war great to a thing the wall was was breaking right was breaking up so they had
Eventually blew it up. They were going to re-bottle it and they changed their mind. So they're building a new one now. Oh
Good. Yeah, they finished April be finished. Yeah, I saw the beginning when I was at already a while I put my job back great excellent
I'll see you there. All right. Thanks. See there's a guy that went to Vegas and lived there for six years and came back here and said oh
Bad mistake bad move. I mean, you know when you you can smell the excitement here. Can't you?
Oh, it's the philosophy bags. I thought that was the excitement. I was smelling
We don't want too much excitement. Who won a nice and quiet the only excitement out there is
occasional demonstration and riot and protest but other than that, let's keep it nice and quiet
You know and the sounds the only other
Exhibition of their sounds of the car smashing into each other from all the people out there driving
No business. We've got their license in the box of cracker. Jack you know what I'm talking about. That's the excitement
23 before one any minute now they're gonna be bringing in that pizza boy. I don't know what should I do?
Should I maybe I'll watch you have a piece and see if it's really good
Huh and if you're gagging on it America loves to watch boobs and butts and bointing
The

If you never hear the jail cell lock, check it out,

Never been criminal they did like.
Now if you could catch the ball,
or look at the ball with race of murder,

Oh, right.
As long as they can, just the bleachers.
It's still out, Sunday is clean.
Well, who cares who gets ready long as they are making money

He'd be better than I do, or have no doubt.
No wonder they're for beyond the ground.

5-6705-60, pound 5-60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's North Miami.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
How you doing?
Good to have an E-Fee Friday, huh?
5-6705-60, pound 5-60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Out of townline, 877-785-60-345.
877-785-NIIL.
Got that?
That's how we spell it here.
In English.
Here's the mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Jirida, I'd say sports paper.
About my hair.
Tom Osborne, running for Congress and Prattick.
Another right wing asshole, Congress guy, yeah.
I think what it feels can be his campaign manager, I've heard.
Okay, thanks for the good news.
Yeah, Tom Osborne.
You know, he's got a football coach and now he never been under another guy.
Never met a criminal he didn't like.
So he's got to run for Congress now.
Maybe he can give a special dispensation.
He can partner all of those ex-criminals that play in Nebraska.
Oh, and by the way, this article by Anna Quinlan in Newsweek.
She talks about Mike Tyson that said, what's any more talking about?
Is it no football player Tito Wooten was signed $8 million deal with New York Giants two years ago,
less than a month after a girlfriend would accuse him of beating a rough committed suicide in his garage.
His past history had included two college expulsions and five arrests, three for violence against women.
Wooten was cut last month by the Indianapolis Colts.
Let's say a prayer that he's not dating.
Christian Peter seems to have made you that the University of Nebraska in football drinking and sex crime.
Speaking of Tom Osborne, he too was signed by the Giants, although during college he had pleaded no contest to one charge of sexual assault served 10 days on a subsequent charge and was accused of twice raping a freshman woman with whom he eventually settled a civil suit.
The Giants staff psychologist has said that Peter has cleaned up his act and that his behavior was influenced by alcoholism and attention deficit disorder.
We'll see how the AADD defense works for less well placed sex criminals.
Let's be fooled by the argument that this is all merely a reflection of our six society. There is this Jeff Benedict who has written two books about athletes and violence to the survey of 10 schools which found that while athletes made up 3% of the population, they were responsible for nearly 20% of the reported sexual assault.
Let me say it again.
Athletes make up 3% of the population but they're responsible for nearly 20% of the reported sexual assaults.
John Rocker must suspect that he would have gotten more of a break if he would have raped some woman then shot off his big stupid mouth.
What a great article.
Nice going to Anna Quinlan in the Newsweek magazine on the back inside page this week.
Here's Delray B.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Delray.
Sounds like you.
Okay.
Long time, long time.
All right.
Listen, that woman that won the 35 mil.
Yeah.
She's a young lady.
She's not even in a late 30s.
That's what's up.
We've just had three calls about that, right?
Oh, you did?
Uh-huh.
Cocktail waitress.
You're right.
Very attractive.
You have to have the money to work with her.
Yes. So once you talk about her later, you must look at his mother.
I have a mother.
What is it?
The mother of the aunt.
Somebody gave us some bad information.
That's all you know how that goes.
Yeah.
Somebody gave us some of BS.
Okay.
Thanks.
All right.
Somebody put the BS into our IBS into our.

The right phone number to call if it gets lost.
In case it gets lost.
Not that we want to be pushing or anything like that.
Do we want to be pushing?
Uh-huh.
But just that it sounds.
It really sounds to be true.
You know, it's like you can't go back like I was talking about the other day.
Try to go back to Detroit.
No, your favorite restaurant.
The restaurants are closed down and try to go back to Rochester and Don Abominant.
The same as it used to be.
And no matter where you try to go back.
Is it ever the same?
No.
Go back to Boston.
Is Prince Pagetti House still there?
No.
That's been gone for a hundred years.
Audio people from New England boy.
Are the old parts like me.
If you remember the Prince Pagetti House.
It was a chain in Boston.
That was the best.
The best.
The menu would be like just like on the spaghetti page.
You're like 600 different kinds of spaghetti with with sausage with meatballs with the peppers.
With this.
Oh man, was that a good place.
So when you have been Boston in those days, every day was Prince Pagetti Day.
Which is why I gained about 6,000 pounds there.
Here's Miami.
Hello.

Georgie Bush says that his nose is clean and never puts a thinnest.
Because he's running for the wide house, so he took 10-10 minutes.
Don't drunken that's not all even down the fume's feet ball.
And college, and he drugged with doom.
He even dropped some master shoes.
Why won't George get come out and simply say he did it?
He preferred the press would shut their mouth.
But if some of you got them dancing.
He did more than what you think.
But he washed it down the sea.
And he preferred cocaine to have.
That's the question that he does.
And he made his point much clearer.
Like a razor on a mirror.
But he wants the two believes.
That he didn't do anything.
Georgie Bush says that his nose is clean and never puts a thinnest.
Because he's running for the wide house.
So he took 10-10 minutes.

Kind of a battle here today, but we've gotten to nearly three hours.
We had a dump of you with the e-words on here.
Because some of these people are a little bit slow and some are compulsive.
And they can't come up with any other material.
They're part of the problem.
I'm suggesting today you ought to be part of the solution and not part of the guy damn *** problem.
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello.
Hello. Yes, sir.
Neil. Yes, I am.
OK. I don't know if you've seen this on Tompins Saturday.
In Russia, they have a news program.
Yeah.
And while the lady, the news lady is given the news, she strips.
And the same thing with the girl that was given the weather.
She had a big red.
And she started to take her off while she was given the weather.
June is the number one rated show in Russia.
And I wouldn't you think that our local channels here were getting a lot higher ratings instead of all this e-crap that they're putting on every day?
Yeah, but I don't know who was suffered baby ballapi.
Who else would you want to see strip on?
Oh, I'm talking about them.
They'd have to bring in some real people.
Yeah.
Number one rated show.
Thanks, one.
Thanks for the good news.
OK. Bye.
So anyway, Ponomache Padawski or what?
No.
Oh, I'm sorry.
5607-0560.
A pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's Delray B, chill out.
Anyhow you're doing great.
I just wanted to thank you for being such an outspoken hockey fan because you turned me onto it with the help of you and a friend of mine.
And I've been going to games past year.
I've worked a lot of games, actually.
I had a great time and I've never seen anyone play like Pavel Burry.
Yeah.
He's got all the good stuff.
Oh, he does play like Pavel Burry.
Do you ever see the foot moves he does on a way he thinks he'll almost stop it and instant just, oh, he's just delicious.
I'm yours.
But I just wanted to thank you and I'm a long time listener.
And I have a shameless request for you.
Yeah, sir.
Can I give a plug to my band that's playing Sunday night?
Sure.
All right, six cents is playing at Culture Room in Fort Lauderdale, a group of Art and Federal.
Come on, Rock Sunday night.
And a coin.
Thank you.
You bet.
Okay, there's a real Panther fan there.
I've come back to the games.
He knows Pavel Burry.
He knows the difference between that and the beret strips that you stick on your nose.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
It's so sad.
We've actually got some good things here in this town.
And most of the people you say you tell them what are you to mention it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like, what are you talking about, man?
What are you talking about?
I'm doing what you want to talk about that thing, but a little kid.
I mean, why don't you talk about that?
Yeah.
No.
No.
I would say that in the history of the human race.
I mean, Princess Diana.
That would be a close second.
But I would say that this has already passed that.
Left it standing in the awake of its hysteria.
This terms of overkill.
Not even close.
Diana.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I think the guy who called and is bringing the pizzas is the same guy who is bringing George the Pokemon cards.
Oh, it could be.
Maybe in fact, maybe he'll bring them both.
Maybe the pizza is the crust will be made out of the Pokemon cards.
And a sandwich request.
Yes, sir.
I know you can't fill.
Dwayne stop.
Okay.
You got it.
You're welcome.
Where the hell is Dwayne stop?
Dwayne.
What is that?
Dwayne something.
I don't even know what that line is.
Where is Dwayne stop?
God damn it.
Start in there.
Am I going to have to look at it?
I'm positive it's in there.
Where's my buddy Dwayne stop when I need him?
There's Dwayne something fun, which I don't even know what that is.
And I'll join some guy named Dwayne.
Oh, that's not it.
I'll find it for you.
Just don't panic.
56670560, pound 516.
Maybe it's under stump.
You think it's under stump?
I sure is, don't.
No.
All I can say is.
I'll have to find out one of the best of this.
It's back there.
Just relax.
Everybody hang loose.
So what were you saying about Miguel?
This is 560.
QAL.
QAM drops the green flag with motorsport Saturday.
Oh, yeah.
I'm going to get fixed with Chocostello right here on Sport Radio 560.
QA.
A.
Sport Radio 560.
C.
I'm going to have to put the battery down.
It's still water to fill out work.
Since the abuse awareness campaign, this is take 9.
Maybe.
Wait.
Wait, that's your Q.
Oh, right.
You're ready.
Ready, Dwayne?
Oh.
Hi.
This is Dwayne's stump of Black tooth.
Telling you, if you do drugs this weekend, don't drive.
Wrong again, Dwayne.
It's don't do drugs.
Don't do drugs.
That's what I said.
Oh, it's not.
It's not even close to what you said.
You coming into the booth, I showed you how close it was.
Sure luck.
We're going to do it again, Dwayne.
Say, don't do drugs.
If you must drink this holiday, we can do not drive.
Take 12.
This is Dwayne's stump.
Weekends are for drugs.
Do drugs.
Okay, Dwayne.
Thank you very much for coming in.
I think with a little editing, we've got something we can use.
Don't do drugs.
And if you must drink this holiday, we can.
Drive!
That's not just like a lot of those live spots
that we have from certain shows on the station you know I'm talking about.
That they like a piece together.
So, hang on.
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hey, what's up, Uncle Nia?
Yes, sir.
I'm listening.
You want to hear something funny?
Do you know that one of your advertisers, your budget Renekar,
advertisers that do answer the phone?
He's named Paul Schmidt.
I'm getting the Schmidt's just when I hear that.
Well, speaking of Schmidt, I was reading in the paper today on our lovely
Harold and the People section about a Kelsey grammar takes on the taboo
cause for IBS for Schmidt.
Yeah, I saw that.
Yeah, and it says, uh...
I've got a Schmidt problem.
Apparently, as Gofen's got the Schmidt problem, must be that way he drives something like that.
Right.
But yeah, I just thought I'd tell you, you've got a new spokesperson for your Schmidt.
No, he was on TV this morning giving a song of dance about the IBS.
Oh.
Or feeding some BS.
Yeah, he needs to remove the BS.
That's what he needs to do with us.
Oh, hey, pal.
Do me a favor, man.
You're the Schmidt.
For the Schmidt, play a, uh...
Mombo movement number two.
You got it.
All right, buddy.
Okay.
Mombo movement number two, that couldn't be that Bogey Brian thing, could it?
Good.
Oh, right.
Oh.
Right.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
The way I move around wins I go to.
I cause a mombo movement to both two.
I'm the toilet seat that's against the way to the mombo beat the radio play.
So we got a load and I'm all through.
There's just one thing I got to do.
There's a bit of faith but it's all I need.
I like to make my high needs.
I said G.
Let's go.
I don't have to push.
I make control when I move inside the side of the toilet pole.
I never have to spray.
It comes out whole.
It looks a little like a 2-3 roll.
I just wait through the left and wait through the right.
I'm thinking of being a genius and I'll tell you why.
Not only are you burning calories,
but you'll never, ever get a big red ring.
That's why we're such guys.
Who can't use the exercise?
You can have enough fun when they flip the five-mo movement up or two.
Hey, look at me, Alex.
I'm doing the manbo.
Hey, come on, do it.
There was no way I'm here to cut off and stop it.
Get out, get out, get out.
I'll cut off, get out.

Oh, man, I feel like I've gained 20 years on my life
for the e-free Friday here today.
What a great idea.
Nice going, Neil.
Thank you.
Neil, come on.
So all I can say, you've got to have a sense for the timing.
There's a time when you go with a flow and there's another time when you give it a rest.
You put it back in its place.
You let it breathe a little bit and you give it a little bit of a rest.
And do we need a rest or what?
560-7-0560.
Pound 560.
What is that that you got on your head?
That'd be bad.
Oh, that's the funky cap plus the ski cap on top.
That OJ left when he was hanging out here with...
Roar!
And Sam.
Isn't it great?
It's a lovely thing.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Is this Neil?
Sounds like me.
What's going on?
I just want to say it's great delivering in a free country like America.
Uh-huh.
You have a freedom to turn the TV off whenever you please.
Right.
So I think a lot of people should take that advice and just turn the guy to MTV off whenever they hear something about E.
Oh, okay.
Oh, he scared me.
I'm sorry.
My fingers really let you.
Sorry about that.
I thought he was going to say that, you know.
I protected him.
I covered his ass.
So to speak.
560-7-0560.
Pound 560.
Odyght and T wireless line.
That out of town, I weighed a couple of calls before buyers.
They're not too exciting.
I mean, if 50 billion people over here have no material, why should we expect a bunch of poor bastards over there to have some material?
Do we expect them?
No.
No, just maybe a little toe jam.
Plus, they're getting ready for the big rallies this weekend over there.
You know how that is.
They got all their pointy hats out and everything over there in four miles.
That's just a bunch of rumors.
There's no red necks over there, right?
Uh-huh.
Come on.
Let's do Jupiter.
Hello.
Neil, sounds like you're going to have a great weekend.
I am.
It sounds great today, man.
I feel great.
I do.
I can't help but just got father's pizza.
Don't make me have a relapse, you know.
I don't want to work with the bad case of the mitts again.
Did it get there?
No, any minute now.
The guy's always way.
He's almost here.
You can almost know him.
I hope he wouldn't pull Smith there.
Did, um, did you, there's a woman behind you at the hockey game that's yours the game?
Have you ever seen her there before?
Uh, right behind you.
I didn't notice.
I didn't think I figured he wouldn't but that.
Was he more on?
Oh, he really?
No, no, no.
Well, to me, she was.
I was up and up or down with the knackers.
So I didn't know if he's, most of you never see all these sat there or not.
I mean, it's kind of hard when somebody's seeing directly behind you, like to turn around and stare at them, you know, which, of course, he must, she must not have given a hard time or something.
He didn't notice her but.
No.
You see, Doug, he was up the game last night.
Doug McLean?
Yeah, he was up in the sky.
Up in, uh, where the press, uh, the press guys are with, um, talking to, uh, the spokesman.
I wish I wouldn't own that.
I'd have been up there and given some, uh, Schmidt about the Marty Straca.
Yeah, I would have.
Yeah.
Um, that was that game.
Did you ever, have you ever felt like that when you left the game like the dirty game?
No, I, I, I, let me just tell you, I didn't leave.
We ran out.
I mean, not, not just to beat the crowd because that's easy.
But I mean, I ran out with the feeling of such nausea and such grotesque, uh, inexplicable, uh, psychosis.
I can't even describe it.
I would just, I was with you.
Did you see Potman trying to explain it before the game last night?
I don't know if you watched sports, uh, uh, the rivers broadcast, but Potman spent five minutes playing.
Oh, yeah.
I did see that and he was sucking around and rationalizing and covering up.
Who the hell was he talking to last night?
It was it.
It was the stupidest player ever.
Yeah, one of the players on our last night and he was trying to cover up for Spayla and how bad he felt and all the fun.
So the crap and then of course, when Spayla made the nice pass to spring, Brianna broke away in the beginning of the game.
Oh, I feel so good for Spayla.
And of course he, I just conspicuously missed the fact that Spayla screamed out of Vernon so we couldn't stop.
It turned out to be the winning goal in the game by Ricky.
I mean, just, he's just an idiot.
I know.
I love Robbie, but Bobby fail, but sometimes he just doesn't.
Yeah.
I know what he thinks about it.
I know they all talk about him being a great offensive defenseman.
What I like to see us have is a defensive defense.
You know, the defense, the defenseman who can play defense.
I wish I had a dime for every time Spayla smacked some cash on some of his shin guards and went back the other way.
I mean, if that's offensive, then that is offensive.
Yeah, he's up later.
Yeah, it was pretty offensive to me.
Have a great day, sir.
Again, little panther talk going here now.
Feeling tomorrow night for that Edmonton game.
We might pack that joint about 17,000.
Maybe what do you say?
Come on. Let's get out there.
We love those panthers.
Oh, that's right. They lost to an or I'm sorry.
It doesn't make any difference.
They don't even know that they lost the two in a row.
These bandwagon juppers.
They're going to be playing a real girls team to run out.
They're pretty exciting Edmonton.
Aren't they exciting?
I mean, they have no defense and generally they wind up scoring only one or two goals again.
We'll wind up scoring five or six.
I think tomorrow night's and I we're going to kick some very serious.
As in brewery and Whitney and Whitney and brewery and Victor to that.
Don't forget about good old Victor nice go there, Victor.
Come back guy to your Victor Croslaw nice going to be dark.
Kicking some big, big fat ass.
Here's the lady in Miami.
Hello.
Yes, man.
Would you be kind enough to please give me the names of the herbs that you discussed yesterday?
No.
56670560.
What do you look at me for?
I mean, I don't know what she's talking about.
There was some guy called in with some Google.
Google eyes and the.
Boy, you.
So I don't have any idea what it was.
No.
That did.
I have blue lips.
56670560.
See, I am a bastard.
Make no mistake about that.
But that's what I'm sorry, man.
But really, and all honesty, it's a radio show.
Okay.
This isn't a doctor show.
I have no idea what they were.
And I don't want to know the worst thing that could ever happen is that we start going back to that crap.
You're a.
Amen.
That's a hockey dolphin football.

And now the Miami Hurricanes too.

It puts the lotion in the basket.
Wow, your fat ass is really comfortable.
Wow, your fat ass is doing wonders for my back back.
Want to do something useful with your fat ass?
I could sleep on your fat ass all day.
Then why not put it to use?
And you don't mind if my girlfriend sits on your fat ass too, do you?
As one of America's newest app cushions.
Put your fat ass to use for the airlines.
And turn a coat seat into comfort class.
This is great.
By letting people sit on your fat ass, you'll be helping to improve people's days on the bus at the movie theater, even at the park.
Mommy, come close on this fat ass with me.
Put your fat ass to work today.
Receive hourly wages, health benefits, and ho-hoes.
Call now and be proud to be a fat ass.
Wow, the market's taking a big day.
I'll tell you that now is down to 203 points and I'll just ask down to 143.
I would need to call my broker right now and solve everything like crazy or just blow my brains out one or the other.
Okay, so let's get back to much music on that TV.
And you'll thank you and get away from that to depressing stuff.
560, 705, 60, pound 560.
Is the pizza here yet from gone?
No, no, no.
Now I'm starting to get a little bit nervous.
Here's the mobile in Weston.
Hello.
Hi, I love you.
How are you doing?
Pretty good.
I have a question for you.
Why does that big fat bulldog, none, need to live in a million dollars?
560, 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.
Out of timeline is 877, 785, 6345.
He came precariously close to the f***ing keyword there and I had to send him on his way.
Send him packing.
Oh, he's already packing.
He's starting to get a little nervous about this pizza situation here because I got news for you two o'clock.
A big hot shot like me.
Is my going to sit around and wait for it?
Uh-huh.
Oh, I am.
Well, I'm lying.
I mean, this is something exciting.
This doesn't happen every day.
That somebody from a godfather's comes in.
And brings us good stuff.
Probably, it's probably just all just a sham.
Here's a mobile and candle.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
Yes, sir.
Neil, did you happen to hear after the union, the state of the union address yesterday, the right wing?
No, of course not.
I'm not going to watch that bitch.
No, no, no, no.
How would I am talking about on the news what they did to give him a present?
The, uh, Mr. Skade decided to open up the, uh, Paula Johnson again and went to the Supreme Court of Arkansas.
Yeah.
So he can answer charges of obstruction of justice.
And if he is found guilty, he is this large.
These people can't leave him alone.
No, no, that that's why it's so amazing that he's done this well because I mean,
and if you notice during the speech last night, 99% of the time talk about partisan.
Or maybe only one or two times under Republican depleted and stood up.
And I am almost all the time.
It was so, so obvious on the one side, all the Democrats are standing in the plotting and the generals and all these other.
And then, uh, the other people are sitting under seats.
And one of the times when they did stand up, I think what he mentioned to farmers,
here's that asshole Pete Domenici from Mexico.
And he's, you notice he's motioning the guys around, okay, we can stand up now.
It's okay.
Like he's orchestrating it as opposed to what they really believe it or not.
They do happen to see Tom delay a couple of times.
I wouldn't watch him out.
I would puke my dress.
He looks like a fascist.
What do you mean, look like?
Have a great day, sir.
God bless America.
Just relax.
Okay, it's a police state that's not going to change.
You're going to change?
No.
Okay.
Leave that down.
Oh, she's going to watch yourself.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.
It's easy to get a lulled back in and that again.
In fact, what we're going to do is take the last half hour and just have Miguel come in here and make a passionate plea on behalf of.
Here is Miami.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Happy E-Free Day.
And say new.
Thank you for giving us a place where the Schmidt can't get us to hide, you know.
Now no one can say you ain't an original.
I'd like to get a shameless request.
Yes, sir.
Anything you like.
Still haven't found any Pokemon?
What is it?
Still haven't found any Pokemon?
You know?
Oh.
What does that thing call?
I have no idea.
I'll look for it.
Thank you, Amanda.
And a bit too, see.
What does that thing go?
I think it's on one of those, yeah.
Doing a break, I look for it or maybe not.
I'll do my best, pal.
That's all I can do is do my best to do my, uh, do it even with IBS.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.
See, people hear that term irritable bowel syndrome.
And as soon as they hear bowel, they think of that, which that can be and sometimes it is a part of this whole syndrome.
But is that all that it is?
No.
No, it's like kishkis.
It's intestines.
It's like, uh, a little pain over here and a little pain over there like that mombotha.
Yeah, right.
That's what it's all about.
Yeah.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.

Yes, sir.
Great segue.
Listen, I got a word for you.
I looked up the other day in the German dictionary for pile of crap.
Yeah.
Measure Schmidt.
Message mid.
Measure Schmidt.
Okay.
They keep up the e-free stuff.
Okay, you bet.
Let me look.
Still haven't found a portion.
I'm nervous about that because I know it's in here.
I know it's one of these ACN things.
One moment, please.
And I could wait till they break to do it.
But that would be no fun.
Would that be any fun?
No.
Oh, I got it.
There you go.
I got it.
Oh, am I good or what?
Am I good?
I got it.
Woo.
I can't believe sometimes what a phenomenal job I do.
But does that sound self-aggrandizent self-service?
Too f and bad.
Cannot believe it.
You want it?
We got it.
I mean, what's the sense of promising people you're going to do something and then like,
Oh, geez.
And like Gregory pulling the plug.
Of course, he's good at that.
I think it's just called being a liar is what that's called.
Let's see.

hello. How are you today? Okay. Okay. I'm just calling you to tell you the first time
caller. I'm probably one of your young listeners. But I'm calling you to tell you that there's
a lot of young people out there and you're starting to listen to your new. Okay. And I got
one more question. Yeah. You know that IBS, the irritable bowel syndrome. Yeah. I was diagnosed
with that when I was I think I was 15. Yeah. And the doctor told me you know, it's about
the nerves because I thought I had like a tumor or something inside. I mean, it was like
incredible pain. Right. One night that I had and like the next two days, three days,
I went there to tell me not to at the end of the game, a bunch of things. Nothing worked.
There's only two things that helped me. I was something that you gave me. It was called
innu-loafs. And the other thing was smoking a joint. Yeah. I really think I relieved my stomach,
every time worse like a charm. Okay, pal. All right. Light up. By the way, I think that's the kind of
considered most of the parents in town. Most of not all of them left some pin joints at home for
the kid who worked for their kids who are out of school today. That was kind of nice. 5 6 7 0 4.
What's wrong with that? Keep kind of mellowed out for the day. Keep mouth of streets and out of

lotion in the basket. Just a little taste, okay? Here's Volka. Hello. Amiop. Yes, sir. Do you
watch that speech? Last night by Cun? Yes, I did. I watched it. It was the biggest joke I've
ever seen in my life. Why is that? First of all, he promised more things than he could ever
deliver in here. Absolutely. Great speech. Nonetheless, give me one of those things. Why he hasn't
done the previous seven years? Probably because Congress hasn't passed most of the things he's
talked about. And here's another thing he's going to do. Probably because he's going to
dominate it. Congress hasn't passed it. And when the Democrats take control of Congress this
fall, it will pass a lot of it in a nice life. Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap,
and I'm not aware of that. Why would you waste your time watching it? Since you hate Clinton
so much, why would you waste your time? You already know the answers to the questions.
Sir, I have a suggestion for you. Okay? Don't ask. Don't tell.
Here's a mobile in Hollywood. Hello. Hi, Neil. This is Jonathan. How are you? Pretty good, Jonathan.
I'm the driver. I'm the driver you're looking for. I just pulled up here and I got three
pizzas you ordered. Yeah. But there's one little problem. D-fo and Hank, eight, two of them. Okay,
great. Five, six, seven, oh, five, six, eight. And that's pretty good. D-fos in Vegas. You
must have a long distance tongue. Yeah. Long distance tongue. Nice going B-fo.
So sir, before you call again, just to think twice. Okay? And probably I don't do it.
Here's a mobile in Vanita Springs. Hello?
Neil, hey, I got a quick warning for you. The Godfather's over in Fort Myers. Yeah. I stopped by there.
I had a taco pizza. Yeah. Probably one of the worst ones I've ever had. Really? Yeah, and I worked
to Godfather for like seven or eight years. I've had no one. He used to be great. I think when
Hobdie left, that's when it started going down. So what they had down here was they only had the
Golden Cross. They didn't have the original cross. Right. And if you don't make the Golden Cross
just write and let it rise, it tastes like shrimp. They don't know how to let it rise. Man. And
actually threw away half of it. Uh-uh. But yeah, I got to quick. I'll show you what it's going to be.
Don't let your off. It'll be this as well. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Actually, and you know, if they don't
keep the toppings off to the side, it's taking such a long time. It's going to be a pretty
song you probably know. Yeah. Sitting on the bench in Delray. Okay. Thank you. You got it, man.
So there's a little request in Fort Myers while we're sitting here nervously pacing up and down,
looking out the window. Waiting for the pie that has shown up there. Waiting for a little bit of
cross. Yeah. Back your cross.
Waiting for the only person to take me away.

Hi, this is Brad Hettiken, and you're listening to self-lord
as hockey authority Neil Rodgers.
Yes.
He ain't for me than a thing.
He ain't for me than a thing.
No, he ain't for me than a thing.
Lord, push you back when he was a thing.
Oh, oh, oh, it wasn't a thing to say.
He was the white house, he'd be all good.
I just can't catch him, he's fine.
So he can't fit me, he feels like he's in the back house.
He's the white house, that's the way it's all.
He's the white house, he's the white house.
Lord, push you back when he was a thing.
All right, 155 at 5.60 WQAM.
Oh!
Is there here, are we gonna eat him yet?
No, I'll wait till 2 o'clock, that would be unfair.
And the best part of it is that our buddy, what is his name, the sky, or do you tell us his name?
He didn't say, but I think it's JR.
JR?
Because the guy on the phone line when I spoke to him.
Like I said, our good amigo JR here, he brought in with rubber gloves no less.
And he put on the lettuce and the other cheese that goes on top and the tomato isn't stuff.
And so it'll be perfect in the microwave because it'll melt all of that stuff,
out of the other which is the whole concept of Godfather's anyway.
And left me a little menu here.
And he brought you, what is the other stuff there?
Like garlic, garlic stuff with pepperoni and cheese inside.
Like little calzones but more like garlic stuff.
Hats Express, you got your Hats gas station right there by 5.95 in D.E. Road Expression
and attached to right on the ass end of it is a Godfather's baby.
So you'll have to tune in Monday and find out if we're still alive and if it was really good.
And if it messed up with my IVS too much which I've done.
Oh Neil, you shouldn't do that.
Too bad.
But out.
Here's Miami. Hello.
Hello Neil.
Yes sir.
Is anybody updated?
You know I heard you're talking before about the woman who won the 35 million out of Vegas.
Yeah, about the cocktail waitress who's not as old and not as old as we thought.
Yeah.
Because I heard you in the car and then I left here.
Yeah, I had a few calls about that.
Yeah.
Okay, I just want to update you on that.
And also think about Kelsey grandma with the...
I have a great weekend.
You too.
Thanks.
Well, they're way ahead of him but his intentions are good.
He was okay, right?
Oh, I'm sorry.
We've almost made it through four and I didn't have to dump a couple of calls because some people out there can't keep it in their pants.
They can't control themselves.
We wanted to split the f***ing word in their honest today and start hawking a trinic about rehashing the obvious.
Do we want to do that?
No.
Absolutely positively.
No.
We won't do it.
But this is this has been I feel spectacular.
Of course, once I start eating this pizza, you know, I might have a little or relapse.
Not which has got nothing to do with them, but it just I'm not supposed to eat and stuff like this.
But I'll make an exception because on my low fiber high, on my low fat high fiber diet, like I told you, this is the beginning of my second week.
And you get to cheat two meals a week, which I did one last night last week.
I got that eaties ice cream, which I'll never do again.
It's very good.
But when you think eaties would discover that people don't always buy a half a gallon of ice cream, you know.
Because then you start eating a lot more than you want and then you finally put a, what I do is I take a busink and I run hot water on it and then throw it in the, in the big trash can in the garage.
Because otherwise I'll eat all of it.
I mean, I love you folks at eaties.
You're very nice.
Your ice cream a lot of it is very good, but not all of us want a half a gallon every time we go out and cheat a little bit on this thing.
Here's for myers.
Hello.
That was excellent.
Oh, that was the beesleaves on the phone.
Thanks a lot.
Not sure which one.
Which one of they let out this week.
Here's a lady in sunrise.
Hello.

Okay.
