Speak QAF to talk to Neil.
Call 567, call 560.
Call 3 in date and ground.
Call 560 on yourself.
The opinions of Neil, his guests and colors,
you not necessarily represent those of the Beasley blood
category.
It's staff, advertises your agency.
Now, here's Neil Rogers on 560 QAM.
Rapples, blow, and soda, the boo.
Oh!
There's no need to fear.
The undervotes are here.
But not really.
Eh, that's a face all the way from Poppy County and hating,
the other hearing!
Thumb your wake!
Bell wear needs now!
Yeah!
What about Si五,
but thepowdertowelun,
And it's a thousand there to follow you to go.
On to go.
Oh, that's all.
10-1 at 5-60 WQM, happy Monday to you.
The beat goes on.
It just goes on and on and on.
Is there any end in sight?
No.
And if you thought that the dead souls is one of my favorites.
I loved that guy.
Sanders solves up in the gun county.
If you thought he was going to roll this morning, guess what?
This afternoon.
Nothing before noon for sure.
And sometimes this afternoon he'd be going to say something.
Anybody out there watching this crap this weekend?
Oh, God.
Unless it was ball games, unless you're watching
maybe the Dolphin's Kick Series A7 Buffal yesterday,
or the Leafs Pound of Rangers 8-2-3-0,
or the Panthers lose against 30, whatever it was.
That's basically all that was on.
All after, all after, all after.
My one word to sum it all up.
Terminal.
I mean, so freaking ponderous.
And wouldn't you think, I mean, I know it was all on short notice.
Wouldn't you think that both sides could have come up with better witnesses?
God, just pathetic.
And to figure out better witnesses, the one good witness that I thought
did a pretty good job was George Burton from Palm Beach County.
And the audience was right, we were wrong.
Although it wasn't so much that I was wrong, it was that
you keep hearing the media make mistakes, and then you start repeating it.
He's not a Republican, he's a registered Democrat.
George Burton from Palm Beach.
So guess what?
You stand corrected here.
But that's the way it goes, because the media can't get their ass together.
So the world is going to come at least past noon, okay?
At least the one from Malion County.
You know, for the first time in ages this weekend, as a matter of fact,
it was yesterday, the Miami hero was imitating a real newspaper.
Yeah.
The last time we did it, how many months ago was it, and maybe it was over a year ago?
I mean, the biggest pose on the airport, and all the corruption at the airport.
Remember that?
Yeah.
And everybody said, wow, this is really great.
And then of course, they went back and we've hooded back to being their pandering horse-crab self.
And then yesterday they had a big expose on the, and of course nobody's going to care about it,
because it often is a, you know, a 10 and a 3 and a kick to ass again,
and it probably wouldn't be insupporable.
But in any way, injured trust, playing hoards is part of the game in the NFL,
but many dolphins say the team has gone over the liner every year,
as we hold with holding medical information and pushing injured players to return to you soon.
Great expose.
Including Jimmy.
Anybody remember Jimmy?
Jimmy Johnson?
Oh, oh, dead meat, old news, old hack.
But anyway, that was a great show.
And on the front page of yesterday's Harold, which may be even a little bit more important than the dolphin,
they did their own study on an an analization of the election results from across the state of Florida.
And what their conclusion was, in a flawless vote,
grow a woodwind by 23,000 votes.
That is assuming that all 185,000 ballots that were discarded,
meaning all the under votes and the over votes,
if they would all been counted, grow at a 1 by 23%.
And even if 90% of those still were discarded,
he still wins the state by 14, 14, 43 votes.
And they also had a, you know, this was in the Suncun.
I don't want to get it helped so much, credit.
Suncun, I had a nice expose.
They are Mayor Penga Picania.
Now he's basically shot himself in the foot.
I saw in their Alex.
Because like, while Martinez, I got to say one thing for him.
Beside the fact that he does a good job of beating up little kids in higher area,
he's the one thing about his gotta stop on it.
And he's absolutely right.
With Alex Penga Picania, everything that he does is strictly about Alex.
That's all he cares about is himself.
And he showed once again his enormous political cowardice
because he doesn't want a well-femmed, you know who.
You know who he doesn't want a well-femmed?
Then Robert Leedy, a long time observer of local politics,
says, I don't know what it is that it's worth giving up your position in the national leadership
to kidnap the Cuban Americans in Miami-Dade County.
The reality is he's got to go somewhere from here.
He's term limited.
And one of my favorite quotes he was on Michael Puntini yesterday,
they had a panel including that big fat guy from New Times.
But anyway, the quote was, while Mayor Penaula says,
the Mayor's of the other counties, Palm Beach and Broward didn't take any position.
They weren't out campaigning for the candidate.
Yes, what Mayor Penaula Penaula?
Does Palm Beach County have a mayor?
Does Broward County have a mayor?
No, oh.
Well, don't confuse him with the facts.
Yeah, Seproda was right.
Yeah, that's right.
To the point, Chris Antley's dead.
Once again, I got a hand at the Humper.
Now, maybe you could use it, you probably even know who Chris Antley was.
Jockey.
No.
Great Jockey.
Well, once upon a time.
Jockey?
Almost.
And also had a problem.
Yeah, in fact, what did Chris Antley have in common with?
Oh, yeah.
He had a little bit of a nose problem.
But anyway, you might remember when Hank said,
because he was writing, he wrote that the horse, um,
charismatic.
And it says, he missed a lane, the triple crown of the horse finished during the Belmont Stakes,
pulled up just past the finish line with the broken leg.
Antley jumped off and immediately held the course,
like until veterinarians arrived, et cetera, and so on, and saved the horse's life.
But at any rate, I remember Hank saying that he was in the elevator with Chris Antley
at Gulf Stream, and he didn't, he had that look in his eye that far away looked like,
because he, you know, had been away from racing for a long time with a bad drug problem.
Now, he found dead, somebody beat him over the head.
And of course, he immediately rushed to judgment,
and it'll be that it was drug-related.
Will you say it was probably drug-related?
No.
That's what I would say, even before we know anything else about it.
So Chris Antley is dead, and once again, the Humper,
I think, had a stomach on it in that case, tragic.
That white powder will do it for you, baby.
It'll kill you sooner or later.
Our prayer on Friday, and we would have had a lot more votes except that our website was down for about 12 hours of looking.
But you know that?
Well, at least for maybe 18 hours.
But at any rate, we still got a thousand, eighty-five votes.
The election in Florida was, and we gave it three choices.
As honest as any other state, only 177, 16, little over 15%,
flawed, but only by accidental events, 211, 19.4%, fixed.
696, said, fixed.
Over 64%.
So the Florida election was, I'm in.
I'm in.
Oh, and I got a great product.
You know, I'm a kind of torn whether I should promote that or not,
because if I do, then it won't be in public.
Happened every time.
Remember the old bagel by Stankwright?
Start promoting it on the end and then the big newspapers.
Yeah, book a book.
But you can't find them anywhere.
Well, I got a product for you.
I don't know if our friends at Delight's Careless are not for their really other being.
Of course, people are under the mood to be seen, which is fine with me.
But great product, which I'll talk about in a second.
Here's our poll question for today, as we're sitting awaiting at, what does it say?
Updated new new or awaiting the ruling, because the judge said he's busy, he's busy counting or something.
And no matter which side you run, you got to head into the judge's solves.
Because this guy, he's a panic is what he's, it's great.
Here's our poll question today.
Is it finally time for algorithms to concede?
Yes?
Or no?
Is it finally time for our goal to concede?
Yes, you know, I mean, it's the fourth of fricking December already.
In fact, it's three days away from a month past the election already.
And we still don't have a guy named President-Elect.
They still can't get it fixed right.
One or the other.
Eight minutes after 10 is 560 WQS.
No question, Mr. Soto, no duty should have expressed your information
at the QLM, because I've had certain corporate ed.
And I'll put it stuck in.
This is the year that I'm gonna get smart, yeah.
Well, I was a friend the hands already started.
I was a friend.
I think you're ever known to be an excellent flower
who pushes me to shove the truth in so loud.
Not on your line, it's not a big no-door.
That's what my computer needs more.
I'm gonna lay the app, play and shove my mind.
I'm on your line, where that's what you need to stay ever.
I don't have been here no longer ever.
I can't make a sound and feel the time.
Sometimes I'm your mate.
1015 at 560 WQAM.
The thing in Seminole County, the hearing is on Wednesday.
I know all the suit that the individual's filed in Seminole County
and you get all the absentee ballots thrown out.
You know, the more I think about that, the more ridiculous it is.
Not acceptable.
Now, Georgia's gonna be a look like a blind state.
It's not acceptable.
How about the thousands of people, the thousands of absentee ballots
who voted legitimately in Seminole County?
No, they're not right there if they didn't, indeed.
They threw out all the absentee ballots?
Yes, nobody didn't.
During that mayor election, when they found that the people were voting,
they threw out the...
No, no, no, no, no.
Yeah, when they found out that there was rampant, there was a right.
Because there's no way to sort between, you know,
which ones are legitimate, which ones aren't.
But it's not acceptable.
No, it's not right.
It's not acceptable.
To throw out thousands of...
The fact is that now it's beyond repair.
Because this state number one doesn't know how to hold a rush.
And number two, all of the affiliates,
can you imagine all the billions of words, trillions of words that have been spoken
in these last almost four weeks now, since you were watching?
And I would say maybe 50 words have been spoken,
and all of the networks put together, all of the talking head,
about the fact that this is not their way to vote.
Paper ballots have got to go, baby.
Normal, afloat, and paper ballots.
And during this trial and leon County over the weekend,
every goddamn expert, the guy who invented,
who upgraded the machine, and the guy who invented it,
and they were quoting from,
this is something from the star age.
And if I will make sure that you are clean off your chads
before you put your ballot in the box,
what kind of crap is that?
Clean your chads.
And they're not talking about this.
If nothing else comes out of this rush,
because it's never going to get done right.
They're never going to know who really won this state.
I got a pretty strong opinion about it,
and so to many of you, I'm sure, or most of you,
but the fact is, we'll never know for sure,
it's broken beyond repair.
You know, we got this one asshole over there in Coyote County,
who just happens to be a Bush campaign manager
from Missouri, who comes in,
or he's filing soap to get all to declare
the hand recounts unconstitutional.
This is the same candidate who three years ago signed
a hand recount in Texas Bill in the law,
which the Republican there,
I should have kept that stirring.
You read it every day on the year.
The Republican running for the state legislature
challenged the results of the man in the recount.
He got it, he lost by 2000 votes.
He lost actually by a few more than that after they finished the recount.
There were a whole bunch of different ballots,
and they counted every single one of them.
Every one of them, nobody argued about it,
nobody said, oh, this is ridiculous, dimples, and pimples.
Yeah, and that was okay.
When Republicans want a count of different ballots in Texas,
it's okay.
But if you want to do it in Florida because it isn't expedient
and doesn't fall in line with what they're trying to accomplish,
then it's bad, let's throw it out, and hand recounts are bad.
No more paper ballots, no more voting in the Stone Age,
because if this is really as important as they tell us.
If this is all that important,
this is the which one of these guys is going to flush all our money down the toilet
the next four years.
Then when you think that it would be important enough to maybe
get it right, no, no, we don't want to do that.
But again, like I said last week,
this is an area of famous for asking questions to try to trick the voters.
If you're for something vote no, if you're against a vote yes.
It doesn't look like a rocket scientist to figure out that when they put something on the ballot like that,
they know that they got a China-Mins chance in hell of getting it passed
and they put it on their right, so they put it on their kaka,
assuming that most people will understand it,
and more often than not to get their crap through that way.
But it's supposed to be so goddamn important.
No more paper ballots, that's what everybody ought to be screaming about,
and no more crappy candidates.
I didn't get too much response last week when I talked about the fact
that the Democratic Party is really let us down badly,
and of course the Republican Party has been taken over by the wingnuts.
We've got to have a meaningful, not a Ralph Nader,
a meaningful third party in this country.
We've got to have a real choice.
This was the most prophetic choice in the history of the human race.
Four of the worst possible candidates.
You could have just opened up a goddamn firm book,
and picked four names at random and did a better job than these four.
Here's what's palm beach, shall we?
I know, yes sir.
What she can do in seminal is a fashion of remedy quote unquote.
She can say the Democrats didn't get to fix a 2000 ballots,
so I'm going to subtract 2000 from the Republicans.
She's allowed to do that.
But anyway, that's not what I call about.
No, that's not going to happen.
Well, it's been done before.
They can apportion votes, so-called.
But again, that's guess working.
Well, yeah, but how can you have one side come in and-
So I understand that.
I understand it, but there's no legitimate way to-
There's no legitimate way to fix it without throwing out legitimate votes
by people who we did vote one way.
Well, but she could say, well, I'm going to allow those Democratic ballots in, though.
She could do that.
Yeah.
But anyway, you know, it was listening Friday,
and you know, Scalia said he was deeply disturbed by the, you know,
Florida Court's action, but you know, he apparently wasn't disturbed by the fact that a county could have one day to count, you know,
600,000 votes, you know, that didn't seem to bother him at all.
And, you know, what the Florida Court said was, you know, the right to vote is part of the Florida Constitution.
And the law that can flicks with that is, you know, by definition, unconstitution.
You have any idea how many times they could have counted all of the votes.
They could have counted the states votes 15 times during all of the time that they're having news hearings and all of the testimony and all of this gruby is going on.
And then we would know, at least we have some idea of what number they were going to come up with.
Right, but you know, who kept fighting, you know, the Bush might.
Well, of course, because they're afraid to fight out. They don't want to know.
Well, just remember that, you know, this Supreme Court, this is a lot of the same people that said a state to tell you what you couldn't, couldn't do in your bedroom, you know.
If you stuck it here, that's against the law.
I don't know. I don't know if that on that hopeful, but we'll see.
Okay. Hang on tight, pal. I'd like to ask. 5.670560, 0.560 on the AT&T, who runs and whatever it's one.
We're waiting to see if we get any calls today, which you don't look like it.
I discovered in just by accident, in public yesterday, or over the weekend. I guess we'll be yesterday.
And the peer-leiners ever called you. They really hear from him. No.
Because I didn't take to talk about this because I don't know if our friends have derived securities products or not.
If they don't, they ought to be carrying them.
Carb solutions.
And I took a look at that. They've got the bars, you know, like the power bars.
And they're like, have three carbs. I think one carb for bars, I'm like that, one to three.
And they have the shake mix, three different flavors.
And they also have like little bottles of stuff.
Hi protein drinks. With only three carbs to the entire bottle.
And I looked at any ingredients and there's have any that's herb at all or malt at all.
Or any other stuff that makes you happy, brings out no.
None at all. None at all. They had to have none at all. None of the above.
And so I bought some of the shake mix and I bought some of this by protein weight, took it home.
And this stuff is great. It is sensational.
Carb solutions and I look on a bottle and come to find out that they're manufactured or at least distributed by Richard's and Labs in Boka.
How do you like that?
So maybe I can find a place, maybe I got a trophy number on here, maybe it was going to buy like a whole bunch of it.
And I'm not looking for free, unless of course with Nitor for free.
But I'm, well, it's all about free. What's wrong with that?
Because I'm going on the liquid diet right now.
Because I lost 95 pounds in the proteins burning fast 25 years ago.
And I've just got to be the only way. You can patch you up with all this other stuff.
You're only bad, everything rules any weight. And you're going to have all this IBS and Gurd and all this other crap.
And clean out my symptoms is by going on some kind of a liquid thing for the most part.
Because with me, I don't know about you but the more I eat the more I want to eat.
That's not just carbohydrates. I could have a whole bunch of burglars or steak or something like that.
And it makes me hungry that I wasn't the first place.
Carb solutions, fantastic.
And now that I mentioned it on the year I'll go to publicslider on this afternoon and it'll all be gone.
You can bet your bottom dollar on that.
Here's Miami. Hello.
No. Yes sir.
I look like you're thinking about foreign leucin and bumper stickers.
Some of the what?
A foreign leucin and bumper stickers.
I don't know. Look inside your vector.
Yes.
I think you might find a few.
560.560 on the 18T in Verizon wireless line.
Here's a mobile and four-lotter deal. Hello.
Hey, Neil. How are you?
Okay.
That's good to hear.
I don't know about everybody else but I do much as I've used three times a day.
But there's some reason I keep thinking to myself now that I didn't clean out my ballot.
We're here when I was putting it in the envelope.
So I don't even know if I got the right voting now or anything like that.
Not if you're mentioning it.
But over the weekend, listening to that trial,
I thought the most interesting part to me was having that expert on about the ballots
and how we said it should be changed at this time.
Now it's funny the way the judge was asking about the whole deal.
And he said, you know, they're talking about the yellow ballot as opposed to the real ballot,
which is harder, which is softer and stuff like that, and making the dimples on it.
I just thought that was very interesting.
It's all a bunch of crap is what it is.
It is.
This is not the way to conduct an election.
With a paper ballot.
It's like something out of this.
Even the Flintstones would laugh at it.
Very true.
You know, the one thing is, is that they're talking about how it was processed and it's a dull way of cutting this.
And to me, that was terminal.
But when it came to the part of saying which ballot is harder and stuff like that,
that's what was interesting to me because you think about it.
And probably it's county, some people aren't strong enough to even put their, you know, a pen through paper.
Yeah.
So let them vote and get the right vote.
And you know, if that's, there's that feeble and they ought to go in a handicap line,
and they ought to bring somebody along with them to push it to there.
Yeah, it's helpful.
Okay.
And you're going to say, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm getting, I'm losing my patience with people who keep saying,
well, you know, it's like the thing with these black people that voted.
I don't want to start making generalizations about the fact that I buy people are generally, pretty uneducated.
But how much of the geniuses is it take to go and cast a vote?
God almighty, if you're not, if you're not intelligent enough to make a vote,
then probably ought to stay home.
That sounds like a real good idea to me.
Not because we do, because this is the country of the dumb.
If you have those touch screens, hey, here's a picture.
I mean, we'll just put the names on it.
We'll put a picture on here.
Here's George W.
With that stupid, smart, artist post.
And here's that wooden looking guy with too much pancake makeup.
That must be gourd.
And you put your finger on it.
And the guy named two touch screens.
We've had the technology to do it for years.
And we're still fighting a rower of paper ballots with these idiots that come in.
Wow, the Chad's have to be completely dislodged.
And they all fall into the thing and they build up this.
And people accept it because it's on television.
They accept that this is a sensible way to have an election.
I guess we're out of business today, huh?
It's Monday.
We're back to the usual again.
5607-0560, how in 560 on the ATMP and for Ryan's and Marvellous Line?
Lady and Miami, hello.
Hi, how are you?
Okay.
Good patient, I ask you, please.
I'm with the process, anyways.
I hear you so.
What does that mean?
Well, it's going to go through and whatever happens, we can't help.
But I'm not bad.
He will ever be, there shall ever be my presence and that will never happen.
But I guess if we can't help it, we can't help it.
My biggest thing is that we can't, we still can see that the media may go into such a villain.
And we're also allowing, along with it.
And I think the man has been different in here.
The fact is he was a crappy candidate.
Why don't you admit he was a very talented person?
How is the fact he's a pretty good candidate?
How is it?
The fact that when he was running against the moron, he was not Clinton.
Because he was, he has a personality like a dead man.
Right.
Because we were the fact that he's got the credibility of Jesse James.
Because of the fact that he's unable to relate to the people.
He's non-human.
He is non-human.
Or he's just ingenious.
But I think that the fact he candidates, and he picked an even worse running mate.
So he wants to go back to 40 election again and start all over.
Am I going to do that?
No.
No, I'm not going to do that.
I voted for him, and like I said, I voted against Bush.
The Democrats couldn't have picked a worse candidate if they were to try.
If they were to start it before the election, said, OK, we don't want to win this time.
Let's pick somebody who can lose.
They couldn't have done a better job.
That's what a weak candidate he was.
The proof is in the pudding.
Week.
My little dog has got more personality in one paw than this man's got as a entire body.
Oh, he just gets a creep thinking about him.
And he's great compared to Lieberman.
So what does that tell you?
And you wonder why they couldn't win.
Finally, I have 400 open lines here this morning.
Are we on the airs?
Oh, I didn't think so.
Five, it'll be really good when we get the transmitter off.
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pop five, 60 on the AT&T line.
1027, the QA.
Holy child, ends coming.
Okay.
Okay.

To
ho
He's got the girl people saying well every vote's got to be counted.
What's the problem? What are you afraid of? And then to chew out all those votes of which thousands were in legitimate.
The only rational way to solve the thing would be to declare a Florida's election in valid.
To vote out. And then of course where would win if they didn't go beyond that, if the legislature didn't immediately screw in to need a bunch of electors.
You chew out what out and then go has got the majority of the remaining electors vote and then he wins the election. That's not going to happen.
But anybody who thinks that we had a valid legitimate real honest to got election in Florida is on drugs is on acid.
Like that Pat Cadela on acid. Good time.
What am I getting excited about? What the hell's the point? 5.6705.60.560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
Here's my me do you, Cholo? No, yes sir.
Trying to make a leave fan visiting it from Canada. All right. You got two things in you know.
You got a system that teams can do. Let me just say this before we talk about the system.
We don't need no Eric Lindross and mommy and daddy Lindross on a team.
19 girls and three games. This team is a scoring machine. We don't need him to come up there and screw up our chemistry.
They don't even go get another concussion and that will be out two games.
Exactly. And screw up the whole franchise. He's not worth it.
You know they were looking at signing on a consecutive one year contract. You know that I hope it doesn't have that.
They'll let Don Shirley suck them into that with no way.
They seem to be getting on track and they don't need them to have them along.
Awesome. Anyways, deal. Election. Two things I've got to say. One is your system seems to be working.
This is a close election and you're going to have these issues of contesting values, contesting voting,
what should count, what shouldn't count. You have to let it play itself out.
And you know you have to keep it in this country. Don't even vote.
What right today? You have to complain about the system when it's not working.
The public loves complaining. That's one of our big hobbies.
Well, I think it's complaining.
And it's an intermediate circuit. Look at it.
On the other hand, you got a big problem in the system. We just have an election in Canada a week or two ago.
I can't believe that in this country they allow the results to be broadcast in certain areas before the polls have closed.
Yeah, because they can't say because the media rules are rooted in this country.
Yeah, we have a law in Canada. You can't broadcast results in an area where the polls are still open.
And in Florida, they were broadcasted. They were given projections before the polls have closed in Western Florida.
Unbelievable. Unbelievable. You know what they should do? They should everyone should vote one day.
They should not tell the votes up. They should go on.
You know, the polls should close across the country. The next day, it'll clock in the evening prime time.
The media can have their show. They can start counting the votes.
And it won't prejudice anybody.
I think we ought to bring Peter Manvig down from the CDC and let him get a result.
Everybody will follow sleepy for it's all over.
Well, you know what, half your anger in this country is in a sense.
I know.
You know, I just couldn't believe the fact that you know, you still allow results to be...
You see, if we were computerized, you wouldn't have that problem.
Because the minute that the polls closed, they press a button, there's a result on a computer, and then they get into the media and they put them on and that's official.
Those are the real result.
You know, one of the most hand job business.
What's the hurry? You guys, the brothers of the start serving until two months later.
You know, you don't rush the count for computerized.
Yeah, but you understand the network's manage.
So we got to be number one. We got to be first.
You can put a simple X on a ballot. People can count them quickly.
You don't need computers these days. You know, it's simple can work.
But we don't have all those educated white people down here, what you got up there.
Well, you know what, you've got people who are certainly quite confident of making a process work.
You know, in England, they don't even have counts.
You know, they only brought out a final count. They don't give you progressive counts.
Yeah, I do hear in Canada.
I hear the Queen Councilman, England.
Well, you know, on a more clean other company.
I don't want to say which Queen.
The Queen Mother.
Some of them have a few years' full.
Okay, pal, go leave school.
Take it easy, and I'll say up the back.
Especially tonight.
Well, at least we'll probably tank it against the panthers tonight.
And I want to give you a hockey talk, but since this, Lee Fane just called,
you notice what I've always told you?
Propaganda from the organization.
Both lose papers this morning.
Both of our make-believe reporters on the hockey beat David J. Neil of the Hill,
Michael Wilson of Sunfellow, just coincidentally tonight, today are writing the robbing
you to our propaganda from the organization.
Oh, and the fans don't understand.
He's, yeah, we understand he's getting over $2 million a year,
and he's got three girls and generally speaking, he thinks the joint out.
And for the coach of this team to come on after the game the other night.
And make the comment that he's the most valuable player on this team this year.
How about breweries got 15 freaking girls?
Has it been paid over $2 million to be on a checking line?
How do you kiddin' Terry?
Is he kiddin' anybody?
No.
I don't think so.
He ain't kiddin' me.
There every year they try to take some.
Of course, they haven't tried to pedal into the market for years now,
since the beginning of the organization.
Oh, this is gonna be the breakthrough year.
And then they stop with that line.
Now he's got real players.
He's gonna be on the checking line for $2 million a year.
You're not fooling anybody,
whether it's course wells or Peter, excuse me, I stuck the joint out and say Lewis and O'Rail,
a lot we need them are the organization they even fool in these fans with their five wins.
God, am I getting worked up for it?
Maybe it's just a card solution stuff, huh?
Did we get any yet free?
Did we hear from Peter Leonard yet?
Did we hear from our friends at Delight?
Did we know anything about this stuff?
God, this place is just...
You know what this place is?
It's Greg Wink all over the place.
That's what it is.
You can smell it.
Ooh.
We just say that here in the business our match made in Purgatory.
Oh, yeah, perfect match.
The Neil Rogers show.
Sports radio.
Five-sixties.
You, hey.
Only in the Banana Republic, baby.
Only in Miami.
Hey, little Pufferin, what's the feel?
Making life the right thing, I only think feel.
A little problem, a problem, or a top of the feel.
And Tarot Manzy, baby, when the election's going to be going down.
Oh, where she was?
Jack was there, whoa.
That was nothing.
She can't fit.
She can't fit in the Republican.
Artistic.
And she's it.
Jack's capo, red carpet.
The secretary of the village.
Oh, that's not fair.
That was not fair.
I think it's faster than Earth, but they get.
A little thing, he may be going to get you their thighs.
Knobble with a thousand or a day to free thighs.
A trumpet, and sound you got to play.
Little Lacket going down.
Oh, here it goes.
Jack was there, whoa.
There's nothing you can't fit.
They're all Republican.
Artistic fans.
She's our bitch.
Jack's hot, wearing a towel with the secretary of the village.
You should've.
So, yeah.
Jack's moving.
Yeah, Josie Landy, who I said really crappy, a soft fold inside a column.
Wife, but she's been a real busy beaver this weekend.
Cancer Harris.
She was up there in Palm Beach, hot nodding with the movie stars and celebrities.
When she was introduced at the Debrae Tennis Center, the most they Palm Beach God gave her the Bronx cheer as in like that.
Move the cramp out of her.
And then she was at some big affair at the book of reserve.
Did I say a fair, 30 nights?
Uh-huh.
It's just what about the fact that national mags and tabs have been trying to verify rumors that she and J.R. are more than bugs.
Didn't we tell you?
Didn't we get that spiraled put here weeks and weeks ago?
She said, I'm not going to even dignify that with a response.
What she said.
And she said, it's about this big.
Five say, I'll per question today is, is this finally time for Al Gore to concede?
Now I will tell you right now, I voted no on our poll today, but I'm getting really worn out from all of this.
You know?
No.
Now, well I am.
I am.
This is all, uh, it's happening.
It's a, a thing.
But it, but it's not even fun.
I mean, all J was a happening, even though it was in perioding because he was the other as hell.
And we know the starches on the adjure were going to get them off.
But, but it was in a way it was kind of fun.
This isn't fun.
No, it's not.
It's not fun.
And I'm not even at least bit of nauseating.
And of course you didn't watch the crap over the weekend.
I unfortunately watched hours of it.
Well, I wish I had those hours back.
No, I'm ready for more.
Jesus God, you talk about porn with except for the judge, the judge's grade.
And yesterday they had that statistician on there and the Democrat, I can't think of his name, but when it looks just like, uh, he, he doesn't really look like Bob Eisenberg.
He looks like noodles from the adult noodles for a month upon the time in America.
Remember him?
Will he orange here?
But in any way he was getting psychotic.
In fact, he was pretty psychotic all over the weekend.
He was pretty good.
And he kept trying to ask the so-called Bush statistician expert about if he had done an indirect study, specific study on the Houghton-Bade County.
And he kept trying to ask the question and they kept objecting.
First, it would be the Bush lawyers would object and then Captain Harris Law would ask all the object, so clean your clock.
And then finally the judge got his ass votes.
So it's an okay hold on hold on and he turned to the statistics witness and he said, okay, I'm going to ask you a question.
Did you bring in that statistical study at the Bolton-Bade County and he said, no, okay, thank you.
Next question.
Yeah, those judges are known on that's why they got done last night.
Finally, 30 to 11 o'clock at night.
Thanks to the goddamn judge.
Here's Fort Myers, hello.
Hey Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I just got your tea chain in here.
All right.
Yeah, look at that go on.
Yeah, about this.
I wonder if you can answer the question that you've done a lesson that can about this seminal county bit.
Yeah.
The absentee ballots that were the applications that were sent out, they were refilled by, built out by a Republican operative.
Right.
In the office.
In the...
In the background.
In the Democrats, were they disallow from doing that or just not told that they could do that?
Do you know what situation is on that?
There were some Democratic applications that were thrown out.
Right.
Now, is that like the 14th Amendment that's equal protection at all?
Of course, it's not.
So, my question is, I don't know if anybody else in the ballot has never used one, but wouldn't it be...
No, none the absentee ballots are the greatest weight of facial election. You ought to learn more about them.
Or, isn't it possible to match up, rather than throwing out all of those? Is it possible to match up the applications?
Well, well, that's what they're trying to do. That's why they were requesting, if you saw the initial hearing they had with that Black Lady judge up and we on county, right?
They were asking for the computerized list of the names so they could max them up with the applications to find out how many thousands of them were really bogus and how many really right amats real people.
Well, I wonder if the person who filled out those forms could they pull those forms out and match them with the absentee voter ballot?
Isn't that an absentee sign also?
Doesn't that have to be a name and a prodigy absentee ballot? And you just need to set a ballot in.
Without a name?
No, not in the actual ballot itself.
But it doesn't have to come into the non-beloved.
Yeah.
They don't say that.
They don't say the envelope?
Yeah, just like when you vote in the arena regular person, they take that little gray out.
That's what the gold people are saying too.
Just what he said.
Oh, Schmidt.
And that's a good thing because that's for Bush, that's him.
He's going to have all those people killed if you knew how they voted.
They're not going to just get the vote.
They're going to get the vote.
I'm just going to be right on Amtrak.
I'm the trained to camp.
What is with the space to guardians today?
75,000.
I don't give a crap of its Monday.
Is that an excuse?
Always has been.
You bastard, Jatte.
You goddamn miserable vote count.
Wonderful folks.
Now they suck this place.
No wonder we're going through all of this in Florida.
With Alien and with the male ping at the canyons with all these goddamn crooks and a public down here all they give.
I don't even know what they're going to care about.
Nothing.
Nothing.
5.6.7.05.60.
If the world is laughing at Florida as usual, they will laugh at us doing Alien.
They're always laughing at us because this is a goddamn joke this state.
And don't come to that son of an aunt of a wolf.
You're so critical.
I already lived someplace else.
Okay, but I'm here because I need the money.
Believe me.
And because the weather rain too bad this time here.
It's pretty nice this matter.
But I don't know if it's a matter of fact.
But I don't know if it's a matter of fact.

I was born here in the States
where my cousin from Venezuela
and he was down there in the last leg.
Where's Jimmy Carter?
Jimmy Carter.
Jimmy Carter.
This is probably an entry
for the rest of his family.
And he was down in Venezuela talking about how important the vote is
and all these other crap and what have you and what have you
and what have you and what have you now.
In entry, like I said,
5.67, 05.60, 05.60.
Let's get the BBC and see it in back in here again.
I can see a lot today because we're going to get those really good calls
ago.
Can't you hear it?
You can smell it.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Hi, you know how are you?
OK.
Well, something else.
I think I'm on the verge of declaring a more authoritarian one.
And he's disgusted this whole election crap
and getting back to doing the neo-Rodges show again.
Because I'm just spinning my wheels here.
These people are got nothing to say about it.
Even though I just did this phone call,
I voted Republican.
But after seeing how this crap went down,
how they stole the collection.
Even I, I mean, I'm so there.
I voted for that guy.
What was the big deal?
I want all these Republicans who was in the...
What is the big deal of having a recap of the entire state,
you know, to know who is the real person and not just somebody who,
you know, stole the election and paid people off.
That's ridiculous.
That's the problem.
You know, when you steal, you know, why not have a recap?
That's the problem.
It's the problem.
It's the problem.
It's the problem.
I said I'm Republican, but I do not stand behind the vote.
Didn't you just tell me that you voted for him?
I did.
Yeah, I voted for him, but after I saw how he ran afterwards,
I was never voted for this man again, you know,
this is just ridiculous.
You're one of the 537, I don't know if you're asking,
but I don't want to make you feel too bad,
but it sounds to me like you're one of those 537.
But you know, what is so wins?
I'd say more power to him at this point.
You can't take your vote back.
You're part of the problem.
You're one of those 537, pal.
Sam it.
How do you like that?
And he's belly-wicked about the fact that he wishes he wouldn't have done it.
Wow, there you go.
There you go.
Just like those native people.
Now, I see there's quite an article in the Hill
that they made the op-ed page by Brian,
no, not that one.
That's pretty interesting, too.
About the deadline for plenty of lectures is not December 12th.
It's really January 6th.
But anyway, it's the other article by Dan Johnson,
who is the political reform coordinator for the Ralph Native President campaign.
And you talk about Hutzpah.
If there's nothing that was more infuriating while I was campaigning for Ralph Native,
then getting a thumbs up from a Bush supporter.
Keep on working for your dreams once a cynical message
because you're shooting yourself in the foot.
They were right because of our stupid voting system.
So how do you like that, Dan Johnson,
why in Berger?
There's another part of the problem right there,
another chick or a winter word pile.
Who wasted his vote on that silly old person
but he got the infant vote around his neck.
God, is there something now that all these people
who are part of the problem, now they're coming out and saying,
oh gee, I feel really bad now.
Should have found about that about three and an almost four weeks ago.
1056 at 560 WQN.
430-560 WIFI,
and we put on the data of BQN,
who has group station MWQAM.com with a word.
Come on down, all the way down, I might go.
I don't know, all new Providence.
Kid Jigs Pity on a poor, severely disfigured man
and performs oral sex on him until his head javes in.
So wait, really good at this.
Then she must perform delicate brain surgery
during a power failure at the local venues
of an aunt who's speaking again to thank her for the humor.
It's all on Providence.
Must you tune in, hot in DC.
I'll be there for the Humphrey.
Hey, stupid.
It's 11 o'clock at 560 WQN.
I'm speaking of that, the Humphrey will be along.
Hey, Grover, get you as a two.
Groups, Shombie in the studio from 67.
Panthers at Toronto to play the Maple Leaf tonight.
On a 3DM at 7, Game Time at 730 from the Air Canada Center,
and in the meantime, simultaneous to that, 645-930.
We got Hurricane Basketball against North Carolina
on Waxing 790, and then Candace and E2 set the Patriots in Pogras
after the Hockey game on, I can't follow all of us,
and the K after all that, run good night.
We got spurs up the ass baby.
Back to him.
You got it.
Here's a call from Tampa.
Hello.
Yeah, and yesterday morning in the case,
so that there was thunderstorms,
an open court, the Bush statistical guy,
on cross-examination admitted,
that if the 9000 uncounted date ballots were counted,
or would get a net gain of 600.
Did you say that?
Yes, he did.
And it was said that,
Judge Charles tried to stop it.
They were all objecting and jumping up and down,
but it came out at least three times out of his mouth
that it would result in a net gain.
I'm not so sure I believe that.
Well, because they didn't count the heavily,
they're like the little Havana precinct.
They weren't counting any of those.
Well, this was the 9000 uncounted.
Oh, that was the 9000 under votes.
Right.
They never have been counted.
They got the statistical guy to admit,
and these guys are supposed to know what they're talking about,
that there would be a net gain of 600 votes for more.
Now you can see why this was stopped,
because there's the 600 votes.
Forget about everything else.
Well, how about the 200-person bomb each time
that happened here is been the chef?
So those in you got 18.
Right.
And about the 52-man star cadet,
that was like over 900 beneath.
There you go.
And back to the seminal thing,
the guy from Fort Myers,
the Democrats were never contacted.
Those absentee applications that were not properly filled
out sat in a pile on the side,
and for weeks,
while the doors, this is in the St. Petersburg Times today,
while the doors,
the Seminal County Supervisor of Election Office,
were locked out weekend,
a handful of staffers and Republican operatives,
desperately, collected thousands of Republican absentee ballots
that were innocent, voter ID numbers.
They were actually in there for at least five days longer
than previously acknowledged.
This is from the opposition.
Right.
And he said that he had two guys working in the back room
through the Republicans,
and one of them,
she didn't even know who he was.
Well, he didn't even know who the hell he was.
She knew what he was doing, though.
Yeah.
Anyway, 6600 in-date,
the 215-18 bomb each,
the 52-and-ass.
So this is who won the race.
I say, I say, call the whole thing off.
Well, let's just put the right guy in there.
Okay.
So yeah.
Five, six, seven,
oh, five, 60,
pound, five, 60 on EAT and T,
and Verizon wireless lines.
147 votes so far as it's finally time for our voter concede.
99 say no, 67.2% of this audience.
Do we have a Windows audience?
No.
No.
49 say yes, 32.9%.
Here's a mobile and four-letter deal, hello.
I knew.
Yes, sir.
I'll write it down.
Okay.
A couple of points I'd like to make for you.
First of all, back in 1996,
an election on West Coast at a town called Duplorrician,
Pasco County.
Yeah.
There was a public candidate who lost the election to a Democrat.
Six weeks after the election,
had a recount and recount.
Guess what happened?
Overturn.
That's right.
Right.
So why do Republicans feel great?
Why do they feel great?
Why do they feel great?
Why do they feel great?
Because they know they lost.
It's not.
I know.
Which deal I agree with you 100%.
100%.
They lost.
We know they lost.
You know they lost.
And you know what?
George Bush knows he lost.
But there's never going to be anywhere to prove it.
Oh, there'll be a way.
But when I was, how's that going to happen?
A way.
A way to prove information.
Information.
Well, yeah, but that's going to be long afterward.
That's going to come down the road.
You're, you're, you're like, how it's going to happen?
How it's going to happen?
How it's going to happen?
How it's going to happen?
How it's going to happen?
How it's going to happen?
How it's going to happen?
How it's going to happen?
How it's going to happen?
How it's going to happen?
How it's going to happen?
How it's going to happen?
We'll actually want to pop in the votes.
But he's not the president.
How's that going to look?
That's going to look real bad.
You think we're calling for a public around the world?
Yeah.
And Jeff.
Okay.
Hey, wait a second.
Come down.
As I was starting to say, if you think they're calling us
a banana republic now, just wait to know what happened.
And the only reason that it's happening,
besides all the hanky-panky, is the fact that the paper ballot,
didn't I read that week's B40 election?
That story from Newsweek about the fact that they love the,
the absentee ballots and the paper ballots,
because that's the best way to fix an election.
It's the tool of choice.
Yeah, the tool of choice.
It don't take no fool to see that tool.
That's what Bubba said.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
We got it noon, perhaps.
At noon, we may have a ruling from Judge Saul's, maybe.
Well, what do you think is across so hard?
You want him to start counting, is that it?
Yeah.
Now we're doing some fun.
Can you imagine this?
I want to see where this goes.
Who's going to be cleaning out those toilets in the bush campaign
up? They start their recalib,
you can smell it from here.
Anything that makes them unhappy or uncomfortable,
the anxious one.
You mean after they took away that powder?
Here's Miami. Hello.
I don't know Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I agree with George.
I want them to, I want them to run brown over there.
I want them to count.
They've no stone unturned.
Yeah.
I don't know how people can that be outraged about this.
Last time I checked, I went to public that I was able to get milk.
I can get gas from my car.
Yeah.
No constitutional crisis.
Right.
My money is still in the bank.
Right.
So why in the hell are we such in a hurry to anoint somebody president?
Yeah, what's the guy they're not hurry for quite a lot?
If we could take as much time to get this all straight out as they did on penis skates,
then maybe we'd get it right.
Exactly.
There's no foreign army threatening us.
The Republicans want, and they know that Americans, unfortunately,
they have a simple pen to attention span, and they want to sneak this in,
hurt, wink it, and swear this guy in.
And at 60, 90 days from now, whenever the freedom of information acts catches up,
and you have people come down here and they'll count the ballots.
They have a spin doctor for that.
Yeah.
But they counted wrong.
They've punctured.
Yeah.
They counted with the moon with the moon.
They have an eyesight.
They were caca in.
Right.
And why are people afraid of the truth count?
Let's get a fair and accurate count.
Let's get there.
Forget what happened here that we all know that the Gore won an outright with that stupid ass
and I gratify our ballots that they happen in Palm Beach County.
And that's how you, and one thing that I'm putting on my list,
and I hope this guy gets paid, and we Democrats, unfortunately,
I think we're the majority, but we sometimes fall asleep at the control.
We've got to get this mayor ping-pong to pategna get him the hell out of here.
I have a headache.
Do that.
Well, I think he's very big.
How are you going to do that when everyone in the Cuban's are vote twice for him?
How are you going to do that?
Listen, I may, I may who will you go?
Yeah.
But you're not Cuban.
No, I am, I'm a who will you.
I'm a Cuban.
From, from, from, Carbana, Cuba, who settled in, in New York in 1961, they got exiled.
We need to get the power in here, the power of Miami.
Cubans have a lot of economic power, a lot of political power.
Yes, but there's also a lot of affluent Cuban Democrats who have decided that they're going to hide
after alien and run for cover, and it's time for exercise control again.
This gap in the United States is get the backbone of a jellyfish.
And we've got to get them out.
We've got to clean up the Republican legislature.
Eventually, all these old cruders are going to die.
And it's not going to happen.
It's a red next trade.
You're not going to clean it up.
So take a look at what you're talking about.
Well, I think the demographics in the state, we now have the two senators.
And Graham is pretty much a locking.
The congressional district, I don't know how the Florida delegation is, it's more Republican,
a more Democrat.
But the legislature here, unfortunately, would happen after a child's passed away here at the state level.
Well, I don't know what good candidates they've run for the state house districts and what have you.
But they need to make a consensus with the put money in here.
I don't know if the DNC's got a pump in cash in here or do what.
But first you get pushed out.
Once you get pushed out, then you have the governorship.
You have the two senators.
And that starts to build whether swinging the other way.
No, don't forget we have the Asian to hold them.
We can always fall back on bloody McCay.
And you know what?
The demographics in the state are going to change because there are more and more Hispanic
coming in every day from Colombia.
And other Hispanic groups, non-traditional, others think you've been sent to register Democrat.
Well, thank you.
And make sure they bring the good drugs.
Yeah, so that gets you out.
Out and, and this bush bastard, we can't let this slide.
I think it's a lot more than the form of better valid.
Come from the other side.
I think it's a lot more than the form of better valid.
I think it's a lot more than the form of better valid.
I think it's a lot more than the form of better valid.
I think it's a lot more than the form of better valid.
I think it's a lot more than the form of better valid.
I think it's a lot more than the form of better valid.
I think it's a lot more than the form of better valid.
I think it's a lot more than the form of better valid.
I think it's a lot more than the form of better valid.
I think it's a lot more than the form of better valid.
A pumpkin.
Can't beat that girly ass.
This is so sweet.
So bad.
We're not half-finned.
Because children battle too early to be able to make a fight forever.
But everybody knows.
Everyone knows.
We always fight against this heritage.
That's all we've got.

I want my real gun, I want my real gun, I want to woo. This gun, I have heard of having the gun, I especially used, originally I tried to be a police officer, I was a knower, I wanted to for anti-mig Crux, I didn't even afford a gun, for anti-m gemeinsam, I didn't feel like bearing. I got demande, it was expensive, very expensive, and it went so cheap back then, I thought it was just too expensive, for a kid to be expensive, but it wasn't a cheap price to charge I really didn't want to ride. I wanted to get myself on a street, I really abandoned Mighty Mama, Stan, and for the remix, so I wanted to get myself on a street, I didn't want to ride.
That is no good brother, in the President's speech.
He's got a job to take the baby with a bush.
Who's fragile, boom, with a big hair full.
He's got a lot of money.
He's got a lot of money.
He's got a lot of money.
He's got a lot of money.
He's got a little treasure.
He's got a big head all right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Sixteen.
What are you saying?
Oh, right.
Sixteen to the moon at 5.60 W.Q.M.
And any minute from now, maybe 16 minutes from now,
we might get the running from the judge.
You think you got the running?
No.
No.
How about five after?
What are you saying?
No.
Ten.
Here's a fact from an army who says,
who's a Republican self-identified says,
in my opinion, on November 7th,
it's gore lost by a neuro-emargin.
That made him the front runner for the next election.
The more things drag on,
the less chance I have being nominated for 2004.
If that's the case,
and I say,
drag it on till the health freeze is over.
I keep hearing a lot of people saying that.
Or if he just concedes gracefully now,
he's going to, you know,
have no chance.
This is no effing chance, baby.
This is it.
You think the Democratic Party is going to make this mistake again?
No.
Putting up a lame call, man.
Yeah, they would never do that twice.
Ununusualized Walter Mondale and Michael DuCoccus.
Hey, they won, Virginia Carter.
Against the man who pardoned Nixon,
I'm sorry.
And just really won a bet.
Here's a model in some rise.
Hello?
Leo.
Yes, sir.
How are you?
Okay.
Stake and shake was pretty good today.
Stake and shake.
I did try it over the weekend,
and the shakes are fantastic.
Yeah, they got a little work to do in the other stuff.
I'll get it down, Pat.
But they're chocolate shake,
it's out of the world.
Yeah.
With a little cherry on top.
Yes.
A couple of comments.
Maybe you can explain it to me.
I'm not a mathematician.
Like the, what was his name?
The guy from Germany there on the, on the, what's his name?
He was a little nervous.
I thought I was nervous, but he made me look calm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
How cool it has to pop into both by what's the margin?
300,000 stars.
About a third of a million.
I heard that all the votes were not counted in California.
The absentees and they're not going to count them.
Do you think that that'll let me ask you this?
Where does that keep coming from?
Or that they're not going to count them?
Well, why is that?
I heard the governor Davis out there on it on an interview
with Larry said that there was no need to,
yeah, that there was no need to count them.
Because of the, you know, because I guess I'll go on one by such a large margin
that it wouldn't matter.
It wouldn't affect any races there whatsoever.
So I don't know why they're not going to count them.
But that could change the population of both.
Wouldn't you agree?
Possibly, but unlikely.
Okay.
Another comment.
A state of Florida, there's 67 counties.
George Boyle.
And an addition to which, what differences that make
whether it changes the population of it or not?
Well, I'll go and keep going around saying that, you know,
he won this election.
And you know, he doesn't keep saying that.
He said he won a population of both and he respects the fact that that's not the way we like presidents.
He said, well, what differences it makes?
Well, I keep, you know, every time I hear the guy, he, you know,
he insinuates that more and more people want him to be the president.
So, you know, they're there for him.
Well, let me just, let me put it to you this way.
Based on the votes that have been counted, that's true.
Great.
That's right, exactly.
And based on the electoral votes that have been decided,
absolutely conclusively, that's also true.
But what's the point?
Okay.
Well, here's another comment.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
One second.
Again, and this time, read what we say to you in these seven pages and try to get it right.
Hold on.
The Supreme Court says there is, after the US Supreme Court says that,
if you're looking carefully at the Florida Supreme Court opinion,
we find there is considerable uncertainty as to the precise grounds for the decision.
And the key question here is whether the Florida Supreme Court based its ruling on the US,
on its own state constitution or its own state laws.
Now, that's important because the US Constitution says that legislatures direct how electors
or choose are chosen.
And if the Florida Supreme Court has based its opinion not on a law,
which is passed by the legislature, but instead something else,
in this case, the state constitution, then it could be on very thin ice top.
All right.
Thanks very much, people.
And we'll let your catch your breath and read that decision some more.
We're going to go to, and the US Supreme Court, the first,
the first, the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court, the Secretary of the Constitution,
theиной, he is an expert on the Head of the RSA.
I believe if you expect this from me, the Porter– Grande Family Friday Live is an expert on
this theory, oh yeah, and…
What did I say?
What are the arguments, Professor Field?
Hopefully this was essentially which you predicted might happen.
But they were sent at the back, because there were too many references to the state constitution in the Florida Supreme Court's decision.
Time, I don't find this to be a surprisingly decision in light of the oral arguments.
A great deal of uncertainty in the Supreme Court about exactly what the Florida Court
has done.
Justice Ginsburg suggested at the end of the argument this is a possible grounds for
unanimous decision by the Supreme Court.
It means that the Florida Supreme Court was neither right, nor wrong, but it may have
relied on an impermissible reason.
So the U.S. Supreme Court says, we'll send it back to the Florida Court.
Tell us again, with greater clarity precisely what the basis for your decision is, we will
maybe review it at that point.
Well, the headliner is going on.
There is incorrect then on the UNF-72.
Right in the United States Supreme Court.
It says U.S. Supreme Court reverses the Florida Supreme Court decision, which isn't true.
They sent it back and said, take out the look at it.
We'll get around to more.
Which is a way of getting also hope for now.
About the meeting of Florida Laws and the Florida Supreme Court is not infected by it.
And it's wrong.
It's wrong.
That's what the U.S. Supreme Court is saying puts it right back in the hands of the Florida
Supreme Court.
And they could reach exactly the same decision a second time.
All right.
Professor Kondaswara, I should stand by there and talk about the political implications now
within the system.
Well, somebody can describe some speak therapy for time for getting this decision from the
U.S. Supreme Court.
We're awaiting the judgment of the Supreme Court in Florida.
So whether or not the formal contesting of this election can go forward, all of this
is beginning to eat up time and one presumes maybe eating into the patience of the American
public.
But Tom, one week from tomorrow is December 12.
That is the decision that the Florida legislature must in fact appoint electors if they are
going to step on this role.
That's what.
That's what.
That's what.
You just that.
This is not good news for Al Gore.
Even though it is not a completely versatile of the Florida Supreme Court, it will have to
go back to the Florida Supreme Court for further review and for their action.
Also, Tom, not only the Supreme Court's case you mentioned in the state of Florida,
tomorrow in Atlanta, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals at the federal level is also hearing
another case about what had happened in transpired in Florida.
There are going to be those three cases plus the local court in Seminole County dealing
with the F. and T. ballot situation.
That makes a total of four.
All of those cases are critical to Al Gore.
He needs to have the Supreme Court in Florida given a clear victory on this remaining
modest Supreme Court.
He needs a clear victory today from the judge in Leon County and he needs to hold off
a defeat in the federal circuit court in Atlanta tomorrow.
We have a very new call from the F.
ahead, particularly only eight days ago when those electors must be chosen.
All right, thanks for having us.
Oh, they put the headline down.
We have given people names of chance to catch us rough and I have to say this, the decision
more fully.
What else have you done?
Now they changed the headline.
The US Supreme Court reaches the decision on another case just like on election night of
the media rushing the judgment and giving out glorious information.
Precisely what the Florida State Supreme Court was up to and they cite, I don't know, I
don't know your rulings in the subpoena time in saying that ambiguous or obscure rulings
by state courts shouldn't be barriers to a determination by the Supreme Court but
intelligent exercise of our appellate powers compel them to ask for the elimination of
the obscurities and the ambiguities from the opinions in such cases.
So they're saying it's always touchy for us to review what a state Supreme Court has
done, especially when it appears to be ruling on its own laws.
So we're just not going to go into the thicket right now because we frankly don't know
where we are.
And so they're saying to the state Supreme Court, try again and if you do, we'll take
another look at it.
But they just basically saying we can't be sure exactly what the Florida Supreme Court
decision is based on it.
Now you see what this is what this was down to if they would have been recounting all
along, if they would have finished the manual recount, even if it was only these 13 or
14,000 ballots.
Then all the rest of this might be moved because then what might have moved the head
actually and then of course the Bush people will be singing a whole different tune and
the girl people will be singing a whole different tune.
But that's not the way it is.
The Bush people are trying to wrap it up and the more people are desperately trying to
buy time.
I don't think they're ever going to recount those both but we might find that out in about
10 minutes and let me show you it again.
Or look at us.
Now they change the head on a third time.
US Supreme Court then cased back to the Florida Supreme Court.
Let me say it for the eight billion time because you can never say this too much.
And maybe that is just a new top statement.
Yeah, let's not get it right.
Let's just get it first.
And they did scope CNN by several minutes on this released by a couple of minutes.
But did they get it right?
No.
No, although confusing with the facts.
Here's plantation.
Hello.
Danielle, yes sir.
The only real problem I have with it with the recount is that in Palm Beach County
at a, what was it, 15,000 questionable votes they found about what 178 votes for
Al Gore in Broward in one fifth of the ballots about 1500 maybe more than about a tenth
of a ballot they found over 500 votes for Al Gore.
In other words, it came just down to determination by whose opinion it was not by any set standard
which there is no set standard.
And so in that case, my vote which I voted for Bush may well be overturned or they're
nullified by somebody's vote that didn't really mean to vote but it was a determined
that they go to for Gore and not really a true vote.
Well, let me answer this.
How come the Dimple votes in Texas, which is Bush's home state and he signed that law?
How come there's all counted?
Nobody made a big fuss about it.
I tell you there's never been a vote that's close.
And I don't get that law.
No, wait a minute.
It was a 2000 vote margin in the race for state legislature and then Texas.
Now, this is only 537.
But there wasn't any argument.
Every single one of the Dimple ballots in Texas was counted.
Why is it okay to count them in Texas?
But if it's in Florida, well, they're just guessing, they're making it up, they're
guessing the intent of the voter.
I mean, either it is or it isn't.
All because they counted all the votes in Texas.
They didn't count all the votes here.
In other words, somebody vote in Seminoe County where...
But what is it?
But isn't that what the Gore people wanted in the first place was a complete manual
recount in Palm Beach, the date in Broward County.
Is that what they asked for?
And they also said, let's recap the whole state if you want.
The Bush people said no.
But they're written on the out for three specific counties.
They say no.
They challenge the vote in those counties.
And the Bush people could have done the same thing.
And interestingly, even the Bush didn't challenge in some of the counties like Polk County
and Seminoe County.
They still picked up 100 extra votes in Polk County, 98 extra votes in Seminoe County.
We were not asking.
They just want to hit and recount it.
Well, regardless of who your county, I don't think it's any fair for someone else.
If you're a Democrat, you're allowed to be nullified by a...
I have...
And I'm going to say it again.
They should have recounted the entire state.
Every place where they had paper ballots, they should have been recounted.
Well, the wasn't Gore available to do that if he wanted to.
He didn't have to ask for just three counties could ask for them every county, right?
But they didn't.
I understand.
And then Bush could have asked for whatever counties he wanted, where he won big.
And Gore, I'll say it again.
Gore offered, even though of course the law we would have been kind of touching.
But Gore offered them.
Let's have a recount of the whole state.
The Bush people said absolutely not.
Well, that would have been verifying their whole argument was that the hand counts can't take place after a certain date.
And that would have nullified their argument there.
I mean, it would have made them look pretty hypocritical to want to do that after they said these ballots are...
I mean, it wouldn't have made them look hypocritical.
It would have made them look very magnanimous.
It seems to me to say that even though the deadline passed and you didn't challenge,
we'll let you go ahead and look out all of us.
That's the only way to do it.
It's got all the votes.
Yeah, but the thing before the Supreme Court now, and now back to the Florida Supreme Court,
is that the challenge cannot take place after the deadline.
And so for Bush to say, well, that's kind of...
Anyway, it would be kind of...
That would tend to kill their own case.
Okay, I have a great taste.
I'm getting a bad headache.
Don't confuse them with the facts.
And the ballots that they're talking about now, do they want to recount it?
If they're not going to recount the entire counties in Palm Beach and in Nassau County and in Dade,
the ones that the 14,000 have never actually been counted for anybody.
They were machine counted, but even as the machine experts at the Republicans and Bush people
were right on yesterday, admitted that the more that they keep machine recounting,
the more that it closes up the chads, closes up the holes, and the less the machine can count them.
And the less accurate it becomes.
And even he was forced to finally admit that the hand-witch out is more accurate.
It doesn't take a genius to figure that out.
And all these people are keeping screened.
And all my vote order didn't count.
How do you know that?
But we certainly do know these 14,000 votes are going to count as any of them more valid
because nobody has looked at them yet.
It's all crazy.
Because you live in Florida.
And this state can't do a goddamn thing right.
And if you don't believe me, just look at it.
If you're in a car right now, just look around you.
Just look at what's going on out there.
Port radio 560 W-Q-A-M by Andy Port-Logerdale, a beastly, brilliant group station M-W-Q-A-M dot com, or the world.
Listen to me who runs your shell.
This is his name.
Any questions?
Come on, America.
This time, he's growing up and step outside the closet.
Celebrate the popcorn, and bring out the game.
Bring out the game.
Bring out the game.
Celebrate the popcorn, and bring out the game.
From the holy age that you can get.
Christian reaches an all-day agent's right here, not pulling anyone anymore.
It's in the papers every day.
So why not catch up with the rest of the world?
In tell of the disciples the truth, the centuries of three.
Next time you want to reach out for groupings.
Reach for a hand, hello, hand.
Celebrate the popcorn, and bring out the game.
Bring out the game.
Bring out the game.
Celebrate the popcorn, and bring out the game.
Tell your disciples that you're dead.
Okay, 12-03-560 W-Q-A-M.
We're waiting on the big announcement from Leon County now on the heels of MSNBC.
And during the break there, I'm listening to the audio from MSNBC,
and they're trying desperately to cover their tracks,
like the dog going in the backyard and kicking up the dirt, 50 feet from where it has dropped the load.
Wow, we were at this advantage without having actual scene, yeah.
That's what they got it wrong.
In fact, here's somebody fast me this.
CNN comes up on their website with a headline.
US Supreme Court declined to hear Bush challenge details soon.
Is that what they said?
No.
Don't get it right. Just get it first and get it fast.
Five, so we got eight million open lines here.
Five, six, seven, oh, five, 60, pound, five, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.
Compat-O-B, chill out.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I moved down here a few months ago, and it was interesting.
I live in the Compat-O-B, and when I registered to vote, Jane Cowell, the director of officials,
she was pregnant at the time, but she was very hard-headed.
She was insisting that I tell her my party affiliation.
And I refused to tell her.
I said to her, that's really none of your business.
And she almost didn't want me to register, so I didn't tell her.
But I had to run you over.
How do you register without putting a party now?
Funny what the talk has directly.
I'm saying, I think it's hard business.
I mean, you could put it down, but it shouldn't be, she shouldn't know.
In my opinion.
Anyway, I heard recently she just resigned.
You know anything about that?
She just resigned?
Yeah.
I heard she's stepping down.
I don't know.
I think she did say that, that this was her last election.
I don't know.
I know she went on a bus mentality for her Thanksgiving.
She had a family associate family.
Well, what's her name?
Well, I just don't know anything.
I just don't know anything.
I know she is a Republican.
I think a lot of them are going to be stepping down soon, because it's going to become very obvious to most people that they are trying to conceal and hide a lot of things in regards to the whole.
Well, what did you conceal?
Well, I hide.
They had a hand-recon, brought, even though she high-tailed it.
They had a recount and a girl picked up hundreds of votes.
What was the point?
What does Jane Kiel have to do with it?
Well, I just think like, you know, she's just been striking you as somebody who should be in that kind of a position.
Well, how about the woman from that sort of kind of, was just the fine yesterday at Bozo, who didn't know the front door from the back door to a, oh, man.
When you go into vote, I mean, I haven't voted years until us.
So, you're going to vote, and you see the median age of the people of the poor workers is 155, because of course this country doesn't make it a national election day.
So, people who are living and breathing people who have to work, first of all, they have to make an extra added effort, either to work before work on their lunch hour after work or sometime in between.
And they get retirees, which in Florida means 100 plus.
And then when you listen to these Bozo's who are the supervisors, and I'm not talking about all of them, and then of course there's always David Leahy.
He's an asshole.
Yeah.
Who likes to faint a lot from the pressure.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 50.
So, then that will see it at an MSNBC.
Both were the story.
Nice going, guys.
And let's say it again, it was a vacate and remain.
Not a reversal and remain, which would have been real bad news to the world people.
It was a vacate and remain.
But we understand what they were saying as they're vacuous.
Do it over.
Yeah, do it over again and come back to us.
Get back to us.
Yeah, we don't get it.
Think about it some more.
But in the meantime, if they were already counting the votes, in a way this would be a good thing because it's another delaying tactic.
If they could ever get around to counting the guy they own votes, wait for us to still sit in your way and to find out if that's the judge that we used to like up until about 10 minutes ago up in the Leon County Judd Sal.
If he's going to get with it.
And tell us how you got there.
Yeah, exactly.
Here's some rise.
Hello.
Hi, Neil. How are you?
Okay.
Just answer what I call about.
But I do have an NTA on my voter registration card, which means no party is going to be a way.
So you don't have to declare.
Okay.
It's just means you can't vote for a party.
Oh, I got to say it's pretty damn pushy about it.
Yeah, well, I mean, I don't vote in the primaries, but then again, generally I did.
I wouldn't anyway.
But I would even read my call was to talk about the media and you're right.
You're dead on.
I mean, the media.
What's the hurry?
Why can't they wait right in the middle of the night?
Hang on, hang on.
I'm sure what they're saying.
That is update on where we're going.
I have had conversation with Leon County.
And we are on hold pending are being able to determine whether the US Supreme Court decisions as any effect on our proceedings.
Any previously announced intent to issue a ruling around to a clock is on hold pending this review.
Now, we do have some information on our other cases and Doug will share that with you at this time.
These are also subjects to the review of the Supreme Court.
So we'll go ahead and let you know.
And the McColley versus Bay County at all.
Case number 00 and at 2002.
Today it's scheduled for a case management and any of the motions that may come before the court on Monday, December 4th at 1 p.m.
Courtroom 3a before Judge Ralph Smith.

That's 2855.
It is scheduled for case management and any other motions that may become before the court on Wednesday.

You're hearing some of the menus, some of the lists of legal cases pending, but clearly what we are dealing with right now are two very fast-moving stories with great importance.
I don't like the trend, isn't it?
Not at all.
It's all like the fact you make me think that my stomach is going to determine it.
I'm going to be in the room.
I'm going to be in the room.
I'm going to be in the room.
I'm going to be in the room.
I'm going to be in the room.
I'm going to be in the room.
I'm going to be in the room.
I'm going to be in the room.
I'm going to be in the room.
I'm going to be in the room.
You're going to be in the room.
The film exposes votes to record votes for Zoe primary students.
My last chance for a week after the David Boy.
David Boy.
David Boy.
Talk about David Boy.
Talk about the chef.
David Boy.
After her, we'll now be the leader of the world.
Thanks to the Catholic Harris, church to the New York.
Yes, David Boy.
I'm the state control.
For me, David Boy, I'm the new.
So make thumb sore ego barriend.
Five foot ileopoam.
Five feet without가 красой.
The egocious brains,
ah broadens,
the way the boy gets so excited rid of.
The only person in America who has said that this state doesn't know how to do anything
right, the election is just another classic example in a long, long, years-long list of
screw-ups.
They don't know how to do anything right, and nobody has ever got to reason out what they
actually number was.
And the meantime, the Supreme Court says this, and the Florida Supreme Court is going
to have to go back and look at it again, and a jugularly on counties as well.
He's got a weight to it.
The his ruling is on hold, pending a review of the US Supreme Court decision.
He's holding it.
And so Roger Cossacks says what they did was good, because it buys more time for the
whole thing to end.
And Greta Vass and Van Brown says, no, you're wrong.
It was a tremendous disservice, because we needed some clarity because the clock is running,
and they needed some direction as to where they're going, and the meantime, they just bailed
out.
They copped out as what they did.
How do you like that?
All these big macho, even that freaking rank was that Big Nazi with his red robe and his
wash figure, they took a cop out as what they did to dinner.
And that's it.
Take a cop out to dinner.
Maybe he's got some good drugs.
5667, 0560, 0560 on, and they're going, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, and it just goes on,
and on, and on, like we're talking about something sane and rational here.
So Miguel gives me some bad news.
We're out of those key chains.
I warned you, and if you ordered over the net, don't worry because they're coming.
They've been put aside.
If you order over the internet, you're a bestie me of teaching.
But other than that, if you haven't, if you waited too long, you're S.O.L.
But you can still get the best of the L.C.D.'s and cassette that any soft-floated, special
music store, Dave Brown and Palm Beach, and even the Naples and Prestige Displore Myers.
How do you like that?
Do it for plant parenthood, and for yourself, you like it.
More mistaken headlines in the CNN, MSNBC, because they got a roasted judgment, baby.
They got to get out of there before anybody else.
Don't get it right.
Just get it fast.
I'm jagging on it.
Here's Miami.
Hello?
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, sir.
I think the goal could have clearly won the election.
We have won it for that.
Mungo, Lieberman.
I think we could have stole the elections.
Yeah.
And that's what we know a lot of people have been involved.
A lot of people have fun to rumble about that.
They would have a different running make in mind if they'd taken it.
Yeah.
Clear it.
Uh-huh.
Okay, thanks for the good news.
I told you, didn't I tell you that right off the bat right in the beginning?
I think I was on vacation.
What were they doing in the game?
Right on the bat.
I told you.
Well, the only reason I knew who he was was because we had the call way, way back before
I went off for the summertime.
And the woman said, oh, don't you know about this, do Lieberman?
He's an orthodox.
He's a fanatic.
And I went.
Oh.
Like that.
I heard that.
And then I started hearing about him and his wife pontificating and all of this crap
about cleaning up Hollywood and cleaning up his and cleaning up that.
And about we need to have more dialogue about the faith of America.
And I thought to myself, oh boy, a Jewish jury fall.
Well, this will we don't need.
If you just take, I mean, take a look when you watch the rallies they're having up there
in Tallahassee.
And you take a look at the Bush people.
But now maybe I'm a little bit pretty deduced.
But the first word that comes to mind my, the first thought that comes into my mind when
I see those people.
Be sure to approach the punch on that redneck.
Good old boys redneck every snake in one of them up there.
Of course down here we got two redneck, but up there you got redneck.
I'm not going to say everyone just 99%.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now can you, don't, would you guess since the margin is supposedly 537 right now if anybody
believes that would you say that maybe go lost at least a couple of thousand, maybe 5,000,
maybe 20,000 votes in the States because they're anti-Semitic redneck, they voted again.
You bet your sweet fat ass.
At least a thousand.
Yeah, at least a thousand, which leads to 463 goers ahead if you think of those thousand.
So I say let's deduct the anti-Semitic votes.
Right?
What do you say?
Oi!
Long hair.
They didn't, I'll say it again.
They deserve to lose.
I know that this dead doesn't go play really good with this audience.
All of our goal supporters out there.
We owe something for deserve to lose.
It was his to lose any lost it.
With a great prosperity eight years of good dead, they're not flowing the world up at
death at the moment.
I'm appointed mighty mighty row.
All the good stuff going on and it was theirs to lose because most people pull after
the poll show they didn't give a crap about double's poll about blow jobs.
Very few people cared about that.
And they lost it.
Ferent square.
Just like the Bush people, so it's Ferent square.
So I'm not going to get all busted up about it.
I mean I'm not happy, but just get it over with as well.
I'm saying get it over with.
Tell us something.
So it's very, this fucking incident thing when you're not into S&M.
You know what I'm saying?
It's like you're getting tied up and bound and you got the gag over your mouth.
With the bar like Hannibal Lecter and you're not into that.
Of course George is into that.
You know something tying up part.
Here's the Lady's Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Lady's Fort Lauderdale.
Hi, Mill.
Yes, ma'am.
That's you.
How are you?
This is my second time calling.
Okay.
You know what we really need to think about here.
And what is that?
That is that out of all the 50 states that are here in the United States of America,
we have Jeff Bush at the helm of Florida.
Jesse Helm, you know?
No.
Jeff, he's in charge of Florida.
He's in governor.
Uh-huh.
And then we have Stati Bush that was director of the CIA.
Yeah.
Now something.
What is it exactly to be trying to say?
Run the CIA.
There is a problem here.
Why does it happen here?
Why are we having so many problems?
Of course.
Of course it is because this is a great thing.
That's what I mean.
It's a great state to do it and because we can't get anything right.
And then to the state that's famous for face directions.
That's my, that's my, that's my, that's my, that's my, that's my, that's my, that's my point.
If there was a conspiracy, that was already set here.
So why did we wait all of this time?
I mean, election night, W. Told Gord, that is brother, told him he won Florida.
So we wait for all this time for.
We're just wasting time.
You got it.
That's exactly what happened.
Right.
And I just wanted you to know that.
Now they should look for the ratings of the news stations.
So I'll take it that.
Oh yeah.
Because they have nothing else to do.
They jumped on the monocle thing.
That's the same thing.
They got that before.
They jumped on all tennis.
You know, O.J.
And anything, anything that's giving these non people that we wouldn't see some kind of job to do.
How would the Roger and Greta be there for O.J.?
Right.
There you go.
Well, so it's good for the economy.
Okay.
I can calm down and have a great day.
You may know what she said.
No.
But I think she had a couple of good points.
I don't know what they were, but they were good.
Five, 17 open lines.
You're just a little working right here today.
They're lying five, of course.
They're never going to work again because they figured you know what that's like?
It's just like in promotions there.
We already discussed it.
They're not going to hire them a gallon of assistant and like give him, you know, the promotion that he deserves.
Because then they have to pay him more.
And then they have to bring in somebody else so they throw in a hard ball in his lap and say,
okay, you do it.
I'm not going to give you any more money for you to do it.
This is the most burguest cheap ass outfit I have ever seen in my life.
And then I asked roughly today, what year they're going to get line five, six, and he did it when he said, he said,
yeah.
So you're sitting here, it's just like on Friday.
Remember that point in the show after I, and this was the one point in the whole radio dial where there was somebody that had the balls to carry the whole hour and a half of the recorded crap from the US Supreme Court.
The oral arguments and the in-loguments.
I'll get come back after that.
And I'm not so sure if I maybe chased away the whole audience.
I give the numbers out and I'm sitting here and looking at a blank computer screen.
Why? Because the guy didn't crap in here don't work.
That's why.
The cheapest in the worst.
You've heard of the brightest and the best.
Here it's the cheapest in the worst.
Whatever money can't buy, that's what Beasley provides for us.
Nothing.
Zero.
You know something, when we get that one share, then they're going to have exactly what they deserve here.
And we're well on the way.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
Pretty good.
It's been a real long time since I spoke to you last.
You took the summer off.
It's good to have you back.
I have to tell you though that around election time, I really have to turn you off as much as I regret it.
I just can't.
I can't stand it anyway.
The reason I call for that is.
I can't stand what?
I can't stand.
I'm not going to be able to stand.
I'm not going to be able to stand.
I'm not going to be able to stand.
I'm not going to be able to stand.
I'm not going to be able to stand.
I'm not going to be able to stand.

I'm not going to be able to stand.
I'm not going to be able to stand.
I'm not going to be able to stand.
I'm not going to be able to stand.
This isn't a way to have an election.
Well, if there's a computer designed to my vote, then it can be researched with which person I vote it for.
And that removes the anonymous information.
Here's yourself some mental help.
Okay.
Go get yourself a shrink for your paranoia.
Oh my god.
How do you like that?
Then there's a big brother's going to come in.
What time is that on?
5.6705 and I should mention again.
Did I mention that in Amsterdam?
Why don't you watch him big brother over there that they have beautiful people and then women on there?
They don't do that.
They could get stuff.
I didn't watch it that long.
See when you're in Amsterdam, you don't need to see naked people on television.
Even though you always do.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure, you can see them in person.
But in any way, 5.6705.60, 0.560 on me.
I had to hang up on you because you're just testing my patients and my patients who are all so good.
I'm sitting in the guy in the room out there waiting for the doctor.
Oh, if you're sitting there, no matter what you come up with a solution for this guy, for the way to do it right,
no matter what the answer is, oh, but I'm paranoid and the government's going to know who I voted for.
We already all know who you voted for.
Trace the call, George.
Well, I know my sister all my life.
But that is why she's now my wife.
And I think my son may know it's true.
He's my nephew too.
Well, not that.
He is my uncle.
My mother is my dear aunt.
Well, it is very plain to see my first cousin is me.
Here.
Well, 30560WQAM.
Oh, and make sure you get that last guy a few more guns before time runs out.
Before they come in and take all his guns away.
Here's a mobile in Western.
Hello.
Over in Western.
Going once.
He'd be gone.
It'd be gone.
Here's a mobile in Vokalow.
Hey, now I'd be here.
Okay.
I got two things to say.
I think they're pretty reasonable.
One is about chance.
The Republican seemed to think that because each county does it differently,
that that somehow is unfair.
And I just want to point out that there's nothing inherently unfair.
It's like they do different states do a hand count with different standards.
Nobody would say that one state is more unfair than another.
So the fact that the counties do different standards,
there's nothing really unfair about that.
I think all systems unfair.
Well, that must be true, too.
I don't know.
Wait a minute.
Why don't we have specific standards?
I said this a couple of weeks ago.
Well, I still have a state, that's why.
No, no.
Are you listening to me?
At least we're within the state.
Why doesn't the state have specific uniform standards?
Because after all, we don't have 67 different elections for president here.
I mean, we don't have electoral vote space in the counties.
We have a statewide contest.
So why doesn't the state have uniform standards for how we're going to count the ballots?
So we're going to have hand recounts.
Yeah, we should have.
Is that something else to ask?
No, we definitely should have asked.
It's like with the absentee military ballots.
Why are they making it up as they go along?
Why don't we already have very stringent specific laws to deal with how they get counted
and how they have to appear?
Well, that's just another example of four to scoop it well.
Like, that's five.
If it wasn't for that five day, that stupidity of putting nothing in,
we wouldn't even, the Republicans would have noticed.
Oh, I'm giving it pretty much.
You know, there's a certification that's to come five days, you know,
when you came up, we'd do a hand recount five days.
That's in the law.
I got another thing to say.
When you think about it, why does George Bush, I mean, there's perception that Bush has more of a claim to the White House.
I mean, really, among everybody, then, but then, go, and when you think about it,
why is that?
What do you mean they're among everybody?
Basically, there seems to be more of a perception that he has more of a claim?
Because, in other words, because he's dead dumb and we've had a lot of dumb presidents, that makes it more entitled?
Well, partly, but I'll tell you why.
I think it is partly.
You know, they get on there and say they won, they won every vote, including the one on election night.
Yeah.
If you think about it, who says they won on election night?
And he said, and he said it.
No, and Jim told them.
His brother told them.
In other words, that is a table with a bit out all over the country.
In other words, the people who had been watching TV, then really, they wouldn't have to claim.
They didn't win on election night.
Nobody said they did.
Yeah.
And they didn't win on election night.
And they didn't win on election night.
And they didn't win on election night.
And they didn't win on election night.
And they didn't win on election night.
And they didn't win on election night.
And they didn't win on election night.
And they didn't win on election night.
And they didn't win on election night.
And they didn't win on election night.
And they didn't win on election night.

Big time.
You got your tippergore, and you got your limb chaney,
and you got your duro brumin, and all these people
who are into censorship.
So censorship is fascism.
So bridge-slide-duro buralosin have a wonderful life
and get out of our show.
Slide-gurodu.
Yeah, he's a senator who can see this from Washington.
Next senator.
You know something?
I guess you could say he used to be a Washington senator.
Oh, they don't have a baseball team anymore?
Here's a lady in Hollywood.
Hello.
Neil?
Yes, ma'am.
Hi.
I love this thing to your show.
And I want to tell you.
Well, the last guy doesn't love it,
because he don't like the language.
No, I like the language.
I'm cool.
I'm a cool captain.
That's true.
Okay.
And I wanted to tell you that my husband,
we got one of your subscribers.
You know, you're the people that advertise on your show,
a PPO person, and it's really nice, and we love them.
And I wanted to tell you also about the election.
When we went to vote, we had a hard time.
You know, pushing it down.
You know, taking that one.
You had a hard time pushing it down.
Right.
You get it into the right spot,
so that we could press the right hole.
And a hard time pushing it down to get it in the right spot.
Or that last guy in the highway,
that he's going to drive off the road now.
And, uh...
Wow.
We don't understand why it can't be uniform, you know,
in the whole state.
That's what I just got to say to the other caller,
and they said, why are these things so difficult?
Do you want to know why?
Because this is Florida.
We don't know how to do anything right.
I don't know.
Usually, I'm not home, but I am today,
and I'm cooking for Hanukkah,
and I thought I'd give you a phone call.
Oh, because you have to be people to call in.
Yeah.
But also, did you read today's paper,
we're changing app, or do you resign?
I saw it.
I saw it in my performance yesterday.
It was my funny.
What kind of hutsva does he have?
Right.
And his wife, if you see her on that interview,
with her.
Oh, wait, does he have a lot of huts, sir?
Oh, my God.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know...
What's that?
It was out.
Okay, she just read this.
She said the wind was going to...
5607, 05 60,
position 560 on the AT&T,
allows the wireless line.
21 before 105 60 WQM.
Whose this guy?
That.
Really?
Oh, this is one of the records.
Now have a fact that Bush was ahead then,
and Bush is still ahead now, so as far as who's going to win the electoral votes in Florida,
that issue still has not been completely dissolved.
Okay, thank you so much for those first occasions, Scott. That was great. That was on CNN, boys and girls.
The Neil Roger show, sports radio, line 60s, QA, and he criminalized pot in Florida.
I caught 6D on the P.W.S. Fairytale.
6 villages, things were not for me.
They held a safe convention with a return of a C-in board free, a return for a joint deal with what I was about to see.
Or they were speaking in tongues, that made me a very loud voice, with kind of fun.
They got me going, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were
talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were talking to me, they were loitering, they were making fun of me, they were talking to me, my sisters that had gone into the captain's mud, and they were
playing in the same house, as my sisters in the captain's basin, and we had to learn from them, they were talking to me but they
Prop 45 at 560 QAM.
So anyway, Jim and Bocafax is me, this thing.
And you see, this is a technical calendar.
This is a little piece of the ruling by the US Supreme Court today.
And he says, the pertinent part of the Court's ruling puts Bush Lee back at 930.
Yeah, for like right now, because basically by vacating the ruling of the photosupply
court, it puts everything back in the limbo at that point where we were before,
before the power to be counted.
But it's a move because as long as Robert just here on CNN,
they don't send you a postcard saying, well, there are some parts of this that are vague and ambiguous.
This is the way they get it back out of the Supreme Court for further clarification,
is they vacate the ruling.
And so you tell us something we can understand like that.
So they got a call before that was on heavy mushrooms from LA.
Yeah, temporarily you're right.
But it's a move point.
That doesn't mean anything.
56670560.560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
32 votes on our polls so far today.
Our survey says, question is, is this finally time for Robert to concede?
No 198, 55.5%.
Yes, 103, 34.5%.
Got it?
Uh-huh.
What's the still of the line one? Is that working?
Okay. Just checking the hand been off its feet today.
Not that I'm suspicious about these phones.
Yeah, Roger's back.
Yeah.
Here's Miami. Hello.
Miami, oh.
Yes, sir.
Yeah. First of all, uh, you know, this notion that 20,000 people more or less went into the polls
and, you know, didn't have them, I made up and walked in there and put them out and then stuck their little needle
and then they were like, you know, they were like, you know, they were like, you know, they were like, you know, they were stuck in the hole.
They put the needle in the back.
They were like, you know, I don't like these things. I'm not voting anymore.
You know, I could see maybe a handful of people doing that.
I could see when you have an election that's either separated by 537 or 930 votes.
But it's that close out of 6 million.
I can see that it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if you want to feel an accurate, uh, tally,
that each and every vote must be, uh, if there's a debate on them, must be inspected at least once.
I'm not talking about machine recounts where the Chad keep closing up or if they're already closed up, won't count.
We're talking about inspecting them, I'm sure that he's for the intent of the voter is counted.
Right.
And it should have been done.
Stay wide. If they had any balls, many brains, that's what would have been done. But then again, this is Florida.
Uh, and the floor on the argument is, you know, each candidate, which would pick up votes to.
Right. There were people that they picked up votes in both of them, right? You picked up votes in Palm Beach.
But they know the goal would pick up more overall. Right.
Right. They oppose it. And a part and thought, uh, it just occurred to me why the Republican party has catered so much to the religious right and, and, and this religious fervor, fervor, excuse me.
It's because without that, they wouldn't have any other appeal to any kind of common person or any of the masses.
Whatever appeal that they have to they appeal or class, they appeal to selflessness, they feel the appeal of the rich.
So people who are, uh, right, the rich, well, they're going to get the rich anyways, but they're not going to get the lower classes without appealing to this, you know, uh,
the ones mentality. Right. That's it. I've got there. Just look at the states that George W. One on the map. Don't forget 1980 read the three hours races and religion and Reagan.
No, they're on the way back to Trinity, the Holy Trinity. You got it. All right. Say how to Janipal crunch. See, I, yeah, Trinity broadcasting. They put the money. Come on.
You're on the first day of the day. Before it's too late because once we get to the poorly gates, it'll be too late. And then you're going to wish that you want your straight and narrow path, at least on that straight part anyway.
And you see these go in and date County, or I can't get it again on election day. They got all signatures on a ballot so we can go back and do it.
Other and need to buy 24 years later. Oh God. Is it ever going to end? No. Let me say it again. Hate is a family value in the Republican party. That's what it's all about. Here's Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir.
Neil, you know what I'm going to think you're saying? And you're not like this. You do not have an election. The Democrats. Hello. Neil. I'm listening. Okay. The Democrats themselves have been self-inflicted. I'll tell you why. Number one, the leadership couldn't get the people to roll right and punch the whole collective.
Number two, they couldn't get seven Supreme Court judges in the entire half to write on a print that was banned and found out how do you know that?
I don't know. You wouldn't hire a problem when the test find behalf of a ball of gore after a question, Brian, who was imagining things.
The women. The women. The women. The women. The women. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. One thing. One thing. One thing. Can I say. One thing. You rude. Who are you? I was just about to say the witnesses on both sides. And that was the most of the rest of what you had to say.
That you were like so many of the callers don't have any idea what it means to have a conversation. See, this is a talk show. That means we have conversations.
You talk. I talk a little bit. The new listen. Then I listen to the rest of it. Let's call the conversation. Not a speech. Not a speech, sir.
Yeah, get back on the banana boat. Freedom of speech, which you don't understand. All you know is freedom of your speech.
What was that speech? This point he was making five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18 and three and four eyes and where we're from.
And say how to alien to why do I have an end at five year old kid? Maybe the two of it is playing with area. And maybe the above deserve playing with it.
Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18 and three. And not only that. How's the fisherman doing? Huh? He's doing it. Here's pomp and OB. Chill. Hello. Yes, sir.
I know you had several callers and one of them is to go talking about having a uniform state balance. Yeah, can't have it because even across the street, there were different people.
So you can't have that. We're talking about having a uniform standards. So not a uniform ballot with the same names on it. You'd pose or you. You depend on the particular part. We're talking about having uniform standards.
I want constitutes a legitimate vote in the recount. That's what we were talking about, sir. And in addition to which a standard form, not butterfly ballot, not caterpillar ballots, but a standard form standard forms can have different names on them. And guess what? The other states they have different names on. Wow.
Well, put anybody on this phone again over the age of 200, okay, 150. I can handle 200. The answer is no. No. I will not speak anymore 300 year old. And that's what I wind up with talking about this guy demolition. That's another reason I wish to get it over with already.
From a selfish standpoint, so we can go back to have a good time here and then heaven if you last and yuck this ain't funny. I'll tell you that. This is pathetic. I know which is more pathetic. How incompetent this state isn't doing everything or listening to these calls 90% of which are burzos.
There is a ringling brothers people are in town and you're hiring believe me. We got a long list of applicants waiting for you out there. A long list of suffocates with a big red nose. How's the pony over?
They're sticking a big red nose. All right. All right.
Patrick McKinsey and I originally adopted. Yeah. Well, you know, what you're having about if we don't start getting some serious calls here on us and playing tip on you every day for four hours. We're going to tip a few in on of the new president.
Here's my need be. Hello. How you doing? All right. Hold on one sec. Yeah. I'm going from agreement with you about one. I think this country is in dire need of a third party. I believe in the in the next election that the party will come from within the Republican and Democrat being the moderate.
Let's see. I'd I had a lot of issues. Yeah. And I feel if you choose just even to earn the next you might have a legitimate tent at a good third party can't. All right. That's right. He's got my vote, baby. I'm going to vote 40 times when he runs out both 50 times. Right. I'm another thing. 60. The network stone seemed to be catching on to this story. The fact that our war and Joe Lieberman had a man eyes as far with Barbara Bush. Yeah. And that. Okay. Great. 5.6.7. Oh, 5.6.
50. Compot. Ken Walden got some hot stuff for us. What's that? Oh, some dumb factors. Thanks, Ken. Somebody literally factors from some of our audience came in on the wrong machine. Anything good in there? No. Now just a single tired craft. Put waste on our fast table of crap. If you got something good, we love this. If it's crap, just wipe your. Where we going? Here's Tamara. Hello. Hey, Neil. How are you today? Okay. First of all, I suppose it when K people have elections and put their
little rock and basket. The election was more reliable than our here in Florida. Yes, that's right. 5.6.7. Oh, 5.60. Com 5.60 on the AT&T and Verizon. Why was I called again in about two years? So, okay. Just a side of your voices, starting to get me here in my sleep. Orban Pandora's. Here's for a lot of Dale. Huh? Yeah. I feel all right. Listen, I had a few points. I hope they're. Code. And more and lighten. Excuse me.
More than any more. But one justifier made an interesting point and brothers now, several judges, my attorney in San Francisco. And he mentioned Seminole County. Now, Seminole County, where people actually went and filled out the form. That is a federal as you well with. That is a federal. That is felony. Yeah. And therefore, those. Foodie 700.
British, I know they're talking about 10,000 to 15,000. That's where you see the same. I do number, you know, somebody using the same handwriting, which is very easy to spot. Right. Only about 15 or 20 of them doing. That's why they call it a handwriting. I couldn't. And there were people making fun of that. That is not to make fun of. And that is where when it goes back to the Seminole County, maybe even more important than judge judge. Because when it goes back to him.
And the fact of the lady, Nikki Clark, just this then she, she will determine if it was for. Right. And if there's a fraud anywhere in the United States, all 50 of them, then that is an issue for the Supreme Court of the United States and for the Florida Supreme Court. This was those votes out. So I guess what I'm saying is I know it is literally bleak here, but the ballgame is not old. Yeah, that hearings on Wednesday. I like that is correct. Sure. Right.
And so, you know, I, you know, I thought that Brian's question and I appreciate you playing these guys in my car. That's where you're on Friday playing this. His question was very, very pointed. Now then that's what the other thing they can get into and and guess what? All the King's courses and the legislature and everybody else.
Well, the fraud votes are thrown out. I say I say take everybody in Seminole County for the ball and you know, the great day pal. Thank you. What are you doing? Okay, hang on tight. We still got a long way to go boys and girls. We got this suit and that suit even Austin Burke never had this many suits.
Even the Gregory never had so many cheap suits. Here classy guy or what?
Well, 57 to 560 WQ. I'm just fighting my car. All the blood is just rooting out. It's not just the one to two hour. It's a phenomenon.
It was the month of November when Alvar showed off his member.
I'm a man.
We never got a chance to see it because they took his wood and then they're brushed it. There's some things that shoot and be seen like vice president.
I'm a man.
I'm a man.
Okay, 103 at 560 WQM David Boyz is honoring just something 560 560 pound 560 and my head is pounded.
It's maddening. It's maddening. You try to take chaos. You try to take a mess.
57 different counties with 57 of sort of different messes and irregularities. Even the even people with IVS and Groot never had so many damn irregularities.
And now they're trying to make it all fit. It's like taking shoes that are 15 sizes too small for your feet and trying to make it fit.
And if it doesn't fit, then you're full of Schmidt. Here's Miami. Hello.
Yes sir. Okay, Neal.
I'm going back to the point. What is going on with this cream car? The seven doctor's chronic.
560 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60. Any chronic I got to this for this my new year's resolution and we're starting a month early.
Chronic I have one thing to say all you chronic's out there. Yeah enough.
The killers of talk radio the chronic especially the ones that sound like him. Oh, there was a guy from before.
What? No, it's a different one. Believe me trust me when I tell you I know my chronic.
Here's a mobile in Hollywood. Hello. Here's a mobile in four-bottomedale. Hello.
Can I change the subject for a moment? Yeah, whatever you like, man. Well, I want to thank you and thanks for origin.
Thank all the people who put your CD and keychain together. I placed an order on nail lodgers.com.
Waited a couple weeks. I thought it was a little too long or something but you know, it was worth the wait.
I was very happy with the CD and the keychain. I gave the keychain as a gift and I was very much loved it.
And they went, oh God, I got a new port and they were thrilled. I was very happy to buy that stuff.
And I hope you keep doing it for as many years as you're going to be at QAM.
Are you? Yes, I am. Beautiful. I will continue pouring money to whatever charity you sponsor.
Great. Thank you. I mean, another note. Can I ask you what's wrong with the panthers this year?
Black is a talent. No, I didn't have a talent. I thought it was DM.
Well, it wasn't even a talent come from the general manager. Where does it come from?
Bad general manager, bad coach, lack of talent. And now that they're trying to pedal robbing Neemar, the worst in both articles, like I said before, in both newspapers today, with Top Again, they're from the organization.
What does that tell you? They keep trying to con the fans. I mean, nobody don't have too many fans understand the game.
But if you listen to where the fans blew every time his name is mentioned, Neemar and Terry Murray, they're not following anybody.
Where they try to shove Chris Wells down the fan's throat. Then it was P.O.R.L. Well, he's going to be there.
He's going to be there. And as you saw St. Lucia, he cannot play the game. And now it's Robby.
Oh, he's a great role player. He's doing it. They're not following anybody. It's a lack of talent.
I have no idea how much longer a ball he is going to sit back and watch him destroy the franchise.
Well, I am just depressed. It's been a depressing year. I hope they can know.
And then after the Red Wing game, and you'll notice the Red Wing's winning the Tampa, the very next night,
and got shut out through nothing, outshot by the lightning, 20 to nothing in the first period,
after they beat this team three to one. And the Red Wing's barely even showed up here on Saturday night.
And the next morning I read the papers, all great effort by the Panthers is wasted.
How can they have a great effort if you can't score any goals? This team doesn't score any goals.
It's either zero or one or two, and that's it.
And they're getting all these points just by going into O. T. and losing an O. T.
And it's just it's defeating that they have this many points.
Well, I'll post the fact that they're in the worst division in the history of sports. That's, you know, that helps too.
That's true. In closing, they'll just bring back still a baby.
Okay, I have a rate they found.
I said bring back Jason William Marty Strucker sounds good to me. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
Here's Hollywood. Hello.
We'll speak of the Panthers. Look at the schedule coming up tonight.
You got the Isle Bears, the avalanche, the Red Wing's Pittsburgh, football, the Rangers, the first jersey again.
They probably are going to win a game maybe sometime in January.
As far as the election, outcome nothing's being made.
I know you mentioned about like this contract on top of whether the lady went and let people go on the computer and some little county up there in Florida.
And all you have to keep both people in there, Republicans change and write and things.
Why doesn't any of that come to any of these the limelight?
I mean, why is like a lot of things just not brought up?
What do you mean it's not brought up? They're having a hearing on it and quote Wednesday on the county. There's a lawsuit over it.
But even like how they strike things down up and down. I mean,
you know, it should be the easy thing. Just get a new ballot left side bush right side go or vice versa.
I do redo the whole state.
I say coin flip is what I say. Let's do it right.
Right to 50 R line next off an old game 50 R line coin toss and Jeb's going to bring the coin.
Well, he says two heads are better than one. Nobody always said.
Yeah. Or like you're just two bushes are better than one.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T and Verizon wireless one.
Now bring it those keys yet. No, no.
You know that word that what was that word that I had for more this in general.
I'm going to start using the same word for fat out this in general.
Oh, I'm coming by with the keys and I'm bringing the Julie better for go.
No, no, you're not.
Not even in the building much less in our studio. I got a bang with the butt.
I'll never get these things out of my husband's shorts.
You will now introducing new no

It fluids the toughest things to remove from valuable undergarments.
Whether it's not the secretions blood even see new no

Have we got to do that tomorrow?
No.
Here's my any.
Hello.
Okay, my name is gone.
Kendall, hello.
Kendall.
Hey, oh, yes sir.
How you doing?
Okay.
I went to vote on the November 7th.
So up to a little bit.
I'll say with my yellow card.
And the lady says, there's a problem here.
Your name appears twice on the roster.
Okay, so I knew it was coming.
She gets a supervisor.
She said, over sir, your name appears twice.
Yeah.
Ma'am, I have a son with identical name.
Okay, so in the roster, if you look a little common,
let this two different birthdays.
You all walked away.
But your pity is working at them on a borrowed thing.
Unbelievable.
You got it.
Unbelievable.
Most of them over the age of 100.
This one was about 81.
Uh-huh.
And she said, well, I'm sorry sir.
Well, you wasted my time in a few minutes.
I mean, you know, what you just said ties in everything I'm saying.
If anybody believes that we really conducted an election this,
on this state, on the 7th of November,
I got some cheap land to sell them in the Everglades.
And you know, what do you have 50,000 people with the same last name?
In the same first name?
The exact same.
This way, this way, if I know it is a problem here,
you can't vote twice.
Ma'am, that's my son as an identical name.
Don't confuse her with the facts, ma'am.
Anyway, back.
Good luck to us.
Yeah, how many George Rodriguez is your thinker, Arthur?
That's why you should just go ahead and vote.
I've heard.
There's plenty of George Rodriguez.
It would be unscrupulous.
Yeah, we could have that thing down to 929 again if you just would have voted.
Sorry, Mr. Scrupulous.
See, it's okay to be smoking all of that weed like you're just smoking right now in the studio.
That's okay.
That's not morally wrong.
Says who?
Me.
In me.
Here's Bay Harbor.
Hello.
Yes sir.
Hi, I got a, just to get off the voting nonsense.
I got a store for you, you'll love it.
That's a bridge tender.
I just came back from the Bay Harbor.
About the bridge tender?
A bridge tender.
Oh.
A bridge tender.
I got to the bridge.
The bridge was up.
Any time.
Yeah.
Yes?
Okay.
Two votes came by.
And then about three, if it looked at that three miles down, there was another bridge with that big sailor coming by and then.
It had to take about 15 minutes.
I was in back of his car.
This guy got out of his car and he was, first of all, he was blown as one.
And the bridge tender came out of his little house, he was idiot with his hands up.
And the guy, and the guy, and the guy from the car said, I'm taking my wife to the hospital in an emergency.
Can you please put the bridge down?
And the guy said, no, you have to wait till it was both coming.
Right.
And it was at least real.
I swear to God, I was at least 15 minutes before this boat came.
Uh-huh.
And this poor guy got back into his car.
I was expecting him to come out with a gun.
And his wife was in the driver in the passenger seat.
It looked like she was having a baby.
That's my advice to anybody out there getting a little over by a bridge tender.
Shifting in the leg.
Yeah.
This guy came out of his little house.
No, really, really.
He couldn't believe it.
Bridge tenders are all saying they're militant. I'm not just little Nazis.
He's a couldn't care less.
That's right.
It was unbelievable.
Well, that's a good idea to start.
I can't talk this story.
Thanks for the good news.
Okay.
Anya.
Anya.
Okay, calm down.
117-560.
Shifting in the leg.
WDQ-A-M-560705-60-POM-5.
Yeah, all you rich assholes with your boat south, there.
I don't know how you get started on the bridge tender crap again.
All these hot shots with their yachts.
There's nothing worse than a hot shot with a yacht.
They want to back traffic up, including emergency vehicle.
It's just like when the Julio's got hysterical about the coast guard last year.
Remember that?
Yeah.
And we're blocking off the goddamn Acosta Causeway for goddling those how long.
And it's just a miracle.
It's only blind luck that nobody died because the emergency vehicles couldn't get through.
Because as usual, they're pissed off and fired up.
And don't give a crap about anybody else.
Here's a mobile and key logo.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
How are you doing?
Okay.
Good.
Yeah, I really need your help with something.
You had a call on a while ago, asked about the ballots in Semmel County and stuff.
I'm just so confused and for flex, that's why nothing's been set.
I know this is a court case, but I mean, would everything else go on on the ballots in Palm Beach County,
the Julio's in Miami-Dade?
Yeah.
There's nothing.
Oh, I mean, I've seen very little about what's, what can he seems like the biggest piece of fraud during this fall?
You're starting on Wednesday.
You'll see a lot because I'm sure that that'll be televised and that's all they'll be talking about.
You've got to understand there are so many different suits going on all at the same time.
And then just when you think you have some idea of where we stand,
then the US Supreme Court voids in the remands, which means they sent the decision back to the Florida Supreme Court on the recount,
extending the deadline.
And you know, something, you have to be a rocket scientist at a very well-educated attorney,
even to begin to understand what the hell is going on.
Yeah, but it seems to have been far off the course of this whole election.
I mean, what things being left out of the media is obvious that the media seems to like to be in what they want to show.
The media is into a media scene, just like we saw about an hour ago when MSNBC was jumped the gun and put the wrong information on about,
you know, saying that the US Supreme Court over all the Florida Supreme Court,
and then they had to change the headline and they said, trying to cover up their tracks by saying,
well, we were disadvaded, we didn't have the printed ruling.
You know, I mean, they don't get, whatever is hot right now, that's what they're going to talk about.
You mark my words on Wednesday, you're going to have Seminole County coming out of your ears.
Okay, hey, one more thing.
Yes, sir. Watch queer smoke loss rate?
No.
I'll check it out.
That is those English words, but what's that?
What's that? What's that?
It's Sunday night, 10 o'clock in showtime.
Okay. All right, man, take a deep breath.
Let's see this.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60.
See, one thing that American TV people don't understand, the producers,
all these hot shots, to think that they know something,
the public wants to see beautiful people.
They don't want to see nerds, they don't want to see goofy people like unsurviver and big brother.
They want to see beautiful people,
who they're as little clothes on as possible.
That's what they want to see.
See, the Europeans, they understand that.
But America, no, they haven't gotten that yet.
God forbid.
Here's the mobile and dirt field, hello.
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
Sure, but from Palm Beach to Papano for Christ's sake.
You want to get out of the election, but I want to say something about the panthers.
I support that call before the break.
Back first night, Miami Arena,
fans 2600 a year for Tuesday,
who have all.
Next year, 3600.
Next year, 4600.
Right.
And you know, take a crisis, keep going up.
And the product and the product keeps getting worse.
They get rid of my claim.
And like you said, woolly stew.
And you know, I haven't been to a game this year.
And I don't have my season ticket.
Do you have, you haven't met me.
And I get offered seats every week.
I refuse.
I watch them on TV a little bit.
You know, I can't believe what these brothers should.
That's not why I don't say that again.
We had about really 15,000 there.
And I would say about 3,000, the more red wing fans.
And if that's what you're going to depend on,
is the fans, the other teams,
to make the place look respectable,
you're in real trouble.
Right.
It's just, you know, I just can't believe what's going on with the team.
We do have some talent with all of our partners.
And if you think the public is going to come to a game to see Syria,
Federerov, there would no him.
They don't come to see Papal Bury.
They're sure it's not going to come out to see Federerov.
Right.
It's because of the inkling of possibly going,
might have been going to see it.
It's because there were 3,000 red wing fans.
That's why we had that many people.
It's like the Ranger game.
People used to go to see Metzei and people to say that they didn't do this.
They go to see the Rangers and go see Metzei or Lyon.
I mean, he was a hell of a skater.
But I'm just fed up.
That's it.
So I about the election.
I think we should all just re-boat.
Okay.
Thank you.
Now, see this guy is, I mean, his points are well taken.
But the fact is, it would make any difference if we had more history
of our country.
We're sure brought him back to life.
Hordie Howe, Tim Horton, Johnny Bauer, Jacques Plott,
and it would make any difference.
Bobby Howe, Wayne Gretzky, because the people in 99%
have never heard of any of those people.
It's not a hockey town to begin with.
Then you combine that with the fact that you got a boring,
crappy product out there.
And the fact that the public is getting those 50 of us
and really understand the game.
Getting highly agitated with the organization.
And you got to rest a few for disaster for an empty building.
But their thin skin, their uptight, and anybody thinks
that I'm going to go to some kind of a party or some kind of a function
with people like the Murray Brothers,
you're whispering, this is down a dark hole.
I'll say that right now and it's going to happen.
No way.
And the way that they spin these guys, you know something.
Maybe they're nice guys.
David Neil and my crew.
So I don't know.
I mean, I never really need to run.
But you talk about being led and used and manipulated by the organization.
And I've seen this.
This is about the 500 time I've seen it because I get both newspapers.
And you open up both papers and they got the same story lines on the same day
because the organization is putting the words in their mouth.
They're stupid enough to put in the newspaper.
Pedaling to us number 44 today, to which I say, yeah, who you kidding.
There is something wrong with line one by them.
I just mentioned that in passing.
What?
Okay, we'll get calls but they say, you know, I will get calls.
But then you put the thing up there and it doesn't show up in the event.
So there is something screwed up.
Hey, I found it screwed up again.
Duff, I just mentioned that in passing.
That's that you really care, of course.
Yeah, good off this incident.
Where we going? Here's a mobile in Miami B.
Hello?
Yeah, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How can anybody be taken with selection lightly?
I don't understand it.
What do you mean by that?
Yeah, it's different.
I'm not the plastic. I'm pissed off.
Yeah.
I mean, you got to deal with President Moron for the next four years.
Yeah.
They're already having a whole saying that he's being kept at praise once a day about what's going on.
Well, he's got a lot of video games to play and a lot of nasty things.
Well, he's got a nice thing hold between it so they can put the ring in.
Yeah.
Here's the Moron.
He's being handled by the same people that handle Lee Harvey Oswald.
I don't get it.
Oh, my God.
I have a great line for that, but I'm not going to use it.
But anyway, George liked it.
567-0560-0560 on EAT&T.
Now, we don't need the, you know, the, what you call the Secret Service in here.
Tomorrow could be, yeah.
No.
It's going to be Tuesday.
125-560-WDQM.
The Neil Roger Show Sports Radio.
560-QM.
Oh, he's making on.
This is Joe Bowen, the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and you're listening to the Hockey Authority, Neil God.
I've seen the story of a girl who's underpantsin' on the whole world.
And while her butt was fine, it looked like mine because it was kinda hairy and that's gross.
Oh.
How many hairs on her hair?
Certainly more than mine in a beard and I'm gonna face those things here.
It looked like a sheet that hasn't been here.
She had an ass like you, buck up.
Or you're brown on the round of her cheeks.
Needed a razor with a clear.
Or if they shampoo to the hair and it's reek.
But why did I have to see it that day?
And they hear a lot of rags with no money my way.
They hear on the butt of a girl where they didn't okay.
This is the story of a girl who's underpantsin' on the whole world.
And while her butt was fine, it looked like mine because it was kinda hairy and that's gross.
Wreck them.
And that's gross.
That's 30 or 560.
You're just actually having a good idea.
Yeah, let's just start this thing off for four years and we don't have to worry about anymore.
Four more years.
And then you could have another election in November of 2004.
I'll be long gone.
Yeah.
2004, I'll be...
Bye, bye, bye!
Yeah.
Speaking of something assimilating and a lot more than the election.
So his friends don't call him the bathroom guy but maybe they should.
David Brott is your girl-two guy when you gotta go.
He's behind one of the web's more useful sites.
Best toilets.com, which is an in-applies list of best toilets in several major cities.
And now you can get all the information from your internet connected palm or handspring digital assistant when you're on the road.
On Wednesday, a company called Yada Yada, which makes a web browser for Palm Base to organize.
This is announced it's putting this information from VoxSide on its service.
So if you're stuck on a street to San Francisco, you can cross your legs, send a request and have the best bathrooms being back instantly.
Those who prefer to plan ahead can go to their site, download, and print a tour bus company in New York, where we can hand off those visitors.
Vox 37 launched the site in 1997 to learn to build web pages.
An architecture lover, he'd often roam to Manhattan and recently moved to Queens, checking out the buildings.
If you're walking around town, especially in winter, you know where the bathrooms are, he says.
Almost as soon as he put up the site, people started sending me emails recommending their favorite tourlet.
And probably gory holes too.
It says his favorite is the world to know tell in New York, which features a stainless steel urinal slash waterfall.
How do you like that?
Now let me recommend if you're an Amsterdam and believe me, you don't want to go into too many coffee shops or restaurants.
It's just, it's, you feel squeamish about that.
So if you're walking around like that in the middle of the city and you really have to go back,
Barb is on palace hotel on the main floor in the lobby toward the back.
Huh? What are you smiling about? I know where the good tourlets are.
So do they have the troughs? So when they're at regular use?
In addition, no, they got split level.
In addition, which our state or somebody times are walking in, hey, how are you?
They did steal it. I belong there, you know?
They got great public toilets downstairs and three minutes too, on a way out.
I've seen a lot of guys' minutes on the way out.
And then the crash of Porsky will tell off the other end like the dam rack,
the old, or rude of gasoline, got beautiful way toward the back by the Japanese restaurant, by the Edo.
I'm just kidding, I couldn't information for people in Amsterdam who need to have an emergency run.
Always good to know.
Here's a mobile and poor water deal. Hello?
Dale. Yes, sir.
I want to sum your callers a call and then ask them about the Seminole County court hearing.
I'm dumb why it's not in the media spotlight because it doesn't matter.
As a Republican, I can dim what those people did and I hope they go to jail for it.
However, you can't re-certify the election. All they're going to do is hear the case
and determine what's going to happen to those people. They can't go back and re-certify based on what has happened.
True I can. No, they can't.
True I can. What happened in Dave County when they found that all the dead people voted?
The overturned result of the election. They threw out all the absentee ballots and they threw overturned the real election.
They cannot go back and re-certify the election.
Did you hear anything that I just said?
The sad part is...
No, better say. Here's another guy. Here's another Republican. He don't hear anything.
See, I don't care who you support, what your politics are. I'm delighted to have a conversation with anybody as long as it's even almost rational.
But I just love these people who just keep pounding away the long enough matter.
What's the say? It's like they got a hearing problem.
What's the point of trying to have a conversation with somebody that's just made up his mind?
And don't confuse him with the facts. You're a perfect Bushman. Don't confuse him with the facts.
Here's another West Palm Beach. Hello.
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I'm not on a mobile. This is Jim.
Here's a stationery in West Palm. Yeah, I just got back to my hands today. Really?
Yeah, I got back to my hands today. Is there anything in those good toilets?
No, I was staying away from the toilets. But I went to the coffee shop. Yeah.
It was a great place. It is. Yeah, I stayed there almost a month and I want to recommend anybody who's got the opportunity to go and go over there.
Absolutely. I'm a long time listener. 20 years. First time I listened to you.
You had some guy who was living out in the Everglades claiming he had a touch watch out there.
Uh-huh. You remember that? No. I didn't think you did.
Anyway, I've been listening to you a long time. My state is on the head of the crop.
You know the street I'm talking about? No. It's got two boxes of central stations.
It starts there and then it does the loop around the canal. Right. What was the hotel?
I didn't have a hotel. I stayed in a, at least to the park. Oh, great.
Yeah. It's a nice way to go. It's a great place to go. Well, let me ask you something.
How did you find the apartment to stay in for a month?
I had a friend who sort of arranged it. You know, there are people there who, that's their business.
You know, they released apartments. Right. And that's what they did. Actually, I was there about six weeks.
Uh-huh. So, let me go. You got to pay. But if you're standing in the hotel, you're paying it anyway.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's much because I have an apartment that I rent you around now.
But it's about as big as a boom. I had a great one. It was a big one.
You know, it caught me, you know, caught me about five or six around a month.
Uh-huh. So, I mean, it's rather expensive, but I had a nice big one.
You know, the street. I can't, you know, I can't speak that.
Right. Heron starts with an H. Now, you know, the street, but I'll be sure.
What you're telling me you stay in the, you go, well, I have an apartment now, but you also,
they used to stay at the, uh, Barbra's on Palazzo, which is right across from Central Station.
Yeah. Yeah. I know what the bar was on is. I was probably, uh, six, maybe six,
maybe a half a mile from, uh, the barbies. Right. If you go to chance, I went to the physical therapist downstairs.
The young lady named Marie and, uh, you know, she looks on your back.
This is a legitimate physical therapist at the Barbra's on Palazzo. Yes. That's what's down in the basement. Right.
And then Marie, I recommend it. Okay. That's a great hotel. It is a great hotel.
But you do much like, you know, I don't do well in hotels that I'm going to stay there. No, I agree with you.
What street did you get through a button lock? It's near the, uh, prison garage.
Okay. You know what prison car is with? What member? Maybe I don't want to ask you to buy that.
I'm not going to tell you. No, no, no. Is it near Central Station? No. Okay. You're down. I'm south of, uh, about a 20-minute walk from Central Station.
So you have four, four stops on the tram. So, okay, I am one stop from the tram south of Central Station. Uh-huh.
But if you go one block over from pension cut, that's a hand cut. Okay. So anyway, that's where I was.
I was at a great place. Uh, in fact, I stayed on, uh, when it, Princeton, yeah,
I was at a print of cash as one block over here. There was just a big mafia killing there. I don't know. When was the last time you were there?
I just got back a couple weeks ago about 10 days ago.
Were you there when they, uh, you the savvy of mafia?
I've noted the three people in the, uh, no, I was there when they had the shooting, which almost never happened there.
But I didn't meet about the, who they were. It was the mafia. You were sloppy. You were the mafia here.
Yeah. But you know, there's a, you know, uh, one of the guys came in with a mask on like a monkey.
That was in a jewelry store, wasn't it? No, it was in a, uh, within the, uh, the restaurant just, you know, five minutes from the Barbizon or Central Station.
Uh, I think it's a Japanese restaurant. I think around.
Well, I don't know how to Japanese restaurants anyway.
Now, I'll probably happen again in about 20 years there. Yeah.
Okay. I've had a great time, pal. Okay. I'll see you on the root of assolume. Bye. Bye.
That was pretty exciting for the audience, one. No, but I liked it.
Well, I don't, I don't care. I mean, if these people want to be so perocular, they want to worry about slower door.
I mean, go right ahead.
Yeah, I keep trying to tell you people, get out of plane and go somewhere, find the real world.
Be like Columbus in reverse. The problem with Columbus was he was going in the wrong direction.
That was the problem.
He was looking for the real world. He should go a little bit north.
22 before it too, at 5. 60 WDQS.
He's transmitting the foil for us.
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Yeah.
There we go.
Hey, y'all. My name is Chris. For you, Dean Thomas.
Francis Bush is nominee for the Supreme Court.
And you know, there's not some people who's out there that think, just off.
I spoke to little man Wada when I said, got it.
Yeah, there's nothing but an enjoy.
I'm going to be on the Supreme Court.
Yeah, I got the money.
Let's do this quick and get out of here.
I want to catch you all straight.
When I stop reviewing the law, I don't just review the law.
There you are.
I've been talking and I've been talking to the chief.
I've been talking to the web and I've been talking to the web.
Why not look up to the day of the kind of unspared.
Oh, I've been talking.
Let's go bird one.
143 and 560.
WQM 560, 705, 60, 05, 60.
When he says that's good, I'm not sure who he's talking about.
I think I have an idea and I won.
Here's Davie. Hello.
Dale.
Yes, sir.
I wish I could afford to go to Amsterdam two men.
Seems like it'd be pretty cool.
It is.
The best I can do is like Costa Rica.
What makes you think it's so much expensive to go to Amsterdam?
It seems like it must be.
I mean, you have to spend a long time in the airplane, right?
Like, about eight hours going over about nine coming back.
Yeah, I mean, it's not that expensive.
No, I'm coach, I would think of that.
I know.
So there are deals on offseason, 560 and a box round trip.
Yeah, that's not so bad.
Not too bad.
Just that you can buy so much for so little when you go to South America.
Oh, yeah.
That's an easy thing.
If you're into those underage hookers, I mean, whatever, of course, the rich here.
I know all about that.
I've heard that.
How's the bug land doing, George?
I'm sorry.
How's the F. Coindell?
What is F. Coindell about the girls in Costa Rica?
That's insane.
Yeah.
Okay, go ahead, sir.
That's all right.
You know, at least this whole issue about the balance is shown that the Republicans are complaining
about a left-wing media or a bunch of liars.
People have actually been bringing up that there's something, like inherently, hypocritical about the Gore campaign.
Benefitting if they chore out the seminal ballots.
And at the same time benefiting if they keep, if we keep the ballots in Dave County,
if there's some sort of a contradiction, what about the contradiction that's about the Republicans fighting both ballots?
Why do you need to keep the ballots in Seminal County?
100 in Polk County.
Exactly.
Not only that, but the ones in Seminal County.
I was asking somebody, who counted those as the ballots in Polk County?
They said, Polk Salad Annie.
Yeah.
And not only that, but the Seminal County ballots were clearly result of fraud.
Right.
It doesn't even exist with respect to, there are no accusations in that regard in Dave County.
And how do you like to be a Republican?
You called me about 10 minutes ago.
It's going to be the solid of that.
It's about how you can't re-certify.
You can't change that.
Yeah, he's a liar.
I mean, you're just making it up as it goes along.
So in other words, if we discover fraudulent votes, it's kind of like saying,
well, too late we got you.
I mean, there was really bad, but too late.
Right.
I mean, the point is that if it's the right thing to do with the count all the votes,
the count all the votes.
If the right thing to do is the count only the legal votes, you can't read those votes in Seminal County.
How would we expect the Bush people to hell a lot more if they would just be honest and say,
look, we still have fair and square, which is I've been saying, we still have fair and square,
and we got you.
And that's it.
Now let's wrap it up.
At least I would respect it.
It would be a little bit honest.
But a big problem, I think, Neil, is that nobody talks about how good the critical it is for the Republicans.
To be making both of these arguments, but they talk a lot about, they talk a lot about going that regard.
Because what about this guy from Conor County, who allegedly is from Conor County,
who's filed a suit there.
They're hearing them at two o'clock this afternoon, the Florida Supreme Court,
who's filing a lawsuit to claim that hand recounts are illegal, they're unconstitutional,
and yet they just finished with a hand recount in Texas under a by-run,
requested by Republican candidate who lost under a law signed by George Bush three years ago.
Yeah, the Republicans are just trying to mug things up and down and down.
Whenever it's convenient, they love dimples, hand recounts, whenever it's good for them.
But when it's good for the other side, it's unconstitutional, we're going to fight it.
I mean, who the hell are they?
If they lose the ballot box, you know what they're going to do, don't you?
They're going to start, they're going to put in their own guy,
because they've got the Florida list.
You got it, and his brother.
What a sham that is.
And his brother's girlfriend.
Exactly.
Okay, good luck to us.
Thank you, and a plan.
I'll see you on the plane.
I'll see you on the road to Vaseline,
where the people may be a little bit rude, but at least they understand what life is all about.
Even in Canada, they got a much better grasp on it, and what life is all about too.
Much better.
They're light years ahead of us.
Hey?
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
By the way, if you heard Ted Davis say something earlier this morning,
if you thought he didn't say that.
No, I forgot to mention that.
If you heard Ted Davis say, he didn't really say that.
I was doing Ted Davis voice.
Here's Miami, hello.
Yes, I need to.
Yes, sir.
Uncle Leo, if Bush becomes president, we can call him.
Maybe how much alcohol he can cough up when he's a dam, and he gets into the arena.
Also, the whiskey is right around the corner.
Yeah, the whole world wish they were Democrats.
Okay, whatever you said, anybody know what he said?
No, the chair was pretty similar.
The chair gripped me for about five seconds.
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T, and it provides a wireless line.
I just, I don't talk football in the chair, but I will say this.
You got to admit that dolphins this year, nobody expected anything from them.
They want that great job.
Jay Feidler, good Jewish boy, tremendous job.
Nobody gave them any credit, nobody anticipated anything, and you know something.
They're 10 and 3.
They're kicking ass.
Not just when they're kicking ass, and nobody's talking about it.
I don't know, they're all talking about the BCS pool.
They have 20 that three years.
That's the mentality.
That's the level of this town.
More, it's sophomore, college sports.
Only about a college football.
I take that back because they don't care about college basketball.
College football.
That's as far as they grow.
But beyond that, they can't deal with it, which is kind of sad.
And you know something, so if a couple players would break their legs,
they can play anyway.
At a boy day, we don't care if they're injured or not.
But we want to be winning.
Yeah, I'm kind of shocked a bit.
I listen to some of these sports shows very briefly.
And they're talking crap.
And they got this phenomenal team that just by winning a goddamn Super Bowl
or at least go through it.
And it's like, I would've cared about that.
How about them teens?
The teens.
That's more of the alley of this town.

There's sticking with it.
Here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, ma'am.
In living supports your argument, did you happen to read about how the Republicans are asking
for a hand recount in the Mexico vote and they're using the same argument?
I thought they already assuredified in Mexico.
Well, they're using the same arguments for manual recounts that chorus lawyers are using
in floor.
Absolutely correct.
I think this illustrates the height, the absolute height of the top receipt of Republicans.
And then you know something, if they could have found, because believe me, they examined
it and they talked to the people in Iowa and Wisconsin, if they could have found that
they were close enough that they had a chance of pulling off windows in those states,
they were looking on the same thing there.
Absolutely.
Well, in closing, Neil, I say God save a thought and get rid of the electoral college.
Amen.
And pay for paper ballots.
Okay.
No more paper ballots.
Why are they all that guy before that Republican?
I mean, why is it that most Republicans need mental health?
What is the problem with him?
Currenoid and delusional.
Oh, we don't want those computer things because then they'll be able to trace back and find
out who I voted for.
Oh, I guess if I voted for who he voted for, I'd be pretty embarrassed about it too.
I don't want to mention no names.
Here's the lady mobile and four buyers.
Hello?
Hi, Neil.
Yes, ma'am.
Hi, this.
Great.
Yeah, I turned in when you were talking about nerds and half-naked people.
Yeah.
What were you talking about?
Nerds and half-naked people.
Yeah, something about its TV.
No, no, I said that I was talking about the fact that the public wants to see shows with
a good-looking, scantily-clad people and the producers that shows this country haven't
figured that out yet.
Oh, I thought you were talking about putting all the stuff from the election on TV.
Make it, yeah.
People don't want to see this out, God.
But we sure don't want to see these candidates make it.
Oh, God.
Oh, no, no.
I can't.
I can't put it turned on while I can't do it.
The boys, and that's pretty wack.
Oh, you must be desperate.
You must be desperate.
You did that.
No, I'm truly, truly.
I'm totally hot and I think I need therapy.
But you know what?
I got a little ophthalmologist.
Hey, wait.
I was wrapped in my ass off though when there were guys from the guy that helped develop
the vodamatic design.
Did you see it?
Yes, I saw.
Oh, my God.
Wasn't that brilliant?
It was pathetic.
No, but the cost examination, I loved it.
I was like, his answers were pathetic.
I know, but I was calling my kids and come on.
They're having fun.
They're having fun.
Yeah.
But anyway.
And what was it?
Oh, see you on.
What do you say about Amsterdam?
See you on what avenue?
The Ru de Vaseline.
I love you.
Okay, here.
Five.
They wore more trots.
That's the name of the street, but it's common to call the Ru de Vaseline.
That's because our girl's team leaves her Vaseline on the Ru de Valle and whatever it
is.
Hey, he leaves her a trail.
I think it's Vaseline.
I don't want to say.
I don't want to know.
No, actually, my luck in November, they were like tearing up because one thing about
that, I'm like here, here they do all construction in the middle of the season.
Well, it's obviously off season in November and when the weather is bad.
It's supposed to be here.
So, there's no...
