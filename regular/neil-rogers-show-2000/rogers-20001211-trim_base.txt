After 12 days of counting, this is what we have
12,000 pistolful hearts, 11 butterfly ballads
Distant franchise voters, nine guys counting each vote
Captain Harris's makeup, seven pending lawsuits
Six freaking recounts, 25 electoral polls
Four simple chats, three disputes in counties
Two guys want to win, but only one can be trashed
That's trashed
Silence, heart, deadly heart
He can't tell your nose apart
You can't hear me, but he can tell
The stomachs are lifted by that awful sound
What the hell did you believe?
It knows just right what he did
Silence, heart, deadly heart
I just wanted to take heart
I watched a woman's sex swim along
She was very considerable from
I walked right out of that play
It's a face I love my day
Silence, heart, deadly heart
You can't explain it
Silence, heart, deadly heart
You can't tell your nose apart
I just wanted to take heart
I just wanted to take heart
If you're in church when you do
You have to stay in your church
Silence, heart, deadly heart
You have to stay in your church when you do
I want to know who cuts the genius
Well, here we are again
Boys and girls, pick it up where we left off
I'm getting that, I don't know about you
I'm getting nauseous from this
I can't stand it anymore, I can't deal with it
Get it over with already
Ah!
Yeah, good, got on buddy
Left here at 2.15, he said he would hang till about 2.15 to 2.00 on Friday
Look like it was all over with
And then all of a sudden Saturday morning
All on guess what?
There are going to be recounting the votes
Yeah, 4 o'clock on Friday afternoon
Just an hour and a half after we thought it was all over with
Oh yeah, let's just have a countenagant
And they're all screwing around
And they're sitting around
They're holding the stuff up in the air
And they're looking with chads
And they're looking at holes and all this other bull cramp
And then Saturday like what the hell fam is it around?
Noontime 1245 something like that
Well the US Supreme Court says they're not too happy with this
Because it's getting a little bit too tight
And now let's cut the crap
Cut counting the votes and cut the crap
And so we have more oral arguments
And more anal arguments
At 11 o'clock this morning in front of the US Supreme Court
The US Supreme Court, 2 S's in the air course
Here's a big thing
And are we going to be carrying that?
No, they're going to have the recordings
We're going to get a 1230
I'm going to pass this time
I'm not no way
If you want to hear it go someplace else
That's my best advice to you
No chance
If you want to hear more anal arguments good luck to you
I'm not going to waste now and a half of this
Very, very important show
Especially on a Monday putting that crap on here
Even though it would be a good way to get out
Yeah, probably could leave here at 1230
Big piece in yesterday's sunset
And all floaters flawed election process
Yeah, cracks result in breakdown
Floaters antiquated decentralized election process
Needs an overhaul
Well no shmit
Huh?
What a bulletin
This is a way to have a goddamn election
Put it out
See this is what happens with the media
I've been talking to this for a long time
They brainwashed the public into believing
That actually we're going to have a real outcome
Well regardless of what happens
I say what's wrong with having a ceremonial present
For the next four years
I mean that's all he's going to be
Ceremony or president bush
Figurehead
Phase of the matter
What is this ribbon cutter
Oh speaking of that
George had a great appearance on Saturday
The bill side was done there in Miami again
Down in the
Whatever was no speaking in Glacetown
And the help done there
It's got up good thinking they're getting more creative each time
Next time it'll be a lot better
I have to tell many people they have show up there
He said be I
That's exactly about nine
But the help instead of just taking one sandwich
And thanks again to our good close friends from
Whatever it is Atlantic City, Subz and Hollywood
Instead of just coming to take in one sandwich at a time
Which you don't want to like put it all up in your arms
It's kind of advice that way
Yeah that's right I have to keep them back over and over again
But this time when you steal one of the QAM frisbees
And then you can you turn it over and use it as a like a tray
And you can put a whole bunch of sandwiches in there
And they don't have to keep coming back and be embarrassed
You know associating with us
Or there's no embarrassment fact for that
I'm sure of that
One of the people asked what station we were from
As they were holding one of the frisbees
Loading it up with sandwich
Right
No it doesn't you know the call letters
They don't care about
Don't confuse them in the fact
I've had the deal like that
I know what are you guys doing here
What are you doing
All in fact member rich I don't want to say where
No I know
I remember
Yeah
What are you guys doing here
What are you doing
So this is all about spin reveal
Spin reveal
Come on spin reveal
What do I get?
Spin reveal
Wow
Well we had over 1,200 people participating in our democratic
A crappic survey over the weekend
It was just all we got to go to that
And what
I was going to vote over the weekend
I got
Because uh
If you don't think I can vote on
All right see
Oh that's true
Well there's senator snatch from Utah
He said
The phone about
Yeah get out of here
Blow it out your ass
You will fascist piece of crap
So anyway I'm not going to go through the results here
But the suffice to say
2554
Still gigantic
Still big
We'll still be getting that bonus
Uh huh
It's part of the crappie numbers
18 to 24
We had quite a battle going on between
The Spanic males 18 to 24
And non-Hispanic males 18 to 24
75 Julios and 79 Julios
Of 18 to 24
I'm not so sure I believe some of those numbers in there
But that's okay
It's just for fun anyway
It has a much more important poll for today
And I changed the
C.I.E. Scratched off the one I originally had
I'm getting tired of asking polls about this
God damn election already
I don't know about you
But I'm getting real
Real sick and tired of it
It's like a hobby again
Like a hobby for people with no lives
Like O.J. and A.L.I.
Here's another guy, Dema Hobby
I'm sick of this hobby
Just like I'm sick of going to those stupid hockey games
And seeing them lose every game
And then opening up the sports page
Like the heraldous morning
And David J. Schfarts are right in the stupid
Stupid
Stupid
Eddie out of column
Katz Murray feels the fans pain
Oh jesus
jesus Louise
Or is our key bunker when we need him
Oh jesus
Yeah that was one of the favorite things
You used to say
I don't know where he said that
I'd use Alice
Alice
Edith
Well Alice was uh
I had jesus with my line
Oh she did too by the way
I love her
See she the good uh the
Audrey Meadows
The good meadow she
Well I want to go through the hole
Custy down and he's still dead
It's just getting really ponderous
And then we can't blame the crowd
We had a good crowd over 15,000 people there on Saturday
With great expectations
And again was a little bit better than they had
But you know what they still lost
And it's getting really old
Just like the election
Getting the order and stale
Just like Patrick Leahy from Vermont
I'm not sure that
Yeah
Here's that poor question today
Who are the cheapest people
Jews
French Canadians
Or Cubans
Although the only reason I did this pull
Is because he told me about the Cubans
Yeah
That showed up
With the luxurious car
And all the jewelry hanging from every part of her body
And wanted to discount on the CDs
We're getting into the Jewish down
Oh I mean uh Cubans
We're Cubans now
We're giving you a discount
Get it up for now
Yeah, we'll give you a discount on that on Charmin
Bitch
So that's a good pull question
What was that?
Wrong number
Was that a mistake?
Yeah
Who was it?
I don't know
Oh that's good
Just people wandering around in the building
Who are the cheapest people
Jews
French Canadians
Or Cubans
That's tough
Yeah, it's up to the front
That's a good pull
We do good pull on this show
Other than the demographic one
Which is right
I've got a very interesting
Well it's uh
We don't care where there was interesting for you
It's just out of curiosity
We found out we have very few Asians
But we had a whole bunch of Asians out there
The last survey we took
I think those raw phony votes are of the lifestyle
Very very few Asians
The person
10 past 10 at 560 WQM
No question the program maybe we produced
Without the express written permission of WQM
No, no, no
The process has group incorporate
It just keeps getting bigger

How the gorge
Stole Christmas
Mr. Gorge
Why are you stalling me a lesson?
Why
There's more ballots that must be counted
Than new lieu
If they're not
I'll just cry
Blue lieu
The sick Democrat lied
He made up a story
If he passed a detotion
Blamed it or I'm got a new watch
The house on the hill of Mount Cuppet is mine
Your seats in the room
My right is
Desire
He patented the head of the gun of a Bruce
And he knew who was known by any tool
He talked to him dead with us to a dead
And before he left
He dimpled to his Chad
You're a mean one
Mr. Gorge
You're guilty
Are you
You're a soulless politician
Who exhibits bloody
They can't Mr. Gorge
The three words that best describe you
Are as follows
And I quote
Big
That's right
Baby
15 at 5.60 W.C.M
Now this is beautiful
I don't have one call on the board
And you're missing your golden opportunity
Because I'm so fed up with all the selection crap
And crap is the operative word
Crap was the word for all four candidates
Like I said
Gore and the Julie Berman
And Clinton and the guy with it was on the verge of death
Do I say Clinton? I mean, Bush
Whatever the hell it is
I just can't deal with it anymore
And here's your great opportunity today
I'm just going to sit here and listen
If you want to say anything about the election
About the courts, I won't say a word
This may never ever happen again
I'm just going to say like
Even no matter how nauseated and disgusted I am
And then when you're done, thank you
Bye bye
That's it
It's all political
Don't let anybody fool you
You got your floor to Supreme Court
That was all politics
And now you got your US Supreme Court
With a five fascist
That's all political
And that's what it is
That's what it boils down to
Because we don't know how to have a fair election
That's number one
And because number two
We have crappy candidates on both sides
If I try to, you know
Force on me to pick death by
Hanging or death by the electric chair
And that's why I was like the fighter right down the middle
Because it was a brutal choice
It was an unacceptable choice
So we're going to get stuck with the four years
Like I said, of a ceremonial figurehead
So I'm a trouble can that chain you get us into
I mean the bush get us into
5 6 7 0 5 60
Pound 5 60
Here's the mobile in bulk
Hello
Yeah, you're very kind and calling
Bush a figurehead
I mean I think that's sort of
You know, being kind to you anyway
Yeah, Neil
Yeah, yeah, kind of calling Bush a figurehead
You just said that
How much of a force
Well, I didn't know it came true
Anyway, I, but let's not see a lot lately
I've had the pleasure because I'm on the road lot
And you know, so much of what you're saying
I just like you would look forward to the day
That we can open up whatever news there is
And not have the puke over it, you know
Just because your poll today hit me
That's why I put this call in for the poll
About who the cheapest is
There's a little trivia fact for your people
To think about before they vote
Let them think about the difference
Between a French Canadian and a canoe
A canoe will play
Okay fine, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60
On the AT&T and Verizon wireless line
What if I always told you there's nothing
In the world worse, nothing worse than people
Who think that they're funny
And there are
The only thing worse than that is working in a studio
Where there are bugs flying around
Which I know is little tiny nets
Or maybe it's a trigger
Maybe there's a trigger in the wood pie
Do you think?
Yeah, a little bugs flying around in here now
Maybe they had a party in here over the weekend
Maybe the people from Bill Siles brought those sandwiches and hearingate them
And left it spoiling rotten under the counter
Anyway, that was a great first call for the week
How's the poll coming so far
Who are the cheapest people in the world
French Canadians 8, Jews 5 and Cubans none
So you wanted to put the Cubans on it
Just because George met a cheap Cuban bitch
Anybody that could be one in every group
But at least we want to spread it a lot more
But we put about 10
Anyway, I just want to say this to the French Canadians
Because I noticed the hockey game
That we actually didn't have some laundry room before the game
You can hear about them describing the party who get lost
We hate you like poison
Don't you understand
These are the slowest people on the uptake
First of all, I have no idea what you keep coming back
You're for because your money isn't worth the damn thing
I mean, even the English speaking Canadians
They're money ain't worth nothing
But we like them, at least I do
Most of them
But the French Canadians
We hate you like poison
They've been telling that for years
It's not humor
I'm not saying that to be funny
It's not to be sarcastic
It's just honest
We can't stand you
You're disgusting
You walk around around Hollywood beach with those speedos
On with your big fat puppets hanging out
Your cheap you don't tip
You're disgusting nauseating
The way you drive is enough to make even the people down here
Puked their guts out
And believe me, that's saying a lot
Because we got the worst drivers in the world
We can't stand you French Canadians
Go home now
Polly who go one way lost
Get lost
That's right
North or east
Three of these would be good
That's okay
But everything's cheaper over here
Countrymen over there in France
Look at this little buzz
We got nets
We got a chigger in here
Goddamn it
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60
Count 5, 60
On the AT&T and Verizon wireless line
Oh, this could just be
The last day
The last day for all of us
You have no idea how that would please me
Here's Miami
Hello
How you doing, New York?
Okay
Listen, I want to ask you about the Nellis
What's going on with
They said he was switching over to every public in the world
No, he's not
Well, is he getting a position in what, if Bush wins or what?
Yeah, prone
Pown
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60
Count 5, 60 on the AT
I can see we're not going to have any calls
They were just like Christmas music today
It's the 11th of December
It's officially closed
We'll play Hanukkah Karelz and Christmas music
Because these people I'm sure
I've heard this reported that I want to sit here and continue
Call up Sandy Payton and talk about bilingualism
Okay
I am not going to sit here
I keep talking about Dipper Chad
And pimple with all these assholes that are running around with their placards
And screaming and carrying on
Like we have some great choice there
Like one of these candidates is working in all of the stuff about which they're not
It's just not worth it
But because the media continues orchestrating these things
Because there's profit to be milked from it
Naturally, they always got these assholes
I'll look at this
We got your Florida legislature in action
They're singing virtually in New Boralos again
They're beautiful
Here's Dorao
Hello
Good morning, Neil Alia
I'm doing okay
Okay, you know, it's just a couple of points on this whole election thing
I'm just concerned that, you know, as far as the rest of the world looking at us
We tend to say that we have the best system and all this
Is the best we can do is
You know, they're looking at us and laughing at us
We're joking
This is getting to a point where
It's really concerned
And this is the big
Well, how come more people aren't saying that
How come more people are furious over the fact that we don't know how to hear the guy damn election
And then we're doing stuff from out of the stone age
I agree
I mean, we both that we have the best system in the world
And then we put a bunch of idiots out there and no one way
We came and hold an election
And this is going to go on for months
It seems like and we're the laughing stock of the world here
Yeah
So I don't know, I just, it's really gets cut to me
Oh, thank God I live in the Netherlands
It's all I can say
Okay, I'll go with you
Okay, thank you
Let's hear you
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 3
Pound 5, 6, 3
Oh, you're not going to, well, we ought to take a poll
Maybe I'm doing a wrong thing
Maybe they want to hear those analoregiments
What do you think?
No
At 1230, wouldn't they replay it?
No, I'm not going to do it under any,
I don't care if everybody in the audience wants to hear it
I'm not going to do it
Because I know that they don't
It was, you know, it was a novelty the first time
It was the first time we actually had audio
from the USS Supreme Court
And that was interesting
And then I made the mistake
Even put on the float of Supreme Court
Our analoregiments
And the entire audience have vanished at that point
I'm not going to put it on there again
What are they going to say?
It was pretty interesting
Though that David Boyle is replacing the very lackluster
Lawrence Tribe
Huh?
Maybe they thought he was a member of the tribe
That might have been a long way to kick an insass out of there
And they're putting in David Boyle's to try to pull this thing off today
To argue in front of the USS Supreme Court
Maybe they figured the SS Supreme Court
Wouldn't be too sympathetic to a member of the tribe
Here's a model in Miami, hello
There, how's it going, man?
Okay, sir
All right, for all these damn Republicans
These people have voted for Republicans
Good
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh-huh
560, 7.0560
Count 560 on the AT&T in Verizon
Wireless line
Welcome to South Florida
And you wonder why this states the place
Why these counties down here
To wonder if it screwed up the election you wonder
I don't wonder, I know
These people wouldn't know which side was up
If he gave them a head start
There's a model in VOK, hello
Yeah, I know
Yes, sir
Yeah, how you doing?
I have to decide, I want to change this so they
I think once you mentioned you were talking about
Honest racing, you have been
Honest racing stand, you work
Yes
No, I'm not a huge Honest racing stand, I'll tell you what
If you know
Who is the best driver you ever saw
For what kind of a conversation is there
That's like saying, what was the best car you ever drove
What was the best driver you ever saw
Francis over here
Francis over here
Yeah, there you go
Hey, we had a nice couple of nights out there
I was there Friday for the big drivers championships
at the Poppano Park
Nice event boys
Excellent
Had good crowds, handle over a million dollars
Both nights I think
Dave Polone, Luke Wollett
Wollockay Jr., Daniel Dubayne
Our own boys held their own
Maybe they were doing it
Kevin and Wally and Daryl
And whom I would even not
And Brucey
It was great
I see there again
There's an idea of a discussion about Honest racing
Who was the best driver you ever saw
Francis over here
He was a 70 year old man in Michigan
From flushing Michigan
Does he anybody in this audience know who that is
Oh, but he asked me a question
That's my answer
567-0560 and it's an honest answer
Here's a mobile and poker
Hello
Yeah, sir
You just said it perfectly
What other state in the union could cause us to happen except Florida
Among attorneys
Florida has been known for years as a deadbeat state
This comes back from from from the years when when Florida had the lowest per capita income
When it was a
A state full of sunshine
And lots of people they couldn't find jobs
Just wanted to come out lay on the beach came to Florida
Right losers
As a Republican
It's a loser state
I am ashamed
I am ashamed of what my party is doing
It's so bad
That I've actually switched to becoming a to an independent
Okay
Yeah
Because it's it's it's pathetic it's to see
These people
Try to sound sanctimonious
When in fact they're trying to steal the election
It's embarrassed
What do you mean what do you mean they're trying to steal the election
What they're stealing it
Yeah
Why
You got it
You got it in for both credit for job well done
Why not let the votes be counted
We know lose
Let the votes be counted
That's the only fair way
When you have scorea
Who is a
Fervent general
Let me ask you this question
Okay, in all honesty since since you try to make it sound like there's some rational way
To uh, to conclude this thing
How do you really count the votes when you have 67 different counties
And 67 different standards and all these different people
And the photos of being court
Er continue screwing up
Just like when they said okay
Well, you know, we're going to extend the deadline
And they gave them like over the Thanksgiving holiday
To count all the votes and they knew it couldn't be done
Now they do the same thing again. Okay, start to count again
But there's no standard for what's the vote and what's not a vote
Well, how do you do that
The correct
The correct vote
How did I get sucked into this
I'm sorry
I really meant with
Hello
Yeah
The correct way of doing it
Would be to set a deadline for Florida to install
Reliable voting machines
And we vote the whole damn state
You're the whole thing over all right now you're talking let's hear it
Yeah
I said the deadline should be in about like so you know, November 5th 2004
Sounds good. Thank you for plenty of time
We can hold the get some pot luck suffers
Raise the money to be able to not cost a lot of money for that new tech movefangled technology
We can raise the money and buy those new computers
There are more
What's about these are fleas or something in here
What is this besides the toilet? Oh, I'm sorry. Can we have an exterminator coming here?
No
No
26 I think it's an only I think it's another act of God
Said another plague a plague of fleas
Only in the banana republic, baby only in Miami
This holiday season get your gifts at Chick-repe arms
Try our new cholesterol log or the delicious mystery that doubles as a sexual device
Or if you're looking for a bargain try our fruit cake from last year
Guilin teed every bit as good as it ever was
And no one can resist the chick-repe arms
Uncle teed in the shape of Monica Lewinsky
Chick-repe arms the place to shop for people you don't really care about
So thinking of that I got good news and bad news for me anyway the good news is we found a whole bunch more that
Carb solution stuff at publics bought it all out
Everyone every last bottle the bad news is
Got through another great and perfect and Friday
Went to the track Friday night I drank two bottles of that stuff or that was my supper
Got on the scale on Saturday morning and I had lost by four and a half pounds it all came back supper
What
You said supper supper and what about it? I've heard you say supper before
Then you used to make fun of people that said supper
That's why I said it. Oh, okay
Cheezess Christ what the hell did they do to you in that place on Saturday? Oh, you have no idea man
And then he went and got some stale cigars from some of all those railing and was trying to speak Cuban to him
But at any rate not Spanish Kima and they'll look at it another broad just flew up in my face here
What I hold these things coming from you look the bottom with you there knowing yeah, I brought them with me right in your pocket. Yeah
Well
Peace out so anyway
Our good up Saturday morning. You didn't hear what I just said the wait all came back
Yeah, I heard it. I had gone through this tremendous week. You saw you were witnessed at least during the show
I ate like maybe two meals during the entire week nothing
Lost four and a half to five pounds got up Saturday morning and it all came back
I
Realized there's a lot of fat in that stuff, but I mean let's get serious and isn't that can always pedaling this a BS about fat
Doesn't make any difference and now all these other low carb that oh fat. There's not words at it's those carbohydrates those killer carbs
And I'm depressed about it
So I guess the only answer is to get back on the treadmill and the bike
Get that metabolism going because I have a feeling mom. No, it's seriously my metabolism is so slow
That if I did did just rank water if I just went on a fast for 10 days. I still wouldn't lose anyway
I just mentioned that in passing so that our sales department doesn't feel so bad about how inept they are that they didn't the come up with any of that stuff for me
And then Gary sauna comes in here. You're a close personal friend Gary sauna
You're far business orthodox due friend Gary sauna who you'll be sucking up at the Christmas party tonight with
Comes in here. What do you know? What do I know that? How do you know? I'll be sucking around with it. You were sucking around with him this morning
I'm cordial with no you were cordial you were sucking his Jewish ass okay, and he's just like do Lieberman
He's not just Jewish. He's another one of those
They kosher the house. He's like yeah, he's
He was handing out some anti-Palestinian propaganda after I did that Israeli show. I'm sure of that
At any rate
So he comes in here wants me to a petal the rankings food stuff. Am I gonna do that? No, of course not. It's a crazy person
So you don't confuse ourselves the problem with credibility because they have no idea what the word means
And even as far as the cops solution stuff it may not help you lose weight, but it tastes great
No, at least it tastes good. Isn't that the part of the school of ice cream isn't that something? No, and you don't need a big school of ice cream the stuff is delicious
Here's a mobile and steward hello
Yes, people that call you and tell you that they're Republicans and they're gonna change the independent
First of all, we hope they do that because that'll just help us out more
Also, no Republican was upset with push did he really didn't do anything?
I mean whether you like the guy or not he doesn't vote they counted the votes
He was ahead they recounted him he was ahead no matter how many times they count him he's ahead. Yeah
Yeah, no team winning any sport would call up and say I know

Here's a mobile in the Fort Lauderdale. Hello
Hey guy. How you doing? All right. Hey listen, um, I have like a few opinions like on why we have this
You have a few opinion like okay, um basically when buddy McKay was ticked the senator
He wasn't the strongest candidate
When it was taken to be senator
And it seems to make George Bush maybe he was the strongest candidate
But there was a lot of the people that should have been like five grand
Florida would have a better shot than Al Gore and I think we're in this position
We're in now because we just didn't have the right players and okay wrong players there we go with that ball game stuff again
Call up the sports shows okay to be delighted here that we had the wrong players like the panthers
The wrong players thank you sir
Like I said, I'll sit here and listen and go um, I maybe even once a while ago
In between trying to kill these damn little bugs must have a whole crap load of these
I don't know what I'm wasting my time trying to kill him for we must have 10,000 them in here
But of course we wouldn't want to get an exterminator in here because then that might actually cause great some money
Unless maybe we could trade it out since we got tradeouts for everything else in the world on the wrong at Christmas time

I'm a Jew
I'm only you
On Chris man
On a car is life for why is it
The set of sets of my house every year

All the bubble might see is all the time
And thanks to Robert at Power 96
One of our sales holes over there
Give us a check for 100 bucks for plan period
Thank you sir God bless America
How do you like that?
From Power 96 no less
Did most of our people come up with a check for plan period?
No
Did our sales department come up with a check for us?
No
Not that I want to embarrass our humiliate them
Or tell you what a bunch of cheap factors they are
Or how little help they give to our closeness
That was since we've been here
But that's just the way they are
Here's somebody that's got a great column by Marine Dowd
About the thing about what a pair of assholes
Basically what she's boiling it down to
Is what a pair of assholes we got running for president
Thank you very much
But don't anybody waste any more of our facts paper
With articles about this because like I'm trying to tell you desperately
I'm burned out I don't care
I just don't
In fact I want it to be over with
I want it over today
Get the oral arguments over
Get the anal arguments
Try them out there tonight Mr. Wooden stick
And just try to zass out and let them give us concession speech
And we'll survive okay
Enough is enough already
We know the election was stolen
We know he really wanted but who cares at this point
There's no way to prove it
You've got to hand it to one one thing
All those Republican themes this time
They did tremendous job
They threw up so much crap in so many different places
That they made it impossible
I've gone out there, Jeb
And your girlfriend too while you're at it
The secretary of Bush
How's the poll coming?
See the good part of this is we don't have any French Canadians in the audience
Now see that's good so all the Jews like me
We're voting for the French Canadians
Although, see I can only judge Jews being cheap by myself
Am I cheap? No
No way
I'm on the most generous Sun, I'm on the most gullible, I mean generous people
You'll ever find
So all those stereotypes that's just part of the whole business of anti-Semitism
The people like Georgia are always spreading around
But anyway even George thinks the French Canadians are cheaper what is outside it
That's quite an indictment if even a virulent anti-Semite like George says that
55 for the French Canadians
24 for the Jews only 10 for the Cubans
Who are the cheapest people in the fricking world
Here's the rabie, Jebel
Go over to the other side
Mobile in Miami, hello
Hello? Yes sir
You know I feel the same way you do
I don't care who gets in the white house
What I do care about is upholding the Constitution
Because the Constitution will be around before them, after them
You know
And they've messed up my portfolio
Yeah
You know
I thought my portfolio was all messed up too, I thought it was matured to do it
You know what? I'm going to tell you something else
If one of them really cared about the country they would have stepped down a month ago
Yeah
Well it makes you think either one of them cares about the country
That I'll look at about is ego
I would rather have someone off the street who's a small businessman run the country
You got it man
Some small business man like Bill Gates
No I'm talking about you, Neil Roger for President
No thanks, or V Gates
567, 0560, 0560, 0560, I think I'm getting bitten by these damn bugs
And then of course this is the best
Bluff comes in here during the last commercial break and he's very concerned about the bug problem we got
Get off this instant
And I said well you know I never worked in a fricking radio station in my life that didn't have an exterminator
And he says all I think it has something to do with the building
That was his exact cruelty
He thinks it has something to do with the building
Yeah
Which is again his way of rationalizing that he works for a cheap prick
To locate us in exterminator coming here and for once a month
Remember at IOD we always had an exterminator
Whether it was the Cox IOD or the Pax IOD
Any radio station
Of course the KAT we want to have an exterminator because there were so many old people listening and working in a place
Exterminate we just not about well we didn't like the word
Here's Margate hello
Hi I have a question
Yes sir
I've had a problem with 560 with the marketing department for about two weeks now
I've had a problem with them for about three and a half years
Well you're going to laugh because I know you can get to the bottom of it
There's a book that you guys promote
It's two lines that will improve your repertoire
No one knows the name of it, no one knows the author of it
Wait a minute two lines that will improve your repertoire
Yes sir I mean it's actually funny
It's a book I wanted to buy for my wife for Christmas
And it's I've called the marketing department I've called the marketing department
What did you hear about that?
It's a commercial I've thought every single day on a on a Chubby show or a worst team
And I never get that I never get that they don't say the author and they don't say the title
So I've called the 305 number because this guy John I talked to a few times when I called 560
And he's like oh man just called the call the department
No one called me back for two weeks
Well of course not we don't want the audience to know
The same thing they won't give us the list of the numbers for their responses
People call George every day all day long
What's the name of that so and so what's the name of this place
What's the number of that restaurant and they won't give us the numbers
Well it's funny because I talked to my my long-haired friend Jeff Cohen the other day
And he told me he said yeah he said man I've heard it a couple times
Yeah
So I didn't say so often it's kind of nothing
So who will I call if I call the 305 number again again I'll have a review
What do you call the answer is I have no idea
So I get that way
So you have to sit there again get a cassette recorder out on paper one of the shows
Oh that's horrible I actually love your show and I hate bush and gourd
Okay good luck to you sir I mean I could lie to this guy and I'm going to
I could be embarrassed about if I work here and I take their money so I can be too embarrassed
They just don't care don't you understand
These I keep trying to tell these people I think I'm making a fun of it
I think it's a joke
The people who run this place and the people in the sales department don't care about that
All they want is the money from the sponsors that's all they want
They're not interested in the results they're not interested in giving you people the number
They address the information that isn't part of their job
So I must have had some goal thinking they might help me even even just find a way to get a whole bunch of that car
Of solution stuff even if I was willing to pay for it even retail for quite a lot
Because that's got nothing to do with making them any money
Even though of course it would have been a great sponsor
But it's got nothing to do with making them any money
So how the hell can I have the girl I think they're going to be involved with that
There are people out there going oh he's got to be kidding
No I'm not kidding
Here's a mobile and West Palm Beach hello
Yes sir
And let them run your holidays and stay in a good mood
You wouldn't believe how many of these foolish Republicans that I've spoken to
And they told me that they definitely
5.670560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line
Wasn't that clever?
That was real cute
Here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale, hello
Oh yes here, okay
You know, a meal
I used to do going to listen to some remarks and I think I liked it I'm very nervous
I can't talk
But as much as we despise Republicans they hate us just as much
They'd like to if they could shoot our group
5.670560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line
I have just when you think you've heard it all
When you think you've heard every stupid idiotic comment that you could possibly hear
And then she gets on her phone
Even the guy that was on before her was better
I mean, isn't there anybody out there with an IQ larger than their dim thumbnail?
Is there anybody out there that's got anything in their brain in this town?
Hello, and I bet on 25 years that I'm still I was gonna question
And you wonder why Florida screw up the election?
Florida could screw up a wet dream that's got a dim state
5.670560.560
of the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line
Here's a call and four Myers, hello
Neil how you doing?
Listen I was just gonna comment about what you were talking about a couple weeks ago
With you were talking about the mugwumps versus us
And I think that's the way you got to treat it
I mean it's basically look at the states like you said who voted for this guy
I mean we're talking about nine from the upper Midwest
And I'm proud of those people I'm proud of the people of Michigan, of Wisconsin, Minnesota
Yeah well we don't have the name law again
But I mean I'm just saying that those I wouldn't be that proud
You know it's not like we're talking about voting for somebody that's all that great
No I agree he may not be worth defending but the fact of the matter is who's the worst of the two
I mean don't you agree?
Yes
The way I look at it is like you said there's a I have what's called the trickle down theory
States where Dick Trickle is very popular are usually mugwumps states
So you're in one of them?
I'll tell you I thought that Florida, South Florida, the red necks were just in telehathy
This is like the dukes of hands are meets the steppered wives here
Yeah
This is horrifying
At least at least I'm sorry to look good though
Thanks a lot
Okay I have a rate to it
Well that's a testimony real fast
5.6705 see well it's true at least he looked good
I mean you know most of the mugwumps they don't look good, they don't smell too good
Here's a call from Miami, hello
They're a bad name
Yes
You want to hear some quick and few talk about play of me that want about Rudolph
The red nose rain there was sting dragon in the snow
You know that song that Christmas song you played about Rudolph
You said you want a Christmas song
I said you play about it
I said I wanted Christmas songs
Yeah at the beginning you should add one of I'd like to play Christmas songs today
And forget about this election president
Yeah
And I agree with this
You know dancing and dancing and dancing and dancing and fixing
Come it's the cutest sonner in Britain
What do you recall
The most famous raiding of all
Most well hung reindeer
Had a very lazy hoes
And when he got excited
It stuck out way past his nose
All of the other reindeer
Wanted what it's let wouldn't go
Turns out that Rudy's organ was getting stuck in the snow
Then one fucking Christmas scene with the Santa tune to say
Rudolph with your tooth alone
Won't you drive me home alone
All of the reindeer hate him
He's the favorite one because
Rudolph the well hung reindeer
Get to bang Mrs. Roy
I tell you what really is the assimilating about all his business
And they keep bringing the same desperate tired old people on
The former clerk to adjust the Scalia
And the former clerk to adjust this Kennedy
And here's Paul the Gallaghan
And here's this
Oh God
This seems like it's been going on for 100 years
Doesn't it?
It's been going on forever
The same old tired toll saying the same old predictable tired crap
How could anybody possibly endure it
I can't
But I sure hope you're having a good time with it

Last time didn't work so clearly rehabilitation
So much for rehabilitation
So much for rehabilitation
You know I'm looking at this Bob Hubard on the phone
People keep faxing me stuff and I tell you to stop faxing me
I'm not interested in going in a way
Spasked about this selection
But Bob Hubard from the New York Times does have an interesting term
He uses he calls this selection
They float a fiasco
I saw Bob as usual
And here's another one that almost has interest enough to read it
But I won't
Coral conspirators by covering Bush's post campaign
Is what politics is usual
The media are complicit in his attempt at theft
And media is sick and they talk bad
From the Boston Phoenix by a dead in Kinsey
Well I'm not going to read it on here
Stop wasting our fax paper
I don't care anymore don't you understand?
Here's some really bad news
National Airlines files bankruptcy
Oh!
National Airlines is seeking protection from creditors under chapter 11 of US bankruptcy laws
And reorganizes its business
The airline blamed its financial troubles on rising fuel costs
But they said its service will not be interrupted
Said they'd lost biggest-based airline
What a shame
Did a pretty good job
On July 27th the company weighed national headlines
When a 22-year-old man got under flight at JFK
And New York put a gun to a pilot's head
And began a five-hour standoff
I didn't know that was on national
Maybe thought he was on American
And wanted to know where the hand grenades were
National Office Service to Chicago Midway
Downloads for worth L.A. Miam in New York
New work rather
New York for the welfare of San Francisco Washington, BC
Two Chicago Hairskates will begin January 25th
How do you like that?
In September the company had its two-minute passenger
But they got real problems, they got tourists
5,670,560,050,560
Oh that's right, look at that
The oral argument to the needle argument to going on right now is we speak
They're not on the ear
And they will be releasing the audio tapes at 1230
Are we going to play those audio tapes?
No!
Just keep mentioning that over and over again
So if anybody feels let down
Don't just keep sticking with the needle 1230
Expect I'm going to put that stuff on the ear again
Because what's the point?
What's the use?
You've heard all the arguments before
The fix is already in
So what's the point of going through that exercise again?
I was thinking good air time
Then we can be sitting here
And keep giving the phone numbers again and again
Here's Helen Dale, hello
Hey, how are you doing?
Okay
I was just wondering if I was going to tell you
I'm quite excited about that lightning conspiracy going on over there
The two are going
And I'd like to tell you
We should be thinking about other things like
I really go out and pot and
I think that's better if I were calling the other one
Yeah, well, there are a question of bush gets in
You got a good chance for that
Just like if Gilbert had gotten in, huh?
5.670560
Pound 560 on the AT&T
And Verizon wireless lines
Out of town line like over on a West Coast
Well, we actually didn't have it like a real collar this morning
Do you notice that?
Like somebody who actually spoke like a living and breathing human being
877-785-6345
I mean, we've only had the line about two years now
And we finally actually got like a living and breathing person from four buyers today
Right
See, something's going to happen all right, it's not even noon yet
Here's Sunrise, hello
Yeah, Dale, how are you doing?
Okay
Good, I just want to let you know that I'm a big fan of listening for a while
And also I'm an excriminator, so if you need me over there, I can come
Okay
That's all I have today
Okay, thanks
And they keep sending me more articles on this fax machine
Here's what about the dimpled election
And here's what about the pimple election?
Not interested
See, of course we got no calls now because the audience thinks that we're going to keep talking about this
Just like after the early on thing, finally, when we reached the point that there was absolutely nothing left to say
Like how about the second day of it?
And it was like you had to start all over again
And go back to square one and start from scratch because you had a one-dimensional bunch of people
Just like that bitch that called earlier that I had a dump that's talking about a bullcrab
Here's a mobile and cruel spring, hello
Hey, have you ever heard the Chinese song from the five Rivers album?
Let me ask you something, do you have like a hobby?
Sir
What?
F-
That was great!
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T
And Verizon, if you ever call the show before like in the last five minutes, don't call me again, okay?
I'm just trying to flush out at the end of the year we're trying to like flush things out
Like all these bugs around this toilet that we're working in here
When it doubt flush them out
That's my New Year's resolution
My New Year's resolution was I was going to lose a lot of weight and this was going to be the time
Is it the time?
No
Well I got to do blood tests this afternoon and Gary's going to suck some blood out
So I can't eat anything now
But you just get to the point where you're ready to give up, you know?
I thought I had an award-winning stellar week last week, I was very proud of myself
Get on the scale on Saturday morning
There it is, and of course they say well you know water waiting it
But I mean how much water?
And I'm peeing like a racehorse, you know?
That's supposed to be the key, it's the pee
Like a racehorse, your peeing your brains out
You figure out I'm going to get on the scale tomorrow morning and get another two or three pounds
Guess what?
Wrong
So my 849,000th diet is in the crap we're getting
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello?
Yeah
Yes sir
Hi, how you doing?
Okay
I would like to hear at 1230 those tapes
Yeah
You will kill an hour for lunch for you
Yeah
Why do you want to hear it?
I'm a big time busier with a supporter and I bought it for him
And you want?
You bought it for him?
No, I'll tell you what, after you learn to speak the language, come back and learn about it
He bought it for him
567-0560, pound 560 on the 18th
Oh, and the answer you're requesting?
No, we're not going to put it on
Absolutely, positively no under any circumstances
No, the answer is 9
Net, net, net
Eight minutes after 11 at 560 WQM
From all these productions comes the cutest little Arabs you've ever seen
Erifetz, Abdullah, Jerusalem, and Little Jericho, 102 Palestinians
This time the wicked Kurella Barak is trying to separate all the little Palestinians from their happy West Bay homes
It's one explosive situation after another with all those Palestinians scrambling for cover
Don't miss Walt Disney's newest animated feature, 102 Palestinians
Now showing in theaters everywhere
Oh!
Come on, it's after a lot of the 560 WQM Happy Monday, Happy Holidays to all of you from our very upbeat Neil Rogers show here
We don't give a crap on any of this
You want a little piece of philosophy for you, even though most of you aren't going to buy any of it, but I don't care
Because I keep telling you the truth for 25 years and most of you aren't buying it anyway
Although a little portion of your brain is a little message and they're saying you know he's right
But you just don't want to deal with it because you've been so brainwashed
And the fact is that if I were to do a talk show I would have to be paying like one million of the attention to any of this that I've been paying
But I have to do it, or I've had to do it for the last several weeks because this is all that's been going on
And preoccupied people that's all they care about
But the fact is that most of us, it's just like the thing with Barak yesterday
They're hawking the China with Barak, he's resigning in Israel
And we're supposed to be all worried, do you like care about that?
No!
No!
No!
The philosophy lesson is don't get yourself all wound up, don't get your shorts into a goddamn thing
All wrapped up around your ass because the things that really don't affect your life
And people tend to do that because the media, as I've kept telling you, they lead you by the nose
They tell you what's important, where you're supposed to get all whipped up about
This isn't important, any more than alien was important
Oh yeah, but it's about the next way, yeah right
They're all a bunch of themes, they're going to spend your money like it's come out of a faucet somewhere
And it doesn't make a hell's worth of difference because they both suck
But the Supreme Court hearings underway right now, they have an oral argument, they have an anal argument
Right as we speak, clearance Thomas is in the back of the room smoking a big fat one
That's right, and that's why he never asked any questions because he's preoccupied
He'd be smoking and talking in the back of the room, clearance be Thomas
He'd be doing it
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello
Yeah?
Yes sir
Yeah, those cops, Lucien bars are really good, I went to a pub, and they had one left
So then I called that the company that whose number was on the bar
Right
They told me they're available at Walmart, Target and Kmart
Really?
Yeah, I went to the local Kmart, the shelves were full
And I didn't go to Target or Walmart, but I'm sure that their shelves are full as well
And then that was for cheaper than that then public does
Oh do they?
Yes they do
And also, I sent you that the non-toxic ant baits, some time ago, Uncle Albert
And if you want dust control, then you're placed non-toxic dust control
Yeah
They will get rid of whatever you got there
Yes, that's the way I do, I'm getting tired of slapping bugs here
And you put the, put me on with Georgia, I'll arrange it
Okay, thanks, hang on
Okay
So there's the good news, the cops solutions, even though you may not lose anyway, but at least it tastes good
And maybe you will lose weight with it
Delicious stuff
Here's a mobile in West Palm, hello
Hello
Yes sir
How you doing?
All right
Okay
Listen
Everybody's blaming us for for really in the down here, that's all our fault, but we didn't cause
Is you're right, the media caused this, direct the post
But, push it, go or fight it
Okay, great, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60
On the 18t and don't confuse Alaska with the facts because obviously it wouldn't do any good
Like talking to a rock
Florida can't do anything right sir
We can't, we don't know how to do anything right
We don't know how to make a ballot right, we know we're in the stone age
And now all of a sudden the newspapers after all of this mess, after all this embarrassment
We're too out to be used to buy now, after all of this
Oh, I guess what, it's our cake and our motor not dated and something needs to be done about it
Wow, thanks so much for the great job you did ahead of time
Not
Punch card ballots
Here's Miami, hello
I do now, okay
And you say you don't want to talk about the election, I just want to, you know, I was watching one of these magazines
Show you the last night and they had this professor on that said he's here discovered a way, you know, to read
Brain waves for people
Nice job, that
You get that?
Yeah
And it's been introduced to Congress, by this Republican Senator Grassley I think
Yeah
And he's going to try to find a way to, you know, make it where you can use it in a criminal case
I mean that sounds like big brother to me, you know, I even afford somebody to watch that screen
When they close their eyes and they don't want to do it, what are you going to take their eyes over
And you can stop them up with the toothpicks like in Clockwork Orange, that's right
You know, I'm going to be, I say the first person we ought to check that brain wave fingerprint thing on his OJ
I mean, please, I'm a harder gun, I mean, it's issues there that's got to be discussed
I just sounds too much like big brother to me
Yeah, like a reading in your mind
All right, thanks
Okay, I have a great head, I did see that, pretty interesting
Let's strap OJ up and see if we can read his mind
Or let's just strap him up anyway
And just leave him there before we pull the switch
Can you imagine how long that line would be?
560.560.560 on the AT&T InfoWireless Line
Out of townline is open 877-785-6345
Bill Schneider is on the RNCN going
Ratering authority, if you want
Yeah, huh?
Here's Pine Quest, hello
Hey, how are you doing?
Okay
Just a couple of things
The punch cards are definitely archaic
We need to change them and I got a couple of ideas
Of course, he's talked about the APM type voting machines
Which I agree with
In fact, the good news is Hillsborough County
The ounces, while they were doing well through all the baloney on Saturday
When the vote counting was getting organized before they cut them off at the pass
They're going to go to all touch screens in Hillsborough County before the next election
Right, which actually they need to do nationwide
Right
Have a national day off for voting
Right
Have the Eastern time zone vote from 10am to 8pm
The Pacific time zone vote from 7am to 5pm
And at one time we'll know who the president is
And eliminate all this
Oh well, the Pacific coast makes a decision of what happens on the East Coast
And that's my idea, I don't know what to think
What makes a lot of sense?
Yeah
So it probably won't do it
Oh no, it makes too much sense
Okay, thanks
All right, have a great holiday
And you too
Yeah, see that does make sense
When does it complicated?
But of course, when you do things in a way that makes it make sure that it's accurate
And that it's fair and that it's equitable
Then you can't see elections like what's going on right now
And then Mrs. Upwater plans just like Cassio said
Then Mrs. Upwater my plans
Can you get them off the hook for all time's sake?
No
Can't do it, Sally
And don't call me Sally by the way
Yeah, that would have been a great line in there, don't call me Sally
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 5, 60 on the AT&T and VerizonWalk
Let's just play the audio from the Godfather for four hours
Be a lot more entertaining talking about this damn election crap
I'll tear that right now
God almighty
And of course you do realize that if the Democrat said any brains who a little bit of
Called in the street in the South
Don't call you
Exactly, but they didn't do it
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 50, 05, 60 on the AT&T line
Our 10 minutes from now they're going to be playing the audio tapes of the Supreme Court oral and evil arguments
You want to hear those?
Not going to have it here on the show
You know what we have to do?
We have to pull a bait and switch and just put it right on there
What do you think?
Here's a Mabel and Fort Lauderdale, hello
Yeah, I know
Okay, you have a great article from the bottom globe
Yeah
This was about the Canadian election right?
This was a little Saturday before the Canadian election?
Uh-huh
You know they had this guy named the Doc Weld-Dage running for a...
No
Okay, well the Canadian broadcasting broke this story
Now, it's paragraph
A conservative upstart who hopes to become a dragon's player in Canadians now
The national elections on Monday
Instead, finds himself being swayed for refuse
He believed that dinosaurs once ruled the earth
He's a fundamentalist Christian
But the Canadians have real press in their country
And they made him explain that they lost the election for it
It's right here
The dinosaurs became an issue at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in Diggie
So if we hadn't media-elected that, they would go out to bush police and the same stuff these guys
What do you know?
It's got to be right here
He said, if dinosaurs strode the earth, they did it anything
They were with Adam and Eve
So when the meet-tree came across as a moderate just like George Bush
But the Canadian broadcasting corporation had the balls to make him say that they lost the election
Right
George Bush, please put the same crap in there
Do you have any Canadians who talked about the election on your show?
No
This guy was a real right-wing nut
I know that
I don't need to talk to Canadians about it
I read in the Toronto Papers all the time
But it shows if our meeting was like there in my view
Okay, thank you
That's the eight-time he said that
Isn't that the eight-time he said it?
That's the 24th time I agree with you, sir
But how many times can you say the same thing?
How many times can you see these same boring people on MSNBC and CNBC and CNN
and FoxBanks' network?
How many times can you see those same boring people on there?
Before you finally start winging from it already
Before you finally start puking out meals the eight-twenty-five weeks ago
God
So what did you just say?
No, Amy, he's got a great point
I think what he was trying to say was
The media is sick and need help, Patrick
But Jesus Christpal, have a nice day, eh?
Here's Miami, hello
Hello, Neil
Yes, sir
Hi, Neil, I'm not going to talk about the election
I just want to say there's no staggs in the church
Yeah
Okay, great, thank you
5670, what are you looking at me like that for?
This is what you've got out there
These are very creative clever people
This is the South Florida audience
The same people you and I have been talking to for a hundred years now
And this is their material
Don't you understand it?
Yeah, okay, good
So you're going to tell that thing?
I'll think about it
We'll play it by ear
As Ross Peroll used to say
We'll play it by ears
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello
Yeah
Yes, sir
Let me tell you something
With those five sashes on the Supreme Court did Saturday
It's unacceptable, unconscionable
They stopped the hand count
Which was the most equitable for the hand job, yeah
The most equitable solution for this election
Okay, we will finally find out who won the election
No, we would
No, we would
No, we would not
We would not have found out who the election was
We would not
We would not
By what standards
We would not find what standards
By the standards
Oh, take two Tylenol and two mill-pounder calm down
Stop whining
Who the hell wants to hear people like that?
I'm getting odd to do just from the south of his voice
Not to mention the fact he makes no sense whatsoever
They're counting dimples in brow
But they're not counting dimples in plummage
Let me say it again to you
As soon as I'm at a who you voted for
No matter who you're pulling at for
The fact is
This is not the way to hold a God damn election
Don't you understand that sir?
No
No, he's still talking probably
He's still whining
Your whining is getting on my nerves sir
You're hysterical, you're psychotic
And like I keep trying to tell you
There was no God damn dimes
Where the difference between either one of these candidates
Between the four of them
A plague on both their houses
That's what I said before the election
And now I got lulled in a going there and voting
And thinking I was doing something worthwhile
And got sucked up into this whole damn thing
I'm just even two or two thousand four
I'm voting for him
Just before I get on the plane
I'm leaving my absentee ballot
Here's a mobile in pompino
Hello
God
Neil?
Yes sir
There we go good
The fact that the rest of the country
Is able to vote normally
And the fact that Florida
The incompetence down here
Just finding the decent mechanic is a miracle
Finding a real doctor
Finding a real anything down here
It's always like looking for a needle in a haystack
This is a land of its cracks
It's going to get in glasses last week
And the lenses are reversed
How difficult is it to get anything done down here
Right exactly
And the thing is when we're problems with us voting down here
We're all like oh yeah
You know no surprise down here
The rest of the country is a pause
Yeah
It's unbelievable
I'm going to say it again
The entire state of New York
With its 17 or 18 million people
Whatever they got
They don't start
They don't close the pause till 9 o'clock
On election night
We closed at seven most of the state
And yet by midnight they had
Every vote counted
They were all finished
Gone to sleep
And we didn't even have one vote
And they counted counted by midnight
Exactly
And someone had a good point
You know they got the dollar machine
Where you put the dollar in
If you didn't read it right
Right
That's it back out
You know that's not difficult
When it's out spit it out
That's right
One last thing
I think you ought to put the Supreme Court
Here and gone from last
We can play it all day
You'll have people turn in
Two minutes
Alright
See you
Okay
That's a good idea
I got the tape
They would know the difference we got the tape
Okay, stay tuned
See is it real or is it Memorax?
Here's Ruth Bayley Ginsburg
She's on the same as she was last week
Yeah, she sounded like she's sucking on a persimmon
That Ruth Bayter Ginsburg
And we're supposed to be big fans of hers
Oh yeah
This is Ruth Bayley again today
I really would rather have Carol O'Connor on there
I think we'd have a chance
Even though it looks like we're going to chop his foot off
He's got the diabetes out of control
Eat it
25 past 11
That's what his problem
Every time he saw something fattening
That's what he do
Eat it
And now they're going to have to chop his foot off baby
Poor Carol O'Connor
What's he going to say about that?
Ah, jeez
Huh?
What are you going to say?
Oh, it was speaking to I.G.
How about ass jeez?
Anybody want to buy some of that for about four bucks a share?
Oh, how about Xerox?
How does that market doing as a matter of fact?
Now, old NASDAQ's up 84
And the Dow, come on, you can do it
Spend the thing there
We want to see this redneck fascist
And the Florida legislature
And the Dow's up 40
See, I'm making money just sitting here
Even if I weren't talking and making money
The meter is running
Why not?
Can't we be just as suffices those right wing fascists
Don't just like the guy that wouldn't give them
Wanted to give me the check after the election
That fascist from Philadelphia
26 after 11 at 560 WQM
But Neil Roger Chow, New Sports Radio
560
QA
And that was Dick in the White House
960
R. Raj
120...
enough
just reply the uh... or argument to disappear in court you just heard
let's hear some more
yeah
i don't know you don't understand the elicit is very important the future of
our democracy hinges on all this you know
yeah
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eight t and t
and Verizon wireless line
here's point and beach hello
yes sir
i agree with you about the candidates
i
i
way back in the summer time i was telling my friends that
the two candidates are cautious
yes and the quality of the process would be a compliment
i i would agree however i do think there is a difference
that should that may be important yeah
and i think it's coming through now
who gets the point
okay well thank you five six seven have a little bit to that fifty million times already
how
you
see what i'm saying this is Florida and you got all these lifeless people out
there that's why this guy he's still saying that i just hung up on he's still
saying it
what difference is it make we already got Heinrich Himmel around there as they
cheek justice we got here among hearing we got Rudolph has what difference is it
make we've got a brown neighbor brown junior
and we got Ruth Bayley Hinsberg
and of course we got the
how come did i ever use that line before how come that just dawned on me
the clearance Thomas on a Supreme Court of the token spartan
you just the token
there we go yeah my name is trans
you gene Thomas transiblish is nominee for the Supreme Court
and you know there's a lot of people that they think just
I spoke to little marijuana when I was in college
and it was another but a pinjoy
maybe singer I know remember y'all
if they don't think i'm fit to be on the Supreme Court
I got the money let's do this quick and get out of here
I want to catch our straight when I stop reviewing the law
I don't just review the law
tell y'all I've been token
and I took it to the east when I took it to the west
and I took it while I look up there the deal kind of is best
I'll be token
let's go bird one y'all
okay there's the token spartan on the U.S. Supreme Court clearance Thomas
twenty-seven before noon at qa I'm there speaking right now they're hucking a tronic
here's what it be some of the they start the votes again
oh
yeah let's start counting again what do you say
now let me ask you this you notice how they had them separated
in all those little boxes they were like shoe boxes they were cut off at the tops
because they had an improvised and they were marked roar bush no vote
whatever
and I'm curious now all the ones that they already went through like they did
four thousand of them in date and how come nobody's talking about the fact that
after four thousand of them were counted in date that go and the bush actually
picked up forty two votes in date count did you see that
you picked up forty two votes you gain ninety two and go again fifty
out of the first four thousand but of course being creative like they all
out there being really very smart not like freighter the big smart they probably
like Jan and all back together again
here's Cooper City hello yes sir how you doing okay
listen Neil I just wanted to let you know that I'm so upset that the Supreme Court
has decided to stop the hand count yeah it's like for the first time in my life
I realized that all those people who said over the years they listen you're about to
think out you're silly and I'm trying to convince them to yeah yeah go out and vote
you know what they will write yeah it doesn't count all right you know voting is
waste of time you know there's some people who are going to be by getting us to vote
it's by it's forcing us to legitimize an illegitimate system that's what they're doing
right and there's there's no democracy you know we always thought that we really
did have a democracy no we don't have a police day we are police day they they
think they grab the money out of our pockets whether we want to give it or not
and then they flush it down the toilet for all their friends and all their special
work and then we have nothing to say about it you know we think that we got
people studying that's increasing that's on the streets of this country right and
if we really did have democracy the person with the most votes would win right and
and the person with the vote most votes is not we he's just trying to count the
votes down here you know history is going to remember the Republican party as the
party that defeated democracy because if they truly believed in democracy they
would say hey listen our goal has most of the votes here he has
you were doing you were doing real good for bottom in the half there now you're
like you're looking yourself again well he has he has come back in the
real world sir he has come back in the middle of the
election and I will not legitimize your illegitimate system ever again never
never ever again although I will not get an exception like I said I just
lied I will like an exception two years because I will vote against Jeb
Bush if they're running out for the new men junior against Jeb Bush I go for
Alfred five times but other than that I will never ever here is a
cool cables hello and he'll yes sir listen to this show the past few days I was
thinking bring back Greg oh that's a solution yeah okay great thanks
right it five six seven yeah how does he do is still got to say oh still
got the same number bring back Greg oh and all the other winners that people
now have a nice day with Pete this weekend too sir I hope I hope you come
out on top if it gets my drift here's a mobile informer so hey what we got
to do all of the Democrats of vote what are the pieces are still his
girlfriend's piece he still smells the same what is it sir we have to all register
republican so that he was alone next to me here's a mobile in Miami hello
hello yes sir hi how you doing look I want you to think in the banks better get rid
of the Republicans because those machines that count the money are very similar to
the machines that count the votes and you know those machines spit out dollars
that they don't think are dollars and what are we going to do just throw those off
don't I think like I said when it doubts spit it out trust me when I tell you
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t and Verizon
I was like there's great of ancestor and again for the eight billion time
where's Roger Caffack I mean this is this is like a 24 hour non-stop
show it just never never ever ends and they'll come on in the beginning or today
we got really special we're going to have outsee Hastings out again and we're going to have
and it's the same fifteen people on every goddamn network on every show saying
the same goddamn things here's Pat Leahy again here's that Mark Rascal from Montana
again for the eight billion times just in seven o'clock this morning
here's a mobile in Hollywood hello yeah Neil yes sir yeah forget the election for a minute
I'm trying to make some money for you for the charity there I have a small business
I'm a throwback from the WSU end days I'm down here doing some work right I make the
grads at the cheeky hats and it's cheeky hats dealings cheeky hats and the website is
cheeky hats dot net and if anybody orders and mentions they listen to this on IOD now if you're
a person I'm not I'm we're not IOD I'm sorry that's why I was listening to you from the
you know they mentioned it from this radio station well what is this you box
huh well some of it here's the here that I should adopt the whole thing here's a guy that's
probably talking his website his dot whatever it is and if there anybody orders his
cheeky hat whatever the hell that thing was he'll donate 250 bucks can you believe
and he doesn't even know what station he's listening to so we're going to carry that
audio five six so let's see what's on line three give him off of there give him off
give him off send him away go save somebody go save a life Dave the cop don't ever call
me again okay you're killing me you're killing the show you're killing yourself you're
killing America go away go away don't go away mad go away
oh when I looked down there and saw Dave the cop didn't use call like two days ago again
yeah but that was a main I don't care where he is I don't give a crap if he's in our
space if he's on your penis go away Dave the cop five six seven oh five 60 pound
five 60 on the 18t and Verizon wireless line 21 to noon at five 60 WC what's your
name of that station again five six feet
you way out
I'm dreaming of a white neighbor just like the ones I used to know
where the ones were trim and cars had rents so very long ago
I'm dreaming of a white neighbor with every fossil sign I invite
pay your days be very and bright
and may all of you live forever be white
so Saturday morning we're watching this display going on up there in
Health World County and they're doing their using this software now from Dave County
to separate the other boats and on my stomach I didn't take the other boats and
separate them originally and put them on other envelopes they like put them all
together again you see that and so they're using the new software and what it does is it
puts the cards back in there and when it comes across one that doesn't register the
machine stops and they have to manually pull it out okay and I said you know I'm
really wondering what the deal is because if the chads fell off any of the
under votes whether we're just hanging before they weren't counted now the
machine is going to like push them on through they're not counting them again
keep in mind but they're going to push them on through so the number of
under votes will be different than what they were looking and just as I finished
saying that the woman the supervisor of election from Hillsboro came on and
said oh I wonder when I saw you people in the media and the people from both
parties don't be confused because I just want to alert you now that it will be
probably a different number of under votes because she explained just what I
just said just what I had just said like seconds before so the idea that this
process was going to give us a real number if his ludicrous is the whole the
whole way floated in the first place as his ludicrous is the idea that bush won the
state but the horse was already out of the barn see that was the problem and I
have people trying to rectify it with a totally unacceptable or remedy it wasn't
acceptable because they could never come up with the right number and this is what
happens when you have paper freaking ballots and hanging chads and pregnant
chads and subjective votes and wished for votes oh yeah I think that one looks
pretty good what he said yeah that's good enough this is somebody's idea of
having a goddamn election and like I said before thank God it's not really that
important five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18 to the time I
got twenty five thousand open lines here we're waiting on you they're still
talking here they're talking to twelve thirty so there's not a damn thing anybody's
going to tell you they can have a good on there from now until hell freezes over
and she's still not going to tell you a damn thing until it's all over and then
they're going to play the tapes and you know what and there's still not going to
know anything because that was supposed to go back on pin needles again like we were on
Friday again am I going back into that mode no no I rather go on the come mode then back into that
mode here's a mobile and four-water deal hello yeah I need yes sir hi I think I
might have the answer on how they can fix the technology not to see her in Florida
but all over the country I know it's it's not practical financially for them to
put a terminal for everybody single person to vote in but if they got some sort of a
ticket reader like when you give the store to see your ticket at the jet
way and they didn't hand it back to you and that way if it doesn't go through right
they make you go to the end of the line they kind of cash out on your way out of
the voting place they have an instant number at the end of the voting day because it all
get down low to the immediately and networks wouldn't be stuck to having the pre-fork
we wouldn't have no why do they have to do that well we already have the technology
would be a touch screen whether what's wrong with that well I'm just saying I think the
touch screen is to have every voter use one of those that might be too expensive to have one of those
why why well I'm just saying that they're if they cry poverty on being too technical
for uh... it's a little bit supposed to be then important then why can't we find the
money we find the money for everything else
i agree with you i'm i'm coming up with the second answer when they didn't say they
don't have the money if we had one reader per station and everybody had to wait
long to check out i say i say let them find the money and get it right
i i'm with you but i'm just i'm going after the second uh... the second
report of what we don't have the money for the first let me say again let's find
a money into a right
yeah i felt like a dog chasing his tailer didn't forget to few seconds
there the money is there the money is there okay if we can find money if we can find
hundreds of millions of dollars to build empty arenas that nobody's going to
for ball games that we can certainly find a few billion dollars around the country
so that we can have the latest technology to get it right
so that instead of going through an embarrassment a disgrace like this
and have all these partisan political
frauds these dan judges with their black robes making political decisions in the
name of what is supposed to be interpreting the law instead of that let's get
it right and let's get rid of the infertile electoral college once and for
all and stop making excuses for because it's not acceptable
in fact that they'll be a great bumper figure states don't like president
people do yeah what's wrong with that concept well
oh i forgot to turn american
here's for a lot of the whole new yes sir i want you to help me with my
thinking here okay i'll try i've often thought the supreme court was the
biggest weakness in our system because they're they're not elected they're
appointed by partisan presidents and they can take for life they pride for
life yes and they can take any case they want to make a reject in the
case they want and they're the ultimate authority yeah and so what we come
down to now is assistant like the Vatican has the the Pope points the bishops
and only the bishops can vote uh-huh that's a Vatican system yeah am I right
or wrong about that yeah well in fact i see some smoke coming out right now
look at that the smoke pouring out of the chimney five six seven oh five
sixty five of course we all know what's making the smoke over there in the
Vatican the pubs pubs down amen he gets the really good stuff the primo
stuff in fact even an answer to them somebody was telling me that this last time
I was over there they said that they'd have better grade weed but the Pope gets
it all imported the Vatican yeah they got a bunch of little else over there
wrapping it off shipping it off to the Vatican five six seven oh five sixty
pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line here's the call from
somewhere hello
Neil yes sir okay this is mobile candle here's a mobile candle hey you say your
board of the elections to have I think it's his circle just over the week and I
thought three things that really made me laugh number one you know that guy
Stewart Taylor who's the car is bonnet for time or newsweek or something he's really
good yeah first of all you got thousands of people saying the only way to really
results to count the votes Stewart Taylor saying that in um for our county and
the other county would find four votes right so that all right all right
secondly the miniherald the week ago said that if we counted all the over votes in
the state of Florida go or would win by twenty three thousand yeah but if we just
counted over votes under votes rather go or would also win then when the Florida
Supreme Court said we should actually have the vote on Saturday the hell comes
out the front page story Saturday yeah Bush saying Bush is going to win right so I
mean they're just for a baloney and then Sunday I need to press another
system so another funny moment on Sunday I need to press the first time ever
saw David boys speechless was when Tim Roberts said to him did you know that
when they stopped counting the votes that Bush had picked up about fifty votes in
the county forty three and he said there he said there like I hadn't heard that yeah
okay how can he not heard that russard had to tell him that three times yeah I was
totally dumbfounded yeah but if you remember I called last week and I said that
after they recount they county that door will only pick up 150 votes remember I was
counting that and then he said the reason being when they started when they started
recounting day county they started with the lowest number counties there's
no I'm not going to do a whole thing again please please I will only point I'm
going to please I won't say at the point I'm making is this when they start
recounting day county from this point on Bush's numbers are going to keep going
higher so for anybody that doesn't understand that you have to explain it then
okay okay no he said that the precinct numbers keep going to go higher and that they
still and it said I don't want to do I run a period no I want to say it's like that
no I mean he was right so what's the point so but I mean he was closing in other
places in voting five Republican counties were picked up like whatever was 58 votes
it was very very close and they still appear in square and they managed to
intimidate the audience parties and keep them from voting and disqualify them from
voting and get all those phony baloney ballot applications in there and they
still and this is what people can't deal with as they saw it still in front of
their eyes but it's too late now you can't get it back don't you understand it
was still and there are no laws they're going to let you get it back it's not going to
happen or gee well it's way close maybe a few more of you had voted like the
poll we took one day last week I figured what the percentage was but certainly
enough of a percentage just from this audience if those people are going out
there and voted and they would have voted the same proportion that most of this
audience was for more than he would have won the guy damn election of course if they
could have got them counted but they probably would have thrown those out too
when they thrown them out yeah well it's a nice thought see this guy he wanted
to start I mean he's right he's got a very valid point he knows what he's talking
about but but the problem is he wanted to repeat the whole thing again just
now I tell you you're endurance out there must be either you're a lot more
bored than I am with life or your endurance must be your capacity for bull
crap must be far more than mine is because I just I can't deal with anymore but it's
ridiculous on the face of it it's ludicrous well if the chance fell off during
accounting then the under votes are going to be a different number they're going
to be fewer under votes here and what about when they go counting them back on
machine again to see if maybe they were real vote because if a vote if a
child fell off there must be there was a vote on there oh well we don't know
let's get that statistician on here again let's put him on in fact let's
put him up before the Supreme Court I guarantee he'd craft his pants can you
imagine them all running out he wants that smell all running out of the chamber
that guy he was like had his head on his chin on his hand he was like
sweating and squaring him you know what I'm talking about the Democratic
statistician four minutes before noon at five sixty WQM

the tubal matter yeah but uh... you know about the day county guy i think she
says smart uh... if he's trying to evaluate the bush would win with the
uh... under vote count and uh... what are they afraid of
no that that's not the point but he doesn't have a valid point that in
day county that the
only talking about finding six hundred votes that they were dreaming
yeah with a pipe dream well but then let's count
and at the chat falls off that it becomes what's called a lost vote
well yeah and
they anyway
that's a lot of the course call the last word great
like lost in space uh... and with with that bush not a given given bush a
hard time that the snowboy game a hard time about not having cable it is
rangel
the less you know the better
very exactly
okay well for us to know the better in the safer we are that we are to be really
safe
i feel so safe five six seven oh five sixty pop up to us he james baker that's
oh my skin crawls when i see that son of a bitch
and you notice every time he comes on
he's more mean spirited in the previous time that i had a just uh...
this can't wait to turn you into a lampshade
five six seven oh five sixty five sixty only eight p and t he flies and
wireless line out of town line for the atari universe and this great is
undergoing
well
She's swinging it.
877-785-6345.
That's our toll free number for the world.
Yeah, Tom Zick and I are stupid lettering
in the TV book of the Sunset on the Yesterday.
From somebody from Rochester, no less.
Some Hick from Rochester, who gives a song and an answer
about, oh, there used to be such interesting local talk
programs out there.
And he's been here eight months and scoured the dial
and can't find one.
So Tom's response is, well, that's because companies
like ClearChannel buy up all of your stations
and they put a bunch of canned, dedicated shows
on it, and so on.
Tom feels to realize that what those so-called
interesting talk programs went out with
Nickers and High Button Shoes.
That's where you fail to recognize Tom.
And I know there are people out there saying,
well, you know, Neil, if you would do like a more
like you used to do, a more serious intellectual show
that didn't have better colors.
I know why you'd do a more serious intellectual show.
That's not what I want.
I want to have a little bit of fun here on the radio
for our Zivane.
You give people a few labs, help them survive
through four hours in this God-for-second place,
and then I'm doing a service.
I'm doing a real public service then.
And so if we have to suffer over the fact
we got a lot of more on's out there.
We like to hear bodily sound.
That's just the way it goes.
Nothing I can do about it.
I listen to the colors on those other shows,
including George's girlfriend.
I listen to those colors.
Oh my God.
She's got the old people I was screaming about last week
that I didn't want to talk to.
Their grandparents are the ones that call her.
Oh my God.
I can't even get my thumb on it.
Hello Andy.
It's so right to this old thing in the jail.
Oh man.
Oh I still do respect her for telling the cops
people to blow it up their ass.
I'll never forget that.
Nice call, Andy.
That's right.
She had the big pair.
She had a big fat pair of balls
and she tore them to you
because she knew they were screwing her over.
And they were.
And she was one of the few people
I've ever encountered in this business
who just besides me
was talking to stick away the moon don't shine.
Have a nice day, Randy.
Here's a mobile in Weston, hello.
Neil.
Yes sir.
How you doing, man?
OK.
I got an idea for you.
Why don't we have the next election
and have the candidates go up to the Supreme Court?
They can ask him about your questions
and they can decide for us.
That's a good idea.
And then we save all these money as well.
And I tell you one thing,
whichever one brings the good weed
to Clarence Thomas, that's the one
it's going to get in.
Make no mistake about that.
Oh!
And then that would be against the book.
5, 6, 7, 05, maybe that's what she's,
maybe she's smoking a little
in the back with Clarence too, huh?
Oh, I still think it's time
for what she's sucking on the person.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 5, 60 on the AT&T line.
Here's a mobile in vocal, hello.
Neil.
Yes sir.
I'm glad to hear you say you want to show
a full of laugh because if that's laugh,
I'd always stand for the most serious
intellectual issues.
Yeah.
2 points.
Number one, to get a question related for a moment, I think.
One of the issues that's doing the most time
to this country is the lack of term limits in Congress.
Because I think the founding fathers
intended for people to go to the Congress for two years,
where there were doctors, lawyers,
barbers, even talk show hosts.
And then go home.
Yeah.
What we have now are these icons of power.
Career politics and building next to power
that is correct.
Right.
Corruption.
Empires.
Right.
Now, second point.
Just like college football coach,
you're same thing.
Team is in your house.
That's right.
Now, the flower water wouldn't
should be more tested by the flower water.
First, you found out that a new year's or a friend of yours
won 20, 30, 40, $50,000.
Instead of having these idiots in Colorhazze
spend hundreds of millions telling
this to buy the flower water.
Right.
Thank you.
And let me know when you win.
Thank you.
OK.
You're welcome.
Yeah.
Why can't we have a lot more winners
instead of people who all this pie in the sky?
Why don't we do that?
In fact, let's just have a lottery.
Let's have a special like that.
What do they call that powerball thing?
Why can't we do that and raise the money
to have real voting machines with TouchCode?
She's the only one that's supervising there in Hillsboro
County.
I got to give her credit.
She said, this is the last time we're doing this.
We're going to be installing to the brand new technology
in the TouchCard, the new touch screens, and that's it.
And have real elections.
Now, for a bunch of those pickers up there in Tampa,
which is Hillsboro County, if they can do it,
then how come they'll be down here and start?
And I'm going to tell you a lot of reasons
that we can't do it down here.
Fuck, that was.
Because they got an asshole like David Leahy
is the supervisor of the commission's election supervisor
in Dade.
And you know what they say about him.
He's an asshole.
Did you see him up there in Colorhazze?
He was there.
And they were asking them different questions about they.
Where did the Dade votes were being analyzed?
They said, oh, well, I was in love to be involved in that.
I was, he was just standing around there,
pretending that he was somehow looking
up for our best interests.
Or as I was now, we'll say, inners.
This is the problem because you got in.
Of course, who the hell wants to have?
Oh, look at this.
I just picked up my pen and the bug flew out of that guy
damn thing.
Jesus Christ.
You know what I think these bugs came from?
When he brought me my paycheck this morning.
I think that yeah, from the Beasley Bank account.
This flew out of the envelope.
Yeah, they flew out of the envelope.
That's where they all came from.
5670560.560.
I don't want to say the Beasley's are cheaper,
but God, or that Greg Reid is full of crap, or that he's cheap.
Oh, thanks for the dollar for playing
parent-of-grag.
You prick.
9 minutes after noon at 560 WDQF.
The Neil Rogers Show Sports Radio 560.
These are not huge.
Thank you, George.
There's no need to fear.
The undervotes are here.
Hey, Tensota, it's all the way from Poppy County.
It's from Beethoven.
Other hearing's underway.
Tensota, where once a recount of the answer,
Oh, what's the answer, oh, what's the answer, oh?
5 to G.
Oh, let it go.
The problem counts the ones that didn't.
The customers are coming.
Oh, what's the answer, oh?
So, I'm going to factor it on 560 WQF.
Did I mention about Terry Murray?
He's an asshole.
And that's stupid article David Ginny,
oh, he's another one.
He's an asshole.
Also, what a suck, much of suck clothes we got in this town.
That's what enables a lot of people like Terry Murray
to keep their jobs.
He won a long since have raised their hand and said,
should I be fired by now?
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Mobile in Miami.
Going runs.
Going twice.
And I was going to let that corner decide whether we should
cure the thing at 1230 or not.
But they're gone.
Here's a mobile in Stuart.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
No, I read Linda Green has this morning.
She's the columnist that follows the court all year round.
Not just doing stuff like this.
Yeah.
She made a really interesting point.
I think that nobody thought about.
Here it is.
If it goes five to four, it's exactly the way most people think
it will.
This will be the very, very first time in history where the Supreme
Court justice, who he's wearing in a new president, was directly
responsible, one-on-one, for putting him in there.
And behind him, he's going to have eight Supreme Court
justiceists who are absolutely in disagreement,
as to the way this thing should come out.
Further, the Supreme Court justice is going to be in effect,
helping the point all new conservatives to the court.
My virtue of his what he's doing today, if he goes that way.
Yeah.
That's kind of an industry point, actually, I think.
Yeah.
I'm a disgusting, but interesting.
Yeah.
Okay.
You're a lot of practice with that arm.
You know, that arm up in the air, that 45 degree angle practice makes perfect.
Yeah, you got it.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
See you, Kyle.
5670560.
Pound 567018T and Verizon Wireless Lines.
This is Galea, man.
Let's go.
What a, what a, oh, God.
He's an answer.
Another one.
God, there's like an epidemic of this going around.
5670560.
Pound 567018T and Verizon Wireless Lines.
Here's a mobile-informed water deal.
Hello?
Yeah, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Good morning.
How you doing?
Okay.
Listen, I've heard you've sat there for 12 years.
And I'm watching a lot of people, having a lot of problems with depression.
I'm watching a lot of people calling people like Scalia and Rangwick were faster.
And I'm probably like most of our city audiences sit back and laugh so, yeah, that means sure.
It's a funny guy.
But I'm going to tell you something, afterwards, Leo put this opinion.
I mean, if I was aware of my steep, though, when I was driving down the road, I probably would ran to a lake.
you know i still can't believe what he's basically saying that all well
George w's gonna be in there no matter what the voters think or anybody else
they're not you're getting it
and he's sitting all of the time i get to get all well you know me also joking
as part of a strict or whatever it is but i really can't and and and and
and then on Sunday morning the uh... pocket heads are trying to rationalize
rank with my thing well he's the most conservative he might be uh...
he might be a swing header so i think that's a state right
and i'm saying that you know right now you can't get it down
okay and i'm gonna get something out
this is probably your time not mine
what was the rationalization of not all of any term limits for president
what was the rationalization for right what a congress
amended constitution thing that the of that there is no rationalization they
just want to and then we don't want an emperor
yeah but people want to do it
i don't argue don't argue with me i'm not the one that decided that just
Tony what the rationalization was
okay so what if you get a little too far to the congress of to amend the
object yes
not that i'm not gonna happen not gonna happen
all right good luck to a calm down little hyper you know every time he
calls that time we're more than he's not gonna make it to go just come down
a little bit
just knock it down a couple of the and that's just
five six seven five six seven
i feel about that about myself today you know
that's one of the thing about this year after i talked to people every day
for four hours
i feel so much better about myself in my life
in my whole outlook on everything
what do you know why are wired about what the home what is not it's not that
big of a deal pal
just a year gonna look at those boots
that i can buy that for your hip
now let's see which side of the bar where we're gonna be on all that's right
okay let's go to uh... my name is a cello
deal yes sir you know what i can see what everybody's fighting about
i mean
big about it or when to get him i mean
if you look at it either one of them
same smith
right how could it make a difference smells pretty much the same but to different
flavors of parts exactly right
i'll tell you that we can figure out who really wanted to let you we are at
that well later be president
that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that
by summer Красable
complimented
five six seven except fifty ounce five sixty
squares insulation incident the state or nearly with the plane
here are five in a sim card
we're we good here's uh... market housing
yes sir
if you go the good thing we need a good slap in the face that we're gonna
you're getting it and uh... we're getting what we deserve
uh...
this last call up to a certain degree i agree with him
uh... the real problem is we don't have anybody of quality running for
president on either side but why not
the most i think i don't demand there must not be enough practice anymore
we don't demand it
you know we have to sit back you know the economy is doing well everybody's
doing fairly well so nobody really cares nobody gets involved and then when
somebody in self-requited all we go get up in arms with a nobody blame but
ourselves
with this is this is a selection
we'll be the drive the right now to get a lot of blame i blame the democratic
party and i blame the republican party that's why blame
i want to put the party because they both suck they both put forward the
the show the political hacks that they want to put up there so they can get
everything that they want out of them and the rest of us uh... we have no choice
no but we say it's all right now we'll well the only choices we got it during the
primaries need to be the last time somebody good rendering the primaries please
don't tell me john McCain i mean what was the last time the party at a real
qualified great candidate in the primaries
uh... i think i could get a number in my lifetime exactly but uh...
the changes will have to come from the grassroots you know no question about it

if we heard a real loud bang just before we got takeoff
and the captain came on
and said it was a blown tire
that they could have told back in
they could have picked it but don't worry that they call the phantasmus just to be on the safe side
so now there's an engine blown
and now they said that there will be another plane in about two hours from
Washington they get to Vegas

of the court justice and then in school year work for law firms connected to the
case john school he accepted a position with the mime based firm greenberg
greenberg trowel gun of other seven greenberg trowel there the attorneys for i
would do worth it i think i'm pretty sure the next day very richer the partner in the firm said he was called about
representing bush and florida a second son in Eugene school he is a partner in the
Washington office of Gibson Dunn and Croucher the firm representing bush in the supreme court argument he's not involved in the
case how do you like that uh... a little bit of a conflict

who the cheapest people in the world cubans jews are french Canadians
cubans only nineteen out of two hundred twenty six
jews sixty eight but french Canadians are hundred thirty nine
hands down baby you frauds we hate you french Canadians
now there may be some who are nice people i haven't met any
never met a nice french Canadian but yet
i've seen some proof of the never like a pleasant frog
now i'm trying to think so what we're going to do is we're going to have all our
french Canadians can line up on here out in the parking lot in a couple of days
we'll set it all up but it's just like in the ones that i think can stay they'll stay
right and the ones that believe bye bye we'll have you ever met a good looking
french Canadian now although i saw some good looking people in France
but that was not in Quebec
maybe they said all the other words to get that
come like the chinese people how come line up on a going with
most seriously there's like how come the japanese people most of them uh... another city that's bad
that's the trouble thing to say but most of the japanese people i've seen are particularly uh...
grotesque looking in the chinese people are well

I'm not making that up. That was a real for sure. Now let me ask you how many people in this audience would like to get $300 for knowing that men grow sideburns on their face.
And this is the number one, two, three, four, and five shows in America for 300 bucks.
People generally, I think the $500 question was people generally take a crap from their lecture where there were no, is there a radius is lip.
Oh my god, and you wonder what's wrong with this country, why we can't hold a real election for 300 bucks men generally go to their sideburns on their,

But Neil Roger show sports radio five 60s. You a ham. If it's free, it's me. I believe poor as well as the rich women and men alike citizens of every race, create and color all are equal. They are equal. That is so long as all of their votes.
But choose me if the people do not in the end choose me, I would then commit to contest this inaccurate and incomplete count in order to ensure they choose me.
This is from America recount after recount God bless America. Amen 16 to one at five 60 David boys just said David boys. Yeah.

and rising wireless line
here's a mobile and already be chill out
and you know yes sir
hey uh... you understand and that the truth
see if shlopers and dollar beach
uh...
i want to be spent on something
uh... do you think that if the situation happened in any other state let's
say california texas new york with the situation with the votes
to be going to the same type of a nap what you spend on that i have them what's
my spade my spin
that that that that's because it didn't happen in the other state i don't know
the way that i see it would certainly it would certainly appear to me that the
other forty nine states have got their act together hell of a lot better
because we're not going through all of this
yeah i don't know because uh... you know it seems to me that every other
election has been you know such a landslide for the past couple of elections
yeah but but one or two little votes didn't make a difference but now uh...
you know with the situation was down to i don't know hundred and some of the
uh... this is where it didn't make a difference and the fact of the matter is
whether we're embarrassed about or not this is the place where we can't get it
done right no matter what it is i've always said that no matter what it is we don't
know how to do it right i guess you're right
back what so at least at least when i like everybody else
i have a great thing at least we stand out there in the middle
unlike everybody else that knows how to get their crap done right
that knows how to do auto inspection right and knows how to hold an election
right and a million other god damn things
not on specific choices of legislation
yeah yeah yeah
all that was just a jump off the ones
he's supposed to be one of the good guys along with that new thing against

he said oh he's looking to make for a direction
put them on a bus okay both Murray boys put them on a bus
i come home after their eight thousand consecutive laws thirty-night
stayed right for a little bit of rent i'm in the car listing of the post game
uh comments by the coach and somebody asked him about how spaylers plan
oh well he's plan and he's told us about how gritty is playing he's playing fine
and at that point i knew that there was absolutely no hope this man ain't even
watching the same games were watching we must have like six hundred rows bugs
in here either that or just one hands are pretty active he's out wound up
maybe it's a bush bug yeah see that that's how that's how bad it's getting
with the these the right wingers they ain't got the room bug now
they're all over the goddamn place
twelve fifty six and five sixty wq and and i've wondered for a long time about
how they ever had the people working in that building on shared industry
these people like i told you before a bunch of slabs
Greg read in the beesleaves they don't give a crap if we were if all the people
are here working for them how to work out of a dumpster they say hey listen we're
paying you that's the best we can do just do your job and shut up
four three two five sixty seven two a.m. by heavy port
uh
this is then rather reporting for the cbscb news cbs orcs can now confirm
that a man charged with counting ballots has been caught eating chats
the man has been removed from his counting duties and will be undergoing
psychiatric evaluation more details tonight of the cbs
evening news but now this is then rather reported
uh
oh
Oh here he comes, watch his content you've ever heard.
Oh here he comes, he's a shadowy girl.
Oh here he comes, man the sky is once the top.
Oh here he comes, he's a shadowy girl.
The test phase where the standards should be lower, we've listed earlier in the process
that's thrown out the window.
Yeah, throw this, throw him out the window.
560, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T line, it's a big one and two out, we've got to hang from
Shulas at two, Monday night football tonight, after Kimberville camperer of also from Shulas.
All right, there's much of stuff going on, let's go to a mobile and as a matter of fact,
just one more note on the Panthers, we do have the 2000s reallocestr game, we'll see some
real players in here then.
But I'm looking at the schedule, Terry.
I'm looking at the schedule for the next foreseeable futures matter of fact.
And the only game that I see that they may have a chance to win is on the 29th of the month
against Baldwin Boston's in town, maybe.
But between then and now you've got 3, 6, 7, 8 other games, I don't think they have a
China man chance of winning any one of those games.
I could be wrong but we'll see.
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello.
Hello, Neil?
Yes sir.
I wanted to express myself, I think that the reason that
Coral lost the election is not because of Lieberman, I think it's because of what happened with
Iliant.
Yeah.
I think if somehow he would have pushed for Iliant to stay.
He did.
He did, he said that he thought it should be settled in family core, he was going, he
separated himself and Clinton and didn't do him a bit ago, didn't get him one vote.
So you're absolutely positively.
I hate to break the news to one dimensional people like you sir but the world, it doesn't
revolve around Iliant or around the causes of the green tooth or tubents down there in
Little Havana.
That's not what the world hinges on.
Sir, I hate to break that news to you.
If Coral had been part of the human chain, they still would have voted him.
The human chain, she.
Get it right, the human chain.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 10, now maybe if Lieberman would have been down there wearing the
a schmoth on his head instead of a Spencer.
If he would have been the one and he went to wearing a mosses tombstone there and was
hawking a china and sucking up to that to any good.
No, no.
The fact is that those people down there are politically incorrect and always will be.
Don't confuse them with the facts.
And if the coast guard just were to use the little less mace, here's a mobile and Fort
Waterdale.
Hello.
They'll never leave it alone.
No, just can't the stop of the alien.
Never.
Anyway, let me ask you this.
Every single day isn't sometimes the cross you might at least once a day that you hope
that alien is enjoying a happy meal.
Absolutely.
But every time you say that it makes me laugh my butt off.
Anyway, I was almost at a point of apathy with this whole lecture thing.
But last night MSNBC played a biography on George W.

I think we got it again because we got Scalia and we got always fascist on our side. I just had some kind of an inspiration in this to me. I think that they're going to get either a Kennedy or a Conner. All he knew is one. That's her in around five before the other way. I think they're going to be counting again. Huh? I think you can count on it. Well, I don't know. It just I could be wrong. I say it's good with it. 5.67.0560.
What about those sideburns, Regis? Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello? Yes? How are you doing today? Okay. Can we go home again? Let's go to Hollywood. Hello? Hollywood? Hello? Yes, I am. Neil, just calling to tell you about a great side. I saw coming home from vacation on the Palm Beach, County Line and 27. Uh-huh. Gorkham Wind. Oh, Jay did.
Okay, great. Okay. Now they're good and good now. Okay. We got two of these left and then we'll start getting that Christmas music on. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello? Hey, how's it going? All right. All right. I'll tell you all what I'm saying. I just came back from that ugly game. It's really sick. But the people out there really get this political thing. I'll tell you right now. Who gives a crap anymore? Really? That's what I say. I just want to keep in touch with you. You know, it's nice.
I'm glad to be back in Miami. Okay. I'm glad to be back in Miami. Well, that's a lot about your life. Okay. Thank you. Five things. Oh, well, two calls left at the board. Look at that because they're all listening to these audio things. They want to hear this. I don't think it's critical. That stuff. I don't either. Five six seven or five sixty pound five sixty. We just don't have enough people still listening to make it to you at a one o'clock. So I have to play music because I'm not going to sit here and pontificate. I'm not going to do that. They just don't care enough to send
their very best. They have no material at all. But I think they're going to be counting again. Starting tomorrow. I have that feeling. I could be wrong. Been wrong many, many, many times before just like showing up this morning. I was payday. Here's South Miami. Hello. There's a pack of the coach. Yeah. Great. Okay. That's it. I take care of it. See one thing I noticed. Of course, a lot of these little part of the backers out there on the phone. I mean, that that that goes with the territory. But one thing I've noticed in watching the TV coverage.
Is that the least they're consistent. You know, it's like when Barbara Boxer was up there trying to speak on Saturday in
telehancey and the public and we're shouting her down and screaming in the own. And yet when this Jack asked for
Montana's up there, Mr. Republican, the secretary of the fence doesn't happen the other way around.
Mean spirit hostile, which at least is actually refreshing what their party has become. Mean spirit and hostile and hateful.
So at least thanks for packaging it honestly anyway. Conservative. What is the compassion that hate? Is that what it's all about? Yeah.
Here's a mobile and popular beach. Hello. How you doing? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Just call it. Let's you know. While I did vote for George Bush, I must say one thing that was happening.
No, it goes beyond who should be the president. It's really matter counting all the votes. And you know, well, I did vote for Bush. I do believe there should be a recount a complete manual recount. How in the state of Florida just wanted to let you know that. Okay. Have a good day. Thanks.
Complete manual recount. How they're going to do that? Are they really going to be able to do that? No, but whatever, you know, whatever. Just keep counting. Accounting account until they come up with some number. That's a Supreme Court likes to grow likes to bush like that James Baker likes that I like.
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hi there. Yes, sir. Don't just don't give up caring. Got to know what comments I got to say when everyone stopped saying they don't care anymore. That's when the problems really started. I don't care. I couldn't give a crap lesson this point. I'm sick of it. Well, I agree. It's sickening. I really do. But don't stop caring. I know sir. Let me say it again. I don't care. You've got you've got two terrible candidates. You've got two. Two. Three. Two. Three.
You've got two parties with what they're country down. And I don't care. It's not worth it. There is never going to be a way to get an active account. I said that weeks ago. We'll never know who will you, how many votes you really had in this state? Agreed. But don't stop caring. Okay. Say it again. You can keep saying it from now until health reasons over. I don't care. In fact, the more you say it, I don't care. In fact, let me put it to you very clearly, sir. So maybe that you will care all the way down it. If I can get the damn thing up in here. I don't give a sh** anymore. There you go. Thanks. Thanks, Chris.
He just doesn't want to accept it. He thinks that if he says it's 63,000 times, I'm still going to care. I don't give a flying crap. How do you like that? Right.
So it's, you know what fight? It's like company dumpy. Call off the wall. And you could stay in around and argue from now until health was over. How to put it back together? We can't do it. To say what this election. We screwed it up.
We don't know how to do an election right here in a state of Florida. It's irreparably harmed. There was no way to put it back together in a way that will really ever have the honest accurate picture. I don't give a crap how many recounts they do now? It's beyond that point. You can't do it. What an embarrassment. What a joke.
And yet you people refuse to accept that because you're so damn obsessed with your partisanship. You refuse to see the whole goddamn jet before it's going to trees. That's the problem.
It's a mess. It's a typical for the God, then mother f in mess is what it is. And you think by getting a bunch of silly old people sitting around holding a punch cards up and looking for looking for the light blinded by the light. Whatever the hell they're doing. You think we're going to figure it out. Right.
Here's Palm Beach. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. I have a few points that you have the time and patience for me. Number one. In listening to the callers.
From Miami, the Cuban Americans, I guess, they're five six seven O five 60 pound five 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. The callers from Miami, the Cuban American. Sir, take your goddamn bigotry and stick it way inside your back.
You blew nose jackass up there and Palm Beach and I hate to break the news here. We got two busloads of the scratches that are going over the Palm Beach today, whether you like it or not.
How do you like that? Just a piss you off. And there and some of them are from Cuba just just just to add salt in your room. How do you like that? You bigoted piece of crap. You have not just scumbag.
And you are the ones up there. Open must down here. It seems to me that you are the ones up there and Palm Beach. You're the ones that didn't know how to vote.
All you lose five six seven O five 60. Why do you keep a vinyl of that on that line? Topless. Forget about it. Here's a lady mobile in Palm Beach. Hello. Hello. Yes, ma'am.
Hi. Hey, first of all, I have to tell you you're lucky to have an apartment in Amsterdam. My husband and I go there every September. We love it. Yes, I can. And by the way, my husband's European. I have to tell all those people out there that think that we're not so over here. But Europeans think George Bush sucks. Yeah. They don't want them in there. Well, we know that. But the Europeans are better educated than Americans. So what does that say? Exactly. Exactly.
But also this is doing one thing. It's, you know, in two years, the Republicans are going to be out of there. So it's unified everybody else. And you're your comment about the people that vote for Bush cracks me up to about the Bible, something, people, love and.
Drop drive in whatever those people that voted for Bush, they're either retards or I don't know what I don't know what they're thinking. Well, you heard all calls today. So you know, give me a good idea. What's out there?
And then my husband too, since his European, he's like, what's the deal with the people that are voting for Bush? You know, these these insects, victims in Appalachia or whatever, you know, all the retards, all the uneducated hillbillies are voting for Bush. And all the people in the rest of the United States that are a little bit tolerant and a little bit educated voted for goers. I would be embarrassed to say I was a Republican. I'd be embarrassed as I was American. Exactly.
Okay, see in the dam rack. Thanks. Bye, bye. See you on the trim. 5 6 7 0 5 13 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 8 mean spirited hostile bigoted. That's what the Republican party has become. And those of you who are probably a part of that, take a look. That's all I can say. We'll break it toast to you.
Just like that we're doing at the Rachstag. Oh, I just love the way that sounds. Don't you? Love it. Like the Kaiser.
Here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, man. I just wanted to say I voted for goer, but since I've come to think that either of the vast presidential nominate, would make a better president than either of the presidential campus.
Go ahead, meet as a wisdom or courage to use what I said, such available in this campaign. And you have to be sure. I mean, he would have to be sure that Grant, but it's quite like campaign for and with him that he felt he needed to prove it, but his own.
Yeah, well, he didn't want to hear anymore. Those bubble mice. These five six seven oh five 50 pound five 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Here's a mobile in Hollywood. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Hi, Neil. Long time first time. Okay. Are you aware of a situation where we could actually have. Bush and Lieberman. Not going to happen, sir. Yeah, it's been discussed. It's old news. Not going to. It is. Yeah.
Well, I just was wearing there. What can I can I call you think how you think James Baker would like that? Bush would Lieberman sit in there with a smart on his head. He'd probably still wear one on a callus and the pay us in the whole deal. This to piss those are going off. No, you can't. Sir five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 this. I'll tell you this much of cause we've had today. This should tell you anybody here. It was in town from out of town. If you're listening to show believe me may think it's pretty painful, but this is what Florida is all about. You're hearing it.
This is exactly the reflection this program as you'll ever get to what the state of Florida is all about. Our middle name is. That's why we don't know how to hold on. Right. Here's a mobile and pepper pine. Hello. Yeah, Neil. Long time first time. People saying and clean yourself on this point in this, but saying that you don't care. I don't care how disappointed anybody is I'm just giving you my honest opinion. Now if it'll make you have.
Happy all gee. What are we going to do? I'll get all worked up. I don't care. I make a point. The Supreme Court is why I care. If you take a look at the makeup of the Supreme Court. It's horrible. I mean it's all one sided basically three of the Supreme Court nominees are Reaganites, but the one that really, really bothers me is the long hand of the old man Bush with the deciding vote clearance.
That really disturbs me. That's number one. Number two could get this in is that I think it's a perfect court. We live in a police state anyway. So what difference is it made?
Well, okay. Also, Mr. Scalia, the renowned supposedly the intellect makes this statement. The counting of votes doesn't miss us when he shut down the voting.
He said the counting of votes in my opinion threatens your parable harm to the petitioner, which is Mr. Bush. You know why he causes your repairable harm?
Because he'd lose the God darn election if he allows the reek counting. That's like an admission that if we count all of votes, yeah.
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And like I said, I don't give a crap. The 567 or 560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless lines. See, all of you people with no life request.
This is just Florida is famous for people with no life. That's a motto down here. So if you want to get yourself all whipped up into some kind of an apoplectic frenzy, be my guest.
But you can only keep squeezing it so wrong that you have to find something else to squeeze. Trust me. Believe me. Even Bob Dolan knows that.
26 after 1 at 560 WQIM. Do you know what he just said? Truth. That must have been clearance Thomas there. He said, are you two living again?
The Neil Roger show sports radio 560. QA.
We can't find you. She is just disappeared. We're looking all over. And it's still a hit. Hey, Georgie, junior.
Georgie, junior is a pizza.
We're going to have a big barbecue. Stop resisting already. Yeah, but we're making a lot tougher than expected. And they don't be liking that. 560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.
Here's a mobile in cool. Hello. Mobile in cool.
Going once going twice. Hello, yes, sir. Yeah, I'm here. And I'm here. Hey, I'm here. And I'm here.
And your radio is up in the back. Turn that radio on. What we got here is we got to get the get push and go to drop down and drop down.
Drop the clip of coin for the other two. All right, but. Bye. Okay, bye. Bye.
Cluiston. Ever been in Cluiston? Ever doing two there? I have not. I have to believe me. Go real fast.
560.560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello.
Okay, here's a mobile in the sea. Bring hello. How you doing? Okay. It's first time I'm a listener and the first time color.
I live in Jacksonville. I was just visiting the area. I'm so sorry. Well, yeah, I'm just wondering what are they doing the election people in this area to prevent all the idiots from messing up the election next time?
What do you mean in this area? You had 28,000 votes to route in DuVolk County. Well, they were under votes. No, under under votes and over votes 29,000. Well, I'm afraid it wasn't a bunch of blue hairs running out talking about voted by Mr. Volk.
Who was it? You had 5,000 under votes. But they had a total of 29,000, which means you had 24,000 people voted for more than one. Well, I mean, that's a mistake. But what do you mean that's a mistake? That's a mistake. 24,000? I understand what you're saying. But nobody is crying the blues in DuVolk County. Sure they are. Like they were crying the blues, like the blue hairs with crying the blue hair.
Yeah, down here. So what's your point? What are you trying to say? The people in Palm Beach are dumb, aren't there people in DuVolk? Palm Beach, Broward and man. No, we didn't have the problem in Broward. Broward wrapped it all up in no time at all. Once they started counting, they wrapped that whole thing up in a bottle of wax. So here you go. Well, don't come back again now. You hear 5,670, 560, Palm 560 on the 18. Nothing worse than some cracker from DuVolk County coming down here and giving this election when they had 28 or 29,000 over votes and under votes and under pants.
Just head back up the Hershey Highway, Palin. They'll come back anytime soon. Here's Carl Gable, so.
Oh, that was a refreshing thought. I just want to have you take on the election. I voted Democrat and...
You want to have my take on the election? Yes. What does that mean? I just want to ask you a question regarding if things have been different.
We know that Nader was a big part of the... He was one of the chiggers in the wood pile, right?
Now, my premise is, what would have happened if Gore had selected Hearty Duty in the South? He would have won.
That's what I mean. Buffalo Bob Smith, Rest in Peace, he would have won.
Why, why, why did he, I mean, I...
Because he's a stupid man, because he's got bad advisors, because he won a crappy campaign, sir.
And thank you for reminding us of that again. It's true.
Eight years of great prosperity, record unemployment, all these good things going on. People having a great time of things.
And we have to be counting votes and chads and who scraped the ballot and who scraped the...
And Scalia, to try to get in there? Sure, it's easy to despise James Baker and these right winged far-bison bush people.
But the fact of the matter is, the Democratic Party, it was theirs to lose and he lost it.
He flushed it right down the toilet, pick in Julie Bremen, running a crappy campaign, not parade in bubble-round air,
and at least in Arkansas, Tennessee, where he only lost by 3% in both states.
But to try to get anybody to be the least bit objective about this is almost impossible.
You have all these hysterically partisan people as if either party is so great, or as if either candidate is so great.
And I'm going to say it for the umpteenth time. It's just a question of which one is the least dangerous,
which is a hell of a sad thing to have to say when you're talking about picking a president and picking which political parties that have no good least damage to you.
Here's Kate Kuhl, hello.
Good afternoon, Neil. How are you?
Okay, sir.
Listen, I was listening earlier this morning and I voted for Gorg, but that's not what I was going to talk about, Neil.
Here's what we're good at in Florida. We're good at giving $126 tickets for doing two miles over the limit.
We're just coming in your backyard, cutting down your citrus tree. We're going to give a 90-year-old driver's license to the mail.
Right. He's on. You're on a roll. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it.
What other thing? I have a Republican friend of mine. I said, well, what'd you do this weekend? He says, well, I went to the gun show.
Thanks, Neil. I'll get one.
5.67.05.60.0.5.60 on it. And don't forget the early bread dinners. We're going to throw those two at least.
We used to be before the old people put all those places out of business like pumper-nicks by stealing the silverware in the sweeten-low.
And stuff on all those pickles in their goddamn bag and their sack.
I hope you have good aim, some of your old folks out there. I hope you don't stuff the pickles in the wrong bag because, oh, man.
They rinse right off. Oh, god. Nothing worse than a brown deal.
5.6.705.60.0.5.60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.
I think your Lieberman said that makes it uncoachier if you do that.
I'll depend on who's best is in the bag, I guess.
He wants me to sing God Bless in the Archaean paste decent of G-string up here. I'll do it.
All right.
This is the year that I'm going to get smart, yeah.
The holiday friends he has already started.
I think you're ever going to see my face in the crowd pushing in the shoving. Don't think so pound.
Not on your lie. It's a quality of snowstorm.
That's when my computer on a seaborn of the lazy ass weighing shopped my life.
Not on your lie. Well, I'm buzzing this neighborhood.
I don't have to hit a phone, Lieber. I can click a mouse and hear the sign.
So not on your sign.
141.5.60.00.
Neil, we're pretty disappointed in you. We expected you to come on and be waving a banner and I'll
piss off about the Supreme Court thing and this Antonin Scalia and his fascist will guess what, too bad.
There are a lot of things in life you can fake, scored, scored, but this ain't one of them.
I just don't care. I'm sick of it. I'm tired. I'm inundated with it already. It's terminal.
It's time to end it. It's time to move on with important things as soon as we find out what those are like vacations.
Here's a mobile and candle. Hello.
Hey, Neil. Good afternoon.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Michael.
Thank you.
I voted for Bush, but you know what? At this point in the election, if I was Bush running for president,
I'd just go ahead and give it to Gore because it was such a close call and the board voting was so screwed up,
I wouldn't feel confident sitting there as president. Either I'd win it by landslide or I'd just give it up and you know,
look like the better man.
Yeah.
And just call it a day.
They both look desperate to me.
But you know, it's funny because just think about the other states that have screwed up in the ballot thing,
but maybe only Florida was brought to light. And how many years this has been going on, you know?
But I think the machine is the best way to do it because the machine is not biased.
Machine?
I don't feel a computer man. Computer.
You're close to polls at a certain time, seven o'clock eight o'clock. You press a button that automatically locks out anybody
from voting who wasn't in line in time to vote. And then here's the totals and that's it. And then we move on.
Yeah.
May have been fun for Dan Radler and Tom Broke, but too bad.
And Neil, what about if they just mix Florida and count all the other states for president?
Well, the other states are not going to let that happen. You can butchering.
But why do you think they're so frantic?
Hey, one more thing, Neil. I'm looking up with a T.S. for the first time today and I'm looking forward to it. That's always been a fantasy of mine.
With a what?
A T.S. A transsexual. I don't know if you've ever been with one, but I'm going to give that a shot today.
I've always wanted to try out a little bit of a shot.
Okay, give it a shot pal. Good luck here.
Squared, squared. Give it a shot.
With a transsexual. I see I never understood that. But then again, there's some people who are so desperate.
56670560. CTS to me always meant something else like tough.
Crap.
Here's a mobile-infoil-moder-dale. Hello.
Mobile-infoil-moder-dale.
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir.
Hey, I just wanted to know what do you think about.
I was kind of disappointed. I'm worried for Gore.
Yeah.
But he never seemed to address any of the issues and like you didn't want to attack Bush or he was scared to say anything.
That's right. He pushed he footed around, man. He pushed he footed around. He dropped the ball. You got it.
Exactly. For me, it's like he blew the whole election. I mean, he sat up there and said he's not angry.
I mean, you have all these people behind you who was angry as hell.
And don't forget the way you leave him and push he footed around as the bait would chain you there.
I mean, it made him seem like a good guy. That was pathetic.
Exactly.
And one question I have for you is, what do you think the GOP has so much as they want to implement that they're willing to...
I mean, like you said, it's clear as they that the basically Bush is saying, hey, I know I lost the election.
Let's not do the recount, you know, because I lost.
So what do you think is they have a bit of sleep so much that they're willing to even go on the White House.
What do you mean by that? They had to take it away from eight years ago. They wanted back.
It's like if somebody came along and took away your best, you know, poach easy game or whatever.
Or somebody at Gildo, they wanted back. They want to play with it for a while. Right?
Just like when Roy came in here, remember that?
Roy!
So that big black Gildo and then Scorant said, I wanted back?
Five. But we haven't seen her in a cruise age, you know what?
Wow, no wonder I haven't said she good mood.
I'll be sure and say hi to her for me though, not the QM Christmas party.
Yeah, give her a big kiss on the lip.
Which one?
Not everyone you like, although, bang, you must have a stronger stomach than I do.
Five, six seven, oh five, six, the pound, five, six, the only thing.
And all the other people I don't speak to around here, like the water, not tea.
And how many of... And of course, you're a good friend, Gile Sarner.
My best friend.
You're a best friend, Gile Sarner.
You're saving me a spot.
Now let me ask you, is the food gonna be kosher with the Christmas party tonight?
Where is the Christmas party? Where is the Dorena?
It's gonna be at the Capricios, restaurant, I guess.
Yeah.
Now you're starting to sound as Goyation's Diffo.
By intent.
Where's Dorena? I know. Don't get paranoid.
So that's not gonna be kosher. How can you eat there?
That's free.
It's just a free super-seed kosher.
Also now we get back to Alpolvoli, who's the cheapest Gary Sarner.
We shouldn't put his name on there too, as opposed to the other Jews.
Who has the cheapest people? The French Canadians, how many two?
Jews, 102, and the Cubans only 23.
The Cubans didn't belong on it.
Let's Cubans aren't known for being cheap.
But you just had that one bad side.
Yeah, that's true.
So I figured I'd put it on there, because I give the Cubans a chance to, you know,
get some of their venom out of their system.
Nothing worse than having too much venom, venom, venom, venom.
That's what our friends at Intel...
Oh, buy some Intel, by the way. I bought a bunch of that.
Just when everybody was saying, oh, look at that.
Neobot, Motorola, and Intel, this one they both had warnings.
You know what? They're both doing great.
Oh, so with both hands...
Bye, bye, bye!
What's the market doing? The Dow is only 17 up, but most of us don't care about the Dow.
We care about that tech-dreck, which is an XX-UP 75 points right now, as I speak.
And after this announcement comes out in a few hours, after Bush gets in there,
the market's going to go soaring through the top.
Because all the pharmaceutical companies and all the people that are polluting the environment,
the oil companies, all the great-wavours, they want Bush. Big time.
Here's Miami. Hello.
Hey, Neel. Yes, sir.
First of all, I just want you to pass them DJ that we do have.
DJ, yeah.
To hell with them.
And...
Yeah, the hell were that kids' groovy, right?
And I hope they're ready for when this Hitler guy comes in,
because he's going to spend over and do them in the butt.
Yeah.
All right, you saw that thing in 60 minutes when there were an interview in Gour.
Yeah.
And how that lady was trying to rip a hole in Gour.
She seemed like Gour was a bit...
I guess it was a criminal.
I didn't know that.
Just go on.
Just go on and back out and pack this at Gour.
We'll figure it out.
And one more thing, sir.
Yes, sir.
Did George go ahead and fill you in when you were on vacation?
He talked something about some guy that came over his house.
But thanks, Jimmy.
Some drug dealer?
No, some other guy came over his house.
He came over his house, but thanks, Jimmy.
Yeah.
I was on the ground.
Okay.
All right.
Thanks.
What guy came over to your house?
One of my friends brought over...
His girlfriend brought over a bigoted sack of crap.
That was hysterical.
Oh, she brought over her wife.
Yeah, it's not the story.
My friend's girlfriend brought over a bigoted sack of crap,
a white trash piece of crap.
You went on for like 10 minutes, but I'm not going to bore you now.
And...
And he's...
All the best line that he had after ripping niggers and sticks were about an hour,
was about how the Germans had the best medical care in the world,
because they experimented on live people.
That's what...
That's what Justice Scalia just said.
Look at that.
See?
There you go.
He just got to a sandwich just a second ago.
This is 560 QALs, the Neil Rogers Show Sports Radio 560s.
QALs.
There is no Chris Messin, the silly middle piece.
No.
No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus.
They have different religious beliefs.
They believe in Muhammad.
And not in our holiday.
And so every December I go to the middle East and fly.
Hey, there, Mr. Muslims.
Mary fucking Christmas.
Put down that book to call and I hear some holiday wishes.
In case you haven't noticed,
if Jesus said birthday,
so get off your heat and mud for a map and fucking celebrate.
There is no holiday season in India.
I've heard.
They don't hang up their stockings and that is just absurd.
They never read a Christmas story.
They don't know what root off is about.
And that is why in December I'll go to India and fly.
Hi there, Mr. Hinduess.
Mary fucking Christmas.
He can't know any some beef and passage rules on the hands.
In case you haven't noticed,
if Jesus said birthday,
so get off your heat and Hinduess.
I'm not a fucking celebrate.
Now I heard that in Japan,
everyone just lives in sins.
They face several dogs and put needles in their skin.
On December 20th,
all they do is eat a cake.
And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and fly.
Hi there, Mr. Hinduess.
Mary fucking Christmas.
God is going to kick her out of here for the next day and so.
In case you haven't noticed,
they're supposed to say so.
So that's all we've got for Jesus.
Mary fucking Christmas to you.
On Christmas Day,
I travel around the world and say,
now it's Christmas bonus and all you APS2.
Mary fucking Christmas.
So yeah.
Right.
It's what 55 at 56 W. Kim.
I will say at the risk of having you think that I really care about this anymore,
which I don't.
But I did listen to about the minute or two of this anal argument
that they're playing the audio tapes out of on CNN.
And the idea that the Supreme Court is saying they're asking about hanging chairs and interfering.
These are the states rights people, baby.
The states rights people.
They're sitting up there and of course they're going to push people.
I ask you about the internal affairs of a state election
and how votes were counted and how votes were not counted.
Do they have any business being involved in this whatsoever?
No, of course not.
But it's a good way to wrap it up.
Here's North Miami.
Hello.
Hey, how are you doing?
Okay, sir.
Real quick.
After they started counting it down,
the Saturday I was very happy when they stopped it.
I said, I'm tired of this crap.
You mentioned 60 minutes and you missed.
Or you didn't talk about the most horrendous story they had on their last night.
If you had a call about it, I didn't see it.
The Roman Catholic Church is going into all the poor neighborhoods around the country.
Did you find that in the church?
Yeah.
Buying up the hospitals.
And then not allowing any type of a...
Women's right.
Or...
What was the first and foremost to do about anything?
There was a lady that had nine children.
Okay?
Nine children.
She might have been a Mexican descendant of that shore.
That makes no difference.
She wanted to get a total of gays because she couldn't get pregnant again.
No, absolutely not.
The closest nearest hospital after that was over 35 miles away.
It was the ugliest...
Well, at least they're consistent.
The greatest dispensers of human suffering, misery and ignorance all over the globe is the Catholic Church.
And they're consistent.
I mentioned last week somebody fasted me a great two-page article,
but we were in poor, the only election crap about the fact that it looked like they were going to ease up their restrictions on contraceptives.
And they said, no, guess what?
The answer is no.
Well, you know, I tell you one thing, the pill that they brought over is probably the best thing that's going to happen
as far as the abortion issue.
I think that's going to be the best bet.
And you need to watch all of 60 minutes to have one more thing there on all about bengruppee.com.
I saw...
I was slipping around.
I saw that segment, but I didn't see the thing on the chair.
And I was thinking about you.
When you talk about your start market,
do you involve any of that stuff?
No, absolutely not.
I have no.com.
Thank God.
Well, you know what?
I love you, Neon.
I've been listening to you for years.
I wish you did not put a dime in the stock market.
I wish you did just stuck it in the bank somewhere.
Me too.
I had a great life when you retire.
Me too.
You're right.
You can put it in the holidays.
And we'll survive all of the bull crap that we've had.
You bet.
Thanks a lot.
Yeah, we'll make it to your one way or the other.
And it's only money.
That's what Mitch Hershaw always says.
And the way he says it.
I don't know if the link money.
Mine.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Pound 5.
What's a Justice Renquist saying?
How many do you think it is?
How many do you like that?
How many do I think?
Yeah.
There you go, Justice Renquist.
Stuff them all up your ass all night.
