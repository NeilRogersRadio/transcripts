AM Miami 4 Lauderdale presents the Neil Rogers Show.
A lot of talk to Neil called 5667 0560 toll-free for Dave and Robert, or bound 566 on yourself.
Oh, the opinions of Neil, his guests, callers, or anyone else on the show do not necessarily
reflect those of WGQAM easily read acquisitions or the easily run task group.
Now, Neil Rogers, on Sports Radio 5662A.
Good-by, Brian Murray.
You killed the team and you wouldn't smell good hockey if it fit you or the ass for a coach
you are a stupid.
Oh, welcome.
Neil Tory must be nuts.
Yes.
To keep you on it, you couldn't manage your check book.
Never mind this beat.
That at one time had all the right snow.
And it don't be too late for us to sell a break when you're the one's day train.
Oh, right.
And when you leave, don't forget Christmas, your hockey queen.
You caught that you were two set up and stopped the plane.
But you can't point the base gun anymore.
Those are what left to make a change.
Good-by, Brian Murray.
You can't admit that you don't know shit about running on hockey case.
I'm not interested in hearing why.
But no matter how you try.
You can't deny that you made the target just because you make the lousy coat.
And as a manager, you really know.
And it tells you too late for us to sell a break when you're the one's day train.
Oh, and when you leave, don't forget Christmas, all your hockey queen.
You can't stop that you were two set up sets up to play.
And with the base gun, you need more.
And so what left to make?
If you don't get idea to hang on to these old, old and the golden, whatever they are.
Oh, I'm telling you. I can really speak.
I got this headquartered, but I better be here today.
I'm going to get rid of the coach and his brother or the GM and his brother.
No matter which way I look at it, bye-bye boys.
I'm kind of torn after last night.
I'm torn between rippin' the hell out of this town again.
Which is easy because I do that every day.
It's not going to change. Is it going to get any better?
No. No, it is what it is.
Like Don Corleone said to a Vincent, you are what you are.
That keeps coming back in my mind.
And if you're never again, at one scene, you are what you are.
And Godfather, three, don't remember that?
Well, but you know, we live from New York.
But this town isn't going to get any better.
It's not a sports town. In fact, fill the tip off on this hurt place.
I hear these idiots, and I do mean idiots.
Wifers, assholes, calling up all these sports shows.
Oh, the BCS, Subhole, Perl, or Cercanes, we got a lot of weed.
We, we got Rob.
As if anybody gives a crap about that.
They don't care about the Subi Esper, they care about the BCS pool.
But some stupid, stupid, idiotic college football pool.
That means absolutely nothing.
And almost every one of these guys, well, you know, if we do this,
and we do that, how many of these people do you think really went to with them?
Did you go to with them?
No. Did I go to with them?
No. Did Hank go to with them?
No. Did your Rose go to you, then?
No. Did Jaldi go to you, then?
No.
Uh, D-Fo, did he go? Did I cap him to go to you, then?
No. Do you know anybody who went to you, then?
Besides Silly Tony Cigaretteau.
Anybody?
The Beast.
Well, there's always one exception.
Who? Jason Gretz and Olias.
Please.
I'm not talking about sports news.
I'm talking about like real people.
Oh, okay, definitely.
I mean, the Beast is a real person, but he's an exception.
He can't, you know, he can't help it.
Just take a look at him. He can't help it. He means well, but...
No, but seriously, how many people do you know who really went to you?
There's nothing there. There was no such school.
In fact, I was one of these guys calling Hank yesterday about the poor and belly-acadabra.
Well, if we can do this, if we can do that.
And I thought to myself, I wonder if there actually are any classes conducted there anymore.
Do you think they actually have classes here, do you want many more?
Because there was no campus anymore.
And nobody, if they do claim that they go to school, or nobody lives on campus, do they?
No.
But anyway, we'll get back to that.
We'll do a pillow map today.
The BCS pool.
But I'm going to tell you last night, if we had 9,000 people in the Macarena,
that was a lot.
I'm trying to be kind.
In fact, I even check with Yolvi, the ultimate show.
I checked with him this morning.
I said, what would you say about 9,000?
And he said, yeah, I think you got it about beyond 1,000, is what he said.
And that was at the peak.
That was at the height of fandomness in the game last night.
After the second period, at which point I guess it was 2,010, 3,010, I believe?
Or was it 3?
Well, whatever it was.
Because I stayed till the third island.
In fact, everybody's given me high fives and low fives today here.
You stayed till the third girl.
Wow!
Congratulations to you.
I almost wish I would have stayed for the last couple of minutes when I understand the fans
who are all cheering, fire Terry Murray, fire Terry, they're all screaming in the yard.
Which I would have avoided on that too.
Then I would have had an excuse for my bad joke with my cold today.
I would have said, oh, I screamed myself hoarse at that game last night.
It's one good thing I didn't lose any voice at the game.
Never made a peep.
I cheered for all the panties and goals.
Oh, that's right, there weren't any.
So, like I said, I made no noise.
I made about as much noise as they did.
None.
That franchise is in big trouble.
Big trouble.
And the heat had their opening game last night and the Mickey Mouse arena.
Did they sell it out?
No.
No.
A lot of hubbob and fanfare about that.
But they've been by all admissions.
Even though it was a retirement this morning, what a big crowd they had.
Didn't sell it out.
And I've been telling you that for years, this is not a sports town.
It's never going to be a sports town, boys and girls.
Now, when there's a winner, when it's we, we, we, we, we, we, we.
When somebody gets hot or has a big income enough that might maybe might make people feel better about themselves.
Like Miami FSU, for example, or this week Miami for junior tech.
Then all of a sudden, oh, we, if we could just read.
And the same bolso is talking a heck yesterday.
Tell them about how don't get nervous because I read the inside word that if Miami wins this weekend,
they'll have beaten the number one and number two.
And they might even jump up over Oklahoma and being number one.
Of course, hang out righteously and do you know about it?
Rightfully so.
How could that be Oklahoma?
Has it lost?
Has Miami lost?
Uh-huh.
Last time I checked, it lost the game.
But we want to be number one.
Don't you understand?
We want to feel good about ourselves.
I'll guarantee those people our last night don't feel too good about ourselves, including me.
That was pathetic.
That was pathetic.
Lack of talent, lack of effort.
Yeah, I know a couple of injuries there, but you know, all teams have to overcome injuries.
Even the friars who are decimated with injury and dissension and Eric in limbo,
even they tied jersey last night one one.
Coming from behind with a late goal.
Even they tied the devils.
What playing so good?
This team's in a coma.
So it's like a chicken in the egg thing.
How can you blame the public when there's only 9,000 people there last night?
And then you know something, it's only going to get worse.
It's only going to get worse.
You go there and you feel, even before the game starts, you feel rejected.
You look around and you think, is this, is there like a real game going on here?
Do you realize this is a scrimmage?
And all the atmosphere of a, uh, of shini hockey, pod hockey,
that's with two ends.
This ain't the GF literature.
We don't put those four letter words in there.
Two ends, not two teams.
Although that would be more appropriate, I would say.
Shini hockey with two teams.
That's what we saw last night from your panthers.
Lack of talent, destroying certain players,
just taking away all their confidence, including one who didn't play last night,
including his individual Victor Cosworth.
That's what these Murray boys have done.
You build up these great expectations and then the Revan games won win.
And it would be so bad if it was one win and a lot of really tough losses.
A scoreless tie against Minnesota, the vile, a girls team.
The Minnesota vile make, they make Rutgers look like a real team.
They make it look like UN plays real teams all the time.
And the island is, although they're hot, they lead, they got a six game on Beaton Street.
Let's face it.
With the exception of three or four guys out there, like a bunch of no names.
Whoever heard most of those guys.
Pretty sad effort.
In fact, I was when I left there.
I thought for sure I'd went into the refund window.
Should there have been refunds last night on the, oh yeah.
At least it's just to show that they're good sports.
Or didn't my good close friend, Ron can you be before the game last night?
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
Find a friend, Ron.
Find a friend.
Go vote your pocket Pokemon Tuesday, which I know you will, and go find a friend.
Or like they say I'm Regis, call a friend.

I went to an Orchard County jail looking for a father then I could nail everyone's
talking and doing the thing.
We're all begging him, they said we do not think we're that's f**king right.
They're the fire that's f**king right.
They could find his own over the cell phone.
We're begging as the jail house f**king.
Officer 47 was saying in a tree they were to queue to scope about a hammer scene.
This one in name was hiring me with a twig.
She said come over here so I can make him a bitch.
So let's f**king, they could find his ass f**king right.
We're begging as the jail house f**king.
The boy and officer were standing on the loan and the phone didn't spark it was hard and
known.
The warrant dead body what you doing over there bang yourself and then make green wacky
in that jail.
That's f**king right.
Everybody that's f**king right.
They could find his ass f**king right.
We're begging as the jail house f**king.
Alright, okay, 1015 at 560 WQAM.
So where we started at the episode I don't want to spend a lot of time on it because obviously
there are no fans but that was pretty depressing, pretty awful, little test,
cute-inducing.
And you know that Barley who's anxious to unload that thing anyway, you know that he's not
going to take too much more heat so to speak before he finally makes a big change.
There's just the look at the personnel it just isn't there.
It just isn't great.
You got two or three guys and you got a long way to go.
He's a good kid and played great last night or even 7-8 nothing we could left a lot
earlier.
Oh seriously, it could have been easily 7-8 to nothing.
He played great.
How long does that go on?
And of course the one thing that this proves beyond a shadow of the doubt are the
NPCs there last night and an unsolved opening night for the heat proves we need a new
stadium.
I must be crazy, I must be nuts.
Yeah, let's build a new stadium on a real street corner and in a row we have a
kidney corner opposite it.
Yeah, with taxpayer money.
That sounds like a great idea to me.
Here's a mobile in the North Miami, hello.
Hey, Anil.
That was fun, the unfortunate participants at the game last night.
Did you get your refund?
All right, going in, I almost knew I was going to watch a losing game.
Yeah.
And the best part of the game was the chanting for Terry to get fired.
But as much as I want to blame Terry, I get to blame his big brother for not getting him
any defensemen.
We needed him all off season.
Right.
Nothing was done to improve the blue line.
And as soon as we get him out of here we get pat in, the better.
I went out.
I emailed Bill Forring, I posted his email address on the Internet.
I imagine he's getting flooded right now with emails to get TM out.
Good, excellent.
And get pat in.
Get him both out.
What about a bus, a make a package deal?
Bill, I mean, Bill, he's done, he got a spray.
So I can't blame him that bad.
He really didn't do anything that helped us on the blue line.
We really needed defensemen.
We really needed Blake or somebody.
Yeah.
I mean, if you guys could put the biscuit in the basket and you know when you only got
Tori and Whitney and nobody else can score, you got real problems.
Okay, pal, good luck to us.
What do you say, Bill Murray?
Yeah, my suggestion somebody asked me last night, who you would like to see replace him?
I said Pat Burns.
Yeah.
He's available now.
In fact, if they pick up our part and I was going to say, Harry Senator would be happy,
but he just resigned in Boston.
After firing Pat Burns, they bring in my Ken and they lose two out of the next four games.
And now Harry's sending them quits.
Now, but they haven't.
Big parties all up and down there, all the Bruins fans.
But they'll find out it wasn't Harry's sending them that was the cheap, but it's the owner.
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.
Hello.
Hey, how are you doing?
Pretty good.
I'm a Bruins fan and I was happy to see Finland finally get a bow.
Yeah, I would say.
But you'll find out the matter who they're bringing.
It's the purse strings are tight.
Right.
Yeah, back to the hard coins for a second.
Yeah.
I learned that they were not like number four in the coaches' hall, number five in the other hall.
I heard they were number one in the FBI call.
Any truth to that room?
That is true.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The election real quick.
Yeah.
I just got a question for you.
Well, I'm an I'm an undecided and I'm not sure and I'm not sure how you vote.
You vote for the candidate.
Do you think will most positively affect you or is it will be best for society in general?
Both.
Okay.
But never strictly pocket votes.
People had both strictly on dollars and cents and how much money do they think that they're going to do.
First of all, the president doesn't pass laws.
The president doesn't make laws.
So no matter which one tells you about his tax plan and this plan, Congress has to enact those laws.
And they always get watered down and a lot of times they don't even get passed in the first place.
So it's all this campaign bull crap.
Right.
I mean, that position of the president is just more simple than anything, isn't it?
The one?
It's the position of the president that he is more symbolic.
I mean, they don't really affect that part of the president.
How do you think it's symbolic?
The position of president.
It's not really much that he does that really changes much.
The Congress, like you said.
Yeah.
No.
Okay, go check the public.
Go check. Go come up on the floor and no commander let's raise it.
What is that?
A hypodermic needle?
Oh, that's a pin.
It looks like a hypodermic needle, isn't it?
Wonderful aisle of dreams promotion panel.
It is?
Yes.
It's a syringe.
And it's also a panel.
Well, how do you like that?
I bet the salespeople over there were using that.
And the panel.
Of course, picking up people using drugs.
So Joe Rose this morning, not to be outdone by his performance yesterday,
brow beating, perpap, the Buddha.
This morning, Joe was reading a live spot at about what time was it?
About 9, 15, something like that.
And Joe Rose being, if expected, that college rocker room antics again,
just like the story I read yesterday about the cops,
grabbing each other's crotch, you know, boys would be boys.
And Joe Rose walks over and drops his yours, drops his shorts,
and flashes his back on, and moons yell the right in the purse while he's reading his live spot.
How do you like that?
I would not have to take a leak about five minutes after I heard about this.
And I saw Gildi in the hallway, and his nose was,
I had a lot of take of a color as nose was, but yeah, I want to get too close.
I darker shade of brown.
So you were right there when you were telling me about Gildi,
had his nose up to, I asked him, that's how he got that job in the first place.
So yeah, look at how naive I am.
I've been here all this time, but I keep minding those in this room.
See, I don't go and wander around in the hall or get into a lot of trouble.
We have enough trouble in here.
But as the dudes go on and find more and more about the infestuous relationships
that exist here about all this so crappy, because I don't need sports shows.
Well, what about the BCS poll we got left?
So that's my poll for today.
And you may not think it's very significant, but it is.
Because I think you may be surprised at the result.
Let's find out where our listening audience went to Oregon's going right now.
To college.
We'll give you three categories.
And for the question of a, where did you attend college or how do we word this?
What college did you go through or are attending now?
How's that?
Now, let's not it.
Let's not answer that.
Oh, no, they can't.
Which applies to you?
Went to UM?
Went to another college or never went to college at all?
Huh?
That's pretty simple, pretty straightforward.
Which applies to you?
Went to UM?
Went to another college or never went to college period?
Right?
Is that complicated?
No.
No.
Don't need to draw a diagram form.
I could pull last time.
I still try to climb up the barber pole.
Why give me a whimsical look on that?
Is that difficult?
No, that's...
I mean, could you answer that question?
I think you already did.
Once we had another college.
Okay, did not go to UM?
Went to another college.
Yeah, but we...
We...
We, we, we, we.
Yeah, they must've listened to Joe too much.
Too much little dog, man.
And like I told you before,
a little really ain't too bad.
But too much really...
Can be real bad for you.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Yeah, not good for you, Joe.
A little bit not bad.
And keep your ass out of Joe's face.
God, that's just...
I mean, talk about...
Stop from morick.
That locker room thing.
Here's the guy.
What is Joe?
About 52 now.
I'd say Joe Rose 54.
And he's acted like a kid in a high school locker room again.
They never outgrow that.
That's something that never leaves them.
Reno still comes over to house in Saturdays
before the Big Football Games.
Showers with Joe.
We'll just play every Saturday.
He kicks the wife there, a kid's out of the house.
Yeah.
They had to do that thing.
They, they're these things.
Part of their mentality.
Here's a mobile and highly.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
You couldn't be near dead on about not doing a sports camp.
But I've been called to up here.
And I still can't figure out what kind of town we live in.
It seems like it's a dead zone, most.
Nobody has, nobody cares about anything.
There's no passion down here.
Other than the old people in there,
are centuries-old.
Early hood generation.
Now you're getting warm.
Early hood generation.
Right.
The old birds, the $1 movies that are on existence anymore.
And it's just crazy.
I mean, you got, I mean, the heat, the panthers, the marlins.
I mean, even the dolphins, when they, they're after,
the rate of TV stations,
have to buy their tickets.
What?
That's correct.
It's craziness.
I'm still trying to figure out what kind of town we live in.
Maybe you can shake some light on the situation.
One word.
Horseball.
Horseball town.
All right, we all fight.
Okay, keep your windows warm about, you're using smoke.
Maybe miles away, the horseball.
That's what this town is.
It's a horseball place.
And I'm making a lot of money here.
And that's why I'm not going away.
I live in Amsterdam.
I work here.
Now why are you laughing at that?
That's true.
I live abroad.
And I work here.
Unfortunately, I still haven't quite got the balance yet.
That's the way I would like it.
But I'm working on it.
I just get a little bit closer over here to hell out of commute.
Yeah.
But I can handle it.
No, I'm not sure.
It is a horseball town.
And I can get an example.
Now the Panthers at least made the playoffs last year.
Right?
That's what five years ago.
But they made the playoffs and had a pretty good year last year.
Best record ever.
Had a great home record.
And even when we were hot, could we sell a place out?
No.
So it's not just the fact that the prices were too high.
It's not just the fact that the team stinks and is playing crappy only as one win.
It's the fact that first of all, there are no hockey fans here to begin with.
Secondly, it's a lukewarm front running ban ragging jump in town.
How about if we had the tent to be lightning here?
Now I realize that they can't last much longer over there.
I hear what's with all due respect about the fans of the West Coast.
That franchise can't exist much longer.
They are now arguably the worst team in the league, even worse than Columbus and the Minnesota
and Atlanta and all these other non-existent teams.
So you gave that man you've destroyed the game.
Haven't I been saying that?
Too many teams, too much horsecraft, too much dilution like in all sports.
You dilute the talent and you've got mediocrity rampant rampant.
And people don't want to pay big bucks to go see mediocrity.
But can you imagine if we had the lightning team here that gives up like five, six, seven goals every game?
It's blown out.
How long?
How many years do you think they were to last in here?
Two or four maybe?
That would have been it.
Bye bye.
Sayah.
Well, this place is in and John Henry you see they, you can cry in line.
You got snooker baby.
You got sucked in by Wayne.
You're the last and the latest in a long line of suckers.
Got sucked in by Wayne.
And to expect that the town is going to bail you out now and bail you a stadium and you can't
throw a fly through the middle of pile there.
Forget about it.
It's not going to happen.
All these assholes.
Oh, well, if they were just put it here if they would put it here.
Yeah, I know where you can put it.
Keep inside your rectum.
Ask that's where you can put it.
And it's still ain't going to be nobody's show up.
Even the athletes won't show up.
So, all's cause.
They're just interested in different things here.
We don't know what those things are yet.
The research is still going on on that.
I've spent almost 25 years research to find out what those things are besides early
brews.
What they care about.
But we still can't put our thumb on it.
27 after 10 at 560 WQMI.
This is T Gordon Litty and they don't come any worse than Neil Rogers.
Waitress.
I'm going downtown.
Say you'd be good.
Did he say you'd get sweet savers?
Did you say you'd been on the side of this city?
Did he give me about 1,000, 20,000?
No.
So they sit inside the booth.
Give me some time.
I won't find me.
I've been in the G.D.
You've been in the G.D.
You've been in some G.D.
That will be just none of these.
It's not what you want to see.
It's a captain or a green dot.
Even if it's a city.
So either what you need.
And you say I need to go away.
It's a two-barter thing.
It's a volcano.
It's a volcano.
While the cops are rated, I will swear the gas.
And I can't see.
It's a dinosaur.
It's a dinosaur.
I'm a cannibal.
It's a delicious.
I've listened when you hear a TV, you hear it's gone.
It's very revenge.
I was wrong.
I said my car is for the crime.
That's too bad I ain't lying.
Now I lost the food that's good.
But I have to keep walking.
And will be too much pressure to be I say good.
But that's the daddy.
Once, let me tell you man.
So I said to my brother, I had to real grand slam.
You see that?
I'm a rapper?
I'm a singer.
I said to get a horse.
The oxygen is there.
The gaining dark.
If you don't get any answer on me, if I'm a singer, I'm a singer, you see, and it's trying to get it, even if you do it.
10.31 at 5.60 Q. And we're going to be doing a 15-part series on what guys trying to sound as a little bit as dumb shards, it's going to be pretty interesting.
5.67.01. Well that's a new thing now, trying to sound like a little bit of a shards. This is what Younger White America emulates.
We've got 16 votes in our survey already, which applies to you. Went to another college, 11, never went to college 4, and went to UN1.
1. But we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we got Rob, we, we, we, we, we, us, we, yeah, and we're going to win. We, Tony, this town is as Tony is in 86 and a half dollar bill.
It's just, it's just, it's just a music, especially these sports nerds. Oh, whipped up into a frenzy about, about the BCS pole.
Me and they got all kinds of like real major league professional sporting events going on. How they going to know?
No, no. They're sitting on the rash with a guy, their mobile phones stuck in the rear.
Here's a mobile in Miami Lake. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes. How you doing?
Okay. I'm calling about those citrus canker guys, you know, they were by my house and they have eight trees that they bought up north.
And I bought them in central Florida. Yes. They're out of the citrus country. I brought them down here, I planted them myself.
And they don't have any canker, anything. And the guy said, well, they're going to have to come down anyway.
And they caught about about 60 bucks a piece. And the guy, the guy just went away, got a little piece of the tree or something to the wood.
And now it's stuck a big paper in front of my crop door. You know, it's like a really good on there. I guess I didn't want it to blow away, but it blew a little.
It's a mess. Nice. And I think there's something weird going on around here. You know, that because I have some people on this.
And this, this canker stuff been around for you forever. You know, they treated like it's a big epidemic or something.
And I think what they read out is all those people that have trees in the backyard, you know, so they don't have to reach in there and get some views out of the.
Or put them out in front of a little stamp to sell them to people on the street. They want to eliminate all that.
Yeah. That's right. You know, you know, a lot of those little kids out of business. They all set up their one and eight stand. That's right.
Yeah. Yeah. That's it. All those kids. So you have to go straight to them. And then you know what's going to happen to the price.
You got it. So I was thinking of going in front of the commission, but they told me that there to be sure there and.
A major analysis. Growing up. He's throwing up on some kind of a yeah, some kind of a thing to raise all the commission of salaries.
Not 20 or 30, but 100%. And at the same time, he wanted to review the salary for the next four years.
And I'm going to bring it in front of the commissioners themselves. They're going to vote on the salary. So pretty good chat with the.
I think. Well, good luck to us and don't bend over. Don't. Don't bend down. Have a great. Yeah. Eight million dollars added to East Cancel losses.
Bowen data received in the fusion of eight million dollars in the state to help homeowners plant new greenery in place of citrus trees lost to the controversial war on Cancel.
Governor Bush and agriculture commission Bob Crawford said on Wednesday, this will be an addition to the $100 for property Wal-Mart voucher program.
All of this is a scam. Just a big scam. Hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. It's cost of taxpayers already.
Based on a totally flawed theory that the suffocates the canker is going to spread, which it doesn't and can't and won't.
It's just I didn't want to move the stuff. It's it's got to be. Maybe Dr. Marvin has got some an update on his campaign to.
Yank the Jebs to out there get him impeached cost out on his ass.
What did I call Marvin? Marvin. No, remember if he Jewish just just leave our students alone. Okay. Well, you'll be though. Just to the worry about it. Marvin and Melvin's all the same family.
560.560 on the 18t and Verizon wireless line. I need to make a new deal but it looks like Bush is going to win.
What? What? What do you mean? It looked like that. Okay. I think yours were going to win. Is that you feel better now? It looks like Bush is going to win. He's a hidden every pool.
Not in every state pool. Thank God. But anyway, now I grant you its post. Please edit and every one of the polls.
Now the new CBS pool. Of course, we know that there are a bunch of communists. The new CBS pool, which I do love CBS news. And I think that they're right on target.
Bush 44, go for the three, native for and Buchanan's got 2%. I think a lot more of those right wingers are be voting for Pat Buchanan. Don't you? Yeah. Why do you push people? He's not extreme enough for you guys.
If you want the real hydra camera, the one with the real God that that's the one with the SS on it, you better vote for Pat. God damn it.
Yeah, I think Bush is going to win. So unfortunate. Somebody sent me a profile of my good friend Dick Putin, but you want me to see him Detroit. Anybody remember Dick?
Used to call the show all the time had that vacation spot over there, vacation home and sandable. Used to call us all the time. Haven't heard from Dick in at least two years. And I see why in this extensive interview, it says favorite radio format, anything that comments and likes aside from that, I listen to a lot of talk radio doesn't mention my name.
Came down here. I don't know how many times when he called me, both an I would be in over here uses the best talk radio in America. That's what he would say to me. It's coming from Dick. I was quite a compliment from a good friend Dick Putin. He doesn't mention me here in this big interview. I guess you don't want to be embarrassed mentioning my name. I understand.
Now he did this like bonus. So in the Godfather, he didn't want to be in my death. I understand. What have been dangerous?
Here's a lady in Hollywood. Hello. Yes, ma'am.
You can see the Roger. It sounds like me. Good. I wrote you a letter concerning later. You get it? I don't know. Well, he was on a program where what's his name? So down a few. Yeah.
So down a few said that the Jews were out even a side on here, but okay, I look they had another piece of women also to go this morning. They were going to announce it this morning. And then they said, oh, wait a minute. We're having a little bit of the day in that press conference. And next thing, you know, another bombing, another crowd bombing and two more people killed into Jerusalem.
I'm telling you, it's pointless. It's an exercise that is useless. There will never be Middle East peace. That's an oxymoron. If there ever was an effect, if you want to definition of oxymoron, you look up the dictionary. It says Middle East peace is an oxymoron. It doesn't exist. It never will. You deal with a bunch of crazy people over there.
So you're barking up the wrong tree. Go talk to Jewelman about it. Okay, sweetheart. Don't bother me with your Middle East. I can't have no time for it.
And what a crime that the whole world, the security of the whole world has to be held hostage. Six billion people crawling around in this planet have to be held hostage because there are three religious groups, fanatic nuts, all obsessed about that stupid little piece of desert there.
Second, really sick. So now to make me want to go home and bring George in here to talk about how great the Palestinians are, but I'm not going to do it.
I'm not that sick about it. 21 before 11 at 5. 60 WQAM.
Let's start.
First made spot in cotton games. It's way. It's way.
Who's a claim has gone down in flames. It's way. It's way.
The shame of rain will stay upon my rage. I think it's profit. The strain of the way that's changed.
17 tell over at 5. 60 Q and split away. Boca resort loses 27.6 million bucks. Boca resort's in owner of Boca.
Return resort and clutter put it lost at 27.6 million dollars or 60 attempts to share for the quarter ended September 30th.
The Boca return base company also owns the Florida Panthers hockey team. Boca resorts revenue was historically lowest during the September 30th period because of the week summer demand at seven.
And because the panthers recognize revenue during the season which begins during the fiscal second quarter.
Whatever that means. I got news for you when you got real choice baby and the word I'm hearing from everybody in their brother is he is dying to dump that team.
You just be a lot of the whole thing when it does get to hell out.
Here's a fact some pissed off and keep cool. Says if anyone wonders why B3 stock is in the dumper.
And it was just over seven I believe wait a minute.
7 and 13 16. Yeah Joe's got a gun to his head.
It's a dispose of the 7.70 a.m. and you'll find out why I'm sure you know by now that unannounced yesterday the station brain trust decided to preamp your program yet another time.
The last I was going to play by a sex talk show the host got some nasty calls from the students seem quite upset.
It seems the station management forgot to tell them they were placed in the last of your show.
It boggles my mind how anyone with a half a brain can preamp the highest-related talk show in Florida to put that crap on the air.
W.W.C. and currently runs a liner that says if the check clear is well errant.
It's an absolute truth that's what they're running our liner says if the check clears little error.
I've called the station but get the PD's voice mail of course he never calls anybody back if I would advertise the one that station I would ask for my money back.
So I'm pissed off and keep cold. Yeah.
So we apologize again to all our friends over there when it was coast we have nothing to do with it in fact they don't even have the courtesy to tell us when they oppose crap.
They just they owe anybody they just go ahead and do it.
We're in programming.
You can't complain about their video knowledge at the B.C. headquarters because they don't have any.
They could be running a Chinese laundry and have the same amount of knowledge they don't nothing about this business.

Samuel Ornitz Albert Malts alphabetsi lester co-herbered beaverman and Edward Demetrick later write it on his fellow comedy pink or whatever they were.
During those other MacArthur days and of course if you like to go back to the MacArthur days and those were chunked if you embrace with that right wing fanatic or hateful mentality of the Christian right these good.
Bible pumping assholes with the crutches and both of us next to them all means go right ahead because that's what it's about.
It's part of the fact that you may be giving yourself a big son of anx about well you know you don't like the you don't like the tax structure the way it is now and you don't like the inheritance tax you should have the crap I was getting there last night at the game again.

I mentioned it because you're for a crap I do care about is money money money money it's always the rich people it's always the rich people who otherwise if they want so
fortunate to have all that money they'd be a hell of a lot more liberal.
They'd be running with both hands to vote for any Democrat but once they got the big bucks I don't want to mention any relatives of mine in hell and there but once they got the big box all of a sudden there's good
a little bit of a public interest of the time because it's all about one thing money money money it's all about that freaking dollar bill.
Well I wish I had my CD here I wish I had that the too much of heaven by I for 65 I'll bring them a lot.
No for some reason blue made a big over here by I for 65 but then the other this next hit too much of heaven never made it here and that's because of how early program directors like kid curry down the hall at power 96 playing it safe passifying those little

I don't think you respect when you're alive and you're driving well, guess what?
Today I was getting on 9.95 at Stirling and there was a Tremel procession, the far right lane on 95.
And 3 people cut in front of a funeral courtesan, in front of the, you know, in front of the
year procession.
I couldn't believe it.
These people were traumatized by all these cars and these trucks that had a cut in front
of them, they get in front of the funeral procession because it wasn't going fast enough.
It's just unbelievable, me.
I mean, I really am amazed at what people will do to ruin somebody's day.
When you're dead you can't even get a few things back down.
No, you know.
And the other thing I wanted to explain is that you're a real skunk bag.
I mean, in a small family, at least people are going, you're doing a lot of one and these people are like cutloons.
If you're just allowed to be doing that, but these people don't leave their drivers manuals.
You don't know what drivers manual.
How do you hear the drivers manuals?
Why do you hear the license in a box of cracker jacks?
There's no drivers manual in there, just the license.
That was awful.
And it's really hard.
And you know, what's the other thing I wanted to address is, I wish people who spoke cigarettes,
would take responsibility for their, for their habit by not chucking them out the windows, you know.
And they've got to, and by not suing the tobacco companies, I'm sure Bush ain't too happy about that.
All those lawsuits.
That's why they want to put reform so that they can't sue anybody.
But, you know, crypto is the tobacco companies.
It says right there's got a big scale on the crossbones.
And it says if you smoke these, it's going to kill you and everybody else around you.
So it's crypto suing everybody.
No, they don't care.
And why do you like gay men?
Why don't gay men vote for Gore?
What does that mean?
Because they don't like Bush.
Uh-huh.
Hey, you know, you have a great birthday and it was good talking to you on the first time call.
I let's see your old time.
I got up enough guts to give you call.
Okay.
Okay, care.
Bye bye.
Say bye bye about 15 seconds too late.
Was that amusing?
No.
No, no.
Pretty old.
Pretty still.
And the joke too.
5.6705.60, 0.560 on the 18 and teen Verizon.
I thought maybe we're going to say they vote for Gore because they don't like Taylor
Baham.
That might be it.
They don't like Jerry Farlow and they don't like Pat Robertson and they don't like
all those other white wing.
They don't like Gary Bauer.
They might like Papa Bauer and they might like, uh, word Bauer.
But they're not too crazy about Gary Bauer.
And there's white wing, goody, two shoes, hate mongrel.
We don't get through all of that.
And you're really when you sit down and you examine the various groups who have very
vexed interest in not voting for Bush and then take a look at these polls and see where
this thing is going and probably will go.
You say, hang.
You start wondering if the fix is in.
Here's Naples.
Hello?
Yeah, Neil.
Happy return.
Thank you.
Neil, I found interesting letters in the letter in the 10th of the day by the undersecretary
and communist and the regular administration.
You basically agree with you that compassionate conservatives and the same as trickle-down economics.
Uh-huh.
You also go on to say a stupid cliche.
That's all we got from this guy's cliche.
Yeah.
Packed about ending, ending partisan division and Washington and Washington insiders and
big government.
He got a half a dozen of the same trite cliches and R is a big pile of duty.
That's what it always is.
Well, we're going to keep coming back with it so people believe it, Neil.
Well, the kitchen seems to work for it.
But he also says that the tax cuts in the estate tax elimination is this week fiscal
assimilation and economic policy.
Yeah, I know some people are real excited about that.
He also says that through our private party, part of the social security would undermine
the system while ending a windfall to Wall Street.
And the same on the same note.
Well, we think he's doing it.
We think it's all about him.
It's about all his good corporate buddies on Wall Street about big corporations.
That's what he's all about.
That's what it's all campaign is all about.
Don't confuse these people with the fact they love the most tobacco company.
They love the big world companies.
They love paying two bucks for gallon of gas.
They love paying like five, six, ten times more than they should for pharmaceutical drugs.
They love that.
It must be the case because that's the reason that they're all calling here just busted
everybody's balls, all the crazy bush people.
That's what we've had 90% of it for the last day after day after day.
Does it make any impact on us?
No, it just shows you what a bunch of answers they are.
Called defending the indefensible.
That's what their comments are attempting to do.
Defending the indefensible.
Just like the guy for hockey game, I said I want some mentioned wrong by name again.
Papa, papa, papa, papa, papa.
Let's not talk about it.
It's never, papa, papa, papa, you know, certain and again.
This can't control himself.
You know, your surface, your load of revenge.
Give a lot of my inner charity because it's tax deductible because it was a reputurity
years like the smooze, like the suck up.
Sad, very sad to me.
The poor and the poor and the poor and the poor and the poor and the poor and the poor and

Here's South Miami. Hello.
Hello. Yes sir. How you doing?
Okay. I'm still about to be a medical doctor.
Yeah.
We're not going to talk about that.
Okay. I understand where you're saying.
Okay. So you people are a lot of call here and start with a sock in your purse.
I'm not interested. Why are we that long after the first two seconds you should have
that. You're not that long after the first two seconds you should have that. You're not that long after the first two seconds you should have

It's verifiable, you know, it's for real.
It's not some part of the thing.
So if anybody is still trying to decide,
check out realchange.org, the skeleton closet,
and you'll see it for yourself.
What this guy is really about.
Okay, thanks.
All right.
See ya.
Now let's see, here's a fact from Fort Myers.
It says, I know you make us less close talks
out to be bad guys, but we do love you over here.
Just don't know what to do.
The stock show from the one is in inconvenience,
but we need you back from one to two.
Now there's the soul of the time one to two spot over here
to some pecker outfit, whatever that hell I mean.
That we had a suffer through yesterday.
Little by little, they're pushing you away from us
and I resetted.
I want you to listen.
One listen to you, and they're showing us
that they pretty much intended to wear
the new watches in the worst clothes.
We enjoy a program, feel a loss,
that you are slipping away from us.
And yada, yada, yada,
please advise we don't want to lose you.
Or what am I going to tell you?
What advice can I give you?
They don't give a crap about what I say.
They just just sit there running to make the leaf station
over there with our phantom skeleton staff,
make the leaf equipment just like we have over here
and pretending to be broadcast.
And that's why their stock is in the toilet,
a little bit under eight bullets.
Like seven and something, 16 fractions.
They're in the crapper because they're not fooling anybody.
All anybody has to do a turn on that thing over there
and see the garbage that they put on here
that they produce.
You got the gin garbage out,
they're only different from being that way
and made some money with it.
That's the difference.
Here's a mobile in 10th of a time, tell us.
Oh, yes sir.
Yeah, yes.
How you doing?
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
First time caller.
Screw politics.
We need a hockey coach.
Yeah.
One of the one is,
IZenga even gonna look at this
and get rid of a beautiful breath of.
I think very similar.
I think another one or two losses
and I think you're gonna see in both the rule.
And I think you're gonna see
you're gonna see it all right here
and there last night's yuppering through that
of the New Zealanders.
And Paris and Krovasher looked better than our whole team.
Well, they didn't really play all I could either.
One of them last night.
They spent a lot of time in the penalty box.
But I mean, no, the team looked horrible
and they just aren't playing for this guy
and the changes have to be made
and they're just as a lack of talent.
I keep telling people that all the time
you can't have a team with two or three guys
and everybody else is marginal for non-existent.
They got to agree.
They've got too many floaters on that team.
Too many guys who were not productive.
I don't wanna mention Robbie
and Spaylon, those guys again,
but they just held on to some of these gifts too long
and they're non-productive.
Definitely.
Especially the way I saw it,
the other one was really good.
I just said that.
Yeah, it's happened to other teams and great.
Yeah, I'm gonna go all out.
Hot Simpson's going to better than him.
He puts away his own crease.
He throws it right in the form.
Definitely.
Well, I just wasn't dealing with coaching.
He said better.
I'm moving for the caps on Saturday
because I think that'll put us right over the air.
I think that'll get the movies on the bus.
I agree with it.
Okay, we'll have a good birthday.
Thanks.
Bye.
Yeah, that's what it takes to say.
Bye, bye, bye to the motorboys
because they really screwed this one up big time.
I mean, we've got the disaster out there.
I just it's tragic.
And yeah, and you know, you look at the empty seats.
That's lots of lanes looking at the bottom line.
That's all he cares about.
One win in the 11 games.
Nobody in the stands and he's not going to be too
patient all-balled because he's already trying to bail out.
And what's always you're going to have to sell
if he's got a real tricky on the stands.
If he's got to bring in somebody with a brain
who can turn this thing around and bring in some guy
to tell the support group,
not just Brewery and Whitney and Whitney and Brewery
and Roberto L'Awango, that kid playing great.
But other than that,
he can't complain about the hockey base
with fans down here because there is no money.
So you got to win some games and nobody's
going to be in that joint.
22 before 2 if I have 60 WQM.
Come on down on my phone.
June four hours of the hottest talk on radio.
The doctor, the assistant.
My doctor, the scope, my name is Narian.
I'm a third-time scholar.
Come on, Narian, how may I help you?
Well, I've found that I wanted my son's room.
He's only 14 and I'm concerned.
You should be concerned.
Are you masturbating?
No. How would that help?
Nance to bait and call me in a couple of weeks.
It will help.
Trust me on that.
How long you're on hand with Dr. Visco?
Yeah, I, Dr. Visco.
Yes, it is.
Yes, my name is Jerry.
I talked to you a while ago.
I was having some financial problems with my business.
It was about to go under.
And how are things going now with the business?
I just thought, you know, I started masturbating.
And business is going great.
It's really picking up.
It's really.
I just wanted to thank you.
Terrific.
You cute masturbating things will go well.
How long you're on me?
Dr. Visco, week is it noon?
OK, over on the West Coast, I believe you start tomorrow, any?
142 at 560, WQAM, 560, 7.0560, Pond 560 on the AT&T
and for Rhymes and Marlospine.
Here we are just five days away from D-Day.
Hi.
Hi.
And we've had the worst collector of misfits
today that I can recall in the long time.
I mean, the last two weeks it hasn't been exactly great
to say the best.
But today I think we really hit the crack of the eject parts.
Here's Cutler Ray, Jello.
Yeah, no, no, no.
I want to think, I think a version of the part of the global
Zionist conspiracy.
Oh, global Zionist conspiracy, yeah.
I don't care all white people.
Oh, OK, Ray.
We'll be right down to Syria.
560 at 0560, Pond 560 on the AT&T
and for Rhymes and Marlospine.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Yeah, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, did you, you were at the hockey game,
but Rivera finally got into it the last few nights.
And he had Jesse Jackson and Follow-O on last night.
Yeah.
And for those people that think that bushes away from Follow-O
or them, Jackson finally go to him
into declaring that he would, that Follow-O
would love seven Scalia on the Supreme Court.
Yeah.
And how he thinks how wonderful that bushes and how he's
going to win.
And those people are way behind.
They're salivating.
That's what they're waiting for.
This is back up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did you didn't see Marlospine this morning?
I had a call about it though.
You did.
Good for Marlosp.
Thank you.
That's right.
Thanks for the good news.
Thanks, Neil.
And then of course tonight Larry's got Ross Peele.
He's going to come on in.
Do you think he's going to endorse Goll?
No.
I'll tell you if he puts that little foot on the night
and he endorses Bush, because they're both from Texas.
They're kissing cousins from Texas.
He puts Peele on here and kisses Bush's ass.
That's going to be really disgusting.
Nice to on you, Larry.
Wouldn't surprise me.
I mean, after all, why should it shock anybody?
He allowed them to use his program time and time and time.
And what he put him on, like, 175 times back in 92.
And 12 times in 97.
Use his program to bring Washington Public
with his role at the Slaven's, and do do do do.
And his glittering generalizations of Kaka
make him no sense whatsoever.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hi, my name is?
Yes, sir.
Hey, Neil, how are you doing?
OK.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
This is Kaka, the last hour of your show.
But this presidential election is obviously a travesty
and a nervous breakdown for most.
Plus everything that has to go on, I just don't understand
how the American people, and what
are African vote for Bush at all.
And this is a story that's frightening me
is that when you look at the people
and they ask them on the street, why are you voting for Bush
or they can't vote them?
There's a hot kind of glows over their eyes,
you know, like a shepherd.
Why is that?
Exactly.
Yeah, they relate to them.
It's just like an autonomous, I don't know what it is.
So really, like, people Christian born again
or they just don't have a brain or a...
Maybe they put something in the water.
I know we have a lot of dumb people out there.
It's an epidemic from coast to coast,
but maybe they put something in the water.
Could be.
I have an idea that it is frightening
because the message that it's sending
to not only everybody around them, to the high of the brain,
and to the world is that.
Yeah, but whoever said the American electorate had a brain.
Who else had that?
Well, that's true, but you know,
I listen to all these commentators on there again.
They talk mostly about who looked the most comfortable,
who looked the most nervous,
and grow a little bit to aggressive,
and he walked over during the debate,
now discussing that was,
and you know, all these cosmetic stupidity
other things as opposed to where the hell are they coming from
and who are the people who are behind them?
Right.
Well, I would hope that all the...
all the senior generations that are coming up,
I would be hoping that they're not acceptable
to swallowing the same old BS
that's been perpetrated on the older generations
through, you know, the people from the spirit.
No, more like they say that.
You think that the younger people
are more politically sophisticated?
But who are you dreaming?
Well, no, that's not the most of this,
they're segregated, but I think they have an ability
to see positive BS.
No, absolutely not.
Absolutely positively not.
You don't think that?
They're in Lollawland, and I'll just say again,
25% of the 18 to 23 year olds
at MPD per 25% couldn't even name both candidates
or presidents.
Right.
Well, you know, then that's...
It's a sad commentary that, you know,
the corporate America's plan is going to continue.
So the game plan is keep the public ignorant.
They're doing a magnificent job of a best...
that's the American game plan.
Keep the sparsers as dumb as can be,
keep them in the ghetto, keep people under the thumb
of the federal government,
keep them as stupid uninformed, uneducated,
and let the special interest run the show.
And no matter which one wins,
the special interest will still be run the show,
but it's a matter of degree.
And of course, if Bushwin, then it's like,
you're going to be a blind check.
So other things that are repulsive and repulsive to me
and a lot of other people,
but to me in particular,
Ron, 5.6705.60,
pound 5.60 on the AT&T and Verizon Marlos line.
Here's a mobile and less palm, hello?
How you doing?
Okay, sir.
The abortion issue does hit home kind of close to me
before it wasn't legal.
It became legal in 74.
I did have a number of my family have to fly to Puerto Rico
to have a procedure done.
So women better get their butts in gear
and vote for Gore before they lose the rights that they have.
And on a side note,
the guy that called before told me
that the mob is about the funeral procession on 9.95.
I almost killed the jackass riding the tail end
of a funeral procession last week
as I was getting on 9.95 to 65 miles an hour
and they're doing a procession at 30.
And I told him, I turn around when I pass
and then told him he was number one,
but I called on Howard Patrol
about to see what the situation is.
There against the mob that have those professions on 9.95
and the supervisors at Howard Patrol told me that
if you see them on 9.95,
you get the names of the motor plate
and the name is the motorcycle company doing the escort
and reported into the Howard Patrol and Rob.
So it's illegal for them to be on an interstate?
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.
The guy who's me is the guy who's already dead,
what's the hurry to bury him?
Why do they have to do it on 9.95?
He got hit in mind one way or the other.
He can wait a little bit longer.
And that's what I say.
What's to what's racer-like?
That's right.
So keep them off at 9.95.
And next time, if she runs, drag the ranch off the road,
they won't be doing it again.
That's right.
Do that or kill the guy on the end.
How about that?
Yeah, that's right.
Maybe they can make it a two-foot one special.
That's a good one.
There you go.
There you go.
And closing, read my lips, both go.
OK.
Take care.
Thanks.
5670560, 0.560 out of whack.
Actually, somebody say both go ahead of the day.
That's unusual.
We have almost all bush people, almost all feeder
sugars.
You know, just like when we try to take a pool on here,
which you notice I don't waste my time doing that anymore
because you can't do it because they all
loaded up there with a bush crap.
They get on their little emails.
Start to get people holding on up,
pour a stick in and those in who don't even
have never heard of me, don't know what the show is.
They're rabid.
And these are the same right.
When everybody was terrified of eight years ago
and scared crap was out four years ago,
when Papi Kanagat up there and made that
a off Hitler-like speech at their convention.
And now all of a sudden, everybody just
thinks they're like, those people all went away.
They have nothing to do with any of this.
Guess what?
Wrong.
Wrong.
They just wait and free to lend them a helping hand.
10, 4, 2, here's the Gallup tracking call today.
48 to 43 for bush.
She's had an every single pool.
4.5 points, whatever it is.
I just don't see unless there's some dramatic change
over the weekend, even with the native hope
that they're factored in there,
even assuming that the law of those come back.
I just don't see it.
It looks like you went for four years of bush.
Of course, can have a good stretcher.
Face down more.
Face down, I got my fingers and toes crossed.
Oh, you say you say what's that's tremendous.
Examine enthusiasts and like almost like you might believe it.
Works with the Yankees.
Yeah.
I got news for him, the Yankees.
10, 4, 2, 5, 60 W to kill him.
Does he look like Bernie Williams?
No.
Does he look like Derek Geter?
No.
Maybe if we pick up the handle of a band
through it at George W.
That might give him some respect.
I know that the Lord even loves you, Rodgers.
George, what's going on here is a pizza.
Yeah.
George, what's going on here is a pizza.
Yeah.
George, what's going on here is a pizza.
George, he's doing it is a pizza.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The rich boy will bet that they both can't chunky.
But he's gonna do it all.
That can't pay money.
He's gonna give us weapons.
That's not the people going up.
We'll go for the museum with some stuff.
We can't find you, that's shit.
It's just a bit.
We look in all over and it's still right here.
Hey, George, you knew it was a cheap one.
You were right that you signed up.
That you did well.
You were all rich, college, with a token party.
And you can't catch compensation as well.
I don't wish to try you.
You can hire a judge.
You can donate tax, livid, and a bit extra.
George, George, you're in the pizza.
What?
George was chewing at the pizza
their tastes are so big.
George was chewing at the pizza.
George you're going to him isn't pizza.
George was chewing at the pizza.
The men's a ears are what you're in the pizzaism.
Yes.
George was chewing at the pizza.
George you're going to him holiday
Apply to my PC, don't you.
développame i
a bush piece of propaganda under our door. What was that? A calendar or something?
Just one of those cards. Just a sign? Yeah.
So Robert Greber is already gone and a home in Joe Rose. Little Bob is already gone.
So let's have Gelly and they left out here together on and on.
So I couldn't have been in one of them. So we got some other figurative wood pile in here, huh?
We're going to have to do, and you have any idea what was?
Could be John Jarris. He's a bush guy.
John Jarris is a bush guy.
Wow.
It reminds me of something that Martin Luther Croom once told me he said, never trust a boy.
Anyway, here's a thanks from Jim Wall. Should we have tremendously here on this program?
So thanks to the set of him, so on. He says, if you could, we need another favor.
I know he's not your favorite person, but Joe, do you leave him in?
We'll be able to get out to the well tomorrow. If you can help any answer, of course, is no.
No. No. I'm here in this up before I would tear up that bush thing he's gotten there.
I am not promoting any. Without respect, Jim, ask me anything else. Do not ask me to promote anything involved with jewelry vermin.
The answer is absolutely positively.
No, no. He makes my skin crawl. He is positively the most grotesque, the most weasley, the most embarrassing piece of turd.
He is just ignosier. He is. I can't find a word to describe him.
Slub. Flameel. Shminderick.
Never. That's a word. Never. She is a never. He just looked at him. And the word, huh? You know what that word is? Well, look it up.
Here's a lady mevel in Miami. Hello.
Lady mevel. Hello. Yes, man. Good afternoon, Mio.
Yes, ma'am. First of all, I want to go out there to you. Thank you.
And secondly, when you were talking about bumpers, keepers, I do have bumpers, keepers of those go on the women.
Wow. And I was going, excuse me. I said you must be the one.
That's probably. Don't you have any bumpers, because they're either way.
