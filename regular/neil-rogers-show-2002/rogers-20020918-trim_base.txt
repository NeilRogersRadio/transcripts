In July, a noodle shop owner in southern Guangxi was arrested on charges that he poisoned
customers at a rival business by putting rat poison in its soup.
Nobody died but 57 people were hospitalized and complaining about the bitter taste.
The poison used on Saturday was called douxu quang, which is made with tetramine, which
attacks the nervous system.
The poison was banned in 1991.
The poisons have occurred in China as it prepares for the 16th Congress of the Communist Party
during which a major reshuffle of China's leadership is expected.
China's Ministry of Propaganda has recently admonished China's journalists, all of whom
work for the state to limit their reports about negative issues, like people being poisoned
in a competing eatery, little stuff like that.
Why, notice that poll is sure to take him a long time to get up there today.
You think that maybe Eric's overslept today?
Maybe.
I'll cool him.
Now you don't have to call him.
He's on it.
Maybe I should read it one more time.
Maybe he's confused.
Maybe he's pissed because I didn't fax it to him this morning.
Well, I was, see, I'm not going to have time to be faxing too many polls to Eric because
now we have these very important confeds.
First, we have the sales people come in.
They're especially PD Lenny, who I never want to hear from again.
And then we get now, not just one program director, but we get two of them for the price
of one.
We get clearance in there and then we get Duff.
And by the way, Duff, I'm not patching around with the engineers at one o'clock.
Let them deal with the engineer up here.
Okay.
Let him deal with it.
Don't you think that's a good idea?
Yeah.
Sure.
What did I say?
See, we got the sales people that want me to make up the copy for them.
And now I got the engineering people want me to be the engineer for them too.
I don't think so.
I'm in a wrong union for all that stuff.
926 at 560.
You see, two can play a hard ball.
Okay.
Two can play that game.
I'm just, I'm laying out one o'clock.
I'm out the door.
I'm going to lunch.
See you, Duff.

important listener survey as we try to find out why I'm new into one hours down and
of course that all goes back to Greg Reed messing with our schedule again but I love 9-1
I wouldn't go back to 10-2 for all the money in the world.
Sure did it turn around on that did I?
Yeah you got to try new things got to give him a chance before he starts to remember

Oh we don't like this way of this sucks well too bad okay I like it I like it it's my
life it's my freaking job it's my show I like it 15 votes Neil with listen to the needle
10 10 out of 15 it's not too good that's only two thirds.
See what I'm saying well you know remember you got the game players I don't have a
rush now rush to other one Bill or Rattie one in music one so in other words now a 9-1
is enough for them and that big noon to one hour.
I'm gonna start working on that because it blows.
Actually noon to one hour is pretty damn good I use it if you've been turning it out
you're missing all the good stuff but that's okay here's some good stuff that you're
like Sunday season premier of these sopranos was the oh and guess what I saw last night
an old soprano's episode oh that was on two it's on every night in fact which I saw
about two minutes of it again I couldn't stand it it was the one where he was chewing
the mouth because they're not making enough money and he was throwing the bucket of ice
at the bartender oh yeah that was the new one that was the new one that was the
one from this Sunday oh I see the bartender's always getting hit with things like phone see you
know what this reminds me of it's like mash to me I'm just giving you my own personal perspective
mash everybody watch mash I hate it mash you don't have a perspective yes I do I don't
it's on every single night they got a different episode on my movie channels you have a watch
can't stick with it long enough to get into I don't like it you haven't watched it I don't want
to see it you haven't watched it you are the biggest little hard I'm telling you it's the
best thing the summer season premiere of these sopranos was in addition to which the thing where he's
hitting the guy with the ice bucket it was still obviously a ripoff of the thing where sonny is
hitting Carla Carlo in the godfather with the lid from the a trash can watching disjointed you
ever touched my sister again out you're watching disjointed images I will not watch it all right can
I get through this story that we only got to eleven o'clock for this stuff in addition to which
they're going to start turning off at eleven o'clock you keep this up all right Sunday season
premiere of the sopranos was the most watch show in AB HBO's 30 year history and whacked every
network show in its time slot the fourth season premiere averaged 7.9 million households that's
a whopping 13.4 million viewers from nine to 10 pm as the mobsters on pro'sax series returned
after 60 multilaytas this is my Michael star in today's New York post more impressive is that HBO
is seen in only a third of the homes they get ABC CBS NBC and Fox and the sopranos beat its
competition on all those networks how do you like that I like it a lot everything comes to a
stump see now I didn't have to read this story I pick and choose here whatever the hell I want to
put on here and then the fact that I don't enjoy it or I'm not watching and what does that have to
do with the price of peace nothing it's news the show even bested ESPN's traditionally top-rated
Sunday night NFL game was averaged eleven point three million viewers and the 13.4 million viewers
who watched the sopranos on Sunday dwarfed the number for last seasons premiere which then
eight eleven point three million viewers and six point eight million households keep track of
these numbers right them down all right on Sunday show mob boss Tony soprano dealt with money
problems his wife his wild-child daughter uh meadow was deciding what to do with her life and
Christopher continued to take care of business and feed a growing drug habit also back with Tony's
wacky sister Janice and the rest of the sopranos crew including poly walnuts in jail in Ohio
Sylvio and Ralph the sopranos has been off the air since wrapping its 30s May 2001
sir with creator David chase that he needed more time to sculpt the fourth season and zephyrd's
appear to have paid off the mobsters easily blew away their rivals after the sp a and game came
well I forget about that but now maybe people want to know after the football game NBC's law and
order criminal intent at 10.8 million viewers followed by foxes the lost world 9.4 million ABC's
nodding hill 7.9 so you never let me just tell you what I saw last night what did you see last night
I saw us and it gets another one of those movie channels and I have no idea why they show all
these episodes it was the last episode a small bill oh yeah it was w it was wb I have no idea why
it's an i movie channel I guess they just show or whatever they want to show they're showing
um previews for they're going to start the series over again like like syndicated syndicated
something like that from the very beginning again on the video down here so anyway I had forgotten
how traumatic that last episode was it's a good thing I saw because it gets me ready for next
Tuesday's first episode of this season yes or they pick up where what's his name Lex Luthor's
father is obnoxious nasty father is lying there cut on the uh that thing out of that beam
and Lex has got the blood pouring from his eye and given him that evil eye look you know
and then of course what's your name Talana yes is that her name Lana Lang she's uh in that red
pickup truck that she burrowed from Janet and that thing is the tornado is blowing that thing
now this is interesting because Clarkor course can't fly yet yet and the tornadoes have taken that
thing and picked it up right in the air and she's inside yet but can't he leap really high well he can
leap he in fact he's uh got leapy lee with a misthenus episode he's doing leaping at tall bounds
and so he's got to take care of her and then what's his name Whitney I guess he must not go to be on
this season the blonde kid yeah who I used to think wasn't too bad looking but after seeing him last
night they meet him I still run out of makeup because they had to have all the special effects but he's
looking pretty nasty but anyway he went off to join the army or something didn't he
I don't I she drove him to the bus station and they said a tearful goodbye and he said to Clark
I've been really nasty to yada yada yada yada I apologize and take care of Lana and Clark said oh I
you but I will although I couldn't get laid names to name you said
now I mean that you know look but of course it's a fantasy show so why should he be uh getting a
lot of action okay you don't want your superhero to be getting laid why not what about Dean what
about Dean Kane when at the what now what was the name of that superman sure who was the Clark
okay did he get laid on there I I don't know I only watched like one and a half episodes of that
I mean he looks pretty good with a lot of makeup I think I think they were working towards it but I
know if they actually ever wound up in the sack they were working on it low as in clock right
they were having a romance in other words but I don't know if they actually did it oh brother well
it's a good thing they're not doing it now because you don't understand John Ascroft announced

gathering which is what organizers requested but several people in the crowd live marijuana cigarettes
marijuana is illegal as a medicine or as a recreational drug under federal law but

always the battle cry it's right states right yeah states right when it came to abortion
whether it came to anybody's indivisible right women's right all now states rights which of course
was a code word for racism and the sexism and any other is a homophobia you name it but now all
of us said we got a different story to help with states rights because we got this war on drugs
going on baby nobody's gonna dick with us marijuana is illegal as a medicine or as a recreational
drug under federal law but state law and county and city ordinances say it's illegal if recommended
by a doctor dea spokesman Richard Meyer said he was appalled by Tuesday's event and feared the
community is sending a dangerous message to children marijuana's and legal drug in this country
said in other words that would be like if they would have sat around drinking but wiser but lights
yes wouldn't that have been a dangerous message to send a children were there any children smoking pot
in that crowd no oh but Mike Carrella who helped distribute the marijuana said the only message
sent with that marijuana is medicine and Santa Cruz in many California communities local law
enforcement works closely with growers and distributors who helped sick people obtain marijuana
Cronen his colleagues didn't handle the marijuana Tuesday but stood in solidarity with the clinic
workers and users police chief Steve Belcher said his officers didn't plan to arrest registered
legitimate members picking up their medicine however he said this is not gonna be a smoke out at city
hall people showed up to smoke marijuana without a doctor's recommendation could face the rest

dea agents arrested the owners of a local pot farm and confiscated 130 plants have been
grown for uses medicine Alaska colorado Hawaii main Nevada Oregon and Washington also allow me
or wanted to be grown and distributed to people with a doctor's prescription and the federal government

the locker room at BC high where Talbot encouraged student athletes to improve their physical fitness
by wrestling one-on-one with him sometimes fat only in jog straps and then forcibly molested them
they must have been real rocket scientists you know it as the wrestling got more involved he'd say
it's hot in here and he progressively lose more and more clothing and encourage the student to do
the same the lawyers have citing the victim's allegations he'd say the bear skin made it more like a
street fight and would toughen them up then he'd pin the victim in a sexual position and sexually

much thank you good oh and you know that story by Ariana Huffington that you were gonna
fact me yesterday I said don't do it because I have another really good story about the
no well-bushed situation yes well I did have another good story but the fact is I read this
on the internet and I said gee I got to use this the Ariana Huffington a crack house divided yes
this is a great the column I now we're gonna have to this come from oh and you know something let me
plug my good friend Lynn Samuels who got candid wavc which he's got a great website have you ever
checked on her website do now let me ask you this also because her website has got links to all
of these different articles like the one I'm gonna read here and it's Lynn Samuel Samuel's
account by the way L Y N N Samuel's and Samuel's not count if you want to check it out how come we
can't do that how how do you have to get permission to do that not necessarily if you want to like
to make a link to like an article we could do that as a matter of fact we often do with some of
the articles that you we often do I don't know about often but sometimes get out of here you crazy
Eric's to visit knows god damn pizza burgers we don't often do that we put a link to that that one
article that that timeline that you read that we got all those calls about yeah he does time
about the Cheryl seal article right yes right so we do that he does that why can't we do that
every day like they do on the other websites and we have like eight billion hits on our work to do
it every day I mean but that would be but that would be good for him because we have 80 billion
people hitting on our website which would be great not that we don't have a lot now but we'd
have a lot more because then there'd be a reason for them to go on there why don't we just have a
link to wincelin Samuel Samuel's website that would be good I'm sure she'd be delighted to have
us do that she'd be ecstatic and how about a link to net what's the other one news uh uh uh uh uh
uh uh uh uh you know what I'm talking about yeah I know I wrote it down I can never think of that
I wrote it down to be this because I've got some kind of like a mental block on it it's called
something news I don't know I have it right here what is it somewhere see I tell you we don't
have time for those but maybe maybe the last hour to the news insider dot cjb dot net right let's
make sure he does both of those okay we can have that link the link to both of them just because
there's some phenomenal articles on there I don't have time to read all of them every day although
I got a facet of all of them here today which are a hell of a lot more important than playing a
bunch of stale old stuff that you know we've heard a million times although in that one
Ariana Huffington writes a crack house divided she says I feel nothing but sympathy and concern
for Noel Bush or latest stumble on the rocky road to recovery being caught with crack cocaine
to the drug rehab center shows that she's in desperate need of help as a parent I can easily
also empathize let me try it again as a parent I can easily also empathize with the anguish new
elves father Florida governor jab Bush must be experiencing and I'm in total agreement with
his insistence that his daughter substance abuse problem is a private issue but when I think about
the heartless stance the governor has taken toward the drug problems of those less fortunate and
well connected than his daughter my empathy turns to outrage while Noel has been given every
break in the book and then some her father has made it harder for others in her position to get
the help they need by cutting the budgets of drug treatment and drug court programs in his state
he's also actively opposed a proposed ballot initiative that would send an estimated 10,000
nonviolent drug offenders into treatment instead of jail I guess that's good for the aguse gets
the gander locked away of course jabs wildly inconsistent attitude on the issue treatment and
privacy for his daughter incarceration and public humiliation for everybody else is part in
parcel of the galling hypocrisy that infect america's insane drug war on every level the latest
example of this madness is last week's early morning DEA raids on a medical marijuana club in
Santa Cruz California that caters to terminally ill patients although the hospice style operation
has been lauded by local and for forced law enforcement officials for its carrying an ethical
approach federal agents stormed the place with guns drawn and chainsaws worrying leveling its
pod garden handcuffing ailing patients including a paraplegic and carting off its founder and director
valori corral a woman who's been called the Florence nightingale of the medical marijuana movement
so much for the bush administration's compassionate conservatism and its conservative
constituency back when he was running for president candidate bush declared that medical marijuana
is a states rights issue I believe he said each state can choose that decision as they so choose
although the mangled syntax makes it a little hard to tell exactly what he was getting at
it is consistent with is it consistent with lawing john ascroft or order a holy roller war against
cannabis clubs in california even though it's one of twelve states that have decriminalized use of
pod for medicinal purposes surely there has to be a better use of our limited law enforcement
resources than busting grievously ill cancer and aids patients searching for relief from their
suffering how about unearthing a terror cell or two and the white house continues to bombard us
with those offensive and expensive tv spots implying that youthful drug users like the well bush
are the moral equivalent of mohammadata maybe her uncle george can get her in their
audition for the next round of taxpayer funded ads sure pulling some crack out of her shoe while
saying i help blow up buildings or does that kind of overheated and stigmatizing rhetoric only
applied to those other non-boached family youthful drug users after all a glaring double standards
been the hallmark of our nation's drug policy for decades it's why african americans make up
only thirteen percent of the country's drug users but fifty five percent of those convicted a
drug possession and seventy four percent of those sent to jail on possession charges and why
the youthful indiscretions of the rich are routinely treated with a slap on the wrist and a ticket
to rehab while poor kids are shipped off to prison if americans drug laws were applied
consistently jabboshenous family would be evicted from their publicly funded digs just as people
living in public housing can be thrown out of their homes if any household member or guest is
found using drugs even if the drug use happens someplace other than the housing project and no
help could find herself joining the tens of thousands of young people unable to get a college
education because of a provision in the higher education act that's a nice financial aid
to students convicted of possessing illegal drugs but the rich and powerful are judged by a
very different set of rules that's why the staff at no else rehab center thoroughfist one statement
incriminating the well even though the facility standard policies to turn all such matters over to
the police if through her pain well bush can help her families minds as well as their hearts
and force them to rethink their disastrous drug policy the nation and millions of young americans
in particular will owe her a tremendous debt of gratitude i wish her much luck where it's
in a hurry and i'll take a great column yes i don't know why you didn't fast at the me yesterday
just a joke okay just a joke relax don't start getting uptight like the bush people
i think he's in big trouble you know i think bill McPrize is going to move these in yes i think
it's going to be big i think there's going to be a big party november six that could be wrong
ten thirteen at five sixty wqm we got the mad dog at one hand could three got a bunch of baseball cramp
later on hey let's talk about tied wreck for sixty seconds shall we
if you want to grub the be like him be a radio sales hole if you want to get a real honest job
be a computer professional if you want to get trained for that you go to fast train
the only school that's got four convenient locations in date and brown and maybe some
day will tell you where they all are we know that one is in pember pines right
okay and then there's one in kindle and maybe some day we'll find out where the other two are
but see that would be too much like work time that would be like giving some more information
out so our good friends out there could take advantage of a really sensational joint there's one
school that's got certified Microsoft instructors convenient day evening and weekend classes that's
right when it's convenient for you and there's one school that's got full time job placement
department over thirty years experience you can complete your program at fast train get certified
for a real job in just four short months of course we're talking about fast train one of our
fine accounts that doesn't get serviced at all because tied wreck is a major butt plug get off
your butt pick up the phone and call fast train get started for a real honest job a computer
professional making a serious paycheck call toll free one eight six six fast train that's one eight
six six fast train or check them out of the web at fast train.com and you call be sure and tell them
that Todd directed not tell you to call
they're married captain jeez i gave the command to kill thousands of innocent people i said
fill her up i helped raise money to buy explosives for a suicide bomber but it was just so i
could drive to my in-laws for Thanksgiving i helped ship rocket launchers to islamic fundamentalists
in the Philippines but it was all good fun i was just cruising to the beach i helped provide cash
to train terrorist guerrillas but all i was doing was topping off my tank before my ski trip
if you think your addiction to using gasoline in your car isn't causing any harm think again
because the money you spend to fill your tank eventually goes to fill the pockets of terrorists
i gave the command to kill thousands of innocent people and all i had to say was fill her out some other
public service announcements want to blame terrorism on drug addicts but we want to let people know
that it's gasoline that fuels terror so whether you're sticking a straw in your nose or a nozzle in
your tank you're part of the problem i was just out for a Sunday drive it's not like i was hurting
anyone this message provided by the council on displacing the blame it's there for we could be
talking about study arabic could we hear it all i see especially since 15 of those 19 scumbags
were study arabians anyway suicide explosion in the northern israel things have been too
quiet for almost seven weeks now suicide explosion in northern israel a lot bomb up you surprised
nope no 175 votes at our poll already what are you listening to most days in the noon to one hour
because we do need some help in the noon to one hour although not necessarily see because we
have a shifting i mean not everybody unfortunately tunes it right at nine and sits there transfixed
until one o'clock that's not the way radio listening works you do understand that why the hell not
especially when you're on but at any rate uh neal 133 76% rush 17 9.7% they listen to rush not
rush limbaugh but like rush records don't you look huh their Canadian a yes they are rush 17 jim
roham 7 i see there that's okay have a good time roham 7 villa riley 7 music 6 and other 5
roham e i see when you start making numbers that are ridiculous because roham don't have seven people
listening all together so you know try to tone it down a little bit so there might be some credibility
ui say today says the borscht ministry on by the way there's Heinrich von Roomsfeld
right that's through the inspectors out Heinrich von Roomsfeld
and by the way the accurate thing is we told the inspectors to get out they didn't really
kicked them out originally then they said no you can't come back in we hear you knock in but you
can't come in but don't confuse any of these people with the truth just like donnie who tried to
can uh with Richard Allen last night that fascist pig try to confuse him with the truth about how
back in the erragon days uh they were just sitting back very quietly in a ragan in bush days while
i said i was doing his thing against the rand and not only that but not always supplied
him with all the goodies but then when they were using the mustard gas we sat back and uh we know
what's going on but he's a good guy how come he didn't say anything then and he went the
mule mule kind of like that kind of like skippy would say he went t kind of like that or kind of
like what's his name would say um see i can i always want to call him Todd because we already have
one Troy and he handles that account so the idea of having Troy and Troy and Roy too much so Todd
Troy whatever i can't understand the word he says in that spot it's mule mule mule like that
like he's on speed or something the borscht administration is expanding on and in some cases
contradicting us intelligence reports and making the case for an invasion of a rack
interviews with administration and us intelligence officials indicate administration officials
accuse a rack of having ties to al-Qaeda terrorists and of amassing weapons of mass destruction
despite uncertain and sometimes contrary intelligence on these issues according to officials
in some cases top administration officials disagree outright with what the cia and other
intelligence agencies report for example they repeated counts of al-Qaeda member seeking refuge
in a rack and of terrorist operatives meeting with a raki intelligence officials even though us
intelligence reports raised doubt about such links on Iraqi weapons programs and administration
officials draw the most pessimistic conclusions from ambiguous evidence although the borscht
administration made significant progress last week in generating international and domestic
support for a campaign against a rack some lawmakers and diplomats question the evidence being
assembled by the west and british governments hans blicks remember him nope yeah you do the dutch guy
oh yeah the tvn arms inspector said satellite images of a rack show no evidence that a raki
leader saudah mousane was rebuilding an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and house minority
whip nancy policy democratic california said that in secret intelligence briefings administration
officials were presenting embellishments on information long known about a rack a senior bushy
administration official conceded privately that there are large gaps in us knowledge about a raki
weapons programs but insisted that the only prudent courses to suspect the worst to give a rack
the benefit of the doubt officials argue would be naive and dangerous last week speaking of
dangerous national security adviser khan the liza rice formerly the chevron corporation
boiled administrations case down to a single line that evoked both the uncertainty and the risk
associated with the rack we don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud she said the
differences between the administration intelligence officials may be in part institutional the cia
tends to be cautious in its predictions and estimates and careful not to overinterpret the
situation based on incomplete information some agency officials say privately that they just
don't want to be posted to going beyond the facts to provide justification for a war not only the
facts are in dispute but also the interpretation of those facts cia enlisted reported that satin
wants weapons for prestige and security not for an attack on us interest they would almost
certainly bring a devastating us response bush administration officials warned that once satin
develops his arsenal he must be considered a risk to use it conversely the cia says that
u.s military should assume that satin would use chemical and biological weapons against american
and faders if the survival is regime or its stake pushes top advisors view this risk as manageable
one of the administration's key argument i wonder if uh... there in other words they view the
lives of these people as manageable uh... okay one of the administration's key arguments is that
the intelligence on Iraqi weapons may be wrong vice president chaney and defense secretary here
uh... donald rumsfeld recall that inspections after the nineteen ninety one per shingell for
finding rack much closer to feeling a nuclear weapon and the c i had estimated now the administration
warns the latest c i estimates that a rack maybe years away from building a nuclear weapon could be
based on incomplete intelligence and wishful thinking administration officials site two problems
facing u.s intelligence regarding a rack because of the absence of inspector since ninety eight
and sadoms ability to conceal his activities from technical intelligence assets such as u.s. spy satellites
the evidence against the wreck is at best dated and circumstantial
because of satins insistence on pain of death on on wavering loyalty from his inner circle
little is known about whether he plans to use weapons of mass destruction or merely hold him to
enhance his standing in a dangerous region chaney and rumsfeld question the c i's insistence that
it can find no link between al-Qaeda terrorists and satins regime they accept reports from
checked diplomats that some temper eleven hijack ramayama not an old thing that that meeting
they still don't know about that yeah we heard that they had sushi together to report said
still a pile of crap so what's the her uh hero one film regime change by the passage of the
Iraqi liberation act in nineteen ninety eight regime change like i said two hundred billion dollars
and a bunch of american soldiers lives as a hell of a grotesque price to pay for assassinating
somebody regime change means kill his ass don't you think you can get a hold of what's his name
they run the sopranos and we can do it for a lot less than that sure pony pony get a hold of
Tony baby he'll take care of it for you get a hold of uh don korean get a hold of ratsy yeah
somebody for justice we go to one of them not wasting two hundred million dollars of american
taxpayers and jeopardizing the lives of godwin knows how many not only american troops but how about
those Iraqi as sluppers over there too who didn't do not and two hundred votes on a poll and i see
put you what do you listen to in the noon to one hour most days neo hundred forty eight seventy four

It's become a black, it's a perfection.
It's not because of the flattery,
all we've got is hanging over me.
I'm a lot of citizen, don't take the words
of robbing your face.
Black, it's become a black,
it's never black,
see I got lost,
keeping my heart,
I got gasp,
make me fall,
I'm so bad,
I'm just a slut,
if I take you out,
I'll fight you for,
but for now I am a trolling man,

that's the fact Jack,
it's because of the fact,
that's the fact Jack,
I don't care if I'm gonna fight him,
they won't be able to clear this.
Or come because you're a scumbag,
that might be a 1033-560 WQM,
happy Wednesday to you.
Here's an important story about one of my favorite people,
Bert Ward.
What was his name?
Dick Grayson?
Indeed.
Dick Grayson and what was the Batman's name?
We went through that the other day.
Why am I drawing a blank on that?
I did too.
And I still don't know it.
That's bad.
Bruce Ward.
He was his buddy.
He was his Ward.
Not his pedophile.
Something like that.
Bruce Wayne.
Bruce Wayne.
Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson.
Bruce Wayne and Dick.
At any rate, for most people,
they're not enough hours in the day,
but they're not Bert Ward.
People will come around our house and say,
I can't believe how much living is going on here.
He says with the laugh.
Teeheehee, like that.
That's because the first-while boy wonder
from the hit 1960 series,
Batman only sleeps three hours daily from 6 to 9 a.m.
When you're up twice as much as other people,
it's like having two lives, he said.
So what is Ward 56?
56!
Oh my God, I guarantee you we're in him tights anymore.
How do you know?
Oh, what does he do?
In his extra life, he spends his nights working on projects
for his visual effects company,
named appropriately,
Boy Wonder Visual Effects,
which he formed in July 2001,
after more than a decade of study and frustration
at the lack of roles coming his way.
Well, there are not too many roles for guys and tights,
I guess other than maybe Romeo and Juliet.
What was the kid's name, Leonard Whiting?
Was that his name?
He sure was pretty.
There may not be a lot going on forward
in front of the camera,
but Boy Wonder's worked on more than 20 movies today,
including 2001's Legally Blonde,
and the upcoming action adventure film,
Bulletproof Monks, starring Chaoyeon Fat.
This is a transition to becoming a major player
in the visual effects world wards, says proudly.
Wardin is wife Tracy Forty,
whom he met in 1989,
when her father,
the late corporate writer Victor Posner,
oh boy,
centered to take over Ward's educational video company,
they married 1990.
Also rescue abandoned the Great Danes in 1994,
after moving from Los Angeles
to Robert Versailles County,
the couple and their daughter Melody,
and now 11,
learned about the number of Great Danes in the earth,
they needed homes with a great dane.
If you take it to a shelter,
it's too big for the cages.
People are scared of a big dog,
even though they're sweet,
and they're put to death, he says.
The family's 4,000 square foot home
and five acres of land becomes a refuge for the dogs.
Ward estimates they found homes
for more than 3,500 dogs in eight years.
Always liked that, Bert Ward, you know?
He's a dog person.
How do you like that?
And you know who said that to me and Amsterdam?
I give up.
Dinner that night?
Bob Vermuth.
As he was trying to suck up a little bit.
Well, you know, yeah, I should've realized
you were a better guy,
and I thought you were a dog person.
They tell me you have two dogs.
That's what one of them died.
Oh, you have a dog.
Didn't do any good, Bob.
Okay, you're still the same schmuck.
You're still the same piece of dirt.
You guys still don't get it done.
And don't be giving me a sec.
Let me tell you what this place needs.
This studio is fine as it is, you know,
with an influence.
It needs a tune up.
You know what I mean?
Tweaking?
It needs some tweaking.
So I think after I leave here in a few weeks,
whether that would be the time instead of this,
kind of like a piece meal,
and maybe Neil can crawl around on the floor and do this,
and get the keyboard out of the closet and hook it up again.
I don't think that's going to work,
since we're not going to be taking any calls for a while anyway.
The idea would be to do it right,
which I realize isn't in their repertoire,
but that would be the way to do it right.
Including how about should we try out the talk back?
Okay.
Because I might dump myself.
I mean, like this,
I don't know if the talk back is still dumb.
What did that do?
What did what to?
I hit.
Did it do anything?
I can hear this.
I can hear something.
Yeah, no, it worked.
That actually worked.
Yeah, I can hear it.
I can hear it.
Didn't dump the on air?
Well, how will we know?
Oh, that's right.
We don't know.
So if you're getting all screwed up over there too bad,
I'm in the talk back.
Because the word last time we had it,
and certainly nobody's been in here to fix anything.
So I think like tuning this place up would be a good idea.
I think that our engineering and sales department
has a lot of people who have got a lot in common.
Maybe that's why for Mood's been so much time that I'm talking about
and screw in.
Or maybe he's just a busy body and kids
who knows another people's business.
I don't think that's your business, okay Bob?
Even though of course you're corporate and Muff is scared,
crapless of you, okay?
Scared to death.
Just peas in his pants when he sees you coming.
Even when this other pursuits word hasn't given up acting entirely.
In November, he'll team up with Batman Coaster, Adam West,
and the CBS movie back to the Batcave.
The two adventures of Adam West and Bert Ward,
in which the former Cape Crusaders will fight crap once more,
but as themselves,
this is a bigger production than anything we done,
Batman Ward says.
Ward's got fun memories of his experience filming the Batman series
that he chronicled in the 85 tell-all book,
Boy Wonder My Life in Tights.
We party together, we got a message together,
we says of his friendship with West.
It was a lot of fun.
I thought they hated each other.
What wasn't fun was wearing his robin outfit.
Those were the Python pants, they nearly squeezed me to death,
and the Cape strangled me, he says.
The Python pants.
And if you look closely by the way,
you don't even have to look back closely,
there's something in those Python pants.
And we have two back to back at the Batman here,
every day on Showcase on my cable, four to five p.m.
every afternoon.
Although, of course, that four o'clocking screws up passions,
which is 330 to 430 here.
And let me say it again, guiding light here is...
Oh!
I guess the Doctor Phil Show is not a CBS show.
Is that correct?
I don't know.
It's syndicated just like Oprah.
So it's just a coincidence that Channel 4 down there happens to...
I don't know how that works.
Oh, well maybe it is, I don't know,
because it seems to me I saw promos from CBS
about the changing of time and guiding light.
Maybe somebody will fax me that information,
but the fact is that guiding light is still on between 3 and 4.
And Alan Spalding faked a heart attack yesterday
and Philip is getting it on with Olivia.
And what's his name is still looking pretty good?
What else is his name?
Fletcher Reads Kid.
Ben, Ben Reads.
Oi!
Getting pretty heavy duty that show now.
So it makes it very hard to watch the last half of that
and passions together simultaneously.
I could tape one in the living room
and the other room watch the other one
and see what I'm saying.
But that's wasted in too much time.
Yeah, I know.
You don't want to waste too much time on soap operas
then a lot of people start asking a lot of questions
spending too much time watching soap operas,
you know what I'm saying?
And then after they hear the rumors about that,
then you know what they start saying in public, don't you?
What?
I can't find it.
Oh, I'm a little slow on that, didn't I?
Huh?
No, seriously, after they find out you watch soap operas,
they start whispering out the window.
You're the gay.
Stuff like that.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Paul, what do you listen to most days in that noon to one hour?
You lawyer and you sticking with us?
No.
No, not some of you.
What else wrong with you people anyway?
You write when scumbags?
Oh, and see, this is, it's ridiculous.
Neal 171, 72.5%, rush limbaugh 30, Jim Rome 10,
other 10, music 8, and Bill O'Reilly still stuck there
with those seven same funny votes.
20 before 11 at 5, 60 W to Q A M.
Let's call the carpet doctor, shall we?
Actually, they're not doctors, but they might as well be.
They don't put a stethoscope on the floor,
but they might as well do that too,
because they come in here and they examine your carpets.
They take a look at them and say,
holy crap, these things need to be cleaned.
And then they go about doing a job like the likes of which
you've never seen in your life.
Drag concepts I'm talking about.
I've been using them for over 20 years.
They've been in town for well over 20 years now.
And they've been taking care of people's carpets and making them
look just like brand new during all of that time.
And they do it with their exclusive patent
and dry cleaning method.

Okay.
On Happy Birthday, Michael.
Was convicted June 7 of beating Martha Moxley to death in 1975 when there were 15-year-old neighbors in wealthy Greenwich.
He was sentenced last month to 20 years to life and freedom.
And what's his name?
I'm sure he's done it.
The moment he eyebrows, what else is his name?
Dominic Dunn?
But the little glasses?
Yeah.
He looks like kind of like a miniature Andy Rooney.
Very good, yes.
Yeah, the eyebrows.
They got the eyebrows at the same store.
Lemon Fizz is on the banks of the Euphrates rights more aimed out in today's New York Times.
She is just so good.
It's scary, you know what?
She's great.
She says, the trap is sprung.
The name of the game is containment.
Contain the wild man, the leader with a Messianic and relentless glint who is scaring the world.
Surround him through a little pussion nets on him.
Time up with a lot of you in inspection demands.
Humor him long enough to stuff him using his weapons and blowing up them at least.
But this time, the object of the containment strategy is not Sodom Hussein,
but George W. Bush, the president with real bombs, not the predator with plans to make them.
America's European and Arab allies now act more nervous about the cowboy in the Oval Office
who likes to brag on America's the greatest nation on the face of the earth than the thug in the Baghdad bunker.
We don't want another war in this region, Susan and Visam, the Saudi world family.
When Afghanistan is bombed, they just hit rocks.
Well, maybe a few weddings.
When his bombing in our neighborhood, they hit oil fields.
Gerhard Schroeder's campaign prospect sword when he started running against Mr. Bush.
Many Germans wrote the Times, Stephen Erlinger, seemed to fear American military action in Iraq,
more than they fear Mr. Hussein.
With assist from the rump cabinet of internationalists, including Colin Powell and Brent Scowcroft,
America's allies have been engaged in a benevolent conspiracy to ensnare the president in the web of UN rules for war and diplomacy.
The Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud Al-Faisal, insists that the Iraqi threat must be taken care of without the firing of a single shot or the loss of a single soldier.
He added a big sweetener promising that American bombers could use Saudi bases if Mr. Bush would work through the UN.
Privately, Saudi officials said they are alarmed by the Bush team's military strutting and think it would have been much better to give it a covert operation.
Sounds like what I've been saying.
They agree with the president that Saddam is a monster who normally eliminates his enemies, Reel and Proceed,
but also their wives, children and friends, but if he has nothing to lose, they worry he might fire his chemical and biological weapons at the Saudis or the Israelis or give them the terrorists to use on the US.
Sounds like what you said.
By wrapping Mr. Bush in a warm embrace, the Persian Gulf allies hope to waltz him closer to where they want him to be.
Meanwhile, the Egyptians and Jordanians pin Saddam to the mat and told him that if he had any chance of avoiding Armageddon, he should open his up his country to inspectors.
Thus in just a few days, the Iraq crisis went from Saddam having a new surround his neck to W being found by a multi-lateral macrame.
All the reasons for an attack have been eliminated, crowed at Terec Aziz, directs Deputy Prime Minister, both but the allies, and especially Mr. Aziz, should not underestimate the zeal of the Bush warriors.
Saddam can admit allegiance to the inspectors, but that may not stop Mr. Bush from wriggling out of the UN restraints and declaring the despots compliance a sham.
The Arabs tough tough that America should focus on rebuilding Afghanistan, getting a state for the Palestinians and pursuing the war on terror, but the Bushies have gotten the taste of empire building in Afghanistan and they like it.
Carl Rove is building a Republican empire, Richard Pearl, Paul Wolfowitz, and Scooter Libby are having a building an ideological empire, Dick Cheney is building a unilateral empire, and Donald Rumsfeld is building a military empire.
As Henry Kissinger told Newsweek, Rumi wants to beat back the attitudes of the Vietnam generation that was focused on American imperfection and limitations.
Besides, life should former CEO's Cheney and Rumi settle for mere jack wealth-style perks when they can have the perks of empire.
They can restore civilization to the cradle of civilization, lemon fizzes, cribbage, and cricket by the Tower of Babel, a 36-old golf course on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates, Arab Disney and the hanging gardens of Babylon, oil on tap at the Baghdad Hilton, huge contracts for buddies in the defense and oil industry.
They provided them with the technology to do it and the actual chemicals themselves, but we also stood by and said, hey, nice job there, son of, go get those Damiranians.
Go knock off that Iatola.
And of course, why did the Iatola get in? Because we stuck the shaw in there in the first place, but we just keep just like the thing with a Taliban.
I have to laugh when they start talking about, oh my God, the pictures of those poor women with a burqas, the women were wearing a burqas before 9-11 last year.
We didn't give a flying crap about it. We were closing up to them so they could help us build an Afghan oil pipeline.
We couldn't have given two crap less about how they suppressed their people. And now we're talking about all the military, the ruthless regime and all this other bull crap.
Who the hell are we kidding? A bunch of dumb people. Only the dumbest of the dumb can be by an ass bull crap.
Speaking of dumb, Governor Bush, thanks woman who tipped police to possible terror threat. Although he isn't as dumb as his brother, though, is he?
No, his brother is not dumb. He's just evil. No, he is dumb. Jeb? Oh, and I see, and let's let, no, Jeb is evil, but not as dumb as W.
Right. But W of course is a lot more powerful because he's not just governor. He's the head of 50 states, not just one.
Anyway, Governor Jeb Bush said yesterday he'd telephone the Georgia woman who alerted authorities of life who was possible terror threat to thank her for the warning.
Eunice Stone said she overheard three men possibly discussing terrorist plans at that Georgia restaurant on Thursday.
Come on now, AP. You can say shoneys again. They deserve a free plug. They got good punky pie or strawberry pie or something. At least they used to.
I'm going to have to go into that and I say I can't because I'll get the strawberry pie. I didn't do it.
They had slim gyms. Those are pretty good. That's not like it. Like with poppy seeds on a roll. They were pretty good.
And well, this we got the name. We don't need all that stuff again. Some Muslim groups have called Stone Erases things.
She acted on a prejudice against the men who are Middle Eastern descent and in the West legally and one of them wears a Hussage Shaco that looks like a doily.
I was really surprised at how critical the people were of a rations Bush said. This is Jeb. So I called her on Saturday morning and said you did exactly what the president of the West has asked people to do.
And he's right. That's here for Jeb. For once in his life. He's right. In fact, he's going to be singing that song with Stevie Wonder.
Stone of Curtisville, Georgia was hospitalized briefly a Monday suffering from chest pains and stress. Her attorney said Bush brought up the telephone conversation while meeting with Oscar Garner, a South West Florida coordinator for the state bureau preparedness and response.
We're prepared and we're responding, baby. Just like they responded there. And of course it was all thanks to units. So I think she'd get the congressional Medal of Honor.
She knows it's a freaking orange alert. She and have an orange asm she's busy keeping her eyes and ears peeled. She heard what those come back said. She called the police. She did a American patriotic duty. And now she's taken crap and has to go on every one of these goddamn TV show TV show to defend herself.
Shame on you people that are knocking her in that 35% of you that believe these are schmata heads. Who are just trying to save push is what they're trying to do.
Miami and central Florida DCF directors resign speaking of Jeb. This is in a sun sentinel so it might actually be true.
By the way, Janet lost the director of the state's child welfare agency in the district for five year old, really well. And by the way, have you heard about really is how she doing?
Isn't that amazing? Yeah, we don't hear one thing about really Wilson no more. The director of the state's child welfare agency in the district where five year old, really Wilson was missing for 15 months before the agency reported to his appearance announced his resignation Tuesday.
Oh, Charles Auslander resigned September 2. He'll stay in the post November 15th unless the part of children and family secretary Jerry McGear finds a replacement sooner. Jerry McGear, oh my God. I felt no pressure whatsoever to resign.

The Anonacole Show tonight on air.
It's 11.1560 WQM, so I lied yesterday when I said we're going to play bits between 11.1.
In fact, I think I said that this morning, too, the night.
Yeah, I lied.
I changed my mind.
Oh, damn it, I just ordered lunch.
That's okay.
I mean, at any given moment, I would say, oh, well, okay, that's enough for today and then go into a whole bunch of frenzy of comedy bits.
But there are a few things on here that need to be talked about.
Tico Tycoon, Scramble for Vale money.
This is just, it's enough to make you want to scream.
How much is enough?
I've been asking that question for about 400 years.
When does some pig ever have enough?
The two men who formerly were Tyco's chief executive officer and the chief financial officer are facing a real possibility of not being able to make bail and being ordered jail as early as tomorrow.
Oh!
At a hearing yesterday, lawyers for former CEO, L Dennis Kaislovsky and former CFO Mark Schwartz said that the two,
there isn't that they don't have any money.
They just can't get their hands on it because their assets have been frozen by court order to thank goodness.
He's got more assets than Custer had Indians had Kaislovsky's lawyers, Stephen Kaufman,
explaining that the problem is getting answers to the money.
He can't even go to an ATM.
Kaislovsky 55 and Swartz 42 are accused of looting millions of dollars from the conglomerate,
which makes everything from security systems and medical devices to code hangers and plastic wrap.
I sure hope they don't make no wire hangers.
No wire hangers.
Or Joan Crawford's going to come back and beat the snot out of both of them.
Money offered by Roliv's and others, both of the two defendants even Kaislovsky's ex-wife is being objected to by prosecutors.
They argue that the asset shouldn't be allowed as bail money because they could have been acquired through profits of the crime of which the two men are charged.
Last week, states have been court justice Michael Oba said bonds of 100 million for Kaislovsky and 50 million for Swartz will be jailed unless they come up with 10% of that amount by tomorrow.
Heading into tomorrow's bail deadline with empty pockets, the defendants have been told a post whatever assets they believe might be eligible for uses bail money,
and if the prosecution objects to the source of the money, a hearing on that issue will be held.
Arguing on behalf of Kaislovsky, Koffman told the judge yesterday that his client's ex-wife Angie had agreed to put up her 10 million dollar house and credit Connecticut or 10 million dollars in municipal bonds as bond security.
Assistant District Attorney John Moscow described both as possibly attributable to the course of Kanda, Kanda charged in the indictment.
We've made every reasonable effort to satisfy the bond that your honor sets of Koffman.
Moscow reply it doesn't seem appropriate that the proceeds of the crime should be used as bail.
All we want to know if the bail is the proceeds of the crime.
Koffman says the restraining order of Obasushu last week keeps Kaislovsky from using his assets anywhere in the country for his bond.
The defensive attorney entity believes it is legally questionable whether New York Judge has the authority to wish you such an order.
Don't ever give an order like that again.
Swartz's lawyer James Mitchell told the judge we find ourselves in an essential and the same situation as Mr. Koffman.
Mitchell said his client's wife had offered a property she had in the defendant on jointly.
Moscow told Obasush that given the employment history of Swartz's wife it's quite obvious that the source of the funds is the defendant.
Obasushu said it appeared to him that some of the bond collateral offered by the defendant's might not be subject to his restraining order.
He told the defense to return tomorrow post the security in that Moscow objects the court will hold a hearing on whether it's acceptable or not.
Or they's going to throw their ass in the brig.
Kaislovsky and Swartz were charged last week with enterprise corruption and grand larceny for allegedly stealing some 600 million dollars from Tyco.
They face up to 25 years in prison on each of those charges of convicted.
Tyco's former general counsel Mark Bellnick 55 was charged at the same time with falsifying business records to cover up 14 million dollars in improper loans.
Bellnick who could get as much as four years in jail of convicted was released last week on an unsecured personal reconnaissance bond of only a million bucks.
Prosecutors filed criminal charges against the men soon after the SEC accused them of hiding huge loans that other money they allegedly took out of Tyco.
Which is based in Permudo but had quoted in New Hampshire.
The SEC said Kaislovsky. I mean this part of the story just makes you want to get down on your hands in these and put your guts out.
Pigs disgusting pigs.
The SEC said Kaislovsky took it in 42 million dollars from an employee loan program established help workers by stock to pay for yachts, fine art, jewelry, luxury apartments and vacations.
Kaislovsky had already been indicted in June on charges of evading New York sales taxes on 13 million dollars in art including works by Renoir and Monet.
He resigned from Tyco in June a day before being indicted. He has pleaded not guilty in that case.
The court ordered for $600 million of Kaislovsky's assets. Tyco furthermore is in the process of seeing most if not all of his assets including a $17 million fifth Avenue apartment, $7 million park Avenue apartment turned over to his ex-wife, a $5 million and tuck at home,
and a $30 million compound in Volcaratone. You know who lives in Volcaratone? No.
Swords is accused of using company money to invest in sports teams and buy expensive jewelry and improper expenses allegedly incurred by Kaislovsky include a $2.1 million birthday party for his wife in Sardinia, Italy.
Well, that's not so bad. Other alleged unauthorized expenses incurred by Kaislovsky include $6,000 for a shower curtain, a $15,000 umbrella stand, a $6,300 sewing basket,
and $445 for a pin cushion. They had to turn him into a human pin cushion is what they ought to do and let everybody who got sucked out of toilet with their stock which is now in the crapper stick pins in his ass.
You know, it's one thing if you're going to like him bizzle a couple million here. You know what I'm saying? Right. How much do you have to steal? How much of a pig? How much of a disgusting pig you have to be? God damn it.
By the way, you're framed on the on our website just had going speaking of being now feeding friends. He out of his mind now since you mentioned the thing about the program. Right out of his mind.

FTC finally getting around to it weight loss ads full of a lonely nearly 40% of weight loss ads in a study by US regulators mean at least one representation.
There was almost certainly false a corner report released yesterday and about 55% of the ads included at least one representation that was very likely to be false or lacked adequate substantiations of its promises.
The analyzation by the FTC staff said and boys this long overdue or what they're all been out of shape about poor miscleo when it comes to all these fraudulent things on TV.
They haven't been able to give a crap up until now they couldn't care less.
There are no fast and easy fixes. Surgeon General Richard Carmon wrote in a preface to the study the public must adopt a healthy skepticism about advertising that promises miracles and scientific breakthroughs.
Carmonis have company should use real weight loss results in their promotions and publishers and broadcasters should screen ads they run to ensure they're based on science and out on swishful thinking.
About 61% of US adults are overweight or obese to be poor said more than two thirds of all Americans trying to lose or keep off weight.
Consumer spent about 35 billion dollars in 2009 weight loss products ranging from books and videos to drugs and diets shakes the report said when in doubt shake it out.
The report urged Americans who spend billions annually on weight loss products and services to look skeptically at ads that promise a quick fix for dropping pounds such as you can eat as much as you want to lose weight.
What's that one that Hollywood crap in a bottle? I thought that's called Hollywood crap in a bottle.
Hollywood crap in a bottle you drink this crap over the weekend and lose 15 pounds by Monday. Right.
Consumer testimonials and before and after photos were common and diet promotions but rarely portrayed realistic weight loss to be poor said.
The FPC conducted the study with a partnership for healthy weight management, a coalition that includes scientists government agencies and weight loss companies, the groups evaluated 300 ads from broadcast and cable TV, infomercials, radio magazines, newspapers, supermarkets, tabloids, direct mail, commercially mail and internet websites.
The staff also compared 1992 ads from eight national magazines to 2001 ads in the same few locations.
Fals are misleading claims are common in weight loss advertising and based on our comparison of 92 magazine ads with magazine ads for 2001 the number of products and amount of advertising much of it deceptive appears to have been critically dramatically increased over the last decade of the report.
The ads cause you people into anything about it.
Many of the ads were likely with likely false claims appeared in mainstream magazines like Family Circle and Cosmopolitan Report Pisan.
The FTC staff did not evaluate whether specific claims were substantiated but the reports that many of the promised effects clearly were unsupported by scientific evidence claims that are too good to be true include assertions that a user can lose a pound a day or more for a stated period that substantial weight loss without surgery can be achieved without diet or exercise and then users can lose weight regardless of how much they eat the reports and just mind your mind.
The consumers must become more knowledgeable about the importance of achieving maintaining healthy weight more informed on how to shop for weight loss products and services and more skeptical of ads promising quick fixes the reports said.
Media screening standards also would reduce the amount of blatantly deceptive advertising they said the FTC also said that efforts against deceptive marketing for weight loss products have increased.
In April 2000 this is one of my all time favorites that I've screamed about how did it take them this long to go after these bastards and form a natural products which advertised and sold the informa system agreed to repay $10 million to customers the set of FTC charges that they used false claims about scientific testing.
I'm sure almost everybody remembers these ads the company promoted its two products fat trapper and exercise in a bottle primarily we got your exercise in your ass okay.
Primarily with a 30 minute informational featuring former baseball player Steve Garvey Steve the bird of paradise should crawl up your ass okay.
The company claimed the system could block fat being observed and increased the body's capacity to burn it off exercise in a bottle that's the kind I like that's the kind that guy from the broadcast school likes to.
That's where he gets his exercise left in that bottle.
That's what you said that what you say yeah besides his bad breath well that's why promoting unrealistic expectations and false hopes they do in current ways law weight loss efforts to failure and make future attempts less likely to succeed said Dr. George Blackburn who's a quack by the way a professor of nutrition and Harvard medical school he's a quack.
Blackburn said some weight loss supplements like safety warnings can be dangerous a federal popular or commonly used for weight loss in bodybuilding has long been controversial the FDA has reports of 100 deaths among a Femura users a hundred that's not too bad.
The Justice Department said like that and fact how's what's your name do with that the FENFEN?
Linda energy I saw Linda energy yeah that would be good.
The Justice Department said last month it's conducting a criminal investigation into whether metabolite international nations leading seller of the supplement lied about the safety of a Fedra while the FTC study didn't criticize specific products and provided many examples of false or exaggerated claims one product made from the ground up shells of shrimps crabs and lobsters was promoted with statements like have you ever seen an overweight fish or noister with a few pounds too many.
The lose weight and not began an ongoing changes in thinking eating an exercise or a sensual blackburn said he said that when people know more about realities of weight loss fuel being climbed a waste of money time and effort on dangerous fads on fraud like that keto sand that low budget information were to sit in front of a dying plant have you ever seen that one yes kind of Saul key to Sam whatever they're talking about they wouldn't know how to lose weight if you stuck a guy if your arm up the rest it still wouldn't help lose weight.
I don't know my getting excited about it just it's just that this this crap is on all over the place now and other than our good friend Ron Popeel that the machine is pretty good you know which one the dehydrator no no no not that one like I said even Ron Popeel.
And his pocket the swisherman thing there the road history that's good but almost everything else you see advertised the information on TV like that one what's the one where you stick that the power your power tool in there.
You know what I'm talking about bigger part you stick your power tool and then you smear up all the bananas and strawberries you smear up your banana.
Speaking of smaring your banana like to smear that Todd Dreckwood I like to take 400 pounds of dog poop and they smear him with in fact when I get back with my work on that you know.

Where George goes you have to get another craft.
You guessed it.
Oh brother this board George man I hear much that some of that rap boys and some of that.
Miami mayor to attend Latin Grammy show what a shame George is going to get to hear this story.
This is specifically for him. I thought he'd be very pleased to hear this. Well maybe Carlos selected.
Miami mayor Manny Diaz is expected to attend tonight's Latin Grammy Awards in Los Angeles and has expressed interest in bringing the music award show back to South Florida.
So we can stir up all those little crazy Cubans again.
Come on East stop. Come on East stop. We can get all that crazy controversy going again.
Diaz was scheduled being California for a leadership conference with US Conference of Mayor said his press officer Kelly Pinton and Rika Fernandez executive director of the Latin Recording Academy said he found out a week ago that the Diaz plan to attend the Grammys we had invited him Fernandez said Fernandez had Grammy executives met last month in Miami with Diaz and in Waterloo, Pat Drone, president of the Miami Dade Community College about the possibility of doing education programs in the city that were focused on careers in the music industry.
Hopefully not any common East is by the way. We touched on the fact that Manny is also one of the places that seems like a possible venue for the show.
The mayor said we should talk about it further Fernandez added Diaz visit is being seen as an attempt to make amends with Grammy leaders who are abruptly pulled out of Miami last summer three weeks before the National
I show with to have been staged at the American Airlines arena. Michael Green then head of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences said he made the move to avoid planned protest by Cuban exiles over the possible presence of musicians from Cuba.
It was Cubans. It was a matter of fact I have a Cuba story here in a second both Bob Green.
I'm sorry I see Bob Green was the news the other day to one from Chicago both Michael Green stepped out from his Grammy job earlier near former mayor Joe
Carroyo the most local support of the plan protest are both gone from their posts clearing the way for Diaz to make a pitch for the show's return.
How do you like that? It's great let's hear we can actually keep it.
Former mayor Joe Carroyo. Hey listen I'll get all those old Cubans whipped up into a frenzy. Yeah nothing else going on right now.
They don't have Janet to vote against in November. Cuba was George still taking a while. Talk about heavy duty.
Cuba hamper's war I'm terror US says the Cuban government is impeding our efforts to defeat terrorism by feeding US officials misleading information fabricated by casters and tellers apparatus.
A Bush administration officer charge yesterday. This is not harmless game playing it is a dangerous unjustified election that damages our ability to assess real threats at Dan Fisk deputy assistant secretary of state for Western hemisphere.
Eight could one day cost innocent people their lives in speeches to two groups on opposite sides of the debate over US Cuba issues.
Fisk said that beginning on the day of the attack September the 11th Cuban agents gave US officials false lead seeking to misdirect the investigation.
This was only the beginning of a steady stream what's turned out to be a wild goose taces intentionally initiated by the Casper regime.
Fisk said in his speeches in an interview later he told the Harold we've seen instances on three continents the responsible agencies found a discernible pattern of information that leads us to conclude that this is part of a continuing pattern of false leads.
He declined to provide details about the person that information involved saying only that the responsible agencies had determined the people were Cuban agents.
Fisk said his words were chosen carefully and were cleared by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
Yeah at least once a month Cuban representatives have tried to set up our intelligence and law enforcement with false tips that took time to check.
He said I think what they're doing is they're setting up with these kind of comments if they don't let us go there into a rack.
You know at least let's go into Cuba. Let's go get to know if we can't get shot and we'll get some other bearded son of a bitch. How does that sound?
Okay sounds like a deal. Okay. Are you okay now?
Well I wouldn't say that. Carlos said you had a real moving experience is what he just that's what he's moving really fast.
I think is what he said is you were full of crap.
You must know that.
You must know that.
You must know that.
You must know that.
You must know that.
You must know that.
You must know that.
You must know that.
Well whatever.
Oh it's from Reuters I'm sorry.
The Pentagon is moving ahead with contingency planning for possible or the rack despite Baghdad's unconditional offer for the return of UN weapons inspectors.
US officials said yesterday we've seen this before the Iraqis are masters of the stop and start one official told the rotors if we stopped every time they started we would never end their weapons of mass destruction program.
The officials who of course asked not to be identified said the US was discussing with Britain a possibility of basing up to six radar avoiding B.T.
And I play that jock who stole thing and you were taking a crap.
Oh dammit which one the underwear world.
Oh that's my favorite one too.
Too bad.
God's punishing you okay.
The officials who asked not to be identified said the US was discussing with Britain the possibility of basing up to six radar avoiding B.T.
To stealth bombers on the British Indian Ocean Island of the Eagle Garcia and the military was proceeding with Francis and much of its key central command staff to gutter for an exercise in November.
Nothing stopped there are always contingency plans going on here what unofficial said one day after Iraq offered to allow you inspections under mounting world pressure and the threat of military action from Washington.
Shipping sources said the US Navy was seeking the ship military vehicles and hundreds of containers full of ammunition from the Europe to the Gulf.
The Navy's request marks will be the fourth major US arms delivery using commercial shipments to the Gulf since early August.
The Pentagon said earlier that the previous shipments were for routine military exercises in the Gulf but industry experts interpret them as a sign it is building firepower ahead of a possible attack.
In other words no matter what they say no matter how many inspectors they let in matter if they all stand around naked and let us do a cavity search and ain't going to make any difference because the hawks have already decided we're going in baby.
Isn't that the feeling you get I get it I'm feeling it that's what I'm feeling just like I'm feeling sick about this poll today because your buddy out there is just in the middle of the night.
In a in a psychotic feeding frenzy why you hanging him on me your pal isn't either one of the voted like 80 million times against you when we did it.
But he's just a hay con ferry whatever he thinks is going to piss off off the most especially me though I guess you're right he's my buddy.
344 votes some of them real not too many what are you listen to most days in the noon to one hour.
Neil 228 66.2% the real percentage is about 78.
Once once he got on this you notice how it changed it was that way for about a half an hour and once he got on here all of a sudden it just went in the crapper.
Bush 54 that's 15 and a half percent Bill or Riley 21 which went from nowhere from like 7 to 21 in about five minutes Jim Rome 14 which is more than his entire nation wide listening audience other 14 and miscellaneous 13.
244 it's 11 not even 11 30 we have 244 votes is anybody by this guy needs to be strapped in and get your own Crawford out.
When that straight jacket ties hands up the others back so we can't do himself any damage.
Oh and it's time for another award winning spot from our good friend Skippy.
I think what we ought to do is start announcing the A.E.s of course we don't know who half of Mark before we do the spots you know I'm sitting at the good idea that is a good credit where to do.
Here's another great piece of copy written by PD Lenny for our friend Skippy who can't write a piece of copy because he wouldn't know one of you stuff the entire copy book up his ass.
Nice going Skippy you won't be here long don't unpack.

George voice gardens every day seems like.
George voice gardens where everyday seems like four years of interstate 95 in Canabelle port.
Yeah I'm just thinking I never really looked at them way back in that those days bush one we had a president who was extraordinarily cunning and dangerous and a vice president who was a moron right now we got a president who's a moron and a vice president who's extremely cunning and dangerous and I also remember back in those days they said that's
were funny.
Yeah when that great I got all these out for that big new to one hour today.
Hey that'll boost up noon to one no matter what this Shmender puts on there.
Or maybe not maybe all these intellectuals who want to hear all of this stuff that's going on in the world maybe they'll say oh gee you shouldn't be doing that because that's wasting an hour you could be at listen.
We got to do something a little bit special on Wednesday don't we?
Yeah let or not Iraq upside down rights Thomas Friedman in the New York Times today by the way trim that mustache Tom and next time you write a book don't just make it a collection of stuff you wrote before.
Anyway he writes recently I've had the chance to travel around a country do some call in radio shows during which this question of Iraq has come up often and here's what I can report from a totally unscientific sample don't believe the polls that a majority of Americans favor a military strike against Iraq it's just not true.
It's also not true that the public is solidly against taking on Sodom who's saying what is true is that most Americans are perplexed.
The most oft asked question I heard was some variation of how come all of a sudden we have to launch a war against Sodom I realize that he stumped his nose at the UN and he has dangerous weapons but he's never threatened us and if he does couldn't we just vaporize him but worries me our Osama the terrorists still are out there they're saying.
That's where I think most Americans are at deep down they believe that Sodom is deterrible that is he doesn't threaten the US and never has because he's been deterred by the way deterred the same way Russia China North Korea have been.
He knows that even if he hints at threatening us will destroy him Sodom has always been homicidal not suicidal indeed he spent a lifetime perfecting the art of survival because he loves life more than he hates us.
No, what worries Americans are not the deterables like Sodom but worries them are the undeterables the kind of young Arab Muslim men who hit us in 9.11 are still lurking Americans would pay virtually any price to eliminate the threat from the undeterables the terrorists who hate us more than they love their own lives and therefore cannot be deterred.
I share this view which is why I think the Iraq debate is upside down most radicals insist that the reason we must go into Iraq and the only reason is to get rid of its weapons of mass destruction not regime change and democracy building I disagree.
I think the chances of Sodom being willing or able to use a weapon of mass destruction against us are being exaggerated what terrifies me as the prospect of another 9.11 in my mall in my airport in my downtown triggered by angry young Muslims motivated by some pseudo religious radicalism hooked up in a mosque in Saudi Arabia Egypt or Pakistan.
And I believe that the only way to begin defusing the threat is by changing the context in which these young men grew up namely all the Arab Muslim states that are failing in modernity and become an engine for producing the undeterables.
So I am for invading Iraq only if we think they're doing so can bring about regime change and democratization because what the Arab world desperately needs is a model that works a progressive Arab regime that by its sheer existence would create pressure and inspiration for gradual democrat democratization and modernization around the region.
I have no illusions about how difficult it would be to democratize a fractious Iraq who will be a huge long costly task if it's doable at all and I'm embarrassed to say that I don't know if it is.
All I know is that it's the most important task worth doing and worth evading because only by helping the Arabs gradually change their context a context now dominated by anti-democratic regimes and anti-modernist religious leaders and educators are we're going to break the engine that's producing one generation of another after undeterables.
These undeterables are young men who are full of rage because they're raised with the view of Islam as the most perfect form of monotheism but they look around their home countries and see widespread poverty, ignorance and repression and they're humiliated by it, humiliated by the contrast with the West and how it makes them feel and this humiliation, this poverty of dignity that drives them to suicidal revenge.
The quest for dignity is a powerful force in human relations.
Closing that dignity gap is a decades-long project we can help but it can succeed only if people there have the will but maybe that's what we're starting to see.
Look at how Palestinian legislators just voted no confidence in air fat. Look at how some courageous Arab thinkers produced an Arab human development report which declared that the Arab Muslim world was backward because of its deficits of freedom, modern education and women's empowerment.
If we don't find some way to help these countries reverse these deficits now while access to smaller and smaller nuclear weapons is still limited, their young angry undeterables will blow us up long before Assad emever does.
Right Thomas Friedman.
Which is okay but what he may expect to point out is that he's living in a pipe dream.
Democracy of Arab countries in addition to which all of that poverty that we hear several people talking about, how come it is that all these wealthiest of wealthy nations like Saudi Arabia, how come that the mainstream people there live like schleppers living rampant poverty and throughout most of the Arab world since they're the ones that have most of the oil.
And that a good question, don't you think?
No.
And I think the answer is because they don't share the wealth.
So just like John Critchin and his very naive comments from last week on CBC can keep screaming about the fact that these people that are living in poverty and they look to the West and the West has to share the blame for that.
The fact of the matter is that their own countries, it's just like the thing with the Palestinians, if they're so concerned I've said this for years, if they're so concerned about the plight of those people just like Georgia's who have their land taken from them and stolen by those lunatic right wing Israelis.
Well that's fine but we got plenty of other land in here. Let's bring them on in.
Why? Why not? Why should 8 million people have to be evacuated? Why? Why?
Is it better to keep it on the way it is now? No, it's better to make people comply with the international law.
We're comply with international law. Why the hell did that ever start? What kind of world are you living in?
Dream world. Exactly. I look at that map and I see the size of Egypt and Saudi Arabia and some of those other Iran, those gigantic Syria.
It's not their job to take refugees. Right. That's true. Why should they solve the problem?
They should just suppress all other people. They have them living like slippers in desperation and poverty and continue just like we had another, another suicide bombing in northern Israel today.
Just can just perpetuate it forever because people are stubborn. Not that you're stubborn but you are.
Goal 4 or 2, you heard it here first right, Mark Kingwell in this morning's national post. He says readers of this column probably don't credit with a much influence in the quarters of the White House and attitude shared except in delusional moments by the author.
The news comes this week that provides hope. Scotland Sunday, Harold one of the few actually independent newspapers left in the British Isles published hard evidence that the Bush administration was planning a regime change in Iraq, which I read yesterday.
Even before the 2000 election had a detailed plan in hand by January 2001. They also reported that the West and Britain have been selling chemical weapons to the Iraqis since 1992.
Then that's how like it from a new article. It sounds just like one that I read yesterday from the Scotland Sunday, Harold.
I had to check the dates myself to be sure he says, but yes, there it was in January 2001. I argued that in this space that the easiest way to cement Bush Jr.'s all too shaky mandate was to start up the suspended war with Iraq.
Goal 4 or 2 would have silenced domestic critics and galvanized public opinion. There was I suggested no time like the present. The ever helpful headline writer came up with something on the order of Get On With It, which doesn't have the straightforward venez of let's roll, but it's pretty damn close.
I even suggested Bush fuel should ask his father for some of those sky blue quays, I military shirts that President Stavre when visiting hot climate theaters of war.
I was kidding, of course, but the Bush East coast would ignore that one of the dangers of attempting satire in our political culture where a scenario constructed scared the BG's out of your average citizen looks just like with policy options to your average politician.
And yes, it's proven a little more complicated for Mr. Bush than just doing whatever the hell he wants. It took him almost two years to get his play in the top of Saddam Hussein really going.
And he had to invent invent comic book rhetorical devices like the axis of evil, speciesly linking the Iraqis to al-Qaeda terror to keep the fire high. His father's own advisors, meanwhile, have weighed in against the new war, surely complicating conversation over the family dinner table.
But the man is not for turning and his latest move displayed a degree of savvy that will force all of us to reconsider his mental abilities, at least in the service of self interest.
Mr. Bush has appeared to be when last week was a stroke of genius. On the surface of mark, they significant reversal of all previous policy. Suddenly Mr. Bush is a committed multilateralist, a pillar of the international community.
He comes to New York with a political camp in hand, asking nicely for support against this evil man in Baghdad.
And reality, of course, it finessed the situation in a manner to please Macaveli. Now brought generously into the war plans, he won security council,
a fight in impossible resist the arguments of a suddenly compliant and cooperative Bush theme. Meanwhile, behind these soft words is the hard truth that the US will proceed with their war plans no matter what happens.
In fact, in case anyone is forgotten, British and American planes are bombing Iraqi targets even now or no were almost every day.
If you doubt that this apparent change of heart was both sudden and cynical, note two things. The Fent secretary, Rumsfeld, swiftly be called a Washington Post op-ed justifying unilateral pasting of Iraq, just days before the 50-70 when General Assembly opened last Thursday,
then Mr. Bush, after meeting in the morning with Secretary General Kofi Annan, and learning of the tough anti-Aragon's message that the latter was about to deliver, hustled to revise his own speech in a way that would startle everyone up to his national security adviser, Kanda Leeza Rice, the administration's late model terminator.
Spreading the largest, Mr. Bush even offered to rejoin UNESCO the UN's social and cultural organization, which Ronald Reagan acquit almost 20 years before. Suddenly, the UN was not the Kami Haven and Third World Wine Fest we've in led to believe. Amazing. As the critic Ian Williams put it perhaps not since the enemy changed from East Asia to Eurasia, in middle-ration in Georgia, whilst 1984, has to admit such an abrupt about face-to-nations foreign policy.
In the wake of the UNESCO announcement on the Dow Jones industrial average immediately grabbed 202 points, but this new Bush dodge is still the stuff of brilliance, a snookering to make John Crachan smartly executed freeze-drying of Paul Martin look like the work of an amateur.
Naturally, there was no much in a poning up the U.S. as long overdue UN dues were accepting the authority of the International Criminal Court, those things might actually cost the administration at its friend's something.
Instead, there was a subtly effective soft pedal version of the old Sandlot threat to play nice just until I take my football and go home.
This is real politic for the new age of bland power play deployed as a sincere request for help. The UN for its part had no choice but to go along since Mr. Bush is now doing exactly what they asked, talking their language, and postponing if not eliminating the prospect of unilateral attack.
And it all seems to be working nicely. Iraqi Vice President Terec Aziz announced yesterday that UN weapons inspectors will be allowed on conditional access to sites in Iraq.
Is this a victory however small for multilateralism? Will the Bush administration's making it for now someday actually come to acknowledge the value of an international community? Don't hold your breath.
Washington rejected Mr. Aziz's latest offer just as they rejected all previous ones as Machiavelli warned, cynicism should be get cynicism.
Mr. Bush's display of cooperation is a calculated sham no more and no less. Credit him with a change of tactics, not a change of heart.
Right smart king. Well in this morning's national post day with a couple good old anti-American shots thrown in for good measure.
They're big on that up here by the way. 18 till noon. Well that's because we got such a big army up here and a curling team. Don't forget about them. They're dangerous.

Parents charged in death a girl forced to drink water.
Said she had a sneaking problem.
This is in Salt Lake City where their middle name is.
Like that.
Kind of like Greg Reed.
That's the middle name.
Is she Greg lately by the way?
Yeah.
Some in the hall just recently.

A couple charged with killing their adopted daughter by forcing her to drink large amounts
of water.
They were adopted daughter by forcing her to drink large amounts of water.
Said yesterday they were treating her today.
They were treating her severe problems of sneaking and lying with rules to promote family
bonding.
Richard Killpack, 34-engineette Killpack, 26th of Springville, were charged with child abuse
homicide and child abuse in the death of their four-year-old daughter Cassandra Killpack.
Richard Killpack said under rules suggested by a therapist, they required Cassandra to ask
for everything including food and water to help her understand dependency and that her
mom and dad loved her.
She had a very severe problem of sneaking and lying to the point of even damage to herself.
He said today on the CBS early show, they made the suggestion that whatever she sneaked
her wanted, that you would do that in excess.
After she took water in June, he said they asked her to drink three eight ounce glasses
of water.
After about twelve ounces, he said she threw temper tantrums and then followed the requested
exercises and take a time out.
She started to complain her head was dizzy.
I asked her to come over to me and she basically passed down her arms.
He said on NBC's Today Show, her death was a tragic, tragic accident, Jeanette Killpack
said.
But prosecutor's show evidence shows Cassandra was forced to drink so much water, it
lowered the concentration of sodium in her blood causing fatal brain swelling.
The Killpack's lawyer, Philip Danielson, said unbeknownst to her parents, Cassandra sodium
level was depleted before she drank the water.
Sherry Reagan, chief of Utah County attorney's criminal division, said it probably took
several courts of water to cause Cassandra's death.
Are you following that?
I'm following.
Several courts of water?
The explanation they're given for the amount of water that the giver does not fit the
medical evidence she said on NBC today.
She also said the parents forced Cassandra to drink the water, even while she was gagging
and tied her arms back.
She said cuts and bruises were found around the girl's mouth.
She also said Cassandra sneaked, cool aid, not water.
Oh, I see.
Well, in that case.
And we know that white people ain't supposed to be drinking no cool aid.
Well, we were discussing that when you were out sick last week, I think.
Well, do you think white people drink cool aid?
They certainly do.
That's someone Miguel said.
He said only scharxes drink cool aid.
How would he know?
What do you mean?
How would he know?
Cubans don't drink cool aid.
Well, there you go.
He's Cuban, right?
He don't be drinking no cool aid everywhere.
Everywhere I'll find him.
He probably knows a couple of white people.
I'm white.
I don't drink cool aid.
I used to do it.
All the green goes have cool aid in the fridge.
As a matter of fact, the white trash people put cool aid in the baby's bottles and give
that to their babies.
And what about Jim Jones?
What about him?
Those people drink cool aid.
He drinks cool aid.
Just a little bit.
What's wrong with that?
Just this once.
Kale Pack City was following the recommendations by a therapist at the Cascade Center for Family
Growth in Oram, Utah.
Too many gleeim in Oram.
Center director Larry Van Blombe denied that his therapist promoted forced water drinking.
No, we never recommended the told the daily hero the provo.
In June, Springville police searched the Cascade Center for Therapy Records.
On the four-year-old girl, the authority said the center does not share responsibility
for Cassandra's death, Clarence A.Od.
The Kale Pack said two daughters wanted to adopt and both have been placed in foster care.
The couple were waiting a court summons, Gerald Banfield.
The charge of the child abuse was filed because they involved their older daughter in the
discipline and abuse of Cassandra, and she suffered severe emotional harm against
it, Wayne Temple.
The Kale Pack's called 911 on June 9th when Cassandra was having difficulty breathing, following
the punishment she died early the next day.
Danielson said Cassandra was physically and sexually abused before being adopted and
wasn't bonding with her new parents.
He said the Cascade Center promoted forced water drinking for children with attachment
disorder, believing it teaches children to seek out their parents for relief and comfort.
Richard Killpack said they had tried several months for nearly three years to help Cassandra's
mental conditions.
We loved our daughter.
He said we gave her the best treatment we could.
We feel very sad about it.
In October, Jean Newmaker was convicted in Colorado on the death of her 10-year-old adopted
daughter, who suffocated after being rat by therapist in blankets and pillows in what
was called a re-birthing session.
Newmaker was sentenced to four years probation and four hundred hours of community service.
A re-birthing session, I remember that story.
And that sound great?
Yeah, these therapists.
Well, how is it going to get born again?
Temple of Them Fairy Tales.
Speaking of fairy tales, Ray Graham of the Boston Globe Rights.
As a journalist, I have to believe LA Times reporter Chuck Phillips crossed every teen
doubted every eye before releasing his explosive two-part story about the murder of rapper
Tupac Shakur earlier this month.
And they got a pull on this, too, as a matter of fact.
I have to believe Phillips, who spent the past year investigating the officially still
unsolved killing thought long and hard before reporting that a fellow rapper, the late notorious
B.I.G. was minimally involved with his September 1960s, 1996, drive by shooting at Mordley
wounded Tupac.
We had this story a while ago last week.
Yes.
Certainly, Phillips would not write something so damning without checking, rechecking,
and double checking, every available source and document.
But the hip-hop head in me doesn't know what to do with Phillips' staggering contention
that B.I.G. also known as Biggie Smalls, not only paid members of a notorious street gang
to execute Tupac, but even supplied his own gun for the shooting.
That's also been the overwhelming reaction of the hip-hop nation since Phillips' articles
were published September 6 and 7, the sixth anniversary of Tupac shooting.
How come we didn't celebrate that anniversary?
What was it?
September 7.
September 7.
The Rockburn Promising Actor died six days later, September 13.
We just missed out on that.
So anyway, they took a poll in the Boston Globe and they asked, did Biggie have Tupac
killed the fact during the last break?
I try to like recheck this thing, but it's not on a Boston.com thing anymore on the Boston
Globe website.
But I got quite a few votes, 1742.
Did Biggie have Tupac killed?
Yes, he's guilty, 42%.
We'll never know who did it, 37.1%, and no Biggie couldn't have done it, 20.8%.
See again, we'll never know who did it.
We haven't got the fogiest idea.
That should have won overwhelming it.
How the hell did they know?
Unless, of course, they're rapper experts.
Are you a rapper expert?
Nigger, please.
How about Carlos, you a rapper expert?
No.
Although, Serran Rap does work tremendously well.
He keeps stuff very antiseptic.
Serran Rap.
It's the East Coast rappers against the West Coast rappers.
Oh my God.
What kind of a country are we talking about here?
Yeah.
Now, one of the Canadians takes some cheap shots.
Although, who the hell are they to talk to?
409.
Well, I mean, you know, when you got that curling thing, and boy, I tell you, as much of a hockey
fan in Leefan as I am, I mean, they are in a feeding frenzy this week like, hey, how
we survived the summer and now, man, now life is back.
Let's get to the serious stuff.
Tell you what, once they decriminalize that weed, then they'll be able to talk.
I see.
They're working on it for 16, 16-year-olds enough are going to be able to buy it.
Legal Grinking Aid here is 19.
They can talk their light years ahead of the gold USA.
Trust me when I tell you.
Light years ahead.
Even though we got this dumb frog as Prime Minister, they're working on getting his ass
out.
He'll be out.
He'll be out.
411 votes on a pool.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha.
411 votes.
And I'd suggest that like, maybe 300 or more real.
What are you listening to the most days in the Noon to One Hour?
That's why today it really has got nothing to do with why we're doing it, but it's a good
story.
Noon to One, we're playing all in comedy bits to get all of them fun people back, okay?
All those people who want to dwell on right wing bullcrap, you can go over to Russian,
Bill O'Reilly and Life with Riley, you can go hang out with them.
We want to have a little few laughs Noon to One.
Anyway, Neil 268, 65.2%.
Rush 67, Bill O'Reilly 30, music 16, Jim Roam 15, other 15.
See if he wouldn't have got carried away with Jim Roam, I wouldn't have looked quite
so suspicious, you know?
I know.
But he got a little bit too carried away with Roamie.
Maybe they wouldn't listen to Jim Roam the days when Hank doesn't guess the pyramids.
It's 1156 at 560 W.A.C.Y.M.
Am I doing the right spot here now?
Charles O'Reilly?
Yes.
Now let's see who's the coward.
Look at that.
He even put his name on their Troy Stratford.
Troy the boy.
There's the great black hope, man.
I'll tell you that right now.
Troy Stratford, good man.
He's our only salesholder worth even talking about, especially after Adam facts me that
piece of crap from that agency yesterday.
What was he thinking about?
Is he thinking?
No.
He's probably looking for another cult.
If you find yourself looking in the mirror and wondering where your hair went like Troy
Stratford, he should be an expert on this.
He don't have a hair on his head.
He knows where it went.
He's not just shaved bald man.
He don't have like a follicle on his head.
It's a nice high shine.
And his, uh, and the scrant set is, is too.
Anyway, if you want to get your hair back, chuck out the areas they got to do it.
Not a mousey looking piece.

If you love those great songs from those great mafia movies, you flip over real mob hits.
Not only does real mob hits give you more of that great mob music,
but you also get awesome sounds of real mob hits.
Like Luke of the Icepick Fyama, getting his at the 106th Street Bobbyshop,
Forget about it.
Or who can forget, solid the fish, getting the old piano wire across the trope.
If I remember correctly, it was a B flat.
So what are real mob hits now, if you know what's good for you?
Just by dialing 1-800-Botter-Bing, real mob hits.
Hey, it's real.

Come out and tell me,
I'm back out my TV.
Oh right.
Holy back of rolling.

What happens with Melsey,
and her drinking face?
The girls all look healthy at the bottom face.
How I miss Big Colorsy,

And Janice the Fancy,
comes back for more care.
Last year, when she got caught,
we ate his guts.
Christopher made him shut up with Paulie Walnuts.
No, everyone's dead.
Cause anything goes.
My friends are getting ready for the surprise.
I hate dinner up,
but you just see your Rumsfeld with all the protestors there with a big song.
Yeah, I love it.
And he had this shmitty look on his face.
You don't talk to a Rumsfeld like that.
Anywhere else screaming in here.
It was a beautiful thing.
It was.
What's up, you idiots?
And you believe that jerk?
Oh, stand in.
You seem a little tense.
Yeah, I've been snap it up people all day.
Maybe it's time of the month.
Me too.
I've been cranky, retaining water,
and look, wearing these white gloves.
I know what you mean.
Every 28 days, I get this insatiable craving to buy a banjo.
And a corn cob pipe?
Yeah.
Well, then, it looks like there's only one thing to do, sir.
Hey, what's that, Mr. Angel?
Yeah, that's all.
See, you, sir.
I wish I would've been digging away.
These two men are suffering from pre-minstrel syndrome.
Beware the warning signs.
If your husband ever comes home with a tambourine or a banjo pick,
and insists on calling you Mr. Bones, hide the shoe polish,
and call your family doctor immediately.
Oh, I'll tell me, Mr. Bones.
Yes, sir, Mr. Interlocutor.
Who's that woman I saw you wear, Bladnight?
Oh, there was no woman.
There was Martina Napertalupa.
No, it's not very funny.
And there is no cure.
So when it happens to the man in your life, try to understand pre-minstrel syndrome.
No!
Yeah, this one right here goes out to all the babies, momas.
Momas.
Baby, momas, momas.
Who ain't the only babies, momas, and they manas like.
Okay.
Again.
You look like that.
I'm sorry, Miss Jackson.
Who is this, for real?
Never meant to make a doctor.
I can't believe it.
I am so surprised.
It's not just a Jackson.
I'm just telling you, Leo.
There we go, right here.
Shut up, I'll touch eyes.
Who's that, that's a girl.
Oh, baby, it's drama, momas.
Don't like these things.
Just doing like going out of his own neighborhood.
And just doing it like Nike.
He cheated.
He counts as the American president, White House, and find out.
He got his own thing going.
With the lights out.
And now he's got a new job.
It's a baby.
I'll redlock.
Rub a pot.
She'll be.
Locked up.
We have a headlock.
She loves to wipe in everything.
But she ain't the one who's laying down.
You want to rip up 38 years of marriage, see Jack and Tim Brown.
I remember when he bought us all together when we moved as divided.
That this guy had books out known as the Great Luna Fire.
This guy did.
We bought up most respect.
It is all through.
All you did is hurt that lady.
It's your fault, who?
Yeah, Miss Jackson.
It's his whole meal.
And with you, you know we said, but I think I'm not the type that's real.
It's time.
Stay conguerce Jackson.
Get down and meal.
There's a meant to make the dogs a hotdog.
This bitch in soup is as good as I.
You had a daughter while the Clint didn't go in on.
You will be in a home by time you've moved wrong.

You've spent a hand-picked until the devil went into hell.
You've got to take my time, time and act.
You got the time to fight.
The quickest fight to throw it on yourself and you'll be fine.
Assisting Martin Luther King.
He had a dream, not bad or quri-vent, almost 16.
And for all days, he's always been committed to labor.
To labor, to labor, labor, to labor, labor.
We brought labor with work, good jobs, but we were wrong.
And notice the true meaning of push, cobalt and John.
Miss Jackson, his intention's so good.
He wished he could become a magician to Africa's Aberdeen and Dad.
Thoughts of kings, thoughts of sheep, thoughts of Jesse.
Was a man as a man, now he's an elderly dad.
He's saying so much about it. That's what he said.
In happened for a reason, he should be mad.
The news released it just comments true.
So he would not be present for the Joe Double.
You inauguration, so I'm a Jackson.
Who is in for real?
Never meant to make a dog that I can't find.
You get my pencil, so cry.
Stay by Jesse Jackson.
Get down and kneel.
To be your wife, you should apologize.
That's the girl who had your eyes.
Man, my car is so dirty and I've got to meet an important client this evening.

So when you need to feel like a million bucks,

We are the best.
Oh, yeah, you are. You're the best.
I do think you can wash the car too.

All right.
They want us to find a way.
They reimbursed for back pain.
From 200 years ago,
When they were slaves.
When I only have a whole bowl home.
A pitful and a pinch of skull.
So if you want to ask me how,
Here's what I've got to say.
Oh, you've got to.
Yes, a digger, good morning.
You're telling me that you're sorry for it's labor among.
Yes, a digger, good morning.
Are you sure?
If I'm forever funn' to a dead end call.
If I was born in 1802,
Golden slaves ain't something I'd do.
But when for dead people dead do you.
I have to take the flight.
When you see it all for an old ninety-hack.
Oh, no.
With a can of Spanish area intact.
It's dead of forty acres and a mule.
I have a better way.
You've got to.
Yes, a digger, good morning.
And put on how they're far and far and frame up to.
Yes, a digger, good morning.
And that's your resolution for a slave of you.
Yes, a digger, good morning.
Okay.
If you're feeling that you're sorry for it's labor among.
Yes, a digger, good morning.
And that's forever funn' to a dead end call.
How about if it's Malcolm?
That sounds okay to me.
And I got a new chat on passion speaking of that.
A dangly chat.
I wonder if he's a hanging chat.
But at any rate, I sure don't want to find out.
He's kind of bizarre.
Okay, Martian Schwarzer.
Anyway, I think we got this down to a science.
I think what we're going to do is Wednesdays noon to one.
How to 11 to one noon to one.
Okay.
There's two things that's going to add to that.
11 to one is too long.
You're right.
It's driving out of the ground.
And I don't worry that.
But then I'll mind of playing a lot of stuff over.
Not that we don't have any major different bits.
But I mean, I don't know.
Yeah.
Because I'm liking the stuff I'm playing today.
Not that we don't hear that last one often.
No, never less.

Hello, becoming known for having an open-saint party today.
A great day for the Hey Rich Hall across the USA.
What big order, what is this I hear?
This cry and valley who has a bunch of queers again this year who say

Oh God, loves the Hey Rich.
And less of course your gays.
If you are your want the margin, a puns in patty's day.
You can be your bum a fuck if the scum.
Sure than that's okay, but you can't be Irish if you're gay.
Now your order of hyperneons,
boss Eminence's grey, have delivered this pronouncements upon the blessed day.
Sure a little bit of heaven fell and nestled in the sea.
But you're gone straight to hell for homosexuality.
Oh come, loves the Hey Rich as long as Miniman.
Except perhaps the livercarns we've never been sure of there.
You can be stinking drunk and hurling,
and some slavet all the way.
But you can't be a Irish if you're gay.
No, you can't be a Irish if you're gay.
No.
Don't even try being a Irish if you're gay.

King Bush.
You don't care what I'm doing.
King Bush.
And I thought I was stupid.
The media controls you.
You do what's it told the King Bush.
If you didn't see it on TV it ain't real.
The media isn't our control with stories there are spinning.
No matter what goes wrong,
it will just blame it all on Cliff.
I don't have no interest going down.
King Bush.
Come on a higher ball, Brown.
Is that how you wouldn't know how?
He's a moral grounder and a bug founder King Bush.

Faking to the oldies.
I'll feel the pain in your bunch of like gloves in the dark.
It's the high impact video where you found that bug that used to be down.
I love it.
Come on, grab my hair, Richard.
Come hang here.
A real nice leather glove.
Raise those arms and start peeing to the ground.
And I'll hit like fake my booty.
Watch me when you're best shot and girls you want to.
Get in the way.
Stop running and so many more.
And when you order, you'll offer it to your new deal at squeal plan 2.
So come on.
Not you.
Put a healthy glow on those chicken sharks.
Faking to the oldies.
Go.
But the old boys are all right.
Go.

That funny little sound that comes right out.
You stinkers?
Want to copy me and do exactly like I do?
Get paid for writing little songs about boo boo.
My brains are gone.
I'm trying to get my groove on.
But I can't figure out which spice grill I'm gonna fart on.
And Dr. Dre asked,
Yo, ma' you pescat.
Yeah, I know.
So what do I smell as?
Name you low play.
Well, since age 12 it seemed like I always smell.
I bought gripping gasses and tootin was pretty swell.
I got pissed off when I took my jeans off.
And farted so hard that you're my underwear backwards.
Like Chris Croft.
And every night I'm like,
Oh, dinner last.
Then fart at my ass.
Passing the fat, make you hate too fast.
Smell this honey.
Yo, be the way to man.
Girl, come on.

Said the problem was something.
Proled up my ass and died.
I shot him in the face with my vapor.
The worst happened later.
When I covered his desk with used toilet paper.
Walked in the strip club.
My intestines were filled up.
Moved the bartender took a dump in a tip club.
Went over to a dancer, had a fucking hug.
She lifted a leg up.
And I knew she was a fodder.
99% of my life I was lied to.
I just found out my mom got all gas and I do.
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper.
Fake record about strange noises.
Made on the crap.
You know you will dirt when the women rush to leave.
You drive to hold it back, but you won't need it.
I really love this guy.
White castle set up was pretty cool.
But I had to go.
Go drop the kids off.
And the pool.

Just like your fat fat chugged in ladies.
After you bite your seats on a plane.
Spilling your fingers that have yellow spain from sea to.
And see your toes.
And your piggy poodle.
