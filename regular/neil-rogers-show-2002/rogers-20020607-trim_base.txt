Now, the Neil Roger show on 560 WQA-A.
It's Friday, you bastard.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.
I ain't one big family man.
I'm a man named Mary.
Last I checked it ain't a sin to be a lesson.
Tell me why.
Why.
Oh tell me why.
Why did they think I'm gay?
Why.
You're gay.
You're gay.
You're gay.
You're gay.
Nice butt.
902 at 560 WQA.
What is soccer crap just goes on forever?
That's...
That's the hole.
You don't know how you're gonna get it.
I think that amazes me as I'm watching like little bits and pieces here in Espanol.
You'll be announced as screaming in hysterical.
And then you turn over and hear the bimbo.
You're a skier, but you're a skier.
I'm a T.S.A.
Holy crap.
I'm a T.S.A.
Totally different event.
A constipated Brit.
Lopez already having the bad effects in the few minutes he's been on the knee.
He didn't the gaming experience.
And you know the interesting thing of it is for me at least no matter which one I'm listening to you need an interpreter.
Anyway, George yesterday took another one of his goddamn sex pulls.
Are you ever gonna quit this crap?
Oh.
Or what?
Just for your mom, especially for her.
Well you are really stupid.
Man.
Yeah.
Never get the message.
Yeah, just for mom who thinks that George is a real pervert.
If she had any idea how little he was getting.
Anyway, girls who like getting laugh dances from other girls are.
And of course this is a ridiculous result on this pull.
And of course to share the double standards.
If I said that if we did a similar pull about guys, we discussed that.
And what did the audience say?
That yeah, that's horrible.
That would be gay.
Unless of course it's a sports thing.
Guys you know, pat each other on a butt.
Then it's okay if it's a sports thing.
Girls who like getting laugh dances from other girls are just having fun.
272 people out of almost 700 said that.
39%.
They're just having fun.
Girls just want to have fun.
Like Randy for example.
Remember that episode in Tampa?
I'm sure you do.
Of course.
What was she doing over there in that place?
I don't know.
I wasn't there with the dollhouse.
I read about it just like you.
Yeah, the dollhouse.
Bicarious 186.
Bisexual 134.
Now that bicarious thing.
I don't believe in that.
No.
But I put it on there anyway just because a lot of people say it.
Yeah, that's just a cop out.
Bicarious 186.
Bisexual 134 and Lesbians 104.
That's what I voted for.
Let's get laughed at.
Dance is from other girls are Lesbians.
Dikes.
I wrote bisexual.
Dikes.
I rest my case.
Trust me.
Now let me give our poll question today only for aerospace benefit
because it's going to take a couple of minutes before I get to the story about
that inspired this poll today.
About our G Reynolds getting fine because God I got a pile of stuff today man.
I got heavy piles here.
Son of Shinin going to be 70 today.
80s over the weekend.
It's beautiful in Toronto.
A.
No rain.
None of that tremendous humidity.
Air Canada got us here like 20 minutes early.
Nice going area.
I was my friend Helen doing it.
And all my other good pies on it air Canada boy.
They just love me.
They are well you know I feel bad about something you want to know why?
Why?
Because I'm sitting there at MIA waiting for the plane in the waiting area at the
gate.
And I don't know there were a bunch of women middle-aged women who like were quite a
ways away and they were like waving.
And I look behind me.
Have you ever had that happen when somebody waves they have died?
No idea who they are.
And you don't want to wave back because it's embarrassing if they're waving at somebody else.
Right.
And you don't know them.
And so I just sat there and I looked behind me.
There was nobody behind me.
And then once I got on a plane there in business class and a couple ladies came on and they
one knew me and then another one later came back up front to ask some sort of question from
the stewie and she also was a big fan.
But they were the same ones that were waving.
In fact the ones that were waving I noticed as they came on a plane and walked by me they
gave me kind of like a dirty look.
Now that was probably just paranoia.
But that's so if I if I offend anybody that's not that I don't respond.
It's like people will say to me, oh I passed you on the turnpike yesterday and you totally
ignored me.
Sometimes you're not paying attention.
You're all saying?
I know what you're saying.
I just don't like getting off that aura like I'm some kind of a stuck up old fart.
I mean when you look like this and you're fat and grotesque and balding you're not going to be who the hell am I?
Anyway here's our poll question today Eric.
What do you smoke?
What do you smoke?
That is a very simple question.
Yeah I like it.
Sigarettes?
Sigars?
Pot?
Sigarettes in pot?
Sigars in pot?
Used to smoke cigarettes but quit?
Used to smoke pot but quit?
Used to smoke cigarettes but quit?
Or don't smoke anything?
What about pipes?
Now we're not this isn't for pipes.
Okay forget about pipes.
Nobody smokes a pipe.
I smoke a pipe.
Yeah you you lay pipe is what you're thinking about not smoking pipe.
You smoke a yeah.
Now we're not talking about crack either okay?
No.
I don't want to get into that pipe.
Path of crap.
It's what's in it that counts.
What do you smoke?
Sigarette?
I'm not putting crack because I could put crack on air like I've told you before and I really mean this.
I try to out to be a judgemental person but in this case I'll make an exception.
The crack crowd makes me sick.
God are they annoying.
Can you hear that pigeon out there on my patio?
No.
People think pigeons are annoying because they like crap all over the place which is true.
But they also make those very annoying sounds.
You know the ones I'm talking about those kind of like Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, a coolingsand.
Yeah.
And I got one out there.
I wish I had a BB gun like Ted Williams.
I'll tell you that right now.
I'd open up that window and do a little number there.
I'll see you're bad.
You're not an animal lover.
No I don't like pigeons.
In fact I'm not that big on birds to begin with.
Although I have seen a...
What do you smoke cigarettes cigars pot cigarettes and pot now is it true that most people have smoked pot also smoke cigarettes no it's not.
As a matter of fact the hippies are militant and anti-sigarette people ironically.
What hippies you know the stereotype or you mean like Tommy real granola sandal wearing type like Tommy Tommy.
Tommy's not a hippie.
He sure it's how it looks like one and he smokes it and a hippie too.
No no.
He's a pot.
I heard you were stupid.
Anyway sorry Tommy by the way Tommy did a great job on putting something together for me.
Thank you Tommy you're the best.
What do you smoke cigarettes cigars pot cigarettes and pot cigars and pot which I would think well that would be for our goldstay for example when he gets out.
Used to smoke cigarettes but quit used to smoke pop but quit used to smoke cigars but quit or don't smoke anything.
Which it's you know a free country unless you could caught so I think if you don't smoke it they were not going to be judgmental about that.
Not like you have to feel left out.
Speaking of a big fat tub of crap like like all the way I think even fatter and more disgusting is Oprah's ice cream club next and asked in the
world today.
I haven't read about this or is this from yesterday I read about this days ago but I finally made it to South Florida.
When Oprah Winfrey recommends a book it's almost guaranteed to become a best seller so it follows that when she screams for ice cream America listens and you know I'm not
that impressed by this.
Here I am with one little radio show on one little horse ball radio station in Miami with a bad you know with a crappy AM signal and look at the
response we've had over the years and the different things like a bagel bites and the Ben and Jerry's fish food.
Bokeh burgers.
Bokeh burgers.
Snapple.
All the different things that I've really put on the map that just about sold out.
Bokeh burgers is a good example of that.
And here she's on national TV with her billion dollar personal wealth that disgusting bitch.
What Oprah Winfrey after Oprah announced on her talk show last week that greater ice cream is the best ice cream I've ever tasted.
Maylorder sales went through the roof by Monday the Cincinnati based company which has stores in Ohio and Kentucky which I never heard of in my life.
Since it received more than 700 orders that don't sound all that overwhelming to me.
No not really.
Maybe there were big orders.
Normally the company might have received 75 during that period.
It's an executive of ice president rich greater said this is the kind of mail order business we used to get during the holidays or when that fed pitch on TV opens up a big mouth.
Oprah first hated greater ice cream last year when a friend gave her a gift pack for Christmas.
GR e GR A E T E R I never heard of it in my life.
And you know something based on her taste in books and everything else it probably blows.
I would say that Ben and Jerry's is the best ice cream although the gelato in Germany I would say is the best ice cream.
Although I would also say Nestle's turtle is right in the running to.
Huh?
You got to go pretty far to have bad ice cream.
Now bad ice cream is like you know.
Hagen does is pretty weak.
Watery.
Very watery.
What's the mother better and eat these?
I feel bad saying that because that guy is such a nice guy that always gives me those coupons for the free 20 gallon tubs of E.
And I'll come eat these doesn't come like in pints like normal ice cream.
I guess they figured because the first time somebody buys it they're never going to buy it again.
So if they're going to try it they're going to no seriously they're going to force them to buy that big gigantic 10 gallon tub that it comes in like a like a goddamn waste basket.
And that's probably where it lined up anyway.
Eat these is very very weak but there are too many really bad ice creams are there?
Well I'm not a big ice cream person anyway.
Carvelle.
Carvelle's pretty weak.
Dairy queen.
That's not ice cream.
See I'm not I'm not into this thing people that eat soft serve and think that they're eating ice cream.
I mean if you like that that's fine.
Soft serve vanilla.
Oh man.
That is strictly for goyem.
Although I noticed that Carvelle is almost they buy Jews.
Why is that you think?
Why is that that's their business?
What do you mean by that?
I'm sure that was a family business.
Tom Carvelle wasn't Jewish.
Maybe he just liked them.
I don't think he was.
He's dead anyway.
Schwab add.
Oh it's better to do the break.
And then we got to think about it very jackasses calm.
A lot of stuff today baby.
We got a pile of crap here today.
Still England want Argentina nil.
Oh!
Don't you love the way they say that?
Well then when they have a scoreless tie they'll say oh and the final was nil nil.
Ah!
Soccer sucks baby.

A reminder from the home safety council.
960 to 560 WQAM happy Friday to avoid a beautiful day today.
Look at out my window.
It's a picture perfect day.
Anybody that says smokes the wicked weed by the way you better watch what you put down on that pole because they're probably they're probably tracing them don't you think?
I think probably Uncle Sam is tracing it because he wants you.
Schwab ad gets rebuff from CBS CBS and I mentioned this on the day when the market is just.
Oh man.
Whoo.
Those futures if there any indication of what's going to happen on wall screen today boy I just hide under the bed.
I would pull a tiny and hide under the bed.
Because it is looking really nasty man.
Now futures are down over 100 the Nasdaq futures are down over 50 I hate to break the news also to you but I don't think that the text stocks are ever coming back in fact.
I think a lot of these companies are going under including many that nobody ever thought Michael under like Palm.
Palm is like a dollar stock now.
Yep.
An Intel because they had a bad number yesterday or a bad outlook Intel is taking a down 4.5 bucks it's going to be like under 20 bucks pretty soon.
And some microsystems that you and I were screaming about what a great value was like it's 78 and then it went zooming up to 120 or whatever.
It's a $6 stock now.
Wow.
Now you watch a lot of these companies that they were touting is being so great including like Oracle and I mean I'm I'm I'm I know nothing don't give me wrong.
I don't want anybody selling stock based on my ramblings here but I just that you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that this was all part of a big scam.
Anyway CBS won't show a Charles Schwab TV commercial drawing a sleazy picture of Wall Street stock brokerages at a time the industry is spending off charges of abusive sales practices and of course that is.
Absolutely correct.
The commercial which other TV how about shittricks how's that doing anybody got a shittricks no I was sold a pile of shittricks.
At least part of that the commercial which other TV networks are airing they do be airing it features an executive urging brokers at an unidentified firm to tell customers that the stock is red hot even though the fundamental stink.
After promising to be ward whoever sells the most stock the executive encourages the brokers to put some lipstick on this pig.
Oh man put some lipstick on this pig love that.
Yeah in fact that was the last thing said before we left the building I think he was talking about scurran.
The derogatory language echoes descriptions used by mirror Lynch analyst and email discussions of she looked a little bit better this time by the way.
Scurran.
Yeah when I was there in April boy she looked like hell on wheels I'm serious she looked like she had just been.
Wow like she had done a what's her name Susan day you know beaten and bloodied and bruised you look battered.
But this time she looked at me now for her fairly human for her the derogatory language echoes descriptions used by mirror Lynch analyst and email discussions of stocks recommended as good investments to the firm's customers after the emails were obtained by New York state attorney general Elliott Spitzer.
Mirror Lynch last month paid a hundred million dollars to sell allegations that are recommended trouble stocks to win liquid of investment banking fees.
San Francisco based Schwab said the commercial part of an ad campaign launched May 16 wasn't spurred by early April revelations of the mirror Lynch emails it was not inspired by any particular firm Schwab spoke of and Glan Matheson said it was inspired by the generally reported and documented practices of Wall Street brokerages.
Several cable cable TV networks including CNBC CNN and Bravo have shown the commercial CBS rejected the ad was scheduled to debut on NBC last night during ER.
Some analysts said they suspect CBS's refusal to air the Yeshua bad has to do with the network's finances mirror Lynch does more business with CBS than Schwab a factor that probably led the network to think like an investment bank they went with the one paying them the most money.
How do you like that huh not that people are influenced by who's mirroring their hand or whatever but they are that's what it's all about oh boy those futures.
I don't want to get anybody in a bad mood it's Friday it's going to be a great weekend we got that big fight tomorrow that none of us are going to I hope Miguel's not going to be watching that.
No no thank God I said none of us real quick because I know George ain't going to waste his time watching that nice shirt is hell won't what about those red wins by the way huh.
Caroline to give him a good scare boy they got down to like a little over five minutes left the third period tied at one.
Arters Urbe played phenomenal again and just when you thought maybe another overtime I guarantee a Scotty Bowman was crappin in a 40 year old suit there probably soiled a couple of times but luckily they got that power play in
Fedor off score the first one and then they came back and draper scored real quick to get another one three one Detroit wins.
And it's a damn good thing for them they did this ain't back over there playing this time I'll tell you Caroline a highly underrated pretty damn good team.
So anyway Barry Jackass writes in this morning's Harold this is got to be mistaken Jesus Christ dolphins David bump by Albert on MNF radio CBS radio Westwood one decided not to renew Howard David's contract and will replace him with Mark Albert on Monday night football NFL playoff games and the Super Bowl industry sources said yesterday quite a very Jackass.
Of course we all know Barry stupid David the dolphins new play by play announcer on WQM has worked for Westwood once since 1979 was I surprised of course he said they elected to go in a different direction.
Although we enjoyed the national stage David said he's content calling dolphins games and hosting WQM's morning show such as it is WQM is not expected to retain the CBS radio Westwood one package because of scheduling conflicts Monday night football my shift to W. I. Z 9 40 which might give him like close to a one share but I doubt it.
Man I still can't get over those numbers this time nice go and PD Bulger just when you thought they've reached the number that they can't eclipse on the bottom on the low side they still do it.
Oh we got the pull up there already what do you smoke and I'm voting cigars not very many might I want to give my all been out of shape.
I don't think he had a killer cigars are killer.
That's all I smoke.
Pot. How many times did you vote on his George once and I voted for cigars in pot.
Oh pots got five already I used to smoke cigarettes but quit three don't smoke anything to cigars appear cigars and pot to use the smoke pot but quit two.
And probably couldn't afford anymore now how the prices on the streets like sky high now are they low.
Not the same as always.
No. Kind of like the coffee shops in Amsterdam no I don't think so.
No that's about half the price of the here cigarettes in pot one you and that's a good start on there.
And now let me get to the story that inspired a poll.
Oh I and what did I do that just Schmidt can't at start wait.
Uh oh no the reason being there's another thing later on in various column here it is on the floor is I unfold it.
Joseph Gaki who calls you and his baseball super regional on radio this weekend is still waiting word on WQM's choice to replace Mark Vandermeer who left the for the NFL's Houston Texans Q.A.M. needs to complete a contract with you and before the new announcers determined.
I didn't say I can't keep track of all his sports craft which just like I would either is just this enormous amount of energy or although there is a difference it's supposed to be a sports station.
But just a tremendous amount of time and energy devoted all at sports garbage which when you come right down to it very few people are listening to because all of those events that we carry on Q.A.M.
Just like when they were in I.O.D. there are for free on live TV almost every one of them.
Once in a while there might be a hercune game I don't know is that possible Miguel's ever hercune game it's not on TV local.
Yeah a lot a lot of times.
Get out of here.
They don't have a lot of times.
Well like I said but they still don't get a number even when they aren't on TV.
So Miguel tells me before the show today a scandalous story about the fact that there's a rumor that the Marlins are looking to play in the orange bull now and that they planted the seeds and there's a discussion going on behind closed doors about that about playing in the orange bull.
I mean are they crazy or what Jesus Christ.
Yeah that's what I'm thinking the orange bull what a location that is the place that nobody wants to go to.
Not to mention of course the fact that it's not a baseball place anyway you can't play baseball any orange bull but just out of desperation you know what let him do whatever the hell they want.
Just as long as they don't suck out any more tax money from the public let him play with themselves let him play wherever they want I don't care.
Reynolds tobacco find twenty million dollars for targeting teens as USA today.
A judge find R.G. Reynolds tobacco twenty million dollars yesterday ruling that the maker of Winston the camel cigarettes violated terms of 1998 tobacco settlement by running magazine ads aimed at teenagers.
The California Attorney General's office had sued the nation's number two tobacco company last year asking that it be punished by the way if you're thinking about calling us today don't do a faxist if you want because I took calls those three days I was down there and boy.
Wow I can still smell the aroma.
You know someday you know when you least expectable punch up a few again but that that was pretty weak wouldn't you agree with me absolutely nothing.
Wow how do you do yesterday all it was brutal was it really yeah why is that because of them.
See Monday and Tuesday it wasn't too bad and then by the time we got to Wednesday the well had run dry in other words they were out of material already again and the word had gotten out.
I see that's right forgot about that so those people that we finally unloaded the ones who want to hear me reading into one learn what's going on in the world those assholes those heavy mouth breathers they all came back.
So we're not taking a calls today I got too much stuff here the two hundred six billion dollar settlement between the industry in forty six states does not specifically mention magazine advertising but bars tobacco companies from taking any action directly or indirectly to target youth superior court judge Ronald Prager found Reynolds violated that agreement.
By advertising in magazines like spin vibe hot rod and rolling stone Reynolds reach teens is often as more often than adults the judge said.
He said Reynolds saw itself losing market share to whether companies and fought back with more aggressive ad campaign even though the likely affected these efforts was to cause significant exposure to youth.
It was or should have been apparent to the skillful and bright people who managed our J.R.s multi million dollar sophisticated print advertising campaign that youth were exposed to tobacco ads at level substantially similar to targeted adults smokers yada yada yada.
The attorney general's office had asked the judge to find Reynolds twenty five million dollars and the bandits advertising from fifty magazine often read by teens the judge didn't go so far as to ban advertising in specific magazines but ordered Reynolds to take reasonable measures to reduce its reach to teenagers quit try to get those teenagers to smoke Winston although Winston does taste good like a cigarette should.
And I walk a million miles for a camel and of course if you smoke new ports you'd be like walking the hand in hand with some hot number out there in the woods or is that the new porter is a Salem.

He returned the next day.
This time employee said he escaped with three or old B and two son of care electrical toothbrushes
valued at $500.
The hygiene's instrument retails a price range from 80 to $100.

Oh!
Detective said they believe the same man's responsible for shoplifting and other Walgreens
stores in the Tamarack area.
Anyone with information should call detective Patricia Fernandez or call
Brad Crimes Stoppers at $493.
Tips.
How do you like that?
We got the toothbrush.
Maybe he just wants to keep his teeth clean.
Maybe he knows about a lot of Brits and he'd like to give him like a little hint.
Although I don't think there's any hope in their case.
The toothbrush thief.
And the amazing thing is he sneaked out the door with these things
and evidently the alarm never went off.
You know how they have to put the thing over there.
They have to smear the scanner thing.
And yet how come about half of the time I walk out of Walgreens or records.
The guy damn buzzer goes off and I haven't been stealing nothing.
Because of that.
I know an owner rider.
I'm not even any Mitch rider.
Why?
Because of that metal plate you got in your head.
Oh, that could be it.
No, seriously, half of the time I walk out of it.
This is in the bells or ringing, you know.
And not that anybody's paying any attention, I should point out.
But I always do walk back in and the kid has to check out, especially if he's cute.
You know, I'll go back and say, hey, I don't got nothing.
And he'll say, yeah, I can see that.
Do you let him check?

Out of 93, we only got 3 people who smoke cigarettes.
Now cigarettes and pot, we got 12.
But even so, 15 out of...

Yeah, that's surprising to me.

He's a little child when I saw it.

Don't we have a PSA thing on here by Bokobrine where he's choking and gagging on it?
What the hell's the name of that?
He'll call it the Integg.
A Klugman?
No, not Jack Klugman.
Was Jack Klugman on Perry Mason?
I have no idea, but we do have a PSA by Jack Klugman.
I know that, but Jack Klugman, first of all, isn't dead.
That's number one.
Okay?
Yeah.

Hey, everybody got a light?
Hey, I'll tell you one thing.
Even if you don't smoke, you're going to die someday.
You heard that first right here on this show.
Even if you try to protect your lungs, you don't smoke anything.
Even if you don't get any second hand smoke, you're still going to die.
I'm not here promoting smoking.
It's a filthy disgusting habit that discolors your fingers and your tongue and everything.
And your teeth.
Thanks, your teeth.
If you want to look British, start smoking.
See, the Brits don't have to smoke to do that.
Don't they chew like a lot of tobacco?

Yeah.
I have no idea.
Oh, yeah.

Polk County Sheriff Sergeant arrested.
This is a great study.
Did you read this?
Yeah, I did.
This is amazing.
I'll get to that thing in Newsweek, but I think, well, we'll get to it.
Well, I'm good and ready, okay?
We got an important fish to fry here.
A lot of pre-stuff again.
Winter Haven.
News coverage of a fatal car crash witnessed by a Polk County Sheriff Sergeant has led to the officers' arrest on unrelated charges.
A confidential informant recognized Sergeant Scott Lawson as the officer would offer a job to two young men under the condition that he give them medical exams official said.
Lawson told the victims he met them through his work in law enforcement that he was a physician's assistant.
The physicals, the physicals included rectilharxane.
Let's hear it.
Oh.
God.
Stupid.
Lawson never delivered on the jobs and of course was not a physician's assistant official said.
Lawson 30-Far was charged yesterday with five counts of sexual battery and five counts of practicing health care.
The government of license, he resigned from the force yesterday.
He worked in the department for 11 years.
This is over in Winter Haven in Polk County.
Remember Polk's Allen Annie?
Who sang Polk's Allen Annie?
Don't know.
You know the song, don't you?
Yeah, I've heard it.
Was that CCR?
Polk's Allen Annie?
Very possible.
Very likely.
Oh, get the book.
I got the book right here.
I got the book.
What was that figure-row thing?
What do you keep playing that for today, filler?
Before the show, George was still there.
Polk's Allen Annie was by Tony Joe White.
If you'd have conducted a regular exam, I still wouldn't have had any idea who that was.
I don't know from Tony Joe White.
Anyway, the two victims of this cop were described as men who were about 18 to 19.
You repeatedly gave exam to the victims over a period of months and arrest reports.
I mean, how stupid could they have been, huh?
How many times does a guy have to stick his finger in your rectum?
Before you finally realized that maybe there's something else going on there,
that's just your regular exam.
That's what they call it.
And make me think of that visit to my mother's bogus doctors office there a few days ago.
Oh, and by the way, thanks to my friend Ed for getting me my blood test results,
my cholesterol's only 207, which is a little bit high, but not that bad.
LDL's 156, that needs some work.
But they're not that bad, really.
Pregnus arrives for like 96.
That's under 100's pretty good, you know, especially considering all the crap I was eating here for a while.
Am I eating any more of it?
No.
No, not too much.
A little bit maybe.
Remember that song by the Jarmelles a little bit of crap?
No.
You wouldn't even know the real song, a little bit of soda.
So, sure, we have parties about it.
By the Jarmelles.
Well, that's a little bit of crap is not all bad.
The informant called the sheriff's office after lost him headlines last week following a fatal car crash.
On Friday, he was following a car with a young man and teenage boy inside.
Oh, no, this is terrible.
No, it's this is terrible, man.
On Friday, he was following a car with a young man and teenage boy inside when their vehicle left the road and smashed into pine trees.
Miles Gregory White, 16 of Lake Hamilton was killed.
And the driver Adam Luka, Jacobi, 18 of Dundee, Luka, was injured in the 3M car rash on Lake Hachenea, Hia Road.
Hachenea, have road.
Lawson reportedly told his superior he was not chasing the car at the time of the crash.
But was trying to check it out because he felt the vehicle was suspicious.
Maybe he just wanted to get a peek.
It wasn't clear how news coverage of that case prompted the informant to offer the tip on the sex abuse cases.
But he did. He offered his tip.
That is just incredible.
How many times that's a good poll question one day will do?
How many times do somebody have to stick their finger in your...
...break them before you start questioning the emotes?
20 or 30? I guess it all depends on whether they use a glove or not.
I was a little suspicious of that doctor the other day in Hollywood because you know,
if he was doing like a real wreck that was in like a prostate exam,
generally put a glove on.
Miami Herald wins Pulitzer for coverage of alien raid.
How sad.
The Herald's coverage of alien Gonzalez seizure by armed federal agents and the emotional aftermath of the pre-dawn raider in the newspaper
at 17th Pulitzer Prize on Monday. Well, isn't that great?
The Herald's entry is saga of alien the raid in the reunion, one in the breaking news category.
How's the fisherman doing as a matter of fact now that we are talking about this? Gone fishing.
A dramatic photo of armed federal agents with weapons drawn facing the terrified boy.
And of course we know that's the supposed fisherman in the closet with little boy.

Here are some more good news. Oh, I'll save that.
Here's a little message, okay? Very short story.
Since the councils, the bishops and all these people are getting together,
they're holding their meat next week in Dallas and they're having a little bit of a difficult time figuring out exactly how to do it to passify everybody.
Take a page out of this story from the Vietnamese, all right?
Hanhoy Vietnam, a teacher convicted of raping six elementary school students, has been executed by a firing squad,
a court official in Vietnam's central highland said today.
The Yen Van Fu, 37, was sentenced to death in 1999 for raping six of his students, eight and nine over five days in 1997.
He sexually molested another six students, official son of condition of anonymity.
Fu was executed on May 22, the official said.
Fu, a teacher in Daklag Province, 220 miles north of Ho Chi Minh City, was arrested after the parents reported him to the police.
More and more cases of child rape and sex abuse of a reported Vietnam state control press in recent years,
rape of a child under 13 is punishable by death in Vietnam. You know what I say to that?

Kovala Longpur is an easy choice if you're looking to lie low.
Clean and modern, with reliable telephones, banks and internet service.
The Malaysian city is a painless flight for most world capitals,
and Muslim visitors don't need visas to enter the Islamic country.
That may explain why I'll kind of chose to sprawling with droplets for a secret planning summit in early January 2000.
Tucked away in a possible urban condominium overlooking a Jack Nicklaus Design golf course,
nearly a dozen of Osama Yamanma bin Laden's trusted followers posing as tourists,
plotted future terrorist strikes against the U.S.
At the time, the men had no idea that they were being closely watched,
or that the CIA already knew some of their names.
A few days earlier, U.S. intelligence had gotten wind of the Kite gathering,
special branch, Malaysian security service agreed to follow and photograph the suspected terrorists.
They snatched pictures of the men sightseeing and ducking into cybercafe face to check Arabic websites.
What happened next to U.S. counterterrorism officials say,
may be the most puzzling and devastating intelligence failure in the critical months before September 11th.
A few days after the Kovala Longpur meeting Newsweek has learned,
the CIA tracked one of the terrorists, Nauwaf Al-Zahami.
Did I say that right? No. Nauwaf Al-Hazmi, as he flew from the meeting to L.A.
Agents discovered that another of the men, Khalid Al-Midhar,
had already obtained a multiple entry visa and allowed him to enter and leave the U.S.
as he pleased, they later learned that he had in fact arrived in the U.S.
on the same flight as Al-Hazmi.
Yet astonishingly, the CIA did nothing with this information.
Agency officials did not tell the I.S.
which could have turned them away at the border, nor did they notify the FBI,
which could have covertly tracked them to find out their mission.
Instead, during the year and nine months after the CIA identified them as terrorists,
Al-Hazmi and Al-Midhar lived openly in the U.S. using their real names,
obtaining driver's licenses, opening bank accounts, and enrolling in flight schools
until the morning of September 11th, when they walked aboard American Airlines Flight 77 and crashed into the Pentagon.
Until now, the many questions about intelligent shortcomings leading up to the attacks
that focused on the FBI's clear failure to connect various vague clues that might have put them on the trail of the terrorists.
Last week in the aftermath of the Minnesota Agent Colleen Rowley's scathing letter
ripping the FBI for ignoring warnings from the field, director Robert Mueller announced the series of reforms
aimed at modernizing the Bureau.
All along, the CIA's counter-terrorism-based camp for the agency's war on Vin Laden was sitting on information
that could have led federal agents right to the terrorist doorstep.
Al-Midhar and Al-Hazmi, parading across American plane site, could have not have been easier to find.
Newsweek has learned that when Al-Midhar's visa expired, the State Department not knowing any better,
simply issued a new one in June 2001, even though by then the CIA had linked him to one of these suspected bombers of the U.S. as cool in October of 2000.
The two terrorists frequent meetings with the other September 11th perpetrators could have provided federal agents
with a roadmap to the entire cast of 9-11 hijackers, but the FBI didn't know what's supposed to be looking for them until three weeks before the strikes
when CIA director George Tennant worried that an attack was imminent ordered agency analysts to review their files.
It was only then, August 23rd, 2001, that the agency sent out an all-points bulletin launching law enforcement agents on a frantic and feudal search for the two men.
Why didn't the CIA share its information sooner? We could have done it a lot better, that's for sure one top intelligence officer told Newsweek.
The CIA's belated and reluctant admission now makes it impossible to avoid the question that law enforcement officials have tried to duck for weeks could we have stopped them?
Tennant has vigorously defended his agency's performance in the months before the attacks, in February he told a Senate panel he was proud of the CIA's record.
He insisted that the terrorist strikes were not due to a failure of attention and discipline and focus and consistent effort, and the American people needed to understand that.
Yet last week intelligence officials like knowledge that the agency made at least one mistake, failing to notify the State Department and the I and S of the men could have been stopped at the border.
CIA officials, who have been preparing for the start of a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing this week, seem it will loss to explain how this could have happened.
The CIA is usually low with the share information with other government agencies for fear of compromising sources and methods.
CIA officials also say at the time Al-Midhar and Al-Hazmiyat are the country in January of 2000 they hadn't yet been identified as been law-demeterist despite the attendance at the Malaysia meeting.
It wasn't known for sure that they were all kind of bad guy operators as one official.
CIA officials also point out that the FBI agencies assigned the CIA's counterterrorism center were at least informed about the Malaysia meeting and the presence of Al-Midhar and Al-Hazmiyat the time it occurred.
But FBI officials protested that they only recently learned about the most crucial piece of information that the CIA knew Al-Hazmiyat was in the country and that Al-Midhar could enter at will.
That was unforgivable said one senior FBI official, this led to a series of intense and angry encounters among U.S. officials in the weeks after September 11th.
At one White House meeting last fall, Wayne Griffith, a top state department consular official, was so furious that his office hadn't been told about the two men that he blew up at a CIA agent, Griffith declined a comment.
To bolster their case, FBI officials are now prepared a detailed chart showing how agents could have uncovered the terrorist plot if they learned about Al-Midhar and Al-Hazmiyat, giving their frequent contact with at least five of the other hijackers.
There is no question we could have tied all 19 hijackers together the official said it was an old fashioned interrogation and eavesdropping that first led U.S. intelligence agent to the Al-Qaeda plotters.
In the summer of 1998, only a couple weeks after bin Laden operatives truck bombed two U.S. embassies in Africa, the FBI got a break.
One of the United World War B bombers had been caught.
While Hammond, Rachead, Dowd, Al-Hawwali, whatever to hell his name is, a young Saudi from a wealthy family became a fierce bin Laden loyalist, was supposed to have killed himself in the blast.
Instead, he got out of the truck at the last moment and fled.
He was arrested in a seating-iron lobby hotel waiting for his compatriots to smuggle him out of the country.
Questioned by the FBI, Al-O-Hawwali made a detailed confession.
Among the informed information he gave agents was the telephone number of Al-Qaeda's safe house in Yemen owned by a Yemeni bin Laden loyalist named Ahmed Al-Hada who turns out to be Al-Midhar's father-in-law.
U.S. intelligence began listening in on the telephone line of the Yemen House, described in government documents as a Al-Qaeda logistic center where terrorists, including the Africa bombings, later the Kuala Tak and Yemen were planned.
Operatives around the world phoned Al-Hada with information which was then related to bin Laden in the Afghan Mountains.
In late December 1999, intercepted conversations with the Yemen phone tipped off agents to the January 2000 Kuala Lumpur Summit and to the names of at least two of its participants, Ahmed Al-Hazmi.
The condo where the emitting to replace was a weekend getaway owned by Yazid Sufat, a U.S. educated microbiologist who has become a radical Islamist and bin Laden follower.
It was arrested last December when he returned from Afghanistan where he had served as a field medic for the Taliban.
Sufat's lawyer says his clients let them in state as a place because he believes in allowing his property to be used for charitable purposes, but he claims Sufat had no idea they were terrorists.
To be continued momentarily, can I continue momentarily?
Well, it goes on not that much longer, but it's very disturbing, I think, and it's disturbing, very aggravating.
12 minutes after 10 at 5.60 WQO, 10 other things that's aggravating is shopping for a new mattress and not saying it's aggravating to me that people are doing because they don't know how to do it right.
Shopping for a new mattress requires one thing, a telephone. That's all you have to have.
Make one easy phone call to our good friends at Dala mattress, that's all you have to be doing. 1-800 mattress. That's all you got to know is that number.
Because if you want the top quality name brand mattress of your choice, if you want a price that's unbeatable every day of your life and if you want delivery service, that's phenomenal.
And of course that 30 day home comfort guarantee that all of these things can be made just by one phone call to 1-800 mattress.
Like I always do 1-800-MAT-T-R-E-S. You want SIRTA, CELY, SIMONS, KING, COLIMA, no matter what you want, they got it in stock ready for immediate delivery.
And speaking delivery, they deliver it right to your door, take away the crappy old bedding, whatever it's convenient for you.
Any two-hour winner that you pick, noon to two, one to three, three to five, et cetera, and so on.
Any day of the week, seven days a week. And like I said, they give you that 30 day home comfort trial.
Let's you check out the new mattress the right way, the only smart way by sleeping on it.
So if you want to be sleeping like a baby, if the old mattress is bumpy and lumpy and worn out and giving your back all kinds of heck,
pick up that phone and call them right now, toll-free. Did I say heck? 1-800 mattress. Well, that was kind of stupid.
1-800-MAT-T-R-E-S. You look them up on their wicked worldwide website.

Anger management classes.
What? Anger management classes.
Ed DeVry. You little bitch.
Light me, you fat bastard.
By the way, my cronitis is a douchebag.
Do you see this, Fax? I'm sure you did.
You sent them. It's awesome.
If you want me to read that before I finish with the...
No, no. I'm hanging over here.
Oh. It says good morning, Neil.
Don't know if you've seen or heard about the following article.
But upon reading it, I thought that hellerist parody about Clear Channel said to good by English Rose.
It's from the free rag southeast performers made 2002 issue.
Can't listen to radio anymore because...
Well, anyway.
Michael Moot in Highlyah, who says my cronitis is a douchebag.
Okay, I'll get to that, but I've got to finish this first.
Okay, can I do that?
See, I'm getting so much stuff piled up here. It's a bad, bad.
And all of it's got to get on to it.
Oh, speaking of bad, look at that.
Can I get off of that?
I see I'm only watching that from a sadistic point of view.
That market stuff.
Because it makes me feel like maybe finally for like Stevie Wonder would say, for once in my life.
I did something kind of like, oh, hi, Stevie. How you doing? Wave to Stevie.
Okay, getting back to this news week article.
After the meeting, Malaysian intelligence continued to watch the condo at the CIA's request.
But after a while, the agency lost interest.
And agents kept up the surveillance they might have observed another beneficiary of sous-fat's charity.
Zacharias Masawi, who stayed there on his way to the US later that year.
The Malaysians say that were surprised by the CIA's lack of interest following the co-op or forum meeting.
We couldn't fathom it really.
Raiya Siyat, team Malaysian's legal affair minister told Newsweek.
There was no show of concern.
Immediately after the meeting, Al-Hazmi boarded a plane to Bangkok where he met a connecting flight to LA on January 15, 2000.
Since the CIA hadn't told the State Department to put his name on the watch list of suspected terrorists,
or told the INS to be on the lookout forum, he breathed through the airport and into America.
Al-Midhar was also on that plane.
Those CIA agents didn't know it at the time.
The CIA is forbidden from spying on people inside the United States.
Had it followed standard procedure and passed the baton of the FBI once they crossed the border,
agents would have discovered that Al-Midhar and Al-Hazmi were just visiting California.
They were already living there.
The men had moved into an apartment in San Diego two months before the co-op or forum meeting.
The CIA's reluctance to divulge what it knew was especially odd because as 2000 dawned,
US law enforcement agencies were on red alert.
Certain that had been law-danced right somewhere in the world would come at any moment.
There was certainly reason to believe bin Laden was setting men here to do a grave harm.
Just a few weeks before an alert customs inspector had caught another kind of terrorist,
Ahmed Rassam, as he tried to cross the Canadian border in a rental car packed with explosives,
his mission was to blow up LA airport.
Perhaps agency officials let down their guard after warnings about a Millennium Eva-Tac never materialized.
Whatever the reason, Al-Hazmi and Al-Midhar fell off their radar screen.
Radar screen, what did I just say?
Radar.
No, maybe they were there to play for the raiders.
Free to do as they please, the 25-year-old Al-Hazmi and 26-year-old Al-Midhar went about their terrorist training in Southern California.
They told people they were buddies from Saudi Arabia hoping to learn English and become commercial airline pilots.
The clean-shaving Al-Hazmi and Al-Midhar played soccer in the park with other Muslim men and prayed they required five times an Athearia mosque.
Watch out for those soccer people!
They bought seasoned passes to see world and dined on fast food, leaving the burger wrapper strewn around their sparsely furnished apartment.
Watch out for people who eat fast food!
And despite their religious convictions, the men frequented Aria Strip clubs.
Hey, how do you like that? Just like the ones in Florida?
They responded on that the men would rarely use the telephones in their apartment instead they routinely went outside to make calls on mobile phones.
People who knew the men recall they couldn't have been more different.
Al-Hazmi was outgoing and cheerful, making friends easily.
He once posted an ad online seeking a Mexican mail order bride and worked diligently to improve his English.
By contrast, Al-Midhar was dark and brooding and expressed disgust with American culture.
One evening he tried to day Muslim acquaintance for watching immoral American television.
If you're so religious, why don't you have facial hair the French out back?
Al-Midhar pated him condescendingly on the knee. You'll know someday, brother, he said.
Neither man lost sight of the primary mission, learning to fly airplanes.
Al-Midhar and Al-Hazmi took their flight lessons seriously but they were impossible to teach.
It struck the Rick Garza at Sorby's flying club gave both men a half dozen classes on the ground before taking them up at a single engine Cessna in May.
They were only interested in flying big jets, Garza recalls, but Garza soon gave up on his hapless students.
I just thought they didn't have the aptitude, he says they were like dumb and dumber.
Had law enforcement agents been looking for Al-Hazmi and Al-Midhar at the time they could have easily tracked them through bank records, and September 2000 Al-Hazmi opened a $3,000 checking account at the Bank of America branch.
The men also used their real names on driver's licenses, social security cards and credit cards.
When Al-Midhar brought a dark blue 1988 Toyota Corolla for $3,000 cash, he registered it in his name.
He later signed the registration over to Al-Hazmi whose name was on the papers when the car was found at Delos International Airport on 11th of September.
Of course agents might have used another resource to pinpoint their location, the phone book.
Page 13 of the 2000-2001 Pacific Bell White Pages contains a listing for Al-Hazmi, Nawaf-M-Al-Hazmi, 64-1 Mount Aitor Road and the number at Settermann-So-On.
By then though the case seems to have gotten a lot deeper in the CIA's files, but Al-Midhar's name and face surface yet again in the aftermath of the October 2000 bombing of the coal.
Within days of the attack, a team of FBI agents flew to Yemen to investigate. They soon began closing in on suspects.
One was a man called Taufik bin Atash aka Khalad, a fierce one-legged fighter.
When analysts at the CIA's counter-terrorism center in Langley, Virginia pulled out the file on Khalad, they discovered pictures of him taking at the Kuala Lumpur meeting.
In one of the shots he's standing next to Al-Midhar.
If as the CIA now claims it wasn't certain that Al-Midhar had terrorist connections, it certainly knew it now, and yet the agency still did nothing and notified nobody.
In mid to late 2000 Al-Midhar left San Diego for good. It appears that he spent the next several months bouncing around the Middle East and Southeast Asia, while he was away his visa expired a potentially big problem.
Yet since the CIA was still not sharing information about Al-Midhar's al-Qaeda connections, the State Department's consular office in Saudi Arabia simply rubber stamped him a brand new one.
Al-Midhar returned to the US on July 4, 2001, flying it in New York. He spent at least some of the time leading up to September, traveling around the East Coast, and at least once meeting with Mohammed Ata and several other 9-11 Plotters in Las Vegas.
Meanwhile, Ahasmi, having flocked out of two California flight schools, decided to try his luck in Phoenix early in 2001.
There he hooked up with another al-Qaeda terrorist in training, Hanji Hanihanshur, who eventually piloted flight 77.
In April 2001, Al-Hasmi headed to Eastern was pulled over for speeding. Oklahoma State Trooper C.L. Parkins ran Al-Hasmi's California driver's license through the computer, checked to see if his car was stolen and made sure there wasn't a warrant out for Al-Hasmi's arrest.
When nothing came up, he issued the terrorist two tickets, totaling 138 bucks, and sent him on his way. The tickets were not discovered until after 9-11.
Like Al-Midhar, Al-Hasmi eventually went east spending time in New Jersey in Maryland, on August 25, he used his credit card to purchase two tickets for flight 77.
Two days earlier, CIA officials frankly and frantically awoke to their mistake. That summer, as US intelligence picked up repeated signals that Vin Laden was about to launch a major assault, tenant ordered a staff to scrub the agency's files, looking for anything that might help them thwart whatever was coming.
It didn't take long to discover the file on Al-Midhar and Al-Hasmi, CIA officials checked with the INS, only discovered that Al-Midhar had traveled out of the country and was allowed back in on his new visa.
On August 23, the CIA sent out an urgent cable labeled immediate to the State Department, customs INS and FBI, telling them to put the two men on the terrorism watch list.
The FBI began an aggressive full-field investigation. Agent searched all nine Mirriott hotels in New York City, the place Al-Midhar had listed as his destination on his immigration forms in July.
They also searched hotels in LA where the two men originally entered the country back in 1999.
But it's unclear whether agents scoured public records for driver's licenses and phone numbers, or tried to track plane ticket purchases, in preparation for their mission the men had gone to ground.
Now amid the escalating blame wars in Washington, federal agents are left and wonder, how different things might have been.
Oh my God! A big purple one! I knew it was coming up.
Now amid the escalating blame wars in Washington, federal agents are left to wonder how different things might have been if they'd started that search nearly two years before.
The FBI's plan that could have unraveled the plot by watching Al-Hasmi and Al-Midhar and connecting the dots between them and their terrorist teams compelling.
The links would not have been difficult to make. Al-Hasmi met up with 100 of the flight 77 pilot in Phoenix, late 2000.
Six months later in May 2001, the two men showed up in New Jersey and opened up shared bank accounts with two other plotters, Ahmed Al-Khamati and Majed Mokad.
The next month, Al-Hasmi, I love these names. Mokad? Mokad? Mokad? Mokad? Mokad? Mokad? Mokad? Mokad? Mokad? Mokad? Mokad? Mokad? Mokad? Mokad? Mokad? Mokad? Mokad? Mokad? Mokad? Mokad? Mokad? Mokad?

which I got this three way down in the pile somewhere,
which I probably won't get to,
but maybe tomorrow or on Monday.
Isn't that great that they're using
our taxpayer of time and money for stuff like that?
What a shocker.
Yeah.
Makes me want a bar right here on the goddamn ear.
How's that pool coming about smoking?
That's another thing that they're spending a lot of time
just like John Astroff said.
Let's get the pot people.
We can't get the terrorists,
but let's at least get the pot people.
Oh!
Put them all in jail for 20 years.
212 votes on our pool.
What do you smoke?
I don't smoke anything.
You know, we ought to be asking Greg,
read that. What do you smoke?
He must be smoking something.
I don't smoke anything 68.
Oh, that's pulling away.
Do you believe that?
Yeah, I do actually.
Oh.
Pot 39.
That's a smoke.
I used to smoke cigarettes, but quit 29.
Cigarettes and pot 25.
Boy, that's a double.
That's a double dipper.
Cigars 19.
Cigars and pot 16.
Used to smoke pot but quit 9.
Cigarettes 6.
And I used to smoke cigars, but quit only 1.
And of course, that's because nobody
quit smoking cigars, Mom.
Now, who just died here a little while ago?
That was a big cigar smoker.
Oh, no, it wasn't somebody that just died.
I'm sorry.
And you wouldn't know anyway.
It was Pat Quinn, the coach at least.
But who is the couple of games in the Carolina series?
Because they rushed from the hospital
because he was having chest pains.
And he's a big fat, heavy guy who likes a little
little, a little pop every now and then pluss
is chomping on cigars all day.
And they said, give up the cigars.
And he said, well, I don't inhale them.
And they said a big deal.
I just mentioned that in passing.
They're not the best for your health,
but those of us who smoke cigars, we never give them up.
I don't smoke as many as I used to.
And I certainly don't smoke those big fat gut ventures.
The ones that taste like donkey crap, but never less.
Pretty hard to give up cigar.
Yeah, it just wants in a while.
This may be 15, 20 of a day like hell.
Here's good news.
Arrangements are being made in Lakeland, Florida
for R&B singer R Kelly,
Diserender to Chicago police today.
I'm charges of child pornography
according to a spokesman.
And amazing how everybody's got a spokesman.
I think that's your problem, George.
I think you need a spokesman.
I do.
Anybody want to volunteer?
No.
Kelly posted bond was released from jail in Florida.
The Polk County Sheriff's Department said yesterday.
A lot of stuff going on in Polk County, you know what?
It's enough to make me want to play Polk's cell
on any if I had it, but I don't have it.
He was arrested in Florida Wednesday hours
after he was indebted by a grand jury in Chicago
and 21 counts of child pornography,
stemming from a videotape that allegedly
shows the start performing sexual acts
with a 14-year-old girl.
And George wants to see the tape.
No, I think why not?
Because he's at it.
Why do you just kind of like ignore him?
You don't want to see what he looks like?
No.
Yes, you do.
Why do you lie like that?
Because I don't.
Okay.
Anybody believe him?
I mean, all these emphatic denials are coming.
Stupid.
The 35-year-old singer whose full name is Robert Kelly
denies the allegations.
Kelly Spokesman, Alan Mayer, said at the time of the Grammy
winning singers arrival in Chicago was not yet definite,
but he would turn himself over to police sometime today.
If convicted, Kelly could be sentenced up to 50 years in prison
and find a maximum of 100 grand.
I'm not buying his records anymore.
Authority said investigation was launched February 1.
After the Chicago sometimes,
newspaper received an anonymous videotape along with the claim
the man in the video was Kelly.
The paper turned the tape over to police,
which then had its ex-cremes unit investigate further.
Investigators interviewed more than 50 witnesses
went before the grand jury and identified the singer
as the person in the video authority said,
the FBI crime lagged at lab in Cuatico, Virginia,
authenticated the tape they said.
Cook County State's attorney, Richard Devine,
said the grand jury in Dated Kelly was best known for a smashed hit.
I believe I can fly on seven counts of videotaping the sex acts,
seven counts of producing the video and seven counts of soliciting
or enticing the girl and having the act in the first place.
Authorities were not coming on the identity of the girl in the videotape.
The Chicago sometimes said she was the then 14-year-old daughter
of an associate of our Kelly's,
but added that the girl and her parents have denied the allegations.
Somebody we know once told me you don't mess around with associate's daughters.

Like this one from the Harold priest faces fourth sex abuse claim
A fourth former altar boy accused suspended priest Richard Castolanos of sex abuse yesterday
Charging in a lawsuit that cast Alonus and another priest molested him at San Isidro church in Pompato Beach in the late 80s
Kenneth Mathias a 28-year-old broard county man said in the suit that he was abused by the two priests when he was 15 from
1988 to 89 after family problems sent him to the Catholic Church for guidance
Instead of how oh yeah, they'll give you a helping hand. All right
Instead of help accorded the suit Mathias found only violation of his trust leaving him with emotional scars that later led him into drug abuse
He said he was molested by Castolanos numerous times during overnight stays at the priest told him the suit said
It also to tell an episode of alleged abuse by another priest at the church whom he knew only his father are nulfo
The ex altar boys lawyer said late yesterday that his client has been arrested 11 times and mostly drug charges as
identified the other priest as our nulfo are in India
A.R.A. N.D.I.A. Randia the lawyer said he plans to amend the lawsuit today
Church records your randia at San Isidro in 1988 and 89 and in 1991 at St. Rita's Church in Palm Beach County
The suit charges that the archdiocese of Miami which covers Monroe, Dayton, Broward County's new or prior abuse allegations against Castolanos
But to not remove him instead church officials continue to hold Castolanos out as a Catholic priest who could be trusted with minor
parishioners the suit said a spokesman for the archdiocese said the church would not respond to the allegations because officials hadn't seen it yet in the suit either
Castolanos lawyer Gabel's attorney Gonzalo Dortha said he could not comment about the suit because he hadn't seen it in
Generally said his client remains steadfast that those allegations are false and unfounded
Castolanos is known in San Flores the charismatic host of the television show in the word with father Ricardo
on channel 45 in Miami's been passed to San Isidro for 20 years. Isn't that one of your favorite shows?
I watch it daily religiously
Castolanos 56 is over now. Let me ask you before I continue with this since I'm back here now
We have a little bit of tech or you know, even though I was not here yesterday
It's a damn good thing we check this all out and Miguel Winden Aaron got on a Julio so to speak
Can't you see that you see Miguel mountain who yeah, yeah
Conjure's up really an interesting image, but at any rate that we got it all straightened out
How does it sound today sounds? I like one tone of it crispy clear and you sound like you know
Mumbly yeah
No, I was just thinking stupid like that
Castolanos 56 already is being sued in two other sex abuse cases
But it's been named in a complaint letter the arts diocese and alleged abuser in the third case the 56 year old
Priest was suspended by the arts diocese last month after two other former altar boys accused him of sexually abusing them in the 70s
For years the arts diocese's new evaluations of abuse made against this priest
And they didn't do anything else other than launch the Ronin eternal investigation that cleared him
Said an attorney Joel McGullenick who's representing Matthias along with attorney Jane Mosquitz
That's one of my favorite names in the world Mosquitz and Lipschitz
According to the suit Matthias became an altar boy at Santa Cedro in 1988 after his family moved to Florida from New York
The alleged abuse by Castolanos the suits as began with a priest requiring back rubs and
Processed progressed rather to overnight stays during which the boy would wake up to find the priest masturbating and finally him
The abuse occurred as often as three times a week for up to seven weeks
Matthias lawyers said yesterday Matthias said in the suit that he never reported the allegations against Castolanos to anyone
The suit also detailed one episode of alleged abuse in December 1988 by the man
Matthias knew his father Arnolfo
They were in a car alone after an arts diocese sponsored Christmas event in Miami at a stoplight
Arnolfo reached over on zip Matthias pants and began to funnel in the suit said
Matthias was in shock and unsure what to do
But the precinct the boys reactions stopped fondling in the suit said
The following morning the priest allegedly gave Matthias 300 dollars to buy gifts for his relatives telling him to remain silent because what happened was
Normal amongst Latin men in court of the suit. Well, what's wrong with that?
I'm gonna read that sentence again
In fact, I'm gonna read the previous sentence again too
Because it goes to show you once again just like this whole pre-sting that I've been screaming about for 20 years long
Beep for became fashionable and before became so widely realized to be true
At a stoplight Arnolfo reached over on zip Matthias his pants and began to funnel him the suit said
Matthias was in shock and unsure what to do
But the precinct the boys reactions stopped fondling in the suit said the following morning the priest allegedly gave
Matthias 300 dollars to buy gifts for his relatives telling him to remain silent because what happened was normal amongst Latin men
according to the suit
Is that normal?
Absolutely correct sir
Among Latin men
And ex alter boys said the suit that he reported the incident to a church official named Deacon Bernardo assured Matthias that the matter be taken care of
The next day our nofo was transferred out of the parish the suit said Matthias attorney said he's not yet obtained the full name of the Deacon
Maybe it was Deacon Dolson
Or you didn't see that movie did you? What's wrong?
The one with Jack lemon? No
What the hell was the name of that movie?
I can never think of the name of that. God always knew it was such a good movie
Also yesterday the art steinsens confirmed that another Broward priest the reverendial Dordy has been placed on administratively from his church
St. Vincent's in Margate
Oi!
In art steinsens spokesman would not say whether there was a sexual abuse allegation against that priest the art steinsens issued a statement while conducting a review of our files
An accusation of an incident in excess of 20 years ago came to our attention in accordance with our policy father Dordy was placed on administratively pending investigation
Dordy's attorney Christenay West had his absence was not related to pedophilia. Thank God. Oh God.
What was the name of that movie? Was it in the name of the father? No. Was it priest? No. Okay. Priest. I don't know.
Don't be pumping that movie man. That's that's sacrilegious and certainly almost entirely true. Anybody out there see priest? They had their thumb on it.
Judge refuses to renews bail for Shanley. Here's some good news. Oh!
Justice on the state's highest court denoted request yesterday from a retired priest charge which child raped at his $300,000 be reduced. They said no.
No thanks.
Reverend Paul Shanley claimed he was not a flight risk and was nearly broke but just as John grainy of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that Shanley failed to demonstrate a clear error of law or an abuse of discretion on the part of the superior court were said to bail.
Attorney Frank Modato would not ask for a specific amount for Shanley. He told grainy in a hearing yesterday that Shanley was a candidate for release on personal recognizance. However, middle sex county prosecutor Lynn Rooney said Shanley had no remaining local ties to keep him in the area. She also cited past letters by Shanley suggesting he might leave the country.
Last month Shanley's bail was reduced from 750 to 300,000 dollars but he remained unable to post bail.
Shanley was publicly advocated sex between men and boys as accused of raping a boy over a six-year period in the 1980s including a church confessional.
Modano said Shanley still had supporters who could raise some money for him. His niece to resist Shanley criticized media coverage of Shanley's case after he has no hearing.
The information that's been released in the media has been for the sole purpose of sensationalism sound bites and self-serving lawyerism she said. This case should be tried in the courtroom not in the press room.
Earlier this week, a lawyer representing another man who claims Shanley repeatedly raped him when he was a child made public nearly a thousand pages of the personnel files of ten other accused priests.
A judge ordered the art sti-sees to turn over the files in the civil case against Shanley. Attorney Rod McLeese said the file show the art sti-sees had a pattern of transferring priests even after allegations of abuse as we well know on his show.
Do we know it? You bet your sweet ass.

It's the new book that's shocking the country after 20 years shaggy of Scooby Doo speaks out disclosing the behind the scenes antics that could bring down the whole cartoon industry.
Like I tell you, like we weren't just solving mysteries in that mystery van right Scoob.
Like we used to have a bumper sticker on the back that said when his fans are rockin don't come and ockin.
Like I got to tell you Velman Daphne, Les Bansitty, Carpet Munchers, Belly Robin.
Yep, I know what's hard to believe. Scrappy Doo.
Like the only reason like he got his job he was pimping for Daphne.
Like how about Pratt? Like how many guys do you know that were a yellow scar?
Like that's right. Scooby and I used to sit in the front of the mystery van and like do bongeheads and watch Velman Daphne get it on.
Like what do you think we ate so much?
It's the new book. Scrooby Doo.
Like we would have got away with it had it not been for those damn kids.
On bookshelves across the country everywhere.
It's the level 02 at 560 WDQA.
So far nothing's been found but by the way they're saying oh look at that Michael Scacol convicted of murder.
It is a worthy verdict then for Michael Scacol.
They had never anticipated this from the very beginning.
His lawyer has maintained his innocence to Michael Scacol who truly said that all along he did not kill Martha Munchley.
This has got to be a shattering blow.
It means that he faces 25 years to life in prison.
Oh right.
Munchley family has always said this was not about vengeance but this was about justice.
They wanted the person who killed their 15 year old, their beloved 15 year old girl brought to justice.
She was brutally beaten to death with a golf club and then stabbed through the neck.
Whether the jury considered that when the jury was intent that may be part of it.
Okay so they finally nailed a Kennedy Michael Scacol convicted of murder.
Here's Dave Johnson has got other things on his mind I'm sure.
How are you doing Dave?
I'm fine how are you Neil?
I'm doing sensational.
It's a beautiful day and to run to the sun is shining.
The appringens are doing it right on my balcony.
It's great.
When are you coming to Belmont Park?
I'll be there in about a half an hour.
As the pigeon flies.
Okay.
So anyway I picked the winner.
I'm sure George passed it along because you know finally sooner or later after all these years I picked you the winner or the appringness.
Yes and you were dead right?
I had the second horse we had the exact it together.
There you go.
War emblem man I see.
I hear people talking about Seattle slew and the fact that both horses are black.
Well that's like saying that Mike Tyson is going to win tomorrow because you know Joe Lewis was black too and it didn't make any sense to me.
I mean more emblem may run a gigantic race and I'm going to pick him any wild tear that right now but he's no Seattle slew.
Well you know you never know how good they are until you get a little distance from them.
I mean even spectacular bid who lost because he had a co-cat riding him as a teenage kid.
Are you picking on Ronnie Franklin again?
Yes I am.
Good. Good.
But I didn't realize how good Seattle I mean the spectacular bid was until like you know Shoemaker started to ride him and then you saw what kind of an animal he was.
He was great.
I think you have to get a little distance between you know the actual event of the Belmont and then see what he does in the Belmont and afterward.
And not only that but you know people forget I think didn't the secretary to only race against four horses in the Belmont.
Probably yeah there was very very small fields I think it was a field of five or six Mike Gallant and Bob Horse and Sham.
Yeah I think we only five or six he's going to have there's going to be eleven in the field tomorrow.
Eleven?
Yeah.
You mean eleven plus more emblem or somebody gets scratched.
Oh posse.
Puzzlement got scratched.
You heard it first right here so posse.
A man who was like 30 to one in the morning line had no chance anyway he's out.
Yeah he brewed a foot so he will not be competing in the Belmont but he's a good horse he'll be later but he won't have a chance in the Belmont he's out of it.
Now he was in a seven hole he was inside of where emblem so that means where emblem moves in one spot everybody in one moment.
So field of eleven there's a couple horses that don't belong in there but there's about four or five horses I wouldn't be surprised to see like perfect drift or proud citizen who was second of the durbian third in the precness.
I mean they have every right to come back but I haven't told you my pick yet.
Okay well you will in a second the horse that I hear everybody talking about is Sunday break.
Bingo!
I love him.
Oh that's when you're picking.
Yeah.
Sunday break with Yuri Stevens the Eldorized Elisorce who won now what race was it that he won?
Well he won a race called a Peter Pan and I went out to the track I wanted to see him in person and he's really grown up he's matured since he raced in March and April in New York and he grew a winter coat.
He really he was affected by the cold weather but he's now mature he's grown he's very very powerful I think he's the horse to be.
Okay so on the other words you're picking the upset and you know me every year for how many years now for 24 years for last hundred years every year.
We've been trying no it's not just a question of the favor we try to get a triple crown winner because I think this sport which is really in a big trouble
desperately needs a triple crown winner needs a champion and unlike harness racing where the times keep getting better and you keep getting champions every year or two.
Thurbert Racing's really had a mediocre bunch for years now.
Neil I think you're right though you know this is a horse that could do it and how long we've been talking 20 years I guess.
Like a hundred years.
Really is the horse that could and I'll be happy if if war emblem wins it this will be good for the game and I like Bob Baffer.
Yeah we like Bob Baffer because he swore on year on ABC a few years ago remember that.
Yes he actually blurted out I don't remember what the word is and of course we don't want to use it here anyway unless we have to but you know he's he's just our kind of guy he's kind of a likable guy.
Yeah and he's been so close to the triple crown twice he just got beat with was it real quiet real quiet and silver charm silver charm got beat well real quiet though just got the nose down then of course they said that he got
to sort of move them too soon in the stretch and all that other baloney and you know who beat him up by a nose don't you know I don't.
Gary Stevens who writes his right and Sunday break tomorrow there you go.
Well Victor Espinoza is going to win on a more emblem tomorrow I think and basically you've got a mediocre field here that's another thing you have to look at not only is the horse really great but.
Who's he racing against I just don't think it's that much of a good field but no you're you're right it's not the quality field that we've seen in other years but there's a there's a ten of them against the war emblem so that makes for a tough tough thing to win this series well I think we need a champion and you know something you made a good point to beginning that is until they really finish the triple crown this our running in the other races later in the fall races you don't really know how good these horses are yeah I mean secretary at you know that was that was an unbelievable performance he was great at age.
Two and terrific at age three but you know Seattle flew really proved himself after the Belmont and you know in the breeding shed he's he's probably the best.
Sire that we've had now war emblem doesn't have to have the lead because they keep saying that wise men's fairies going to go out and set a you know a pretty good pace.
He can sit close to the pace just like he didn't the pretense he doesn't have to be on lead I'm thinking of Seattle slow I'm trying to remember if he ever ran from off the
pace or do you always run on the lead he ran close he ran on the leader or close to it all the time you know I don't remember Seattle
flew Belmont very I I saw it but I didn't call it but I remember Seattle flew his first race as a two year old he went off it
about five or six to one and he was covered up I mean nobody nobody knew about him except the stable and after he won his first race
he just destroyed a field of two year olds at Belmont Park and we all looked at ourselves in a press box and said what have we just seen
he turned out to be the only undefeated triple crown winner we've ever had one of the things I remember about Seattle slow is the John Kruege who had plenty of critics back at that time in fact it was the Belmont that's I don't remember the actual race itself either but I do remember they said he'll win the triple crown unless the Frenchman falls off
meaning John Kruege the jockey and if I'm sure you'll recall as they approach the wire he saluted the crowd he kind of stood up in the assail and he saluted the crowd and everybody kind of held their breath like oh jeez you haven't reached the line yet John don't fall off
he he had a lot of critics he did the ride this horse over the wind the triple crown so John's in the in the record book but soon after the triple crown on Hill Cordero got the right that's right yeah but you know I picked the proud citizen in the boat the Derby in the preekness I finished second I finished third I'm getting off of them you know
what happens then don't you yeah you ain't Lucas beware beware when you least expected okay you're picking Sunday break I'm picking more emblem so there's the exact
for the audience Neil that say it I'm gonna bet it okay okay no more than 500 okay okay Dave say hi I'm gonna be pissed for us maybe you'll find Larry down there by the finish line he might be hanging around okay they take care I'll thank I hate Goldberg a lot of money no problem he's got it trust me he's got the in fact you'll see the mop balls flat of his wallet take care of yourself you two they take care
okay there's Dave Johnson call or the triple crown for last 600 years war emblem triple crown it's when I'm picking and not not enthusiastically what is the George pick pick war emblem I was gonna pick Sunday break as I heard Hank touting on the morning show in other words you're gonna pick what Hank is picking while he knows they've already picked that I'm gonna pick up proud citizens and see abandoned him proud citizen okay there you go the Lucas source for George
12 minutes past 11 at 560 wqa m so Michael scakle found guilty I'm gonna be serving 25 years to rifle all right why should I be so enthusiastic about and you want to know why because we've seen so many other people in a family get away with so much crap right even though I love Ted Kennedy as a senator but of course you know he just has a little problem over the years and not to mention of course William Kennedy Smith not to mention because it feels good when justice happens that's why you're hip yeah

and thus far they haven't resulted in any human remains being found said penal komisko
police commander John Minor.
The alleged victims in the unrelated child molestation charges that Kieselmau faces range
in age from 9 to 13 years old.
Authorities are also investigating allegations that Kieselmau had abused ten other children
in the 70s.
Kieselmau was defracked in 1978 after he was charged with tying up two boys and molesting
them.
It was also arrested on molest charges in 1981 in Newton City, California.
The parish where Kieselmau served in the 1970s is no longer in existence.
Another priest who was also with Santa Paula Parish Reverend Robert Fritas was arrested
in April on a charge of sexually abusing a 15-year-old boy in 1979 when he was associate
pastor.
Frides was arrested after meeting with his alleged victim who wore a hidden device that
recorded what police described as a conversion.
The alleged victim now 38 years old said he decided to come forward when he moved back to
his hometown and so that Frides was still an active priest.
Local Catholic church officials say they called police as soon as they were made aware of
the allegation.

weekend or what I was in transit.
How come I never had a chance?

Obsessed.
Harvard speech gets polite reception.
A Harvard University commencement.
Then you were approaching where the story the kid that we want to do the thing called
jihad and explain what jihad meant.

A Harvard University commitment speech that offended some students with the use of the
term jihad received a polite reception yesterday with some students standing to applaud.
Zayed yes in an American Muslim selected as a student speaker for the ceremony and by
the way not a very bad looking kid.
Head titled a speech of faith and citizenship my American jihad but dropped a second phrase
after some students said the speech should explicitly condemn terrorist violence the
content of the speech was not changed.
In Arabic jihad means struggle but of course as we know all too well it's also a term
for holy war.
The speech focused on a struggle for personal growth and for wider peace and justice.
It condemned Muslims and non-Muslims who abused the word during a rainy 350 first-harvard
commencement in Harvard yard.
Havard Yard.
A couple of protesters could be seen but dozens of people in the audience gave yes in a
standing ovation no relation to the hockey player by the way Alexia action.
Let's hear it for him.
When on a rider ordered to stand trial finally.
I mean this is just gotta be like a comedy act that's going on.
This thing with her elbow those supposedly the one she broke last year too even though
she got hit on the wrong side.
Oh.
Vinny the guy called in yesterday tells the name of that mob guy Vinny the cheek the chin the chin
well I was close.
Vinny the chin they used to wander around in a Brooklyn I think it was in his bathroom
late at night like like like that.
Like it was kind of like Greg Reed.
And then they finally got on to him.
A judge ordered actress Vanoa rider yesterday to stand trial on three counts of shoplifting
vandalism and drug charges and a rainman is set for today of course it's only a 22
in the morning out there so when it happened yet by the way Michael Schakele was found
together you murder in case you just do in the late.
Michael Schakele of the Kennedy clan.
Anyway they much late preliminary hearing finally got underway and earnest earlier in
the day yesterday right away wearing a black dress had her right arm in a sling.
The result of an elbow fracture she received Monday in a fracas outside the courthouse.
There's nothing worse than a fracas outside the courthouse.
In the incident rider was clipped by a camera as reporters and camera crews jostled trying
to take pictures of her and she came back into the courthouse during a recess.
Monday's post phone was the fourth post phone for the hearing Thursday's proceedings were
halted for a few minutes after the actress complained of pain in her arm.
God.
Rider was arrested last December 12 outside sex to Thabanoon Beverly Hills.
The Oscar nominated actress faces one county to grant that commercial burglary vandalism
and possession of a controlled substance oxy codon of pain killer.
Police say she shopped with the numerous women's hair accessories handbags and various
items of women's clothing.
Rider has pleaded not guilty to all four counts.
Her eternity obnoxiously disgusting the moustache of the TV horror Mark Garagos produced
the sales receipt from almost four grand that the implies proves Rider actually paid for
the allegedly stolen merchandise.
A sex security official Kenneth Evans testified the receipt was just for one pair of Gucci
shoes that Rider purchased not for the items that she's accused of stealing.
Four grand for a pair of shoes.
How do you like that?
Then they make you want a bar?
Huh?
Four grand for a pair of shoes.
Jesus Christ.
A considerable amount of testimony from Evans was about the video surveillance techniques
he used to monitor the actress she moved around the store.
What was that?
What was what?
That noise.
That wasn't you?
No.
I don't know.
That wumping sound.
Maybe it was an act of Jesus Christ.
Oh, you know what it was?
What?
Wait.
It's on at the disc.
Oh.
Which makes it kind of fun.
You can listen for it now.
Evans also testified that a staff requirement recovered several security tags from addressing
room used by Rider.
He said the tags appeared to have been cut off from the merchandise rather than removed
by equipment that the store uses when a sale is made.
You know how they have those things?
Yes they do.
What do you call those things?
The tag takeer offer?
Electric.
Yeah, the electric tag takeer offer remover.
So they get those security things off the merchandise.
So they got some pretty good idea that maybe somebody paid for it.
Evans said at one point that when he first saw Rider on the video surveillance cameras,
he thought she was a homeless person because she was carrying so many shopping bags.
That prompted Gerrgos to ask how many homeless people sacks gets wearing three quarter-life
cashmere coats.
In that neighborhood?
I love it.
I've got to like it.
Real sense of humor she's got.
And the on-war work you see it.
This also happened yesterday.
She got like a little slap on her wrist.
Yeah.
And don't do it again.
Very, very sad.
Of course, if you get caught with a pinjoy and I guarantee you 20 years, no questions
asked.
They'll just throw the key away.
Make no mistake about it, especially George.
In fact, I can think of some good character witnesses for you right now.
Stupid.

Love it 34-560 WDQ.
When you look at our poll result, 322 votes.
And you add up the people that smoke.
That's just pot.
That's like 56, which is 17.3%.
But the ones that smoke cigarette and pot.
Yeah.
And cigar and cigar and pots inside of the cigarette.
Oh, you got 35%.
35%.
Our puffin' on the wacky illegal weed in the USA.
And our probably gonna go to jail if anybody finds out.
And they trace these guy damn votes.
I thought it was gonna be cigarettes on this thing.
What do you mean by that?
More people smoking cigarettes than anything else.
Only 4%, only 13.
Although cigarettes and pot is 35.
So you got about 25%.
But 35% are smoking pot either all by its loansome or with an occasional stokey throwing in there or occasional a faggot.
And a cigarette too.
Pretty amazing.
And yet not only is the country resisting coming out of the stone age with its pot laws, but also is muscling our friends up here in Canada who are on the verge or right on the edge of decriminalizing completely.
Just like they're doing in all of Western Europe pretty much in the civilized countries where they don't want to put all our people in jail.
And they're threatening the Canadian government where they're saying, oh boy, don't do that.
Because then they'll be shipping all that wacky weed down here across the border and smuggling it and that it will fall.
And people be jumping right over to God damn falls.
God, this makes you want to cry.
This makes you want to cry.
Here's a great article.
Thank you for factoring this to me by the way.
One of our factions out there in the audience.
Paul Krugman writes in today's New York Times, evils of access.
This also makes you want to cry.
See, I don't read these articles to depress anybody like the thing from Newsweek just so that you know.
You know, I mean, then you can go on with your life and not let it overwhelm you or you can just go commit suicide.
One or the other.
But just so that we have some idea of what's going on.
It's not a pretty picture.
Paul Krugman writes as Senate and investigators examine evidence on the administration's in-run contracts.
The White House Council, Alberto Gonzalez, has already delivered the verdict.
Everything's fine because officials did nothing to help Enron as it was a collapsing.
Oh, we're fine.
I believe him.
I also believe that the administration played no role in the death of Elvis and equally relevant assertion.
Mr. Gonzalez is pulling the same trick on energy policy that Dick Cheney has pulled on anti-terrorist policy
respond to real serious questions about the administration's actions by self-righteously denying charges that nobody's actually making.
Nobody has accused the White House of helping Enron when it was down, just as no Democratic leader has accused the administration of deliberately allowing 9-11 to happen.
The real questions in both cases are whether the administration failed to wipe against real threats because it was preoccupied with a preconceived agenda.
Why officials who manifestly got a wrong have not been held accountable and whether because nobody's been held accountable, the administration is continuing to make the same mistakes.
I know that I'm about to get a barrage of mail saying that energy policy and terrorism are not comparable, but bear with me for a minute.
In the case of energy policy, the administration still won't release information about Dick Cheney's energy task force.
But it's clear that energy companies and only energy companies had access to top officials the result with that during the California power crisis, which it is increasingly apparent was largely engineered by Enron and other companies that had the administration's ear, the administration did nothing.
But just as John Ascroft, the brush decided appeals to make terrorism in priority, remains in charge of our effort against terrorism, Mr. Cheney who ridiculed conservation and price controls, which in the end were what saved California, remains in charge of energy policy, and that scares me more than terrorism.
Earlier this week, the EPA released a report confirming what the vast majority of climatologists and every other advanced country government had already concluded human activity is causing global warming and the consequences will be nasty, but the EPA did not propose any preventative action instead of talked only about adapting to the changes.
Old hands we call the days of James Watt, the interior secretary back in the 80s, when scientists discovered that industrial chemicals were depleting Earth's protective ozone layer, Mr. Watt suggested that people were hats, sun-screen and dark glasses.
Luckily for the plan, he was overruled, the U.S. joined other countries in curbing production of ozone depleting chemicals, the ozone hole is still growing but disasters at least been postponed.
No such happy outcome seems likely on global warming. After a curious pause, George W. Bush rejected his own administration's analysis. I read the report put out by the bureaucrats he sneered.
Clearly this was a replay of what happened early last year when the EPA's Christie Whitman assured the public that Mr. Bush would honor his pledge to control carbon dioxide emissions only to be betrayed when the cool and oil industries waited on this subject.
So the administration learned nothing from the California crisis, it still takes its advice from the energy companies that financed its campaigns and made many administration officials including Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney Rich.
And it's one thing to reward your friends with subsidies and tax regulation, it's something quite different to let them dictate policy on climate change.
Many people believe that the Bush administration had a special window of opportunity on global warming policies, politically it could have been a nixon ghost to China moment.
Mr. Bush could have passed legislation that would have been totally out of reach for a Democrat.
Furthermore, many corporations were actually eager for guidelines that would allow them to make long-term plans.
But because the administration continues to listen only to the usual suspects that window of opportunity is closing fast and bear this in mind, whatever he imagines, though some of been lawden can't destroy Western civilization, carbon dioxide can.
Right Paul Krugman in the days of New York Times and he is...
Oh absolutely correct.
So like I said, don't get depressed about it, just get pissed off, you know?
Yeah.
And huh?
Well look at the bright side.
Pissed off gets me fired up when I hear someone say that.
I beg your pardon?
I said look on the bright side.
Michael Skakel got convicted.
Yeah, let's hear Michael Skakel got convicted.
Oh!
Conducted. Oh there's his mother.
The first thing I did was say a prayer.
Well it didn't work too good honey.
20 till noon at 560 WQM.

So anyway that was Dorothy Marksley.
It's Martha Marksley's mother.
Wanted to sit you prayed.
Yeah.
But I didn't why didn't let her finish it because I didn't have time.
She said she prayed for like this to happen.
Otherwise for scapegoat convicted and he got convicted.
So there you go.
And also they got John on who is Martha Marksley's brother.
And they're pretty, you know, pretty upbeat now.
I mean as upbeat as they can be out of the circumstances because Martha's still dead, you know.
Yeah.
See it's an old story.
The audience can't get all that excited about even though it's a Kennedy.
And not only that, it's not like one of the he's like a distant relative.
What is he's like Ethel's nephew?
Second cousin twice removed.
Yeah.
Kissing cousin something like that.
But once in a while you got to get somebody convicted that the public doesn't like.
And an addition which he's such a frumpy nasty chubby, pouchy, punchy looking guy, you know.
I mean if he was a good looking young guy, we want to see him get convicted, would we?
No.
Even the, you know, that's right.
Even a head of a sexual guy is out.
Oh and speaking of that, a gay league of their own writes the globe.
Baseball rocked by switch hitting scandal and you're never going to guess.
I'll give you a clue who's quoted at length in this article.
I'll give you a clue.
I like that one.
Really?
Yeah.
The crow.
Major league baseball is about to be rocked by a gigantic gay scandal triggered by the explosive revelation.
At least half a dozen current players are homosexuals.
Half a dozen right.
While millions of fans would be shocked to learn the true sexual preference of their favorite diamond stars,
the existence of homosexual players is well known inside the gay world.
Inside the gay world.
What do you know that was coming in here?
I couldn't resist.
I know of it.
At least six major league ball players who are gays is a leading commentator on homosexual culture.
Fans as well as their teammates would be stunned because these guys are good looking macho type athletes to play on a west coast and two more play in New York and believe me.
They're not alone.
These are gay.
There are gay men hiding all over baseball, but they're just too afraid to come out.
And while the vast majority of the 750 major league players are straight.
So it says here at least a couple of them experts believe a gay scandal could devastate the mega billion dollar business baseball dream more than 75 million dollars playing.
I'm sorry.
More than 75 million paying fans to the big league parks last year with 39 million homes tuning into watch the Arizona diamond backsups at the Yankees and game seven of the world serious last year.
Thank God.
All this talk is given the phrase boys of summer a new meaning says a baseball insider.
Let's face it.
A lot of parents would stop taking their children off the ballgame.
If they knew someone to play as on the field were gay, it would be absolutely devastating the image of the game.
Do you believe that?
That parents would stop taking their kids to the game.
If they knew someone to play as well.
Hey, can we do that?
If you were to cut that during the Joe and George, Joe and George show whatever it was and a lot of people said yes and a lot of people couldn't believe it.
Said yes, what that parents would stop taking their kids and people would stop going if they found out that their favorite ball player.
That's a pile of crap.
See that that's the whole point.
That's the whole point of why these people need to come out or be dragged out or something is because then people stop assuming that just because it isn't some limberant or lumpristed fact like Jim J Bullock that he isn't, you know, they just don't want to they don't want to get it.
I can see why leading man kind of actor would be afraid to come out.
You mean like Tom Cruise because the ruin is image in the movies that's right because it's all images about being a great womanizer right difference doesn't make it they still run as fast they still hit.
Yeah, but they're taking showers naked with the other guys not to mention and I guarantee they wouldn't get as nearly as many pets on the passes they've been getting lately.
The first explosive hit of the coming scandal blew when New York Post column this deal Travis reported that a star player was about to come out of the closet.
One met star who spends a lot of time with pretty models and clubs is actually gay and it started to think about declaring his sexual orientation Travis wrote.
His column kicked off a slew of rumors about the identity of the player forced of the met's biggest star Mike Piazza to swiftly deny he was the guy.
Piazza called a press conference to distinguish smoldering gay rumors.
I'm not gay to clear his piazza. I'm heterosexual. You buying it? No believe it. No.
I can't I can say I'm heterosexual. I date women. I don't see a need to address it any further said Piazza.
Piazza isn't the only player to face the gay issue.
Hunky New York Yankee's short stop Derek Jeter. Hunky looks like he came from outer space. Does Miguel agree Derek Jeter looks like he's from outer space.
Out of this world. You know he's a strange looking guy. He's bizarre anyway.
Hunky New York Yankee's short stop Derek Jeter who once dressed as a woman for a Saturday Night Live gig.
Also has been the target of false gay rumors during his spectacular eight year career. He also think he put in the word false in there just to cover the rest.
Yes. Despite being romantically linked to famous beauties like singers. Wait till you hear this. You're going to fall on your ass.
Raya Kerry. Enjoy and wreak as well as Miss Universe Laura Dutta. Raya Kerry.
Also was hot and heavy with Luis Miguel. Yeah. Piazza's teammate Roberto Alamar once engaged to blonde tennis star Mary Pierce.
Also was hit with false gay rumors after he made national news by spitting an empire John Hershback.
One report strongly denied by baseball officials said the second basement became enraged after Hershback called him a derogatory name for homosexuals.
And of course I think most of us were worth the time. That had to be what he said when he like.
Spitting her specs face and everybody became someone diggin. Just because her spec probably said get out of here you faggot.
Oh yeah, I'm almost positive. That's what he said or maybe it was like that damn back at I can't stand it. Yeah, something like that.
And of course when he said it in that tone of voice.
False gay and you windows also singled out Brady Anderson who once slug 50 home runs in a season for the Orioles.
There are so many rumors about him since former majorly young pirate Dave Polone who came out of the closet after renting his 18 year career of calling balls and strikes.
But an Orioles spokesperson insisted Anderson is strictly a ladies man. Right. A spokesman. What do they expect these people to say?
Can you imagine call up the Oriole publicity office the public relations office and say, hey is Brady Anderson a fact? Oh yeah, he takes it up the spectrum.
Meanwhile, New York met manager Bobby Valentine recently sparked a firestorm controversy when he said baseball was probably ready for an openly gay player.
And Valentine's boss met general manager Steve Phillips poured fuel on the fire when he added there probably is somebody in every clubhouse who's gay.
Warren Crowe Marty. All right, this is the national exposure for the Crow. This is the best news I've heard in a hell of a long time.
How about you and me, but trauma the need the globe. That's the guy. Okay.
Warren Crowe Marty, a radio talk show host in Florida boy, that's really stretching the term and former player with a Montreal expose in Kansas City.
Roles tells the globe that many top players have been dog by gay rumors over the years. I've heard the rumors about Jeter, Piazza, Alamar and Anderson.
He says, but I've seen those guys out with hot models too. Even back when I was playing ball, the rumors about certain players.
They included all stars and guys who were hanging out at the end of the bench. So far only two major ligers have stepped up to the plate and declared their homosexuality, but they did it of course after retiring at the big old red blowers and now center field or Billy Bean kept it a secret till a six year career with the Tigers Los Angeles Dodgers and send ego podres ended.
Bean now tells the globe that their current gay major ligers are choosing to keep their sexual identities ahead.

Our faith has been tested today, immeasurably.

A Richard Reed was traveling with three accomplices when he allegedly tried to blow up the airplane.
Were you aware of that? Have you ever heard this before?
No, not.
Well, there you go.
The crew members also spent the last part of the flight afraid the explosives packed footwear could destroy the plane before was able to land.
The information comes from three pilots into flight attendants talking on a training tape distributed by the Allied Piles Association, the Collective Bargony Gage in for American Airlines pilots.
They do not give their names.
I heard a scream from the number three flight attendants said one.
Flight 63 was about 30,000 feet over the Atlantic Ocean December 22 on route from Paris to Miami.
When witnesses say Reed act began acting strangely.
Reed was assigned an aisle seat near the middle of the aircraft but he moved to an empty window seat after takeoff.
The new seat was closer to the plane's exterior where the bomb could have caused greater damage.
He tried to light something on fire. We didn't really know what it was said one person on the tape.
The flight attendant had told him to put it out and he put it in his mouth another said.
Reed was overpowered by passengers and crew members but not without a struggle.
The number three flight attendant ran by me saying he bit me. He bit me someone on the APA tape said.
After Reed was subdued the flight crew became worried that he was acting alone.
The pilot ran a trace on the seat where the crew thought Reed was sitting.
The trace indicated he was traveling as part of a family of four.
The scenario now is that there are three other people traveling with this man a crew member recalled.
But this flight pleased from the flight attendants that pilots couldn't find a place to land immediately.
Unfortunately, we're two hours away from anything close by over two hours said the pilot.
American Airlines headquarters later determined that Reed was traveling alone.
While Reed was sedated by a doctor on board the plane the plane was never to debaust and escorted by two F-15s.
But the crew still feared the explosives inside Reed's shoes.
I told him up to the front and one of the dumbest things I ever did was call a cockpit and say,
I'm coming in with something I remember the pilot.
On the way in I realized that I smelled the cord, I see the burn and I say, oh my gosh this is what he was trying to light.
This is not a shoe, it's a bomb.
The device was then taken to the back of the plane wrapped in blankets and pillows to help absorb a potential explosion.
We made sure that nobody came near it said a flight attendant.
Of course every time the airplane made a little jolt it was a little disturbing to say at the least.
I do like that, huh?
Chilling.
Chilling.

This is Howard David. When I take my Fel Dean, I listen to the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour.
Not George, cos he's stupid.
People are all you're asking us where we got the name, T'Pau.
In this rare interview, T'Pau leads Singer Carol Decker makes the rash assumption that we give a flying f*** about her in her stupid band.
Well, T'Pau was a character on Star Trek. She was a vulcan high priestess.
Interesting enough, confessing that she named her band after a Star Trek character,
Brad Pitt Carol Decker is such a hopeless geek that it prevented her from getting laid during your entire tenure as a famous person.
It's ironic, you know, because as you probably know, Vulcan has to mate with every seven years or they like explode.
Why no, Carol, you annoying strange person, we didn't know that. But let me ask you this.
If the band T'Pau doesn't have a head every seven years, do they explode too?
Well, I don't know. I mean, like, what are you getting at? I mean, will he had that one hit and it's been well over a f***!
Ladies and gentlemen, a little glimpse of what the world would be like if TV show announcers had all the power.
It's a big, juicy, shopping-wet-like-a-cho business tonight on Inside the Blind.
Well, this is some heavy duty stuff he just facts me, you know, about the S-quire article?
Yeah, I'm going to have to go out and buy S-quire now.
Oh, and where did this thing come from from the promise keepers?
We went to their website, compelled by the ad, and Miguel found that.
Hey, Adam, you're an asshole, baby!
And goes to show you that the hidden asshole is the most dangerous one.
He's a good guy, he's not like the other guys, he's not spastic like most of our other salespeople, and then he comes up with a piece of crap.
Seven promises from the promise keepers.
Number one, promise keepers committed to wandering Jesus Christ through worship prayer and obedience to God's word in the power of the Holy Spirit.
And it goes on.
It goes on the line.
I don't want to waste my time with it.
Oh, speaking of that, judge Amish Sekt must use triangles.
Evansburg, Pennsylvania.
A judge has ruled that an ultra conservative Amish congregation must use orange and red reflective triangles on their buggies despite arguments by the group that Goddy decorations violate their beliefs.
It's not a decoration, asshole.
Good laudity, it's too Goddy.
Twenty members of the Swarz and Truber Amish Sekt who live about 65 miles from Pittsburgh were hit yesterday with 27 fines of 95 dollars each for failing to use the slow moving vehicle symbolize.
Donna Dobleck, the Pittsburgh Attorney representing the Amish for the ACLU, sential appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the fines were suspended until the appeal is heard.
Instead of the triangles, the Swarz and Truber prefer to use a gray reflective tape and a lantern on the rear of their buggies, gray or white reflective tape is legal in nine states for use on slow moving vehicles, including Ohio where the Sekt lived until two years ago.
Where disappointed it's hard to understand how in nine states they can make the requested accommodation for the Amish, but in Pennsylvania, the cradle of religious liberty, they can't respect the Amish's beliefs said, Wic, evict, walk as, Zack, whatever his name is, executive director of the Pittsburgh branch of the ACLU.
Cambria County Judge Timothy Cranie rule that Pennsylvania can abridged these Swarz and Truber's religious beliefs because it is a compelling interest, namely keeping the Amish and other vehicles safe on public roads.
Cranie relied on testimony given last month by state transportation experts who said the triangles are more visible and taped during the day when statistics show about 61% of all vehicle buggy accidents occur.
God, you sure want to be no buggy accident, do you? No, it sounds buggy.
No, but said those statistics don't prove anything over because they don't show out the accidents occurred or who was it fault.
There's no evidence that any of those crashes could have been prevented by bathing the vehicle in color, she said.
Oh, that sounds like a fun thing, though. Let's bathe our vehicle in color.
What color? This thing that you just fact me, I sure hope this is pretty interesting. This stuff from Esquire Magazine.
It says in an amazingly candid and startling piece in the current Esquire, the Pulitzer Prize winning writer Ron Suskind is torn away the curtain at the Bush White House and shown just how phony and scary the Bush regime actually is.
Washington political observers caught off guard by Suskind's ability to get it to the truth or a gog at the article, which some have compared to David Stockman's revelations 20 years ago about how Reaganomics was a fraud.
The New York Times has even seen fit to print a partial summary of Suskind's article, though with some of the more disturbing details.
Suskind's article started out as a profile of Karen Hughes in the middle of Suskind's reporting of the story, Karen announced a resignation which might have been a bad setback for Suskind.
But the resourceful Suskind went on to report the real react in the White House to Karen's departure and in the process pierced the shroud of secrecy that protects the Bush White House from being seen for what it really is.
It was a bitterly driven PR operation propping up a mindless boy king.
Remember Sky King? Nope. Now we got Boy King. A few of the revelations in the article, Bush Chief of Staff Andy Cardtel's Esquire that with Karen Hughes departure the whole balance of the White House, which he had been desperately maintaining between Carl Rhofen Karen is now upset, everything that had worked is now gone.
With Karen and Texas Carl and the wing nuts are now virtually in charge of the executive branch. Bush media advisor Mark McKinnon reveals that Karen Hughes actually makes or until she departed made one out of every five presidential decisions.
Bush Communications Director Dan Bartlett said that Karen Hughes literally manufactures George W. Bush. Don't believe us. Well then here are some direct quotes.
Andrew Cardtel. The key balance around here has been between Karen and Carl Rhofe. That's what I've been doing from the start of this administration standing on the middle of the sea saw with Karen on one side, Carl on the other trying to keep it in balance. One of them just jumped off.
I'll need design ease. People trusted by the present that I can elevate for various needs to balance against Carl. Cardtel then takes off a few names like Tucker Esquieu, Dan Bartlett, Mary Madeline, Arie Fleischer, speech writer Michael Gerson.
They're going to have to really step it up and it won't be easy. Carl is a formidable adversary. Mark McKinnon is quoted as saying President Bush offenses the most striking difference between being governor and president is the volume of decision making.
There are a hundred decisions he has to make every day big decisions with lot writing on each one. So he'll give 20 of them to Karen to make. He trusts her completely. He trusts her here like he trusts no one.
Dan Bartlett, she, Hughes, can literally manufacture him. Bush, the only one who can do it. She knows how he talks, but also knows how he thinks. It's like they're one person. Over time, people have better understood that if you have an idea, proposal Karen better like it or not or you won't have any chance of any event.
It goes on. So you better buy the new S. Quarge, July issue S. Quar magazine and read all about it. Remember that little newsboys say read all about it. You don't remember that do you on the underdog, Cartel?
Just like that little Johnny, they used to say call for Philip Morris speaking of cigarettes before your time.
Hey, the good news is for you poor people losing your ass in the market. The good news is very quietly here. It's making a little bit of a comeback. That good.
I'm ecstatic. The guy that was down well over a hundred points is now only down 58 and then as that that was down like over 50 points is now only down 29.
Chris is a long way to go. I just mentioned that in passing. Tricy won't commit suicide. Look at that. There's Mark Furman. Bring up the crime. They created virtually all the evidence. What didn't come from Michael's mouth was created by his family sending him to a lawn.
He was on hiring the Sutton Associate. Very lame attempt to cover up a murder. Which in fact what it did is gave us the evidence and it gave us.
That's right. He wrote that book murder and Greenwich about the Eskakel case. Did you know that? I didn't. And that inspired me. I think I'm going to want to buy that today.
Mark Furman coming to fight out that Furman's not a bad guy after all. You know what? That was just stick. No, I mean just because he said nigger. I mean you say nigger.
Nigger please. And black people say nigger. Everybody says nigger. And the idea that they made so and of course that comes from this.
Pricy phony goody two shoes facade that the American public is in this childish aura under which we have to live.
Do one thing in private then pretend in public. You're a whole different person. Oh nobody says that. The n word.
Celebrity spills out. China says Joey Butterfuko was a fat piece of garbage and a chicken too. How do you like that? Oh I see I'm not only reading part of it. I knew it didn't make too much sense there.
Oh celebrity slugfest spills off out of a TV ring. Well it's same thing. Former pro wrestling sex pod China. You know China. Yes.
God are about kicked by infamous teen seducer Joey Butterfuko in a celebrity boxing match and now she's beating up and him outside the ring. He's nothing but a fat piece of garbage China who now goes by her real name Joni lore blasted to a friend.
If he's man enough to face me in a wrestling ring I'll drop him so fast his big head won't stop spinning.
The China Butterfuko slugfest was the featured bout on Foxnet where celebrity boxing too special. China 30 was a late replacement stepping in after Butterfuko's scheduled opponent.
John Wayne Bobbott was arrested for allegedly beating his new wife. Well you know you'd be in a bad mood all the time too if somebody cut off your shalong.
The 51145 pound Butterfuko fighting as the gladiator easily handled better condition but smaller China. He gained notoriety in 1992 when his jealous 17 year old lover Long Island Lila Amy Fisher shot his wife Mary Jo in the hain.
At least he did his own fighting this time China said he was supported a block eye after the match but that's the last time I'll let that piece of road kill push me around.
He didn't fight fairly when we boxed and he wouldn't be able to defend himself at all if we ever had to wrestle.
How do you like that good stuff baby excellent stuff can't wait for that rematch. In fact we got George is going to be wrestling somebody on celebrity wrestling I can't mention the name.
I think that would get a 90 share in South Florida anyway probably get a 99 share 379 votes on our survey and I'll say it again.

Michael's staple found guilty of the murder of Martha Moxley.
Because that's an old story.
About 90 years ago that happened.
What about freaking time?
Yeah, better late than ever.
That's what we say.
Let's hear it.
Oh, this is a great thing.
You just fact me from CNN.
It is great.
ABC says it ended the word Jesus out of a recent broadcast.
So viewers wouldn't be offended for many.
It had the opposite effect.
Jesus Christ.
The bleep Jesus on the view has drawn the eye of the Reverend Jerry Falwell.
Some conservative media watchdogs and even the women whose on air conversation was altered.
It's a political correctness run on Moxley, Elizabeth Swaisy, spokeswoman for the Media Research Center.
On the May 23 edition of the view, which is a horrible show by the way.
Miradath Vierre noticed that the daily weigh-ins of her dieting, co-host, joy, behar had ended.
Yes, and thank you.
Thank you.
Jesus is all I have to say, behar reply.
Now the fact that it just makes you want to lay down on the floor and give up.
The fact that there's even such a thing.
She said, yes, and thank you.
Thank you.
Jesus is all I have to say, behar reply.
Look, that's a big deal.
Her words were air live in much of the country.
But when ABC broadcasted tapers to the show on the West Coast, the word Jesus was edited out.
Jesus Christ.
ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoversage.
ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoversage.
The use ran a follow-up pretty clear standard.
The network has no problem with Jesus' name if it's used in a prayerful and respectful manner.
She said, ABC's Peter Jennings anchored a highly-weighted news special, a ridiculous piece of fiction, called the search for Jesus in July of 2000.
But ABC does not allow Jesus' name to be used in an exclamation like Jesus Christ.
Under the circumstances, we were concerned it would be offensive to our audience who were sent.
The incident comes at a time broadcast news in general, are pushing the boundaries of language and content.
Explosives rarely add out on the networks we're using this year, for instance, on an AER episode on NBC and on CBS Mart Special using video from inside the World Trade Center.
ABC's broadcast of a race of Victoria Secret Fashion Special, remember prompted complaints of the FCC which ruled that it did not violate indecency regulations.
So they have no problem with showing like almost teets and ass, that's okay, but Jesus, they got a problem with it.
I think everybody ought to call up ABC and say, you got a problem with Jesus?
Five days after they'd be heart-incident, hosted the few notes, they'd received about 100 letters of complaint.
It was stupid to beat that.
Co-hosts, Dar Joan, said they let us say all kinds of things on TV, but they beat out Jesus, that makes no sense to me at all.
Jesus Christ, follow all the newspaper comms that he believed ABC's action was wrong.
What makes it worse, he said, is that many keyboard TV networks are habitually blasphemous. God damn it.
Conservative Catholics and Evangelical Christians are expected to accept this double standard and keep our mouth shut, he said.
He ought to keep his damn mouth shut, maybe he might lose an answer to, peace of crap, peace of walking, turd.
Audio sports fans out there and other lifeless holes and people just want to take a peek at Darian and see if she's really as ridiculous and useless as we say, and she isn't does.
Anybody know what she does at this place?
No. Nothing. Besides, he has Miguel around up and down the hallway and then running him around.
See, that's the deal. If you'd like finally put out first, you'd stop chasing him all over all around town, putting you a sitting out on errands.
Hey sports fans, join Jim Mad Dog, manage live broadcast at Hooters today in Pemberton Pines. That's not the one she's going to be at.
Is it the one? No. Yes. Yes.
Well, that's right, because that's the one Miguel is not going to be at. See, now we know where he's not going there, because Doreen's going to be there.
Pines in University, one to three, that's where the Mad Dog is doing the show.
Q and prize patrol will be there along with Doreen. All kinds of crappy giveaway stuff that we couldn't give away at any, even the homeless people wouldn't take it.
And you can register when dinner for two with a Florida Marlins after you look at him or are. And then, then the peace on the resistance.
Look for the Q and van from five to seven at the Davey ale house on the southeast corner of five ninety five in university drive.
Stop by for prizes and specials on my hard lemonade. It is really hard. That's five to seven with Miguel at the Davey House this afternoon.
Trust me, Doreen will not be there. And if she is going to be there, Miguel will leave.
Can we count on that?
Well, that's right. I'm sorry. You got to keep your mouth shut.
Yeah, it would be really stupid if he said anything about that. That would just not be a good move.
Anyway, can I get back to my show now? I feel like I've been diverted from my opponent rounds, but that was a pretty interesting thing.
You're about Jesus. Yeah. Apollo crap. That was from the. Thank you very much.
Backstreet boy testifies on Capitol Hill.
Did you see about this? Nope. And this asshole man, the one at the senator George void of it. Republican over how my boy cut it.
He's sick and tired of all these celebrities coming forward and testifying. Kevin Richardson of the backstreet boy shared his concerns about a coal mining practice with the Senate panel yesterday.
And one lawmaker said she would accept the singers offer of an aerial tour to see the environmental effect.
When I moved back home to Kentucky to raise a family on my farm, I want my kids to be able to fish and swim in the same place I grew up said Richardson who has an environmental group called just within reach.
Oh, did you mention about Nick Carter's going out on his own? By the way, got an album coming out. I didn't mention it while he is. And he will.
That's what means leaving the group, but he's also doing his own stuff. Is that okay with me? Yeah.
He testified. This is not Nick did not testify somehow. I can't envision that Kevin Richardson testified about mountain top mining a practice in which the top of a bridge or mountain is sheared off to expose a coal scene.
Dirt and rock waste is then pushed into nearby valleys and waterways. Critics say the Bush administration is undercutting environmental laws with a rule encouraging such mining.
I'm not a scientist, but I know what I've seen in flights over coal fields, Richardson, until they sent an environment and public works of committee invited members to join them on a flight to see the areas themselves and senator Hillary Clinton, democratic New York said she'd accept his offer.
I guarantee she's got his hand on his storage void of it, who's a real asshole Republican of Ohio. What kind of the hearing to protest the recent parade of celebrities to Capitol Hill, which is included Julia Roberts and Christy Brinkley.
It's unfortunate that he's not here. I could have taught him something which is instead of point of it. The senator of course did not immediately immediately return any messages.
And you want to know why he didn't meet your name messages need to why we spawn. He's an asshole. That's why it's a schmuck senator George Voynovich.

Pickleburn in New Orleans defense.
ran from April 2001 through September.
Investigators said the House was the center of a nationwide prostitution ring without
post in nine cities which meant the Operation Cross-State lines and thereby constitute
a federal case.
Now I'd like to interject this if I can when we had a prostitution ring in Dade County
well documented run by police, where underage girls, at least in this one there's no minors
involved, but a one in Dade County involved only underage girls, minors.
We're being used as prostitutes and law enforcement people from all and from every agency
in Dade County were the customers of this ring.
We didn't bring in the FBI, what we did was we swept out of the carpet and nobody wanted
to talk about it except yours truly and we still never got any information.
And they gave a couple of cops a slap on a wrist and that was the end of that.
I just mentioned that in passing.
Investigators said the House was the center of a nationwide prostitution ring without
post in nine cities which meant the Operation Cross-State lines and thereby constitute
a federal case.
I don't say don't make a federal case out of it.
We're not only talking about high-priced call girls, we're talking about a House of
Ill-Appute in each city acting US Attorney Jim Lutton said.
Jeanette Mayor, the 43 year old madam, was indicted in March along with her mother daughter
and 12 other people on federal charges ranging from racketeering to selling marijuana.
Oh god.
Mayor and her mother, Tommy Taylor, 62, admitted running the brothel and played a guilty
to prostitution in spursy.
They had a whole TV show on this.
You see it?
Remember we talked about it?
I missed that one, remember?
Get with it.
Some wondered though why the FBI and federal prosecutors were so interested in prostitution
to crime normally left to the local district attorney, especially when you think that they
got bigger fish to fry, maybe with their manpower, with their limited resources.
This case is not Ma Barker.
This is not major criminal activity said.
Here a Rosenberg, a former federal prosecutor.
I think the public normally expects the federal government to be interested in bigger things,
bigger things.
On Tuesday in Washington, Senate Majority Leader Tom Dachel said that the New Orleans investigation
arguing that the FBI ought to cooperate with lawmakers looking into intelligence failures
before the 9-11 terrorist attacks.
If the NB FBI can spend resources investigating whether there's prostitution in New Orleans,
the ought to be able to find the resources to investigate what happened in this country
pride in 9-11.
He said, no one, however, has used resources to prosecute the brothel's clients, even though
the madam offered to identify them.
Let in the city can't prosecute the men because there's no federal law against paying
someone for sex.
Did you know that?
No, I did not.
He offered his evidence to district attorney Harry Connick, whose music we can't stand,
by the way, whose office periodically prosecutes hookers.
But Connick declined the offer this week, insisting it's a federal case, started by the
FBI and it's up to the fence to finish the job.
Let in and Connick's refusal to go after the customer's stirred speculation that the men
are being protected from embarrassment.
These are probably some very prominent men who have been given political contributions
to the New Orleans lawyer William Rittenberg said.
Some of Mayor's customers are still worried, though.
Vinnie Mosque, Mayor's lawyer said several have asked her to keep their name secret.
People have called up to lobby her on the phone, Mosque said, and probably slip her
like a brown envelope and brown paper sacks to keep their name intact.
So I do like that.
At a time when the American public is becoming increasing, not skeptical, but pissed off
and fired up.
Well, that's a theory of threat.
I beg your pardon.
Prostitution.
Oh, that's right.
It's a say.
Plus, plus you also had a marriage of Vinnie.
Don't forget that.
She had a wicked wacky we.
Yeah.
That's right.
I mean, we got to keep our senses about us.
We got to be smart like the president.
We got to, if that refer madness that's in, God only knows what kind of crap is going
to be going on in this country.
We got to keep our eyes out because we got like the orange alert today.

Look at you have no idea that kid puts off Peter in Moe's wig.
The antiques last in tires on my Cadillac.
Oh, and true, and true, all true.
Meeting with Edson, the fire George, I want to pitch him.
I'll put a door, I want to kick him, with my Gucci shoe.
Oh, yeah.
Where is the station?
For a cell to have the Swiss in person,
Elveney permission from that fat gay Jewish version.
I confess, I might sex stock for it.
It's boring, George.
Oh, I like that.
Greg likes normal dance, George.
Oh, George.
I'm a story.
A story.
High dream of Ricky Williams in a dress.
Reading with his shit, drives my hate,
a lesser snippet, score to taint the fifth position,
when sports folks bring their legs.
And as well, he juxtaparts on blind.
Hey, Greg, how was George's joke today?
He talked about women like he does every day.
Talk about women.
What are they?
Well, they're not as exciting as sport-hole fans.
Reading with his shins, sport assholes,
Relic and kissin' most brown holes.
Can't get permission to make George go away.
So he sat by vegan Gucci shoes,
and they'd come back, and they'd refuse,
when these let me suspend him.
For a day.
No.
12.45 at 5.60 WDQAM.
This is great stuff.
This Josie Lamby thing you just backspinned.
Is that a sterical or what?
This is one of the all-time best.
Got some comments.
Our good old bald-headed friend, Josie Lamby.
Remember him from the Sun Sentinel?
No.
Well, we do.
Josie's written plenty about people behaving badly,
but the former Sun Sentinel gossip singer told journalists
in the speech last weekend in Fort Lauderdale,
that the bad behavior in the major leagues of dish
has been much more, very immorally unsettling even to him,
the major leagues of dish.
The Belgian born Lamby left the Sun Sentinel.
He rego for much higher-paying job
with the first classic spence account.
At the star, a supermarket tabloid
owned by Bokka Raton-based American Media Inc.,
which we love.
We love all the tabloids on this show now.
CEO David Pecker hired him.
He says, after that's his name, and of course,
it's interesting when you find out what this story is about.
It all kind of like fits in, so to speak.
CEO David Pecker hired him.
He says, after he wrote about an incident
in which Pecker's Black Corvette was keyed
in the company parking lot, and Pecker suspected employees.
The shiny dome Lamby told his fascinated audience
at the National Writers Conference
that his first six months at the tabloid were a hell
because he didn't like the people developing sources
in the New York LA or Las Vegas celebrity access
was tough, and PR agents cut him off
when he rewrote unfavorably about any of their clients.
At first Lamby was uneasy about paying sources
for information and absolute no-no on regular journalism.
He was offering people thousands of dollars
to feed him dirt about their friends,
associates, siblings, lovers, spouses, and children,
and they were taken to money.
I hate to use unnamed sources, Lamby said,
but readers wouldn't want to know
that the sister of their favorite actor
was writing him out for money.
He's gotten over his own queesiness
about buying information,
and now we're just mainstream US news organizations
to give up their hypocritical scruples.
But the columnist saves his harshest contempt
for Los Angeles law firms that specialize
in trying to scare tabloid reporters
out of writing negative pieces about their clients.
Recently Lamby said a lawyer wrote an eight page letter
warning him not to denigrate the size
of actor Greg Canier's penis.
Is that how he pronounces his name?
Yeah.
Who is he?
Don't know.
Oh, I've heard that.
Actor Greg Canier's penis.
Canier was set to play a nude orgy scene
with actor Willem Defoe.
And you want to know why his name is Willem?
His parents couldn't afford a knife.
He's Dutch.
Ah.
Ah.
Yeah, that's a very popular Dutch name.
Anyway, Canier was set to play a nude orgy scene
with actor Willem Defoe.
And an actress in the new Martin Scorsese you feel.
But according to Lamby's sources, Canier felt thoroughly
outclassed when Defoe reputedly
the best-in-doubt actor in Hollywood,
dofft his shorts and unveiled his equipment.
The lawyer's letter defended the comparative size
of Canier's organ Lamby said,
the star ran the story anyway,
but softened it a little.
And the story too.
Eight pages for something is puny as that Lamby said.
How do you like that?
They softened it just a little bit.
Yes, see?
About half.
Here's a pissed off soft-loader driver who faxes
the sentences I'm burying, I'm buying,
www.getoutoftheroad.com today.
And it'll be putting up pictures, videos,
and sounds of my friends and I harassing the homeless voice
legally, of course, keep an eye on it.
www.getoutoftheroad.com.
Nice go answer.
Says, had to lay in my horn this afternoon
to get one of these assholes out of the lane
because she was talking to the car next to me
and the light was green.
I gave her the finger then she punched my hood.
So I took the pepper spray off my wife's key chain,
did a U-turn for a drive by pepper spray,
got her square in the pushes, she came at the car again.
She dented my hood and I'm gonna sue these assholes
for all the penny rolls I can get.
Thanks, pissed off soft-loader driver.
How do you like that?
I like it a lot and I'm saving this thing.
I'm gonna go to the homeless voice.
Continued terrorizing the public all over South Florida
and the law enforcement authorities
want to look at a goddamn thing about it.
And by the way, the Brown County Chamber of Commerce
is a bogus organization.
It's totally a fraud.
I mean, it's legally registered and all of that
but it's got nothing to do with really being a chamber of commerce.
It's that religious wacko.
What's that guy's name again?
Lawrence Zolnowski.
Yeah, it's a company.
It's not a real chamber of commerce.
It's a freaking company.
Anyway, www.getoutoftheroad.com today.
Mother's Cratchers.
God, is it ever gonna end?
No.
Assholes and orange suits.
It's not bad enough.
You got the worst driving in a history of mankind
all over the place.
You got people like,
we never got an update on that story
about the 89 year old guy.
No.
That killed a four year old kid
and hit the accelerator of his jukenoo instead of the break
and ran into a whole bunch of people.
And this is his fifth incident like in the last years.
89.
This is 8am, 790.
It's 730.
A service of 435.60.
She way up.
Real boss.
Oh, Canada.
Our home and need a friend.
High-polls and sea.
Will not you earn your hand.
Yeah.
With the shy eyes,
when she's by our side,
do you reclaim your girl to see?
It's a legal drug recording tool.
Oh, who's that little guy?
I will see.
Don't leave the tree.
Curious and training.
Oh, Canada's besties besties come to me.
Oh, Canada's besties besties come to me.
255 at 560 W.M. are pooled today.
What do you smoke?
What are you smoking?
Must be smoking something because I took calls
Monday to Wednesday down here and believe me.
Most of those people were smoking.
Smoking the ragweed.
Anyway, I don't smoke anything.
I'm doing 143.
1-3rd of this audience.
Totally 1-3rd.
You turn.
Don't smoke anything.
Good for them.
Let's get a little round.
Keep those lungs healthy.
Keep everything in good shape.
Just common sense.
You don't put something in your mouth and then set it on fire.
Only idiots like me.
That smokes a stoke.
You know what I mean?
You got to be a moron.
You know what stuff is going up into your...
74 smoked pot.
17.1%.
SIGARETS AND POT.
Another 48-11.1%.
SEGARZ.
Nothing like a good stoke though.
I don't care what I just said.
SEGARZ 42.
I used to smoke cigarettes but quit 40.
SEGARZ AND POT 27.
Just like Al Goldstein.
Maybe someday you'll grow up to be like Al Goldstein
to keep smoking cigars and pot.
And eat a lot.
Yeah, and eat a lot and wind up in jail.
Do we ever get any more updates on...
No.
I used to smoke pot but quit 26.
SIGARETS 26.
And I used to smoke cigars but quit 6.
See what I mean about that?
And I bet you're one of those with Pat Quinn.
Wait till you hear this.
You know the rock?
I know the rock.
Even you know the rock.
Even though you're not a sports person or a WWE.
The rocks don't I die.
And you know, I'm looking at this and I'm thinking to myself,
maybe this makes sense.
He downs 18 of a minute of time.
But don't overreact to that.
Scorpion King Star, the rock loves Dunkin' Donuts so much.
He sucks down 18 of them in a single city.
Oh, it does have bad taste.
I can understand 18 crispy creams.
But 18 Dunkin' Donuts.
The WWE wrestling superstar whose real name is Dwayne Johnson
is 6'5 and weighs 280 pounds.
But he keeps fit as a fiddle by eating healthy food
6 days a week and going nuts on the 7th day.
I was thinking of my own like variation on that, you know?
Like maybe Eden Crap, 6 days a week and going
and doing good one day a week.
Anyway, on the 7th day is when he lets his sweet tooth run wild.
After he fills up on a dozen and a half donuts,
he goes straight to other sugary goodies it says.
I can switch to chocolate cake, then the blueberry cakes
is the 30 year old actor.
My rule for the 7th day is, treat yourself, don't cheat yourself.
What do you think about that, huh?
I don't know if it works for him, although it works out constantly.
Maybe he's just got good genes.
Florida, and you know something in the sad part of it is,
I'm pretty proud of myself because not wasting time
with any stupid phone calls, we had only one phone call today.
It was a great one because it was from Dave Johnson
and I picked War Emblem and he picked what?
What do you pick?
He picked Sunday break with Gary Stevens.
And you picked what?
The one that he had picked previously.
Proud citizen, proud citizen, right?
I'm picking War Emblem and a Belmont tomorrow
because I want to see a triple crown winner.
Because we need a chance.
And especially if you're not a fan of War Emblem
