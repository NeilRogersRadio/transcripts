Roger show on 560 WQAM
Hello
Hello
I think it's so grooming out that people are fine again together thinking about it so much
Okay, let me ask you this question. Why are you playing music?
Are you not hearing because you weren't on? No, we weren't hearing you in the beginning
How's that possible? I don't want to say why?
I miss why not?
Inquiring minds want to know
Let's go I miss it. Should I just start over again?
Yes, why do we have to go through this? We sit and talk for an hour and a half before the show starts every goddamn morning
And then all of a sudden like a two minutes before the top of the hour somebody screw things up in there
I don't want to mention what might be today, but who is it?
It's me Robert. Not the beast is it?
Nope
It's Robert
Oh Robert, well that's because you didn't like our pull on Bush
You're last name
I filled my tank up
How was I to know I'd be helping finance 9-11 by giving money to Unicaul or Avacol and the Carlyle roof?
I've turned my lights on last night
How was I to know I was paying James Baker's green fees?
I made two to two today
How was I to know I was providing bathwater to the Middle East?
Well, that made some bad again
Every time you light a marijuana cigarette, you're helping to finance where I'm going over lords and breaking a law based on the old movie Refer Madness
Better Jiu Jiu on up is the schedule of a poor man guide
I just spent a revert joint
Now I'm white man you know
For now I'm the jump of this window
AHHHHH
This message paid for by the committee to keep America in the dark ages
That boy they're doing a good job, I'll tell that
So let me ask you, do you hear me now everything okay?
Yeah, we hear you find sounds wonderful
Okay good, that's good
This is getting pretty embarrassing you know
And it's always on that end, is it everyone this end?
No
Always on that end down there, which is one of the many many reasons
Far too lengthy to a document here in this short period of time like four hours
Why I'm glad that I'm not there
The home of incompetence and ineptitude
Just like yesterday we got a blockhead
See this is the problem when you put a bunch of ex-jocks on the ear who pretend to be broadcasters
I don't want to pick on blockhead Joe Rose but the fact is that this guy he how long has he been and was he a QA
And before they finally you know before he finally departed one way or the other I don't nine years something like that
Last time I heard huh I don't know I think it was at least yeah years
And this guy doesn't know a program log from from Mr. Whipple
He doesn't know what the hell program log looks like
And this is the deal you got a bunch of ex-jocks who don't know how to turn on a microphone who wouldn't know what the hell a goddamn log looks like if you stuck one up their ass
And that's why we had all that the hello it was very exciting radio yesterday
I thought it was fun
It was so great we had a pretty good time the good news is the black sack showed up today
That's good news
So everybody's got their free food
That's the most important part as long as they keep getting the free food they're happy especially George
Yep
996 votes 966 votes on a podium today
How do you rate the job that President Bush and his administration are doing?
He's a Bozo and disaster 422 that's 43.6%
Okay, he's doing okay 184 19% excellent 159
I think Robert voted 50 times on that 16.4% which is very scary to me by the way
Fair 134 13.8% and poor 67 6.9% when you consider its our ultra liberal audience
He didn't do that bad because you got to understand that during times like these
It's just not fashionable or criticize the president and his colleagues his cohorts his partners in crime
Just like this dog and pony show they put on yesterday we'll get to that's come back that
Puerto Rican guys what George says
Who?
Jose Padilla we'll get to him momentarily
We got bigger fish to five first
Well, I mean they arrested him on the 8th of May you don't think it was just like coincidence after all this heat coming down on the FBI and the CIA
And all these embarrassments that escrops just decided to make this announcement from Russian oil as yesterday
They arrested him on the 8th of May
And then last night on the CBS even news they're saying well maybe it was the suitcase bomb
Maybe it wasn't the duty bomb well you know
But there it's a dog and pony show and of course the majority of the people being the lemmings that they are out there
Just waiting to be lit by the nose oh look at this we got it we got a bad one we got an evil door let's hear it
And of course there's always that South Florida connection notice every every scumbag that comes down to pike
Even if they arrested like in Japan somewhere no matter where they find a scumbag there's always a South Florida connection
Speaking of scumbags let's talk about Pete Boulder momentarily if we can
They're last name
Got kid at the IOD INZ clear channel continues doing it the brilliant Barry Jackass writes in a hero this morning
Phil Latsman fired for criticizing shows I'm gonna tell you something Pete Boulder
I would call you scum but that would be an insult to all the scum on the face of the earth
Whatever whatever is about 20 steps lower than scum that's what you and your cohorts a cheap channel RPD Boulder
You little tiny scumbag you
Clear channel and the reason I'm using that term is because there's nothing else I can use on the year how about Schmidthead
Okay in fact when somebody's got a wild bout of messy diarrhea that's Pete Boulder where you find in the bowl
That's exactly what you find here on a double rated Schmidt that's him
Clear channel committed not that I'm such a big Phil Latsman fan even always listening right now and he's a big group of the show
Is he's okay never stole a freight train he's alright kind of weak now actually is a pretty good guy
Clear channel communications on Monday fire W I O D W I N Z sportscaster Phil Latsman
Who blasted his former or our employer is a classless place not committed to doing good radio
Well, that's the understatement of the century
Latsman said program director Pete the assassin Boulder said he was dropped because he criticized other programming on a station
Well, he sure got some nerve don't he that you're not criticizing other programming on that station
Latsman 33 said several months ago he referred to W I N Z's pre-nascar program the racing nuts as the illiteracy hour
And advised listeners to go down to the nearest trailer park for translation. I think that's a panic. I think that's great
In fact any with a blah blah I'm not going to apologize to Joe Castella because he just got bad taste the fact of the matter is that's true
Nascar's for rednecks that whole thing trailer trash and then some Jason Salahkin will take over for Latsman on W I N Z
I don't know I'm most fed all this time on this because nobody listens that station anyway they got fractions
Jason Salahkin will take over for Latsman on W I N Z 6 to 7 p.m. weeknight sports talk show and could get the job permanently
Latsman also been W I O D's heat pre-game show door. Yeah, it says Latsman also been W I O D's heat pre-game show
Nice go there Barry you illiterate little puddle hacker you turd
Clear channel doesn't care about quality programming Latsman said they were looking for an excuse to your rid of me because I made too much money
After 10 years there I got only two weeks severance pay
Latsman married with two kids and he'll seek another job in the market since very jackass
So you know the beat goes on Latsman gets canned gets dumped unceremoniously at I O D I N Z because he was making more than five bucks an hour
You know yesterday right toward the end of the show I was the very last story that I did was a story about Peter Gotti
And it mentioned it like John Gotti and I'm watching TV a little bit later on yesterday afternoon and guess who died?
John Gotti
John Gotti the godfather
He died?
He died the godfather
So now let me forget right before the end of the show today for me to talk about Pete Bulger
What are you laughing about? You don't mess with this kid okay? How many times have I done that?
Talked about somebody and all of a sudden but I'm bing but I'm bing don't see them no more just like Paulie and a godfather
Mother scratching idiot Pete Bulger how many lives you couldn't count on your fingers and toes
All the lives that that son of a bitch has ruined in that market just just pathetic
And of course he continues to be there because he's delighted to be the assassin I think he takes joy in it now
You know what his favorite song is don't you?
Pete Bulger I get it
Yeah that's his theme song Liar Liar Pants on Fire
Well I'm not going to get sidetracked with it go back to those packs and days all the stories the bull crap
Speaking of very important people in broadcasting this is probably the most important little more important than Phil Lansman
In the heraldous morning so it must be uh unapauso por favor
Did I say that right?
Were you speaking Portuguese?
Apauso
Did not I guess answer?
Sure whatever
You don't say as Ray Leridina
I love it on him
Shut up as Ray Leridina of the Relentlessly Xanifaradishos Sabato Gigante host Mario Kreizberger
Did you know that was his real name?
I knew he was Jewish
Better known by his legendary stage name Don Francisco as voiced as son of a man to his audience for four decades applause please
Unapauso por favor
On Monday it was a subdued and humble Don Francisco who said at Bongo's Cuban Cafe to celebrate the launching of a special issue people in Esponial celebrating his 40th year on the year
Let's hear it
40 years on the air for that you boy for that to speak whatever he is
Juben
In this business you don't quit said Kreizberger whose telogenic hers are in the show a spot
In the Guinness Book of World Records is the longest continuously winning program in television history I bet you didn't know that
I had no idea and I think he's Chilean
And you know what that's not right either because hockey night in Canada has been on longer than 40 years
But hey what is Guinness know how they don't know from their hockey they're like mole they don't know their hockey
In this business you get retired by people or by ratings he says luckily Kreizberger's had plenty of admirers about a hundred
Many of them worldwide tune into the weekly
Sabato Gigante or giant Saturday on Univision because they want to see a bunch of hot naked people basically
This is the first time people in Esponial and off show to the English language magazine issued a special edition
The staff found ample inspiration they famously ebudient Don Francisco who allowed the magazine access to his archives his family even his wardrobe
And it goes on a great length much too long for me anyway wTVJ NBC anchor NBC's six anchor Jackie Nesbrall and little Estefan co-host of Univision Entertainment show El Gordo E La Flaca got their started Don Francisco side
And what a sad commentary that is I'm sure he's a wonderful guy but if he's responsible for Jackie Nesbrall well nobody's perfect
He's like my father my TV father said racial D as a model on the show the son of German Jewish immigrants
Oi! Kreizberger began a program in 1962 in his native chili bringing it to Miami 1986 it was initially a hard sell
We couldn't get advertisers said Kreizberger received a star in the Hollywood Walker family last year
We went to one big department store in this man says Spanish television your viewers are our shop lifters but we proved him wrong
That's a great line
So anyway Guinness book of records is wrong because he's been on here for 40 years hockey night in Canada has been on here for I think of 50 years
In fact it is 50 years because they're celebrating 50 years last time how about those red wings last night I was pretty boring
Oh man get that over with already
It's already the 11th of freaking June get the hockey over with already got let Carolina go home with a you know their banjo between their legs and nice job
Good you know boring but get it over with
Providence after nine we apologize for our crappy start this morning but Robert sabotaging the show probably cuz Mo put him up to it
Just a joke Mo just relax okay don't get all up tight and squirrely alright just calm down
And why does he take it out on the rest of the station too we got mad dog at one and Hank at three and even fact Josh Friedman at seven in Marlon baseball
You know if you don't want to promote me at least promote the other guys you idiot you clown
You know summertime is another one of those hot cell p days today
Yeah
Was that a difficult question why it was how come it is I feel like I'm out of sync with whatever's going on there tonight it's because of the start

Melis didn't you acidity only on CBS
I
18 at 560 WQM kind of a rough start here this morning when you say but we'll make it we'll make it to the one o'clock
Now our poll Eric was getting a little bit pushing this morning much a question much a question much a question
Yes, he George and I worked feverishly to put this all together
This is the first in an installment in many I
Didn't I talk about that yesterday? I believe you did
Because there are so many one hit wonders that you can't do it all in one day and then Eric not only has got
What's the question but then he also had like some other suggestions on it?
We'll get to those okay Mr. Hot shot Mr. Music expert we'll get to them
But just the crew your jets ok the question is and it's already up there because George factored to him a long time ago
Hours ago probably about through this month I thought some of the list
But I didn't know the question how we're wording it while the question is I'm gonna give it to him right now for Christ
I said much question the question is which of these one hit wonders was the best
Pretty simple and uncomplicated about that is there I'm not sure I understand that question
Yeah, pretty complicated pretty complex
Which of these one hit wonders was the best and I had some on the list that I I don't know where the hell
I got him off some of these other list but I looked at my billboard book
I couldn't find a one hit wonder billboard book. I'm very sorry at the world's largest bookstore
In Wood Street couldn't find it sorry
But I did look in my book to verify we had some on it that were not one hit wonders like the five man electrical band for example signs great song
But they had a couple of other always that other one I
Forgot I did too, but I'm not gonna bend down and get to buy I don't want to bend down to them
Please don't get a little bit back home dangerous and
Then there's the list you go to our website. I'm at a little later
I'll read the whole thing for just in case you're not you're your computer right now. You want to get motivated
And yes, there are many more in this like I said it's the first in a series
I don't know when we'll do the next moment. Maybe we'll do it again tomorrow. I don't know
Maybe you'll do it a week from a circus whenever how I feel like it out here like that, huh? That's when we'll do it Eric
When the mood strikes me like tomorrow
See and this really shocks me is because I didn't put this on it. Did I put it on there? Oh, I did put it on there
It's a second
Well, the reason I put it on there is because I could only find two
Two CDs yeah, well, I didn't have a lot of time to scour you know on today. I'll scour all the record stores downtown
But I only found two one hit wonder CDs
So I had to put some of the stuff on here for example. I wouldn't
Personally, I wouldn't vote for this myself, but since we had now we had that comedy bit on it right right?
Right and I love those by the way
And who don't like Taco?
To go to why don't you know where fashion sits?
Did he say sets? Yeah, he said schmitz
But anyway
See John Sebastian had a lot of hits with love and school pool, but
This was a memory of his one hit by himself
You didn't even know that you didn't know that was John Sebastian did you? No, oh, I forgot I knew it before and then I bet you most of our music
Experts in the audience didn't know that was Johnson better great Johnson Sebastian either because it was such a crappy TV show good theme
But the you see the theme always annoyed me because I associated it with that show it was a good theme
One it I didn't like it
You didn't like that sorry, no, oh, yeah, it was kind of dippy
But now that I know that's Johnson Sebastian. I view it with a whole I listened to it with a whole different altitude
See even even at Dippy start. I like it
Anyway, we'll get to the list and all that stuff just calm down here
We could go ahead put it up there
We gave it a list hours ahead of time today and you make it at very complex
Which of these one hit wonders was the best and this is just the first installment there probably like about
5,000 one hit wonders wouldn't you think?
At least since we didn't put any like time limitation on this in fact the one sheet that somebody faxed me was just
1970 alone of which we took many of them in the stuck them on here today just one year of like the last 52 years for example since 50
Anyway CBS news we better get to your good close personal friend. What's his name?
What's his name Jose Padilla? Oh, yeah, my buddy one of your people
Not necessarily not in your close immediate family, but he's like just like what's his name over there Don Francisco's one of my people
I'll take down Francisco over Jose Padilla any day, but anyway
US officials are backing away from assertions that the man arrested last month in Chicago last month
Was plotting a dirty bomb attack on the US according to a CBS correspondent Jim Stewart
You know that trippy little Jim Stewart on CBS. Nope
Basically says they lied
US officials now admit they're not sure what American forna dola al-Muhau
Muhau years plans were ready returned to the West last month and any plot including possibly exploding radiation
Bomin Washington DC was in the initial planning stages
But given what he trained for an Afghanistan they'd expected the worst in other words. They didn't know what that was going on
He researched nuclear weapons and received training in wiring explosive violent Pakistan and was instructed to return to the West to conduct
Recona-Sons operations for al-Qaeda's a deputy defense secretary Paul Wolfowitz
Investigators had known a muhajir for some time including his alias
Much of their information about him came from Abu Zubeid al-Qaeda's top surviving operations officer until his capture last March
Who tipped them off to muhajir's American mission?
He had indicated some knowledge of Washington DC
But I want to emphasize again that there was not an actual plan
We stopped this man in the initial planning stages said wolf woods
That was echoed by FBI director Robert Mueller who also said the plan to explode a dirty bomb had not gotten past the planning stages
But don't let that stop the media
Because right away as soon as this story broke as soon as the announcement made the rest even it was over a month before
The media starts going on about dirty bombs and blah blah blah blah and radiation and run for the hills and hide under the table
Muhajir born in New York as Jose Padilla was detained by the FBI in Chicago over a month ago when he flew in from Pakistan on May the 8th
Yesterday the last time I checked was June the 10th more than a month later
US Attorney General John Ascroft speaking in Moscow where he was meeting with the Russian officials announced he rest yesterday
We've disrupted an unfolding terrorist plot to attack the US by exploding a radioactive dirty bomb ascroft said
The Attorney General said the government had multiple independent and corroborating sources that LL
Muhajir was closely associated with al-Qaeda and was involved in planning future terrorist attacks on innocent American civilians in the US
I'm not poop-pulling the fact that they got him now just cut his legs off and put him in a broom closet somewhere and you know, so we'll be safe
But it's a part of the whole dog and pony show that just never ends because they got to cover the rest now
They got to make it look like they have some idea what's going on, which of course they don't
Then there's the Broward connection which we'll get to from the Sun sentinel. Did you read that? Of course not
Somebody read it to you? You will I will
But before that CNN dot com says it's the chaos not the chemicals that likely would cause the most harm should a dirty bomb explode
Experts say heart attacks not radiation poisoning might claim more victims
So what we're trying to say is in spite of the arrest everybody don't don't panic
That's what we're trying to say don't get all bet out of shape in spite of the media trying to get you all whipped up into a
hysterical frenzy don't do it don't do it don't get all been out of shape. There is no goddamn dirty bomb
People with a half mile radius of even a particularly potent dirty bomb would be exposed to less than the average dose of
Radiation of person received naturally within a year according to the American Institute of Physics website
Or there's nothing like a good physics. That's what my mother says
Most people are working radiation environments annually received ten times the exposure of a person with a half mile of a dirty bomb the site says
Stress and fear induced heart attacks are more likely to cause death after a dirty bomb explosion than a radioactive material
But let me stress again as far as we know there is no dirty bomb
There's a dirty rat, but there is no dirty bomb
We should emphasize that unlike the rest of the media. They're exploiting this like crazy
It said it's the ignorance of the actual threat that produces the most harm people may mistakenly envision a small-scale version of the nuclear devastation experience that Hiroshima
Japan but the radioactive material and dirty bombs would not likely cause any more harm than that of the explosion itself
According to the council on foreign relations the size of the explosive device would dictate the extent of any death toll follow that
I got it in other words not something really nice, but not anything you could all hysterical about but the media wants people to get hysterical
Because then no watch and it's good for ratings and that's good for business and that's what the whole world is about about business
927 at 560 WQM speaking of business here's a simple question for you if somebody offered to give you just hand over to you several thousand dollars over the next few years
Would you take it or be a little stupid not to do it which makes it really foolish to pass up a chance to refinance or buy a home at just
3.95 percent
Here's the deal is a Fannie Mae program available 3.95 percent for both refinancing and purchasing of homes think about it
Just 3.95 percent and all you have to do is call financial group at their toll free number 1 800 940 53 63
To be more specific you can get yourself a hundred grand with payments of only 475 bucks a month or get you 200 grand with payments of only
950 dollars a month you'll save yourself a crap load of money so it'd be downright stupid to pass up a chance like that
Do the math and do the next smart thing get the details by calling financial group toll free it's 1 800 940 lend
That's 1 800 940 53 63 there were an equal housing lender credit restrictions do apply and rates are sub
Like they're my natural team
We take the 10 on 440 560

Mystics and Hushabai's got four
Mine and three more
Dirty bomb suspect has criminal past in Broward from the early 90s. How do you like that? No surprise?
Every scumbag every degenerate every low life area trash every
Sunrise police lieutenant Charlie Vitale recognized the name instantly even a decade later
Jose Padilla lived in Lauderdale when Vitale arrested him after a road raid shooting incident in 1991
Vitale was a brand new detective on the job for only two years at the time
I almost shot him because he went for his gun Vitale said too bad it was almost Charlie
Padilla's in a lot more trouble now prosecutors announced yesterday that Padilla now Abdullah Al Mujah here after converting to Islam in the early
1990s is part of an al-Qaeda terrorist network that plotted to unleash a radioactive bomb La Bomba in the US
Maybe he listened to Richie valence one time too many you know it maybe put him over the edge
Guess we ain't gonna be here in him no more hungry. We got that there somewhere too, but yeah to La Bomba
But he had other hits unfortunately and then of course he died in that plane with the big bopper and buddy Holly buddy Holly
You know something I like buddy Holly, but I think he was a little bit overrated
I agree. Thank you for saying that. I mean buddy Holly had you know
He was good buddy on the crickets that'll be the day, you know and Peggy Sue
He was okay. He was pretty good. Just fine if he hadn't died
I mean the fact that he died and I plan crash made him bigger than life itself and a big bopper. I mean
You know he was fun
But he had chantilly lace. What else did he have?
Dye
Well, I guess I better look at that
Yep, get back to that story about Jose Padilla. See we're like mixing and matching today
We have lots of filler music by the way for you to look stuff up. Oh, no, I don't need filler music to look stuff up
If I want filler music, I got it right here
Oh, yeah, I know John now it's starting to bug me. What am I looking for the big bopper? Yes, he's still dead by the way
He's singing up there. Oh, that's right. He had the big bopper's wedding
So he doesn't qualify for one hit wonders because otherwise he would chantilly lace 8458
See that's another thing the byproduct of our polls is the age factor see
Because I think a tremendous number of our listeners weren't even born when most of these songs were it like Robert there for example
What does Robert know about these songs right? I?
Know some not all I mean he knew the the pro-claimers
I'm gonna be 500 miles because that was like only nine years ago and he's big on anything from nine years ago
Anyway, Padilla to a government interrogators after the rest may aeth in Chicago
They turned to Islam while incarcerated in the Barakaday jail and ultimately took his Islamic name
Not you love all the all these of jailbirds a good they go to jail and all of a sudden they become like a born again Christians
They become Muslims
FBI agent showed up at the sunrise police department about a month ago looking for his fingerprint cards and paperwork by tell said
Like some of the terrorists who flew airplanes in US buildings on 9 11
Padilla had ties to South Florida living there from 1990 to release 1997
Religious leaders at several local mosques say they did not recognize his name or his photo at the Lake Park Gardens
Condo complex in plantation
There was a plaque quoting scripture on a door at the home of Padilla's mother Estella or Tehga as for me and my house
We will serve the Lord there was also a statue of a cherub reclining two bows decorated with American flag patterns and a handwritten note
Please leave this family in peace
Victor Olds or Tehga's lawyer said Monday's announcement regarding the so-called dirty bomb plot
Cutter off guard and that before Padilla's arrested or here when he arrived from from Pakistan via Zurich holding ten thousand dollars in cash
His mother thought he was coming home to visit his family
She said to me that she never had any information that would have led her to believe that her son was involved in terrorist group old said
She knows that he was in the Middle East for a while, but that's nothing else. She knows
When Jose was for his mother as
Estella or Tehga moved him to the west coast while West Chicago rather from Brooklyn and
West Chicago they lived in a modest row house
They shared with two other families his father apparently died when he was young neighbors
We call that his name was Pucho or Pudgy and that he played softball in the streets Pucho, I guess
What do you mean you guess? I never heard that word but law enforcement you're learning something not even ten o'clock
And he's already learning esponial here today. This is thick learned in Spanish on the near Roger show
But law enforcement sources say he ended up pursuing less benign activities
He joined the Latin kings a street gang that used to promote itself as a non-violent source of empowerment for young Latinos
Before dozens of its leaders were sent to jail the sources also say was involved in a gang-lang murder when he was only 13
On the night of August 1585 to Shiva's 15th birthday Pudgy and five others attacked and robbed three men on Chicago street
Quar Records said one victim was fatally stabbed and Pudgy kicked him in the head
Because he was a juvenile records are not available on what charge Pudgy a face or the outcome of the case in
1991 he moved to Florida where he was living with a girlfriend and working at hotels for 200 bucks a week
According to a successful workers compensation claim that knitted him an additional five bucks a week and driving a car with tinted windows
And that important that we know that he was driving a car with tinted windows boy
This I've tied to this unsent and although mess around important part of the profile
October 891 Pudgy was driving a black Toyota to sell money flashed a handgun and two men another car during a traffic incident
Both cars stopped at a gas station Oakland Park Boulevard and University drive where a Pudgy pulled out a gun fired at the windshield and missed the
Court of the police report no one was injured. I know that intersection very well. No the gas station
He was a 20 year old vitality just got angry and popped off around
Staking out the house where Pudgy lived with his girlfriend at 2315 Northwest 55th Harrison Lawyer Hill eight hours after the road
Regents and it by tell didn't know about Pudgy's extensive arrest record a record that include his involvement in a murder and robbery as a juvenile
Pudgy was walking up to the houseman by telling his partner a yoke from to get to the on the ground
He started backing up and reached into his waistband for the gun before officers of doodam
There were only a couple of times I could look back and know for sure that something was very close
And that was one of the vital said Pudgy was charged with aggravated assault firing a firearm from a vehicle and carrying concealed weapon
1991 and spent 303 days in Broward County jail
He told police at the time of Zerestead worked for two weeks at the holiday in on University drive and plantation setting up banquet rooms
Boy, this is this is all like too close to home, you know what?
Enrico's on and on and on Pudgy
Alive did a number of locations around South Florida including the sundown apartments in Lauderdale

It's got to be a descriptor that it says Montego and of course that even the song is Montego Bay
You made a mistake
No matter what you call it it sucks
I got the goddy story here and this is gonna take a long this is a very lengthy story from news day and like I told you this morning
Every New York paper of course has got lengthy lengthy lengthy articles and editorials and stories and stuff about John
Goddy, but I think this one's the best and it goes on forever
John goddy once considered America's most powerful mobster, but also the man who helped cause the demise of the modern mafia
died yesterday in a federal prison hospital from complications of cancer while serving a life sentence from murder and raccotour
Goddy 61 who'd been dubbed the Teflon Don after you escaped convictions and previous trials was convicted in 1992 of raccotouring conspiracy
Including six murders and sent to the country's toughest prison US-Pentry had Miriam Illinois with no chance for parole
It was transferred to the federal prison hospital in Springfield in the zary last September when his throat cancer became more advanced
Goddy was pronounced that at 12.45 pm yesterday and autopsy will be conducted to determine the another interesting
He died at 12.45 right and at 12.55
10 minutes later I did that story about Peter Goddy and John Goddy you see
How do you like that huh as Neil psychic powers again put that mystery out of shame that pony bitch
And autopsy what that music's too hot for your reading
And autopsy will be conducted to determine the exact cause of his death at a stemolution by prison spokeswoman Diane Smith
Roger better the once robust mobster Goddy start and crime as a queen struck hijacker
hijacker become steadily debilitated
Unable to do any physical activity or take solid food in his final days
So that's good news. We like you're an aunt
Unless of course you happen to be a mafia fan
Just like somebody would say that we were upset when sentino or we were happy when sentino got shot on a causeway
We were Christball and when sonny got shot on a causeway
Look what they do boy
Yeah you idiot
I
Often referred to with the dapper dawn because of his flamboyant attire the silver-haired Goddy became the boss of the Gambino organized crime family following that a
Sebra 16th 1985 slang of his predecessor
Podcast the Lana outside of sparkstake house in midtown manhattan remember where I'm sure you've seen it on TV
The pictures they showed in the newspapers are the bloody pictures of bloody pictured man. What a mess
Goddy's orchestration of the Christmas time assassination of Castelano and Vodka guard Thomas Balotti
Was a naked gram per power which befitted his brutal leadership style
And the yellow delacroche
Goddy's mob meant to run under boss of the Gambino crime family had dampened the repetiastness of younger members of the crime family
The satisfied with Castelano's rule
But the death of delacroche on December 2nd 85 removed the last impediment to the killing of Castelano
Who was viewed by many in the mob as a greedy everwishes boss be set by legal problems that made him vulnerable
The fact that some of Goddy's crew from the Bergenhund and Fish Club in Ozone Park including brother Gene
Had been implicated in heroin traffic something banned by Castelano under penalty of death
Forced the aspiring mobster to strike first before he was killed because of the drug dealing the Castelano hit card the rest of the mob off guard
Goddy had very little choice had run gold stock from ahead of the state organized crime strike force in the 80s about the Castelano hit and because Goddy was so first and then ruthless
There was a no uh
There was no to nobody to go against him. Well, I've misprinted there in news day back. There was no to go against him
The highlight of his last trial in a federal courtwoman Brooklyn came when Goddy's former underbar Salvatore Gravano
Testified that Goddy directed the killing of Castelano and sat with Gravano in a car less than a block away
While a team of his henchmen shot down Castelano in a close aid like we just said moment to go
Thomas Vallotti
During his reign and at least up until his imprisonment Goddy ruled the crime family with an iron fist
But it was his mouth specifically secret mutterings about his crimes picked up by hidden FBI bugs that landed Goddy in prison
On January 17th 1990 and a tape Goddy was heard talking about his love for the mafia
And this is going to be a Kosa Nosha till I die
He said be it an hour from now or be it tonight or a hundred years from now when I'm in jail
It's going to be the way I say it's going to be a Kosa Nosha
our thing
But the irony is that Goddy's musings profanities and indiscretions caught on the surveillance tapes are now viewed by most experts
As the major piece of ammunition federal and state investigation needed to cripple a Kosa Nosha in New York City
Goddy gotty no no he brought attention to himself with a flashy lifestyle that included two thousand dollar bioni suits
Kind of like what's his name? They're like Joey Zaza
Maybe someday he'll make you famous too, remember that I remember
Hey sure. I have a Bella Fagura, but hey Joey
Zaza
Anyway, not only were two thousand dollar bioni suits like Greg Reed
But he was also unable to avoid electronic surveillance. He when he knew he was the target of investigators a gold stock
Some of the most damaging tapes were made at the apartment of an elderly widow above the Ravenite social club on Mulberry Street in little Italy
The recordings were used at the federal trial of Goddy in his underlings in 1992 and convictions in the case effectively
Decapitated leadership of the Gambino crime family leaving a power vacuum filled unsuccessfully for the most part by inept leaders
including Goddy's son John a Goddy known as junior
He brought the Gambino family to its knees and Andy Currens a former FBI special agent who investigated the crime family
Guys he put in charge were loyal to him to the extent of anything else not people who were earners or had any respect and organized crime circles
He was the epitome of the thug said Joseph coffee a private investigator who has city police detective also progody in the crime family
He ruled strictly by intimidation as opposed to mother mob figures like Luciano who was smart
Lansky who was smart not dumb like Frado but smart
Despite his pension for crime in mayhem Goddy had a keen sense of humor
But some of his anthics in court done for the benefit of reporters only served to incents prosecutors and FBI agents who would target it and for him for prosecution kind like Al Goldstein
For example in his 1992 trial Goddy once blew a kiss toward a prosecutor at another point when it appeared that defensive attorneys have caught a witness in a contradiction
Goddy drew an imaginary pistol from his waistband and fired off some fake bullets for FBI agents
During one rest break Goddy pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and wrapped it around his face in the best imitation of a western bandit
During jury selection U.S. district judge
I. Leo Glasser threatened to move the trial of another city because of the media coverage when the judge briefly left the conference room
Goddy said we're going to move it stutka at West Germany his words both in and out of court were often a profane
On tapes played at his trials got mommy better stop right there
Jimmy
Yes, you're gonna go way over why don't want to go over to break we gotta come back to it come back to stuttgart
Or as they say as some of the egoims say stuttgart

No, I did not know that well now you know that
From the album maybe you've been brainwashed to on MCA or whatever the hell new radicals a medley of their smash so there you go
That's not on a list of obvious reasons

They don't know how corny those are unbelievable by eMF has got six. It's well. Whatever. It's gonna be. It's gonna be okay
Just calm down. I'll get back to my John Gotti crap. Oh, please
Like I said, it's long and it's very long his words both in and out of court were often profane
Untaped played at his trials. Gotti could be heard uttering expletives after losing huge bets on slow horses and lackluster football teams
And while blasting mobsters who not show them respect
At his last trial appearing without his long-time attorney Bruce Cutler have been disqualified because of legal conflicts
Gotta gave the appearance of a man who realized he was going down to the feet
On several occasions in loud a size. He called the judge in prosecutors faggots and worse
Faggots
Gotti who lived in a white clappboard house and Howard Beach that sports a large satellite TV dish was practically unknown publicly when he took over leadership of the Gambino
Cran family
But he soon gained the status of a fokia with him any because of his acquittals expensive suits hand-painted silk ties and swash buckling ways
Though married to Victoria L.D. Georgia in the early 1960s
Gotti reportedly was link romantically to blonde beauty Lisa Gastino from a wife of jets football star Mark Gastino
Remember guard Mark Gastino who was done was it him that was Diana? Was it her that was dying? I don't know
Robert would know
What one day she was dying then the next day she wasn't fine
Well, maybe that maybe somebody made it off or she couldn't refuse, huh? Maybe that's what that was all about
Gotti a one-time petty thief and hijacker worked his way up through the mob the hard way by earning respect and being ruthless
Way needed to be born in the South Bronx October 27th
John Joseph Gotti was the fifth of thirteen children raised by his father John a construction worker and mother Fanny
Immigrants from the Naples region of Italy. Dinapoli. Napoli
Ever been to Naples
Florida
That's what I'm talking about toilet
When he was 12 them and by the way you people over there in Naples the beesleys giving my checks on time
Okay, I appreciate the ones that are a day early previous but let's get them there on time you assholes
When he was 12 the family moved to East New York Brownsville section of Brooklyn
Gotti's formal schooling ended at age 16 when he dropped out of Franklin L. Lane high school in Brooklyn
By the time he was 24 he had nine arrest and several brief jail sentences for street fighting
Public intoxication stealing cars burglaries bookmaking and gun possession
In the midst of such trouble he and his wife had five children including two daughters
Angel also knows angel and Victoria who became a best-selling novelist and writer for the New York Post

Well check your list my baby love it love I wrote it down right baby loves love Eric not my baby loves me
It's kind of hard to get votes for a song that don't exist now speaking of something that doesn't exist
I have another CD sitting over here among not too many that I've bought here, but anyway
I thought for sure that this would be like a medley of their smash and come to find out it wasn't even a hit
I don't
Shock the crap
The band and the way
Wasn't feeling
This never made the top anything that was there, but so I got me to look up the band in my billboard book
And it says rock group formed in Woodstock, New York, Robbie Robertson guitar leave on helm vocals and drums
Rick d'Anco bass Richard manual and Garth Hudson keyboards all hailed from Canada except except leave on helm from Arkansas
And of course the name like that like leave on
Groups farewell concert on Thanksgiving day 76 was documented in the martin scorsese movie the last Waltz
Manual committed suicide on a 3486 of the age of 42 group was inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 1994 and never really had a big hit
Up on cripple cripple quick right 69 every snow number 25 that was 1129 69 and don't do it
Uh October 14 1972 that only got a size number 34 so they never had like a top 20 hit much less top 10 and I thought this was
Their first single but never made the charts
I just I'm in shock so much to learn about music and so little that we know you know what
Especially this bogus pole we're taking today really frost my ass okay you soft sell assholes out there
25 votes looking glass brandy 13 Norman green bomb and I'm we you must have that there somewhere. I have it at home
No, I'm saying we got it there
I would know where oh okay well don't knock yourself
I'm gonna go out and buy a whole bunch of these today
But he finds has don't buy anything
I know it's not don't tell me look I let me get to that story now okay now that you inspired me
I don't want to plan any seeds in anybody's mind. I got a stir here you go like host
Like host through office of scripture music service anybody want to sign up. No anybody want to pay for it. No
internet portal like coast duck you know what this is like
coast
It's like if if somebody was some guy out there was getting like laid with Britney Spears three times a day and somebody says
Hey, guess what we got the what's your name over here? What's your name?
Kathy willow's you want to pay for it?
See what I'm saying yeah
You're starting to sound like Renfield well maybe those people that feel really bad about downloading the music for free
Maybe they'll subscribe
I'm sorry almost got that and where do we where do we find such people
Not a miss audience. I'll tell you that no internet portal like host.com is launching today today. This is timely
See a new subscription music service that offers unlimited streaming access to
143,000 songs for just 10 bucks a month
It's latest push to draw users into paid premium content
Anybody want to sign up? No
Like host is becoming the largest internet company to partner with San Francisco's listen.com
Which is signed deals with four the five major record labels to give access to songs streamed to a personal computer with CD quality
Sound your arrangement does not allow people to save songs record them on CDs. Well
You know, let me read that last sentence again. Please arrangement does not allow people to save songs or certainly not record them on compact discs
The how much do they want me to pay for 10 bucks a month? Oh a bar. I stopped mighty listen on my computer speakers
Wonderful the new like host wraps. If you service available at ht.t
music.lycos.com
Why do they put that ht.t.p. crap?
We'll be offered for free through June 30th after that like host plants three tiers of service
In fact, I got tears running down my cheeks just reading this from laughter free access to 20 channels of FM quality sound five bucks a month
For over 50 commercial free channels in CD quality and 10 dollar monthly for unlimited streams of individual individual songs plus the 50 channels
Rhapsody's got music licensing deals with BMG Sony music entertainment EMI recorded music
And Warner music group representing artists including Christine Aguilera
Lincoln Park Lincoln Parks. Okay. Jennifer Lopez
Jay Z Lauren Hill
Prince
Bruce Springsteen
And Simon and Garfunkel
Universal's the only major label not not participating in rhapsody in your pants
PJ McNeely a top digital music aim list with consultants gardener G2 said for listeners by far the most significant internet service provider deal
That's been struck for like hosts an incremental step in a strategy of offering more paid services to grow revenues
Nignely said he thinks listen dot com's got a good chance of becoming much more popular than the industry sponsored streaming music sites music net and press play
Those each have only three of the five labels participating cap how many songs can be downloaded per month
And I've never disclosed how many subscribers they've attracted from our user standpoint
Listen as perhaps the most advanced of the services that are out there because all the deals they have structured with record labels McNeely said
But McNeely said a major limiting factor on the potential priority of like coaster our popularity of like host rhapsody is that the services are tied to your PC
Which is a problem for people who want to be able to download songs and save them listen to later on a portable music player or like in their car
Or like on something with like good speakers, you know what I mean? I know it might like sound like a real song
Like music
McNeely said gardener estimates only 16% of adults regularly listen to streaming music at home or work
And a big question is how many people would rather spend 120 dollars a year for continuous one-time access to songs instead of buying CDs
They can keep or other options which we of course will mention
Sean Ryan the chief executive of listen dot com studies competent users will find the wraps of the system a simple
Easily understandable way to get access to music without the risk of introducing viruses to their computer by using illegal
Napster inspired music sharing services. That's right
Don't be using that illegal stuff. You risk introducing a virus to your thing
I would never and there's nothing worse than having a virus in your thing
Digital music should be for all users. It's not for the very young with the very geeky or the very cutting edge Ryan said
It's just for people to want choice
It shouldn't be challenging. It shouldn't be threatening. It's just be another way to get music you want to listen to

Coming up tonight on Inside the Behind the True Hollywood celebrity music
biography profile story. We take a good, hard, stiff look into startup.
Their infectious pop-stylings infected us with an infection until we took some antibiotics
and a thing for the one away in a week or so. They were to pow.
People are all you're asking us where we got the name to pow.
In this weird interview, the power leads singer Carol Decker makes the rash assumption
that we give a flying f*** about her in her stupid band.
Well, to pow was a character on Star Trek. She was a vulcan high priestess.
Interesting enough, confessing that she named her band after a Star Trek character,
branded Carol Decker as such a hopeless geek that it prevented her from getting laid during
your entire tenure as a famous person. It's ironic, you know, because as you probably know,
Vulcan's have to mate with every seven years or they like explode.
Why no, Carol, you annoying strange person. We didn't know that. But let me ask you this.
If the band to pow doesn't have a hit every seven years, do they explode too?
Well, I don't know. I mean, like, what are you getting at? I mean, will he had that one
hit and has been well over time? Ladies and gentlemen, a little glimpse of what the world
would be like if TV show announcers had all the power. It's a big juicy, shopping-wet
luggage show business tonight on Inside the Mind. You know what? I think we made a mistake.
We we. We we. Yeah, I think the name of that star. I mean Eric made a mistake, but that
goes without saying. My baby loves loving is the name of that. I think you're right.
We're in a positive here at the end. Oh, sorry, Eric. Did you look it up? I just looked it up.
Well, they kind of mumbled it. Let's see, question, a question mark in
the series are from Bay City and Saginaw Michigan. Just like I said, how do you like that?
There's also a Saginaw Bay City in Midland, Texas. So in other words, maybe that's where they got
the mistake in Billboard, but they are definitely from Saginaw, Michigan makes no mistake about that
because I was living in Michigan and playing that on the radio at the time. How do you like them,
apples? I feel I know my Michigan boy and baby. So anyway, Tapao speaking of that was next time we
do this. Yeah, whenever the hell the mood strikes like maybe tomorrow or four weeks, whenever
the hell I feel like it, you know, I kind of enjoy it. Even though we get bogus votes, Tapao,
pop rap, we'll put them on here next time. Pop rock group from Shrewsbury, England.
Carol Decker vocals, Bering Howard guitar, Mick Chetwood keyboards, Paul Jackson bass,
and Timberges drums. Van name after a Vulcan princess, an episode of the TV series Star Trek.
Did you know that? Yeah, I shouldn't admit that. Oh, you were the one.
Heart and Soul reached number four in 87. That was a medley of their smash. So Tapao will be
on there one of these days. By the way, something. Yes, I don't know what site you were looking for,
that one hit wonder central dot com. He's already he already put it up there in an
blazing green on my okay, because I hate here. One hit wonder central website is one hit wonder
central dot com. Okay. Thank you, Eric. It's great. He's trying to rub it in now just because
he made a mistake on white planes and we made a mistake on her too. So I do like that. Take that.
Take that, Mr. Hatch. Hot. Soft cell and tainted loves got 36. Are you do by that for a minute?
No, looking glass by Brandy 16. I mean, Brandy's the name of the song. See, that's interesting.
You look at some of these and you can't tell what's the name of the group in the song, but we know
what it is. Brandy or a fine bitch. A Norman Greenbaum, a spirit in the sky. I also got 16.
Mountain Mississippi Queen 15. Zaguar and Evans in the year 2525 has got 13. And then it's downhill
from there. No, no, no, no, no, hey, hey, it's got 12. Now, where is the Indiana wants to be by our
Dean Taylor? That better have a one or two more votes. I'm going to be two. Oh, oh my God.
I'll tell you, I knew before the show started. There was no God, but now I know for sure positive.
Hey, you want a good laugh? Here's a great story for from the Sun Central Day. I was good for a few
chuckles. Boint and officials say power company will help build Marlon Stadium there. That's right.
When City Commissioner Mike Ferguson suggested building a stadium for the Florida Marlins in
Boint and Beach last year is proposal was met with laughter and ridicule. But Ferguson says the idea
is no laughing matter. And now he's found a company to bankroll part of it, but he won't identify
the potential financial backer. In a June 1st letter to Marlon's president David Samson,
Ferguson says he has an offer from an unnamed California based power generation company
to spend maybe and run to spend $350 million on the project. The company would supply
power to baseball stadium using state-of-the-art technology letter states Ferguson said yesterday he
couldn't reveal the name of the company. Otherwise more laughter probably would start. In May 2001,
Ferguson proposed building a 400 to $500 million $65,000 seat stadium where they were
tractable roof inside Quantum Corporate Parkoff I 95. I'm sure a lot of us would drive all
the way up there to Boint and Beach to see tomorrow, wouldn't you? Yeah. Robert would go.
He got free tickets. I'd go if I got free food like at the sky box and like a free helicopter ride.
Limo, the idea raised more than a few eyebrows but Ferguson said he remained serious about
attracting the Marlon's to Boint and Beach. Ferguson said two thirds of the team's four
thousand season ticket holders come from Broward, Palm Beach and Martin counties, but Samson said
that number seemed a little bit high. Well maybe Commissioner Ferguson was a little high when he
gave out those numbers. During last night's Marlon's game in Kansas City, which the Marlon's won,
by the way next reading. What was it? The 15th eight? Robert doesn't know. Something like that.
You know something you work on a show where all they talk about is soccer and basketball and
little bit of baseball and you don't know the score last night's Marlon game. I'm pretty sure they
said it went. I'm pretty sure that it went 14 innings and a Marlon scored seven on the top of
the 14th and one 15th eight. I believe so. Does it make a difference? No, no. There were 500
team. During last night's Marlon game in Kansas City, Samson said it wouldn't be fair to comment
further till he reads a proposal. Ferguson estimates the cost of building the stadium is closer to 500
million. He said he based that figure on other stadiums built around the country. He suggests
baseball could spend about 100 million of the total cost with some of it coming from the Marlon's
to baseball commissioners office and the players union pension. Another 50 million could come from
the local county, state and federal agencies. He said Ferguson said the quantum pike started because
of its proximity to I-95 in the trial rail station was crucial to the deal. It's right by the trial
rail. Oh, you want to have a board? Asked whether the unnamed California based company
seemed serious about its offer. He said I would think there'd have to be some due diligence done,
but when somebody surfaces with $350 million worth of bonds, I think they have to be given some
sort of credibility. He said Ferguson said he could give no details about the proposal to issue
bonds. Major League baseball and the Major League Players Association both said they hadn't seen
the letter and couldn't comment. Everybody is mum. The Marlins have a lease at PP Park in North
State County through 2003 with 7 and 1 year options after that. Since new owners took over the
team in February, the Marlins have avoided talk of a new stadium and focused instead on the team's
500 performance. The team officials repeatedly have stressed that they generate more revenue
particularly at PP Park where the team's lease favors H. Wayne High Pingo who owns the stadium
and once on the team as we know before he sold them down the river. Last week, where'd emerged the
team that has had preliminary discussions with the University of Miami about moving into the
Orange Bull in 2004, temporarily, as a way to generate more revenue. Right. Now what's it going
to be about a 75-foot home run down the lines in the Orange Bull? 110 feet. No, seriously, the
Orange Bull is not configured for baseball. Isn't it old and ready to collapse? Yes. A dump, a toilet.
Point and beach Mayor Gerald Broning said he thought the letter has great merit in the ideas worth
pursuing if the company's offer is legitimate. I think it's a good scheme, Broning said. I think
somebody would have to go through the formal procedure and all of the bells and whistles to do it.
So there you go. The Boynton Beach Marlins. Let's hear it. They're doing it baby and Boynton Beach.
I told you to get a chuckle or two out of that. Here's another one you might get a chuckle or two out
of in a sadistic way known what a prick you are. George? Yes. Vatican accused Kentucky Bishop
resigns. This one we had a story on and now he's out. Bishop J. Kendrick Williams of Lexington,
Kentucky accused in several sex abuse cases resigned yesterday. The Vatican be saying
the bishop who is denied the charges has been on administrative leave. The Vatican said the
Pope accepted the resignation submitted under church law for illness or some other grave reason.
In lawsuits against the Archdiocese three plaintiffs alleged abuse by Williams. James W.
Bennett alleged Williams abused him in 1981 while Bennett was a 12 year old altar boy.
David Hall, the alleged Williams, followed him when Hall was an 18 year old high school senior,
a third plaintiff who filed suit last week also accuses Williams of molesting him when Williams
was a priest in Louisville. In a statement last week, Williams said I have never sexually abused
anyone at any time in my life. Do you believe me? No. Williams is the third bishop brought down in the
sex abuse scandal rocking the Roman Catholic Church in the U.S. in January. The announcement of his
resignation comes two days before American bishops meet in Dallas to decide on proposals to deal
with sexual abuse and the clergy and how to cover all of this up. How to cover their ass.
Monk shooting the river on motive remains mystery. Remember I asked yesterday about the Abbey? Right?
Well, a Roman Catholic Abbey in conception of Missouri is that I guess that is because it's with the T.
It's not not a Spanish name. Look. A Roman Catholic Abbey erupted in gunfire as a 71 year old man
wheeling two assault weapons killed two monks and moved into others before committing suicide,
leading bewildered residents in conception Missouri wondering about a motive.
Interviews with relatives and neighbors of Lloyd Robert Jeffries, a Jeffress.
Or maybe didn't like his last name Jeffress, J-E-F-F-R-E-S-S.
Healed that no clues is to either be tarry packed two rifles and separate boxes,
drove his green Chevy cavalier to far Northwest Missouri on Monday and then opened fire
in the hallway of the conception Abbey official set. Investigators were digging in a Jeffress
religious past but there was no immediate indication if the shootings were related to the sex
scandal in which priest around the country had been accused of molesting youngsters.
Jeffress also did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or booze and had no known criminal past.
It doesn't make much sense to have a patrol sergeant sheld in lion's set and makes you wonder what
goes through a person's mind to make him do something like this.
Griefstrick and residents in conception about 90 miles north of Kansas City offered prayer,
food and flowers to those at the Benedictine monastery and seminary. The doors of the conception
Abbey were locked for the first time in a recent memory overnight and a highway patrolman stood guard.
The Reverend Gregory Poland, Abbott of the Abbey City, mistook the first shot as a window breaking,
the monks and staff varicated themselves in their rooms when they realized shots were being fired.
The whole thing lasted about five minutes, maybe even less Poland said.
Investigators interviewed Jeffress's daughter in Norbourne laid Monday but gained no insight into
a possible motive. How do you like that apple, saw? They're shooting the monks, which brings back great
memories of the monks in though. I'll tell you that was a great place. You never got to eat there,
huh? No, I never. Ah! Man was that good. That was back in the days when South Florida was worth
being in. Speaking of food, let me tell you about getting in shape for a summertime. Maybe you want
to go to the beach, put out a bathing suit. You certainly don't want to look like a beached whale.
The beast is lost 32 pounds on balance for life. This man is a shadow hoodie, any store fat tub.
But he's a shadow hoodie once was and we're going to get him on a road to like being healthy
and looking human, maybe you can get laid sometime before the year is out. Do you think so? Ah,
well, let's not get carried away. That'll be like saying we're going to get clearance laid
before the year is out. Anyway, the beast in a bathing suit, maybe that's coming to a beach near
you pretty soon. Watch out. Balance for life is the answer to losing that weight. It's a bitch. I
can tell you personally, losing weight. I mean, you try atkins and scatkins and this program and
that one balance for life is based on Dr. Barry Sears' The Zone diet, which is extraordinarily
complicated, but they take all the work out of it for you because they prepare all the meals.
The best ingredients that money can buy, three delicious or motley balanced gourmet meals, two
delicious snacks and little 60 Nautz bottle water in your little black sack, which they deliver to
you just about every day at six o'clock in the morning to homework where we might be. They insist
they deliver that one yesterday, but we doubt it. Anyway, if you want to get on a road to
losing some weight and don't forget they let you choose between two alternatives for each meal each
day or on a program. Get in shape for summer and the rest of your life studying right now with
balance for life. Like I said, the food is delicious and it really works. The weight comes pouring
off just like on the beast column today, nine five four five six eight thirty two twenty nine.
Talk to Troy. He's our boy nine five four five six eight thirty two twenty nine or check out their

Because he need our help.
I was never crazy about this song in the first place before they showed it again but now.
But now.
Thank you very much.
Oh here are some very bad news by the way.
From the Herald they leaves reject US proposal to beam radio marty signal.
Not a shame.
Are you kidding?
Belize may be tiny but it knows how to but it knows how to say to Washington.
Belize is flatly rejected a US proposal to convert a voice of America relay station to beam US
operated radio marty propaganda signal stored Cuba.
The denial has this made Cuban American supporters of the radio station.
New City Belize facility might have helped a radio marty side step efforts by Cuba to jam its signal.
They're jamming it.
And by the way special hello to all our listeners in Havana and also where do you think they can hear us in Cuba?
Absolutely.
We got a few hits on there when you look in the domain thing on our website.
We get a few not too many.
My family members recall when QAM would play music.
When is the uh let me go?
To how would Fidel?
But Belize a former British colony in Central America sought to avoid getting ensnared in US Cuba frictions.
It did not want to risk that Havana would retaliate by withdrawing more than 100 doctors and nurses.
It had sent to Belize.
We don't want to get involved said Vaughn Gillis spokesperson for the Belize government.
Belize has good relations with both Cuba and the US.
Good thinking Vaughn.
The US operates two AM radio transmitters near the town of Punda Gorda and the southern most part of Belize.
Punda Gorda?
Why should we be the only ones?
Yeah, some of the we stole fat.
We stole fat.
We stole that name to have it.
There's a two eggs someplace else also.
The transmitters send both English and Spanish voice america's broadcast throughout central America each evening.
As a sister facility in the voice of america,
Radio Marti was established in 1985 to offer an independent source of news and entertainment to Cubans.
Radio Marti is being toured Cuba on AM from marathon in the Keys and on shoreway from Greenville, North Carolina and Delano, California.
Delano, California?
Okay.
Okay.
I don't get it.
Maybe it's by way of China.
In late 2000 US officials began scouring the Caribbean looking for an alternative broadcast site
to send the signals of radio marty tour Cuba from a different latitude,
making it more difficult for a cubit of locket signals.
They went to the Turks in Kekos, they went to the Bahamas, and they went to the Cayman said one official
insisting on anonymity.
Then they noticed the Belize facility and quickly a lot of $750,000 in the 2002 fiscal year budget to enhance the site.
An appeal went out to Prime Minister Said Musa of Belize from permission to change the use of the facility.
No one seriously expected Belize, an unspoiled nation popular with US scuba divers,
and Mayan archaeology buffs to refuse.
But two months ago they did just that, setting tongues wagging around Capitol Hill
about how the Bush administration took it on the chin from Belize.
Oh, this is even more embarrassing than Las Melvinas, you know what?
Belize felt that it had too much to lose since 1999.
Belize had hosted an increasing number of Cuban physicians and nurses working in remote villages.
Gild, the government spokesman also noted that more than a 100 Belizean students
are in Cuba on full scholarship, some of them studying medicine.
As word arrived in Washington, the spring that Belize might turn down the US request,
the State Department sent two diplomatic notes to Belmopon, Belize's capital.
The second one was apparently sternly worded to the congressional staffer said,
and you know what? They still said, no.
How do you like that?
All right.
Let's hear it for the balls and Belize, baby.
Yeah.
Just say no to Uncle Sam.
Don't let him push you around.
Don't let them make you a pimple like the middleman, like we'd like to do everybody else,
like the forced and coerced them, make him not if they can't refuse to do our bidding.
And they just said, no.
Good for you.

A North Adams, Massachusetts man, says he told church officials he was molested by the Reverend Richard Levine, years beat that's with a G.
Richard Levine, years before the priest was charged with sexually abusing boys and removed from his duties by the ICC's of spring.
Springfield mass.
What are sure a lot of crap going on in mass intuitions, you know what?
Paul Bebo said he had a priest and none in his brother tell the late Bishop Leo O'Neal in 1986.
What? That sounds like the beginning of a joke.
A priest and none in his brother.
Are you making light of this?
Sorry.
You better ask the Lord for forgiveness, Mr.
You better start clenching and rosary beads real tight.
Domino for biscuits.
You better stick another extra wafer in your purse and have a couple extra glasses of wine just to be on the safe side.
Paul Bebo said he had a priest and none in his brother tell the late Bishop Leo O'Neal in 1986 that Levine molested him between the ages of 13 and 15.
Bebo was 17 at the time he'd be tellin' us.
Stenny, by Bebo at a news conference yesterday the Reverend Eugene Hohn and his sister Eunice Tassoni said they told O'Neal that Bebo reported abuse to them.
We were assured Levine would never contact with boys or be left alone with any children after that said by Bebo 33.
A former Berkshire County Commissioner ran unsuccessfully for North Adams Mayor last year.
But from 1986 to was arrest in 1991 we know Levine was abusing and raping other boys.
See, then this whole thing is so sad because these people should have been in jail.
It's not an internal question for these glium to decide, well, what should we do? Should we move them over here?
Should we restrict his contact with young boys?
It should report it to the authorities and put his ass in jail. That's what you should do.
That Bebo hasn't yet filed a lawsuit. He said he's speaking up because he thinks it'll help a greenfield man.
He says was Levine molested by Levine and is suing the diocese.
The man identified in court records only as John Doe says that diocese knew that Levine was abusing children and didn't stop him.
Those lawyers, John Stobersky filed a motion yesterday to get access to impounded records from the criminal prosecution of Levine.
Stobersky says these documents will show that the diocese was negligent.
In a prepared statement that diocese acknowledged that O'Neill received a report that Levine was molesting a teenager,
after a mental health evaluation of Levine, the diocese determined that the priest could continue his duties this statement said.
Can I read that sentence again?
After a mental health evaluation of Levine, the diocese determined that the priest could continue his duties.
Even though he was molesting a minor, the diocese was aware of no further complaints concerning whether Levine was arrested in 1991.
The statement said, Levine 61 pleaded guilty in 92 to indecency and suffered fondling to Walter Boyes.
He was sentenced to 10 years probation and psychiatric treatment. Church officials banned him from ever serving as a priest in the Springfield diocese.
In 1994, the diocese sent a lawsuit for $1.4 million with 17 alleged victims of Levine, including several from Springfield.
Makes you want a barf.
And this whole thing in Dallas starting Thursday, this dog and pony show that they're continuing,
a lot of stupid people out there are going to be convinced, oh look at their really putting their nose to the grinds down now.
They're really doing it.
All they're doing is trying to cover their ass because this whole scandal is bad for business.
Speaking of that, the appeal score justice was considering whether the transcripts of Cardinal Law and Bishop John McCormick's deposition should be released immediately took himself off the case yesterday.
Massachusetts appeal score Justin L. Dorford issued a two-perregraph order, recusing himself after a party whom he did not name, was represented in the case by Palmer and Dodge.
Dorford was a partner with the Boston firm from 1981 to 1990.
Dorford had given the art style sees a Boston and Loris were plaintiff seeking the public release of the transcripts until noon yesterday to file written arguments.
He's before the case to Chief Justice Christopher Armstrong for a further action.
It was not immediately clear what impact this would have on the release of the documents.
Law and McCormick, the law's former aide and out Bishop of New Hampshire, have sat for questioning under oath by Loris for a man who claims, retired priest Paul Shanley repeatedly repudied him as a child.
The lawsuit by the family of Gregory Ford claims Law failed to properly oversee priest in the Boston art stasis as we well know.
Shanley became a central figure in the ongoing scandal when Church documents showed he publicly advocated sexual relationships between end and boys.
Middle-sex cows superior court judge Raymond Brasard had ruled transcripts and videotapes of the deposition to be released as soon as they were registered with the court clerk because they were of legitimate public concern.
But the art stasis of P.L. saying it should have 30 days to examine the tapes and transcripts for errors before they made public.
In other words, try to figure out how to cover their ass.
The decision would have an impact on when the transcript of the future deposition of Bishop Thomas Daly is made public.
Daly was being deposed yesterday in a separate church abuse case bought by alleged victims of the frock priest John Gagan who has been accused of molesting 130 kids in a Boston art stasis.
He was scheduled to be questioned these Shanley case later this week.
Not looking too good you know what for anybody with a brain?
Of course I would like to say this anybody with a brain wouldn't still be involved with that organization in the first place or any of this organized religion crap.

You know, as soon as I started playing that I thought there we go.
Here's another one hit wonder.
Guess what?
Wrong.
I looked it up.
Good thing I got this book, you know, the billboard book.
Yep.
Bobby Fuller IV I fought the law reached number nine in 1966 but loves made a fool of you
1966 may have 66 written in 1958 by Buddy Holly by the way before he died.
Well, he could have written it after he died and like sent it from heaven.
He's up there looking down.
Why do people say stuff like that?
They're weak.
Oh, they're look, they're up there watching the game right now like they had Larry McCarty on
it right off in the red wings.
And he's talking about his father who died from cancer, you know, and his grandfather
and this was uncle and they're all dead.
Well, I'm sure they're up there watching the game up upstairs.
They're watching down.
You know, why do people talk such crap?
It's the same reason that people are still involved in all these goddamn religions.
It's the same reason they go to Miss Cleo.
It's the same reason that every time you have a psychic or a goddamn fortune teller on
here, the phones are just about blow out.
People are desperate to be conned.
That's why that Miss Cleo thing is a shame.
All these religious fakers are on there with the goddamn toll free numbers at the bottom of the screen
so they can rip off your money, take your credit card.
God, I'm sorry.
Oh, God.
When are people finally going to wise up?
Is it ever going to happen?
Oh, I don't think so.
Yeah, but that John Edward guy, he's for real.
Yeah, there's another one.
And the stupid women who watch that crap, they can't get enough of it.
I'm not so sure who's Dumber.
The people who watch that or the people who watch Oprah or the people who believe in fairy tales like Jesus Christ.
Things like that.
I think they're all the same people.
Yeah, probably right.
Body fuller for loves made a fool of you reach number 26.
So sorry, but nice try.
Now what's going on with our poll or something strange going on here, Eric?
I don't want to start picking on Eric, but this thing's been stuck on the same number of votes.
Yeah, it stuck at 276 for like the last 10 minutes.
Since he took off brandy, there's something that was are going on.
Don't tell me there's nobody else voting on this.
Which of these one hit wonders was bet soft sell tainted love 42 votes, which were very dubious about.
It could be number one though, you know?
Okay.
I said it could be.
It might miss a C.B. Queen 20.
Norman Greenbaum, Spirit of the Sky 18.
Steam, Nanai, Hey, Hey Kissing, Goodbye, Andy M.F. Unbelievable 15.
Zagrin Evans in the year 25, 25, 14.
Question Mark and Mathurians, 90 thick fear at that 13.
Blue's image, Rod Captain Ride, Taco putting on the Ritz and Paper Lace Nightshake, I would have had you to have 12.
After that, it's pretty far downhill.
Although Johnson Bastion, Mark of that Carter's got eight.
And you know something? White planes, my baby loves love and we change the name of that three times and still has no votes.
Oh, that's changing again. Maybe that'll help.
Yeah, let's make up another name for it.
Let's say it's by the Beatles.
I'm not buying those taco results either by the way.
Why not?
Because that's another crock.
I can't imagine anybody actually liking that.
See, this is the problem when we take a pool that's objective like this and you don't want to accept the, you know, the fact that a lot of people out there have got bad taste.
I mean, Norman Greenbaum in Spirit of the Sky, if that's in the same league with a lot of the other stuff like incense and peppermints by the strawberry alarm clock or Harsher Buy the Mystics,
which still has got only six votes.
Our Dean Taylor, Indiana wants me still stuck down here with three, with three freaking votes.
And let's see if this thing changed on there.
How many votes does it say on your screen?
276.
Yeah, it has just been loaded manually too.
It's been stuck on there for like 10 minutes, Eric.
And I know that there are other people voting on this thing.
Gotta be.
Something's very strange with our pool, okay?
We got a strange pool today.
1148 at 560 WQM Supreme Court shoots down gun appeals testing individual rights throwing firearms, bad news.
But what do you expect from those fascists on the bench anyway, huh?
The same people that gave you George W.
Oh, sorry, Robert.
What's on with the pool?
Yeah.
Yeah, exactly.
Never met a fascist he didn't like.
Maybe he knows some of the people in Sicilya, Scalilla.
The Supreme Court said Monday, well, not here two cases that would have offered a test of the Bush administration's newly articulated position, that the Constitution protects an individual's right to own guns.
Without comment, the court turned down two men convicted of violating federal gun laws.
The men had argued that the laws are unconstitutional because the Second Amendment gives Americans the right to keep and bear arms.
The cases marked the first time that the Bush administration had told a Supreme Court that has reversed a decades old policy on the Second Amendment.
Until now, the government has said the amendment protects a collective, not an individual, right to gun ownership, and the NRA is proud, baby.
They love it.
They're thrilled.
They got their hands in both of George's pockets.
The distinction is important because gun laws necessarily restrict individual rights.
The administration also said its new position is not undermined federal gun laws because the Second Amendment right is still subject to reasonable restrictions.
Using that rationale, the administration urged the High Court not to accept the appeals of Timothy, Joe Emerson, and John Lee Henley, both were properly convicted of violating laws the administration considers reasonable limitations of the gun rights solicitor general Ted Olson said.
The Second Amendment reads a well-regulated, well-we know what it says.
The Supreme Court interpreted that in 1939 as a protection of militia rights not of individual ones.
Decades of just a tabaran policy arrested on that which preceded most federal laws regulating who may own what type of gun.
The current position of the United States is that the Second Amendment more broadly protects the rights of individuals, including persons who are not members of any militia, or engaged in active military service or training to possess and bear their own firearms, Olson wrote in footnotes, attached to the filings in the Emerson and Henley cases.
That right, however, is subject to reasonable restrictions designed to prevent possession by unfit persons, or to restrict the possession of types of firearms that are particularly suited to criminal misuse Olson wrote last month.
Olson, the administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, was reflecting a view that Attorney General John Ascroft had voiced last year in a letter to the National Rifle Association.
The text and the original intent of the Second Amendment clearly protected the right of individual individuals to keep in bear arms Ascroft wrote then.
At the time Ascroft wrote the letter was unclear whether it was expressing his personal view, or stating a new policy position for the government.
That question was mostly answered last November when he sent letter to federal prosecutors, praising an appeal score to citizens that found the Second Amendment does protect individual rights, but noting that those rights could be subjected to limited nearly tailored specific exceptions.
That opinion by the 50 West Circuit Court of Appeals went on to reject arguments from Emerson and Texas Physician that in 1994, Federal Gun Law was unconstitutional, the law was intended to deny guns to people under judicial restraining orders.
In my view of the Emerson opinion and the balance that strikes, generally reflect the correct understanding of the Second Amendment Ascroft told prosecutors, the appeals put the Justice Department in an awkward position.
Although the government won both cases in lower courts using the old interpretation of the Second Amendment, Ascroft had switched gears by the time the appeals reached the high court.
Well, they better check with the NRA and make sure it's AOK.
OK? Like those things would say?
OK.
OK.
Now, how does that think of it as it's still stuck?
I'm reloading.
Oh, it finally moved.
So, yeah, there was something stuck on there.
Stuck in the middle with you.
Steelers wheel.
Yeah. Great.
Did we say that that qualifies?
You have to look that up.
Let's feel you hit that I know of, of theirs.
Well, I have to put that on.
The next time we do this, which I think will be a long ways down there.
I don't know.
How do I know?
I'm throwing away, uh, faxes of things that we already know about.
People's suggestions that we already know about.
They're already different.
So, now that we're getting your response on this?
Yeah, a little bit.
Or that they don't qualify like BJ Thomas.
I'm sure had more than one.
BJ Thomas, are you people crazy?
BJ Thomas had a crap load of hits.
Hooked on a feeling.
Rock and roll low.
Oh, by.
Ah, brain drops keep falling.
That's the only thing that's the only thing that's the only thing.
Brain drops keep falling on my thing.
He had a Schmidt load of hits.
BJ Thomas.
Steelers wheel had star.
Sorry.
Stuck in the middle with you and star.
Don't you remember star?
No.
Why do?
I don't know how it goes, but I remember it vaguely.
Just to show you, who faxed that?
That doesn't have a name.
I want to trace that fax and get that person and just knock a little sound.
God, they were the two by four.
Hey, Scott.
Get one that's Scott.
You're probably a pretty good guy, Scott.
Send some pictures.
But Jesus Christ.
God is that fast, my ass, when we get something stupid like that.
Jesus Christ.
I'm so low to my good cry.
Mama, Billy and Sue.
The eyes of a New York woman.
Hooked on a feeling.
Rain drops keep falling on my head, which is number one for four weeks.
Everybody's out of town.
I just can't help believing.
Most of all, no love at all.
Mighty clouds of joy, which wasn't a big hit, but probably the best record you ever made.
You remember that?
Yes.
Rock and roll Lullaby, which in for my money is the second best song you ever did.
Hey, won't you play another somebody done somebody wrong song?
Of course.
Which also reach number one.
And don't worry, baby.
A remake of the Beach Bull.
Oh, I had to play that.
I'm going to tell you something, folks.
BJ Thomas, who was raised in Rosenberg, Texas, all the way is not Jewish.
Is great.
One of the greatest voices in the history of rock and roll.
Is there any question about that?
And the question again, Christian, now you know.
I don't care about that.
He can believe whatever he tells he wants.
No, he has a great voice.
I agree.
But he's a...
BJ Thomas is great.
And he probably had to become a born again Christian because all those people can't imagine what the BJ stands for.
But he's...
God, I mean, Scott, get serious.
Although you know something, these books are pretty damn expensive.
I mean, that's the only way you're really going to know all the BJ Thomas you shouldn't own, Scott.
Well, you just first have my experience about BJ Thomas's every time he's go to the record store and you see BJ Thomas's greatest hits all over the place.
In the display rack.
Yeah, there are not too many CDs out there with so-and-so's greatest hit.
Oh, here's Lauren, who's also a chronic factor.
She says, I don't know if it's on a current list of one.
It wonders and nominate the next time.
The boys are back in town by Tin Lazy.
That's a good one.
Yeah, Tin Lazy.
Did I say Tin Lazy?
You just says Tin Lazy or Tin Lazy, whatever the real name is.
My favorite line in the song is if that chick don't want to know, forget her.
Well, that's good.
The boys are back in town.
They play that a lot at the Ahaki Games here in Toronto.
Don't ask me why.
Well, it's better than that stupid stop in titles.
I don't think they're one hit wonder.
They're not.
Tin Lazy, they had jailbreak.
Ah, Jesus.
That's a very good...
There we go.
You know, this book weighs about 400 pounds.
I hate to break the news to you.
This is a heavy-duty book that costs $38.95 Canadian A,
which is about $25 US.
This is the top 40 billboard book.
Now, what is it I'm looking for?
Tin Lazy.
Oh, 38 Spacals.
There's jailbreak.
Well, guess what?
Didn't make the charts.
Uh-oh.
He gave us that big dramatic thing there and you're wrong.
What's funny?
The Bokobrine emailed me that one.
But not that one.
The Bokobrine's book.
The Crab.
The boys are back in town, reached number 12 in 1976.
Rock Group from Dublin, Ireland, Tin Lazy.
Phil Lennart, Focals and Bass, Brian Robertson, and Scott Gorham, the guitars,
and Brian Downey on the drums law died in 86 at the age of only 34.
And we're not going to speculate as to why.
So, I do like that, huh?
Mr. Houchot.
There were one.
So, might make an order that.
Okay.
Can I get to this one quick thing before we do the break?
Moroccan Police have dismantled a terrorist cell with links to Osama Yomamabin-Laden-Zelkite
and Eberk, arresting three Saudi nationals.
He government officials said yesterday.
The three men were planning suicide operations against the American and British warships,
patrolling the straight edge of your border, the Moroccan officials said on condition of anonymity.
The names of the suspects who arrested and may were not released.
The arrest were made with the help of intelligent services of several friendly countries,
one of the officials told the AP.
It's the first confirmation of a crackdown in Morocco since the US and its allies launched
the military campaign in Afghanistan to destroy Al Qaeda.
In October 2002, suicide bombers in a small dinghy, rammed the USS Coldest Dwarren
and a port in Yemen blasting a hole on its side as we know killing 17 sailors.
Okay, there you go.
Oh, it also says in the last sentence, I guess I shouldn't throw it on.
If Al Qaeda operatives are confirmed to be behind the attack with Mark III's terrorist groups,
first known successful operation outside the war zone in Central Asia since 9-11.
We just mentioned that in passing.
So, Thin Lizzy qualifies, make sure we keep that on the list,
along with Tepau and all of us.
And BJ Tom is, I'm distraught.
And you know what I'm going to do, I'm going to go out and buy me a BJ Tom of CD today.
All right.
Just to show Scott a thing or two, okay about music.

Come on one at 560, WQM, it's a big new one.
Now we've got the Mad Dog Gym Manusus back today between the one and three.
We got Hank in studio three o'clock.
You know I heard somebody yesterday talking to Hank about the Belmont.
Or no, Hank was talking about Andy Byer who of course is considered the greatest Thirbert handicap in all of the country.
And they have the buyer ratings, the speed ratings etc.
And so on, he's written many books on Thirbert raising and handicrapping.
But for Andy Byer or anybody to question that War Amblem lost all chance to win when he stumbled out of the gate and nearly fell down on his ass right on his nose.
I've been getting to wonder if Andy Byer ain't doing like magic mushrooms or something like that.
Just like the Humphrey said once that, that was it, that was the end.
Anybody who knows even just a teeny tiny little bit about horse racing.
But anyway.
So this Faxor who was doing about Tin Lazy and Tin Lazy and the boys are back in the glamour back in town.
It says to Powell, head Vulcan female ruler on Star Trek.
She made Spock Fight Kirk to the death when Spock needed to get laid or risk dying from green balls on his home planet.
I don't know if you could die from green balls.
Oh, if you haven't really died.
Spock's, how about Blue Balls?
Spock's woman had eyes for Kirk and this fight would determine who would get her.
Bones dragged Kirk so he'd appear to die during battle later on when he's Spock saw Kirk was alive on the Enterprise.
He smiled for the only time ever on the show.
How do you like that?
I'll start direct trivia for you.
God is that boring stuff, you know?
Yeah.
Like Bill Shattonor said, get a life.
But thanks for the great facts.
Paul says, you know what Americans want?
What do Americans want?
Not money.
Not getting laid.
Four and five Americans would give up some freedoms to gain security.
That's what they want.
Security.
They want to be safe.
Maybe we can all get together and eat it loose and the Bronx will be safe.
And four and ten worry terrorists will harm them or their family in New Gala poll shows.
Four and ten worry the terrorists.
See, this is the new deal now since they got caught with their pants down.
Since all the whistleblowers came out of the closet.
We got scuba divers are going to get us.
And we got the dirty bomb and the clean bomb and the neutron bomb and the big bomb.
Yeah.
Can everybody know a panic?
And then of course we got those brilliant statements from people like Robert Mueller who keeps saying,
well, it's not a question of if it's just a question of one and there will be another attack.
And it will be a nuclear attack.
It could be in ten minutes.
It could be in ten years.
It could be in a hundred years.
Well, I mean, talk about covering your ass.
This guy's even covered his ass for like long before he's pushing up daisies.
Is that incredible or what?
It's very credible.
About a third of those poll favor making it easier for authorities to access private email and telephone conversations.
More than 70% are now in favor of requiring U.S. citizens to carry ID cards with fingerprints.
And 77% believe all Americans should have smallpox vaccinations.
I hate to break the news to you though, but if you go on the internet and find out that there's some very bad side effects from the current smallpox vaccine.
I just mentioned that before you get whipped up into a frenzy.
What a bunch of goose steppers the public is, you know.
It was amazing the percentage of people who were willing to give up freedom to get back some sense of personal security,
steady lane Christians and senior research director for the Gallup organization.
These aren't people who were necessarily near the twin towers, near the Pentagon, near the Maraud building.
These are just average people.
The telephone survey conducted in March included 934...
To compare results with the general population survey.
The poll showed 8% of Americans are very worried and 31% are somewhat worried that they or someone in their family would become victims of a terrorist attack in the U.S.
In New York City the level of worry is higher.
19% said they're very worried and 34% said there's their somewhat worried.
Washington DC and Oklahoma City reported levels of fear close to national average.
Scientists involved in the poll said they were not surprised many Americans remained fearful after September 11th.
The magnitude of the event was just so profound that Carol Northay, South Ketrick professor at Washington University in St. Louis,
who said talking to the war in Afghanistan, airline security and terrorist threats is propelling the fear.
And you know who's doing the propelling?
I give up.
The media?
Yeah, there you go.
The media?
Just thick and they talk bad.
Yeah, I was going to give you like a little clue there from good old Tammy Faye.
And I hope Carlos has a wonderful life with Tammy Faye.
I hope they all love together.
Birds of a feather on and speaking of that.
This next story from the Boston hero.
Save Boy's life since parents died food.
Say it again.
Cult and aunt.
Okay.
And when you look at that you see all the letters are written there.
You see what I'm saying?
Yeah.
C'mon.
Say that for your show.
Okay, we're not going to do gratuitous filth on this show because of the fact that you know you're just a pervert.
We're not going to do that.
What was it?
Content massed in eternal ant of a baby boy who started that because of her religious parents will not feed him solid food.
Testified yesterday that she pleaded with a child's father resumed feeding him.
Remember this story?
Uh-huh.
Only days ago it made me sick.
Well, I'm like even sicker.
Renee Horton said her brother-in-law, Jacques Robodo, defended the decision to feed a baby exclusively from his mother's breast by saying,
this is from God.
This is what we have to do and we have to have faith.
Like I told you, the religious people are the crazy people.
Like that.
I've carried was pregnant unable to produce milk for her son and Jacques Robodo 29 is on trial for first degree murder for letting the 11th month old boy starve over two month period.
Samuel Robodo and another second child who was still born eventually were on earth from a makeshift grave in Back to State Park in Maine.
Karen Robodo faces a second of a murder charge in upcoming trial.
In April 99 after Samuel had become so weak he could barely move.
His mother called a prayer meeting of the separatist religious sect based in Seaconc.
Karen wanted to pray for Samuel as a group persistent.
And they also remember the sect testified in Bristol Superior Court.
The morning after the prayer session, Jacques Robodo announced to the group that Samuel is sleeping with God according to the testimony of Renee Horton's husband, Daniel, who was also member of the sect.
About a month earlier, Daniel Horton testified.
Jacques Robodo had heard a radio news report about a New York woman whose baby died while eating nothing but breast milk.
Horton said Robodo considered the news report intent by Satan.
Force sterilization.
I know that Samuel was not going to die.
Horton said Jacques Robodo told him at the time.
Well, guess what?
Wrong.
As he ascents the trial began a week ago, defense attorney Francis O'Boy crossed exam with the witnesses to emphasize his contention that his client was being manipulated by sect founder Roland Robodo Jacques's father.
The other Robodo ostracized the group members almost all of whom were his own extended family if they ignored the teachings or leadings from God according to witnesses.
Like that crazy.
In this case, Jacques Robodo's sister Michelle Mingo had claimed that God told her in late February of 99 that Samuel should take nourishment only from his mother.
When Karen Robodo initially bought the changing her healthy son's diet, Jacques told her if someone has a leading, we have to take it as if the apostle Paul had said it.
And we have to...
Yeah, that's why.
Because he's just playing stupid, like all the religious nuts.
Shortly after the death Daniel Horton and his wife and children left the sect, although they clearly felt that what had happened to Samuel was wrong, the Horton still were told by the decision to leave the group.
Roland considered the group to be God's camphorton said the attitude of the group was if you left your leaving God.
How do you like that, huh?
Like I said, the religious people are the crazy people speaking of the Horton's, by the way, from days of our lives.
Yeah.
All you guiding light people are two of you that we have left in the audience. You know great, we got the not the original Ed Bar, but the last Ed Bar, finally came back from Africa and Mindy and Wusty and all the other goyem came back for the big Riva and Riva and what's his name?
Josh's 85th time they got married.
But there's trouble in paradise. I'll tell you that right now because at the end of the show yesterday, all of you is up to World Tricks and the lights go out.
Didn't pretty heavy duty and now and now here's a.
A big deal with the multi billionaire who now of course is in hell or somewhere, but he's running around with like a little nap sack on his back along with Timmy and his nap sack and little total.

Speaking of depressing stories, Griffin, Joja, a Georgia woman's accused of fatally shooting her two middle-aged son, Saturday night at a small town nursing home.
Carol Carr, 63 who faces double murder charges, was a frequent visitor to Sunbridge, Karen rehab center and Griffin, where son's Michael Randy Scott 42, an Andy Byron Scott 41, lived for the past four months, Griffin, Pulley, Sergeant James Landham said.
Both suffered from an undisclosed long-term degenerative disease, Landham said, Carr of nearby Hampton shot them in with a small caliber handgun, shortly after 9 p.m. Landham said.
Arrested by the officer responding to the call, the mother said she shot her son because she didn't want them to suffer anymore, police said.
She went freely and voluntarily with the police when he arrived, didn't show any violence to anybody else.
Landham, with an hour of each other.
Grief counselors were on hand over the weekend to work with patients, their families and employees, nursing home administrators, Chuck Brown said.
Right now we're just concerned with helping our residents get over this and working with our employees, he said.
How do you like that? She put them out of their sufferings, how their pain and misery.
A lot of people would like to put some of their siblings out of their misery. Right George?
I love all my siblings.
By do?
How about your mother?
Oh her. Well I'm talking about the things that are out of our misery, all of our siblings.

Knows that losing a loved pet can be rough.
Now John is reaching out to your dearly departed pooches in crossing rover.
Okay, I'm seeing a... a door.
Yes, yes, it's some kind of a home.
There's a portal. Yeah, a portal house.
That's amazing.
Crossing over.
If a pet has passed, John Edward will make contact.
Okay, I'm getting a vision. I see a blank white white.
He's white. He's white.
He's white. Yes, yes. She's a white.
Joe.
Terrier. Yes.
As she wants you to know, everything's okay.
Oh.
She's in heaven now and drinking out of same penis oil.
Oh, my feet.
Crossing over.
The John Edward.
Now your dead pets are just a phony, psychic away.
Hey, we got some good news for you.
I pulled today.
We got a whole bunch of one-hit wonders on air.
And this is the first of several polls we're going to do on this.
Like about 6,000.
Oh, the Joe Jeffrey group, my pledge of love.
Oh, write that down, please.
I don't remember the Joe Jeffrey group.
My, this is my pledge of love to you.
What year was that? 50 something?
Born in Buffalo, New York.
Joe Jeffrey, R&B singer and guitarist.
My pledge of love was up to number 14, but that was big.
It was on the charts eight weeks.
You'd recognize it if you heard it.
You might mark that down for one day next time.
My pledge of love.
Yeah.
Joe Jeffrey.
My baby loves love, and which we find it got the name right.
Gotta vote.
I've got one white plan.
Oh, I don't want to get too carried away, but it got one.
It's got as many as human beings and alive and kicking.
Speaking of alive and kicking,
Jail X school teacher Mary Kay LaTournault
has now said to Mary the student she first had sex with
when she was just 12 years old.
When he was just 12 years old.
Let's hear it.
Incubate.
Vili Fula.
How do you pronounce this?
Fulao.
Is that it?
That's what they kept saying during the trial.
F-U-A-L-A-U.
God, there's a lot of letters in there, A.
L.
Off a lot of vowels in there, A.
Vili Fulao, who fathered two girls with an out 40-year-old
boundary in the course of their illicit affair,
has turned 18 and I want to marry this scandal-tart beauty insider.
Say, yeah, beauty.
Why do they do that?
Duty rhymes with duty, which is just what she looks like.
They're very much in love reveals a pal of Mary Kay.
She's never wavered about wanting to marry Vili,
and now he's decided that she's the only woman for him,
probably the only woman that would touch him.
Man, is he grotesque or what?
Yes, quite.
It could be a mid-summer jailhouse wedding,
and they plan to make a video of the ceremony
in seller-world wide, and probably a bunch of suckers out there.
They'll buy it.
Probably even some of you would buy it.
But before the odd couple can tie the knot,
Vili has to petition a judge for permission.
Mary Kay is currently serving a seven-and-a-half year sentence
in the women's-day prison at Pretty Washington.
When she was a 34-year-old teacher in a mama-four children
with then-hubby Steve.
The judge banned her from seeing her boy lover for life,
but Vili is now an adult, could ask for that ruling to be overturned,
explained Seattle Attorney Ann Bremner,
who's a friend of the jail teacher.
It probably would be because there's legal precedent.
A male teacher was jailed in Washington state
for having sex with a female student was allowed to marry her
and was released from prison.
That's a bright ray of hope for Mary Kay, they say.
Ironically, Vili and his mom, Suna,
lost a lawsuit made 20th in which they accused the Highline School District
in Kent, Washington of failing to protect him
from sexual abuse at the hands of Mary Kay.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Man, not that we got too many crank lawyers out there
filing all kinds of wild lawsuits.
They lost the lawsuit made 20th when he accused the school...
At the trial, he testified,
I loved her at least.
I thought I loved her, but now he's changed his tunes, say,
sources and is determined to marry the bitch, Mary Her.
One cloud in the outcouples future is Mary Kay's health.
She has a job in the prison library, works on art projects,
and is kept in the prison volleyball team,
but she's also undergoing test to see if she's got cancer,
says the rest has been Steve.
Still, all the Shameless School teacher can talk about
his marrying Vili, and after her release moving with him
and their kids Audrey 5 and Lexus 3, their friends are Hawaii.
She's already planning her wedding dress as the pal.
She's told friends she can't wait to walk to the altar
even in the prison chapel.
Why see he's Hawaiian, huh? That's why he's got all his age in his name.
Now, I've been in Hawaii many, many times, and I got this word.
The only really grotesque people there
like the sumo wrestler kind of guy, you know what I'm talking about?
Right. The big fat tubs, but I guess he's one of them without the body.
You know what I'm all the fat? Give me time.
He's got...
This may look like Robbie Benson.
I'll speak in a billy old-debili Joe Bobby Gentry.
Now, did we decide she had another head?
You had to look it up.
Oh!
I'm telling you, man, I'm getting the hernia.
I'm filing a lawsuit against Billboard for making such a heavy book.
Bobby Gentry, not a night, wasn't I playing that this morning?
You were?
Oh, right now that I have that.
You got me?
Well, what do you mean I got you?
I don't know what you had it from.
We have some interlude music though.
Well, guess what? It doesn't qualify anyway.
Oh, bandit gold, feeder pain.
Excellent. And that on our thing today, probably not doing all that well.
Good song.
Now, what am I looking for? The old-debili Joe?
I'm probably just as well if I don't find it.
Oh, I guess what?
It's right before Runaway 67 by Del Shannon.
I think it was just after that that he blew his brains up.
After he recorded that piece of crap.
About Runaway 67, he came to anything else right?
And he said, that's a good idea.
Hey, Robbie.
Robbie just done it with some old guy.
Was a third of June another sleepy, dusty, day out today.
Don't drop Robbie or a young man.
You got your whole life ahead.
I was out chopping cotton in my brother.
So how many times do we have to hear that is a grandfather was the first rabbi in the state of Texas?
Isn't that getting a little bit old?
I didn't know that.
Well, you just learned that.
More very startling information on the New York Times show.
Well, that's because you're anti-Semitic.
Oh.
Bobby Gentry, Odebili Joe was number one for four weeks in August of 67.
Then she also had let it be me with Glenn Campbell.
Fancy.
I remember Fancy.
And then all I have to do is dream which he sang with Glenn Campbell and ripped off the Everly Brothers.
And we're still ever forgiven for that.
That freaking bitch.
I was bailin' hey.
Get outta here, Bobby.
Go back and jump off the bridge with Robbie.
Robbie Benson to just turn 92, I should point out.
How old do you think he is?
He's got to be 45.
At least.
Is that you?
And he knows something the sad part of it is he probably still looks the same.
He does.
He's one of those people who never broke out of his childhood and always he always looked the same.
Which is probably why I couldn't get like any serious roles.
Remember you played the rabbi's kid or something like that in one movie?
I saw that movie.
The baseball one, the one that starts out there playing stick ball or something like that.
I don't know, I didn't see it.
And then he was in a movie with a monkey.
And he was in that basketball movie one on one.
That was pretty good movie.
I mean, you know.
Huh?
You didn't see one on one?
No, I'm talking about the one with a monkey.
Where he told you your coach to stick it with a red hot poker to stick it like up his...
RECOM.
Ask.
Speaking of John Gotti and somebody should tell the examineries that I realized I clipped his up before he died.
But you know, considering they have all those psychics in the tabloids,
wouldn't you think they would know ahead of time?
That he was going to die yesterday?
I sure knew it.
Blog got that inspiration to read that Gotti's story almost...
Almost a minute that he died.
Do you get it?
Ten minutes later.
Probably took...
It took ten minutes for the psychic...
...to show today.
Okay.
I'm serious.
I'll back.
No, no, no.
I don't wish any ill health on anybody in the world.
But in this case, I'll make an exception.
Just like Michael and the Godfather.
Just this one time, I'll make an exception.
And the reason being, not that we...
I didn't hate people who are not before yesterday, but now we find out...
You're last name.
Got fired by people who are over there, I.O.D. and I.N.Z.
Phil Latsman, who's kind of like an innocuous guy.
He knows a little bit about sports.
He never stole a freight train.
He's not a troublemaker.
He's a pretty decent guy.
You're last name.
And he gets stabbed in a back by people who are the assassin over there at Cheap Channel.
So, before the end of the show today, we're going to put a goddamn voodoo hex of curse...
on Pete Borgher.
Because if he gets struck by a bolt of lightning,
if he should drive off the edge of the etsylphore to expressway and detroit,
if somebody should run him over across in the street, then...
Then I'll say,
All right!
Anyway, getting back to the mob.
Uncle Vito needs you, and now more than ever, another John Gotti's dead.
Help wanted.
Can you shoot a bullet in the back of somebody's head?
Can you run gambling in a storsion operations?
Are you good at blackmail and driving and get away car?
Can you cram a zonny into your mouth and say,
Forget about it at the same time?
If your answers are yes, then here's a job for you.
The mob is looking for a few bad men to take over for dead and...
If he...
I think I probably will do it since it's my goddamn show.
I think that's what I'll do.
I don't want to rush through it.
Because we savor every little tidbit, everything about the mob.
We love the mob on this show, don't we?
I have to do a escalfonantial group at 1-800-94053-63.
That's 1-800-94053-63.
To be more specific, you can get 100 grand with payments of only...
Come on, Jackson, we win on all the action.
We are worldwide leader in sports.
Sports Radio 560-EU-A-M.
Gotta keep your shots straight here.
With his trusty card, Eka, took shots of Eriola.
He compared their nipple size, but he messed up no surprise.
What a big bonehead!
Colped out with his camera, said he had shots of...
And a buddy must have smoked some tubes.
They were someone else's boobs.
This guy is a major tool.
At first he thought it was to...
Never check the lady's face.
That's why he's in this card case.
He's a freaking fool.
A quack.
They should take his camera back.
None of this makes any sense.
What's with the nipple?
The fence.
It's a freaking crock.
Please, please, please, I bought it with the tennis girl.
I started laying there on the beach and I said,
That's crazy, I'm gonna come with boobs.
It's Call of Duty!
Hope they make him pay millions.
Cause he shot the wrong melons.
And approved that they were hers.
They were banning ten knockers.
What a big bonehead.
Okay, gotta look in a book here for a million different things though.
They're coming on the facts.
Did he just all start coming in like recently or what?
Like I said, I was sorting out the ones that we already had.
Okay, Brownsville station smoking in the boys room.
Which we also talked about off the year before the show.
But guess what?
It's...
Sorry, Frank.
Right.
Some of the kings of the party reached number 31, so they had another hit.
Sorry.
Electrocavenu by Eddie Grant.
You remember that?
Yeah, I was on MTV for a while.
Rage sounding kind of.
Oh.
Well, let me see.
Here's Amy Grant.
Here's Earl Grant.
Here's Eddie Grant.
And guess what?
Remanting the stone.
Oh, yeah, from the movie.
Like my mother said, what's that movie all about?
She got very upset with you.
You heard the name of that movie?
Well, you can only use your own.
And you see, you're supposed to be a pervert.
And I'm of course a sub pro claim pervert.
And yet she hears the name of a movie.
Remanting the stone.
And right away, she's there.
Oh, what's that about?
It is.
Her mind is filthier than both of us.
Yeah, that's right.
She's got a filthy mind, ma.
Electric Avenue was number two for five weeks by Eddie Grant.
But he don't make the, uh, okay.
Here's one that does make it.
Tom Cochrane life is a highway.
Remember that?
Yeah, and I'm writing it.
Well, I looked it up already.
That was a medley of a smash.
Tom Cochrane.
How you spell that?
CoCHRANE.
Okay.
Similar to, but not a match with the Johnny Cochrane.
It says, can you tell me the name of the Billboard One hit wonderboard?
Well, I don't have the one hit wonder book.
I mean, I'm reading from the Billboard The Top 40 hits book, which is a big fat thick.
It's big and it's fat and it's thick and a book to over 800 pages.
But there is, in fact, if you go to that website, what is it, the website that Eric was touting?
That he finally found out.
Now you ask me.
Huh?
I just, I just had it up there on the website too.
Well, go to the Hig and Wonders.
One hit wonder central dot com.
All one word.
No, as a matter of fact, just do a search for one hit wonders.
And on there, one of the things that'll come up is the Billboard The Book.
You can order it right off of there from Amazon or just just go to Amazon dot com if you want.
Either way.
And you can order the book because I can't find it myself and a book either.
And let's see, as this go Red Wing kicks her hurricane asses, that's right.
Get it over with already on Thursday and how come they got two days off for the TV networks again?
Jesus Christ.
Get it over with as much as I'm a hockey fan and I love it.
First of all, Carolina makes me ill.
Not just because they beat the leaps because they're boring.
They're coma inducing.
They've been and even though the ratings are up both in the US and in Canada, they don't ask me why
because they've played some of the most terminal hockey I've seen in my life.
All those one nothing and two to one and, oh, God.
Any real fan wants to see some goal scored, God damn it.
Not this ponderous clutch and grab and trap crap.
Anyway, get it over with.
Please Thursday.
Detroit.
Thank you.
Let's see Mississippi queen by mountain.
Ah, here we go again.
Just when I put the book down, I got to pick it up again.
I feel like I'd email Pacino.
They insist these nuts, not a one-hit wonder mountain and Mississippi queen because of this
and because of that.
So let me look it up, okay?
Do we agree we'll buy by whatever it says in the book?
Whatever it says in the book.
Mountain.
Mississippi queen.
They're only hit.
Oh, I didn't know this.
Felix Papalardi played guitar with a member of the group and then of course went on to be with the wrestlers.
Did you know he was shot to death on 417, 1983 at the age of 44?
No, I never knew that.
Oh, my God.
Felix Papalardi, the young rascals.
I don't think I'm ever going to be the same again.
It says it's not really one-hit wonder the group with guitarist, Leslie Weston, keyboard man.
Felix Papalardi had many classics.
For example, Yazger's Farm Woodstock, Boys in the Band, Nantucket Slay Ride, Papalardi Road
dozens of classics with the rascals.
Leslie Weston was one of the great guitars to the era.
Well, let's see.
Glitter Rhyme, where am I?
Male Hard Rock group in New York City, Leslie West, Vocals in Bays, Felix Papalardi guitar, Steve Knight keyboards, and Korky Lane drums.
Papalardi was shot to the Vagor City III.
But that was their only hit Mississippi queen.
So we stand by it, okay?
For once we got it right.
Just this one time we got it right.
Here's another one, Starlight Express, afternoon delight.
Oh, boy.
Yeah, exactly. That's my feelings.
But I'll look it up.
I think it qualifies that.
Now you would imagine so after you remember that piece of, I mean, Brenda K. Starr is the one star, buddy, Starrcher.
Here's one for you that I find by accident.
Yeah.
Starland Vocal Band afternoon delight.
They have the wrong name of the group.
It's not Starlight Express. It's the Starland Vocal Band.
Oh, they do have Starlight Express on this.
Yeah, hey Joel, you know, you're like partly right.
You're like better, you know, I mean, get with it, Joel.
What about that brother's Johnson?
Probably pretty big.
I thought they had other songs than that.
Hey, I'm busy cleaning my foot up.
You know what I just did?
You ever cut your ankle with like the sharp nail of a toe?
Not with my toe. No.
Other things.
Sharp other things.
Are you bleeding all over the, just like, no, not all over the places a little bit.
I'm just doing a little clean up job down there.
Okay, just relax. It's not a big deal.
Not signed as well.
Well, you know, anyway, Starland Vocal Band afternoon delight was number one for two weeks.
That was the medley of their smash pop group form to Washington DC.
Bill and wife Taffy Danoff, John Carroll and future wife, Margot Chapman.
Bill and Taffy at front of the Folk quintet, Fat City, back in Denver, our Technicom Country Road,
hosted their own TV variety series in 1977.
Well, the 1976 Best New Artists Grammy Award afternoon delight number one for two weeks in 1976.
Hate it.
And now we got to look up the brothers Johnson.
I don't want to see the brothers Johnson just a thought of it.
Here you go. No, they got all they had stomped and so I brought 23 and get the funk out of my face.
And I'll be good to you. That's funk with an end, by the way, just in case face.
So thank you very much.
Can I get back to my story about the mob wants you because probably a lot of people out there.
If they're not going to call fast, maybe they'd call the mob.
Experts say ranks of New York's five organized crime plans have dropped from 634 soldiers to mere 570 full-time gumbas.
Mob bosses like John Gagati are in the big house. It says, guess what?
Dead.
While others have turned into songbirds for the feds, not to mention those who've gone to the big crime cloud in the sky.
And something's got to be done. You have to inject blood into the family says a source.
Inside us say two of the top clans, the Genevase and Lucaisy folks, have officially opened the books hoping to induct new members.
You can also apply to the Columbus who lost 26 good fellows in recent years or the bananas who've seen five of their guys, made guys go missing.
The de Cavalentes, the New Jersey based group of no good nicks on which they're based, they based the sopranos, already are on a recruiting drive that's added eight new hoods to their books.
But they still need more help to carry out their notorious enterprises. That's why they're putting the word out on the street.
How do you apply wonder?
Facts of Resonay.
It's not easy to become a good fellow, though. First your name has to be circulated around through the bosses and then may take a little while considering a lot of them are doing time in the pen.
If you get the okay from underworld mob figures, you have to go through official initiation process and we're not taking talking secret handshake here.
The ceremony includes burning a saint's picture in the bleeding palm of an inductee as he takes the oath of Omar Ta, a found-ever in the divulge he tells the family's business.
Because if you do, you'll be sleeping with the fishes. There's no buyout package or 401k plan in this biz.
And don't forget a nickname if you're an accountant whose real man, a man, a career is William Nelson, forget about it. On your mob application, try something like William the Crunchy Nelson. Maybe then you'll see any change.
Love those nicknames.
Oh, here's some good news finally.
Two pieces of good news while we head to bad news about radio marty. Here's some good news.
Miami Beach will land with reputations the capital of the Latin music industry this fall when South Beach, South Beach based MTV Latino America premieres the MTV Music Video Music Awards Latino America Jackie Gleason Theater.
All right, a Spanish language version of the parents, a network's popular and transcending MTV Video Music Awards. The show will reflect the growing popularity of Latin rock and pop.
Approximately 80% of the word categories will feature Latin American artists who make up three-fisted performers.
The live broadcast of the October 24th award show will be available in 12 million households in Latin America and made available to MTV's other neighbors in the US, Europe and Asia, which will have a worldwide reach of 3.2 million homes.
What's the date for that? October 24th. I'll be back in South Florida. Maybe we can go there. Well, you can take my ticket. Okay.
MTV Latin American president Antoinette Zell said the industry, oh, I'm by the way, congratulations to Ann Rique. He finally said, you know, he finally figured it out like Brittany.
He's doing a Brittany thing now. Forget about singing anymore. He just selling sex. That's all selling his body. I think they have a word for that.
MTV Latin American president Antoinette Zell said the industry, synergy and civic support in South Beach where the channel has been based in launching in 1993, made an ideal spot to kick off the show.
There's so much talent and labels are here. She said, and the city's really been fabulous since our inception from finding us real estate, helping us with the show.
As with the US MTV music awards, most windows will be determined by votes from viewers. Charlie Singer, the shows executive producer, said nominees, performers and awards categories will be announced in the next few weeks.
Miami Beach Mayor David Dürmer said the MTV event is an important addition to the city's reputation and economy.
There are some, this is basically solidifying the fact that Miami Beach is the entertainment capital of the Americas and the center of Latin American music industry. Dürmer said it's probably the single largest music event ever to be broadcast from the city.
The special events give us recognition that advertising can never buy. I keep hearing it, South Beach is on a way out. You hear that? All the time. Everybody's selling out, everybody's moving out.
I just mentioned that so that what's your name can, you know, Barbara Kavitman can spin around or grave a little bit. Now we didn't need gambling, Barbara, we got art's record, baby.

Power demon and steam Gold Eagle steam with morning through 69 and sports radio 560 2 a.m. Oh my God.
Cup 46 at 560 WQ a mad dog back today after Joe Rosas in yesterday stealing our program logs.
Here's a fact that says and you know it's amazing how you know granted we make plenty of mistakes and will be the first ones to tell you when we screw up which we do a lot but this one says alive and kicking is Tommy James. Well guess what?
Tommy James and nothing to it alive and kicking pop rock group from New York City Peppy Cardona male vocals Sandy Toto female vocals John Perizio guitar Bruce Sedano organ Thomas Wilson bass and Vito Albano.
This sounds like a new mob family don't it? Vito Albano drums Sedano later married Donna Summer and was a member of Brooklyn Dreams.
But alive and kicking and tighter and tighter which reached number 7 and 1970 that was a medley of this match Tommy James had nothing to do with that.
What does that mean? I don't know either. Do you think maybe that was an aim of one of his songs Tommy James and his Shawn L's alive and kicking? It might have been. Maybe that's what they meant.
Let's see no it was not so I don't have no idea who wrote this G. E. C. Riley Harper Valley PTA that's a good one.
Yep but I think she had something else. Not that big but on the heels of it. How do you spell G. E. C. Riley?
She stole it. Are you I? No sir. That's not R. E. I. L. L. Y. No. What I would guess. No. How about just R. I. L. E. Y. It's got a boring. All right.
The end rhymes G. E. C. Riley good one. Redeemed yourself on his facts. Write that down for next time.
Number one for week in 1968 Harper Valley PTA a medley of her smash written by Tom T. Hall. No less. Also it says Bobby Bland also had
lived a little girl dancing true on your love light and I'm trying to think why is he a right about Bobby Bland and you want to know why?
Why? Maybe I miss spoke when I was talking about Montego Bay and I said Bobby Bland. Bobby Bloom had Montego Bay not Bobby Bland.
You must have miss spoke because it's right here on the CD and we've been reading it off the CD.
Bobby Bloom Bloom. Okay got it. How about Brian?
Somebody said something about when we were talking about the Cavalier or when you were talking about one of the young
rascals. We look Cavalier. Yeah. Felix Cavalier is the guy but you were saying some different name because that's what the fact said or something.
Yeah. Mandage called up and dove was correcting us on that.
And correct it this on what? Because we were you were saying some different name other than Felix Cavalier.
Oh my god. Come to butt out. Come to stick with Tom Brady. Okay. He probably like to. Anyway now speaking of Bobby Bloom see it's amazing.
The one thing I love about these billboard top 40 books. Not only do they have artists by artists all their hits and then you go in the back and they've got them alphabetically by the name of the song.
If you wouldn't know the title of the song you see who the artist was all kinds of good stuff all kinds of charts but under each artist they've got for example in the groups they have the name of each member.
And if they're still alive things like that Bobby Bloom born in 1945 in New York City died from an accidental shooting on 228.748.28.
How do you like that huh? No idea. Top singer songwriter much session work in the 1960s but is only hit Montego Bay reached number eight October 1970.
Bobby Bloom not Bobby Bland Bobby Bloom okay. This guy probably heard Joseph Gackie last week and was thinking more like Bland you know what I'm saying. Bland like Joseph Gackie.
Tainted love soft sell leading with 48 votes George is very dubious about that. Yeah. Well I'm just telling you the way it stands right now. I'm not buying it in the same goes for Taco the only reason they're voting for tacos because of that bit that we play otherwise none of these maybe they like Taco Bell would have remembered it.
Norman Greenbaum spirit in the sky 27 mountain Mississippi Queen 26.

Zayr and Evans in the year 2525 got 18 blues image ride captain ride that's a great song 16.
Question Mark and the math theory in 96 here's no matter where the hell they're from there from second on Michigan believe me.
And you want to know how you know that how do you know that because when they used to play that song on a radio in Michigan they used to say they were from
