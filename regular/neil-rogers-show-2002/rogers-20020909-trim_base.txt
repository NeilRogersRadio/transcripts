how quick he was
uh... it shocked me i i know i just remember
you know knowing him being a good football player
i was surprised that his quickness inside
they combine him with Ferguson who we lost all last year and then wepster
who we signed from baltimore
those are three good tackles and we have four very good and so we can line up
our two pass rush defense events
with uh... promise and and john everham
that they run they run under four six there four five
well everybody want
those speed rushers on the outside
that's what we were trying to get so that's why you drafted by entomus
that's exactly right that's why we took them
and uh... he sure looks good and can't but i'm using them on pun return
i've got them on one little thing and
let them rush the punter a little bit so he's helping me there
and uh... he looks good there looks really good to matter fact yeah
we were returned to regular programming momentarily on wqm dot com
and that's what the
all the white folks hate the black folks and the black folks hate the white folks
to hate all but the right folks is an old established rule but you're a
national brother to eat
national brother to eat
lean on horn and sheriff park our dancing cheap to cheek
and
all the poor folks hate the rich folks and the rich folks hate the poor
folks all of my folks hate all of your folks
it's american as apple pie but during
national brother to eat
national brother to eat
new yorkers love the kwe to rikens calls it very cheap
step up and shake the hand of someone you can't stand you can tolerate him if you try
all the protestants hate the catholics and the catholics hate the
protestants and the hindus hate the mazlons and everybody hates the Jews but
during
national brother to eat
national everyone smile at one and other hood week

I know to have five fifty wqm happy jr happy your Monday to you
and
you know
you know
you know
you know
you know
you know
you know
you know
you know
you know
you know
you know
sorry
can't you up on that back and okay i think the truth will set you free and a lot of
people are emotional cripples and can't handle the truth you know i'm talking
about i know you're not
emotional cripples kind of like mocha's week
anyway
nine hundred and fifty two votes on the pool and we asked on friday what do you think
is going to happen this year on nine eleven
which is
Wednesday
only two days away
anybody out there can a little bit nervous
oh we asked nothing nothing unusual five hundred and thirty eight people said
that
that's fifty six and a half percent
i have no idea which of course was a correct answer when that's the right answer
that was the right answer
that's what we voted three hundred and forty i mean how do we know
but you know we did ask for your opinion three hundred and forty two said that
thirty six percent
another terrorist attack
seventy two people only seven and a half percent
well i shouldn't say only
that's actually more than you would have thought isn't it
yes
seven and a half percent are in fear of another terrorist attack coming on Wednesday
i don't know just it just seems to me too predictable you know
i don't think that these scumbags these uh...
dark age assholes want to be predictable but at any rate we'll see i guess when we
and i will take it as right now up front
if you want to seek a refuge this Wednesday from the eighty five thousand
consecutive hours you're going to be hearing and seeing
about the you know while we're in the misery of last year's grotesque events
and could happen on this show
i told your before the show today i'm going to do my damnedest on Wednesday to avoid
unless of course it's something happens if something happens well you know
the on top of it but other than that uh... forget about it excellent
and we're not going to fit that that's the wrong term to use not going to forget
about it but we're just give you a place where you can come and hide for four
hours and get away from the endless coverage
it's ridiculous last night now they had a good uh... they had a good show on
date line which had nothing to do with nine eleven
which had to do with a trial the Pensacola trial which will get to in a minute
because that's just it's just that my head is still spinning from all of that
and you know who's the real asshole
i i know i know that's a really a loaded question
a real asshole is Dan Abrams on msnbc
okay you know they're going on about well the fact that they tried the chavis
and they tried the two kids and the same prosecutor they try had two
different trials in the same case and he's saying oh well you know this happens
all the time and of course every other legal expert they've had on in last
four or five days it said this is unprecedented nobody ever heard of such
a thing but dan Abrams who's always talking over the judge and talking over you
know he's he's more important everybody else he's got an ego almost as
big as much as work but it ain't right dan Abrams msnbc you make me sick
somebody who bought a floater a lot of ticket at a Pembroke Park gas station
is a millionaire i told George before the show and this is the truth
two numbers away from not being here today
i get a call eight fifteen Saturday morning the phone rings i'm sound asleep on
a Saturday morning who the hell would you call just a schmooz at eight fifteen
in the morning i would still be asleep at eight fifteen on a Saturday morning i
would have so was i since i have to get up six o'clock in the morning the rest of the week on a
weekdays for i enjoy sleep in on a weekend especially i don't have a dog crawler
over me till whenever how i feel like getting up
phone rings and of course i finally get up and i go out in the front room and
there's nobody on the phone so i was already awake and i thought well i'll sit here
and the next time the phone rings whoever the person is that calls that was the
first new call at eight fifteen and will rain up right very good
so i've ten after nine i'm sitting there watching tv ten after nine phone rings
it's rumored
come on
yeah not David rumored a prosecutor from the two Pensacola trials which i'll get
to that man just it just uh... frost my ass
in the first trial he says oh here are the two kids they're going to testify against
Ricky Chavis and you've had to believe what they say because they're little kids
they're not going to make up stories blah blah blah and then after he finds out
what they and he and the judge and a couple of other people already knew the
verdict from the first trial right then he goes and he puts the two kids on
trial and he says to the jury a different jury says oh well you can't believe what
these kids it because they already gave a confession they got no credibility i
mean what are we talking about here i think for justice we got to go to don
crawler owner somebody beside the american justice system
the joke
but then abrum says all happens all the time
so anyway when we finally get to the end of a meaningless conversation i go to
taking place anytime the remain finally says well uh... i bought twenty one
lottery tickets that i buy you twenty one will go in partners i should sure
whatever you know whatever
noon yesterday the phone rings and i notice you like put it off until more
respectable time noon yesterday my phone rings and there's the rim man again
on one of the ticket on one of my twenty one tickets we had the first four
numbers in a row
the thing he had the tickets not me i think i would have a part of that in the
elevator again
that's seriously i mean if you ever had the first four numbers
in a row
i mean at that point when you get to the fourth one you start like uh... your
cheek start vibrating in your ass too
but unfortunately that was the end of it so we got seventy bucks
seventy bucks for us so that's thirty five a piece for twenty one so i made fourteen
bucks
so the fact that he won fourteen i'll tell you they can afford to buy that lunch
by the way how would you know if it was one of your tickets or when it is
he separated them i see
and i told him i said what he said see i didn't do you know
in other words he's bragging about the fact that he uh... didn't lie about
it i said for seventy five
it had one of course and that's what i said of course of course if it would have
had the other two numbers i would have called you up and it would have said
i'm sorry the number your downing has been disconnected no further information
you know he did yeah right he'd been long gone
anyway seven tickets one bought a fee subco at thirty one fifty one was how
the old beach book of our night Saturdays winning numbers to share in the eighty five
million dollar jackpot ten sixteen twenty two twenty nine we had ten sixteen
twenty two twenty nine did not have thirty six or forty one god damn it you think i
would have been here if we would have no i would have to do one last show
all right you have to you what the big one last show that big one last show i
could tell Greg
it's just i'm not going to do the one last show i'll still say hey Greg
just for the hell of it and that goes for you to know which will get to him
we'll get to that ridiculous story in the Palm Beach post from Saturday in a minute
anyway story employee off top wooden was so excited to find out that his
gas station sold a winning lot of ticket he congratulated himself
oh congratulations he said that's good i don't think you said i like you think
you said i like that i think it's not it just like that oh that's good
wooden said Saturday brought too many people buying tickets everybody wanted
ten lot of fifteen lot of some people live in about a hundred tickets the other
winning tickets were bought in four mires jackson will the winter garden winner
haven india india and the Atlantic what's all that that up like by a stork i don't
know it's up there i've heard about it and what cala what do you mean you heard
about it i heard the name total of four hundred and thirty three tickets match five
that's a the problem with a lot of he is the five doesn't get enough to four
is okay enough and they you know i mean seventy bucks for four numbers that's
a ripoff and and forty nine hundred and fifty seven for five it's it's weak
but like i said you know when they're going to be of that many winners that's not
the week you want to win anyway right right you want to know who wants ten million
bucks you want to be greedy and get the whole god damn pot so nice going remember
don't call me eight fifteen in the morning again you lunatic here on can i
clarify something from uh... friday please never always talk about that nutrition
book yes which i realize nobody cares about that nevertheless there was a thing
and there about sugar substitutes that end in o sc and about how they're all bad
me idea and so anyway after the show i realize there's a message on my thing i go
down there's a shibuna champion light which i was very excited about so i go down
there and i get that i thought you know it seems to me that
champion light has sucralos and sure enough i look in there and it does i look back
into book and i realize that only and i'm not saying this to like a shield for
anybody because what have i always said about those uh... sugar the ones that end in
old like in all those candies sort of uh... right you know what i'm talking about
p d lennie who's made me crap my brains out all those ones that end in oil like
sorbitol and multi-tall and like a sh** crap at all by the way gerry into good no so
so anyway sucralos has no calories and no carbohydrates so that's not a problem
so it's a okay but fructose and maltose glucose those that have a chloric
value at the same as sugar see what i'm saying i say good anyway here's our
poll question for today and i put this off for a couple weeks since i want to
give everybody an opportunity to rip George i mean to give you a high marks
how did George do filling in for neal this summer
we do the survey here what is this the third year in a row yes
do it every year and generally you come out okay i mean there are a few people
out there want to take a cheap shot want to rip you an ass and of course it
no plus it's the dual holiday so i figured out it was a good time to take it there won't be as high of a juke
content who consider you to be a virulent anti-semite which is just
totally unrealistic and even though somewhat true how did George do filling in for
neal this summer i've got you six choices okay
excellent job better than ever that's going to be my vote i tell you that right now
good okay okay fair week or i don't listen when George is on
now that that covers it all don't you think sure does i'm giving you a real good
opportunity there to get kissed or ripped or what's the distinction between fair and okay
okay means that they enjoyed it fair means like just don't start nitpicking
i'm giving like all these i want to declare a notification on there because if we
take out one of those i mean uh... they're at least you got four that are okay all right
okay okay okay okay my poll god damn it and i've seen your polls believe me
how did George do filling in for neal this summer excellent job better than ever that
that's all one by the way okay Eric you got i don't want to get your confused because his blood sugar is swirling now
good okay okay fair week or i don't listen when George is on

believable because the people that they talk to all of them
believe that ricky chavises the one who killed the father of the bat
now the first group they said they believe that but they didn't the prosecution
didn't present enough evidence and then the one guy this old creep he says
well uh... you know i voted to equip because
uh... he's got these other two charges you can have to be tried for and i
know he's going to be convicted and go up the river for at least fifty years
so i'm not worried about that
you following that
he's convinced that he did it
as was uh... the whole jury basically but uh... they didn't have enough
evidence to convict them
and then the jury in the uh... kids that are out they also believe that
chavis actually did the thing which is why they only convicted the kids of
second-degree murder not first-degree murder
because they don't believe that they actually swung a bat and delivered the
blows to us and they killed them
they think they're ricky chavises and they were shot
shot when they heard the version that she was trying not guilty they they were
in disbelief
anyway
jurors who tried to baby face boys and charges are killing their father
with a baseball bat brought gas to learn
that another panel that acquitted and adult accused in the case but they're
conclusion that the boys only helped
and then swing the bat stunned the prosecutor who presented both cases
yet that david rimmer asshole
and like i said he's telling he's telling the first jury all these kids are
credible and they're gonna testify against ricky chavis and you got to believe
them and blah blah blah and then he tells the second jury that they're little
allires and that they already confessed and here's their confession for you
listen to and uh... they did it
man
this is justice
you will watch this whole thing this thing's gonna blow up in their face on
appeal you know that
yeah which is a big so i don't know
all i can do it king ages thirteen and fourteen were spared a life term on a
jury found the guilty friday of second-degree murder without a weapon
the boys face twenty two years to life without parole but the judges be to go
below the minimum when their sentence dot tober seventeen
if they've been convicted at first of your measures charged early option was
life sentences without parole
their convictions have rekindled talk about changing a florida law that
allow them to be tried as adults in a separate trial
convicted child molester ricky chavis for the was accused of committing the
crime by himself he was acquitted and the verdict was sealed until after the
boys trial
assistance state attorney david rimmer who prosecuted both trowel city
thought the panel in the boys case had ignored the allegation they wielded the
bad and simply gave the boys a jury pardoned by convicted them of the lesser
offense
the jurors no good and well he was killed with a weapon remember said
that's a jury pardon that's okay i don't have a problem with that he said
the jury for woman said that that wasn't the case that the panel believe neither
boys swung the bat
but rather than chavis carried out the slang the jurors didn't know of course
that chavis already been acquitted in a separate trial
their decision to convict the boys a second-degree murder was based on their
belief in alison d'arick open the door let the killer of the house for woman
linjforte sold a Pensacola news journal
that reasoning stunned rimmer i didn't think that at all rimmer said
rimmer i had a hoi and asking the uh... chavis jury for conviction saying the
only reason the case came close came to trial with that the boys had lied
either when they told police they killed their father or the jurors when they
said chavis did it
he said it was up to the chavis jury decide which was the line added i don't
have a dog in this fight
oh give me a break one of the jurors reasoning in the boys trials he said was
i thought perhaps he encouraged them to do it but i never felt chavis was
there
alison d'arick had testified they opened the door and that they went out to
chavis's car but no physical evidence was introduced at the trial showing
the chavis had been in the house
short said the jurors thought the boys recorded confessions were forced
rehearse and unbelievable
short said the king jurors were a gas when they heard chavis have been
acquitted i was so shocked i couldn't believe it's a short fifty two she said
the other jury saw a different presentation different interpretation it's too
bad they couldn't have all been tried to get that might have been a fair trial
she said
the rubber and Thomas masters a lady upon a prosecuting children's adult and
death sentences for juvenile said he thought the jury was sending a message to
change the law
there's no way in the world you can receive a fair trial and adult arena
where you're looked upon as an adult when you have the might of a child said
masters
a pastor at new master only a factor to church in prestigious review of each
masters became involved in the issue with one of his teenage congregation members
which charged with murder as an adult
Nathaniel brazil was thirteen and may two thousand when you know i don't want
all of that
Florida log is prosecutors only two choices when children are charged with major
crimes such as murder they can be prosecuted with juvenile's or adults with
nothing in between governor jab bushmeister
acknowledges being uncomfortable with some prosecution and children as an
adult
i do think prosecutors are not have the flexibility to turn in term in the
jurisdiction
whether it's juvenile or a deli say
i'll tell you one thing right now this guy this chavis this pedophile piece of
third
yes
tether or not
whether or not he wielded the bet you know he was up to up to his ears in it
okay he either planted the idea and uh... gave them the idea of doing it
or he did it himself
guilty as hell
implicated right up to his guy named earlobes
don't you think of course
see one thing about pedophiles and contrary to what the church would tell you
uh... they don't there's no cure
right
and then of course he denies are writing the love letters denies having a
sex with it with this twelve year old kid
but hey there's american justice for your baby is uh... and let's try a
whole bunch of people okay maybe we can get one conviction
or maybe we can get like two maybe we can fry two people for the same crime
i bet you they'd like that in texas yeah
when they want to hang everybody
nine forty one just calm down just relax don't get all whipped up into a
frenzy we're going to go into a rack we're going to invade we're going to put

Oh, and it's up to people to like.
And those you may even find.
Do they why didn't it reside?
This is the time.
The way.
Yeah.
This is.
Oh.
This is.
And everybody who broke a cake.
Oh, my god.
Yeah.
This is.
This is.
Yeah.
This is tonight.
That's been so while we've forward.
I'm 48 at 5.5.
You do a you're aware why I play that now?
No, you're not.
You didn't read this entire thing that you faxed to me that one of our listeners from South
Miami.
Oh, the little thing that found us on my doorstep in South Miami this weekend thought you'd
be interested.
It's a piece of propaganda from the repeal the gay rights ordinance people.
And by the way, before I get into what it says here, Friday night on Donahue, which I
was one of the 10 people watching, and right here about his ratings.
Oh my God, they're even lower than Moa Cheswell.
Oh, damn it.
Anyway, guess who was on there?
Mayor Pingo Picania with the vestiment tensions.
Of course, even the way I had no idea what he was talking about was totally unqualified
to be there against that armesto broad.
I wish I'd seen that.
Have you ever seen her?
No.
So, man, talk about forming a thumb out.
She didn't want to shut up for a second.
And of course, she also was just viewing propaganda.
And unfortunately, he was totally unqualified to be on here because she kept saying things
like, there was no discrimination.
There's never been one case but, and of course, in the article I have here from Washington
Post, which I'll get to in a second, 71 discrimination claims have been filed with the county
since the United Discrimination Emergency was restored four years ago.
More than 50 have been settled or are still open.
And of course, that's only people who actually had the cajones to come forward and file
discrimination suits.
But according to Amizar Mesto, there are no discrimination cases.
It's just a smoke screen.
And it's a piece of crap that is, do not be fooled.
It's a smoke screen, see?
Which will take away your parental rights.
Kids get graphic instruction, homosexual sex.
Many of us are familiar with the travesty that occurred in the Massachusetts Public School
system where glistened red workshops were children are exposed to workshops that taught,
what is that?
Oh, fisting.
See, there you go.
Fisting, I just get through a plan and I can't read this thing.
Fisting and other techniques for gay sex, this is what they will do in date if given the
chance, vote yes, it says 242 September 10th, meaning tomorrow.
And of course, obviously anybody with a brain will vote, which is what Mayor Pingo Picani
was leading.
In fact, you know, he's the coach here, one of the vote no campaign.
No, I didn't know that.
How are you like that?
Well, he can sniff the political wins, you know?
He stuck his nose out the window.
He stuck one finger up our good friend Juan Mendi, and put his nose out the window.
He said, oh my God.
Not politically correct to be voting yes on this thing on repeal.
At any rate, here's the other thing.
Now, she was, she didn't want to stop talking, Donnie, who was hard pressed to get her to
shop for a second.
Anita Bryant, in all her frilly 1970s, Bufat Glory, smiles down from a record cover,
propped on a corner-found cabinet of the election headquarters of the gay rights group,
Saved Aid.
Well, I remember that like it was yesterday.
Bryant is a mythic and reviled figure in this room.
The orange juice spokeswoman and beauty queen, who led a successful campaign 25 years
ago, to repeal a grab breaking ordinance that prohibit a discrimination against gays
and lesbians in date county.
The ordinance was narrowly restored in 1998 by county commissioners, but it is once
again the subject of a fiercely contested repeal effort that will be decided by voters
tomorrow.
The election bears enormous, practical, and symbolic importance to national gay rights groups,
which have sent dozens of volunteers to Miami in hopes of defeating the measure and discouraging
repeals in more than 200 cities and counties that have laws prohibiting discrimination against
gays and lesbians.
It is sort of our version of the freedom riders at Lower Gene Executive Director of the
National Gay and Lesbian Tax Force, which has contributed volunteers in 100 grand to
Saved Aid, Anita Bryant wreaked havoc all over the country.
We wanted to show the country that not only has Miami changed, but the world has changed
too.
Bryant, who lives in Tennessee, has not been involved in the summer's date kind of repeal
fight, but reminders of her 1977 campaign are everywhere.
She's tried to fight two nickels to rub together, so she can pay all of her help in O'Pore
Anita.
At times, it seems gay rights activists here are battling the ghost of Bryant's long
ago Saved Our Children campaign, as much as the conservative Christian groups who have
sponsored the current repeal, a flyer in Saved Aid's office, Urges Volunteers, do
undo Anita.
Homophobia is so retro.
The flyer of Oaks of Central Tension and Election campaign, Saved Aid Want voters to view
the repeal as an anti-gay initiative, the pro-repeal take back Miami-Dade group wants
to frame it as an assault on what they believe is an unnecessary law.
Take back Miami-Dade's approach departs somewhat from the strategy employed by Bryant, who
took a moral tone in her public remarks and warned that the anti-discrimination law would
encourage gays to recruit children.
Take back data is echoed some of those themes in literature at distributes.
One of its flyers said, Homosexualists want to get orphaned children through adoptions,
and they're demanding the repeal of all laws that protect children against sexual abuse
and exploitation.
An Anthony Verdugo, a member of Take Back Miami-Dade, says, the central theme of the campaign
focuses on not extending privileges to gays and lesbians that might not be afforded
to others.
The real issue with special rights and special powers that some people in our community
want is used as a battering ramegan's people who disagree with a particular ideology said
Verdugo, who was head of the Miami-Dade Christian Coalition.
What a surprise.
He said, reductions in date count, he grants to the boy scouts, which bans gays true
pleaders.
Take back data also contends that gays and lesbians are not the victims of discrimination.
They have gay clubs, they have gay nights, they have clubs that are not gay, they have
gay restaurants, said Rosa Armesto de Gonzales.
A Take Back date above volunteer who serves as Verdugo's attorney, it's said at discrimination,
you see special treatment.
Such reasoning baffles draw its kettle-honed, co-chairman has saved it, considering that
71 discrimination claims have been filed with a county equal opportunity board since the
non-discrimination ordinance was restored four years ago.
More than 50 cases have been settled or are still open according to board's records.
Yet for all the claims filed with the board, kettle-honed said one of his group's main
challenges is drawing gays and their supporters to the polls tomorrow.
The people who are with us tend to be complacent because they think their human rights are
safe, he be saying.
That sense of complacency was stoked, kettle-honed, said by a Harold Pull release last week, that
showed 54% opposed to the repeal, 34% forward and 12% undecided, and the past decade repeals
and main and Colorado succeeded after pre-election polls predicting the office-in-resolved meaning,
and the privacy of the voting booth, all of a sudden, bigotry rears that's ugly head
and political correctness goes out the window.
In Dade County and Array of Politicians and Celebrities, and publicly opposed the repeal
including 18 of the 21 mayors in the county, and pop star Gloria Estefan.
The repeal effort is also suffered from a series of scandals.
Take back Dade came under fire for using the image of Martin Luther Coon Jr. on a flyer.
Also four repeal supporters, including Ferdugo, were arrested last month for falsifying
petitions needed to get the measure on a ballot they have pleaded not guilty and have
said the arrest were politically motivated.
In the final days leading up to the elections, both sides have turned to churches.
Candlestick's vigils were planned and Sunday sermons were polished.
It seemed fitting in Arthur Curtis' 61st-Ave Day Valentine,
remember togethering at St. John's on Lake Church in Miami Beach to plant strategy for
the fight against the repeal.
Someone mentioned that Bryant used to sing there in years before she moved from her
mansion in Miami Beach.
We all thought it was a brilliant moment, Curtis said they were all sitting down where
Anita Bryant had staged her last hurrah in Dade County.
And by the way, hey Anita!
Bye bye bye!
That's for you, sweetheart.
Yeah, the old orange juice queen.
Seen her lately?
No.
I have a...
The only thing we heard about her is the fact that she can't find, like I said, four
nickels to rub together and she can't pay her all health.
Not doing so well.
Not doing too good for Anita.
That'll teach you to take us on fags.
And of course that was before we had Rosie.
I'll tell you one thing about the Rosie O'Donnell boy, he's really doing it.
Let's see, 100 George's...
119 votes on a pool.
How did George do filling in for Neil this summer?
I don't listen well when George is on 53, 44 and a half percent.
Sounds a little high to me.

You think?
Excellent job.
Better than number 25.
Good, 22.
OK, 12.
So you add those up and you got a few.
Week six and fair for a friendly got one.

And then from 10 to 10.30 we must have dead air because the schedule says

You notice that?

I see.
Could it be a misprint clearance?
And I hear death lots to come back.

and the foundation of the
ten or two and five sixty w q and that's his on cnn at the canada says that
it must work through the m u n first
because he met in the trotaries meeting in the trot with john crutch and
will frog you know what crutch and told him this morning
that's exactly what he said so here's the fact that says Georgia show is the
second best on q a m behind yours of course Georgia show has steadily
improved and you are absolutely correct and i'd like to bear that out by
pointing out here that the last two summers and i'm sure this summer will be
no different the ratings are george your show are far higher than anybody else
on q a m you think that's a coincidence of course for and things that happens
by osmosis it's the tape that helped me i see now let me ask you out why did you
uh... facts me this note is opposed to like discussing it on the years there's
something wrong with that enough you wanted to discuss it on why not i don't
know because i don't want to those things
because uh... george said in this note which seems kind of silly you i don't i
don't know it seems kind of strange my reading of facts when you're you're sitting
right there not that there's anything wrong with pruning of
parents is for the people from other shows especially people we like like
joe and mark and beast
but i'm the you're the only one meaning me on the stage that does that well
when we i used to do a parenthesis mad dog with promoted all the time on the
weekend and joe rosie mentioned joe right but i you left out mad dog he's very
good at that
i've worked that that's probably because he's our partner in crime like in the
ten to three spot he's doing one of three but even before he was my partner
in crime was only doing weekends he still always was real good about that
like like a lot of times he'd be on the year on the weekend on the saturday
right and we'd be doing a thing like a pizza law for me and you'd be driving
there he'd be promoting the hell out of it the weekend guys like when joe does
the weekend show if there's something going on or about to come on right he
will promote it when man the little dog and the man dog the regular and i'm
more than a week i'm sure that if uh... you give the information to moe he'd be
delighted to promote
your parents
i'm gonna start like doing appearances like a brand new pizza lot
i'm sure that moe got it up
ecstatic to do that
she brought up the example there are some shows that don't promote appearances
for their own people
really really
whether some shows that don't promote not only don't promote other shows on
the station but encourage their listeners not to listen to certain other shows
on the station
i guess i was a moment that point in his big column and saturday in the pond
beach post unprecedented maybe in history of broadcasting that we have certain
people on qa m promoting for uh... people not to listen to the show that follows
that which is also on her
of course he can't be influenced by this because he don't listen anymore
uh...
so we have a high marks for joe and uh... what's his name i mean mad
all right let's get down to business okay
i got so much stuff here and i feel like uh... i've wasted the whole first
hour you think it was a way to know i don't think
this is from newsweek and this is gonna make you puke
get the bag out okay and don't forget this wednesday this will be the one show
not that we want to make light of nine eleven i would be the last thing in the
world we would do but
i'd like to give people an alternative who've already seen enough of the pictures
heard enough of the horror stories heard enough of the uh... grieving from
the relative and enough of the grieving already you know it
how long do we have to be in perpetual grief right
you can be angry you can be pissed off you can be outraged but you can't lose
your sense of humor and you can't lose your will to go on with life that's
what we need to do is go on with life
instead of this constant resurgence of uh... outrage being orchestrated you know
by the uh... powers in washington manipulating us like puppets on the end of
the string playing with our emotions so that we get already to get behind us a
new war now
which is coincidentally all the uh... saber rattling coming right before the
guy demolition
just a coincidence and i think he says you know off your election every other
year
right just a coincidence
even though they plan for this month and months and months ago only now
are they starting to really
rattled their sabers publicly notice that i notice
anyway
exclusive in newsweek the informant who live with a hijacker newsweek is learned
that one of the beer of the beer of the main the fby one of their informants had
a close relationship with two of the hijackers by a michael is a coffin is
which newsweek
at first fby director bob muller and sister there was nothing the bureau could
have done to penetrate the nine eleven plot that account has been modified
over time and now may change again
newsweek is learned that one of the bureau's informants had a close relationship
with two of the hijackers he was there roomy
the connection just discovered by congressional investigators has stunned some
top-counter terrorism officials
and raised new concerns about the information shearing among u.s. law enforcement
and intelligence agencies
the two hijackers collied al-Mindar and now off al-Hazmi
were hardly unknown to the intelligence community
the cia was first alerted to them in january of two thousand when the two
Saudi national showed up at a kind of summit in kuala lumpur Malaysia
fby officials have argued internally for months that if the cia had more quickly
passed along
everything in new about the two men the bureau could have hunted them down more
aggressively
but both agencies can cheer on the blame upon leaving Malaysia
al-Mindar and al-Hazmi went to sandiego where they took flight school lessons
in september two thousand the two moved into the home of a muslim man who would be
friend of them at a local islamic center
the landlord regularly prayed with them and even helped one open a bank account
he was also sources tell newsweek a tested undercover asset who'd been working
closely with the fby office in sandiego
on terrorism cases related to hamas
a senior law enforcement official
told newsweek the informant never provided the bureau the names of his two
house guests from soudi arabia
nor does the fby have any reason to believe the informant was concealing their
identities he could not be reached of course for comment
he's hiding under his uh...
blanket
what's that thing that they are what would you call that
unmagic carpet
but the fby can see that the sandiego case agent appears to have been at least
aware that soudi visitors were writing rooms in the informants house
on what occasion sources the case agent called up the informant was told he
couldn't talk because colleague a reference to almond are was in the room
icy smith
a former top-up fby account of intelligence officials as the case agent should
have been keeping closer to have
and who was informed was fraternizing with if only to seek out the house
guest as possible informants they should have been asking who are these guys what
are they doing here
this drug smear the lack of investigative curiosity about six weeks after moving
into the house on the dollar left town explained that the land already was
heading back to soudi arabia to see his daughter
all house me moved out of the end of two thousand in the meantime
the cia was gathering more information about just how potentially dangerous
both men were a few months after the october two thousand bombing of the
west's cool and yemen cia endless discovered in their Malaysia file that one
of the chief suspects in the coal attack tough uh... toffee
of being a touch was present at the summit and have been photographed with
almond are and ha ha has me but it wasn't till august 23rd 2001 that the cia
sent out an urgent cable to us border and law enforcement agencies
identifying the two men as possible terrorists by then it was too late
the bureau didn't realize the sandy eagle connection until a few days after
nine eleven when the informant heard the names of the pentagon hi jackas and
called his case agent i know those guys the informant purportly said referring
to almond are in all has me they were my roommates
but the belated discovery has unsettled some members of the joint housing
television committees investigating the nine eleven attacks the panel is tentatively
do to begin public hearings is early september eighteen racing within the
or deadline but some members are now worried that they won't get to the bottom
what really happened by then support for legislation creating a special
love investigative panel similar to probes conducted after poor harbor in the
committee assassinations increasing only then some members able to public
learn whether more nine eleven secrets are buried in the government files
what do you think you think there are more here again
but the first lady says and maybe she might have a point here you know it
although c i have other choices i may watch screen tv
okay well what's wrong with that nothing i wish i had a green tv
that's all screaming there gonna be a lot of other people screaming on nine eleven
let's hope uh... only for a memory sake i don't think anything's gonna happen
the
first lady laurel bush is asking parents to turn the tv off Wednesday september
other than instead read to their children and perhaps light a memorial candle
you know what the christopher's used to say if everybody would just light one
little candle we probably have a lot of house fires
don't let your children see the images especially on nine eleven when you know
it'll probably be on television again and again the plane hitting the building
of the building spalling missus borsan interview friday with universe
a spanish language tv network will are they showing a k pa se was a reruns

pressed the fang is the headline in the story yesterday's Toronto star
serious journalist to sort of brought a perspective or handicap by americans
patriotism government interference media self-sensorship and jingoistic bias
this uh... this will have to be a two-part or at least okay just stand just come
down
linda herst right no one could have predicted the when we're in how the terrorist
attacks on the united state last september but those in the know were
where that the risk however nebulous was real if nothing else the bombing of
the very same world trade center in nineteen ninety three told them that
in americans were profoundly unprepared for another and more lethal strike on
their own home turf nobody had warned them nobody explained who was likely to
launch it much less why where was the press
like the rest of america we were fat happy and arrogant is how mike walles the
celebrated coast of sixty minutes glumly put up this spring when i saw the media
his own much-loaded program included had failed to practice situation and led the
nine eleven aerobics stream is to some some god for second country raving on
about loathing america that's what it would have looked like in any u.s.
journalist pushing that story didn't stand a chance in the nineteen nineties
against the hypnotic enticement of old jay simpson john bane ramsey and monica
lewinsky those were the stories that brought in the viewers the readers more
to the point the ad revenue when each peter doubt of the public reached uh
satiation point another with step forward like gary kandita was waiting to
take its place cnn may have started the drift to tabloid news but by the end of
the nineteen nineties the major networks and mainstream press were equally albeit
reluctantly caught up in it for the first time news division to become highly
competitive profit centers that were expected to make money sounds like something
out of network doesn't it yes many journalists deplore the trend of the
insular but were sure that the public didn't want complicated dispatches from
complicated places they'd have trouble finding on a map there were studies to
prove it sort of foreign coverage was expensive in time consuming leave the
serious stuff the new york times and why not with the fault of communism in the
end of the evil empire america no longer felt threatened by anyone in anywhere
in the face of the earth it could be and was a world under which self and it
found itself fascinating wallace made his me a couple remarked one of a
series of panels put on this year by Harvard University and the Brookings
institution of Washington think tank to examine the role of the media before
and after nine eleven what lesson if any could be learned in the lead up to the
first anniversary a lot of american journalists are considering the same
issue whether the press will revert to the way it was before is the question
says anthony collings of former cnn and newsweek foreign correspondent now
teaching communications at the university of michigan
our general sense is that the media slightly more serious than before but
serious won't be a continuous state it'll go up and down the attacks were

because all have access to foreign material on the wires they choose not to run

That's f**king bitch.
When I wait you see at the end of this fact that I'm going to interject the middle of this article here,
it says, did you hear that Angcolder got fired?
No, we did not.
I looked for the article.
Huh?
Fired from what?
Because you had that other article that she was fired.
Her column was discontinued in that one.
No, but that can't be what they're talking about.
That was just one paper that dropped her column.
Anyway, we'll see.
But the rise to this fact, I'm going to interrupt that article because this is so well, you're worthwhile and timely.
Anybody paying attention?
No.
No.
They're busy worrying about this very kind of coming back.
And how about those American idol, too?
Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair talked to reporters before opening about three hours of talks at Camp David.
Bush's presidential retreat in Maryland.
Blair said that they newly released satellite photo of Iraq identifying new construction and several sites linked in the past to Baghdad's development of nuclear weapons.
And both leaders mentioned a 1998 report by the UN affiliated International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA, that said,
Sodom could be six months away from developing nuclear weapons.
I don't know what more evidence we need, Bush said, is he greeted Blair for a brainstorming session on Iraq.
We owe it to future generations to deal with this problem.
Brain storming.
I wonder who they are alone to George.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
In a joint appearance before the summit, the two leaders repeated their shared view that Sodom's oyster was the only way to stop Iraq's pursuit and potential use of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.
The policy of inaction is not a policy we can responsibly subscribe to Blair said as he joined Bush and tried to rally reluctant allies to deal with Sodom, perhaps by military force, as Bush was hiding the 45-nick-a-pictures of Tony Blair with a queen.
Contrary to Bush's claim, however, that the 1998 IAEA reported not say that Iraq was six months away from developing nuclear capability, NBC News is Robert Windrub reported Saturday.
Instead, Windrub reported the Vienna Austria-based agency said in 1998 that Iraq had been six to 24 months away from such capability before the 1991 Persian Gulf War, and he went and monitored weapons inspections that followed.
The war and the inspections destroyed much of Iraq's nuclear infrastructure and required Iraq to turn over its highly enriched uranium and plutonium windrub reported in a summary of its 1998 report.
The IAEA said that based on all credible information available today, they have found no indication of Iraq having achieved its goal of producing nuclear weapons or of Iraq having retained a physical capability for the production of weapon usable nuclear material or having clandestinely obtained such material.
A senior White House official acknowledged Saturday night that the 1998 report did not say what Bush claimed.
What happened was we formed our own conclusions based on the report the official told NBC News is neurodonal.
Meanwhile, Mark Gwodowski, Gwodauk, was a deki.
How do you spell it?
Gwodauk.
A spokesman for the UN Agency disputed Bush's and Blair's assessment of the satellite photograph, which was first publicized Friday,
contrary to news service reports there was no specific photo or building that aroused suspicions he told windrub.
The photograph in question was not UN intelligence imaging, but simply a picture from a commercial satellite imaging company, Gwodauk,
he said that IAEA reviewed commercial satellite imagery regularly and that from time to time,
a notice construction at sites that had previously examined was deki said the new construction indicated the photograph was no surprise and that no conclusions were drawn from it.
There was not a single building we see, he said.
How do you like that?
So like I told you, they've decided months and months ago that they're going to pursue this and of course now they're rattling all the sabres just before election time,
who just acquinsence the course.
So it's not a question of if it's a question of when.
Anyway, getting back to the article in Toronto Star by Linda Hurst.
In the first few days, the media performed a herculean task and did an empirical job since Vince Carlin, the American born former head of CBC News World,
now chair of Ryerson University during Lism School.
But they didn't follow through, he says, within weeks any attempts to analyze the multilayered backdrop to the attacks and affect the other side of the story were subsumed by the demands of President George W. Bushes with us or against this war on terrorism.
Evil is evil, says Carlin, when something is demonized, there's no need to analyze it.
In that, Bush reflects a fairly broad spectrum of the population.
Only recently, he says, have major organizations, the New York Times especially, started to run hard-nosed analyses of US-born policy and only after their columnists had done it first.
But in general, Americans were not noted for their interest in the rest of the world before 9-11 and they're not interested after.
There are all sorts of places in the world they should be looking at, but they're not.
How then are the media rated for what they have been covering?
Commentators on both sides of the border say serious journalists who saw a less meyetic perspective on the war were handicapped from the start by the emergence of patriotism into the picture that's never entirely been ex-sized.
The constraints started quickly.
Last October when National Security Advisor Condoleezer Rice called US networks asking them not to run certain types of teeth evil to a russama bin Laden because they were full of propaganda and possibly coded messages, they readily agreed.
However, the same request by 10 Downing Street in Britain was met with a flat refusal, government interference will be resisted, said the BBC.
In Canada, no calls were made by Ottawa and TV News executives exercised their own judgment on running unadded footage.
At the same time when the White House tried to prevent voice of American radio from airing an interview with Taliban leader Mohammed Omar, the staff threatened mass resignation.
They ran an edited version in a government spokesperson ominously responded that the defiance would be looked into.
When director Murner Whittworth was replaced, she left a memo warning reporters not to fall under the spell of self-sensorship, continue to interview anyone anywhere she said.
In November, CNN initiated a rule that any reporter doing a negative story on the war, the bombing of civilians say or of a Red Cross installation, much balanced it with a reminder that terrorists had killed 3,000 Americans.
CNN Chairman Walter Isaacson said it seems perverse to focus too much on the casualties or hardships in Afghanistan inside to say the real reason was pressure from viewers.
Either way, North Former employee callings, the Pentagon must surely have been pleased to learn that whenever its plans killed the wrong Afghans, CNN would quickly provide PR damage control.
More recently, a senior intelligence officer with a state department accused the media of treason because warning stories had been run on vulnerable future terrorist targets, chemical plants, the trucking industry and the food supply.
This type of reporting must be stopped or censored, he wrote in the Washington Post, as several columnists pointed out warnings work both ways if anyone had written about the possibility of terrorists taking flying lessons that alone might have put a wrench into 9-11.
While the public may be unaware of it, there's been less access to information in this war than all others before, say American journalist, as Kaplan noted earlier on, government officials now choose to sit down for the soft lobs of CNN's Larry King rather than face harder interrogation for maybe C's nightline already play selves.
Yeah, lobs from Larry King or Tim Russert on eat the press like yesterday again with his neighbor and post personal friend Dick Cheney, another embarrassment, another freaking disgrace.
And don't forget about that meeting between Muhammad Akhton and the neighborless guy from Iraq. I won't forget.
Okay, good.
Okay, let me do another break. But this is going to be a three-parter, you know.
But that's okay, it's almost over.

So anyway, Linda Hurst writes in the Toronto Star.
And this is at the end of the article.
Collings whose recent book, Words of Fire, deals with press independence globally,
says the end result has been coverage that is right for a cramped and jingoistic bias.
Canadian journalist and educator Peter Desbaret says the media has had a real opportunity
to do what journalism is supposed to do, provide comprehensive coverage,
and hasn't been taken advantage of.
Reporters continue to stay off hot button topics, such as the fate of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay,
or the rights violations of hundreds of detained Muslims, many of them US citizens.
They've been very quiet about that.
He says they find it difficult because it wouldn't be welcomed by the public.
Just like my show's here last Wednesday through Friday, which I'm sure pissed off a lot of people
who don't want to hear the truth.
Haset, by the way, if I can interrupt again, 930 last night there was a report on CNN
by one of the reporters I wish I'd written down the name of the guy.
And it echoed the whole litany of things that Cheryl Seal had in that first piece that I read.
Haset Wednesday?
The whole timeline of those events.
Nevertheless, Haset Brookings has surprised anyone who would even ask about the public's influence on reporting.
There's no question there's been public pressure on the press.
He says Americans were feeling threatened and protective and they made their voices heard loud and clear.
They expect the news to reflect their own point of view.
Indeed, American conservatives who've long viewed the media as relatively liberal buyers
have pounced on any reports that stray from official White House line.
After flag banners were dropped from the screen during newscast and local anchors removed the stars and stripes
and the lapel pins they had sprouted on 9-11.
Viewers were quick to ask about their allegiance.
Carlin says ABC News anchor Peter Jennings, Canadian and born and therefore suspect in many American minds
tried to bring a more sophisticated approach to the broadcast but his producers were warned off and went back to cheerleading.
Not all Americans settled for information can find a US point of view.
Many were watching CBC News as Carlin to get a broader spectrum of opinion.
Canadians are more outward looking.
They want information and the CBC made a valid effort to give the other side of the story.
In the first three months after 9-11, 36 US public television stations added BBC World News to their lineups.
The Jingoism finally got to long time CBC News anchor Dan Rather who had sported a flag pin in the media aftermath and an interview in London in June
he said patriotism run amuck was now trampling press freedom in the US.
The fear of being accused of lacking patriotism keeps journalists from asking the toughest of tough questions he didn't exempt himself.
One finds oneself saying I know the right question but this is not exactly the right time to ask it.
But if not now as Americans were on terrorism hovers on the brink of extending into Iraq then when?
Ash Linda Hurst article in the Toronto Starriest today.
Nice going, Ireland. What on target A?
X and I'm not so sure about this guy. What do you think of Scott Ritter? Do you think he's off the wall?
No, I don't. I think if anybody ought to know it's somebody who's actually been there.
And I like to point out that we don't see him anymore Richard or was his name the you went in Richard Butler right well poor lot well poor lot.
We saw him on nauseam day after day right after none eleven on CNN but I guess his price went up for something but he also agrees he was a chief inspector right and he's been he said it right then he said that they have no more they inspected they got no more any of this.
Iraq is incapable of producing weapons of mass destruction and should prove it by allowing in you and weapons inspectors and American who was once on the inspections team said yesterday.
With his comments during a visit to Baghdad Scott Ritter who's been a sharp critic of US policy on Iraq joined a long list of officials from European and Arab nations who've urged Iraq to accept inspectors to the fuser crisis with the US Iraqi cooperation on inspections would leave the US standing alone in regard to war threats on Iraq.
And this is the best way to prevent the war written said he was on with Paula this morning on CNN.
Bush administration officials yesterday who essentially came out and has has said that Sodom Hussein has been trying to obtain materials to build nuclear weapons particularly trying to buy thousands of aluminum pipes that could be used in the manufacture of a centrifuge and also really used to manufacture weapons.
What do you make of that.
When the search statement thousands of aluminum pipes and we're going to go to war over thousands of aluminum pipes even the I have reported you site said that if Iraq was to have trying to do uranium enrichment of take them many years before they could do it.
This is patently ridiculous these are aluminum pipes coming in for civilian use they are not being transferred to a covert nuclear processing plant or any covert nuclear activity whatsoever.
But the best way to figure this out is to send the weapons inspectors in if they if the United States has this evidence that Iraq has these types why not have give me the data I'll come to Iraq hunt it down will bring you to a close that would serve us going to war.
We cannot go to war because vice president Chinese worried about some aluminum pipes this is ridiculous.
The former US Marine intelligence office spoke to members of parliament and the journalist on his third trip to raxon TV sign from the went inspection team in 1998 as in the past.
His trip was organized by the Iraqi government the rest of his kids was not yet public you don't find that a little bit suspect sure.
Oh but still maybe he's going with the Peter Arnet maybe they're going on together Iraq while the nine its band weapons is offered only to continue dialogue with the win about the return of inspectors.
Additionally is the first step to further talks don't you love the way the you went makes demands yeah you either do this or we'll draft a resolution how do you like that we'll put it on our website so that everybody can tell the rest of the world that you're ignoring it like everybody else ignores all of our resolutions like Israel and everybody else paper tiger baby in a course we foot the bill for most of it like usual because we're suckers and we got to write there in New York as if New York doesn't have enough problems and targets already there is the UN sitting right there and God damn Manhattan.
Right right most expensive jerk off in the world.
Yeah you went you went said this and you went today and what the hell are they doing in fact how come we don't have you and peacekeeping I'm not talking about a handful gigantic numbers of troops in Afghanistan now you follow what I'm saying because if we do go into Iraq and we eliminate this comeback which is dubious advice we couldn't get them last time when we do go in there and flush him out.
And we take over you know over bag that in five days or whatever what do we do then.
So this is the problem that most people in the country just all wrapped up in a jingle was the bullcrap that I was just reading about nobody wants to come to grips with those articles about the Taliban and how we embraced them and we love them and we financed them.
First they were the Mujah Hadin and then they were the Taliban and then they were all the same scumbags we later we filed after 9-11 but on 9-10 we loved them.
And in May of the same year we handed over 43 million dollars and you can believe it was because they stopped the poppy growing or because of the Afghan oil pipeline but whatever you want to believe but it's a fact we do.
We gave it to them and then all of a sudden all the repressing women and they men all have to wear a beard a certain length in their barbarians.
Yeah and the same with the Saddam and on articles our bread last week that we helped them develop all of that chemical and biological capability.
Help them with his war against those worst evil doors in Iran see we do this all the time we put in one corrupt leader and then when they he turns on us like when he invaded Kuwait then all of a sudden we got a wrist thousands and thousands of American lives.
And then we got a wrist that we had to try to undo the evil doers most of the evil doers around the world are there because we put them there.
Oh you can't say that sorry good thing we're not.
By the way now Gaddafi closing in on new capability says you're wrong.
Well I tell you one thing we're sure going to have a good time for the years to come because there is no end to those evil doers.
It's a good thing that what's his name runs for all didn't get his way on 9-10 last year that we you know had some time to think about it for star wars that 900 million that he wanted.
For billion whatever it was you know small potatoes what's a few billion among friends Libya's Colonel more Mark Gaddafi has been secretly developing nuclear weapons capability and may acquired before Iraq.
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon one of Georgia's favorite people disclosed and mine too this less than heartwarming news and interviews before last week's Russia show the holiday weekend.
But again Israel may be the best prepared country in the world against the danger of a chemical or biological offensive.
This was his message to Israeli citizens who already are discussing on a daily basis the possibility that sawdum may launch warheads containing small posture and track that them as the last resort once the Bush administration moved to dethrone him.
But the threat of Libya is not well known and because Gaddafi is tried hard to clean up his act after being forced by US blood sanctions to indirectly admit complicitly in the lock or be airliner sabotage the dictator and triple denounce terrorism.
He tried to hire a Washington lord to get a little bit removed from the west list of tear sponsoring nations in nearly succeeded since the State Department during the Clinton administration conveyed the screen messages to them as really prime minister a who would barrage government that Gaddafi had endorsed the asher aerofarts peace process.
Gaddafi tried so hard to convince the world that he had stepped away from the access of evil 10 years ago a Libyan chemical weapons plant operating with the illegal help of German firms and scientists was shown blazing in flames intelligence reports indicated over the Gaddafi removed the weapons and equipment before staging the fire.
Operating with the illegal help of German firms and scientists but in the last month western intelligence agencies gained the tales of Gaddafi's latest adventure his bid to join the nuclear club.
At first intelligence aimless suspected that Egypt was helping him in this project but now it is certain that Iraqi scientists and engineers who developed their expertise in the last 25 years under Gaddafi are leading the underground Libyan effort.
Shiroon said a secret weapons effort is taking place in Iraq in a similar process going on in Libya which probably will turn out to be the first Arab state with weapons of mass destruction.
Other countries are helping Gaddafi but the extent of the assistance is not clear Shiroon said it may be that there is assistance from Pakistan as Iran had and nuclear weapons development that Prime Minister warned but for sure there is assistance from North Korea.
All the evil the worst baby they're doing it.
So who do we attack first?
Let's just start on the edge of the Mediterranean.
I say Gaddafi I don't like his head gear at all.
No. And that neighborhood jacket he wears that somebody should tell him it's out of style.

Let's see, here's the fact that everybody seems to be missing the real reason the shrub needs to invade a racket
and solve a puppet regime as he did with Afghanistan.
The trade sanctions against Iraq from the Gulf War will expire at the end of November.
This means Iraq, with the third largest oil reserve in the world,
will be able to dump the oil on the world market again in much lower prices than Saudi oil,
which will cut into poppy oil cake back from the Saudi.
Oh, jeez.
Rosie sex change.
Okay, let's get back to fat Rosie, shall we?
This is in this week's globe.

And a tie, a polka dot tie, it's lovely.
Rosie sex change.
Shocker is the headline.
Emotionally, she now sees herself as a man and wow does she look the part says the globe.
Hey, man, just look at Rosie.
Friends believe that her shocking new book looks amounts to her decision to change her sex say sources.
And everything but the physical sense, the ex talk show host acts like she switched gender,
and she's happier now than she's ever been in her life.
I thought we just got through reading last week about her, her, her, her boyfriend,

Right?
Didn't we?
Well, it all depends on which tabloid crap you want to believe.
The former queen of nicest suddenly changed in a way tough looking in your face leader,
primed to take on anyone who stands in her way.
I'd like to see her go three rounds with Janet.
Oh, by the way, tomorrow's the election.
Bill McBride.
Wouldn't you say Bill McBride and if hope no on 242 and Bill McBride for governor.
Yes.
It's a shadow range change from how Rosie presented herself at the Emmy Awards a few years ago,
since a pal.
Back then, she looked like a high school prom queen.
Now she's looking like a young Jackie Gleason.
It's amazing.
Rosie 40 has a man-a-share cut where is a mask where is masculine clothing and strides around like a guy.
And pal say her figure is somehow come to look manly and remarkably less feminine.
It's like Rosie had a change of sex as Matilda Rosenberg CEO and chief designer for the trendy clothing line,
Kukla International Link, whose outfit sell in top LA women's stores like Fred Siegel.
Kukla?
Okay.
What happened to Fran and Ali?
Physically, she's still a woman she tells the globe, but in her mind, Rosie's clearly 100% a man.
And Dr. Lewis Mollerace, psychologist based in Tampa, who counsels many gay women but has never treated Rosie, tells the globe,
she's on her way to becoming as masculine as she can.
Emotionally for Rosie, this amounts to a change of sex.
All right.
Another leading researcher on gay and lesbian issues notes that Rosie might go all the way and actually have a sex change.
I always told you, I thought she had a penis.
No, no, she's going to go get one.
She may be a lesbian who's always felt that she's really a man and may want to pursue her makeover even further by surgically becoming a man,
says the expert doctor Esther Rothbloom, a psychology professor at the University of Vermont, who's also not treated the star.
Whatever her final decision may be, Fran's point out that there's a stirring story behind Rosie's changing appearance, a saga of hills she's had to climb and obstacle she's overcome.
She sent shockwaves when she officially came out during an interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC's Pride and Time in March.
Rosie says she only started getting real much.
She dumped her passive girly act from TV, can find another pal.
The world has gotten hostile since she came out of the closet and she's got many paddles ahead.
If becoming more like a guy than a gal gives her a winning edge, more power to her.
Rosie's had come a long way toward finding out who she really is.
This person is a woman who's more comfortable looking and behaving like a man.
If anyone's got a problem with Rosie's butch way, she could care less.
How do you like that?
Fafangula, baby, that's the message from butch Rosie. Fafangula.
Rosie took that feisty attitude and her battle with the state of Florida was law banning gay people from an opting kids.
It stunned me to know that Florida the state where I live is the only one that doesn't love gay adoption, she says of the 77 law.
She has three children she adopted as a resident of New York, Parker 7, Chelsea 4 and Blake 2.
In her long time, Galpel, Kelly Carpenter is expecting a baby girl later this year.
And now that she's looking at Manley, you know something maybe Rosie impregnated, or you think?
I think it was spores.
Rosie's spokesperson says the changes in her appearance are no big deal and she's s'mores and she craps her hair for the summer.
You've got to see this picture.
Get the globe, look a little leaf through it in the echeca.
I...
But pals say that it's much more than that and reveal that Rosie couldn't be happier with her new self, cheerfully calling Kelly the little woman.
Ha ha ha ha!
Anybody stand next to her who would be the little something I guarantee you that.
And more than being provider and protector of what pals say she calls the wife and kids, Rosie is shown employees at her magazine Rosie, that she can be just as tough as the next boss man.
When colleagues express concern that she might turn her magazine into a forum for other lesbians and gay adoption proponents, staffers got a taste of her techno prisoners attitude.
She marked into the big apple offices and read them the riot act.
If there's one more leak from here to the press than Rosie is true, she reportedly thundered.
All this affects you a lot more than affects me.
I'm already an effing millionaire.
Adds her friend the swaggering way she walks, the rough way she takes charge and even browbeats people.
Her short hair and unfeminant clothing all make Rosie seem a little bit more manly every day.
How do you like that, huh?
Whatever.
Yeah, butch off. I mean, butch down.
Butch down, bitch.
Now let's see, I don't have time for this after the break, I'll do this one.
Bush's father feared expanded role in Iraq.
Contrary to what a lot of those right wingers out there like to tell us when we used to take those stupid calls, which were just loaded with misinformation.
I mean, if I have the choice between believing something that's well documented and written by a respectable journalist and a respectable rag,
then I'll tend to believe that more than some asshole calling in anonymously on a stupid radio talk show.
You know what I'm talking about?
I don't hear something about that.
Reporter Al Qaeda, I had nuclear plants this from the AP.
Al Qaeda considered striking US nuclear facilities in the 9-11 attacks and hasn't ruled out nuclear attacks in the future.
An Arab TV reporter who interviewed two plotters of the third attack said yesterday.
Yashri Fuda, correspondent for the satellite station Al Jazeera, told the AP that it was taken blindfolded to a secret location in Pakistan to meet Khalid, Sheikh Mohammed, and Ramzi bin Al-Sheev in June interview and range by Al Qaeda operatives.
Fadah said he waited until not aware of the audio taped interview.
It scheduled to run this Thursday on Al Jazeera because he wanted to include it in a documentary marking the first anniversary of the attacks.
A videotape of Al Qaeda leader, Osama Yamama bin Laden released by US official in December for many established,
why? For many established Al Qaeda's responsibility for 9-11.
According to Fadah's account, Mohammed and bin Al-Sheev spell out the link even more clearly.
US officials regard Mohammed as one of the highest ranking Al Qaeda leaders at large and believe he's still planning attacks against US interests.
US officials say bin Al-Sheev was a member of the Hamburg base, so led by Mohammed Ata, the Egyptian-born suspected lead hijacker, by 9-11.
I am the head of the Al Qaeda Military Committee and Ramzi is the coordinator of the Holy Tuesday operation.
Fadah quoted Mohammed as saying September 11th last year fell on a Tuesday of course.
Mohammed said planning began two and a half years before 9-11 and that the first targets considered were nuclear facilities.
We decided against it for fear of a guetta control. Fadah quoted Mohammed as saying, you don't need to know more than that at this stage.
In any way, it was eventually decided to leave out nuclear targets for now.
Fadah speaking by telephone from London said Al Qaeda operatives told him not to bring any electronic equipment, including a camera or recorder of the interview.
The Al Qaeda members videotape the interview but instead of sending a copy of the video as they promised, sent him only the audio tape.
Fadah said at one point while he was being led blindfolded to the meeting, said he thought he was going to meet with Al Qaeda leader or Samu Yimama bin Laden.
Fadah said during the two days he spent talking to the two, Mohammed once referred to bin Laden in the past tense and that a sense of disarray led him to believe that bin Laden could be dead.
Fadah and Egyptian reporter, host of Al Jazeera's investigative program, Top Secret, said he flew to Islamabad and then to Qorakshia and Al Qaeda instructions.
In Qorakshia, he was taken blindfolded and via a complicated route to an apartment where he met the two many recognized as, will have it and bin al-Shib.
Al Jazeera had announced last week it'll broadcast the interview as part of its coverage marking the anniversary of the attacks against the World Trade Center in Pentagon.
Fadah wrote about the interview for London Sunday Times in a story that appeared yesterday.
He told the AP he accrued the Times to publicize the documentary.
He wrote in the newspaper that during the interviews he learned that the US Congress had been the fourth target.
hijack plane slammed in the well we know that.
Fadah also learned that it had been a sleeper operative in Germany since 1992 and started detailed planning with a 1999 meeting in Afghanistan with other sleepers.
Once in the US, Ata communicated with higher ranking Al Qaeda officials via email Fadah wrote, but when he had determined everything was ready he telephoned bin al-Shib in Germany to tell him the date using a riddle that referred to the shapes of the numbers 9 and 11.
The gutter based satellite station Al Jazeera has drawn world attention with its broadcasts and news with end statements by Osama Yomamah bin Laden and its top loop.
So there you go covering yourselves accordingly.

You're not going to look all over. It's just for 20 or twice to do. You way out.
A lot of people have little boys.
No!
Everyone in office did the same as me. The only difference was they were a little more discreet.
You elected me, your president. Not yours, mate. No matter who you put here, it'll always be the same.
For Washington, the push they all had something on the side, but the press loved it was best to keep it quiet at the time.
And half of them back then, and it never gone the stop. Every president has done the presidential law.
When FDR was given up the brand new deal. Hellenor was given chips the reason to spoil.
He was a little more discreet.
He was a little more discreet.
He was a little more discreet.
Compared to what went on with McKinsey, the girls I had all of that to make you win.
Unless the cause of zone have Peter law for for mob help.
It wasn't a coincidence or just bad luck. That hoover is the name of the vacuum that sucks.
Half of that's them. And it's never gone the stop.
The ever president has done the presidential buff.
When you're the president, you have to ask yourself why not?
The ever president has done the presidential buff.
Kim Starman thinks it's criminal, but I hope it's not.
The ever president has done the presidential buff.
Well, they say it's going to be a week of history of maybe in fact CNN's on a right now.
Search isn't sorrow, remember 9-11. There's more images again.
See television does two things magnificently.
Number one, they exploit human misery and suffering.
And number two, they desensitize the viewer so that after they show it over and over,
it doesn't have any meaning anymore, right?
It's like it's like the puppy snuff tapes, you know?
After the 50 million time they showed it, even the greatest of us dog lovers,
it had no meaning anymore. And of course I wouldn't watch it more than once anyway.
But if you did, it just had no meaning.
And the same thing would have plans crashing into the twin towers and into the Pentagon.
All you know what? We don't see the Pentagon because I guess we don't have that footage.
Right. And that's small potatoes.
And that's small potatoes anyway. It's only like, you know, on the outside of the wage.
What was it, 2,300 people died there?
Which I noticed that nobody talks about that about anybody who died of the Pentagon.
But nevertheless, moving right ahead, like I said,
desensitizing the viewers and if they show you something over and over again,
it's like the thing with the dead little kids, all these, you know,
not that they were into that big time.
Right.
I mean, these acts are so grotesque and so unacceptable,
and yet because it's on television, oh, do you know what I'm saying?
You know? Let's see if we can find out more about it.
Let's see if we can go into a feeding frenzy about it.
But the public accepts it.
Don't get excited. Just stay calm. Don't get all carried away.
See, I have a tendency when I start talking about that to get aggravated.
Because they said you, they peddle you this idea that somehow,
this is the way the world is supposed to be.
And yet what they should be doing, and that is exposing the insanity of religious fanaticism,
which is what 9-11 was all about, and continues to be,
they don't want to deal with that because it's not going to prevent this.
Bush's father feared expanded role in Iraq by Walter Pink as Washington Post staff writer
and yesterday's Washington Post.
Four years ago, former President George Herbert Walker
Bush wrote that there was unanimity within his administration that the 1991 Persian Gulf War
should end once the forces of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's had been driven from Kuwait.
Remember all the calls we had from those right ones?
Yes. All in all, with the Democrats in Congress, wouldn't let them continue.
They would not authorize the right.
Those wits, those voices.
That's right. Those appeasers.
If he had sent US military forces on the back of that,
Bush asserted in the 1998 book he wrote with Brent Scowcroft,
his national security adviser.
The US could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land.
That's the same Brent Scowcroft, by the way, who for the last two weeks,
has been raiding against this Bush administration and saying that we absolutely have no reason to invade Iraq
and would be a grotesque mistake.
Trying to eliminate Saddam, extending the ground war into an occupation of Iraq,
would have violated our guideline about not changing objectives in mainstream,
engaging in mission creep, and we would have incurred inculubable human and political cost
Bush wrote in the book titled, A World Transform.
As the administration of President Bush intensifies its efforts to commence Congress,
the American public and US allies need to confront Hussein again.
It's also looking at how a policy on Iraq evolved within the first Bush administration 11 years ago.
In response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990,
the UN Security Council let November authorize the use of force to drive the Iraqis out,
but did not make a change of government in Baghdad and part of the package.
President George Herbert, W. Bush and his aides, informally decided that,
although removing Hussein would be beneficial,
that goal would not be part of US policy unless the Iraqi President used chemical
or biological weapons against US or coalition troops or neighboring countries such as Israel, he did not.
Months before the war began in January 1991, while Pentagon planners were still at work,
the White House had discussed the question of Hussein's future.
At a December 1990 meeting of senior national security officials,
Hussein's removal was set aside according to Scotcroft,
making it a formal goal of the coalition of the United States was assembling for the war
well beyond the bounds of the UN resolution guiding us, he wrote.
If the United States announced such a goal unilateral, he added,
we would be committing ourselves alone to removing one regime and installing another,
and if the Iraqis themselves didn't take matters in their own hands,
we would be facing an indefinite occupation of a hostile state and some dubious nation building.
There also was the problem of maintaining the support of Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia
that were vital to the war.
Bush senior wrote,
we also believe the US should not go at alone,
mounting an effect of military counter-duel warx invasion required the backing and basins of Saudi Arabia and other Arab states.
On February 26, 1991, two days after the US and coalition troops began,
their successful ground offensive to free Kuwait. Bush wrote in his diary,
we would declare an end once I was sure we had met all of our military objectives
and fulfilled the UN resolutions.
The following day after the Defense Secretary Richard V. Cheney,
oh, could that be the same one?
Reported that the southern part of Kuwait was free and that military operations would halt that day of the next.
US television screens were filled with pictures of US aircraft,
artillery and tanks pounding Iraqi units fleeing North and Kuwait city to the southern Iraqi city of Basra.
The carnage had an effect on the White House,
we had all become increasingly concerned over impressions being created in the press about the highway of death from Kuwait city to Basra,
Skokraft Road.
In the Oval Office that afternoon, Bush asked his advisors including Cheney and General Colin Powell,
then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, if it was time to stop, they decided it was.
There was no descent, Skokraft Road.
Not even from Dick, how do you like that?
Bush later wrote that Robert M. Gates who was deputy national security adviser at the time told him,
we crushed their 43 divisions, but we stopped, we didn't just want to kill and history will look on that kindly.
There had been a secret plan drawn up by the Army's chief operations officer to seize Baghdad,
according to a book by Michael Gordon and General Bernardi, trainer published in 95,
the plan was circulated after the war ended.
While it raised the possibility of a decisive victory, it also opened the door to a protracted occupation in Iraq,
which was not the kind of war that power or general Norman Schwartzkopf wanted they wrote.
Bush and his book laid out other reasons for not sending US forces into Iraq,
many of which are being cited by US informed opponents to a new military offensive.
The coalition would instantly have collapsed, the Arabs, the Zerdingen and Nangir and other allies
putting out, pulling out as well, Bush 1 Road.
Referring to a doctrine first applied by the Reagan administration, Bush 1 noted there was no viable exit strategy we could see,
violating another of our principles.
It was also possible that invading Iraq could lead to a breakup of the country,
which was opposed by Iraq's Arab neighbors as well as by Turkey,
which feared that an independent Kurdish state might be created in northern Iraq, Bush 1 Road.
US intelligence and Arab coalition members had told Bush that defeating Hussein would quickly lead to
being forced out of power that did not happen, instead in uprising among Shiites and southern Iraq was quickly put down
by Iraqi forces, a similar attempt by the Kurds in northern Iraq was also squashed.
Can't you just hear the Bushies now saying, ah, Shiite.
Accused of having encouraged those uprisings, Bush said that although we said removal of Hussein would be welcomed,
his fate was up to the Iraqi people.
The end of that for very practical reasons, there was never a promised way to not uprising.
Cheney, who's taken a lead role as Vice President, pushing for preparation to take military action against Hussein,
played the same role 12 years ago as Defense Secretary.
Bush wrote that months before any operations were launched 11 years ago,
while Secretary of State James Baker III was reluctant to contemplate use of force
and pressing for diplomacy and sanction to get the job done,
Cheney recognized earlier that sooner or later it would come down to force.
Cheney was probably ahead of his own military on this Bush wrote,
while the military did not appear eager to go to war unless other options have been exhausted.
Cheney led the way for the military, leading not pushing the military to understanding and fulfilling,
the mission said for them by the President.
We don't want to say he's a hawk, do we?
What he is.
Heyman Rumi.

I love a hand.
Your is the foreignest person that you'll ever view.

Who's going to be the foreignest person that goes for two or two?
Who's going to be the foreignest person that you'll ever view?
So CNN and dutifully do and just what I've described before in the article from the Toronto Star.
They're discussing reports as Iraq poses nuclear threat and they're showing pictures of them setting the world field on fire from the Gulf War.
And of course those pictures with the gigantic balls of fire looks like nuclear explosions, is it?
No.
In fact I'll tell you something, the scene at the World Trade Center for my year.
That looks more like a nuclear explosion than this did.
Didn't you think so?
Sure, left to crater.
Jeff, what is this?
Is this the inside poop on what's going on in the station?
Yeah, just got to start reporting.
Spy report, Jeff, hi.
Aka fat boy.
Aka, a tub of lard.
Can't close the stall door when he poops.
Oh, oh, man.
I may not be coming back.
Either that or I'm going to tell you one thing.
I'm going to spend the get up an extra hour early in the morning and really evacuate heavy duty.
So to speak, since we brought everything else in here maybe you could get a little stall installed.
Oh, man, I don't want to see that.
I don't want to walk in there to take a leak and have that that handicraft the stall door open.
And him in there in his full reggae and the chair and a hole.
Ah.
Bush ratings down on foreign policy.
Uh-oh.
President Bush is overall rating is slid steadily downward over the summer largely because of a major withering of support in the ways conducting foreign policy two polls.
I'll be finding a CBS news.
New York Times poverly Saturday also found a majority of Americans things Bush lacks a clear plan to carry out his war on terror.
Overall, the poll found that 63% of the way Bush is doing his job while strong for president almost two years on the job.
The number is down three points from the summer 66% rating and down 24 points from his 87% approval rating soon after the attacks of last 9-11.
It found 54% support is foreign policy only two months ago 68% approved this foreign policy and last fall the level stood almost three forts.
Before 9-11 just under half the residents of respondents rather approved this foreign policy performance.
A Washington Post poll published in yesterday's edition found that Bush's approval rating is now 69% down 23 points from the 92% registered by post pollsters in October.
It also found that 70% now approved the way he's managing the war on terrorism down 13 points from July and 22 points from October's high.
The Times CBS poll also found that while almost two out of three field Bush has not explained his position on Iraq sufficiently, Americans generally support his preemptive policy against Sodom Hussein.
Not that they're propagandizing or planning the seeds you understand.
Don't forget go on and pick up the inquire or just take a peek at it.
Pick up the picture on the front cover and then inside page what page 34 through 30 something 36 7.
Oh, patchy ramsy man looks like hell on wheels worse than fat boy but we'll get to that.
This thing you just fact to me.
Yes.
From the Pittsburgh Post Gazette and of course a warmen up for the nights again the patriots and the Steelers.
I got to confess I did call yesterday and I got the NFL package and that embarrassing to admit to that.
Yeah.
I saw a little bit of the dolphins against the little girls teen yesterday and joke and I did see the end of the bills jets game.
I saw quite a bit of that game did not see the end of the Cleveland Kansas City game although it's shown the low light on it about 50 times.
But it's you know it's worth having on the Sunday.
But tonight of course on ABC, Al Michaels who was on the emptying with Mo Cheswick this morning and John Madden make their network debut in a regular season game.
Good pair man.
They got rid of that silly goose.
What did I tell you about Dennis Miller?
Did I tell you forget about him?
Did I tell you that?
Get rid of him.
He's a craft.
I could have saved them a lot of embarrassment with that but they don't ask me.
Anyway, Mark Madden, a relation to John writes in the Pittsburgh, the Post Gazette this past Saturday.
With Jerome Betis accused of sexual assault, the Steelers raised something they certainly don't need as they begin a season filled with so much promise.
And unnecessary distraction.
Forgive me if I take a Greensburg woman's personal tragedy, be it real or perceived and aim lives its relevance to football but this is the sports page.
By being involved in an unseemly situation, Betis has opened himself up to countless cat calls from opposing fans and Steeler fans too if he performs poorly.
Can't wait for the first pooled groin joke.
The situation will be discussed endlessly on talk shows.
I don't presume to judge Betis at government since although this seems like a, he said she said situation with no witnesses and that tends to favor the accused.
But even when you beat the rap in a sex case, Abone remembers that you were involved with something as lazy.
I can't fault Betis for picking up women. He's young single guy. He has for doing so during training camp.
I hope nobody expects all the Steelers to put sex on hold until after the Super Bowl.
That's Draconian he wrote, sending you scurrying predictionary.
There's one thing I do know if I ever feel they need to commit a crime I'm doing it in Greensburg.
Betis is accused of sexually assaulting a woman August 21st. The woman filed a report with police that same night.
The Greensburg police didn't get around to questioning Betis until two days ago.
And only then did so because the Post Gazette came nosing around.
It's not like Betis is hard to find. He's been at the Steelers outside practice complex the past two weeks.
The Greensburg police, by the way, have you ever been into Mountain View winning Greensburg?
Nope. Excellent food.
I actually stayed there one time.
The Greensburg police clearly tried to give Betis the celebrity exemption, perhaps dragging their feet in the hope the alleged victim would drop or complain.
The Greensburg police should have died disguised themselves as members of the sports media and walked around with microphones, cameras, tape recorders and notebooks.
They wouldn't have had the need to look for Betis. He would look for them. He has an addiction to attention.
Betis is vial accounts of very nice guy. But we shouldn't use that as self evidence to assume his innocence or to assume that he's totally incapable of doing anything bad.
When Al Martin played for the Pirates, he was widely hailed as the most affable human being, the cent-foot in a big league clubhouse.
Turns out he was a bigamist who told ball face lies about a fictional college football career.
This doesn't mean Betis is guilty of being a bad human being, much less guilty of any crime.
But it does mean we really don't know what pro-athletes are like.
You can't judge a man by his quotes in the paper or by a soundbites on radio and TV.
And we, as sports cough journalists, can't judge an athlete by the fleeting few moments he or she is a dainst to spend with us.
I would guess this whole incident likely will blow over. No charges have been filed.
And in case without a witness is hard to prosecute. For the discussion and corresponding distraction will outlive the legal matter,
Pittsburgh loves how to rumor much more than cold hard facts. It'll be interesting to see Betis reactants to fans give him a hard time.
Memo to Jerome, a hundred yards against the Patriots guarantee this will not happen.
How do you like that last line there? I'm kind of cute. A hundred yards of my ass Jerome, okay? Up your ass.
Patriots tonight, Tommy Brady, anybody going to be watching? George might even be watching that. I doubt it.
What?
Big game tonight, baby. Monday night football. Are you ready for some football?
Come on, man. Give me the ball. Give me the ball. Are you ready for some football? Remember that call?
Yes. Down on the second floor. This is one of those memorable calls. Almost as memorable as the guy who said,
I can't relate to the people who voted for Gore. Almost as memorable as that and I quite.
Neil, are you ready for some smash mouth? This was some schwarzer. Ready for some smash mouth. M-O-U-F-F-O-O-B-A-L-L.
And I said, no.
T-5 yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter. Push the tech.
How about those Houston Texans? I saw the end of that game, too. Beat up on the Cowboys. And I saw that Jerry Jones on the sideline, man, I hate that son of a bitch.
Anyway, 20 till noon. Am I starting to get in the two football intensive? Yes. We'll get off of that and we'll get on the job. But, ain't this second.
Gotta see the pictures. You won't believe it. And, of course, you would be in the hard-ass son of a bitch that you are. You'll be trolling and truckling at her misery.
Anyway, let me tell you about one person we're reveling in and that's the beast. He looks so much better. Man, he looks almost human underlined the almost part.
He's lost 53 pounds. I bet you by the end of this week when he weighs in again. He'll be, he's starting to get close to 60, you know.
Close to 60, right? No, I'm serious. I bet you by the end of the week, he's edge in toward the 60 pound mark. He's looking pretty dang good for him.

Valence for life puts so much damn food in the little black sack. Some days you might have a hard time finishing it, but that's the idea because it's based on the premise of the principles of the zone diet, the premise and principles.
So you really need to eat all of that food. Three delicious gourmet meals, two delicious snacks, and they deliver it right to your doorstep by six o'clock every morning in that very important little black sack, even a 60-nose bottle water was in there too.
And if you eat all of that food, you'll be amazed at how full it keeps you number one. Number two, how delicious all the food is made with the freshest, the best ingredients you can find anywhere and how fast the weight just pours off.
And they let you choose between two alternatives for each meal every single day that you're on the program too. How long can you afford to be overweight out of shape, lethargic, diabetic, dying is basically what it's all about.

My life and love all this is 4.25.60. You weigh it in weigh.
Oh that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.
Oh my dad knocked me out. He made me when he had me up there.
When I went on the neighbor. I was killed by my daddy. Oh my dad knocked me out.
I was in a dream. It's not a needy of it. I'm a someone who knows.
He beat me and beat me to the mouth. And I should have heard it. He's got me an old, old, no, come around.
So they're gonna let him go. My dad knocked me out. He made me to get up there.
So he's a one who beat it. You'll never hear an ad made it.
My dad knocked me out. I knocked me out.
I knocked him out. I knocked him out. I knocked him out.
I knocked him out. I knocked him out. I knocked him out.
I knocked him out. I knocked him out. I knocked him out.
But for right of branch he'll be shooting again TV that is. Well look at that much later.
We'll have time.
325 votes on a poll. They're pouring in for George or against George or about George.
This is the kind of poll the audience likes. See? Now what's gonna happen Wednesday? They don't give a crap about that.
They don't know anyway. Any more than you know or I know or anybody else.
How do we know what's gonna happen next half hour? For all we know, station could go off the air.
The historic could come in on the internet about the station being sold to entercom.
We don't know. And sure it's how nobody's gonna tell us anything.
Because they lie a lot. That's the nature of the business. They lie through their teeth.
And then of course if the sale does go through then you know Greg will you know stand up there and scratch his head making that.
Well we couldn't make any money with you assholes so we'll see if they can do it. You know that kind of thing.
And of course George has got his fingers and eyes and legs crossed. I don't know why.
You got your good you got a real good ally there in the morning. Feasty.
No. Mocha's week. 325 votes. Remember Mr. Cheswick from Kuku's nest.
I want my cigarette. That's what we got in the morning. Mocha's week is my new name for Mo.
325 votes. How did George do filling in for Neil this summer we asked?
I don't listen when George is on. 118.36.3%.
I think that's about did I say between 30 and 40?
Yes.
When you can't get much more between 30 and 40 than maybe exactly 35.
Excellent job better than ever. 9128%. That's a pretty good endorsement. A ringing endorsement for little George.
And of course keep in mind. Keep in mind speaking of Mo. Shrek, Drak, whatever his name is. Mocha's week.
Then if it was up to him if he would have had his way George wouldn't have been there this summer.
He got only knows what kind of crap you would have. Maybe it had the the algorithm of radio. Joe Zagaki on there.
Excellent job 93 better than ever. Good 60. Okay 34. Week 18 and fear 11.
So if you end up the percentage that's the week and that's 40 so it's like 60 to 40 you're in the lead.
I mean like that. Oh right. Yeah sure what how not.
In addition to what's let me say it again George by keeping 60% of what we got here during the rest of the year.
Sure as hell's got a lot of bigger numbers that they have in certain other day parts.
I don't want to mention any times or day parts or names Mo.
And isn't it convenient he left out the meat of that story to protect his own ass that story with a child Elmore and Palm Beach in a post.
Oh he didn't want to go into the details of course he doesn't want to go into details because he doesn't want to tell a reporter or anybody else in a guy damn world which is why he's pissed off.
He tried to get your little ass fired like an overgrown child. If you don't fire George I'm walking out and that kind of crap.
And then all of a sudden when he lost his gig with Westwood one and Q.A.M. in the doffin thing became his only.
Then all of a sudden he adopted a whole different tune did you notice?
Right I noticed and he hasn't listened since the 3rd of June.
Oh yeah right but gang right stop funny don't forget about that gang right not funny but he hasn't listened since you're and does anybody believe that he's listening right now.
He's got this thing cranked up so loud he can hear the president speaking in the background.
Technology technology that the prime minister and I just saw both see there you go.
Oh by the way they hate I don't know how froggy keeps staying in power here you know Critchin.
Everybody seems to hate him like poison the newspapers the letters to the editor they got billboards all over town here about Critchin just ripping him an ass about what a liar he is and his time has run out and you know and they don't trust the guy who speaks out of one corner of his mouth which means all frog's of course.
John but a cops shred Ramsey alibi new evidence found is Patsy's health fails bursting in a tear is a shattered Patsy Ramsey collapsed in front of relatives after learning newly released police evidence destroys her claims that John but a was murdered by a stranger.
The discovery by cops has made her already failing health even worse disclosed in the cider the former beauty queens downhill slide is shocking as exclusive inquire of photos reveal chemotherapy treatments for advanced liver cancer caused her color chest that brown hair to fall out and the returning stubble is tinged with gray and and stubble is you know as the word.

She seemed flabbergasted that police were still saying the Ramsey's did it family members were frightened she was going to pass out in the midst of her fiery tie raid Patsy already weakened by her ongoing life or death cancer battle completely fell apart.
She started crying collapse the knees screaming I can't take it anymore this is crazy this is crazy will never be free of this disclose the source.
And you know who else want to be free of it who John can a emotional turmoil is extremely hard on Patsy and I witness who spotted her right before the labor day weekend told the inquire she's about 40 she's 45 but looks about 60.
The inquire has learned that Patsy shocking breakdown is just part of a recent pattern of bizarre behavior that clearly indicates she's cracking and possibly even experiencing pangs of guilt.
See insiders and leading mental health experts we discovered that Patsy and amateur artists has been creating a series of eerie paintings and experts we consulted say the shocking surreal creations expose for the first time her highly educated state of mind in one of them Patsy painted all the people she feels about together.
So they family acquaintance not that she's paranoid or anything to understand I understand there is Steve Thomas the former a bolder detective who wrote a book accusing Patsy murdering John but they not to be confused with Stevie Thomas the hockey player who played twice with a police and then a black box.

Anyway here's an editorial in a Boston Globe yesterday insecure airlines. It says the arrest August 29th and Sweden of a man with US flight school experience that's the one who had a pember finds address.
Okay the rest of August 29th and Sweden of a man with US flights will experience trying to carry a handgun onto the plane was just the most recent reminder that airline safety is critical year after 911 and open industrialized country like the US's full of targets for terrorists but the vulnerability of airplanes will always make them especially inviting.
Airlines concerns about passenger impatience with the late should not be allowed to interfere with thorough inspection travelers in their bags. One immediate improvement was the strengthening of cockpit doors.
Some pilots find this inadequate or asking permission to permission to carry handguns but the airlines raise a sensible objective this while we're spending literally billions of dollars to keep dangerous weapons off aircraft.
The heads of 21 airlines wrote to senators the idea of intentionally introducing thousands of weapons in the system appears to be dangerously counterproductive.
Examination of check luggage by explosive detecting machines has improved slightly but airports say they'll have difficulty meeting the December 31 deadline for 100% compliance.
Loginary report to its credit is working to get the devices in place the failure of the federal government and the producers of machines not to ramp up production after 911 has been a signal defeat in the war against terrorism.
The airlines now do a positive matching of bags with passengers. What is it with passengers? I know a company luggage gets on board but poorly written in the globe but only on the first legs of flights the airline's fear that bag matching would cause unacceptable delays on connecting flights although a recent trial in Chicago showed this was not the case matching should be required on all flights.
Arnold Barnett professor of operations research at MIT who specializes in airline safety sees gains since the 11 but says some improvements might be lost because of pressure from the airlines while the airlines spread over the customers they lose to rail or car travel because of security related hassles they should be more worried about the fate of their industry if we security leads to another airline hijacking or bombing.
Excellent point in yesterday's Boston Globe that's right if we have one more the parties over baby they'll all be bust.
Am I right right now be the end.
Central or two way trade or 120 billion US dollar travels the bridge you and him out of here.

the vast majority of the people who craft our border pose Norris to either country to

I'm sitting here.
I'm just, I can't restrain myself.
Were you watching this at all?
No.
A couple of minutes ago during the middle of the break, I only wish we would have been
on the earth at the time.
He started, what he's doing is he's doing his speech and then every now and then he'll
like repeat several sentences in French.
The expression fish out of water was never more appropriate because the bushmeister was
sitting there like off to his right.
And when he started doing the first line in French, W like reached up and scratched the
side of his head.
You know how like Greg is always doing the top of his head.
Would that same like, quizzical like, would that whimsical look on his push like,
huh?
How you want?
Fish out of water, baby.
That's our leader.
Oi!
Erick and Justin, a hot and run and on-hung chads right, Andres Martinez in yesterday's
New York Times.
On September 11th, Al Gore told, I see I wasn't ready for this.
I wouldn't realize this was in here.
On September 11th, Al Gore told Oprah Winfrey under 7 million viewers that Wheaties was his
favorite cereal.
Elsewhere in Chicago, Aubrey Harvey, Jr., 51-year-old supervisor with Argonne Bright
Security, who served at Chicago, well here's United Terminal, was being faded.
He'd just been named the FAA's National Screener of the Year.
No doubt happy to change the subject from the crowded terminals and delays that have made
flying such a nightmare, Jane Garvey, the agency's administrator, had offered this praise
for him three days earlier, maintaining constant vigilance while processing past years
at one of the busiest airports in the world is a tremendous achievement.
With the year 2000, the following year's award ceremony fortuitously would be moved
up to August.
On Wall Street on that last ordinary 9-11, shares of Enron touted by Fortune Magazine as
the nation's most innovative company for five straight years, closed at 86 bucks near
its all-time high.
Poll showed that Florida once thought to be in the pocket of George W. Bush was turning
out to be a toss-up.
Presidential candidates hate playing defense, but when Mr. Bush arrived in Florida on
that day, he did a good job of seeming pleased to say, I plan quite a few visits here.
Meanwhile, Patrick Buchanan, the reform party candidate, was fighting just to get on the
Florida ballot.
Mr. Bush could never have imagined that the successive candidacy would wind up pinching
on a combination of Mr. Buchanan's success in that effort and one county's infamous butterfly-shaped
ballot so peculiar our history's narrative building blocks.
Americans were a rather self-satisfied lot in that seemingly distant fall of 2000.
We had dodged the year 2000 bullet and let's face it, the technology conserves mass plenty
of more apocalyptic millennial anxieties and appeared ready to coast through the second
consecutive American century.
The presidential race reflected that complacency with much of the debate, lock boxes, tax cuts,
new benefits and the rest of it focused on the art of managing the nation's surplus
bounty.
Foreign policy made only a token appearance on the campaign trail.
The stakes seemed so low that more than ever, the voters felt they could focus on candidates'
personalities rather than their experience.
Sure the stock market had fallen from its springtime highs, but most investors couldn't
imagine that they were standing on the edge of a cliff instead of in one of those buying
opportunity dips.
To that come, friends, he might have died down, but proven high growth blue chips like
Enron offered refuge.
The company had recently signed a 20-year deal with Blockbuster to offer movies on demand
over its broadband network and analyzed gosh that within five years telecom bandwidth
trading could generate more revenue than Enron's energy business.
Enron keeps inventing markets, editors at Fortune Magazine Marvel, not knowing the half
of it.
Abby Joseph Cohen, the influential Goldman Sachs strategist, was predicting that the overall
market would start rebounding in November.
The mega merger between JP Morgan and Chase Manhattan announced the week of 9-11 seemed
to indicate that the party on Wall Street was far from over some 2500-anaged Ag points
later now we know better.
Hindsight cast a brooding sense of foreboding under that tranquil fall of 2000.
It's not unlike the ominous foreshadowing that runs through in McEwan's Mastily Portrait
of Life in a grand English manor house on the eve of World War II in Atonement, his
most recent novel, or that historians bring their accounts in the over the Carefree
Summer vacations enjoyed by Europe's Royalty in the summer of 1914.
Americans in that fall of 2000 were poised to suffer three cataclysmic shocks over the
next year that would challenge their sense of invulnerability.
We were about to discover that we could be incapable of resolving a disputed presidential
election without the intervention of a court and that widespread corruption undermined
the integrity of our financial markets.
Worst of all, we would suffer the most devastating attack ever on the U.S. mainland.
Historians looking back will scratch the plastic service and mock our complacency, they'll
make much of A. Hood Baroque's downcast mood as you return home from New York on that
9-11, less than three weeks before a new Palestinian uprising, having stated that the
window of opportunity was closing on the Middle East peace process.
They'll highlight a mountain of study showing how rickety our voting equipment had become
and the diligent efforts of U.S. Commissioner National Security led by former senators
Gary Hart and Ward Rudman to sound an alarm about the dangers of terrorism.
Much tool be made and rightly so of Arthur Levit's efforts to crack down on the conflicts
of interest-based by auditing firms that also provide clients with consulting services.
Mr. Levit and the SEC chairman held public hearings in New York the week of September
11 to promote his proposal to ban such conflicts, but hardly anyone except the industry lobby
has paid any attention to it.
Mr. Levit was ultimately forced to accept the watering down of his proposal.
To look back is to be consumed by a sense of helplessness.
That September in 2000, Mohammed Ottal, ready in Florida, applied a trade in his tourist
visa for a student visa so it could take flying lessons.
Another one of the men would hijack four airliners a year later, Hanne Hanger was granted
his student visa in Saudi Arabia on September 25th so it could attend a language school
in California.
He made it to America but never bothered showing up at the school.
Al Qaeda was about to strike against the Kool and American naval destroyer in Yemen.
Intelligence agencies were reported to obtain a copy of the terrorist organization's
chilling training manual.
It was shared with prosecutors preparing to try in New York and a court were most implicated
in the 1998 bombing of the American Embassy in Africa.
The trial of the following spring set out in painstaking detail Al Qaeda's intentions
and capabilities, but few Americans paid much attention and we couldn't be bothered.
We were coasting for its Andre Martinez in the assidates New York Times.
We were coasting.
Paracquist for terrorist links, Stuttgart.
The only reason I'm using this story is because I like saying Stuttgart, stay together.
Stuttgart, Germany.
Stuttgart.
German investigators have failed to find any links between a pair of rest of unsuspected
planning and attack on the US Army base and the Al Qaeda terror group.
The Turkish man and his American fiancé were detained through his day near Heidelberg,
Southwest Germany, home to a US military base after a tip off from the US authorities.
How's the old Heidelberg doing?
Still open?
Yes.
Remember I was asking about the German restaurants?
Yes you were.
But very invillage and the old Heidelberg.
See how my mind is sharpened up here, eh?
If fear of the peer who had a picture of Osama Yumama bin Laden, the department were planning
a terror attack on the base.
Police also found 287 pounds of chemicals and five pipe bombs as well as a book about
bomb making during a search of the couple's third floor apartment in small town of Waldorf.
But German and tear minister Otto Schiele said no evidence existed that they'd been recruited
by the terror network, blamed for the 9-11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
Based on what we know so far, we're dealing with an individual who's shown no indication
to participation in terrorist network.
It was quoted by the APS telling antenna, Bayer and Radio.
It seems we're dealing with a dangerous individual with an Islamic background.
Oh not again.
Federal prosecutors are reviewing the evidence set in a statement.
It must be clarified whether the male suspect acted alone, whether they two acted together,
whether they planned the terror attack in Heidelberg as members of a terrorist organization.
The pair have been named as Oman Padmetsi, 25, worked at the chemical warehouse in Carl
Schru and Astrid Azagiri, EYZAG, Azagiri, 23, who had a job at a base store.
She would have had access to many facilities at Campbell-Verris, which is under the U.S.
U.S. U.F. headquarters.
The Army's fifth-correct headquarters in NATO facility.
It's not clear how dangerous the chemicals found might have been as police didn't reveal
what kind they were.
Why don't we just store it up like a squirrel store up nuts?
Right.
Then everybody with a brain store up their nuts?
369 votes on a poll today, so far as the votes are pouring in here.
How did George do filling in for Nielis Summer?
For whatever reason, we always get a lot of votes on this.
You know what every year?
I don't know.
Well, because you're a controversial guy, I guess.
I don't listen when George is on.
129, 34.9% is dropped under 35 for the first time.
How do you like that?
I like it.
Well, of course, don't count.
You're a...
I don't know.
Before your squirrel hatches, this is really important though.
What do you mean by that?
It doesn't much job hang on this?
No, it hangs out with our mole.
It has another snit.
Oh, that's more...
Cheswick.
I know.
Listen, when George is on 129, excellent job.
Better than ever.
105, 28.4%.
That's pretty good.
That's a pretty good ringing endorsement, you know what?
I'll take it.
Good.
65.
OK.
40.
So yeah, those up you got 44.
Right there is 55%.
Week 18 and fair is all the way up to 12.
So that's...
There's the result so far.
Speaking of elections, don't forget tomorrow.
Election day.
State County vote no on 242.
The last thing...
Forget about me being a fact.
The last thing that State County needs is more...
I need a bride embarrassment.
I mean, let's face it.
And if even even Mayor Penga Pakenia is out there campaigning...
Even though he doesn't know what he's talking about.
If even he is opposed to these far-biscina...
Like this armistok, Gonzalez Rodriguez Schwartz...
Bitch, whatever her name is.
I wish you had seen that without you.
I did too, but it made me say that.
Oh, you know something?
Oh, no.
I'm going to have to go into my garbage.
You want to know why?
Why?
I'll do it there in the break because on the back...
You know how sometimes there are good stories on the back of both pages.
On the back of the Rosie's story, there was a thing about O'Donohue.
O'Donohue.
Uh-huh.
Rose O'Donohue.
And the fact that there ain't nobody watching the show and he's in great jeopardy.
And he's so desperate.
He wants to get Michael Jackson on with him.
And this one, that please don't.
Please...
He's desperate.
Desperate.
It's not about you.
It's not about you.
You want?
It's not a bad show the times I remember watching.
Uh...
I don't know.
I like to play.
I'll tell you one thing.
It's certainly no Bill O'Reilly.
It sure doesn't beat that one out of that.
Unfortunately, Bill O'Reilly is beating the crap out of him because there's a lot of right-wing assholes out there.
And a lot of very naive people who are buying the showbiz thing.
Who think it's a real show?
Right.
Who thinks that O'Reilly actually is a person of substance and is opposed to just a psychotic ego.
Who makes it up as he goes along and never has any facts to write?
Hey, forget about that.
Yeah, we don't care about that.
See, because basically that's what it boils down to.
Most people don't care about the substance.
They only care about the style.
You know, that line sell the sizzle?
Right.
Well, that's what it's all about.
And he gets on there and he pontificates any interrupts.
And oh, they'll confuse me with the fact that now you're wrong.
You're...
You know, because it's all about him.
And there are a lot of schmucks out there who like Fox News because they like the...

What do you say?

Oh, driving classics and how about we throw a screen in there too?
Oh, please, can't have it.

donny you secret plan to save a show see i told you i'd find it
i was searching for it i was scouring and i found it all right
filled on he was desperately seeking wacko jacko
and other big time celebrities to pump up his pathetic talk show ratings
we tell you what his ratings are
even worse than moe uh... uh...
chesswork
we're talking the biggest names in show business section politics people like
michael jackson
and in a cool smith and bill clinton says an industry source
to help with his liberal philosophical talk
film those he needs to put a spark into his show he's got a secret plan to do
it fast
and he better do it fast
fewer than a hundred thirty six thousand people nationwide
tuned in to see the former talk show kings new msnbc get best on a new
that translates into a pathetic
point one the elson rating
that's a kind of waiting we had on whammy
and we're that actually
so yeah but this is nationwide nearly as low as you can get
by comparison donna who's arch rival bill or riley don't confuse me with the
facts are highly
grab one point one million viewers during the same time period on fox news
so one point one million against hundred thirty six thousand
fills not going to sit by what someone like a riley thump of notes the
source
but he realizes he needs a little help at this point yeah more than a little
he knows he needs to make a big splash to get noticed again
and he's got a lot of surprises in store
donna he was sixty six change the face of date time tv in sixty seven when his
first talk shoot they've a shoe they've you didn't take no higher
the film donna he shows him went into syndication floors for nearly three
decades
ending its run in nineteen ninety six
but after the six year hiatus he now finding regain a foothold in the
form and he practically invented
fill his desperate says another tv insider he can't last long with his ratings
in the toilet
but the guys the legend who feels he can pull things out when it out pull it
out
he's scrambling to call in some favors and will come up with big controversial
names who will walk in viewers
but he better act fast because he be exact so even shorter on patients than
fill is on viewers there's no telling how much time he's got left
on the air
i don't like that the way desperate
please don't do it so maybe he can get glory all right on there
and that bitch from court tv and see uh... grace

time because they don't care about canada but
i always told you that the biggest problem in this country is that the
canadians have this inferiority complex and they just can't they not only can't
get over but they can't stop talking about it
there's a word that
under on the words as u.s. makes urgent calls for war in the pictures of
kind of these are chanien pal and rumsle
only twenty percent say canada has distinct culture

broward including that spectacular outstanding location

there's one school that's got certified Microsoft instructors
convenient to even weekend classes is one school that's got full-time placement
department over thirty years experience so they really know what they're doing

Oh, gay guys got your back.
Remember that?
That's where we're looking for love.
It's where you're track back.
The better shall buy me, F.A.G.
I got lots of facial hair, then a lezzy.
That'll make fun.
Don't poke your nose at the queer, gay boy, lifestyle, like Joe.
Stop your gay jokes and start being silent
because you might get a taste of home with sexual violence.
We don't play your butt's much harder like a dog in a stair drawer.
Don't keep your mouth shut.
But when you see us with our Ray Bans bomb, we're just fine in the park.
And we want to get our hands on.
We're the F.A.G.
That's her.
Ooh, we don't have a traitor.
Don't you forget it.
We're the F.A.G.
Really all the hardest swallows.
We just are taking family.
Let me see you just prance with me.
Just prance with me.
Now slide.
Ooh, right there.
Let me see you do some white bandage.
Oh, perfect.

Just ugh.
Whoa.
Now look what you went and did.
Ugh, I got a white dissolve.
Oh, jeez, this is everywhere.
Let go.
Does anybody have a moist towel?
F.A.G.
Okay, look.
Come to the crowd.
You're no duty garland.
So anyway, here's a facsimjo in Miami who says rumor has it that Fred Phelps will be in town tomorrow to pick it.
Hallelujah and pass the offering.
But you know Fred Phelps?
Yeah, I know who that is.
That crazy bastard from Kansas, the Reverend Fred Phelps.
Of course, homophobic people.
The funerals of AIDS people and all this stuff.
Homophobic champion of the universe.
Fred Phelps.
He'll be in town tomorrow.
And by the way, just because the poll in the Herald says it's this or it's that, let me point out again.
Right.
Back in 77 because I lived through it.
The referendum, the polls were all even Steven.
And it got trounced.
So don't get too cocky if I can say that.
Can I say that?
No.
All you fags out there.
Don't get too cocky.
Better go out and vote.
Two, three, four times a piece tomorrow.
Just to make sure.
Anyway, here's one from Julia in Miami who said that you check out QD Pie, Hunk David Carr, quarterback of Houston Texas.
I certainly did.
Julia?
Excellent choice.
Way cuter, better cuter than Brady.
She says, I'm sorry, but you were doing real well until you get to that point.
See, David Carr is, he's pretty damn good, but his nose is like, like he ran into a wall or something.
You know what I'm talking about?
I know you guys have like a flat, mushed down like a puddle.
A little bit, not real bad, but a little, uh, he's no Tom Brady.
He's okay though.
Believe me.
Tonight you get to see Tom Brady.
Stark naked on ABC.
By the way, I'd like to point out that L Michaels, who was on and how he was yucking it up.
With Mo Cheswick this morning, yucking and yucking and yucking.
Guess who's one of, uh, L Michaels close to buddies and co-workers for many, many years on ABC when they were doing throwback racing?
Okay.
That we talked to, uh, three times a year.
Dave Johnson.
Right. There you go.
I just mentioned that in passing.
Oh, is he one of yours?
Speaking of Donnie, who would says read this, dammit.
This was a really good show with mutual information about Jeb.
And I don't know what they want me to read because that's all I got.
That's all you facts me.
Is there more to it?
No, that was it.
Well, what does that mean?
I don't know.
Speaking of Donnie, you read this, dammit.
This was a really good show with mutual information about...
Oh, that transcript thing that I really, I didn't mean to send you the first page of that.
Oh, it's another way to do more.
It's another way to do more.
Well, the fact that you can sift through it.
Okay.
Oh, and that's a long thing?
Yeah, it's a long thing.
How many pages?
Five.
Ah!
Save it for a little later.
Save it for tomorrow.
I don't have time to embark on something like that right now.
And it kind of cut off in places.
Well, like I said, look, take a look at it.
Because this is much more important, speaking of the election tomorrow,
what bushes aren't, McBride is, writes Dan Muffet in the Palm Beach Post, which, like I said,
got some pretty good news and editorial things, but this fourth section blows always.
He says, eight years of Bill and Hillary gave the nation a bad case of Clinton fatigue.
Now, the first symptoms of bush fatigue can be detected.
Do you know that even Kathy Willett suffered from bush fatigue after a few years?
Is that what she shaved it off?
Yes.
It says, how else to explain the rise of Bill McBride?
In the span of several weeks, Mr. McBride has made the improbable transition from obscure, long-shot candidate
for governor to surging campaigner who draws hyperbole from across the state and across the country.
US representative Robert Weissler, Democratic Del Rey Beach, went so far this week as to call him,
the future of the Democratic Party.
Analysts now say that if he can defeat Janet Reno in tomorrow's primary, it will mark the greatest upset and floored a political history.
Mr. McBride's name, which was a little known outside Hillsborough County a month ago, now appears in front page headlines
and leads the evening news.
The White House is concerned that a loss in Florida's gubernatorial race could be interpreted as a test of the president's prospects for winning reelection in 2004,
the Boston Globe set in a recent article about Republican ads targeting Mr. McBride.
In probable ascension such as this are creatures of timing and context, Mr. McBride is a 57-year-old newcomer who has come to the right place at the right time.
With bush fatigue palpable, both in Tallahassee and in Washington, Mr. McBride offers an allure that is largely biographical.
Next to nothing about Mr. McBride's background resembles that of Jebs or W's, the stark contrast of his life's threat with other than bushes has captured the effect of Democrats.
They relate at an organic level.
They see him as a good counter to which bush he and evil inherit virtue for every intrinsic flaw, a McBride yin for every bush yang.
In Bill McBride they believe they found their anti-bush.
It begins with origins.
Mr. McBride grew up North West of Orlando in Leesburg, son of an Air Force vet, who went through electronics school on the GI Bill and fixed TVs for a living.
Governor Bush and President George W are products of Connecticut affluence groomed for public office from an early age and transplanted into popular states to extend a political dynasty.
Mr. McBride attended public schools and through a, the way he found that football, player and exceptional students, worked his way through the University of Florida, waiting on hotel tables.
The bush's attended private schools, though Jeb went to the University of Texas and never worried about paying the next tuition bill.
When the Vietnam War came, Mr. McBride left law school and volunteered for the Marines. He became an infantry leader, graduated first in the class from the Army Ranger School and in Vietnam, he earned the bronze star for valor.
The bush has spent the war years protecting Texas.
When Mr. McBride left the service and returned to Florida, no empty desk in the family business was waiting.
There was no family fortune to spend on drilling oil wells, no family connections to a career in real estate.
Mr. McBride worked his way up at Holland at night, rising the managing partner.
When it came time for Mr. McBride to marry, he found an independent professional woman with a career at least equal of his own, Alex Sink, the former president of Bank of America, Florida.
They sent their kids to public school and became locally renowned for specific activism.
There was a folklore about him that's distinctly Floridian and impossible to invent or import from other places.
When he was 10, he cut his hand with a machete, yet played that night in a little league all-star game for Leesburg.
He homeworked and ran the bases, bleeding as he crossed the plate.
As they're running back for Leesburg High School yellow jackets, Mr. McBride earned the nickname Carabou for his 6.3 frame and bruising inside runs.
Florida coach Ray Graves caused us during the town of 15,000 residents.
When he showed up at McBride's house to recruit him, Mr. McBride's gear career ended quickly.
However, when he tore up his knee during one of those first practices, he could have kept his football scholarship and elected to give it back.
Coach Graves said the freshman told him that because he couldn't contribute, it wasn't right to keep it.
All the qualities that die-hard Democrats find offensive about the Bushes that privilege the sanctum only, the faux service, the success by endowment, the bravery bright by proxy,
are reflected in opposite to Mr. McBride, a self-made Floridian.
Biography matters in this race for governor.
Bill McBride is the anti-Bush that Republicans have reason to fear.
How do you like that?
Says Dan Moffat in Fridays of Palm Beach Post.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.
How do you like them, apples, huh?
I had no idea.
Well, you know, a bit more about Bill McBride.
Now that you're going to like Go out and vote for him 20 or 30 times tomorrow.
I mean, Janet, like I said, he's a good guy, but, you know, let's not...
Seriously, let's not get carried away.
She couldn't win a one-horse race.
And just...
I am all.
This is 420 of bikes to keep.
2 way out.

You and I have a hell no fear.
We've got a great leader here.
With President's thumbs s***.
I'm 301 thinkin' what when he starts fracturing the sky of his head when it's froggy.
His pretzels started talkin' in French.
And you just had to see it.
And you look at that and said, oh man, this is scary.
In fact, I see so many similarities between him and somebody else.
You know who that is?
No.
Let me give you one clue.
Great.
Yeah.
I think it could be the same person.
Have you ever seen it two of them together?
No, no.
Look at this.
George is like really peeling into that thing now.
You're looking at it?
No, there it is.
How did George do in filling in for Neal this summer?
Less than a turd.
You were like hurtin' earlier.
440 people.
Now that you mentioned it, they'll come back.
No they won't.
446 vote.
Well, I mean, I gotta give the thing.
Go ahead.
What do you want me to do?
Just to not talk about it?
Mm-mm.
Four hundred and forty-six votes.
I don't listen when George is on 147.
32.9% sliding a hair under a third.
Excellent job.
Better than ever.

Look at that.
I didn't even realize that.
Almost even Stephen.
Good.
75.
Okay.
44.
Uh-huh.
Week 21 and fair 13.
I'm, you know, I made a list here, speaking of President
Dumpishman.
I made a list of why we went up with presidents like that.
Okay.
Since 1972.
Now, Humphrey of course ran in 68 and he lost because he didn't,
you know, he didn't disavow via NAMATIL.
It was too late, you know, but LBJ.
But the government in 72, Jimmy Carter in 76,
actually won, which was shocking.
Walter Mondale, Michael DuCaca and Al Gore.
So if you take Bubba out of there in the two terms that he won,
uh, that's what.
There's the answer for you.
What a, what a group of listless,
come, the whole group combined.
I got the personality of Joe Zagaki on a bad day.
Pathetic.
New terror threat to US question mark as CBS news.
US intelligence and law enforcement agencies have detected increased chatter
or communications between known out-cut operatives.
Senior officials have told CBS news correspondent Jim Stewart.
The official described video chatter is terrorist,
electronic and internet intercept.
Some of which are in the form of morale booster messages like
state tune, good news is on the way.
Some suggest targets in the United States,
others say overseas.
Much of the increased chatter is taking place in Afghanistan.
It began to spike in volume earlier this week.
They suggest an impending attack against the West
and it's allies both in American overseas,
but contain no specifics as usual.
It may possibly be related to the September 9th anniversary of the
assassination of Afghanistan of a Northern Alliance leader,
which is like today.
The threat is non-specific and official say the increased communications is less intense
than a spike that occurred around July 4th, but it's still intense.
It is similar, but not quite as serious as the chatter picked up around last July 4th said one official.
It was enough, however, with the four-day Pentagon,
to immediately resume 24-hour-deck combat air patrol over Washington and New York,
something they hadn't planned on doing until next this week's Wednesday.
This, the technicals caused US officials to resume combat air patrol for an indefinite period,
as well.
The US Embassy in Kabul has been buttoned up.
And of course, we know that they keep reminding us that the messages we intercepted last year on 9-10.
Yeah.
About tomorrow is like D-Day and tomorrow is Yadi Yadi.
There were like two separate messages, but they weren't decoded until 9-12 that they after.
And you want to know one of the reasons they had difficulty decoding them?
I give up. Why?
Not enough Arabic speakers.
Now, wouldn't you think if this country forget about which administration, because they're all guilty,
wouldn't you think that if we were serious about combating terrorism, every terrorist group on the list,
I'm talking it not domestic, you know, the skinheads, I'm not talking about them,
international terrorist group, almost every single one of them is from some Arabic country, okay?
And wouldn't you think that if we were serious about fighting terrorism that maybe,
just maybe we would have recruited more people to speak fluent Arabic?
No, you're just being silly.
And if we're like working on decoding those messages, doesn't it help if we understand what they mean?
Well, I mean, no, I realize I'm getting radical now.
I'm getting carried away.
You're right, it's back up to 33.1%.
I won't mention it again until the end of the show.
It's coming up on 10 before 1 at 5.60, WDQ, and we got the hysterical out of me, wow.
I'm sure he'll remind you that they beat up on a little girls' team yesterday.
They'll get too carried away.
And of course, the idea of having a game in the middle of a Jew holiday,
and then playing a little girls' team for the opening,
that's why they couldn't sell it out, and the channel was a channel seven Fox,
had a bite their main tickets to get on on TV,
another embarrassment for South Florida, but that'll teach them, I guess.
I'll tell you guys, I can teach you a lot about life,
and that's my good friend Tom Lehman, that at Halibh Pani, at GMC.
They're doing it again, that's what Bob Eisenberg tells me.
0% financing is continuing right as I speak.
Get yourself 0% financing up to 60 months with approved credit from GMAC,
or it's your choice.
Take up to $4,000 rebate.
We're on select 2002 Paniacs, or GMC models in stock.
You can't beat the deals at Halibh with a stick,
and why do they be sure to take a look at the line?
A complete line of GMC gas guzzling SUVs, including the Onvoi,
voted by Motor Trends SUV, the Earpluss,
see the all-new Paniac vibe SUV, it's got the power of a sports car,
and probably guzzled gas like crazy, just like your SUV.
Yeah.
You know, my microvec gets like on a highway 25, 26 miles,
around town, around 20, but they don't sell
Crovettes at Halibh Paniac.
Halibh also has a dependent selection of pre-owned cars,
trucks and sport utility vehicles, that you can depend on.

60 he'll be along in just a couple minutes after the sports update we don't have like news at the top of the hour
We don't believe in news on this station. The only news that's worth hearing about is sports news like the U of M beat up on another
Marginal school over weekend by 100 points and the dolphins beat up on little girls team by 200 points yesterday
Let's hear it. Oh, because I'm sure that everybody in South Florida feels better about themselves now
And then of course we want to get the screw this morning. I come in. There's no audio feed
Did you guys see clearance at all? I saw him well, did you pass along the message?
I mentioned it to us. We got these guy Dan football games every weekend
Everybody has to dick around with his dick around and I want to get in dick, okay?
Which quite frankly on a Monday morning that early. I'm not too crazy about getting dick
Anyway, speaking of that the whole country is getting dick because it all blood the blood stem cells
We're unable to transform into other types of tissue cells in a Stanford University study
Raising new doubts about the eventual value of the cells in the treatment of disease
The findings supports the view that embryonic stem cells not adults themselves
All for the most promise for treating conditions such as heart disease
Spinal injury thigh-abetes and Parkinson's disease some researchers say
But many people including president George W. Bush
Opposed using human embryonic stem cells in medical research because it involves the death of an embryo
The Stanford researchers attended to race the evolution of blood stem cells after placing them singly into mice
Whose bone mirror had been destroyed the hope was that the study would show how a single blood-making cell would grow into millions of cells
Including perhaps cells of another tissue to the body instead said Amy Wagers first author of the study appearing this week in the journal
Science the group found that blood stem cells replenished the bone mirror
But made almost no other types of tissue cells
Wage you said the study strongly suggests that blood stem cells make only one thing blood
Making skin neurons muscle or liver cells as some researchers have reported from such stem cells is an extremely rare event
That probably would not be useful in the treatment of disease
So once again embryonic stem cells are what we need and those of you with diabetes like me or Parkinson's or other diseases
We have to wait until we have somebody in there who isn't like in the pocket of all those good right wing Christians
Oh, that's right. I forgot we have this bias against Christians in the meeting now. That's what governor
That's right. Thank you
That's right me and all the other people would have brain
Who don't want your anyway?
Here's the final total before we leave today because this is a very important poll today the future of the show depends on it doesn't it?
How come it is pulled no done and all depends on whether a mole wants in chess with gets all been out of shape again
Maybe he'll call up Charles Zomber and like giving the rest of that story. What do you think no chance?
Because even he would be too embarrassed to admit that the whole snip was about him trying to get you fired over a bunch of silly
Childish emails even more would be too embarrassed for that
But don't forget I'm bad and the mad dogs bads him for his bad westwood one they're bad their classes
And it's the whole world against Mocha's way, baby. He want his that whatever it is he wants what is he want?
473 votes on a pool. How does a George how did George do filling in for Neil this summer? How do we be doing?
I don't listen when George is not 161 back to 34% I think you're right
Excellence job better than ever 153 just changing again good
76 okay 46 week 23 and fair 14 mad dog by the way give you very high marks. I love him
Huh? No, seriously when I was down there he came in and there went out of his way to say I tell you one thing
But George did a sensational job this summer man. Oh man does he give good head?
