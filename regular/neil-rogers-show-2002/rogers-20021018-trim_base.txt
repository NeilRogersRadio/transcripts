WQAM, or 86C, but WMCA,
Roby Young is on air.
That alone is well worth playing it.
Jack Specter, Arlan Specter,
Varshan Specter, WLS 42, WFU-N 39,
which is not all that good.
I don't know.
See, I wasn't here when FU-N was playing rock.
In fact, when I came here,
I think WN was, FU-N was already off the air,
were they not?
Now, maybe they were on.
Because I know that WFU-N went off the air briefly,
and then WNWS went on on that frequency on 790.
Isn't that amazing?
It went dead, it went dark.
And we went on the air with a signal
that you could hear like in about 10 blocks,
WNWS on Flagler Street.
But anyway, that's ancient history.
Old news.
WNBC had 25 vote, KDKA 20,
and Wendy King, or pissed off, they didn't do better than that.
CKLW17, I said,
CKLW, Mocansung.
17 votes?
Should add more than that.
CKLW is dynamic.
But like I told you, why is that?
What's the reason that so many of the people
who came here from the Midwest,
they wandered up on the West Coast of Florida?
Is it because they came down?
Yeah.
I-75 was opposed to I-95.
I don't think so.
I've taken too long to drive over to this side.
I see.
No, seriously, I don't understand it.
The people from New York and the Northeast,
most of them came to the East Coast of Florida,
and the people from the Midwest,
like from Ohio and Michigan,
they went to the West Coast of Florida.
I don't understand that.
But anyway, that CKLW just should have had a lot more than that.
WNSS, New York, wins 10-10 at 16.
We left off Cliff and Dallas, K-L-I-F, and KFWB,
but couldn't have more on there.
WAP, the big ape in Jacksonville at 13.
WMCA at 13.
Home of the good guys in New York.
Wo-Wall and Fort Wayne had 12.
WBZ and Boston 12.
Should have had a lot more than that.
Chum and Toronto had 12.
Let me say it again, Gell-D.
Rochester is not a Buffalo suburb.
Talk about the things you know something about, okay?
Don't be talking about Buffalo suburbs and how it is
and some of the suburbs are really nice.
Now, there are no nice suburbs in Buffalo.
Buffalo blows.
Buffalo sucks, okay?
Orchard Park for Donia DePue, Hamburg.
It all blows.
Buffalo is a toilet.
It's a sewer.
And Rochester ain't no suburb of Buffalo.
That's like saying, oh, you know those Toronto suburbs
like Buffalo?
I mean, what does that mean?
You know, the Miami suburbs like Daytona Beach.
Gell-D get a compass in a road map, sweetheart.
And you know, there's a big hockey story going on.
I'm not gonna hear about it on an ad show.
Steven Weist is great prospect.
This youngster in the organization is gonna be
one of these superstars of the future.
He started the season with a team.
Story was, my keen and was gonna send them down to
juniors for the rest of the season and Rick Dudley,
the general manager over rules him and says,
hey, guess what, Steven, you don't go anywhere.
Forget about my keen and he's an asshole.
And so, Stevie Weiss is still with the team
who lost again by the Wednesday,
Kago last night, four to one, pretty dismal performance.
But anyway, that's quite a big story there.
I didn't hear nothing about it, did you?
No.
On this morning show, I heard a lot of talk
about New York Prime restaurant there
and how they ought to go there and meet Hank.
I heard Gell-D throw that coming.
And like it's a big joke.
I hate to break the news, Gell-D.
Hank don't fight at humorous.
You know what I'm saying?
You don't fight at even slightly amusing
all those shots at New York Prime.
I've never been there, but have we had a lot of calls
about what a great place that is?
Yeah, we had.
Yeah, over the years.
And that we should go.
And we should go.
In fact, maybe we'll go all the way up there.
We can go to Ruth Kriska, that would be free, see.
And New York Prime would probably be free too.
I just, I don't know, I'm just not interested
in going to Boka.
Who don't want to go to Boka?
Not me.
It's a long schlep.
Yeah, it is.
I don't even prefer freeing.
You know what?
I don't even like going all the way to the Coral Springs.
Which is a damn good thing.
My close personal friends, the rumors moved to Davy.
Even though they have all those barnyard animals
chasing them around up there.
But now you can see him so much more often.
Not necessarily.
I don't like going to Coral Springs.
I hate it up there.
I don't want to say I hate it.
It's just a good way to get there.
Now, that's not just that.
No, I can go right up to 75 and be there in five minutes,
but that's not the point.
I just, there's something about Coral Springs
that leaves me cold, you know?
Is it the punks?
Punks are part of it, yeah?
But it's just like everything Coral Springs looks the same.
You know what I mean?
I get lost there because everything looks the same.
It's just one little strip shopping center
after another one, you know?
Big sprawl.
Doesn't have any character like, you know, like plantation.
10 after 9 at 5.60 WDQM.
Happy Friday to you.
We're biting our time until Monday, baby.
I'm going to tell you this building is so tight
it might explode.
You can smell the aroma in the hallway.
I thought, Mom, I should brought an extra bag
to there or something when I walked in the door.
And you could smell it all up and down the hall.
It's the pressure from the summer book
coming on Monday.
We'll have the numbers 11.30 in the morning
between 11.30 and noon.
What are you cold in there?
A little bit.
It's really nice in Tulio or Georgia.
It used to be that was the cold room
and this was the hot room because of the way
that the vents blew heavy duty in there.
Yeah.
Now that it's balanced, I hear there's a lot of blowing going on.
11 after 9 at 5.60 WDQM.
Mattress shopping.
Awaste the time if you do it the old fashioned way.
Don't be old fashioned just like us.
Yeah.
In fact, even if you're an old funny, dirty like me,
you don't have to do everything old fashioned.
Pick up the phone and do it with a new fangirl
way by making one easy phone call

I am Lord.
This is Sports Radio Flight Safety.
You way, yeah.
There's a butt-ass smell in the listen to the show.
And one of the morning hosts was carbon up a restaurant
that I think is terrific.
He was talking about how he had gone
to this restaurant in Fort Loretale,
the steakhouse, Jackson's, which is, I've never been there.
I've been to Burton Jax, which is now closed.
But he was saying how great it was.
And that for some reason, he took a shot at New York Prime.
I'm going to tell you something.
That's in Boca.
I'm going to give them a make-good because he said
that the services bad and they try to rush you out of there.
Maybe they just didn't kiss his inflated ass or something,
you know?
I mean, some guys who are well-known,
they like to go on a restaurant where people
fawn over him.
If they don't get that, they get unhappy with the place.
I'm going to tell you something.
I have been to that place probably a half dozen times.
I know a lot of people who go there,
the restaurant's fantastic.
And I will go out on a limb and tell you,
it's the best steak sauce you can get anywhere,
South of Peter Lures, and anybody who would knock that restaurant
has got the problem.
The restaurant is not the problem.
You know, we've never been there before together.
Well, we'll go anytime you want to,
and you can tell me if I'm right or wrong.
OK.
That place is fantastic.
It's where, and you know what?
It's not that far.
If you left from here, it's less than the 45-minute ride.
It's right.
It's right in my corner park.
So he doesn't say anything.
I'm not saying it's better than the other place,
because I haven't been to the other place.
I'm just saying that didn't deserve to get knocked.
Now, maybe he had a bad experience there.
Maybe they didn't want him around that long, you know.
It's maybe he was a pain in the ass, you know,
and they said, let's get this guy out of here,
get him served and get him on a road.
If there's a butt, I smell it.
917 at 560, W.C.
I just changed the pool.
You want to know why?
Why?
I was inspired to change it, because they
showed a clip of El Presidente,
and guess who was standing behind him.
The caption was, administration softens tone
toward the U.N. and the rack and the soul business,
which show they're doing their back and away.
But guess who was standing right behind him?
Condoleezza.
Worse.
Jewelieberman.
Oh.
Now, I want to tell you something.
Seriously, if I have to, if I was forced to participate
in this pool, that's what inspired me to change the pool.
I'm creating it as I sit here.
Other than GW, because he'd obviously win in this crowd,
which politician do you detest the most?
Which one of these people gives you the creeps
makes you your skin crawl?
What's the right-wing asshole from Texas who's
these house majority leader?
What's his name?
Tom Tim.
Tom.
Mick.
I was confusing with the Tim Le Heila.
That's not the one.
What's his name?
You know what I'm talking about?
Yeah.
Tom.
Come on.
Ridge.
Delay.
Tom Delay.
Very good.
Anyone who goes down the list?
Because we got a seven-second delay.
Somebody ought to tell Moha that Delay works, by the way.
Anyway, other than George W.
Which politician do you detest the most?
Jew Lieberman.
Oh, yeah, seriously, he to me, he is so much worse
than George W.
Because at least W.
We know him for what he is, okay?
He's a vacuous, dunderhead, right-wing, deterred, dangerous.
But Jew Lieberman, man, this Orthodox,
and I think he ought to be forced.
If he's going to be an Orthodox Jew,
don't put on a show for the public.
Put on the talus and the payus and the tits and the tefilin.
And come on here when the schmata on your head,
the head gear, the doily.
And show everybody what you're really all about.
I mean, the Orthodox Jews that wear that crap on their sleeve,
man, they're just as bad as Falwell
and the other are far-bisoner right-wing assholes.
Obnoxious.
But anyway, I don't want to twist the way you vote.
Here's the list I have so far.
Jew Lieberman, Ted Kennedy,
because they're a lot of, you know,
the right-wingers out there that can't stand Teddy.
Oh, I know who else I should put on here.
I should get a lot of votes.
Hillary Clinton, huh?
Oh, she'd be doing very well.
I guarantee you.
Ted Kennedy, Jesse Helms,
Strom Thurmond, Dick Army,
Tom Delay, and Hillary Clinton.
That's my short list so far.
I'm sure there are those we could add.
Did you get those?
Julie Lieberman, Ted Kennedy,
Jesse Helms, Strom Thurmond, Dick Army,
Tom Delay, and Hillary Clinton.
How about Jeb Bush?
Yes, stick his ass on there.
Don't let him off the hook, even for old times sake.
Anyway, getting back to yesterday's poor result
and we still have some more stuff
I'm gonna play today.
But I'm not gonna do a whole show with that
because we got too many important bedtime stories.
The greatest top 40 AM radio station ever was
WQAM 167.
Let's hear it for a little QAM.
Which used to be really damn good.
WABC 90, WLS 44.
See, I disagree with that.
But then again, I lived in Michigan for 12 years.
I think WLS was much better than WABC.
WABC was way too overproduced.
But see, I'm looking at that from like a radio standpoint.
WFUN 40, WNBC 26, KDK 20 CKL, WWYN 17, WMCA in the big ape.
14 apiece, Chum and Toronto 13, WOLO 13, WBZ 12, WOR, KFI,
WFILH 10.
WRKO, WIVG, each had nine.
WKN R and Detroit only had eight.
And also WSYZ Detroit had eight.
Not enough Detroit people here baby.
I'll turn to that right now.
That's very sad.
WAKY and Louisville had seven.
Home of Bill Bailey, WPOP and Hartford had seven.
And now this damn thing is changing again
and jumping all over the place.
I hate that like poison.
WLW and Cincinnati had six, KAY6.
KO, how come we didn't put WSAI and Cincinnati on there?
Dick Purton used to work there too.
Because we forgot.
KOL6, WMEX6, WKBW only five.
Only five for WKBW and Buffalo.
Well, that's probably because Joey used to work there.
WCFL also had five.
Three WME and Cleveland had four as the WNO and NORLins.
KHJ had three, KQB and WHK3, KJR had three.
I bet your suds was one of those, huh?
Thank you.
Debate.
Could be.
WJB K and Detroit had a pair.
KMPC had one.
WDRC and WMGM each had none.
You know something that's just out of 624 votes.
And especially WMGM with all due respect to Duff
and his WDRC crap and heartburn.
WMGM, 1050 in New York with Peter Trip.
How's that possible?
Had no votes?
When I was rough in Rochester,
which is a suburb of Buffalo,
even in the daytime you could hear WMGM.
Although it had little problem with the same frequency
and still is obviously it's WHN, 1050 with Chummon Toronto.
So they would like, you know,
it was depending on which way the wind was blowing.
You know, Toronto, it's a suburb of Rochester, right?
So that's our poll for today
and I'm sure we'll get some solutions to add to that.
Make no mistake about it.
Here's the big news of the day.
Big news.
George Beasley sees Ad Cycle becoming an upward trend.
Norma, your good friend Norma faxed this to me
at the house last night.
Beasley, what should mean?
Big raises for everybody.
What do you think?
Huh?
Come on.
Oh, here you go.
Here's a good choice for the poll.
Thank you.
I know that start coming in.
Trent Lot.
Oh, he makes me want to puke a lot.
Thank you.
Good choice.
Anyway, Beasley Broadcast Group announced Monday.
How come they have been talking about this here
in a building?
If they pay less attention to ball games
and more attention to what's being said by the
executive officers of this company over in Naples,
the people in this building might have some idea
what's going on.
Then they will fear you.
You know what I'm saying?
Beasley Broadcast Group announced this week
it expects its O3 results to outpace guidance.
Why it's as chairman CEO George Beasley so confident?
I've been in this business for more than 40 years
and I've seen the up cycles
and I've seen the down cycles.
He tells Bloomberg, this is an R&R.
It seems that the cycle is beginning to turn upward.
We've seen that through the first quarter
and we've seen that through the second quarter.
So I'm confident advertising for us seems to be picking
up across the board.
He also notes that his company was able to
negotiate the sports contract.
It's WQM Miami head with the Dolphins,
Marlins and Panthers, which means we're saving
some of those millions of dollars.
We were flushing down the toilet.
Beasley's expected to report its Q3 results
on October 30, a week from Wednesday.
Ready for that?
Big, big profits baby, which means big, big pay increases
for all.
Especially George and Carlos and McGill.
Oh, here's some good ones.
Now I'm talking about present.
Now they got Reagan on here.
We don't want to put the poor Ronnie on there.
Catherine Harris, good choice,
makes our skin crawl most of us.
Catherine Harris, got it?
Got it?
OK, so one out of several on that page ain't bad.
Just keep them coming.
Faximin, we'll, you know, we can start it on there
anytime you want.
I don't want to get like way behind like we did yesterday.
Oh, who's on the bat line there?
I wonder who that could be.
WQA in bat line.
It's either somebody that doesn't want to be on here
or wrong number or facts.
Hello?
Nobody there.
What a shame.
Could have been somebody very important.
Maybe it was your friend Norma.
Could have been.
Could have been Norma.
Maybe he's got your idea all set up for it
without huge 200% increase.
What do you think?
You know, this guy, this so-called witness.
Well, what would you like to, I'd like to put him
in the favor, do catch the sniper, which I have my doubts.
But if they ever do, I'd like to put him in his lap
when we stick him in the chair.
This asshole that was inside the home depot.
This to me, these kinds of people,
these kinds of assholes.
How long can we torture him before he finally kills us?
In a twist in the Washington area sniper case,
a witness who told police he had seen a cream-colored van
speeding away from the latest shooting
was apparently not telling the truth.
Forcing authorities yesterday
to withdraw one of their few promising leads.
The witness had described to investigators
seeing a man's shoulder and assault rifle take aim
in Shootland, or Franklin in the parking lot
of a home depot in Fulcurch, Virginia, on Monday,
and he also described the van,
which he said had a malfunctioning tearlight
and a letter rack on top.
After two weeks of shooting some little evidence,
the witness's description has been hailed as a step forward,
and police were feeling aware optimism
about catching the killer.
Now, the discounting of the witness's story
left residents with less confidence,
the killer will be caught anytime soon.
Police Chief Charles Musi, a mousse man of Montgomery County,
Maryland insisted the development was not a setback,
but ignores the witness may have purposely given
the police faulty information.
Reports of the van were inaccurate,
reports of an olive skin person were inaccurate,
and the witness also told police he had seen the government
wheel of the NAK-74 assault rifle of Russian origin.
Based on that initial report,
Fairfax Police Broadcasting Alert for the suspect vehicle
and driver, police raced into position on interstate highways,
bridges, and other roads.
All in search of the cream-colored van,
the nonexistent cream-colored van.
How do you like that?
They ought to take this guy, like you said,
and pluck out every cell in his body one at a time.
Right.
Pluck out his eyeball with rusty tweezers.
Man.
And he was inside the home depot,
he finally admitted what was going on.
Inside.
Maybe an X-ray vision like Clark Kent, you think?
Don't forget small, Bill Tuzdani,
by the way, Mark Adon and your calendar.
Clark gets very emotional again this week, they said.
He does?
That's what they said.
He gets all whipped up into a frenzy.
He thinks about looking at it.
Not touching it, but you know, gotta start slow.

I'm 34-560 WQAM.
Pastor and four others go to jail for whippings.
An Atlanta.
A pastor and four members of his church were found guilty yesterday of aggravated assault and cruelty to children for whipping two boys in front of the congregation.
I guess they just probably wanted to whip them into shape.
The defendants were handed prison censors ranging from 20 to 90 days.
They were also fine amounts ranging from 250 bucks to $8,000 placed on probation in order to attend parenting classes.
Judge T. Jackson Bedford Jr. also told the pastor the Reverend Arthur Allen Jr.
They cannot advise or participate in any way and they discipline of anyone else's children.
150 members of the House of Prayer and Independent Atlanta Church have repeatedly said that they have the right to beat their children and that the church was being persecuted for its beliefs.
They got the right to beat their children, so don't you think so?
Of course they do.
Well, there you go and while they're at it, kill some people.
Sure, why not?
They got their own set of laws just like the Vatican said yesterday.
Well, you know that whole dog and pony show we put on it.
We don't think so.
We're not too crazy about it.
Who the hell are you?
Yeah, that's right. Who you to be a dick and a was.
Okay, we got the good rosary beads and all that good porno with the Vatican.
Vatican rejects US clerical abuse policy saying revisions are necessary.
Well, I'll save that. I don't want to do that yet.
We'll get to it.
How about that football game?
How about that Brawl you saw on TV this morning on the CBS News?
Older and over, right?
Adults and kids brawl at a football game.
Same old crap man hockey games football games, baseball, a little league baseball games.
Crazy, crazy assholes out there.
Drunken crazy parents obsessive lunatic, maniacal crazy people beat
not each other kicking and stopping and how about that one hockey dad that killed the other one in New England?
All about living vicariously through their kids.
Right. That's right.
All about exploiting using their kids for their own puff it up their own ego.
See, I'm, you know, you may laugh when I say it.
Force sterilization is the only way to go. It's the only hope.
I notice Eric's got a room for about 400 more.
I'm trying to vote on this thing.
Is this thing up for votes yet or not?
Oh, well, you said that you were going to take suggestions.
No, well, no, let's, let's close it out.
Let's get some votes on Eric.
Eric, when did that, is he hearing us this morning or why?
Yes.
Well, let's hear it.
Oh, right.
You can hear us, which means other people can hear us on our internet.
We got problems with that thing, you know, and don't bug us with that.
We can, you know, it just does.
Everybody's got problems because it's the freaking internet.
Like I said, when it works, it's great.
When it doesn't work, it's a real pain in the ass.
It's just like, you know, it's like that's gave sucks.
And Bell, South, even though Spirocantins upset with me, they suck.
Isn't he thinking of upset with me?
Oh, speaking of upset, let me just tell you this.
Troy over at Balance for Life, you're a puss.
It's nice that you've got a free week of, it's worth a billion dollars
to publicity on Channel 4, but that piece last night with that fat ham-hawk and L. Sunshine.
Who the hell are you to be talking about fat on television now, okay?
Who the hell are you to be talking about it?
If there's one thing I can't say and it's fat people talking about losing weight, except me.
Right? Right. And to be able to know how.
No, no, seriously. I mean, the thing last night was on the cost.
Now, it's not cheap. That's for sure.
But the fact of the matter is that to prepare that kind of food, I had last night a chicken.
What the hell was it? A chicken thing with a, a man was unbelievable.
With all kinds of good stuff on it. And the seasonings and the herbs and everything.
There's no way in the world that any of you people listening to me right now, unless you're a restaurant tour.
The rest of you, you couldn't prepare that kind of food.
And they're saying, oh, it could cost you up to a thousand bucks a month.
First of all, they deliver it right to your goddamn door.
What was it called? Are you got the list?
Chicken and cauliflower allah-gurid.
No, I had that was, that was my dinner. This was a snack. That was good. Very good.
But this was some kind of a snack. It was chicken.
Oh, this is a different snack. Oh, man, was that good.
But anyway, my point being this, that you couldn't, for all, I don't care how much you'd spend.
Nobody in the right mind has got the time or they wear with all or the inclination to stand in and unless you're a gourmet chef.
To stand in the kitchen and prepare and work all day long or the time to do it and make that kind of food.
So, Al-San-Jah and you were a real idiot, okay?
Sure, it's expensive. And they came right out there and they told you how much it cost.
And how much is your health worth to you, right?
Right.
How much is it worth to be alive? Just like the beast.
We're going to save his life with this thing if he sticks to it.
He's gone from a 499 pound.
And, isn't it a weigh-in day?
He'll be in. He was here yesterday, waddling around.
Don't you understand? It's too close to 9 o'clock.
He isn't going to take a chance at a mobile being here.
I don't think Mo hangs around.
No.
They don't have those ding dong school meetings anymore like they used to.
Don't you remember that?
Yeah.
Well, what are you looking at me with a kind of a whimsical look like that?
Do they have those meetings you're not?
He kind of hangs around so we can kill some people.
And then he gets out of here.
Oh, he is the best. Make no mistake about it.
He's the most bizarre.
But on Monday, man, it's going to be, this is going to be the day.
Okay, you can do all the BS and all the try to deflect all the stuff.
Monday's going to be the day.
Put your numbers where your asses is what I say.
Put your numbers where your two pay is.
And you weren't sitting in there, unfortunately.
There was another, I'm sure they dumped it.
There was another comment about his two pay today.
Probably didn't get on here.
Of course, when they say when I say his two pay, I don't know which one I'm talking about.
Because this one didn't smell quite so bad.
It was his bag.
Now it was the pressure from the whole building from those numbers coming out on Monday.
And of course, right down the hall, you know that crap they played on the hall.
Power 96.
They're all up.
Well, they've been going in the right direction, man.
Must be that.
I'll be silk, you know.
So I guess this thing that I'm talking about all this nostalgia yesterday and some of the stuff I'm going to play today,
the good old days of AM top 40 radio and personalities.
The people around today, they just had the younger people didn't grow up in that culture.
So all they want to hear is the goddamn music, right?
Right.
They want to either hear Howard talking, we're not talking about you, Howard.
Howard Spurm talking about boobs or, you know, or they want to hear the music.
And there's not too much in between.
That's it.
Are you sure?
I think so.
20 till 10 at 560 WQ and Catherine Harris moves into first place in the early returns with three votes.
And you know something, if she doesn't win the poll, she'll fix it.
You know what you make me want to do, Catherine?
Kill some people.
Yeah, that's what you make me want to do.
You bitch.
You smelly bitch with your three million dollars over there in Sarasota.
You got to take your money and you know what you got to do with the Catherine.
Right.
Boy, she makes my skin crawl.
And her family is citrus barons, of course.
Yeah.
Part of the reason we all lost our trees.
And to lost our election, too, as a matter of fact.
Bitch.
20 till 10 at 560 WQ and I wonder what you're going to do with it.
I'm sure if she could draw a picture of it for us, you know, Jebs.

Nice going to Harry
Although Harry of course can barely talk
You know he's got that thing
Whatever he's got
What is he got?
He can barely speak
He can't sing anymore either?
I don't think so
But at any rate he did a nice job
He basically called them like
How Suncle Tom's
Things like that
So a couple of names we better add to the list
I see he's already got John
Askcroft on there
We better also add
Because on this list
Or in snatch
Don't you think?
Somebody fags me that
And he also has on here
That joling right wing asshole
From Texas Phil Graham

Even paying attention to we as
Most of the asshole seem to be
From Texas like Tom Delay
Phil Graham, not all of them
You got your own snatch
Who's from Utah
One of them Mormon liquors
But at any rate
And keep in mind
We're not including the present in this
Because he'd win hands down
Which politician you despise the most
Hillary Clinton 11
Catherine Harris 9
Jeb Bush is God 9
They're like in lockstep there

Yeah, I get it
Ted Kennedy 3
Jesse Helms 3
Dick army 2
Tom Delay's got a pair
I say I apologize for that
But Tim Le Hay and Tom Delay

And quite frankly
Other than the spelling
It's basically the same person
Right wing lunatic assholes
On the fringe of humanity
Tom Delay 2
Trent Lotz got a pair
And he's waving him around too
Pompoms
John Ascrops already got two
And poor old Strom Thurmond
He's gotten none because they
Jesse Helms is on her 3
So just vent, let it out
Winning out, let it out
Florida judge throws out
Conviction of boys accused
of killing father
Awww
A judge yesterday
threw out the convictions of two boys
Ages 13 and 14 in the sling of their
father who was blooded into
the baseball bat as he slept
Circuit judge Frank Bell said
the boys' rights were violated
by the unusual and bizarre way
Prosecutor Samultaneously presented
two contradictory theories of the crime
Of course that asshole Dan Abrams
on MSNBC
He was telling us
Oh, this happens all the time
There's nothing unusual about this
That Dan Abrams, he's an asshole
There's another one for your asshole
Column
Man, is he an idiot?
If MSNBC
Get his ass off there
They'll be knew of them
So a big favor
Along with that fat Jerry
Nockman
I'm serious, he's just
Oh, he's brutal
Anyway, prosecutors won the
Conviction of Alex and Derek
King last month by arguing
That Derek swung the bat
But in a trial that ended a
Week earlier, they presented
Evidence that an adult friend
of the boys committed to crime
The judge had ordered a new
trial for the boys
And in the meantime,
We'll encourage the prosecution
And defense to work out a
Deal
The brothers were facing
Prison terms of 20 years
Delight because they were
Tried as adults
They were convicted of
Secondary murder without a
Weapon as well as arson
Percenting the house on fire
To cover the crime
Were all ecstatic
Said Linda Walker
The boys' maternal grandmother
I saw Derek smile
I think they're happy about it
Now they know they have hope
The brothers' lawyers
argued that prosecutor
David Rimmer committed
Prosecutorial misconduct
for pursuing the
Contrary Theory
The boys' adult friend
Convicted
Chalamolester Rikki Chavis
Was acquitted
But the verdict was
Sealed until the boys' trial
Was over
Basically what the prosecution
Was doing it
Well if we can't convict
This one will convict them
You know, we'll get somebody
And they used the kids
As witnesses against him
And it didn't work out
And they said, oh yeah,
Well you can't
To believe them because
They're upstanding kids
And they would never lie
And then in their trial
The guy that this Rimmer
Guys is, oh yeah,
There are a couple of
Liers
Something stinks
In this trial
You know what I'm saying?
So thank God the judge
Even up there in Pensacola
The Yahoo judge
Had enough sense to say
I don't think so, okay?
Damn it
You know it was that
The pervert that
Chavis go
What was the new term
For that kind of guy?
Oh, it's a tad polling
He was a tad polling
Tad polling?
Yeah, that's that
Where'd that come from?
It's just a new thing
They were throwing out
There on court TV
See, I have to
It's just like chicken hawk
Chicken hawk used to
Like somebody like him
Was chicken hawk
But now chicken hawk of course
Means Don Rumsfeld
And all this other right-wing
Little Tick
Exactly, right
Man
Look at that, Hillary
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
What a, you know
The other night I talked about Chris Matthews
And he did a great job
I don't like Chris Matthews ordinarily
But I got a whole new attitude
Maybe he's not so bad
He did a good job there with John McCain
At Fordham
And at any rate
There were, you know, he's asking a bunch of different questions
And he asked him
Do you think Hillary Clinton will be running
Do you think she should run for president?
And of course McCain
You know, being the Republican to begin with
And he's not going to get involved
And once Chris Matthews mentioned that man
Those, I thought they were going to have another riot in that crowd
They were booing and hissing and like psychotic
Those collared students
Who doesn't hate her?
I don't know, I mean, I don't get it
The only reason that he won by a landslide in New York
And the Senate election is because she was running against that puts
That little trophy puts was making all those sexist, nidiotic comments, you know
And was very kind of sending Rick, what was his name?
Rick Azar
Rick, I don't know what his name was
I don't know
And they didn't know either, nobody knew who they wanted
How they wanted to have a mind
So she held Gorewood in New York by a landslide
Of course New York is one of those very few states that's becoming more and more democratic all the time
More and more
Of course they have no choice
But at any rate that's the only reason she won here
But she couldn't win a fixed election in any place else
Let her come down here to Florida and see if she could win, huh?
Any chance?
No
No chance, she'll already get out of here
Crazy bitch
Wake up to...
And this article is very disturbing
Should I give like a caution on this for people that are like weak emotionally?
Okay
It's a column by Steve Dunley, being yesterday's New York Post
He says, wake up, this terrorist is no native
And of course this is just his opinion, but this is his column, he writes a lot of good columns
He said it's time to suspect the unthinkable and the suspicion is this
Washington has been paralyzed by terrorists
Terrorists working for a foreign organization that wants to destroy our country
There are credible experts who believe that a war has been visited on our breakfast table
It's a war that's as hot as the massive slaughter of 9-11 was traumatic
The Washington area killings is a terrorist cell, no doubt about it, it's at Larry Johnson
A veteran CIA agent and State Department counter-terrorist expert
We've seen how the talking hit shows a million times in last year
Maybe it's not al-Qaeda, but it's in sympathy with them, he said
Larry was talking with little agent his voice
I keep on hearing these experts on TV saying that terrorists always leave their calling card
Taking credit for their monstrosities, wrong
Fact!
From 1990 to 1999 there were 3,400 terrorist attacks throughout the world, mainly against the Western world
Fact! Some say 10% of those terrorist attacks are ones that some group took credit for
Fact! I believe it's about 1% that took credit, you take credit way after the fact
There are some terrorist groups that take credit for some things they didn't even do
But the worst thing right now is that I believe this is a terrorist cell
It's that I've versioned a tie up for all enforcement with this thing that's stopping the city
And then come up with something that's even more terrible
Johnson who heads an international security company called Berga Associates is quite confused
That nobody links to his bloodbath in Washington with a global terror campaign going on around the world
The atrocities in Washington, Yemen, the Middle East, and Asia, he believes are all connected
We have a French tanker blown up in Yemen, we have an American Marine killed in Kuwait
And yet there's another shooting against our Marines, there's a horrific bombing terrorist attack in Valley Indonesia
This is all happening at the same time the sniper is stalking DC and its suburbs
Hello, he says, Neil Livingstone of Global Operations in Washington-based security
Conglomerate has written nine books on terrorism
He was the first person to get a doctorate in terrorism in 1977
I asked Livingstone about the Tiro card and the note which was left with said, dear policeman, I am God
This guy is like someone pretending to be a disordered mind, he said, the Tiro card was a total throw-off
I'm not an investigator nor nothing about psychiatry says, Steve Donlevy, but having traveled a globe more times than I can afford
I can say for sure that a homegrown urban terrorist doesn't write that way
He asks you to write, it's double respect, and Livingstone, great respect for the police, great respect for authority
A good fingerprint of what these guys are all about
Bottom line, I have Indian Pakistani-Arabian Israeli friends who are pathological about calling me Mr. or dear
If one is shoot or is caught, if he's not a foreigner, I will bear my dear air in Macy's window
How do you like that?
Steve Donlevy says if this guy turns out not to be a foreigner, if this turns out not to be part of some terrorist cell
He'll bear his fat ass right in Macy's window
Let's hope they let him
Oh, they probably would
Get a hell of a crown, I'll tell you that
Look at Hillary, just run away from the pack
The only way we could have given her any competition, I guess, is putting Mo on there
But I can't figure out a way to get him on this one
Which politician, other than the president, of course, because he's in a special category
You despise the most, which of this group?
109 votes already, Hillary 28, Jeb 16, Catherine Harris 16
We can't separate those two, you notice?
They tried, they tried, they tried, they were gonna hold it
They can't separate him, they tried with a crowbar, couldn't get him apart
Jeb has got 16, Catherine Harris 16, and the good news is, Julie Bernman's got 16
John Asgroff's got 9, Ted Kennedy's 7, Tom Delay 5, Jesse Helms 5
Trent Lot 4, Dick Army 2, Strom Thurman's got one, and Orn's Snatch, he don't have any
And that is shame?
He's small potatoes now, I guess, poor old Orn's Snatch
Nobody pays much attention to him
956, he's too busy studying out of those blow jobs, you know, back from Penisgate, he's still working on that
Isn't he the Mormon?
Yeah, from Utah
With the underwear?
Oh, does he wear magic underwear, do you think?
The temple garments, they're called
Now you're gonna piss off the Mormons again, you've been driving away our Mormon audiences down to like 708 people out there now
Keep picking on it, no seriously, you're gonna be picking on the Mormons, who's it gonna be next?
You've already driven away most of the Jews, then he's working on the Mormons, all we're gonna have left is a bunch of right-winged Spicks
What does this have?
I've been dedicated nearly since 86, I moved to Los Angeles 98, continue listening to show on the internet
Recently I accepted a new job which will interfere with my live listening, I'm interested in recording the show off internet to my hard drive
You know if there's a program that can do this
I don't
You don't?
Well, save that for Carlos, our computer expert when he comes in, I'll save that and maybe an email a guy or a fast a guy or do something
Do something, okay?
Do something good
He did what?
Look at those long list of bits he put in there
Well, I heard today he's gonna come in and kill some people

10-04560 WKM
Here's a fact from some poor listener who lives in Texas now
We sent him our sympathies
Why are there so many Hillary haters
This poor lady can't give a proper BJ
So her husband has to seek them elsewhere
The stone princess, I think, is what he's talking about
Neil, please pray for me as you just mentioned
A lot of people on the pull-off from Texas
I live here now, listen to you on the web daily
The place is so bad that the top story last night's 10 o'clock news was that the ribbon-billy grey em is in town
Oh!
Is what it says
The Democrats here hide in shame, it's more disgraceful than most who pay
I'm a huge fan from way back, thanks for being on here
Oh, yet his George still hang out at the Coliseum
What's the Coliseum?
I don't know
I have no idea
The one in Rome?
I guess we're going to throw into the lines at about 130 this afternoon
Because if there's one thing we want to do before we finish the week, it's kill some people
Why not?
Share!
160 votes on that pull, Hillary's got 36
Which politician on this list?
You despise the most, which one just makes your skin crawl, your blood boil
Makes you want a puke, your gut side every time you see them
Hillary's got 36, I have no problem with that, she's annoying
She has no credentials, no qualifications, she didn't let she's not
It's one thing to be a carpet bagger, okay, there have been plenty of politicians who have been carpet baggers
But if you know what you're doing, if you know something, she knows nothing
Oh no, she's been a very effective senator
Right, she's offensive to look at
She's offensive to think about
That's what Bubba said
Hillary's got 36, she had Bush 25, just edge to head to Catherine
Catherine Harris and Julie Roman tied 24 there in a full Nelson
Ted Kennedy 13, John Ascroft has moved up very fast
We just put his name on her, he's already got 13, I bet she's got more now, 14, like I said
I love it when it changes in midstream because then it gives me an opportunity to go back to the top
And read them all over again
Kennedy 14, Ascroft 14, Tom Delays got 8
Jesse Homes 6, Dick Army's got 4, probably Barney Fag voted a couple of times
Trent Lotz got 4, Strom Thurmond to an orange snatch got 1
Oh!
I think there's two or ours in his first name, aren't there?
I'm not really sure, I don't know
I don't know, we're not going to worry about spelling, okay?
There's only one orange snatch
There's only, I shouldn't say that
Tell her a six at five, well because there's a, her a lot
You got a finestein and you got who's the other one from California?
Barbara Boxer and who's starting her own rebellion, by the way, is what I'm hearing?
Fatick and reject US clerical abuse policies saying revisions necessary
This is just so amazing to me, that freaking damn Pope
Boy does he have a lot of hoodspot?
Yes he does.
The Vatican today rejected the US Roman Catholic Church's new sexual abuse policy
Saying the sweeping zero tolerance crackdown needed to be revised because
Elements conflict with universal church law.
In other words to hell with your law and the law everybody else has to abide by
We got universal church law, we got that canon law.
Just ask a Frank canon, oh he's dead.
While supporting the US bishops efforts to stamp out clergy abuse, the Vatican said
The policy contained provisions that were difficult to reconcile with church law, were difficult to interpret and left open procedural questions that need to be resolved.
In other words, that's what they said.
For these reasons it's been judged appropriate before they recognite you,
Vatican approval can be granted, a further reflection on and revision of the norms and they churned our necessary, the Vatican response said.
The response signed by Cardinal Giovanni Batista Re, head of the congregation of bishops, proposed the creation of a joint US Vatican commission to revise the policy.
The US bishops adopted the plan in June after all that big good talk and pony show they put on and response to enormous public pressure that they take a tough stance against abuse of clergy and stem the scandal that has shaken many American Catholics, faith in church leadership and those freaking pedophiles.
Victims groups responded toward yesterday that the Vatican would reject elements of the policy, said the response show the Vatican was more concerned about protecting offending priests than miners and that they got their thumb right on it.
That's exactly what it's all about.
Covering up for the priest, that's all they give a crap about.
In the letter released with raised response, Bishop Wilton Gregory, head of the US conference of Catholic, he don't have to do with him as taken to Wilton Manners, that would serve him right.
Head of the US conference of Catholic bishops said he was happy to accept and proposal for a mixed commission to reflect further on and consider revision of some of the norms.
Gregory was to give a press conference later today in a room.
The Vatican letter gave no specifics of the provisions that it found troubling. However, it was clear that certain aspects of the American zero tolerance policy would have blamed.
Right. Among other things, the US policy requires diocese removed priests from church work once a credible allegation is made and in some instances from the priesthood itself.
Ever since it was adopted, Vatican officials and American church law experts have said the norms might violate church law because they would need provacuse priests of their due process rights.
Well, you know what I say? Screw them. Screw these damn perverts. Oh, speaking of perverts, by the way, how come nobody is factored and know they probably don't know about Harold Ballard, former alunatic owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs, come to find out that he was also a proposition to young boy Maple Leaf Gardens.
They had a big scandal up there with a lot of the usher's and other people were doing hanky panky with those kids, with those miners and Maple Leaf Gardens, the usher's will come to find out that Harold Ballard himself,
who was a lunatic, a maniac destroyed a franchise, did everything evil evil. He was an evil doer and evil doer, but the good news is he's dead. That's the good news.
And like I said, before we get done here today, some of these evil doers in the world, one thing we're going to make sure we do is kill some people before we leave it one o'clock.
We got the mad dog at one. Hank is on for a full, you know, baseball seasons over. So I guess I don't have to make a big deal that full four hours every day.
Hank, three to 70, told me he's been doing calisthenics to a bone up for it. They wants that 530 to 630. We got the Hooter's College football preview with Josie and Josh Darrow, seven of them.
No wonder Clarets was in there early working fibrously over his desk. Do you see him in there? Yes. I didn't want to interrupt him. He was just pouring over stuff on the internet. Look like porno to me.

What a great job they do for you. And how they can help you lose some of that weight on the Atkins diet. A lot of you people are on the Atkins.
And for many people at works against the job done because it's a low carb. See one thing when they talk about diets on these stupid shows like on channel four.
They don't make that they don't differentiate between refined carbohydrates and unrefined natural carbohydrates.
So this business like lumping it all together like potato chips is the same as goddamn asparagus. I'm sorry.
You asked holes at channel four. Anyway, Atkins works for a lot of people. If you want to stuck up on all the great products for Atkins diets.
This is one complete store that's geared just for you. Do you like the voice bokeh? Can you imagine a little low carb, no fact delicious scoop of ice cream on a hot day like today?
I can imagine it. How about a worth a thousand low carb and no sugar products is ready for you to taste because the delights of Westboken can always try it before you buy it.
And it delights its 25% off on all Atkins products all the time from candy to cookie snacks, breads, vitamins that great to pasta sauce with almost no carbs at all.

So, there's, uh, from New York, okay,
which is a suburb, according to a guilty of Buffalo.
And then, what he said?
New York City is a sub-an Boston's a suburb of Buffalo.
And I guess living in Toronto, part of the year,
I'm living in a suburb of Buffalo, am I right?
Absolutely correct, sir.

Hillary hates Jews.
10-13-5-60.
Tommy's taken over. He just came in to sound and do the rest of the show today.
So, you guys can have the weekend off.
He's taken over the whole goddamn place.
Unless they start drilling again on the second floor,
in which case he's gonna throw a Schmidt fit.
And I don't blame you.
That was good going there. I think you were the one.
Because they won't listen to me anymore.
I'm just, you know, I'm old news.
But you were just frantic and screaming and hysterical and shone crap and just,
uh, I really like it when he picked up old freaky carlos and threw his ass right against the wall.
It was great.
Anyway, woman gets prison time. He said he wouldn't touch his ass.
And who the hell would?
Woman gets prison time for porging prescription.
Somebody just faxed this to me. Now, it may not be that important to us.
Unless you, there's at the end, there's a little note on here.
And he's right.
A 47-year-old woman who attempted to fill a dead woman's prescription
was sentenced to one to three years in state prison in Boston, Spawn, New York.
Where the hell is that? Is that a suburb of Buffalo?
Is that everything?
Sheila May was arrested in August after she called a pharmacy to get a prescription refilled for a woman who died the week before.
May was sentenced Thursday.
The pharmacist recognized the name of the deceased took the order and called police.
The Saratoga County D. As office said, I guess we know where it is now.
A man appeared at the pharmacy saying he was there to pick up the prescription prosecutor said
police talked to the man who agreed to bring the bottle of
hydrochid hydrochid, a don, an narcotic painkiller to May prosecutor said
May pleaded guilty August 9 to 4 to be attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance of felony
Within two weeks of a police, she was arrested for forging another prescription
So she could receive more pills prosecutor said one to three years in state prison and then over the end says
I guess her father isn't governor.
Absolutely correct.
Right. Good point.
Here's the facts from listener George with a G.
It says good morning George and he'll hope you have a great weekend. Finally a whiff is some cool rear.
I don't I don't know the morning when you went to the car you didn't feel it.
I don't go to the car because it's in my garage.
Oh yeah. Very nice this morning.
All I know is yes. Yesterday afternoon I was swearing at Brian Norcross more than usual because he was talking about oh look at the he didn't exist.
So much felt hot and humid to me man. It felt you could roast the marshmallows on the sidewalk really this morning.
Oh feel it.
Anyway it says the reason I'm writing this if you see the cover of the Rolling Stone this week October 31 edition.
No.
Well why not? Where's your magazine guy?
Oh hey Bill.
Yeah get where you bill.
Shakira Mary J. Blige and Brittany on the cover and check out the positioning of Brittany's belt it says the way it dangles down great stuff.
Remember that thing we were watching?
Yes. That was pretty nerve in that because I didn't know who the spark was.
So that was Mary J. Blige.
That'd be Mary J.
I still don't know who that is.
Anyway it says but she's a virgin so I'm sure it was just incidental the fact that her belt was a dangling.
Hey more hairhead it says I hope the mad dog takes a leak in your hair helmet this Sunday.
And go Utica.
Oh Utica that's December buffalo in it.
Yeah.
The voice of the station says.
Now who was that?
Our announcer that does all the IDs and the rejoins and all the fruity sounding Tommy said that?
No no no.
The mister announcer guy that does all the IDs.
Oh that guy said that.
I don't know.
He's pretty good but he's got a lot of.
Yeah long way to go to catch up to that.
Now speaking of Hillary in that bit we just played moments ago before I interrupted myself.
They hate her.
258 votes which politician you despise the most?
Swilleries got 62.
In fact like I said, Jeb Bush has got 42.
He's moving up on a race.
Jewelieberman 41.
Catherine Harris 38.
Ted Kennedy 26.
John Ascroft 21.
Tom Delay 10.
Jesse Helms 9.
Trent Lott 6. Dick Army be having five.
Strom Thurman 4.
And Orin snacks his moving up a little bit.
He's Egin.
He's got three.
This story makes me want to get by the way that thing I played that New York montage which we enjoyed tremendously here.
If you didn't like it that's my suggestion because I have more stuff coming a little bit later on from all over the country.
Because not everybody's from New York that make him as a shock to some of the Yorkers out there but I thought that was great.
I liked it a lot.
I mean not everybody was on air but you had like Jack Spector and Murray the K and Brucey who's really.
He's an asshole.
Yeah.
Robby Young.
Robby Young was on air like I said.
He's an asshole.
Dead one.
Boy.
We could tell you a lot of Robby Young stories but we better not.
I only have one.
Adults and kids, Brawlet Football Game.
Let's get back to this American story.
It's the All-American way baby.
Pico River, California.
Two men were arrested yesterday for allegedly kicking a man in the hate repeatedly in a videotaped brawl that erupted after a week in youth football game.
Joe Sérracho, 32 in his brother, Geno 25, were booked on charges of assault with a deadly weapon.
Settled LA County Sheriff's Lieutenant Al Grotterfend.
The deadly weapon was at there.
Was there feet he said?
There feet be the deadly weapon.
The fight involving about 25 children teenagers and adults occurred Saturday immediately after a San Gabriel Valley Junior All-American football conference.
In the summer of just east of LA, authority said no one was hospitalized and I'm sure some of you many of you have seen those tapes over and over and over again on your little TV sets.
More arrest or expected, Grotterfend said the brothers are being held in the war of half a million dollars bail.
A review of videotape made by a bystander led to the brothers arrests.
They had us way outnumbered Team Pirate Desi Tubbs told the KCBS TV.
They separated anybody who wanted to get in there to stop the fight and beat them up.
It was about five or six guys.
The president of one of the teams that Angles said he saw a nine-year-old girl hit.
Angles himself was shown on the video being knocked down and he appeared on TV Wednesday with a deep cut over the bridge of his nose.
Some parents complained they had been heavy drinking by adults during the game.
Oh, that couldn't be part of the problem.
Could it?
As Uncle Leo has been asking for many years, how many beers does it take to enjoy a sporting event?
Does anybody have an answer?
No.
Five.
Remember fact that what was his name that's dead now?
They used to come to the hockey games all the time.
Climbers?
No, no.
What the hell was his name?
Out of sight out of mind with the big red face Andy.
Oh.
Yeah.
Who used to bring the beers back like three at a time?
You know, one for you two for me.
That kind of thing?
He's now he's dead.
Linda Lane, conference president of the youth football league, confirmed yesterday that two teams from the San Gabriel Valley program were involved in the brawl.
Had no further comment, of course.
He's mom.
The fight occurred immediately after the game between teams from Polk over Vera and nearby Downey.
Oh, that explains it.
Averent behavior by parents using and abusing their children so they can like say, hey, my kids bet in your kid, my kids buy whatever.
And I'm going to show you.
And if you don't believe me, I'll just beat the crap out of you.
In fact, some of these people I think it's so plasti that it's a miracle that more of these folks don't go to a game with the strict intention of kill some people.
Yeah.
Maybe that's what they went there for like that hockey dead.
Let's talk some hockey.
What do you say?
No.
How about those make beliefs, huh?
Trevor kids still sucks.
See, we're going to play Phoenix every night.
We'd be okay, I think.
Anyway, 64 votes for Hillary and Jeb is starting to move up on a race and Julie Riven's making the nice moves.
Nice going, you boy.
He makes me nauseous, man.
Like I said, he got my vote and he'd get it every time.
That's the only thing I vote for him for.
I wouldn't vote for him for dog catcher because I'm a dog lover.
I wouldn't want dogs anywhere.
He might get tangled up in his to fill in.
I think I do.
Good.
Don't catch.
Man.
What a wimp.
An ineffectual phony baloney, a right wing, self-hating, obnoxious, bush-looking...
You're lying and low.
This is sports when you're fighting.
You weigh out.
And 13, baby.
Aren't you a couple of missiles?
Yeah, yeah.
To the place we know.
And aim a madame fella.
Whose first name begins with you.
Oh!
There's one thing we all understand.
Palcato won't be finished until we blow up Pakistan.
Kill some people.
We could chase and round forever with our tanks and all our troops.
Our special forces are so tired of jumping through them loose.
You're pulling me to another plane.
So let's cut out all the nonsense and go blow up Pakistan.
How clear an ease a nuclear tank.
Why don't we stop pussyfoot and go blow up Pakistan.
Kill some people.
F-46 in 560 WKM.
George Tennant from the SCIA.
He says the other day that Al Qaeda's organized again and again,
and raided another big thing.
The danger is just as great as it was in the days and weeks before I'm 11.
That's exactly what he said.
And the administration says, well, should we goose up that warning level again
from yellow to orange?
No.
And you want to know why?
Because it doesn't do a goddamn thing.
No.
Too close to election time.
Oh, oh.
See if they increased that alert to orange now, it makes the public like,
oh, that like that feel all we're like unsafe.
And maybe in this last year plus we haven't re-done the great effective job of combating terrorism
that we probably should have in a might thing out Al Qaeda.
Even though we're talking a big game and rattling our spears and going to go into a rack alleged.
Might just remind the public of that.
So they're going to resist at all costs trying to like goose that.
Not that it has that much impact on most of us, but just, you know,
not a good, do you know anybody that does anything different based on that?
Are you kidding me?
You have to be kidding me, mister.
In fact, we got a lot of people out there who like the nervous nellies.
They got the, today is the amber alert and the orange alert and the blue light special.
They got that all written down in various compartments, things like that.
Well, that's a pretty ugly t-shirt Miguel's wearing today, you know.
It's a pumpkin.
Oh, it's a little early for that, though.
And that's only the 18th.
Save that for a couple of weeks.
Maybe he's having some punky pie for lunch.
Can Bush resuscitate little brother?
I talked about this together. They didn't get to it. It's too damn long.
It's too long.
Oh, it's by Howard Feynman, and he wrote it for MSNBC.
Hey, little brother, happy birthday, George W. Bush chirped into his cell phone.
His driver's Toyota bumped along the streets of Houston.
This was in early 1994.
When I accompanied Bush, I went on one of his first trips through Texas.
He prepared to run for governor.
The following he was talking to was John Ellis Bush.
Jeb, did you know that?
Up until this moment, I never knew that that was his name.
John Ellis Bush, Jeb.
Then regarded as the Bush son most likely to follow dead into the White House.
These days, big brothers calling again, but now the subject is more urgent,
rescuing Jeb from political oblivion.
Of all the races and all the places across the country this fall,
none is more important to the president than getting little brother.
Realizing governor of Florida in his surprisingly tight race with Democratic attorney,
Bill McBride, a Tampa, which is why W. was done here again the other day.
Electrical college arithmetic is one reason, of course,
as he contemplates the presidential race of 2004.
The president knows that Florida again promises to be the mother of all battles
as close and contested as in 2000.
And this time they might actually have to let some sparses vote.
His brothers, presidents and the governors mentioned in Tallahassee
was a big help two years ago.
For the Bush White House, there's no worse nightmare than having a Democrat
let alone a shrewd lawyer like Bill McBride in the governorship.
But in the Bush family, the only thing more important than politics is family.
And Jeb Sagas turned from stellar promise to personal,
to political and political anguish.
New poll showman of virtual tie with McBride.
The 2000 election is made in the Democrats National Enemy Number One.
His daughter, Newell, is facing a humiliating, you know,
a public hearing on charges that she violated the terms of her drug rehab program.
And since this was written, by the way, as Quilling or Hills for 10 Days in Jail,
little brother returns out wasn't a lucky brother.
Back in the early 90s, this smart money in the family's hopes
rode with Jeb.
He was the tall and lanky son, which matters to the Bush's,
founding father Prescott, Ike's golfing partner, was 6'4".
He was the son of a five-bated capa key from the University of Texas,
through, although, through which he raced in two and a half years.
He was the son of a spoke, Malifala was Spanish,
and he, not George, was the apple of the mother's discerning and ambitious eye for power.
Jeb had everything but destiny on his side.
Eldest brother, George, had first dibs on the state to try to call his own
and chose, chose Texas, which, through the eighties, began derives as a basin anchor
of new, more conservative Republican party.
Jeb, with fewer schoolboy ties to Texas,
chose as his center of operations, Florida,
which has turned into the San Andreas Fault of American politics.
I love it.
The San Andreas Fault of American politics.
What ain't our fault?
In fact, you guys in here, it's your fault.
He speaks.
When they both ran for governor in 1994,
the conventional wisdom was that Jeb would win and W would lose.
Jeb was an office holder and was a smooth campaigner,
but he ran a philosophically in-industin campaign against
a once-in-a-generation Florida phenomenon, former governor and senator,
Lawton Charles, the he-cune.
Meanwhile in Texas, George W.
was being schooled in the new conservative themes,
and he stuck to them in a plotting, but disciplined way,
to topple a complacent incumbent and Richards.
On election night, Barbara Bush was reportedly more disciplined
and the Jeb had lost than excited that Georgie had won.
When Jabran again in 1998 did so as a full-bork conservative,
and he faced a weaker candidate in Buddy McKay.
How you doing, buddy?
I covered that race too, and remember the Bush family flocking south
to help little brother save face, which he did.
Since winning the White House, Bush's ordered Karl Rowe
was political concederate to spare no effort to get Jimmy re-elected,
even if doing so creates a risk creating political
appropriations elsewhere.
The Bush White House's banned oil drilling off the coast of Florida,
even while encouraging it elsewhere, it is funneled
to the Everglades Rescue Project.
It is even kept a Pentagon Central Command in Tampa,
and wrote recently blocked an effort by GOP Farm State Senators
to open Cuba to American grain shipments,
and move opposed by Florida's virulently anti-castoral Cuban ex-out community.
Farm State GOP candidates were furious.
Jed nevertheless finds himself in a tight race with McBride,
who was as close to a dream candidate as the Democrats in Florida could find.
He has no Clinton baggage to speak of.
He has a Southern accent, good for hunting votes in the Panhandle.
He was opposed by party liberals, also good for hunting votes in the Panhandle.
He's a decorated Vietnam vet, also good for hunting votes in the Panhandle.
Turnout won't be a problem in the Mamma area counties
where we was robbed mentality, still poised two years after 2000.
Not surprisingly, Jed seemed unsettled when asked on NBC's today show
whether he wanted to seek the White House in 2008.
It's been a much tougher road a host so far than he or anyone else expected.
The presidency is far from his mind.
He joked that he might just as well want to become a priest.
As president, he is in fact a convert to Catholicism and a devout one.
I'm not sure he was speaking entirely ingest.
I know him from interviews to be a soulful sort,
given the kind of political introspection and doubt
that's utterly foreign to his hard-charging, never looking back big brother.
Between now and election day, the brother will have traveled a Florida at least twice.
He was just here. He's already been there ten times since taking office.
Ma and Pa raised money there early and often.
Kevin and members have flown in and out like so many snowbirds.
Will it be enough to save Jeb?
On election night, expect another big little brother call
for now we can only imagine what they'll be saying.
You know what I think? Hope they're going to be saying?
Paul!
Yeah.
I don't know if going from Texas say,
but that's what they ought to be saying.
Because I think he's going to get his ass-wooped.
And you know, they made a good point last night.
I think I forget what show it was on one of the talking heads.
How come wouldn't you think that if your daughter was in the trouble
let Noel is in and if she was standing there in court facing a time in jail
which she got and being taken away in handcuffs,
wouldn't you think that the father would be there?
I would be.
Was he there?
No.
He wasn't there.
And you want to know why? It's a bad photo op.
Oh well of course.
Yeah. Don't look good baby.
To be in court while your daughter is being taken away in handcuffs.
I mean what kind of a father that's always talking about family values
and being holier than now,
what kind of a father lets his daughter stand there along with her attorney in the court
and he ain't there for her.
Was the mom of there the smuggler?
No.
Now she was busy at shoplifting.
I mean they're doing something.
She was out with the no to writer.
Smuggling crap in.
Man oh man oh man.
I don't want to start you know when you get angry it's bad because then you get your blood boiling
you want to kill some people you know.
Which politician you despise the most we ask today?
Hillary Clinton's leading the pack.
What a surprise.
78 for good old swillery.
What a shock.
Second place Julie Rumin's moving up the pack.
Oh.
53.
A lot of these votes look pretty suspect to me but that's okay.
We'll take it.
Jeb Bush 52.
Greta and Hillary's ass.
Catherine Harris 44.
Ted Kennedy 28.
John Ascroft 25.
You know John Ascroft.
He's an asshole.
Jesse Helms 14.
Tom Delay 11.
Trent Lotz 7.
Dick Army 6.
Strom Thurman 6.
And Orrin Snatch has only four.
Poor Orrin Snatch only has four.
Pretty weak.
Wait to hear this story.
Alabama Chief Justice Defense 10 Commandments Monument.
The Chief Justice of Alabama Supreme Court said he installed a 5300 pound monument to the
10 Commandments in the stage of the initial building because he was concerned about the moral
decline of the nation.
Chief Justice Roy Moore testified for a second day yesterday in the trial of a federal
lawsuit seeking to remove the monument he had installed in the building's rotunda in the middle of the night.
The basic issue was whether we'll still be able to acknowledge God under the First Amendment or whether we will not be able to acknowledge God Moore said.
The lawsuit was filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center and Americans United for a separation of church and state on behalf of three Alabama attorneys.
They contend the monument promotes Moore's religion and violation of the Constitution and they are...
Testimony is expected to continue into next week.
Moore, a conservative Christian said he turned out to request a place to monument to atheism in the building's rotunda and that he would not allow a similar monument to the Hindu faith, Buddhism, Islam or any other religion.
This is not the place for more our system of justice was drawn he testified.
He said he also rejected plans by various Christian groups to place other Christian symbols in the rotunda.
I don't want to return to become a hanging garden of different ideas he said.
The granite monument features the King James Bible version of the Ten Commandments sitting on top of a granite block.
Around the monument are quotes from historical figures and documents such as the Declaration of Independence which Moore said support his belief that the Ten Commandments are the moral foundation of American law.
Moore said he didn't share his plans for the monument with other justices, a committee that oversees the building, the governor or the public before installing in the middle of the night.
In the middle of the night on July 31st 2001.
He did tell Florida TV preacher the anxious DJ James Kennedy who had accrued from the installation offered videotapes of it for a donation of 19 bucks.
For 19 bucks you can see him sticking it.
Moore also questioned why his monument was on trial and not the fountain and monument in front of the federal courthouse which includes the scales of justice in the face of the Greek goddess of justice.
How do you like that?
How come they're picking on him and not those goddamn Greeks?
Why in local?

Paul Krugman writes today's New York Times
Springtime for Hitler
You may recall that George W. Bush promised among other things
To change the tone in Washington
He made good on that promise the tone has certainly changed
As far as I know in the past
It wasn't considered appropriate for the occupant of the White House
To declare that members of the opposition party
Weren't interested in the nation's security
And it certainly wasn't usual to compare anyone who wants to
To tax the rich
Or even anyone who estimates the sheer of last year's
Tax cut that went to the wealthy to wait off Hitler
Okay maybe we should discount remarks by Senator Filogram
When Mr. Graham declared that they propose
A to impose a one-time capital gains living on people who
Renounce you as citizenship in order to avoid paying taxes
Was right out of Nazi Germany
Even the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee
Charles Grassley objected to the comparison
But Mr. Grassley must have thought better of his objection
Since just a few weeks later he decided to use the Hitler analogy himself
He said I'm sure voters will get their fellow statistics
Plainly that the Bush tax cut hands out 40% of its benefits
To the top 1% of taxpayers
This is not nearly misleading its outright false
Some folks must be under the impression
As long as something is repeated often and often it will become true
That was how Adolf Hitler got to the top
For the record Robert McIntyre of Citizens for Tax Justice
The original source of that 40% estimate is no Adolf Hitler
The amazing thing is that Mr. Grassley is sometimes described as a moderate
His remarks are just one more indicator that we've entered an
Era of extreme partisanship, one that leaves no room for the acknowledgement of politically inconvenient facts
For the claim that Mr. Grassley describes his outright false is in fact almost certainly true
An irrational word would even be a matter for argument
You might imagine that Mr. Grassley has in his hand an alternative answer to the question
How much of the tax cut will go to the top 1%
The administration has at some point produced a number showing that the wealthy aren't getting a big share of the benefits
In fact however administration officials have never answered that question
When press they've always insisted on answering some other questions
But last year the Treasury Department did release a table showing somewhat inadvertently
That more than 25% of the income tax cut will go to people making more than $200,000 a year
This number doesn't include the effects of a state tax repeal
In 1999 only 2% of the states paid any tax and half of that tax was paid by only 1,600 of the percent of the states
The number also probably doesn't take account of the alternative minimum tax
Which will snatch away most of the income tax cut for upper middle class families but won't affect the rich
Put all this together becomes clear that though sure enough something like 40% of the tax cut
It could be a bit less but probably it's considerably more
We'll go to 1% of the population
And the administration's systematic evasiveness on the question of who benefits from the tax cuts
Amounts to a plea of no or contenderay
Which brings us back to the new tone in Washington
When Ronald Reagan cut taxes on rich people he didn't deny that that's what he was doing
You could agree or disagree with the supply side economic theory he used to justify his actions
But he didn't pretend that he was increasing the progress of the tax system
The strategy used to sell the bush tax cut was simply to deny the facts and to lash out at anyone who tried to point them out
And it's a strategy that having worked there is now being applied across the board
Michael Kinzley recently wrote that the bush campaign for war against Iraq has been insulting to American citizens
Not just because it's been dishonest but because it's been unsurious
A lie is insulting and obvious lie is doubly insulting
All I can say is now he notices it's been like that all along an economic policy
You see some folks must be under the impression as long as something is repeated often enough it'll become true
That's how George W. Bush got to the top
Right Paul Krugman in today's New York Times

Heavy duty
Relious former case worker arrested
Police arrested Relia Wilson's former case worker yesterday on charges that she stole money from the state by claiming she was visiting foster children
Why actually working as a substitute teacher?
Deborah Muskelli a 16 year veteran of the Department of Children and Families made off of more than 7800 bucks from the agency for hours she didn't work
Times she could have spent visiting Relia Wilson or other children her care investigators say
Anybody seen Relia lately by the way? No
No
Had Muskelli 45 made the required monthly visits to the five year old
It wouldn't have had taken the agency 15 months to notice that the Miami girl was missing DCF officials have said
The girl's disappearance has set off a firestorm in the state causing an agency shake up delivered the resignation of DCF chiefs in August
Muskelli of Pemberpine stands accused of 11 counts of grand theft 21 counts of official misconduct and 9 counts of petty theft
She faces up to five years in prison
Muskelli is the fifth person connected with Relia Wilson to be arrested in the past three weeks
Earlier this month police arrested the girl's former caretakers Jorland and Pamela Graham
Well you know about them
Yeah get those fingers working Jeb
Jorland and Pamela Graham on fraud and theft charges the arrested Jorland Graham and her two grown children Leo and Jacqueline Epson on lesser charges
As prosecutors and police agencies vigorously pursue every possible lead in the attempt to locate Relia Wilson
We've uncovered a variety of figures and crimes dated Thurney a Catherine Fernandez Rundle said yesterday
However the defense attorneys for those arrested say other motivations lie behind the arrests
It's really a pathetic attempt to distract the public's attention from law enforcement's failure to solve the real tragedy
Which is the disappearance of the little girls and Muskelli's attorney George palace
Muskelli worked in two honorable albeit underpaid professions and to be treated like this is pitiful
Muskelli also known as Deborah Wallace
Also known as Deborah Wallace don't look at me
Surrendered at the FDLE headquarters in West Miami-Dade
It was being held at the Turner Guildford night detention center on $20,000 bail late last night
The D.C.F. officials declined to comment on her arrest
You go boy that's you have he's doing it man
You're I'm just like two and a half weeks it's two days less three days less than three weeks now
Right two and a half weeks to election day
I just want to see the look on his post when he gets his ass whipped by Bill McBride which he will he's gonna lose
Yeah
I just want to see the look on his post you know
He might look just like like Alfred E. Newman
He might have that deer in headlights kind of dumb look because I guess it runs into family
You know he usually don't have that look he saves it for his brother but he might just borrow it that night
When he's so far behind that even the even Catherine Harris won't be able to find enough votes to steal
And guess what all you dark folks out there this time they're gonna have to let you guys vote
Two three times to make up for last time don't you think about that?

And let me say it again the fact that Jeb Bush wasn't in that courtroom with no well is enough to make you want to puke your guts out even on guiding light poor Reva's on trial there for her life for a couple of weeks ago
And if Josh in there in the courtroom
People are going to say what's that if her kids aren't there in the courtroom to give her oral support people are going to say what's that all about right right this graceful
But you know you bushlickers out there you can rationalize anything because your minds are closed okay good right wingers man with no ability to think just like the religious fanatics
Oh excuse me am I getting redundant now is that what is happening
Yes this is disturbing but not surprising the administration of Florida governor Jeb Bush is apparently retaliated against a professor of public administration and FSU who was scared to speak of the state library conference last week
According to the St. Petersburg Times Lance Dave and Smith has written columns critical of the Republican Party in Florida declaring that Al Gore should have been declared winner of the 2000 presidential election shortly after the latter column he was told he was no longer a luncheon speaker
Victoria Pendleton of the Bureau of Library development explained by email that preparing for our transition to the governor's office is making folks sensitive to anything which may be construed as inappropriate
This has had an impact on the conference agenda but later said that the haven Smith was dropped only because of the focus of the conference had changed
Right right
Who the hell are you kid in the sweetheart
A federal judge asked that they ordered the Bush administration to turn over key documents about its energy task force for a second time
While government lawyers gave notice they plan to take their case to an appeals court before complying
US district judge M. G. Sullivan gave lawyers representing vice president Cheney to November 5 to produce documents that detailed the membership roles and meeting schedules of the national energy policy development group
which Cheney chaired Sullivan or to the same documents turned over in August
If the government doesn't produce the documents by that November date Sullivan said the administration must have been acclaimed of executive privilege and the reasons for it
The hour long hearing marked by a series of sharp exchanges between Sullivan and Shannon W. Coffin, the Justice Department attorney handling the case, is the latest development one of a handful of lawsuits that have sought to force the Bush administration to release information about the task force and they're not talking
They're mum
Could be too embarrassing especially all they ordered in the game till November 5th
What a strange coincidence, huh?
Figures don't lie says the Orlando Sentinel tax cuts hurt Bush's chances
Jeb Bush laid the foundation for his political vulnerability shortly after his election
He went into his first legislative session in 1999 with $3 billion next to cash thanks primarily to a robust economy and floated settlement with tobacco companies
His priority was clear he wanted a $1.25 billion tax cut aimed mainly at businesses and wealthier residents. Oh, what a surprise!
He proposed only about half that for increased school spending which did a little more than meet growth
Much of his tax cut would come by slashing a statewide property tax use for school operations a permanent cut based on temporary almost freakish economic conditions
The more moderate Senate demanded more for schools unless for tax cuts the compromise was a billion for each
The 2000 budget year also came flush with cash Bush proposed 578 million more in tax cuts much of it aimed at wealthier residents surprise again
And again the Senate cut the cut while getting more for schools
All this time critics and pundits questioned the tax cuts saying the state was putting itself at risk when the economic bubble burst
And Paul showed the majority would prefer excess money be spent on education not on tax cuts
This wasn't surprising given that the miniscule amount most people got from the tax cuts anyway
But Bush's budgets reflected his core belief that the problem with schools is not so much of a lack of money but a failure to demand results from the education bureaucracy
The economic bubble burst last year but despite budget shortfalls Bush pushed for another 313 million in tax cuts again most of it aimed at wealthier residents
He asked for only a $531 million increase in education about half the previous year's amount
Again the Senate got him reduced the tax cut and boost school spending by the end of 2001 with the recession worsened by the terrorist attack
Bush called a special session to cut $639 million from education but that didn't stop him only a few months later from pushing through a corporate tax break that will amount to $420 million by 2004
His initial proposal for education this year's budget did a little more than put back what had been cut even some house leaders balked
Bush eventually boosted the amount to almost a billion dollars
In total Bush's tax cuts will have taken about $6 billion out of the budget in his first term that money could have paid for universal pre-K and smaller classes in K-3 where it does the most good
These may have headed off the class size referendum
The amount his cuts will take from the budget in future years may have well paid for most of the class size reduction measure on a ballot
Bush's education reforms look promising but haven't had enough time to show concrete results
This leads Bill McBride free to blame our poor academic ranking on large classes poorly paid teachers and low-per-people spending all a reflection of stingy funding
Meanwhile residents in central Florida have voted time and time again to spend more on schools in local referendums the governor is out of touch which is why McBride has a chance
If Bush does win he may well thank Senate leaders such as Tony Jennings for limiting the damage he's done to himself
Right's my Thomas and the Orlando Sentinel yesterday
How do you like them apples huh? Our education governor
Yeah
Means spirited right wing phony baloney hypocritical finger pointing third burger
Woody Harrelson writes in the Guardian in the UK you know what he hearlson yeah I don't I'm an American tired of American lies he writes
The man who drives me to and from work is named Woody too as relief to me as it minimizes the chances of my forgetting his name
I call him woodman he calls me wood
He's become my best friend here even though he's upset that I have quit drinking beer
He's smart funny and there's nothing he hasn't seen in 33 years behind the wheel of his black cab
He drove me for a while before I felt confident he liked me he doesn't like people easily especially if they have a rat
Forbusting up black cabs
Woodman and I agree about a lot of things but one thing we can never agree about is Iraq he thinks the only language
Sodom understands his brute force. I don't believe we should be bombing cities and our quest for one man
We've killed a million Iraqis since the start of the Gulf War mostly by blocking humanitarian aid. Let's stop now
Thankfully most of the Brits I talked to about the work closer to me than to Woodman only your prime minister doesn't seem to have noticed
I've been here three months doing a play in the West and I'm having a time the time of my life
I love England the people the parks the theater the play is great the audiences have been a dream probably I should just relax be happy and talk about the weather
But this war is under my skin and affects my sleep
I remember playing basketball with an Iraqi in the late eighties when Iran and Iraq were at war I didn't know at the time that the US and Britain were supplying weapons to both sides
I asked why they were always at war with each other and he said something that stayed with me if we were up to the people there would be peace
It's the governments that create war he said and now my government is creating its second war in less than a year
No war requires two combat and so I should say its second bombing campaign
I went to the White House when Harvey Weinstein was showing Clinton the movie welcome to Sarah Havo which I was in
I got a few moments alone with Clinton
Sodom throwing out the weapons inspectors was all over the news I asked him what he was going to do his answer was very revealing
He said everybody's telling me to bomb him all the military are saying he got a bomb him but if even one innocent person died I couldn't bear it
And I look in his eyes and I believed him little that I know he was blocking humanitarian aid at the time allowing the deaths of thousands of innocent people
I'm a father in no amount of propaganda can convince me that a half a million dead children is acceptable as collateral damage
The fact is that Sodom Hussein was our boy the CIA helped him to power as they did the Shah of Iran and Nurega and Mark Austin the Taliban and countless other brutal tyrants
The fact is that Bush senior continued to supply nerve gas and technology to Sodom even after he used it on Iran and then the Kurds in Iraq
While the Anastey International report listing countless Sodom atrocities including gas and into a torture encourage was sitting on his desk
Bush senior pushed through a two billion dollar agricultural loan factory gave hundreds of millions of export credit to Sodom the other Bush then had the audacity to quote the Anastey reports to Garner support for his oil war
A decade later shrub follows the same line we have no quarrel with the Iraqi people I'm sure a half a million Iraqi parents are scratching their heads over that I'm an American tired of lies and with our government it's mostly lies
The history taught in our schools is scandalous we grew up believing that Columbus actually discovered America we still celebrate Columbus Day Columbus was after only one thing gold
As the natives were showering him with gifts and kindness he wrote in his diary they do not bear arms they have no iron with 50 men we could subjectate them all and make them do whatever we want
Columbus is the perfect symbol of US foreign policy to this day
This is a racist and imperialist war the war mongers who stole the White House you call them Hawks but I would never disparage such a fine bird have hijacked the nation's grief and turn it into an in a perpetual war on any non-white country they choose to describe as terrorist
To the man of Washington the world is just a giant monopoly board oddly enough Americans generally know how the government works the politicians do everything they can for the people the people who put them in power
The giant industries that are polluting our planet as well as violating human rights worldwide are the ones nearest and nearest to the hearts of Americans politicians
But in wartime people lose their senses there are flags and yellow ribbons and posters and every media outlet is beating the war drum and even sensible people can hear nothing else
In the US got forbid you suggested wars unjust or that dropping cluster bombs from 30,000 feet on the city is a cowardly act
When TV satirist Bill Maher made some of the sending remarks about the bombing of Afghanistan Disney pulled a plug on him rightfully so and a company that logs its freedom of speech award him to send can cost you your job
I read in a paper here about a woman who held out on the part of her taxes that would go into the war effort something like 17%
I like that idea though in the US it would have to be more like 50%
If you consider money as a form of energy then we see half our taxes and half the US government's energy focused on war and weapons of mass destruction
Over the past 30 years this amounts to more than $10,000,000
Imagine that money going to preserving rainforest or contributing to a sustainable economy as opposed to the dinosaur tit were currently in the process of sucking dry
I've given to woodman and we stopped for a few beers he asked me what I do in bushy shoes easy at honor Kyoto
Join the world court at stop subsidizing earth rapers like Vonsano Dupont and Exxon
I've shut down the nuclear power plants so I already have $200,000,000 save from corporate welfare
I'd save another hundred billion by stopping the war on non corporate drugs
And I'd cut the defense budget in half so they'd have to get by them easily 200 billion a year
I've already saved half a trillion bucks by saying no to polluters and war mongers
Then I'd give back $300 billion to the taxpayers I'd take the rest and pay the people teaching our children what they deserve
I'd put a hundred billion into alternative fuels and renewable energy
I'd revive the Tamergi movement which made the farmer and the root of the economy and make paper the fuel from wheat straw, rice straw and hemp
Not only would I attend I'd sponsor the earth summit and of course I'd give myself a fat raise
Woodman dropped me at home asked me if I asked if I liked his ideas he offers a real luck and yes as he pulls away he yells out
But I'd never vote for a man who can't handle a few pints at the end of the day
How do you like that huh?
We thought he was just a dope smoke and bumpkin

H-I-L-L-A-R-Y.
Hillary. Hillary.
Let me put you to 560 WQM.
Four students have been taking hostage in Germany.
South Easton, Germany in high school.
Age is 10 to 16.
And we got that bus bombing minilla.
Everything's looking great folks.
Everything's looking up. Markets up a few points again. There you go.
Ha ha ha. Speak on a Hillary.
Students protest Senator Clinton's decision to backbush his war plans.
About 7580 war protesters angered by Hillary,
who had him Clinton's decision to backpresent a Bush's war plans in Iraq,
pick it in and dress given by the Senator at the new school this past Monday night.
Three new school students rejected around 6.30 p.m. when they stuck in the back of the auditorium,
where Clinton was speaking and began yelling protest logons.
You bitch!
When a reporter tried to enter the event,
she was informed that no press would be allowed at the invitee's request.
Oh, well excuse us.
The sold-out event was hosted by new school president former Nebraska Senator Bob Kerry.
A spokesman for the new school said that while media are generally allowed to report on public addresses by elected officials,
the request came from Clinton's office for the press not to be admitted.
Sometimes events are open to the press.
Sometimes they're not Clinton press secretary said on Tuesday.
The Edhott protest, which was announced on activists,
a list serves and on the website protest.net.
You're mostly NYU and new school students, but also other concerned adults.
I think it was a cowardly thing to do said Ellen Davidson,
associate director of publications for the new school,
commenting on Clinton's decision to go along with the war.
I think she was looking out more for her career than what her constituents wanted.
More saying to her added Davidson was passing out homemade masks of Clinton
with the words spineless printed over her face.
Excellent.
And opponents of the war with the rag-told senator,
Jew Lieberman, that the government was heading in the wrong direction
during the former vice president's presidential candidate's visit to Daniel Webster College this week.
Lieberman was one of 29 Democrats who voted for the war resolution,
giving President Bush the authority to use military force against a racky-leaded goddamn sauté,
and Hussein, all but one Republican in the Senate's of while we know that.
The National Democratic City Committee hosted a coffee and muffin get together,
Tuesday morning at Daniel Webster's College Student Union.
College campuses are typically friendly places for Democrats,
and a good humor Lieberman did a share of picture signing and cracking jokes,
while Lieberman's talk focused on bread and butter issues,
people attending the session, questioned him about foreign policy.
War critic Morton Goulder of Hollisthold Lieberman,
the idea of starting war in the Middle East, is foolish.
Goulder is a former deputy assistant secretary of defense and a president next in the Ford and Carter.
He helped found the defense industry company formerly known as Sanders, now BAE Systems.
Preemptive strikes against people you don't like is crazy, he said.
Goulder totally remembered Bush as a terrorist in the White House.
Lieberman's right and associate professor at Revere College totally wrench he was a fan of his,
but said his vote in favor of the war resolution was disappointing.
There is a very silent majority of people opposing the move to war said right,
who registered as a Republican and support senator John McCain in the 2000 election.
My prayer was the resolution of unity will lead to UN action.
Let me read it again.
My prayer is this resolution of unity will lead to UN direction Lieberman said that he laid that nobody wants to go to war.
Right, his prayer, the dissent is healthy, he said.
Screw him.
Turn burger, baby.
Turn burger.
Oh, you're like this.
I enjoyed it by the way, it's going to vote at Treasure Island after I read this story.
Okay, this will, well, this will give you the courage.
Coats Minnesota prosecutors charge 95 people with forgery this Wednesday for an alleged scheme in which they all registered to vote using the same address.
A strip club recently shut down by city officials.
Most of the alleged foragers, foragers lived outside the town.
The scheme in which the club's owner was also charged could have given club supporters a political majority in the town of 163 people.
The mayor and two council members are in contested races next month in coats where 79 voted in the 2000 general election.
79 people voted in the election.
It's shocking to see such a blatant attempt to undermine the most fundamental pillar of our democracy.
Our right to vote to code of county attorney James Baxter said the relation to the former Montreal Canadian Ralph Baxter.
Club owner Richard J Jacobson, 32 of Prescott, Wisconsin, which charged with conspiracy to commit forgery and conspiracy to commit our lawful voting for allegedly orchestrating the scheme.
The other 94 were charged with forgery and conspiracy to commit forgery.
All the charges are fell on these needs.
These charges are the maximum sentence of three years in prison.
Baxter said he believed some of the defendants were employees at the club called Jakes.
But thought most were customers who might have been duped in the signing of the registration cards.
A federal judge ordered Jakes closed last week for violating the city's law regulating sexually-oriented businesses.
Reached that the club Jacobson declined to comment.
Coses about 15 miles south of St. Paul.
So why not just register and vote over there.
Treasure Island sounds good to me.
I'll start it up. Halloween.
How's that pull coming on the politician?
Now that noon to one hour, don't let me forget.
I got some more jingles and stuff on there.
I want to play because I enjoy that New York thing.
And even if somebody out there didn't too bad.
Got to mix it up a little bit.
Okay, with all this depressing morbid things going on.
Area hospitals in middle of put on code blue alert.
Denized and don't want to say.
They have actual suspects.
The pinpoint understood.
How about where this explosion occurred?
Did it happen in a residential area?
Was it in a downtown area?
Can you give us information on that?
It was it was in a relatively densely populated area in the kind of northern most tip of metrimanilla.
It you could expect a lot of people who would be on their way home from a long day at work to have filled this box.
They would have been headed to kind of the more rural or suburban areas just outside of the city.
Police say many casualties expected in the blast.
Many.

17th of noon at 560 WQM.
You're looking at the Atlantis.
Are you excited about that?
You're not.
There you go.
Touchdown.
Have a trick is when you are.
Well, I got to put something on here.
You notice, maybe we'll have another one at noon today.
It seems right about noon.
They have another press conference to tell us all the information we had before was a bunch of lives.
We don't know anything.
And just leave us alone and don't interfere.
What kind of asshole?
Defaults witness?
Oh, man.
Oh, man.
This guy just made everything up.
He was inside the home depot.
He saw nothing.
And he embellishes it and makes up this whole story about the description of the van.
It was cream colored and I broke it left tail light.
And then they're out there looking for this.
Right.
Everything in this country is a joke.
That's part of the problem.
You got wise guy assholes.
Everything is a joke or he's also looking for that reward.
Yeah, but how are you going to get the reward with made up story?
Don't start asking logic or quite.
I think I was a scumbag.
He was a deadbeat.
Yeah.
You know those deli slicers that slice the ham?
Yeah.
Then absolute little layered.
Yeah.
Just like they used to try to slice up Batman and Robin on Batman.
Never quite a work with them because they always got something out of the utility belt.
Probably this guy don't have a utility belt.
Just disgrace.
But you get to the point where you start to wonder and I realize there's six million people plus on the face of the globe.
But you start to wonder can we find anybody or arrest anybody?
Anybody?
Or convict them if we forget about that.
Except those two little kids which thank God the judge there said I don't think that whole thing was kosher.
But at any rate I mean you got Osama Yamama you got Mula Omar you got Alza Bahiri you got the terror the sniper whatever the hell is name whatever he is you got whoever killed Chandra you got whoever killed Elizabeth smart little girl you got all these things.
We got Robert Blake and Jail so don't you feel safer now?
Oh yeah.
I'm starting to get on your side about that let him out okay the bitch deserved it all right.
Christian Wanderer.
Right that's right.
That good Christian Brando Wanderer said hey you better watch it bitch he's nuts.
In fact if there's one thing that George always told me says you know that Robert Blake he's a little I like him but somebody's going to go out and kill some people right.
He did well we don't know that he did but anyway I'm saying we caught him because he was like just slumpy and from being stupid that's right.
But in the meantime we can't track down anybody requires tracking down.
We can't track down even when we think we got the killer there we say oh well so and so isn't a suspect how about John but hey how we doing with that.
We had those couple of stories a few days ago about this other what the hell's the guy's name some speak that they're interviewing and investigating he's in prison for some other crap.
He killed didn't kill raped.
Yeah.
Raked it.
I hear you.
Raked it at Moan at the place to there.
This is the rumor we're spreading around.
No he raped a couple of girls in there and at the park where Shandra's body was found.
So another question to me but nobody's ever a suspect nobody ever gets convicted and it just goes on and on.
Now if you're out there buying a nickel bag or something like it see Vems house then you're going to get 20 years then they're going to nail your ass you're going to get 20 years.
Because that's what it's all about in this country our priorities are all totally screwed up.
Helen Thomas of all people a good old Helen Thomas writes and they see adult post intelligence here are this past Wednesday see a lot of this stuff I didn't get to yesterday because we were doing all that oldie moldy stuff all the jingles which was great.
She writes the bitter battle between Republicans and Democrats to control Congress in next month's election is too close to call political leaders are predicting victory for their own parties but independent experts simply shrug their shoulders when you ask them to forecast the outcome.
For instance Charlie Cook who publishes the cook report on politics says that if the voters decide that the election is about the economy then expect the Democrats to catch a break in the close races November 5 but he adds a voters place a premium on supporting their commander in chief then Republicans will likely catch the late breaks and win a disproportionate cheer of the closest races.
And President Bush war in Tirith worries haven't tied him down in Washington in the run up to the election he's off to more than 20 states in the next three weeks campaigning for Republicans in a marathon that'll keep him on the road for more than he'll be at home.
He has headlined 63 Republican fundraisers so far and racked up $141 million for the party coffers together he invites President Cheney abroad in more than 158 million far over shadowing the Democrats measly take of about 92 million.
Bush sees his politicking as crucial because his poster John as I've he says the election outcome is about as close as you can get with some races razor thin.
Republicans not control the House by six votes and Democrats hold a Senate by one the GOP also commands the nation state houses with 27 governors to the Democrats 21 they're two independence democratic national chairman Terry McCallis as he thinks his party will pick up two to three Senate seats but he's not optimistic about capturing the House he says that it would only be it would be tough but doable.
McCallis however is exuberant about democratic chances in the gubernatorial race is saying we're headed Massachusetts Rhode Island Pennsylvania Illinois Michigan Arizona Mexican Tennessee and Kansas and he predicts democratic challenger Bill McBride is going to be governor Jeb Bush in Florida.
But no one doubts that James brother the president will be trying to ride to the rescue with another appearance in Florida which we just had Jim Vecchio Republican party spokesman says the GOP thinks it has a real opportunity to regain the Senate and we figured about our position in the House.
With many races so close he adds the Republicans are sending hundreds of volunteers around the country to join door to door grassroots efforts to get out the vote.
Doug says the Republicans have a good chance to win Senate races and Missouri South Dakota Minnesota Jojo New Jersey no chance in New Jersey and additionally says we're working hard in North Carolina South Carolina pecs is an Arkansas.
Republicans hope so when Bush zoomed in like a laser beam in recent weeks to put the country on a war footing against Iraq it was following the script laid out last January when Carl Rove his chief political adviser sent a memo to GOP operatives telling them that they would ultimately be playing the war card.
According to published reports Bush deliberately withheld his frontal rhetorical assault on Iraq Saddam Hussein until closer to the election the New York Times quoted White House chief of staff card is saying from a marketing point of view you don't introduce new products in August.
The recent focus on Iraq is pushed all the other issues into the background including the week economy the corporate misdeeds the shaky stock market the high cost of prescription drugs and the Republicans hope of privatizing social security system.
But now that Congress is given Bush nearly all he wanted on his war with the rack resolution the Democrats are trying once more to make the economic slow down the number one issue.
McCollough says that on his trips around the country is found people are worried about joblessness and a possible recession he notes that since Bush took office two million people have lost their jobs and that even before the 9-11 terrorist catastrophe the president wiped out the budgets are plus indicted in the social security trust fund this is the worst economic slumps in Herbert Hoover McCollough says.
Zagbi reported that two thirds of likely voters say they're worried about dwindling retirement funds in their 401k and Ira accounts that's why Republican Democratic candidates find themselves coping with the politics of disappointment he says according to Zagbi people are not only disappointed in the economic malaise but also in the disgrace of many priests and corporate CEOs the frustrating war on terrorism and the FBI and CIA dropping the ball in their intelligence departments it's all come home to Roos to concludes.
I hope the Democrats at least retain control of the Senate Congress a rack resolution gives Bush too much power in the company the Senate that can provide some checks on his headlong dive into war his favor the rich economic policy and his campaign to put right wing ideologues on the Supreme Court otherwise we'll have an imperial presidency with nothing but a genuine fleeting Congress and a me too Supreme Court rights old Helen Thomas pretty good how about that stop Helen for an old bat.
Mary McGroy another one rights in the Washington Post yesterday mistaken patriots where she rips the Democrats and ass and deservedly so she says our Democrats making a major effort to reduce voter turnout in the coming election or they just trying to fight free of the trap they diligently fashion for themselves on the subject of the war with Iraq by their conduct on the issue in recent congressional debate they seemed eager to show there was no difference between them and the Republicans a strategy that guarantees voters will ask themselves when it comes to digging out of a cool.
The world of November morning why bother by way of preparing for the election Democrats decided to get the war issue out of the way by overwhelmingly backing President Bush is desire to blow the view without the blessing of the win they ensure that the commander achieve will be at center stage the papers thrive with accounts of his minions moving troops and launching training exercises as if war had been declared.
She pushed Democrats continue to show the electorate that when it comes to the faithful business sending young Americans into battle they are at one with the Republicans they turn aside the known skepticism of the uniform military they were undeterred by the newly enunciated doctrine of preventive war which all previous presidents have rejected while they declared in their floor speeches that they were uncertain of the danger posed by Saddam Hussein their votes that they were mindful of the danger to themselves and they were taking no chances.
Candidates around the country were on their own and trying to make judgments about the right thing to do the debate won't help them much.
The votes in both houses of Congress for the new Tonkin Gulf resolution are still being studied for surprises and contradictions especially by liberals who according to the post Thomas Edsel are outraged by the absence of strong convictions in the part of their leaders.
Senate Democrats are quick to blame House Democratic leader Dick Kemphardt who has wraparound ambitions to be either president or House Speaker.
They say a coalition of moderates from both parties who wanted you and approval of the use any use of force fell apart when Ghibhardt emerged as Bush's chief lobbyist on the hill.
Republicans said they didn't want to be to the left of Ghibhardt and the coalition collapsed.
The whole slated Democratic presidential hopefuls lined up for the president's right to make war unilaterally of all of them Senator John Kerry had a unique foreign policy perch.
A decorated war veteran who also came home and let a brilliant demonstration win the war he delivered a sophisticated critique of the botched hunt for Osama bin Laden but he joined the gang voting for the president such notable peace mixes Tom Harkin, Chris Dodd and Tom Dachel not to mention Swillery Clinton.
The majority leader hated to do it but in the end he threw in the towel to show the world the country is unified on the issue.
The country is ambivalent on the one hand it's all for a short sharp replay of Gulf War I that would be a relatively casualty free exercise but bringing up body bags they recoil.
Paul show that the country would rather have the president protected from the wolf at the door, layoffs, market collapses and the like than from the beast of Baghdad who might nuke us if he got the right stuff.
Ted Kennedy made daily speeches against going to war he and Robert C. Brewer longer than rivals did their best but Kennedy couldn't even convince his son in the House Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island that he should give peace of chance.
Rhode Island did however offer the Senate's only Republican profile and courage Lincoln Chaffey pay full to his father's legendary independence voted no.
The Democrats hope that with the war issues settled they can drag that settled with like the quotes that Jebouj with the war issues settled they can drag voters attention back to the economy which can be criticized without fear of being called unpatriotic.
Bush brushes them off you know like my tax cuts okay you want to rescind them no of course not the Democrats protest.
Post their Peter Hart thinks the economy doesn't need much rhetoric the ravages are all around and brought home in people's reports about their 401k's and people can recall the Clinton boom to be reminded of how different things can be.
At the height of that debate House with Nancy Pelosi implore Democrats remember that while the show force in Iraq would surely demonstrate US power negotiation and diplomacy would show our strength her colleagues were not listening.
Democrats know exactly how they feel about prescription drugs and the privatization of Social Security but when it comes to war and peace people dying and all of that they really have no comment they just salute the commander in chief and hope voters mistake them for patriots.
Rice Murray McGrawy yesterday's Washington Post nice go on Mary you go girl you go sweetheart.
Got a lot of phony votes on the poll today but that's okay give it out of your system I've got a big heavy duty weekend coming up a lot of pressure a lot of stress.

The Modesto v. newspaper reported that Arthur Pratt, who's
skinned, was covered with more than 20 deep tooth marks, died
Sunday at a local hospital that the forensic, local forensic
pathologist believed the bites are likely to cause a death.
The husband was able to dial 911 that night, Carter told the
newspaper.
We have a taper recording him screaming while she was
biting him.
When officers arrived, he was screaming that he'd been
assaulted.
She fought with the officers and tried to bite them too.
Arthur Pratt had a history of medical problems, including
diabetes, heart and circulation problems.
An official ruling on the possible homicide charges awaiting
toxicology tests, which could determine whether the bites caused
an infection that proved fatal to be said, in
farcina infection, and farcina is a heart attack.
Get with it.
Carter said police were already persuaded that his death was
a result of being bitten.
I've seen cases where dogs have bitten kids and blood
or loss of infection that led to death.
Carter said, I've never heard of anyone being bitten to death
by a human before.
County Pratt has currently been held in Modesto about 90 miles
east of San Francisco.
I'm charges of elder abuse, domestic violence and
assault on a police officer.
Murdered by biting.
Got a lot of people around here with biting comments.
I bet he regrets not having sex with her.
Turning her down.
You know something, maybe he figures it was worth it.
Maybe he'd rather go out and kill some people than have sex
with that bitch.

It says, hi Neil, did you happen to see the Miami-Hero's election recommendations
in today's Browet Section page 8?
Did they really endorse Senator Mandy Dawson?
Isn't she the one busted for forging a prescription?
Isn't she the one the hero once did an article that she lied about her degree?
And that she was officially scolded for not showing up for important votes in the Senate?
I believe her record says she has only shown up for 20% of the sessions.
I also believe she was once arrested for forging bad checks.
You know what's stuff like this that gives our Democratic Party a bad name?

Didn't he look like Carlos with facial hair?
Well, not quite as ugly. Yes, he does.
Well, that's our thing. That's our cartridge.
Well, thank you very much.

This is not the same thing.
I did that again.
You see, if you pause it,
you see how that's all screwed up?
If you pause it, it just, I don't know.
Don't want to play right.
I'm sure that if it was Carlos, he'd come right in here and say,
oh, here, let me show you how to do it.
No thanks, Carlos.
Stay away from me.

this book is George, you know.
And we already know about...
We already know about that last turn.
That uh...
You turn.
August?
That was bad.
It was bad.
Really bad.
Of course the whole station, other than I'm trying to think that the Humper go back,
he went back down a little bit in August, didn't he?
August was just bad all the way around.
Yeah it was.
August was pretty then week.
So September is going to see how this summer book goes.
And then of course there's some people on the station who's so far, they have yet to throw
on a good month in there.
You know what I mean?
I don't want to mention any names, but there's some people who's just haven't thrown
anything in there.
Pretty big.
Yeah, we'll see.
We'll also get the hour by hour breakdown, right?
Not on Monday.
No, no, not on Monday, but we'll book.
Well that'll build up the suspense.
Two-day Wednesday.
We can like kill at least three-fifths of a week next week.
We need to know the nine to one from August instead of the ten to three.
So I can squeeze another point.
Oh, no, no, don't start playing that again.

Do they have Temple lingerie?
In fact, he's already got the magic underwear going underneath there.
Underneath his dress.
This is depressing.
Okay, right at the end of the show, somebody faxes me this.
The Archdiocese have doubled in his currently facing.
450 legal actions has a result of clerical child sex abuse allegations.
The RTE program primetime reported last night.
A leading cannon lawyer, father Tom Doerl, has expressed disquiet.
With the way cases have been handled within the Archdiocese, this is in Ireland, Dublin.
I guess they're doubling their pleasure.
He told the program that from what the knowledge he's gathered about handling a
Perkyl child sex abuse in Dublin, he believed there was something radically, radically wrong.
That's what he said.
Radically, radically wrong.
Father Doerl has investigated many cases in Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
Maybe he checked out Harold Ballard to make believe gardens.
He made his comments on the Dublin cases at the beginning of a primetime special program last night.
Which reviewed how the cases have been dealt with the detailed accounts of cases
of abuse by eight priests of which at least six bishops became aware but didn't do nothing.
So you want to think about the Catholic Church.
They may not be good to release their consistent.
Here are some of the best news we've had in years, which you're probably already aware of.
When I saw this, I just about jumped with Glee.
Who's he?
Doerl, are you getting canned? Is the alluding sentence?
Oh, I heard about this.
Yes indeed.
Hallelujah.
Doerl computer said it's blonde-haired surfer, dude, pitchman, Stephen, played by actor Ben Curtis,
one of the most annoying people in the history of the human race,
will be taking a break despite helping to increase sales for the company since the campaign went on air two years ago.
Doerl's already started aiming less dude-centric ads that feature a group of eager interns, one of whom don't look too bad to me, by the way.
The company refused to say whether Stephen is just taking a breather or whether the campaign is a goner.
Get lost, Stephen.
This doesn't mean the end of Del's association with the Stephen character, Del Sporxman Bob Kaufman said,
we're just trying new things looking at alternatives.
Kaufman said, Stephen ads are still wearing around the country.
Let's just hope and pray that we don't have to see any of them.
Whether or not they'll run along in the future, I can't say right now, he said,
not so good news for so many of the fans of the dude ads, which has developed a strong cult following.
NBC's Saturday Night Live spoof the character, his admirers posted Ben Curtis trivion websites,
and bulletin boards buzzed anytime Del released a new commercial featuring the late back spokesman.
Oh my god, when you want to know why?
Why?
Because he was on television, dummy.
Oh, dude.
Curtis 21 was a struggling drama student from New York when he beat out more than 100 others for the chance to be in the Del commercial.
In the spots, he plays a goofball, I don't think he has to act too much, who orang's friends and family to buy Del computers.
The debut ad was when Curtis was his favorites.
In it, Steven talks into the camera and tells his dad why he should buy him a Del stressing loads of free access reason his dad's love for a bargain.
Another commercial, a commercial, Steven persuaded friends, parents to buy their kids Del's, closing with that catchphrase, dude, you're getting a Del, duh.
God, Curtis took the public at a race and stride during interview with the St.P. Times in January, seen fine with the idea of the retiring campaign.

I mean, a little bit too much, sweetheart.
You know something, I'm starting to feel that excitement from Monday already.
So it's only the end of the show on Friday and I'm already starting to feel that excitement.
Man, it is going to be so.
In fact, when those numbers come out on Monday, some of the people working are going to want to go out right out here on Ives Dairy Road and kill some people.
Wouldn't wouldn't surprise me.
