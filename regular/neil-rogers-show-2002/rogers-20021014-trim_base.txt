Wait, wait a minute. Where's the promo? Where's the ID? Where's the ID? Where's the promo? Where's the beef man? Where's the something guilty?
The hell is turning like Mojoon?
The Elijah show is next. That's what was supposed to hear there, buddy. You little swerp
Ask you what what was that?
What was the new one on me? He just got up and walked out
Maybe they didn't know that they were supposed to fire an ID off after that. I
Stick mother fucker. Put one in my socks is nice. They smell like your sister's crotch in the morning
What's what happens when you get the guy then?
I'm moving away Zach push down a goddamn fool already, friends. Oh
Fuck a yellow key so far apart
Oh
Now you shine their shoes under Lisa
All the way you watch and talk the white is cause
George it's junior say he trust you under Lisa
Who tell our allies of the greedy oil wall
But then he make you clean all the white house bathrooms
The cup of seats the toilet and then scrub the floor
They tell you don't wear sandals
God don't leave no
Your coach told him make them wall of wretch and you
You're not being like a mitches like it beveled through
If you'll be what you can be that don't get through
One day while you be flippin' in fact gay you may realize
That they're creating you just like your esterone
That's when your head will move from side to side
Drone to Lisa
It's your bush and rummage
They be cracked or as old
Yeah I was pretty awake there guilty
You know something I don't want to start the bitching about him too
Not just cause he's under concerning with mole moist mornings
I'm glad he didn't get jigsmaked out of jugs McDonald's job
You know what?
That guilty?
It was that's fault
What do you mean by that?
He's the one supposed to fire off the adi
He's talking about firing off the adi
I'm talking about the abrupt like right before that
You know?
So if he took another five seconds
Hey the fat faggot's coming up next in mad dog
You know we got a whole line of people coming on here you know?
That's just some little twerk talking about ball games
How about those ball games?
Now even George is excited about it
Not that he watched him but he feels it in the ear
You don't feel it?
What?
Oh come on Saturday and last night
That had to be two of the most electric games in the history of the sports
Even if you don't like sports
There were games
There were hiracunes and the seminal
Oh by the way you know what I forgot to mention?
Of all the important things
Florida steaks
Yeah nice gone Bobby Bogdan should have gone for two you moron
You got outcoached you idiot
But anyway right down to the end
And this time at least it wasn't wide right
Which is Florida state air beer against the hiracunes lately
Wide right with a field girl
This time it was wide left cause it had bad snap
Boy it's a good thing for the hiracunes
They didn't have a good snap
Cause that kid would have kicked that right through the middle
And then last night
Is if that wasn't enough excitement to keep it
Oh and let me say it again
Greatest name in the history of sports even better than extra hip
Ethnic sands
The hurricane star receiver
Ethnic sands he be having good hands
That ethnic sands
And it be filled ETH ENIC
Ethnic
Huh?
He's kind of like racial shorts
Is that racial or racial?
How do you be saying that?
And of course also in a game with ethnic sands was Rufus Jones
Now I just I don't want to tell dark folks what you ought to name your kids
Okay?
But Rufus is probably not a real good idea
Even Schufro at least is a little bit humorous you know
Tyrone
Tyrone
Yeah Tyrone is uh but Rufus just do not be good
Okay that'd be a good dark name
Ethnic sands
Okay have you ever heard a name like that in your life?
That's a new one
And then last night as I started to say and guess who the star now you can guess
Who the star for that offense was last night?
Olindo
Maurei
Maurei
Very good see
Jürt don't even follow sports and how about those uh see
Oh I got off of that thing and I'm in the wrong place
How about those freaking patriots yesterday?
Hey stop
Wow talk about an embarrassment
I don't want to get two sports intensive but it was a heavy duty week
So for South Florida the Panthers winning overtime and it land a five to four
On our shipments in Matthew Bill is the younger brother of Marty Burrong
He's the young defenseman on the Panthers hasn't played a million
Hey Denny, uh pot fail we can't figure out what you're talking about
Nobody has a clue what you're saying including yourself Matthew Bill Hont
But anyway so the Panthers win over time in Atlanta
The Huracun's win and just nail biting gut wrenching fourth quarter
The record crowd of the Orange Bull and last night in Denver right there in Denver
The dolphins pull it out of their ass
Denver kicks a 55 year Jason Eelam kicks a 55 year field goal with just seconds left in the game
45 seconds to put Denver ahead by a point
Miami gets the ball
There's that Jewish kid with a big ears from a Dartmouth J. Feeder
Who nobody wants to give any credit and there's that the play of this whole season
Right through that sparsus I mean the Aligned Backers hands number 51
That's a bad number to be where you know I'm saying
You know who used to wear that number?
Brian Cox
I could put the thing under but I want to leave it
I can't stop for the Patriots because that was that was embarrassing right there in the winglet okay boys
You can't complain about their running defense because they don't have any
Man my grandma could run for 15 yards of carry through that defense
But nevertheless so it was a very traumatic sports weekend
And notes you feel it in the air
That's why that that I mean talk about pulling the air out of a balloon
I guess Geldy must have sucked all the helium out of the balloon
That's why it sounds like that
Because it was done left by at nine o'clock
We get nothing man we don't even get like a hey here's the asshole nothing even a monkey the organ grinder
We got nothing is that in there?
Would you put that under organ grinder organ grinder we don't even get that now
Like I said Belly you backstabber
You're not getting jugs down you're gonna make them sure they are
Well I wish you missed that old morning cool you know
I'm not talking about the first thing I'm talking about the morning sickness food
Ron Hershey highway
Poor Carolyn that got knocked up the hall
I said knocked up the hall I just got knocked up
Now who else?
And Geldy?
Well two out of three ain't bad okay we don't miss Geldy
Not after that pathetic lead in this morning
That was weak man somebody ought to be spanking you on the hall right now Geldy
I'd like to see Duff put him over his knee right now and spank him
In fact Duff could put him over his knee and Clara could spank him
Now that we got all these hot shots around here when you love to see that?
No I'd pay big bucks to see that
Give him a little spanking you probably enjoy it
1193 votes on a pool from Friday and you people out there man you just see this is another part of my being back here
Which believe me ain't gonna last too long folks this ain't gonna last too long
This place is the end of the universe and being here being in this building
I never up until this time because the two previous times when I came back in April and in June whatever it was
I guess it was three
It was for like five days
And I knew it was only gonna be for a few days
So psychologically you can say to yourself how big the undo in three shows I'm getting back out of here
But now that I'm supposed to be here for four and a half months or at least alleged
It's like being on death row you've got to be kidding me
You have to be joking me
This place is like it's like the land of the walking dead you can feel it you can smell it
So the fact that we got all those big victories over the weekend in sports even if you don't like sports
It's gotta be something okay better than anything else going on here
And being in this building just
Wooo
Heavy heavy duty even just having to see your close personal friend the other day
What is 800 suit you know what I'm talking about?
Yeah him that's depressing that's mortifying it's debilitating
Love it 193 votes and a pool the tone of Neal's show is
Well let me do it after the break okay because I want to go into it with a great length
And we might just take calls for four hours today
I don't know that's what they want when I'm here when I'm not here see when I was in Toronto
It seemed to me correct me if I'm wrong it seemed to me like things are going along sensational
We were getting phenomenal response on our website
Everything seemed to be really rolling along you know what?
Yeah and then I came back here and it's like holy crap man
It's like uh...
In spite of what they say on the pool which we'll get to in spite of their observations
I think things were going a little bit too well and this town doesn't like that
They resent it when things are going well for it
When you sound like you're in a really good mood
And then of course Thursday the first day I come back here
And they're hammering downstairs and they're banging and they're sawing and they're drilling
And I'm trying to do a radio show up here
And then of course Greg comes in here your close personal friend
Greg comes in
And at that time I didn't realize that he was up to his old hijinks again
Hijinks
He's an honorable man yeah he's an honorable man alright
We should live so long he's an honorable man
And John Wayne Gacy was a funny guy too

The tone of Neil's show we asked on Friday
It makes no difference where he's to see
It was basically how does the show sound
Depending on where I am
Is really what it was all about as opposed to these assholes
And you're not fooling me
Maybe you're fooling yourselves or somebody else
You're not fooling me
And the proof of the pudding was those calls I took on Friday
And there was also one on Thursday wasn't there?
Same thing
Yeah
Well, you know, hockey seasons are starting again
And it'll be great to be talking about these other things
And you know, we have to put up with all your left-wing leanings and anti-bush
And basically what they would like me to do is talk about anything
And take a whole lot of phone calls from idiots as opposed to sitting here and telling the truth
Because they can't stand it
They can't handle it
So they want to deflect the agenda of the program is what they want to do
And then of course, sure when they're also the idiots, the chronics and the cranks
Who want to take the program over again who feel that they've been disenfranchised
Makes no difference where he's doing a show
542, 45 percent
The tone sucks, we want the callers back
458, 38 percent
38 percent want the callers back
You ready for that?
And where are the callers? Do you see any?
No
I don't
You know, here we had, here this is supposed to be the sports station
And these people are supposedly such gung-ho football lunatics
Three times I went out there, first when I came in, so that's four
Because I went out to take a leak twice this morning just
There's nothing like your good pee
That's what my aunt Rita says
Lunch dinner, nothing like your good pee
They're cheap
And anyway, and I looked at the phone out there, there was no tremendous number of phone calls on there
Those phones should have been let out, wouldn't you think?
Huracun's, Dolphins last night, one of the great games in history of the franchise, one of the most
SIDLATING games, you've got to be on your ass after watching that game
And even after, Elon kicked that 55-yard field rule, I'm saying to myself, hey, there's 45 seconds left in this game, baby
And ain't over yet
And not being any Dolphin fan, which I'm not going to be a phony and jump on the bandwagon
I got to give them credit, doing one hell of a job
And Olindo Maurei, and I noticed that the TV announcers there last night on what was that on?
Well, it was on channel four here
But they didn't call him Olindo Maurei, none of them
And you want to know why? Because that's not his name
I just mentioned that in passing again
Not that anybody here cares about my nusha like that
But are you certain about that?
Oh God, Ethnic Sans
It tickles my glands when I just say it, Ethnic Sans
And it sports again, how many times have I talked about that? In sports, you can have any name no matter how ridiculous it is
And the sportsers, oh yeah, there's Ethnic how you do, how you be doing Ethnic?
Huh?
Can you imagine having a kid naming him Ethnic?
No
Well, what is that? It sounds like some kind of an Ethnic reference to me
And then you got that moosey guy up there in the DC, the chief of police
Anywhere that's got a TH and it turns into a V, maybe that's because they're close to Virginia
Huh? Any like a together? We're working together to work on it
Well, what is that? Together? And this is the chief of police?
Hey, you dark folks out there, I don't want to pick on you too much
But it's about time that you started like getting the boom box off your shoulder
And getting with it, you know, maybe like attending one or two classes a year will be good in between crack deals
I mean cut it out, cut the crap
And I don't want my car wash this week
So, WQ I am
Deal
Yes sir
I don't know if you heard man that's last night when you were alive
Sir, I was watching the game on TV, I was not listening on the radio
Well, you should get it on a drop because he sounded like he blew a brain gasket when that thing went through the stuff right
I could not believe what I was listening to when it went through
I thought I seriously I thought it had exploded really
It was the biggest r-ratt and then the woo
It was real, I mean it was a little bit sad
I mean it was nice but what would a man did in the course and what do you mean it was sad?
Well, I mean he gets very excited but I don't have to say his mo-hour and it was sad
Because mo-hour was trying to scream over him and say
He really kicks the gun and the background you just hear man just trying to get his woo out
It wasn't well done, I think that the two of them don't want to walk together
If I could mo-hour was a big hard-head and like to his mo-hour
Okay, thank you
Have a great day, what do you give him me a look like that? That was a good call
He took a little cheap shot at Moa near too and also even the mad dog
He's a little crazy
You know, you're giving me a look like that
Anyway, can I do the pull here?
The show is best for Miami 118, 9.7%
Best from Toronto 63, which is obviously the correct answer
5.2% and best from Amsterdam 20, 1.6%
Like I said, I did so few shows from Amsterdam, how would you know anyway?
So, you know, excluding that the correct answer comes up last, the best from Toronto
The show was smoking from there, it was great
Yeah
The difference is like the difference between night and day
I crawled out of the sack, I got all my stuff there, I downloaded a bunch of other stories
I'm sitting there, I'm in a great mood
I don't have to put up with all these butt plugs coming into my place
Right, full of them and vigor
Yeah
Don't have to get in the car and go through a bunch of assholes on the highway
I'll tell you one thing this morning, I'm coming on 5.95, miss 5.4, which is again a new arach
All of a sudden they start jamming on their brakes, I mean slamming on their brakes
Was there any reason for it?
No, there was nothing there
Just for the halibut
And the guy in front of me, I mean you could smell the rubber, it was like you'd walked into a rubber factory
The aroma was just incredible
It was seeping if you catch my drift
That kind of an aroma
So we have 1209 votes out there and 38.1% want to call us back
When he just had one, he was pretty good
I don't, it doesn't bother me, I got a whole, look at your witness, you got a whole pile of stuff here
This could take me to 4 o'clock if I wanted to, okay
Keller in his truck on video, restaurant manager charge in sniper hoax, you know that story
Nope
Well, there you go
Steve Dunleoby, these are terrorists, he's talking about these because there's more than one in the truck in the white box truck
There's a loop
And he says they're terrorists, vile crimes, sparks are straight outrage
The greatest tragedy in the history of those islands, hundreds of almost 200 people did
Right
And Al-Kaeda done it and some of their other, some of your other good Arab friends
Some of my friends?
Some of your terrorist Arab friends
Your friends?
The bombers, the crazy bombers
The people are all in it with La Bomba
And of course it's interesting that you should be in league with them because what do we have here in Miami in the 60s and 70s?
Bomings
Yeah
If we time somebody got pissed off, La Bomba, of course now it's kind of different, you know
It's for people to philosophy, not mine
Hey, don't, don't tell me about those Jews
By the way, Puerto Ricans expand donations to GOP and Jeb Bush, there's another great story for all you a Julio's out there
Puerto Ricans, huh?
George had a good point on them anyway, so at least he's not perfect
Meet producers, we call 27.4 million pounds of deli product, 27.4 million pounds and guess where they're how far back they're dated?
Since May
June, July, August, September, it's only five months
Yeah
27.4, anyone in a Y?
Because they got Listeria
I don't want anybody to get hysteria
Over Listeria said maybe ethnic sands
And you know something, nobody will have one comment about that name
Because like I said, the sports thirds, whatever it is, that's what it is
Like what's his name? What the hell's the receiver used to play for the jets?
I can't even say I have a brain fart now
You know who I'm talking about with a ridiculous name?
They're all these other, it's a new thing in America, it's part of the racist...
Underpinnings of this society, whatever the hell that means
It is
Name your kids the most ridiculous outrageous idiot again
It's either that or it's the Islamic names now we got Rashid Hasham, Ah-Halam Schwartz, all I crap
Right, at least they got an excuse
You got the other people
Well maybe it's an ethnic thing, I don't know
Ethnic sands? I wonder if he's kind of Tommy sands, you think
Oh it's big of Tommy sands, we got some bad news
Ray Conif rhymes with Ghanif, Ray Conif is dead
He died
Somewhere, see we don't have the music, we don't have any somewhere in my love, Ray Conif
Ray Conif is a great band leader, huh?
Not even any of his Christmas time
Columbia Records man, he was there for a Koonzade
Shai
85 and he's dead
Okay I'll give you the new poll in a second, they were just relaxed
Okay, cause we're getting way behind I have to take a lot of calls today
I don't think we're gonna get a lot of calls today
And of course the excuse is not only is it Monday, it's Columbus Day
See?
Haven't you thought about that?
Oh, no
And there's a lot of Columbus Day festivities going on out there, isn't there?
No
Oh, that's right
How about a coyote? They celebrate in Columbus Day there?
How would I know?
Wasn't he? Well he was with Queen Isabella, she was a spick
He was an authorized agent of Spain
Like I just said, it's correct
What did I just say?
He's a spick
I didn't say he was a spick, I said Queen Isabella was a spick, okay
What language would you be spicking now, Mr. You just pissed off as the Puerto Ricans are supporting the Jeb Meister
Would you be?
I'd be embarrassed too, I'd be more embarrassed
I'd be more kind, I'd be so upset
I'd be not gonna do with them
You'd like hell you don't
No, I don't
You're a kid man, you're a blood brother, they're a great son of the islanders, has nothing to do with me

Bread's his cheeks to his, his toosh
Full and foul is the mercy's Negro
Stepping in fetch and at the whim of his white master
Full and foul is the mercy's Negro
Kicked us to the knees of the globalist cracker
Full and foul is the mercy's Negro
And a belt on some survey on Google
Full and foul is the mercy's Negro
A pristine, black, safe, full lips, full eyes
Full and foul is the mercy's Negro
Yo, call him, call him, call him, call him, call him, be a slave, he, he, he, grow
Yes, golden foul is the, oh that what he be doing
I'm 33, I wonder if he knows ethnic sands, you think so?
Huh? And they wonder why I call him the Heracun, so you people kidding man
The Heracun, ethnic sands, and you know what, nobody will call and tell us the origin of that name, you know that?
Hey, they might
Here's the poll today, well we're looking for all those calls man, 38% of the audience wanted the calls back
And so far we've taken how many? One?
One? One? One, and it was pretty damn impressive too
And what is that? Memo? A memo saying
Let's read the memo, let's get the important memo, maybe that's something to do with the end of the world is coming
I'll tell you during the break
What do you mean you'll tell me during the break? I'll tell you during the break
Well what is it about? It's about somebody passing
Somebody died? Yeah, so I'll tell you during the break
Somebody we know? I'll tell you during the break
Here's the poll today, Jesus, see another reason I don't want to be here
He can't even keep a straight face about it and you're sitting there like a man, is it bad news?
It's not funny, it's not funny
No, I didn't say it was funny, but I'm in the bus
I'm in the dark again like Condoleezza, I'm in the ethnic sands
Here's our poll today, President Bush's approval rating is about 63% what do you like about him most?
Well, no, seriously his approval rating is 63% that means almost two-thirds like the job he's in
What do you like about him most? Here I give you five choices, his tough stand on Iraq
His handling of the war on terrorism, his handling of the economy, he's not a flaming liberal or absolutely nothing he's a disaster
I got my vote
President Bush's approval rating is about 63% what do you like about him most?
Let's emphasize that most, let's underline it, put it in italics, put it in heavy duty print, Eric, most
His tough stand on Iraq, his handling of the war on terrorism, his handling of the economy, he's not a flaming liberal or absolutely nothing he's a disaster
Now getting back to Alindo Maurei, stem cell science offers new hope to diabetics
See here's another thing I like about him is the fact he's helping to keep us in the stone age, I like that a lot
Type 1, this is from the Reuters, type 1 diabetics patients may be able to avoid the need for daily insulin shots through transplants of insulin producing stem cells
But the procedure faces problems finding the cells and dealing with immune system rejection research you said on Friday
We've done 38, how do you say that?
Islet? ISLET, I guess that is
Yes, I know I've seen that, I've just never said it before
Have you ever said that before? Not lately
38 islet cell transplant procedures since 1999, 87% of those patients are free of insulin therapy, your after transplantation
Dr. Jonathan Lakey University of Alberta and Edmonton
See I'm reading this too fast now because I'm just too anxious to take those great calls
Research from Edmonton other islet stem cell transportation centers being presented to the diabetes conference in Anaheim
So in other words, the mega long story short, it comes down to again the research stem cell research
Been in the slow down of a crawl because of the good old right wing Christians and they're doing it by the way
The Christian coalition is firing up the faithful and proved that it has still as the clout
The coalition has opened up a three day conference in Washington aimed at raising its profile and getting out the vote in November
Republican Senator James Inhoff of Oklahoma exhorted those who gathered to vote the Liberals out of office
He called to doing the Lord's work because the Lord ain't no flame in liberal
I'll tell you that right now. He's a right wing Bible thump and conservative asshole red neck who likes guns
Oh, it's speaking of guns by the way
Supporters also proclaimed their solidarity with Israel which many Christians consider part of the biblical Holy land
They heard from Jerusalem as mayor Ehud Olmaird who said their support helps Israelis endure Palestinian bombings
Right
He never met a right wing boy. He didn't like his what he's trying to say so speaking of guns you notice
If there's some like sniper out there who's like shooting at you killing people from hundreds of yards away
Having your own peace, which is what the NRA people are always saying
You gotta have your own weapons to protect yourself
It's pretty hard to protect yourself when you're pumping gas or walking into your school room or whatever
And there's somebody that you can't even see it's not like in a godfather where you walk right up to him and put the you know
Bullet through his brains and right spill his guts all over here and I sigh believe suit. It's not like that but I think right
They're killing people with these high powered weapons which of course are readily available just like cracker jacks and cheetos man anywhere
Speaking of that did you see 60 minutes last time yes I did I saw crazy people right crazy people would be demanding the wait a minute
But haven't I always said that America basically I mean it's complicated. There are a lot of different kind of people
America basically is crazy people with guns right
But that guy from the mental health association saying oh there's no indication that these people are going to commit future crimes just because they were you starting up again
Sorry are you starting up picking on what's good NRA right wingers again taking on the crazy people yeah and they're associated
So what's the difference people who are in love with guns they got some kind of a mental problem don't they?
Maybe they're just a scared and this business about and they're starting the same old crap again
Is it a serial killer is it a uh what's the other one a terrorist no no no and forget about that
But a serial killer a uh spree killer they're starting to say more crap again like they did with Kunehaan and all the time yeah the labels make a difference
And then this bill uh what's his name bill Hummer on CNN this morning he's really out of control
He's filling in for Paul of this week and not that she's she's about if I think the biggest lightweight in the world he makes her look like a Walter Cronkite
He's such a lightweight and he's grilling this guy they got one of these shrinks on he was trying to analyze these snipers and who they are
What they're all about is if they have any idea which they don't and he's saying well yeah
But wouldn't it be a better idea if we like told them you're a coward and this and yeah
And the guy is saying no because that's just gonna bait them and taunt them into like coming out and doing more after they took another weekend off you know
And he's like he's like basically tried to tell the cops how to do their job bill Hummer
They're on CNN just read the news you asshole all of a sudden he's a guy damn expert
He's a freaking psycho-loss a criminologist and I got them expert a forensic psychologist and all of these things bill Hummer
So freaking newsreader is what he is stick to reading the guy damn telepropter okay bill and stop at living
You're making a jackass out of yourself on these certainly not news network
But like I said it sure as hell will help you lot to go to one of those gun shows that we advertise on this station lot
Pick yourself up a whole arsenal weapons to defend yourself against some sniper day you can't see that shooting you from a hundred yards away from out in the bushes somewhere or from his white box pick up truck whatever hell it is
That'll get the job done crazy people with guns that's America baby
I can look all this is 420560 way away
Well and rate me
You're riding around with your windows down
I'll us up on the show right now
We've got a vacancy in the hotel
We'll talk about men till your penis well
Out half as they run and how good they look
Pass along tips for your bookie to book
Hello sportsmen let's talk about Ricky well and we'll bring over again and Elvis good luck
I heard tired so I started sounding like
Don at talking about Henry men and loving it
And some side issues like where are all the writer trucks remember those housey on days where they were writer truck
The smell of musty-movers blanket that blended so well with eating a sandwich
A cruisin along in the afternoon
Talking about ignorant sport old girls
A juxtaposed angle their balls like a bell
Think about how good their juxtaposed spells
Ain't much talk about women except to say
He's got a nice patch of real estate
Hey man dog how you doing?
Make you king, stitty fool
What you believe?
Like a stink dog daddy from Killis
I have on the line my old friend like raw
Let's call
The dog
I'm sorry about that I meant sick free
He's a fuck spot here
What if it isn't the old friend all around whole trick
They're not fooling anybody call it
I don't need that kind of aggravation
I make plenty of money
Don't even need to give
So blow it up your ass my friend
Because I can sit here in the lex and wear my tongue
It takes a real man to do a radio show and wear a tongue
945 at 560 WDQM
I want to thank you all again for the tremendous build up and promotion of the show this morning did a hell of a job as usual
And the U38% out there that want the callers back on a show I don't know where they are
It's basically the same as when we used to take calls every day
And sit here in big form
I don't know there's not a call on the board
Do you see any?
No
What are you pounding on the thing there?
I was just remembering those days
And the numbers and writing and writing and writing and writing
And finding out that they got nothing to say
And like I said, even if it was just a ball game stuff
Now the one guy he was very entertaining about to the mad dog and ripin' mo a little bit
But other than that, these people had nothing to say
560, 560
And I'm doing this to humor those 38% of the people out there and pretend to be
And even the people I talk to Thursday and Friday
They had nothing to say they wanted to tell me how to do the show
I would hope he knocking bush like that
Let's see on a pool we got 21 votes
They like most about Bush, he's not a flaming liberal 7
Absolutely nothing is a disaster 6
His tough stand on Iraq 4
Is handling the war on terrorism 3
And is handling the economy 1
That's probably Kenny Lay
Voted that vote and there's just before
Just before they took him away
That must have been Kenny Lay
Either that was ethnic sands
WQAM
Hello, how you doing?
Pretty good
Yeah, I've been wanting to get 30 for a while
I got a good book to recommend about oil
Yeah
That's you know playing such a big roll now
The book is called The Prize
The author is Daniel Jurgen
Y-E-R-G-I-N
Right
It's a really good book
It was actually a mini series on TBS
Probably like two years ago
It's a really thick, it's really thick in the book too
But it's well worth the time
And any world too
Yes
But I really enjoy reading the articles
I guess that's about it
I just, I'm not happy to be off today
If I finally was able to get through
Oh, you're one of those 10 people
Get off for Columbus Day, right?
Yeah
Excellent, okay, thanks a lot
Okay, have a good time
See, there you go, that was pretty good
And he enjoys the articles on here
You don't mind my reading those bedtime stories on here
But a lot of people do
I mean, who do I want to hear some
Fatal Faggot reading on here for four hours every day
I don't really care while I'm here
Which won't be very long
When I go back to Toronto and do the show
Then I'll do it my show, I'll do it my way
Like Frankie would say
I'll do it my way
That's right
And be very happy with it
And we'll be doing just great
As far as oil is concerned
I'm glad he mentioned that
Because I do have one of my bedtime stories
And you're way down in a pile
We're about, we better, we do this
And we better do that
But we are doing it
How about how we better get rid of our dependency on oil
Like Europe is trying to do?
Where the hell is that article?
I can't find a god damn thing
Christian Coalition
Did I just do that story?
Get out there and vote
Oh also the Finland Mall Blast
There was some teenage punk lunatic
Crazy people with guns, crazy people with bombs
And so on
Fallwell protest leads to riot
You saw that I'm sure
No
In India, you didn't see that?
No
Alabama ban on sex toys is struck down as unconstitutional
When hellmout is my story in here about how we better do like the Europeans
And get rid of our tremendous dependency on oil
But of course we don't want to get rid of our dependency on oil
Because all of these damn people who are in control of the government
That's they're up to their armpits in oil
They're up to their nostrils in OIL
Okay? Like this guy who's just saying
WQAM
Hey, Neil
Yes sir
How you doing buddy?
Great
Don't take any callers
I get very little to say
But love articles you're reading here
Anyway, how come they got so upset with fallwell this time
And they didn't make such a big bruha howe
And he came out against stinky winky
They did
He apologized for that he went out and bought one
He's rubbing tinky winky on the head right now
You're right you didn't have too much to say
He was okay though
What he's trying to say is they made a bigger stink about this
They did about that fag thing
Okay?
But you gotta understand if it wasn't for us fags
Those right wing Christians wouldn't have any goddamn agenda
They wouldn't have anything to talk about
They'd have to find some other scapegoat like guys named Ethnic
They'd have to address ethnic issues
As opposed to sex issues
Which they're very big on sex issues
Because that plays big with the Christian right
Five people were killed Friday when Hindu Muslim writing broke out
And a protest against comments made by the Reverend Jerry Falwell on 60 minutes
Well, at last I had a little bourbon that didn't you see that on 60 minutes at the end
Where what's his name Bob Simon mentioned this?
No I didn't
And talked about the fact that the decent people have called on El Presidente
To disassociate himself and condemn those remarks
And has he done it?
No
Hasn't done it
What's hooliog given directions about it?
And hey go get that apartment in there so I have some
They're poshking around in there?
There's another guy that just done I mean when I open every time the door opens
There's some big fat person in it there you know it?
Not hooliog is a good guy but Jesus Christ is he fat
Is he fat?
Or what?
He's in the right place we could start a club here
Him and Zach and Fat Boy
Right
And me and how the Humper
And Howard
Who?
David
Howard's fat?
Is it me?
I don't think so
David Gut?
Does he really?
Sure
I wouldn't call him fat
Alright
See yeah okay I hope he's listening right now even though he would lie about it
I hope he's back from Denver which I'm sure he is nice to gotten the job by the way by Olynda Mare
But the fact of the matter is you're the one about to plad pants and a bad hair piece
I think he had a good point
And about his Verico's veins
I didn't say that either
He painted white and green jet colors
And about his wife wearing the jets cap and the crowd
The day they jets were here in town and it's often knocked the stuffing out of him
That was one that saw him yeah
I don't want to get everybody over
And I'm not jumping on a bad wagon because I don't like them but
I saw that performance last night and I'm saying to myself this could be it
This could be the year seriously
Really
I think they could do it this year
Even with that Juboi J. Fiedler in there which this town don't want to give him any credit
I think this could be their year
I'm serious
Because the league is so mediocre
Even Oakland was shown up for what a craft team they really are yesterday
They're mediocre
Patriots suck the joint out
Commercial switch the thing that switches the commercials off because that thing is still an issue
Apparently I didn't switch it back
And we got a lot of people out there who are pissed off a lot of people who rely on the show to kill four of the best hours of their life every guy at the end day
Especially if they live in Florida
Which is the greatest public service we do at the prices right at no charge and they can't hear the show right now
Which just frost my fantasy
This is what happens when I come back here
I'm surrounded by it
A sea of technical incompetence
Now where does that take place?
Broadcast.com
Well I'm going to tell you right now broadcast.com
Get with it
First we're going to go after Bell South
Then we're going to go after them
Then we're going to go after something lunch
Right after lunch
Sergio and Hylia says
Welcome back to the nation's poorest big city
Okay thanks Sergio
Got a terminal
I get your points here, but it wasn't there wasn't airworthy it was great, but it was like I said week
5670560 let's go to this one WQAM
I know. Yes sir
I wanted to say that I've been listening to you for almost 15 years since I was in high school
And calls back then although they were nothing the right home about in that past 15 years they've definitely had progressively gotten worse
Right especially all these a-holes are calling you telling you what to talk about say this don't say that
I mean if I'm listening to something like let's say it's for you and I'm not interested in the topic
You're talking about upwards to something else for a couple of minutes
Back and then whatever if you're talking about something that I like then I'll just keep it there
See they don't understand if you're I'm going to take calls
I want to hear what they have to say now what they want me to say I want to hear them say something
But the problem is as you obviously a garnered in last several years is that they increasingly have almost nothing to say
Exactly and then just to sit on hold so that amount of time just to like say nothing is like I was beyond belief
Anyways I wanted to thank you I think initially a year ago turn me on to Smallville
And that is like one of the greatest shows
And it runs again on Warner Brothers runs it again Sunday afternoon
George and I were talking about it before the show what time is it like between five and six I think
I think like on Sunday or yeah Sunday afternoon
This new second season like I think they're going to like the fourth episode
Every single episode since episode one of this season has been fantastic
Yeah and even the scenes for the scenes for this one Tuesday maybe dark the dark side of Clark
He's turned evil for another
In fact I understand he changed his name to ethnic
To ethnic?
Ethnic Kent
That's funny
I wanted to share something I know you're like a big food lover and you have probably the sugar and diabetes and all that
I went someplace to eat some brunch on Sunday and I ordered it was cinnamon raisin, holla, french toast
Drowed in a Vermont maple syrup, sugar powder, whipped cream, strawberries and blueberries
And I was about to blow up after you know
Oh stop with bananas also
Oh great
So I don't know if I can do the part that's probably kill you about if it doesn't kill you
I'll just I'll just think about it
I recommend you have the honey tune
Okay thanks
Okay
Say there's a guy who loves the show he's trying to kill me
27 after 11 at 560 WDK we got the mad dog who's going to be whipped up into a frenzy day from Monday 3

Gordon gives South Florida a major blowjob
Baby launch a couple missiles
Yes
Tour to place we know
And aim a madame
Who's first name begins with
There's one thing we all understand
Alcatta won't be finished until we blow up Pakistan
We could chase around forever
With our tanks and all our troops
But special forces are some tired of jumping through them
Who's Jesus Christ
You know we need another
Play
So let's cut out all the nonsense
And go blow up Pakistan
Yes
Alcatta needs a nuclear tank
Why don't we stop pussyfoot and blow up Pakistan
Probably because they have that nooks might be one reason I would think
But I've something to do with this
1133 at 560 WQM
So as usual we're trying to like do the best weekend on this internet problem
This concert times we got again as usual it's back it's back
The problem was on this end it wasn't broadcast calm we own apology
Okay, don't we know
But it was on this end because once the commercial break ends it's supposed to automatically kick in based on what's going on here inside this building
And of course you know what's going on inside this building no jir
That's right if it has anything to do with radio broadcasting with anything technical it's crap pure on the other
Deliberated
327 votes on a poll today president Bush is approval rated nationally is about 63% what do you like about it most absolutely nothing
He's a disaster 210 64.2%
He's not a flaming liberal 64 people so that 19.5% change it again
Sanjayd he's is handling of the war on terrorism 31 9.2% his stuff said on Iraq only 17 only 5%
How do you like that it's back stuff we're doing it baby we're on top of it get out of here and is handling an economy 5 1.4% the economy
Five clowns out there five people and you want you know what I commend those people because those are probably people lost their ass
They probably had tons of in-run or halibut and stuck crap like that
And they're saying well my least keep my sense of humor you know don't cost nothing to laugh we take a lot of calls today because yeah we're just I don't know
I'm not so sure what had anything to do with a poll I took on Friday although we're trying to prove a point no let's see 64.9% that's been pretty consistent
35.1 is the right thing and 38% when I think about they wanted to call this back makes me very very suspicious you know this oh why did I put this so far down in my pile
You talk about freaking Hutzpah man that old man would have got them dress on boy does he have a lot of cuts by I saw this I just saw the headline and it just frosted my fat all ugly ass in the Boston globe
Cardinal expects Vatican will grant us church waiver to enact hardline sex abuse policy they're gonna grant us a waiver and that nice of them yeah wave a back at him okay
like with a limp at wrist way like that look at that jersey that very naturally
Rome an American Cardinal said yesterday he expects Pope John Paul the tooth will grant the US church a waiver from church law
So we can implement its new clerical abuse policy in other words what they're trying to say is well we believe that our
Canon law supersedes your law which therefore a crap about that but we'll grant you a waiver because we're such a nice bunch of guys
Boy does he have a lot of clips by their law comes from God oh I forgot about that well our law comes from you
Good how do you like that that says that pedophiles all go to jail directly to jail do not collect the $200 do not pass going to not kiss the Pope's ring or anything else
Yeah, but what if there wasn't any passion involved that's okay Cardinal Francis George of Chicago who was in Rome over the weekend
Made the comments and interview with the A and P bolstering suggestions by senior Vatican officials that the Holy See
Yeah, hey hold up one finger and say see this the Holy See was leaning toward accepting the policy on an experimental basis
American bishops adopted the policy in June after a wave of sex abuse allegations which we already know about the bishops want Vatican approval
So the policy is the full weight of Rome behind them. Thank you. I were here the best say how to Scott but don't tell not to come in here again
A rejection would be an embarrassing blow US bishops who are struggling to restore credibility in the wake of the scandal
It seems to me that we're a lot of other embarrassing blows and they were long before this a lot of embarrassing blows you know I'm saying I'm sure you do
The provisions in the thanks are I have a great day have a happy Columbus stadium good Italian boy he could be Italian
The Jews in the Italians got a lot in common. They got their one their raviolis we got our crepline and then the chinks they stole all of it with those one times
That's right I forgot we all we both from the Chinese Marco Polo my ass okay there was a good Italian boy Marco Polo what team does he kick for huh I wonder if he's related to a Linda Maude
The provisions in the new policy include requiring diocese to remove guilty priest from church working in some instances from the priesthood itself
It also removes a statute statute limitations for abuse claims saying a guilty priest will be relieved of his ministry for even a single act of sexual abuse of a minor in the past, present or future
That reminds me nothing in Wilmington Delaware in other words if we think you're going to commit a crime sometime in the future well guess what
U.S. Church lawyers of question whether they plan conflicts with canon law and the due process rights of accused clergy and whether the diocesan labor view boards mandated in the plan have too much authority
George who said not our George but Bishop George who said he discussed the issue with Cardinals in Rome over the weekend
They expected the Pope would accept the policy and would grant the American church a waiver to get around aspects of church law that make conflict with the new rules and the Cardinals are pretty excited about tying up the giants in that series
For example he said church law provides for a full blown trial you notice how often that word blow is in this lot of blowing going on baby
Full blown trial for an accused priest before it could be defraught
George said American prelates went to the Vatican April for a landmark summer with the Pope to ask him to consider granting an exception to the law because the enormity of this scandal warranted fast
Direction that a trial would allow in other words the heat was on man the heat was on and how the heat is off nobody gives a crap about this stuff anymore the media there too busy with with a sniper the expert sniper
And then with and Iraq not a question of if but a question of when and the al-Qaeda in which we've done a wonderful job again then have a look not too good
Now there's another al-Qaeda attempted shooting in Kuwait yesterday not to mention the thing in Bali of course that grotesque the worst attack in their history over there in the largest Muslim country in the world by the way I should point that out
I just mentioned that in passing we don't want to get too serious here today we're trying to keep it light keep it light we're back on the internet everybody's happy we want to celebrate the dolphins great win last night
The Huracun's climactic win at a boy ethnic sands you'll be going baby and roof is Jones whatever the names are you know when I knew FSU was going to lose the game I can't think of the name of the quarterback for FSU pretty good looking kid by the win number 16 the quarterback for FSU for the seminals when they scored what they thought was going to be the winning field goal or touched out I forget I forget how the game went he knelt down and he crossed himself but that's right it wasn't touched on because then the Bobby win
for one instead of two that is going Bobby you red neck you Yahoo man Bobby bound see the apple doesn't fall far from the tree that's why you send that Terry bound is a while he sits in the tree most of the time and even he said daddy Ramora should have gone for two but anyway this could
went he got that and he showed the replay as they were going to commercial break the replay of the crucifixion crossing his chest crossing his breast he was checking to see if his nipples were still firm how do you like that I know mine work because he's pretty good looking kid but anyway I don't remember what is that somebody you'll let me know somebody will fax it in or call it in quarterback for FSU what do you got what's his name so like I said it was a very exciting weekend but every time you think this time is going to be just
pumped up in nothing absolutely nothing man this is the worst deadhead ass place let's have some hockey talk no don't forget George is going to be doing some hockey shows what's his name Chris Rex Chris Rex and rumor I'm hearing as he's a kind of a range of ranger ricks from flipper wasn't that his name that was a yeah Chris Rex Chris Rex was crossing himself and like that was the kiss of death baby because once you do that that's it you're done

He can see back there, it's an American bomb
It's an American bomb
We'll stop him off to the dump
Till he cast for his mom, it's an American bomb
It's an American bomb
To keep your oil warm
We did it once before
But now you need some more
But these American bombs
It's an American bomb
There he is
It's an American bomb
It's an American bomb
That's why I told I got any elevator that day
It's an American bomb
And gave me a dirty look
He said, boy, you must be in a cloud
In a fog
13th of noon at 560 WTA QA
And this has been the kind of pleasurable today
I feel okay
Especially after I get my elbow all straightened out tomorrow
Which I don't think it'll get straightened out of one day
They'll probably have to operate
You think?
Phone saw
Your whole hacksaw, when a doubt cut it out
So anyway, Muff got a kind of a chuckle out of that fact
That we just handed to him
It said something about
If you blow too much, you're in trouble
Something like that
361 votes on the poll
The votes are pouring in today
We got the audio back on your Rogers dot com
Don't panic, we appreciate your fanaticism
That's great, but just, you know, don't be blaring on us
Although I guess the fact that they barely
brought Eric's attention to it
And we got the people's attention down here
And the people's got it fixed, right?
Right
I wonder, do you think Eric Nixan's is one of the people's
361 votes
So what do you think of it?
What do you like about President Bush the most?
Absolutely nothing, he said his answer 233
64.5%
He's not a flaming liberal, 68
He's his handling of the war in terrorism 35
His stuff stand on Iraq only 19
And his handling of the economy
6
6 people in a good sense of humor said that
Here's the fact that it says, oh, and I see we're trying to get everybody into a little more upbeat mood today
And this is more like beat up than upbeat
I'm so depressed, it really looks like there's no way to save the world from religious zealotry and ignorance
And it's overwhelming
What part of the commandment thou shalt not killed of the good Christians failed to comprehend
Also Jesus preached the root of all evils is the love of money
You can just insert oil for money because there is no difference
However, a futile it may be
Voicing we concerns of the few reasonable people that must be done if nothing else
But to prove the posterity
They're not everyone was taken in by the lies promoted by both sides in this modern version of the crusades
We started in the dark ages
The calls are okay and very small doses says this fact sir
It also might enhance the droning of the idiot callers with classical music in the background
Like the old looney tunes and writing snippy

Mass decay before you emasculate yourself before I right
Whitehouse staffers gather for Bible study voluntary meetings embrace presidents emphasis on faith

President Bush opa talks openly and proudly about his active spiritual faith in another less known son of the religious devotion that permeates
Administration some white house staffers have been meeting weekly at our long prayer and Bible study said it can't hurt
When we got him in that crowd in there all I can't hurt
Bush aides organized the although it didn't have a workout for Chris ricks. You know he crossed himself and I was the end of that game

He was pretty pissed off and fired up. He had a bet on the hercones
Bush aides organized the sessions before as an orcubation one group meets during once hour on two days and then on thursdays
Tennis is volunteering although the lessons are a our Christian in nature non-Christians are welcome
Very lint executive director of americans united for separation of church and states as the courts have not ruled that religious study and public buildings is inherently unconstitutional

Okay
No, you know something
What see when Denver blew the game they were moving the ball like the dolphin defense wasn't even on the field
You notice that and they come away from the first half
They blew the last field goal because of the penalty on it was the time ran out
So and when you only come away from dominating a half with only nine points
Then the door is wide open. You know you're probably gonna lose the game and happens every time
Yeah, you get a little discouraged like that's right. Absolutely
You know, but they hung in there. They thought they had the game there at the end and I said oh my god
He's gonna get the chest to come back
Oh, and then of course when you said when you're out when you saw the ball that passed go through the linebacker's hands
Number 51 I forget his name when you saw the ball he didn't have to catch it
They're except that all he had it was knock it down and it just deflected just ever so slightly off his hand
And they get to complete down the 35-yard line. You knew that the fates were on the dolphin side
Yeah, well, you know, it's sometimes it maybe this is this is our year maybe who knows I think it is
On a different thing on that Israel is real you know if Israel knew
That Saddam Hussein has biological weapons or capability of any familiar strike you think they would have

On the final drive after Denver is Jason Mabba to be but a move that he completed a 17 year past remaining

Rarts is calling up asking me how long Jay Feele are gonna be out. So there's the info for you pali
Are you like his doctor or something? Yes
WQ I am hey, I want to talk to Neil speaking
Neil this is Chris how are you okay Chris? Hey, you should ring mo Howard's neck. He's gay
WQ I am
Well, Marv Thomas is a douchebag
WQ I am now yes, sir I want to talk about the dolphin broadcast real quick. I'm gonna take all the time you like
Uh, probably my ham is I don't know if uh mo is a good
Play by play guy or not. I have a play by play by play by play by play guys really make it judgment on that
But the problem I have is you know what I tune into the dolphins
I tune in for the color guy. I mean Jim Manage has always been the star of that show in my opinion
Because you know, I'm watching it on tv. I'm at the game listening to it on the radio on my headset
I know what's happening. I want to know why and I think this year that's been lacking the why
It we're getting all the what none of the why
We're getting all the what what we're getting all the what you know, you know, he's too verbose
He doesn't look you know gives him enough time because he wants to be the center of attraction
I don't understand that but they came up with that cocking me idea of putting norlato else a giri on a sideline
And to be in a third man in the abroad cast which would have taken even more time away from the mad dog
Mo was all a favor of that is what I'm hearing. That's what I was told on friday
I mean Jim he wants to be the centerpiece man. He wants to be the superstar. He don't want anybody stepping on his parade
Uh, I don't get into I mean whatever he might be good play by
Yes, the fact is I just want more I want more colors more mad dog more mad dog and less mo
Exactly
Mo mad dog okay, thank you. I'll pass that along. I'm sure you'll have no effect pass that along tell gildi
Okay, if you can get us out of those ass well that was terrible this morning
We just he just left us hang in there between him and the zack
Zach of course was having a big mack attack
My he was probably like sitting there in morning reconsidering that he gave you that last chocolate muffin out of the 15 that he ate
I still have it. Maybe do you want to look back huh?
Looks really chocolatey. Does he really? Yeah, I'll split it with it. I
Should spit on it right now. How big is it pretty good? What do you mean you should spit on it?
To keep you from getting it so that's why I wonder what diet I'm not gonna go to what I see
Meantain cheese that fat filled the sandwich stuff the tongue's gonna swell up. You're gonna swallow your tongue
It's already swelled up not the tongue though. I was watching that show before an MTV and that's your fault
It's swold up a little bit. I know it's not easy to tell but believe me
WQ I am
Hi Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah
Did you hear about the riots in India because of Jerry Falwell's? Yes, I already had that story on thank you very much sir
Way ahead of you guys, okay?
Hand it on over an hour ago five people died because Jerry Falwell and then the best part of the deal is they set on 60 minutes last night
When Bob Simon came into that follow up little piece at the end of the show
Yeah, Jerry Falwell's comment is he wishes that 60 minutes wouldn't have repeated his quote
Is not it instead of apologizing instead of saying hey, I wish I wouldn't have said that he wishes
They wouldn't have broadcast it or even it came out the wrong way what a disgusting obnoxious fat-faced son of a bitch
That's the best I can say for him who was a burger a facial putty
And I'm delighted that those fags moved in across the street remember I had that story about there in the Virginia where but hell it is
Sick disgusting bigoted nasty hateful sal that's what you are Jerry
I hope they catch you with a billy goat
WQ I am
WQ I am
I'm gonna Q I am twice now for the Morgan Neil her more him
Hey, look at the don't start speaking four languages on this show here. I'll leave
We're happy you're taking calls together the whole Dutch community
But the whole Dutch community, yeah, by the way, how come you people are so cheap?
Uh, well, I guess I don't know
Yeah, I guess comes from the war trying to live up to that Dutch treat crap yeah, I know
What
I didn't know that yeah, he died. Oh brother. He died. Yeah, it's a big freak of humor tomorrow. Everybody probably get drunk
I can see him all sitting out there right by the grasshopper just getting stoned off their ass
The bulldog probably end the bulldog right
And listen, it's good to mix up the show over
Okay, totesines
567 05 60 pound 5 60 got to get back to Amsterdam see this summer that was just bad
You know just between the uh flu and then the other thing that came back and then fallen down
There's a couple of stairs which I didn't want to talk about because every time I go over there fall down and people are gonna say
Yeah, he's falling out because he's stoned out his ass
Right
Well, they're gonna get you're gonna come up with something you know
Because you were chasing some hot young guy
No, I keep my balance when I do that
Yeah, I keep bra I'm very good at that's why I got my new balance shoes
And your balance for life balance for life that's right unbalanced for life
So what's that thing look like that the brownie hound? I mean that I just want to take a look at it
Okay, don't necessarily want to put it in my mouth. It looks really good. Oh, it's from the wild bean cafe
Oh the wild bean well of Zach and eat that let me ask you my as fat as Zach am I even in his league?
No, am I in his league? No, I don't even know if I've ever been his like he's got to weigh like about 350 when you think he's a tub man
Oh, that I don't want that all right, you're right. Well, maybe a little bit
Don't put your tongue on it Jesus Christ now that I know where your tongue has been. Oh, man
Airby nook and cranny every nook and granny
Every ass that's ever come down to Pike
George said hey, I like
No brother like I said have a good time with I might have crap. I'm doing unbalanced for life
So I went off a little bit today because I didn't bring anything for my sack because quite frankly true. I well
WQ I am
Yes, sir
What is it?
Do you have any idea what that was?
Craig number saying what
Obviously, who hello? Who I see WQ I am. Hi Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, I'm up to disagree with something you said earlier. Can't do that
And by the way welcome back. It'll probably a short lift for a phone line. Yes
But last night on the end during the ballgame you didn't hear thighs and they were saying
But everybody is made made made and they have to roll the damn hurls
But that's okay because if you want to be you know to pretend you're like a tag
And you want to be a little greasy especially with Columbus day coming up today
They were trying to like grease it up a little bit. That's okay
Nothing that drives me nuts is Joanne to use to do this. She's perfect unbroken. Perfect unbroken English
While doing the marlins games and like leave on her nandas with
Yeah, but see that that was his southern California roots. See that was his west coast roots with his
Chicano thing
Hey come up and say now batting
My gosh, which his name is Joanne Hill, so he's one of them too, you know
Hey, and also be back on call which you played a few times
It's matter like a couple of hours on the overnight sports shows. It was being like ridiculed nationwide. It was being ridiculed
Yeah, by the uh by the eye guys on the overnight spot
So well, you know what screw them? Yeah, the calm home or so. I'm not gonna look the greatest sports casters
Harry Carrie Bob Prince. They're all home. We're so okay. We like our homeers and our home was okay
You gotta have a little entertainment because more times the night the games that boring is hell right? That's right
Yes, this weekend was certainly an exception both in the college and the pro
Yeah, and that's why you're the first guy that seems like all uh hyped up about it. This audience man in dead is a doormel
I thought I was amazed I
You know the folks the ringing all day and I was surprised that I'd be able to get in and make up you know even get in on a line
No problem. You're right. Everybody's been bitching in Monin's thing get the call back at its time
And and now that they're gonna probably have to play Ray Lucas and they're gonna be saying oh gee
We want to feed her back. He was the best man. You know, that's a bunch of phoneies
Well, it's like having me else in closing
The question
Yeah
Don't get that little bit too much inflection there. He crushed it
He crushed it. It's no good. It's off to the left. Uh hurricane's win
He's terrible man. I don't care what anybody says
I know he's got a lot of boyfriends in his building and it's not personal
Would Joe I liked you is a good guy. I said that the other day I'll say it again
I don't know why I have to keep doing that because there's a difference
See I'm trying to point out here. There's a difference not with Mo as opposed to with Joe with Mo as business and it's personal
Because he's a major asshole
With no sense of humor with a gigantic big puffed up ego like a big boofo-toe man a big big fat ego
That's mode. That's why you don't want mad dogs saying too much under he must have cracked his panel
They must add a changes guy then the pens at the end of the game there
Not because it often pulled it out in the linda moda kick that great 53-yard feelable
Because when a mad dog went nuts
And I'll say you know we thought that Rick weaver had a big ego as he did
But at least he kind of like tried to blend in a little bit with a mad dog
See the difference I want to play that again
All right, all right all right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Of course he's dead now, but you know
Now he was okay. Reki he just he was uh prick
I got along with the fun. He was a prick but but he's he also had a gigantic ego
But the fact of the matter is number one
He was he was the greatest broadcast ever the dolphin's advocate with anybody says which he did with our pool except for those phony votes
He was he was good
He smelled very bad. He had very bad personal hygiene. There was number two and number three
He was just self self-absorbing self-centered but even on a personal level. He was a better guy than this guy
You could get along with him. He had a sense of humor got along with him fine. Yeah, I did too professional right
And even you know, I mean what a shock it was when we took our show over there to that station and he and have any problem with it

Oh no, he's a
He's a different
Ok, hello
Deborough
content
Aren't you
be doing it. Get the old-fashioned black-head, broken,
schwarze of thought. Is you there because you are
Hatton Boop, Lippley Throne? Is you the black-head,
Anger, Mammar, who'll be smart? Does they like how you
have their shoes come to leave the house away?
Washington, talk the whitetess cause. George, it's
Junior, say he trusts you, come to leave you.
Who's there to lie lies on the greedy oil wall?
But then he'll make you clean all the white house bathrooms.
The cup of scenes, the toilet, and then scrub the floor.
They tell you no where's the end of the godly floor.
Your cold-skinned hills make them all rich and few.
You'll not be like a look you'll like it be velcro.
It's your p.o.a. you to be that don't you still?
One day while you be flippant back, you may realize
That they're treating you just like you're as the roll.
That's when your head will move from side to side,
Drowned to leave the house.
Until Bush and Rameer, they be cracked as old.
Well, 34 or 560 W.Q.M. the mad dog will be here at one,
and then you can call him and tell him that you want Moe.
What is it? Moe, a mad and less Moe.
You know what they want? So PR Ralph faxes me this.
How come we didn't have any woman call to give me the information?
The only woman we had all day was that one that hung up on again just like
a year ago, it's going to be a song to dance about how Bush was rubbing his hands
together with Glee after 9-11.
That bitch, which goes to show you, but like I've always told it is,
there's a handful of callers.
Look it out out of two and a half hours today that I've been taking calls
or whatever it's been three and a half.
Look at how many of these people.
I'm not saying they're all bad either,
but look at how many of them we know who they are.
Thought of what I'm saying.
Oh yeah.
Know them well.
Oh man, including ones that run for like about a half a second.
Guiding light.
Alan sneaks out of the hospital to access the spawning file.
Saw that.
Alex and I changed my mind.
I'm John Collins is doing a good job on it.
Sure.
I hate to tell you that.
I know what you hate her like poison that I generally do too.
But she's an obnoxious bitch and that's what she's playing.
She's doing a good job.
She's really hard on the eyes.
Yeah.
And.
Alexandra finds Alan at home.
Philip is done.
Wayne learns Olivia Plants, the mayor, Alan in the hospital.
Cassie dreams about Richard who tells her to thank Riva.
Cassie Patux when she receives another black rose.
Cassie learns that Olivia spent the money she planned
on for using a paying off the mob.
Mara Moves in with Bill Ben and Remy.
Remy.
Gus terms Alexandra.
Tony yells at Eden for missing work.
But doesn't fire.
Harley tells Gus that Eden's part of black,
the black mailing ring.
Gus is furious when he learns Harley,
pretended to be Eden.
It's learned about her past.
There you go.
That's it.
When she was in the flop house there in Chicago.
So that's the update.
I guess we don't have any women out there listening or at least not
they're going to call me certainly and give me any information.
Except that one I want to repeat the same thing I hung up on our
a year ago about and I hung up on her again.
Nice going to.
Excellent.
Silly bitch.
WQ I am.
WQ I am.
WQ I am.
WQ I am.
Hey, look at Neil, please.
Speaking.
Hey Neil, how are you?
Okay.
I'm glad you're taking calls again although I don't have no complaints about
your other format.
Yeah, well, this will last too long.
I got a couple thoughts about foul
wetland, the bombing, the visa and
healthwear.
What a, and I'm not a bush reporter, but what a perfect opportunity this is for
Bush to come out and not only distance himself from the
far right wing of his car.
He could have happened, man.
Not going to happen.
You're dreaming.
Not only could he distance himself from foul well in all of this rhetoric,
but he could also use the opportunity to, on the other hand,
that's great.
You know, why freedom is so great in America?
And I'm saying the old police, I can't stand what you're saying, but I'll defend you.
Sure, he's not going to come out and alienate the constituency that put him there in the first place.
He's not going to do that.
That's where he's at now.
He's, uh, he's locked in.
Stamined by foul well, it's so, so,
whopper.
Uh, uh, I've removed from anything that we've got.
Well, let me ask you something, sir.
It was, it was aired on 60 minutes a week ago last night.
So that's eight days ago now.
Have you heard the president say anything to repudiate or rejected?
Not a peep.
Right. And you won't.
And you won't.
The other thought I had is, it's, it's too bad.
It's the perfect opportunity to distraint what freedom in America is all about.
Yeah, okay.
Thank you.
You said that about four times.
This guy don't want to get it.
He doesn't want to understand it.
Sure, you don't want to get it.
Freedom used to be about an American.
You're living in the past, sir.
It's all I can tell you.
You're living in the past.
They want to Christianize America.
That's what this whole business about, about religious-based, uh,
charities and all.
All of a sudden, bullcrap.
More tax breaks for the religious right.
More, uh, opportunity for them to interfere in, uh, in government.
That's, that's what it's all about.
And that's why these people are having all the rallies and trying to get,
that's only three weeks from tomorrow.
It's going to be the election, boys and girls.
And these people are out there, uh, troops all whipped up into a frenzy again.
Because they got the keys to the kingdom now.
They're going to run with it on the road to Armageddon.
See, that's another reason it's so pleasant to be in Canada.
The radioactive cloud will fall on you just to save.
No.
No.
We got a block that the sea and tower.
It's going to fall into Lake Ontario.
Watch out in Rochester.
You're going to be in big trouble.
Here's the fact that says I'm scared, Schmittless.
Over these cars, that asteroid can't hit soon enough for me.
Todd Nahaliwood says,
P.S. the car is eat beagle-ass.
And then he quotes,
I'm getting all the what and under the why,
Mo Mad Lessmo.
There you go.
That's what we want.
Lessmo.
In fact, I don't know why you people are such a bunch of
pussies.
You're calling me and repinting them and ask,
which is okay with me.
But call them up tomorrow morning and say,
Hey, listen, how come you don't want to let the mad dogs say nothing?
You jackass.
Right.
Why don't you go along there like, uh, like Mr. Weaver did, okay?
And be like a team on there.
All right.
All right.
All right.
That's the way you do it.
Now, now, did you tell that story on the air about why he lost a job at Westwood
One allegedly?
Of course not.
I just found out Friday afternoon.
Well, what's the story in a nutshell?
Is that he was at the Masters at Atlanta golf tournament?
Right.
Covering it for a Westwood one.
This is alleged by the way.
This is the story we're hearing in the building.
And one of the Westwood One big waves wanted him to do a little bit of a crossover
with someone else.
Right.
And he told them no, it wasn't part of this contract.
And the guy asked him again,
really nice.
He said, look, I understand it's not part of your contract,
but it would really be nice and helpful.
Get a little bit of a cross promotion.
Something like that.
This is the story I got.
And he said, no, F dad, it's not part of my F in contract.
No, I'm not going to F and do that.
No, because he's a big shot, man.
And walked off.
And that was that was the beginning of the end.
The ball started rolling right there.
Well, how do you like that?
I sure comes as a great surprise to me.
Not.
But that's just what I heard.
And he goes as side of the inverse.
Again, that's just alleged.
We emphasize that emphatically.
But nevertheless, that's what the rumors around town.

You want a sport jockly?
Wrap around your neck.
You like men and anger?

Close to your nose.
You want a sport jockly?
Wrap around your neck.
Spoon holes while the beat.
Fins over chin.
If they could get 20 shots.
Beep, beep, beep, beep.
Those Chicago bands.

You will, you will.
Our dozen are so bad watching sport bag listeners.

Gerbach.
The noodle fair noodle hole.
560 WQAF.
Proud to be your official Elvis.
Elvis Gerbach's born to all headgoaters.
Yeah, we were.
Dude, that last time I played that.
But I know he's not saying what it sounds like he's saying.
You know what it sounds like he's saying?
What?
It's 1245 at 560 WQM.
Our friend Rich Pactor, another one out of control.
Boy, these people are something, you know.
Look at that.
We've got to put into a frenzy with another facts.
Joe Angel is Colombian.
That's why he rolls his aras says Rich Pactor.
Roll up the rim.
Yeah, they got a spot in Canada.
They're a roll up the rim to win.
But that's Scottish.
Scottish, where they have those keltz.
In fact, I've seen some of those guys with the keltz and the big socks.
It was Prince Watt's name, Charles.
Keltz and heist writings that come up to like their crotch
up to their black nuts.
560.560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon line.
452 votes on that pool.
President Bush's approval rating is about 63%.
What do you like about him the most?
Absolutely nothing is a disaster.
200 and it's changing again.
Come on.
285.
62.9%.
63% which leaves 37%.
You following?
You see this?
Put this in connection with that poll we had on Friday.
There was a couple of real suspect calls.
As transparent as a paint of glass.
Oh yeah, well, you know, there's all this other stuff.
You know, it gets really ponderous.
All those articles about Bush and fashion Bush.
Now that hockey season started and we had one call about hockey.
The undefeated quality losing overtime.
But the path is with three points in two games.
No.
First off, because there ain't no interest.
There's no knowledge.
There's no interest.
There's no nothing.
But please, please talk about anything.
Don't you go on here and tell the truth.
Don't you go on here and like this old, the Bushmeisters.
Because that's on American.
And all the gun squeezes too.
We never even got to any of those stories today.
The snipers.
Crazy people with guns, man.
And the public, oh yeah, well, you know,
not going to take away our guns.
W-Q-I-M.
You can't see it.
W-Q-I-M.
W-Q-I-M.
Hello, Neil.
Yes.
Always good to hear you, Neil.
Here I am.
Two things.
I wanted to talk to you.
Did you see those commercials voting on smoking,
whether to ban smoking in public.
Restaurants and stuff like that.
I don't know if that's going to happen here in Florida.
Ah.
In Western, you can't even smoke in your house.
You can't smoke in a boys room.
Because I keep on seeing commercials saying vote yes on this number
or for something like that, whether to ban smoking in restaurants.
I was just wondering if that pertains to South Florida
or somewhere else, another state or not.
They're going to do all these anti-smoking,
these militants.
They're going to do it everywhere.
Pretty soon, smoking a cigarette will be like smoking a joint in public.
You want to go to jail for five to ten?
I mean, I have nothing against smokers.
I mean, I used to smoke myself,
but I mean, when you're in a restaurant
and you're enjoying a good meal,
the last thing you want to do is smoke smoke
when you're enjoying a good state.
Unless it's a good cigar.
I mean, cigars are cool,
but I mean, the people that smoke a smoke a Murray,
you know, they're that way.
They have that little attitude.
They're that way?
Yeah, there's nothing more of that.
People who smoke cigars are gay.
No, no.
They're just that, you know, that machismo,
you know, you're like me, like me.
I'm pretty much.
No, you're an exception.
We love you.
Yeah.
And another thing that's pretty good book about,
it's called Cuba Confidential.
It's a pretty good,
objective unbiased look at the hardline ex-oz,
you know, cast.
Oh, God, I don't want to hear about them.
No, no, but actually,
there's one of the reasons I despise being back here
is those freaking exos.
I saw Rosanna Dana on earlier than I wanted to puke.
Actually, I mean, which I'm a pretty young guy
and I didn't realize that there were actually a lot of hardline ex-oz
that were actually put in jail for bombing places.
So I mean,
I'm no kidding.
I mean, well, I totally did not know that.
And I, you know, I really don't want to know
that Cubans have something in common
with these crazy Palestinians, you know.
And actually, we do.
No, no, but you see,
now, but these people weren't suicide bombers.
These were people of just, they were, they were, they were, they were artists.
We were smarter, I guess, to the public.
There you go.
You know, like that wacko, what was his name, Bosch?
Well, let's go back.
That's because the Cubans couldn't find seven virgins.
Have a great day, pal.
You too.
See ya.
5-6, and now, how come this thing is acted up again?
I don't know.
I left here in August that thing was working magnificent,
just like clockwork.
So I don't know what you did with it.
Yeah, I went through it to the floor.
I don't, I don't know what Carlos did with it while I was doing that.
Got the window.
Must have pockied around with it, man.
Carlos that, uh, said,
I was just, they'll know a little by little more.
She's, uh, truly like big chunks of paper
are coming on instead of one sheet, then it's two and it's five.
And it's like the, then the whole rim of paper comes through
there every time a fax prints out.
Headed, rim.
When it doubt, rim it out.
Now, here's one, pal.
Oh, it's big, dex halfway in.
It's side of Louise, tell you why.
Yes, well, you know Louise, all those guys, what are your people?
They're looking for big dex.
Highway in.
W-Q-A-M.
Uncle Neil.
Yes, sir.
The Joseph Gackie, J.P.O.
Piedler, who'd you rather sleep with?
W-Q-A-M.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, ma'am.
I just wanted to talk about some that's really frost in my fat ass.
Yes.
You mentioned the sniper.
Why do media types have to give these people moniker's?
Have you heard on like a fax?
They have to be calling them the, let's see.
No, I'm 6'10 this morning.
I heard the tarot card sniper, the dealt way killer.
It's the same thing with the guy, that kid that was bombing mailboxes and stuff.
They had to call him the smiley face bomber.
Right.
Because he was trying to make the pattern on the map.
It drives me crazy.
We'll see if it's like a self-fulfilling thing because they want to have more and more of these
copycat can also, so they have more to put on the ear.
Good for weather ratings.
Do you like to take the hell out of me?
That's all I want.
Okay.
You guys can have your back.
Thanks.
Watch out for the, what was the guy in California, the stranger, what the hell they call him?
Oh, that Julio.
Whatever.
Well, I'll come with, whatever the hell's name was.
They called him the, the crazy spick.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T in Verizon, where I was lying.
We got the mad dog coming along at one o'clock who's pretty fired up and pissed off.
Not only because Dave Fido has got a broken thing,
but also because of the fact he got stepped on there at the end of the game.
He's acting a little gay.
He asked me.
Him and Mo are having like a little countertops.
Aren't they?
No.
Thought you think that would be great?
What getting into my brawl right in the middle of a dolphin broadcast?
Like trying to grab the microwave from each other.
There's my turn.
Oh god damn it.
I'd listen to that.
Yeah, even George would tune in for that.
Hey, don't forget to join the overnight guys.

Starry Stage Screen and Theradise.

Nico, Nico, Fer.
You got so pan.
Nice.
Thank you.
Hey, you know,

Hey, nobody's gonna stop it.
Scott!

My child, Todd, you got 10 minutes.
Well, it was to be safe beneath.
Yo, both of you.
Yo, man.
You know, I knew linda blam over that.
Hey, so pretty.
I'm mad.
Okay.
Put on powder, so you'd be like that.
You know who I am?
No, come here.
Then don't pick it up now.
I'll be a blood man.
All right.
But I expect a print in the apology I might touch my...
That blue man, a book, Todd.
That yellow, blue man.
I'll pick the fraud.
This is...
This is...
Lord, and I'll see you now.
Thanks.
Well, Mr. David, hello, Warren.
Jack, Jack Gordon.
How can I help you?
You see, Warren?
Yeah.
I keep getting raped.
Is that a shame?
I'll look into it right away.
Thanks, Warren.
It's about time.
Some put it out.
Drop your pet.
I said, drop your pet.
This was odd.
Oh, favors no come, Chief.
No, no, no.
Let's rape, oh.
Radio big shot.
I guess now we pass the time away
in the Gale of Oz.
Drop 57 at 560 WQM, Addox, 10.
By Hank, I'll be doing a shot at Chulose this afternoon.
With that more 5 to 6, I don't see Patrick Sirtan
on the agenda for this week.
Like I said, he...
Once you change your name like that,
like Tony Dorset becomes Tony Dorset.
Once you change the way you'll be pronounced in your name,
then you get to be too big to be coming in for these
hour here and hour there, you know,
to kind of rate the print in this place.
Forget about that.
Then we got Hurricane Highline
tonight with a assimilating...
Terrific guy.
...who I'm sure will be like whipped up into a frenzy
about that nail-biting Hurricane victory
over the seminal on the Saturday.
Pretty exciting stuff, although this crowd
dead as a door nail is usual.
WQAM.
Hey, George.
Yeah.
George, listen, a bunch of those are going to start
pronouncing Howard's last name, David,
until he can get more raised name right.
Howard Dovid.
Howard...
No, Howard Dovid.
No, Dovid.
David?
Yeah, Dovid, like Mogen Dovid.
See, obviously a boy, huh?
You don't get it. Mogen Dovid.
You get that, don't you?
Sure.
WQAM.
WQAM.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Hi, can I speak to Neil?
Speaking.
Hi, Neil. How you doing?
Great.
Neil, I heard last week you were having problems
with your DSL and Bell South and whatnot.
Yeah.
And somebody had sent you some information on M-Power.
I tell you what, be careful when you change
because these companies, they all go through Bell South.
Right.
We use M-Power and any time we have a problem,
they send the Bell South guy out.
And usually the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing.
Right.
It's been a while.
We already got that here at QAM,
so we don't need somebody else who don't know what they're doing.
Well, that's great, Neil.
I just wanted to warn you.
Thanks for the good news.
Hey, thanks, buddy.
So whatever you do, don't call that M-Power guy.
He meant well, I guess we think,
although you never can be too sure.
I called him.
Yeah, George, he called him.
He called him and he didn't have a lot of money.
And it's just a bunch of Bell South,
step children.
And then of course, Spiro Canton,
Eric Bell South.
He called and left the message and George
tried to get back to him.
He kind of like danced around it and didn't bother.
Okay, once we passed the blame off on him,
who was it?
Oh, Netscape.
That's right.
There.
I'll tell you, everybody's having the internet problems.
There's something going on.
You know, I don't want to get anybody panicky
or nervous, something like that.
But there's something going on.
And believe me when I tell you,
