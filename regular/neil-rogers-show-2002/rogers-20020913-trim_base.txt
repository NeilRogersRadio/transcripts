Appleton was constant one night before the off-game and I was standing between you and Joe Robbie at the bar and
You guys were talking through me since you weren't speaking to each other
And it was you know tell him this and tell him that and
And I was like the messenger between you two guys, but
They're genuinely was not a lot right?
Yeah, you first the echoes gone thank the miss for that. Okay. It's not a four. We're a little bit late
But then again, hey mode take all the time you want baby. No problem. Lashana tovon get out of here
And by the way there's something under your wake
So terrorist threat shuts down a 20-mile stretch of I-75
Which you heard a little while ago. This sister has been going on all morning long a possible terrorist threat in South Florida
Pears have been thwarted says NBC six, but I mean you know, we we really don't know that much
Three men and two vehicles have been detained and they're still being held this morning near Naples
Police say the stops are based on possible terrorist threat information from Georgia
Live TV shots show that explosive charges being used to blast open would appear to be a backpack taken from one of the vehicles
They said there were no explosives in the backpack about one o'clock this morning the Florida Department of Law enforcement
Issue what it calls a Bolo or a B on the look-out message
Kalaunforcement agencies across the entire state of Florida a message coming from the Georgia Bureau of investigation as law enforcement to be on the lookout for
Three possible terrorist suspects making threats about potential terrorism activities in the Miami area
Authorities say they had what they believed to be credible information regarding three men possibly of Middle Eastern descent
Who were headed to South Florida and made threats about potential terrorism activities in the Miami area
Law enforcement officials set a waitress over her these men hanging a conversation at a
Shownies restaurant account who in Georgia yesterday Miguel says he ate it shown these once and the drops and bombs of his own
The men reportedly were overheard saying they meaning Americans mourned on on 11 and they're gonna mourn again on 913 meaning today
Local police were asked for to look for a new black condom with Illinois licensed plates
NBC five in Chicago reports that authorities have traced one of the cars been addressed in suburban Bartlett, Illinois
And so they go they got a 20-mile stretch and they also have a no fly zone over the alligator rally at the moment and
It's and they're still in turkey and they really don't know that much another reason that it's very time consuming that
They were particularly searching this they as they go through each piece of the vehicle as you could imagine
You just think of your own you could hide it as close as anywhere in a car
So it's not just the common areas of a vehicle that need to be searched in prior vehicles there are two of them
I don't know if anything
Has been found it raises more concerns
But you need to do this slow and methodical because if a mistake is made and someone has injured
You know there's no coming back from that and that's why it's so it's scary
We kind of ignore the we haven't been able to confirm whether these two vehicles and the men and the two vehicles are related can you?
The the only information I have to that is these are both of the two vehicles that were put on bulletins to be on the lookout for
Associated with the information out of Georgia and then the other point that has been raised here is when you look at the map
Which we're gonna do now is the geography of the state someone pointed out that the turkey point nuclear power plants
Maybe a
More than a couple dozen miles of Ray what is the level of concern there about the vulnerability of power plants in your state?
I'm not saying the two of these are connected at all
But no person of the geography you can't ignore the fact that that power plant exists
He's speechless
Nutanity is still with us
Now he probably just dropped the phone nice go on fall on I think she chased him away with him
Itty out of question like that and because they don't know a damn thing in a way
She's talking nuclear power plants, but of course that's the news media for you because they're lim lim lim lim lim
They're crazy so before anybody gets all panicky and the vent out of shape and psychotic
They don't know that man and they got everything laid out there on the road on the alley and they're looking and investigating and of course
We don't know if there were bombs or who knows if they were really terrorists at all and of course it might have been other things than bombs could have been
Chemical agents or what but again what's the point?
Especially like they get everybody whipped up to a frenzy like Paula's trying to do there with her nuclear
Power plant with turkey point speaking of turkey Paula. Okay, let's get back and just calm down or relax when we find anything
We'll you know keep monitoring the situation as they say we're monitoring the situation
Happy Friday the 13th to you
We asked yesterday. What do you call soft drinks on our pool? We had 780 people who said soda 452
And but no contest that soda versus pop thing not in South Florida
So to 452 coke 162. I'd never drink that Schmidt 90 pop 63 and tonic
13 said tonic which I find most amusing you want to should I do our poll questions?
They right now or should we do the fight? Let's see Janet Reno by the way. She's not going down without a fight, baby
We got that story coming up. Don't look right says last night that he's the Democratic nominee for governor
Janet says not so fast there cowboy not so fast
So we still can't get it done every newscast last night every show every newscast making fun of us in Florida
And of course we're used to what so we say all right, we can use the publicity, you know
I guess that's our new motto now know what publicity is bad publicity. We'll take it
Got a shocking editorial sensational and shocking editorial from the national post this morning here in Toronto couldn't believe it
I've looked at the headline. I thought it had to be like sarcastic or a joke and I read the whole which I'll get to it
Why stop it pot legalize all drugs? Oh what it says
It takes some real shots at the so-called US war on drugs in here great editorial and I don't think we'd be reading that in the
Hero to the Sun sent me I don't think so
So Janet's ready for a fight. I got a book and under the London Times says US attempts to Russia with profits of
Costings and arm and
Basically what it says is that we made them an offer they couldn't refuse Putin so that the Russians would go along with us
And they bush-mice it was under this morning mumbling a little bit they had that on CNN saying he doesn't really expect that
Sodom is gonna like go along with it
So whatever whatever sanctions the the whatever rep proposal
Resolution the UN drafts of course does anybody ever go along with resolutions of the UN?
No not really but nevertheless so of course the the game plan has already been drawn up
I've got a book that I bought yesterday which will just make the hair stand on your head
It's called forbidden truth US Taliban secret oil diplomacy in the failed hunt for bin Laden by John Charles Bursard and Guillaume this gay that's gay two frogs
And this is it says international bestseller banned by the bin Laden family by the way
And I'm gonna read that today a little bit later on just the introduction and prologue which is quite lengthy
But at any rate it's it's unbelievable
So those of you people who want to continue living and sit like ostriches with your head buried in the sand and believe everything the government tells you
Hey, it's a great country or least it still is at this moment and we might even have another election
We got to relate to our kind of like true me off a little bit you know what I mean?
Okay, I'm fine and of course is George okay? That's the question you notice Miguel is there again today
I and the reason Miguel is there is because George is sick as a dog
But being the trooper that he is and being as horny as he is even when he sick as a dog he was there at Treasure Island last night wrapped in a schmata
It looked like grandma he looked like grandma Moses on a bad day with a schmata around him
I might why did he bother showing up? I don't get it money I
See
Excellent nice calling George. Oh, he's going to the doctor today to get checked out and see if he's still alive or whatever
But he'll be okay. He'll be back on Monday
In fact, there's we approach payday course he gets paid the automatic deposit anyway
So we don't have to worry about picking up checks things like that. It's 11 past nine at 560 QM
Genie, Missouri what they're all she's saying here anything important on CNN concern
Everything is being investigated and investigated thoroughly as this incident is they may turn up some bad people along the way
But it does not necessarily mean that any of these incidents is going to have anything to do with terrorism
Now did she say bad people? I think she meant evil doors you see I think she meant evil doors
But it's look at the tongue some bad people in other words these folks who do these things is what gene meant to say on CNN
Where they seem to become just a little bit unglued this morning?
12 minutes after nine at 560 WQ a.m

Yeah, you said you the worst competition you had was with Garrow but there
But there were guys who could be if not belligerent at least would turn their backs on you. Well, I
The toughest guy to talk to after the often game if they lost as many Fernandez because
Many took losing so hard and I always admired him for this
Although I really never thought many would turn out to be the great solid citizen that he's become
You didn't dare go up to many because he might go for a circus
He took losing so hard
A lot of others Nick Nick want a Connie boy
You didn't want to be around him after they lost they were other guys who stayed on an even keel like sure of most of the time Bob Greasy
You couldn't even tell from talking Bob Greasy whether they want to lost
Edwin one more thing and that is
Among other things that you've done all these years you've been the the South Florida voter in the Hall of Fame
Election every year
That's not an easy job. I think people kind of look at that and
Maybe they don't really understand all that goes into it. They're always people who are
Quick I was listening to a national talk show this weekend where they were ripping the voters for not putting Bob Hayes in
There's always
Some constituency out there that's unhappy that is very true. Yeah, it's I think it's a it's an arduous process
Isn't it it is
Arduous and has been arduous
Arduous for the nearly 30 years. I've been on there and
Worst than that is getting more and more arduous every year because every year the NFL keeps burping out more and more
Players who are eligible who finish their careers five years ago and it's like
Every year you have the same five pound sack
But now this year you're trying to put 12 pounds into the five pound sack next year
You got about 15 pounds in there and it gets just gets tougher and tougher and people don't
Don't realize how tough it is to make the Hall of Fame every coach thinks all of his players should be in there
I can tell you this that a lot of the voters selectors sort of resent the fact that
There's so many dolphins in there
Some of them don't think some of them
resent Bob Greasy being in there. I obviously do not resent since I presented him and
Certainly endorsed him some of the mercenate Jim Langer being in there
It's very odd though of the dog all the dolphins in there
They have six offensive players only one defensive player Nick Bonacani in the coach Don Shua and on the Super Bowl teams
The defense was better than the offense
There should be no doubt anybody's mind
this man
And
You're thumbing his nose at the world
American need to know how to make it up my mind and how that's a different country because our friends and allies
Hey George what's your talent war that were about to go to war?
Yes, you
George you see yours little son boy that was dumb
Hey George now you're looking for that guy who threatened us before
Yes, what you made one big
Boo Boo see believe me that was just well that you had to tell the plan to attack and he'll get wax
That'll just guarantee the leader will be absentee
Tell me why you have to go and tell a racker gonna be invaded
If he says don't know
knows you're coming form so we'll find a way to escape it
He's the guy that
That's it. Hey now we're making his way underground so I doubt that we're ever gonna find him
Honestly, I can't believe you told a rack to be invaded
No, no, no, no
No, no, I'm 18 at five sixty WQM happy Friday to the sun and shining its beautiful here. Is it still crappy weather there till?
Yep, is it really I
Got here was still dark I see because it's at least not raining on the alley and the
eight-zivian
Porkers out there on the alley and they got what is that thing?
Did you see that kind of like silver looking thing look like some kind of a tent? Did you see that?
They've got every kind of device and gizmo out there on a highway and they're checking all of the contents of both the cars that they pulled over and
The three individuals that they said that they weren't arrested, but they're being detained
Hopefully they're like pulling out their fingernails to get the real answers out of not that we want to go too far, but
Here's our poll question today Eric
I'm gonna give the poll question early so Eric can go off and enjoy a lovely brunch at a great weekend
Who do you think is the most dangerous person in the world today? That's our poll question
Who do you think is the most dangerous person in the world today? I've got six choices for you
Sodom Hussein
Osama bin Laden
Yasser Arafat
Ariel Sharon
George W. Bush or the Pope I don't you think that's a good bunch of choices there?
How is the Pope dangerous dangerous dangerous?
You're starting to shine like a W and how how is the Pope dangerous?
It's only a four-hour show and we got a late start because Moe had a lot of a heavy football stuff under this morning
Plus we had to find out that Don Bailey Jr
He's got a urinal in his house
It would be it would be one thing if it was in the bathroom, but it's like in a living room
But that DBJ he's got a great sense of humor
How is the Pope dangerous come on you don't ask that question, please?
So who do you think is the most dangerous person in the world today?
Sodom Hussein Osama bin Laden Yasser Arafat George W. Bush
Ariel Sharon and the Pope and see when Miguel asked that I forgot that he was a brainwashed Catholic
Okay, Reno says he's ready for a fight
Even as evidence mounted that perhaps thousands of votes in dead County had not been counted
It just gets crazier and crazier man. There's no end to it like all the other elections now
We're gonna have in South Florida if they just never and they go on forever
Until we then everybody gets worn out from accounting fatigue
And spread that film required declared victory last night is the Democratic nominee for governor
But Janet Reno who appeared to lose by just 8100 votes girded for a fight to preserve her candidacy
And she said the rights of voters who have their voices heard
The standoff created a harsh new reality for Democratic Party leaders just two months ago before they hope to once each governor
George a Jeb Bush pitting the party's hierarchies favored son against a populist icon revered by
Chor Democratic voters who feel disenfranchised and those people are too stupid to understand that she can't win the general election
We won as you all know McBride told supporters in Tampa just before Reno told the TV audience that she would not concede
McBride said we won 59 out of 67 counties. That's amazing the only problem for him those he got walloped in deadbroward in Palm Beach in the North County
I mean walloped
And perhaps the most critical county of all choosing the nominee and date the elections officials realized to their horror yesterday
That on told hundreds or thousands of votes may not have been counted
Doesn't that surprise you?
A review of just four of 81 disputed precincts turned up
1818 on counted votes prompting Reno advisors to put the brakes on any kind of concession not so fast cowboy
If the county decides to examine all 7200 voting machines a distinct possibility official said
Reno could pick up and our votes to narrow the gaps. She won about 70% of votes cast indeed on Tuesday in remarks delivered
Just moments after McBride's victory speech Reno congratulated her rival on a great campaign
But put her position in stark terms. I think it's very important to get the votes counted and the people's voices heard through their votes
She said she blamed the voting problems on the governor who spent most of the day yesterday deflecting the blame back on
Under the Democrats who oversee elections in the counties with the biggest problems
Dade and Broward and of course a ping-a-pong in date and supervisor elections Miriam Olofant and Broward who needs to be fired right away by the way
Boy said it's not his problem, but he's chief executive of the state
There are no laws more important in the state than election laws. She said she said Reno
I'm going to do everything I can as governor as a private citizen to see that the electoral system works in the state
So people will have confidence in it said Janet in stark contrast to Reno's focus on voters rights
McBride barely alluded to the election chaos voter regularities and his opponents refusal to concede what we need to do now
He said his unite get together with the real business at hand
So this is not what the Democrats wanted at all. They wanted a united front
They don't want divisiveness and so on but it no matter what happens it seems that there's this democratic death wish
In the state of Florida especially in South Florida. So he's gonna fight it out and of course the votes have to be certified and
On this coming Tuesday
So if they redo the date votes and it comes to find out that I can't conceive of how she can make up that many votes
The only thing is if she makes up about 1500 votes to get the margin under 16700
Then it's an automatic statewide recount and then of course it's up for grabs then God only knows
Oh God what kind of chaos we're gonna have
Here's this editorial of today's Canadian national post it just amazing that there are people who can actually tell it like it is
It's Andy Laney writes why stop it pot legalize all drugs. Oh, this isn't an editorial. It's a column
but nevertheless
Three tiers for unelected senators last week
They released a report stating that Canada's marijuana laws waste enormous resources destroy the lives of drug users in
Fringe on civil liberties foster organized crime and do absolutely nothing to stop people from getting high
Inevitably critics were quick to offer the usual objections in response to the senators call for legalization as a parent
Canadian line-fleaders Stephen Harbour observed I simply don't share the view that alcohol is more harmful in marijuana
For their part the Globe and Mayo and National Post published cringing wishy-washy editorial's calling for decriminalization
Rather than outright legalizations. He does not mentor. It's a column by Andy Laney
The sole problem with the Committees recommendations is that they apply only to cannabis when it comes to drugs the only
Humane policies to legalize them all
Ex-tasy cocaine heroin PCB Prohibition is failed in equal measure for all of their substances
Prohibition as a normal social cost does more harm than good. It's time to junk the entire approach
Prohibition is a legalization would trigger massive increases in drug consumption and addiction
This reflect an extremely simplistic understanding of the relationship between legalization and usage as the Senate committee notes and
We've got the cannabis use among the young we have not legalized cannabis and we have one of the highest rates in the world
Countries adopting more liberal policy after the most part rates of usage lower than ours which stabilize after a short period of growth
Similarly heroin uses almost three times higher in the ultra-prohibitionist United States than it is in freewheeling
Holland the idea that legalization means epidemic consumption is mostly hysteria of those who do try drugs
Many perhaps most experiment in their youth and then stop of those who do keep using the majority do so without becoming addicted to years ago
Ottawa citizen journalist Dan Gardner obtained a 1995 World Health Organization study on cocaine the most extensive ever conducted
quoted one of its key findings occasional cocaine use not intensive or compulsive consumption is the most typical pattern of cocaine use
Such finding so discredited America's drug policy that it threatened to withhold WHO funding and the report was never released
as for
Actual addicts prohibition only compounds their misery someone with a drug problem doesn't need a jail sentence
He needs help the Senate report notes that 90% of governments spending related drugs is devoted to enforcement that leaves only 10% for things like addiction treatment and harm reduction programs
Where anti drug dollars would be better spent several studies they've documented that when addicts overdose other users are
Who are present frequently don't call 911 out of fear they'll be arrested
Prohibition is a direct factor in such preventable deaths
That's not the only area where prohibition kills is Gardner wrote in 2000 from
1920 to 33 years of alcohol prohibition in the US about 800 gangsters died fighting each other in the streets of Chicago
In just the last two years in Tijuana a thousand people have been killed fighting over the drug trade
Tijuana is only an extreme example of a phenomenon that takes place around the world
Prohibition creates a black market that gives rise to organized crime and violence from Quebec's vicar wars to inner-city shootings in the US to the
Distabilization of entire Latin American countries only removing the control of drugs from criminals will address the root problem
This is one reason why decriminalization doesn't go far enough the criminalization means getting caught with drugs results in the equivalent of a traffic ticket rather than a rest
But selling drugs is still illegal so criminal distribution chains remain completely untouched
The criminalization also does nothing to address the massive resources that would still be wasted
targeting traffickers and ticketing users or the violations of civil liberties prohibition entails endless numbers of innocent people are
Subjected to the indignity of airport strip searches or worse thanks to the current drug hysteria
For many of these problems, especially the carnage afflicting Latin America we can thank the United States and its tragically misguided war on drugs
The US is consistently bullied other countries whenever they've considered liberalizing domestic drug laws
Aid packages have been withheld official passports denied threats of trade sanctions issued in Canada the US Drug Enforcement Agency
Recently conducted a covert sting operation that involved blatant acts in this regard of Canadian sovereign values and law as a
V.C. Judge ruled in August all this in the name of a policy that's consistently failed to eliminate drugs
Wars have victims and the war on drugs is no exception in recognizing this simple crushing the obvious truth
The Senate has produced a rare government document that speaks in a voice of moral sanity
Prohibition will always fail. Why are we so afraid to try something else? Right Andy lay me today's national post?
Oh

Good morning. We have mercilessly taken the following material out of context without endorsement or permission from those depicted
It is our ongoing mission to make everything that is good and decent look as ridiculous as possible
We hope we reach that goal or at least major lab
friends and distinguish guests
Simply put
President Bush can read only at the most basic level
I'm working with a variety of organizations to achieve President Bush's great goal
Learn basic vocabulary words
Education is a top priority for President Bush and I presented him with the children's dictionary
I'm proud that my husband just yesterday. He said
kindergarten because
Education brings opportunity our public schools are open to every child in America and
President Bush
Thank you for your help and you're so welcome. Okay, so they've
The police have got a suspicious package that they took out of one of those two cars and it contained medical equipment
Does that tell you anything? No medical equipment?
I'm just passing along there was no bomb nothing you know, oh, and that can't be who is that?
Who would they got on CNN and our office of stay wide and tell just like great Andrews in about 30 years was passed on it
Involved domestic security concern
The information was specific to vehicles and tag numbers that were seen in a location in Georgia
That information was subsequently bowed out to fought a law enforcement about midnight this morning
The vehicles passed through the toll booth at the west end of alligator alley one of the vehicles
Through the car booth without paying the toll
We have a lot of units on scene from higher county
Looking for the vehicles anyway, and they were subsequently stopped. We've been out here ever since I
Ended attempt to clear those vehicles and identify the I fully identify the occupants
Determined what if any thread exists from the vehicles at this point in time and and we've bought a lot of resources in from our domestic
Security Task Force to make that happen
With that I'll be happy to answer any questions that you might have
We are detaining the suspects they have not been charged at this time
Suspended into investigation
Some what they're offering
We have identified the three suspects we have identified the three suspects
Legal immigrants
We as far as we know they're all three legal. Yes
No, man, we're not going to release any specific information at this point. It's an ongoing investigation. We need to be
There's still a higher count of yes
I'm not gonna confirm that at this point
We're the those vehicles have not been completely searched at this point in time so the bottom line is we don't know the answer to that
We're still determining that it's supposed to be true. You'll be excited at this point
When the vehicles were initially stopped
Bob sniffing dogs were called to the scene the dogs did alert on both vehicles and from that we called the bomb team in from our task force
We have asked for reinforcement resources for Miami day
They have some specialized equipment that will help us complete the searches those resources just got here
They'll put it in Miami the region the message security task force and they'll help us out there
We don't know are these American I'm not gonna answer any questions right through their identity
Do we know if the dogs were wrong?
FBI's watch list is not gonna answer anything specific to the suspect that this one was that indicated
Well, it's there's a possibility that some accelerant or some explosive type material could be in the vehicles
That's all it that maybe a candidate. That's why you do a search afterwards
The verify that
We're holding them such a front to the investigation once we clear the vehicles will make a determination
Of what if any charges will be filed and and proceed from there
E.J. Pickle from the Fee only I'll only pass on the information saying from Georgia and it was very specific. Yes
I don't know what the conversation not gonna be specific about that
But I will tell you it was the information we had was specific the vehicles were identified by color by tag number
So we have very specific information. Okay, good for you. Okay, so they don't really know that much
They got the three news and want to tell us that they're from the Middle East even though before the story the initial story
Said that they appeared to be Middle Eastern, but then a lot of people appear to be Middle Eastern right?
They're probably people could confuse Miguel for being Middle Eastern. I would think
somewhat especially when you had that growth, you know
That grew some growth. So anyway, we'll you know keep keep on top of it and
South Florida's always you'll remember remember back in the beginning when we had the
That's not it. That's not what I wanted. You know what I wanted. You love that song. I do love that but the problem is we can't play that
You think that maybe that that's probably part of the conspiracy to the fact that that came up
Anyway, the point I was trying to make is that everything between the election on Tuesday and between when they found the original
in Boca and
Every goddamn thing it comes down to Pike and the fact that almost all of the terrorists lived in around the South Florida one at one point for some period of time
And now we have this now we have this threat on the alley
Anyway, like I said, we'll keep our eye on it
I'm gonna do the break a little bit early
Okay, because we got we got behind in the beginning and unfortunately when you get behind it
I mean, you know, it's one thing to go a minute over what do they go over like 15 minutes something like that on the most show this morning because they had that guy who's
Got the same agent as Jay Feeder and they were trying to do him a favor even though nobody knows who he is something like that
I don't know. I'm all ahead a little of a problem getting getting the show off this morning
And what he gets to be that age a lot of guys have trouble getting off nine thirty eight and then you know
Once we get a little ahead of ourselves, then we'll have time for fun and games

Sodom who say nine and George W's got 21
21 course guy when he gets now. What do you think I voted for?
Anyway, here's this article from London Times today
Written by Robin Shepherd in Moscow US Times Russia with profits of outing Sodom as
President Bush demanded action from the United Nations against Iraq
US emissary was lobbying for support in Russia the one member of the UN Security Council that might block approval for the use of force
John both in the undersecretary of state was officially in Moscow to discuss nonproliferation
But officials had privately that Iraq was at the top of his agenda a Russian veto would force the US and Britain to be considered their plans to
Osprey and Sodom was saying or to wage a low military campaign against Iraq
Diplomance and analysts are far from certain that Russia will agree to the use of force despite President Putin's rap for with Mr. Bush
They said that economic factors will be a key argument with a promise that Russia will be offered big contracts in the rebuilding of a post-war Iraq at the top of the list of incentives
The Soviet Union was largely responsible for the development of a rights military and industrial infrastructure and Russian firms would be well
Placed to help modernize it once that arm is gone
some experts argue that Russians recent announcement of a 26 billion pound investment program
That's like about 40 billion dollars in Iraq should have been seen as nothing more than brinksmanship
Russia's way of naming the price for its support we view the program as Russia's taking out its claimed any post-war deal
Paul Lewis a Russian Eastern European specialist at the economic at the economist intelligence unit in London said
They also say that Russian rail companies are likely to benefit from investment opportunities if Sodom is removed and Iraq's
Five billion pound at Damascus much more likely to be paid his Alexander Vershbow the US ambassador suggested this week
Washington could throw in some incentives of its own such as easier access to American markets and help in entering the World Trade Organization
One problem is that Russia has heard it all before a senior Russian politicians have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the post- Cold War relationship between Russia and America
Has been nothing but one way traffic Russia has pulled out of Vietnam and Cuba back down over NATO's plans to emit the Baltic states of
These former Soviet Union and kept quiet when US
Unilaterally pulled out of the anti-ballistic missile treaty
US Congress has failed to reciprocate by for example lifting Cold War era trade restrictions such as the Jackson vannich amendment
A double humiliation since its terms no longer apply even to China in addition Russia still has no firm timetable for
Membership another problem is that Russia already does well out of its relationship with Sodom
Russian industry is a prime beneficiary of the UN oil for food program and is able to capitalize on a variety of industrial projects in Iraq
That will be opened up to fierce foreign competition should Sodom be ousted more over for newer Iraqi regime decided to turn on its oil taps
The price of oil could plummet which would hurt the Russian economy considerably with elections in 2004
This is a factor that Mr. Putin can't afford to ignore
It's likely therefore that the price of Moscow support will be higher than the mere encouragement it's received so far
President Putin warned the UN Security Council yesterday that Russia may soon launch its own war against terrorism in Georgia
With the aim of hunting down Chechen guerrillas. That's not Georgia is in the West by the way folks
That's Georgia like in the Soviet former Soviet Union
Mr. Putin sent a message to the Council's four the permanent members as well as the Kofi and in the one security general
Saying that Russia would take adequate measures if Georgia failed to reestablish control of its
Ponkisi George Gorge region near the border with Chechnya
Chechen rebels have used the areas of base throughout their three-year war with Russia
Moscow's uneasy relations with Georgia have threatened to break down over the issue
If Georgia fails to take concrete steps to destroy the terrorists and they continue to attack us from its territory then Russia in strict compliance with international law
We'll take adequate measures for averting the terrorist threat Mr. Putin said in this message
However, he added that Russia had no intention of bringing about a change of government in the Lisi
How do you say that Miguel TBI LIS AI
How is it again exactly the Russian media speculated that Moscow and Washington have reached an agreement in which Mr
Putin would turn to blind eye to one US operation to write provided Mr. Bush does the same over Georgia
How do you like that?
You think it's a coincidence that these scumbags over there in
On the alley that they came from Georgia at least that's where they started their journey anyway mighty coincidence
Yeah, car inch by inch, you know, I would love to know Paula
What is on the ground on the shoulder of that highway because that
That robot is moving in
The arm on the top is moving toward it. What is on the ground? Are you watching that robot?
Yeah, that's pretty neat a lot of equipment essentially set up on the side of the grill
But definitely looks like a robot's got a tail right here
Um, and when would assume that these are articles and items that have been taken out into the trunk of the car or from inside the car
One would certainly assume that when you can use nothing untoward is what Mark Potter reported nothing untoward
Okay, you got that here's something untoward gay dolls band in the US
Oh
The first talking gay dolls in American history have just been banned in San Francisco the group responsible
GLM George little management is also squashed release of these dolls in Atlanta Dallas, Seattle, Boston and New York
GLM claims gay dolls are offensive to these straight conservative business community
When JDK products released their first two talking gay dolls Elton and Marshall
They never dreamed that the business leaders in five major cities in the US will be so intolerant to gay lifestyle
So this Frank Macon spakes a spokesman for JDK products
This was a classic case of two gay men not being allowed to come out of the closet
George little management the organizer for most of the gift trade shows in America
Band the dolls from being exhibited any of its shows this decision effectively denied the retail establishment prefer ever seeing them
Mike Dean president of Western exhibitors was jointly runs the San Francisco gift show with GLM
Claim these dolls would offend too many people
Says making these are funny dolls would say funny things with all the problems the gay community is having with its acceptance
It's a shame that George little management has decided to contribute to that discrimination
The dolls are hugely popular popular in Europe and have sold over
70 for the 5,000 pieces in less than three months
They're even given away as prices on game shows
But certain organizations in the USA seem determined to block their release in this country
There's nothing worse than a god damn gay doll. You know what I'm saying? What does one look like as a matter of fact
Probably Carlos not are not you Carlos and probably Fiki Carlos
Let's call him ugly Chuck, okay
I don't just Chuck the ugly part with George is doing okay because George George is hoping to try to like make everybody else ugly than he is
We'll call him Chuck is we call him Carlos
They're gonna think that freaky Carlos has got something to do with the show and that would be the last thing we'd want you know what I'm saying
The last thing we want so the package the first package that they found in the two cars contained medical equipment
They're not telling us exactly what kind of medical equipment what it was like syringes or whether something we might be suspicious about you know what I'm saying
They're not telling us that
Before we do anything else because I'm gonna forget about it yesterday
Bill Schneider on CNN had a pretty interesting piece when we were talking about the motivation for YGW seems to be so
Helvet on invading a rack right now
Some people are asking is president bushes iraq offensive being driven by the fall election and idea the vice president calls
Reprehensible the suggestion that I find
Reprehensible is the notion that somehow you know we saved this and now we just sprung it on them
But people in very high places are warning that a life and death policy like iraq
Must not be a simple match up of political convenience. What's the political convenience?
Strategist dick Morris spelled it out in a recent column
Polls show that only one issue works in bushes favor
Terrorism does Morris think the president is as they say
Wagon the dog to divert attention from other issues
He doesn't need to wag the dog Morris writes
He just needs to talk about wagging it to make the impact to keep control of congress
Even the White House has hinted at a political strategy as long ago as last January
We can also go to the country on this issue because they trust the Republican party to do a better job of
Protecting and strengthening America's military might and thereby protecting America. Why did the administration wait until September to make its case against iraq
White House chief of staff Andrew card told the New York Times from a marketing point of view
You don't introduce new products in august in his speech to the United Nations
President bush tried to shut down the political speculation
This is a life and death matter the president insisted
Should iraq acquire fissile material
It would be able to build a nuclear weapon
Within a year to those who say we want more evidence that there's a real threat the administration says
We can't wait for a smoking gun to turn up
We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud
To those who smell politics the administration's answer is sure or crisis made benefit the president politically
So what an issue of this magnitude should be the focus of a political campaign
What's wrong with that? What's wrong with that?
That was Bill Schneider on CNN yesterday the political analyst of CNN
Meanwhile the men were planning to attack mindy today says they wouldn't know and the other two words he used were Islamic writing
And then he went on to explain that he just had no idea for sure what that was and then the other items
He said that they sell were books and laptop computers now. I don't know that they've gone through those
As part of the 25% that's been sourced they've seen those
You hear that some of the material that's been taken in the two cars that they pulled over once again
Islamic writing for folks just joining us
Mark how no one should jump to the conclusion about these dogs alerting to these vehicles that mean simply
And we know that no explosive material has been found at this point. That means simply
It's not point in time that an accelerant may have been one of these city huckles. It does not necessarily mean these
She say vehicles she said it again
Anyway, Dana priest and joby warwick in today's Washington post right observer say evidence for war lacking report against the raccoals little
That's new the White House document released yesterday is evidence that it's time to overthrow
Sodom Hussein is a concise summary of his regime's abuses of Iraqis and its past use or possession of chemical and biological
Agents but it contains little new information and no bombshells
Showing that Hussein is producing new weapons of mass destruction or is joined with terrorists to threaten the U.S. or its interest abroad
administration officials seeking to persuade the public Congress and foreign allies that it's time to go to war had indicated recently that their strongest case
Rested on evidence of a rags weapons of mass destruction program and its efforts to develop ballistic missiles to launch them beyond its borders
But experts on a rags weapon resaid that on this subject to report with fewer exceptions
Recycles a mix of dated and largely circumstantial evidence that Hussein may be hiding the ingredients for these weapons and a seeking develop a nuclear capability
And weaponized chemical and biological agents the 20 page paper a decade of deception and defiance concludes
Iraq harbors stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons. It created before the 1991 Persian Gulf War as well as a limited number of missiles
Another systems for delivering them the stockpile includes highly lethal VX a nerve agent
So potent that a few drops on the skin can kill as well as anthrax and other staples of germ warfare
The report concludes that Iraq retains the expertise and infrastructure to build new weapons and is seeking to acquire critical parts and supplies
On a rags nuclear program it repeats a British think tanks finding last week that Iraq could likely build a nuclear weapon within a few months
But only if it manages the difficult feet of acquiring a enriched uranium from an outside source
The bulk of the reports assertions were attributed to reports by UN weapons inspectors who scoured Iraq throughout law
The weapons programs from 1991 to 1998 although the inspectors destroyed large amounts of weaponry and equipment
They were unable to account for all the chemical and biological warheads and bombs or rags emitted making
They disputed the rags claims that had destroyed the weapons died evidence
Other claims in the report were attributed to Iraqi defectors that were surveillance imagery that showed new construction in places where Iraq once manufactured weapons
Weapons experts who reviewed the document noted a few previously undisclosed details such as a new test platform repeatedly built for longer range missiles
But several several expressed surprise at the lack of fresh revelations
Given the high priority for knowing what's going on in Iraq
I'm stunned by the lack of evidence or fresh intelligence
So Gary Milhol, executive director of Iraq watch or Washington based non-profit institution at track developments in Iraq's weapons program
You'd expect that for the many billions we're spending on intelligence
They'd be able to make factual assertions that would not have to be footnoted to an open source
So in other words
Not much
What we got is not much
And that's just like we got what we got this morning on this business on the alligator rally not much
They're they've detained the three men. They're holding them. They found the Islamic writing on papers inside. They found the
Briefcase with medical supplies or at least the backpack
And a bunch of other stuff and they've got the bomb a rope the bomb squad robot is out there dittling around
And they've got all kinds of tents set up there. They've got a 20 mile stretch of alligator alley shutdown
When did that shut it out?

Uh Nicholas Christoff writes in the New York Times today and I'm keeping my eye and as a matter of fact
You better keep your eye on it too. Okay, okay, and feel free like to jump right in interrupt me in mid sentence
If you see something because I it's hard to keep an eye you know
When I on the page when I off to the right of my little TV
You got it
You got it see there's another one of those comments. We understand where you're coming from the guns in September right Nicholas
Christoff in the New York Times today president boy and by the way speaking of that I'm working on Monday and so is the hump
Yeah, we're both working on Monday. We're actually putting on a professional jr routine
There'll be no mo no guilty no edd. I'm sure but some of us fat
I guess the fat old Jews we work on the Jew holidays including me and a hump around Monday. I'll take a day for the both of you
Okay
Hey, listen you getting paid today. What do you think for this president Bush yesterday offered an eloquent forceful and overdue call for the
Wendell Hold Sodom who say an accountable right Nicholas Christoff in the Times today just one problem
He cited no evidence of any immediate threat
No reason that invading Iraq is any more urgent today than it wasn't say
2000 when mr. Bush is a candidate Huck and puffed about Sodom but never shared with voters any plans for an invasion
For months there've been hints about intelligence that the administration supposedly is gathered about an imminent Iraqi threat and links to terrorism
So it was deflating the hero again that Saddam is a monster who's regime tortures children in front of parents all true as it was a decade ago
Contrast Mr. Bush mr. Bush's appearance would legendary moment at the United Nations on October 25th
1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis ambassador L.A. Stevenson announced the new Russian missile sites in Cuba
The Russians in Cuban scoffed that it was all lies
So Stevenson brought in an easel and blown up photos of the Cuban sites
Where is the comparable evidence of urgency today is the Bush administration?
It's the Bush administration that raised the parallel level of the missile crisis
noting that Kennedy had considered preemptive strikes fair enough
Yet it's the differences that are the most telling to begin with Kennedy used the UN Spotlight to offer specific
impoperatorial evidence of an urgent new threat
And then he opted not for an invasion of Cuba but for an internationally supported naval quarantine
Yes, Kennedy did consider a lot of alternatives including military strikes
We call theater assurance in a key aid to Kennedy during the crisis
But after considering the innocence of idiots who would be killed
Considering the international law that would be broken Kennedy rejected that possibility
President Kennedy was deeply conscious that wars can slip out of control and during the crisis
He read Barbara Tuckerman guns of August Mr. Sorenson recalls Kennedy telling aids that he didn't want future their
Generations asking how the missile crisis had spiraled into war and nobody having a good answer
In his speech yesterday President Bush displayed Kennedy's toughness resolve and even eloquence
But he did not display the other qualities of statesmanship
Humility about the risks of miscalculation a passion to avoid war
Graham Allison a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government has written a book about the missile crisis
Note that Kennedy had stipulated that the missiles absolutely had to be removed from Cuba
The Kennedy turned first the diplomacy in a blockade
He offered the Russians a graceful exit and thus saved lives and avoided a dangerous spin into the unknown
Today as well why shouldn't war be a last resort instead of the first tool that President Bush grabs off the shelf
The fundamental question is left unanswered why initiating war against Sodom is better than the next option
Which is deterring and containing him professor Rallison said you could agree that this is an evil guy
He is evil who defied you on resolutions
He did and still ask why he's not susceptible to the same treatment that was used against Stalin who was also evil and dangerous and cheated
A succession of presidents chose to deter and contain Stalin rather than invade and occupy Russia
Just as every president until now is chosen to deter and contain Sodom before launching a war mr. Bush needs to show two things first
That the threat is so urgent that letting Iraq
Festive is even riskier than invading it and occupying it for many years to come second
That deterrence will no longer be successful in containing Sodom how would JFK have handled Iraq as a believer in the UN
He would have done everything he could with US muscle to get you end inspectors and their most deterrence and believes such a Kennedy
Esca approach built around robust international inspections backed by the threat of forces a last resort
Would also reduce the political fall out of war as eventually erupted
Unfortunately, we still have not heard from mr. Bush is a compelling case for the one course of act on which he seems fixated
Immediate war right Nicholas Christoff and plays New York Times
other dead football player
High school player dies after game
Corpus Christy Texas a high school football player died after collapsing following a freshman game
Stephen Pente of King high school was shaking hands with opponents from Ray high school after the Wednesday night game
When he fell to the ground unconscious in Waises County Medical Examiner was to conduct an op-satz op-sale later today several Ray football players at the 15-year-old point
They were played running back and linebacker for nearly an entire game scene short of breath in the second half
When I would tackle him I could hear him breathing really hard and kind of funny
Ray player John justice told the Christy call her times
I tackle him then get up and he just be lying on the ground breathing really really hard like it was gasping for air
It just seemed like something was really wrong from I guess it's a good thing they haven't finished the game, huh?
Boy it seems like we got one every day
Hey, you know, I beg your pardon 15 years old you have to be playing so hard
There's no audio on the tape so other than the websites. It's kind of hard to tell
Maybe our mark potter knows more about that in second with mark marks and file to this for quite a bit this morning
He's checking in like that to give us the very latest marker you there
Yeah, Leon and I can answer your question
About the very thing you're talking about what they did with that package and this information comes from Mike
Uh, who's with the Southwest Port original bomb squad. It's an umbrella group that represents a number of different agencies
Um, Mike said that that they had a package in one of these cars that they were
Suspicious of it
They took an x-ray device and looked at and they couldn't quite
Uh
Except what they were seeing they they had thought that a number of the devices were benign
But this one had some wires and then they were worried about that
So the use of a device that they described as a water cannon and use the technique that they call water stress
Uh to blow apart the package
Uh with water they didn't fire into it. They didn't blow it up
Uh, and when they were done with the procedure they came to learn that it was a it was some medical equipment
It was not any sort of safety threat. It was not a device a bomb device
It was medical equipment and the advantage of using this water system is that
You only use water you don't you don't destroy
Uh, the device to the degree that you would if you fired into it or or blew it up. Okay Mark. Thank you so much
Nothing really. No, they're just they're just filling time and it keeps showing us the picture of that one
That one of the two cars they're on the alley and the uh bomb squad robot, which is pretty neat to watch that little thing
You know it wouldn't you like to have one of those at home pretty cool. Sure
Uh, don't forget in a few minutes
I'm gonna read just a little bit from the introduction and um
Forward to this book for bitten truth by Jean Charles Bressard and Guillaume Dusquet
US Taliban secretorod diplomacy and a failed hunt for Bidlant just a uh, you know
They always use this word chilling everything on the news. Oh a chilling moment. Yeah, this is pretty chilling
In fact, you ought to tell all your children's about it
Maratham and Dosa this is one of the best stories of the day
City plans protest with pot giveaway all right
Santa Cruz, California
And we had the original story on this a week or two ago about the fact that the federal government went in there
In a town where they've legalized the medical marijuana and the federal government says oh you can't do that and they busted this joint and closed it down and
Anyway, city leaders plan to join medical marijuana users at a pot giveaway at city hall next week
Hoping to send a message to federal authorities that in this town medical marijuana is welcome
Joey Saza gonna send me a message. That's right. You didn't you see got five of the three? Of course
Oh, remember that Joey Saza's gonna send me a message. I'll send him a message
Anyway, the invitation comes a week after agents from the DEA arrested the high profile owners of a pot farm
And confiscated 130 plants have been grown to be used as medicine
It's just absolutely loads them to me that federal money energy and staff time would be used to harass people like this advice mayor Emily Riley
Who along with several city council colleagues plants to pass out medical marijuana to sick people from the garden like courtyard at city hall this coming Tuesday
Though the council passed a resolution denouncing the raid there was no official city sponsorship of the event council members in medical marijuana advocates
Are simply acting on their own in a public space said city attorney John Verison
The EAS spokesman Richard Meyer was surprised at the plan. Are you serious? That's illegal
It's like they're flouting federal law. He said I'm shocked that city leaders would promote the use of marijuana that way
What is that saying to our youth it's saying that you're a bunch of assholes is what they're saying okay?
State law in California as well as Alaska Colorado who I mean the vandal organ of Washington
Lozmer wanted to be grown distributed to people with a doctors prescription federal law prohibits marijuana use under any
Circumcises and of course we know that we don't the federal government doesn't have more fish to fry that at this particular time
Better things to be doing
In recent month federal agents working with local supportive and busting pot clubs and farms in northern California
Including a small pot farm last week about 55 miles south of San Francisco
Arresting owners Valerie and Michael Corral no indictment was filed against the couple leading activists for medical
Ameriwana their attorney said federal authorities don't plan to prosecute a spokeswoman if the West Attorney's Office
If she couldn't comment California medical marijuana growers and distributors work closely with local law enforcement
And are quite open about their programs in fact the farm rated by DE agents had been featured in national media
And the program is listed in the local telephone book
The courage of the Santa Cruz City Council and the growing anger and Congress are assigned to a genuine
grassroots invited all across this country
That'll put an end of these attacks on the sick and vulnerable said Robert Campi
Executive director of the Washington DC based marijuana policy project in 1992
77% of Santa Cruz voters approved a measure ending the prohibition of medical marijuana
Four years later state voters approved proposition 215 allowing marijuana for medicinal purposes and in 2000 the city council approved
Norinance allowing medical marijuana to be grown and used without a prescription
So there you go. They state the local government
Passing all kinds of resolutions over a well-missed part from the public and the federal government the freaking DEA
Because they have to justify their continuing existence. They're going in there and busting the pot farms and arresting people
And then I even bothering to charge them. It just you know just something to do
Just putting on a good dog and pony show looking out
We're protecting the youth of our country right then our guard right from the national post
That's one of the best and things I've ever seen in my life
Of course it makes a little bit too much sense. Don't confuse America's drug policy in the so-called war on drugs with common sense or with what really works
I'm a correspondent joining us now from our DC bureau to tell us more about the FBI
Involvement and perhaps more information on the three suspects who are in custody Kelly good morning
Good morning, Darren why don't we start with what with what we have at least confirmed
A variety of law enforcement sources
Let's start off with the fact that we have confirmed that there was a conversation that was overheard in a restaurant in Calhoun
Georgia by a patron who was there with her son
She called that information into the Georgia bureau of investigation. That is the state version of the FBI
There was a below put out which is a beyond the lookout for these two vehicles
There was a very good description of the vehicles and license plate tags that was given to law enforcement
After one of the cars we are told confirmed by law enforcement blew through a toll booth a sheriff
pulled over one of the vehicles the other vehicle voluntarily pulled in behind that first vehicle
And the law enforcement officer began some questioning there were three individuals who have been taken into custody
Are being questioned by members of the joint terrorism task force
As we all see there are two vehicles also in custody
When as we have heard Mark Potter report
The bomb squad dogs were brought they did react to
Something in the vehicles now. I am I have been cautioned by the FBI that those dogs are primarily trained to react
To black powder black powder can be found as Mark has also said in fireworks
It can be found in in shelf for hunting
So there could have been at some point
It's something as innocuous as a as a hunting rifle in that vehicle that the dogs did
On the dogs now the bomb squad
Is being very cautious has closed off part of that highway to ensure the safety of all involved

Five votes for Yes or I'm a fart, eight for Ariel Sharon, eleven for the Pope,
which I'm sure that Miguel is scratching his head wondering how can that be.
Osama Yamama bin Laden, aren't you scratching it?

Osama 20, Saddam Hussein 43, and George W. Bush 56, seems to be pulling away.
Anyway, here's the introduction from, in fact this book is so important that there's two introductions.
There's a forward, there's a prologue, and they're all worth a reading.
You're right, I might have to read the whole book on here, you know, starting like on Monday?
Go for it.
But then they won't go out there and buy it.
Well, you know something, nobody's gonna go, maybe ten people out there would go out and buy it anyways,
called Forbidden Truth by Jean Charles Brissard and Guillaume Descay.
Introduction, the introduction is written by, at least the first introduction, written by Joseph Trento,
author of the Secret History of the CIA, managing director of the National Security News Service.
He says, Forbidden Truth is the story of the greatest foreign policy blunder of the past thirty years.
This important book tells him the aftermath, the blowback of the United States and Saudi Arabian policy of creating an
Arabic Islamic force to bring down the Soviet Union by marrying it in a war in Afghanistan.
Forbidden Truth is the story of how that force turned against its creators with effectiveness and vengeance.
In the pages of Forbidden Truth, or all the leftovers from this ill-conceived US policy, Saudi frontmen,
the runes of BCCI, Saudi and Pakistani intelligence, they all came together to assist Osama bin Laden in retooling the Arab fighters of the Afghan war into an Islamic Frankenstein.
All of this happening under the nose of a CIA unwilling to revisit and array of forces that once had been allies.
On September 11, 2001, the world saw 3,000 lives destroyed, President George Bush reacted with confusion, anger and resoluteness,
and began to lead the country in a handful of allies into the war on terrorism.
The US went into war mode as a result everything in government has deferred of the war, especially the truth.
Young George Bush did not have the luxury of time to consider if the chickens from his father's foreign policy misadventures had come home to roost.
Fortunately for all of us others, John Charles, Bricard and Guillaume Discai did take the time.
The result is the most important explanation of the secret history of how the US came to be attacked and who was responsible.
The answer to the answers the authors uncovered will and should make you very angry.
Many of the same men around young George Bush now played a major role in the original failed scheme.
Forbidden truth is the first comprehensive revelation of how the foreign policy of the president's father and the cozy relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia exploited and created an extremist Islamic mercenary army that eventually turned on its creators.
In the pages of Forbidden Truth are the awful details that our government understood that the Saudi government was financing Bin Laden's Zalqada through Islamic charities years before the attacks.
Like Shakespearean characters, the evil doers in young American president had a dark thread connecting them, a common benefactor, the Saudi royal family.
Their wealth had helped press god Bush and his sons grow rich and powerful over the years.
It also had kept opposition to the royal family at bay at home by funding for decades the most extreme forms of Islam.
Few would imagine that these sophisticated partners, the Bushes and the royal family, would together create the conditions and opportunity for terrorism to grow in a worldwide network.
As CIA director of the president's father George Herbert Walker, Bush joined with the Saudi prince to create a bank for covert operations to fight the Soviets through the Islamic cause of Afghanistan.
The Bank of Commerce and Credit International, BCCI, collapsed in scandal, but its personalities and pieces became the vessels and conduits of the terrorist network.
These same personalities were George's partners in policy and in some cases private business.
But then Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush introduced the Bin Laden family to William Casey to help the US win its proxy war in Afghanistan.
When the Saudi sided with Kuwait and long festering dispute about stealing oil, President Bush turned Saddam Hussein from a friend to a foe.
He put the full force of the US with his old friends. The United States fought a war to save two kingdoms.
Our reward was that our soldiers and state department employees were not allowed to publicly worship in Saudi Arabia.
Bush lost the presidency, but the Saudis took care of his family when the Sion who would be the next Bush in the White House need to help with harkan energy, old friends again came to the rescue.
As Bill Clinton dealt with the indifference of the Saudis to their support for Islamist extremists, Bin Laden blew up our barracks at Kobar.
The Saudis hinder our investigation and denied the truth that Bin Laden and his forces had begun to move against the royal family inside Saudi Arabia. Their motivation was money.
Their methods came straight from organized crime, extortion. PS protection or more threatening factors will come on the King's private facts line, then worse, PS are tribute or the revolution will be at home not in Afghanistan or at Yemen.
The era of princes and their hangars on made the decision to pay. Now nearly a year after the horrors of September 11th and the consulate with bombing of Afghanistan would need have been lawdnourmolo Omar captured with more and more Saudi showing up in the terrorist ranks, more bad news, missed signals, missed warnings, the FBI and CIA try to blame each other.
The day after the 9-11 attacks by President Cheney called the Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschel tried to talk him out of any major probe into the intelligence failure.
There could be no serious investigation because a serious investigation in the end would reveal that money and oil were more important than protecting Saudi Arabia or the United States.
A serious investigation would reveal that bankers, politicians and family friends and business suits support Al Qaeda.
A serious investigation would demonstrate that George Bush's father was the midwife to the birth of this monster. A serious investigation would demonstrate that Middle East oil money still helps support members of the Bush family.
The real terror for George Bush will come when he reads for Bidden Truth. For Bidden Truth is the only serious investigation available as up to now only then will he finally connect the dots. Perhaps Al-Askis father would come in for that long overdue talk.
To be President you need to know how to handle the guilty knowledge that comes with power sadly Bush has more than his fair share.
That's the first introduction by Joseph Trento who's author of the Secret History of the CIA and managing director of the National Security News Service.
Did I miss anything here on CNN? No. Oh. 20 miles of alligator alley still closed down terrorist threat. They're still checking out the two cars. They've got the three guys and custody.
They don't want to say they were of Middle Eastern descent but the fact is they found Islamic writing and maybe they were just trying to learn Islam. You think so Islamic writing? Just Arabic? Learn Islamic writing. Learn Arabic. See I got sucked into that by CNN and Molli say a lot of stuff.

Introduction.
I did promise I'd read the introductions and the preface and the forward.
Not too many books.
You'll read that have two introductions and preface and a forward, but in this case, well
worth it for Bidden Truth.
This introduction written by Wayne Mads, the Washington correspondent for Intelligence
Online.
He says, long before the world first heard of the FBI's Minneapolis Phoenix and Oklahoma
City, Memoranda, what was known to U.S. law enforcement prior to 9-11, John Charles
Bressard and Gayoam Dascay presented the first print tradition of forbidden truth.
A unique insight into what the U.S. and other governments knew and when they knew it concerning
the future plans of Bin Laden's al-Qaeda network.
After three years of painstaking research, the office succeeded in connecting the dots
and repeating the behind the scenes maneuvering preceding the December 11 terrorist attacks
on New York City and Washington, DC, especially gripping as the tale of John O'Neill, the former
deputy director of the FBI's New York office, who spent years tracking Bin Laden and his
Confederates.
As the chief counter-terrorist agent within the bureau, O'Neill focused on the al-Qaeda
network following a series of terrorist attacks aimed at Americans, especially in Saudi
or maybe in East Africa.
In October 2000, al-Qaeda set off a bomb amid ships the U.S. as cool and aid in a harbor.
O'Neill describes his frustrations in dealing with non-cooperative U.S. ambassador to Yemen,
who along with her CIA and State Department interlocutors were more interested in placating
Saudi and American oil interest than bringing the al-Qaeda perpetrators to justice.
It's not often that a book provides an unintentional last testament, but in forbidden truth, O'Neill
provided the office with his virtual last words on the subject of his investigation of
Bin Laden's network and his thoughts on cover-ups reaching high into the echelons of political
power in Washington, Saudi Arabia and the oil company headquarters in Texas.
On 9-11-2001, after an illustrious career with the FBI, O'Neill died while carrying out
his new duties as director of security for the World Trade Center.
Fortunately, Bersard and Deskay have provided for the historical record the words that O'Neill
may have himself panned had he survived in the 9-11 attack.
There's been a general tendency in the meeting among America's political and military leaders
to begin the al-Qaeda and Taliban timeline on September 11.
Bersard and Deskay have explored this myth by describing the close economic ties between
the Bush and Clinton administrations, U.S. big oil and the Taliban and their Saudi patrons.
In connecting the dots between Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and the U.S., Bersard and Deskay
reveal the main principles involved in negotiating a lucrative but controversial oil and gas
pipeline deal with the mullahs of Kandahar.
The readers introduced to Laili Helms and Afghan American with ties to the former Afghan
world house, Imuja Hadin, the Taliban, and most interestingly, the CIA, her uncle by
marriages former CIA director Richard Helms.
In the weeks prior to the 9-11 attack, Laili Helms was orchestrating high-level meetings
between senior members of the Bush administration and emissaries of Mullah Mohammed Omar, the
main benefactor of Osama Yomama Bin Laden.
Bersard and Deskay successfully connected dots to an even degree they explained the actual
motivation behind the United States' 6-plus-2 group, pipeline politics, not the Bally
who would aim of bringing about a ceasefire between the Taliban and their Northern Lions
rivals.
The authors revealed that it was at a May 15, 2000 meeting in Berlin that a U.S. official
ominously presented the following ultimatum to the Pakistani delegation who were the
Taliban's interlocutors at the meeting.
Either you accept their offer of a carpet of gold or we bear you under a carpet of
bombs.
It was a statement that would take on even greater meaning after the 9-11 event.
When forbidden truth was first published in France in November 2001, skeptics inside
and outside the U.S. government scoffed at the obvious contention that French intelligence
had warned the FBI about the terrorist connections and ongoing flight training in the U.S. of Zachary
A. Rias Moussawi, the so-called 20th hijacker, who was arrested on a visa violation in Minnesota
August 17, 2001.
These skeptics were later confronted with incovertible validation of this information when FBI
had many employees chief division counsel Colleen Rowley, a 21-year veteran agent wrote
in a blistering letter of the FBI director Robert Mueller, a French intelligence service
confirmed Moussawi's affiliations with radical Islamic fundamentalist groups and activities
connected to Osama bin Laden.
She was the whistleblower.
Rowley's concerns along with Ospo down in July 10, 2001, morning from the Phoenix FBI
agent Kenneth Williams concerning the activities of Arab flight students in the May 1998 report
from the Oklahoma City FBI, concerning similar flight training by Middle Eastern man and
that city fell into the lapse of what Rowley described as flippant FBI bureaucrats in Washington.
The FBI headquarters, including two special units, tasked to investigate religious extremists
in bin Laden, the radical fundamentalist unit and the UBI.
Respectively, they refused to authorize a full investigation including critical electronic
surveillance of these suspected terrorists.
The world of intelligence in which the truth is not always the truth and lies are not always
lies has been characterized by some observers as a hall of mirrors.
But the failure to connect the dots and fuse and analyze critical intelligence before 9-11
cannot merely be blamed on the staggering nature of analyzing disparate pieces of information
from a multitude of oftentimes questionable sources.
In addition to the French intelligence that came to senior U.S. law enforcement and intelligence
officials, we now know that similar hardened intelligence came from the intelligence and
police agencies of Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, India, Israel, Russia, Germany, Kazakhstan, Canada,
the Cayman Islands, and Italy.
The Italian counter-terrorism police had recorded a conversation in the summer of 2000
in which a Yemeni sheet described what sounded like the plans for 9-11, saying an attack
was planned that would be one of those strikes you'd never forget.
A terrifying thing it'll move from South to North from east to west, he who made this plan
as a madman but a genius it will turn you to ice.
Skeptics continued to derive any notion that the Bush administration had advanced warning of 9-11,
but resarded in Deskale out one of the most important clues in tracking any criminal enterprise,
the money trail.
It's a trail that connects Osama bin Laden to other members of his family involved with
construction and financial projects throughout the world. They're so-called good bin Laden's.
Yet the links don't merely end with the greater bin Laden family they involved the house of
Assad, the Pakistani Inter Service Intelligence Agency, and other wealthy Saudi bankers and
merchants. Islamic churches and addresses, U.S. oil tycoons, the U.S. defense contractors
like the Carlisle group. The links even extended to the very heart of the administration
include President George W. A prior recipient of bin Laden family investment money, his father
and advisor to Carlisle and its major client have been Laden group, and vice president Dick
Cheney, a beneficiary of Saudi money, largest as the head of the oil services company Haliburton.
While President Bush portrays himself as a leader with myopic world view from referring to
Pakistan, a president pervezmo sharp during the 2000 campaign as general general, and believing
he was elected to being under the impression that the Taliban was a very engrossed band,
his coterie of friends and business partners certainly see them at least in South Asia with
perfect 2020 vision. And it's this view that should have all alerted them to the dangers of
dancing with the likes of the Taliban, corrupt Pakistani generals, and Saudi sheiks. While brave
and selfless FBI agents like John O'Neill saw the dangers posed by Al Qaeda and their Saudi and
Pakistani friends, the U.S. oil intelligence complex was contended with treating with the enemy.
For a hidden truth answers a number of questions concerning the failure by the world's only remaining
superpower to prevent one of the most tragic days in American history. During the cold war when
my colleagues and I stood watching Navy facilities monitoring the movements of Soviet submarines,
such lapses and vigilance would have had dire consequences and we knew it. In those days there
were no tolerance for such mistakes. This tenant has been largely lost on today's bloated intelligence
and law enforcement infrastructure which has more money and resources available to it now than
at any time in our nation's history. Restart in Deskay have laid the groundwork for future
investigations and tear results that shook the world. As the history books are written about 9-11
as reports of government committees and possible commissions are issued for Biden truth will
remain a seminal reference point for all those who are compelled to look beyond the veil of secrecy
thrown around the events leading up to America's worst and most costly terrorist attack.

All vision changes forever. His talent like it is style has already impacted millions of Americans.
His appearances on Oprah have propelled him into the national limelight. Get ready for a
doctor fill. Well, Phil, please admire 20 years. Don't cry. I'm not crying. Look at me when you talk.
I'm looking right at you. Your problem is you're stupid. No, he's me and my husband got up with big
butt too and you're stupid. Why are you crying? You see I don't have any sympathy for you.
I'm facing me my husband here in the 80s. We haven't had sex in like 10.
I wouldn't have sex with you either. Look at the can on you.
Dr. Phil, you know the problem seems to be I come home. I want to watch TV. I want to tell me about you.
Tell me about her. Well, I'm not trying to tell you. She comes into the room.
No, tell me what she does. Tell me what you do. I sit in the chair and I have the TV on.
She comes too busy watching TV is your deal. That's what men want to do. We just want to watch TV.
You can't do it. Why I want to do it? And you can't do it. See your problem is your dumb.
You're a dumb watching TV idiot. Excuse me? I said you're a dumb. Don't I ball me like that.
I'm trying to help you. You're on my show. You don't have your own show. Do you? You know, you need
some of this. Oh, I'm out there. Don't get it. Oh, Dr. Phil. He's Dr. Phil. He just doesn't. Now, why are you
talking so quiet? You see, already I can tell that you're a pushover. But, but he just doesn't don't
tell me what he does. I just don't understand. I've got some of this for you too. Some of this.
Dr. Phil, this is for you. He go, Mr. Nonson. Boy or some love for you too.
1047 at 560 W. Cure Me. You remember you were asking me whether it's the East Bond or the West
Bond lanes, etc. Right. Doesn't really make any difference. It was the East Bond lanes. But
nevertheless, they've got both East and West Bond lanes shut down alligator rally. Just mention
that for anybody who's planning trip to Naples, maybe to go see the beesleaf this weekend.
Anybody wants to negotiate the sale of the beesleaf properties, etc.
Chaining enters hospital for checkup. Yeah, we know about that. Vice President Dick Chaining
who's got a history of heart trouble entered a hospital this morning for what AIDS described as a
periodic and routine heart checkup. Well, not the good news is I guess he's out of hiding now,
right? Now you can find them. Well, no, not necessarily. He's in some hospital somewhere.
The routine does it say which hand? No, it doesn't say which hospital. The routine exams include
EKG to measure his heart rhythm and a scan of the pacemaker plus and planted in Chaining's
chest last year, which monitors any regular heartbeat. Yeah, he's he's just fine. How you doing, Dick?
Oh, we're fine. That's what we thought. Close shape for special ops forces in Afghanistan.
U.S. Special Operations Forces in Afghanistan have been ordered to shave and wear regular
uniforms to look more like U.S. soldiers rather than locals according to an official U.S. Special
Operations Command in Tampa. You ordered to shave facial hair and re-adapt uniform and grooming
standards came after a special ops commander general major general Jeff Lambert saw numerous
photographs of troops operating on the ground in Afghanistan with full beards and partial
uniforms. The official said Lambert, a career special operations soldier-based at Fort
Pragg, North Carolina, confirmed with a joint commander on the ground in Afghanistan with 10
and general Dan McNeill and senior special operations forces leadership officials said.
And a agreement between the two commanders when the last week was made that the special
ops forces would return to the standard uniform and a shave and a haircut in a partridge in a
period three. Anything new going on on Eali? Which car? The very first one which would have been a
light color. Most people are calling it a Nissan Maximal, which it isn't. The car we have is not
a Nissan, but the tag does match and the vehicle description is a light colored border sedan.
So as the car says we, I don't know if you can see our air right now, but as a car,
so that our parts on the side the highway is the car in front. Right. The car in front was the
first vehicle that we pulled over. After we pulled that vehicle over, another vehicle pulled over
with it. So we ended up having two vehicles. At that point our backup units responded and
part of that. We know. Get back to us when you know something new. Anyway, two of these three stories,
you just facts me already have, but the third one I did not have. Let's see, we'll use this
other one first. And by the way, I'll get back to the book, the preface and the a prologue and the
forward. I mean, it's all more three than even Miguel finds it fascinating. Not.
Now what is that? What is that little nervous lamp? It was completely fascinating. I thought it
was. And like I said, the preface to the American edition I'm going to read it. And when I get
around to it, we've got a lot of stuff today, lots of stuff. Plus we're keeping our IP on the LAC.
What's going on with that alleged terrorist plot to do something in Miami. They're not cooperating
apparently. As if we don't have enough problems already. And again, I don't know if you are
able to see our air, but on the on the left side of our screen, we have a map showing that as far
as we're concerned, the story begins in Calvin, Georgia in North. Yeah, we know that. They're not
cooperating based on what? Where'd you get that? It's set on the screen. Sources said that they are not
cooperating. Now, I didn't that FDLE guy that they had on earlier, then he said that they were
cooperating kind of sort of somewhat. That's what he said. And now they're not cooperating. Well,
it's time to like, you know, get the gloves off. Time to start beating the snout out of them and like,
you know, hang them up by their toes. X Illinois Priests collected child porn, a former Roman Catholic
Priests Played Agility yesterday to possession of three computer discs and hundreds of pages of
images showing naked boys engaged in sex act and sadomasochistic activity. Vincent McCaffrey,
50, resigned from the Priests in 1992. He later worked at home furnishing store, managed a service
station and sold insurance. Authorities said some of the pornography, which includes images of
boys as young as six being beaten, found and gagged and locked in cages were found in under McCaffrey's
mattress. Assisted, US attorney Marcus T. Funk, that's with an N. Marcus T. Funk,
told US District Judge John Dera that McCaffrey had molested someone while he was a priest,
but Dera cut him off and kept the hearing focused on the child pornography charges. Don't bother
with that. Okay. Don't the confuses with the facts. Information concerning McCaffrey when his
priest is under court seal, but much of it could come out during the sentencing hearing schedule
to begin December 9th. McCaffrey could be sentenced to as much as 20 years in federal prison and find
a half million dollars if the judge agreed with federal prosecutors on all the points they
say make the former priest crimes unusually serious. Images of boys as young as six being beaten,
bound and gagged and locked in cages. Ice gone pops, Plymouth Priest arrested for rape of child.

in the late 1970s and early 1980s. So, Colfee, for people in the area? Yes, it is. And of course,
the state of the... Georgia Department of Public Safety news conference in a few minutes.
Now, what are they going to give to us? I mean, they'll kill some time for CNN. What's the
Georgia Department of Public Safety going to tell us? Since these guys were already well on the road,
they were on a Hershey Highway coming down I-75 from Calhoun County. Where was it again? What was the
restaurant? Shoney. A Shoney's Big Boy. And you told me before the show I asked you if you're
reading the Shoney's and you said, you had a wild experience, a wild and testinal experience,
but they sure do have that good strawberry pie. See, I say that, but I don't know that because I
haven't eaten in a big boy in about a hundred years. There's a live brother's big boy, which is
very big and Detroit, and Shoney's. Don't we have a Shoney's right out there on D.B. Road Extension?
Is that still there? Somewhere around there, yeah. Yeah, right by 595. There's a Shoney's.
Showing off. I think I have time to do the preface here. Well, like I said, preface to the American
edition, the book again for Bidden Truth. It's a paperback. You don't have to spend an armor like the
Vibe. It's on Nation Books by John Charles Bersart and Guillaume Descay. And my friends
are very good. So if I'm just pronouncing their names, tough crap. Preface to the American
edition, it is May 2002 and Osama Bin Laden and his lieutenants are as well known as Bill Gates
and his software. The irony of infamy. I remember walking in London most of them about a year ago
in the company of a banker, a specialist and fund management who services were greatly appreciated
by his wealthy clientele from the Persian Gulf. On that day, we were having our fourth interview,
I think, by this time we'd reached an understanding and we were no longer just discussing the secrets
and sins of a Middle East and businessman. As we strolled towards St. James Park, he told me about
the everyday life of his parents. Somewhere in the village overlooking them at a train into the
north of Beirut. Voicerslam with great animosity complained about his father's inability to
converse normally with his daughter and English schoolgirl who was a passionate militant
and environmentalist group. Further on in Paul Maul after having walked past the walls of the
shelter of the legendary Travelers Club, which he sometimes frequented, the place in London where
mercenary aristocrats and adventurers diplomats can be found suddenly he began to speak in harsh
tones occasionally turning around. He began to recount family stories of how the financing of
Islamic terrorism had succeeded. We talked about the accounting operations of accredited establishment
in the United Arab Emirates and his trips to Islamabad in particular to the bank used by
Pakistani Secret Service to support the Taliban and al-Qaeda. As always it was the concern of
a Saudi religious chief allied with one of the four thousand princes who make up the royal family
and whose right-hand man had organized a financial circuit from Dubai to the British Virgin Islands
for the profit of Osama bin Laden. Officially bin Laden was then an ordinary terrorist, albeit one
who had blown up two US embassies and attacked the USS Kool, sought naturally by the FBI but in
whom most diplomats beyond the frontiers of the West were not interested. The multiple oil contracts
with Saudi Arabia then necessitated a certain understanding of these specificities of the religious
dictatorship operated by King Fad and Prince Abdullah clearly one did not crush such an invaluable ally
in the name of seizing a bandit. Therefore at that time these enterprises were mentioned only
Sotovoce very quietly even by the two peaceful pedestrians walking under the London drizzle,
especially under the London drizzle. The city is home to dozens of fortunes built around the
oil wells of the Gulf. I think we better do the break and I'll come back and finish this you know
from sir because time is of the essence baby and God only knows what heavy duty craft may be
coming down to that.
My life and love this is 4.256 UAH2A.
Friday you bastards.
You're in drinking chubby and blow up the whole goddamn place.
You're in drinking chubby and blow up the whole goddamn place.
One of the cars one of these two cars on the alias traced back to a family to an address in
Hannover Park a suburb of Chicago and that they're just a bunch you know they're talking to
neighbors and they're just a bunch of like ordinary people kind of like Mohammed Abtan all of those
guys which we all remember very well. It is again this is Hannover Park Illinois it is quite a
way outside Chicago to the north and west it is a suburb it is that very quiet suburban community.
All right Jeff we're going to let you go and find more information we've just passed the
top of the hour imagining we have a lot of new viewers joining us. No we don't.
Let me just read the background again on the steering case anybody is rolling out of the
sack right now or isn't aware what's been going on all morning. Alligator Alley remains closed
right now as I speak after police detained three men in two cars because of a possible terrorist
threat. Bomb sniffing dogs alerted authorities to material in both vehicles but no explosives
were immediately found. EJ Piccolo the FDLE said authorities blasted open with a peer to be a
backpack taken from one of the cars and a robot was being used to search the vehicles. Bomb squad
technicians and protective blast suits also removed a suitcase and plastic bags from one car and
searched the interior in the trunk. We're taking it very seriously until we can eliminate the
possibility of a threat or verify that there wasn't legitimate threat Piccolo said. Piccolo said
the men in the vehicles had not been arrested but we're being detained he also said all three
were US citizens would not identify them any further although there was a slum and there was
Arabic handwriting found on papers inside one of the cars. Florida police said they tracked down the
cars after one of them ran a toll plaza. John Vagnardi of the Florida Highway Patrol said the
men were uncooperative when they were stopped and refused to allow a search so the authorities
brought in the bomb sniffing dogs. The cars both of Illinois licensed plates remain on
in the state 75 about 50 yards apart. The FHP shut down the 20 miles stretch after one o'clock
this morning when the vehicles were stopped and like I said the Alley in both directions is closed
right now. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation had issued an advisory for two cars yesterday
after woman at a show knees restaurant in Calhoun, Georgia in the northwestern part of that state
told police she overheard three men and Middle Eastern descent discussing terrorist plans
Wednesday night. CBS Radio News reporter Michael Hibben said the woman apparently reported
the men were bragging that they were going to inflict damage in South Florida and reportedly
said they would let Americans mark the September 11th anniversary and then strike on Friday the 13th.
The highway patrol said the road was blocked off from the toll booth east of Naples to state road 29.
Ever take state road 29? Not that I know of. Now that's the shortcut. That's the
triple of them. It's like a bearing man. You can go through there about 400 miles an hour.
It's an old two lane highway. If you're like going over to West Coast you know if you're
like going over to Tampa to Bernstake House to pay respects to the late Bern Lackser
we're figuring out over the same pit to hang out with some of those old people on the shuffle
board courts. Sounds fun. What is it? I said that sounds fun. Oh it's great. Those are the
grandparents of the people living in the surfside. I'm telling you boy you're sure
facts in me just a pile of stuff here man. A pile. First one that's coming through. Huh?
There's a pile of snake coming through. Wow look at this. This thing goes on and on by Alicia
Solomon. Oh oh. More than the Jewish stuff. Don't be saying Jewish stuff on the Jew holidays. Okay
I'm on. Now did I interrupt? What did I do? Did I interrupt my reading? I think I did. Didn't I?
Oh here's the Georgia guys. The robot that has been provided by Metro Day. No these aren't
the Georgia guys. This is back on the alley. Anyway now where where the hell was I? See this is bad
interrupting your reading in the middle of an important article. It's gonna mark the spot.
Yeah right. Here it is. This is from the preface. The name of the book is Forbidden Truth by
John Charles Bersarding-Heeham Deskay. The International Best Cellar banned by the Ben Laden family.
The purpose which they wrote goes on the say since 1998 the professional newsletter intelligence
online had published several investigations of these charitable associations and companies
with Saudi, Pakistani and United Arab Emirates origins which without giving them too much
away without giving too much away finance del Qaeda. Each time our sources trembled. Some
begged us to promise them we would no longer cover the subject but 9-11 changed everything.
Well some of it loud enough as lieutenants became public figures. Their story was shown on hundreds
of television programs and gradually the reasons behind the emergence of their movement and its
expansion over the course of the past 10 years became fundamental questions for our understanding.
After asking how was it possible everyone did everybody wanted to know why was it possible?
The book Forbidden Truth seeks to bring together the first brief responses. Published for the
first time in France November 14 2001 it brought together three years of investigations
of the political channels financial networks oil stakes and secret diplomatic deals slowly created
room for the maneuver for this group of nostalgic terrorists of the holy war when their crude
ideology swearing as much by the Quran is by the Kalashnikov. After the attacks we tried to
publish it as quickly as possible because at the moment when the military operations were getting
underway in Afghanistan it seemed important precisely not to focus on Afghanistan. It was more
matter of looking closer to home. We wanted to decipher this badly controlled nexus without which
Osama bin Laden's companions would have rained just distant armed cranks praying in the desert.
We wanted to dissect this entanglement of negligence and political interests and calculations from
the park hay floors of the foreign office in London to the marble floors of the Texas oil companies
in Houston and to the fitted carpets of Fadushia recumbenties in Geneva. In fact appendix seven of
this book originally commissioned by the French intelligence services was the basis of a French
parliamentary report that resulted in the closing of several so-called Islamic charities. The
report was handed over to George Bush by Jacques Girard Thuring as first visit to the US in the wake
of 9-11 but at no time did we imagine the consequences of the revelations contained in these pages.
Once worse we never once wanted this book to become party to the investigations that were going
on right under our eyes. That would have been a waste of time and effort but its contents overtook us.
We had taken stock of it in December 2001 when several days before Christmas a committee of
special inquiry of the security council of the UN moved to hear us. It's mission to reconstruct
a money trail thanks to which bin Laden has been able to pursue his activities. The hearing took
place in Paris and a quiet annex at UNESCO headquarters. It focused exclusively on the financial
networks and parallel diplomacy that it followed the Taliban and Osama bin Laden to gain an
aura of power. What transpired was two hours of tight technical discussion in the presence of eight
diplomats who had recently discovered the extent of these collusions and who did not hide their
embarrassment before the seriousness of the charges level at Saudi Arabia. From India to the US this
panel of investigators represented the gamut of leading nations all of which at one time had gone
greedily fishing opting to preserve their relationship with the monarchs of the Gulf or their
pipeline projects in central Asia over the fight against terrorism but henceforth they forced
themselves to examine it sometimes to the point of fear. As the book has been covered by the foreign
press reactions of a different sort of reached us aggressive one sometimes in the form of insults.
French bankers, American oil companies and Persian Gulf businessmen, like you're recently
in sconce and financial paradises in Europe or the Antilles didn't take well as such as spilling
of the beans. These were the men whose fortunes derived from family secrets and maybe a few words
exchanged on the tarmac at private airports. One of them in not the least yes I've been
lawden brother of Osama a Swiss citizen of just one year hate of an ever our
berefts of offshore companies stepped up litigation using all the possibilities afforded under Swiss
freedom of press laws to stop the book's publication on the grounds that he disapproved of our
general approach. The court that pronounced the act of censorship didn't seem to have taken into
account the text context. This is proof that not all truths should be spoken especially in the land
of secret banking Switzerland. Nevertheless despite the unexpected support of the Swiss justice
system yes long been lawden did not escape an investigation a money laundering watchdog at the
French finance ministry spotted suspicious transfers being made through one of his accounts
an action was quickly brought in March 2002 by magistrate Renau van Roombike a specialist
in financial cases at which we were asked to appear as witnesses in our capacity as authors
in this book. Swiss police carried out searches across the country on March 27 probing the money
laundering allegations the operation involved searches at the headquarters of nine companies and
forehomes in Geneva, Bern, Zürich and Zurich a week later been lawden's villain can in the south
of France was also searched at van Roombike's request. Beyond these developments we felt that after
nine eleven with investigations like this one there were others something was transformed
perceptions perhaps a sense of urgency a general impression that from now on world affairs
were more interest. After finally terrorizing us the terrorist have surrendered some of their
vigilance to our societies with the endless debates and exchanges provoked by this book it seems
to us that a new wisdom for the long term was essential. People no longer joke about the power
struggles and many of our rivalries that plague our planet. Everyone must be mindful the consequences
of a hatred left to rot on the other side of the world just because there was no immediate interest
to keep a rich country there. However over there in that other world where the unthinkable emerge
were educated and fanatical young boys became capable of flying planes in large buildings in
that part of the world what has changed nothing or very little. Certainly there's a plethora of
military options underway to destroy the terrorist camps certainly the contemptible Taliban regime
has been disintegrated having benefited from far too long for the benevolence of some western
quarters in the generosity of oil companies evidently even in the middle of Afghan mountains the
private or powerful political and financial connections their one time allies now rectifying
their mistakes the masters of the country became once again masters of their goats. With the
spectacle of the fall of the Taliban and the barbarian of the final trap del Qaeda Legion
in Afghanistan a conviction ceases us we witnessed the rightful vengeance inflicted on this
rabble and still not quite how does one erase that vision almost burlesque of the head of the Taliban
mullah Omar saving himself that is running away from a city on a simple mohid in a country that
had been for several weeks under the control of western allies the executors of low deeds have
been routed but their pay masters remain unpunished who are they Islamic bankers located in the
United Arab Emirates those chief clerics installed as the ruling spiritual powers in Saudi Arabia
who's in trees we described several Saudi princes close to the world palace who's hidden
alliances we devolved those in charge in Pakistan eager to promote a strong Sunni regime on the other
side of the border in particular the ball truth ugly but undeniable is that Arabic peninsula that
is home to the main supply of oil reserves consumed by the industrialized nations is the power
rest in the hands of dictators of the sands whose pension for nepotism and jerman takwisay guaranteed
us 50 years of reliable and easily corruptible middlemen who are able to fill their coffers on our
fuel purchases and their arms acquisitions in the region these amirs and kings that keep their
people in a permanent state of submission fear have always held up the korean to legitimize their
position and have always been prepared to compromise with the most radical clerics to ensure that no
one dislodges from their palaces here they are now acting shocked and surprised to learn that one
of the their faithful soldiers or one of these mullahs Osama bin Laden has behind the new world
disorder that's ovexes they're which western partners it's the mesh of these secretive
relationships it's the influence of religious extremists in those countries in which the health
of our trade rests it's our willful blindness before those sovereigns whose very archaism the
bases islam it's the inconsistency of them financing the radical aims throughout the world through
foundations aided by the petro dollars we throw at them these are the realities that explain in
depth the growing power of Osama bin Laden at the same time they bring to light the irresponsibility
of what euphemistically we call in our country parallel diplomacy as if to convince ourselves that
mistedes that the mistedes that are necessarily incorporates remain parallel to our concerns
that one should not be confused with the other herein lies our mistake 237 votes on our pool today

by John Charles Bissar and Guillaume Desquay I mean it's no Eddie is a douchebag but it's the best
I can do today the prologue says the interview took place at the Oak Bar in the New York class
of hotel a place is dark and austere as the lives of those who behind the scenes are leading the
fight against terrorism in late July 2001 I met with John O'Neal on business O'Neal was the
former head of anti terrorism in the U.S. who become deputy director of the FBI's New York office
in charge of national security at the age of 49 after having dedicated half his life to the FBI
he joined the New York flagship office a position covered by coveted by FBI agents we had first
met a month earlier in Paris a group of French anti terrorist experts and I had met with O'Neal
to share information on a kindest financial networks we had dinner at Shabin Waan the lame array
area at the same table occupied not long before by Hillary Clinton Madeline Albright the deputy
director of the direction on Davis surveillance they twer whatever that is dst in charge of anti terrorism
and Elaine Marceau the former chief prosecutor of the terrorist with a parcade de Paris the highest
prosecution authority in France I gave O'Neal my report to the economic network of the bin Laden
family of which he had heard during the dinner and we agreed to meet in New York the following month
to discuss the report New York had become John O'Neal's territory he knew every nook and cranny
from the historic stake houses to the china club from little Italy to the bars frequented by movie
stars and film directors following him through the city one would think he owned the place he was
welcomed everywhere as a friend he was also never off duty constantly juggling his cell phone and
palm pilot as if to remind himself of his central mission accompanying him on his rounds was also
an opportunity to discuss our business together John O'Neal was a rebel in a world where the
president and his administration called the shots in charge of investigating active terrorism by
the al-Qaeda organization he went to Yemen in October 2000 after the attack on the west's
school in which 17 U.S. servicemen died he lambed the obstructionist attitude of young American
among American diplomats there and of course the investigation became clear that diplomats from
the state department FBI investigators didn't share the same approach the diplomats wanted to
comply with the eminite regime in order to calm political relations while the FBI wanted to solve
the crime and find those responsible for the attack as quickly as possible it was apparent that
these two visions these two cultures could not coexist after another dispute over the FBI agents
carrying of arms and turning over second level suspects to the American authorities the American
ambassador to Yemen Barbara Bo-Deen for bad John O'Neal and his team of rambos as the eminite
authorities called them from entering Yemen this despite the fact that according to O'Neal the FBI
had in hand all of the evidence needed to implicate Osama bin Laden's terrorist network in the attack
sitting in the china club at the top of building overlooking Manhattan John O'Neal recounted
that he did exchange with the American ambassador his disappointment in the state department's
impotence feigned or not and above all the threat of Osama bin Laden for him everything originated
in Saudi Arabia and everything could be explained and solved through this prison all of the answers
all of the clues allowing us to dismantle Osama bin Laden's organization can be found in Saudi Arabia
he told me emphasizing the inability of American diplomacy to get anything out of King Fod
concerning terrorist networks the reason there was only one corporate oil interests could this
single explanation keep the US from investigating one of the principal terrorist networks in the world
yes for the simple reason that the American administration had refrained from using the investigation
as a means of putting pressure on its Saudi friends since George W's election the FBI was even
more politically engaged O'Neal said and that could be felt even on his own investigations regarding
bin Laden Saudi Arabia has much more pressure on us than we have toward the kingdom he said
considering the US's dependency on its oil and thus the state department need to have a secure
and stable Saudi Arabia during investigations of the attack on a military installation in Dharan on
June 25th 1996 which killed 19 American soldiers O'Neal went to Saudi Arabia himself to convince King Fod
to get the Saudi authorities to cooperate but that was a lost cause because Saudi officials
interrogated the principal suspects themselves while the FBI was relegated collecting material evidence
from the bomb site as for the relations between Al-Qaeda and Saudi Arabia the conclusions of my report
which was commissioned by the French intelligence service did not surprise O'Neal and confirmed
that bin Laden had close ties with high ranking personalities and families of the Saudi kingdom in July
2001 contrary to their public statements he believed however that the chances of getting the
Saudi to cooperate were slim and he called into question the FBI's extremely political stance
in this area as well as that at the interior level coming from one of America's top specialists
in these matters John Neal's revelation shed light on the potential danger of O'Neal and
they tell us in clear terms that the fighting against terrorism was not the government's number one
priority was certainly it was essentially out of resentment and because he knew that nothing
would change his strong beliefs that O'Neal left the FBI in August 2001 to take position as
director of security at the World Trade Center on September 11th he was meeting on the subject of
security in the twin towers when the first plane at the building he left a call for help and
coordinate the arrival of the police before going back into the building he had evacuated the
occupants as if to save the thousands of New Yorkers who were so dear to him he died in the effort
John O'Neal's testimony continues to be an essential piece of the puzzle in the fight against
terrorism it shed light on the two principal stumbling blocks for the Western confronting these
networks oil and its geographic strategic importance and Saudi Arabia and its religious and
financial ambitions 1128 at 560 W2 QYM Mattress shopping forget about it don't leave the house just

It's like something you've seen before.
Oh, boy.
Some of mom's got rid of it.
What are you going to do?
Eat the great Satan's and that's a haunt.
Um, no, Bob.
Uh, just build up my strength for the jihad.
I see you.
Stop building up and stop blowing up there.
When the son of a jackal gets the son of his own,
he'll larity ensues on Al-Kaeda in the family.
Only on Al-Jazeera TV land.
So you notice the sheriff says that they were uncooperative.
No struggle, but they weren't cooperative.
Didn't want to give me any information, but they're not suspects.
They're not suspect at this time, which is why they got the bomb robot going into the second car now.
Because they're not suspects.
Okay, Cliff Gorman, you wonder who he was?
Okay.
Because you guys didn't find out for me.
But it's just as well.
Because then I wouldn't have done a search on here.
Cliff Gorman, he was an actor, played a bit parts.
TV, you guys, the parents, is law in order.
He was on law in order a bunch of times.
New York news, murder, she wrote, which I don't want.
Spencer for hire.
See, if we saw Cliff Gorman, you know, if we saw a picture,
oh, yeah, that's Cliff Gorman.
Don't you think?
Yeah, sure.
No, we wouldn't.
And the movie, he was in King of the Jungle,
Ghost Dog, the war of the samurai, uh, 60s, the 60s,
down came a blackbird.
Oh, he was in a lot of movies, a lot of bit parts.
Uh, forget me not, the, forget me not murders,
the return of iron sight.
Oh, most of these were TV movies.
Huffa.
Why was it a good movie?
Did you see that movie?
No.
Who was in that movie?
I don't know.
God, I think, uh, wasn't Robert the hero in that movie?
Okay.
Well, anyway, it was a good movie.
Uh, you didn't see the movie, Huffa?
No, I didn't see that.
It was excellent.
A night in the city, Tehran Track 9,
Prestige of Honor, it said, well, there you go.
Okay, that takes care of that.
He's a, but he's not, I don't know, he's small potatoes.
You don't put him up there with Kim Hunter with Johnny and I just do you?
You don't know that category?
No.
I don't think so.
No way.
Okay, explosion of chemical plant near Houston, Texas.
South Florida today.
We will have more on that just ahead.
Yeah, okay.
So there's some pictures on CNN.
While we're still trying to find out more about what's going on on the alligator rally,
which is still closed, by the way.
Now we can get lightened up a little bit.
Get to some of these other stories now that I finished reading
8,000 pages from that book.
I'm serious.
I need oxygen.
But I just think that that book is, uh, you know,
of course they're going to be skeptics out there.
Oh, there we go again.
It's not just anti-bush, it's anti-clinton.
It's anti-al the corruption of the, and the whole thing,
OIL.
That's what it's all about, baby.
OIL, MO, NEY.
And I'm sitting here thinking about that scene in the movie Network.
Boy, that petty Cheryewski.
He was one of the most brilliant people of our time.
That movie was so, so far ahead of its time, like 30 years ago.
And Robert Duval is screaming about the Saudi deal.
And of course Howard Veele gets on television.
I want you to call the White House right now.
And he goes to that...
I'm as mad as hell!
I'm as upset as I think this anymore!
Oh!
The Saudi deal's got to be stopped.
Right now, of course, they had all the loans where the Saudis,
and all of that, Robert Duval, is moaning and groaning at the bar there,
and pushing the bartender to punk aside to see the thing on TV.
And he's having nervous breakdown.
Because the Saudis basically were taking control over, uh,
over the UBS, which at that time was the other big network.
Remember that?
Yeah.
You didn't see network.
No.
Why is wrong with you, man?
No wonder you were living in that little tiny world of yours with your Guile Baron,
your goddamn double baked beans or whatever they call that.
Yummy.
Refried beans.
Oh, God.
What are your crap in your brains?
You're blaming it on shoneys.
Let's see, you're running spots for Calvary Church.
You have to be kidding.
What does that mean?
I have no clue, but there's two factors on that.
Calvary Church?
Oh, there it is.
It's Calvary Chapel.
Well, don't ask me.
It's probably Adam Taranigan.
You know, Adam, if it's not a cult, it's some kind of a church.
I have no idea what that is.
Okay?
I've got nothing to do with that.
I don't listen.
I'm busy doing stuff here during the breaks.
And I'm supposed to worry about what the recorded spots are.
Hey, it's QAM, guys.
We'll put anything on here.
If somebody will pay us, we don't give a crap what it is.
If the guy they malchite would buy some spots we take their money.
We don't care.
We're bunch of grave robbers.
Here's another one.
I knew you can't talk about this.
What the hell?
I don't know.
I know it's not Bokobrine, behind me.
Bokobrine's not doing this spot.
Maybe he started a cult.
Oh, brother, there's so much stuff coming on here.
You guys will have to wait till Monday.
I'll get to all of this stuff.
Okay?
And they expect me to be sitting here listening to the guy named recorded spots.
Although I did hear that one spot that keeps cutting in and out,
which I think he just played it again.
I don't know which one that is.
You know the one I mean?
Yeah, that club.
Yeah, boy, the audio keeps cutting out.
And the same thing.
We don't care.
It's life.
There wasn't a purpose.
That's intentional, I believe.
It is?
Yeah.
Well, I don't want to say that it's stupid,
but it sounds pretty stew- it's annoying.
Sounds like there's a glitch, especially on this station,
where we're so used to having that happen and thinking,
oh, there we go again.
More technical screw-ups, because we got that crappy equipment,
although we do have the audio vault.
That was an effect.
I see.
Well, it sure affected me.
Here's something that might affect you.
By the way, how's that pool coming?
292 votes were approaching 300.
Who do you think is the most dangerous person in the world today?
Yes, your almaphart.
At least in double digits now, he's got 11,
but he's been sucking wind in last place all day.
Ariel Shiroin 17, the Pope 31.
Osama Yamama 42, Saddam Hussein 85.
He's getting close, and George W106.
Levi's trousers protect your testicles.
Oh!
Now, where did this come from?
Do we know?
I don't know what the publication is from,
but what differences do they make because it's so enlightening?
Levi's trousers introduce a new range of slacks
with mobile phone anti-radiation pockets.
The trousers will be introduced next year in the UK
under the company's docker's brand,
and could cost as much as 100 pounds
at 140 bucks a pair.
The phone pockets are lined with special material,
which Taylor's able to prevent radiation
from phones reaching the skin.
140 bucks a pair.
Of course, the company isn't saying that radiation
from mobile phones is dangerous or anything.
No, no, no.
It says it's merely responded to customer concerns
about radiation emissions from mobile phones.
And since the slacks also have some waterproof coating
as well and come in different colors,
that's colors with a U, and sizes no doubt.
In May, the UK government published a report
which found that some mobile phones,
shields can significantly reduce exposure to radiation.
Test on some products found that many of the shields
are devices can reduce exposure to radiation by large amounts.
However, any reduction is often linked to a similar reduction
in mobile phone performance leading to a weaker signal,
which can lead people to be shouting more to be heard.
Well, I'm sure you wouldn't mind shouting a little less
if you're protesting your nuts.
Speaking of nuts, Nick Nolte charged with the U.I.
He's got a little problem.
A drooling, droopy eyed Nick Nolte was arrested on suspicion
of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol Wednesday.
After police allegedly spotted his black 1992 Mercedes vans
swirving across a Malibu highway.
An officer making a traffic stop on the Pacific Coast Highway
heard tire squealing and saw the vehicle driven
by Nolte approaching rapidly,
weaving across all lanes into opposing traffic
set California Highway Patrol spokesman, Leland Tang.
When he pulled over, Nolte, who plays the heroin-addicted
robber and is upcoming move with the good thief,
seen completely out of it, Tang.
Said he was drooling with droopy eyes.
He looked very much like he was under the influence.
According to the AP, Nolte's 60,
Monday failed a field sobriety.
Test remain at custody till about 8.30 p.m. Wednesday.
At which time he was cited and released.
Kind of like a bet on guiding light.
Oh, by the way, Mondays today guiding light goes to 10 o'clock
in the morning.
We're going to have to tape it.
God damn it.
Just when it's getting pretty intense, too, dammit.
Man.
And when Michelle is co-zing up the bill now,
the boyhood girlhood, Chummers,
whatever the hell they were, they're starting to get a little bit tight.
And when Ed is starting to co-ze up the Cassie a little bit, huh?
Getting pretty tense, isn't it?
He was extremely puzzling and cooperative, Tang.
Said apparently there were even a few passives by,
and one of the passives by stopped and took pictures.
The actors, publicists, Arnold Robinson,
had no media comment.
Can't imagine why.
Pouring out fit, bitch for an Amster.
An Adult Entertainment Media Company
wants to buy these song swapping service Napster
and has offered more than $2.5 million worth of its stock
for the Now DeFunked Company that's with an N.
Private Media Group, Inc., a publicly traded adult entertainment site
based in Spain, offered a million shares for Napster's assets.
Shares of Private Media, which distributes its adult media content
directly and through a network of local affiliates
and independent distributors, ended yesterday's session
at $2.41 on NASDAQ.
In a statement, Private Media says
I want to use the Napster trademark to offer millions of adults
while the ability to swap adult-oriented content for free.
And at the same time, again, access to top quality content
at a reasonable price.
That sounds appealing, don't it?
See, they're both on it already.
They're both looking for it.
Private Media claims to own the largest library of adult-oriented content
in the world with global copyrights to the content.
And Napster, which had once had a cult following
of some 60 million, was forced to show it down last year
after major record labels commits to federal drugs
and violated copyright laws.
And after used a networking technology called Peer to Peer,
which allows users to share a file.
$156 at $5.60 WQM can't wait for that.
The meantime, all we have is Cliff Gorman.

Rarsha ready to attack Georgia.
I went on the channel seven new website during the break
to see if they had like a more complete story on the thing on the alley.
And lo and behold, here's this story.
Early in the show, I read a thing about Russia and a punetang
and bush making a tit for tat on Iraq and Georgia.
Rarsha ready to attack Georgia, it says.
Rarsha's military is ready to launch attacks in Georgia to flush out
Chechen militants, believe to be based in a remote mountainous region,
defense minister Sergei Ivanov, on Thursday.
What team does he play for?
Georgia's been under Russian pressure for months to take action against militants
and the Pankisi gorge, but it's probably a quip military,
which has only about 17,000 men, has launched only one operation
which produced few results, the detention of 13-led criminals
and once suspected Arab militants.
The pressure increased yesterday with a release of details of a letter,
President Poon Tang sent the world leaders outlining Russia's complaints
about Georgia's inaction and asserting Russia's right to launch attacks
in line with the UN Charter in training countries to self-defense.
The Georgian parliament sent a statement yesterday to the UN,
NATO and other international organizations saying that Poon Tang has placed
in front of Georgia the threat of aggression.
Evenov, meanwhile, told reporters, specific attack proposals
would be presented to Putin in the near future.
He said such strikes may not be needed if Georgia takes appropriate measures
the Interfax News Agency reported.
How do you like that?
Says the Russian attack could trouble relations with the US,
American troops have been based in Georgia since May,
given giving anti-terrorism training to the Georgian military.
However, however, it says the timing of Putin's letter to world leaders
coming as the UN General Assembly with the President Bush make his case
for military action against Iraq, indicated Putin wants to draw parallels
between the Russia, Georgia and the US Iraq disputes.
Russia has vehemently opposed any unilateral action by the US against Iraq
and it's unclear if the Kremlin would abandon its objections
if the US gave tacit approval to one of the South in Georgia.
How do you like that?
Like that story I read earlier.
Probably a lot of people out there saying, oh yeah, that's just a bunch of propaganda, right?
Right.
Have handed in what they say is their identity.
All of that men of Georgia and Pakistani and their weight in descent.
They have been provided.
I do like that.
That two are naturalized US citizens.
One is a US citizen.
But they're saying use the words appear to be Kelly because we could find out that this documentation is fake.
There's always that possibility.
So 99% sure we're okay here but there's always that 1% chance that this is these are fake documents.
And yes, they were medical students according to a variety of officials that I spoke to today and they were in school.
Not here in the United States but in Dominica in the Caribbean.
And I was also told by a US official that it appears that they were on their way to a medical conference in Miami.
At least that is a story that I didn't told them and they're corroborating.
There's no specific information linking these individuals to any terrorist activity.
That's why their names are not being released.
That is why there are no charges brought.
They are being held for questioning at this point.
That is it.
They are not being as you said and very important to underscore here not being called suspects or being held at the suspect.
Nobody is ever a suspect.
Come on, quick kid enough.
Okay.
I say we fry them all just you know let's rev up all sparky one more time and fry the three of them just to be on the safe side.
Something that's going to be safe and sorry that's what John Akscroff says let's fry them.
Right.
Sounds good to me.
Voters be trade.
This was an editorial in yesterday's hero which I never got around to.
What a mess.
And by the way I should point out before I read this.
Janet Reno is playing hardball baby.
She's got the big hard balls out and she says hey just hang on a minute cowboy.
Let's recount some votes here.
Whole bunch of votes in day that didn't get counted allegedly.
I think a whole bunch of dead people are still trying to get the vote.
So let's wait and be sure and make sure that everybody got their fair chance to vote.
So if we can try to make up those 8100 votes.
Oh it's so sad.
What a mess.
In the first day why votes into the 2000 presidential election.
We in South Florida have embarrassed ourselves again says the hero.
We completely bought an important election while the nation watched.
Counties throughout the state reported some problems but the most severe and damaging occurred in date and brown.
Wow.
Simply put there was no excuse.
None for what happened to day and scores of our polling places.
Some precinct openings were delayed for hours.
Poll workers weren't familiar with new touchscreen computers.
Precincts closed before the extended 9pm deadline.
Computer voting cartridges were misplaced.
Both were erased.
Poll workers quitted and chew up.
Voters returned away.
Party identification cards were in short supply.
Voters were denied or no vote meant.
That was on the OK rights referendum.
In short most of what could go wrong did go wrong in these two counties.
Blame this in blame for this inexcusable electoral meltdown must go to the county election supervisors.
Whose primary responsibility is to plan and organize elections.
It might be argued and probably will be that the state failed to give county supervisors enough resources to guarantee a relatively error.
For election but that would just be a lame excuse.
After the 2000 election debacle state lawmakers passed new laws that dealt with some of the more egregious problems discovered in punch card validating.
Florida also allocated $20 million for new electronic voting systems, modernizing voting in every county.
Elections supervisors may assert correctly that they didn't get all the money they requested.
But the mandate from lawmakers and voters was resoundingly clear.
No more screw ups.
Proof that doing the job is possible was evident in the performance in other counties across the state.
In populous Hillsborough County for example, election supervisors worked out kinks in the new touchscreen system with a trial run involving thousands of computers and voters.
In Pasco County poll workers would have been 12 hours of training on procedures and new equipment compared to four hours in date.
Four hours in date.
Data officials say they were hampered by last minute changes in computer software applications which left little time for training in Broward election supervisor Miriam Olafant.
As battle incessantly with county commissioners about funding and voting machinery.
Wednesday, Miami Mayor Alex Pingapakain you called for a fact finding investigation by the county's inspector general.
It will be overseen by an independent civilian panel.
The inspector general should quickly analyze what went wrong and why and make recommendations that can be implemented before the November general election in Broward.
Miss Olafant called for a similar process.
Both are worthy efforts that can prevent a recurrence albeit after the fact.
Obviously the focus of Broward and data officials must be to prevent a similar disaster in November.
Obviously, nevertheless, the harm done to voters in the primary election is unforgivable.
Few activities that citizens participate in or as critical to democracy is voting yet thousands of voters have been disenfranchised by officials lack of planning and poor organization.
This debacle is an unconsumable betrayal of all self-vote voters.
How do you like that?
The self-righteous up and a hero says and they're absolutely right.
Unconsumable, unacceptable, appala crap is what it was.
You can smell it a million miles away. I can smell it all the way up here.
See if they've had or Josh Friedman's in a building again.
Is he still there, by the way?
Yeah.
Well, let me ask you one, they may sound ridiculous. Let me ask you one question about that.
Why?
Yeah, why?
I don't know.
Well, they had to have somebody on MSNBC, I guess.
Anyway, it's 11 past noon at 5.60.
You and the men, these three men of Jordanian, Pakistani and Iranian descent.
They may have no connection to any formal terrorist group who may just be sympathizers to a cause or may just think you know what?
Or maybe not.
Quick conjecturing already.
They may be this.
Let us know when you got something.
I realize you asked, well, there's got a lot of time to fill on there.
And the picture of the two cars sitting there on a goddamn alley isn't really all that exciting.
And even they are a little robot.
The bomb-sniffing robot there isn't all that exciting anymore.
Even the dogs were, they ran out.
Do you know what that is?
The bomb-sniffing dogs, they took off.
They said, what's for lunch?
Let's get out of here.
Here's the guy that's always ready for a good lunch.
Tom Laman and Helen Pontiac GMC.
And they added again down there are good friends one more time.
Zero percent financing continues.
That's right, with a proof credit from GMAC, you can get right now as I speak.
Zero percent financing of the 36 month on all, 2003 Pontiac and GMC models.
And of course, the fact that they slipped out into this coffee means the 2003 Pontiac and GMC's.
Oh!
Are here.
Or take a rebate of up to 4 grand and all 2002 Pontiacs or GMC models in stock.
Check out the complete line of GMC SUVs, including that very exciting spiffy envoy,
voted by now, you should know by now, voted by Motor Trend is the SUV of the year.
And check out the all new Pontiac 5 SUV.
It's a real gas ghost.
I mean, it's got the power of a sports car at a fraction of the price.
Helen's also got a great selection of dependable pre-owned cars, trucks and SUVs.
And if some other clown in town turned you down for credit when you tried to buy a car,
forget about that.
Forget about that place because Halib Pontiac will find some way to work your deal.
So if you want an unbeatable deal on Pontiacs and GMC's, this is always the place.
And when you go down there, you'll discover why they've been went and business in the same place for so long
because they treat you right and they make an unbeatable deal.
134 or 136, Ohio, that's the US one across from the falls, open every day seven days a week.
Halib Pontiac GMC, we are professional grade.
My, my, and local, this is 4205-60, E-way-2-A-M.
Holy cow, Aaron's coming.
Hi, I'm Jeff Bush and I'm just like all of you out there, except I'm rich.
Very, very rich.
I've got more money than any of you will ever see in your whole life,
without ever having to earn a penny of it like you four losers have to do.
But hell, we co-op running against, so why not vote for me?
You know, I'm so rich I paid the Jewish journal to back me.
Boy, even for a rich spoiled kid like me, that's it me back abundant.
I want to be your governor for the same reason a dog licks his balls because I can't.
I want to relate to the little guy, like people who have to do their own shopping, things like that.
Difficult for me because I'm rich.
So let's work together to build a better Florida.
Vote for me, Judd Bush.
Because I'm rich.
I've heard my little devil come in and do it like Jeff Bush, think I...
217 and 560 W.
Here, what's the guy Cliff Gorman, right?
Right, never heard of him.
I almost forgot his name, so he just doesn't qualify.
But over the weekend, I'm sure that we got like a long weekend, not a long weekend,
but we've got the rest of today and tomorrow on Sunday.
We can find some of their famous, famous person who can complete the trilogy.
Do we have like a time limit on what period they have to die in?
I guess like within a couple of days.
Final show, Church allowed five priests to continue work despite many allegations.
Newly released personnel files of five priests show they are signs of Boston
who was told about numerous allegations of sex abuse against the priest,
some dating back four decades, but allowed the priest to continue in parish work.
Oi!
The documents made public yesterday detail multiple allegations against the Reverend Robert V. Gale,
who was arrested last month for allegedly raping a boy in the Church rectory.
At St. Jude's parish in Waltham over four years prior to the 1980s,
when the boy was 10 to 14 years old.
The documents also describe allegations made against the Reverend's John Atwater, Richard Coglin.
I guess they used to call him Father Coglin.
George J. Rosencrant and Joseph Welch.
Many of the allegations are contained in correspondence sent to three church supervisors,
Bishop John McCormick of Manchester, New Hampshire, and it goes on.
The documents were obtained by attorneys who represented approximately 250 people
who claimed they were abused by priests.
There were a number of occurrences with the knowledge of the supervisors of the Archdiocese
going back pretty far, and yet they don't remove the priest at Attorney Jeffrey Newman.
The records when you look at them as a group are really quite profound
in detailing this specific factual basis on which they could have taken them out of the purses
and put them where they would have had no contact with children or simply retired them.
Donna Maurissi, Rhymes Wood Cissy, the spokeswoman for the Archdiocese,
whose name was heard eight million times in the last few months,
didn't immediately return phone calls and wasn't for comment.
We can't imagine why.
She's busy old Donna.
Editorial, and yesterday's Palm Beach Post, even angrier than the hero, I believe,
or at least equally pissed off, Florida became the unruly guest at Wednesday's National Funeral
while Americans observed moments of silence, visited places of worship,
pretended memorial services, and otherwise paid tribute to the Democratic feedums
that separate the U.S. from those who would destroy it.
Florida looked once again like the stumble bomb state that can't get democracy right.
There was somebody, if I can interrupt this, there was somebody last night,
I think, on a hard ball with Chris Matthews.
I don't remember who the guest was, but he was saying,
oh yeah, he said, you know, things that the election in Florida went pretty well,
at least as compared to any other Latin American country.
Oh, yeah.
I mean, we've been getting every shot, and of course, we don't care anymore,
because we're used to it.
I mean, you know, we can't shame us.
Well, I Greg Reed.
A signing blame the Palm Beach Post says, however, is not as easy as it might seem.
Obviously, election supervisors in Broward and Dave counties get a large portion.
David Leahy, one of the day charterer, is appointed by the County Commission,
has done the job since 1981.
Oh, why we have no idea.
Miriam Allefant was elected two years ago in Broward.
Each hit of normal was coming.
They, in the 65 other supervisors, knew that after 2000,
new coverage and public attention would magnify even normal glitches
in the first major test of a new system.
It is inexcusable, however, when voters can't get to the system.
Dozens of Broward and Dave precincts open late.
Pull workers didn't turn on machines.
We didn't know how to operate them.
Republicans and Democrats got each other's ballots.
Some voters plan to ask for provisional ballots and didn't get them.
In date, some of the affected precincts were in the same African-American neighborhoods
where voters still believe they were disenfranchised,
screwed over in the 2000 presidential election.
If nothing else, chaos to the South-made Palm Beach County,
where problems were minor, look good.
Election supervisor Theresa Lapour was late with complete results, however,
apparently because she didn't use enough of the laptop computers that tabulated votes.
But Governor Bush was wrong to absolve himself and the legislature.
Ultimately, Tuesday's troubles were a factor only in the Democratic primaries for Governor Attorney General,
which happened to be the two major statewide races,
each is very close and neither will win and will get a majority until this year partisan primaries went to a runoff.
As part of Florida's post-2000 election reforms,
the legislature and Governor Bush eliminated partisan runoffs for this year only.
The intent was to hurt any Democratic candidate for governor who might finish this strong second,
and then slain shot the victory in the runoff and game momentum to challenge Governor Bush.
That's how Ruben Asquit and Governor Bob Graham became governor,
and Lawton Charles got to the West Senate.
Add the runoff, and much of this new controversy goes away,
the state would know who's in the runoff, who came in first wouldn't matter.
There'd be no talk among Bill McBride and General Reno's advisors about how they're looking at legal options,
but he dire and Scott Madder's would be gearing up for the chance to go against Charlie Christopher Attorney General, Christ.
We also note that Governor Bush chose to call Tuesday's election shameful because people couldn't vote.
He showed no such outrage in 2000 when many of the same Floridians complained that their votes had been counted.
Then of course, Governor Bush was on the side that didn't want the votes counted.
He won't be wanting counted in November either.
In fairness to Florida, this state has enacted election reform for itself,
while Congress is still arguing over how to do it for the nation.
California's Riverside County, which pioneered the use of touchscreen machines,
had many of the same startup problems, such as workers not turning machines on soon enough,
elections in that county now run smoothly.
Also, there were examples throughout the state that a competent supervisor can run trouble-free elections,
even in large counties.
Hillsborough County, which has 519,000 registered voters, and has the same machines Palm Beach County bought,
had minor issues in the handful of precincts, and all results in were in by 2 a.m. even with a 2-hour extension.
Some changes, though, would help to avoid some of the problems that cropped up this time.
The legislature should require that the once-in-10-year special redistricting sessions
that take place as soon as census information is available, which is roughly 18 months before general election.
New maps this year were in final until barely two months before the primary,
thus forcing tough deadlines in large counties.
To deal with shortage of poll workers, more than 100 in Palm Beach County quit over the weekend,
counties should have to train county employees with the job.
They would be reliable and most would be available on short notice,
and most of them would be out of the age of 200 by the way.
Election supervisor should extend the voting period.
Counties could open limited number of universal polling places at malls,
and courthouses in the previous Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, then open all polling places Tuesday,
or voting could take place Tuesday and Wednesday.
The state could pick up some of the extra expense.
The danger of chronic ballot bungling is that frustrated voters will become cynical non-voters,
with political line drawing making so many races uncompetitive, thus reducing turnout.
The state cannot afford to lose any more people whose participation in politics doesn't turn on
on how much money they contribute.
Writers for Leno and Letterman will thank Florida for new material,
but there's nothing funny about what the state says.
The pissed off Palm Beach Post.
Let's hear it.
It's part of their crappy sports section.
How's the, let's see, U.S. remains on higher alert.
We know that orange alert, and there's the little bomb-sniffing robot.
Other casual nature of the technicians out there.
Authorities expect highway to be close for some time,
so if you're going to go over and try to collect, like an unpaid bill from the beesleaves,
you better fly, okay? Or else just forget about it.
Suggest that indeed the fact that if you try to collect money from the beesleaves,
I'd just say forget about it.
Wouldn't be anywhere near that car.
You're okay, good.
Broward Commissioner, this is in the Sun Central this morning.
Defends Ole Fanth, but urges series of changes.
Like I said, it's in the Sun Central from yesterday.
A Broward Commissioner yesterday.
Well, how's that possible? I guess I must have been overnight.
A Broward Commissioner yesterday came to the defensive and vettel election supervisor,
Miriam Ole Fanth, and urged a series of changes to get her office in the county
through the November, I say fire her ass right now.
Oh!
Okay. And David Leahy, both of them.
If it's somebody in there with a half of brain,
who's going to do things right, we only got like, what is it?
November 5th is how many weeks away.
Not too many.
Twenty, twenty seven, then you got about seven or eight weeks away.
Maybe less than that.
Who the hell are we kidding?
Fire both their ass.
Get somebody in there, get this thing organized.
Get it done right.
Get a bunch of poll workers in there under the age of a thousand.
And let people vote, God damn it.
Black, white, purple in between.
Even a few Republicans, not too many.
There's Spidey Web of Intrigue, stretched from LA to New York to Japan.
But following 18 month investigation,
four stolen Spider-Man costumes,
valued at $50,000 each, and one Batman suit,
valued at 150 grand,
had been recovered.
Thank God.
LA County Prosecutor, say a coin to a report in daily variety.
Aren't you relieved?
Shoot.
God.
That Batman outfit, I bet you that, what's his name?
What's his name?
See, I've got a...
What's Batman?
The one from the TV.
Oh, we don't care about the ones from the movies.
There are too many of those.
They were all bad.
They were, yeah, okay.
Yeah.
That's it.
I've got it.
And I'm wise, thank you.
I thought he said it out loud.
I mean, Bert Ward, I wouldn't forgive, but Adam,
while I was probably hyperventilating,
I'm under a lot of pressure here today, you know?
There's Mark Potter, how's she doing?
And they have to treat it this way.
You've had that conversation with Kelly,
who talked about the same thing,
and this gentleman here underscores that same point,
that they have no choice when they get this kind of information.
People here praise the woman in Georgia for what she said.
They defend.
See that?
Like I said, even though you're picking on her,
give her the congressional medal of honor.
I wasn't picking on her.
Yeah, you were saying some cost-thick thing,
you were saying about her.
You said that Yahoo, bitch, or something like that.
Maybe you just muttered it under your breath.
I heard it.
You heard it.
By the way, they also cut those spider men off, too.
That was in the first sentence,
if you had been paying real close attention.
Oh, see, I missed that.
I was really paying attention.
Yeah, you got to pay real close attention.
Listen, I know you're not fooling me that when I'm doing these shows
from remote locations, from here in Amsterdam,
and around the world, in the Yannemsville.
I know that you guys have been there playing part cheesy
and screwing around.
We're playing life.
Probably, you know, chasing Doreena around the room.
1226 at 560, WQA.
I was going to say I can get even with you,
but I think I just did.

954-788-2660.
My name is Luke.
This is 430560.
You weigh 2A.
Dear Fred, be very afraid.
John, you have been a star for more than 25 years.
I have been asking you for 25 years today.
You never want to why today.
What am I doing right?
Well, I just feel that when you get a lot of offers,
you want to do them.
So you really think it was meant to be?
Oh, very much so.
Look at this.
I'm feeling her breath.
What I can tell you is what I observed to be true.
At first glance, this is a border on gruesome at the moment.
I cry for you.
For you is the only.
If they more accept number 11.
This is young.
Is your real proudiness done from Rodeart, who eats the chonies?
They said they had attended a party in Chicago,
the night before,
and that they needed to quit stopping
because they were five hours late.
And then I just naturally, my curiosity, I just kept listening,
and something else was said.
They were kind of huddled together there
over the booth talking.
And then one guy said,
do you think that will bring it down?
And I looked at my son,
and we were just looking at each other.
And he said, well, if that don't bring it down,
I have contacts.
I'll get enough to bring it down.
And to me, that meant they were planning to blow up something.
And as you listen to the words there of a unison,
the woman who called authorities about a possible terrorist attack
on the US, we take you live to the scene where...
Now we don't want to go to the scene.
Delta flight to Miami-C and I just reported
it has been diverted.
Did you hear that?
Yes, I saw that.
Yeah.
Did they say where it was coming from or anything else?
No, I just say it was diverted.
Okay, well, you know, they're unhightened alert in your area.
Aren't you glad that you're there and I'm here, by the way?
Yeah, really glad.
Hey, listen, they're under heightened alert, the port,
and all, you know, just to be on the safe side,
because this thing on the alley could be the beginning of a plot that they're, you know, uncovered.
And certainly, if there were some kind of a plot, there wouldn't just be three gypsies,
you know, driving down from Calhoun County, Georgia.
You thought I would have said?
Yes.
So everybody's like under heightened alert.
And of course, you got the proper stormers on the way,
and you got the election to still hang it up in the air.
Like I said, being here is not so bad.
Green's band sees depressing effects.
Oh, I'll tell you one thing.
He was speaking yesterday and you watched that marketer...
It was incredible.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress yesterday that depressing effects on the American economy
still linger from the terror attacks on the stock market's steep plunge.
But Greenspan rejected Democrats' suggestions that President Bush's future attacks had to be deferred
because of the return to federal deficits.
Economic fallout from the terrorist attacks on the huge drop in stock prices is still being felt
as the economy tries to make a full recovery from last year's recession.
Greenspan told the House Budget Committee as stocks were in a freefall while his lips moved.
Today's economy appears to have stood the set of blows well,
although the depressing effects still linger and continue to influence
and particularly the federal budget outlook he said.
For the federal budget, the outlook has moved from black to red ink,
projections of a decade of surplus into $5.6 trillion have been replaced with estimates
of a return to sizable deficits over the next several years.
And the dog clearly alerted in the opinion of his handler at the case where he gets false profits.
Now it has been designated.
And it won't be like a fallout this year.
We've deleted the false positives we've deleted while we may be from residents
and you can't see it like that.
And the manuals are clear.
You didn't have to find that.
I'm not a bomb technician.
I sent either one of those issues.
Now let me ask you this.
Is 46, 7 or 10 like I'm sure?
Because it's a new hour anyways, like the general news time for some of them.
Are they on top of this thing?
Because maybe we'll get further up there.
Because they seem to be hell-bent on CNN and put on it.
And just hanging out there on the alley and talking to the same people,
this piccolo guy over and over and over again.
And the other one car ran through the tool booths without paying the tool,
which was really brilliant.
And it said them and so on.
All these things we already know about.
Is there anything on the other channels?
Well, the time channel four.
Yeah.
I don't have channel seven.
Why do you keep saying that?
How come channel seven not here?
No.
It's not on the truck.
Are there anything on seven?
Seven is the same thing.
They're showing a picture of the two cars with the cute little robot,
you know, picking around in there.
It is a cute little robot.
But even a robot turned tail a little while ago and said,
hey enough of this crap, I'm getting down to here.
Even a robot's getting fed up.
Because they're not finding much of anything.
But they did find the Islamic writing.
But of course, it really shouldn't be too surprising.
If one guy is from Iran, one guy is from Iraq,
and the other from Pakistan.
The fact they found papers with Arabic writing in the cars,
I don't think it's like a major revelation.
You see what I'm saying?
In other words, if the three guys were Chinese and they found Chinese writing,
it probably wouldn't be a big surprise.
But nevertheless, they're going, blah, blah, blah.
I like to find out more about the Delta flight where it was coming from,
why it was divergent, where it went to.
That's what I like to find out more about.
But we'll have to wait until they're going to be ready to tell us.
And as soon as they do, we'll tell you.
Murder charge in Timberlake fan depth.
This is a grotesque story we had the day.
They're George's trying to make fun of, by the way.
A couple of days ago.
Yeah, that was crazy.
That was terrible, George.
A motorist has been sure, that's probably why he got sick,
because God was punishing him.
Oh, God.
A motorist has been charged with murder for allegedly hitting a woman
who was waiting outside a radio station.
The group of fans to see pop star Justin Tinkerbell.
Cameron Albert Dutie.
21 was charged Wednesday with one kind of murdering Ann White, 21.
He remained jailed on a million dollars bail pending a September 26th
of Raymond in Superior Court.
I think his punishment they should like make him sleep with Justin Tinkerbell
for a few weeks, and then fries ass.
White was standing on the sidewalk outside the studios of Kiss FM
in neighboring Burbank, Monday night.
When a pickup backed up and hit her, the woman was pinned out of the truck
which then went forward and dragged her about a block police said,
Dutie was stopped about a block away by police.
Police said Dutie didn't know the woman apparently did not attend the hitter, right?
Not like backing up into a crowd.
The radio station was hosting a special late night interview with Tinkerbell.
The instinct, singer, is promoting his upcoming solo album.
Aren't you going to go out and buy that right away?
I'm leaving right now.
Yeah, if you're leaving right now, it's not because of the album,
because you're getting panicky.
Don't get panicky now, okay?
What is this?
Yeah.
What is this invoice you just sent me?
An invoice?
Outlet store purchase order.
Or you know something?
This is an ad.
Can you believe this?
This is the first time this has happened on my fax up here.
Here's an ad, like you get them at home on your fax all the time.
I don't know if you do, but I sure do.
Yeah, sure.
Outlet store purchase order from some joyed in British clients, Surrey BC.
Well, stick that up your ass, baby.
Purchase this, you idiot.
How do you like that in the middle of this important radio show?
And I hear the fax machine puking over here, and I assume maybe it's something very urgent
or important or not as the case may be, but at least like to have the chance.
And it's an ad.
Jesus, Kate Christ.
Powder and Ohio Tower from nail gun.
This is another bit of nervousness they had the other day.
Well, the substance that was sniffed by bomb detecting dogs,
leading to the evacuation of a state office tower,
was a powder used in nail guns, police said, yesterday.
No nail gun was found in the van where the two dogs detected the powder,
but the company that owns the vehicle often uses 22 caliber nail guns,
with cartridges containing smokeless nitrate powder,
state trooper, Lieutenant Gary Lewis said.
The search into our evacuation of the 41st Surrey James A. Road State Office,
tower, which houses about 4,000 people, came on a first anniversary of the 9-11 attacks.
The evacuation was ordered after a worker said the van's driver told her,
I'm here to hide a bomb.

Sodom who's saying 98.
Osama Yamama 55.
The Pope 35.
Ariel sure owns 17.
And yes, her Amphard is got 15.
He's starting to move up on Ariel and he's probably uncomfortable about it.
It was almost amusing.
You don't want nobody to laugh or cry.
Were you listening to any of the audio from the question answered deal?
A little impromptu press conference with Governor Jebster?

And one of the Goopal reporters who was almost in the state of hysteria.
Governor, what do you want to tell the people at home?
You want to tell them to calm down and just relax?

Just relax.
Okay, I mean, if the world's going to end, believe me, we'll be the first ones to know it.
E-mails allegedly tell more about shoe bomb mission.
Court documents alleged that accused shoe bomber Richard Reed.
Remember him?
Yep.
Lovely looking guy.
Used an email account to plot with an unknown associate and compose a will just to find his mission
in the days before he tried to blow up a jet over the Atlantic.
The email establishes and reads own words.
His expectation that he'll die doing is part of the ongoing war between Islam and disbelief,
prosecutors say, and a brief file late Wednesday in US District Court.
The filing quoted from the emails as they appeared, including misspellings.
The motion in support of the using the emails as evidence and Reed's trial also included portions of two FBI interviews.
In those interviews, Reed told agency picked US target because of military action against the Taliban and Afghanistan
and Israeli treatment of Palestinians.
America is the problem without America.
There would be no Israeli tool agents.
After he was arrested at the Logan International Airport on December 22.
Reed 29 is scheduled to go on trial November 4 on charges that include attempted murder, attempted destruction of an aircraft,
and interfering with the flight crew.
Reed, a British citizen allegedly tried to set off set fire to West Nicarious on American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami.
Airby, peace of craft, story, everything, depressing, everything, morbid, everything, negative, everything embarrassing.
It all comes back to San Florida.
As we know, he was subdued by passengers and flight attendants, taken into custody when the jet was rerouted to Boston,
and of course they took away his matches.
Memo warned priests against meeting kids.
This is in the St. Pete Times today.
In a 1994 memo, while the Vice-East of St. Peter'sburg recently reassured Catholics that it knew of no prior allegations
of sexual misconduct by priests charged in May with sexually abusing boys, but there's always a butt in these stories.
In 1994, the Vice-East discovered the Reverend Robert L. Schaufel had met alone with children and areas where they weren't allowed.
In a November 21, 1994 memo, one of Schaufel's supervisors worried about bringing children to a church rectumry and his room without other adults present.
The memo was released yesterday by panelists and prosecutors after a public records request by the St. Pete Times.
At the same time, Schaufel 54 was assigned to Holy Cross Church in St. Peter'sburg where he served for 10 years ending in July 2001.
His supervisor, my senior John Neff, told him in the memo,
I'm confident that you did nothing more or illegal, but that this action was very important and potentially dangerous for your reputation that of the other priests in the rectumry and all of us.
Officials of the DICC, young priests, have a seminary school race concerns with them after seeing Schaufel bring children to his rectumry.
Maybe it was served in Schufel, I'd buy you.
Thanks so many little piece. Can't hurt.
Two-faced charges in plain diversion, besides the thing in Ohio, this was the other event that took place on Wednesday,
that everybody was like kind of peeing their pants about.
Two airline passengers appeared before a federal magistrate yesterday on charges they interfered with crew members on a flight that was diverted to Fort Smith, Arkansas.
The men around suspicions on Northwest Airlines flight because they ignored,
because one ignored a flight attendant's request to leave a restroom and is traveling companion later insisted on using the same restroom according to an affidavit filed with a complaint.
I remember the story we had the other day said that there were like three of them jammed in there at the same time,
which how do you get three people in the same toilet on a plane?
It's impossible.
I mean maybe three timmies or three Irvey Villesheys possibly, if one of them is standing up on the toilet.
The pilot of the Vegas-bound flight landed in Western Arkansas where the men were detained Wednesday,
flight was from Memphis, Tennessee. Authorities initially said the men were of Middle Eastern descent.
US attorney Tom Gehne said yesterday the men were of Indian descent, one of them a US citizen who were headed to Las Vegas for vacation.
The prosecutor said he could find no ties among the men to any terrorist organization.
The federal magistrate said another hearing next week for the two men grew a deep wander, 48 of Pennsylvania,
and her render sing, 41, maybe no captains sing of Jersey.
They made no statement in court except to answer questions that were returned to jail.
They were appointed attorneys. Two other passengers initially detained were released.
In the affidavit flight attendant Deborah Summers said wander went to the restroom shortly after takeoff.
She went to check on him. Wonder had her shirt off and was shaving with a disposable razor.
She said he ignored four requests to return to with Seat.
Summers said she became a lombard and sing wanted to use the same restroom and she told him it wasn't working the affidavit set.
The flight attendant said she was concerned because she had been trained at an explosive device could be assembled from components carried by separate individuals.
Nice go on sweetheart. Nice go on. Send him back to Bombay or somewhere. Send the Sri Lanka that will teach him.
So evidently they run in a spot now on CNN so we can all take a breath and calm down you think?
We can really cook.
Well no because when I go to a commercial break you know obviously there's not like breaking and impending it.
Yeah if you know what I'm talking about.
We are sports radio feisty UAM.
Friday you first good.
This is former vice president of the United States Al Gore.
I have recently poked my head out of the shadows of oblivion to take pot shots at the president.
I have reappeared much like pucks the tawny fill the groundhog creature that reappears each year to determine whether or not we'll have an early spring.
I wish it to be known but it was I who was responsible for saving the lives of those nine miners in Pennsylvania over the weekend.
I had asked the media to keep my name out of it as not to appear a spotlight hog.
However I feel the American people have a right to know the truth.
Here's what happened. Upon hearing of this unfortunate accident I will race to the scene.
I lowered myself into the mine using an old Ron Popeo pocket fisherman and some bailing wire.
Down down down into the depths of darkness I think.
Never thinking of my own safety but rather of the safety of those men on the ground.
When I reached the miners they said to me hey you're the guy that invented the internet right?
I said yes.
We all had a Mike's hard lemonade which I brought with me down into the hole and then we sat around and reenacted the fart scene from blazing saddles.
How about you should know the truth.
Now much like the groundhog creature pucks the tawny filth I'll flink back into the darkness of oblivion until I am needed again.
This is Al Gore.
Flipper hero.
You know I don't think it was unistone at all I think it was Al.
It was probably Al Gore over her those three scumbags because he probably you'd find him in shoneys.
From 56 at 560 W.com we got the mad dog at one Hank's gonna be longer three.

Marlins on deck 630 is that season just refuses to win.
Marlins in the brave 705.
Edike after baseball and ESPN radio.
Oh are we desperate overnight.
Okay here's the recap honest or in case you were asleep in case you're just wondering let's summarize the whole thing.
Which I think that's a great idea.
Yeah what's going on.
Official shut down to 21 mile section of alligator alley and detained three men and two vehicles early today after an alert about ledge plans to stay
a terrorist attack in South Florida.
Farm sniffing dogs ordered authorities to material in both vehicles but no explosives were immediately found said EJ piccolo of the FDLE.
Explosive charges were used to blast open order to be a backpack taken from one of the vehicles at mile marker 92 near Naples.
No explosives were found in the bag.
The information we have is very specific piccolo said whatever that means.
He said the three people in the two vehicles both with Illinois license plates had not been arrested but were being detained.
They're not suspects.
Bomb experts continue to conduct a careful search of the vehicles that was being broadcast live by CBS for another TV stations and 12 PM officials said one of the two vehicles have been declared clean of any explosives.
This is from the Sun Sentinel website so naturally they're promoting CBS for because that's their partner in crime.
The two bomb squad technicians in hoods and protective blast suits removed the suitcase and plastic bags from one car and searched the interior and trucker robot was also brought in to videotape the car and the atoms in the truck.
The robot was also used to unload some of the atoms in the trunk.
CBS for later tentatively identified the three men as medical students.
They're from Jordan, Pakistan and Iran.
All three are in the country legally.
Two of them are naturalized the TV station be saying.
Also CBS for reported some of the items in the backpack that was exploded were believed to be medical related.
One of the two cars stopped at Black Honda registered to a man in Hanover Park in Illinois, some of them were Chicago.
US law enforcement authorities have been on a heightened alert since Tuesday when the outside identified a high risk of terrorist attack on the anniversary of 9-11.
Early to yesterday, that's wrong.
Oh, that's wrong. It says early Thursday. It was early Friday because it was 1 o'clock this morning.
There is a mistake in the Sun Sentinel.
And probably CBS for too.
Early this morning the FHP shut down a 20-mile stretch of I-75.
Shortly after one of the vehicles were stopped in Karnier County.
It was still almost 12 hours later.
The highway patrol said the road was blocked off from a tool moved east of Naples to state road 29.
A spokesman for the FAA Southern District said some flight restrictions have been imposed over the scene.
There's a temporary flight restriction in place that they request a Carter County Sheriff's Department.
And that is within a three-nautical mile radius of the location in question and below 3,000 feet.
The restriction meant only law enforcement or a criminal in the direction of the Sheriff's Department could fly in the area.
One of the cars stopped to pay the dollar tool County Sheriff Don Hunter said the second did not.
Now why did they keep saying the tool is a dollar? Am I wrong about that?
It used to be a buck when you staffed to pay at both ends but now when you're coming back you don't have to pay the tool when you come east.
You only pay it. Right? You only pay it. I don't know why. I think it's like a buck at a half or two, but whatever it is.
I couldn't be wrong. Wouldn't be the first time in my life. And it's only nitpicking but I just don't understand why they keep saying that.
Anyway, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation had issued an advisory for the cars late yesterday after a woman and her husband stopped either to show
these restaurant in Calhoun County in Georgia and the Northwest from part of that state.
Eunice Stone told police she overheard them at three men in Middle Eastern descent discussing terrorist plans in English and Arabic last night.
Wednesday night the Georgia woman said the men were talking about amounts of explosives and war in the Americans would cry on 913.
She said the men talked in normal levels of the table next to them and listened to a lattice-like structure.
She said she heard them laugh about Americans morning 911 and said she heard other alarming comments including,
well if they're morning 911 what are they going to do about 913? She asked.
So just calm down, relax. Mark Potter, CNN, CBS News Board, the Sun Central, everybody's got it under control and I'm sure the mad dog will scream it all out for you.
Bye bye bye!
