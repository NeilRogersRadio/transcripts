Now the Neil Roger Show on 560 WQAM.
Summer 1990 is the summer of Dick Tracy.
You'll see the movie, listen to the soundtrack,
wear the t-shirt, and read the comic book.
And now, just in time for Father's Day,
you can enjoy the fragrance that was inspired by the movie,
the soundtrack, the t-shirt, and the comic book.
New Dick Tracy Cologne.
Why smell like other guys?
Now you can smell like Dick.
Oh, right.
Never watched his hair or seem to have a car, Kobe.
His name was Kurt.
Now he's pushing up dirt, Kobe.
Oh, right.
Wiping drew from his chin, doing heroin, Kobe.
Nirvana was hot, and now it's Kurt.
They ain't got Kobe.
He got high, said goodbye, then he died.
Kobe.
Made a million an hour, never took a shower, Kobe.
He's a number one hit in Heavens, Big Mach Pit, Kobe.
He'll be Elvis the King, and say grunge with my thing, Kobe.
Kurt.
So with your fill without, don't take Kurt's way out, Kobe.
He got high, said goodbye, then he died.
Kobe.
It is punk yesterday, Luke John Matthew Mark, and whatever Paul Walker, Linde Hut Helder.
He was wearing a Kurt Cobain t-shirt when he arrested him, and he said, yeah, just like that.
I don't want to try to oversimplify anything, but the problem in the world is that there are just too many assholes who don't know right from wrong.
Just basic simple things, like right from wrong.
We're not talking about religion, about the Ten Commandments, because that doesn't seem to be working too well.
Just basic common sense things, you know, like you don't kill people for starters.
You don't put pipe bombs in people's mailboxes, and the best part of the deal is this kid is such a symbol, and in spite of the fact everybody said, oh, he was so sweet and such a wonderful young man.
He told one of the arresting cops that he wanted to, he was trying to put the bombs in a pattern, a pattern of homes and states that when he finished, would resemble a happy face.
Cute. Yeah. A happy face. Yeah.
And they said when he arrested him, he seemed amused and carefree, and if you see the pictures they keep showing on TV every five seconds over and over again, as they're putting them in a car, he like as soon as he sees the cameras there.
Big joke. 21-year-old Simpleton who doesn't know the difference between right and wrong.
Seemed to have an epidemic of that. Last night after the hockey game, nice going there, by the way, Maple Leaf.
What I tell you, Pat, you predicted it yesterday. No, I did not predict that. See you wrong. I said whoever wins a game tonight will win the series. See, you better keep up on these things. Start taking notes. You're going to too many of those baseball games, rotting your mind with that crap with that direct that nobody cares about. But anyway, 6,900 people are last night.
And Pat says there must have really been at least 5,500. And that's pretty damn good on a weeknight.
I can just imagine going to a Panther game and seeing 5,500 people in that arena. You just pee in your pants. It's inconceivable. And nobody there cares about hockey.
So if they're drawn like, you know, they're usual 11 or 12 or 13,000, you can just imagine how many people really care about that baseball team. But it sure takes up a lot of airtime and a station. I'll say that. But anyway, on all the shows, I should point out, except this one, because nobody cares.
So last night on a biography on A&E, they showed that Pam Smart Bitch and those three kids that killed her husband. Yep. And again, I keep thinking to myself. And they show that one, that real ugly one that she was a banging, whatever the hell is name was the one that was 15 when she was banging. At least take somebody that looks good. Okay, Pam, but she didn't. Of course, she didn't look all that good anyway. But she looked like a female Maddie Bell when you come right down to it. And I'm looking at these kids and I'm thinking to myself again. Don't you know the basic difference between right and wrong.
No, you don't kill somebody. I mean, if it's in self defense, if they send you off the ward to kill the enemy, the evil doers, that's one thing. But you just don't kill people. Well, the 10 commandments, the good books said, well, like I said, they've been working too good because all those religious assholes. They've been killing each other since the beginning of recorded time. And of course, CNN breathlessly last night, gave us the word that, oh, that confrontation of standoff and Bethlehem was over. They're going to be coming out any second. And then they were hugging and kissing and oh, yeah, it's all over now. Guess what?
But not a little hang up. See, when you get the Israelis and the Palestinians together, there isn't anything that can't screw up. They could even screw up a Passover sater, even when it's Jesus was at.
So they just couldn't get it right. In fact, you heard it like I told you before the show. There was one voice came from inside that church. And the guy said, just when we thought we were out and you know the rest of that. No, how does it go?
It goes like, yeah, holy crap. We're not getting out. Well, there it's still in limbo. They're still working on that.
So you know, it's amazing to talk about psychic abilities again. The story that you just facts me that somebody sent from CNN about the heresy Irish priest. Yes, I had that was my first thing I had sitting right here. How do you like that?
Oh, shocking. And Irish priest who was repeatedly stating he doesn't believe Jesus Christ with a son of God has resigned.
Anybody out there believe Jesus Christ was a son of God? No, anybody believe those fairy tales? Sure was a snappy dresser though. The resignation of Reverend Andrew Foulong 54.
But this is pretty good right after the Kentucky Derby. But this is only one for long who was facing a church trial for heresy was accepted by church of Ireland Bishop Richard Clark Church official said yesterday. But it church seems to be having a lot of problems.
You know what? A lot of which we've only got about 6,000 of those stories today.
Foulong's been unrepentant in the face of a furor sparked by his controversial views and is restated and repeatedly in emails sent to journalists and articles published on the internet Reuters news agency.
He repeated them again in article for new Irish pages. Journal will be published today. The Irish Times newspaper saved.
Foulong startled worshipers when his unconventional views on traditional Christian teachings were aired in articles published on his website.
I don't believe the traditional understanding of Christmas that God took human form and was born as a babe and Bethlehem. He told Reuters an interview last December.
So what have they gotten all been about about that church anyway? The church and the activity. There was no savior born in that church. In fact, I probably would nobody born in that church.
But they sure have a lot of interesting get-sches with some snappy outfits in that place. Foulong 54 who was ordained in the Anglican Church of Ireland in the early 70s as said he has held his unorthodox beliefs for more than 30 years.
But hadn't shared them previously with his parish news church officials have declined to comment further.
Gee, that line just keeps popping up in every store we get. Everybody's mum. Well, let's see, we had a pool. I told yesterday this was not going to go over that big. They didn't like yesterday's pool.
And you want to know why? What did I tell you? A lot of it was too dated. Yeah.
Hey, are you old far? So I want to talk about Captain Marvel. We don't know from that. And you're right. You're right. But you know something. What's wrong with once in a great while as old far? It's having a little fun. Nothing.
Which was your all time favorite cartoon or comic book action figure we asked over 900 votes on the survey and the survey said Superman. Oh, 240. I played that enough yesterday. I'm not going to slip that back out again. 240 winning hands down.
And the good news is that the top three came out just the way we anticipated that man who was like fell to third for a little while.
Everybody climbed right back up that bad pool got back up in a second with 152 Spider-Man 137. The Hulk 49 wonder woman only 39. It was kind of weak poor Linda Carter. Nobody cares about her anymore. Silver surfer, which I have no idea what that is. 31. Yeah, you know what it is? Well, yeah, that was a late fact.
So I wrote them on the sheet before it faxed to Eric. He's a galactic. He surfs around on a surfboard and he's silver. It was big.
Dick Tracy 27 Captain American 22 space ghost had 21 green lantern. Another one I never heard of was tied with flash Gordon with 18 and the tick head 18.
The flash head 17 Captain Marvel and the green hair net each had 16 Iron Man had 15 plastic man, which I voted for at only 14. That's that's not acceptable. That's a very low number for plastic man.
The fandom had 11 Aquaman 10 daredevil 9 supergl 8 ghost rider 5 Prince Vadion 5 Superboy 1 up with 2 with a pair. Superboy had a big pair and green arrow head only one.
So that's where it came out 900 plus votes, which is not that bad. But you could tell he just didn't have their heart in it yesterday. You know, it was just not up their alley.
There was nothing for them to monkey round with either. Here's our pool today, Eric. And it's similar to ones we've taken before, but I think in honor of Luke Helder, John Paul Matthew and whatever the other ones are.
Isn't that interesting that he's got like such a religious name to you know, he's got all the apostles in there as many as they could jam in.
Too bad he wasn't his spatic. He could add a few more men there. He could have one of those, you know, eight part names, right?
Three last names and a couple of days and does in there. So here's our pool today, Eric. Who would you most like to pull the switch on?
Now see, last time we took a pool similar to this. All it was different, but you know, along the same lines, people pissed off out of their scumbag.
We took OJ out of there. I don't want to take away their fun. You want to know why one of the greatest outlets that the people are soft, Florida have and the people of America have is like, you know, doing their thing with OJ.
Let's get him. Let's pull the switch. I'd pull the switch. I don't know, problem. Also he's on there, but also we got a very good list. I think today. Andrea Yates, Robert Blake and George is absolutely not.
George is still working on that statue. Susan Smith. See, the problem with this is they're not going to remember some of these people. Susan Smith, who drowned her two kids in a car because they were in the way of her affair trailer trash Susan Smith in South Carolina.
The fact that she's still alive really frost my ass and Pamela smart, who I wouldn't put on her except I saw that thing on biography last night. Pamela smart, who had the affair with a 15 year old kid. She was a school teacher. He was a student.
And then she enticed the three kids to kill her husband convincing the so she can get the insurance money number one and convincing the one kid that that was the way they could continue their affair and live happily ever after if they got her husband on the way. And so they shot him. They shot his ass.
Interesting enough and watching the and watching at the trial, the segments they had on biography last night, the kid who did the shooting, the boyfriend. Yes. He started out with had a big, a huge kitchen knife and the prosecutor asked him, well, how come you didn't go through with it?
And of course he's crying and doing the thing with a clean X and having nervous breakdown. Well, I just couldn't get myself to do it. But of course a gun.
There's so much cleaner and neater and so much easier. You know, sure, no must know.
So thank God that John Ascroft and this administration is gun loving guns, squeezing gun toning. We'll get to that story a little later on.
Have even more reinforced that second end of bull crap about the right to a bear arms and people are up in arms about that. Anybody with a brain except a quest for Glenn and Miramar.
Go buy some more Glenn. Get some more. Of course, Luke Skywalker. He had a few guns on him and six more bombs to anyway, Pamela smart Luke Helder the mailbox bomber.
We better put that in parentheses. You're nobody know who that is and John Walker. Lined. There's a thing that's pretty good list. Sure.
Am I leaving anybody out who's obvious?
Thinkin. I mean Paul and he was obvious to but he's dead. Who would you like to most pull the switch on? OJ and Reates Robert Blake Susan Smith, Pamela smart.
Luke Helder the mailbox bomber. We better put that in parentheses or John Walker. Lined. That's come back from Afghanistan.
Of course, so abused by our government and treated so poorly. I say, you know, give me nice shaving a bath and then blow his brains out.

Orlando Man and Teen Boy in the death of Annamaria Angel.
The indictment charges each one with one kind of first-of-be murder, one kind of attempted
first-of-be murder, and one kind of sexual battery-slash armed gang rape, and two counts each
of robbery with a firearm and kidnapping with a weapon.
I think we'd all like to get together and pull the switch on them.
Together.
The four men Victor Manuel Carbio, 34, his brother Hector Manuel Carbio, 30, Cesar Antonio
Mena, 22, and Joel G. Libron, 23, continue to be held without bond, thank goodness, in
the Dave County jail.
A judge has said, May 20th, the arrangements for Mena, Libron, and Hector Carbio, Victor
Carbio, will be arraigned on May 21th.
Just have a fast trial, that's all I say.
Fast trial, get it over with, and then, you know what we do with the rest.
I think it's time to bring back Old Sparky, what do you say?
I don't want to sound like one of those real heavy-duty, gun-hoed, capital punishment people
because that makes you sound like some right-wing lunatic.
But what it does boil down to is that we're pissed off.
You know, pissed off gets me fired up when I hear that.
And I think that this lethal injection is a little bit too, it's too sanitary, you know?
It's too medicinal, too antiseptic.
You like to see them shimmer and shake?
Yeah!
We like to know that Old Sparky's going off.
You see those, what was your movie?
They made a million of them.
No, no, you know the one I'm talking about.
The black guy that they fried, the green mile.
Is that the one?
It was not the green mile.
I didn't think he would have seen that.
No, with Kevin Costner, whatever his name is.
Costner.
Costner.
See, I can't even think of his name, I can't thank Kevin Costner.
No, he was in it.
And some big black guy, they fried in the South.
And anyway, you didn't hear him the movie I'm talking about?
No.
Well, somebody will, somebody will fax in.
They'll call in because Pat is absolutely not going to talk to you.
He's not got no interest.
In fact, Pat begged me to play the old Bob Coulwood at least a second goal from last night
because he was busy watching some stupid baseball game.
It's a pass to the corner.
Right in the head of his man, Carter.
Holly is over there.
Arbor is in on him.
Ronald has it behind the neck.
Ronald is up front trying to jam it in.
He's going.
Ronald has tried to jam it in on the back.
It's a second goal of the game.
And it's a two on the board.
You're on the left.
Always love the Alan McCauley.
Not.
Well, hey, listen, it goes to show you when you're playing on the first line, instead on the fourth line,
your ability has actually come out.
You know what I'm talking about?
Probably not.
Sorry.
Now let's get down to the meat of the matter.
As long as we're taking this pool on this,
and I know it sounds very simplistic, but let me say it again.
Just I want you to soak this in, okay?
Very simple.
Nothing complicated.
Nothing.
You're not doing a good job of teaching your kids right from wrong.
You can go back to every one of these horrible, horrible, grotesque stories.
You can look at those suicide homicide bombers there in the Middle East.
You can look at what's happening all over the world.
And somewhere along the line, we're not doing a real good job.
Not a very effective job of teaching people the basic differences between right and wrong.
We're not talking about absolute rights and absolute wrongs, but just plain common sense.
Common sense.
We don't have any common sense.
And this kid with these pipe bombs who had people crappin' in their pants all over the country,
especially male carriers, and people who were living in rural areas in the Midwest waiting to see
if they're going to get their hands or heads blown off when they opened up the mailbox,
he thought he was on a lark.
He thought he was having a great old time.
It was a hoot.
Yeah, real hoot in a holler.
And when he talked to his parents on the phone yesterday morning for ten minutes,
he said, he asked them, oh, you think I'm going to spend jail time for this?
Oh, no, it only sounds like 18 counts of attempted murder to meet Luke Skywalker.
You think I'm going to spend any jail time for this?
Smart ass punks.
That's what we're dealing with in America, boys and girls.
Smart ass punks.
You don't know the difference between right and wrong.
Like the ones who get on the, by the way, how about that stock market up?
Oh!
You don't think it's going to happen again today, do you?
No.
Do I dare turn that on for even just one second or they're in a spot right now?
Just to see those futures.
Then I'll turn it off real quick, I promise.
You see how it wound up?
That one up to zero.
I know.
I know.
That one up 305 points and then I asked that 122.
Oh!
If we can just repeat that every day for the next six years, I might get my money back.
It was a lot of other poor bastards out there too.
I can't, you know something, I can't even imagine.
For the life of me, I can't out imagine.
What?
The people who had their life savings in like Enron.
Uh-huh.
And then some of those other high-flyer stocks that turned out to be like worthless.
Right.
The ones that were like 150 and 200 bucks a share during that bubble just getting blown up.
And then they just, they did blow up.
They just thought, yes, the bottom fell out.
And all those people got nothing.
You work all your life and those people are now going to say, well, I've got to work another 20 years.
I'm only 75, but working another 20 years because all my return money is gone.
Makes me want to cry.
I know, it doesn't make me want to cry.
It makes me very, very angry.
It makes me wonder how to help people can be so passive about getting ripped off like that.
It makes you understand why they keep sending all their goddamn money.
It makes you understand why people keep going back to church every Sunday.
So I'm going to tell you, you know, this business about why, you know, if you do drugs, you're supporting terrorism.
I'm going to tell you something right now that's beyond a shadow of a doubt.
If you go to church on Sunday, is Catholic Church is what I'm talking about.
And you put money in a collection plate, you're contributing to this ongoing problem.
You're supporting a corrupt institution.
You're lending your tangible support to a corrupt, grotesque, child molesting institution.
That's what you're doing.
And the best part of the whole deal is that in spite of the fact that donations are down,
there still are a ton of people, a smettload of people, given a smettload of money.
I don't understand that.
It goes to show you how brainwashed, how deeply inculcated they are with this horse crap.
That's a good word.
I love inculcated. That's one of my favorite, what does it mean?
I don't know.
Sound good though.
I love it. I'd like to see if I could spell it.
Yeah, I could.
Pretty good spell, or I don't know what any of the words mean, but I spell them real good.
926 at 560.
I like the tone of the show today.
You know what? I just like the tone of the show.
I don't know why I just have that feeling.
Maybe because I didn't eat any goddamn nestles, turtler, any crap yesterday.
I'm off all life crap.
Okay.
Wonderful talking about it.
It's a lot of fun.
I can't do that.
I just can't keep doing that.
Don't die.
Because I saw Mary Tyler Moore on King last night for about three seconds while I was channel surfing.
And you know, she's diabetic, but I think she's type one.
But she was talking about diabetes now.
Orondis it isn't about how the blood vessels in your eyes start leaking blood.
You know, when you're, uh, is she, uh, they found out she was diabetic when she was pregnant.
They put her in a hospital.
Her blood sugar was 750.
I don't even know what that means.
750 when normal is like between 75 and 130.
750?
That's like sugar like.
God.
Yeah, it's like having sugar in your veins.
It's like eating that nestle.
He's turtler ice cream.
Hey, listen, if your hair is gone down the drain, here's the answer for you.
Boy, there's so many different things you can do.
Everybody in their brother saw all kinds of pills and they saw all kinds of mousey looking hair pieces.
If you know what?
You know, I'm not going to tell you what.

Groups who's chocolate manufacturers.

contains, waits in here, this.
Potentially, hazardous levels of lead and cadmium, and should carry warning labels, just

D-E-D-Dead.
The suit by the nonprofit American Environmental Safety Institute leds his chocolate products
exposed consumers, especially children, to potentially dangerous levels of the metals.
A state investigation last year discounted the lawsuits, claims on the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration researchers have found children younger than six who eat lots of chocolate
taken six percent or less of the total daily amount of lead allowed by law.
So even these kids are eating chocolate by the pound full.
They're still getting like six percent or less of the total daily amount of lead allowable
by law.

Uh-oh.
And of course, you know what Nestle Turtle, what most of that is, beside the sugar.
Chocolate?
Chocolate.
And Kraft Foods North America Inc. said the lawsuit was baseless and attempt to extort a settlement.
The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court seeks in part to force the victims to
include warning labels on the products under Reckrobin of California's Proposition 65 that
individuals be warned before they're exposed to dangerous chemicals.
Scientific testing found lead in cadmium levels in products like M&Ms presented a clear
and present danger to the health of our children, said Roger Kirrick, an attorney for the Palo
Alto-based Institute.
M&Ms, according to this clown, create a clear and present danger to the health of our
children.
And maybe that's the reason why those strange people are out there in the streetcourt
is selling?
M&Ms.
Right.
Absolutely correct.
Have you ever taken a look at those folks and we've tried to get the answers on a million
times?
I'm going to show what's that all about.
Who are those people and where did they steal?
I mean, where did they get those M&Ms?
It's about me.
Maybe they tried to poison your children.
Michelle Karrash, no relation to David, an attorney for the chocolate company, said the
two metals are present naturally in chocolate and other foods, but in levels too low to pose
any hazard.
In other words, you know, pass me to God, they're in Hershey bar.
Pass me the stickers.
Pass me the turtle candies.
Pass me the fish food.
Pass me the chocolate marshmallow.
Pass me the rocky, freaking road, baby.
Pass me that big, half thing of Cadbury's chocolate crunch.
Okay, you need to stop it.
Why?
Pass me the things.
Oh, and you're going to start hyperventilating when I tell you this.
Let me just finish this thing.
We will vigorously defend the safety of our products.
Karrash said that our greater concern is getting the word out that these things are totally
without basis and just designed to scare people, get them all worked up into a frenzy.
Just like that.
Anyway, I don't think you're ready to hear this.
I'm ready.
Yes, what kind, speaking of candy?
Wasn't we talking the other day?
See, we talked too much about fattening food on the show.
That's why I'm still fat.
Not that I'm eating any of it, but I am.
But remember, I was talking about how, no, it's really big weight.
I mean, they started this a few years ago, but now every kind of candy, whether it's
ever been invented, has got an ice cream that's loaded.
In fact, the ones up here, like in a leader, which is a little more than a court we figured
out, it shows you on the package more than two bars of whatever kind of candy it is
around here, two full bars, crunched up in the inner.
Yes, what candy?
Yes, what candy?
And I don't want to admit that I had any.
His got its own ice cream.
Smarties.
That, they do have that, but I mentioned that the other day.
Score.
Oh, well, doesn't that going to be just like in the car?
And of course, there's a heat bar crunch ice cream that's been out for a long time.
Right.
The Ben and Jerry's thing.
So isn't that going to be like real similar to that?
No.
They had to change that name, didn't they?
To what?
To English, Ben and Josh?
Ben and Josh?
I don't know.
No, the flavor.
I think heat bar is better.
I know the one you're talking about.
It's pretty good.
You put it in a microwave and then all the toffee and air starts melting into the ice
cream.
Oh, my God.
About 35 seconds for a pint.
OK.
Take it from the expert.
35 seconds on high in your microwave.
And then you just, when you put your spoon in it, and the spoon starts like leaning over a
little bit, then you know it's cooked.
It's cooked.
It's melted into the thermometer.
That's right.
Stick it right in your...
Don't use the erectile thermometer.
Please, not in your ice cream.
Not a good idea.
Ice cream, you scream.
We all scream when we found out it was the wrong thermometer.
Man.
Score ice cream.
An experience that will lead you breathless as Jerry Lee Lewis would say.
Guess who wrote breathless?
Otis Blackwell.
Well, who was?
Black.
Black and he's dead.
And he was dead.
He was dead.
He was great.
He wrote all of it.
Don't be cruel.
What was the other other stuff he wrote?
I forget, but he's dead anyway.
I forgot.
He was outstanding.
Otis Blackwell.
Those guys back there, and those days, fats, water, and fats, domino, and all those
all those farts.
They were the best.
They were the real, the R&B crowd.
See, Bill Haley had that little strange, uh, cruey-cute, there, what do they call those?
Spit the thing.
Spit curl.
Now, what they called him?
That's what it was, a spit curl.
Right.
Great ball of fire, fever.
I'm looking at this, oh, a bit again.
Yeah.
Mother's spreading it out.
Okay.
Well, I think we, I think we covered that adequately.
Yes, though, you seem to be extremely worked up about this because you got all the stuff
and it turned out the guy is black.
But you know, some, it really don't make any difference one way or the other because
first of all, the music was still great.
And secondly, in spite of all your protestations, he still dead.

And an apromand walked through the white land.
Houses went on the sale.
I was standing on a corner selling rap CDs.
When I met a little German jam.
I got it right in my tummy cause I didn't know I did.
It was the leader of a group club.
We f***ed on the bed.
F***ed on the pole.
So long I grew a f***ing afro.
Then I f***ed to the lab.
To the rise.
I suck my f***ed to the s*** termite.
I thought to myself and Steve the shitha.
Got my past lookin' like a zebra.
I put on my clothes and I was on my way.

Tell you a woman in the heart of Osprey
You've had a big, good, and big titties too
So I hopped in her ass like a kangaroo

Busted up in with a wide- your punks
That term of said was wife in a spade of Kentucky

OJ78
Andrey835
I mean there's no contest
We know in the beginning he'd win by a glans lie
But that's okay
We can never stick it to his ass enough
Andrey835
Susan Smith-33
John Walker-Lin-20
Father Shanley-17
Father Gagin-12
Lukeka Skywalker-Helder
The mailbox bomber
And I see most people don't know who that is still
They don't know who that is
Two guys
And Pam Smart-yeah, he was a little too fresh
Pam Smart and Robert Blake each have one
See, I got a perfect punishment by the way for Luke
Lock him in a room with Father Shanley and Father Gag
Hey, about six months
Yeah, although he's a little old for them, don't you think?
Well, he looked, he's 21 going on, he looks like about 16 I would say
I think he's like on the upper edge of their limit
On the outer limits
But of course if they're locked in there, I guess they'd have to make do
Maybe they could shave him up
Can't you see the hissy fight over that?
Haha, oh man
They could turn him into like a human sandwich
He could be like the meat in the middle of the sand wall anyway
You can just use your own imagination, but I don't think so
See, I don't have any sympathy and you know it's just a matter of time
Because already you're starting here and you are reading to me some of the stuff from different articles this morning before the show
About, well, he's seen so nice and he was laid back and never stole a freight train
And we have to examine you know what was in that weed that he was smoking and how did he listen to one too many Kurt Cobain records and all this other horse crap
You know
It's just so basic and simple and the fact is that this society takes things that are so elementary might your Watson
And making it like this big complex saw it, there's nothing complex about it
If you can't teach your children the basic difference between right and wrong
Whether without any religious holo ballu or consequences that go along with it
If you have to like have some threat in the threat of punishment then there's no hope for the human race
If you have to threaten that you're going to burn in hell if you break one of the commandments or some of that horse crap
Nobody believes that anyway that's got a brain
So that's what it really boils down to just knowing the basic difference
Like when a dog walks out in the middle of the road, it runs out in the road and you're driving
You don't like run it over you know you do your best to avoid it
There's just certain basic things just because you know it's common basic decency
God I think that was a good idea and we can also put cardinal law in here like supervise
Okay, since we got this story next
Cardinal law answers questions from victims lawyers and civil lawsuits today
He'll be back again tomorrow by the way for more for part two
And how come they're called and broonard now I thought his name was Bernard
People do that and I don't know why and I don't know if there's two ways of saying it but I've always heard that
You know I'm looking at this picture and this is from the Abustan Globe
He looks like a saint Bernard
Yes, got channels
He's got big fat jowls
Cardinal Bernard law maintained under oath yesterday they relied on the advice of doctors and subordinates when he approved the transfer of a priest
Accused of sexually abusing children to a new parish
There isn't one word that comes out of his mouth that I believe
Law was ordered to answer questions from the attorney for 86 people who filed civil lawsuits alleging law on the Boston Arts Dice which he heads was negligent and supervising
Pedophile defrock priest John Gagan and failed to prevent abuse which we all know everybody with an IQ larger than their goddamn thumbnail knows it's true
Including you Catholics out there who continue to subsidize this crap the deposition was ordered at the arched I see sliced
Week back out of a settlement with the Gagan victims that would have been worth up to 30 million dollars
Law who is withstood repeated calls for his resident resignation from people to say he's mishabiled the sex abuse cases arrived at the downtown court house amid heavy security
Can't imagine why can you know why I mean after all he's a man of the cloth
The closed-door deposition opened with his attorney Wilson Rogers Jr. No relation by the way making a standing objection to the questioning saying the inquiry into the inner workings of the church was inappropriate
Oh brother the inquiry into the inner workings of the church was inappropriate
None of your business yeah or is the mad dog would say if you say something negative about Dan Marino it's disrespectful that's his favorite word this is inappropriate
Under questioning law explained that he was both a U.S. citizen and a citizen of the Vatican as a cardinal he is technically a prince he said he recently learned of that status
Maybe like to hang out with prince can't ask must macho prince or cardinal law that's going to be our poll question tomorrow
But I must say that it hasn't been something that I've been conscious of in the past 17 years law said according to an 88 page transcript of the morning session released by attorneys for the plaintiffs
It has been suggested that law could enjoy diplomatic immunity from civil law since because did you realize that he's a dual citizen?
No it did not until yes he's a citizen of the U.S. and he's citizen of a fraudulent country the Vatican which has its own national status you are aware of that the Vatican I have aware of that
Sue donation yes right a scale you could go there and have like diplomatic immunity and go out there and hang out and hide what a crop
Hang out probably hang out with a swish guard boy they sure are pretty William Gordon an attorney for the plaintiffs challenge see and you know I'm thinking about this what's his name again
See I don't know what his name is the kid the bomb holder. Oh Luke. Well that should be easy remember just take a star wars I'm thinking about Luke and I'm sure that somebody out there would be saying to me you know if he was like cute if he looked real cute if he looked like Tom Welling you wouldn't be talking about frying his ass
You talking about doing something else with it and maybe they might have a point then we'd fry his ass William Gordon an attorney for the plaintiffs challenge law about why he approved
Gagan transfer 1984 even though he'd received letters another evidence of abuse by Gagan see and what I just said was true though you know we we've talked about that we always sympathize more with people
Look good right you know for example if Susan Smith or Anne creates either one of them in a real hot babe you wouldn't be having a real hostile attitude right now or Pamela smart no all I can't really
Letters warning about Gagan's behavior and that doctor said Gagan was not a threat I'm sure that the medical assurance was given law said whether it was subsequently put in writing in earlier form given or
I cannot say but I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the letter would never been put before me for a signature have we not the assurance of someone competent to give that assurance that the assignment was safe
Right we're gonna send him somewhere where he'll be safe just like that meeting at Louise in the Bronx where we'll be safe he'll be known toward how so lots of doing
Klosski try to be a boy it's the best in the city he acknowledged however that the arts dices had no written policy on handling allegations of sex abuse by priest at the time
Gagan is currently serving a nine to ten year prison term after being convicted of sexual molesting a boy he's been accused of molesting more than 130 children
The deposition of law is a legal rarity for someone of such high church rank and look at that they're coming to take him away again there was another guy damn ambulance
Law said he didn't remember reading a letter from Margaret Gallon a relative of seven-ledged Gagan victims would express disbelief that the church gave him another chance to say Brennan's perish in Boston
Nornity recall a letter from Bishop John Darcy warning him that Gagan was unfit to be reassigned he doesn't remember that
Right however law did say he recognized his handwriting on a note forwarding one of the talents letters to Bishop Thomas daily one of his subordinates with instructions urgent please follow through
I wish we had that do have that foreigner and urgent you do have that do have that I'm too lazy to reach over and get it
In 1984 letter it's much easier to play it's a much harder reach in the 1984 letter Gallon alleged Gagan at abuse seven people while it's saying in his perish in Roxbury it's just impossible for him not to remember that letter said Gagan victim Mark Keen who attended that position I found that the cardinal had some selective amnesia oh I love that term we work for somebody like that who's always got selective amnesia don't say anything and I'm sure you won't oh and by the way Greg if you're listening I got the strawberries the ones you've been looking for
He's been running up and down the hall last two weeks rolling those steel balls in his hand looking for the strawberries I just had a few here during the last break
Slice strawberries God I just love strawberries you know I mean why don't you have to ice cream all the other crap for something sweet when you got delicious slice strawberries man I got him anyway
Mitch gear a beady in the attorney he's kind of a sleaze ball to that lawyer he looks like Maddie Bell on a bad day he's kind of an ambulance saser but nevertheless he happens to be right in this case he fell into a bucket of crap so you go boy
Mitchell gear a beady in attorney for the gagan victims had law have been quiet and seemed sad during the questioning
Law's deposition is scheduled to continue all day tomorrow and Monday at the art dice his chance to read in Boston he gave a lot of his standard speeches
His standard responses to the situation gear a beady and be saying laws lawyer declined to comment law repeatedly emphasized that he relied on the judgment of others
He said he was prompted to assign gagan to a new parish on the device of two doctors even though both lack proper credentials and sex abuse matters and what had been accused in the civil law suit of molesting one of his patients
Oh please read that again I'm squeezing myself law repeatedly emphasize that he had relied on the judgment of others
Law has said he was prompted to assign gagan a new parish on the advice of two doctors even though both lack proper credentials and sex abuse matters and one had been accused in the civil law suit of molesting one of his patients
Let's hear it all right let's hear it for the father and the son and the holy ghost see if you get upset about these things you might as well just blow your brains out you know

how about when we did that long that lengthy thing which we might have to do again very soon by the way I enjoyed that although I enjoyed the thing with the
themes that we did a couple days ago that went over like a pregnant pole pole vault around the 4th of July and Miami Beach wasn't that yesterday
we did yesterday on the pole with the themes right I thought you were just I'm lost I'm lost I'm lost no whatever was I'm just saying we we I tried to
reprise that by playing those themes and just that nobody would have any interest as I told you British rock band
queens and during hit bohemian rhapsody's been named the nation's favorite single of all time the song be
channeled and imagined to claim the top slot and to pull organized by the Guinness World Records British
a hit singles book what did you say I was just going to ask myself that question the
the Guinness World Records British hits singles book the Guinness World Records British it singles book
well they have to say it slowly you have to enunciate what was that word I learned before
comestibles oh I love that I thought that was the bill the people in the bill cause me show bohemian rhapsody a six-minute
epic which was eight and it's oh so I was starting to say before I interrupted myself with that crap which we both got lost on
when we did the pole on the music it was a stairway to heaven as usual came out on top right correct but wasn't bohemian
rhapsody way to hell up there also it ranked very well but stairway to heaven always wins in America whenever the rock
I don't want to hear stairway to heaven okay I don't hear it ever again no in fact you know something
I don't want to hear bohemian rhapsody again either I still like I mean it was it was great but I
just I don't want to hear it bohemian rhapsody a six-minute epic which was aidedness appeal by one
of the first videos first top the UK charts in 1975 and we've all seen it a million times back when
Freddie Mercury was still alive by the way I remember that it did so again in 1991 when a fundraising
version was released following death of the band singer Freddie Mercury there's my psychic powers
again acting up all the way did see that it also gained for the repeal in 1992 and appeared in one of
the most memorable scenes in the American comedy film Wayne's World Wayne's World the band's
guitarist Brian May said it's become a classic phenomenon and no one and one which no one will
ever allow us to forget what they should get carried away don't they those brits too much in that
royalty crap too much pomp and circumcise they should get emotional just like with Diana and the
queen mum they get so emotional about crap you know it's sad when somebody dies like that but when
somebody gets to be 101 there's nothing sad about it get over with already toward the end she
couldn't see a guy damn thing she couldn't hear she was like a like a breathing vegetable there
put her out of her misery bohemian rhapsody was the first single to go to number one twice in the
same version did you know that no followed earlier this year by George Harrison's My Sweet Lord
which is on a charts in Britain at 49 that's because he died see there's a good lesson for all
you would be musicians out there make yourself a pretty good record then if you die especially
prematurely then it'll come back and be bigger than ever like all Elvis's stuff bigger now than
everyone he was alive right me he had gigantic hits number ones etc but now it's like bigger than
life itself who the hell ever wanted to go to Graceland when he was alive when it could actually
see him in the flesh when he was living nobody wanted to go there but now that he's dead everybody
slept in a Graceland anyway bohemian rhapsody is also the only song that I've hit the Christmas
number one slot twice and because it's straddle the new year period has been number one in four
different years wow it has spent a total of 14 weeks at the top of the charts again keep in mind
that's the bridge charts we're talking about I'm assuming because this is taken from
it's on CNN dot com but it's definitely a Brit thing may and queen drummer Roger Taylor were
presented with an award by British hits say oh see there you go again British hit singles book
editor David Roberts had London's Dominion theater yesterday well I said it right they were

and by the way you know Bob you're a great guy and we love the voice and everything but Bob
Shepherd just turned 103 is even older than the queen mum time to hang it up Bob okay and by
the way the Yankees are mediocre at best may said the song was apparently so far if of any rival
that even must before the deadline his position in the new pool was unimpeachable thank you people
for the memory in other words it was like oh gee on our survey today so far ahead that the result
is beyond doubt beyond question Robert said Queen is a band whose achievements are legendary no band
apart from the Beatles has had more top 10 hit singles now that wouldn't be true here though would it
no fat stomino Elvis Presley a lot of bands had more than I could look that up in a book maybe
I will during the break I don't want to waste your valuable time here oh by the way let me interrupt
myself because I almost forgot look for the QAM van from now to 1230 at Verizon Wireless at
132 56 this game Boulevard because Miguel Azari's got our usual crappy prizes maybe if you're
nice you'll let your spin it spin the QAM feel that's not a 1230 at Verizon Wireless 132 56 this
game Boulevard now what were you just gonna mumble I was gonna say yes you should look it up because
now I'm curious ah geez if you realized how far I had to reach for the book about two feet
how about Madonna mm since I just happened open to that page it's getting too close to lunch time
to talk about Madonna another classic example of hype don't give me a solid answer about Madonna okay
you're broken up the wrong tree if you're gonna pedal me Madonna queen here you go top 10 hits
position let's see bohemian rap city you know that that only got as high as number nine in the
states no I didn't know that yeah we we are the champions which if I have to hear that again oh
I'm gonna get four but crazy little thing called love was number one for four weeks another one
and David boy well that doesn't count does it yeah sure counts for both of them they we did
bohemian rap city made the number two for a week but that but they didn't have a whole bunch of
top what about what did I say again they had more top 10 hits than any other group than the Beatles
well not in the U.S. not in the states see in England they revere the queen here we like you know
they're okay but we don't worship the queen it was really miles ahead of the opposition but it's
interesting looking down the list where there's a good mixture of old and new unlike many polls
which seem to have an imbalance of hits from the last two years our readers voted across all six
decades of the single chart making it the most definitive top 100 ever more than 31,000 people
voted the poll of readers of the reference book half of the top then is by Lenin and the Beatles
whose high entries are why what do they say high entries why can't they just tell us what number
you basted you CNN sucks whose high entries are hey Jude penny lane strashtra slashtra refield forever
which was on one single both sides yesterday and let it be in all the Beatles managed seven of
the top 100 well that's not such a big deal not putting the Beatles down of course but seven out
of a hundred isn't that big of a deal would you think no not for that in England the most recent
single in the top 10 is Robbie Williams unfortunately angels while the Spice Girls first hit
wannabe is in the upper reaches of the chart with the groups to become one at seven number 78
and their final release howard 82 American acts also a fair feature including three entries by Elvis
suspicious minds is number 14 heartbreak hotel 40 48 and jailhouse rock 94 two by Michael Jackson
oh Jesus I told you they worship queens billy gene 15 and thriller 26 and the Eagles hotel
California 17 the British punksy of the 1970s is represented twice by the sex pistols with God
save the queen see every song over there that's big has got something to do with some queen
it's either sung by a queen or it's about a queen and Johnny rotten the queen there you go sex
pistols with God save the queen at 65 how's he doing by the way he's going to be released later
this year to mark the golden Jubilee and energy at the UK at 96 by and by teenage kicks from the
undertone to 74 okay well I was interesting for a while and then as we started getting into the
real bit crap it got kind of boring what we're going to hear that Luke go record Luke helper the
the would look to be helper to one that they were playing yesterday just to make fun of him because
he did all that stuff see I don't find anything I'm using about that story to me it's cut and
dried 18 cases of attempted murder life in jail that's it that's a good way of putting them to
death as a matter of fact now that you mentioned it cut and you imagine how much of the taxpayer money
we could save if they would just make me the king of the universe and just sit me up there with
those flowing robes I look good in that covers up your fat real good I look real good but those
black robes put that goddamn judge Judy and shame I'll tell you that and even that whopner forget
about him he's old news he's dead meat oh and rusty died we did we have that on the ear or not

the real music is plus of course in the on the mainland continent not in England well they got a
few agree they got a one oh and a one's going to be released in the States this summer I'm here
I have a lot of other stuff that and I'm going to say it again kid career if you don't plan that
European music that we've been bringing here for the last several months maybe you wouldn't be
crapping your pants now that people I am is sucking away so much of that audience all of that music
that we brought that they're playing by the way over there on Disney station and getting that
gigantic audience now what didn't want that over there for all those little punks that they're
a programming to all those loyal little punks the ones who ran away like about half our audience
hey that's okay I'm not worried about it are you worried about it I'm not worried about it
hey if there's anybody don't like the way this show is going they can suck my ass okay because
like today for example I love the tone of the show I love it you don't like the tone of the show today
I was it I was it that's most top today yeah you don't have to suck around okay your job is safe
until the next time they bring that up I don't know I love it yeah you love it because you're not
doing anything because you're sitting on your ass there phone out your lineup card for the
baseball game that I'm not having to talk to assholes on the telephone the two one kids like those
like those idiots on a sports nerd shows my god fly ball to center field on our worst days boy you
talk about the colors that we've had and believe me we've had some of the worst morons in the
history of the human race on our worst days we can't come close to those sports nerds those
illiterate one-dimensional morons and all those baseball people who do every year month after
month the every time we get to this time of the year since there's nothing else going on with
the limbo period oh yeah well we had a great time just like uh psychopath there give me a song and
dance what a good time yet the game last night I'm happy for I'm glad I hope you have an even
better time than I have a lot of deep heart runs yeah up up and away and he's pretty exciting no
wonder they don't have anybody out there Jesus they they stuck Joe Angel in the back you know see
this is the thing that amazes me you know like I keep saying there's that certain element of
the people like like psychopath and Norma Kent who are overgrown children and no matter how many
times they stab you in the back you keep going back for more punishment just like me with the
Panthers they've dismembered that organization I live five minutes from the goddamn arena they build
it right close by my house just so it would be convenient I get free tickets I've got great seats
and I got news for how many times that I go this season I handful just a small handful because I'm
not getting sucked in with that phony dog and pony show they're putting on what's the point you
could take a book and a fly slide there and have a better time than watching that product they put
out there on the ice that they call a hockey team and by the way last night Don Cherry and coaches
corner between the first and second period of the Leafs Ottawa game which at least one two to one by
the way said that's right now Scott Mellon B is the best player in the NHL right now not good enough
for the Panther organization which they basically gave him a weight of St. Louis but right now he's
playing outstanding got six rules into playoffs already nice go on Scott yeah he found out who the
real rats were in that organization okay most top 10 singles not pretty obvious who all though you
know something that's pretty close I bet you're going to be surprised at this oh hang on you're

son of a bitch he turned out to be a real major asshole and a phony by the way well remember he
was doing that thing that Guns n' Roses crap right to try to make her come back where in a lot of
one thing about those born again Christians man they would stab their grandma in the back to make
15 bucks easy Marvin Gaye 18 then I say Pat boon 18 like love letters in the sand he did the
whistling on that song too by the way on dot records I just mentioned that in passing a little
trivia there for you anybody care about that no or you're re through Franklin 17 when I see Marvin
Gaye had 18 I haven't got the Beach Boys yet that you're trying to give me a song in advance you
re through a 17 that'll make handcappy Rod Stewart and the temptations each had 16 as did Holland
floats and Connie Francis I was Connie they let her out yet is she still alive by the way Connie
Francis yeah I didn't hear that she died poor Connie I like Connie Francis I mean her songs were
you know kind of schmalcy and they were like you're not supposed to if you're respectable human
being then you're not supposed to say you like Connie Francis but I like Connie Francis because I'm
not a respectable guy so what do I care did you like Connie Francis just fine as far as those
kind of singers go right I'm not saying that that's what I'm trying to point out I'm not saying
I didn't just like everybody somebody's food yeah what she was I mean psychopath wouldn't like
that because he's like yeah I like Ron Francis when you stop with a hockey talk trying to impress
me quit sucking around doesn't work on this show okay in present in fact you can you can really
be a wizard on a sports talk shows because other than Gellie there's nobody in building with
a dog I'd aim hockey puck from my from their shoe what a disgrace sports station and as a matter of
fact I did let's say I don't want to start picking on him again because we have that true
school and on right now so I'm not picking on anybody in particular but during the time I was
sitting here this morning preparing for the show I didn't hear anything other than the score is
just passing reference during the updates I heard no comment about the stand to cup playoffs about
the least win last night in Colorado evening up there series 4 to 1 I heard nothing and granted
hockey's not a big subject in South Florida but Jesus you you baseball people like psychopath I want
to keep you know trying to try to push something nobody cares about we don't care get get over it

every time I see him I always say Jesus Christ are you gonna clean up your actor what those painted
fingernails that long ponytail before we get back to the music stuff which I love that stuff I
don't know about the audience and quite frankly I don't give a crap how's the pull coming before
we get to that who would you most like to pull the switch on OJ as we knew there was no doubt he
is off to the races he's got a hundred eight we'd have him lined up from here all the way to Jacksonville
and it's a lot further from here to Jacksonville from where you are anyway OJ has got a hundred
and here it's changing again hate that 110 more than double the next closest competitor which is
Susan Smith with 52 and he gets with 50 a very good race for second place between two of the most
obnoxious bitches in the history of the human race father Shanley and by the way the judges
considering the arguments now will you know he'll issue his order at some time to be determined whether
they're going to reduce bail or not and let him go off the Thailand and Costa Rica and creates 50
five the Shanley 26 five the Gagan 23 John Walker Lynn 22 Luke Heldr the mailbox bomber or 12 he's
moving up a little bit Luke Luke that's the one who uh 18 attempted murders okay Pamela Smith and
Robert Blake still have Pamela Smart and I say Smith Pamela Smart and Bobby Blake each have only
see I think you've taken care of the Robert Blake problem yeah those are my thoughts in our audience
agree with George that the bitch had it coming she was a conniving just obnoxious trailer trash piece
of high-artist see he first of all he didn't have to knock her up in a first place I mean he don't
look like too much but with all his money and fame you would have thought that he could do a little
bit better than that maybe he would like to she wouldn't tell no lies not uh not Bonnie Bonnie Lee
oh I think you got to I think you got to go I started thinking about what she looked like in
the whole ambience all those Kong yeah she deserved it that bitch too many waited so long hey here's
some good news what's speaking of Janorino West Wing TV president to stumper Reno and Florida that's
going to put it over the top it's gonna be boy no word yet on whether president Clinton will come to
Florida to stump result attorney general but Janorino may have found the next best thing a pretend
president uh Martin Sheen who plays president Joe's Josiah Bartlett NBC's hit drama The West Wing
which I've never watched and won't is coming to Florida is a good show I've never seen a second of
it neither of I I don't know why I'm probably watching hockey games is coming to Florida and early
June to raise money and rally votes for the real former US attorney uh general's bid to one seat
Republican governor Jeb Bush we know campaign announced this week no chance Jan it sorry no chance
I would I'd vote for if I was there if I felt like voting again which I don't but you got no you
got two chances none and much much much much much much less than none no chance Bush of course
has already gotten millions of dollars worth of help from his brother who just doesn't play president
on TV that's right if you don't mind I've just be front him is president Bartlett joked Reno
campaign spokeswoman Nicole Harberger when asked for details of Sheen's visit mr Sheen is a graded
admirer of Janet's he believes she had tremendous record and was very impressed with their 10
years attorney general Sheen will host fundraisers and old-fashioned political rallies in South Florida
or land to impossible one of the locations in the state Harberger said maybe this is a harbinger
of things to come she did not offer specific dates Reno is dipped into Hollywood before before
ill he raised money in Los Angeles and attended an Oscars party with singer I ready I'm ready
I'm ready come on rocket man Elton John right now what do they have in common Jan or Reno in Elton John
yeah that's right they both were big freaky glasses left for go and you know something I bet you
if he was still alive she'd have probably been there with Freddie Mercury two of the Oscars probably
hot your host Rosie O'Donnell you see a pattern here now uh huh who who is leading the charge
to be Vogue Florida's ban on gay adoptions which even the Brits are laughing at Florida now like
everybody else in the world and certainly the Canadians here also hope that a fundraiser for last
year in Miami Rosie O'Donnell Elton John and Martin Sheen now at least we know Martin Sheen is a
heterosexual because he's had like a children you know a couple of kids so at least we think he is
Charlie Sheen who can't get it get out of his own way and of course a medio Estevez or as the
bird used to say Emeño Estevez more as that good movie he was in it wasn't a good movie but
and had a lot of those of people in it see Thomas Howell um the outside of the outsiders yes thank you
Pat yeah the answer very good Pat the outsiders of course they play baseball outside unless it's a
dome stadium so Pat can relate to that the outside is very good and the two on pitch it was a little
bit morbid though and depressing Tom Cruise was in that movie too Tom Cruise was in there and also
the kid with the eyes that watch sunken in but he looked he looked pretty good in that movie Ralph
I was gonna say that no no he wasn't there but I'm not talking about him he's a that's it is a
punk you know he got married when he was about eight years old Ralph Macho to Pat Morita I think so
I think they were doing now he did I'm serious he has a wife you know he's got got married when he
was about like 14 15 something very young I don't know something silly maybe that's maybe he was
doing too many karate chops now who's the other one I'm thinking of that's what the sunken in
his mad Dylan no he wasn't in that movie yes he was I don't think Pat must have just seen it
mad Dylan was in the outsiders I got see I hate to break the news to you but I'm way
heavy and you're right I think you're right but the point of the and you left out seat Thomas
Holler's is very important you already said that I know but I want to say it again outlaw blues
out of order you're out of order the whole effing systems I'd rather I love that scene that is one
of my favorite scenes in the history of mankind don't you love that I loved it but I like all but
you know I like he he paid I live movies you know it's accept the course that one movie that you
didn't see which I hope if you live long enough you might see you know like a woman yeah what is
it yeah could be one of the all-time worst and certainly the worst movie he was ever okay the
outsider oh no that's not it the outsiders yes okay that's still not it you know how many movies
there are named the outsiders about a hundred Francis Ford Coppola's got a movie the outsider that's
that's it that's the one oh that's it I didn't know Francis Ford Coppola directed that movie
while I was there see again we learned something my god I'm gonna have all kinds of
comestibles for lunch maybe I'll invite maybe I'll invite Luke over we'll have combustibles you're
not talking about Patrick Swayze are you if you know how I despise Patrick I know how he was not in
this movie yes he wasn't a movie yes he was can I just read the list here without your mumbling
around here I'll kill some good time the outsiders with see Thomas Hall Mac Dylan Ralph Machio who
it says he got married when he was three Patrick Swayze Rob Lowe right in me you estervez there
a lot of pretty boys in that movie Tom Cruise Glenn Withrow Diane Lane leaf Garrett oh leaf
Garrett I wonder if Tanner knows about that Tom weights and uh SE Hinton and doesn't even name
the one I'm talking about but he was definitely in there he played the one of the uh the kid that
was visiting uh what's his name and me know estervez and jail with the sunken in eyes somebody will
fax that to his please 305 65019 because we're not answering the phone for that you don't know
how I'm talking about no well somebody will let us know somebody really knows their crap he had
something in his yeah kind of kind of like a cool eyes you know I'm talking about like with ring
around a collar he had like ring around the eyes as soon as we tell you he was also in a movie called
fire something fire eater fire something fire started was at it I started was a little girl
too bear more sorry and the board goes back 10 for 1141 at 560 QAM the weather starting to get
really hot again summer storms and a possibility of her coupons follow soon get prepared for a major
storm and discover what thousands of people have done to protect their homes call all weather
systems all weather systems has been in business for over 15 years and their state licensed FEMA
project impact contractor
listen how many songs did man be taken say all say yeah
you know
he saw him for man be taken by you know with that list that the people that it's been hanging around
with I was gonna suggest that maybe she's become a fag hagg but I think maybe there's one
word too many in that sentence anyways 1146 at 560 WQM it's a good thing I don't have to depend
on the audience you didn't get any faxes about that didn't you no you're not gonna be faxes about
anything I don't think no it's been dead really although it says receiving page one right now I don't
know how to do it like Craig shepherds the name I'm looking for you don't know who that is do I've
heard that name before but I don't know what he had Craig shepher he was in some silly movie about this
I think it was a Catholic school and the girls academy was like across the street and they had this
I saw that movie yeah they had a big dance and he went with a girl and they started to fire or
something like that I had I was talking about and by the time he made that movie his eyes were
like something about an inch and a half like raccoon eyes yeah he was he was in the outsiders
everybody was in there everybody who ever looked good including an also peckers ways he who never
looked good getting back to that oh and also I got to get to that thing about the guns I'll get
to that next hour don't let me forget okay about John ascroft and the Bush administration these
champions of freedom for gun nuts yeah too bad and of course this kid Luke he also beside the
six other bombs he had in the car he had guns and he was a fast-rated when the cops were come out of
his car when they find a got him he was quizzing them about their firearms he want to know details
about this one and that gun and how's your piece what's your piece doing yeah we need a lot more
guns that's what the Bush people tell you and it's not just because the NRAs got their office
right there in a white house like they were bragging and because they got them by the balls they
control the whole goddamn government that's just a coincidence isn't it no no most charted
singles the this is a very interesting page in fact maybe I'll just fact this page everybody's
listening right now which couldn't be too many because you tell me that nothing's coming in on
the facts machine today maybe just a slow day 305 650198 I just remember the time what do you mean by
that well it was that every time I looked over there it was said receiving page one or so
another was a machine was a nut up and I'm sitting here this is like the days when we used to
take phone calls the phone was dead and I don't know we deserve yeah oh I'll never forget that one
day downstairs on the circuit doors long as long as I live I mean I'm screaming and I'm yelling
and I'm practically saying the seven dirty words on a year and nothing is happening on the phone
and finally after about a half an hour of this I finally punched down on the lines and I go up
and down the line they're all dead every line on the board the whole phone was dead and of course
that's the QAMF and way because in actually that's the Beasley way we can't be bothered I mean we
have some stuff that looks fairly impressive some that looks like crap and it all works pretty much
the same like crap most charted singles Elvis Presley 114 guess who's number two I'll give you
hint we just heard him out in John very good guess well who else did we just hear was no
his great shepard I don't think he's singing these days the Beatles 52 I tell you me oh S.
Tves was he was a good looking kid but boy he was strange you know in fact there was something
about the role he played in that movie you know that kind of dark brooding you know what I mean
yeah dark and weird that was him he was also an animal we what that was in that movie the
something club the breakfast club the breakfast club you know the movie I'm talking about sure it
was one of those teen angst movies in Chicago yeah where he also played a dark brooding kind of
like John they were all in trouble they were all disturbed but he always dark and brooding
Emilio estuvese you know he went on to direct several movies did he read it kind of like John
stock well by the way did I ever correct myself about that because I don't like even any more

west of Eskall that was then this is now what time I saw different movie you see that no no you
wouldn't want to see it believe me you wouldn't want to see it it was pretty good movie it was
depressing though morbid and dark just like those circles among Craig's eyes anyway
reversing decades of gestive to barman policy the Bush administration has told the supreme
court it believes the constitution protects and individuals right to possess firearms at the
same time the administration's top supreme court lawyer said the high court need not test that
principle now the administration's view represents a reversal of government interpretations
of the second amendment going back some 40 years through four democratic and five
republican administrations the coalition is very disappointed that attorney general john
ashcroft personal politics and debt to the nRA have climbed in the official position of the
justice department Josh Horowitz executive director of the coalition to stop gun violence
told CBS radio news laws like the Brady Bill like the assault weapons band have met constitutional
muster New York senator Charles Schumer Democrats said that during his confirmation hearing ashcroft
promised to uphold the laws as they exist and not to promote his own agenda what happened to that
pledges reporters it's hard look at his actions and not question whether he's going back on his
word somehow the gun movement in this country's been captured by people who are extreme and believe
in no respect at all that seems to be the direction attorney general ashcroft is moving in he
action is pro-positive that the worst fears about attorney general ashcroft have come true
his extreme ideology on guns has now become government policy said michael barons president of
the Brady senate to prevent gun violence which promotes gun control barons noted that other federal
appeals courts in the supreme court have not found the same protection for individual gun ownership
that the fifth circuit asserted in the emerson case in that case the 50 west circuit court of appeals
rejected arguments from texas position timothy emerson at a 1994 federal gun law was unconstitutional
the law was intended to deny guns to people under judicial restraining orders the current position
of the united states is that the second amendment more broadly protects the rights of individuals
including persons who are not members of any militia were engaged in academic military service
or training to possess and bear their own firearms solicitor general ted ulson wrote in
through court filings this week and of course member ted ulson because of the penis gate hearings
and because his wife died in that plane crash yes and because leery king was cut a second is asked
for a night after night that right however is subject to reasonable restrictions design of
event possession by unfit persons or to restrict the possession of types of firearms that are
particularly suited to criminal misuse i think everybody should have at least one who's he don't
also in the administration's top supreme court lawyer and plenty of ammo was reflecting the
view of ash crop that the second amendment confers the right to keep in bear arms to private
citizens and not merely to the well-regulated militia mentioned the amendments text ash crop
causes stir when he expressed a similar sentiment a year ago in a letter to the net the anxious
national rifle association all glennon mirroir squeezed himself right now he's rubbing it
and his peace to while some have argued that the second amendment guarantees only a collective
right of states to maintain militias i believe the amendments plain meeting original intent through
otherwise ash crop wrote at the time ash crop wrote the letter was unclear whether he was
expressing his personal view or stating a new policy position for the government that question
was mostly answered last November when he sent a letter to federal prosecutors praising an
appeals court decision that found the second amendment does protect individual rights but noting
that those rights could be sent to limited narrowly tailored specific exemptions in other words
maybe like crazy people should be running around with guns john is that what are you talking about
crazy people which seem to have the most guns just like luke in my view the emerson opinion and the
balance it strikes generally reflect the correct understanding of the second amendment ash crop told
prosecutors emerson appeal of the supreme court putting the justice department in an awkward position
of the government one its case in the lower court using the old interpretation of the second
amendment ash crop that switched gears by the time the case reached the higher court
allsons court filing Monday urged the high court not to get involved and acknowledged the policy
change in a lengthy footnote alls and also attached ash crops related to prosecutors also made the
same notation in a separate case involving man convicted aboding two machine guns in violation
of federal law in that case the government also won a lower court decision endorsing a federal
gun control law the justice department issued a statement Tuesday night saying its latest comments
reflect the attorney general's position in the November letter to prosecutors the supreme court
last ruled on the scope of the second amendment in 1939 the amendment protects only those
rights that have some reasonable relationship to the preservation of the efficiency of a well-regulated
militia the high court said nineteen thirty nine you know what they were absolutely on target then
and now see that was then and this is now remember that movie no dammit how do you like that oh
there's a lucky loop co-bane committed suicide and recent communications attributed to
hell there were peppered with references to death including his own fascinations with death and
even anti-government viewpoints are not unusual in teenagers according to former FBI profiler Clint
vans and he still was experiencing basically what you and I and everybody else experience and all
of our kids experience in college what makes this guy bill bombs and go across America what change that
a university classmate sexy did see changes in hell there in recent weeks he sort of had a
real direct approach talked all over the professor they getting arguments disrupt class
but at the service master franchise where held her had a part-time job co-workers say they had
seen no change in the young man they describe as nice cheerful even sweet gene reserve CNN
monomy Wisconsin thank you genie now don't you feel bad after hearing that don't you feel sorry uh yeah
no oh yeah I mean he's just confused probably smoked a little bit too much bad weed and he just
went off the deep end a little bit let's just give him like a little probation say don't ever
do it again a slap on her wrist and let him go on with his life maybe give him a scholarship to
like university of Michigan well he'll probably much much higher grade weed or maybe the university
Miami would be good he sure won't get any trouble there here's some good news all a while it's kind
of like a mixed bag this story from the same Pete times by the way I heard Hank mentioned that
feel that a same Pete times is a damn good paper at least certainly is compared to the two rags we
got in South Florida lutes oh my god a popular Catholic priest returned to work Wednesday cleared by
the vices of St. Petersburg after a 10 days suspension of allegations of sexual improprieties in the
late nineteen eighties we got more damn Catholic priest accused and this and that and molestin and
you can shake your thing out you can shake your miterat parishioners at St. Mary Catholic church
in lutes were delighted calling each other with the news that Reverend Bob Morris have been reinstated
let's hear it forever and Bob we always expected the truth to come out and I think we got it said
Meribel Roddell as a member of the St. Mary parish council Morris 45 said he was relieved and thankful
I've been basically unhauled for the last ten days he said George can relate to that
the reinstatement surprises chief accuser Bridget Watkins collage is 27 of Largo you've got to be
kidding she said when told by a reporter then she called her attorney John Travina of Clearwater
she was literally sobbing he said later my reaction was I told you they were going to do this
Travina called the dices investigation a sham remember sand the sham and the pharaohs let's
look him up see if he's on the list as a Catholic myself the lawyer said I'm embarrassed by the way
that I see this behaved Morris being stamo was ordered Wednesday morning by bishop Robert Lynch
that I see said it's send member response team it found absolutely no credible evidence to
substantiate any of the allegations collages accused Morris of filing her 14 years ago when she
was a when he was a 31 year old seminary student working in St. Catharines in a Catholic church
in Clearwater and she was a 13 year old member of the church youth how do you like that
an addition to California college instructor was a part time secretary it's in Catherine in 1989
accused Morris of making it a lengthy obscene telephone call to her that year the complaint was
reported to the dices at the time this week the response team concluded the incident was properly
investigated and Morris properly cleared oh my god the dices said more than 25 people interviewed
in his latest investigation including church members and employees at St. Catharines in 1980s
and on and on a coach crap another white wash you see the problem with all these stale stories
is first of all that people are intimidated and this business is about well if you tell anybody
nobody will believe you there's another area not only our parents not doing a good enough job
of teaching their kids right from wrong like you don't kill people or put pipe bombs in your mailbox
but also they don't tell them I mean I know we keep hearing that they tell them these things but
I'm not so sure it's they're getting across that if somebody touches you in an inappropriate place
immediately tell us call a police run for help screen bloody murder something like that I just
don't think that's getting done enough what's an inappropriate place like church like in the rectum
ry would be an inappropriate place you know exactly what I'm talking about in an inappropriate way
and an inappropriate place like between the navel and the knees would probably be a good definition
or in the case of a female between the knees and the armpits the whole thing is the pits if you
ask me and it just yeah and you can't get across to the public because so many of you are so brainwashed
and so deeply ingrained in you since you were not even old enough to really think for yourself
it's hopeless it's just a hopeless case they're the greatest propagandist in the world
and I ever protested again from a girl I don't think I don't think sorry look for the QA and van

nr aes right wing fanatics you're not fooling anybody so let me again congratulate those of you
morons that voted by accident for pap you can and those of you real idiots who voted intentionally

all before i talk about the olivian uten john you something i've noticed and it could be just me
or could be the time of the year but we were really a smoker to long here on this show for
quite a while then on friday i and i don't know where we are yeah it was that fact and i thank the
guy for faxing me i should be cursing him now i took calls on friday right for the first time in
a coupons age and since then since then i just i noticed that on the uh website it's like everything
is down a little bit and the faxes you know this last couple of days and i couldn't be wrong about
that we just could be going through a lull phase that could be but i don't think so huh you're
just paranoid no i'm not the least bit paranoid i'm not worried about that but the fact of the
matter is that i think taken a calls that there was a bad mistake instead of what davighan says
time i remember that when i'm huh you hear that when a man when man just came on that day and
maddox is oh did i hear right then you'll take calls and davis oh yeah it was great it was great
hey you you you guys stick with your calls okay you a butt out of this show okay dav you're a good
guy but cut the crap was great was there anything great about those calls friday i'm thinking i'll
get back to you yeah diana now what was i just going to do about olivian uten john i don't know
he was mentioned to do i'm i'm i'm too embarrassed to admit this i can't i can't say it say it
she was married at one time i remember she came out of the closet on the uh
tonight show on johnny karson no and said that she was bisexual which is which in those days
that was about as close to like elton john said the same thing i'm bisexual like anybody would
leave it anyway i had a wife you know yeah i know german german acrobat ah what was the name of
that song which one i forget about it you're you're you're you're not on your you're off your
feet it's all the stress at last couple weeks anyway so she was but can i say it just please please
stop mumbling i'm going to agree with Greg Greg hey the uh name of the movie was uh with matla
tanzi what that was the name of that movie my tutor okay remember that movie yes i remember it
very well in fact i saw it just a few weeks ago was on again i always watched it when it's on
because he's running around naked in there and his uh his tutor was pretty good she was okay yeah
little old for him i thought but nevertheless why not i think that was the idea yeah matla tanzi
so anyway matla tanzi he kind of talked like this now i don't want to say matla tanzi just because he
had a very high squeaky voice and acted very fake i don't want to say that he was like you know like
that like melophers but when you see that it was a very you know now guess who else talks just like
that who's a big strapping guy who looks like you know who's probably about the same age at matla
tanzi wasn't it like 25 guess who else sounds just like that like Tyson no i'm serious so
i like here of tom welling oh no i hadn't noticed that about tom well no he talks he talks in much
too high of a register and i find that very disturbing he reminds me i'm talking about vocally
he reminds me very much of matla tanzi rhymes with pansy and see there would be people out there saying
well you should hope that no i don't hope that i want i want Clark Kent to be virile and you know
all all of the things you see what i'm saying i want him to be a real man not a man's man i want him
to be a real man all man but anyway let's see most weeks held number one position see i have to
guarantee one thing psycho pat don't get here this kind of conversation on those port shows

good idea we'll work on that but anyway getting back to this facts thank goodness i got a couple of
good facts in there that kind of lighten me up a little bit because i'm looking at this
browered county chamber of commerce this is one of those notices like a um invitation and also a
solicitation because it's got a coupon at the bottom browered county chamber of commerce please
join us in welcoming the newest member to the browered county chamber of commerce this Saturday may
eleventh from new to p.m. you are going to up check when you hear who it is homeless voice helping
people in america this this is so disgusting and browered county browered county chamber of commerce
you people must be off your rocker man you should hang your heads in shame now now they're now
they're endorsing cults that's number one they're also endorsing people are all of a sudden coming
up with these millions and millions of dollars which we can't just can't figure out how or why
so that they can buy up all these old hotels and buildings and put their homeless
shelters alleged homeless shelters in places where nobody wants them in the first place and try to
inflict themselves on everybody and threaten people that if we don't let them go out on the street
corners on the main thoroughfares that they're going to come into the residential neighborhoods and
bug the crap out of everybody and put the muscle on you with the orange shirts i'm not i'm not
going to promote this thing and the only thing i'm going to do is tell you you people at the browered
county chamber of commerce you people suck shmit that's my comment today that's my response okay
you are a disgrace i'm embarrassed at this moment to live in browered county thank god i'm an
Ontario candidate and i did browered county by the way my little dog is embarrassed to live in browered
county in fact my little dog just uh phoned in and said he's going to start a crap and double
outside from now on just to pollute the air and browered is is that incredible i'm shocked and
dismayed way too close to home by the way for some of us and that's not a cool product about them
there that's a little thing but i'm not on the air i'm not repeating it though i mean i know
it would you but i'm just i'm not given any promotion to that or any credibility to do it but
the fact that the browered county chamber commerce is endorsing and welcoming and also promoting
them and raising their funds which godoring knows where those funds go but it's very interesting
that shan kroni's got that big expensive home and that they seem to keep coming up with these
millions and millions and millions of dollars to keep buying up all these hotel properties
well you see this is what's wrong with soft food there's nobody with a conscience man you
got crooked politicians you got organizations like the browered county chamber commerce i'm
going to tell you if the brower chamber commerce ever endorsed a business i would i would give it
two cents worth of credibility i would say yeah i wonder who's smearing somebody there now
an absolute disgrace soft food all i can say is hang your heads in shame
god you know i had to read that like two or three times you factored during the break and i looked
at that or during that bit i was playing i looked at that and i kept looking over and over again
like is this a joke is this some kind of a freaking joke no it's scary how does this guy do it how does
he keep pulling a wall over people's eyes big cans of grease that that's another great thing first
of all i don't miss driving because i don't have any car up here which i'm very delighted and i
certainly won't have one in Amsterdam because you don't need one here and you don't need one there
so i don't miss the drive and try not to get killed by ancills but i also do miss
stopping at streetlights and being solicited by a bunch of jackasses running around the middle of
the goddamn street like a bunch of little kids who don't know better didn't get out of street corners
putting a muscle on me for cash i mean here you got the people sitting on the streets
spare some change mister and you just you know keep walking you know and paying attention
and don't anybody give me a song and a dance about my being insensitive to homeless people because we
raised a crapload hundreds and hundreds of thousands for the committals house years ago on this show
for homeless people all i'm sure glad that i stopped doing that you know because i wouldn't want to
see that money going to the to bribe people to cover up for pedophiles i don't think we want to see
money that we raised being used for that purpose but it's just the idea that this is so obvious it's
so transparent at what it's really all about and the brown county chamber commerce obviously
really checking into things very carefully before you know endorsing somebody and raising money for
them shame on you coxle hoist that's my message for the brown county chamber commerce okay and now
and now where did that come from the fax machine they fax that to us no somebody did somebody found
this in other words they obviously stuck this on somebody's window or in a door there's a little
note at the bottom door please be free to fly it's like a flyer please join us in welcoming does your
company have a heart to help the homeless please come and show your support yeah that's my
support for you okay i'm all for the homeless all right nobody should have to be homeless but the
idea that these cults that come along these other shady shisters that come down to pike shady
shady shisters fact let's open a place called shady shisters sounds good to me i guarantee a south
floor to be a big hit shady shisters man make a fortune because that's what south floor is all about
21 till one at five sixty wq and hey i'll tell you one thing that's not shady and that's
dial a mattress these are great people i know because i do business with them every time the
mattress wears out which of course is not like every five minutes because a mattress is not something
like you know underwear that you change every few days a mattress is something that hopefully
last you for years when you get a really good one but even the best of mattresses get lumpy
and bumpy and more not you get a sore back you feel like crap if you want to get you a great new
mattress you start feeling better and getting a great night sleep every night call a good people
at dial a mattress like i do call one eight hundred mattress there's no way in the world to beat
their deals you don't have to leave the house you don't have to run around wasting a lot of gas
and certainly not money because they have every day unbelievably low prices on the top manufacturers
in the universe they got serta and celi simons and king coil and a really deep selection
so they won't have to give you the old bait and swish and they also give you that 30 day in
home comfort trial so you can test it out by sleeping on it and do whatever you like doing on it
give them a call right now and you pick the two-hour window when you want to deliver it any day
seven days a week like between ten and noon or eleven and one or one on three and seven and so on
one eight hundred mattresses the number to call they'll be there in no time at all and you'll have
a big smile on it post and be sleeping and comfort night after night one eight hundred m at
ct rs please tell that Neil told you to call or check them out night's on the richly appointed

under advisement other words don't hold your breath he's thinking about it
and how many businesses by the way in date and brow or have been uh...
and i mean i've been this is but how many uh... communities municipalities
have rejected soundly uh... the attempts by these people to intrude
and like by a properties and to change the zoning etc and so on
and if basically and try to ban them from their streets
yeah i hundred
by five thousand
and yet and spot the fact that the municipalities the communities the common
sense people in brow or county have said we don't want these shifters run
around street corners and interfering with traffic and like a strong army
the public and get the album out of there you're like a public nuisance
the brown county chamber comers is a command down
believe in the fund razor for you
i don't want to say there's anything that smells bad there but all i can say is
yeah yeah you can smell it
magnumistic about it so here's some information from one of our uh... factors
ralf macho i find this hard to believe the born november four th nineteen
november sixty one is forty one years old now
it says married in nineteen eighty seventy was twenty six you better double check
that my friend because i think he was married earlier than that i could be wrong
maybe was twenty six but of course at twenty six he looked about ten you know
ralf macho with that bad complexion and what was the guys name and all his uh...
kung fu movies pat marina movies pat marina very good excellent did i say
kung fu movies karate movies sorry whatever
now it's not the same last movie two thousand two a cold day in august for ralf macho
uh... go away ralf give up me little punk here's a great story two bioming coaches
face dismissal caster bioming two volleyball coaches at centennial junior high
face dismissal for allegedly taking part in draping another coaches home with
toilet paper
the students who took part in the prank april six were supposed to be the high school
sponsored sleepover according to the trona county school district officials
muffy mahani
oh yes
muffee
well program directors named muffe so why not why not a muffee muffee mahani and she
all strofele have been placed on administrative leave would pay super intended
stand also said to they'll recommend the school board dismiss the coaches
we characterize the incident is something more serious then it's a toilet paper incident school
district attorney steward they said i thought it was a toilet paper incident
short fell said in the interview last week that the parents of the students assigned permission
slips for the party they said we're not to leave uh... school district what is it that said they
were not to leave school district uh... property i think is what it meant it says party well i tell
you this is from the associated press i think they're hanging out too much too much comedy with
the brown the school of the uh... chamber commerce several students parents have always
support for the coaches under state law in Wyoming
strofele is in title of hearing before the school board also said he assumes such a request
they made mahani however is not a full-time teacher and they said she'll probably get a hearing in front of
only allson strofele received letter april 30th et cetera coaching assignment at the school will not
be renewed for next school year said the actions were not commenced with their punishment
to these are two female see that's why when i said muffy got all been out of shape two female
