Okay, check it out.
Have a nice day, paradise everybody on QAM.
The same as my sister, South Florida's only real fortification.
WQA and Miami Fort Lauderdale, other than the Boycass Group Station.
www.QAM.com
For all four of us.
Things in this delivery that it was able to work with to make them better.
Well Dan, they've done a terrific job with him.
They're patient.
They're not looking for him to be an overnight star.
He's learning to go through his reads patiently.
And you know, he's such a threat back there anyway.
And they just, they don't want to make it where he has to make a big play every down.
But it sounds like a real party.
Yeah.
It's nine o'clock on a Sunday night and I'm gonna watch HBO.
There's some dumb show about a funeral home where the Tony and Big Pussy go.
I've had to wait over a year and a half to see if that Russian guy is dead.
But when I turn on the tube, I'm sure getting screwed because they're showing all this instead.
Goomba, goomba, da da da.
Goomba, da da da.
When the hell are the sopranos man?
I've waited too long for this thing.
I want to see party and still be on in the back room of the fight of being.
It's been so long since the last episode.
There's so many things I forgot.
Dip on it, get wet.
It's furious, smoke and crack.
And this Tony still sails us to God.
So I pick up the latest TV guide and that's when I stop feeling fine.
Thank God HBO is bringing stuff that they go each and every Sunday at nine.
All right.
Oh, it's season four of the sopranos man.
Good thing they're bringing it back.
If I had to wait even one second more, I'd have my cable guy to whack it.
Hey, forget about the ball friggin' time, ain't it?
I know three speaking of time. I'm not hearing an echo, am I? Yes, I am.
You hear that?
No, I don't hear it.
I hear it. And I'll have to send a win away again.
I'm telling you something. Let's hear it for all the technical...
Let's put a memo out about the technical competence of QAM.
Let's tweaking Tuesday.
I see.
Yeah, we're tweaking it. Okay. Because you know, we haven't done this for what?
Are we going to have something like that? Right.
Anyway, Julio's down the way to the airport. Julio's a good guy.
He's our only hope in the engineering department because the other guys are like,
well, a little bit like that.
But that's okay. We don't want to pick on them yet.
Do we?
Sure. Why not?
Sounds pretty good to me.
Okay.
How do you sound? You sound fine?
You hear me fine?
I hear you.
Okay.
I was big of a sopranos. I got some bad news for you.
Oh no.
But before I do that, let me thank Sean and Hollywood, our chronic factor.
Remember last, what was it? Friday?
Okay.
Whatever the hell day it was. It's right at the end of the week.
And he faxed me a thing I was talking about my brositis.
My ailment, do you, or in my brositis in my left elbow?
And he said, ice.
And the whole thing. You know, and of course, not listening to him being a hard ass like I am.
I just continued. First of all, I'm smirking this flex all on there,
which is kind of like, bend gay.
And I'm not doing any ice.
And it's not helping at all.
And it's just going on.
So at 8.30, I figured what the hell have I got to lose?
Because I look on the internet under elbow brositis.
And every one of the recommendations there is ice, ice, ice,
not hot ice.
So I go in my beautiful refrigerator and get out my, not crushed, but the cube ice.
I don't want to rub it in, George. George has an old fashioned refrigerator.
One of those ice boxes where the ice man has to come.
Right.
You don't remember that, do you?
No, I saw pictures though.
Long before your time, the ice man used to come.
Squirt Squirt.
And he had like a big, what do you call it?
Like a, almost like a huge city, whatever they call it.
Like the, like, gigantic t-tongs.
He had a big tongue.
And he would bring blocks of ice
and you'd put them in your ice box, and that's what kept everything cold.
Is that pathetic or what?
And the milk man.
And the milk man used to come.
Squirt Squirt.
Everybody was coming and leave like a thing on your doorstep.
You used to leave a bunch of milk.
And it would sit out there and get curdled.
And then you'd take it in.
And anyway, so I get my ice and I put it in a towel,
make me a makeshift ice pack.
And for 15 minutes, I sat here.
And of course, I haven't given you the report yet.
No.
It's a freaking miracle.
Oh, yeah.
I'm bending it.
I'm twisting it.
I'm like, uh, and the elbow too.
How do you like that?
So if I would have just listened to one of our astute listeners out there,
but of course my usual inclination is if it's one of our listeners,
you know, but it was Sean and Hollywood.
It seems to have his head on straight.
So thanks a lot, Sean.
And what was I saying about the sopranos?
Oh, bad news.
Bad news for you.
But I mean, not that you care.
I go out there.
You do care.
So it was on last night.
A repeat.
I'm sure it was because the season starts September 17th.
You can't come into the middle.
So it was who knows what it was.
Okay.
It was the sopranos.
And I kept catch you right in the beginning.
And I thought, okay, here it is.
I got a full hour.
I've got nothing to do here.
It's just, you know, laying back.
I'll watch it.
No, you can't come in the middle.
I didn't come in the middle.
I started right at the beginning.
No, it's a soap opera.
You got to keep it from the first half of the third.
I watched it.
I watched it in seven minutes of that prep.
It was pathetic.
Okay.
So I'm channel surfing.
I'm watching my racing from Mohawk.
And I come back later.
Ron, here's like the last five minutes.
And I watch it again.
Awful.
Just awful.
Okay.
It was the one where he's like the uncle has had a heart attack or something.
And the boyfriend and I have so muchüless.
He does a great job.
I was thinking what a great proved, you know, extreme dog cleaning
riotta football.
Sahad derived that cocktails.
Here you go.

so many no talent pieces of turd thanks for being nice to me today mom here is the speaking of
wqa n the big always got the problems now i heard mo talking about this story this morning
and uh he's wrong as usual mo is wrong just like the entire station was wrong about that thing
with the masters which i'll get into later time permitting are you familiar with that story about
masters that i'm gonna let women in first i heard of it oh and the tiger doesn't have time to be
worrying about things like that he's got to uh get his game fine tuned about yeah fine tuned it's
okay to be fine tuned but not fine tuned if they weren't letting black people into the masters and
tiger couldn't play in there then they'd be all these sports uh nerds on our station would have
been having a nervous breakdown but women i mean bull bike golfers who cares about that basically
is what boils down to everybody i heard on our station from the mad dog to mo i don't know what
i'm saying about it was full of crap about that subject but anyway getting back to this
among the marlins who are outspoken and accessible players this is in the sun settle and
oh they're not better than that mo they suck they're a bush league rag third basement mic
lowell on saturday threatened to cease doing any more interviews this season oh my god
oh how we're gonna live with that on beside myself i mean it's just amazing that we managed to
squeak through and get that baseball deal settled and we're gonna have to worry now about mic
lowell not doing interviews triggering lowell's iron was wqa m radio talk show during which
host orlando the big alsegarian several colors slammed him for a comedy made on wednesday this is
written by the way by one c rodrigas dirges brother before the game the teams last before friday
strike deadline lowell spoke to reporters about baseball's labor situation as how it would
justify a possible strike defense that may considerably less money than players lowell said
were in the big business of baseball if teachers are making four hundred grand a lot of teachers
and be holding out for a lot of things should they be making it the problem is fifty thousand fans
don't go to see a science class if they did would change in our case fifty thousand don't come to see
baseball games either in other words but i understand that yeah yeah what sure a softwater tv
reporter took that to mean that lowell thought what baseball players did was more important than the
role of educators in our society friday the reporter expressed those sentiments to alsegarian who
come jok and which we would say absolutely correct i will not speak to another reporter until
hourland alsegarian apologizes to me said lowell who has the marlin's assistant player representative
was a go-to guy for most rec related questions my locker is going to be nice and quiet alsegarian
didn't listen to the quote until after his radio show he could see how they come in might be taken
out of context but alsegarian did that lowell left himself open to misinterpretation
maybe if i'm standing there i understand his point but maybe he should have been more clear
about the situation alsegarian said if he's bothered by the writing of his family members if i
insulted him in any way i'm sorry the big as he pushed out all i made was a criticism of his
comments and they could be construed in the name negative fashion i can understand the tv reporter
misunderstanding and lowell didn't defend anything that teachers do i know his life as a teacher
and my wife as a teacher i'm sorry about the comment if he felt insulted but it's his own fault
because he did say it they were comments that could have been misconstrued when i hear a comment
like that what i want to do is defend teachers and you should have apologized big that was a real
act of pacification on your part okay unacceptable and who goes back aren't you embarrassed that he
apologized yeah well god almighty and you know something whoever called the station i come in
them because my hello just like most of the others not on personally but no question he's a
damn shot exactly idiotic comments unacceptable oh 50,000 people come to see yeah that's like in 10

Harold oh oh I was hoping there would be pictures some people questioning the addicts of some
bad boy bad news boys of hip-hop are they in character out of character well get this the bad
blood between Eminem and Moby almost turned violent at the recent MTV video music awards when the
best video the video winners of posse chased Moby during a commercial break according to the New
York Post but also then we written in a hero which always has the posters like two days later
Moby ran and jumped into which here in the audience in radio city music hall when Eminem's
army approached him a source told the paper they were pointing fingers at him and saying things like
we're gonna get you after the show says a witness Moby ran and jumped into the seat in front of us
to get away when Eminem accepted his award for best male video for without me a song in which he
ridiculed Moby he took another punch out of the best technical technical techno titan I don't know
what to say that little Moby girl threw me out of my game and then it said to a chorus of booze keep
booing little girl I will hit a man with glasses responding to Eminem's ill-humored and ill-time
behavior Moby posted a response Friday on his official website the truth is that I honestly
an all sincerity thought that the whole Eminem thing was done in some semblance of humor until
Eminem called me a pussy off camera and then threatened to beat me up oh well I think that Eminem
has tell them interesting but I'm kind of scound at the angry ads for me seeing as I never made
them up up with them till last night. Ask backstage what he thought about the Eminem Moby feud
show host Jimmy Fallon said well some people just don't like each other what are you gonna do I
didn't like my neighbor in college met a profound response yeah he's waiting pretty weak
hey they reran that the other day ask me if I watched it did you watch it no no in fact as soon
as I saw it my channel automatically changed all by itself you would have liked that Shakira
performance I I love Shakira in spite of your negative comments about her we got 13 quick votes
the poll is up already nice work there erotic air expect to let businesses usual now he understands
that day is today all the fall to all ends Georgian could have beyond for a while now until my next
sick day which could be anytime now actually I feel great and you notice how I don't sound like
about thanks a lot grammar for that great doctor and by the way don't call me anymore from your
planes I'm not even gonna discuss that I'm not gonna talk about his call the other day oh come on
thanks to the huh oh come on no because if I rip him then he won't buy you lunch oh of course if
I don't remember he's still not gonna buy you right but anyway thanks for that doctor I don't
want to talk about him I'd rather talk about her because she's great but you think I'd
have mentioned her name on here I don't know I won't okay doctor Hamft no no seriously she's
sensational she's over at Holy Cross she used to be at the Cleveland Clinic and I think the fact
she got out of there and went off on her own I think that speaks very well for because you know
what I think of the Cleveland Clinic oh god I don't want to say it on a year do you have any idea
well you probably don't because you can't feel my elbow and if you were here wouldn't let you
get my elbow in and you wouldn't want to but seriously just the one ice treatment it makes me feel
so guy damn stupid and there's nothing worth it being stupid you know I should know because
just the one 15 minute deal so I'm assuming that like after three or four more treatments I'm
gonna feel like brand new here's a show speaking at TV shows in case you don't want to watch the
15-3 run of the MTV Music Awards and you don't want to watch more reruns of the soprano
news season starts the 17th is when it's not too couple of weeks away right yes two weeks from
today this is by Glenn Garvin in today's Harold boy I can't believe I got a couple of
her old stories right off the bat where was God on 9-11 program as now do you remember the day after
like on the 12th or the 13th of the September last year and I asked that very same question right
and some people were pissed off that I was asking how dare you I mean how can you be so insensitive
and what are your usual anti-religion well I think it's a very legitimate question
and come to find out it's so legitimate that PBS tonight has got a two hour show on it how do you
like that called front line faith and doubt at ground zero once again showing that as usual
is way ahead this time almost a year ahead of the rest of the pack so many stories have been
written and broadcast wondering where the CIA and the FBI were on September 11th now front line
asked a different more wrenching question where was God how could adjust God a merciful God
a permitted the slaughter of 3,000 people could the hijackers have been right could God have been on
their side don't expect these answers when answers at all the existence of evil in the face of
an omniscient and omnipotent God has racked religious faith since the beginning of time faith
and doubt at ground zero is not the sort of tidy inspirational package you'll find on the books
through a self-help shop it's something much more rare journalism that examines without
derision or condescension troubling questions of religious faith dispensing almost completely
with narration faith would what I say with narration faith and doubt explores its subject through
interviews with victims and survivors relatives and strangers security guards and operatives
Christians Muslims Jews and Buddhists don't say anything about atheists the most anguished
reactions not surprising it came from those who lost loved ones they range from the quite alienation
of woman who are haltingly whispers that since her mother's death she no longer has conversations
with God to the raging accusation of the father of a farmer who perished inside one of the towers
I let lucid God he recounts angually I fired all of my barrels at him it might sound crazy but I
cursed him I damned him I look at him now as a barbarian God damn it but it is nearly as
agonizing the oppressed and rabbis tell of these spreading fault lines in their faith since 9-11 says
a rabbi rejecting stories of survivors who claim their salvation was part of God's plan if you're
going to tell me about how the plan saved you you have there also be able to explain how the plan
killed them and the loneliest cry of all comes from a Middle East historian who says that the
rapturous celebration of death by the 9-11 hijackers and their supporters demolished the foundation
of his atheism and left him tumbling into a void it took my belief in the one last foundation
of everything in the human race he said huh I know I don't I know the don't ask questions okay
I'm sorry it's in the herald curiously many of the people interviewed for faith and doubt
found solace and even religious reaffirmation one of 9-11's most shattering images the man and
women who a woman who left hand in hand from a burning tower is that left her leaped leopard
if everything were capable of against horror and loss and tragedy to be constantly as Brian
Doyle still lost in awe at the memory it's what must be believed that we're not fools to believe in
God huh his words ring with an eloquence that suffuses faith and doubt even the breakdowns
offer soprano Renee Fleming describing how she's saying amazing grace at the world trade
center memorial service shortly after the attacks admitted with the first time in life she couldn't
look at her audience for fear she'd go to pieces then with a shy half smile she apologizes to the
cameraman I'm gonna cry now she says a year later for short on answers we still have plenty of tears
writes the review of Glenn Garvin so it's on 9-11 on PBS and I'm gonna watch it aren't you

is the usual you notice I waited like a little a little passage of time so the audience would
come back I mean so that we you know and every year after George does the summer shows we take
a little survey about how did George do I know I'm gonna vote I think he did pretty damn good not
spectacular but pretty damn good better than ever before and getting better every damn show
thank you separate those awful calls which are never gonna get better but nevertheless so we'll
take that you know and subject George to some abuse from the audience especially those assholes
that want to like beat up on him he doesn't care anymore he knows you're a bunch of morons he's
medallaria he does those appearances it's my job it's his job at least at the moment right that's
what most said of course don't forget you're being held in perpetual right in fact even the hostages
in a ran word hold as long as you've been held well as a quick pro quo for not firing George the
growing consensus against circumcision by Jackie Smith and the national post here in Toronto a
just in time for me not to care anymore the growing consensus against circumcision I hope you'll
start pronouncing that properly now it's against again her just 30 years ago male circumcision was
all the rage as many as 90 percent of boys in the US 70 percent of those in Australia 48 percent
in Canada and 24 percent of the UK were circumcised often without any anesthesia I can remember the
war that waged in my own mind when my son was born in the 1980s he writes is it he or she well
whatever the hell it is I had no religious reasons for choosing circumcision I wasn't trying to
guard against unhealthy masturbation as early proponents of circumcision or I hate the unhealthy
kind oh that's the worst I didn't care if he looked like dead as some parents do I wanted no
only one thing would it be best for him medically if he wasn't circumcised would I be responsible
for increasing his chances of urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted disease as some
physicians had suggested would it mean he might need the operation later in life when circumcision
is more uncomfortable not to mention unpleasant and god damn it hurts can you imagine
you know all the guys that we've talked to like were circumcised when they were like 40 20 oh I
can't imagine what if he had the operation got an infection he or she asked what if the
nice slip how would I live with myself more importantly how would he live with himself
it's the nature of parenting you always think what could I have done better so once I made a
decision I worried over whether it was the right one like all parents I tried to act in the best
interest of my child when the Canadian pediatric society reviewed the medical literature and came
out against routine circumcision in 1996 I thought the matter was settled the CPS looked at the
effect of newborn circumcision on the rate of urinary tract infections sexually transmitted diseases
cancer of the penis pinile problems and decided the practice was inadvisable this was in line with
the recommendation made earlier by its fetus and newborn committee I bet you didn't know that the
Canadian pediatric society had a fetus and newborn committee I do know do now and with 1971 and 75
recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics nevertheless debates about the ethics of
circumcision remain unresolved because of its connection to religion and culture because medical
studies sometimes turn up different results and because parents do think their kids should look like
dead yeah I heard that you wouldn't get it he looks just like dead if you don't believe me whip it
out anyway Jackie goes on to say still I believe it consensus against circumcision is steadily
emerging against in this new era of patient rights circumcision has come to seem like an
anachronism among doctors there's a greater emphasis on informed decision making the limits on
parents rights to make the scenes about their kids health and the rights of children to be protected
from parents who make wrong decisions well how do you protect yourself against parents who made
the decision when you were like a few days old you use the pointy stick I see even some adult men who
were unnecessarily circumcised as children are asserting their rights to restitution I heard about
them and since the balance of medical evidence suggests those who oppose circumcision have the
facts on their side doctors are increasing will be fusing to perform circumcision complications
from bleeding amputation oh my god renal failure steps and death are powerful incentives to stop what
is steps is huh with the death of an infant in BC in British Columbia possibly as a result of
circumcision and currently under coroner's investigation there will be more questions of circumcision's
benefits and risks with a more pronounced focus on the latter parents who opt for circumcision must
as a matter of both law and morals make the decision based on the principle of respect for the rights
and best interest of their child according to the available information concerning risks and
benefits the death of the cam loops baby may bring new awareness about the risk of circumcision
though the baby's death may ultimately turn out to have risen from something far more complicated
than a botched circumcision and believe you me there is nothing there are a few things in the
world worse than a botched circumcision and I've seen the evidence of a few really oh you're not
lying I've seen the evidence of a few oh my god indeed the media coverage of the incident may
speed circumcision for non-religious reasons and the dustbin of medical practice alongside many
other ones popular procedures such as the removal of the ovaries for hysteria what now the removal
of ovaries for hysteria calm you down time select me for a sore throat lobotomy for mental
read art a retardation etc just ask jack Nicholson and achieve in a few years looking like that are
wanting to keep a boy clean may no longer be legally legitimate rationales for circumcision it's
about time they weren't says Jackie parents who've had their kid circumcised can't be faulted
for doing what they thought was right but it's unethical to continue a practice that is no longer
medically defensible and could harm our kids how do you like that a lawsuit wow lawsuit I'm
suing my father because he's dead okay well that's what that club kept proposing the I wish I had
my foreskin club yeah were they're trying to go it back nice say the hell would as far
choose without rest and choose okay let him go pick some more cotton and then we'll think about it
but as far as those of us who have had our foreskins taken away we want it back now
in fact some guy asked me that over the weekend I said he said what are you doing I said just
trying to get my foreskin back if I can't get mine I'll borrow yours did he let you anyway
you know this is a horrible story about this Reese guy dying yeah no is that incredible no they'll
never have they'll never know closure they will never have closure they'll never have the definitive
answer the widow of the man police said with their top potential suspect oh they see now that he's
dead they said he was a suspect oh in the unsolved Elizabeth smart kidnapping said authorities
were investigating the wrong man Angela Reese took her husband Richard Albert Reese you off life
support Friday night he had suffered a massive brain hemorrhage Tuesday and Utah State
prison where he been serving time at a parole violation and never regain consciousness and now he's
dead when Angela Reese arrived at the hospital to the next he knew that her husband wasn't going to wake
up the minute I saw him I just know what he looks like when he was asleep and he was just gone she said
Reese 48 died about 12 minutes after life support machines were turned off
Angela Reese he said the stress of being wrongly linked to Elizabeth smart abduction contributed
to his death do I smell lawsuit coming I think I can smell it if he had been in home I think this
wouldn't have happened she said Angela Reese 38 married Reese on Valentine's Day after brother
introduced them Reese 8 Perouli told Angela he wasn't going to return to his criminal ways she said
we all have a past she said adding that she had not worried at all about introducing Reese to
her 11 year old son she described her husband as a kind man who loved to cook and play the guitar
Reese who she said she called Rick would often pack a sack lunch for her to take to her job as a
receptionist would add a note saying have a nice day honey I felt more safe with Rick than I've
ever felt with anyone in my life she said yesterday Elizabeth's father Ed smart had repeatedly said
he felt Reese he had a partner's daughter's disappearance he had made several televised
police for Reese to cooperate with police Reese he had worked as a handyman in the smart
husband's accused of seeing Adams from their home yada yada yada after Reese's death the smart
family issued a statement expressing heartfelt condolences to his widow heartfelt you believe it
I feel it so there you go I think this is not saying of course the media love this because now
it's open for conjecture for like forever did he do it did he not do it as you know and they
can have like 85 many series on it like Jean-Bene and Jay something like that 956 at 560 W

and they'll also eat cat crap you want to get me started on that anyway I look it's getting too
close to lunchtime or brunch or something like that I don't want to start talking about the
feces eating habits of dogs because believe me if anybody knows I think golden retrievers that's
one of their specialties that's why they call them retrievers but anyway look I mean why did
you bring that up she just brought it up the how I did the dog brought it up and then eat it again

tell you I'm starting uh what is it two weeks from yesterday September 16 guiding light moves to 10
m the pressing 114 votes that are pulled today what would you be doing a week from tomorrow September
11 living my life as usual 81 hiding out of the bed 17 taking a commercial flight six
five percent of this audience is going to be flying a week from tomorrow we buy in that oh no
watching TV all day so I can waddle in the misery of last year six and traveling by car train or bus
four as a matter of fact news day says people are divided on the September 11th holiday
Americans are divided about whether nine leavens should be a national holiday like veterans day
or memorial day according to a new pool isn't it great all the pools that I mean we take our pool
on our website because it's just there and it's easy but just amazing to me the pools that they
take support for a national holiday on that date the terrorist attack the world train center in
New York and the Pentagon has slipped a bit since March according to a CNN time pool released
Sunday while 44 percent favor the idea 51 are opposed to a down from a 48 48 tie in March
you're following us write these numbers down okay very crucial crap the telephone pool of a
thousand four adults was conducted Wednesday and Thursday of last week and has an error margin of
plus or minus three points put that like an asterisk next to it okay the pool also found that a third
of the people said they feel less safe in public places and slightly more said they feel less safe
traveling since 9-11 you know something at this point because I you know I fly quite a bit I
don't even think about it in fact when I came back up here at Miami International and by the way
I see men's they were really great you'll be pleased that all you suck whole you idiot you old
funny dirty fool but they so after I go through the thing she you know my luck they may not like me
you know although spick baggage inspectors so I go through the whole screening thing and no
problem and I pick up my bag and I'm like wandering along in the woman you know the last gas woman
advice like they got the bomb what do they call that thing what do they call it it's like a
bond detector you know it's got like a little thing on it's got she's got like a little wand and on
the end of it there's like a cloth it's a bomb detecting machine so she wants my bag so she's
looking in the bag and she's waving a thing right and then she has me sit down and take off my shoes
yeah it didn't bother me at least I said done I handed her the shoes she poched me around with
them she she handed him to the shoe shine guy which is a good way for him to get an extra couple
of bucks and then she gave him back to me and I was there didn't phase me in the least in fact uh
you know what's a big deal with that and I don't sit there looking around at the other you know
those first few months after 9-11 all of us everyone who everyone I don't care how much of a
lot of you are you'll have to admit when you got on a plane when you were sitting in the boarding
area at the gate you were looking around oh that one looks like a terrorist right oh and I'm
definitely not getting on a fat ass hold you know that kind of thing sure and even on that flight
I told you about coming back from Amsterdam the guy that kept running into the toilet
you remember that right that Dutch guy he kept running every then he'd go to the toilet be in there
for like 10 minutes he'd come back and his head would start bobbing around and he'd go back into
again maybe he was puking I don't know maybe he was in there so long because he was puking and then
checking it out again like that dog have you ever seen a dog do that to you yeah yes I have oh
see how we stop my dogs from doing that and maybe maybe I shouldn't no you should maybe it's
you should maybe it's like you know a second-day spaghetti maybe it's not so bad
support forever let's hear what we did that uh third today feel less safe in public places
almost a third said that the word that a terrorist attack will occur on the anniversary of 9-11
people who are most likely to say an attack and like to tell a month will be carried out with a car
truck carrying a bomb or with biological or chemical weapons and two-thirds said the nation's
intelligence gathering agencies failed in their responsibilities to get information about the
attacks how do you like that two-thirds you think and don't you recall like a year ago that we're
saying was the greatest intelligence failure of the U.S. of A I remember that but of course we're
supposed that was short memory speaking that editor says bin Laden's alive and command and in command
the editor of a London-based Arabic language daily newspapers son they repeated his claim that
Osama Yamada bin Laden is alive and edited that he's now back in charge of the al-Qaeda terrorist
network obdel barri at one editor of al-Qud stole ABC this week he hasn't seen bin Laden and has
no physical evidence the al-Qaeda leader is alive but sources told me he's alive and that he's
in command at one be saying in July at one told CNN sources uh bin Laden was wounded in the
bombing of Torah Borin had strapped out in his left shoulder he was injured and he was subject
to a surgery and the strapped out was removed from his left shoulder and now he's perfectly well
at one said he told ABC he believes bin Laden's alive because it is unislamic not to declare his
death if he's dead and out one said al-Qaeda's issued list of its members who've been killed and the
list have not included bin Laden's name there's not been a videotape of bin Laden recently because he's
waiting for the right moment out one said in addition to which they had those doggy snuff films
why should they waste stuff with them you know he was criticized heavily by other Islamic
organizations that he's managing a lot of things and when it comes to delivery he doesn't deliver
out one said so we'd like to come out when he does something or his organization actually carries
out an attack and after that maybe he'll come out with a tape to prove that he's really behind it
any july and if you all want city of not seen bin Laden doesn't know where he is I don't think
anybody knows actually where he is maybe if an american with the latest equipment with you know
the best of communication the best buying war planes they can't spot him you think uh you know
who would be able to do so we said in other words if we can't fight him who the hell can
of course we also can't fight a rass with both hands that's our problem you know
isn't it on patriotic to say that yes it is i'm glad i didn't say it
comey oh speaking about patriotic and comey is jeb bush appeals to venturo over cubatrip
citing a lack of bait oh and you noticed that the McBride is catching Janet in the poll yes good thank
god yeah all right we might actually have a candidate against Bush who might have like an
outside like a minimal chance to win oh please oh isn't responsible for all the affaders of the
DCF citing a lack of basic freedoms in cuba governor bushmeister urged Minnesota governor
Jesse Ventura to reconsider his plans to attend a trade exposition there next month while i
don't expect you to cancel your trip i strongly believe doing so i'd be the right thing to do
bush said in letter date of dog is point out the Ventura you don't think he's pandering anybody do
yeah no thank god i encourage you to consider other options as you look for opportunity to expand
international trade for your state but a spokesman for ventura said the minnesota governor did not
agree with bush's isolationist approach and would not alter his plans oh ventura will help promote
the sale of cuba to cuba of minnesota produce food and agricultural products at the u.s. food and

organizes predict 18 to 20 thousand people attend the expo and then more than 150 companies
organizations and government offices from 30 states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico will
participate oh you don't want to go this reconcert Ventura's announcement brought a swift response
from his counterpart in florida home to a large cuban exile community opposed to trade with the
commie pinco nation president bush's brother urgventurative iran minduring his trip to cuba
that cuban president fidel castrow denies the eleven million cuban people rights that minnesota's
and political independent ventura taker granted speaking out against government policies fighting

in enemy of the revolution and then similarly thrown in jail money made from the trade will be
used by castrow in the cuban government to finance his oppressive regime and ensure its continued

governor continued he urged the former wrestler to meet with dissidents during his trip
john woald a ls. spokesman for for ventura said the governor will proceed with his trip to cuba
and bafan gulla the jama even say that on a personal level he likes governor bush but he
happens to disagree with the governor's hard-line positions he believes that building a strong
economic relationship will do a whole lot more to build government and culture reforms than
the isolationist approach that governor bush endorses like his brother i think i like why i'm not

I came down here after losing my child, but to be a big fish in a little pond. When they kicked me off the SP and they told me don't come back again.
I had some problems with wise guys who advised I moved to paradise. Oh, yeah. Fire. That's very clearly all the way nice.
I got a little funny. You're a fire. I hope that's just as much nice. I hope he dies. I hope you all die.
I'm a big fish in a little pond to see you. A big fish in a little pond.
1033 at 560 W.D. Kim. What is the book of Brian Pinnon all summer? He must be doing some really good crap.
You know what I mean? Yeah, I know what you mean. Is he sharing the pocket? No, he doesn't share. Oh, he can tuck it. Now what is Wicca?
Wich is? Is that what that is? Modern, which is, it's the word that Wich is that Wich comes from.
See, I knew if anybody would know the answer that would be George since he's an expert on all this crap. The crap expert.
By the way, how does it Glenn Garntey doing? Who? The Kentucky Department of Corrections has suspended formal
satanic worship service at the Green River Correctional Complex while officials worked to shape a statewide
policy on a practice about Tony Crowwood. Inmates at Green River, a medium security prison in central
city had been allowed to hold weekly satanic services this summer as part of the official religious
services calendar said Lisa Carnahan had corrections spokeswoman. We honestly didn't know it was on a
religious calendar. Carnahan said after the Lexington Harold leader questioned the practice where we searching it to see what we're
required to allow into the law, but we found information that indicates that satanic services could be a
could be a threat to the institutions. So for now, we won't aid or abet satanic worship. Well, thank God for that.
Under federal law and US Supreme Court decisions, correctional institutions may not prohibit the exercise of
inmates religious freedom as long as the practice of the recognized religions is not compromised the safety
of other inmates or the staff said Joe Whedon managed the government affairs for American Correctional
Association. Satanic services were suspended through the Green River after the newspapers inquiry.
Inmates of at least two of the states, 14 other prisons practice satanism on their own. Carnahan said,
and what does that mean? Do they like they like nail a chicken to the outside of their cell door?
Something like that. Carnahan said the state has not suspended Wicked Services which also
were held at Green River and three other prisons. Wicked practices which craft, but these
to divine an every element of nature. We don't have any materials that indicate that Wicked
are compromising the safety of the institutions. Carnahan said, see, haven't I always said that anybody
who believes that any religion should be an institution? Haven't I always said that? Oh, yeah.
Should the issue arose at Green River a few months ago when one inmates sought permission to
practice satanism. Whoredon Patty Web decided it was safer to give inmates a specific time and
place to worship where they'd be monitored rather than letting them practice among themselves on the
prison yard. Carnahan said, only two inmates showed up last week for the satanic services at Green
River. Kentucky officials have learned that policies in other states vary. For example, prison
officials in Texas were 150 inmates say they follow satanism for prohibit the services.
We've looked at these satanic Bible and they're convinced that one of the advocates would put
our prisons a risk safety wise said Donald Casper chaplain from the Texas system. One of their
tenants is revenge. If somebody hurts you, hurt them back. Like they said in the Godfather,
they hit us. We hit them back. We hit Bruno Tatar, you three o'clock this morning. We didn't say
he didn't think the numbers had been compiled on how many inmates across the US practice satan. Isn't that
pathetic? Isn't that tragic? Isn't that typical? Or the US survey, it's yours. Now you fasted me this
thing about the funny you should practice while funny somebody should send it or it's from the BBC
about the diabetes monitor, the tax on monitoring, I think. Because I saw a story on it yesterday.
And of course being an old diabetic myself, I sat up in a chair and I looked at it and
scientists are doing this device may end the need for a skin prick test. Right. Man,
and there are a few things more painful than that skin prick. Not really. I've been doing that
for 15 years. I've been pricking my fingers. And I didn't feel like anything. It just
felt like a prick. Exactly. I couldn't say better myself.
See now he's setting up his own stuff. I love that. That's what happens when you put him on
all summer, man. He's starting to set up his own crap. That was good though. Scientists are
developing a smart tattoo that could tell the evidence when their glucose levels are dangerously low.
See, I have a problem that you want to know why? Why? I don't want to generalize, but it would
seem to me that your glucose level might be dangerously low like when you're in bed sleeping.
Right. I mean, I can even have a night. You're not going to be looking at your tattoo while you're
you know, cutting z's, three o'clock in the morning. Neither are you going to be pricking your finger
or taking your blood to a level. It would also mean that that is, but it's no longer
have to subject themselves to the finger prick devices that currently they must use every day.
The tattoo has been designed. You know something? I don't care. Unless it was accurate.
It was fluorescence levels could be measured using a device such as a watch that would also
give users a read out of their glucose level. When they get that, then I'll get it.
Preliminary studies in tattooed rancid have been given injections of glucose. Have you
heard promising results? Regular tattoos consist of ink particles that are taken up by the cells
in the skin. In this case, polymer molecules are injected on the skin using a needle.
Because the molecules are slightly bigger than ink particles, they don't enter the cells,
but they remain in interstitial fluid that surrounds them. I would also love to have
that word, the interstitial fluid. Dr. Kote said this is important because the level glucose
in the interstitial fluid is directly related to blood glucose. Whereas the glucose inside the
cells would be nearly nonexistent because it's almost immediately converted to energy.
A spokesman for the cheerity diabetes UK, oh this is a British story, BBC. Of course.
Said people with diabetes need to test their glucose levels on a regular basis.
And for most people, this means pricking their finger to draw blood. A pain-free testing system
is something of a holy grail. How about that BB King spot? I'm leaving a pain behind.
Yeah. I sure do. I'm so tired. I see that spot one more time. I may have to shoot him in the
bit and they can find that. That BB King. What does it call? I don't know.
On that thing you said is in the DCS about circumcision not in mine. Really? What does it call?
My foreskin's back. No. With a fore. Oh it's spelled with a fore like I said it's like I wrote.
Well, how can I? Okay. My mistake. Another mistake.
Listen to it ahead. We had a little problem there at the beginning today because this is just a dry run.
Okay. We got 155 votes on the survey and an hour that's pretty weak right there.
See? We're trying to get the audience back after a long hot summer, after a Labor Day weekend,
after the kids are back in school. Are they back? No.
What would you be doing on September the 11th? We asked in our poll on theoranges.com today.
Living my life as usual, 115. Blood here for those people are putting me. That's what I voted.
I'm sure that's what George voted. Yes. Because he'll be working on that day or else
hiding under the bed, 20, watching TV all day so I can wallow in the memory and the misery of last year,
nine, taking a commercial flight, seven and traveling by car trainer bus four, seven brave soul.
You know something if that's true, we have no way of knowing. But if that's true, I respect those
people a lot, you know, even if they're morons. Sure. In fact, maybe that's why they're going because
they're morons. Well, good luck to you folks. Okay, because you'll need it. See, what I'm worried
about is not so much another terrorist attack on planes because I don't think that's what they're
going to do it again. Right. I'm worried that like because it's going to be 9-11 and we have so many
assholes in this country, somebody is going to, you know, do something crazy on a flight next week.
These stupid ass copycats. Right. You know, like like their shoe on fire or some crap.
10-40, 20-before-level, we got Jim Man did did one, we got Hank from the Crystal Palisid three,
briefly, because 4-35, we got the Marlins and Metz double header. Anybody excited about that? No.

And go there is a party girl's luck party girl's luck party girl's luck
Party girls
My
Ladies guys
please
please
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on, I'm a sponsor, a good girl who wants to be a media hall, and prefers it on top
Quibba.
You want more?
I want this lady?
Here's what I'll give you.
She's got a book to read about Slandering.
Nobody knows more about Slandering out with a big scoop of spout than he wants in the
left of Mangala.
Such a good, Christian girl.
You want to strangle her.
Fontypigating who she's hating.
Political pond, it's ontypigating.
She's a federalist, emote.
Making liberalism, earning money, you know, in a miniser Joe and Cameldo.
Ascozor knows what take can be in a miniser than Spellfishy.
She's a tall drink of water on the side of a large order with a back alley hook.
If you like your drug dollar, if you got the money, she'll spread those legs with a cigarette
and a sharp face and culture and culture, political mongolettes.
The angel of the right energy is easy.
So, speaking of that bitch, yes, this fax you just sent me, which is great.
Do we know where this is?
The Center Daily News?
No, I do not.
Oh, well, that's what this was in, and maybe somebody will let us know.
The Center Daily Times has the name of the publication.
Anyway, it's editor's file, an open letter to Anne Colter.
It says, dear Anne Colter, you're fired.
It's not that extreme viewpoints are unwelcome on the opinion pages of Center Daily Times.
All political viewpoints from Cal Thomas on the right to Molly Ivans on the left are welcome here.
But we don't welcome Hader as Anne, and that's what you are.
Well, you're either a Hader or a Hempichry who calls names and spews enmity
because you believe it gets your pretty face on television more
or sell copies of your bestselling books.
In either case, we won't be publishing your Friday columns anymore.
We decided not to publish a piece of yours a few weeks back
because it was nothing more than a sexual history of some of your enemies,
i.e. private citizens who dared to give money to the Democrats.
I wrote a column about why we held the piece and told readers
that if you continued to cross the line, we'd can you.
Your Friday column in which you declare that liberals are no good
then trash the entire Kennedy clan as a collection of heroin addicts,
convicted killers, cheaters, bootleggers, and disillusioned drums crossed that line.
I'm not going to defend the Kennedy family or liberals.
Either group can argue with you if they like, but Anne, you're mean, vicious, really,
which is why we do not believe that you in any way serve the public good.
On the late summer morning, almost a year ago,
all of us Republicans, Democrats, and everyone else witnessed what hate is capable of.
Since that day, Americans have tried to remember that they're on the same side,
regardless of differences in skin color, nation of origin, religion, or political viewpoint.
It hasn't always been easy because more than ever, those who are different can see more threatening.
But we're trying because what we have in America is worth keeping.
And Anne, you're not helping. You do nothing to elevate our spirits
to celebrate the great bond that holds us, this unruly people together, and makes this a nation.
Hate is easy, love is hard.
Our great nation gives you the freedom to hate all you want
and even make a buck off it if you can, but even better, it gives us the right not to have to listen.
So Anne, you're fired.
I expect some of our readers are going to be mad at us over this,
but we hope they'll understand that while we joyfully publish a wide spectrum of political and social viewpoints,
we condemn hate where we find it.
You won't miss us much, Anne. Heck, you're rolling in money,
and your fans can find your column on the Internet anyway.
We'll start looking for somebody to replace you. It won't be easy,
because you sure are flashy and lots of folks like flashy,
but political conservators has produced other columnists of merit whose ideas will provide subjects fit for public consumption and debate.
Writers who don't believe those who disagree with them are traders or worse,
sincerely Bob Unger Executive Director of the Center of the Daily News. How do you like that?
You go Bob. How do I go on Bob, baby? That bitch.
So all we can say about Anne Colter, man, that we can put on a year,
is a fucking bitch.
And that's the compliment.
Here's an interesting article. You know, I'm not, I see I have all this stuff here,
and so many days this stuff that the audience sends in here,
but that's okay. Keep it coming, guys, as interesting or even more so,
and kills a lot of good time.
Bush by the numbers is told by a diligent scorekeeper. This is by Danny Millbank in today's Washington Post.
President Bush's trip to Pittsburgh yesterday was his 13th to Pennsylvania since taking office,
his third to the Pittsburgh area, his second Labor Day appearance with a Carpenters Union,
and his 72nd domestic trip overall. How do we know this?
There's only one source, Mark Norder, the leading collector of modern presidential, our, our, our canna.
How many foreign leaders has Bush met with? Norder's got an 136.
How many states has Bush visited so far? Norder's got it 43.
How long did Bush's round of golf last on July 6? Nol's got it two and a half hours.
The 50-year-old CDS News Radio correspondent has been covering the White House on an offence
to the Ford Administration in every day for the past 11 years,
collects data about presidential activities as if it were baseball trivia.
The bearded off and cramudginly Norder can be found in the press filing center on most every presidential trip.
His centurion voice booming out 35 second takes for radio as many as 20 a day,
and shaping the day's news for dozens of journalists who can't help but hear him.
When he's not recording one of the more than 10,000 radio spots he's done over the past decade,
he spends hours of week updating his famous statistical logs.
Other reporters, economics to rely on them.
The Clinton White House even asked Norder for his logs, turns out the newsman kept better track of President Clinton's travel
than the president's AIDS did.
These statistics, Norder, resembles produced many revealing portraits of the Bush presidency.
Bush has spent a total of a whopping total of 250 days of his presidency of Camp Dave in 123,
Kennebunkport 12, and his Texas ranch 115.
This means that Bush has spent 42% of his term so far at one of his three leisure destinations.
To date, the president has devoted four more time to gole 15 rounds than the solo news conference is six.
The numbers also show that Bush, after holding three news conferences in his first four months,
has had only three and more in the last 15 months, not counting the 37 Q&A sessions he's had with four leaders during his term.
Bush has raised $114.28 million this year at 48 A.G.O.P. event, surpassing Clinton's record of 105 million in 2000 from 203 events,
the Bush White House has challenged his tally only once and Norder accounted with voluminous evidence the judge's decision is final, he says.
Norder got a job out of NYU in 1975 with Associated Press Radio covering the last few months of Ford and also taking stints during the Carter and Reagan administrations.
After moving to CBS in 1988, he covered last year of the first president Bush and just about every day since.
Unmarried him without children, he takes almost every presidential trip and rarely stops working.
I find when I take a day off and take so much time to get up to speed, I'd rather work at me easier on myself, sir.
Just like us George.
Oh yeah.
Answer reporter, nearly rarely breaks news.
There's no time to do investigative journalism when you're filing 20 times a day,
but he exerts influence in another way, his powerful voice, inescapable to those within 50 yards of him,
summarizes every speech or briefing within moments for other White House correspondents.
Norder's voice, booming out of his quick and woody, takes on the day's story, unconsciously settles into all our brains,
and no doubt finds its way into our copies at Ron Fornier, the chief AP White House correspondent.
He may be the most influenced on respected reporter in the press court.
Do you ever hear of him?
No.
Neither do I.
In addition to his impressive volume is his briefcase full of presidential stats.
Norder walks around with a thick vanilla folder with printouts of his logs,
which he also keeps on disks in a mainframe computer.
For eight years, he's kept a log of every day of the president's schedule down to the smallest detail,
probably even as long as B.M.s as well.
I'm sure.
August 6th indicates that Bush arrives at the airport near his ranch with spot Barney and India in a pet carrier.
Norder even notes that the cat indicted not get to join the two dogs on Marine One.
During the Bush administration, which practices the none of your business theory of public disclosure,
the logs have become even more valuable.
They don't want to talk about the strategy themselves, but they reveal it by what they do,
said the keeper of the stats.
Consider, for example, the seventh state's Bush has not visited.
His absence from Washington, Vermont, Rhode Island, and Hawaii might indicate that Republicans have written off those states.
His absence in Idaho and Kansas suggests those safely, a GOP states don't require his presence.
And his absence from Nevada might indicate concern about local anger over his plan to ship nuclear waste there.
Bush's pattern of foreign travel, assembly intriguing for President who frowns on the intercontinental set.
Bush has visited 18 countries and the Vatican would line overseas trips, keeping pace with Clinton,
who took eight trips to 26 countries during his first two years, although he probably knew where the countries were on the map.
Many of the reporters who borrow Norder's numbers, time without crediting him, believe the veteran correspondents,
performing a crucial public service.
I do this for me, not the public either.
I wouldn't be so modest to think of this as a great interest.
I have a lot of the time. I have difficulty even convincing my editors.
Time for golf, baby.
How about a couple of rounds?
You know what I say about people who play golf?
Yeah, no.
No life.
Good way to kill some time, though, you know what I'm saying?
For people who are really bored, spit list.
The E.A. now, haven't I been telling you, especially of all people, that you're helping terrorism with all those drugs you're doing?
Great.
Federal authorities have a vast evidence for the first time that an illegal operation in the US was funneling proceeds to Middle East terrorist groups like Hezbollah.
Evidence gathered by the DEA since a series of raids in January indicates that a methamphetamine drug operation in the Midwest involving men of Middle East in the Senate has been shipping money back to terrorist groups official.
So we found one.
All right.
I don't do math.
There is increasing intelligence information from the investigation that for the first time alleged drug sales in the US are going in part to support terrorist organizations in the Middle East, the E.A. Administrator asked whole Hutchinson said on Friday.
The E.A. official said the men, most of them were more indebted on drug charges after their January arrest were smuggling large quantities of chemical pseudo fed green from Canada into the Midwest.
Oh, not from Canada.
Oh, there's a guy with some out on the street there.
Look at that.
He's peddling it.
Spare some change, eh?
Oh, yeah, Joan, his buddies love that.
Officials said the smuggling went through two primary Midwest locations Chicago and Detroit and involved several men with ties to Jordan.
Yemen.
What's the name of that country?
Lebanon, another Middle East country.
There's no evidence that any of the money was connected to the 9-11 terrorist attack, however, officials be saying.
Sudo fed green is used in some popular cold and allergy medications.
It's an essential ingredient in the creation of meth amphetamine, a power plant, creasingly popular drug known on the streets as ice, poor man's cocaine or crystal meth.
And if you spill it, oh, what a meth.
Users generally injector smoke meth.
The power.
I shouldn't have said that.
Now every time I say it, I feel like a little more fruity than usual.
User, huh?
No, you don't be saying meth a guy who's fags again about your foodie, yes, speech.
User generally injector smoke meth.
The powder acceptance is produced by heating a dozen chemicals.
The US drug ring was reselling pseudo fed green to Mexican based drug operations in the Western US that used the pseudo fed green to produce methamphetamine authorities be saying.
The Middle East demand that we're diverting some of the proceeds from the pseudo fed green sales back to the Middle East where council authorities have begun to connect to terrorist groups, the official said.
Some of the connections involved in the Iranian back terror group has been brought and some of the money has been traced to a constant Lebanon and the Yamann official said.
The E.A. official said US authorities don't know yet how much money was funneled from the drug sales and the terrorist groups but said the pseudo fed reads sales a lot amounted to millions of dollars.
So all your people out there with a joint, you're helping out terrorism.
Okay, even though I have nothing to do with this.
Don't confuse them with the facts.
I think I'm going to ice my arm again during the show.
All right, because that helped.
No, it really didn't help the lot.
I think it can use like another shot right now.
Can't hurt 184 votes on our poll.
What will you be doing a week from tomorrow 9-11?
And believe me, the media is going to get you whipped up into a psychotic frenzy whether you want to be or not.

So in other words, 10 are going to fly because they figure at least if they're going to risk their life might as well do it high in the sky.
Right on.
Might have held not.

Hey, kid, baby.
He cut it away quite liberally when I was circumcised.
Somehow a group back on me amazingly overnight.
My force gets back after hanging like a fruit fly.
More and more and more, my force gets back like a boost and everything's fine.
More and more and more, my force gets back after getting cut way short.
Now I'm hung like a racer and I'm very free.
Rapp I cut me down the side.
Ow.
I'm a big man now that I grew back over my thumb.
It's a B.T.T.
My force gets back with a boil cause we trouble.
More and more and more, my force gets back.
I pull a full big and fast the size is almost double.
More and more and more, my force gets back.
Yay, my force gets back now.
I'm thinking they built in the burrow now.
I'm looking back and now I'm a bigger red.
I'm looking like an elephant trunk now.
So you're seeing the thing about McDonald's is cutting the trans fatty acids in the fries.
I feel better now.
I'm sure they're the ones who affects their fries and all their other fried foods.
And I got a man with a McDonald's hand in his hand.
Good morning there.
They're showing the meat you're having.
They're making it really good.
I don't know if they're eating it.
You don't let me finish.
I don't know if it'll taste better.
That was the question.
Yeah, if it's low fat.
But I guess you'll find out.
I sure will.
McDonald's to reduce fat and fries.
And by saying that they're going to reduce trans fatty fats.
Trans fats by 48%.
They're admitting that they're killing you.
So that big sign and amsterdam over the original McDonald's that some wives and
punks put up their seismic death many years ago and is still hanging there.
They knew what they were talking about.
So that's what we all knew that.
That's what they call it a deep fat fryer.
No, most people don't know that.
I'll get out.
All people though, including the Dutch who should know better by the way,
is that they like the taste of it.
Okay.
And Bill, what's his name?
What's that punk on CNN?
Bill, whatever, Hummer.
This morning was talking about, oh, he likes to slather mayonnaise on his own.
And he's like, oh, he likes to get fries and Paula.
Oh, you know, went through a whole thing like that.
Maybe he's Dutch.
Maybe, or maybe like, Rumor.
Maybe he likes to go Dutch treat.
Oh, that's right.
Rumor don't go Dutch treat.
No, don't be rumored today.
You got to that great doctor.
So you're going to inspire me to tell that story about his call yesterday and that would be bad.
I'm not going to say a thing.
So the trans fats are the bad ones.
Those are the ones that cause cancer.
And the fact that they're showing.
They're showing what they're doing, the deep frying.
That's enough to make me gag.
It takes a lot to make me gag.
But believe you me, that would be one of them.
Why should I?
Why should I?
Why should I?
Why should I?
Why should I?
Why should I?
Oh, my God.
Did you see it?
Of course I thought I'd say they showed the deep fry.
Yeah.
And if it was bubbling and puking and of course they use that same stuff over it.
Well, I don't know if they do or not.
It's called deep fat.
How much more obvious can you get?
Right.
Deep fat.
Like heavy lots of fat.
This goes right into your system as that's like pouring a crap into your system.
It's collecting up.
A bottle of melted down cholesterol and just pouring it down your gullet.
Oh, there it is again.
Whoa!
Jesus Christ!
They're not only changing the oil for their fries.
They're also changing the oil for their hash browns for their crispy chicken sandwiches.
For all of those items.
It'll be starting in October and they'll work out next few months.
Let's take a look at the actual content of the order.
We can open it up.
If you want to order on some.
Artery Cogging.
Not a brand.
Oh my goodness.
Look at this.
All the fries had nine grams of artery clogging fat, but the new ones are only going to have six grams of artery clogging fat.
I love the way they put that on, see it in.
They put it in perspective.
Artery Cogging fat.
Oh, oh, oh.
How do you like them, Apple, sir?
I like it a lot.
You know what I'm saying?
It isn't going to make a bit of difference.
Nope.
The people who are addicted to the taste of those goddamn horrible fries.
And you know, I got to be honest with you.
Seriously.
I've never been a big Frenchman.
First of all, I'm not a big potato person to begin with.
Love potatoes.
I mean, you know, I like a nice baked potato with butter and sour cream and chives.
I can take it or leave it though.
It's not something I'm jones in for.
But French fries, to me, are like, I don't know.
They don't really have a lot of taste.
If you're on right, they do.
Which is why people drown them in mayonnaise or ketchup or whatever they stick on.
Right.
A lot of salt.
Sure.
Right.
It's like a bad steak.
Now, you don't go to a Ruth Chris, for example, or a burned steakhouse and ask for steakhouse sauce.
Unless you're on moron.
No.
Although they do like Peter Luger.
But if you go to a crappy steakhouse where the meat is like tough and like tasteless,
then you get the steak sauce and you slather it.
You lay it on their heavy duty.
And all your tasting is the taste of the steak sauce.
French fries don't really have any taste.
If they're done right, they do.
The McDonald's fries do.
I don't need ketchup when I eat those.
Georgia's promoting death right here on the U.S.
Although now that they're going both out.
The Georgia's promoting your death, your fat clog.
We're going to have to supersize the fries now that they're going to be low fat.
Yeah.
I keep that cholesterol and take up there.
What would happen to him?
This story is very disturbing to me.
Student arrested for police photos in Peole, Pennsylvania.
Peola?
Peola, Pennsylvania.
A college student of Syrian descent was arrested after authorities caught him taking pictures of police cars.
And activity, the FBI's one police departments of boat after 9-11.
Mohamed Boudira, U.S. citizen, was charged with criminal trespassing and disorderly conduct.
After he was spawned photographing, Williston Township Police Vehicles last month.
Boudira 20 has said that the photos are a hobby.
His attorney, Richard Meeneck, said there's a large online community of former officers and civilians
who are interested in police vehicles.
Meeneck said the family was upset because they thought police were in furring that Boudira was involved in terrorist activities
because he's in the middle of the eastern descent.
He's just a college kid who likes to take pictures of cop cars, Meeneck said.
I mean, when, when, don't you think most college kids like taking pictures of cop cars?
Most of the ones that I know.
Or stealing parking meters.
That's what we had.
We had a parking meter in our dorm room.
What are you laughing about?
That's the two-strips Michigan State.
I think we were the only ones in a whole campus had a parking meter in our room.
All right.
Steve.
Well, if you're, aren't you supposed to do so?
I told you.
You used to put on a taxi.
Of course you were.
You watched the code and steal a suntan lotion.
Never used it.
He's just a college kid who likes to take pictures of cop cars.
They said, but some police officers said this activity can be dangerous, especially in a post-9-11 climate.
The FBI said terrorists may try to case emergency vehicles to help carry out an attack.
Willis and police chief Hugh Murray said Boudira was first seen in these days.
And of course, we know there's going to be a terrorist attack in Peioli, Pennsylvania.
When you think that'd be a logical place?
Why not?
He was first seen in the station's parking lot taking photos on his first Murray said an officer noticed Boudira.
Not because he was Middle Eastern, but because of the FBI warning.
He was asked to delete the photos from his digital camera and leave, Murray said.
But court documents said he returned to take more photos the following day.
That's what counts as fish has done it.
Boy does he have a lot of hoods there.
Boudira who is free on bail, waved his preliminary hearing last week and applied for a rehabilitation program for nine violent offenders.
The program would allow him to perform community service and have the arrest wipe from his record.
They're going to wipe him, okay?
Bracket.
This is what they're going to do.
So how do you, how do you, what do you make of that?
Is that because you, I don't know, I don't know, I see what's the purpose of that.
So you take pictures of police cars and then what?
I don't know.
What do you do with that, especially in a post on the TV?
You're a terrorist buddies to Peioli, Pennsylvania, which I saw.
Somehow I'm just a little hard pressed to believe that the terrorists are going to like carry out attacks in either candidate
when the York or Peioli, Pennsylvania could be wrong and against the police car.
Or maybe if salani Michigan would be a good place.
I think that would be a great place for them to be a planning and better keep your eye on on air.
Huh?
Have you ever been in if salani?
Nope.
Good.
It's a horrible place.
It's a terrible place.
It's kind of, it's kind of like a place that there's no reason for it to exist.
Other than it fills up a certain amount of area between Detroit and Lansing.
There is a between Detroit and Jackson.
I don't know when it's been so long, you know what?
I have to go back to Michigan, back to Detroit.
What are you saying?
No.
I don't think so.
So did I mention that Joe and his buddies had a great time in Toronto and they loved the city?
Yeah, he did.
Mom, I'm going to mention it again.
They went to the CN Tower, which Joe kept referring to as the space needle.
I tried to tell him that the space needle wasn't the elevator.
Well, he, you know, he's not perfect.
He's like all the rest of us.
He makes mistakes.
Officials defend Air Marshall's acts.
Now you saw that story about the Air Marshall who went into the...
Yes, I did.
Federal officials defended the response of an Air Marshall who trained his gun on a passenger-filled jet cabin for 30 minutes.
After detaining a man prompting protest by a judge who was on the flight.
Two armed marshals detained the man on Delta Flight 442, which was flying from Atlanta to Philadelphia with 183 people on board,
because he allegedly was rummaging through other people's luggage.
One marshal then held his gun on the coach cabin passengers because some of them ignored orders to remain seated with their seat belts on.
A spokesman for the TSA said Sunday.
If people would have stayed in their seats and heated those warnings that would not have happened,
said TSA spokesman Robert Johnson in Washington, it's our opinion that it was done by the book.
After one or more passengers continued moving around the cabin, the Air Marshalls decided they needed to take the next step
and focused their weapons on the passengers part of their training Johnson said.
While one huddled over the detainee, the other stood by the cockpit door with his gun trained on the cabin several passengers said.
He said the TSA was overseas federal air marshals, was still reviewing the marshals' response on the Saturday flight.
The man whom the marshals detained was released and the US Attorney's Office decided not to press charges the FBI spokeswoman Jerry Williams be saying.
Johnson said that despite the passengers complaint, he thought the marshals did what they needed to make sure the plane could land safely.
It's a highly charged situation Johnson said it's about keeping the planes secure and I agree with him.
Don't you agree?
Absolutely, I wish I had been there for that.
Because on the other flights it was more than one they were strategically located around the first class cabin and then all popped up and went in action.
How the hell is he? They supposed to know.
Right.
Fill it off the account and please judge James A. Lienberger, who was sitting diagonally across from the detainee man, said he thought the marshals overreacted by holding their semi-automatic weapons on the passengers for so long.
Lienberger also said he had no disdain disturbance before the marshals suddenly took the man up to first class and restrained him.
Several minutes later the judge said the marshals returned to the coach cabin, pulled out their guns.
I assumed at that moment there was going to be some sort of gun battle he said.
I'm looking right down the barrel of the gun as though it was pointed at me.
Lienberger said he plans to file a complaint with the TSA today.
He said about 30 other passengers also plan to complain.
David and Susan Johnson, a mobile Alabama, said they hadn't been aware of any disturbance when the sky marshals took the man first to the back of the plane then to the first class section.
It never made sense that Susan Johnson, 51 a social worker.
This guy was not any physical threat that we could see.
Maybe he said some things to them that made them concerned.
He just appeared to us unstable emotionally.
Oh, just unstable emotionally.
Yeah.
One passenger, however, said he thought the air marshals handled the situation in a calm professional manner.
These guys looked pretty well like they had things under control.
Said Robert Van Ditty-Cramer.
Huh?
His name, Robert Van Ditty-Cramer, 28, who was in first class.
He said the marshals only pointed their gun straight down the barrel.
Not at any particular pass, though.
I think the situation was extremely well handled, said Mr. Van Ditty-Cramer.
No relation to Brad Cramer.
The health airline spokeswoman Christy Tucker said they were on officials to talk with crew members on the flight
and would cooperate with federal authorities, but declined to comment further.
After the plane landed, police boarded briefly, questioned another man sitting behind the line,
but did not contain him.
The judge said, by the way, speaking of airlines, hi to all my good friends, Helen and everybody in our Canada.
You know that the flight coming up here was a half hour early getting here?
No.
Half hour early.
And there was a lady and elderly lady, a schwarz, by the way, sitting in the way in the back of the plane,
who was complaining of like either chest pains or something.
So the captain comes out and announces before we landed that when we land,
and stay in your seats because the paramedics are going to come on again and ambulance,
standing by, yadda yadda.
And it's going to take like 10 to 15 minutes, but we'll still be very early.
You know it took like two minutes and they slept through off the plane.
That was it.
We landed like a half hour early.
Excellent.
And there were like four guys who came on to paramedics.
What is it?
I know you don't care, but it's something I've always wondered.
What is it about paramedics that they're so good looking?
I think the four guys come on.
I'm serious.
They could have been models.
Three of these guys, I'm sitting there like, eh, I'm squeezing myself.
Like, what is this all about?
It's true.
I'll try to notice from now on.
No, I'm serious, per-
Like I might have a heart attack.
And some of them might have even been straight all the way down.
See, that's another thing.
What attracts is it, you know, like fire rescue and everything sliding up that grease pool.
You think that might be it?
Uh-huh, maybe it.
I've asked that question, but they're like all in the closet.
What is it about dolphin trainers?

Go fuck yourself.
Yes.
Double you want to type of who's saying, even though no one will back us.
Hard to tell which one is more insane, when it was the party to attack us.
Double you have to finish that pipeline that is losing his patience.
Order the troops you go give up their lives for the world's biggest gas station.
The pipeline at all costs, white triad, the lives that will be lost can't buy it.
There's more important things to do.

Pull somebody in the kitchen.

1119 at 560, W.D. Kremel.
I want to make a point today, I'm mentioning since it's the 3rd of September, Labor Day has gone.
Today is the official day that we start back to normal, right?
Right.
Such as it is.
Such as it is.
In other words, I'm on every day.
I'm always on every day except after tough abormates, and weddings, and the football broadcasts.
And the mad dog and Hank is back from vacation to the crystal palace.
Well, he's not really back, but he's on.
Just like I'm not back, but I'm on.
Father, what I'm saying?
I got it.
I'm on something.
Just back.
Jeff who?
Is he there?
Yeah.
Hey, Ponytail, how are you doing?
Don't talk. Don't put him on the air.
He'll start telling photographic stories.
Okay.
So what's the deal now?
Were they really supposed to open on the third?
You can put him on for a second.
Is he in there with you?
Yeah. He's running around right now.
As we speak.
And that's you now.
You're making me now.
You're making me feel bad because I'm not going to end the food.
Uh-oh.
Not that I need the food.
You understand?
Everything's got bread.
Everything he brought has a lot of bread.
You missed your chance when you were here.
No, no, you don't understand.
I had my balance for life, which is the next spot on the log, by the way.
I eat fast for life every day till I'm on it.
You could still cheat once in a while.
Are you on it?
Yes, I've been on it for four months.
And how are you doing?
About 15, 16 pounds off from my midsection, which is what I want to know.
Great.
My mother's on it.
She's lost 35 pounds.
Woo!
Well, see, how come you don't give us this information for crying out loud?
I've given the information.
You're just, you know, busy.
I mean, you're in town.
We don't go out.
No.
Because then it would be an eating experience just like with Rimmer.
You keep eating with the Rimmer.
It's okay.
They'll keep your company until I'm ready to have some more meals.
I'm doing pretty damn well.
There are a lot of things.
There are a lot of things.
186.
Cool.
Yeah, I didn't even have to say it.
Yeah, so anyway, we were hoping to open a week from yesterday.
But the instruction...
And my friend Marcy, by the way, you are going to take care of her, please.
Absolutely.
From Walt Green's over there right in front of where your new joint is.
Yeah.
She told me September the 3rd.
And I said, this is great.
You know, at least somebody tells me it gives me some information.
And then come to find out it's going to be late.
Yeah. Well, the holidays kind of screwed up some of the inspections that, you know, minor technicality that we have to have.
You even sound thinner.
Does anybody believe that?
No.
No, but it sounded good.
Another real thing.
You can hear it.
Yeah.
I feel good too.
A lot more energy.
There you go.
Yeah, works great.
Me too.
Another one.
I iced my elbow.
I'm like the pickiest guy when it comes to eating out, as you know.
In fact, a guy like you that works out so much and hangs out at the gym and gets late four or five times a day.
You want to know about my brisketis, about my elbow?
I've had that before, man.
And what did you do for it?
I went to it.
I got anti-inflammatories and ice.
And what?
Anti-inflammatories and ice.
Well, I can't do the anti-inflammatories most of them because I'm diabetic.
Okay.
But I can do the ice.
I'm going to variation it all day.
In fact, what I'm going to do when the show is over, I'm going to stick my elbow in the freezer for a couple hours.
No, seriously, the ice helped tremendously.
Everybody's been telling me, oh, put ice on it.
And I've been using this, the flexol, all the smear stuff, you know, which is heat.
And it hasn't got a goddamn thing.
And the ice cream is for everyone.
And the improvement is sensational.
So how do you like talking to a big shout-out in Toronto, huh?
Pretty cool.
I wish I was there, man.
I'm stressing with all the stuff for the news store.
Oh, but you do.
Talk to Joe Castell.
I'll tell you how much you loved it up here.
Did I mention George that Joe and his buddies loved it up here?
No, you haven't.
Oh, let me tell you about that.
Not.
Okay, now I got, say goodbye to point two.
I'm talking to you, Jeff.
Oh, I got to see you when you're waiting.
Wait, what about the date?
Charge the rumors double.
Okay.
The new date is about seven to ten days.
And you guys will be the first to know.
This is where we'll make the announcement.
Okay, keep tuned to QIM for the opening of the brand new pizza love on the quarter of
Navhil and sunrise right by Walgreens.
Now, you don't mind if I keep mentioning Walgreens.
I don't care, especially after 27 years of only one location.
Do you know what a big thing this is?
No, no, you see the reason I mentioned the Walgreens thing.
Not just because my friend Marcy works there and all the people in there love me.
But because of the fact you have one little liability to overcome and that is you can't be seen from the street.
I have you.
I don't have to be seen from the street.
No, no, no, but I'm just saying.
So to give people a specific idea where it is, it's in that little strip shopping center right behind the Walgreens is.
I mean, how could you do better than that?
In fact, in fact, when you drive through the prescription pickup drive through window at Walgreens,
you're like looking right at your place.
I don't know what you're doing.
Right. That's right.
You got it.
And there are fewer things that make me lose my appetite than thought of looking at your joint.
Anyway, have a good time Jeff, which I'm sure you will.
Okay.
And say goodbye.
Okay.
Now George, I got the dilemma here because I got two stories.
Okay.
Which I'm not sure which one I want to do.
Thank you very much.
The David Sanger column from the Times today, which I did prove but didn't read in its entirety during the break.
I read it. It's got to be on it.
A silence that Coolidge wouldn't be.
So thank you whoever facts that in.
But I have the Oprah story, which Oprah is.
I don't even better, I think.
Which one should we do first?
Oprah Oprah.
Oprah sores to a deadly 275 pounds.
You had one of what an Oprah sore.
Oh, if you saw the picture of her, push.
Oh man, talk about it.
Oh, oozing wound.
Yeah, with the oozing opens Oprah sore.
Woo.
Oprah's bloated faces, puffy and full of ripples.
This is in the inquire.
This is another one.
See every week the tabloids they put in at least one picture that's worth going out and picking it and buying the magazine or at least looking at it in the newsstand.
Just for seeing that picture.
This is on page 34 in this week's inquire.
Binge eating ignites deadly health crisis for a poor old Oprah.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
Oh my god.
Puffy and full of ripples.
Man.
So I guess we'll do that one first and we'll do the bush thing.
All right.
Don't forget we got the mad dog coming up one o'clock this afternoon.
The constipated canine.
You know, I'm looking at my log and I keep crossing off a break ahead of time.
You think I'm trying to tell myself something?
It does make a show go faster.
Have you ever noticed on the log when I finished doing a break?
I was crossing off and right of course.
And I've got I've done this for two hours now.
I keep crossing off like one ahead.
Stop it.
I'm in a hurry.
Wow, I'm in a hurry to go stick my arm in a freezer.
1125 at 560 WQM.
Speaking of balance for life.
And what a great.
How do you like that?
Jeff Cohen has lost what he say 15 pounds and his mother 35.
Yes.
And the beast who had the great pleasure of seeing what I was there for a few days.
The beast has lost 52 disgusting grotesque cottage cheese filled pounds.
And looks almost human.
I want to underline the almost he's still got away to go.
But he's down from 284 to 232.
In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if like this week he gets you know done 230-ish.
It's just amazing in it.

And all over town, all over all the radio stations in town.
All right.
So in other words, he's making a few extra Bokeh Brian.
Oh, he won't be crying in Monin and Sodie pressing next time I see him.
No.
You're right.
He will be.
So anyway, here's the inquirer which reports that Oprah sourced to a deadly 275 pounds.
Binge beating Oprah Winfrey has lot.
What did I just say?
Binge beating.
Binge beating.
Oprah Winfrey has lost her 15 year battle of the ball.
She packed on 45 pounds over the past several months,
soaring to a deadly 275.
Stereo.
The talk queen, I thought that was me.
The talk queen is ditched her diet and scaled her way back on exercise,
alarming friends, her doctor and even boyfriends, Stedman Graham sources say.
But 48 year old Oprah says she's getting too old to keep up a figure whose diet and exercise regimen.
And she's relieving the stress of recent setbacks by gorging on her favorite treats.
In February, the 5.7 entertainer tipped the scales at 257 pounds.
I'll tell you what they, she's got the beef beat by a mile.
But then she made an all out effort to lose weight and slim down.
But as her personal problems mounted, she packed on weight at a staggering rate until she reached her all time high,
just 25 pounds shy of the scale, busting 300 pound bark.
Let's hear it for good old.
The aquar got exclusive pictures of a bloated out of shape.
Oprah.
Huffing and puffing while doing a slow jog along a beach in Maui, Hawaii.
The star has to look her best on TV and in her magazine has top makeup experts at her disposal.
But the shocking, inquiring photo show what she really looks like, like LC the Borden Cowan Heat.
Oprah's gotten so heavy the weight gain has even distorted her facial structure.
Her face is swollen nearly beyond recognition.
It's puffy and full of ripples in her face too.
The flesh is bumpy with peaks and valleys and inside source.
She's been retaining excess amounts of water in her face is blown up.
Despite her extreme rate, we learned that after Oprah doesn't rework out, she often indulges in the feast of fattening foods.
Oprah.
It's about to raise the white flag and surrender once and for all to her weight of pale told the inquirer.
Her weight has gone up and down for years as she tried every diet and exercise method known to man.
But lately she's been making only a half-hearted attempt.
She knows she's putting her overall health and danger.
Her doctors have already said her cholesterol count is too high and that she's risking heart and other problems.
The beloved performers, yo-yo dieting can also do great harm.
Yo-yo.
The constant weight loss in gain can be extremely hard on the body to clear joy, bowler.
I wonder if she's related to the bowler clan on guiding light, you think?
No.
Do you think she's kind of pop a bowler?
She's kind.
Nistva.
A top knee-errknutritionist author of the 90-10 weight loss plan who has not treated Oprah.
People who lose weight very quickly tend to put it on very quickly when they fall out their diet.
And this can be dangerous bowler told the inquirer.
Maybe kind of hank-bowler.
These individuals put themselves at high risk for heart attack strokes and other problems, she said.
But Oprah feels there's little more she can do.
She's exhausted herself fighting her marathon more against fat.
She says the 15-year battle to keep her way down is weird heard to the point she can hardly raise the energy to care.
Reveal the pal.
And like I said, in every one of these tabloid stories, everybody's got a pal.
Right, pali?
Before she used to run six miles at an inch, spend hour after hour on the treadmill walking off pounds.
Now she makes only a token effort at burning calories.
She's also lost the willpower she wants to have to stay away from the salty fatty greasy food she loves.
The fried chicken and cheese and chips that are her bean.
Fried chicken.
Cheese and how about if she would like, you know, watermelon is not bad?
Wouldn't that be better?
It's fattening.
Or maybe a banana or two.
Well, there you go again just like that Serena Williams story or Venus Williams with your one or what it was about.
How many bananas can they eat that Mo get all better shape about?
Calm down Mo, okay?
Nobody gives a crap.
She's binge eating.
We're talking about Oprah.
She wants the treadmill for half an hour.
Then sits down with a bucket of fried chicken and some, can't you see that?
She sits down with a bucket of fried chicken and some potato chips.
He knows better.
But she's willing herself into denial rather than putting in the hours it takes to be healthy.
Sitting down with a big bucket of Kentucky fry.
I can see it now.
You can just see the bones on the floor sitting there passed out with surrounded by bones.
She says she's getting too old to continue the fight and the more weight she gains the harder that fight becomes as so many of us know.
I'm all starting to feel sorry for Oprah almost.
The weight stresses for her joints.
Oprah says it's hard to face the pain of running or walking when her knees feel like we're gonna crumble.
Lately it's kind of sound a little like fat boy, don't it?
Yeah.
Crumbling ankles, crumbling hips.
And my dead friend that was what happened right before he died.
Maybe he better off if he'd shut his lips.
Lately she's made the dangerous mental switch of deciding that maybe she was just meant to be heavy.
The change in her thinking is alarming.
Some friends are worried that she's gonna drop that from a heart attack.
But it's Oprah's for a fight and she's short.
What is it?
And short of trying her to a bit.
Short of trying her to a bed and keeping her away from food.
There's not a lot of anyone can do.
It conjures up the image of that guy in her although who was lying in a bed but in his case they can't bring him in the food.
Can you see that?
You can just see her so big and so pathetic and feeble that she can't get out of the bed probably a tip in 500 pounds and everybody's bringing her buckets of chicken.
How about your Jeff Kornel send her pizzas for free plenties TV.
She does try a little bit to watch what she eats and exercise but where she used to devote all her spare time to her weight troubles.
Now she devotes 15 minutes here and there.
She says the battle has become too hard to fight.
She wants it over with.
Recently Oprah spent four nights at the four seasons resort on Maui.
The star who still needs to keep a present presentable appearance for a TV show was winded and struggling as she slowly jogged along the resort's beach.
A concern source told the inquirer when it was rainy out she did the treadmill and resorts gym for about 10 or 15 minutes.
It wasn't like the old days when she'd put an hours a day at a hotel gym.
She's obviously in a lot of pain to work out their short.
Added the inside source Oprah's weight has reached an all time high.
She's up to 275.
It's not uncommon for her to pack on up to six pounds a week.
She's run back to eating dessert after every meal as well as using desserts as an daily snack.
Chocolate cake, cheesecake and calorie laden pastries are an everyday items for Oprah.
They calm her nerves the way a martini comes in alcoholic.
See I can relate to that.
Sure.
Her cholesterol is higher than ever.
Dr. is concerned about her tremendous weight gain.
He's worried before to lose some weight before she killed herself.
Lose some weight.
Remember that?
That was a great dream.
Most of our friends haven't seen Oprah.
I mean, they haven't seen another haven't seen that or Fatsel.
You ain't the only.
Yeah.
And that is shame that most people haven't seen Fatsel.
The fat people it should be mandatory.
Yeah, it should be.
They should like with the Malcolm McDowell.
They should sit down in front of the guy they moved between.
Proper eyelids open with toothpicks and force him to watch it over and over again.
I love the scene where he says, I feel sorry for me.
There's nobody like Dom Delabries.
Let's hear it for Dom.
Oh!
He's still alive.
Okay, Brent was like some alive.
What do you think that's all about?
I just have a warm friendship.
Maybe for some company friendship.
Anyway, it's 11.39.21 till noon at 5.60 WQM.
We're back on our full-time schedule.
Oh!
Spread the word because Greg reached her rank in as any billboards.
Is he?
No.
Because he's full of crap.
Even the stuff he puts in writing is that Alphan's found out.
Full of crap.
He may not be good, but at least he's consistent.
He's consistently full of crap.
Our leader, Greg Reed.
Even Mo.
You know, not only am I not getting any publicity.
Even Mo, who I'm sure they promised all kinds of publicity when he came here.
Okay, I'll solve those ads.
Yeah, he saw.
They had one little three by five ad in like the business journal or some damn thing like a trade-out.
Is he going to get any publicity?
No.
And of course with those numbers, probably I'm deserving.
Well, maybe he'd have higher numbers if somebody knew he was on.
Somebody that heard of him?
What do you think?
20-till-noons.
See, I know you're not going to respond because you just, you know, off the air, you're rippin' an acid on the air.
You're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I need to job.
Okay, I understand.
Because you're still a hostage.
You're still, you know, no, get too carried away.
In spite of the marvelous job you did this summer.
Now did Greg when he came in say nice job this summer, George?
No.
No.
Prick.
20-till-noons at 560 WQM.
The lights that I spoke are speaking.
You know, it's just endless.
Isn't it?
Talk about losing weight.
And the reason it's endless is because most of us are fat.
Fat is a, in fact, what's his name?
The new guy in the morning, Zach?
Yeah.
The new board off?
Man, is that kid fat or what, huh?
I don't want to pick on him specifically.
But is he fat?
Yeah, he's fat.
But he's a really good guy.
I didn't say most fat people are good guys.
Dom Deloise, a lot of fun.
He's funny.
But he's going to be dead very soon.
Can I do the light spotter?
You're going to keep interrupting with this one.
No, I'm not going to die.
You're going to be a bad guy.
Joseph, friends, weren't fat.
Who was up there with him, Bill?
Bill and the David.
Nice guys.
Nice great looking, but nice guys.

I guess I died at 57 years old.
I'm having more than anything.
I'm having more than anything.
I'm having more than anything.
Wait.
Wait.
Look at a good student bloody pound.
Oh.
No.
Hello.
Is anyone there?
I'm stuck in this bloody room.
Whoa.
Oh, tell Rumi.
Spin you around.
I passed out on the good, good, good, good, good, good, crowd.
Who knows what's the next good, good, good, good, good, day?
I guess they don't need me anyway.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
I went speaking to that, and people looked like they're about to have a corner.
I guess what starts at noon today.
I give up.
The sentencing hearing for your favorite.
David Westardfield.
All right.
And you are right.
They were showing clips before, and he was like, head of the tears in the eyes.
And what's the way they oh, yeah, he started to get real shaky now.
Because they were, they're going to kill him.
Because the moment of truth is coming.
Oh, right.
And they're going to fry his ass here at hand.
Too bad we can't bring the cheer out, just for special occasions like him.
And he's weeping and getting shaky.
You're right.
In the beginning, he was still up for like about these seconds.
And and I thought the American Idol thing was last week.
So I made another mistake.
I guess I misunderstood tomorrow night.
They're announcing the official winner.
Okay.
The final winner.
Are you following me?
Yeah.
Well, I'm not following that.
We anticipate to be our highest rated show.
Uh, 20, 25 million people watching.
Yeah, that's pretty good exposure.
I'd say and you should have seen before they had the bubble head on CNN.
And she said, Oh, and now let's go out to the West Coast and there.
If you were on secret, he's one of the final and they got the video,
but they don't have the audio and he can't hear her anyway.
And he just sitting there and sitting Ryan.
Can you hear me?
He's sitting there looking straight at it.
And by the way, I wouldn't touch him with your hand.
By the way, nothing you should care anymore, but have you seen the market lately?
Oh, yeah, you must be psychic.
I was going to mention that next.
The market's taking a precipitous crap today.
I was just going to mention that.
That was down 288.
And as the next down about 40 point, I thought we reached the bottom.
And of course it was.
Yeah, everybody out there that's in a market, it was your bottom.
That's right.
We haven't reached the bottom of the basement.
Now we're in the basement.
Right.
That's right.
Speaking of basements, don't do radio shows from your basement.
It's muggy in the dam.
Okay.
Just a little piece of advice from somebody who's not going to be doing any more shows from Amsterdam.
Whatever this was, you just fact me.
I hope it wasn't too good to Denmark thing.
Oh, it can't be.
It's the best thing ever.
Well, I can't read it though.
Oh, no.
You read it.
All right.
It's from Denmark.
It came out black.
Thank you, Miguel, by the way.
A patient.
Hey, thanks, Miguel.
We still love you.
Go ahead.
I don't hate to keep interrupting.
That's all right.
A patient broke when while having surgery and set fire to his genitals.
A 30 year old man was having a mole removed from his bottom with an electric knife when his attack of flatulence ignited a spark.
The genitals, his genitals, which were soaked in surgical spirits, caught fire.
The man who was suing the hospital said, when I woke up, my penis and scrotum were burned like hell.
Besides the pain, I can't have sex with my wife.
Surgeons at the hospital in Chiol, Kura, something up said it was an unfortunate accident.
I can't read Dutch.
Keller ups.
Dutch.
It's Danish.
Whatever it is.

Yeah, you're right.
You don't read well.
But it is a good story.
You're right.
Thank you very much, Miguel.
Miguel's got his eye on it.
What's that I'm just going to do before you threw me off?
Oh, yeah, we got American Idol.
I was wrong about that.
That they're going to announce tomorrow that you're winner.
I wouldn't know.
Come on. You're in to that craft.

Now, what is this vagus story just facts me here?
Oh, this isn't another one of those priest things, is it?
No.
Some more missing.

Stephen Fales had the perfect life.
Former missionary and clean cut member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

You know something, I have to interrupt this.
I don't want to make fun of anybody's religion.
Any more than I usually do, which is a lot.
But this thing with the magic underwear.
I'm sorry.
I mean, I understand that you're born into something in your brain washed and...
Take all the time.
Why are people doing these things?
The magic underwear.
They're temple garments.
Anyway, he was gay.
He's a homosexual, yoddy-oddy-oddy.
This isn't worth talking about on a year, is it?
Man.
This is some kind of a fagster.
We don't want no more fag stories.
The host is a fag.
That's good enough.
And a lot of people think George is too.
Yeah, but it's a Mormon fag story.
Leave one to fags.
I don't care about that.
There's plenty of Mormons who are fags, okay?
No.
Just ask Steve Young. He'll tell you.

Paul McCartney came on on.

I was right there where he belonged.
And Michael, once that show was over,
Michael kept dropping down the ladder further and farther and farther and further.
Once all the crank votes didn't count anymore.
A silence that Coolidge would envy rights David Sanger with today's New York Times.
President Bush is well practices strategic reticence.
His normal alphabeticality and Texas backslaping can be flipped off instantly when he's not in the mood to answer questions.
Or when he senses that unscripted comments could make a politically uncomfortable moment even worse.
But as the summer is drawn to a close, Mr. Bush's nurtured silence is that even Calvin Coolidge would envy.
And Scott started his ranch last week.
He kept reporters at Bayland Vice President Cheney do all the talking about the administration's thinking on Iraq.
When he emerged for obligatory events like campaign appearances last week in Oklahoma and Arkansas.
Or today's talk here at Labor Day Picking for the Carpenter's Union.
A favorite because last year it split with the AFL CIO Democratic ally.
Mr. Bush's stuck closely last brings well-born scripts about chasing down Elkide and getting Congress to pass his energy and domestic security bills.
So what are his thoughts about the national security advisers from his father's administration who've taken to the airwaves and op-ed pages suggesting that he may be making a huge mistake by corining toward a confrontation with Iraq without the support of allies or Arab nations?
Mr. Bush's avoided the question and the inevitable follow-ups about whether his Republican critics are speaking for his father or Secretary of State Colin Powell to critics deny it.
How about the estimates last week that federal deficits are likely to deepen throughout the Bush presidency?
The president knew a few months ago confidently predicted that deficits would be shallow and brief hasn't talked about it.
The sharp review delivered by federal courts over how the administration is dealt with deportation hearings and Americans caught up in the terrorism roundups.
The president, they spoke to him in Texas, has not voiced an opinion.
White House aid says there's nothing unusual going on.
Like most other vacationing Americans, Mr. Bush was trying desperately to e-cout a few last moments of relaxation.
A difficult enough task for a man who starts each morning with a CIA and FBI threat assessments.
But as the confident of the president said the other day, this hasn't been the most pleasant summer on the ranch.
Mr. Bush's friend said doesn't sound like a man eager to get back to what promises to be a tough fall, what was wrangling with the Senate, a frenetic campaign schedule for midterm elections, and continuing arguments with the allies and issues like the environment and Iraq.
Presidential moods are difficult to measure from a distance, of course, and report is always wine that they heard too little from presidential lips.
Officially, the White House has Mr. Bush looks forward to getting back to Venice.
But there is no question that this has been a summer of mounting discontent.
Like the economy the battle against terrorism Mr. Bush talked about today seems to be moving sideways.
While he appeared relaxed as he shook hands today at the invitation only picnic outside Pittsburgh, the easy laugh Mr. Bush displayed a year ago this weekend off the record barbecue with reporters hasn't been heard by the press corps for some time.
Mr. Bush declined to hold a similar event this year, perhaps wisely, choosing to entertain volunteers in locals instead.
Nor did he show up at the coffee station in town's meeting place, which features prominently in his speeches as a place where he stays in touch with real America.
He stayed far from reporters in his life public appearances.
Perhaps Mr. Bush doesn't want to let on about his thoughts until September 11th when he is when he is will, although mistaken in New York Times, when he'll lead the day of national reflection and commemoration.
Perhaps he's thinking about all the wrangling with the Democratic Senate that's blocking major elements of his agenda.
But some of his aids can see that something else has had worked.
All the questioning of his Iraq policy by his father's national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and former secretary of state James A. Baker the Third, the man who saved the Florida recon for Mr. Bush has stung.
First this is a president doesn't like policy issues and fishers in his own team being aired in public a senior official said over the weekend.
The most withering assessment came just as Mr. Bush was corralling the presidential dogs, spot and Barney to make the trip back to Washington.
Barney seemed particularly reluctant to leave his Texas freedoms and had to be carried aboard Air Force one.
Maybe the president too.
As they flew back Lawrence Eagleberg, a lifelong Republican and for a time the elder Mr. Bush's secretary of state was on the NBC program meet the press, suggesting that the Bush teams problems might be explained by an experience and asking why Mr. Cheney had backed up his accusations that Iraq was on the verge of obtaining nuclear weapons.
If we are so clear in our own minds, this is a real danger. Why can't we convince our NATO allies of that fact Mr. Eagleberger asked he added there is a real disconnect here and I don't understand it.
One of the mysteries of the last week of August is why Mr. Cheney was doing all the talking on the tough issues while Mr. Bush avoided any mention of Iraq.
Instead the president stuck to a standard menu of education reform, the need for energy and domestic security legislation and a vow to go after any executives who are cooking the books.
One theory was that Mr. Cheney was testing the international waters. Mr. Bush has learned the advantages of keeping his options open until the last moment and it's easier to call back a vice president's lines than it is to call back a president.
Another theory denied by the White House was that Mr. Cheney was subtly pushing his boss, the vice president's position that going through the United Nations for further inspections of suspected weapons sites as a dangerous waste of time, seemed to contract with general policy public insistence that the U.S. needs to do so to build an international consensus.
Every fly sure the White House press secretary who said reporters are making much to do about no difference, added that Iraq changes positions on whether the inspectors back in more often than Sodom who say changes bunkers.
And with Mr. Bush break out of his own bunker and perhaps have a news conference upon us return to Washington point noted Mr. fly sure said nothing is planned will let you know.
