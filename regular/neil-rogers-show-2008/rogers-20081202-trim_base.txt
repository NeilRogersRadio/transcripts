possible to conceal I'm spotted a Woody you fairy I feel like an absolute out of
so it goes to the west he was part one too follow him up to the gates of
speed as he headed for his room there's a pretty good way to fall his post down in the
jungle room we're spotted what is a man's best oh it's really impossible to conceal

well George is pretty pissed off about today's poll Sean he's really upset
ah well the whole city ever gets about the poll because he doesn't cure it's just I don't
think it's very fair although since when did we ever say that life was fair how it is
that's started no it isn't look at where we are I know I don't know where we used to be and look
where we are now anyway serious is now to 17 cents a share and speaking of that the fake Greg
Budell is back this morning at least somebody's back boy it is slim and grim on those emails wow
well it's the holidays you know and it's this but it's a bit bit of a bit about people are
putting up the Hanukkah Bush and the Christmas tree and all this other crap and they're
shopping till they're dropping et cetera I don't believe it I think what we ought to do is put up
an out of business sign on the door the one thing that keeps us going is that as much as they're
trying to drag us down and believe me they've done a fabulous job of that at least we still are
above all the other day parts on the station every trend every book yeah for now I can't wait
till we get down to a point oh that'll be something and won't be with jolly joe bellotale
it's possible we know we we never will this show never will as long as we have this format on this
station we'll never what we'll never be the last show we'll never be anything at the top show
are you knocking the format again yeah playing pit music on the air we'll get a better number
than the you knock in yes yes yes yes jerk jerk street I'm knocking look how successful all the
changes have been man the the Kenny and blow morning show and jerks a two jerk stew to four
well I'm getting choked up George may have to step in here today really now I'm getting choked
up I'm losing my voice do you hear it I'm so emotional about what's going on with us
not not good not sounded good I think I need to rest for a few weeks so the fake Greg
Budelle says subject going bust he's talking about serious so this is sunny fox maybe we don't
know who this is nor quite frankly do I care it's one of those losers who's you know who's salted
away his future wasn't bad enough that saw foods ripped him off for 600 grand but now
something has put his future in the hands of people that are going out of business soon like
probably this year this coming year the fake Greg Budelle says you've got many fans here meaning
it's serious but the problem is you're completely understandable interest in making money we are
fresh out we are fresh out you want money we don't got none son if QA is paying you a million
year with bonuses for five years then you got a good deal where do you get that number
always dreaming you've got community continuity and security as well we would not be able to
offer that and that's it that's all he says we would not be able to offer that as if
isn't this amazing this is all because puppet love sponge on the first of next month is going
back to terrestrial radio and therefore these goofballs whoever the hell they are have been plotting
and planning oh it's going to be filled well it's not going to be filled because you just signed
at the deal it's not going to be me because I got a five year deal I'm going to I'm working
for Shalmeal with a five year deal maybe they can find somebody who work for food stamps
yeah I'm like how about how about SNH Green Stamps do you know that at the hard rock they've got a
slot game SNH Green Stamps
I had no idea yeah that's that's where they have Johnny Rockets over there by the way at the hard
rock George told me the whole story about Johnny Rockets this morning very very disturbing very
disturbing but you know what you got the right idea and I'm going to do the same thing yeah
I had nothing to do with Johnny Rockets which is great no no I understand that it had to do with
people right and and your good idea is to like at this stage of your life which sooner than I'm
doing but just scrape the people away from your life who are just not not productive positive
contributors that's right we've got enough people dragging us down already right here in this place
right here in this radio station starting with Joyce and Joe Bell and Clarence is Clarence there by
the way FATSO well yes he actually just walked in here for a second did he really what did he want

you didn't even know that spielke's nirah has been an anchor for years pathetic you had only one
active local broadcaster on the poll in addition the recent rick sanchez one is because most of your

person on the poll they knew was rick sanchez who's nationwide right right is that pathetic or what

still wouldn't know because I don't watch channel seven news so they can put spielkeys in a ray on
24 seven I still wouldn't know it because I wouldn't watch that swill probably Dan man watches it
religiously that's the important thing about doing a show to sound photos no one who the hell the
news anchors are who gives a flying crap about spielkeys in a ray and about that swill they call
news on channel seven you stick with it sir man whoever whatever you are it I think I left a
couple others off of that keep the hate coming on the emails that's that's basically all we got

gave the pull we're doing now did I not that's all right we got a lot of time too much if he asked me
two hours of this crap would be more than enough joebell let's get some more sports on there from
noon to two oh yeah oh I got a time jikker report from the real or fake I don't know I don't
several of them from other fake time jikker one of them says that they're putting Jim Rome on
mid days across the street well we've we've fought that battle before and it wasn't much of a battle
Jim Rome my ass oh my god so that's all true that the what's his name syndicate is going to
serious with the chris russo before they go out of business and then they're going to stick
sedano on in the morning and then ten a m the three p m they're going syndicated talk sports talk
Jim Rome oh a hallelujah bring it on bring it on
anyway it says I must have missed this episode of Supernatural it's got a picture of two guys in the
naked guys pretty hot guys too as a matter of fact this is definitely some of the best skin it says
my husband says there's no way that dean would be on the bottom same in dean you know the two brothers
in the supernatural yeah you do I mean I've watched the show once so I think he would
I bet Sam has oh no come on I'll be watching we run stick head says these boys sure are pretty huh
love you George and fat Chris signed Vince in Jacksonville and it says my husband says there's no way
well I don't know maybe Vince has got a husband might be maybe Vince is gay hey Vince you fairy
I don't know what you're talking about anyway here's the poll what movie or TV show has the
best flesh and George is really whipped up to a frenzy really p oed about this poll not a happy
camper wait a minute let me go back to this very somebody says about today's show I transcribed your
show so far today for recap just in case you missed it why why why the fake this moron why the fake
that moron fat Chris is fat why why the doubt was down but it's okay in the oil I still love you
and we'll never stop listening I have no life very oh it's a complete PSI love fat Chris very
mccocciner and a boy Barry you're the best I wonder if he's kind to Barry Jackass
okay we only have two hundred and twelve votes on this pool because I only put it on when I
sat down here this morning because Eric he just didn't change the poll last night he usually does
if I forget to do what he's usually on top of it he's a little off his game what movie or TV
show as the best flesh and George's PO because it should be one or the other how can you compare
best flesh with that that would be like putting a Debbie does Dallas on there for crying out loud
I'm surprised that isn't on there yeah we got colligated man is soap 47 baywatch 30
colligula 28 boogie nights 15 wild things 15 showgirls 12 basic instinct 12 porkeys 9 oh please
last Vegas 7 from dust till dawn 6 the girl next door 5 entourage 5 room 4 is that Jim Rome oh what a
thought soprano is for supernatural 3 I voted for that and then I don't know why because there's
not any flesh on just the two hot guys you know that's enough for me I'm too old anything beyond
that it gets me a little bit nervous bachelor party 3 1 from what is that incoming freshman blue
crush the boob tube tourist is the tutors euro trip risky business oh come on and none yet
for me balls 3 since city 54 back to school the OC or the seniors 54 to never he votes my god
that was with the what's his name what's his name Philippe Ryan Philippe Ryan Philippe Philippe
Filipino you didn't see 54 I was good no I heard it was a little bit yeah it was kind of gay I
heard I heard this is well but nevertheless Marx is I remember Dan Coughlin unfortunately he
was an idiot from Cleveland who came down here and did sports on channel 6 and the late 80s or
early 90s he punctuated his reports by ringing a cowbell like he was a GD 18 century town cryer
now that I think about it he was the equivalent of Chris Matthew just a lot of noxious jackass
wow equivalent Chris Matthews oh now the person on that pull who I couldn't remember for the life
of me was Peter Ford who the hell is or was Peter Ford also how in the world that Al sunshine and
Dave game escape submission in the Christ we are slipping says Mark well must be that Sean is
slipping pull Sean because that was his pull so blame him for it or blame us we don't care we
blame for everything anyway oh here we go here's from the fake time jica have you heard that the ticket
is putting Jim Romano in January hearing that said the kid is going to work with Chris Russo on
serious well whoop do you do that's going to be a big loss for them across the street oh oh yeah
I mean what's the point all this fall to all about stuff that nobody is listening to nobody cares
about and all this you know that's like like these ball games we love the pan there is nobody
shows up but we love the panthers unless it's a whole bunch of people from the other team that's
playing like the ranges ranges how the ranges do against the panthers on Sunday I wonder in that
for nothing laws huh yeah they're lost and again there wasn't televised locally because they're
too damn cheap and because they're only telecasting televised in about 70 to 82 games of season the
freaking panthers Alan Cohen what you've done I think even Marty Cohen could do a better job with
that team than you've done Alan you suck the fake time jica says do you remember Jay Marvin from
WLS no I remember him from WFLA in Tampa he was another Tampa goofball and he forwards this message
and maybe it is the real time jica I don't know you think it is no well he forwards me a message
that was sent to a time jica at a certain address yeah and is that a address that you've used for
time jica before I don't even know things I see he calls you right no you've spoken to him since
you've been up there oh yeah like once or twice right we talk yeah y'all have each other's phone
numbers y'all right well he wouldn't call me to say do you remember Jay Marvin from WLS no he
wouldn't but if he were going to say you a message from Jay Marvin it says I haven't heard Neil
in some time but yes I'm a fan isn't everyone no they're not Jay they hate me like poison and they
want to do evil things to me they wish I would croak a wicked death every time I cough or sneeze
he's like oh Halloween he's on the way out let's throw a party Neil is doing the kind of talk
radio there should be more of says Jay now it's boiled down to reassurance radio too much right
versus left talk radio is a drag compared to the way used to be says Jay Jay Marvin from WLS I
never knew he went to a Chicago I know Lassiter did and hated every minute of it too how come I don't
get any emails from the fake file Lanciter I mean I know he's not with us anymore but that
should make any difference right should it no no probably something about the bird oh boy
will well this is cute will Walmart still have door busters ah ha ha ha wow Neil I might
interest you to know that one of the Julios has been calling you for years with all the Mara
cone stuff is on the air personality at 98.3 his name is Tony he masquerades is a Puerto Rican but
he's really a Dominican punk also that guy DA really sucks how do you like that from Dave thanks Dave

never do did you see the story where a mother made her son stand on the street corner where a sign that
said I am a liar and thief it's stolen a cell phone or some crap yada yada yada oh boy
and also whatever happened to Chuck Meyer asked him how we don't know he went to Cleveland and he
bombed there oh Johnny dark I seem to remember Tom like his feature as the ratings in the spring of 85

yeah he got in the car in the middle of the night and took off for Arizona for Phoenix when the real
ratings come out after the world series I wasn't even on like seven maybe two nights during that
whole fall book because they carried the world serious on I and Z which everybody was watching on TV

The average life expectancy for a male NFL player is 52
But of course that includes all those big tubby linemen you know

Why don't you say something nice to someone for a change why not call out someone like Ron St. John
Who is a great talent has been on the air Miami for years
He gets no credit except for way to the PA the dolphin games God bless him I dare you to say something nice
Well, I don't know Ron St. John he did a hell of a lot better job at the PA at the dolphin games than what's his name

Get that's a bottle of soda. You didn't know it's much getting organized for the show and stuff that I do every morning
I thought now would be a good time to sure get all that stuff done because when I come back to her just still gonna be
He was oh, yeah, the words still going on with the story. I don't know. I don't think I missed much. He didn't I
Missed I missed a little bit of the part where you said that your wife's friends were a holes, but other than that yeah
Rob says Al sunshine is still alive and he's in cocaine cowboys DVD on and he's ballooned up nicely
I know that I come down there once in a while like last weekend I
Keep trying to tell these people these things was it this past weekend? Yeah this past weekend today is Tuesday, right?

He'll be open soon Wayne Arnold and then then they will fear us when they get those neatly burgers going
But before he opens we're gonna have to stick with Johnny F and rockets right I
Think you should tell that whole story again on the year will kill least another hour. I told it like twice going take a nap. Yeah
I can go buy some bacon. I don't have any damn bacon
Steve and Richmond Virginia says oh, it's so good to hear from people out of town. I feel so much better about life
I first started listening to you in 1989 when I moved to South Florida from Virginia and I must say between you and Rickon
Sods I was a daily listener with interest
Like you I deeply appreciate the meeting with radio and growing up in Richmond
I used to tune to anything I could pick up at night usually New York City stations of course now
I'm able to get a lot of stations with my grondig radio at night and at least a few nights a week
I listen to that target of your affection joy Reynolds Pinto which I get from
Flame Thore in Buffalo
A flame throw in about what does that mean a flame throw? I don't know is he on WKBW? Oh God forbid
Although you and he have quite different styles
I find him somewhat interesting even though I tend not to have much interest in celebrity is him chat
But word you to our similar is the keen ability to present coherent thoughts over long periods of time and maintain decent enough numbers to stay on the air
I believe this takes perhaps a natural talent that is special. There's no question that Joey is special
Steve
But where you really interest me is the many topics you talk about that you present politically you and I are miles apart
And I sense that even though you're smart enough to know what really goes on in the world you presented on the you're differently
Sometimes in order to maintain your image. Oh, what does that mean that means you are he smart you're not you're only pretending to be a liberal
Because everybody knows that liberals are stupid and this guy writing is smart this evidence by your justified criticism
Of swallowing other Democrats, but come on to Republicans honestly deserve you are sometimes out of line
Iyer thanks very much for the gas prices are stock plunges mr. President Bush has nowhere very little control over these things
And you know that no I do not know that I do know that the Saudis and the Bush family are as tight as a snare drum is what I know Steve
Bandar Bush I'm not the one who invented that phrase by the way they did
No matter I remain into and by the way
It must I must be way out of touch because 99 and 9 10% of the rest of the world also agree with me about Bush
Right you continue you and Joe Bell continue to lick Bush's ass
No matter our main devoted listener what it was knowledge you're very effective use of humor and as a thought process and
Present a great show open continue to entertain for many years to come regardless Steve Simon enrichment Virginia
Who's kissing Bush
You hear that what
The sirens are going down there the ambulance you know that deep for a strange sound that they occasionally make look at ambulance
Yes, I sure
I didn't get on the air
Here's a pull from a grubber Tuchas who's
Got some good stuff today. I know what happened to him
Oh, and every was the police but it must be a wreck up the street
See if you like this pull and then I'll put it in my pile, okay?
What should man over 35 never wear baseball cap backwards their sidewards spandex bicycle shorts crocs
Hoop or dangle earrings those hip white sunglasses man gloss lipstick colored wristbands for different causes muscle shirts high school graduation ring or leather vests
Wow, that's not bad, huh?
We can add some other crap sure you don't think you like it. No, I like it. See is he frowning Chris. Is he making a face? No, not at all
Well, maybe he's thinking about Johnny F and rock no we're watching my life on the spanner soaps right now you can eat me. Yeah
Oh
My god, I got your email here a little cult just unbelievable
Very oh my god, I'm gonna save it for after the break and you're gonna plots
Can you handle it like yeah? Well, sure
It's not as exciting as your story about Johnny F and rockets and those cheap bastards that
Repaid your generosity by taking you for a thing. It was the one did you at least have a patty mouth sandwich?
No, I told you had a chili burger. Oh, geez. Yeah, it was very good. Well, I will quit your bitch in for a
You know
560 QAM
Naked for it later the biggest names the best talent. It's the big dog
Weekday morning 7 at 10 sports radio 560 QAM
The sports

Think
Although my own face are blue and red is for full face. I don't know why they hate me
Oh, why they always read me it must be because I got people with red is for full face
My mom on my arm like a random alley map a locker one. I got things on my nose
Nobody knows that under my clothes. I wear fancy hoes, but that don't mean that I'm gay
If you think my arms are bad you ought to see my legs. I might as well keep on smoothing shave to show a little clas the next time
I'm raping it. I can go to a surgeon, but that gives me the shivers. I would not want to walk on looking like John Rivers
Where am I? I buy it the least the fat little freak. I did him a favorite now. We can't afford the heat
The reason I dismissed that speaking fat bastard is because he wouldn't shut up and he can't play conaster
Hey, somebody talk over there nobody talks when I rap I rap then you talk
Look at me. I'm hit I ain't no square. I'm a ding dong daddy man. I'm really dead
I buy a ready what I want I don't care
Especially if they make me flip my wig made a smelly green hair
I got fired myself and even happens to the greets Westwood once said you'll get out of here or else we break your legs
So now I sit by the pool life since good as it gets it with my paladin cocktail placing bets on the jets
Empowered ice paradise. I don't kiss nobody's hair sin power in dice
I'll be shoving up the screwkins when I get the chance that the cleaners aren't ready with my lime green pants
How long does it take?
Healthy calling for play. It was just a little thought. So what I left this thing
I think that's funny. Why not?
I was buddy. I can do what I want because the management loves me
Tell you something. Oh something you ought to know but along his time I wanted you to be my
Oh, you I might die pal now. I'm straight. Help out
1131 at 560 W. Hume you'll never believe it. I got an email from the real time jica
Okay, it is okay. He says I take it as a compliment that I haven't imitated right here

She's writing it like to you know like a third party. Mm-hmm
I know he stick is to be angry, but this is just too much. Why does he need to blast everyone?
Maybe it's me, but he's gotten too negative lately. I've listened for 10 years

And you're telling me oh these aren't the real people
See that's it if it's the real person then they will they'll identify themselves somehow like that like like Johnny dark dork right
Well, I mean Johnny dorks case just being an a hole. I mean that should be proof enough and yet you're still
skeptical okay, you want to hear the life of pros acron if you must from Barry and then at the end sincerely
I'm your friend. I'm your friend. So Barry's obviously a knitwood
The life of pros acron
pros acron is two brothers and one sister
Ron's parents had troubles with him and placed him in a program on state hospital grounds
He was there from the ages of 13 to 17. He was labeled as a manic depressive
After his stay there, he was placed in regular school one day another student came out of the classroom and punched Ron in the nose
His nose was broken into places
Maybe that's why he talks like that
Ron was placed in special ed classes and teased most of the time in school after school
He did odd jobs at restaurants pros acron was seeing a girlfriend and she accused him of child abuse
pros acron denied the accusations and fought for his rights and won fought FAUGHT
The child was the mother and former boyfriend all had the same the child the mother and the former boyfriend all had the same disease
pros acron was tested and released
He later went to settle out of court and several social workers were fired
The girlfriend was protecting the boyfriend for the crime he did
They tried to blame pros acron and Ron went to a lawyer one is case after he was tested and released
The former boyfriend went to jail for his bad crime on a child the girlfriend was blaming pros acron because he had a disability
After Ron settled his parents got him a home where he's very happy
Aren't you happy?
Not yet
pros acron has been with the same girlfriend for eight years and this Thanksgiving he fed eight people who had no families
pros acron cooked a delicious turkey and all the trimmings everyone was delighted so he could he could cook so well
He should go to cooking school
pros acron was adopted and seven years found his birth mother issue sends him any DVD he wants
She recently sent him a 42 inch plasma TV and an HP touch smart computer
pros acron's hobbies are he's a major star track fan and as every figure you can think of and as a talk radio shan of all
Fan of all shows his favorite is the nea Roger show because you all give him a voice
Sometimes people want to put him in a vacuum cleaner bag and turn it on
He still says Neil makes him laugh and pros acron is never mean when he calls in a Neil show
He laughs every time you say I'm your friend and kindly goes back to his room with all the start to figures and DVDs
So I hope you enjoyed the life of pros acron for he's a big kind-hearted guy would give the shirt off his backs and
Serly very I'm your friend
He's a bad person. He's a stalker. He deserves to be a resident or something like that. He's not funny
He's not amusing us. We've asked him nicely. I've had he needs to be put away several attempts on an off-theer to have civil conversations with him about getting him to stop
I said he's not amusing us at all
And if he died I'll throw a party the likes of which has never been seen on earth
Know what a nice place. Oh
Oh, here's one. It says from the fake lyrics King. Don't miss uh
Leroy King live tomorrow. It's got a picture of Larry with those suspenders
Brad Pitt will be in what do you think of my good friends Paul Begol and David Gergen?
They think he should go to Sirius and leave the money. Yeah, yeah
Let me go to Sirius and work for free till they go out of business then at least I won't lose anything when they show it down
Not a good idea. That's it sounds like a gay plot game plan
Now listen I threatened before to mention this and I forgot all about it and it's already Tuesday
I don't want you people to make any plans for Saturday because George's birthday is Saturday December 6th
And he's got his appearance right and if these people don't show up and treat you nice on Saturday and that tells me all I know

Is this the real time jica oh I see
Too late. I've already got the code word. Oh, and by the way back to pro-zecron if we will he has called inside a horrible obnoxious
Vile insulting things on too many occasions to count for the for Barry
Say it again Barry said that pro-zecron only says nice things when he calls
Absolutely untrue. He has called us every name in the book. He calls obnoxious. He's had to be dumped
On many occasions. He's a bad person. You said dumping. I'm gonna go do a joy. Yeah. Are you excellent? I did it turn now, you know by an hour ago
Now what does this say I'm gonna post the poll on the other side you should have a thousand by the end of the day
What other side what what does that mean on the Sun Sentinel site?
No, no, this is not from time jica's from some goofball. I see so anyway speaking of Joyce

parents and adults inflict their children on the public
Yes, speaking of your friend pro-zecron. Yes, I'm your friend. I'm your friend now. What kind of what kind of
Sane individual
And it's like letting a crazy person just run loose in the street right
I blame the family that that's exactly correct and they were right there at costume. I believe right is another funny about it
no
And of course our management they sit back up. Oh jeez you don't want us to do something do you oh jeez what are we supposed to do? We don't know what to tell you Neil
They were right there right in broad daylight could have been could have had a big butterfly net
Trapped the whole them were good to go to the fuck right there. It's illegal. It should be stopped. Yes
By the way, serious is back up to 18 cents. Whoo! I'm gonna go buy some net. It's a selling opportunity
The fake Larry King says happy birthday George. We like George. Just not on the year. Uh-huh
The guy's been on your show for years yet has no sense of nostalgia. He wouldn't know Don Cox from Don Johnson or Don Tcho. Excuse me
I'm just reading what it says. Okay, I work with Don Cox. I party with Don Cox. I hung with Don Cox. You party with him? Yeah

Coppertone girl to moon over Miami tonight will hang on building at 30 7300 Biscayne Boulevard
Coppertone girl that is an iconic image of fun and sun and Miami at hung in Miami for nearly 50 years
And I was gonna hang again
Do we care about this?
Oh wait a minute one last thing for Madeline. All right
The reason I think you're more negative is that every day you talk about serious stock and how bad it's doing
And you seem to get really giddy when talking about it the radio industry is falling apart and you're taking joy in it
I thought Neil was smarter than this. No, I'm not taking any joy in it. It's just is it's a it's just happening
I'm not responsible for it. I'm not a party to it. It's just happening
And all these people give me a song and a dance about oh you should go to serious
They're going out of business at least my paychecks go through the bank Madeline and I thought you're gone Madeline
Just one last shot typical bitch
You know what I mean? You know what I mean?

Used to have a lot of money. Yeah, you know once upon a time

Started with that fake red view del one and from there although at least that one was honest. We have no money
Yeah, I don't blame you for wanting to make money to get paid for your work and we were fresh out remember that were fresh out
They're fresh out. All right anybody that would put Alex Bennett on here that that should tell you all you need to know
You want to hear the follow-up from Barry I'm your friend. Oh, yeah, sure

When will you listen to this all right
Prozac Ron is so scared he keeps a night light on
He's afraid a Republican might be under his bed
He said that he even gave George a Star Trek doll to make peace with him. Do you do that? Yeah, but he didn't make peace
Stop action figure. Look cutus
That's our plea today. I mean it's the second of December. Okay. It's almost time to the year
It's real simple use two two groups serious people and Prozac Ron and company. Yes, stop. Just stop stop
No hate no animus no hard feelings ever. Just stop have a great life. I wish you're all the best. Just stop
Leave us alone. We don't want none to do with you serious or Prozac Ron
I know George doesn't hate Prozac Ron. He's got a heart too
George don't be upset with Prozac Ron. He likes you
Chamba and you need to be in a ring so you can fight each other like all I would love to have this agreement
Please don't hate Prozac Ron. He has issues. I'm your friend. It doesn't matter. He's got issues. All right
We don't want to be a we don't want to be the target of his issues. Okay, put him away in a room with him somewhere
Put him in there with Chamba. Hey Ron. Hi Ron. If he stops calling
It's a world having a fair with his show and jolly joebell sits on his big fat pimpley ass spewing out bloody wild uncontrollable diarrhea
Oh my god, and this is what we're stuck with
Very jackass is back again. I hope. Hopefully this one has nothing to do. Yeah

Wherever it goes, that's where this business is gone. You know, once you flush
Yeah, once it's gone. That's that's right. Once it's gone. It's just gone Scarborough added that if we had our
brothers we'd sign with citadel only because they launched Russia and Bosch on Hannity all the most
successful talk shows in the country is I explained to Mecha there are two types of radio shows
Those that have clearance on W A B C and those that don't have clearance on W A B C
It's just a radio station like New York Times is just a newspaper
But whatever that means

My whole life is about to cave in all I got left is Jennifer flavor
That's why ladies and gentlemen
I need to make Rambo foreign
Better order
Absolutely you fairy from 19 at 560 WQ I am happy Tuesday to you El Dose El Dose
They december dose it would be the 12th right right dose
Correct get a good dose. I will anyway. I just every now and then when there's a lot on those emails
I'll check the deleted ones okay just to see if some of the people I've blocked are
Back in their tricey that that's kind of a fun thing because they keep sending this stuff and they think that you're reading it and they're blocked and you're not getting it
So keeps them off the streets are on the street or whatever
This one is from Rob from Lauderdale remember him that I blocked yesterday with his racist grotesque email
Yes, who's a real chronic pain in the ass
Because nobody else has got DCC RFM at aol.com except Rob from Lauderdale who's a jerk a jackass
Good morning. What that idiot didn't tell you and this and this one was deleted by the way
I just read it just to see what kind of spew to me he was spewing
What that idiot didn't tell you about gas go energy is that six months ago
trading at four dollars
55 cent and now it's trading at 55 cents so you lost your ass if he bought it a few months ago
Great buying opportunity until the market crashes another six hundred and seventy five point no name on this one
Though as if I'm not going to recognize that email address
You're an idiot Rob you you're oh god you smell like subhuman smegma
You're nauseating
Now here's one that's more interesting from the fake Josh Cortes
And guess what it's about it's about an offer from the unmancionable ones
Oh, yeah
Neil I've enjoyed our many years and good times together but I've accepted a job at
I will be a part-time on air sidekick for forl we design their website and wipe Howard's butt form in my spare time
They're offering me a tremendous salary and stock options
So I should be rolling in dough in no time yeah grab up those stock options fake Josh
Mm-hmm
I can still work on your pitley little web page from time to time
But I'll need bbg. I stock options for that to happen
I'll miss you in George, but that Chris can rot in hell for a lot here
Please talk to jolly joe about those stock options to get back to me hugs and kisses the fake Josh
How do you like that? Mm-hmm
You're a good friend Josh Cortes joining on you like a cornered rat. Mm-hmm. And he's gonna wipe Howard's ass probably with his tongue
God
Oh, here's another one from another fake Tom jicca with another fake code word
You mentioned you had the displeasure of hearing Joseph Gackey and Don Bailey Jr. on Saturday
What did you think I think they sucked
Don makes Phil Sims like Kurt gaudy. Kurt. Er, Kurty gaudy. It says Kurty
You know, Kurty gaudy? No
He's suck and Don Bailey Jr. That's the first time I ever heard him in my in my entire life
He was bad. He like I said yesterday. He sounds like a dicky v wannabe
Oh, that was a wonderful play
You know over nothing or absolutely nothing and talk about an in-house shill my god
Rick says during the last commercial break you ran a commercial for the above of
Anyway
Well, I'm not talking about commercials with a little like the QM management and sales holes will have run a fourth of July sale next week
I see we ran a the day after Thanksgiving sale spot
Well, Rick if that's your biggest problem. I wish I could share your life
So I continue that should be your biggest problem. We made a mistake
But you know what we always make a mistake
I make a mistake every weekday morning Monday through Friday at 8 30 in the morning
I sit my ass down in this chair and this morning I listen to George going out about
Johnny F and rockets for an hour and a half that's right
Papa it was good though because you never took a breath or give me a chance to like you know
Waddel out of here and go get my shoulder
I could have made my bacon if I had an it that's right you could have gone shop is up to 54. It's up to 54 wow
So that word by the way we'll never if you hear that sound it probably is, you know yeah, just as well
right
Nazzi nauseated from them. Where the hell did that start that sunny fox is he the one that started that crap with the fake baby
the fake brick Vidal yeah.
And then poor little bald and stupid Tommy Jikker got suckered in I think to some of
that remember he wrote that stuff and they started quoting because he listens he's probably
listening right now on his horse.
Just like fat jolly Joe is listening right now too.
He wouldn't be surprised if he's responsible for that boy they love they love to farm
us out man they would love nothing more than to get rid of me and you and tubby there oh
my god.
From the fake lyric king what's wrong with Phil Sins you don't like his folksy approach
you must have hated Merlin Olson in the Denver the fake lyric king sent me the same email
yesterday and I'll say the same thing I would have said but it was after the show he
sucks with that fake affected southern draw all of his the sideline the sideline that
was a fine call on the sideline oh he's just and never shuts up he's got to get paid
by the syllable not just by the word by the syllable pop pop pop pop pop pop pop like
that once upon a time when we had the great broadcast is the great play by play guys if
there was a color guy at all which guys like scully never had a color guy they just did
the whole game by themselves they didn't need somebody to keep interrupting but back in
the day when we we didn't have people interrupting like every of two seconds interjecting a lot
of meaningless garbage like Denise pot fan the only good thing about Denise is that when
he's speaking guilty is not even George agrees with that yep so what what's the start
with guilty Chris I mean you should know I have no idea is he on the schedule now is he

Fake Larry King asked
Did you like the Dolphin game?
Some day, boring game, but Gust Johnston and Don Bebe were great
Didn't watch it fake Larry, I was on route, I was on a plane
And wouldn't watch it anyway
The Dolphins in St. Louis, I'm going to watch that, my god
My eyes hurt just thinking about that
Oh, Paul's suggestion from Greg
Glad you had the email contact now, it's great
Yeah, it is, if we get some different people on it, it will be fantastic
Neil at Neuronters.com
Just go to our webpage, NeilRotters.com
And on the right hand side there, under the mailbox
There's a thing to click, email Neil, email George, email your ass
So I've listened to you since the mid-80s
And I love your show, how about this for a Paul's suggestion?
The best or worst characters that have been mentioned or involved in your show
The Bird, Noth's Landing Lady, Bridge Tender, Alex Bennett, Gilbert, Guy with the Eyes
Mohawar David and Dada Dada, Rick Riley, Mike Disney, Tom Dennenberg,
The Scouting Lady, Fat Rich, Jimmy Johnny, Dark, etc.
The list could be huge, Diel
It says it's the holiday, it's a good time for nostalgia
Thanks for all the great entertainment throughout the years, says Greg
Thank you, Greg, I like that, you like it?
Yeah, sure, why not? You like it?
You like it?
Yeah, that's the obvious question, I think it's not bad
Of course we'd have to, you know, add a lot to it
But nevertheless
Well that's it, I think I'm done with the emails
Oh my god
And Madeline, I told you she was a heartless cruel, nasty fake bitch
Not even a real person, like you said
And you know what? What difference does it make?
It doesn't, it's all for the purpose of entertainment, all for the purpose of killing a little time, four hours a day, keep you off the streets
Let's see, here's some old emails that I never got to, they'll be very timely, I'm sure
It's like those best of tapes
Oh, we love the tapes
Alien in the Pope, those are our favorites
Let's see, I'll put that in my pile from Greg
Thanks Greg
Tim says, a wonderful combination of portabello mushrooms and bacon cover with nice slice of Swiss cheese
Would let us tomato in a touch of mayo, when these gourmet Swiss burger is a winner
Says Tim, this is from a few days ago
I'm sure it's still a winner though, even now
You ever had that? No
The one that's called the gourmet Swiss burger, what?
Sounds good
Sounds fantastic, portabello mushrooms and bacon with a nice slice of Swiss cheese
Let us tomato in a touch of mayo, oh hold the mayo, that's for goyem
Gregory says, I move from sunrise to Lareda, Florida
I remember this guy from Lareda, four years ago, but old habits never die, I can still hate
George usually is enough to keep the virus molding
But reading about Julie, women waving his magic approval wand over Obama's cabinet
Pigs really made me a joy of brick
The Democrats are about to be indebted for attempted murder by kindness, they're not vilifying the
Liberman for his horing from McCain, we'll come back to FM, says Greg
Going to come back to FM, right in the electom? Yeah, like that
Not by the way, that was not the real, I'm sure you know, the real pro-Zach-Ran before?
Of course I know
Okay, do you know that Chris? I'm your friend and I'm used cream, we use the S cream, man
Although I do believe that last part though
Uh-huh
Oh no
Well I'm reading some of these there, they're just not air-worthy
Did you hear Tony Cicarello has gone, yes?
I heard it 80 million times, I don't care
If I were there, I wouldn't watch him, silly person reading the news
It just, it's never made any sense in the beginning and it does make any sense now
Hey Tony, rip it out
And he's doing it, see he knows when to get out
I'm like me, I'm gonna keep doing this until I croak
And even if it's not on the station after the five year, if the deal doesn't work out after five years
I'll find someplace, they'll stay on KAT or somewhere, I'll buy my way on the year
And we can hire a muff to go out and sell the show, muff and your friend Bob Eisenberg
Heck of a job by the way Eisenberg, sponsored this pouring in
WQAM, hello
Hello Neil
Yes sir
WQAM, hello
QAM, hola
Yes
Hey where's the surprise yesterday with you and Ponte?
Quarter slotch
What's that?
This is a quarter slot hole
This is a good guy, Neil
In the A hole
I'll be so angry and bitter all the time
I'm not A.V. or bitter
I'm not either, I'm not good
Goodbye
What was the surprise with Ponte?
I'm not in your business
None of your freaking business, okay? My life is none of your business, none, not any of you, none
Oh but you're on the radio, exactly, that's the point
Here's one from Carlos from 8000 days ago
Neil, where did you dig up the Gilbert guy? He's a freaking nerd
Please never find this guy and put him on the radio, I guess he can use his laugh because it's funny
But please don't put him on the radio, why would we put him on the radio?
I don't know, he used to but that was 100 years ago
I don't know why people complain about George as a fellow Cuban I can appreciate all the great things he says
He's a lot smarter than all the morons who call but that's not saying much compared to all the colors of a QAM
Got that right
Thank you for not taking any calls, I hated all those people who would call up
I'm your friend and all the other stupid asses that would have nothing to say
It was a great waste of all our times
In closing, Carlos says I hate Joe Bell, Joyce, everything on QAM except you show, and then Alphans
And there are no fags in the church, not
Q, nice Carlos, Carlos knows there's just tons of fags in the church
You fairy
WQYM, hello
I'm your friend, I'm your friend, I'm no little bomb, I got a cold
I don't know who's the most serious but I take a cold
And I have a cold
WQYM, hello
Maybe he'll be dead by tomorrow, we can only hope
QAM
Hola
Mr. Rogers
Yes sir
The poll that you're planning to do tomorrow, don't do it because I was a Dan La Bastard poll
Don't do that one because he's going to rank on you if you do it
What are you talking about?
No, the one that what does the man have to know how to change your tie or how to cut his shoe?
No, no, that's not the poll we're doing tomorrow
Okay, well just don't do that
The poll tomorrow is what past features of Neil Rogers show would you like resurrected?
That's the poll for tomorrow and guess what we'll do, any poll we want to do
I don't give a crap about Dan La Bastard
Don't do this and don't do that and don't don't don't don't we're leaving and bye bye bye and that yeah
Right
They got the radio turned off so loud that the walls are shaking
Remember in the clockwork orange when they hit him locked in the room?
Yes
And they had Ludwig Vaughn just blasting at the speaker
The whole room was shaking with good vibrations from the loud music
Don't do this, don't do that, no Dan La Bastard
Give a big hiss to Dan La Bastard, okay, run in his fat, simply ass
And remind him that it was the Cubans that won the World Series back in 87 or whatever it on year was
97 what year was that?
Leavon
Yeah, 1997
Well, talk about it, got it, got off the hook
I love you Miami
I love you Miami
Huh? I love you Miami
Yeah, I love you Miami, I love you Miami, not anymore though
He's probably no longer playing right, he played for the Giants for a while
Leavon
Actually he was playing last year so he was playing with what?
My Dan La Bastard
I think the QAA is still in the low
Yeah, Neil got a couple of things
First, the city court brought out Washington, mutual, right?
You're asking me? I don't know
Well, they did
And then the city court also got a few truckloads of money from the government
They're out, no, what, Kovia?
I don't know, but anyway
Oh
Wama who is now just let us know that they're going to let 9,200 people go
So this bailouts working real good
Now secondly, quite the gasoline has come way down to about $85
But diesel fuel is still like almost $3 a gallon
And diesel fuel is less to refine in gasoline
It's lower on the refinery scale
The word you're looking for is rape
That's right
It's just another way to keep the truckers making less money
Or having to charge more and all that stuff to keep the price of time
But now most importantly, the beast is terrible on the air
He sounds like a drooling 12-year-old with a speech impediment
Right
And then he's ducked up nose
Right
I swear to God, it's horrible to hear him on that spot
It's ridiculous, he has no business here
Never again, that Thanksgiving show is the last time he's ever going to do this show
Well, I don't care about that, I mean just even spot
I don't want to hear his voice at all, he sounds horrible
Okay
Bye
Thanks
You're done beast, though, they hate you, they despise you
They wish you'd explode
That's right
Like a big balloon at somebody stuck a pin in
How about you fact Chris would stick a pin in his ass
I don't want to be anywhere near that
Or something
The biggest name
The best town
You don't have no right to make any snowy
The 5.60 Q.A.M.
The fourth league
The biggest name
The best town
You're listening to sports radio 5.60 W.Q.A.M.
My Miami for Lauderdale
It's the Lauderdale 2 hour
All right
All the white folks hate the black folks
And the black folks hate the white folks
To hate all but the right folks
Is an old established rule but during
National Brotherhood Week
National Brotherhood Week
Lena Horn and Sheriff Clark are dancing cheek to cheek
It's fun to utilize but
People you despise as long as you don't let them in your school
All the poor folks hate the rich folks
And the rich folks hate the poor folks
All of my folks hate all of your folks
It's American as Apple Pie
But during
National Brotherhood Week
National Brotherhood Week
New Yorkers love the Puerto Ricans
Cause it's very chic
Step up and shake the hand of
Someone you can't stand
You can tolerate him if you try
All the Protestants hate the Catholics
And the Catholics hate the Protestants
And the Hindus hate the Muslims
And everybody hates the Jews but during
All the National Brotherhood Week
National Brotherhood Week
It's National Everyone Smile at
One and Neverhood Week
Be nice to people who are
In theory or to you
It's only for a week so have no fear
Be grateful that it doesn't last all year
Not enough for all of them
No National Brotherhood Week
Everybody hates
They just hate
Me, they hate George
They hate each other, they hate themselves
They sure hate fat Chris
Hate
May not be good or at least they're consistent
Speaking of fat Chris, you're poor, you got 418
All right
You think you got a shot of 500?
Yeah, no, no
No, we already broke 400
We got an hour, we can do it
No
If everybody chips in, we can do it
If everybody what?
Chips in, we can do it
Back on an Erica Strata craft again
419, look at that
They're trickling by the ones
420
You need 80 votes in 58 minutes, you're not going to do it here
We're going to do it
Crazy
450 would be nice
But this is a poll that we put on like when the show started today
Don't you understand?
Is this thing on?
No
Not really
My microphone button's broken again, I just
Listen, you can't play too much
Oh, listen, I'm just...
No, that's not a complaint, that's just a statement
So you know
Observation? Right
George's mic switch is broken again for the 400th time
And that's because you can't complain about the engineering maintenance of QM
Because there isn't any
Oh, that might cost money, Neal, you don't understand
Well, we're on a limited budget now
Oh, yeah, screw you
Well, I'll tell you one thing
If they brought an efficiency expert into that place
Just in one day
Remember lots of time they did that a long time ago
Did they? Here?
I'll tell you, I'll tell you the first people to go that I would blow out of there
Besides Ray Perry
Yeah
Here's the poll, what? Sorry
You get my drift, a lot of dead weight in that place
Lots of dead weight
Lots of people sitting around at desks having meetings, stuff like that
I'd make flee the GM
Because at least he would do something for our show
At least he'd acknowledge its existence
I'm like that stiff red neck sales manager they got
What a bimbo, what a joke
What movie your TV show is the best flesh?
This is a really bad poll
Should've just been TV show, not a movie
How do you mix and match movies and TV shows, huh?
Right? Right?
Not fair
That's like asking what's the best TV show or movie show of all time?
I mean it's just silly
Spanish soap 84
Baywatch 49 with what's his name again?
David Charvet
No, Billy Warlock
Billy Warlock
It's such an unusual name
I think I'll be able to remember, I've got to
I got to be able to say for it on Billy
He kind of looks like a clone of David Charvet
At least to me
He looks about as much like David Charvet as George looks like your ass
Okay?
You're a crazy person
Billy Warlock looks like a clone of David Charvet
Yeah, they both look like these like you know a little
I don't want to grab your David Charvet in a bathing suit
He was his alright
And he was definitely not
So quit spreading those rumors
Caligula 46, Boogie Knight 36, that was a great flick
Yep
Wild Things 33, Showgirls 31, Porquies 22, Piece of Crap
Oh, you can't say that Neil, there goes your mail audience
Next you'll be knocking Caddy Shack
Basic instinct 20, Las Vegas 14, Entourage 14, sopranos 11
Girl next door 10, Romtan from Dustyildontan
Supernatural 6, who's on top, who's on the bottom?
Is it Sam, is it Dean?
Kind of, what kind of a question is that?
That was one of the emails we had, right?
Yep
Who's the bottom?
Bachelor Party 5, the BoobTube
Cube 4, Euro Trip 3, Frisky Business 3
Blue Crush 2, Touristus 2, The Tutors 2, incoming freshman 1, Sin City 1
54 only 1, Solomon Thaeuno, that's ridiculous
The OC 1, none for the Covenant, Meatballs 3, back to school to the seniors
Meatballs 3
Oh Sean
I don't know what kind of drag Sean is doing but I think a lot of people would like to share
He's definitely on heavy medication, isn't he with some of this pole cramp?
The whole ideas are almost always good but some of the selections he puts on there
Oh my God
Wow
That was up to 15, that's all, not going to get your site about
Where's my latest email from Madeline?
No, don't got one
Here's one from somebody
Love the show, but what happened to the naked woman on your site?
Oh my God, Jordan Washington's got a bad head A2 for crying out loud
What happened to the naked woman on your site?
How long, what is that?
Like two and a half years ago since we've been able to put that up?
Can't do it
That's your fascist government, okay?
We can't do it or we'll get sued and we'll go to jail with this and that, whatever
Also, if you've seen the old Sean Connery James Bond movie on high definition DVD
Now I didn't like him in the first place
There's a scene with Connery in a bathtub sporting any wrecked member
Thanks to high definition you can clearly see with, oh no
I would send you the image but you don't click on attachments
Oh and I don't want to see that
I want to see Sean Connery's member?
Oh my God, you've got to be kidding me
Is it a gold member?
A gold, yeah
It was, it was not a member, it was a finger
It felt like a finger
Here's one, it says greetings
Recently my company discovered, oh look at this, this is not...
Ahahahahahahahah
Oh, this is the best
Recently my company is discovered long forgotten bank account containing $500 billion US
These funds must be distributed to a small group of individuals
Considering consisting of Ron, Prozac, Ron, Gilbert, any other listener you feel are worthy
Please have them show up 10 miles west on Eleigator Alley at Sundown
Make sure they wear white t-shirts with bulls eyes on them
Thank you
Please, P.S. tell them my name is Joe Idiot and about it too
What does that mean? Tell them my name is Joe Idiot about it too?
I don't get that, but I like the other part
Meet this guy's got a lot of money for you guys
Hit him on the alley at Sundown
That was kind of cute
I had a double take on that one in the beginning I thought, oh don't tell me this is...
Because it didn't look like those all looked the same
In addition to which those are never addressed to you
They're not addressed to...
Undispoised recipients
Right? Right
They're never addressed to us
Oh and by the way that guy that called before was wrong and I was right for once
Just a wild guess, Citibank bought white kovia and JPMorgan Chase bought Washington Mutual
Correct
So get it right, Pally, get it right
One of the guys upset he probably lost his ass like everybody else
Here comes the buddy and there goes your money I told you take it to the track
Take it to a hard rock, take it to Gulfstream
Take it to somewhere where you might have a good time I mean you'll lose it
But nevertheless
Brian says I'm enjoying your show today except for the callers
I agree with the Ficklery King Gus Johnson is one of the best NFL announcers
I don't even know who that is
Yeah, he's a good guy. I couldn't tell you what it looks like when everybody's gone
He's a good answer
Where would I know him from?
I think he does
Oh wait no, Gus Johnson does a lot of basketball for TNT
Well I don't watch basketball
The bird was okay on W.Y.N.Z.Z.
Before in the first year on IOD but he seemed to lose interest toward the end
He never made it a year on IOD
He made it a few months
Because we went there in November of whatever year that was 8788
And by the summertime he was long gone
Once that baseball started once the cupston Harry Curie stuff started he was long gone
Head on the table
Yeah, he'd be perfect now though
Yeah
Right?
Because that whole thing made a comeback that whining and moaning
I remember he hated you talking about the cups or anything having to do with sports
Is jica really now this is interesting because it says is jica really doing a story about your career
If so it's about time I don't know he hasn't said anything to me about it
And how would this person know that?
Huh?
Right
I mean I had a couple of emails alleging that he would like to like jay what's the guy jay marvin
Who?
I have no idea. When I read from jay marvin or the W. W. W. L. S. Chicago used to work in Tampa at FLA
What slots did your friend have luck with at Hard Rock last weekend Brian? Brian's writing a book
I don't know something called extreme luckiness or extreme I don't know
Some stupid thing where it's got like sevens and bars and then if you get a match then they're like two sliding reels
With multiples you know five times three times and this and if you get a number on the first reel
And the second reel goes real slow you know and and you think you're gonna get like five times or ten times and it's just got a stop there
And it doesn't it stops just below or just above almost all the time and his didn't and he got 1600 bucks
How do you like that?
Yep
And you think I know something after reading that great book you sent me?
You know what I learned nothing here comes the bunny
Oh Madeline is back just one more time. I heard you in George saying that I'm not a real person
I am real I'm glad to send you a picture if you like maybe you can pass it on to Gildi
Oh you've got a thing about your picture.
I'll send it back a picture.
Right
It's the beak.
Maybe this is the beak.
Oh god.
You're choking me up man.
I'll send her a picture. Who do I want to be Harvey Firestein or Kate Moss?
There you go.
Boy if you sure taking her time getting the hell out of here I'll tell you.
Bye Madeline.
Bye bye.
This is your project.
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

Yeah man.
It's after two.

Notice I'm playing all oldie moldies today and I think maybe through the end of the month too.
But as well those were the fun ones.
What?
The oldies were the funny ones.
No, not the ones that we can play.
The oldies that we can't play.
Those were the funny ones.
Maria B is back.
Maria Bartoromo, the fake one.
Take it from the horse's mouth.
City group attempted to purchase walk-cov-y, but the video was rejected.
Wells Fargo purchased walk-cov-y, and we'll be keeping the name the same for the next 12 months.
A perfect example of how our free markets operates is the Grotesque Maria.
Make sure to catch me this afternoon on the closing bell since silly Maria B.
Take it right from the horse's ass.
Oh, do I even want to read these from a very on-ear friend?
You tell me?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Thank you.
Well, that's a little teach them the silly old goat he's dead.
We can hear the voice.
Can you fire George when you ask him a question he just answers.
is yep, adding nothing to your question.
Whenever you need information on something,
George would be on top of it.
Instead, he seems out of it,
almost like he's not into his job anymore.
What would you be?
Would that 3% raise he's getting next year?
Would you be into your job?
He probably surfs for porn during the show
and his father at any time you ask him to chime in.
George, get your act together already, says John.
John James.
Likely story, John James might ask.
Oh, here we go, the China Cultural Center Award for 2008.
I've been awarded $80 million,
not all I got to do is send them my shoe size and et cetera.
And my penis on a platter.
441, that thing ain't moving.
I bet your Eric's got the break on just to piss you off.
He hates you.
443, what do you think about that?
Very happy, Tommy.
Yeah, you pleased?
We're gonna get it.
Oh, the sun is peaking through.
I can't believe it.
That's the first time I see the sun
since I left Florida.
Boy, that must be warming things up.
I bet it's like at least 35.
What do you think?
Okay.
No snow.
It's already December 2, it's zero, it's 32.
Why bet you it's a toasty zero though.
You know the difference between like a toasty,
tolerable zero and a really freezing ass cold zero?
No, what's the difference?
I think John James has got a point.
Mm-hmm.
How you doing on there, Alfas?
So you get up to 450 or what?
Before you get to 500, you got to get to 450.
448.
448, we got a chunk.
We got a clump.
Oh, we got a clump.
Do you ever have a clump?
Just this morning.
Oh, God.
Well, I tell you one thing, when I made that mad dash earlier,
I don't want to get too graphic, but wow.
Holy moly.
Woo.
Even I was scared to death by that.
Where are you?
Even Barry, I'm your friend says,
do you think George has upset at Prozac Ron?
If we have many nice things that was given to him,
while George has to work for his things he gets,
don't you let the rationalities.
The rationalities?
It's very simple.
Stop calling and no more animus.
It's very simple.
That plasma TV in HP is very cool.
Job needs to be on medications and therapy.
So, George, why don't you and Prozac Ron talk one day?
You might find he's very resourceful and good.
We did.
We did.
I have to invite you to dinner.
You and he are good people.
Plus Prozac Ron brings your ratings up.
Oh, yeah.
Damn, you're put the show off the year.
Plus you should give him a chance at least to be on time
unlike Chris who's always later no shows.
I give him a chance.
I'm going to take him to medications sincerely.
Barry, I'm your friend.
He, he, he, he, he, he, he, he.
It's got about 85 he-he's.
I tried on several occasions to have a rational conversation
with him both on and off the phone.
You can't have rational conversations
with an irrational, with an irrational person.
That's right.
Oh, my God.
Oh, oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
I just received the worst memo.
The last memo I got from the station
that was this bad was a little about no food, you know?
Yeah.
From jolly jobell in that piece of turd clearance.
I'm not done crying, by the way.
From Josh Dero,
December 2nd, 2008,
carbon copy jolly jobell.
And what's that just talking about this before?
Just let the other blow out of there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She wasn't, it wouldn't be one of them.
Uh-uh.
See, the wrong people get screwed.
That's right.
People have their nose up clearance
and jobells ass.
They, they're the ones that get shoved out the door.
This is, this is an infomnia.
I'm sad to have to tell everyone
that Allison Turner is no longer with WQAM.
Due to the downturn in the economy and cutbacks here
at the station,
Allison's position has been eliminated from the budget.
Allison was a great asset to the station
and to me is the executive producer.
She was a tremendous worker
with a great passion for WQAM.
It's very unfortunate as are the economic realities we are facing today
as a radio station
from Clarence Freakin Dero.
How do you like that?
I don't know.
I don't know.
And that's because she'd like this show.
And she's not one of those people, you know,
like Ray Perry, for example.
What, what does he do there?
I'm not sure.
He parks underneath the building in an expensive car.
Yeah.
I'm done.
I mean, Maddie Bell, of course,
Maddie Bell was Jewish.
Allison, is she Jewish?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
Well, better tell them that they might change their mind.
Of course, parents is Jewish.
That doesn't seem to make any difference with them
because he's got the naked pictures
of the beastlies and the billy goats.
He's got a gigantic decanter full of jolly joe bells,
bloody diarrhea.
And he's saving it as evidence.
If I were you, I'd go in there and I'd scour through his drawers.
No, sorry.
Look, he was doing that one day.
He was scouring through his drawers.
I almost vomited.
I almost fell off the chair and discussed.
454, and just as a thought that he might find something
and they're all the way doubted.
455 on your point.
You need 45 votes in 37 minutes.
You're closing the gap, baby.
You've got a chance to redeem yourself.
So what, what do you make of that?
The fact that they chose her to blow out and eliminate her.
What do you mean what do you make?
We talked about the fraternity since the first week I was in this building.
And she wasn't part of it.
No, she's not a guy.
First of all, she is Jewish.
But second of all, she's not a...
Why do you say no?
I said, I don't think so.
Well, how do you know she is then?
Because I was just told that she is.
Uh-huh.
See?
But she's not a mad guy.
Hey.
Jewish.
Eddie K. Jewish.
Niels contracts sliced in half.
Jewish.
I think the ADL ought to get involved in this.
What do you think?
Or the ADD.
Yeah.
Now, what were you saying before I so rudely interrupted?
That she's not a guy.
She's not part of this jock-huffing fraternity over here.
She's a radio person.
Even though she is a big sports fan, as you know.
So sad day.
Mm-hmm.
A very sad day.
Sad, sad day.
At QAM.
People who do a good job, people actually are there for a purpose that we can define.
They get stoch.
A real stoch right in the old...
Brackum.
At ass.
But people who we can't even...
We can't even determine what they are doing there.
As long as they have their nose in the right place.
Brackum.
Here we go again.
It's a busy ass.
They stay forever.
Like the beast, for example.
What the hell does he do there?
You mean who?
What is his purpose there?
What is his function besides being a trouble making waddler up and down the hallway?
What does he do?
Again, do you mean who?
Who does he do?
Clarence.
We know that.
You ever seen that big gigantic economy-sized family-family-sized jar of gasoline on
the ground?
Yeah.
That's him and the beast.
Very sad.
Yes it is.
But believe me, there's more to come.
Trust me when I say it.
I better...
You better watch your backpack, Chris.
Well, not Jewish.
Oh, that's true.
Hey, we got a goi on the show.
We got two goi-im.
Mm-hmm.
That counterbalances me.
Plus I'm an atheist anyway, so I don't cut that much.
That counter is only part you.
So, you're late.
It's a back talent.
It's a DJ show.
We're nights for being to alive in Iran.
But sports for you.
5.6 feet.
2.8.
V.
Sports.
Me, oh God.
Thanks, Flee.
Flee fixed the rejorns.
He's a heck of a gun.
I need eight piles of rostracing.
Two vis-a-fee beaches of Miami.
That's all it takes to reach it.
Say the Taliban.
This gate plans.
This gate plans.
This gate plans.
Look away, the rat that was on our head.
Now we have to use toilet paper instead.
This gate plans to Miami.
Next target of the attack.
A tropical paradise loaded with epiphythia.
We're out there.
The sun.
The sun.
They're serving us ice tea at the end.
But we really rather dreamt our day.
Slash a few throat-sensees of hope.
Point to towards Miami and off we go.
To where the angry humans slaughter their goat.
To the attack.
Attack.
Attack.
Attack.
That's our plan.
This gate plan.
This gate plan.
The plan.
Our plan.
This gate plan.
131.65 WQAM.
We're out there.
We're out there.
We're out there.
We're out there.
We're out there.
We're out there.
We're out there.
We're out there.
We're out there.
We're out there.
We're out there.
We're out there.
We're out there.
We're out there.
We're out there.
We're out there.
We're out there.
We're out there.
We're out there.
We're out there.
In here.
to check your email.
Mark.
Right now.
Is there a picture there?
Let me do the old son of a kid.
Madeline who was certainly not Madeline, but is also illiterate.
Please, I send my picture to George.
Please tell him to look for it.
I send my picture.
Illiterate.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
And?
Forwarded it to me.
Sure.
Now, what is it?
It's a fat lady, but it's not.
I could send her a picture of Christ and say it was me.
I mean, you know.
I understand.
It's part of the game.
The whole thing with the emails is just a game now.
Which is fine.
As long as we get stuff.
You know what I mean?
Let me save it and then send the actual pictures so you don't click on that.
As long as we get stuff like this.
But a beep, but a boop, but a bob.
Oh yeah.
Think about it easily.
Likely story.
It's probably from Joe Bill.
Oh, well, you know, we got all the Nile.
We got to keep Nile and pay him about 50 bucks a week.
Here's the fake Barry Jackass who's starting to really, really get under my skin.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
And you choose to stick around with these grave robbers question mark as if I have a choice.
When the last contract ended, remember that period of time and we were waiting and waiting
and normal was sitting there waiting for the phone to ring.
There was absolutely no interest in the erudgers by anybody for any amount.
There was no offer, not a dollar, not a dime, not a nickel, not a loony, not a toony, nothing,
not a zip and doodah.
See the thing that Joe Bell did first successfully when it came in.
I was screaming about this at the time is he was devaluing my value in the market and the
show.
You thought he was stupid and then he did a fabulous job and you know, it came on at the
anyway.
That's just where it is.
Yeah, I choose to stick around like I got a choice.
Guess what?
I got bills to pay.
Okay.
I want income and I'm like, I'll you idiots out there.
Oh, you need to go over and sign up with this.
Go to FM.
Yeah, go to hell.
That's my suggestion.
That Barry Jackass fake wheel or whoever.
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
Okay.
Am I going to be able to find that picture of Madeline?
Check your box.
The fake Madeline, huh?
Check your inbox.
Okay.
There it is.
Emailing Madeline.
Let me click the attachment.
Oh, boy.
Yeah.
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God.
She's all over.
She's got away 200 pounds.
Sure.
That's a full figure if ever there was one.
Of course.
Of course.
That's a full figure.
That's a full figure.
That's a full figure.
That's a full figure.
That's a real girl.
And you know, that's not really her.
Oh, God.
That's the board and calories there ever was.
But that's part of the game.
You know, that's turned into a game which is fine.
Like the phone's turned into a game, but that's an audio game.
Much more annoying and much more difficult to control.
Well, if Neil would just screen the calls like George does, yeah, right.
I don't want to screen the calls and I don't want to do like George does.
George does his thing.
I do my thing.
Not in a lot of ways.
Yeah, that's right.
But we both like Johnny F. and Rocket.
So I'll tell you that.
A lot.
Yes.
No items in this view.
Well, that's a shame.
After seeing that beautiful picture of the gigantic booby fake Madeline.
Mm hmm.
How do you like that?
See, this is this is the end and believe me.
Twenty four minutes will be out of here and then I'll go on with my life.
Right.
But the concept now that they got the emails, it's another way to get through to us.
Abuse the host.
Abuse the people on it.
Sure.
That's the soft floor mentality.
Don't have anything to say because they never had anything to say on the phone.
Why should they have anything to say on the email and they don't?
For the most part, they have nothing.
Zero.
And thank God for all the fake to fake this one and fake that one because they're the ones who made this email thing.
Whatever it is.
You know what I'm saying?
Mm hmm.
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, yeah.
Chris has got a chance in 500.
Oh, this is going to be tight.
469.
What do you got?
471.
Twenty four minutes.
29 votes.
Yeah, 471.
Can you do it?
Yep.
Come on people as he would say.
Let's go.
I'm not going to get in gear.
Oh, and I'm not the least bit interested in the beastly report out of concare less.
Who's this from?
Oh, HHHGHLMNOP.
Lucky strike me.
It means fine tobacco.
This is from last week.
Neal, did you hear?
This is the day after we talked about it.
A length on the air.
After we had 500 emails about it.
Did you hear Tony Cicareto has gone with a whole bunch of exclamation points.
Thank God I won't have to watch this silly person with gigantic ears anymore on TV.
A whole bunch more exclamation points.
His face truly made me ill each time.
It was forced to look at him when I watched the news.
He was forced to look at him.
Here's another guy sitting there with a gun to his head.
Oh, you got to watch that like the people who are forced to listen to this show.
Now we must do our best to remove the following losers from TV broadcast media.
Here's the list of incompetence.
You want to hear it?
Sure.
Madeline will be upset because Geldies on here.
One, Joe Zagaki, truly embarrassing on the air.
I have no life.
Absolutely correct sir.
Two Jimmy Mannwich.
What all of a sudden he does interviews.
Mannwich fears LeBaster.
Three Joe Rose, sings like a sissy and sucks it off an ass.
An addition sucks Drew Rosenhaus has.
Lonella the second going on.
For Geldie Gelstein.
At best, a junior high broadcaster.
The late-year-old girl's voice.
Five Kimba Bo camper pushing 300 pounds.
His fat face doesn't fit the TV screen and illiterate the boot.
Six Randy Moore, a buffoon who yells and screams with fake excitement.
Seven Denise Pothvan, a frog, simply a frog.
And eight.
Jimmy Cifilis, the most horrific NFL broadcaster ever.
Jimmy sounds worse than that wicked diarrhea feels and smells like.
Oh, this must be from Jolly Joe Bell.
Mm-hmm.
Sounds like the voice of experience, don't it?
Don't not anyone.
Boy, you know something I was thinking about the other day and thank God that you don't know my...
Don't know my...
Yeah.
For something on TV.
Some ad.
Oh, yeah, it's for CHFIs from one of the FM stations.
They got a good on-air TV campaign.
All of this is good as ours.
And the one seeing the buffoon guy from the morning show is he's in the meat locker and he's got a big donut that he's eaten.
Or a bouti when he gets caught.
That was up only 159 by the way.
And then got me started thinking about donuts.
You know how impressionable all fat people are and everybody else too.
And I didn't eat any but I started thinking about crispy cream.
Are they still in business?
Yeah.
Yep.
Because once the carb things started making a comeback and people started realizing they're dying from donuts.
They thought, but those things are pretty good but not that good.
Are you willing to die for it?
You know?
Kind of like Steven Strait.
I'm willing to die for that.
I'm dying for it.
But not for crispy cream.
You need 24 votes and 21 minutes.
Come on, fat, Chris, can do it.
What's your name?
The word of the word.
You don't have no logic.
Sport Radio 560 QAM.
The fourth leader.

It's the big O.
Orlando Elzo Gary.
Afternoon, 2 to 4.

Follow me.
Down south.
Where the mudwings go?
To hang from trees and play banjo.
You got some food on a station on.
You banged old raiding old boy.
Now as North Carolina goes.
Rolly's a big city and old.
And that's where the beeswings had to go.
For Golly Riley Joe.
A new GM.
He'll do what he can.
Shake your hand like a friend.
And quickly walk away.
Absolutely.
They have Joe.
Go to 560 with ratings.
And the toilet mold to get those.
Flaming sportful moths.
An order and control.
And then so.
Golly Rolly Joe.
A bugger.
And in the know.
Let's go.
And here's what blows.
Golly is on show.
You make the big change.
And read a range.
It's worse or the same.
He hasn't done a thing.
For what goes.
All the air at 2.
Joe.
Don't have a stinkin' clue.
about a four, not mad essentially blows for all radio, the GM of 560 Charlie,
Riley Joe. Oh boy, I'll tell you what a life. I just got my lunch order. Good thing I got
a great sense of humor, you know. Text me, text mex, um, jalapeno, what the hell I think
rules. Okay. What do you call those things? I thought you just called them crispy text mex
rules and chicken Parmesan or as Mr. Ego would say chicken Parmesan with peppercorn
cha. That's an interesting combination. Yeah. Well, he's an interesting guy, not 481 on your
pull. I thought you were going to do it now. I'm not so sure. We're going to do it 485, 14 minutes,
15 votes. They're going to do it. You load 16 votes and what do you get? I love that song,
man. Tennessee, let's play it. It's a song coming up. Here's one from a subitiate. Can't stand
Dan. This is a handle. Something Randy, Neil, what do you think of the Randy Moulershitch where he
screams crazy lines from random move. Thank you for random movies that are fed to him by the
labaster listeners when the Panther score, which is not often. I don't think of it because I don't
hear it. I don't know about it. I don't care about it. How do you like that? Can't stand
Dan. Can't stand the stupid email. What about labaster? All these other people in the market
who desperate for me to like, you know, talk about them on a year. Croca crap. Croca
something, man. Make no mistake about it. I'm going to have to order lunch here pretty
soon. So I'll let you finish the show. Oh, what a panic. 485 vote. You still need to
pay 15. That's not not making too much progress there, Mr. Hodgeot. You're watching
me a whole bunch of it once 486. There is one. Eric's going to take his foot off the pedal.
Yeah, sure. 486. You need 14. I'm almost willing to count this one down because this is going
to be tight. It's going to be really tight. So you're getting another picture by the way
from Madeline. Oh, no. I got it. I deleted that email. The previous one. Well, they're
sending me web pictures. Some guy on the beach in a speed. Oh, now. Oh, great. I'm just
getting random email. You know, web pictures like you know. So there is no Madeline. There
is no person. Well, there is somebody in that picture with the big boobs. Yeah. Well,
you talk about a salt with a day and dangerous weapon. My God. Each one of those things
had a way at least a hundred pounds. Am I right? They had the run area codes. Each one
of those boobs was like its own person. Oh, here's one from your friend Barry Macockner.
Don't know if you heard, but so Tony. Tony Segredo's retiring. And then it says,
Recar. Nothing like feeding my material back to me. Barry. Hey, Barry, you fairy.
I think of my name was Barry. I changed it. Like Barry Jackass. 487 on the
Chris's pole. It's not a good pool. Don't let me forget to change it later on this afternoon. 488.
You got 12 minutes and 12 votes you need. You got a narrow down. You got the margin narrow down
to a very precious view. You need 12 votes in 12 minutes. Nope. 10 votes. 10 votes in 12 minutes. Oh,
hallelujah. Happy day. Chris saves his job. All right. By the way, we're sorry. I'll listen,
believe me profusely. Did I ever meet her? Did she come to the thing in Gulf Stream? No,
she hates clouds. Remember? Oh, I never met her, but she was always very nice to me into this show,
which is a hard one. I didn't blow out 491. A real nice person. Very competent. Did a good job.
Whatever she was doing. We only have a three minute break in his last break. Is that correct?
He's looking for. He's looking for. Well, there's so many units in there. You know, I mean,
we got too many units in our sales department. Remember, we had all the tens and the 15s and the five.
Let's start selling two second spots, two cents for a two second spot. Like playing a two-cent
machine at Hard Rock. What do you think? Sure. Madeline. I just said another picture. Well,
by I think I'm going to block Madeline. Okay. Let me just block Madeline and then he can make up
some other stupid name. That's right. It's the game. It's the game. It's the game. That's QAM. It's the
game. Tell us about the game. Tell us about the fight. How can that still be going on, by the way?
What? Boxing. Boxing and bullfighting. How can it be going on? Lots of barbarians. Now, maybe it's
a bad comparison because at least the boxes are willing participants to agree. Right. Right. And the
bulls are not. How can those things still be going on? I think George said barbarians. That's what I
said. I think you're right. Oh, and I almost never got to this story. Thank the Lord. We got time for
this gay Bible angriest Christians. A gay version of the Bible in which God says it's better to be
gay than straight as to be published by an American film producer. How do you like that? It's better to be
gay than straight. New Mexico based revision studios will publish the Princess Diana Bible. So
name because of Dan is many good works. It says online at princess Diana Bible.com in spring 2009.
A preview of Genesis is already available in which instead of creating Adam and Eve, God creates
Ada and Eve. And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Aida and she slept and he took
one of her ribs and closed up the flesh instead they were out in the rib which the Lord God had
taken from woman made he another woman and brought her under the first and Aida said this now
bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh will be called woman because she was taken out of me.
Therefore she'll a woman leave her mother and she'll cleave under her wife and they
shall be one flesh and they were both naked. The woman and her wife and they were not ashamed.
I bet she they didn't look like Madeline. The film studio said it would also adapt and
direct the revised Bible as a two-part mini series. The gay Old Testament and the gay New Testament
once it's completed. Good. There are many different versions of the Bible. I don't see why we
can't have one said Max Mitchell who directed the science fiction comedy Horror in the Wind
in which the newborn formula invented by two biogeneticists reverses the world's sexual orientation.
Everybody becomes gay. Even Stephen Strait. I got the idea from Princess Diana Bible from horror
in the wind he added after the world becomes gay religious people create the Princess Diana Bible
which says that gay is right and straight as the sin then they burn all the King James Bibles.
The movie has already provoked a upset among Christians which the blogger Douglas Howard
idle chatersides describing it as inspired by a political agenda and one person to decide a
concert not only the text but the very context of it to suit his own perspective.
There was also criticism on Mitchell's Princess Diana Bible site. One commentator said the
choice of title was very respectful disrespectful to the late Princess Diana. Just one more thing
the linker to what main people believe is immoral. Sad very sad indeed it's a to which I say
screw Diana does anybody in this country care about Diana yeah they do fat shut-ins oh
fake baby Madeleine maybe Madeleine can maybe yeah maybe he does and I just dropped oh you know
that slot I told you about here on this board all on the floor oh okay so around my dilemma is
what do I do first do I pick up all the crap off the floor or do I get on the phone order lunch
five hundred
down
about a girl called Cifullet So
had a bug and ran it around
gave it to every guy in town
Hey hey, I'm a little old
Oh, hey hey, I'm a little old
I'm a little old, I'm a little old
Oh, hey hey, I'm a little old
I'm a little old, I shouldn't notice
on this bottom of the lid
I end up with a urine erasure
A bottle of old always be with you
So stay away from a Cifullet suit
It took a close I should have seen on my sides
No defense of a friend of mine
You got it back to now I've got it too
So keep away from a Cifullet suit
Hey hey, keep away from that girl
Hope that the Cifullet will do now
Keep away from suit
She likes to sleep around
Yeah, even did it with my back at home
We didn't think I'd know to call
Now I'm afraid of falling on
Here's the moral of the story
From a guy who knows
Use to have the holds where this fungus grows
And scared he pulled out the chieftain's nose
A keep away from a Cifullet suit
Yeah, keep away from that girl
I don't know why I've been doing that
Bye bye bye
The biggest names, the best call it
And your holds for Miami Dolphins football
And the statistics, Bortrady O'560 WQAM
Miami, cord loaded
You
