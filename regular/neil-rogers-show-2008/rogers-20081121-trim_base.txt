The music expressed on the pre-show programs are those of the hot dogs keen. Oh, yeah.
It's staffed advertising. Serious 16 cents a year. Grab it up.

You have an acerapal and unscripted uncensored unleashed. Right now on Mary King Law.
I will do what the people of Alaska want me to do. My life is in God's hands and he's got doors open for me.
I've actually come up to Alaska, especially look at the resources. Again, I'm not going to close any doors of opportunity.
And the door is open for me to do so. It would be something that I am who I am though.
And I call it like I see it in some of those questions, you know, regarding
I'm not going to close any doors that perhaps would be in front of me and with
I'm not going to close any door there in terms of opportunity to make either in the future.
My life is in God's hands. He's got doors open for me.
What a story. I'm not going to close any doors of opportunity.
Don't interrupt.
You're almost out of time so quickly.
Are you ready to run for the presidency? Is that something that would
I'm not going to close any door there in terms of opportunity that may be there in the future.
But at this point, you don't run race to lose. My goodness.
I'll be back here.
I'm going to waste those cash out of the rest of those.
Now I can't wait to go.
I'm going to throw a punch in the ass on the way up.
Sarah, it's 10-01 at 560 WQA. I'm Friday, November 21.
Thanks to George for filling the yesterday with a scratchy throat or I had it.
Right.
I'm still a little scratchy but not too bad.
And I got a whole bunch of stuff that I didn't get to get to yesterday.
And since today we got a short show.
Well, 25 were out of here. We got UN basketball.
Again, Southern Miss from the Paradise Jam. Jam.
My ass. Are you kidding me? Oh my God.
Right in the middle of the daytime when people are awake.
They'll put any swill on the station if there's a bunch of guys in Jockstrap's.
Man, they love it. They're sniffing it. They're looking it.
Anyway, here's one of my all-time favorite emails.
Kemen on Wednesday afternoon. Right near the ass end of the show.
From the fake Mason Williams. I think this one's got too much classical gas.
He says satellite radios got over 100 channels, dummy.
Come on. Right now I'm listening to Stern and he's freely discussing his bathroom habits
with the freedom only satellite radio gives him.
Well, you can't even play fart sounds.
Now here is the best. This is the greatest thing in the history of my life.
Well, you can't even play fart sounds. Stern is actually having guys take a crap in the studio.
Oh, right. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you know what I was listening to.
Well, see I can go to woodbine and walk into the tea room and here guys take crap for free.
I just did that.
What this morning I heard somebody take a crap for free.
I heard me take one. Didn't hear any sound.
Yeah, what was it to wet? Somebody was in the stomach.
This is revolutionary radios, is Mason Williams.
Viva la revolution on PS fish foods sucks. Yeah, right.
Just another hostile negativity as if I really care what you like.
Obviously your taste is in your tussles, okay?
Gonna pay so I can hear guys taking a crap talk about Safamorek, talk about childish, talk about juvenile.
God, give me a frickin break.
Oh, you actually have a guy's take a crap in the studio.
Wow, I'd sure pay to hear that.
Serious stock 16 cents. It was down to 14 yesterday at one point,
but it made a nice recovery there all the way back up to 16 cents.
Yeah, they're kicking ass.
There's over 100 channels and mostly music.
And mostly watched up talk I has bins or never was,
like Alex Bennett and Lynn Samuels and people like that.
And if it's so great how come Bubba's going back to terrestrial radio in January?
Isn't that a good question?
Yep.
If guys are making so much money and if this thing has got so much promise and this is the future and revolutionary yada yada,
by the way, fish food is great and if you don't eat any Mason, that leaves that much more for me.
Although I'm off the carbs, man.
I'm off the carbs. I was getting to a point where I'm just playing with fire, you know.
It's going to be the next Bob Lasseter feet chopped off, you know, kidneys failing, blindness, stuff like that.
So no more. I was lucky I was able to get to this point so far, I think,
without any of those things happening, but when you got to diabetes, man.
As Wilfred Brimley says when he got diabetes, he can't even pronounce the word they got him doing spots.
I think that's why.
Is that diabetes?
It's in your head diabetes.
Oh, diabetes.
Kind of like a shack in the icy sleeve, you know, he can't say it sleeves, but he's doing the spots.
I wonder if fact Chris ever used the icy sleeve.
Nope.
I bet you some of our jocks and if there's a Q.A.M. who got that icy sleeve right up each other's ass.
Now, I know this comes as a great shock to you.
Well, George had a poll on there yesterday and I got that off of there like at two o'clock.
Right. We put it on a tent.
It was, you know, that's, that's okay. You had 490 votes. It's not bad.
That is good as that ice cream.
I have a poll on there that's got 606.
But now I switched it to the one for the weekend because I like it.
Somebody different set it in to.
I don't know who this is.
I am that hemorrhoid sent it in.
Jerry Reynolds want to be.
So here's the results of the previous two polls, which I don't think we've ever done this.
And then we got the third one up there for today in the weekend.
Here's George's what's your take on all these bailouts?
bail out my ass. That was that was what I wrote.
That's 66.
Take a big bailout to bail out my ass.
Especially fact Chris, can you imagine bailing out that ass?
Wow.
Back to make a lot of cash.
They're doing it the wrong way. 106.
There shouldn't be any bailouts 90.
They're all a bad idea. 34.
I don't understand the 28.
They're all necessary 28.
I'm only in favor of the auto industry bailout 21.
I'm only in favor of the finance and industry bailout 17.
Boy, they got some real service there man city bank and GM and Chrysler and Ford and this one and that one and us.
When they bail on us out.
Here's the next one.
Now this is a Charlie B one, I guess.
Who are or were your favorite all time company duo?
Jackie Gleason, our colony are tied with teaching chong 93 of peace.
I see a lot of similarities there and not 606 total.
Abbott and Costello 70.
I can't believe we got that many old people remember but Abbott and Luke Costello.
Remember that?
Oh yeah.
They weren't a lot of those Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein meet the werewolf.
Right.
Tim Conway and Harvey Cormin 63.
John Cleason, Michael Pellan 33.
Now I don't I don't get it.
I don't remember them as being a duo.
I remember this part of money Python.
Right.
Were they a duo?
Not my.
And what's money Python without Eric Idol?
Right.
Laurel and Hardy 33, Gene Wilder and Richard Prior 32, Silver Striek baby, Silver Striek.
The Smothers Brothers 24, the Blues Brothers 24, Penn and Teller 21, Martin and Lewis, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.
Hello, lady.
Twenty.
Bob and Ray 16.
They got my vote because I'm an old toad and they were really funny.
They were great.
Bob and Ram.
Sure they both did.
Who?
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
And Ray Elliott.
I think that's what their names were.
Bob Goulding and Ray Elliott.
Well, what a memory.
God for an old toad like me to have a memory like that.
That's shocking.
Amos and Andy 13.
Jack Clarkman and Tony Randall 12.
I don't think they were a comedy duo.
They were in the on couple.
But I mean.
Yeah.
Well, a lot of these people.
I mean, that's all they were.
Is it movies together?
Yeah.
Click and clack.
The car talk brothers 12.
I have no idea who they're still.
Click and clack.
Harold and Kumar 11.
I have no idea who they are either.
Burns and Allen 10.
George Burns and Gracie Allen.
And what about Ronnie Allen?
I looked him up.

He was the adopted son of Burns and Allen.
And he was sure a pretty boy.
Tina Fey and Amy Poler 9.
Rowan and Martin 8.
Bob hoping to be in Cross V7.
Again, not a comedy duo.
They weren't a lot of stuff together.
But again, who cares?
Smith and Dale 1.
Stiller and Miro 1.
Faa.
Faa.
What do you know about that one?
Yeah, that's it.
And Lemon Abner None.
Out of 606.
So there's the second.
Boy, you're reading a lot of numbers.
Neon, you're only on the 12.45 today.
To which I say.
Oh, right, right.
How about some canes?
Yeah.
They got pasted.
They stuck the joint out, man.
It was pathetic.
And by the way, Faa.
Chris, you know what you forgot to say today?
What?
Harricite.
You know what I mean?
Well, here's it.
Here's the new pool.
It's up there right now.
Let's get a whole bunch of votes on there just to make us feel good.
12.45.
I'm going to have my clothes on, my shoes.
I'm going to be in that cab with my lesbianies cab driver on the way to Woodvine at 12.46.
But that was up 100 points.
Don't get too excited about it.
Boy, it's bad.
It is bad.
And even though I've been warning you, here comes the bunny and there goes your money.
I've been begging you.
Please, put it out of the mattress.
Send it to us.
All you people, all you schmucks out there.
Oh, it's a buying opportunity.
Maria Maria.
And I think what they had to do is hang Maria on the air.
Her and all those other peddlers on the gambling channel.
Oh, it's a buying opportunity.
Yeah.
Well, how about when a doubt gets down to about 3,500?
Or maybe that'll be a buying opportunity.
Double down.
Yeah, double down.
That's the way to do it.
Double on down.
And that's Schmittrix.
Let's take a look at Sirius and see if it's still hanging in there at 16.
Yeah, 16 set of share.

Send everybody money.
Oh, and Dan from Maryland said I could lower them $50 and buy everybody.
Yeah, they pick up the crap that you say and right away he knows me.
Buying a good buy, Dan.
Go away.
Go get yourself some Sirius help.
God, some of these email people just hostile.
And if they really at any point ever enjoyed the show, what's the point in taking out their hostility on me?
I guess because I'm here, right?
Or are you or both of us?
Sure.
Or even on fat Chris with the punching bags.
Fat ass jolly joe bell five votes.

No portion of this program will be reproduced without the express spread.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You see the broadcast group incorporated.
It's thought to up Friday.
You bastards.
Sirekite.
F***ing blow.
Sucks the fiat turkey in November.
Counting down the last days of your life.
Cable, cable, cable, cable, cable.
Gotta make sure that you're always sober.
Or you'll wind up eating some guy's knife.
They never know when it's coming.
It's like being on death row.
Cable, cable, cable, cable.
So they spend their whole life bumming.
Wondering why they weren't born with a big toe.
Cable, cable.
Cable, cable, cable, cable.
Giving out a mating call.
Cable.
The females go cable, cable, cable.
Hoping they do not wind up a butter ball.
Because it sucks the fiat turkey in November.
Cable, cable, cable.
Counting down the last days of your life.
Cable.
Gotta make sure that you're always sober.
Cable, cable, cable.
Or you'll wind up eating some guy's knife.
Cable, cable, cable.
This time of the year is a pain.
Cable, cable, cable, cable.
There's no place to run and hide.
Cable, cable.
Cable, cable, cable.
Honey, down like a dumb who's saying.
They won't hang you but you might wind up be pride.
Cable, cable, cable.
Be pride.
I knew a turkey named Kevin.
Yeah, he's not.
Who wound up with his throat caught?
He wasn't pretty.
When people die they go to heaven.
But the poor birds get croutons stuffed up their butts.
That's why it sucks the fiat turkey in November.
Cable, cable.
Counting down the last days of your life.
Cable, cable.
Gotta make sure that you're always sober.
Cable, cable.
Boreal, wide up feeding some guys night.
Oh my god, I don't have time for this.
I gotta listen to Howard having guys taking a crap in the studio.
Oh my god.
G, can we see a video of that too?
Oh yeah.
Woo.
I mean, of all the things to pick out, you know.
Oh geez, Neil, you don't understand.
The satellite radio is where it's at.
No, it's not.
And there's a real good chance that in a few months it's going to be.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
The merger was supposed to bail their ass out.
And they're just drowning in a sea of debt, drowning.
And now that nobody's got any money and we've got the George Bush depression going on.
And nobody's buying any cars that have the satellite, you know, already installed.
Mm-hmm.
Looks pretty bleak.
But then again, what do I know?
Sonny Fox, by the way, is a crazy person.
Sorry, that's the real sonny Fox and some of that stuff.
He sent me a self-aggrandizing thing about how he's going to be doing this.
He's going to be doing it.
I don't really care.
I don't care about your sonny.
Nobody else does either.
You're old news, man.
Ancient news.
And by the way, speaking of ancient news, what are we going to be Secretary of State?
It's as close to official as it has been yet.
Yeah.
And a move that has political insiders shaking their heads and many supporters of the first African-American president-elect fuming.
Barack Obama said to tap Hillary Clinton as a secretoristic senior AIDS confirmed that he'll name it.
So, Larry, after Thanksgiving, after Bill Clinton agreed to curtail his off-and-controversial activities with this foundation and cut back on his foreign travel and speeches, he's going to hang out with the Monica and shut up.
He's going to shut his mouth.
The Monica is going to open hers.
The decision infuriates many Obama supporters.
A field of nation needs a clean break from the politics of a past that includes both Clintons.
Others are worried that the Clintons will use the powerful cabinet post to pursue their own agenda, even when it conflicts with the policies of Obama.
Despite the worries, Obama appears to have made his decision.
It's swillery.
Oh.
Oh, well.
Maybe she'll bring peace to the world.
Yeah, there you go.
Yeah.
Peace on Earth.
Good will to men.
When the hell's that start?
Right around Christmas time, right around the holiday shopping time, which boy, this season, wow, this is the season to be not so jolly.
Really bad.
Really, really bad.
Attorney General McKasey gets well after Bush call.
He gets a get well call from Bush after he like passed out right on the floor.
How come they haven't shown that again a few times?
Attorney General Michael McKasey was conscious and alerted early today and took a get well call from L president.
They Bush just hours after he collapsed during a speech to a black tie there.
He opened his speech on terrorism with a rye remark about expecting the mood of the conservative federalist society dinner to be somber or sober.
He slumped over the podium about 50 minutes later and could be seen swaying and shaking slightly just before he collapsed.
Oh, no.
People in the audience cried out as he fell.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
How do you like that?
Mm-hmm.
But the attorney general is conscious, conversant and alert.
They said after McKasey was hospitalized, his vital statistics are strong.
He's in good spirits, but that's more we can say for L president.
They he's conscious and alert.
Boy, what a concept that is.
And for all you Bible thumbers out there, this one really kind of makes you, I don't know, makes you scratch your head a little bit.
Discratching it all the time.
My throat is still scratchy too.
Here's George.
Hey, right here at 12.45 today, we got the UN basketball right in the middle of the daytime, a real ratings booster if we ever had one.
UN basketball against Southern Missley, paradise jam at 12.45 followed by the big O till four o'clock and then mad dog and at bruise room, Margate.
Dolphin tonight, 708 and then the 808 to 11 and Greg Lykins 11 tonight to one in the morning Greg Lykins.
It must be grooming him for mid days.
Is he boyfriend of clearance to know he's one of roses boys.
Oh, he's one of Joe's boys.
Oh, he's the guy like Alex Marvez and and her jerk, jerk, jerk street.
Well, not quite there.
He's a he's the board up for Joe.
No.
So in other words, Joe is pushing him.
We got some more names to put on the pole.
Good ones too.
Oh, there he goes.
There goes.
McKasey.
There is the difficulty with speech.
Are you worried about lack of blood flow to the speech areas of the brain?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
We got three more to add to the screw in.
Okay.
You putting these on there?
Yeah, we are.
Yeah.
Dan La Bastard.
I might have to change my vote.
I do like Dan La Bastard.
And I can't say this one.
Alex P.
Picania.
Okay.
You know the word that goes in there.
I had two people remind me of that one.
Oh, here's another one for the poll.
How about Louisville Chris Moron and Miss Fudge?
No, I don't like any of those.
Sorry.
Sorry, Mar part.
Oh, here's the fake Tom Jicca.
What is this?
Fubba to love Spongebob.
Yeah, we know about that.
Reports are serious.
It's been talking to Neil's agent, Norma Kent about buying out his contract with QM.
Neil denies these reports.
Right.
Oh, Mr. Ego is good for old Steve Arino.
Mr. Ego, the Humper is already on there.
Alice Rantell is good.
Rick and Spud is good.
Jimmy Johnson.
And then it says Ricky Tiki Shaw or Ricky Tiki Sanchez.
Yeah.
How do we do that?
Both.
Oliver Nolando, thanks Oliver.
And he's also got Mayor Pinkis Picania.
You want to put him both on there, Ricky Tiki Shaw and Ricky Tiki Sanchez.
Who by the way, his hyperventilating on CNN is criminal.
The fact that they got him in the daytime on there right in the middle of the day when people are awake.
At three o'clock.
I think he's going to come flat out of that chair one of these times.
Just talk about overacting my god Ricky Sanchez.
Are you a crazy person or what?
Uh-huh.
Wow.
Let's see.
I'll throw a driver.
Oh, I wrote windbag.
Boy, we got a whole lot of money here.
I told you this is a good poll.
Yeah.
And we haven't even scratched the surface yet.
We're just scratching it.
I wrote windbag.

Mr there breaking all age he or she tells people
a happy memory when we selected a match to play,
and his confusion for example,
we put on his nostril from the bird,
but she said his Cayvals of children
don't want to talkηt longoung.
He said my Cayvals of children
don't want to talk TA He said my Cayvals of children
of us may be see this morning. A real torque, a real quizzling, if ever there was one.
Swilarie and Adam Kuchikuchi, I was starting to say Ashton, whatever his name is. I'm
not really sure about him. I would like to find out though. Oh, the fake Phil Henry says,
not on our football Friday on QM when you mind if Brad the booger revived the beloved Buffalo
Bill's report would be a hoot. P.S. Howe says, hi, yeah, give Howe a big kiss on the
nose. Okay, it's a big. Oh, here's Mason Williams again. What is it with you and Syrias?
Sure, they're sinking, but Stern is not to blame. Well, whatever does it make use to blame?
They're sinking. And the fact that he's taken 80 trillion dollars out of there.
Mel Carmeson's taken 10 trillion. That's your aid helping the bottom line, Mason.
Had they never signed Stern, they would have gone bankrupt long ago. I still don't understand
why you and your crew hate Stern, I don't like it. That's all. I don't like vanilla ice cream
plain either. Okay, I don't. Did it ever dawn on you fake Mason that there are people who don't like
what you like? God knows my choir. Most entertaining video show ever. Stern's antics are so
entertaining that you completely forgot the fact that you're stuck in a traffic. You could learn
from this. Tell your producer George to call Bob a boo and get some tips from him. You'll be number one
in a row. Yeah, now really need to and then he'll be ready to start walking out of
the woods. Nas get out of my face. All you howard. You know, if you like, Howard, great.
Spend the money. Listen, get a few yucks. All the way. I don't know about what, but you know,
guys taking a crap in the studio. If I want to hear somebody taking a crap, I'll go take one
myself and believe me. It doesn't cost me any money to hear it except the toilet,
toilet paper. Now we got all these names on here. We got a lot of names on there. I sure hope
they all get a lot of votes. Dan La Bastard, Yaldi, Scurran, Alex, Pini, Pacania. I can't say that.
Can't say it. Mr. Rico, I wrote windbag. Now let me ask you something,
Fat Chris. What's up? Since you're our contact to the sports parts, what we only got two hours
names to go, George. Oh, 45 or out of here. You and basketball. Wow. Real ratings booster if
there ever was one. It's the you and it's the canes. It's the canes. They played a girl's team last
time. Actually, Georgia's taking all that good, you know. They're okay. Yeah, they're okay.
And of course, the fact that you have a final score of 41 to 23 is no way indicative of that.
I don't know what that was because at one point it was 27 to three and then late in the third quarter,
early fourth, it was 41 to 10. And then Georgia, take got, you know, they got down to the one-yard line.
They just they just went through the motions last part. They don't want to run it up.
Now what was they just about to say something very important and then you got me side-tracked
with that canes craft? You're about to ask me something about the station. That was?
It was after reading a iron windbag. Oh, yeah. So what happened with him? Where has he vanished?
He's still writing for the Sun Central. It's hard to talk about that. He used to be on every show on this station five times a day.
I don't know. Maybe they got him corralled across the street. Wouldn't that be a kick in our teeth?
Wouldn't that be like a suicidal act on their part to steal iron windbag from us?
They should wish we had him on 20 times a day with that gildy-ish voice of his.
Sounds like a fruitcake. See, one thing about me, I'm the resident station
fairy but at least I don't sound like one. We got some heteroes with babies, you know,
with little kids and they sound like uh, babies with little kids. A little queer.
And they sound like fairies with kids. And we're Halle-Fairy? Oh, yeah.
Moe Howard David, by the way, has moved into first place, he clipsing Jimmy Cifilus's lead
that now is up 67 points. Oh, it's reversing of the trend. Means nothing.
For that industrial average, 76, 15, point 29 and you should hear them all screaming at each other.
They're on a gambling channel around 430 yesterday afternoon, 5 o'clock.
They're all screaming and that Rick Santelli on the bond market.
Have you ever seen him on there? And he's flaving as he looks like rush, waving his arms and
flaving and screaming and all the noise in the bedlam in the background and you're thinking to yourself,
this is the way money is uh, this is the way money changes hands with all these lunatic screaming
and jumping up and down like they're all heavy-duty drugs. Wow. Maybe they used to be. I don't
think they can afford the drugs anymore on Wall Street. Can I? And whatever happened to Ted
David, I think they found out he was Jewish. They bounced his ass off of there. He's on some other
place. Then he, I don't know, Ted David never trusted guy with two first names. I always told you that.
Or if the guy's first name is Moktumbo. What's that guy we were talking about the other day?
That basketball player or football player. Football player, um, Leotus. Who was it Leotus?
Leotus and Le Vernius. Coles. Yeah. I don't know Le Vernius. And then again, how many uh,
chakweels do you know either when you come right down to that? When I went to school, there was no
shack and I was like, oh, I don't do a good spot. Now, sure, I can't afford to let this one go. I'll
tell you that. Oh, thank God for Bob Eisenberg. I never thought I'd live to say that.
He hated me like poison when we first started on the station. I'm not really sure I know why.
Maybe he figured out I was just an a-hole. I think you ripped him or something and died. Oh,
jeez. Yeah. Bob, it took him 11 years to finally kiss and make up. He showed up at Gulfstream
though that day. Yep. It was pretty pasty to me. And he brought the carrots for the horses. Remember
that? No, that was PD Lennie. Now, PD Lennie talked him into bringing him. Okay. He told him
everybody had to bring carrots for the horses because PD is a regular clown, a real clown. Oh, yeah.
He's funny. Just look at him.
Guys and gals. I'm Alaska Governor Sarah Pielan. When I'm not shooting caribou from a helicopter
hovering 50 feet off the ground, I'm a 44-year-old wife, mother and future grandmother of an illegitimate
child conceived out of wedlock. But I'm also an endorser. And I'm here today to tell you
folks about an exciting new perfume for you gals out there. It's called Pianocostal perfume.
Named after the religious practice, I no longer associate myself with due to its
controversial nature. Pianocostal perfume will make you smell divine. And make you speak in
a run. It's perfect for all occasions, whether you're hunting or running or taking a
field trip to the nuclear plant. Gosh darn it. This is a fragrance for all your gals.
Other perfumes just pale in comparison. I'm Sarah Pielan and I approve this fragrance.
Raaah! Raaah! Raaah! Raaah! Raaah! Raaah! Raaah! Raaah! Raaah! Raaah!

I got from Brandon the most grotesque thing I have ever seen in my life. Even worse than that,
lemon, uh, lemon, uh, lemon, uh, lemon, jello. Yeah. John Lamello, lemon jello.
First it says, did you see the video I sent? I don't recall, Brandon. I don't think so.
Secondly, here's Prince William with his willy out in the open. He's taken leak against the fence
out there and somebody got a snapshot of it. And this is from some publication called Solo in Nueva.
Leave it to your people, man, to come up with something pornographic. Uh-oh. And,
oh, it is the ugliest we we I have ever seen in my life. And of course, Famosed.
Ew. Well, I would say almost Famosed. It is the most Famosed. It's just gross.
I mean, he looks sad, I don't know. From a distance, he don't look too bad, especially for
that family, you know, since they all look like a bunch of retards with Buck teeth. He's got the
Buck teeth too. Prince William. Here is his we we. Oh, and then the insert here, they've got
first they got the regular picture and then they've got a close up. Oh boy. In the insert.
And the closer you look at it, the more grotesque it is. That's one nasty looking penis. I'll tell you that.
Oh, Prince William, I'm tempted to put that on our website. Should we? No. Why not?
Why not? I don't know. Are you starting to get like, Joyce?
The greatest line I have ever heard in my life, bar none. Nothing even comes close.
Was a day it was years ago. I was down there. So it's obviously a few years ago. And Clarence
in the studio giving giving us a mini lecture about what we can say, what we can do. And his line was
Joyce has a real problem with penis and vagina. As if we didn't already know that.
When at a good line? It was great. Lid. Joyce has a real problem. The dows up 80 points. Let's have
Art de Ramos grave. We had 160 votes on the new poll and not too shabby. The dows up 75, 74.
It's bouncing around. I love when they say we're testing the new lows. And then yesterday they
were talking at the end of the day about, well, we've reached capitulation again. Yeah, they said
that two weeks ago. It goes down another thousand points and all right. Oh, well, this is capitulation.
If we've ever seen it and then the next day it takes another dump. Compitulate my ass. Okay.
All these morons screaming and yelling at him like this is some kind of science. You know, we're
testing the lows as if it's like an orchestra. You know, working all together. And it probably is.
Oh, you hear the sirens? No, you hear it? Yeah, they're taking Maria's bags away to the hospital
to see if they can fix it. 160 votes on the poll. What's your favorite need to register?
It's a nickname. What are sure a lot of them? I didn't realize how creative I used to be.
Kill Joe Bell came to town two and a half years ago and he sliced it off. What at Prince William,
man, that is, oh, if that's the Royal penis, good God. That is nasty. You want to see it? No, thank you.
I mean, of course, it's from a distance, you know, it could probably be airbrushed. They're nasty
looking at their best. Who's that? The Royal? P9. Oh, P, we need, we need, well, I don't know,
I've seen some attractive ones. All you, baby. So I got the Irohenderman info. Yeah, I do too. He's not
with Mad Dog. Yep. And he does also he's on after games with, ah, ah, with the, oh, my God.
These people never, ever learn. Okay. No matter how much they let these goofballs in these,
these flunky sports writers to destroy. Remember the Kenyan blow morning show? Alex Marvay is Iroh
Winbag, Ethan Skolnik, Manasha Skolnik. How do the ball movements smell? Oh, my God. And
when we got a question, what and whatever that's breaking news, he also calls them. Oh,
breaking news like as a hang nail. Uh-huh. And he don't even play there anymore. By the way,
the Raptors beat the, he twice in a couple days. Didn't they? Yep. I'll be damned. Not the Raptors.
They suck. Not as bad as the Leafs suck. At least really suck. They stink. They blow.
Oh, there's Scotty Bowman. Yeah, let's just sign him up. Okay. He's only 200 years old.
They actually tried to get him on board here a year or two ago. And he said, no, I'm too old.
Am I even older than that old Neil? In Tyler, Anderson and Nika Keprasov.
Tiger Ian Colorado boy, if that isn't an attractive matchup, I don't know what is. And
this should happen to me to play next week. It's Jacksonville. Stealers in the bank. What do they,
they play each other like every couple days? Uh, we had to get to this point with the punishment.
One at game. That'll be the dealers. What was the final score? Oh, 27, 13, 27, 10, something like that.
Yeah, figures real crap. The Bengal suck. And the full card right here on HR TV. Hopefully we
can get some winning wagers at Woodbuying. That's a good alliteration throw for you. And how about
Jeff Seagull's best bet of the weekend? Now for one in there too. We come back. Oh, Justin Stein
walked back to back races a couple days ago to Woodbuying. Little Justin. Hey, Justin, see what you got.
I guarantee whatever Justin's got. It's a lot prettier than Prince William. Oh my god.
Whoo, that thing needs to be sliced off. Can you, can you imagine Prince Charles,
what he's dragging around? Good God. Oh, and especially think about those ears. Okay.
Why would be surprised if if his thing is got an extra ear on it? Why should have called
it sick today? What's your favorite neurologist created nickname? That's our pull. I might still.
Hey, listen. I'm not the one that found that picture that was getting sick. And okay. That was
Prince William taking a leak against the wire fence. Too bad. It wasn't like one of those
electrified fences, you know? Moe Howard David. The, the, the, the, 33 votes and Jimmy Sifilis 22.
They seem to be their contenders. Jimmy's syphilatic. Syphilitic. Fan ash. Johnny Joel Bell 14.
just in Tinkerbell 14, same guy.
The brainstem, 13.
The Humper.
12.
The backdoor boy, 7.
Jurgjurg Street 7.
He's also killing the station.
Jurgjurg Street and Drew Rosenstein.
But that's Clarence's Modus operandus, man.
Bring the same tired people who have nothing to say on over and over and over.
Just use them like a battering ram to drive the audience away.
And it works really well, too, by the way.
And as you go, Clarence, now he's probably aware of that game is being played.
Correct.
Is that why Flea is running the station now?
No, Alex is running the station.
Well, Flea is the one sending me all these damn emails.
That's because he loves you.
Yesterday I must have got 100 emails from him.
Oh, gee, I hope you feel better and the neocold and sick and yaddy, yaddy, yaddy.
Will you do this and will you do that?
He's annoying.
Jurgjurg Street 7, Tony Cigarette 05.
Alex of Pepecania 4.
I can't say that.
Alex Pepecania.

He'll move up.

And they hated each other too at the end there, didn't they?
By the way.
Ron, your side, Ron Hershey Highway.
No.
We're not?
I'm not.
No.
Not after that performance on the QM Rikken crew.
That was...
Caesar Odeus 1.
Xavier Seuer's 1.
I don't even remember saying that.
No.
And not yet for Kimba Bokepper, Tom Don't Like Us.
Ricky Tiki Sanchez.
Ricky Tiki Shaw.
Rick and Spud.
Mr. Igor Jimmie Johnson.
Boy.
I'd rather see Jimmie Johnson.
And I don't want to see it at all than that thing Brandon sent me.
Brandon, that was how waschus as they say in Manchester UK.
That was how waschus.
Speaking of...
I started...
I mentioned this like 45 minutes ago and I interrupted myself with something really important
like the schedule.
Massive frozen water reservoirs discovered on Mars.
Oh my God.
Oh yeah.
And you know where there's water, there is life, there's little things swimming around.
Maybe there's amoebas.
Amoebi.
Right?
Yep.
There's light.
There's light.
And then the underground reservoirs of frozen water on Mars away from its polar caps and
later sign that life might be sustainable on the red planet.
Communists are Communists and that's why they call it the red planet.
Ground penetrating radar used by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveals numerous huge glaciers
up to a half mile thick, very beneath layers of rock and debris.
Researchers said one glacier is three times the size of Los Angeles and area.
Wow.
Heavy duty.
All together these glaciers almost certainly represent the largest reservoir of water ice on Mars
that's not in the polar caps that John Holt, whoever the hell he is, it says but I don't want to read it.
In addition to their scientific value, they could be a source of water to support future exploration on Mars.
Scientists on the 12 member research teams surmise that the frozen water deposits are remnants of a Martian ice age
millions of years ago, millions of years ago, not 5,000 years ago.
Of course the earth wasn't here 5,000 years ago.
God was bored.
He was taken a nap.
And then he said, oh, here's about a being, about a boom.
Here's the earth.
And here's the Adam and Eve.
And here's the fruit on the tree and the pear on the ground.
And but a beep bit of boof Rodney says after eight years, we're finally emerging from the woods.
So while the drama behind the Hillary appointment, I wouldn't have voted for the bitch for presidents as Rodney.
Nor did I want to res meep, but a secretary of state, quite frankly, who cares?
She works at the pleasure of the president, not the other way around.
The thing.
Cut out to.
I mean, I think we need to sweep.
I mean, not that the Clinton eight years were bad, especially converted last eight nightmare years, but I think it's time to get the big brew mug.
You know, sweep the bushes and the Clintons away.
But who do I want to.
Mr. Radio says never mind going to serious.
That ship is about to sink.
Why do you think Bubba loves bunches coming back to to testicle radio?
At a boy, Mr. Radio, I know we could count on you.
God, you're coming in.
The best talent.
You don't give no rejects.
Sport Radio 560 QAM.
Think.
Fourth leaf.
The biggest names.
The best talent.
You're listening to sports Radio 560 WQAM.
My, my, my Emmy.
Fourth Latter-day.
This is the Neorodger shop.
This is your brain.
This is your brain.
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
Any questions?
Don't get in that Mercedes.
Princess, I work begging please.
Paparazzi's coming after you.
You're gonna crash into a wall.
No rich guys for you.
Princess, I work begging please.
Oh, Princess, I work begging please.
Princess, I work begging please.
She's really going.
Way to do a tunnel.
Hello, wall.
I'm dying out of here.
Loving a one.
Yeah, Brandon, I saw that video.
It was Jesse Agre running around the studio.
And did you see that YouTube thing?
No.
The Q-tube?
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's a couple of them on there.
Well, tragic.
Oh, Jesse says you forgot the untalented Anderson Pooper.
Oh, yes.
And the incoherent Barney Fag.
Got those?
Yeah, although I sure, I think.
I'm sure I didn't invent Barney Fag.
Dick Arming get the credit for that one.
No.
I was saying Barney Fag long before Dick ever made that slip.
Although he looks cute and it though, I'll say that.
Wonder what ever happened to him.
All of a sudden he became like a kind of like a by with Bob Bar.
Oh, the Dow's down 12 points.
What happened?
I thought it was a buying opportunity.
Oh, that's even more of a buying opportunity now.
Says Maria.
With those nasty big gross bags under her eyes and her nasty skinny little
skanky body.
Maria rhymes with diarrhea.
191 votes on the pool.
They're not too bad.
You might think we actually have what?
What were those last two?
Because someone called last to what?
Anderson Pooper.
Okay.
Anderson Pooper and Barney Fag.
Thank you.
Got it.
Can you handle it?
Yeah, I think so.
Can you handle Anderson's Pooper?
No, thank you.
Well, that picture, that picture of Prince William,
just sent me back.
I'm never going to be the same again.
I mean, I never really thought he was all that great.
But again, everything's relative.
And when you look at his relatives, believe me,
he's pretty decent.
But God, with a thing like that,
my God, now I know where they got that expression junk from.
Slice that baby up, clean it up, man.
God.
What self-respecting human female or male would allow that thing to get anywhere near it, including him?
God.
Jim DeFetus, the fake Jim DeFetus says,
welcome back to you.
I tuned in yesterday.
He heard George by mistake.
Nothing personal, but he is really bad on the ear.
I don't think we even put him on the light bulb.
Does he get stoned on the ear?
Did he hear Don Bailey Jr.'s embarrassing call to Joe Rose this morning?
No.
What a homer.
Just let you know I've lost about 50 pounds, but still fat and ugly.
I guess you can relate.
Yeah.
Only I have lost the next 50 pounds.
I'm sure you know, most everyone in the industry listens to you, sure.
Religiously, we are chronic.
Cheers, Jim DeFetus.
Maybe it's the real Jim DeFetus.
No.
Is he actually on the ear again somewhere?
I mean, that's on the light bulb.
But that was an old news release from back in January.
He's on Channel 4, I was just told.
He's on Channel 4?
Well, there are a lot of those widescreen TVs being sold, man.
And what do they call them now?
I give up.
No, seriously.
They used to be a big screen TV, and now it's like widescreen.
I don't know.
They have some stupid name for all of you.
I see.
Big screens.
Like big screen, you know.
Since he's been mentioned on your show plenty lately,
how about Howard Spurm for the Poles is one of our chronic's?
Howard Spurm, you want to put Howard on it?
Sure.
Howard had guys taking a crap in the studio the other day.
Oh, my God.
What's wrong with you?
Don't you want to pay to your guys taking a crap?
A.
It's how it.
Yeah, why'd you stop it?
Oh, just for fun.
What a bastard.
What a bastard you are.
You are no wonder your whole family hates you like Poisonous,
which is you would die.
That's the word I'm hearing.
A.
From the fake TV.
How it's spam.
Yeah, from the fake TV.
Here's one from Rob and Lauderdale who's beyond chronic.
He says, I'm going to take a crap.
I'll tape it and send it to you so you can play it on the air.
At a boy, Rob, get the microphone in there real close to your...
Correct him.
...into the water too.
So we can hear splish splash.
I'm taking a bath.
Bobby Daring can do a little accompaniment to it.
A little splish splash.
Guys, taking a crap on the air.
Wow, that is so freaking creative and so dynamically funny.
I'd pay a million dollars just to hear that.
That was down 85.
Oh, it's only 11 o'clock in the morning.
Don't tell me we're going to go into a big slide now.
Oh, no.
Not just as I'm on my way to Woodbine at 12.45.
Wouldn't that be bad?
Let's take a look at that serious stuff.
It was down to 15 cents.
I hear a lot of little while ago.
How come it's not coming up?
Oh, there it is.
Sirius XM radio.
Oh, the TSX is down 60 points too.
Boy, things are looking really bad.
Really bad.
Oh, Sirius is hanging right in there.
15 cents.
15 cents a share.
When you're like to have gobbled some of that up at about two bucks.
Yeah.
Oil is down to 48.5.
$48.52 of barrel.
Roll out the barrel.
Wow.
The world is coming to an end as we knew it.
And that what Michael Moore said.
I got the Canadian, the loony is 77.86.
Under 78 cents.
77.
Sounds good to me.
Oh, here's one.
I'm just checking these emails here.
Questions for Neil?
Love the show.
Question.
Just material for the show.
Is the sorry dolphins game sold out yet?
I'm sure it is.
Right, Chris?
I'm sure it is.
What happened to the so-called big O predicting the Keynes wing the M2414?
The big O is full of crap.
At least he's consistent.
He's consistently full of crap.
That's why we got him on twice a day.
Howard plays guys.
Taken to crap.
We got guys on who are full of crap.
In fact, maybe we can put the big O on Howard show.
I guess he's not so good after all.
Keep up the good works as Mario.
Now he's not so good.
He is what he is.
Let's say you're missing a couple of names to my personal favorites.
Mary Crazy.
As.
Was that I thought I was Mary Greasy.
That's what it was.
Mary Greasy.
What that was her name?
Maris Lacey's.
Oh, Maris Lacey's.
That's right.
You didn't have to go far with that one.
Mary Greasy.
As what?
You didn't have to reach far for that one.
No.
And Sid Rosencrant Stan Berg.
Add them to the pool and the one on the website too.
How can those idiots take you off the air for you and basketball?
Give them a raspberry.
Like you say, you can't spell scum without you.
Well, their football game was so good last night that you're always 124 by the way.
Anybody playing on traveling to Europe?
It's a real bargain.
I compared to 148.
Still a joke.
You're the greatest Neil Howard couldn't carry your arm.
Keep up the great works as Mario.
Your good is your friend.
Here's one about Dick Armin.
He's always on the gambling channel screaming right wing propaganda.
Says Mike.
Thanks Mike.
I'll be sure and avoid that thing.
And Maris on there too with those heavy bags and her skanky nasty armpits.
That was down 95 points.
It looked like another bad day.
How low can it go man?
How low can it go maybe.
Oh, oh point.
Oh, oh.
Kind of like the numbers across the street in this last trend.
Boy, they had a bad trend.

Me too but seeing some hot looking guys a thing I mean if it's real close and personal and you know that's a different story like John's offering.
I hope you know Matt castle throws for six hundred yards ten touchdowns on Sunday all these a holes down here kill themselves in my commute to work on Monday will take 20 minutes instead of an hour and a half.
Hope you're feeling better which I am have a great weekend and a quick message for George Pezzuela now take a shot.

Oh, I like those short weeks.
I guess I'm going to call in signal.
We only got an hour and less than an hour and a half to go.
I'm going to call in signal.

Now, as far as I'm aware of what happen.
I have to call out signal.
I have to resign from this paper.
Very jackass. Yeah. Good guess. Very jackass. I like it. 220
mile votes on that poll. Moe has got 44 and Jimmy Cifilis 29 and the
Humper is moving up 20. Oh, we got a bunch of men double digits.
The brain stem 18 just in Tinkerbell 17 and fat ass Jolly
Joe Bell's got 16. And the emails are just pouring in today.
Wow. Oh, here's Oscar from Strypton, England. I've been
not heard many of the nicknames and such. But when I heard you
read the list just now, the one that made me chuckle out loud was
George Step on top of us. Should scare America be on
list. Sure. What's wrong with that scare? I'm sure. And a boy
asked it's about timing since something worthwhile. By the way,
I missed you show the other day. How were your latest audience
figures? Well, a little chubby, I guess. They were okay. Very
jackass. The fake one says, how it takes Fridays off? He had a
show yesterday. He had Richard Belzer on howard was grilling
him incisively about not showing up for howard's wife's
tyranny event in which bills of Belzer was due to MC.
Belzer was upset and threatened to kick Howard's ass. Then he
broke down and cried on the air and begged Howard to go to
commercial. When Howard came back, he apologized to Belzer and
said he felt like an a hole. Apparently, Belzer revealed a
Howard during the break that he's dying of cancer. This is why
he missed the tyranny of it. He's been dying of cancer since
back when he was with Alex Bennett. Remember that? Just like
in the Godfather too, he's been dying the same heart attack for
20 years, Heiming Roth and the same with Richard Bell. This
whole thing had to be fake stunt. Howard then went into the
long discussion about how he on every and everyone on his
staff are mentally ill. Thanks, Barry. Keep you off the street
anyway. Richard Belzer. Remember, Alex Bennett brought him in.
He was dying of cancer back then. Now, how many years ago was
that like 80 years? Something 90 by 20 years ago? Just like
Heiming Roth, he's been dying of the same illness for 20 years.
We're all dying of the same illness. You know what it is? Life
that's it. Don't know if you're aware of this as Madeline, but
there's a clip on YouTube from Larry King's radio days in the
clip, a Tired Larry King spaces out as he tries to give it
advice to one of his listeners, please play it if you have it
available. And at the Larry Wigs out, we got that play to the
million times long before I'd ever got on YouTube long before
Mark S says, Oh, yeah, whenever he referred to Iliana Ross
Layton as Iliana Rosanna Dana, Lately, I'd damn near drive off
the road or if I'm at my desk, follow up on my chair. That's
easily my favorite nickname, which you've come up with. Iliana
Rosanna Dana. Got it. Got it. God, I never realized how
freaking creative I am. Or used to be anyway. Yeah, might have
been able to make a living at this one day. I doubt that.
Jew Lieberman. Oh my God, the ballless Democratic party. And
that wasn't bad enough. That was bad. That was horrendous. But
family were sucking up the Ted Stevens there in the Senate
yesterday. And Harry Stevens was going on and on. And there was
Bobby Bird in the back wiping the tears away from his eye. Oh my
God, I thought I was going to upchuck. That was pathetic. It's
a fraternity. It's not government. It's a fraternity. It's a
club. It's a club birds of a feather hang out in the club
together. And like you said, I bet you there's like a secret
handshake that goes on there must be. And it's the one with it
where they, you know, tickle the palm with finger after the
one. Here's one that says nothing against George. He's a
smart little man. But it's a huge disappointment not to your
force at 10 a.m. Welcome back, my friend. My friends, my
friend. My friend, I'm your friend. He doesn't like you.
Oh, well, you're a smart little man. He must know me. He knows
you're smart little man. Oh, by the way, George has got his
thing tomorrow. I almost forgot about it. I almost did too.
Tomorrow, November 22, Saturday, 3 to 5 p.m. at Metro PCS, 282
Northeast 8th Street, no homestead, a chance to win the
ultimate college football championship game experience and
chance to go see George and shake his little thing. The
ultimate experience includes four tickets to the game on
January 8th at Dolphin Stadium, four pregame field passes and
four fan fest and tailgate party tickets. They'll call you
when the party starts. So, Rosie, George, 3 to 5 tomorrow at
homestead, 282 Northeast 8th Street at Metro PCS. I'm sure he'll
be happy to see, especially the guy with the eyes, the guy with
the fanny pad. Come on down. Please, the best talent. You're
not as friendly lost or job. I'll have you place in a
place on the new administration. What the last eight years
gave us hyperinflation. Is it you?
The pace of seats should be in the past.
With all the repovertoos in your ass.
All your bruised and cracked and concepted
brake does. Here's a fair life test. That's a great
vacation.
U.S.A. is a detonation.
And now, everybody's hyperinflation.
Okay, 1131 at 560 WQM. Something we forgot to mention in
recent minutes. You know what that is? What's that?
Harricite.
Oh, yeah. If you enjoyed that football game last night,
wait till you and basketball against other miss from the
Paradise Jam at 1245. Only an hour and 14 minutes away.
But not that I'm counting.
Yeah.
Another exciting meeting exciting.
This is a great day, man. The sun is shining. It's colder and
hell, but what do I care?
See my taxi guy. He pulls up right out in the front and I
like bundle up. You know, and I run into the cab and he's got
the heat blasting. And then he takes me right up to the door as
close as you can get a woodbine. You know, and I scurry. I
waddle on in there and then it's a nice and toasty in there.
So I don't have to freeze my ass off.
And that nice. It is freezing, man. It's cold. It's cold.
It's cold. Not that I'm complaining. That was up 58 points.
It made it turn the corner. All right. Let's have a big day
today. Let's go off six, 700 points on the down. Make people
feel a little bit better before the crash. I mean, it's minus
seven. Crude oil falls to 48 and a half bucks. Oh, no. That's
pretty crude. You know, just like this show used to be back when
we had an audience, we used to be really crude. We can't be
that anymore. So maybe we'll just go in the plate play recording
as a guy's taking a crap on the air. I mean, you know, you could
give me almost anything. And I'm sure that Howard is a hell of
lot more creative stuff than that. And then this is the best he
could come up with a schmuck to fake Mason Williams with his
passable gas. My God. Oh, it was great. They had a bunch of guys
sitting around taking a real. You can't even play fart sound.
The glue is 77 480. Oh, keep going down 62. That would be
a. Oh, my God. That would be sensational. I could afford to buy
some Cuban Stogies. Ooh, too bad I can't smoke Stogies anymore.
They just tear up my throat. Now, see, that proves that there's
no God. All the things that you really like, the things that
you love the most. Yeah, bad for you. Right. That's all by
design. What do you mean by that? Is that part of points by
denying yourself all these? Well, true that who wants denial,
man, we're here for just like Sonny from the market said, we're
not here for a long time, just a good time. Right. He sure knew
what he was talking about, but he lost his ass. He reminds me of
the guy from owning my honey. Without the gambling thing, you
know, just he expanded that market just at the time when that
neighborhood was reaching a rock bottom. Nothing had had very
far to go, but right. And Sonny's put all his life savings
there, expanded the market and there was nobody wanted to go
anywhere near that hood. Oh, my God, even us, even one way
drove. Yeah, we did. We did want to. That's right.
Especially when you pass channel seven, just before you turn
to the ID parking lot. Oh, God. Knowing that spielkeys in a ray
one day would be infecting that building. And don't forget the
paperboy, Craig Stevens. Why isn't he on there? Or is he?
What? The paper boy? No, that's not a nickname. I mean, it is
how is it? No, that's not the kind of thing we're talking about.
All right, we're talking to play about a play on names. I okay,
you don't even understand the poll. Of course, I do. It's a
nickname. Yeah. A play on the name. That's not what the
question says. Oh, Larry King says you have the clip from W. I
would do when I called Phil Henry, the defend coach Don Shula,
no, we don't. Phil put Bob Green on the phone to start crying
on here. Whatever happened to Bob Green, he's got a lot of money.
It's got a lot of money in Georgia was supposed to call me
and never did. He probably did. I did call him. Remember, I left
the message. You never heard the call. Correct. Well, fair
with her friend. I'm still your friend. You know, by the way,
don't come in on Monday. Don't come in on Tuesday. Remember that?
Yep. That was about Steve Nicholon. Those damn rejoins or something
like that.
Why when when we never going to work at a station, it's got like a
real program director. I don't know. I mean, we're always talking
about general managers, which it isn't easy to find one that knows
their ass. Oh, the phone's ringing. I'll be back. Are you kidding
me? Oh, good thing I got right back in here, then. Yeah, it is a
good thing. Got a level when there's no other people here. So I
do. Listen, I thought it was just us. No. We got to get out of
here early. Apparently, people didn't show up for work.
Normally on a Friday, they just go to lunch and don't come back.
They didn't even wait for that. They went on their coffee break.
Well, I guess I figured you know, 12, 45, so it's, you know, holiday.
So they just went for that.
Did we mention I was talking to Neil about that macaroni cheese at
Jake's? I just want to mention that again while we have a chance.
It's really good stuff.
Anybody try to go this weekend? And I'm still on them still
vibrating from Prince, or at the Pat Collins. Thank you for that,
by the way. No problem. Listeners. I can't take it.
I'm going to unplug that phone up there. I'm going to go up there
to America. My S. Well, we are having our customers with the proactive
solution. But yeah, I got a proactive solution for you. Okay.
Oh my God. Anyway, let's get back. What were you just saying to
well, that guy? Huh? Nothing? Huh? Talking behind your back.
With all due respect to fat ass jolly, Joseph, this guy, long before
Joe Bell made the scene, you penned the fat ass moniker on fat ass rush.
I don't, I don't, I don't see that fat ass rush. Why is that the
clever? It's not. It's not.
Kill pop and fat ass rush. That's even a little bit better, but
we're not putting that on there. We've got 80 million names on there.
If you got something good, great. Jim DeFese is that's one of my
favorites. And boy, in his case, can you imagine the volume?
Our in nine minutes until Hurricanes basket ball. All right. Oh,
hallelujah. Now, let me look at the log and see how we're going to do
this. Since we have no instructions on how we're going to be
going in the, it's just as well. What do you mean? If we did have
instructions, they would probably be wrong. Come on. Where we going?
Reade you in a break. Turkey. What? That's a formative break. So
so 40. And then I can come back to play a little music.
On the rooftop? No. What do you mean on the roof? Oh, up on the roof?
On the rooftop? I can remember what it's called up on the roof by the
crime chains. Oh, I love that. Wonderful.
Look at what's that? The drifters?
Oh, my gosh. Just drifts right into space.
Come on. Anyway. Oh, and what's the other one? It could be
more in love. That's my favorite. There's only two of them.
Anyway, it could be, could be. I bet you I have that too.
What a crime chain. That was a good group. They had two great records.
And that was the end of them. Number we got the story on that Columbia
Records. And of course they were too busy with the circle. A red rubber ball.
Red rubber. And that was a mentally fierce match to circle. That was a good song.
You got it? Yeah, think I do.
Anyway, this is kind of interesting. Very informative for those of you
wondering about the bailout from Mike. How the bailout really works.
I want you to listen carefully. Don't know. Oh, Jesus.
Wow. Red rubber balls. I think that's what Prince William is.
I have a North rubber ball. Oh, my God.
I've been trying to make that for most organs of the day.
Once upon a time, a man appeared in a village and announced the
villagers who would buy monkeys for $10 each. Have you ever heard this?
No. The villagers seeing that there were many monkeys around went out to
the forest and started catching them. This is how the bailout really works.
The man bought thousands of $10 and a supply started to
diminish the villagers' staff their effort. He next announced he would now buy
monkeys at $20 each. This renewed the efforts of the villagers. They
started catching monkeys again soon. The supply diminished even further and
people started going back to their forums. The offer increased to $25 each
and the supply of monkeys became so scarce. It was an effort to even find a
monkey let alone catch it. The man now announced he would buy monkeys at $50 each.
However, since he had to go to the city on some business, his assistant would buy on his behalf.
In the absence of the man, the assistant told the villagers,
look at all these monkeys in the big cage that the man is already collected.
I'll sell them to you at $35 when the man returns from the city.
You can sell them to him for $50 each. The villagers rounded up all their savings,
but all the monkeys for $700 billion. They never saw the man or was the
assistant again only lots and lots of monkeys. Now you have a better understanding of how
the Wall Street bailout plan will work. I just go on, Mike. That's good. I like it.
I think he's got a stuff right now. I was up 58.22.
58 points on the positive over $7,600 man. Now it's marching back toward $14,000.
Anybody buy a net? Anybody believe in it? Except for Maria and her baggy eyes?
God Maria, you look like crap in the bull. You look good.
God, best out. You don't have no right to escape your ass on TV.
Thank you, ma'am. I think sports leader.

Sports Radio 5-60-QAM, the sports leader.
Holy Makinon, this is Joe Boehm, the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs,
and you're listening to the Hockey Authority Neal God.
You've been rough, my dear, to chill that you're raising your diet.
Well, I don't want to show you what a big ass said I was to you.
And how?
You get done, you get quite somebody good enough to fill my baggy pants?
It ain't easy.
Very no chance I'll ever be coming back.
Outside of considering a lucrative and counteract.
If you want to know what it'll save you from shutting that transmitted to ground,
why, that's easy.
Shoot.
What?
All you need is smoke.
Oh!
Don't do anything for me.
All you need is smoke.
What?
What?
All you need is a smoke.
It don't flow.
It doesn't flow.
It doesn't flow.
It's easy.
I think your own dreams last only that you did, Dane.
Dane.
Dane, that my ratings that bottomed out in this chain.
We're back.
What's radio has to worry, Bobby?
No, but the day is never once.
And we did.
Sack.
All you need is smoke.
Now we can't hear you.
All you need is smoke.
It doesn't flow.
All you need is a smoke.
It don't flow.
Why, for now, it's just a baby.
Oh, for now, it's a head that you'll fight away something.
Check, Paul, they didn't give you this.
Where are you going to go, fight me?
Like a kid.
14-dl.noonaQM.
So I googled Richard Belzer.
Because somebody sent me a thing.
Richard Belzer's a liar.
He makes up all these stories.
And it said he survived a particular cancer in 1984.
Well, 84, I was not at IOD yet.
No.
So what was that story he gave us when it came on Alex Bennett's?
He was dying of cancer in 88, 89.
I got better.
And then he got worse.
Rob, who need real Rob?
I'm sure you're OK.
But get some help.
Chronic, beyond chronic.
It's been enough George was on the yesterday.
Now we get Keynes, basketball game.
Are you fricking kidding me?
Like I said, Rob knows his crap.
That's like me quitting a job making 100K to take a job
making 40K.
Yeah, it's like me taking a 50% pay cut.
They love sports, but it doesn't keep the station running.
Idiots.
Oh, they got a wall of football and basketball.
They stuck a basketball into the hole in the wall.
I guess the Keynes left a big hole in that wall of football last night
where they grow test performance at Georgia Tech.
They played some real direct at Georgia Tech.
Let me tell you.
Station management must love losing money.
If I was a sponsor, I'd take my money elsewhere.
They suck.
Have a great day.
Says Rob.
OK, give it a rest.
Rob, have a nice weekend.
Go away.
Here's one from some Schmegma guy.
And then they're all bad.
More names.
The Rimmer.
First of all, I never called him the Rimmer.
I called him the Rimmer.
Rimmer.
Alligator arms Rimmer.
Howard Spurm.
Funny socks.
Stan Miner.
Swirlry and Bubba.
No, no.
I think we got enough on it, don't you?
Oh, no.
Let's double it up.
Now you understand why I hated those pole building.
Pole building.
The Whisperer.
He vanished.
The Whisperer.
Thank God.
And no calls on it.
Board, I just took a look at that monitor.
I usually keep it off.
But today being Friday, and since we have a short show,
less than an hour to go till Keynes basketball, don't turn it off yet.
Please, please don't punish us.
We're not the ones that stuck Josie and Clarence on there.
That's they're doing, especially after last night.
I mean, most people are you would think would if they hear you.
We're right now they'd run in the other direction.
Oh, no, not the Kings.
The Keynes.
Now he's the beast in on that deal to or what?
No, no, he might, I think when they're like local games, he does some stuff.
But I think the beast got married and he cut Clarence off on the weekends.
I think he's a little on the outs now.
Even though of course they're growing him to do midday.
Once we take a walk, once we walk over to Sirius, Sirius stocked by the way.
He'll be pleased to know is hanging right in their 15 cents.
15 cents.
One of I some stock.
Oh, no, thanks.
Super.
I want you to buy some stock.
Maria wants you to buy.
It's a buying every day is a buying opportunity.
Okay, corner Maria who gives me diarrhea.
Oh, there are morning call with Ted David.
It says on the thing there and he hasn't been on there for what two years.
Maybe the people of the gambling channel can't afford to change the thing.
The thing is the thing is with the thing is you know, on the bottom of the screen.
Where you click on the on the cable.
Toronto stock exchange is making a comeback.
It's up almost 100 points and the Dow is up almost on 85 points.
See the one thing with Canada, man, it's monkey C monkey do.
Although here when the price of oil goes in the crapper, the market tanks and the looney tanks.
Thanks a lot.
I'm never going to recover from that picture of Prince William.
Damn you, Brandon.
You send me a lot of good stuff.
But that was that was above and beyond the call of duty.
And then the fake Barry Jack has he sends me the whole look at that oil 48 99 the whole rundown of Howard show minute by minute yesterday every segment and already does this and already says that and already, already, already, already, already, already, you know.
77.80 on that looney get that baby down there to about 40 cent.
Wouldn't that be dynamite? Oh, yeah.
Mike says listen to how it's during an the near Roger show.
Howard didn't have a guy take a crap in the studio.
He did have a woman stiff on of his staff members parts and he accidentally let out something else.
Oh, no.
She put her nose in the guys.
Back them and he's mad.
But just recently there was a guest on who lick the rear of Richard one of his staff members.
This is this kind of thing is why this show, a certain show has fallen.
He no longer puts any energy toward the show and lets his underlings run things.
Nowadays as soon as the show starts, Howard's already talking about how he wants the show to end so he can go to his mansion.
Boy, I can relate to that. You say hello and you're ready to say goodbye.
The sirens are coming to get you how we hear it?
Oh boy.
All this and he's off every Friday plus 10 weeks of vacation a year.
You might mail an in you but at least you show up every day.
Except yesterday when I had the scratchy throw it was sick.
And I still got a little crud.
Could be because it's a hundred below zero here.
No snow though.
The snow we had two days ago.
It's gone.
And once it's gone, it's coming back.
I'm looking on the rooftops.
I'm looking around.
I don't see any of them.
I'll find wood by no it'll still be there because it's out by the airport.
It's like out in the open, you know.
And up north when you got places that are like open fields and stuff and they get the wind and they get a lot more snow.
And it like you know what I mean when a place is open.
Yep.
Right?
Right.
That's what's grand said.
She said when things are wide open 235 votes on this second poll.
Now what would we get on those first three?
Oh.
What's your favorite neo-rodges created nickname?
This is a good poll.
Even though George don't like it.
I like it fine.
I was just chopping your onions.
Yeah.
Sure you were.
Just chopping your nuts.
Maybe that's what Prince William was doing.
Maybe he was going to slice that forskin off on that wire fence.
Well, not have been something.
He could have sliced it right on the ass.
He could have left the real forskin on the fence.
Favorite neo-rodges created nickname.
Mohawar David did did did did did did did.

Remember the time Hank was on a two when he had the Shula in the I guess they were actual is there somewhere they were doing the show outside the studio.
And the it's Shula sitting there with him.
And unbeknownst to me Shula had the headphones on.
I was like about three minutes to two.
And I was saying something about well, Hank is standing by.
He's got the brainstem on there.
Something like that.
I'm sure went to went right through the brainstem.
They weren't too pleased with that.
In fact, they were never too pleased.
The sports, uh,ocracy on this station.
Just like every ten day they'd have one of those stupid press conferences.
They would make sure that they fed it through the board in the studio in the main studio.
And they would shut us off.
So that couldn't play anything in the background, you know.
Remember those days?
I do.
Yeah, it was yesterday.
That's right.
Shut us right off because there's nothing funny about a press conference with Wayne or Jimmy's Johnson or Nick Sabin or like that.
So you want the poll totals?
No.
Okay.
When did I say I wanted that?
Well, you said what were the poll totals of all three polls we had?
What were they?
491 was the bailout.
612 was the one that you added.
Yeah.
And we're now at 277.
Oh, that's eight million votes on the poll on this show.
Who says just because we don't play guys taking a crap on here.
We don't have an audience.

Hey, Tony, you're a silly person.
Everybody knows it.

Whoa, the votes are pouring in on the pool.
Something electric is happening.
And look at all the damn emails.
John Stamos in studio, Stop I To Pro, His New Lifetime Movie.
Oh, and it's got an attachment.
I don't care about Howard Show.
Don't you understand?
Now all of a sudden I've got all these nubniks sending me all these details about Howard Show.
How about Mufflinzi?
It says it was a devastatingly funny and accurate nickname.
I always love that one.
Mufflinzi.
Get it on there.
Got it?
Got it.
How is she doing, by the way?
Fine.
Sean says, what's up with all the baby Spanish on the station?
Sounds like all the sponsor PSAs are read by Pre-Pubescent, Westchester Punk,
Spanish Baby Talk.
That's a big O. He'll be on after the basketball game, by the way.
Here's one from the fake Tom Jicke.
George said on the air that 93 Rock is owned by a cheap channel, incorrect or owned by Cox Disney.
We know that.
We know it.
Old news.
We corrected it yesterday.
Nine and nine.
You made a mistake.
Oh, I know.
You made a mistake.
I'm here to you.
I'm going to make more.
Here's human events back again.
Blocked.
How come it didn't block the first time?
You know what I mean?
Human events, my ass.
And of course, you know our close personal friend now writes for some human events.
The biggest name.
Got to do something.
You're a new Roger.
Fort radio.
Sixty Q.A.M.
The fourth leader.
The biggest names.
The best talent.
You're listening to sports radio.
Five sixties WQ.A.M.
My M.A.F.
For a lot of days.
This is pretty quick.
Whenever I shape my balls, I listen to the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour.
Oh!
All right.
Don't, don't, don't, don't.
Eight sounds that you hate.
But I'm an idiot.
And I think they're really great.
I doubt that you can't handle one or two.
Much less or eight.
Eight sounds that you hate.
But men from the boys, they will surely separate.
I tell you what they are.
Guaranteed you'll go, yeah!
I like fingernails on a blackboard.
When people crack their neck for their knuckles.
When I rough style, we'll fall together.
That just makes me just...
Eight sounds you can't stand.
But you could tolerate if you were a handsome man.
And to the list of eight.
A fork and a knife scraping on a plate.
Scraping on a plate.
Scraping on a plate.
Scraping on a plate.
Here's what I really love.
You might want to try it.
Give me feedback in my headphones.
Oh yeah, that's more like it.
Little more, little more over there.
Little more.
Hey, sounds so unique.
Now let's review so you can really, really free.
Figure fingernails on a blackboard.
When people crack their neck for their knuckles.
Rub, it's either fall together.
Cause it makes me chuckle.
I like brand new sneakers on a gym floor.
Raging in a lumen of windows.
When a guest is drilling my mowers.
That makes me say, bingo.
My boy singing on his record.
You dance all on fine china.
If he sounds give you the shivers.
That makes you a whiner.
Hey, you've gone nuts to someone fight their fork like this.
Cause I love it.
Here, I'll do it again.
Do you have a nervous system left?
How about the squeegee wiping a window while I crack my neck?
Sup, where you whips?
Sup for whips?
Oh wait, I got one more.
Yeah, don't forget that one too.
1204-560-WQM.
Quite a fact you sent me.
Boy, Joseph's a little surly today.
A little bit.
Got a surly how facts from Joseph.
We'll get to it in a second.
The now's up 15 points.
There's that bitch Nancy Pelosi.
That they just can't come and say, give us this.
And then maybe that.
Yeah, that's right.
They flew in in their corporate jets.
Not together, by the way, in three separate corporate jets.
And they say, waah, waah.
Give us some money.
But nevertheless, so Joseph says,
thank you, Mr. President, for those low gas prices.
Haven't heard you say that in a long time.
I just said it.
Thank you, Mr. President, and all your Saudi buddies,
all your rag head buddies, how's Bandar Bush doing?
What does the price of oil in the rest of the world have to do with George Bush?
You used to mention the price of gas in Canada.
Is that also involved with George Bush?
Yes.
And his partners in crime.
Yes, absolutely.
In the 2004 presidential election,
George Bush had 62 million plus votes,
and John Kerry had 59 million plus.
Still, you keep referring to that election as fixed.
Popping their votes don't determine the election,
because obviously, Al Gore would have been president in 2000, if they did.
How about the current election?
If this one was this one fixed?
Of course not, because you're a man one.
Yeah, he won in a landslide, intellectual college.
That's how we picked the president, Joseph.
Have somebody teach you about that?
You don't even like black people.
Well, if I don't like black people,
I come out with the first one to tell everybody that Obama was going to be the next president.
And why did nice support swillery when I had the chance?
Because he would have bitches too.
No, that's true. I hate everybody.
If he would have been a Republican,
he would have torn him apart on the radio.
That's right.
In 2000, you said that a vote for George Bush would mean loss of women's rights,
and that didn't happen.
Recently, George said on the air that a McCain wins,
we'd all be receiving government cheese.
You guys are pathetic.
You guys will say anything we give people to vote Democrat.
I said that.
Yeah, government cheese.
You dirty rat.
Let's see what kind of change we're going to get.
Socialist ideas look at on paper, but never working real life.
There are, Joseph, just another quizzling,
another one of those ditto heads.
Socialist.
How about terrorist ideas on paper, huh?
Communistists, communistists, etc.
I told you a long time ago you were losing your audience.
I told you just look at your rating, sign Joseph.
At the handwriting, by the way, looks for me.
That looks like an inside job.
But nevertheless, sorry we got the thanks that you're still listening out there, Joseph.
Okay, he told me a long time ago I was losing my ratings.
Now, I'm losing my mind.
That's because I work for this radio station in Fajali, Jo Bell,
and clearance.
And we got a UN basketball game coming up.
Conflicts of interest here.
There's swallery.
She's going to be Secretary of State.
She's on track for the job right after Thanksgiving.
It's going to be made official.
And why, and why should we get all bent out of shape about that?
At least we'll know where she is, you know.
Tans and me.
Mozambique.
Maybe things centered to Alaska as you can hang out with Sarah.
Mike says, Camberl Martian is a member of the KPRSC local two Houston Texas severe weather team.
Camberl delivers the weekend morning forecasts.
And he's got a link to it.
No, thanks for the link, Mike, but thanks anyway.
So Camberl Martian is in Houston.
Maybe he's with what's his name?
My old friend from the weather, the weather hurricane center.
What's that was his name, Dr.
Dr. Neal.
Dallas.
No, come on.
What's that was his name?
I used to have him as a guest in my show all the time.
Neal.
He was a born again Christian.
He was a good guy except he was always talking about El Niño and LaLos.
Mice does not look like Neinia or Ban.
Neal Frank.
Oh.
Not to be confused with Baba Frank's party Frank's Barney Frank's or Schneider's Frank's.
I do like Nathan's, though.
Is there anybody who doesn't like Nathan's?
You know, the sawgrass, of course, I haven't been in there in a long time just in those two bad restaurants,
which I can ever think of the name of either one of them.
Hmm.
Cheesecake Factory.
Yeah.
And what's the other one that they owned that I've been into two or three times?
I keep given it a chance.
Right.
And what's it called?
See you don't know either. No
Grandlox. Grandlox that said very good fact
Grandlox rhymes with sucks
Good appetizers
crappy
Entrace it's a good concept but the food blows
How can you make a bad burger? You know in a joint like that? You know what I miss?
Dolls yeah, wasn't dolls pretty good?
I've only been there a couple times when they were open because they were that down in candle, but yes
Doll they were everywhere they were for a long day. They were all over the place dolls
And I was joke about the fact they had cheese on everything even the seats had cheese on them
I mean every and of course I'm a cheese lover
Now cheese when you come right down will probably gumms up your your innards when you think I imagine
Don't they say too much cheese is not a good thing because your innards get like coy a climb makes you irregular
Yeah, oh cheese with the cheese that binds
Here's when it says Howard ripped off opening Opian Anthony were the first to put a microphone in the toilet and broadcast it
Oh, how creative I was shot a thought of that
Also, where's the clip you play to the guy saying we're all once feces come from I searched in it couldn't find it
That's because we're the only ones who got it
Lastly, what is the story are you gonna be sick every time the ratings come on? Yeah, I'm gonna be sick the day after the ratings come on
Actually ours weren't they weren't all that bad they weren't great not like the olden days
But they were okay considering yeah considering where we are and what's going on here? Oh, and by the way, it's official
We have it on very very not that we didn't already know
But the official sign is going up on the toad board the sales department when they had their meetings
They don't discuss this show under penalty of death
You can't complain about the effort to sell this show at WQM because there isn't any nice going Joe Bell and your partner from Marali
What's his name the red next sales manager Chris Joe Chris? Oh?
