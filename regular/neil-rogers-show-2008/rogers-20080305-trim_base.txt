You did a lot of things
I did a lot of things
With your hydrogen sports hall radio
W2A-L
Star about the Earth
And, well, the Earth
We don't want you around
So won't you drop that please
Absolutely
You're an old and daughtering
Grantee has been
We should have been a lot of in the loony bin
A brain dead of element
We go to school and wear the same suit
You bought in 1966
Now, yeah, yeah, you're out there
You're up to us all of the Earth
Put the pruning head back up your butt
And choke on a battery on the man on my
To drive your core
There's nothing to a tree
That was my first car I've told you that a thousand times
Have I ever known a million times? Yes, you have
That 1960 Corvair, a little blue Corvair
That it explode
That it explode
Did it blow up?
Well, it did not blow up
And I did have to change a fan belt a couple of times
That was the thing with those Corvairs
So I'm told
Fan belts kept breaking why?
So I'm told?
Yeah, but other than that
I think I put about 150,000 miles in it, little baby
60 Corvair, I'm going to go out and give me another one
Okay
Probably pretty good on my words, wouldn't you think?
I'm out there
Thank you, Mr. President, for those little gas prices
By the way, and for that worthless American dollar
That you could wipe your own ass with
God
So, do your Zack say he's got a 295 now?
Yeah, he's got a 295
I have a contest between Chris and Zack
Yes, we're up to
See who dies last
Chris is leaving earlier day by the way
He might have to because of his root canal
His baby root canal
Oh
You're not speaking, is that it?
Are you jarred, Aiken?
It's a little...
Well, he'll leave early now
You understand what's going to happen to George at two o'clock
He's going to be called in on the carpet again
To explain why
To explain why you had to leave early
Well, maybe Joe doesn't care about him
Yeah, or maybe I'll just walk by that way
And I'll say Joe, I'm going home early
Oh, I wouldn't do that
You'll never make it home
You'll never make it to your baby root canal
Well, I don't know, maybe he should have taken the day off if you're not feeling well
Because you've got to really be on top of your game to be on this show
If you want to mail it in
Yeah, well...
You're the sirens again out there, man
It's snowed and ice and freezing, right?
This is...
It's the fifth of March already for crying out loud
With somebody tell the weather guy, somebody tell what's his name
Faced the ball there on the CTV that they're kind of into
And all of this, Jesus
How about a nice spring day with a sunshine and about 65 degrees?
That would be nice
God
Anyway, that's swallery, man
He just won't go away
You know what? Really bugs the hell out of me
Of course, you know what you got in the Ohio?
Is a bunch of real blue collar and those picking...
Ohio always screws everything up
Yeah
She will never buy ten points
And then in Texas where she'd eat at a three point win
But she lost in the caucuses
It's all screwed up
But nevertheless, in Texas, you got all those Mexicans, you know
And you know what they say about those
No, what do they say?
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton handed it at the possibility of a democratic dream ticket with Senator Barack Obama
Speaking on the early show to the NCBS, swallery said that this may be where it's headed
But we have to decide who's on top of the ticket
We're going to have them together maybe, but we have to figure out who's going to be on top
Clinton said the race between her and Obama arranged incredibly close with just smidgings of difference between them
Right, only he's got about an 85-dug of lead
And she ain't never going to overcome that
Because he's going to win in Wyoming and in North Carolina and in Mississippi
And then of course, Pennsylvania, which is a seven weeks away, even if she wins Pennsylvania, she's still going to be well behind
I got a story about that about how these statistics go
It's almost impossible for her to win on delegates
Almost impossible
So in Sputel last night, it says she won Rhode Island, Ado, Highland, Texas
And she got lawleth in Vermont, Ben and Jerry are probably happy about that
He pasted her by 22 points in Vermont, but she also pasted him in Rhode Island
I don't understand a lot of these states, I don't get it
But nevertheless, I'm sure you stayed up and lost till midnight 12th of October
Oh yeah, you know it
Didn't do it?
No
Why not?
Were you watching vacancy?
I didn't want to, no, it wasn't on
Oh, and what about, what's that all about?
I look for it
I look for it
Reach, reach
Reach for the breach
I don't see anything around here
It ain't on my feet, like you do
It ain't on now, if vacancy is on, but you're going to hear a lot of like that
Oh, and guess what?
Clarence was in there, no, were you there when he came in?
Yes
Oh, so you heard the fact he's not going to be here on Friday?
I did
Because he's got to travel from other sports
It's important things, I don't even know what he's been to
I wonder if there's going to be an inquisition to find out how come Clarence is not going to be around on Friday
He's going to be AWOL
Boy, just amazing to me, the kind of crap that codes on
And you have to get called in on carpet because I'm leaving it on Friday because I'm going on vacation
That's right
You've been doing for a lot of, you've got to say 21 years I've been doing this
It's locker
Too bad
Too bad
Too bad, screw off
If anybody don't like it, screw off
And you welcome again by the way for other vaguid job
Those five hours I did, several days while a little dog was there on jury duty alleged
God
Senator Swolory Rotten Clinton defeated Barack Obama in the Ohio and Texas primary's last day
Ending a string of defeats in when he won Vermont which they called really early
They made a dozen in a row
And letting her to soldier allowing her to soldier on a Democratic presidential nomination race
It seemed like they had named time soon
Swolory also on Rhode Island while Obama won in Vermont
But the results mean that Mrs. Clinton won the two states he most needed to keep her candidacy alive
She's still alive
Wow
In interview this morning on CNN she said she wasn't deterred by Obama's continued reading elected delegate support
Argued that she would need a stronger candidate in a general election against the now assured Republican John McCain insane
What's important is that this campaign has turned a corner she said
They turned the corner
Seeking to minimize the importance of Obama's string of victory
Swolory said a month ago people didn't know who the nominee would be
And said she was prepared to contest McCain on national security issues
Which he said would be the focus of his campaign
That phone is ringing at three o'clock in the morning you know where your kids are
You know who's answering the phone at the White House
You know who's on the floor with Monica Lewinsky I mean all of this stuff you know
So sick and tired of so many stupid people man just buying into that crap
Like what what what what is her claim to fame what is her big thing on national security when it came to the war in Iraq she said oh yeah
Here you go W here's a blank check go ahead and spend all the money and kill all the people you want to have a good time
That's her claim to fame on national security just like her fame to fame on health care that she just blew right down the toilet
On CNN this morning also a bomb appointed out he retains his leading delegates and said he had run strong
The states where he started a big disadvantage we started 20 points behind in Texas in Ohio he said he said he was not able to close completely the gap in those states
But he would continue to seek the democratic nominations as here like as if there was a doubt New York Times what a stupid Adam Nagourney what a moron you are Adam
Jesus New York Times this is a real newspaper once upon a time it was
Swirly's victory in Texas was razor thin and came early this morning after most of us had gone to bed
But by winning the size of the Ohio earlier in the night she was able to deliver a televised victory speech in time for the late night news
And the result there allowed her to cast Tuesday's the beginning of a comeback even though she stood a good chance of gaining no ground against a bomb in the hundred delegates
Well she picked up a few not many just a few
No candidate in recent history democratic Republican is one of the White House without winning the Ohio primary she said at around in Columbus
We all know that if we want a democratic president we need a democratic nominee who can win democratic states just like Ohio
Although she won the popular vote in Texas her hundred delegates was complicated by the states bizarre nominating process
Which includes a separate caucus that awards 35% of the state's delegates irrespective of the primary result
It is so stupid so half-assed every state makes up their own crap because almost as stupid as the fact that they're talking now about all the other seats the delegates from Michigan and Florida
Even though nobody campaigned in Florida and everybody agreed they wouldn't and that the delegates wouldn't count in Michigan
There was nobody else on the ballot except her on the democratic side
Remember that she got 55% against her and now you're nitpicking
Yeah, the Associated Press reported that all told Obama retains his lead in the delegate count with 1477 pledge delegates to her 1391
And 86 in the delegate lead the AP said that 100 and oh I see
That's not the final total he's 85 ahead right now based on whatever they're telling
On Republican side is all over my cuckold very he finally threw in the towel he picked up the viability ripped out the pages
He's oh the hell with God and the hell with John McCain and hell with everybody you don't want my ass no we don't
I'll go very go back where you came from okay go back into that hole in the ground you mugwump you Bible thump and jackass
And John McCain who just turned 140 years old he ain't looking too good let me tell you
Yes that makes her prepared to make that to make that call
We went into Texas no higher down 20 points you know we had 111 straights under clin decided
That they could only contest in these two states where she had an advantage and she did well
But as I said before we emerged with the same delegate delegate gap between her and me that we had essentially before we got in
And so you know we have constantly focused on the next states in front of us we got Wyoming and Mississippi this week
He's gonna kick her ass of Wyoming Mississippi baby two biggies
Oh wow okay let's take a look here at our pool
Forget about all this other huzzle while let's get to the important pool right right on 163 votes
What are we gonna do when we get to 1100 we got to switch it again huh see I like this pool from Sean and Hollywood
But the one about whose list of most dramatically declined but we don't have enough names on there
You know what I mean yeah we can pull build open the phones get out here build my ass

See I'm gonna vote for sizzler man. All you can eat shrimp
How do you spell charter
All right, I just guess who's gonna correct you?
He's gonna know the Hungarian Charter SCAR DA. I don't know how you spell it. That's close enough
Or maybe it's a CZAR I think it's CZ
Hungarian Charter that was on a Craig sponsor. I don't think I ever got to eat there Rocky Graziani's was good too, but it won't get any votes
But I'll put it on there anyway
What the hell is cracking his knuckles again? No, no really nasty

Fours and wires and schmutz that I hear behind the event very complicated. I don't want to deal with it
Senator swore we scored big last night taking Texas handle
Ohio State's her husband said rain must win for her to retain be a viability in a race for democratic nomination
but
A close analysis of the delegate counts which still favor Barack Obama even after Clinton's Tuesday bomb may put a Clinton victory out of reach
By some calculations Clinton would have had need to win more than 60% of the vote in a dozen contest remaining between
Now in June 7th the ketchup bomb and pledge delegates a steep challenge that given that so far
She's won that much only in one state her one time adopted home of Arkansas
Although I think she did get that in Rhode Island last night. She got like 60 or whatever she got
Maybe not even in New York where she's a sitting senator. She won 57% of the vote
She won 55% of Michigan where Obama wasn't even on the ballot neither was anybody else. She got 55% against nobody
By CBS news is count Obama remains ahead 15 hundred and 12 to 14 23
Which is 89 ahead by AP's count Clinton got 13 91 and Obama 14 77 which is 86 lead Jim Jordan Iran Senator John Karrie's initial primary race in
2004 told the New York Post he believes she can't win
Her durable
Durabilities impressive not astonishing, but she's still looking at some pretty cold hard numbers in the racetrack and said she's running out of time
She's running out of space. He described her Clinton nomination even with wins in Texas in Ohio as really impossible
Impossibly how do you like that?
Carey is endorsed Obama the nomination fight another democratic strategy told the Post is difficult to see how the math works for Clinton
If you look at most models out there circulating the one thing that's consistent is that she has to perform very strong
We don't have any hope of making up the deficit among elected delegates
Clinton supporters mean while say Obama's momentum is waning. No, it's slowing. It's not waning
Siding her victories in the two states the theory of momentum suggested Obama should roll up equally large margins today
But voters seem to want to keep this race going said Paul baggalla a former Clinton eight I suspect swallah agrees with them
He said
No person is ever won the white line about a beep but a boop bit about there you go
More propaganda more spin, you know people going vote and then these lunatics they have spin
Who's gonna get Ricky up low? I'm here with what's called a professional audience plan for the Clinton campaign
Hello your job is to cheer and applaud at everything Hillary says in her speeches, right?
That's perfect, but you do more than that. You have a specialty. Yes, I'm a fanta
It's my job to pass out you you think well
There's women who think that Obama speeches and they couldn't find one for Hillary so they hired me
Yeah, I see you so you're a woman I'm a lesbian
lesbian don't let me say it that way would you like to demonstrate how you do this sure?
Okay stand back a little okay here we go. Oh
Hillary you're so wonderful
Oh
Want to see it again, okay? You're not help me. I'm just doing okay. Oh

Futsi

Let's Steve Lack put turn them into a all uh, poor chick East Asia or something
Which is kind of what he would do because he's talk about our radio loser my god Steve Lack
600 stations doing all sports now and Ray Perry's having a party in his pants about it too
I can tell you where the party is it's the array is that though
When you get to be uh this age, you know, you don't want to have a party in your pants because it generally turns out to be
And it wasn't one you planned you know, I mean that kind of a party
Morning dad says dual of historical gilts
Do I have time for this before the break absolutely not
But that's coming to a radio near you the radio speaker near you
I enjoy these uh the old restaurant place the brief back a lot of memory. It does a lot of tech dance on your taste buds
No, I'm looking for the tap dance music here we go

How do you ever eat at the monks in lever? I mean remember where the hell it was it was in date county somewhere at the monks in was in the gables
Christie's is a layer right of course

What I said I'd never heard of it
Christie's around your four miles something yeah, I'm your full
You better believe it stories a damn good place and George does know from it because it's in date county and in date county
He don't speak George's language
Breaking news
Rhythm we talk of a 10-day cruise to Baja carrying dozens of people sick and by the morlant
We should
You threw up on my gram gram the illness to produce nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. I think I may fall in
The
Dookie everywhere
You enjoy growing up every five minutes. It is the fourth suspected outbreak of war the ship since last year
I saw this truck guy throw up and then a pigeon ate it the rhythm except the set sail again tonight
For
I feel it and throw up I might explode
It's love at 16 I would see the unicorn or Rudy's on this list here
I could be wrong about that maybe uh, you know, let's just left it to the craps turn all the time
Yeah, but they slip to the crack
Just like what we just heard there sounded like something slipped through a big crack
We had the unicorn and Rudy's Rudy's was great. You know, remember Rudy's I'm sure you do I do
There was one right as you drove around as you went north on this game, Boulevard
She drove from the one I went to was out the one in Pembro puns on university in like as you drove
I'm 79 street and then you made the right hand turner on biscuit boulevard. It was run right off the corner there
Rudy's and you went through the drifter after work many a day after work at iod
Go through the drag through and just mind your mind. Maybe it was good by the way
Well, yes, uh, somebody's uh one of the factors that's coming across you right now is explaining the
The fact that that shopping center that I'm familiar with yes used to be evolved back in your old days before
That's right my mother lived there in that other place
So there you go the reason that I don't remember there being them all there is because I didn't live there when there was a mother
Now it's like a park park road and the Hollywood and Hollywood indeed
And I guess I found something online here, which believe me we could go till midnight although I don't want to waste the facts
Maybe we got a long list
It's a uh website memories of old Miami and date county florida
And I started printing it out because it looked pretty interesting and had restaurants and other things
And then it says page one of 62 well when it says pace
One was yeah, too. I don't think I'm gonna let it keep going
I can't have different pages, but you know I'll get to that in a minute
Do all the historical guilt strikes moring down in the New York Times today
She says someone in a women in their 30s 40s and early 50s who favor Barack Obama have a phrase to describe what they don't like about Hillary Clinton
Shorter pad feminism
They feel that women have moved past that man our pigs is what was me sisters must stick together
Pantsons are powerful era that Hillary's campaign is likely to be five with the vengeance
The men our pigs always me sisters must stick together
Pantsons are powerful era and they don't like Gloria Stein
Another old school feminist trying to impose gender discipline and call to order on the sisters
As a woman I know put it Hillary doesn't make it look like fun to be a woman and her
I've been victimized campaign is depressing
But Hillary carried on the panty shoulders of the older women in Texas or how in Rhode Island who loved her
I will survive rallying cry
That I'm a little older never in every wrinkle on my face has been saved to fight another day
Exit polls to show that fans of Hillary who won't say they'd be happy with Obama if Hillary dropped out
We're hardening in their opposition to him while Obama voters were not so harsh about her
Three Hillary volunteers older women from Boston approach the New York Times reporter in Austin, Texas parking lot on Tuesday
To vent that Hillary hasn't gotten a fair shake from the press
They said that they used to like Obama but now can't stand it because they think he's been cocky in this respectful to Hillary
As Hillary remarkably and cleverly put Obama on the defensive about a real estate deal health care and after her campaign
Ratchet it up the retro battle of the sexes when they sent that in fine-stun on the Fox News Sunday morning talk show
To promote the idea that Hillary should not be forced up regardless of the results of yesterday's primary simply because she's a woman
For those of us that are partly women not need to apply to generation that goes back to the time
I went out to get my first job following college and year of graduate workers in extraordinarily critical race to send her said
With Obama saying the hours upon us to elect the black man and Hillary saying the hours upon us to elect a woman
The Democratic primary has become the ultimate nightmare of liberal identity politics
All the victimizations go tripping over each other and colliding a competition of historical guilt
People will have to choose which Americans sins are greater and which stain will have to be removed first as misogyny worse than racism
It always races and worse than misogyny
As it turns out making history is actually a way of being imprisoned by history
It's all about the past
Old America's racial past be expunged or America's sexist past be expunged
As Ali Gallagher a white Hillary violent here in Austin told the Washington Post
Crystal Williams a friend of mine a black man said to me my ancestors came to this country in chains
I'm voting for Barack
I told him when my sisters came here in chains and on their periods I'm voting for Hillary
And meanwhile the conventional white man sits on the Republican side enjoys the spectacle of the Democratic's
Democrats identity pile up and victim lock
Just as Michelle Obama urged black to support her husband many shoulder-pads feminists are growing more fierce in charging that women who let
Obamalee progo or Hillary are traders
Julie Acevedo a precinct captain for Obama and Austin noted that many things were getting ugly around Friday during the early voting
Which he saw some very angry women just stopping by us to go to vote for Hillary they cut us off when we tried to walk
Talk about Barack
I'm 46 he said a fundraiser for state politicians
Maybe I missed it by a few years
But I don't know why these women are so fueled by such hostility and think other women are misogynists that they don't vote for Hillary

Memorina, did you find something that marginally interesting?
Margillin
Come on, you are such...
Now get your crystal out of it, it was like a ponderous, because it was all before he was born
Oh, it's all like that, whoop
That whole other option says the fat lady that Barack Obama had waiting in the wings to his den, I didn't even get the chance to clear her throat
Before Hillary Clinton said her packing with a plane ticket home in a hotel reservation in Denver for August
Obama didn't see a reveal and drive from the Democratic presidential race, instead she won two out of three primary races
And stayed yet another improbable comeback
Before the polls closed, Pundits wondered when Democratic leaders would descend on the senator from New York, and convince her to withdraw for the good of the party
Now they know what many political pros knew all along, never saw the Clinton short, never count anyone out before the final votes are counted
Many of those same pundits wrote off the struggling candidacy of John McKayne lie's fall, when New York's senator seemed to run out of steam and campaign cash
On the same night Clinton staged her comeback, McCain clinched the GOP nomination
So much for conventional political wisdom, when the shouting dies, Donald Clinton's victory may seem more cosmetic
She didn't gain much ground on Obama's lead in the delegate cup, and she still trails the Illinois Senator in states one, and the overall popular vote
But her wins in Ohio, Texas and Rhode Island, give her renewed straight street cred, energize the campaign, be set with morale and cash flow problems, and opens the door for the seven more weeks of the kind of attack-dog campaign tactics that some say turned around her campaign or recent days
Obama mainly may be declining as he struggles with three losses after a string of 12 straight primary wins, questions about his relationship with a corrupt Chicago real estate developer, and the shady political power broker still linger, it needs to add substance to his rhetoric if he wants to regain that lost momentum
Still, Obama has the numbers on his side, and Clinton will lead more than one night stand to overtake his lead, she can overtake Obama as super delegates vote her way, and she finds a way to con delegates from wins in Michigan and Florida
But winning in such a way could lead Democrats split and wounded for a tough fight with McCain in the fall, Yogi Barrow said in eight over until it's over, and this sucker is a long way from over
What's the biggest name?
Hold on, and then false alarm
I like doing that, keep him honest to us

What is this all about?
I have pushed very successfully for a very long time
But I have no intention of running to become our president
Why is that?

There is no doubt about that
And that does sometimes draw a little bit of controversy and criticism
Do you believe that Barack Obama is ready to be president?
Absolutely
He is one of the people that I admire most in the world
Why?

Oh, stories, that's right
We did the stories that are gone
And once they're gone, they're gone
Right
And now we're doing the restaurants that are gone
See, I don't know about you
But one of the last things I would ever want to do
Be in a restaurant business
Oh, yes
All my life, everybody's always said, oh, the worst business
Ever go into as a restaurant business?
Oh, we know this radio, but second to that maybe

They were everywhere, they were huge stuff
Yeah, they were everywhere, so therefore so I just didn't get it
I was just looking for a little bit of Lums
I mean, Wags was a million times better than Lums
Lums had very limited menu, you know they had winners and burgers and uh, and whatever
Too long for me to remember, I know I've been there, but it was Lums

Beach State Carly 17, England Oyster House 16
Corkeys 15
And let me say it to you again, I want to emblaziness in your brain, I said it three years ago
Well, it's more true now than it ever was then
Once Corkeys left, the day that Corkeys in North Miami Beach on 163rd Street closed its doors the last time

One of my way to say it's not going to be closed till next month and he just puts puts it on here again
You are so easy, man
Villa deli too, Hungarian Charter too
Villa deli should have more than that, remember it's the delivered that...
Oh boy, I would be
Now that would be a good poll question for myself
At which station did we get the best food delivered all the time?
Now that would be a tight, I guess a real tight battle between Zeta
And I would be
Oh, I have to take your word for it
What do you mean by that?
I only know from IOD and it would be like one to three places every day that would be lined up
It would be in the pudding and shifts
It would have to stagger the door
Now what was the tire restaurant I've ever been to?
I would be put him out of business because the Jeff Clark was maybe a member there

I'm saying it was damn good
Daniel LaDouche in the Washington Post says
The message to the scoreboard in the National Park is like a high definition TV on steroids
There's Dan Abash
And Stelke from others and the original Shrunk and Head on CNN
And although that might not be the best word to associate with baseball these days, steroids
There's no getting around the size of this monster
It's a big one baby
Said for its first public viewing
Oh I see yesterday
The screen is the equivalent of a 13-hours TV
More than five times as large as the scoreboard at R&K Memorial Stadium
Other than the game on the field it's separately the centerpiece of the fan experience
At the 41,000-seat ballpark, National's Park
Live action, instant-replace, images, graphic stats all there
Oh stats, maybe our jerseys can go there and read the stats for the crowd with some bongos in the back
And the programming is brand new so the high-tech features will have the same freshness as the
$6.11 million stadium where the Washington National Hose of the regular season opened on March 30 against the Braves
You've got a lot of graphics associated with the inaugural season nationals
Park to start a new era, said Chris Maschitello
Executive VP of Technology, Sales and Services at ANC Sports
A digital sign that's coming in and it's working with the team
Stars and Strets have got a very prominent theme
But axels will figure some highlights and a formal unveiling of the scoreboard they did it yesterday
Excuse me, but they want to keep things mostly surprised
Well we weren't there so we can't give you any a loadout, we can't give you the skinny
Although Zach lost a couple of positive give you the skinny, fat Zach
They promised a range of programming made possible by high-definition LED technology
That the learner family paid to have upgraded beyond the basic specs called for an evolved park design
The city built the ballpark and the learners owned the team
We were just limited by our imagination, said David London, the National Scoreboard Producer
Wow!
Few may be happier than London about the moves of the new ballpark on South Capital Street
RFK Stadium is nearly 50 years old and just wasn't built to handle modern scoreboard technology
And of course with that great team, the Washington Nats, oh my god
I'm going to share Georgia with you there for opening day of the new stadium
Park to watch the Nats and the Bravos
Sure, right at your Nats
They're flying around, grab them
Do we ever figure out that restaurant where I've slid off the toilet seat, Vittys?
They're still around right in the Fort Lauderdale, World of the Hell there, our 441 I guess
I'll take a look
I'll take another one that's definitely not around
And it was on 441 in Lauderdale, changing neighborhoods baby, it was an understakehouse
Chuck's
Chuck's steakhouse?
Okay, doesn't ring any bells?
No
Are you, are you, are you smitten me?
I had a steakhouse, steakhouse, they had great drinks
I'll take a look at the board
Inexpensive, huh?
I'll take your work for it
It was on 441 in Lauderdale
And of course, changing neighborhoods
Well, I know, yeah, got kind of like a smarmy, you know
Kind of run down
And it was also that four guys pizza, whatever that was right in that same area
On 441 Lauderdale, was it four guys?
Three guys in a bean bag?
Something
I don't know
It was awesome, you just don't get around very much
That's right
Well, I'm just telling you, ever in a year, these places certainly were there before when you're talking about coming back
Just because you got, eating all the pre-food at work and then trying to afford to buy in the actual real cash money
You know, the last time I lived in Miami
I'm 441 and, and Broward I'm talking about, Chuck's and, uh, at pizza joint
Yeah, don't remember it
Is the Lauderdale in Miami?
Maybe
Don't remember it
You better get with him, Mr.
Alright, I'll be right back
Time is passing you by, and you know, the worst thing is to miss a really great restaurant
And then somebody says, oh, she had a great place and now it's closed
And you think, gee, I'm sure we should have eaten there
Is that what you think?
Yeah, that's what I think
I don't know what you think, actually she's the way I am
That's right
The crack was Simon Fowl
Yeah, I don't like him with the public my life
You know what?
Fuck you
New York City, hello

Okay, but is it true?
Uh, yeah, yeah
Wow, I like people who are pretty straight
Yeah, I like straight people
Well, what if someone's definitely the best singer that happens to be gay?
It just doesn't matter because they're never going to win
North Providence, Rhode Island, hello
I mean, you still like the pay prostitutes to spank you with a hairbrush?

That was great seeing you
Yeah, thank you for having me on my way

On February 13th, Shakespeare retailers in Texas
We do it when a federal appeals court ruled just in time for Valentine's Day
The Texas prohibition against the sale of villos and
Pocket, well, I can't say the word
Violated the 14th Amendment
I didn't realize that was an historic pocket
It's the keyword
I know
Pocket, these, Violated the 14th Amendment
Right
According to Texas Penal Code
It's forbidden to sell or advertise an artificial penis or vagina
Primarily for the stimulation of human genital
What if it's secondarily?
Well, maybe it's like a mental piece
I can call me a virgin, you're a little mitreasing
Calling you a metallic or a baby, you're a little bit too old
I can't tell you how to deal with it
I can't tell you how to deal with it
Okay
Jesus
No, that's a lie
The statute
The statute makes a reception for instance
In which the purchase meets a medical
Psychiatric, Judicial, legislative or law enforcement need
Oh, she needs a judicial dildo
Even so unreliable consultants versus one
You're only normally conservative, fit, circuit, court of appeals
Struck down the ban
On grounds that it violated the right of ordinary citizens
To engage in private intimate contact in the home
Conduct without government intrusion
One of only four states banning sexual doodas
The other three being virginia, Mississippi and Alabama
Texas is not about to take this insult lying down, so to speak
Last week, state attorney general Greg Abbott petitioned the appellate court
To reconsider the matter
And I would wrote that it permitted to stand
Of course this is my invite
Challenges to previously uncontroversial criminal prohibitions
On sexual practices such as
Concentral ideal incest or bigamy

The design of the original D&D game with Dave Arnison in 1974
And went on to create the dangerous journeys and legendary adventure RPGs
As well as a number of board games
He also wrote several fantasy novels
I don't think I really glocted yet, said Mike Murls, the lead developer of the upcoming 4th edition of Dungeons and Dragons
He was like the cool uncle of every gamer head
He shaped an entire generation of gamers
GIG-AX?
Murls
GIG-AX was not directly involved with Dungeons and Dragons after 85th's relationship with his former company T.S.R. Inc.
Wasn't friendly at first
The company sued him over his competing game Dangerous Journeys
And in 2000 for interview with Game Spy, he stated that he was pleased to say that
He thought the girl he associates to the game
While reportedly on a front of the Dungeons and Dragons game, he created adventures and settings that could be used with it
Which were published by Troll Lord Game

And that would be surprised if you get called in for another inquisition
How come you guys can't end the show the right way everyday so they know when to start
That's just us were bastards
If you want to call it in sign...let me try it again.
I haven't even got to the first sentence that is,
by Michael Collins on the smirking chimp,
Obama's lost votes no surprise.
Is that a lie?
If you want to call it significant undercounting your assets,
a euphemism for fraud, Michael Bloomberg,
made of New York City commenting on 80 election districts
with zero votes for Barack Obama.
A review by the New York Times of the unofficial results
reported on primary and I found about 80 election districts
among New York City's 6,106, or Mr. Obama,
supposedly didn't receive even one vote,
including cases where he ran a respectable race in the nearby district.
The reports of voting problems in New York City
should come as no surprise.
Anyone who's examined the administrative urban elections administration
and reporting in the modern political era
knows that the urban centers have shot evoting equipment,
curious results, really question or investigated,
and lackluster administration.
In 2004, a stunning event occurred,
one so stunning was never reported by the mainstream media,
according to the media consortium's Nationalized at Poll,
George W. Bush won the election,
through a huge increase in his big city votes,
three cities are defined as half a million or greater population.
Let's take a look at the questions about results in New York
and other big cities in 2004 election
and how those questions were apparent to the mainstream media
but deliberately ignored.
This will provide an obvious clue
about what's behind the 80 election districts,
absent Obama votes,
and other urban election irregularities
as they show up around the country in 2008.
80 districts, he didn't get a one vote in any of them in New York.
Accordingly, 2004, a final exit poll
from the media consortium,
a PPC and then the four-mage in efforts,
there was a 66% increase in big city turnout,
compared to a 16% average increase nationwide.
Bush made huge vote gains compared to a 2,000 exit poll,
even when any big cities,
but without these gains, he would have lost the election.
He shared a big city minority votes
with similar water ben in 2000,
minority showed a strong lawyer to the Democrats,
but how about that 80% increase
and turn out for big city white voters?
Right away we know that there's something wrong with the exit poll.
The exit poll showed that Bush increased his votes here in the big cities
by 53% over 2,000 performance.
He also racked up a healthy game in the smaller cities,
breaking even with Kerry where Gore had whipped his ass,
57% to 40% that category in 2000.
Charles Cook led the upward tyranny list
by proclaiming that Bush and Roe v.R.N.
the best plan best executed presidential campaign ever.
Cook was dead wrong when he asserted
that the Republican gains in big cities came through defections
from traditional Democratic voters,
lacks Latinos and Jewish voters,
that simply did not happen.
We were also told that 2004 was a red versus blue election.
The media concerned him that specified and sponsored
and the polling and an analization somehow failed to report
massive reductions in the Bush Roe vote totals,
two million less than 2004 revealed by their own polling.
They also failed to mention the major reduction of the role segment,
which fell from 23% of the electorate in 2000 to 16% in 2004.
Roe white set this one up,
and nobody bothered to tell us that.
But we're in for a surprise,
while Roe white stayed home in record numbers
according to the exit poll,
four million new white voters were conjured up in the big cities.
Bush supposedly grabbed those big city gains according to the final exit polls of 2004,
Grobby Bush among big city white voters,
54% to 40% in 2000.
But in 2004, white ghosted Roe's in their slumber
and rushed to the polls to give Bush the votes he needed.
From five million in 2000,
the number of white voters swell to nine million in 2004,
giving Bush a 39% share for 2004,
compared to just 26% in 2000,
it was a freaking miracle.
The national exit poll finding of our four million new big city white voters resulted in major gains for Bush,
and the immediate conservative national exit poll scenario,
the big city turned out waving the resulting millions of white ghosts easily compensated
for the two million fewer votes
both gotten his red state stronghold,
the rural voting segment.
This information is all in the data sets used to formulate the final exit polls for 2000 and 2004.
The false basis for the claimed 66% increase in big city turnout by the immediate conservative
was revealed in the discussed in June and again this September of last year.
Official big city vote totals,
the vote count is opposed to the estimated vote based on exit polls,
showed only a 17% increase in turnout based on 13 big city vote totals representing 60% of the big city population.
Here's how the immediate conservative explained their 66% increase in big city turnout, no comment,
no correction, not a word.
They don't care because they don't have to, they don't want to.
The big cities are treated like a political version of Roman Polanski's Chinatown,
a place where we hide our deepest secrets knowing fuel will look even fewer where we report their findings.
Select the reporting erases real news that's tidying up history so the truly important questions are never asked and never answered.
This action takes on extra meaning when reporting I focus on highly questionable behavior by the owners of media organizations that do the reporting.
Why would New York City be any different?
The National exit poll is the narrative for our national elections,
it's used by nearly every major media organization to explain who voted, why they voted,
the way they did and where they voted.
We now know that the 2004 National exit poll is deeply flawed in its measure of big city voting.
What about the official big city vote totals?
These are the votes reported by election officials in New York City based on official reported totals,
which votes increased in all five boroughs in 2004 compared to 2000.
Turn out for the president so it was only 12% to 260,000 votes in New York,
but Bush got almost all of that with 47% increase over 2000.
He went from 399,000 and 2000 to 588,000 in 2004.
One of the nation's poorest areas that branched was so pleased with Bush that the voters emerged to give him a 40% increase.
Brooklyn also showed its appreciation, maybe it was those new big city white voters the exit poll found.
Heavily democratic queens had new votes in excess with the president,
all three liberal Manhattan and the side of 9-11 fell generous and gave Bush 17% more votes in 2004 than they did in 2000.
We must believe that four years had allowed some New Yorkers to know and love the president with these increased margins.
How did that happen?
Did Bush do something special to appeal to New Yorkers, was he campaigning hard in the big apple?
How often did he visit New York after the convention?
One piece of evidence not often mentioned,
but in the speech of the city of Bush's improved performance in 2004,
so that the international announced poll findings in August 30th of last year.
On the eve of a Republican national convention in the hooking 9-11 symbol sound bites and imagery,
half of New York City residents say that some of our leaders knew in advance that attacks were planned on around 9-11
and that they consciously failed to act.
There's a very good argument that many of the 50% would go out and vote just to send a message.
There's no argument at all that a single one of that 50% would ever vote for Bush under any circumstances.
Nevertheless, he received 47% more votes in 2004 in New York than in 2000.
How can these games happen?
Can we believe this took place in the city with a tradition ranging from indifference to hostility of national Republicans?
At a time when nearly half the population believed that some of our leaders knew about 9-11 advance but just let it happen?
These results make no more sense than the big city numbers in the media sponsored exit polls.
Did the pundits, officials and politicians forget the hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers are protested?
The mere presence of Republicans at the National Convention in New York in 2004?
Did they fail to notice a major increase in vote totals by a dislike present and hostile territory while that same candidate was suffering major vote losses in his rural base?
A political parties and media refused to admit that to the failed 2000 for exit polls findings.
The median politicians also failed to notice the unbelievable increase in New York City votes for Bush in 2004.
We can anticipate that the national media will now ignore what New York Times reporter Roberts found and they will miss one likely explanation.
That's a typical expert event points to a election fraud.
And it goes on to the length of ponderous, you know what I mean? Too many numbers.
You read numbers, you made a good ending up.
To me, in fact, Georgia I think is passed on.
What?
Not passed out, passed on.
Passed on to what?
Passed it on.
To the other side.
All right.
And now what Jim Morrison said?
Breakout through.
Pass out through to the other side.
He's out there.
He's in France now.
He's ten in bar.
He's ten in bar.
He's ten in bar.
It's some frog bar.
Maybe he's in Montréal.
The biggest name.
The vast majority of his little projects.
Fortight of 5.60 QAM.
The highest points leader.
This is honored.
This is not a tumor.
It's the one that took two hours.
This is honored with his news.
Former president Clinton was in Texas yesterday, something for his wife.
If she wins in Texas, you know how?
I think she'll be the nominee.
It's all on you.
You can trust her with your money.
President Clinton was criticized for what some were calling negative campaigning towards Barack Obama.
Senator Obama.
It's severely hydrocephalic.
His head is big.
So incomprehensibly large.
It is a serious problem.
You should tell you today he stayed very positive.
In fact, he never mentioned Barack Obama's name one story in speech.
I worked hard to try to kill him.
I tried.
So I tried and failed.
It was a perfect political strategy.
I just wanted to make sure everybody knows I'm helping her.
She loves it.
But it sounded gruesome.
President Bill Clinton is fine tuning the message.
Senator Obama.
Cut in half.
You notice how they put him back into the cupboard and made him disappear last couple of weeks?
Yeah, he started.
And how much better he did last night?
What if that's his coincidence?
Oh, well.
Well, we had 51 dropouts on our streaming there.
I have no idea what else going on with that.
That's not good, man.
Fick you on dropout and it happened like in a lickety split.
Yeah, I mean, it's a nightmare out there.
It's the weather.
Was that what it is?
Storm in dormant.
What's that got to do with your internet streaming?
Are you kidding?
No.
It got, you know, the wires, travels on wires and storms knock things out.
Lightning, you know.
245 votes on our, which restaurant, the joint?
No longer there, did you miss the most?
And Lums continues when I, I don't know.
I agree with you.
I don't get it.
I mean, I'm not saying that Lums is OK.
It was fine, but compared to some of these other really good type like the studio, I mean, I guess this is a poll for Schleppers.
I don't know.
I mean, everybody could afford to eat the Lums.
Even the homeless could afford to eat the Lums, right?
There's a Schlepper factor.
Oh, wait a minute.
There's McKinnon Bush.
Oh, what a Kinnon Bush.
It's a Kinnon Bush.
I'm out before the cameras had...
Call a daughter of no craziness.
Call a woman to be endorsed under the Kinnon.
I mean, what a difference.
Eight years, Nick.
Yeah.
Fony Baloney, that's what he's trying to say.
Fony Baloney.
Remember that smearing, smearing, he'd be out of the Kinnon in 2000, wow.
Yeah.
So that he did steal a freight train.
Lums 50, Sizzler 34, now that was yours, wasn't it?
Right.
Wolfies 28, V. State Charlie's 21.
Were those big pictures of Sangria?
You know, I was thinking during the break about the most
the meaning jobs other than the ones we're doing.
Right.
The most the meaning jobs you could, and I'm thinking of being a waiter or waitress.
I agree.
Isn't it the meaning they get their revenge?
Because I was thinking about guys peeing in the Sangria.
You know, there are no the difference.
I think that should's called San Pia.
Yeah, it might be.
I'm out of, I'm out of, I'm out of poor beer with the Santa Pia.
Anyway, I just, I can't envision doing that.
Waiting on people and like kissing their ass and like, and of course then you get all these ground cheaper.
A lot of time.
Oh, this was then, it was cooked a little bit too much.
Can't you get it to, or the best one is people are real, real cheap skates who eat like 90% of the steak and then,
oh, I want to send it back.
It was, I don't want it.
I don't like it.
And they've eaten 90% of whatever the meal was.
You know, I didn't like it.
Right.
What they try to do is get hope that they'll not the thing off the bill and they won't have to pay for it.
Cheap.
If there's one thing, it's one thing for people to be cheap who can't afford, you know, who need to be cheap.
Like you guys.
Yeah, but George isn't cheap even at Gostin last couple of times.
He's, he's got a little bit of plunge in there for guys to make a try.
He's like, he's sitting now.
Hey, you know, when in Rome.
Rome.
Do the Romans.
Right in Rome do the Romans and believe you me.
Oh, baby.
Wow.
Oh, who's this David?
What's his name?
Hernandez from American Idol, which I don't watch.
You never have an ever-wielding with him on their naked.
Who is he?
He's a pretty good looking guy.
He's got some fake.
Is he another, uh, queen?
Yes.
He was a male, male stripper or something like that.
A male model.
I don't know what, a male stripper.
That's what he's going to be.
The big scandal.
That's the news, says, yeah.
And it's interesting because I was just, I always on your Yahoo.
You know, you're all that big on getting your news from Yahoo.
So they had a picture there.
American Idol scandal.
A bubble by, you know, I'm a big picture.
And some of the pictures he looks really, really great.
I mean, like a beautiful guy to look.
And some of the pictures he looks very.
Yes.
A screamer, you know what I'm saying?
Faaaning.
What?
As you know, when you go check your email, those are the stories that are right there in your face.
Yes.
So it's difficult to avoid something.
Oh, I know.
Once in a while, I'll check some of those out.
I mean, you realize I do have like, I've got a pile of crap here all the way to the scene.
I'm going to read one of these local papers or watch the local news.
For the news.
No, I would hope not.
Or CNN.
Oh, my God.
For we saw Senator John McCain.
I want to switch over right now to MSNBC and see if they got some of them.
You know, who's a real idiot on MSNBC?
She's in a simple thing.
And every now and then, oh, it light up electronic board that we call all these states.
We can put that to bed now.
Chris Matthews talking politics.
Chris Matthews is going to have, you know, he's like, like what's his name?
What's his name?
Gloria Vanderbilt's son, Anderson Cooper, you know, what about him?
He talks with a speech defense party as we're honoring today.
You can't even say politics.
You know, he can't even pronounce it.
He talks all the time about politics.
How can you talk about it when you can't say it?
And he talks out of the side of his mouth.
He's good for the second try.
The college try.
I've got a college try.
The old college, you had a good college try.
And anyway, I don't want to wait on people, you know.
Ohio, she went by 10% 54 to 44.
Oh, Rhode Island, she went to Zastaf, he went to 40.
He went for her ass in Vermont by 20.
What was it?
A lot, 22 points.
And in Texas, she went by four points.
And the caucuses, the Obama beat her 52 to 48.
It was close.
It was Nippentuck, Nippent Suds.
And the Vermont beat her by 20 points, 59 to 39.
Let me say it again.
Well, we need, there are two things that we need.
One is forced sterilization and two is a national primary.
It's not available.
Right.
It's not, it's not.
Then you wouldn't have the buckles like we had a Michigan Afroda this year.
Oh, we want to be early.
We want to help set the agenda.
We want to be at a course they want of setting nothing.
And if she and her, her henchmen there trying to try to like say,
oh, and they're already saying it, you know.
Oh, we got to get those delegates, you know,
from Florida and Michigan, they got to come.
Well, guess what?
Have a real election then.
Especially in Michigan, she's the only one on the ballot.
She only got 55% against nobody.
And she's saying all she wanted delegates.
Give me a break, okay?
Give me a break, honey.
What do you want it?
What was that?
What?
You hear that?
Look.
This thing is doing some funky stuff today, man.
Maybe that's why we had, now was it porn cats and dogs when you came in?
Look.
Because we're able to show.
Remember we have a no-sificant.
And then in the early part of the show, when you have lost your eyes,
it's very nice.
And, uh, you said it's porn, you know, that,
it's porn dogs at that point.
No, this was before when we lost contact.
Yeah, before, yes.
When I was sitting here during the show,
I was just wondering, is George ever going to show up on this thing again or what?
What?
Jesus, K Christ, man.
Patience, one, it's four of the good.
I watch him, but I'm not so sure about him, you know.
Prime victims.
I mean, he's an okay news video.
You know who oughta be the anchor on NBC News?
You still don't know who he is.
Lester Hold.
Although they got your list funky new glasses.
They look like 3D glasses.
He was wearing last night in Texas somewhere.
Maybe he was trying to disguise himself.
Lester Hold would be a great anchor on NBC.
They would kick everybody's ass.
He's great.
He's got a sensational voice.
He's articulate.
He's a good news reader.
He looks good on the air, except with the stupid 3D glasses.
He oughta be the NBC News anchor, not Brian Williams.
Why don't they consult with me?
I mean, I have to say CBS a ton of money.
I would've taken just for consulting about a 10th of what they're paying Katie Kirk, that bitch.
You can find her numbers with a Magnivision reading glass.
So anyway, let's get back to the pool here.
Okay, such as it is, love, lums, eh, tubs.
Yeah, take some tubs when you go to lums.
Next time I'm down there, I think we're going to go to a lums on Davy Road Extension.
Okay, what?
Nothing but, you know, Davy Road Extension is very close to where my used to live.
You do know that she was on Sterling Road?
I do know.
You know where she lived.
What else was she was in carriage hills on Sterling Road?
Well, what's that restaurant across the street from where I think it's still there, the Ark?
Oh my God, she always wanted to take us to the Ark.
Oh, and they bring us soup by the order of the night.
Okay?
Because they want to get you in an out of their real fast, and I'm turning over the tables.
The Ark.
Every Dithy Ark?
No.
From past it.
You have?
Yes, I have.
I mean, this is years ago, so maybe it's great.
No, I shouldn't offer opinions on places that I haven't tried in a long, long time, you know?
Or ever.
I mean, like cheesecake factory, you can have it.
No, look at that dessert.
So, weaker to a go at all.
Oh, the cheesecake factory.
You can have it.
You can have their cheesecake.
And if they're on-trace, if you have the whole, the whole damn thing.
The Chabang?
The whole Chabang.
Horrible.
There's nothing worse than people making a big fuss about something.
Oh, you're in 11, it's going to be great.
And you go there, and it was, oh, just Kakka, man.
Nasty.
Kakka.
Nasty.
Which out of business restaurant you missed the most?
Lums 52, Sizzler 36, Wolfies 31.
Wolfie Cohen, I'm sure, long since dead.
Wouldn't he be- wouldn't he be amazed to see that Rascal House code on the tube?
Well, he sold it to an Epicure, right?
Epicure is good.
You can go there and get some stuff, cabbage, or maybe some gulf of fish like that.
So all the old Jews holding that area, you don't have to get all of them out of shape.
But Rascal House is closing next month.
Less than a month, I think.
Or maybe it's a little over a month.
April 7, I believe.
Okay.
Not soon enough.
Taco Viva 23.
B. State Charlie's 22.
The Winnie the Noisder House 21, man.
I sure wish they had that, Charlie.
And I don't want to tell you this.
Anybody who likes Manhattan Clan Chowder, better than New England Clan Chowder, doesn't like Clan Chowder.
I agree.
I mean, Manhattan Clan Chowder is like vegetables soup.
Correct.
I mean, let's find it a pitch, but hey.
It's like ministerially without the noodles and with like a couple of clams swimming around in it.
Right up.
Corkeys 20, Ragn 16, Wolfies 15, Ragn Chowves 15, Pumperd X-14, all the oldsters man.
They put those places out of Venice.
They stole the silverware.
They stole the sweet and low.
They stole, I'm never as long as I live for, get back in those days at INC.
And some old coup, he calls me up in the air, because I was talking about people stealing the silverware.
And he says, why not?
Why not?
We're paying for the meal.
Why can't we take it?
You're not paying for the silverware.
We're not saying, pick up the damn table.
Or can't take it out of the two.
Put it in the back of the civilian and take it home with you.
God.
So you won't see them no more, because they were put out of business by a bunch of barbarians.
Black Anus has got 13.
There's nothing like the old Black Anus.
Manero's 10, Burton Jack's 9, Sambo's 8, Mr. Codialin's 6th, Fett.
The Unicorn's 6 bow jangles for a near-state house for meals for Rudy's 3, Monks in only 3.
Vito's pizza, 3-volodelli, 3 rocky grassy, 3 piccolos, 3.
Joe's, Sonkins, Gold Coast's got 2, I told you, Chris.
Legendary.
Yep.
The Sizzlin' 2, not the Sizzlin' but the Sizzlin' I don't know what that is.
2.
Got a pair.
The clock 2, the studio only 2.
For the studio restaurant, Freddy's studio, oh my god.
Some of you people are tasting your Tush in your Black Anus.
Hungarian Charter 2, Sizzlin' 2, and only 1.
For Luther's Barbecue, Figaro's Turp Pub, Gigi's and Prince Hamlet.
And none for Tyler's the painted horse sporting bruise or marries.
Poor Mary.
The best out of a T-reff is neurologist.
Sport formula 5.62 AM.
The sports leader.
Guys are very handsome young men.
Who can't see that?
The purpose of the campaign is to build for the future.
Not just to focus on 2008, to build alternative parties.
Build new democracy.
And involve more people.
Here comes another presidential comment, Sizzlin' is known as a Moverettas sacred.
We do include a statement to the race in the race later.
Hey, well, the later.
Because I get things done, I've got a 40-year record here in Washington.
Big money and the closing down of Washington against citizen groups prevents
from trying to improve our country.
And everybody has to have the right to not change the improve of their country.
Because we're sure government, you've got to go into electoral groups.
And for many years, this consumer undercated.
I was running in the race independent race leader.
But we get the bonfire, both of the young and sacred.
Hey, well, the later.
On 18 at 5.60, speaking of gathering old fools, there's W.
This is a say, age old question.
And John McCain, who just turned 142, is standing there in front of the White House.
But if he put a boob, put a way out, unbelievable.
So then when I take back what I said about David Hernandez.
Okay.
I just did a little bit of research.
He's a bizarre way.
But what time of the spaceship plan?
The what?
The spaceship.
Oh, what I said.
And what's all this other stuff coming up?
You'll be very disturbed to know, just like I am.
That today I've had two calls from India.
Soliciting postal visitors from India after that the thing yesterday would get my internet fixed.
Is this the cause?
No.
Yeah, he's strange looking out.
There are some people, I know this is a strange thing to say, but it's true.
There are some people who photograph very well.
And they take pictures and it makes them look really, really much better than they actually look.
And there are some people who are very good looking and they photograph poorly.
That's that strange at all.
Oh, why is that?
Rock-meach.
Shouldn't the picture be worth a thousand, true?
I mean, should the picture show you what somebody looks like?
It should, but when you're looking at somebody not in the picture, they're always, you know, your point of view is always changing.
Their head is moving, you know.
A picture freezes a moment in time.
They're having a movement?
Sometimes it just happens to be a bad moment.
Go ahead, buddy.
I'm serious.
There are some people who photograph very, very well.
Yeah.
What do they say?
What do they say?
They're photogenic and they always look really, really hot.
And there are some people that are really great looking and you look at the picture like, oh, so I don't know about that.
And I know what I'll pass.
And I'm sure he will, too.
It's 24, though.
He's on American Idol.
Yeah.
He can belt it out.
Where do they find all those queens on there?
By the way, is that prerequisite?
It just so happens.
It just happens, though.
It's just an accident.
380 votes on the pool.
And Lombs is still leading the way with 52.
Lombs 52 is just going to 36.
Wolfies 33.
Wolfies was good, man, if you didn't have to be Jewish to like Wolfies.
You're like a good, uh, Ruben sandwich and like a bowl of mosa ball soup.
Mm-hmm.
I do.
What's not to like?
Slowly fresh off a campaign setting, come back hinted today at the possibility of sharing the Democratic presidential ticket with Barack Obama.
And with her at the top.
Obama played down his losses, stressing he still holds the lead in delegates and referred to a talk of a joint ticket as premature.
George would like a joint ticket.
Sure.
I could take it for a free joint.
Or a ticket joint.
Right.
Or a ticket to ride, depending on who he was going to ride.
On night, they failed to clarify the Democratic race.
John McCain, Clinton's the Republican nomination.
While switlery won primaries in Texas, Ohio and Rhode Island, holding Obama's winning streak, who won in Vermont?
Both Democrats insisted today to head the best credentials they go ahead to head against McCain or his Clinton put a toe to toe.
How about ass to ass on the spectrum?
Like in Requiem.
I gotta watch that again.
I haven't watched that in a long time.
You know what?
Do you think we need to see it again?
Regularly.
You want to get depressed.
It's a very good move.
Or if you are depressed, watch it and you feel better because you think, boy, I got problems, huh?
Sarah and, uh, what was his name?
I forgot.
I don't know what his name is Jim.
Oh, yeah, Jim.
His name wasn't really Jim.
You just call them that.
I don't.
Let's see how many of you that I remember.
When he showed him that purple vein.
Ooh, thank you, Jim.
Maybe he just called all white guys.
I don't know.
Why not?
Especially if they had a purple vein.
They all look the same.
Wow.
I never thought I'd get to see Jerod Lee.
There was purple vein, but I did.
I feel like Loyla.
I asked on CBS the early show whether she and Obama should be on the same ticket, Clinton said.
That made me wear this his head.
But of course we have to decide who's on top of the ticket.
I think the people of Ohio.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
I think the people of Ohio very clearly said it should be me.
How about all the other states who lost, bitch?
How do you like that?
Obama who had hoped to knock her out yesterday said he would prevail against a tenacious candidate.
Who just keeps on ticking.
She takes a looking and just keeps on ticking.
What a grotesque thought that is.
Oh.
What should I do?
Clinton.
Hey, how'd you go?
Clinton acknowledged the race was closed instead of it coming down to her credentials on national security and the economy.
Well, it's going to come down to hosting delegates as well.
It's going to come down to high.
New presidential content has made the rounds of the more network TV shows this morning declaring only one thing certain
that the campaign would go on and next day showed Obama to career April 22 in Pennsylvania.
Before catching a flight back to Illinois from Texas, Obama told the press,
we're just focused on winged denomination.
That's my focus.
I respect Senator Swarovich.
He's been a tenacious opponent.
It's premature to talk about a joint ticket.
McCain, whose grasp on denomination won't seem to be just in reach.
What do you know why he won, don't you?
Did he fall?
I got a fault.
I won't buy a fault.
Look at the field of goofballs.
Juliannie, who at one time everybody thought was a shoe-in,
who I didn't bother to run a campaign because he was busy eating deli in Hollywood,
who didn't make any impact at all,
a Huckaberry who finally last night got the message,
Mitt Romney, who people are, people are, they may enjoy cartoon characters in the cartoons,
but not like in real life.
So, who is he running against?
You're better.
Ron Paul?
Oh, Neil, are you scared of Ron Paul?
He's a scary guy.
He's like Luca Brassi's a very scary guy.
McCain, whose grasp was once, uh, distant reach,
was headed for the White House today.
Well, he's there right now as a matter of fact.
Chris Matthews is talking about politics.
He could venture his country over there.
He made an investment in America, alone in that cell,
when he was being tortured,
and afraid of being put to death at any moment,
and turning down a chance to come home.
And those are non-political facts,
which I think do work for him.
And when this gets closed, come November,
when it will be, I think, you probably agree,
likely to be a very close contest between him,
and whoever wins the Democratic fight.
And I think people will look at that bat,
that here's a man who has a,
who has a, here's a man who said one thing,
when I did something else like Wayne would say, you know.
The president had a five-star ceremony
with a formal welcome to the White House's North Portico,
lunch in Bush's private dining room,
and a formal endorsement in the Rose Garden.
We just saw that in one of the vomit.
Clinton's victory's last night, tonight in Alabama,
a rare, a ripe opportunity to drive her
from the Democratic presidential race.
It was ripe.
Can you smell it?
I smell something.
It's like three cheese, man, really ripe,
and really, ooh.
But a bomb came away with a large-yard delegates too,
and counting that continued today,
meaning he's got a lead that's going to be tough to overcome.
We still have an insurmountable lead, he said.
We're very confident about where we're going to be,
and that we can win the nomination in the general direction.
Clinton owned bomb.
It's been most of the past two weeks in Ohio and Texas,
but it beat the boot, but it went on,
and it goes on.
And we don't care about it all.
Happy to have Karen Finney,
it's folks falling for the DNC with us.
Oh, God.
Margot said stick with CNN, okay, at least.
At least once in a while, you get somebody on there
who's good for laughs like Candy Cowley,
or Wolflet's Creek, you know?
You're the game will watch it, though, isn't it?
No, hardass.
Yeah, exactly.
Busy Washington, Tellanovela.
Sure.
Exactly, but no, I'm working on a Sunday.
It's a big, big, land-American boobies.
That's right.
Now, where are most of those shows from?
From like Juvenile Fueyla, or various places, but yes.
That is way less of Mexico.
Mexico.
Mexico.
You got a few white people in Mexico.
They keep them locked up in the movie studio.
Argentina.
Get some poignant here.
Even some Brazilian ones, which are dubbed in Spanish.
So, I'm really guessing.
Because it's portugacy?
See.
Now, why do you think that is?
Don't let the team rather strange to you?
What?
That would be like the people in Quebec speaking French.
Yeah.
That would be like the people in the county, no speaking English.
But then again, consider where the people in the county came from, see.
I can understand that.
So, where did the people in Brazil come from?
Hunger?
A lot of them came from Italy.
Did they?
Oh, yeah.
I didn't know that.
I was in a town in Brazil.
I didn't know that.
I thought I'd ever been there.
It's too damn far.
I was going to go to São Paulo.
But it was from Miami.
It's nine hours.
Nine hours.
You can go to Europe for nine hours, you know?
You want to go to São Paulo?
No.
How about Rio?
Want to go to a county?
No, thanks.
I don't want to go to Rio.
You may dress up a little bit.
I can just see you for real.
Oh, sure.
That is the one in my house.
I'll just go there.
You're very modest.
You're smart.
You're smart.
You're right.
You can go there.
You can go there.
Now, in addition, Senator McCain, thanks for the interview.
I can honestly say I prepared my entire life for this moment.
Are you being sarcastic?
The idea.
What?
The idea.
I didn't say those words.
They weren't even words.
Say that again.
The sounds they came out of you.
Never mind.
I'm blessed with such personal greatness.
History has anointed me to save my country in its hour of need.
Okay.
Whatever.
How long do you want to keep the troops in Iraq?
I don't think Americans are concerned if we're there for a hundred years or a thousand years or ten thousand years.
And what about Iran?
I'm very confident that we're going to...
...murand.
Ha ha ha.
Fantastic.
Okay.
We're going to cut to commercial here.
I will never surrender and wait for white flag to surrender.
I will never do it.
Dude, you're not surrendering.
We're just going to go to commercial.
I will never do it.
You're totally crazy, aren't you?
I am committed to it.
In suffocation, we'll be right back.
I'm a prince.
I'm a prince.
I'm a prince.
I'm a prince.
I'm a prince.
I'm a prince.
I'm a prince.
I'm a prince.
I'm a prince.
So anyways, 132QM.
I mean, you know, the idea of a crazy president.
Why not continue, right?
Now, how come I'm getting this week's schedule already?
It's this week's schedule.
So there must have been a change.
Oh, you're...
You know something?
If you could hear the sound quality of your voice.
So...
The...
The...
The city rating in the like...
What can I say?
It's because of the webinar, right?
I'm sure.
I'm under the...
I'm under it.
Oh, it sounds bad.
It sounds like, um...
Like, you know, a pitted speaker.
And a blown speaker sounds like...
That's where you sound.
Hey, hey, hey.
And the level seems really normal.
Maybe Chris Pyt is Chris the lair?
I'm sorry.
Why is that?
Well, I figured, you know, just wait out and leave it to...
I think we're going to need to reset or something like that.
I mean, I can hear you, but it sounds...
Or we need to recess.
Yeah, let's have recess for about 20 minutes.
I'm leaving today at 135.
And then Joe can come in and say,
How come Neil left today?
You know, whoa!
Well, what's the change on this schedule that we had to make a big cynus about?
What's that?
I see a board op change or something here.
A couple of John Lindor instead of the beast or whatever.
But what?
So what's, uh...
What's the deal, Slimuel?
Don't out of care.
The...
The...
Whatever happened down there, man.
On your end, on the SNL near its span.
You're on your...
Now, can you reset it?
I can go reset it, you understand?
You know, we lose your connection when you do that.
I beg your pardon?
We lose you when we do that.
When we do that.
You go out, you can't talk.
I have to play music or something.
Or read the schedule.
Oh, in other words, when you were...
Oh, I see.
It's a two-way thing.
So in other words, you can't talk and fill it only taste like ten seconds.
I was just saying.
Yeah.
We lose...
I should shut up.
Well, we can reset it, but we lose you while that happens.
We're gonna have to reset it.
I'm telling you, you found...
Go, go, go, go, go.
We set the road test more so than ever.
Is he resetting it?
He's going to reset it.
Okay.
I'll give you a second.
We'll let you know when we're back, okay?
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Well, at the moment, a silent meditation,
but he's having school.
And he can't have a school prayer, but we have to do something
to promote God and clergy.
I didn't mean to know I'll come back.
Well, I was very productive today while you came here.
We did my my space a little bit.
New pictures up there.
For us front guests.
Misaki and Mindy Kim from Cocoa, Martha.
New pictures of Martha.
Mm, Martha.
You back here?
You're back, but you're still sound bad.
All right.
What can I do?
Well, it's everything that didn't happen earlier.
Indeed.
Should I reset mine again?
If you want.
I mean, you sound like you're under, um, what?
Water?
No, not underwater.
Like you're under some kind of like a foam mattress or something.
Like you're buried underneath it.
Oh, like that.
Maybe I am.
Maybe you're under a muffler.
Should I be out there?
It feels some good time.
Fine.
Whatever.
Go for it.
I want to do it.
Big trash.
I don't think it's on this end, though, but I'll try it.
I think it's the line.
Do I sound queer, actually?
You sound queer, but very clear.
Yes.
I think it's the line because of the weather.
That's just something that's going to be happening today.
Oh, but in case I don't want to posky with it then.
All right.
I'll lose you all together.
I won't know if I'm on.
That's right.
I have to clog you again in my brain.
And my cross-me-40 center.
I don't know.
Yeah, you don't want to do that.
I sure as hell don't want to do that.
I'm going to get those glasses fixed today.
I'm going to get a new arm on my glasses.
What do you call those?
That's what I always call.
A leg.
A what?
The legs.
Legs?
Uh-huh.
Are you a crazy person or what?
Uh-huh.
You might be right.
Glasses have legs.
No, it's not what they're called.
I never heard that in my life.
Legs?
I don't know.
I'm taking his word for it.
You're not.
I'm going to check out the radar.
Okay.
All right.
I mean, something's going to be.
Why?
I'm googling the parts of glasses for checking out the radar.
Okay, you go ahead and I'll check out the radar.
Here's the image from Miami.
Market, the down 50 by the way.
Oh, look at that.
There's some rain.
An offshore man.
I must be the stuff that blew through before.
Let's put the loop on here.
Let's do the loopty loop.
Let's loop it, baby.
Yeah, all the heavy duty stuff ran through there.
It's offshore.
It's by like the Bahamas now.
Mm-hmm.
And the way down by the keys, man, we really weighed out.
Well, soft days.
Pretty heavy duty, too.
But it's still, but most of the heavy duty stuff is gone.
And once it's gone, it don't turn around and come back.
It's gone.
But it only something must have happened.
And maybe we took a lightning strike again.
Maybe Luke Christie will do lightning strikes.
Maybe we took a lightning strike.
I don't know.
I think Chris made me crank up the level a little bit
to compensate for the fact that you sound...
Err.
There you go.
He still sound like that, but at least I can hear it now.
Or I could crank this up and get some loopty back on.
Or we could just...
Oh, he just...
He just...
He just...
He just...
He just...
He just...
He just...
He just...
Oh, he was there, wasn't he?
Yeah, there's something definitely screwed up in the line.
Did you hear that?
No, I didn't hear it.
What?
I didn't hear it.
You didn't.
I did.
Because it's coming from there.
Just.
Boy.
Anyway, let's get back to David Hernandez.
You know, I really missed my chance because last night it was on
and I was watching the Elisha Returns.
I couldn't have been watching the American Idol.
Like millions of other...
Yeah.
No.
No.
Oh, you're still...
You know something I am going to tape this.
I'm going to play it back to you.
All right.
So you can hear me.
Let me say something.
Yeah, go ahead.
Speak.
To be or not to be, that is the question whether it is noble in the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows about rageous fortune or to take arms against the
ac
Okay.
I will in a second.
Oh.
But, rewind.
Rewind.
Rewind, you idiot.
Here we go.
I think.
Speak.
To be or not to be that.
Oh, wow.
That's brutal.
Mind to suffer the slings and arrows about rageous fortune or to take arms against the
acouple.
See, that's what I'm hearing on this end.
And you're like, oh, how come he's good?
Because that's what I'm hearing.
It doesn't sound like that over here.
What do you mean by that?
In other words, it's not on the ear like that?
Correct.
It's just the return going back to you.
Well, the return is a F-duck man.
The return is really bad.
But again, we're almost done.
We only have twenty-two minutes to go.
Assuming that the group there can get the next show on the corner of the jerk.
It's a great attempt.
I'm not going to say anything.
I'm not going to say anything.

Oh my God.
You're free.
He had the look in fact that people
actually made pretty good money here.
Brian said.
A spokesperson for the show
to climb MTV News' request for comment
on the report.
But first and
close to the show, he's not authorized
to comment publicly.
And that's not to be identified
to all APO yesterday.
That the show's got no pants to remove.
Hey, Hernandez from the competition.
Brian can be reached for further comment
at press time, but he told the AP
that Hernandez worked at Dixt steadily for three years
until September 30th.
Well, after he auditioned for I don't send
he went to live 30th.
Brian said that Hernandez did not renew his licensing
with the state, which is why he hasn't performed
at Dixt since that date.
You have to have a license to be a stripper.
Yes, can I?
For you sound, if you could, what do you hear it?
Sorry.
I did.
The end of the thing is the last segment, man.
It's something important to say too,
as soon as you're done with that hazard,
I'll have that gay guy.
Go ahead.
The part of the frame that extend over and or
behind the ears to help hold the frame
in place or called these herpals.
The temples?
There are skull temples for most popular kind.
Comfort cable temples, riding bow temples,
spring hinged temples, and the library
or paddle temples, which are not for you
because those are the straight ones.
Straight temples?
Yes.
I'm ready to go to the temple myself.
The alcohol-free club Dixt was named the best game
made review in 2004 by the Finnish Newtoms,
which said the cabaret's dancers fit a
flurry of fantasy rules, performing as sailors,
construction workers, cowboys and whatever else
are the best vehicles they're fancy.
It says here.
Tickles they're all for a fancy what?
Hey, sailor.
Yeah.
Oh, you beat me to it.
Hey, sailor.
I must have played already, you know,
maybe effort to get there.
Your powers are equal, man.
For you sound really bad.
I think it should lead.
Why?
I think I should lead.
I'm out of my try to re-re-
Stop, no.
Don't try to re-jigger it.
Come on, Ed.
It'll waste time.
I want to re-jigger it.
Go figure.
Go Hernandez has never discussed
this stripping past on the show.
Rumors of his past were posted on the vote
for the worst.com last week,
including images of a barely clothed,
or, I think, pronounced as working as a bartender
at the gay club, burn.
Burn, baby.
Burn.
It was like moss to a flame vote for the worst
founder Dave Della Terza told AP of the rumor.
As soon as I posted that, we started getting
10, 20 letters every single day from saying,
uh, yeah, he's a stripper in Phoenix.
Grind told the AP that the idol
contested never sang at Dix,
and then he now believes Hernandez stopped working
at the club because of his idol connection.
After getting high marks on the judges'
last two difers, rendition of the temptations,
Papa was a rolling stone.
Hernandez was, was slighted a performance-
last night for a shot making to the top club.
I don't really get in or not.
Oh my God.
Did he get in?
Who else could press?
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm just, I'm asking how loud.
That's a loud, loud.
Really?
Well, I'll ask somebody to watch that show.
Yeah, that's not a loud.
How loud.
Maybe, uh, Bill, what's his name?
What's his name?
That's the, uh, loud.
Tech?
Bill, no.
Was that his name, Bill Tech?
Yes.
Bill Drek?
Yes.
Or does his live drek walk in a minute?
I know that we got Todd Drek.
Is he still working there?
Yes.
He hasn't been anywhere near the show,
and, uh, oh my God, since before Jesus
was a little infant, and you know something?
That's a good thing.
That's a good thing, too.
Let's keep it that way.
And you want to know why, because you don't have a screw
anoron anymore to come in holding his, uh, holding her
coat tails.
Oh, gee, would you please do this spot for Todd?
You know, it's a piece of crap, but would you please do it?
Remember those days?
I've sure do.
I always had to come in powering behind her,
because she was scared to death of me.
And I'm, uh, what kind of a jerk is scared of me, okay?
A lot of people are.
Why is that?
I would run the acid about me,
I'd never saw such a soft person in this whole life.
Right?
Such an old mama-la?
No, I'm standing there.
I'm breaking up.
That's because my, you know,
don't cry.
My post-nasal drip.
Dennis Quessettich may not be a presidential contender,
but he's still under among his Cleveland constituents,
little Dennis.
The liberal Ohio politician got 50% of the vote
in a five-way Democratic congressional primary yesterday,
beating back critics who said he ignored
business at home to travel to country in his silly
quest to be president.
The six-term incumbent, 61-old face former state representative,
Jim Trackis, who won 80% of Republican votes cast in the
state, Northeast Ohio District.
He joins a parade of incumbents returning challengers and
state lawmakers who went in November's election thought
we answered his victories.
Around Paul, one in Texas again, by the way.
And I know you're afraid of Ron Paul.
Are you scared of him?
Oh, yeah, very, very.
Me too.
Fear of afraid.
Yeah, he scares the hell out of me.
Not as much as my cufflaborary though,
because he's a, he's crazed you then McCain.
If that's possible.
Well, tomorrow's going to be plus two, maybe 36.
Maybe some of this crap is going to melt.
Oh my god.
I'd go for a good patty melt right now.
I think that's what I'm going to have for a lunch today.
That's so good.
Have a patty cake for dessert.
No, no patty cake, patty melt.
And did I mention on the air,
or did I just say off the air?
Red lobster was off the air.
Oh, I didn't say it on the air,
that I wanted to be.
You've been there several times,
it was always very good,
but that's because that were the same thing every time.
But I had some crab cakes the other day,
and Paco had the lobster.
I mean, it was nasty.
The time child was great.
It's a guy for it.
I was good as a window of the oyster house, but then again,
I guess they're not going to reopen for me, huh?
Yes, sir.
Princess spaghetti house in Boston,
I wish they would reopen for me.
Man, oh man.
You talk of a place with great food Boston.
You've ever been there? No.
No.
Chris has been there.
No.
Oh, no.
Nothing, yes.
Not to the place.
And maybe that's where you parked up.
That's what I got fat.
Early 60s, baby, after I got kicked out of college
for not attending class,
because I was busy sleeping after
a drink and then I'm right to borrow all night.
And I went off to Boston
and parked up, man.
I went from about $155 to $212,
a year and a half.
And do I regret it?
No.
It was damn good.
Every bit of it, the Brigham's ice cream in the
Princess spaghetti house and the Joannemos
and the great grinders, sub sandwiches.
Mmm.
What's out of business restaurant?
You missed the most.
That's our poll.
Today, our second poll of the day.
425.
Now, so I guess we got over a thousand
as we started with about a thousand.
And we got the other poll.
Right.
And we got 98.
So we got 1100.
So we got over 1,500 total.
That's pretty good.
That is smoking, baby.
That's more votes on the poll than
food he got in seven months.
In seven years.
Well, I can't wait to Friday to see how good he's doing.
Of course, we don't get the houries and the trends.
But nevertheless, he's doing squat.
The country out there imagines your mind, then.
I'm trying to let it.
What's out of business restaurant?
You missed the most.
The most long is 56.
The Sizzler 39.
Wolfies 38, where the waitress is used to tear off their apron.
I'm out of here.
This is a crazy place.
I'm out of here.
I would take the silverware and heave it, looking against the wall and run out.
Wolfies 38.
Taco B with 33.
Beef Fake Charlie's 24.
The England Oyster has 24.
Korky's 20.
Wags 19.
The black anus has got 18.

They had good winners, but boy, a schmootsie place, man.
Schmootsie.
Sambo's 8.
Bojangles 8.
Unicorn 7.
The Studio 5.
Finally, the start and make move.
Vito's pizza, four-year steakhouse, four needles on Alton Road 4.
It's had four votes ever since we started.
You have to be really ancient to remember needles.
Rudy's 3.
The ones in the tree.
But we've got a lot of money, don't we?
Villabelli 3.
Rocky Gwachiani's 3.
Size Rivergate 3.
Piccolo's 3.
Joe Sockin's Gold Coast is that up here.
And the crystal does that's a legendary place.
Thanks for, by the way, Standle 2 o'clockers.
That was really whitey.
Hey, welcome.
Good luck with your thing.
The Sizzlin' 2.
The clock 2.
Mary's 2.
Hungry and Charter 2.
One for Luther's barbecue, figuros, the turf pub,
Gigi's and Prince Hamlet, and none.
Zipety Duda for Tyler's, the painted horse, and sporting grooves.
Almost brings a tear to my eye.
So when's the Wayne reopening the Royal Castle?
The biggest name.
The best.
The final plan is no-one.
The show's the best.
I'm going to get my bally.
You am the sports leader.
It's very high on Miami Towns.
And white six o'clock WQA.
Now the good boys pack their gold.
If you can Tyler's a daughter of the pack two gold.
He's a funny guy, but it goes in blue.
Oh, when you make them a bag, hit the driver's seat.
Will it be a job?
A job?
A job?
That's an easy way.
Take your clothes off, Gigi.
I'm going to hold you in town, but I can't do much things.
Take it up a big pool with all this fun.
You only buy the straight will get you a little better at that.
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
Let's take it down.
The best.
The handle will be fat guy.
She know how to make the ball inside.
That can take you to the shower now.
We need to stick like on the towel.
Oh, wow.
Oh, wow.
Hey, oh, wow.
That's an easy way.
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
The biggest names of the best colors.
I am a tortulante.
