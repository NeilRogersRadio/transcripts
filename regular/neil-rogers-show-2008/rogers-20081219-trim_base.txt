happy Friday. It's happy Chanukah to you. That's what? Tomorrow night Sunday night. Sunday night?
Yes. Yes. Mahrukhatat. I drink a lot of Mogen David. It'll make God happy. He likes
Mogen David better than Manor Shevets. Does he? Mogen David. And then we got Christmas coming on
what? Wednesday? Thursday. Thursday. Thursday. Well, Christmas Eve, Wednesday night. Thursday is
Christmas day. And the Goyang are going to be going crazy. It sounds really, really... Yay!
Anyway, what do we got for the schedule today? We got the big Oat Dolphin Camp in two. And then we got
the Curtis for the Mad Dog, a quarter to X sunrise, four to seven. No Mad Dog, he is taking a lot of
days off. Lots of... and more power to him. Seven till whatever till when it's over. St. Thomas
Aquinas in Lakeland in the 5A High School Championship game. Wow! Woo! There ought to be a tremendous
audience for that. Then the V-staff to that to 11 o'clock and then Greg Lykins. Greg don't like his
from 11 to 1. That's our award-winning lineup here at QAM. I've got one of the funniest emails
coming yesterday at 3.47 pm. I'll get to in a second though. Trish Cabibbo, though,
she requested Rita Book. That's why I just played it. She says, sorry, no complaints or critiques.
Here I just wanted to wish you a very happy winter solstice and say, thanks for keeping us all
entertained for hours today. George, have a great vacation. Thank you. Thank you. Especially when
you gasped my imagination at the things Neil said. Trish Cabibbo, thanks Trish Cabibbo and
his Cabibbo. Here comes one of the greatest emails ever. Talk about covering your ass ahead of time.
Wow! You guys across the street really cracked me up. They've been doing this ever since they came
on the air. The techet, techet, techet, techet, techet, they've been trying to talk themselves in a success.
That's what they want to do. They talk them in and let me just tell you this right now. And this
is from the bottom of my part, right from my deep inside my... Correct them. There's only one number
that really counts. Although I like a good number when I see one and I like a good number even
better when I get to do one, which ain't very often anymore. But anyway, the number is on my paycheck
twice a month. That's the number I care about. All these other numbers and void, you know,
how can people lie so bad? That's what cracks me up. Anyway, here this came in yesterday afternoon.
From Phil Ark, I know you're probably going to bash your competition based on the ratings that come
out tomorrow. Now, how does he know that? They're going to be good or bad or what? This is like,
this is cutting your losses. That's right. What's all about? However, maybe you should reconsider based
on the information I'm going to give you. 790, we launched its website this week. Oh, they relaunched
their website. And along with it, they relaunched a George Sennano poll. Now, I know this doesn't threaten
you, but considered that on the day when you had the Bush shoe throwing poll, he had the same
poll. Well, guess what, Phil? We never had any poll about the Bush shoe throwing. What?
On the day when you had it, he had the same poll. Well, we never had it. And he received 50,000
votes while you struggled to get 500,000 to a thousand a day. He's consistently got well in the
20 to 50,000 range all week. Let me tell you this right now. And you can take it right to the bank.
There ain't nobody in this market that's getting 10,000, 50,000 that's getting thousands and thousands
of votes on no poll. Trust me when I tell you. Anybody, hey, guess what? We got four million
votes on our poll today already. Anybody can sit down and make up some kind of a stupid number.
So this is either the Democrats' street, which is most likely, or one of their sicker fans who
believes the crap that they spew on the year. The polls don't necessarily mean that his audience is
this much bigger than yours, but neither does it mean that you're by beating him on arbitrage,
your audience is bigger than his. Let me say it again, the only thing I got that's bigger than his,
much, much, much, much, much bigger than his. And oh, it's not what you're thinking. It's that paycheck,
much, much bigger. And this really cracks me up. That here we go again, complains in critiques.
You're a stubborn old bastard. I love you, but you have five more years of this. So reconsider
going back to your old formats. My loyalty to your show is fading. My loyalty to your show is fading.
Bye-bye. Wait, what are we going to do? No, don't. Bye, bye, bye. Yeah.
There's nothing better than people who keep threatening. They're going to leave. Oh, we're going to
leave. We're going to turn it off. We're just about reaching for the dial right now to goodbye.
My loyalty to your show, in addition to which we consider going back to your old formats. Now,
maybe because I'm old and senile, my Alzheimer's is kicking in. Maybe somebody needs to remind me what
the old formats were, other than playing bits that we're never going to be able to play again.
The funny stuff, other than that, I'd like to know what was different. The fact we took more
phone calls. I'm your friend. Well, there's a reason we don't take a whole lot of. Might take a few.
I have no problem with what it is now. Within the constraints of what we're limited to,
this is what the show is. Take it or leave it. The price is right. Complaints and critiques. You can
wipe your ass with them. Okay. I hear that George Zanato got 40 billion votes on the poll over
there. They've reached. They relaunched their website. They've relaunched it. I looked at it this
morning before the show. It's a piece of turd. Yeah. And I hate to tell this emailer.
Yes. Their polls don't actually give the total numbers. No, of course not. Nobody else gives the
number on the air. Our polls don't show the number either. Do they? Yes. Yes. Oh, they do.
Right on how do you like that? We're the ones. We are the only ones that show it to you and the
poll too. You want to see our poll? Look at that. Oh, go purple. Gross. That's right. There it is
right now. The new poll. It shows 68 votes. 60. Whatever the hell it is. We are the only show that has
a poll that shows you how many votes we get. We're not going to sit here and lie to you. We had
a thousand and two votes on the one from yesterday. So I changed it to the new one. And you know
something just out of curiosity with this fake email. I looked back into the history. You know,
like three years ago, four years back when we were kicking ass with juggernaut always number one by a
mile. And we didn't have any more votes on the poll then that we do now. This is a crazy
person or a course that's probably one of those people across the street. Maybe two gods.
Maybe George sit on his boyfriend. Who knows? Oh, he's getting 40 billion votes on the
poll. Enough that that means he's got that much bigger. You know something. Let me say it again.
These people are in a dream world. They're trying to they're trying to wave a magic wand and create
this mythical audience that they never had. They never will have. And going to happen.
And let me say it again. If they have four million votes on their poll, what do I give a flying
crap about it for? Who cares? When payday comes twice a month, I'd like to match George
Siddonner's paycheck or any of the other losers over there. I mean yesterday we had the thing about
Le Bastard gets making 65 grand a year and admits it on the year. Wasn't that the number? Okay.
65 or 75 grand. I think it was 65. I think it was 65. What? I think it was 65 or 65 grand a year. And
this is a big shot with his five-year over there in the afternoon. That's what they're paying him.
If I was him, I'd be embarrassed for people to know what I was making.
Oh no, we're kicking you guys ass. Well the numbers where are the numbers already? Who's bringing them in?
Lee? Flea? Don't know. Don't know. We'll see. Today is the trend day and it's 11 after the hour.
Already, there should be there should be numbers coming across my machine right now.
No? No. Well why not? Snow like a mother here, man. It's really just blizzard conditions.
A white out. Much, much, much, too bad weather for me to be working today.
Yeah, that's right. Oh yeah. Way too bad. All right, let's take a look at the result from yesterday's
pool. We only had a thousand and two votes. They got 40,000 across the street just this hour.
Other than dumb rude or no speaking English, I found South Americans generally speaking to be
hostile 298. Loud mouth 94 short tempered 87. Attention deficit is ordered 84 pretentious 65.
Lazy 56. That's us. That's our new model here. Lung logo. Lazy 56. We're mailing it in and you
better like it or not. Beautiful 49. Snobby 49. Vulgar 48. Sloppy Lee dressed 43. Perfect. We're near
to a 36 out of shape 32. Accentraint 28. Ugly 19 and smelly. Mm. Fet 12.
Thousand two votes on our award winning pool yesterday.
Not 80 million. Not 70 million. Not 25. Pretty. Only 2002.
No portion of this program may be reproduced to possibly best written permission of WTOM
and contested with incoherent. No. It's that 12 right day you best.
So how's those numbers coming? What they're getting on right now. Yeah, open. I think they're making
them up like your cross. We got an 80 share. That's right. You can stick them.
Oh, let's have lunch at Skipper's table at schoolcraft and middle belfer in that vicinity where
the hole was on Merrimon Road. What do you say? All right. 1018 at 560 WQM. Those numbers may be
a percolating in any second now. Let me know when somebody comes flying in the door.
Because lately it's been a lot of people flying out the door. Right? Here's today's pool. We've got
40 million votes on it already. Jesus. We're really a kick an ass. We got 90 votes. What would you
do? Or what? No, I'm sorry. What would you or what do you miss the most? It's poorly worded.
But it's a good pool from one of our listeners. Somebody different for a change.
Full service gas stations. I added it on there. It's number one. Did I add that on there before
the show? Tommy? Yes. 19 records. Thursday 12. This jockey's nine. That's what I voted before. I
said. One telephone operator six. Bookstores five. US Postal Service four. Porn Actress four.
Drummer is three. Repair guys three. Turn tables. Two BCRs two. PIMPS. Displaced by the cell phone in
the web too. Stockbrokers two. One a piece for a wired telco's travel agencies. Recording industry
and vacuum tubes and bank tellers vacuum tubes. And none yet for code act and other film stock makers.
Film cameras printing press makers. Brow shop and conventional watch makers. Oh, there's a zillion
choices on here. I bet you we get 45 million votes. There's so many choices on this boy. Thank
no book publishing. Tall collectors. Slaid by the easy past. Stenographers print and cinematic
porn. Career Messenger services. Video stores. Gazette and Reel to Reel Recorders. Book Finder's
yellow pages. Slide rules. Type setting and typewriters. They have none. Zero. They've got the big.
Nothing. Well, so how those numbers come in any but I got them in my hand sticking them
in the facts machine right now. Oh, the printer sucks. So some of the stuff that you see written
in by hand just the other call letters and stuff is an attempt to correct for the printer.
What are you saying? The printer blows. Yeah, you'll see when you get it. Oh, no, don't tell me
this is going to be one of those we're going to have to like decipher it. Well, let's make up some
numbers like they do across the street. We had a 98 chair. All right. It isn't it isn't the numbers
that got messed up. It's the station along the left side where the call letters are. So some
other call letters are handwritten and. Oh, and who wrote them? Mm-hmm. Lee. I don't know. Oh,
that's a good idea. Let's take the good numbers and then we'll put our phones next to the
table. I'll do a little quickly. That's this is a new way we're going to report the ratings.
Here's one from a poor poor poor.
It says I was listening to those D bags at 790 and La Bastard was ripping you about your
phony ratings and how you suck, etc. We don't lie about the ratings or about our pay or about
anything else on this or about our poor result. We put it right there on the website for everybody
to see read it in week Danny boy. In fact, I'll be more than happy to send you a copy my next
paycheck and you can read that in week loser ripping me about my phony ratings. See anybody can
get like a phony a few wired diaries get a phony trend or a phony book. Anybody can do that.
Rating success is over a long period of time. Now let me just ask you collectively. Do I have
something to prove about ratings in this market? No, I don't think so Danny boy. The word consistency
comes to mind. That's correct. And of course since Jolly Jovelle has come along we've been consistent
consistently week. The whole radio station we've have vanished. But keep talking about me over
there because I seem to be the number one topic conversation. I need all the publicity I can get
because I sure don't get any here. Here's the first page. All right. Many 18 plus Monday through
Sunday. CMQ FAM A continues being number one. No speaking English. No speaking English.
Hot is number two. Same as last trend. Radio Mambe is number three. They moved up a little bit.
This is many 18 plus and includes all the old old cigar smoking. Domino playing Julio's W.O.D. is
number four up from a time for seven. Oh that's bad news for us. That means this is probably a real
right wing. Now it must be the morning show must be Jimmy Cifilis. Now the food is gone. Jimmy
Cifiliti must have put him over the top. They went from a three eight up to a four six. Wow.
I.O.D. kicking ass. Radio Mambe is number five. Radio Ritmo is number six. No speaking English.
Life is number seven and W.E.D. is number eight. We're certain not on the first page of the station.
This is men for the entire week. Power is number nine. Where the hell are we? Q.A.M. 11th with a 2.7.
Same 2.7. Same numbers we had in the last round. Magic, tragic. Where the hell is Waxi? Where's Waxi?
Oh no down to a 1.9. Oh you're probably going to rip that for me. Making that up again. Yeah.
My phony rating. These aren't mine. This is the station. 2.7 for us. 1.9 for them for the week.
Many 18 plus and dropping from 19th to 21st. We were number what were we? Number 11 tied for 11th with
the smegma and they've got lots of smegma on their number. They're down to number 21. Oh mother
and the wins scare America in this trend had a 1.4. Is this tell your right wingers? Not good for
this show. I bet you we take it up the old earlobe. WNMA showed up there. 0.9. What's the point?
27. I always think that that's not it. Mr. Negro station doesn't show it all. WNMA,
NMA, NMA, NMA, NMA, NMA, whatever it is. The motivation station. They can't motivate anybody to
listen or to at least write it down. Who came in last? I can't read it. W. What is it?
You're right. It's a bad coffee. I can't even read it. Wow. Double.
Let's take a look at the morning. 6 to 10 a.m. Men. Hot 105. Number 16.5. Wacky.
Radio Mambi. No speaking English is number two with a 5.9 share. Radio Ritmo number three.
No speaking English. Radio Amor. No speaking English. Number four. QBAAM. No speaking English. Number five.
CMQ FAMA. No speaking English. Number six. Big tied for six. Boy, they sure took a hit.
They took a bad bad hit. QAM number 12 with a 2.9 down from a three share.
IOD had was eight with a 3.5. And we're going to hell his Wacky in the morning. Where's the guy with the big mouth?
1.9. A 1.0 something. Oh my god. Whoa. A 1.9 down from a two share and a 1.8 though back in the summer in the book.
Tied for 19th. That a boy said you're kicking ass. You're doing it.
But they restructure. They revamp the website. Oh my god. I in Zinamore is out of point eight.
A 0.8. What's the point? Oh, that's bad. What the hell I do with my stapler? Oh, there it is.
I stapled it to my foot. Middays. Look at that. CMQ FAMA. They had a 10.4 in the previous trend.
Now there's still number one with a 9.7. Lots and lots and lots of wire diaries at CMQ FAM.
IOD number two in middays. Oh, this is all rush. What, what, what, what, what did they do in the morning?
Did I skip over that? How did Jimmy Cifalitic affect their number? IOD.
They're not on the first page. They went from a two eight to a three five.
Nice going, Jimmy. Keep that right wing propaganda going. They got her going.
But they went zooming up to number two in midday. A 6.9.
Then back and lots of other direct rush. Where the hell are we? Are we on the eighth page?
Oh, we're out to nine down from a 3.4. Tied for 10th.
Where's Waxi here in midday? I don't see him on the second page.
Oh, 1.9 hanging onto that same number.
Hanging onto the same number that they had in the morning.
Oh, 1.9. At least they're consistent. They may not be good, but they're consistent.
And they've got a lot of hits on that website page.
What a vote. The best talent. You're a new logist.
Fortlegil 560 QAM. The fourth leader.
The biggest names. The best talent. It's the mad dog. Jim Manditz.
Afternoons 4 to 7. Sports radio 560 QAM. The sports leader.
It's Friday, you bastard.
I see the Lego white.
Chris John.
About the Jews and gay homos.
How I'd love to bury those crimes.
Killing fairies.
Who don't know the Bible like I know.
I see them like a white Christian.
And how we all must think and act alike and not to think whenever it's appropriate.
Yes, wouldn't it be wonderful if everybody in the world was white and Christian
and looked the same and said the same things.
Boring, I don't think so.
No, to me, that would be paradise and the republican ways.
I see things like a white Christian.
And how we all must think alive.
Absolutely all the games black and yet long must die.
Until everybody is Christian and white.
We're sure kicking ass. I'll tell you that our own.
You see how the attrition kicks in?
Yep.
Dropping and dropping and dropping and dropping.
But let's see before we get to afternoon, by the way,
LeBaster had kicked a mad dog again.
Asked.
Let's see, what was the one about?
Oh, yeah, here it is from the fake Jimmy Cifalus.
I got a three five.
We're kicking your ass in the midday.
You have a two nine.
Sorry.
I have to break the news to Jimmy Cifalus,
but you're on in the morning.
I'm on the midday.
He got a three five Jimmy Cifalini.
He got a three five.
Yeah, of course, in the midday,
wasn't they have like a 98 year, six, two?
I don't know.
Yeah, they were number two in midday.
Rush.
And of course, Glenn Beck.
It was strictly a right wing book.
Trend.
Let me take a puke at it.
Didn't I tell you that?
As soon as I saw the first number come down.
Right wing.
I would be six nine in midday.
From a five three six nine.
Number two.
Well, good for them.
And good for you too, Jimmy.
You blow your pathetic.
Okay, three to seven PM.
Hot 105 number one.
Still, they're always number one.
W-I-V-D number two.
See that six point two.
I-O-D, right wing.
All the right wing thing.
They just nailed them right across the board.
In fact, other day parts got six shares.
Jimmy Cifalini, you only got a three five.
Not so great.
Not so good.
Nished goods.
Now, let's see.
Aradi Walmora, Radeo Ritmo,
No speaking English, CMQFA, M-A-E-D-R.
Waxi was number nine in the afternoon.
With a three point two.
Down from eight, eighth and three point four in the last round.
But nevertheless, kicked our ass.
Bad.
H-D-R magic.
The coast, smegma, kiss, wins.
Scare America.
They don't do anything.
And if you think they don't do anything, wow.
Afternoons, we derr up to a tie for the first time.
And then we're going to go for 19th with a two two.
Mad dogs weren't a two two.
What am I going to say about that?
Nothing.
I have a feeling that because weed went down and he went down,
I think that two to four must have gone down.
Yel.
You know what I'm saying?
Because our number is 10 to three.
And his number is three to seven.
So the two hours of slap over of two to four in there,
that would be really bad if the big O did worse than what preceded him.
The jerk show.
That would be really, really bad.
It wouldn't be really rock solid.
Would it?
Seven of midnight.
Anybody care about that?
But I got it anyway.
And it's Friday.
It's the day before Hanukkah and just days before Christmas.
Well, what are you sending me, by the way?
The pages are just puking through there.
The 2554.
Oh, God.
And then we have to scrapily those.
Yes.
Well, I'll just make some of that.
Read it to the formula.
Oh, for example, wait a minute.
There's the Jimmy Cifilis email on the floor.
Yeah, I got a three five in a way, Jimmy.
You're a great broadcast, you're a real Nazi.
La Bastard said George Sedano had 18,761 votes on his poll.
And you had 531, but they don't verify stuff.
They just say it and pretend it's true.
That's right.
They just make it up.
18,000 votes, my ass.
He wouldn't get 18,000 votes on that poll in six months.
Oh, no.
You're wrong, Neil.
You're wrong.
Last time I checked we had a three something in midday.
I got to put more paper in there.
And they had a one nine.
Oh, one nine.
What?
I'm saying I was told by a source in the building that worked over there before.
Yes.
That the 65 grand is a joke and that he's close up to 200.
Yeah.
So no, I'm just saying to you know, clear up his lies.
Close to 200 grand?
Yeah.
Wow.
Big bucks there.
I'm really jealous, La Bastard.
Let me put some more paper in my machine, man.
Okay.
Oh, God.
Okay.
Here we go.
Seven of midnight.
EDR number one.
This is always fun when we look at these numbers because we're not on the first page.
We aren't on the second page.
WIOD at night, 2.4.
They went down at night.
That's the only day part they went down.
What do they got on at night?
Some Nazi bastards.
I'm sure.
Seven of midnight on the third page.
Are we on here?
Waxie, a 1.2.
That's with a lot of marlins in there too.
This is September, October and November.
So September, marlins.
You can only imagine what October and November must have been at 1.2.
They beat us.
No, they're tied with us.
Tied for 21st.
All right.
Night time, 8th or right time.
For listening to this crap.
Wow.
Woo.
Talk about heavy duty.
That really blows.
And this trend really blows.
But you know what?
Nobody cares.
So this stick that was over there.
That's it.
And I speak pile and.
Mosie Raylon.
How about adding payphones on the poll?
Kevin says you want to put payphones on there?
That's a good one.
Okay.
Is it on there?
I think it is.
Is it on?
Well put it on several times.
It'll get a lot more votes than we can catch up to a Jorge Siddano.
All right.
I would like to challenge them right now to put the, of course,
you can make the number read anything you want.
Right.
At the time when who was filling in?
Zach.
Zach.
Zach filled in.
We had Eric put a million votes on the pool.
He can put any number under you want.
Right.
And then like a couple days later we had Josh and he was jealous.
So we had two million that day.
Yeah, that's right.
We had two million votes on the pool.
Eric can make the number read anything we want.
And so can they.
So even if they displayed it on there,
being the liars that they are,
they got a one nine in morning and midday, a one nine.
And a bachelor wins in the afternoon as usual with this 3.2,
which still ain't nothing to write home about.
Where's those 2554s if I got them?
Oh, I got them.
Oh boy.
If there is good as the MN 18 plus, I'll pass on that.
Here's the whole week.
Persons 2554 men and women, which we don't have any women.
We got a few, but not too many.
Let's see.
W-I-O-D 2.7.
Not so great.
Not so great overall.
2554.
Maybe they had a lot of old right wingers.
I have no idea.
Q-A-M 1.7.
That's not from 1.8 in the last trend.
But up from a 1.6 in the summer book.
Waxy right on our tail with a 1.3.
Wow.
Really, really lame.
Put them both together and you still have a craft number.
Oh, but if we just had more sports stations,
Neil will really increase the, uh,
bring a lot more people to sports talk radio.
Sports talk radio is done.
Let's see.
6 to 10 a.m.
What do we got?
Persons 2554.
Are we on the first page?
How one of five is number one?
W-A-M-R.
Radio.
Amor is number two.
Radio member Melody Amor by the Sean Sond.
What was it?
Sean Sond Amor by the, uh, what was it?
Yes.
Who did that?
Sean Sond Amor.
Left and up and up.
Well anyway.
I don't know.
We'll figure it out.
Don't worry about it.
It's a good song.
I-O-D in the morning.
Oh my god.
Jimmy's got a 2-2.
They went from a 2.0 to a 2.2 time for 15th in the morning.
A 2-2.
You'd look cute in a 2-2, Jimmy.
You're fairie.
It would be the first time.
I'm sure Q-A-M from a 1.9 down to a 1.8.
Number 20.
Which means in men about a 3.5, 3.6.
I don't see what.
You don't see what?
I don't see what.
It's not about how he just leaned on his mic.
Oh, 6.
Oh, of course, said the kid.
And that 1.9 in the morning and man.
Oh my god.
That, you know what?
If I had that, I would just, I'd get in the car right now and head for New York.
I would head for the George Washington Bridge, find William Holden, join hands and jump.
Midday's 10 to 3.
This is not going to be good.
Life is number one with an 8.0.
Is there more stuff coming or what?
My thing just beeped.
I said everything I was sending.
Oh, good.
Radio on more.
Radio on more is number two.
CMQ FAM, number three.
No speaking English.
IOD, number six with a 3.9, which means they had like a 7.0 something.
Well, I don't know.
In women.
In men.
I don't know how their demo breakdown goes.
We're getting laid on the break, but don't worry about it.
Very low key to the end.
Leave it.
It's a white out right now.
I can't see outside the window.
It's just a white out.
You know what I mean by that?
Yep.
White out.
Know it well.
I'm still looking the midday for us.
I don't find it.
It's not looking pretty too promising.
Oh, QAM tied for 18th.
From 14th with a 2.7 and last round to a 2.0.
So we did a 4 in men.
Very, very, very weak.
No bonus money coming in this book.
So we don't.
None.
Waxe, a 1.4 down from a 1.9.
They're 22nd.
So everybody's just dropping.
Like a rock.
No speaking English.
Where's the rest of the numbers?
That's all that came through.
I said everything they ran out of here.
The numbers.
They what?
You know, Clarence took them back.
Oh, they're coming.
If I was him, I wouldn't come back.
Don't come back, coming.
He's the best talent.
He's a real Roger.
He's 4.8.
He's 5.60 QAM.
The 4th leader.
So the biggest name.
The best talent.
He's the D.A. Joe.
Weakness from the A.2.
And I'm here on.
I'm 4.3.
You're 5.60 QAM.
The sports leader.
Johnny Dark.
Cheevee Nicks.
The distinctive voice of Fleetwood Mac.
Her style is unforgettable.
Her lyrics are intelligible.
Where we are now, I land, I land.
I land, I land.
I land, I land.
I land, I land.
Cheevee is back.
With all your favorite hits on one big album.
It's Cheevee Nicks.
What the hell is she saying?
I land, I land.
I land, I land.
I land, I land.
I land.
I land.
Yes, all her classics are here.
You'll get me, Vigor, and the incomparable love.
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you.
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you.
Kigitally remumble, forced, terryo, inaudibility.
This is TVNX, at her most nebulous.
TVNX, what the hell did she say?
Available now, what ain't coherent records and tapes?
Why so white off, man, it's bad.
I'm gonna go lay down for a while, recover, and maybe we'll get some audience back.
You think? No. No?
Oh, by the way, I had a paper jam, which I didn't realize, so I just have all those other numbers.
Okay, good. So why did you make that up?
I'm a bastard.
You really are. We're not gonna swim, we're down.
You're just upset because we're not getting no bonus money.
We'll help.
What?
What? Maybe.
These numbers are scandalous.
Yeah.
scandalous.
Now let's get to, you think cars were bad, which they were.
We got about a four, I don't know what we got, maybe a four, five, five year in man.
Yeah. And what's the Donald got, a one, three?
Promotions, happy Christmas from, oh my god, spam.
I don't have time for spam.
Thought it was something important, like you just won a billion dollars in the Australian lottery.
Here's one that says, Neil, you and scare America, the only program worth listening to.
I know South Dakota is overwhelming the Democratic Liberal left leaning.
I guess the only ones who listen to the radio are old Cubans and rash wingers.
These ratings make no sense.
How is it possible that the public airwaves don't represent the public radio and TV sucks?
Happy holidays from Iran from both. Thanks, Ron.
No, this is what happens when the right wingers get to diaries.
They just did, oh, did, oh, did, oh, and I would be good.
So this big number all across the board, except in the morning where it was pretty weak, Jimmy.
Hey, Jimmy, you're fairly weak.
The fake Jimmy, by the way, sending us all kinds of acoustic emails.
Like he's got, like he's got a number in there.
Okay, here's 25 54 in the afternoon.
Hot 105's got an 8.7.
They're number one. I read some of these. I don't know.
I would, I read some of these. I don't know.
I read some of these.
I read some of these.
I read some of these.
I read some of these.
I read some of these.
I read some of these.
I read some of these.
I read some of these.
Like you always said, if he likes it, it's going to suck and it's going to fail.
I mean, a 1.1 in the afternoon in person's 25 54.
That's close to like transmitters off the air.
You know what?
Oh, I'm sorry, I had my mic off.
No, you did not.
Oh, all of a sudden now you've become a monk because these, what's to say?
What can I say? It sucks.
It blows.
Because I said it ahead of time.
I said it before the decision was even made.
You said what? Just point.
I made a blind prediction. Whatever Joe chooses to be on there, it's going to suck and it's going to fail.
Right.
I mean, I think even worse than jerks.
We're drowning. Somebody throw us a life raft.
And then these counts across the street other than the afternoon, which they've been doing pretty good over there in the afternoon all along anyhow.
Other than that, they have no story.
They've got nothing.
Nothing. A 1.9.
Oh, but we got 40.
I don't care if you got 20 million votes on your poll.
Okay, nobody gives a crap about those stupid polls, including us.
Oh my god. Talk about silly people.
Just keep talking, talking, talking, talking. Talk yourselves into big success.
You guys are kicking ass, you're wrong.
And like I said before, you put the two stations together and you still don't have crap.
That's the sad part.
Oh no, people want to hear about the fish, the fish.
And this is our dolphin book. Keep in mind.
This is when we have our claim to fame, the daun, the daffins.
Let's take a look and see what we got on the weekend.
I usually don't pay any attention to those.
Person's 2554 on the weekend.
Now, this is when we should be big with the fish.
Of course, we got Jimmy Cifalus to put up with.
Let's see. QAM.
Not on the first page, down on the second page.
Where the hell are we?
On the third page with a 2.1 tied for 17th with the dolphin.
All right, we're kicking.
So that means we got about a four share in men on the weekend.
What's the big stimulus with that?
What is the big stimulus with that?
And let's see what they got across the street on the weekend.
I don't see them on our page.
Oh, there they are. A 0.4 in men, a 0.8 on the weekend.
Your sports leaders, or no, where the sports they, whatever they are.
The sports trailers.
The trailer trash 0.4.
Let me say it again.
This was a disaster trend for both sports stations.
I like to see Barry Jackas put a spin on this.
Hey, spin it, Barry. You fairy.
Now, here's some more fake.
Oh, and here's one you'll love.
And this is from the real Johnny Dork.
Sorry to hear about the bad trends.
How the mighty of fallen.
Hey, Johnny, I'll send you a copy of my paycheck.
Okay, Tubby, Redneck, Hate Monger, Goofball, Loser.
Where's Johnny working?
Is the employer these days or not?
I don't know.
And who cares?
It's 82 along the coast.
All these great unemployed broadcasters, all these marginal people in the history of human race.
Just out there jumping up and down, dancing on our grave.
The Titanic is, we're almost to the bottom.
Can we go any lower?
Yeah.
Not much.
But yes.
Oh, there's still room for more failure.
We're still in whole numbers there, don't you know?
We don't have a number that starts with a...
Oh, right.
They got that one on the weekend.
I like to cross the street of 0.4.
Why not just shut it off and do transmitter maintenance for Christ's sake?
Now, here's another one from Jimmy Cifalus, who's just...
He's just dancing in his pants.
He's so excited.
Even though the rest of IOD went through the roof, the mornings were not so great.
Lavasters' impressive growth in the rating suggests youngmasters are drawn to the humor
that clever offbeat bits in some of the pop culture chatter that's become a staple of his show.
Some of the pop culture chatter, my ass.
Oh, my God.
Let me say it again.
Two numbers of count.
One on the check on the 10th and the one on the check on the 25th.
Those are the only ones that count.
And all these people run around.
Oh, look at this.
We did this.
We did that.
Yeah, 1.9 here.
What did you say?
I don't have a 1.4 in men.
Lame.
Really lame.
But you're just picking that up, you know.
No, I'm not.
It's right there in black and white.
We'll be glad to send a copy to everybody in the world.
John says, not sure if you heard, but Bubba loves Bunstein for another two years in series.
Yay, it says.
This is almost as great as the time Jolly Jobelle threatened to quit QAM.
What was that?
I don't remember that.
I guarantee if he threatened to quit QA, and there might be some people take him up on it.
But nevertheless, don't start getting hostile with Jolly Jobelle.
Now, here's our buddy.
I sure hope I have time to get to Kenny Gramer's long treatise on Larry King later on.
Oh, it's just, it will make some of the most, and get us down into single shares.
Like one share.
This is what happens when they take the show away.
This is what happens.
Oh, no, you're at uni.
You won't take those funny calls.
Yeah, that must be it.
That must be it.
Hundreds, what do we got?
180 votes on this pool.
Not 25,000, like we used to have.
191.
We got what?
191.
191, what?
Oh, just relax.
Okay, don't start getting all defensive.
I mean, you know, they got George Zanano over there getting his 49,000 votes.
I'll guarantee you that.
And I bet you Jimmy Cifalus's pool has got 20 million votes because Jimmy's a really popular guy.
What will you or what do you miss the most?
What will you miss?
Full service gas stations 44.
Record stores 21.
I am not going to read all these.
There's like 600 choices on this pool.
Whoever sent this pool was like on heavy duty acid.
Bookstore 17.
This jockey 17.
Porn actors 10.
Everything else single digits.
But there's a lot of choices on there.
So vote early and often.
So we can get up to 25 million votes and make ourselves look good.
What do you think?
Sounds great.
I got news for those numbers they got over there.
That's sad, especially the one in the morning with a big, big mouth.
Another one.
You don't give me a lot of money.
It's worth it.
You'll find 60 QAM.
The biggest names of the best talent.
You're listening to sports radio 560 WQAM.
I am a Ford Lauderdale.
This is the Neorodger show.

A spanny said seems like two months
Especially with Peterson a person he impersonated with great effect over the last year
So reportedly having proposed marriage she had another woman
I'm here in Chicago for more than 30 years dolls freewheeling freeform style inspired a generation of voices
Doll was cut loose by CBS and in part because of arbitration switch to electronic devices to compile the audience estimates
Used to set ad rates didn't reward his program the way its old diary system did
Doll has lost weight since leaving the year has meal and sleep schedule a skew
An occasional calmness for the Chicago trip he hopes to contribute more to the paper now

How long has that turd been on here about three years now?
We talk about
I'm talking about the the whole format over their cross-dread ticket ticket. Oh, I don't know. Yeah, it's not a problem. I think is it
I think so and he's right years and I think they're right
They had months where they had a bunch of 18 to 34-male wire diaries
Diddo diddo diddo diddo and they talked to begin. Oh, that's gonna be our demo where younger and hip are and yada yada
And all the southern crap in the meantime. They suck wind
They haven't invented a demographic that they're gonna do put good in there. There isn't isn't one
Existence
Whatever that means vegetarian take me
297 votes on the poll once we get to 300 then we're gonna be dangerous, Chris
Sounds good
299
299
Let me say to get idea all the other fakers in this market who do polls on their websites show the audience how many votes
You've got okay? Don't make up numbers off the air and just go on and say oh we got 18,000 votes on the poll
Yeah, you should live so long you don't have 18,000 people listening is a matter of fact that's good
That's interesting. Let's take a look and see what Jorge's cum is
Okay, okay
Men 18 plus
If I can dig that many pages in oh look at WFTL 850.7 nice going over there
They're really doing it
Okay, he's not on the third page. Where the hell is he?
Is he even in here? Does he been delisted?
One put there it is
The cum that's the number of people who reach during the weakest 33,000
33,000 is the cum
Our cum ain't that much better. It's about 40,000
Week of course, how can the cum go up on nobody? Yeah, I want number one nobody can hear the station and number two nobody promotes
I get I get a free credit
He must have a real good in there as much as our life flea is a good guy cares about us
But he must have a real good in because how can you have a promotions manager when there is no promotion going on
There's lots just not for us there is
Not promotions as you know it in the olden days of radio. I'm talking about promotions where you go out and find new audience
No, no, no, no, that's not that's not what that's called anymore
That's called wasting money is where that's called wasting time. That's right. Hey, you want to hear what we got on? Oh
We're the sports leader
Whatever that means I don't know what it means we used to be once upon a time
And then Joe Bell came to town and now we're the sports loser
Oh, this this guy is just obsessed with fat Chris
GD it this christ is sitting on talk. He speaks when spoken to okay. Don't be knocking poor Chris
He's getting shoved out the door. He's gonna be on food stamps
He's gonna be digging up old books of SNH green stamps and you're ripping Chris
Right in the middle of holidays to heartless rotten bastards

Spark, Spark, Spark, Spark, Spark, Spark, Spark, Spark, Spark, Spark, Spark, Spark, Spark, Spark.
Be on it's day.
Be on it's day.
I'm having me a little lunch, honey, like that. Eat your heart out.
Well good. I'm having an egg roll. I'll eat my heart out for lunch.
Well, no, I'm telling you, I ordered Chinese delivery last night and I got an extra entree
and I put it in the refrigerator and along with an extra egg roll.
Because I knew I wasn't going to be able to go out today.
You say, you're going out in this?
No.
It's like the end of the world, man.
Just put your snow treads on that door's givvy.
Yeah, oh yeah. Yeah, I walked to Woodbite.
How about putting your snow treads on your back?
Back to badass.
No, thank you.
Then you could skid down the road here.
That's all you.
So I nuked this egg roll for 45 seconds.
Yeah.
And you can't believe the amount of grease in this thing.
In the shell, you know,
grease,
even Bob Greaseball never saw so much grease.
Now there's a guy.
What when's his show starting?
Every other ex-jocke in the world.
I mean, he's doing the color on his off college football games last hundred years.
He's just horrible.
Oh, there you go again.
Riffin our legendary hero Bob Greaseball.
He is. He's awful.
And is boring as if you had, you know,
that tow yard turd bit I played yesterday.
Yeah.
If you had that turd on a plate,
it would be more fascinating than Bob Greasey.
Wow.
Work with them that one year on UM-based ball on Channel 33.
Terminally boring guy.
Just bland.
Just like what you see is what you get.
No sense of humor.
Just him.
And it's all about sports.
He lives and reads and smells and eats it and drinks it.
Oh my god.
Too many naked showers, man.
It does strange things to guys.
Too many showers with other adults naked.
Oh, dude.
This thing is hot.
You know, it's really not much to an egg roll, you know.
It used to be better if I recall.
What do you mean by that?
It used to be like shrimp and meat and stuff.
And it knows you hold the cat.
Oh, I couldn't get those.
We have to order shrimp egg roll.
This is just plain egg rolls.
Got all those sprouts inside of it.
Yeah.
Cabbage.
And maybe some mouse droppings.
You know, because, well, floor sweeping.
Pete says, please fire that sorry ass George.
His forced personality and fake emotion has turned me away.
Funny as hell would be firing little butt liquor on the air.
It would beat the same old, dashed the collars and screw the management stick.
Have a fruitful day, Pete.
Yes, screw you, Pete.
And George says screw you too.
Bend over.
Loser.
Yeah.
So that holiday cheer.
Whatever.
There's something wrong there.
There's something that just really wrong.
Oh, just one person writing all those emails.
Get out of here.
The same.
The same.
The same.
The same.
The same.
The same.
The same.
The same.
The same.
Go for it.
I'm going to have to play some eating music or something.
No.
Can't find that song, by the way.
No.
No.
No, it's Donald song.
Donald song.
Don't more by art and dotty Todd.
Medley of their head.
Founded by Edith P. F.
She's dead too, by the way.
Oh, here's the weather thing.
And then of course, slow down and pay attention to the road condition.
So those are just a few of the other things.
Other things care to keep in mind.
Wash or fluid.
You need to have that.
Make sure your windshield wipers work properly.
And have some snacks with you, especially if you're in the car with your kids.
I like it.
I know the drive-throughs are line up already.
Have any kids with you around the corner.
Also, I want one other thing really quickly.
But that's for you.
Use the proper lock so the vehicle can see you.
Correct?
Oh, absolutely.
You certainly don't want to be just jetting out in the middle of the road on a day like this.
Why not?
You can fall down in the snow and roll around in like a little kid, right?
Right.
No ice.
In fact, Jim and Chicago says I actually got to listen live today.
A recent change of work has prevented me from listening via iPod.
So I'm out of touch with South Florida now.
I'll consider yourself lucky, Jim.
I'm stuck home due to the ice storm here in South Suburban Chicago.
Everything is just coated in ice and my train isn't running.
So it's a snow day.
Since I have a degree in meteorology, I looked at an environment candidate's website
and see that the same storm is heading for you.
Yeah, you have to have a degree in meteorology to look at the...
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Hopefully no ice for Toronto.
Just want to let you know I have one more listener alive on a Friday.
Stay warm and have a good weekend.
Well, you too, Jim.
Thought.
When a doubt tried to thought.
No ice.
Just nasty blowing snow.
It's just blowing and blowing and windy as hell and just bitter.
Oh, I'm not complaining though. I'm nice and warm inside.
I got me my egg roll.
I got all these friendly e-mailers today.
Neil at Nearogins.com.
We had those great ratings come out.
Oh my God.
But you know something?
The after about like the first two minutes after you look at the number on the sheet of paper.
Joe Bell has gotten us to the point where there's no shock value anymore.
Right?
Right? I'm not.
I mean, about five years ago, if we had gotten a train like that, we were dumped out pants.
Right?
Right?
We were checking up.
Who were the shock?
Smelly dumb.
Horrified.
Decided ourselves.
But now?
Hey.
That's the Joe Bell F and Wayman.
What did I tell you about him?
He's got loser written all over his body.
I wonder if he needed Marx's notice that.
Miles says,
I'm sorry about for eating the egg roll on the ear.
No, you're not.
As I was no, I'm not.
As I was going down your list of adjectives that best describe our beloved South Liberty and compatriots, this was the poll the other day.
I was struck by one characteristic that seems omitted by your poll namely greed or just plain selfishness.
From being tested by multi-level marketers on the street to the various fly-by-not companies that spring up,
the identity theft, the large amount of fraud of all kinds, the notoriously horrible tipping from unnamed sectors of the population can't help think that my wall is constantly in the bullseye of the people of sliced vultures down here.
From a jaded but long time decades long listener.
Thanks, Mal.
How do you like that?
I'm sure that the happy Hanukkah and holiday greeting stuff is going to be pouring in here the last two hours of the show today.
Nothing.
Just a few polls.
Nothing else.
Just hostility.
And while they're out busy schlepping and shopping, man.
I can't imagine how they're doing it in this in this weather.
Where am I, man?
Yep.
This wasn't too bad.
The egg roll.
You had Chinese doing what?
You were egg roll.
Yeah, well, egg rolls nothing special.
I could go back and heat up my crispy chicken by entree, but that would be real bad.
You hear the sirens?
No.
You hear it?
You will.
You will.
You can't hear that?
Nope.
Crazy people out there driving, walking, all of these things.
Oh.
Here's my financial guy right in the middle of my show.
I'm faxing you six pages that need to be faxed to us so and so.
Oh, right in the middle of the show.
How do you like that?
I sure hope I got some paper left in there after those horrible ratings.
Took up all my fax paper.
Here's one from a bikini John.
Bikini John.
You fairy.
Love your show. Run it like you want.
That's what makes you the king of talk shows.
And if some listeners don't like what you say or have to say, let them switch channels.
No one's forcing them.
Anyway, I'd like your opinion on Glenn Beck and Dr. Laura.
Oh.
I work for the county.
I'm in the car all day, 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. while driving around.
Sometimes I skip through the channels while waiting for your show.
Glenn Beck seems to be the world's biggest doom.
But he can be funny at times.
He's a crazy person.
A crazy Nazi.
Too much god in those AA meetings.
You're telling that I guess?
Oh, it falls right and I'll be back.
Right where we picked up yet.
I really love these.
It's a huge day.
Dude.
I'm almost fainted already from the soap opera today.
I mean, it's, you know, middle of December and they're just like running around these.
They learn like argined peanut.
Yeah.
I don't know where the soap opera comes from.
Her earrings are almost bigger than her eating.
By the way, you know, yes.
It's actually a pretty good song.
That's why I keep playing the one song.
I mean, they're a pretty good CD but this was a good one.
Well, that was my financial card.
It wasn't enough for him to bug me on the emails.
Now he's calling me.
I mean, they're in the middle of the show.
And he's faxing me stuff but it ain't coming through.
Oh, god.
And Dr. Laura seems to have absolutely no compass of compassion for any recorders from.
Why are you listening to that crap, Bikini, John?
So many of your listeners, or at least the ones who call them,
and seem to be more honest and have nothing to say except making annoying sounds emanating from their pie holes.
With the risk of sounding like I'm trying to suggest something, I suppose I am,
maybe someone should screen the callers to be sure they have something interesting and constructive to say.
Oh, when is that going to start?
What year is that going to start?
Call me up and let me know.
The best talent.
Your business is your project.

By the way, Kevin says, oh wait a minute, my fax machine is puking
Maybe that's not from you, is it, I hope?
No, good
Strong, saw that more art and dotty-todd, I can't believe it
I cheated, I just went on YouTube

But even spinning or nothing, just there it is

Oh, 58, 58, 58, I was, I had my thumb in it

Kevin said, you mentioned this man briefly a couple of days ago, Charles Tampold
And he died in 2001 after a long battle with Alzheimer's
God working again, still waiting for the XTC song, please
I don't think we got it, you got it there, I don't have it
Yeah, I got it
You're good?
It's very long
I know, we're not actually going to play it hard
Not right now
Okay
Well, somebody's still waiting for it
They'll be waiting a while
Sorry, Kevin, George is a hard-ass
Oh, Ed Till, go away if this is the real, even if it's the fake Ed Till, just go away
I want to tell you an Ed Till story
Okay
This is a guy who, he belongs on the ear about as much like
Jerks belongs on the ear
Just total nerd, absolutely no talent, none
And eventually with the assistance of certain groupies is
He wound up on the ear in Pittsburgh and I think Boston
And like real markets with real people
Not for long though but nevertheless
And so there was uh, he kept coming to our station when I was the PD for a short time at WNWS
And they kept trying to uh, sick him on us, you know
Oh Ed Till is here, he wants to play his audition tape for you, Neil
And he really would like to do a talk show on our station about
And then I, they just kept bringing him back
I'm trying to think of who the person was, they kept bringing him back in
Steve Dickle
No
And he was just horrible, just awful
I mean he made the B sound like Walter Cronkite
And now here he is bugging me, you know, this is this is the advantage of having this email address
Ed Till, it wasn't bad enough he sent the first email before and I ripped him and asked
I'm sure you heard it
I'm assuming this is the real one, maybe it's not
I think it is
I heard you mentioned Stan Major the other day, he's just listening to his show in the late 80s
I'm WNZ, he had the pleasure of meeting him, is he on the ear anywhere?
I don't know and we don't care
Go away Ed Till go away
Till health reasons over and it's doing a good job of that here today
Well I got your six pages here Bill, I'll sign them during the break and fax them to the appropriate parties
Wow
Not only does he email me in the middle of the show he calls me
In the middle of my very important radio show, hey, what's that?
He's a good guy, he's a good guy
He made me some money, never lost a dime for me
Which is a novelty, but nevertheless
Ten to fifteen to twenty centimeters of blowing snow baby it blows
I'm getting off of that weather network, I can't sit, it's depressing
If I want to see the weather, I just look outside the window
I see just just just a blur of white, a blur
Side says you can protect yourself from cold and heat
But how do you protect yourself from soft photos, hatred, stupidity and ignorance?
That sounds very cynical to me, you saw it, but absolutely right on target
I mean, don't wouldn't you think that somebody who knows what you do for a living
Wouldn't be calling you in the middle of your radio show?
Oh hey if I had it done
I mean if you if you knew somebody if you worked for somebody who was like a surgeon, a heart surgeon
And you knew what time he performed his surgeries would you call him right in the middle of open heart surgery?
You would I would because you that's because you have no heart. That's right. I'm heartless

Ordering Chinese food over the phone
In my fridge
I don't want that
Over and over again
I reheat it over and over again
But I saved it
My girl waited
Though unremptful
And I start to gag
Whenever I look inside
Breakfast lunch and dinner
It's cold, turkey
And cold, peanut pie
It's a shame to see
All this food going down
And going to wait
Let's open some of the room again
It's got a bad taste
Let's open some of the room again
When I think it's turning
Oh, my stomach's turning
I don't know what else to do
How am I thrown away that far
Cause it's all in my fridge
I don't want that
Over and over again
I can't eat cranberry sauce again
No mashed potatoes
No, it's all in my fridge
I don't want that
Over and over again
I reheat it over and over again
But I keep it
I can't eat it
Cause it's all in my fridge
I don't want that
Over and over again

Well, I was shopping at the store for some food. Buying groceries never felt so good.
Too bad I didn't know my credit was waxed. Store security was breached in the database.
Got a CRAP that spells me. My credit is crap.com baby. I'm as screwed as I can be.
Thought about killing myself maybe. Now instead of eating, couldn't get in fact.
My identity was stolen and now my life is just crap. CRAP that spells me.

Now maybe someday if we live long enough, you can tell me why some people like that bit.
Oh, it was funny half a one time. No, I don't think it was ever funny.
360 few votes on the pool. By the way, no, they would be complete without an email from the fake Maria Barthoromo.
Of course. Hello, Mr. Rogers. I'm sitting in my dressing room listening to your program on my lunch break.
And I heard you're doing business with a financial guy. I would like to congratulate you and welcome you into the free markets.
I'm so glad to hear you finally taking my advice and taking advantage of this great buying opportunity.
I'm sure with the next couple of months you'll have full faith and confidence.
We will be restored in the great American markets. Well, I need to run and go powder my eyes before the closing bill.
Have a great weekend.
Sincerely Maria B. Well, guess what Maria B? I don't have one share of stock. I don't have one mutual fund.
I don't have any investments in anything I could lose a diamond Maria B.
How do you like that? Okay.
I will be once Shema and Maria. Full me twice. Shema and Ted David.
And full me three times. Shema and Ron and Santa with without the hair piece.
Now that was just a little preview that little segue. I had a little block.
A little block. I have an hour block from one to two. And you know something. Maybe next week we'll have a all week block.
You'll be on vacation anyway. Yeah. Right. Right. Because I just have a feeling there's not.
Oh enough of the ratings talk already says Nelson Reelder Jr.
I'd rather hear those ponderous and boring Disney and Chris Matthews.
But you've been mailing an instance your last contract renewal fire George and replace him with Chris.
At least we never have to hear about Simpson South Park the roller rink of ass.
Activities blow it out your ass. Reelder Jr. Whatever. How your stupid name is.
That's the kind of stuff that I delete all day long. On and on. Oh, and look at that.
He said the same thing under the other name.
Nelson Reelder Jr. Jr. Jr. Yeah. Go away. Just go to hell away. Don't go away. Matt. Just go away.
Here's the poll so far. Fat Chris is a Jones and for 400 votes today. You'll do it.
You think? How what? What would you or what do you miss the most?
Full service gas stations 87 records to us 43. This jockey's 28.
Well, there's like 6000 things on his list.
Bookstores 24 porn actors 17 pay phones 15 turntables 13 carburetor 13 drummers 11 telephone operators 11 US Postal Service 10.
Film cameras. Nine print and cement cinematic porn. Nine pymphs displaced by the cell phone in the web eight and it goes on three of them don't have any yet.
Pretty depressing. Of course, if we had 48,000 votes like across the street, we then they all have a whole bunch of votes.
But we just think of no audience no more career messenger services zero bookbinder zero and type setting zero type setting.
When you miss that. Oh, yeah, keep punch cards. I miss those.
I don't know who did this pool, but obviously in serious needs.

What the hell did you do?
It smells just like rotten meat.
You're fairy.
Siren, fart.
Deadly fart.
I cut one.
At K-Mart.
I watched a woman's head swivel all out.
She was wearing a terrible crown.
I walked right out of that place.
With a big smile on my face.
Siren, fart.
Deadly fart.
Doing it is quiet and art.
Glad one goes but don't look back.
I thought victims of your gas attack.

Go ahead and jump and wrap your own.
It ain't so easy when you're doing at home.

And I'd like to give y'all a special Christmas message.
A message of peace.
Like, uh, how about a little piece of that high gold bar?
Thank you.
I got one more.
A lot of whole sand.
Christmas is a time of hoot.
A time of joy.
A time of eleven.
And I share with a little takes lines that teach you to go out there.
Okay, one more.
More, more, more.
Oh yeah, Christmas.
The Christmas to me means family.
Your family means friends.
Your friends means getting together.
And getting together means eating.
Oh, pass me that drumstick, which please.
Well, thank you.
I'm going to run more.
Now, just one more say to you right now.
You know, I may be a big star, maybe too big.
But ain't nobody so big,
you can't reach out a helping hand.
A helping hand.
Oh, yeah.
Hand me a helping of those my taters over there,
which please.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Now, I was saying, ain't nobody so big,
you can't stoop to help a friend of me
over the holiday season.
Speaking of season,
you won't pass me that soft sugar when you get the chance.
Like it.
Yeah, just, just those screws of color,
that's right.
Like I remember most.
So, this Christmas,
why don't y'all take a tip from old,
hey, old ones.
Now, I'll leave those steak tips right where they are.
You know what I mean?
You know, appreciate it, thank you.
I want you to remember,
we're all part of God's great big family.
You know God made man unto his own image.
Look at the mirror,
I'd have to say God must be a big, big son of a gun.
You know what I mean?
I like it dear.
But I especially want y'all to remember this one last thing.
Y'all that homeless Christmas stringing that popcorn up on the tree,
save a big, big bowl for the can.
Extra bust, you know what I mean?
I like it dear.
I like it.
I remember.
I'm actually that extra butter

You think I like butter?
Can't take too much butter.
I should play that.
But I'm the only one who likes that bit.
You like it?
I like it.
Oh.
How about you, Fancy?
You like it?
It's okay, but you know,
every day it's getting a little old.
What?
Oh, what?
I'm not talking about the Elvis that I agree with that.
I'm talking about Can't Stand,
Can't Take Too Much Butter.
I don't think it really affects me that much.
What do you mean?
I don't get the,
I'm not asking whether it affects your inner is a master about the bit.
I can't take too much butter.
It shoots right out my ass.
There you go with saying ass on here.
Now here's a really nice email.
One.
I mean, there were a couple of other ones, but not too many.
A couple.
It's the 19th of December.
Tomorrow, this weekend is Chanooka.
And Christmas is a few days away.
Not that I celebrate any of them, but nevertheless,
just just out of common decency.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Redlands, Jim and Janet say,

Puff the magic wrapper is on my TV
No one heard of him before
His name is Muff Daddy
I said that's Puff the magic wrapper
Won't be here that long
Not unless he learns to sing on the right
Of friggin' song
I said Puff the magic wrapper
Is all over MTV
Only because someone shot no glorious
P.I.G. that that guy
Maybe someone should tell him
Making it this way is wrong
Picking at your dead best friends
De-king flesh and bone
Stoop doggy doggy dog on the ball track
Pick my nose again
I just can't wait to pick my nose again
I'll roll up green eballs and ping them at my friends
I just can't wait until I pick my nose again
Pick my nose again
Drill my index finger ring up for my brain
Here we go again
I got a tickle mouth before I go insane
I can't refrain
Because I gotta hold again
Long joyous hours of digging over again
I'd use your handkerchief
But who knows where it's bound
So thank you I'll just pick my nose again
Here's something for you
Pick my nose again
What a great way to pass the time along the highway
You can't be my friend
But don't send those big old workers fly in my way
You hope they find me
Pick my nose again
I'll do it by myself or with my friends
Asked why you're a friend
Your nose is kittin' if you must pretend
But whatever you do just pick that nose again
And I don't give a damn who it is
Why?
Oh, yeah
Pick some fire
Waffle lots of weed
They pick us to hurry
Can't not fall off our highways
Our families won't hungry
And no hope could be found

Not to hide enough to bring some feature down
Then you walked in the studio
To put the whole fire in your bag
Give me that pizza
That's my pizza
I get dirty little
I don't care if balls just stop
To death it's no concern
Wow
I'll have you know it's more important for me
Who survived?
You grant me my soul
Number of tea in title mint
The pizza
I only had a nigginish mint
In a sliver of a slice of the pizza
I watch a pizza
I'll take that pizza

I said the game so back at town!
I got a long team out.
I know everything that's going on in that room.
But I even know all the new magic rules.
I've had to enjoy that ear.
You better go and talk to the guy.
It's a better show when I take your place.
I know I ain't no way to play with him.
But when they drop my voice, we'll change.
You little smoothies.
I'm going to play with you.
I'm going to play with you.
I'm going to play with you.
I'm going to play with you.
I'm going to play with you.
I'm going to play with you.
I'm going to play with you.
I'm going to play with you.
I'm going to play with you.
I'm going to play with you.
I'm going to play with you.
You finally got to call him.
Number one.
I want you to take on Jake Bieber.
Oh, Jay Feeley, is a great quarterback and a good joke.
I like Jay Feeley.
Well, not to mention, he's got extraordinary, never-least smooth beatopses.
Oh, yeah!
Maybe it's gotta be different what you say here.
Oh, kick the fuck, thank you, ma'am.
Oh, no, no, wait a minute, don't go.
But I have nothing else to say.
Look, look, look, look, look, how about this?
How's the weather down there in the mirror, ma'am?
I'm right down the street from you.
Oh, yeah.
I have to go.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, stop.
No, no, no, I have to go.
Look, I tell you what, I'll hold you open up right now.
How's that, eh?
I'll give you one of my old tank t-shirts, how's that?
Bye, bye, bye.
No way!
That was the only color we had.
The things on your nose is blowing again.
The noise, the noise, the noise, the noise, the noise.
The noise, the noise, the noise, the noise, the noise, the noise, the noise.
Wow!
You got things, wonderful things.
On your nose and on your face,
And around those posing pimples,
You call my eyes, I, I, I, if you go look
In the mirror, you'll be a roadmap of YSL and T.
You got your heavy sun, way to die, yeah, yeah,
Wow, wow.
My nose glows when something stays.
Almost every day I think,
And my veins as they start to tickle,
My I'd annoyed the door to door to door, yeah, I'd go,
Like the ball in the back,
That's like a sound of a crampio pie,
Where the nose gets full, with wiggle veins.
Yeah, this is a good life,
And that's what they see,
And science turns up their stagweree,
Oh, you know how to bleed,
Horde the vein,
The ballad, the ballad, the ballad.
The ballad, the ballad.
Hey, try not to say that.
What the hell is this?
I'm just lying.
Hey, when I grow up, I want to be,
Just like Jim Skyler, with a $30 key for you.
I wouldn't need to buy a fancy,
That horror computer,
A microphone and tape-naked wheel deer,
Even a slumber like Bokeh Brian,
Has better equipment, but even sound.
Oh, and I grow up,
I want to be just like Jim Skyler,
Than I wouldn't have to spend my day,
Here comes my cello,
I wouldn't have to spend my day,
I think that sounds just fine.
Faster than a touch-tone phone,
Louter than a pneumatic drill,
Able to side-step reality in a single bound.
Look, they're on the phone.
It's a randed moose.
It's a brain jackass.
Yees, do you believe these people?
No, it's Yintamen.
Yes, it's Yintamen.
Strange visitor from another market,
With a phone growing out of his head.
Great warning is gonna do mornings on sheave.
What do you think?
Yintamen, with a bizarre compulsion
To pass along Radio Gossip,
They thought it wasn't a clips of the sun,
But it turned out to be Demi Ellis,
Unbeat-leavable.
Yintamen, who can change the course of any discussion,
Dile two telephones with one hand,
And who disguised as Lee Howler,
Il Menard Tuckos for a semi-professional radio station,
Bites a never-ending battle for rumor,
In Yuendo, and Arbitron advances.
Yeah, Neil is leaving Miami,
To buy a station in Lakeland.
Do you believe that guy?
The best talent for a radio artist,
Fortlea 560 QAM,
The fourth leader.
It's Danny,
If Miami Town,
The Dota Dota Story,
At 560 WQAM.
Anybody here,
Seen Jackhead from all,
In his orange jumpsuit and pedora,
He's screwed a lot of people,
But he sometimes get calm,
Like a variety in New York.
Everybody here,
Seen good friends in Thompson,
There'll be more around their town.
He's not just sitting together,
But true people he's done,
Take the chance to see him,
In a shower with his son.
Avers and eyes is what the White House is capable,
Or with his Christians who know what's best,
Or you and me,
Aver of all that is,
He was in some need,
In other words, do he,
As anybody here,
Please say to Tom,
To let me,
For there's help from the parts of the hoars.
These kind of signs,
They long and can't pay why,
Aver of all that's in the hands on.
Bye bye bye!
The biggest name,
The best palate andoson
And your bones for Miami doleces will bowl
For TOP 5,
The 12Q AF
Miami for the låterdale
Whether it was fire or war or before if it was not, if it was still photoshopped, it would probably burn itself meat.
OK, 20 million transportation of my house?
