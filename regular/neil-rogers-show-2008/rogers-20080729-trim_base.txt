What's the meaning of this?
What are you two doing in my office?
You were with my career.
You're about to ruin my, dude.
Oh, orders from the top fellas.
Spores is the only thing that matters.
What a pipe smoke.
Flamere queer, man.
I'm a post.
Yes, it's true.
I really care to help her.
But what can I do?
I'm a poet.
A poor hole.
A mentally-quitchie perverted home owl.
When my lips were mowed in by now,
you can note that I'm hungry.
We're driving to Gauntlet and call.
What a pooh.
Where is a pooh?
Pooh.
He's where is a pooh.
Pooh.
I'm the one.
And they adore it.
And by that I do not like it.
Brown knows they corporate horror.
I make more.
From flat data.
Can't they?
They're still just a crazy.
We're doing quite well as far as I could tell.
A rating of zero is not hard to spell.
What a joke.
I'm Clarence the Pooh.
Pooh.
He's Clarence the Pooh.
Pooh.
Pooh.
I prefer an all-port format.
That's so stupid for it.
I just do it for me, not you.
I'm an empty sight.
I like the aroma.
I'm close to the center, coer.
I make like a bunny.
Yes, they're in it, buddy.
I have one lucky girl with a lucky career.
What a queer.
He's Clarence the Pooh.
He's Clarence the Pooh.
Pooh.
I'm a fabulous overtake radio program director.
And the locker room will towel and join by a lucky record.
Can't they arrest?
No, I'm not.
It's a 30-word.
Oh, let's stop every moment.
I'll leave a spot.
Yes, I'll watch.
The four halls we've handed.
And there's a band love.
Your partner.
They don't do it.
A police of poop even gave us a wanted thing.
That's it.
Out of my office.
I'm very busy right now.
I have the sashay over to the hurricane locker room.
The door to the door to the door to the door.
I'm a poo fairy.
Okay, 10-03 at 5, 60-WDQ-A.
I'm happy Tuesday to you.
And speaking of Clarence, I guess I'd better get out of here.
I can go back to bed.
Why don't you get up this morning at all?
Yeah.
We slept till 8-20.
Good.
You believe that?
Sure.
What about 8-20?
And the alarm actually went off.
Usually I'm one of those people that the alarm never goes off.
I wake up a little bit before and out.
And I lay there in bed and I stare at the clock.
And then just before it's going to go out like a minute before then I get out.
Show it off.
Yeah.
Never alarming?
Not really.
Should I tell a story about how I smashed up my vet?
I think you have to.
I don't really smash it up.
You must.
It's not the...
You're not doing anything else interesting.
You might as well talk to that story.
Like I said, parents doesn't have to be down the schedule to work this week.
So here's Joe.
No.
He's got you down every day to work this week.
Hi, Joe.
Nice week.
You are working every day.
I hope you understand.
I do.
I'll be on vacation again next week.
Oh, another vacation.
My God.
That's right.
So anyway, over the weekend like I told you I've had a very good run again at Woodbine.
I've been winning air every day.
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
Like Apple Odie would say.
But Sunday morning I had nice winning morning.
I was there a couple hours and I came home.
And our parking garage is one of those...
I guess all the parking garages here are like that.
Winding, you know what I mean?
Like curving and winding and descending.
And I must have, like, I don't know.
I must either, like, nodded off for a half a second or not paid attention.
All you people out there when you're driving pay attention.
Okay, that's a good lesson to learn from the old queen.
And I just...
50 years of driving.
I've never done anything quite this stupid.
And I fell off punk.
I mean, like a ton of bricks.
Yeah, that's right.
And I had smashed into the wall going around the curve.
I was just not paying real attention.
Yeah.
The only bad thing about a Corvette is that they're made of fiberglass, as you know.
And so they don't...
Like with a regular car, you get dense and, you know, like that.
And they can be pushed back out.
With Corvette, you get cracks.
Right.
And so to the right of my right headlight, there's a crack where like, you know,
pieces sticking up and it's a...
And it's not a disaster.
But it's not good.
I could leave it like this forever, I guess.
You could, but you don't want.
I don't want it.
I have a feeling that whatever I want Sunday morning, it would be nice.
And that, and more, will be.
Will be consumed when I take it to have it repaired, which I'm going to do tomorrow.
Take it to the body shop.
Maybe I ought to take myself to the body shop and have myself repaired.
There you go.
Sounds like a good idea.
Get some debts banged out.
How do you know what I'm doing or not doing at the...
You know, you got such a mouth on you, man.
Yeah.
It's just incredible.
Yeah.
You got a big mouth.
Yeah.
It's a good thing.
Sometimes, you know, what you're talking about.
And very often, you haven't got any idea what you're talking about.
All the way up to the right.
You're right.
But when you get to be an old, if you make it this far, when you get to be an old tone,
I doubt it because you're sick all the time.
All the heavy drugs and...
Sure.
...screwing around a lot of strange...
My plan is to die young, you know.
Really?
Sure.
Well, then how you going to take over the show?
Oh.
You've got another five years after this year.
Yeah.
I don't know. Maybe I'll be dead by then.
Hmm.
Then Chris can take over the show.
There you go.
Okay. Can I get you pay?
Although he might be dead before either one of us.
Oh, wouldn't surprise me.
The good people are the fat people.
And the fat people are the dead people.
I was thinking yesterday about some like Jackie Gleason.
He died. He was not that old, right?
Right.
Fat.
Sure.
John Candy.
Fat.
Mm-hmm.
John Balushi.
Fat and overdosed.
Here's George's poll from yesterday.
What should be illegal that isn't?
How about this poll?
No.
No, it's not bad. It's better than the one I got on there today.
I'm going to say it.
The poll I got on there today, if we get 500 votes, it'll be a miracle.
I don't want you to get upset, Chris, but there's nobody in town.
That's the report.
Okay.
I won't get upset.
There you will.
No.
Well, you'll pretend to get upset.
Okay. I'll do that.
What movie did I see over the weekend that I should talk about?
Oh, I know. I saw it.
Well, one and a half times.
Deadbolt.
Deadbolt?
With, um, what's your name?
Anne Baldwin.
Yeah.
Who used to really look good, by the way, man?
I don't know that.
That whole thing with all those Baldwin brothers, all the other volunteers.
Yeah, my favorite one is Harpo.
Harpo Baldwin, Groucho and Zippo and Zippo.
But anyway, Jack will, uh, what, what, what, what, what, Justin Bateman?
That's your name.
Just, really, huh?
Just, just, just, Dean Bateman.
That's what I said.
Let's say Justin, take it out.
Yeah.
Well, whatever her name is, no matter what you call her, she still looks pretty bad.
Mm-hmm.
She's nasty.
Mousey.
Yeah.
You're gonna kidnap some chicken locker in the house.
I've seen it before.
Does she, uh, show her boobs?
No.
Okay, then.
After you see that face, I don't really think you'd be cared to see the boobs or anything else.
She's nasty.
Or anything to distract you in the face.
He's a lot prettier than she is.
I'll take it that.
Anne Baldwin.
Oh, it's got Michelle Scrabeli in it.
Does she show her, uh, boobs?
No.
There's no boobs.
There's no boobs.
Oh, okay.
There's no, uh, no to begin with.
All right.
And I'm not saying it's a good movie.
I've seen it before.
It's been on me.
That's one of those made for TV movies.
Real cheesy.
Mm-hmm.
And the, he locks her up inside the house and has all the windows blocked and all this other antics.
It's, it's predictable and cheesy.
What should be illegal?
That isn't, George's, Paul 639 vote.
Well, I guess what's on the cable?
The Empire, what does that movie called?
Empire Records.
You know, Eastern promises?
Promises.
That's on, they're promoting that on my cable system.
So must be on this the next couple of weeks.
There you go.
And everybody's saying, oh, you gotta see that.
But they also said you gotta see, uh, there will be blood.
Get it right there.
Oh, my God.
There's that one guy.
There's nothing to hide.
There's nothing to hide.
One guy keeps calling about Eastern promises.
I saw a little bit of it.
I wasn't impressed.
I'm gonna go back and watch it.
I saw the preview.
You know, the right way from the beginning.
What I saw was a little plotting.
Like, ponderous.
Well, there's a lot of plotting that goes on a queue.
And then that's with the two keys.
Yes, two keys.
One should be illegal that isn't taking money in the name of God.
Oh, God.
211.
SIGURETS 90.
Telemarketing 75.
Yeah, just amazing to me that.
Well, of course, pro-visionism doesn't work anyway.
But just the idea that they sell cigarettes.
Oh, they're so bad for you.
And we have to hide and behind the counter.
But, you know, we get a lot of tax money from it.
Telemarketing 75.
Guns 47.
Door to door solicitation 40.
Street bending 33.
Spam.
Email spam 31.
Junk mail 24.
Talking in the movie theater, 20-Lock and South Florida.
Oh, God, Joe, you know what they're gonna say next?
OBSIDY 17.
Alcohol 16.
Sugar 13.
That's what I voted for, because I'm addicted.
It should be illegal.
Transfacts 13.
And then, of course, George puts stuff on there that he doesn't like.
So, if Joe doesn't like it, therefore it should be illegal.
No, that was to prove a point, like there are people that have,
that make things illegal because they don't like it.
Why, my case, don't tell me I don't like sugar.
Right.
No, like the language that we can and cannot use, for example.
Because it offends someone's sensitivities.
Brussels sprouts three, broccoli three, which I like both of those,
meat two and insanity one.
639, both.
Not all that bad considering.
Right.
Considering the time of the year and the fact that there's nobody around.
Where your last phone, look how dead it is.
How did they go yesterday?
Uh, and actually went all right for a Monday.
I was surprised that for a Monday, you know, we had dribs and grabs,
but that's, you know, that the landslide.
Considering.
Could you ever give me a straight answer?
No, like Chris, I think you're hanging out.
No, it was good for a Monday.
In other words, I had more calls than I expected to have on a Monday.
Well, good.
That doesn't mean it was good.
Thank God for that.
Better than I thought it was.
Any on there right now.
Not even like a test one, you know, a dry run.
So it could be a long, and then of course I'm going to be here on Thursday
and then I'm off for like 12 days, to which I say,
All right.
244 votes on my crappy poll today.
If you could kill someone and get away with it, who would it be?
A famous person, 88.
George 59.
How do you like that?
They love you.
And you know, you are the best.
When you get to be really good, then they want to kill you.
Right.
Your boss, 27, a crank car, 24, a family member, 21, a neighbor, 19,
your spouse, 16, a random stranger, 14, and a homeless person, 6.
Why did you put that on there?
Whoever sent this poll.
I did that.
Home will not you, but I mean whoever.
A homeless person you want to kill?
Well, here's a couple of calls, WQAM.
Hello.
Up dog.
What are you saying that it's time for the break?
The biggest name.
The best talent for the new largest.
Forty-year-five sixty QAM.
The fourth leader.
And hell, it damn near kill them.
I'm going to see Batman for the dead guy.
Did you steal him from the Lord?
I want to see that broke back, man.
He's the dead guy.
What's the dead guy wearing in my soup?
I know it's so messed up.
My reason why.
He did it.
Hey, hey, to watch the dead guy.
Watch the dead guy.
Watch the dead guy.
But I'm dead.
This ledger is so rad.
He's the dead guy.
Definitely dead.
I guess I should be so sad.
For the dead guy.
Dead people should be dead.
But he'll get that Oscar man.
And you know what?
He's already dead.
Hey, hey, because he's the dead guy.
He's the dead guy.
I wish I was dead.
I'm lying on my hair.
Ten, eighteen, and five, sixty, and WQAM.
Let's take a look at that award-winning escape.
So we got jerks at training camp at two o'clock.
Wow.
I've been saying for a long time now that I've sent him the camp.
Meddog four to six fifty.
Six fifty to seven, ten minutes of Hazarai.
The first pitch would just be angry, all spots.
And then dolphin tonight from seven to one.
Seven to eight.
Look at that. He's got seven to nine on the schedule.
And then eight to eleven. He's got the Degasio.
Clarence, this schedule they made out this week.
Below is Clarence.
Below is Bigtime.
And then Georgia will be presenting over the ratings tomorrow.
Yep.
You're planning on having a big party over it?
We'll find out.
I'll bring alcohol one way or another.
It'll be something to drink about.
Find some free food, some people, and you can promote it on a year.
Or not.
Why not?
I don't even know.
What if I go along with that?
I mean, you really, um, went out.
What went out?
I can be fired. It's in the contract.
We had to resign. Don't you understand?
They redistributed the pay-o-up portion of everyone's contract.
We had to resign it and turn it back in.
I never got it.
No, I know.
When was this?
So go ahead and write around the food gate when this was going on.
What, was really a couple of weeks now or something?
I never got one.
Well then, I guess go right ahead.
So you're ready to hit and what?
You're food that somebody brings you.
Yeah, yeah.
Order some food and give them a plug on the area.
WD2AAM, hello.
Hey, I don't like that damn much.
This one.
But I got you guys.
You see them, the good shepherd.
You don't like what?
Uh, Matt Damon is in it.
That was a good movie.
Haven't heard of it.
The good shepherd.
You might want to take that one out of the city.
You're not a good shepherd.
I'm not a good shepherd.
I'm not sure of that.
Um, I can't say it too much because of that one.
But I want to kill my co-worker.
Okay, good.
We'll put that on there.
Huh, co-worker.
Sure.
Why don't we?
Yeah, put that on the pole.
I might goose up another 10-20 votes.
I have three people in mind if it were not illegal to kill people.
I have three people in mind.
Yeah.
One is my boss.
That's obvious.
Another one is a chronic car.
E.
And the third one, um, I can't say on here.
Right.
But you know who it is.
Uh-huh.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60, and they've arrived in Singular Wireless Line.
What about my vet, my beautiful Corvette?
You think I begin a whole lot of calls.
People say, oh gee, you're getting to be seen out on a carol of smack and you're vet into a wall on a parking ride.
Just to just shock the hell out of me.
Because, you know, of course, some things you just take for granted.
Maybe you were just tired.
Yeah, probably it was like a clock in the morning.
I got a 430 degree woodbinder, five o'clock, and I was tired.
And I just, uh, maybe not an offer like a half a second.
You know, like sometimes late at night, you're driving on a highway in a long, long trek.
And you start falling asleep and then you like, uh, well, and you like come back.
Hopefully, you come back to life.
Right.
And you realize you've almost just driven off the road.
How about you guys?
You know those things for about a half a session.
Spent my whole life not being careless.
I was in a car when somebody passed out.
Really?
The driver.
I wasn't the driver.
And?
And I pulled the car over.
It was a much longer story involved in that.
But yeah, we didn't die.
Jesus.
We were going really fast on 95 to, like 80.
I'll be damned.
Yeah.
70 QYM, hello.
Hey, oh, you have a spot like the real petrol?
Wow, what's wrong with it?
No, man, you have that up a woodbite.
Of course.
You like that one?
No.
Okay, what you do when you play it, you have good success with.
Quick hit.
Quick hit.
Oh, I know that one.
Yeah, but you've got to put some coins on that one.
Yeah.
You've got to put a max all the time.
I know.
You've got to put a max on everything.
Otherwise, you're just wasting your time.
Exactly.
And one other thing too.
When is the call going to be eligible for the Hall of Fame?
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
For the broadcasting Hall of Fame, I think for sure.
And 5, 60 and leave a rise in singular wireless line.
See, we've got a whole bunch of calls coming in now.
You have little faith.
Well, these two are three anyway.
It's just a joke, boy, you're really over there.
I thought you were talking to Chris.
I'm not, I don't talk to him.
What?
WDQAM, hello.
Hi, Nick.
How are you?
What is it?
How are you?
That.
How are you?
That.
That.
Move.
Yeah, good one.
It sounded like he was at the grass station.
For George spends a lot of his time.
Sure.
WDQAM, hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah?
Neil, there's a Lucy called the Good White.
And I realize now that Obama does have a good wife.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
You're a boy.
Just as boring there as you always were with the same old stuff.
That's the Obama's wife, is she?
How about a take-sick guy?
A cane is so senile, man.
He don't even have any idea what he's talking about anymore.
And then they found out.
Oh, yeah.
It's the same one as a cheap growth.
Yeah, another growth in his ass.
Back back, though.
Oh, my God.
How anybody could consider voting for a senile old turd like him?
Oh, they will.
Be a crazy person.
You know who the kind of people are going to vote for McCain?
Crazy and stupid people.
Like that kind of Tennessee in Knoxville.
Mm-hmm.
Who got pissed off about liberals and gays and like that.
Right.
So I went to the church and started shooting people.
Well, he didn't like that liberal church, you know?
No.
What is it, Unitarian Church?
I don't know.
But why not?
Don't keep track.
Unitarian Church, that's the one that's too liberal for these Yahoo nose-picking red necks.
And he couldn't get a job so he can't get a job going in the shoots and shoots.
He's always a good idea.
Especially in church would be good, because all the religious folks go to church.
The good folks.
WQA and hello.
Say that to me, of course.
WQA and hello.
Yeah, I want another meal.
Speaking.
Hey, Neal, you know what?
You need to get your home, man.
Get what?
A home.
Humper?
Yeah, I agree.
Okay.
Get a Hummer.
I've had him.
Not lately.
297 on the survey or the poll, whatever the hell it is.
And X.
Yes.
Hum, by request.
WQA and hello.
Neal.
Yes.
Yes, hi.
I'm a long time listener, first time caller.
Hum.
I'm just calling because I was, I was, I heard like last week you were talking about, uh, David Babila-Mard being fired from WIOD.
And now he was sort of available and maybe QM might want to hire him.
No, I didn't say that.
I didn't say QM might want to hire him.
Oh, okay.
I mean, well, that there was a possibility that people were saying that he might be able to, you know, work for QM.
Somebody sent us a fax or something stupid thing like that.
Yeah.
Yeah, not because I mean, anything better than jerks, you know, I mean, please.
Table of Malt isn't better.
Dead air is better than Table of Malt, okay?
With all the respect to him and his farts, so he's, uh, not much.
Wow, yeah, I get so any of one of one of one of the, one of the things.
Tell George that I agree with him on the whole J.D. up, you know, the J.D. of women.
The J.D. of women, you know, Jehovah Witness.
Okay, tell George.
I'll tell George you.
Hey, George.
Yeah.
Wow.
What do you got?
Scary in it.
Then he Jones from the online pharmacy says they offer high quality viagra.
We're just got out of my crackberry.
It's just, it's just won't stop.
And like, like you said, they keep changing their address or whatever.
And so no matter how much you try to block them or spam them or whatever,
I must get about 50 of those a day between the Yahoo and, uh, ought to be illegal.
Yeah.
When's it going to stop?
What are we going to do about it?
It's always about viagra and C.L.s.
They must think that every guy in the world is a limp unit.
Kill some people.
How many Q.A.N. Hello?
I have food.
We don't want to hear you.
Okay.
Now, next hour, four years from Shibuas, we don't want to hear you.
We don't want to smell you.
We want to know from you.
Okay.
Just go off in a quarter and die, please.
I think it's mean.
The best talent you've ever seen in the market is 4.256 Q.A.N.
The fourth leader.
Yeah.
Tonight, on an all-new diner's drive into Dive's Bokura's home Florida,
the land of the Q.T.B. and Zombies,
who wouldn't think of finding a good diner here, but we did.
They call us Mose, Dory Dory Diner.
And I'm about to find out what the Dory Dory Park need.
Hello?
Anybody here?
Yeah, what do you want?
Are you Mose?
What's it to you, Matt?
The place is empty.
Do you have any food?
Thank God no food.
The sign says diner.
Oh, yeah.
Well, come to Mose, Dory Dory Diner.
So what's the Dory Dory about?
I don't believe it enough.
The name Mose was already taken.
So everybody said, Fuse of me here, saying that the Dory did it.
So that's why I added it.
Look, but you don't serve food.
Why open a diner?
I always wanted to open a diner.
Yeah, but you've got to serve some food.
Oh, is that what it is?
Mose, Dory Dory Diner.
Tonight, on an all-new diner's drive into Dive's.
Oh, God, how we miss him so bad.
Come on, back mose.
Dory Dory.
All is forgiven.
Mm-hmm.
1031 at 560 W.Q.M.
Well, we're killed 1.5 hours so far.
How's it going?
Ooh.
How's it going, eh?
And we got the jerk show coming up at 2.
I mean, what more could you want?
I just can't wait to see the Arleys.
I wonder if at nighttime when a book comes out tomorrow,
if we're still going to have a point.
Oh!
Oh, I don't know.
Huh?
One thing about that show, they can't go down.
Gotta move up and not down.
Gotta, gotta move up and not, you know what I'm saying?
They can't go lower than our point.
Oh!
If there's a way, they'll find it.
Oh, yeah.
If there was a way, we could find it.
The jolly joke would find it.
He could have numbers start with a minus.
5607 0560 pound 560 on a Verizon Singular wireless line.
Where's all those intellectual colors like you always get?
Oh, yeah.
Huh?
There's one now.
Just relax.
Don't push it.
I see it.
Heh.
Deputy QA M, hello.
Yes, I guess you would know that both pre-lossy drivers, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What you're calling that?
Well, yeah, something.
Maybe that was the reason he hit that guy is that he's got that brain tumor, no vac.
That could be...
Maybe no vacs out of brain tumor, and he hit that guy.
And he fled the scene.
Did you see that over the weekend?
Well, the only difference being that there wasn't anybody in my way when I whacked the wall
with my Corvette.
It was just the wall.
Not some living being.
Not out in the middle of traffic.
The whisperer is back.
Obsessed.
Is that it for the calls?
Are we done?
I guess so.
Maybe we'll spin some wax versus...
It's the day today.
Alright, I'll cue some up.
When you gave me a bum steer, you said there were going to be a lot of calls.
That's what could be...
So when they said Chris, he said there were going to be a zillion calls that were going to be great.
Uh, maybe something like that.
So he said...
Well, maybe it was, uh, what callers?
And that's not what he said at all.
567-0560.
I mean, I know there's nobody in town, but that's no excuse.
And 0560-0560.
Wiredless line.
WDQ-A-M, hello.
I noticed you were talking about the grade one.
Oh, God.
It's right in with a pool today, doesn't it?
Sure, there is.
If there's somebody you'd like to kill.
WDQ-A-M, hello.
WDQ-A-M!
Take another deep breath.
Come on.
You can do it.
WDQ-A-M, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Um, yeah, it's far too go bomb and maintain.
I'm going to vote for maintain.
I don't think Obama has any experience, but I think he is willing to lose the war.
Oh, right.
Yeah, start quoting all of those lines.
Lose the war.
He must be calling for the right.
That guy didn't.
Right.
Oh, he's calling for McCain's ass.
He's willing to lose the war to win the election.
There's another stupid idiotic, uh, quips.
That's all they had.
He had a line, right?
He has nothing, and he has no proposals of his own McCain.
All he does is just rip Obama.
And how dare he do this?
He didn't go visit the troops, he didn't rip.
Ba, pa, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, he had a couple of smelly bomb movements.
While he was in Berlin and everyone all of a sudden the crap had been a little too long.
It was no longer his own.
Because he's a staggy old Nazi.
That's why, who never made a war he didn't like.
Seenile.
He gives new meaning. I mean Ronnie Reagan's syndrome. Forget about that. That was that was small potatoes compared to this
W2 Q. I am hello
Q. I am hello
What
He's gonna come for you to say for all that you do
He's going down. This is the other duty guy. I got a crazy
Causing some for Christian and he causing sink songs though
The what guy the duty guy his first song was about do do do do do yeah about go to hell with do do in my pants
You want to hear it no, okay good. Oh, you got it. Oh, it was a keeper. I don't want to hear it
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the road at least we're getting some new idiots. That's good
Because that's what the show is now. Neal's talked to morons for four hours. I've been down that for years
I want to say it. So what do you mean now? I mean more so than ever more than as you explained it to me years ago
Mm-hmm. I talked to idiots for four hours a day a lot of money. What a scam. That's correct. That's right
And now I've gotten a few bedtime stories here, but you know what I don't want. I don't want to read them
I'd rather spend the entire day today and then again on Thursday talking to idiots and then I'll be on vacation for like 12 days
Skame isn't even the word for it
scandalous scandalous right Q a n. Hello. Hello. Yeah, sir
Because of your Corvette
Fixed fiber glasses and much easier and better thing than working on metal
Why is that because just when you fix it it's usually stronger and there's no
from when it crackles you know and
So you're much better off having a vet getting fixed in a regular car. Oh, wait
No way they can they can when you when you bump a regular car
It just puts a dent in it and they can push it right back out
You can't do that with fiberglass because it cracks. Yeah, well you just grind grind the cop the crack and then put some new glass under and stand it down
And it's like new and it's all scraped and scrunched on the right side there. You won't be able to tell
Okay, I'll go I'll go work on it right now. You finish the show
See ya. Well there you go. That's now there's a guy that sounded really optimistic. Do you believe it?
Who knows I'm not a fiberglass expert. Well, why not? Well, I have worked on it, but still we've worked on what fiberglass and votes
And and they might not have to replace the whole panel it all depends
If you could see it. I mean, it's not it's not like it was a major crash or something like that
But it was it was
Collision you know something to be can be patched
One way or another with fiberglass they cut away the area and then
Remold some fiberglass into the area
Maybe they just put silly putty in there sounds good and painted blood
I'm sure
I can't and you know something ordinarily that would just it would have devastated me to think because I'm one of those people that looks at my car like it's
Pristine you know, I mean either that's a 2004. It's only got 5,000 miles on it
And it's like clean and pristine a clean machine mind, you know, and now it's like
No matter what you do to fix it up. It's gonna be always used goods. You know what I'm saying? Mm-hmm
So I should probably go treat it in I think it should and of course with the great bargains on cars they have here
I think probably for like 80 grand I can get my I mean nice new vet
Boy they talk about a rip off. What's that all about boot?
Dodo prices on cars here. You know, I could have gotten it the solstice for like half the price in
Buffalo for example, I could have gone to Buffalo and bought it and driven it across the border
Wouldn't that have made a lot of sense? Sure
What do I know though?
What do I know about a Pontiac solstice? Oh, I saw a neat car the other day. What else it called it say?
What the hell was it the kind of a car? Oh, it's it's you go you go like a rounded back rounded rear end mm-hmm
I'll think of it. It was really neat. I never see one before
And I stepped up and I looked in the a little thing on the back to see what kind of a car it was and it was a something
I don't know when you get old and see now you don't remember those was that was it a silo or something? No
It was a sign off WDQ and hello
Yes, hey, is that ProSAC Ron and Richard Rooble the rainmaker the same person?
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the Verizon and
Singular right of the line or be the point of giving out like
The numbers and then dumping it you know what I'm saying right?
But I just did that I took a little extra time just to make sure
You know like mode it's that time one one two two three
Then take it
We
They
I can have saved sex with you
I'm gonna cut my balls for a no-stress trouble free-sprue
I'm gonna cut my balls for a no-stress trouble free-sprue
I'm gonna bang every gallon down
I'm gonna cut my balls for a drink
I'm gonna cut my balls for a drink
I'm gonna cut my balls for a drink
Now I'll be free to leave
To doubt the fear of pregnancy
Such a trapman will stop
Once that I hitch up I'm gonna cut my balls
Cause I hear the painings that bad
I'm gonna get out of weight is all
And wear a feminine hat
So there it is
It makes hot boys feel high
I'm gonna cut my balls for a drink
I can have sex with me
I'm gonna cut my balls for a no-stress trouble free-sprue
1045-560WDQM
You can tell there must be nobody in town
because they had the announced attendance for yesterday's Marlins, Metskint, Marlins was 23,000 people.
I did see about two seconds of that. And it were like big chunks of orange, you know, MPC. It's
like usual. And you know that if they say 23,000, that means it would like maybe 15 or 18,000,
of which at least 10 or 12,000 had to be Mets fans. Am I right, Chris? Yeah, probably.
So, I mean, it couldn't possibly be anybody. I mean, it was the, this is the series of the season.
Even George is all whipped up about it. What? WDQAM, hello.
Hey, man, how are you doing? Okay. Good. When you cracked up, you probably hit the crack tight.
I see a panic or what? Yeah, he is. Here's the appol result. So far, we have 326 votes. Our goal
is 500. And I really doubt that we'll make it. What do you think, Chris? Probably no.
Well, there's nobody around. Who the hell is going to be there with those gigantic mosquitoes
besides the watermelons? And that humidity and oh my god. Here, it's beautiful, by the way. It's
just sunny. It's going to be like 82. Humanity is 30%. But third, man. If you could kill somebody
and get away with it, who would it be? A famous person, 108. Now, you notice we had to leave
politicians office list because we don't, that's right. We don't need any knocking on the door.
Don't go there, girlfriend. Right. George, 64. How come so many people want to kill you?
I asked because because I'm not you. So I get blamed for that. Right? People hate your ass
because you're not. Hey, that sounds pretty lame. Have anybody else fill in for you? Go ahead.
What does that mean? You watch. Watch what happens. Watch how, how loved they are.
A crank call or 31, your boss, 28, family member, 24, a neighbor, 23. Oh, yeah, that sounds good.
I can think of one. Your spouse, 21, a random stranger, 16, a homeless person, six,
an X three and co-worker, two. If you could kill somebody, how about we put on there? I couldn't kill
anybody. Okay. We got to see any people like that. I don't think I could. Oh, I'm not really
sure. I could. Could you? Oh, yeah. Easy. Not your spouse. No. How about your mom? No.
She don't her way anyway. Oh, man, it's so bad. She's got the big C. George's mom. Do you
talk about it? Yeah. She wants to see my vasectomy scar, which I don't have one because of the
the way they do think. When she wants to see your vasectomy scar, you know what I told her about?
She said, I want to see. Oh my God. So at what point at what point do you guys stop showing mom
their private? I don't know. So I set there on the table in front of her and just lean back.
WDQYM, hello. You know. Yes. I just have heard from you talk about old people in my games.
I initially thought I was a racetrack. Like the photo racetrack often. Because that's
a lot of 56. I go to a youngster. I thought, damn, when I think of what your message should do
instead of being a rac, they should have been seminal Indian reservations and came over to
get seen. You know, looking at dollars every day. Mm-hmm. I'm giving away money. Are you serious?
Yeah, you're serious, huh? Sounds like somebody's got pliers on your nuts or something. Good God.
Didn't he sound like that? Yep. Like his nuts were in a vice. WDQYM, hello.
I'd like to vote for George. WDQYM, hello.
I sure like the ending there. Real nice. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. I told you I'd bring the intellectual
collars out of the woodwork out of the closet. Oh yeah. I'm trying to think of some of the good
movie I saw since I've been on last 80 days ago. I can't, I mean, Deadbolt has heard so it's
made for TV movie. It's cheesy. It's crap. What? It's for the warning. Thanks for the warning. What?
Those made for TV movies are not often very good. No. To say the least. In the end, he dies anyway.
He's stalksery, hunts her down and he dies. He's the evil door. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. How about let's go
to church and kill some people because we don't like them liberals and them fags and dark folks and
them feminists and stuff like that. Well, that guy might think just blow his crap away and get
it over with already. Knoxville, Tennessee. Can you imagine what it must be like there? WDQYM, hello.
Well, my best friend WDQYM, hello. Can we put Neil on the pole? Yeah, sure. Thanks, Neil. Bye.
No, no problem. Maybe I can catch up to you. What do you think? I doubt it. Get me on there right away.
WDQYM are on, hello. If you don't believe in guy, then you're taking a chance to be a sense to
be a sense of hell with a dude. Oh, this guy now and now all of a sudden he's another chronic. Right.
One of your people, by the way. No yours. No, one of your people speak English. Okay.
Speaking of English, Pablo, I'm sure he's an Indian.
Indian. Yeah, he sounds like an Indian. No, he does not. Sounds totally ground to me.
Are you starting to pick on the Mexicans again? No, no. Maybe he's Peruvian. That could be.
They have Indians too. Maybe he's going to sing Inki-Dinky-Dinky-Dunas. They all got Indians.
Inki-Dinky-Dunas. Isn't that where the Incas were from? Sure. From Inka-Dunas.
Incas. Incas, my ass. I'll go get a brush. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 and pound. The ratings come out
tomorrow. The spring book, April May and junio. For all you junios. How the hell do we stay on the
air? I just don't understand it between the crappy signal and our crappy management and the fact
that there's nobody who speaks English and soft-floor anymore. It's a miracle-driven on the air.
Although some day parts. Oh, oh, oh. We're not. WDQ-YM, hello. Wonderful program. WDQ-YM, hello.
Like I said, to be a fly on the wall for just five seconds to keep the scene. No, yeah. No.
To see that scene. To be a killer. Be on the wall, maybe. WDQ-YM, hello.
You. Yeah. I think I know what Karri was talking about with the room. I'm back. It's a crossfire.
No, but maybe that was it. Who makes it? Chrysler. Chrysler. Yeah.
There are any cars. Book of Brian used to have one. I think that was a crossfire.
Crossfire. Right. Would not go with running. Maybe Bob Novak could get one and run a few people over with it.
So you. He's got a brain tumor, Bob Novak. So maybe you think that God, after all. So the car you saw. He's got one too. What?
Was it a small, sporty, two-door kind of thing with rounded back? Yeah. Yeah. Crossfire.
Really neat looking. There neat looking. The Chrysler cars are neat looking.
And I'm done. Period. But not neat driving. Oh, we got a lot of Chrysler sponsors.
What's all this at me? In other words, you're not going to be able to pin in? No. Good. Keep it that way.
Don't be knocking any of our fine sponsors, especially with the economy, the way it is in the crapper.
It's right. Nobody's got two nickels to rub together. Nobody's got one nickel to rub together.
346 votes on the pool. We're creeping and crawling toward 400. What I saw a bowl was 350.
WDQAM. Hello. QAM. Hello. Yes. Yes. Yes. Sir, speaking. Jimmy, Buffalo. Yeah.
Yeah. Well, well, canal. I was born. Wonders. Neil. Remember that. Let me ask you a question. Let me ask you this question.
Sure. Because you're not having a conversation. You said, I want to speak to Neil. I said, speaking.
And you're talking in like parts of sentences, you know? I saw you. Yeah. No, I was just a child that loved an area.
Yeah. Yeah. I know you were a potato down fan too and they're opening up this week. No, I was not a
potato down style. I was there. I did a show from there. Potato. I never cashed a ticket at
a video. Yeah. Well, some of the worst racing I've ever seen in my life. And then,
Ellie and Gonzalez. Now I want to know. Well, you're sure I tell you. You're sure all of us from
love. Love canals and potato down to alien. Gonzalez. One thing on Ellie and Ed.
You I years ago, you said they should have fired that little toothless, death, burrowed,
back to Cuba, ever can and on pay per view. And I was with you 100% on that. And if we could have
gotten king behind it. Okay. Great. Well, obviously, love canal affected your brain. Wow.
That's where they had all that pollution. No, love can answer radiation or something.
Or something. Yeah. Obviously, the poison in badly dangerous chemicals.
In the beginning when he was talking like in the like pieces of sentences, you know? Love
canal, Ellie and Gonzalez, like whatever. But these are the intellectuals, man. This is America.
For these people, a lot of them are going to be voting to in November. Yeah. Scary.
Just like that guy in the church in Knoxville, man, he would have been voting in November
if he weren't on the inside. I wonder who he'd have been voting for.
WQAM. Hello. Q.A.M. Hello.

Oh, in the idiot.
Retire.
11.02 at 5.60 W.A.M.
Happy Tuesday to you.
Iguela is in Gabon in West Africa.
Okay.
What?
Nothing.
I don't believe me.
Of course I believe you.
Why would you lie about that?
Or anything else?
You're well.
Like George said, the Joe Bell is the anti-Christ.
I'll tell you that right now.
It's what he said this morning.
Instead of his clearance, you'd die a wicked death
and he'd be more than happy to participate.
No.
No what?
No.
No.
He's not on the hit list.
Why not?
He'd be online.
I'll tell you that right now.
He'd be near in the top five,
top 10.
Well, then I'll have to worry about taking care of that.
I'll do it.
I'll take care of it.
Hey, Clarence.
Hey.
WQIM.
Hello.
I'm a QYM.
QYM.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes.
Well, I used to call you a long time ago.
I used to call you almost every day
and big mighty kind of remember.
Yeah.
Well, I used to be a push supporter
big time remember.
In a day?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Is there a point you were trying to make
or do you know how sweet that memory is still in time?
I have changed my mind.
I'm going to be for Obama.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye, Mariko.
Bye.
360 votes on the pool, man.
We're not going to make no 500.
Unless I walk Chris.
I'm going to walk unless you start pushing it a little bit.
Let's go.
Make it a little bit because you don't have
any free food coming in.
There's no excuse to be a slight enough.
You heard what I said.
Let's go.
People make me happy.
Get 500.
I'm not going to make me happy.
I don't care.
We get five votes on here.
It's no what off my fan ass.
It's not going to get my vet fixed.
So how much do you think?
I don't know.
Well, you don't have a picture of it.
I mean, I could go down to find my camera.
No, I assume not much more than a grand or so.
Really?
Well, I sure hope you're right.
I mean, I've covered what?
You're right.
It depends because sometimes they can patch it or replace it
without replacing the whole pan.
Patch my ass.
Are you crazy?
All right.
I'll go get the fiber.
I'm going to patch it.
It's it's correct.
Don't you understand?
I do, but fiber class can be worked with.
That collar was really?
Yes.
You can work out.
It all depends.
Why I sure hope you're right.
That would be sweet.
Just enough to make you cry.
Once it's over,
instant that second that moment
out of your lifetime.
And you wish you could have it back again.
You know what I mean?
I can if I could just go back to driving into the parking garage
one more time and not do that.
You know, and then pay attention.
Can't do it.
Nope.
Doesn't work that way.
WDQA-M.
Hello.
I mean, I'm not bottom.
QA-M.
Hello.
Hello.
I don't believe you don't have a C6.
Call of that.
Why not?
You've got no one ever here, don't you?
No, I don't.
This is that any with a fatty pattern again.
Oh my god, you fairy.
I want your vet.
Oh, get out of here.
You can afford a model car, you jackass.
You simpleton.
Why didn't he all of a sudden come?
I know.
Thank god he's only calling you though.
Oh my god, he was gone for a year.
Sure.
The queen with a fatty pack.
And now all of a sudden he's back.
Another one with a distinctive annoying voice.
I look like I nerd.
Like a professional nerd.
A Yorker.
Oh my god.
A fate worse than death.
Let's put him on a list.
I don't have any votes yet.
I'm on the list.
Nobody wants to kill me yet.
Am I right?
You're right.
None.
WDQA, I feel left out.
QAM, hello.
Hey, Neil, how's it going?
OK.
I'm reading in a paper today and then this comes to know
about this house speaker, Rubio.
He's fighting this thing with the 21, the blackjack.
What is his parents stupid crusade for?
I don't understand.
One time we get some little bit of entertainment.
A lot?
A little bit of what?
Entertainment.
Oh, I guess he's a illogic,
legitimate child of rotten child because you know,
I walk in a lot and didn't want us to have gambling either.
And I just don't understand why somebody's going to reign
on our parade all the time.
What about Jeff Bush?
How can we let go?
That's another one.
Yeah, that's another one I left out.
Sorry about that.
Yeah, fat ass, Jeb.
What are the guys that call the Lulwagons
that says that, um,
Moroccan have any experience?
Well, I mean,
why are you, are you, are you?
Oh, please, go away.
He's taking that serious.
You know, the guy with the clown, it was the Lulucaine line.
We have our talking points.
Don't you understand?
Yeah.
Oh, Campbell Brown, by the way, is a feminazi.
I just thought of a mention.
I outed her a long time ago on CNN.
And over the weekend, I read this article about her
and about her husband as a right-wing operative.
And she's just just a total fulny baloney.
CNN is trying to outfox the Foxmeisters.
Isn't that sad?
Yep.
Thank God for Keith Obram, and that's all we got.
That's all we have.
They got that, uh,
Israeli apologist Wolf Blitzkrieg there,
the A-Pack guy on CNN.
Jack Cavarty is okay in small doses.
I like the emotion.
And Lou Dobs, he just always pissed off, you know?
Yeah.
And everybody, you don't like the Democrats
to Republicans, the illegal aliens, he hates you.
He wants to kill all of them.
Sure.
Go for it.
And the middle class, the poor, middle class,
the poor downtrodden middle class.
That's right.
He's right.
Fat face turd, Lou Dobs.
Somebody QA and hello.
Of wellos, Madre, they all examine young rabbits.
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
During the alien days, remember that she was
checked out his private to see how he had grown
so the specific gruesome?
Yeah.
And of course,
anybody with a good memory.
I'll find it.
I'll find it.
Oh, that's what she said.
You call that a penis?
Right.
Probably with a heavy accent though, she said it.
I've added.
Maybe she was from, uh, iguela.
It's in, uh, what is it in Gabon?
Gabon, man.
Gabon.
Jam on it.
Isn't Gabon a kind of hand?
Does that mean habon French?
How about?
How about his head in Spanish?
In Spanish, right?
What is it in French?
I don't know.
I'll go ask a fraud.
Gabon.
We?
We we.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,
pound, 5, 60.
I think everybody's a little bit punchy.
Maybe that's why I drove into the wall on Sunday morning.
Maybe it's that, maybe they loose on that crazy gas, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
I've got to lose some crazy gas.
In fact, over the weekend in the shower,
Gabon was such a wonderful experience.
I wonder if anybody else tries that now that I promote that on the air.
It doesn't cause any damage.
Try it.
Well, there are probably a lot of people that have never had that experience.
I doubt it.
What?
I doubt anyone has ever lived.
Just farting in the chair, I'm talking about enjoying the,
the mingling of the aroma, the steam from the hot water.
I'm sure it's universal.
Get out of here, your favorite universal.
Sure.
Nobody's gonna admit it.
Very few people, I should say.
Although, who now would admit smack in their beautiful corvette into the wall?
Right?
Or poop in their pants?
Exactly.
That's me.
I admit to a lot of stupid things because I'm a stupid guy.
I'm just human.
I'm subhuman.
And I got three votes.
All right.
WDQA M, hello.
QA M.
Oh, wait a minute, what's that?
What?
Oh, not connected to a server.
We're having issues again in the middle of the show now.
All of a sudden out of nowhere is your internet down?
Wonder bar.
No, I'm not surfing like a fool.

Yeah.
Sort of.
I took correction high school.
Oh.
All right.
Situation.
I'm 20.
My girlfriend's 40.
My parents hate it.

Tom to mind your own business.
That's what I say.
Good.
You're the best thing.
You're the best thing to happen to radio.
I love you.
OK.
See you.
Send me a picture.
Send me a picture.
Maybe we can ditch the bitch.
His parents don't like it.
Who cares whether you're an adult.
You're 20 years old for Christ's.
All these meddling parents sticking their nose
and everybody's business.

Oh God, Father Tree was on again over the weekend.
I've seen that.
I'm sorry.
Well, pieces of it.
No idea what's the whole thing.
Anything I'm crazy?
Yes.
And I read some of the reviews on IMDB and some of these.
It is, oh, Maria.
Sophie A. Coppa is so beautiful.
Oh.
Rack things not too.
She's so beautiful.
I'm going to tell you if she's beautiful, then a pile of cow crap must be just gorgeous.
Good God.
Oh, and I saw there was a guy I would buy in yesterday and you'll never guess who he looked like.
The twin brother of any had dark sunglasses on inside a casino.
He was playing a machine, losing his ass, by the way.
He looked like Stan Major and Dre.
Her.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's saying, wrinkly leathery skin you know in that piece of complexion.
Although he wasn't smoking a show.
He wasn't.
Gagging on a show.
He looked just like Stan Major.
I understand still alive.
You think so?
Probably.
My two granddaughters would be worth a million by now, wouldn't you think?
I'd like to.
WDQYM, hello.
He wants to put that crazy weapon on the pole.
WDQYM, hello.
I'm going to.
QYM, hello.
I'm from you?
Yes.
This is about 15 years ago you did a poll.
It was a blow into butter or margaret.
What was the outcome of that?
You know something I was thinking about the word A-hole just now.
You know what I was saying?
I can't say that word, but we can say.
Brackdomhole.
What do you think?
Sure.
Better ask Joyce.
I mean we can't say A-hole, but we could say.
Brackdomhole.
Right.
Like that last collar.
Brackdomhole.
Five, six, seven, oh five, six, you do you have any lady collar today?
Last time I was out and we had three lady collar, is there or whenever a week you go today.
Right.
You must have been a record.
And you were out sick.
That's because you were out sick.
That's what they call the ladies.
Probably a lot of the ladies voted, they want to kill you.
Probably.
Because you're leering.
You're leering your alleged.
I'm a lurch.
You're a predator.
Chedren 85 vote on a pool and George has got 72.
You're a very strong second place way ahead of the crank collars.
Which I think that's a very bad decision by the audience.
We put them on late.
WQA and hello.
They'll catch up.
I go out your mind.
QA and hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah, good morning, Neil.
When is the, can you put the Reverend Al Shartin on the pool?
No.
Well, thank you.
You're welcome.
You know what I mean?
I don't have individual names on there.
Except he's stupid.
Except George and me.
Well, that's because we do the show.
We don't have individual names on there.
That would be bad.
In addition to which end of the list could be like 7,000 names.
A hundred thousand.
Let's just take the, all the phone books from everybody.
All the white pages.
There you go.
Everybody on there.
And you select somebody that you want to kill.
Schmuck.
WDQYM, hello.
I'm Neil and Shartin from the Met.
WDQYM, hello.
Neil.
Yes.
If I do want to send you pictures up to your work email.
What?
If I do want to send you pictures to your work email.
No.
Do I have another email?
No.
Call Joe Bell.
Who can you be my email?
Joe Bell.
Right.
Amen.
There's a smart card.
There's the best color of the year so far.
Joe Bell sucks to which I would say.
Absolutely correct.
Yeah.
I try to tell you.
You wouldn't listen to me.
Oh no, this is a guy who's going to be great.
He's a really, you know, hands on.
Yeah, hands on.
You're back.
With a knife.
390 vote just like that.
Bits is, you know.
Smile in your face and shake your hand to quickly walk away.
With his voodoo doll.
He's got voodoo doll.
He's six pins in.
You and me.
Oh, he loves you.
He loves the job you're doing when I'm not, you know.
Don't ever send me another email.
You know, I'm going to tell you if anybody else was my agent.
The thing with the crank callers, you know, we have.
Yeah.
That would have been taken care of a lifetime ago.
Right.
Or else, they would have been sued.
That's all.
Very simple.
No, very simple.
You follow the straighting order.
That's right.
It's very, make a little bit of an effort.
That's all to support the show and to do something to support the radio station and the programming.
But they're not interested in programming.
All they're interested in is cost cutting.
Don't do this.
Don't buy paper clips on it.
And so do the thing.
Hey, you're not being fair.
They're also interested in driving the numbers down to a zero.
Well, they've done that already at night.
Oh.
And when the book comes out tomorrow, maybe some other day parts will have a point.
Oh.
Like two to four.
I thought I'm trying to pick on jerks because he don't need to be picked on.
He speaks for himself.
Come on, Acha.
With the most bizarre.
I mean, what is it?
Come on, Acha.
What is it?
What is that?
How about that?
I mean, when you thought that jolly joe couldn't have due the Kenny and boom a little morning show.
Surprise.
You know, I actually think that they could do much worse.
And I think they will.
They could do much worse than what?
Then Jack's than any of the other shows that we have on here.
I think they'll keep replacing the shows until we get zero.
How do you do worse than a point?
Oh.
How do you do worse than a point?
They'll find a way.
That's often tonight, man.
You talk about a killer from Manila.
And Clares has got it on 7 to 9 tonight, like back in the old days.
Before we cut it back down to an hour because we couldn't take so many hours of a point.
Nobody can follow that.
Even a miracle, man.
Even a magician.
Even a radio magician couldn't follow the dead air of dolphins tonight.
Come on, Acha.
You're so full of crap.
They got a lot of dolphins on it.
They don't have any dolphins on it.
Yeah, they do.
They do?
Yeah.
So they actually will participate in that show because it's an infomercial, right?
Yep.
But if we want to interview them on Joe Show in the morning, they won't come on.
Is that what you're telling me?
I don't know.
They said they want to present to Marlins.
That's the Marlins that they want to come on.
Oh, the Marlins.
Joe's always pumping the Marlins.
He can't say it, but he's always pumping it.
The Marlins.
And the ladies.
I'll tell you one thing though, that Joe's got a lot of spots, man.
A lot of spots.
Yep.
I love those guys.
I love those guys.
He loves everybody.
That's a good thing about Joe Rosemaking.
He loves everybody.
Except one person I can say.
That's right.
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.
Yeah, me and me, I think that you suffer from an enlarged vagina.
That's a bull.
Oh, that was a bull.
Yeah, I have a large vagina.
How do I am?
Hello.
God.
Q.A.M. Hello.
Hey, me.
I want you to put that fat ass Chris on the ball.
That's what I like.
It's good, great on his rectum.
That's what I like to tell.
You're wondering when you were going to be famous, Chris.
I don't want that kind of famous.
Now, let's put Chris on the list.
You want to be on there?
I will.
Sure.
I put him on.
The more names we have on there, the more hopes we get.
We can put everybody connected with the show on there.
We could put clearance on there.
We put Joe on there.
Well, we already got my boss.
Yeah, but that's their boss.
You want to kill Joe Bell?
Is that what you're saying?
No, I don't.
Yeah, you do.
Not on the list.
Yeah, you do.
I don't.
You do.
I don't.
You want to.
He's not on the list.
Well, Chris is on the list.
Now he doesn't have any votes yet.
I want to see him pass me like I'm standing still.
It'll make me feel so much better about my fat cell.
I already got you.
I am.
I'm calling about the pre-core of that.
72 way.
I'm.
Hello.
Yes, we would like to talk to Joe.
It's not just the team.
We like to talk to Joe.
I always tell what you want to do, bag it.
Very, very much.
I always tell what you want to do, bag it.
I always tell what you want to do.
I always tell what you want to do.
Yes.
I always tell what you want to do.
I'll probably roll you out.
Yes, go on.
What I'll do is.
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty, pont.
See I enjoy this much better than doing all that work.
Ken Charles.
Oh, I knew you wouldn't do any show prep.
That's why I can't tell us today.
The day that I would listen to you even if I,
I mean, just insanity.
Speaking of San Major, people live in—and delusion.
Well, Mr. President, if you're listening now, when Nixon was visiting BB Robozo and
Agables, and Stan would go on here. Well, Mr. President, if you're listening now,
see I'm getting choked up talking about Stan Major that I could hear. Thanks me back to those days
when I was smoking those big fat ones. George is smoking some big fat ones. That's right. When you can,
QAN, hello.
Am I on?
QAN, hello.
Yeah, hey, Neil. I know you're not taking suggestions for the poll, but lawyers will be
good on there. A lawyer.
A lawyer?
A lawyer.
A lawyer. Any lawyer.
You'll pay for the lawyer.
I'll go and shoot him.
How about in Marlin?
Okay. A Marlin will be next, but let's start off with a lawyer.
No, let's not.
You want to put that on there or lawyer?
I don't care.
Fine by me.
You know, this guy, he says, he starts off by saying, I know you're not taking
suggestions for the poll, which way would you buy?
No, they do it anyway.
I mean, he gives me a suggestion for the poll.
No, I like that.
Like, saying, I know you don't want me to pull the trigger, the trigger.
The trigger.
What are you laughing about, huh?
I think that's it.
We can afford you.
The more-
I'm impressed.
The more-
The more-
The more-
The more-
The more-
The more-
The more-
The more-
The more-
The more-
The more-
If you missed the last show, you'll miss this.
Well then what the hell is your problem?
Kane is in New York, fella.
What he would do is show, I don't want Kane back,
I just told you that.
Well then who do you want?
Who do you want?
You want Alan Burke?
No, what's that?
I think you want Joey Reynolds?
So what's that?
They want the hell do you want in the air?
Silence?
Is that all we have?
Who do you give me a name?
But is that all we have?
Who do you want?
Is that all we have?
What kind of content do you want during two to six?
I can't.
Here the next stand major show, this afternoon at two on New
Scott Radio 6 stand, WIOD.
I've got sunshine on WINZ.
When there's a hurricane blowing vapor, it's still the month of May.
From two to six, I guess you say, what can we leave for you that way stand major?
Talking about sandwiches, sandwiches.
I've got so much honey, and it needs to be me.
He checks the form of colors while he's smoking on a stokey.
I guess you say, two to six WINZ stand major.
Talking about sandwiches, sandwiches.
You ready to be the hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Yeah, out on New York, a station on my radio.
I've got not many locked in vapor, which stand major on my radio.
All together now, everybody.
I guess you say, WINZ to stand major.
Talking about sandwiches, sandwiches.
Oh, sandwiches, letting us go, baby.
Wow, it's 1134 or 26, and that was Jane Michaels who followed me when I moved me over to Zeta and they grew up from 10 to 21 I.N.Z.
And boy, did he ever butcher up that, he sure did, Jane Michaels.
He wasn't a bad guy, he was just horrible on here.
410 votes on the pool, and then he had some kind of a scam going with cruise ships or something like that.
I figured what that was all about.
567-0560, let's get these phones smoking, baby.
I wonder if anybody remembers those days.
Those were pretty good days, the I.N.Z. days.
And I remember one day, just like tomorrow, when the book came out, and the bird came waddling into the studio, and I was sitting there, and I guess he had taken a peek.
They had given him the advance when they were getting the sheets off the fax machine.
And he held up all 10 fingers, 10 shares, that was 12 plus, 12 plus 10 shares, and the younger demos we had like double digits every year, 13, 15 shares.
We had an audience back in those days, right?
I heard that story.
And a signal, right?
And Gary Lawrence was the GM, a good guy.
We were doing radio.
Who?
W.C.Y.N. Hello.
Hi, we're here.
Q.A.N. Hello.
Hold on, Chris.
W.C.Y.N. Hello.
Neil.
Yes.
Did you know that ZZ Top did Dinkweilo?
Really?
Yes.
And?
It rhymed.
Oh, ask me if I should hear.
Wow.
Pretty weak.
Pretty freaking weak.
I thought the intellectuals would start calling it a Bible of 1115.
Chris, don't have any votes yet.
Nope.
Nobody wants to kill that Chris.
All right.
How about if they got paid by the pound?
56670560, we're looking for a lady caller would be nice.
We're looking for a caller with an IQ bigger than the Estum Nail would be nice too, but I doubt it.
On both of those counts.
And pound 560 on the Verizon singular wireless line.
W.D. Q.A.N. Hello.
They've pushed the lawsuit in your right, then?
Hmm.
That's it.
And George gave me this song and a dance before the show today.
Oh, you're going to have so many great calls today.
Yesterday was fabulous.
Yeah, that's what I said.
What else did you say?
That's what you said about me.
You said it through out of your butt.
Don't be munking around with my butt.
Don't worry.
I can't wait tomorrow to take my event to a place.
And so they can fix it up.
You know, I'm afraid it's going to look like it's going to look like patched.
You know what I mean by that?
Yeah.
Ooh.
You don't want to have a beautiful looking car with like a patch on it?
Yeah.
You're envisioning exactly what I'm thinking of.
The patch.
W.D. Q.A.N. Hello.
Hi, I'm Camille.
Oh, my God, lady.
Oh, wow.
Yes, it's your Johnny Depp fanatic friend.
Oh.
How are you?
I'm OK.
See you guys for a lady call.
I just want you to know I'm always here.
Always out here for you and for you.
Well, thank God for you because other than you, man,
we don't have much.
Well, it's all up to you.
I do those days when we used to have an audience.
Those were great days.
Those were great days.
I go way back.
I go back to, I was, I mean, I was on your show.
And I was at Nautilus, Jr. High School.
I was on a panel with, well, what was your name, the lady from Planned Parenthood?
L.I.
Linda Lai.
Linda Lai.
I think I was on, I was like, like part of a panel that was on your show.
So I go way back.
Well, I'll be done.
So I'm always here, I've been always here for you and just love your pieces.
Thanks for the memories.
Have a great day.
See you sweetheart.
You too, bye bye.
How do you like that, huh?
All the way back to the Lin-Lite days.
Mother, may I pleasure myself?
That was one of her pieces of advice.
Oh, good God.
To the teenagers, yeah.
You have to go and ask permission.
Mother, may I pleasure?
For every 19 votes on the pool, I mean, she was an isolated but all those shows.
There were some interesting people on those shows, the one of those panels.
Oh, Chris got a vote.
Let's hear it for Chris.
Oh!
If that Chris got a vote, they want to kill you.
Oh well.
And of course it only takes one, one angry guy with a gun like that guy in Knoxville, Tennessee.
He didn't like them.
League roles and faggots and schwarzos and like that.
He didn't like that.
And he couldn't get a job.
So go in there and kill some people.
And then he figured that the cops would blow his ass away but didn't work out.
Now he's going to be spending a lot of time on the inside.
421 vote.
I think you might make your 500 today, Mr. Fat.
Cool.
WQA-N, hello.
Q-A-N, hello.
WQA-N, hello.
Morning, Neil.
Good morning, sir.
I just called to see if you were keeping track of them Cubbies.
Yeah, I see they're just hanging on by a thread.
They're hanging on?
Why don't you get a life-serve?
Do you have anything else going on in your life beside the stupid baseball game?
Ah, the Cubbies.
Yeah, that's it.
Okay.
In other words, I have no life.
Right.
The Cubbies.
The Cubbies.
You're following the Cubbies?
No, I see that they're just, but they won yesterday so they're back in first place again.
But just after they blew a good lead.
After they blew a several game lead, now they're just barely hanging on.
It's not even August yet for a couple of days.
Talking about a June swoon.
By the time September comes, they're going to be so far into behind you won't even believe it.
And how about those marlins?
The marlins won yesterday, aren't you excited, George?
Aren't you ready to make a donation for that white news statement?
The biggest name of the year is the new rocket rocket.
You'll buy a rocket rocket for the marlins.
Fourth leader, you're a bastard.
Eight sounds that you hate.
But I'm an idiot and I think they're really great.
I doubt that you can't handle one or two.
Much less or eight.
Eight sounds that you hate.
Come in from the boys, they will surely separate.
I tell you what they are.
Guaranteed, you'll go, yeah!
I like fingernails on a blackboard.
People crack their neck for their nipples.
When I rough style a phone together, that just makes me shuck.
Eight sounds you can't stand.
Would you tolerate if you were a handsome man I am?
And to the list of eight, a fork and a knife scraping on a plate.
Scraping on a plate.
Scraping on a plate.
Here's one I really love.
You might want to try it.
Give me feedback in my headphones.
Oh yeah, that's more like it.
Little more, little more over there, little more.
Eight sounds so unique.
Now let's review so you can really, really free.
Figure a nail, sign up for that.
When people crack their neck for their nipples.
Rub his eye, we're both together.
Causing makes me shuck.
I like brand new sneakers on a gym floor.
Rating in a lumen or window.
When it gets in, it's drilling my mold.
That makes me say, no!
My boy singing on his record.
You tets all on fine china.
And these have give you the shivers.
That makes you a whiner.
Hey, do you go nuts if someone fights their fork like this?
Cause I love it.
Here, I'll do it again.
Do you have a nervous system left?
How about the squeegee wiping a window I cracked my neck?
Suprae wits, suffer wits.
Oh wait, I got one more.
And then of course it's always the famous fat 13-till-noon at 560 W.
Q.M.
Almost halfway home here today.
How do you like that boys and girls?
Let me see it again.
Oh wow, wait, spectacular.
Woo!
Oh, you are.
Don't die yet.
He's trying to kill you.
Yeah, I think so.
Well, here's the poll.
If you could kill somebody and get away with it, who would it be?
A famous person, 112.
Oh, I got to know.
We have 435 votes.
Chris has got two.
Oh, look at that.
I printed it out on a premature evaluation here.
Wait a minute.
435.
A famous person, 112, which could be 80,000 names on that list.
George 73.
I couldn't kill anybody 56.
A crank call or 35.
Sounds like a real plan to me.
Your boss, look at that.
BOT 3rd, man.
Neighbor 26.
Family member 25.
Your spouse 25.
Hey honey!
Random stranger 17.
Co-worker 10.
And X8.
A homeless person 6.
I don't understand that.
Neil 5.
I understand that.
Chris 2.
You're starting to make a move.
A pedophile 2.
Good choice.
435.
You're going to make your 500, I believe.
Oh, now that they want to kill me, yeah.
But that's not the important number.
The numbers that are important are coming out at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning when the spring arbitrage rating book,
the quarterly rating book, comes out.
Not just a trend.
It's the book.
And you know what they say?
The good book says.
Joe Bell is a dismal failure.
He just keeps on keeping on.
Doesn't that kind of like amaze you?
I've always noticed that in this business.
Not just here, but especially here.
Remember the Pete Boulder factor?
We used to discuss it all the time like how come?
Yeah.
A perfect record of failure and you still keep getting hired and raises and promotions and everything.
Everything that you've done has been a failure.
But he knew where to stick his tongue.
Well, he made me.
That must be what it's all about.
That is what it's all about.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.
And they've arrived in singular rivals line.
A dearth of call on the board right now.
It's pretty weak.
Pretty pretty weak.
Let me tell you there right now.
I can't even begin to imagine why all the stuff going on in the world.
What's going on?
Now what's the movie I'm supposed to see Eastern Prime Law?
This is no watch of my son.
I don't want to watch that.
Why not?
It's a classic story.
It's got way Ray Wallston in it.
If you don't like it, you can punch me in the stomach.
WDQA and hello.
Yeah, I'd like to know how many crisps are best for me.
Okay, great.
Go away.
Don't go away, man.
Just go away.
You're annoying.
You're irritating.
You're obnoxious.
You're disgusting.
You're pathetic.
You're sad.
You're tragic.
I have no life.
Aha, and that too.
Revenge, putz.
Revenge, McGiggy.
Revenge, Schmendrich.
And I've just obsessed with you to a point of like,
I'd be real nervous about him.
Oh, yeah.
You know what you're always saying about crazy people?
I know.
I'm scared of living crap on what's me.
Today is Woodbind Tuesday, by the way, for me.
I'm going every day now lately, and I've been winning.
Let's see, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
That's four days in a row, I want.
I don't know how.
Because the fool and his money are soon farted.
And playing the slots is a recipe for disaster.
But...
Friday, I hit three grand on the $1 wheel torture machine,
which I'm playing those a lot less these days.
Quick hit, be careful.
When you get a good machine,
and you get a lot of those free games and stuff like that,
you're okay.
But if you get the dead machine mine,
it just sucks up to my...
Big time.
Like, you're just feeding it.
Don't find a gun.
Don't keep feeding a hungry machine.
That's my advice while you suckers out there
that think you're going to make a living.
Anybody tells you they're making a living gambling?
There may be like ten people in the world
that really make a living gambling.
Maybe ten.
And one thing I've discovered about most people
who pretend to make a living gambling, they're liars.
They're liars.
I mean, me over the period of time, I lose my ass.
And I admit it, and I'm not pretending to be a professional gambler.
Certainly not playing slots.
George Lies playing slots.
Sure.
W.A.M. Hello.
W.A.M. Hello.
You be going to the end of the...
All right, I've been missing that, the child.
If we go to LA and to Canada, I've been missing that thing.
How'd you like to see that, whatever that is?
No thanks.
I think it's a bastard from a basket.
Baster from a basket?
I must admit this, as bad as that movie is,
I guess because I've watched it three times now.
Right. There's some comedy in there.
I wasn't going to say that.
But as bad as it is, I'm like fixated on it.
I mean, I'm almost ready to watch it again.
There are some scenes that I can help you know,
doing lines from like, oh, I drink your milk shake.
If you have a milk shake, I don't know how to straw.
From way over here, I drink your milk shake.
Right.
It's hysterical.
I was just speechless for now.
The only problem is it wasn't supposed to be a comedy.
No, I know.
W.A.M. Hello.
W.A.M. Hello.
W.A.M. Hello.
How are you doing?
Okay.
I think it was last week.
Somebody had to,
one of the casinos,
the thing you want to not be pilot,
you know, a bomb of the one-off sample road.
They played in a wheel of fortune.
Yeah, they won two million bucks.
Two point two million or so?
Right.
Yeah.
That's hell of a take.
Yeah, it's not bad.
Yeah.
All right, buddy.
You just didn't know if you heard about it or not.
Yeah, we had talked about it last week, right?
Also, the sun is still shining.
And fish are jumping and summertime.
And the living is queasy.
Remember that song?
Sure.
The fish are jumping and the birds are peeing.
Pumping.
Four forty six birds aren't pumping.
Birds are laying big eggs, man.
Just like Joe Bell will tomorrow morning.
Now, how are we going to work this tomorrow?
What do you mean?
I'll hit the...
And it's not funny.
I've got to say something.
I've got to say something.
I'm sitting here today.
That's right.
Well, you didn't eat my morning.
Maybe right in the early tomorrow, getting my vet
and zip off the wig buy.
What do you think?
Why not?
So, why do you got those great numbers pumping on?
Maybe I'll spend the bonus before we even get it.
I already did.
But then I spent that last year.
Big bonus.
You'll see.
Yeah.
I'll put my breath.
WDQA.
QAM.
Uh-huh.
WDQAM, hello.
Yeah.
Hello, sir.
Yes, sir.
Are you sure he's drinking milkshakes and not tossing saffons?
Do you have to...
WDQAM, that was Woody.
QAM, hello.
Another...
Another...
Rackum hole.
WDQAM, hello.
It's a night flight.
WDQAM, hello.
One over here, Neil.
Yeah.
I'm out.
Hi, the guy over here.
Why?
I'm sorry.
K?
K?
Yeah, he kept eating cake all throughout that movie.
He wasn't just diabetic.
He was like, I don't know what.
I had to be type one diabetic because he was skinny.
But he kept eating cake and then he kept going to diabetic coma.
Nobody could figure out why.
And then of course, he had the Vatican there.
When he started getting woozy, you know.
They'd bring the orange juice and the candy cart right there off screen.
Yeah, well thank God for that.
Oh, loaded.
Oh, yeah, well you know those priests in the Vatican, man.
They like it sweet.
I like it a lot of candy.
I can't do that.
I can't do that.
I can't do that.
I can't do that.
I can't do that.
I can't do that.
I can't do that.
I can't do that.
I can't do that.
I'm going to buy the Liddett 12.
One two three four five six seven eight five eleven twelve.
It's a lices of pizza.
Oh, for me.
A-air.
A-air.
A-air.
A-air.
I said it a McCain.
Nice office.
If you like this more, I'm off.
I said it again.
Oh, nothing.
I said it a McCain.
A lot of people see you as being out of touch.
I am, uh, out of touch.
Yes.
Can you email?
I've never felt the particular need, uh, teenager.
I read emails.
Have you ever surfed the internet?
I am learning to get online myself, and I will have that very soon.
Get online myself.
Oh, is this your computer?
Yes.
And it certainly doesn't do anything.
Okay, there's two reasons for that.
One, it's not plugged in.
And two, it's a Commodore 64.
It's like a computer from 1982.
You can't even play pong on this thing.
I have very, very great lack of experience and knowledge of the issue.
Oh, wait a minute.
What's this?
An 8-track player.
Oh, dude.
And I haven't the slightest...
Wow.
A beta max.
Is this thing work?
Oh, no.
Of course not.
Homer.
Your edge of sketch is broken too.
There are a lot of fun.
What is this?
Newed edge chains of Cleopatra on stone tablets.
Dude, who are you?
Like 5,000 years old?
I am 10,000 years old.
I'm dying out of here.
What's that big puffy thing on your cheek, John?
It's 12.0205-60WDQA.
I'm happy Tuesday to you.
We got the jerk show from training camp at 2.
Any interest?
No.
From the Doffin camp.
You like the Doffins?
We love the Doffins.
We can't say it, but nevertheless.
How about the Marlins?
Marlins.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh, what?
Yeah, watch them.
I like them.
I like them.
The Marlins?
Oh, good.
And you want to be one of those people putting some money in the till for their new stadium.
No, I watch them on TV.
And you don't want really pisses me off along with many other things.
Guess who's on on the weekend now?
A lot.
I'm CNN.
Rick?
Sanchez.
Yes.
I am personally offended by the fact they put him on here, even to say hello.
The melodramatic, the theatrics that he's resorted to now make his old days of Channel 7 pay
a little to win significance.
That's how over the top he is.
Bad, blah, blah, blah.
But there's just Spastic.
Spastic, Ricky Tiki Sanchez.
And this is CNN's idea of news.
Oh my God.
Of anything.
WQAM, hello.
Hello, that camp.
QAM.
QAM, hello.
WQAM.
Yes.
QAM.
What's your father's mom's dad?
What's your father's dad?
What's your mother's mom's mom's dad?
I'm going to be gay.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
Right.
Oh.
There you go.
That's sizz it all.
In fact, maybe we could send him just to the stadium to hang out all day every day.
We can get like a cot, you know?
Mm-hmm.
A tent.
A gun.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Boy, you're right.
It's a little sparse, but they really are great.
Oh, yeah.
When they're good.
They're good.
And when they're gone.
Yeah.
WQAM, hello.
Hello, Neil.
Hello.
Yeah.
Bad boys.
I'm 68 years old.
Yeah, like a story.
I'm a caller.
Yeah.
So anyway, the restaurant thing on Thursday, if you listen on Thursdays to hear our
news, we're going to be doing a lot of things.
We're going to be doing a lot of things.
We're going to be doing a lot of things.
We're going to be doing a lot of things.
We're going to be doing a lot of things.
We're going to be doing a lot of things.
We're going to be doing a lot of things.
We're going to be doing a lot of things.
We're going to be doing a lot of things.
We're going to be doing a lot of things.
We're going to be doing a lot of things.
We're going to be doing a lot of things.
We're going to be doing a lot of things.
We're going to be doing a lot of things.
We're going to be doing a lot of things.
We're going to be doing a lot of things.
WDQAM.
Hello.
QAM.
QAM.
Yeah, it sounds like somebody is looking there.
Rectome.
That's what it sounded like to me.
WDQAM.
Hello.
Ronnie and Ricky.
Ricky and Ronnie.
Rost have been the, must have been the, uh, sounds from Clarence's office.
Maybe Johnny Joe stopped in for lunch.
Clarence's.
Rectome.
Having a lunch for lunch.
Wins surprise me, talk about having a brown tongue like PD Bulger.
That's generally how these pumps, uh, you keep their position.
That's right.
You catch my, it's my drift.
466 on the pool.
We got 500 licks.
That's in the bag.
Now we start working on six.
QAM.
Hello.
We print.
WDQAM.
Hello.
Three more days, you know, you'll stop taking calls.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Turn the clock back.
Let's have some instant rewind and hear about that.
How many months has he been telling us I'm going to stop taking calls?
Never going to happen, sir.
Never going to happen.
The last day, the last show, there'll be calls up the S, which is where most of these belong
and where most of these are coming from.
Rectome.
WDQAM.
Hello.
WDQAM.
Hello.
Oh, Koneo.
Three more days.
Yeah.
How you doing, sir?
Okay.
How about that Jimmy Danny Stead?
You know, you want to give him a little force?
No.
I just played it on, I just played it the last week.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I like to hear it.
It's a little bit of a bad...
Too bad.
No chance.
I like to hear it.
Maybe he can just sit there and say to himself, you know, Jimmy and Danny, Danny and Jimmy,
he can do ever a couple hours, keep him off the street.
David Woodley.
WDQAM.
What are you laughing about, David?
What is dead?
It's a funny name.
Hello.
Go on, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Neil, Michael Cleen.
Have you seen that movie yet?
What movie is that?
Michael Cleen, we're George Cleen.
I don't even know how big fan of George Cleen.
I don't think what.
I can't tell you how much he's cleaning.
He makes me physically ill.
It looks pretty good.
I mean, you want to give it a shot, you know.
No.
Anyway, hey, Bob, the chain on the near organ being the movie together.
I hope it's not the disaster.
It's coming out sometime this year.
And District B-13, I'll give my review tomorrow on the George Cleen's show.
Send it to on WQAM.
That's 560 WQAM.
460.
Fort is first radio station.
It's 4th station of the year.
That's 560 QAM.
I don't know.
Wow.
That one of your reporters must be.
You don't know who that is?
No, of course that's not.
It's not about when your regular is something like he had a regular slot on your show.
No, he's an irregular of anything.
What happened to the quarter-shlock guy?
Maybe somebody killed him.
He ought to be on the pool.
I mean, we have generically chronic collars on here.
But how about the quarter-shlock guy?
I think we ought to put him on separately.
Okay.
Sure.
Quarter-shlock guy.
Make sure you put an SH.
Because that's what he's full of.
SH.
Put that under quarter-shlock.
WQAM, hello.
WQAM, hello.
WQAM, hello.
WQAM, hello.
Hello, Nell.
Would you hop Sid Rosenberg?
WQAM, hello.
Vanilla?
Yes.
Why don't you have Victor Borgan to tickle your Iberis?
Hello.
How long do you work on that?
About half an hour.
Mm-hmm.
Keep working on it.
Nothing's going to happen.
Just keep working on it.
Rub it raw.
5670560.
pound 560 under Verizon's singular wireless.
And we had a lady today.
OO!
How do you like that?
Yeah.
I don't know.
A couple.
Did you?
I think so.
Usually I have a couple three.
Get on it here.
Is he making that up, Chris?
Probably I have like, you know, two or three.
And Chris is catching me on the pole.
Yeah, I am.
I saw that.
I got five and you got four.
And you're going to get what four if you don't watch it.
There are four people want to kill your fat ass.
I guess I can't leave the station anymore.
WQAM, hello.
Hoping out of all.
I'd be real nervous next time I started my car with my fat ass in it.
And don't let me drive.
I'll probably run into a wall.
I still can't believe I did that.
But like I said, I'm not, maybe once upon a time,
I would be devastated by like, oh my, how did I do that?
But yeah, I'm at the stage of my life when crap happens, you know.
That's the only way you can look at things.
Crap happens.
Like if you have a bad day at the track or something.
It's where it goes.
You can't win them all, right?
Just be philosophical.
Don't get all like all drama.
Save the drama for George's mama.
WQAM, hello.
Dr. and John and Doran is putting his board up.
Hoping out of the corner.
Yeah, but he wants to take a leak next to Neil at the IOD.
When he writes the Johnny Dolen autobiography,
that's going to be one of the whole chapter about that,
how he once took a leak at the urinal next to me,
and how he was so pleased and proud.
God.
Maybe he was proud because he was peaking.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, talk about lifeless.
Johnny Dolen, that's what they basically done over there at IOD.
He's taking about your rejects and put them on here.
Like your friend Manny.
My friend, Manny.
Manny from Kindle.
Yeah.
He used to be a caller.
I know.
I know the whole story.
Oh, look at that.
Look inside to get their perspective on this as well.
You heard the name.
You saw it with people.
Oh, my allergies are acting up.
The biggest name.
The best.
You're the most likely to find sixty-two AM.
The fourth leader.
I already have a homosexual relationship with NEO,
so I might as well have one with you too.
You've seen him on Channel 7 News.
First, as a two-bit reporter.
Now, as a two-bit anchor, that wears more makeup than Tammy Febecker and Mary Kay combined.
Rick Sanchez, Ains.
Here are the dulls and tones of the men who brought you Clonjack.
Rick Sanchez.
Rick Sanchez.
Rick Sanchez.
Rick Sanchez.
Rick Sanchez.
Don't miss Rick Sanchez in his pasty face, Thor over Hylia.
It's one show you all want to miss.
Take for a good one.
Oh, no.
Rick Sanchez.
He loves his audience.
I accept you as a precious gift from God.
Oh, God!
So guess what's being discontinued?
The Christ or Crossfire.
I just googled it.
Oh, after this year, I'm a finito.
That's because they weren't selling at him.
Guess what else is being done?
This is a major piece of breaking news.
Yeah.
You know how they're always putting on the talking head and that we're spraking news.
You know what?
They put a breaking news sounder out there.
Pick it just for the central press.
Wait.
Guess what restaurant change abruptly closes doors except for one place.
I don't let him give me a hit.
What?
Let him.
Oh, really?
Hmm.
I like let him.
Me too.
Just fun.
But I never ate there and that's probably why they closed that.
You're like this but we didn't go there and that's, you know, that's a problem.
Do what you want says breaking news?
Yeah.
Goldie's coming back.
What?
It's coming back.
I thought I heard his voice yesterday while we were going to the show.
Like walking by the hall too.
He's coming back.
That's the looking guy.
The squeak master is coming back.
Up the button.
Oh my god.
You've got to be kidding me.
Why would I kid about a thing like that?
How can he do that?
There's a theory.
I'll share it with you.
Once you've been on the air, they'll always give you another job on the air somewhere.
But then here's another theory in this place here.
Sports if you fail, they'll bring you back to failing.
Yeah.
And then all you have to do is talk about sports and it doesn't.
Nothing else matters.
If you talk about the game, nothing else matters.
Even if you fail.
Oh my god.
100 times.
And what's he going to be doing?
Two to four?
Yes.
Are you serious?
Are you serious?
No, I'm serious.
I'm serious.
Are you doing this for my benefit or what?
No, he's going to be doing two to four.
Tell him the expression on my face right over here.
I know, he's stone, stone faced.
Mm-hmm.
Stone to faced.
Yeah.
I mean, that's the popular rumor.
You want to date too?
Are you buying?
What?
Sorry, are you buying?
Yeah.
It's on me.
Goldie is coming back.
Don't you remember that Goldie was on two to four and he had a one point?
What does it matter?
Oh.
A one point.
Oh.
I know it's two hours.
I told you they could figure out a way to get those numbers lower.
How about that?
Wow.
And what is this going to allegedly happen?
Except after first.
Come on that shit.
And what's going to happen to Jerks?
Come on that shit.
What's going to happen to Jerks?
Bite, bite, bite.
Bite, bite, bite.
Yeah.
Bite, bite, bite.
Oh.
Don't plan on catching Lens and Benagons the chain is closed.
Now that's a bad for a sentence here because I want to Mr. Lopin in South Florida.
Channel 4 is important.
Yeah, which one?
I'll tell you in a second if you shut up.
Channel 4 is important.
Channel 4 is important.
Benagons.
I'll throw a paper for the battle.
W-D-Q-A-M-HOW.
Hello?
Yes.
Hey Neil.
Yeah.
Thank God for the ladies because this way I can talk to you and then hang up and then listen to the radio.
Yeah, that's my nickname.
Oh, and that was it.
Yeah.
He's off to meet the wizard.
He's off to crank it up on the radio too.
What a...
Brackdom hole.
Channel 4 is reporting that Benagons restaurant chain is shut at stores possibly nationwide,
although at least one South Florida location is still serving up burgers and beer.
The General Manager, the Benagons and 11416 North Kendall Drive Toll Channel 4,
that he received a phone call this morning informing him to cease operations effective today,
Monday was their last day of business.
Employees and management teams weren't given any warning at all.
I was amazup said as all the employees are said the General Manager wouldn't want to be identified.
When Channel 4 called a restaurant's area director, he wouldn't comment.
He was mum.
MetroMedia restaurants group in Plano, Texas, which operates Benagons,
hasn't released any statements.
They also won the stake and ale of the restaurant chains.
And like I said, I used to love stake and ale.
Yeah.
They're not all closed down, but they won by you and Hollywood.
That was a good one.
And it's a long one.
Still one in Kendall.
Benagons was founded in 1976.
The restaurant's got locations in 32 states, including six out-foto locations.
The one that's open...
In for Lauderdale, 1245 North Federal Highway.
That's it.
Open for business.
Now, why would that be?
Don't know.
They just stubborn.
Maybe they don't want to close.
Right?
The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the MetroMedia restaurant group prepared a bankruptcy
finding after allegedly violating several terms of a lending agreement with GE Capital Solutions.
This is the second major restaurant chain to close in Florida in recent months.
Roadhouse Grill, which was headquartered in Palm Beach County,
abruptly shut down locations in May.
How do you like that?
What was it back to?
That was a good place to have.
Yeah, I like Benagons just fine.
They had good soups.
Good challenge, good burgers.
Roadhouse, I can't remember the last time I ate there.
But I think maybe the last time I ate there was like on Dale Maverick in Tampa.
There was a Benagons connected to like some motel there like, I don't know.
Holiday and Express or something on Dale Maverick.
I mean, that's a long time ago.
That's years ago.
491 on your pool were going for 600.
Any chance we're going to make it?
No.
WDQA in.
Hello.
I only hope that when your sales department finally gets off their butt and gets you a sponsor for those meal deals.
But they take one that serves lots and lots of covercoins.
We need to be, we should sell it.
Lots of what?
Peppercoins.
Oh, well he's not like he was talking to like with our guy with a sock over the phone or something.
Yeah, like that.
WDQA in.
Hello.
WDQA in.
Hello.
Hey, me to my lab.
WDQA in.
Hello.
I need a beer.
I need a beer.
I need a beer.
I need a beer.
Rick Sanchez wannabe.
Now how bad can it get when your Rick Sanchez wants it?
That's pretty bad.
You reach the bottom of the barrel, sir.
Time to end it all.
Make way for something living and breathing.
WDQA in.
Hello.
Hey, Nei.
Get those going to be not coming at you.
Coming at you.
What do you think?
I see who you have a conversation.
No.
Why not?
I want to ask him what's his take on guilty coming back.
If that's true.
I think you just made it up.
How about that?
Ow!
I just can't believe that.
Why not?
I mean, he, they let him go across the street.
He walked out of there at the, I don't know.
The, the ticket ticket ticket.
I'll be, I'll fuck you up.
I just don't get it.
Well, that's your problem.
Just go out and get you something.
The guilty is coming back.
That's one of the most shocking things in radio history.
Where does guilty?
Oh, that, then.
And, and that.
Well, that should really turn it around for us.
We got Gelly coming back.
No, if he'd bring Mo back with him.
Now then, we'd have something.
Yeah, I can't say that we're on here, but then we'd have something.
Another source of the theory of nothing else.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
I'll fuck it.
No one will talk to me.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
I'm here.
Where are you?
Q-A-M, hello.
And, hello.
Yes.
What, are you, Neil?
I'm okay.
Uh, everything all right?
Let me say it again.
Just great.
Hey.
What do you got?
What do you got?
You know what you got?
Nothing.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
Neil, hello.
Yes.
B-M-M.
B-M-M.
B-M-M.
We know.
We know.
We know.
We know.
We know.
We know.
That was G-A-M, hello.
Which Panagam is still open?
I'll knock it.
Which one?
Which one?
The one in four, that was W-Q-A-M.
Which one was still open?
You don't go to Panagam.
You would know where to find it with both of your people.
Where is it?
open where's it not gonna tell you what's that I'm gonna tell you
W. K. Ray M. Hello a. N. L. yes what's your opinion what should we do about

And the girls went to double D, and the girls went to double D.
He's gonna have a sailing force car to give a ball as man's in key, give a ball as man's in key.
Had you heard me guys' concerns?
He doesn't want to say it's a funny thing, but I don't want to be his own TV.
I don't want to be his own TV.
So while he tries to hit him, he feels the fall.
In the text, we're going to be called a sail of night from the sea.
Like a sail of night from the sea.
And since he doesn't want to be his same, he knows where the swag of kids are going to go.
They're coming to get us into junction from the surface.
They're coming to us now.
I was going to have a little ball of death, but if you're struggling in the event,
there's nothing left for you to say.
You need to hold a double D.
He ran.
He ran.
He ran.
You're fairer.
You gotta give her half your stuff.
He ran.
He ran.
He ran.
He maybe half is nothing though.
Oh, these melodies busy planting his seed.

498 votes on the pool.
I got to guess you got your 500 ligt, huh?
All right.
If you could kill somebody and get away with it, who would it be?
That means we need 100 more in an hour and a half.
Boy, that's a tall order.
We can do it on the 20th of July of Julio, El Vrantinueve de Julio.
This is a hate pool.
They can do it.
That's not a hate pool.
If you could kill somebody and get away with it, who would it be?
You don't have to hate them.
You just want to eliminate them.
Like that.
A famous person, a hundred eighteen.
I couldn't kill anybody, 80.
George, 77.
How do you like that?
It's got a radio total, 77.
WDQAM!
Like that.
But then again.
Yeah.
Where did that come from, by the way?
I guess that was one of the old jingles.
Off the cart.
Yeah.
Have we still had those?
All those old carts?
Yeah.
Okay, that's enough.
George, 77.
A crank collar, 35.
Your boss and a neighbor each have a tie.
A flat-footed tie.
Well, what does that mean?
A flat-footed tie.
There's another stupid expression.
Have you ever heard that?
Yeah, but I don't know what it means.
A flat-footed tie.
Your spouse, 26, a family member, 25, a pedophile, 20, a random stranger, 17, co-worker, 11, and X-10, a homeless person, 6,
Neil, 5, Chris, 4, and a quarter-slot guy's got three.
He's right on your ass.
I love the way you spelled it, too.
Quarter-slot.
That's right.
Quarter-slot guy.
Quarter-slot guy.
And then what do we call that idiot that you invented that called twice or rate of day?
Oh, the poop guy.
These are the poop guy?
Sure.
501 votes.
We did it.
Like David Sampson would say, we did it.
We did it.
Hey, David, you're fair.
Good.
Good.

You screamer.
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
Hi, guys.
Chris, what?
Q-A-M, hello.
Right.
Neil.
This is Lucy Lucio, who is incredible yesterday.
I really appreciate it.
Thanks for watching.
The one?
You're welcome.
Lucy Lucio.
Lucy Lopez was on?
Yeah, he, it's like non-stop.
He has nothing going on in that show, and she just brings it to a screeching halt.
What do you try to say?
Did you like it?
Oh my god.
That guy's on so much marijuana.
He has no sense of what's funny, what's interesting.
Yeah.
I don't know.
How do you like it, though, when George is on?
Get out of here.
You don't like it, don't listen, that's all.
Why do you feel compelled to call in here and rip poor George and ass?
Oh.
And Lucy Lucio.
You don't even know the freaking name.
She called herself Lucy Lucio.
No.
Oh, so why the hell can't he say Lucy Lucio?
Because he's an operating idiot.
Yeah.
Maybe he's a...
Back them whole.
You think?
Maybe.
Oh, we can't say ass.
WDQAM, hello.
QAM, hola.
How do you feel compelled to call on me, oh?
Yes, sir?
Oh, it's my last word.
The head of our day, Daniel.
Big shout out.
No.
A big shout out.
You know, I think of people who say that.
Can I give a big shout out to someone so fulfilling the black?
Mm-hmm.
You know what I think.
Yeah.
That's for whatever, whatever.
What was your name, Daniel?
And also our sympathy, too, Daniel.
56670560.560 and leave a residence in your wireless line.
WDQAM, hello.
Hey, Daniel, how you doing?
Okay.
Yeah, I had a weird cake to censorship with your radio station a couple weeks ago.
Well, believe me, we're the experts at it.
But first of all, is the ESPN own your station?
Of course not.
Okay, well, I mean, managed was having one of those same shows like, uh...
Greatest bromasses, you know, kick in, uh...
Zonka, Billy Martin, and Jack Daniels, one of those shows.
And so I called up and I said, uh...
Any guy that's sitting on his couch with his girl,
and he'd rather be staring at that one-eyed Jack Stewart Scott on ESPN,
and they cut that out.
And, uh...
And they spliced your name in with Mo.
Because I said, second place would be you and Mo, just as a joke.
And so the Stewart Scott have naked pictures of joy.
What does that mean? Why would they cut that out?
I don't know. You know, I don't know.
I don't know, maybe it's too sensitive.
I mean...
You don't even know who that is.
He's one of the talking heads on ESPN.
Oh my God.
And they spliced it out, and they spliced it in Mo and you.
I mean, uh...
And it was just, it was a very odd absurd thing.
I don't know why they did it.
It's because it's QIAM, it's because of QMF and Wayman.
Okay, all right. So, uh...
All right. Keep up the good work.
And now you know what we're up against.
I know. Take care.
See ya.
We're up against it, man.
We're up against joy.
We're up against a bunch of...
BABBLA GIDEY.
It's BABBUNES.
BABBUNES, 504 on the pullers.
We're inching toward that 600 number.
Once we get 600, I'm putting on my shoes and the pants.
Yeah.
How have we got my shirt on?
Are you going off to work?
Sure. Okay.
My shirt.
Yeah.
And then I'm my shoes.
Can't put your shoes on before your pantaloons.
I guess you could.
That's your baggie, huh?
No, there, I don't have baggie pantaloons anymore.
I used to.
I'd have some, I just don't wear it.
I think I'm going to put on those quarterways that you don't like.
I love them. What are you talking about?
You're always giving me crap about my quarterways because I love the way they sound.
Sound when the leg pant legs rub together.
Every chill.
Every step you take.
Sure.
Matter of fact,
if you're right, you can play it too.
If I want it.
Like that.
You know who didn't have quarterways on yesterday?
Who what?
You know who didn't have quarterways on yesterday?
Who didn't?
Yeah.
Well, what does that mean?
Steve Goldstein, when he went into his meeting with Joe Bell.
What, what are you talking about?
Yeah, that's a new one on me.
I didn't even hear that one.
I'm just, I'm being told that there was a meeting between them yesterday.
Yeah.
And?
That's all that we know so far.
And the squeak monster is coming back.
You've got to be schmittin' me.
Maybe he's got comin' on with Joe in the morning.
Although I know Joe would never do that again, no way.
No way, Jose.
He's too smart for that.
So two to four, Gelly's gonna squeak some more.
Have a good billboard.
Two and then two to four in here.
Gelly, Gelly, squeak some more.
The squeak monster returns to the scene of the crime.
Don't you just find it a little bit bizarre?
I mean, it's like there's a shuttle bus across 441 back and forth.
Right.
They can verbel.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Hmm.
So what do you think is that gonna be an improvement between, if he is gonna be two to four
which I think you just made that up.
Okay.
What?
I just made it up.
Now how could they find, well he never really had a show across history.
Did he just do fillings and weekends?
I have no idea.
I think so.
Chris, I believe so.
To fillin'.
He was laying to fillin'.
Boy.
I mean, you'd have to lay down and take a nap after news like that.
And I think you're both serious about it too.
No, I'm lying, I made it up.
Ah!
WQAM, hello.
I need therapy.
Mm-hmm.
Now we could put him on.
I'll say him tone is guilty.
What's your biggest name?
The best talent you've ever been in.
Get lost in the world, you're in your 550 QAM.
The sports leader.
Grab my junior, honey.
Zach, Galby.
Galby.
Talking on his sports show.
Trying to be my show.
Your boy sounds just like a seventh year old girl.
A little sports host show.
Watch else.
Are you there for Galby?
Galby.
Talking like a baby.
Rudy's a little draining.
White and chill understand.
You don't sound like a man.
Remove the rubber bands.
That joke.
Your scroll comes Galby.
Galby.
Galby.
Galby.
Galby.
Your lovely management don't care.
Because Galby.
You don't belong there on the air.
And Galby.
The sports can wait till your voice cracks.
Lost in the one who sounds like that.
That should find another job.
And they should only take you back when both your babies drop.
Galby.
Galby.
Galby.
When you're gone and grow up.
You make us want to throw up.
You fill these squeaky poop.
Go to broadcasting school.
Your freefew bass and poise.
Thank you.
Sound like a pun.
Absolutely.
You're right.
Hot.
Uh huh.
You're right.
Hot.
Yes.
You're right.
Hot.
Well, what's the news that I may never recover from?
14 to 1 and 5, 60 W and Q.A.
I'm happy Tuesday to it.
If you can keep a smile on your voice knowing that the squeakmister is on a way back.
It's kind of like there's only like a dozen people in the market who do this crap.
And they just keep shifting or shuffling them back and forth.
Like like pieces on a chessboard.
Yeah.
Moving them around and like that.
Am I right?
Yeah.
Kemp of old camper and their guilty and they'll have a lot of staying in common.
They fail.
Oh, that's not what I was saying.
I know you're going to say sports because you're so anti-sports.
No, no, I'm anti-one note Charlie's.
You're anti-sports man.
I'm anti-one note radio stations.
Anti-sports.
I'm anti-mettocasting.
Well, you're embarrassing second.
They're rolling me outside from fascinating rhythm.
There's no free win to the first race at Delaware Park.
John Burger in hand.
Six or seven lents.
Unhand in the final seven yards.
Well, you're getting second four Sally up for third.
And coming up race two at the Mettos with Roger Scream in Houston or is it Scream in Roger Houston at the Mettos.
Don't you want to hear it?
Whatever.
So what's the deal with you ever going to go back to Gulfstream?
Of course they're in our race now.
They got called her in the triple the cripple crown is all over with.
I imagine it went really well.
So I imagine that when there is something some cause we'll be back here.
Our parents there went really well.
Sure.
We'll come back and do one of those again someday.
Nah.
Maybe if Guilty would show up with us.
Wouldn't that be great?
That would be.
Oh!
Deputy QA M. Hello.
Hi, we're Buddy.
QA M. Hello.
What's the deal with that?
You're never going to go back.
Hello.
Hello.
I was going to put the crazy weapon on the death pole.
Deputy QA M. Hello.
Mr. Roger Scream.
Yes sir, speaking.
Yes.
I've caused you about three months on your last book.
And I gave you before you started taking calls and everything calls again.
I'm going to give you a prediction.
Yeah.
That you're going to have a good rating book.
Yeah.
I can't say much for some of your callers.
They're semi-light better than others.
Like who?
Who do you like?
Well, I thought I'd put it on that call.
He's no good.
One guy in front of me was a Lucy Lopez guy.
I guess he's the best fan for here.
I'm not really sure.
There's one guy you took on the right.
I don't know why.
He seems like a pretty nice fella.
That was the, uh, I don't know what you call him.
Some stock guy or something.
I don't know.
He's never a stock guy.
Yeah, that's you.
You don't like him?
Hate him.
That's too bad.
He seems like a nice fella.
Seems like a jerk.
Seems like a...
That's the old of me.
Well, you shouldn't be so hard on you.
Yeah.
He's just trying to be friendly.
Yeah, well, you don't want me to want him.
Anyways, I hope you do want him to be a stock guy.
We don't want him to be a stock guy.
Don't call us again.
How many times did I tell you that?
Don't call us again.
Well, you don't have a good rating tomorrow.
Let me say it again.
Which one of those words don't you understand?
Don't ever call us again.
It's bad, good, Neil.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
That's what he thinks.
It's all bad.
You were going good there for a couple of words.
It's all...
And then you got to the wrong word.
It's all bad.
So anyway.
Yeah.
Facts machine ran out of paper.
So you're going to get a bunch of facts as I don't know how many.
Because I just put paper back in the machine.
It's catching up.
Just warning you.
I have anything yet.
No, no.
It's still a sky-cut out over here.
We didn't have any facts today.
Like Jack Webb.
All we wanted is the facts.
Remember Jack Webb?
Uh-huh.
Who's the other guy?
Frank Alexander.
What a memory.
He played his big fat partner there.
Although it was fat crime fighters.
Although there was nobody like Cannon, man.
He was a gourmet cook.
Did you know that?
No, I didn't.
I loved what's in it.
He's dead now.
What's in it?
He's gone red.
We didn't come red.
He was a what's his name on radio?
Marshall Dylan.
I'm going to smoke.
I'm actually a little shot.
Yeah, he looked a shot the quarter-shot guy.
That's what the poll says.
Quarter-shot should be shot.
That's what it's got some votes.
WQA-M, hello.
I'm eating chicken wings.
Q-Y-M, hello.
Neil.
Yes.
Hey, how are you?
Good.
It's right.
And I don't understand like why they...
You keep saying don't call the...
And they call back again.
But for example, I mean whether it's that guy...
Or even the Andy Roblin guy...
Call the fuck out.
Yeah, that guy.
He's the world's worst, huh?
Why don't you just take a gun and blow your brains out?
What if he goes...
No, no, wait.
I can't find him.
I'd stick the gun up.
I'd be asked and try to...
But wait, Neil.
Neil.
Get there.
I'm here.
Please.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Please, what?
Mr. Postman?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Please, Mr. Wieselitz.
Andy Rockman guy...
And Steve Stone.
And who's the Elima?
David Sugarman.
That's right.
And his mother.
And your mama.
5670560, 0560 on the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.
Brian Sears or Tim Teetrick.
That's our poll question today.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
What's up?
How are you doing, sir?
Oh, wow.
Deputy QAM.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes.
One of the funniest lines I've ever heard you do is that I would be...
And there was one of them days when you were just ripping everybody.
And you said...
You'd be doing the call letters like W.
I am overdosing on insanity.
I was looking to make a little thing about that last today.
Yeah.
And I like trees.
I love you.
Oh, yeah.
It's a tree guy.
The tree guy.
I forgot about him.
He's been trying.
Well, it's if the tree lady died.
Yeah, the tree guy is his own, her shoes.
He's peeing in him.
Deputy QAM, hello.
You hear the last of the Steve Gold?
How like those binoculars that you pee in to watch the races with?
Deputy QAM, hello.
I believe your callers are the future.
Let them shine and let them lead the way.
Should have murdered beauty they pervert this time.
Deputy QAM, hello.
You're supposed to be an aunt.
QAM, hello.
Yeah.
I'm telling you, uh, you need to grab Arlington Road.
Arlington Road.
Killer movie.
What's it about?
You saw it, Jeff Bridges.
You saw it all the time ago.
What's it about?
Oh, he did.
Oh, I...
What's it about?
It's about urban terrorism.
And your next four neighbors are never terrorists.
There's a media manipulating the public and not telling you exactly what's really going on anywhere on the planet.
And I think that you would really enjoy it.
I saw it.
Oh, that's good.
Well, that's...
And the ending is fabulous.
You feel better?
You know, we're...
Let me say it again.
I saw it.
Oh, I watched the road.
But I didn't tell us the ending.
I don't remember.
How do you talk like that?
How do you remember that I seen it?
Because I remember we discussed it.
You saw it first, actually.
Oh, and what happened?
I can't tell you.
I mean, it was the end of the day.
I mean, it was the end of the day.
I destroyed the ending, but just...
Yeah.
Give me a...
518 on a pull.
We're stuck there.
Quarter slot guys.
That's one of those movies where he suspects that the neighbor is a terrorist.
Like an urban terrorist.
And he's trying to get other people to believe him.
It's kind of like a rear window.
You know that kind of thing.
We're nobody alone, I believe him.
Yeah.
And then in the end...
He is.
I'm not going to tell you.
Oh, I don't remember.
Was it Tom?
Then you can...
Arlington Road.
Then you can watch it over again.
And still be surprised.
What about Arlington Race Track?
What about it?
With Jesse Campbell in the third race.
Or really fires.
What do you think?
No.
I sure like Jesse Campbell.
I'll tell you that.
Do you?
He's no Justin Stein, but I like Jesse.
He's all right.
Did Eric step on the brake?
I mean, I think he thought we were going to stop at 500.
And then we got to 518.
And he doesn't realize we need to get to 600.
Otherwise Chris is fired.
Oh.
And you got stuck at four votes.
I got stuck at five who want to shoot me.
And you got four and the quarter-schlock guys got three.
Who say the quarter-schlock ought to be shot.
Somebody QAAM, hello.
Here on Hill.
Yeah.
Come on, say the East.
Say, come on.
Somebody QAAM, hello.
And yes, I was looking for Reverend George, please.
Yeah, look in the toilet.
QAAM, hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
This is Steve Gold.
The hydrogen site elephant test.
The golds are stolen.
You're hired, Steve.
Welcome back.
All is forgiven.
I just can't believe the lack of response here.
We've got about that.
Between Goldie and Jerks.
Now, does Jerks know this?
That he's out?
Is he aware of that?
I don't know.
I don't know if he listens to the show.
He's a training camp today.
Well, what do you mean if he always tell me he listens to the show religiously?
Did I say that?
No, I said that.
He says he listens all the time.
Yeah.
And I don't know if he's supposed to be a training camp today, so.
Well, he's not a dolphin camp.
Now, you know they got this show blaring out there at Dolphin Camp.
Because this is your dolphin station.
We love the dolphins.
They really suck.
You know what?
Yeah.
You got to be like a masochist to be on that train.
The biggest name.
The best talents.
Peter Fisino, Rogers.
Fourth place, US 5.
Sixty QAM.
The fourth leader.
Bonus battle.
Since Fearless Neither has won Natasha and I know you'll have to look for a motion squatter.
Instead, we listen to the near-roger's pattern and balance went to two hours.
Millions have converted for fun and profit.
Now, you too can turn your pagan ways around at Earl Stripes' will convert any goi for just 99.95.
That's right.
Listen to one of our successful graduates.
For Kim, I shall own Malache, I shall own.
At Earl Stripes' will convert anyone into a Jew.
Malachem, Haka-dos, Baruchu.
Translated means, sorry, I must have left my wallet at home.
Millachem, Haka-dos, Hama-la-jin.
Haka-dos.
Translated means, Stewardess, did you make sure to give me a kosher meal?
Millachem, Hama-la-jin.
Haka-dos, Baruch.
Translated.
Yes, Rabbi, the check is in the mail.
Yes, you too can convert into a Jew for just 99.95 at Earl Stripes'.
Act now and get a free Yark's side candle for just $10.
Earl Stripes' will convert any goi for just 99.95 or more if we can.
Hama-la-jin.
Hama-la-jin.
How's the hell in the supposed to read backwards for Christ's sake?
Yeah, do it for Christ's sake.
So Ted Stevens, one of the most anxious members of the Senate,
for Malachem is going to be in debt of deception.
Good.
For what I don't know, but for anything's good.
That's right.
Oh, no.
The Palm Restaurant at Merrick Park and Crowgibbles has closed the debt stores.
Workers' toll channel 10AW have to work Sunday only to find they were out of a job.
The restaurant has closed its doors unexpectedly.
It's the second Palm Restaurant to close within the last two years.
Manager said it's mostly due to the economy.
Many people are coming back on spending catafor with high-end dining.
Dining and dancing and all that.
I think we're like an indepression, man.
I don't want to get everybody all nervous and panicky, but all I can say is...
Oh, my God.
Wow.
Benagins all closing down and Ted Stevens being indicted and oil 800 bucks a gallon.
Things like that.
Mike sends me a message.
He says, hey, did by any chance he catch the Humper Saturday ABC, no, I did not.
He says he looks like he's about to explode.
Did you see it, Chris?
No, I did not see it.
What do you have been on?
They have some horse racing show on or what?
On Sunday.
I don't know.
Beats me.
Didn't see it.
I sure hope the Humper is okay, but he's...
I think he's got a death wish.
Remember, I was going to buy him the blood testing meter in the whole deal?
We didn't want it.
I didn't want it.
Right.
He's not interested.
He thinks he can just keep eating and eating and blowing up in the diabetes.
Like me.
I eat ice cream and candy and crap.
In fact, I discovered what else in the name of it.
I can't even think of the name of it.
There's like a little...
It's not a cupcake, but it's like a marshmallow filled and you put it in the microwave and
you've been nuclear for about 20 seconds.
Oh, my God.
Is it like a small kind of thing?
Oh, good.
No, better than that.
Who?
It's better than smalls.
You don't have it there, though.
It's a Canadian thing.
Let's see.
It's some kind of a...
It's named after a candy bar, but it's not a candy bar.
It's more like a thing.
Here's Larry.
Says your vet can be fixed, but you really need a high-end collision shot to work with fiberglass.
Maybe bring it to a Chevy dealer up there.
Fix it, sell it, and get new glasses, says Larry.
I don't need new glasses, Larry.
I just need to not be careless.
You got to spend your whole life not being careless.
I'm guarantee I'm not the only person that's ever done that.
You think?
I imagine.
I'm not the only person that's ever taken a ride off the ball for just a second.
Oh, smash.
Sure.
I couldn't believe it.
I mean, like a nasty crash like WAM.
And I thought, how the hell did I do that?
Here's an excellent one.
Maybe we can get these people on his sponsors.
Uncle Neely, I've developed a golf bag that you can take a dump in with...
Without leaving the golf course.
I just need a name for it.
You have any suggestions?
Also, if you think I could advertise it on QAM.
Hey, if you've got a few bucks, man, we'll take your cash.
I love those binoculars day of PN while you're watching the horse races.
Oh, my favorite.
What do you got to pee every now and then?
What are you going to do?
Nice...
That's college boy.
Yeah.
Nice college boy.
How are you going to shoot him from a mile away?
You're taking this very place.
What are you going to do?
Nice college boy, huh?
They want to get mixed up in the family business.
And now you want to go down a police cat and want to go to the police.
You want to slap your face a little bit?
Huh?
What do you think this is?
You want me to shoot him a mile away?
You're going to get him close like this.
The binoculars brains will open a nice side relief soon.
Come in.
Huh?
You're taking this very first.
534 votes.
You need 66 votes and 55 minutes.
You aren't going to do it.
How dare you come up with that 600 number, Chris?
I'm sorry.
I thought I said 550.
No, 550 sounds good.
Isn't that our goal 550?
All right.
It's the dog days, man.
Anybody who thinks that we're operating on...
We're running on empty.
You know what's really important?
What's that?
Goldie coming back?
Quarter-slot guy passed me and tied you.
Quarter-slot guy?
He's got five.
Quarter-slot.
Run.
How to be shot.
Right on the spot.
WQAM, hello.
Where are you going to be when you're cracked?
QAM, hello.
See, that always works if he says it real fast, whatever.
He's going to say, yes.
This is Lucie Lopez guy.
I am still alive.
What does that mean?
What do you think about that, buddy?
What does that mean?
Lucie Lopez guy.
What is that?
You said you shot me five times.
I'm still alive.
And she was on yesterday on Georgia Show.
Yeah.
Now, what else do you want to know, buddy?
On Georgia Show.
Yes.
She's on Georgia Show again, lapping in his uncircuit.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Why, he showed it to her?
Yes, he did.
He just out my hair, George.
Did you whip it out?
Oh, yeah.
A couple times.
Yeah.
When it's out.
Whip it out.
There he is.
That crusty old friend of mine, he's had Stevens, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
He's had it.
You call that a born again penis?
534 votes on Chris's pool.
He knows he's not going to make his 600.
And he's pretty down on the dumper about it.
Hey, 537.
I thought we were doing 550.
I think over the documents here.
And I understand that when I heard you just a couple of minutes ago, you said seven charges.
That's right.
Seven counts of making false statements to federal investigators.
Good.
Fry his ass.
Not the bastard.
Ted Stevens, one of the great crooks in the U.S. are Congress.
WDQA in.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Man, what's going on with you?
What do you got?
I got one new GPS system and G.
That's one of the things on the window.
They can't find my home address.
Pretty elaborate remodeling of the senator's home and apparently...
Crook thief, great robber.
That's Ted Stevens.
What was the guy's name on Gini?
What was his name?
Stevens.
Right.
No, that was on Bewitched.
Bewitched was there.
Is that...
And Samantha Stevens.
Oh, well there you go.
Very good.
And I got the Christie.
Right.
Gini was Nelson, major Anthony Nelson.
And his friend Roger Healy.
And major bellows.
I'll put out for bellows if you want to know.
Wow.
What an expert man on Bewitched.
You know what Gini's sister's name was?
No.
Gini.
I see.
It's Sticks, it's Us and did I mention those?
They may be wished, but did not watch the show.
That was the movie, right?
They made a movie?
Why do they always do that?
They make a movie about a TV show.
And often it's got little or nothing to do with the TV show.
It's like Batman, you know, which has nothing to do with Batman with a real story.
What did he say?
You guys like the movie?
I'm glad for him.
I'm happy.
See, it's nothing like the TV show.
No, it will be a lot.
No, but nothing is.
Bastard and a basket.
Bastard from a basket.
I mean, two hours and thirty minutes, it seems like a not a minute over five hours.
And by the time you get to the end, it's like, what was the point?
I mean, he was a bastard and he was a hard-ass and didn't like anybody.
And we said that in five minutes.
I could say, is this a true story?
Because otherwise, why would anybody write a story?
True story.
Yeah, but it's not.
Mel, but it was based on it, booked by up in Sinclair, Oil.
Yeah, and the oily brew.
Yeah, and.
Remember that guy that calls it, or do you ever hear of up in Sinclair, or?
Oh.
Probably a good buddy with Jolly Jo Bell, pseudo-inletual jackass, a real...
Recto poll.
WQA and Hello.
Hey, did you hear about the new group collider they have for a diabetics?
The what?
The group collider.
The collider?
The collider?
What do you do with it?
Well, I just poured up my rectum.
I just wanted to...
Oh, good.
Keep it in there.
Recto poll.
WQA and Hello.
The Rogers.
Yes, sir.
What are you guys going to get the technology of the text message?
Anytime soon?
Me, me, me.
I mean, I...
I mean, it's incredible.
Every other station has it except for you guys.
That's right.
How many substances got it right across the hall down there?
And we can't get it because our sales department couldn't sell a glass of water
to a starving idiot in the desert.
But that sucks because sometimes I can't get to a fax or can't call you.
So can't say anything and can't contribute, don't they?
Yeah.
Well, keep it up.
That's a good news.
Yeah, that's right.
Our sales department's really on top of them.
We got no restaurant deals the last two weeks in a row.
The thing that they were touting so big.
Oh, what do you think of that idea with the text message?
I think it's a great idea.
When is it going to happen?
You heard any more about it?
No.
How about you, Chris?
You got your ear to the agrarian stone?
Not at all.
No.
If it makes sense, if it's going to help the show, if it's going to enhance what we're doing,
then forget about it.
No enhance in your pants.
And by the way, I got my shirt and my pants on.
And my shoes during this break, I'm going to slip right on here.
I'm going to stick them on.
And at two o'clock, I'll be out the door and you won't hear no more.
Till Thursday and then I'll be gone for 12 days.
Wow.
That's exciting?
Nope.
What do you mean by that?
You're having a great time and looking at all the extra money that you're getting and all the extra food.
Oh yeah.
But on those days when you do the show.
That's right.
Well, you know, if those people really like you a lot, if it's still bringing the food, they want to.
And they can't?
Well, no, but we can't thank them on the air.
So that's not fair.
I'm not going to take, you know, free food if I can't just say, you know, it likes to say things.
Oh wow.
Why not?
Because it would be...
It would be ultimately...
Maybe I'm Mr. Ego.
It would be a total snorer.
I have to live with myself.
Well, that's sad, but true.
Yeah, don't we all.
We have to live with ourselves.
I mean, you're, you're exist within your, between your ears, in your head.
You exist.
Mm-hmm.
You're there all by your own way.
That's right.
You can't run away from the...
No matter where you go, there you are.
Here's another fact that says, you need to watch the rest of the shutter.
It's got a great twist in it.
I wouldn't waste my time watching that piece of garbage if you paid me by the second.
Granted, it's a little slow, but the end makes up for it.
I believe there's still a stake in the oil.
I'm sure it's in the street.
It just wasn't a 46-diameter.
No, that's the one that's gone, I believe.
Right?
Yes, it's gone.
Go Patriots love you, showed day from Cooper City.
Well, we love you, David.
And go Patriots, but stake in the oil is gone.
And once it's gone, it ain't making a comeback.
One thing about restaurants, once they close down, they don't come back.
Like when somebody croaks.
See anybody making a comeback these days?
No.
We're still waiting for Jesus 2,000 years later for Christ's sakes.
544 is all you got, man.
You're, you're, you're a daily to dollar short.
Well, we said 550 though, right?
Correct.
You're on, you're on target.
All right.
We got 550 right now.
Let's hear it.
Come on, you could do 600 if you really want to make a push on it.
What's wrong with you?
All right, we can do it.
We'll do it now.
Because it's the middle of the summertime and there's only 40 people in town.
Let's, if each one of them would vote in another 10 times,
113 at QAN.
This is G Gordon Liddy, and they don't come anywhere.
Of course, the new Roger.
This morning, Americans, it's Paul Harvey.
Stand by for news.
David was totally drunk and walked into a bar,
and after staring for some time at Sally,
the only woman seated at the bar he walked over to her,
placed his hand up her skirt and began to fondle her.
Sally jumped up and slapped him silly.
David immediately apologized and explained,
I'm sorry, I thought you were my wife.
You look exactly like her.
Why, you drunk and worthless and sufferable son of a...
Sally screamed.
Funny he muttered, you even sound like her.

Matt is an airline captain, and he was breaking in Julie
and he was a new blonde stewardess.
The route they were flying had a layover in Miami,
and upon their arrival, the captain showed her the best place
for airline personnel to eat,
chop and stay.
Over night.
The next morning, as Matt was preparing the crew for the day's route,
he noticed that Julie was missing.
He knew which room she was in at the hotel and called her,
wondering what had happened.
She answered the phone crying and said she could not get out of her room.
You can't get out of your room.
Matt asked, why not?
Julie replied, there are only three doors in here.
She saw, then, one is the bathroom, one is the closet,
and one has a sign on it that says, do not disturb Paul Harvey.
Good day.
Good day?
Wait till you hear what, I don't know if you're worth it.
Did you talk very much about Novak hitting the pedestrian
with his Corvette, by the way?
No, I don't believe I did.
You didn't talk about it at all?
Maybe in passing.
Hey, Robert Novak hit the hit and run guy.
Syndicated calmness, Robert Novak said he was issued a $50 citation
after hitting a pedestrian while driving in downtown Washington.
Witnesses said the collision occurred about 10 am last Wednesday,
as the 70-70-year-old Novak was traveling near K Street
in his Black Chevrolet Corvette.
DC Fire Department spokesman Alan Eder said the victim
was taking George Washington University Hospital
with minor injuries.
Novak told WJL and TATV, he was said for feigning the yield
the right way.
He said he didn't realize what happened, continued driving until a bicyclist stopped him.
Yeah, David Bono, the bicyclist, who witnessed the incident,
told the Associated Press that the pedestrian would sit in a crosswalk
and would display it across Novak's windshield.
But he didn't know what happened.
Right.
He noticed it didn't take long for that grain tumor to develop.
The Lord works in mysterious ways.
He took a long time to get even for chap acquittal to take Kennedy.
He cut him some slack.
But Bobby Novak was being the right wing,
and of course the Valerie Plame involvement,
so he got a good quick response from the Lord.
Speaking of right wing bastards getting it good,
Senator Ted Stevens, the senior Republican in the Senate,
was indicted this afternoon by a federal grand jury.
In a 28-page indictment from a federal grand jury,
Stevens was charged with seven counts of making false statements on a Senate financial forms.
Federal investigators have been looking into improvements made to his home in Alaska.
Theeth, crook, bastard, Nazi.
Stevens has been the subject of a wide-ranging federal investigation focusing on
Alaska state lawmakers and energy company in the state.
FBI agents searched his Alaska home July of last year.
Heral slow.
How are we doing on your poll now?
5.63.
You're going to do it.
We're going to get that 600 if it's a lie.
If we have to stay on till 245.
Why?
5.7 now.
If you have to stay on till 245.
And your quarter-slot guy is flying up there.
Quarter-slot guy is making a move.
He's got eight.
I only got five and used to got only four.
Even the homeless person with six beats us.
But the quarter-slot guy is moving on coworker.
He's got eight.
It's all good.
It's all good.
Another...
Correct them, hole.
From the depths of the universe.
WQA M, hello.
Yeah, when do you think gold is coming back?
I beg your pardon?
When do you think gold is coming back?
When do I think he's coming back?
It's the quarter-slot guy again.
Mm-hmm.
M-hmm.
M-hmm.
Sometimes they don't even have to speak a word.
You know who it is.
Right?
Like when you hear the pans clanking in the background and you know like that.
All I rack it.
Do you have to even hear a word?
Nope.
Nope.
Never has heard a discouraging word.
So, Geltie's coming back, huh?
Ow!
I think you made it out.
I'll believe it when I hear it.
WQA M, hello.
I have a tumor.
QA M, hello.
Hello?
Yes.
Hi, is this somebody QA M?
Yes, it is.
Is this George?
No, this is Neil.
Hi, Neil.
Hi, darling.
This is your Jewish-cue and girlfriend.
Uh-huh.
How are you doing?
Okay.
I, uh, I just, uh, I have two things.
First of all.
Yes.
We have to convert George to a Jew.
That's the first thing we need to do.
You feel like it's half the knife.
He's doing it.
I think he's...
Don't touch!
Don't touch!
Yeah.
I think he's already here.
But...
I'd love to be except for that part.
And something else that, uh, you know, you have to bring what's the same back because that way you look all the material you're going to have.
I mean, you remind me of my cool uncle and he's like my cocoa uncle.
You know, he seems perfect.
Who's that?
Dr. Dory.
Dr. Dory.
Okay.
Okay.
I love you, Neil.
See ya.
Bye.
Bye.
She's talking about...
Dr. Dory.
I think we're making a wrong move.
What do you think?
Gildey or the Mold for a two to four?
I mean, we've already tried it both and they both had a one point.
Oh!
They had no number in here at all.
Nothing.
Well, while we put them together, they can get a, uh, a 1.5.
I think it would be great.
And I bet you there'd be a big resurgence of all those Mold bits, you know?
I mean, we got that one.
Tonight, I'm an all-new diner's driving to dive.
Bokehler's home Florida.
The land of the Q-Tibs had some of these.
Two of them think of binding a good diner here.
But we did.
They call it Smose.
Dory Dory diner.
You know, one thing I'm wondering is, uh, I'm trying to remember back to the...
Well, look at this.
Here's a fax ad.
The outbound call center.
Yeah.
Contact hundreds of prospects per hour.
Isn't that great?
Nope.
It makes, uh, a zillion calls every hour.
I bet you I know who's got one of those.
Anyway, what was I just saying about the Mold?
Oh, how do we ever get him to do, uh...
We didn't.
How did he do it?
He was talking about it himself about how he never said that.
We did, we did.
Yeah, he never said that.
We put it himself.
We did, we did.
Yeah.
But you sure got an incredible memory for useless cramp like that.
Yeah.
So what, uh, Harold Fisher or Sandy Fisher?
Who?
Who did you...
You don't know who these people are.
You better start studying your harness racing, mister.
Red Ross or, uh, Red Range.
Walter Ross.
Who?
Or Red Ross.
Or Howard Niles.
Red Rough R.
How about Arty Niles, Senior?
And Rusty Range.
How about Willard Niles and Peppy Relko?

neck with his glasses. Yeah, color. Now we, color. Now we never saw it, but you know
that you can see color no more, right? Right, I met you. So he kind of like
eating self-hub sacrifice. I bet you we find somebody also, I'm wondering when I'm
going to get my first check from one of our long-time listeners. I've been on

some loyal listener who got hours and months and years of enjoyment from the

You think hasn't happened yet.

Right here. Oh, that's me nothing.
Well you think I was talking to Chris? Yeah. I don't talk to Chris.
Sure you do. About sports, the pole, the fire on.
Can I talk to you Chris? Yes, sometimes. Really.
Oh, wait, you're talking so I'm supposed to answer.
Former NBA referee Tim Donahy was sentenced to 50 months in prison today.
For setting off that gambling scandal at Turner's the league's reputation,
it raised questions about the integrity of its officiating.
NBA my ass. Give me a break.
Donahy's lawyer had asked the judge for probation. He had faced up to 33 months in prison,
but the judge gave him credit for his cooperation.
Fooling his arms but showing no other emotion to 41 year old Donahy,
apologized to the court. I brought shame on my family and myself.
He said 15 months in a slamer and three years probation.
Cubman dread, okay? What are we having to the good old days?
With Arnie Rosen and Bob, what was his name? With Rochester Royals.
Bobby Wanzer. Bobby Mumser.
Five 92 were right on the brink of greatness on the pole.
Thank God for that. Now when those numbers come out tomorrow morning,
there's going to be a lot of people having wild bowel movements.
I'll tell you that. You better do your number early tomorrow.
All your numbers, one, two, and three.
In fact, speaking numbers, we become like the Lawrence Wilk of the Arradio of Market.
A one, two, and a two.
Yeah, one and a two and a one and a two.
And we never get to the three part usually.
Except us, we got the three.
A one and a two.
And a boy, jolly Joe, and he's going to bring back guilty.
If they fail the first time, if you hated it and couldn't stare at the first time,
bring it back for more punishment, okay?
This freaking jolly Joe, man, this guy is just a master of disaster.
Evil.
WQA, him, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, I don't know if you've been down to the state recently, have you?
To the what?
Down, United States.
Yes, you're called Florida, US, yeah.
Oh, okay.
Well, I just want to thank Mr. President for the low gas prices.
I don't know if you've been watching, but we're at like $4.
Maybe just under for $97.
Yeah, I'm sorry, $397, $395.
I got my stimulus check.
I think it's looking good.
So where are you?
You're leaving?
Yeah, that way.
Okay, I think he's going to finish it up strong here.
What do you think?
No, and no question about it.
Okay, can you read it?
Don't forget about people in Iraq, too, based on a bunch of lies.
In a real country with a real media, he'd already be in jail somewhere.
He'd been a federal prison, along with Chini.
But not in America, baby, because you've got Nancy Pelosi and John Connors.
Oh, we're not going to have any impeachment because of it.
It'd be a bit of a boop, but about, yeah.
And you want to know why?
Because they're all in on it.
They're all part of the same grand scheme.
Am I right?
Yes.

If I could kill somebody and get away with it, who would it be?
I got my shirt on, my shoes, my pantaloons.
I'm ready to hit that door at 2 o'clock, man.
A famous person, 123.
I couldn't kill anybody, 115.
George, 89.
I just can't believe how well you're doing on this poll.
Sure you can.
You put it on the other on purpose.
You knew it would be well.
I didn't put it on either.
This was on the poll as it was sent to me.
Do you want me to face it back to you?
Whatever.
It says George, he, he.
Listen, listen to this number 8.
Yeah, he, he.
When the poll started, I was the only name on there.
Yeah.
Exactly what you're doing, you miserable pee.
I'm going to fact you just pull it on.
What do I care?
Because you're blaming me for it.
I didn't put you on there.
The guy that made the poll put you on.
I thought it's hysterical.
Pet a file 40, crank caller 38, your boss 33, neighbor 32, a family member 27, your spouse 27.
A random stranger 18, coworker 13, and X 12, quarter-schlock guy 10, Neil 6, homeless person 6, and Chris 5.
I got you by one, fatso.
I'm sad I got another vote though.
5.94.
We need 6 to go, and you got 24 minutes.
That should be a slam dunk.

WDQYM, hello.
I'm your buddy.
QYM, hello.
Hola.
Neil.
Yes.
I record on Stakein L.
Yeah.
There's one on North Andrews Avenue, extension, and Northern Waterdale.
Only one left in South Florida.
Really?
No, there's one in there.
Chris told me there's one in Dade.
Yeah, but they're not answering their phone.
They're not answering your phone.
Okay, thanks.
All right.
Well, what does that mean?
They're not answering their phone.
Well, I call them a couple minutes ago and they didn't answer.
But I thought you said for sure that they were open.
No, I said that they were there.
I didn't say that they were open.
You know what was open?
That shouldn't have been?
Ooh, ooh, I know.
Your mouth.
George, you.
You were open.
I did too, but that's why I quit.
And you're.
Reckham.
Whole.
Can we Google it, Stakein L?
Can you Google it?
I mean, I'm, you know.
The website's really, really slow.
I went through already.
What do you mean it's really slow?
Does that mean?
I don't know.
It's just either a lot of people are on it or they're going to shut it down.
Yeah, a lot of people are on it.
I'm going to let it right now.
Let's see how slow it is here.
Stakein L restaurant.
Let's see.
I've clicked on it and you write.
It's real slow.
How come it's not coming up?
Maybe because it's gone.
Now it's real slow.
If it's just barely even moving and nothing happened.
Maybe they're out of business.
Try the Benagons one.
No, I'm not going to try the Benagons one.
We already know the answer to that, Schmuck.
You're just doing it and Benagons is going belly up.
All closing down except for that one for our, I don't understand that if it's part of a chain, how can one stay open unless it's independently owned?
You think that's possible?
Five ninety seven you still need three votes, Marty Pants.
We'll get five ninety seven.
One?
We'll get it.
Oh, we'll get it.
You're going to get it.
You're going to get a big raise this year.
That's what I'm forecasting.
Really?
Oh, sure.
Once they see those big numbers tomorrow morning, they'll say, oh, it must be Fat Chris that you're ain't Neil and George.
When we have those gigantic numbers and get that bonus money ready, better get it ready, Charlie Joe, because they're going to be big bonus money.
Coming after tomorrow.
Not for us, but for somebody on some station somewhere.

Absolutely.
It is all around me.
Everybody is cruel.
The economy is drowning.
They got us by the throne.
I took to some driving, but in a fortune-goer.
For the world's richest country is the fresh and low.
After the final level, the stage was set.
For the EO constiprae of the market, they trickled it up to the 1%.
It does solve and make us forget.
Who this be of recession, the headlines clearly abuse.
There's people going concrete.
You won't see that on the news.
It's like the 1930s on other grapes of grass.
We're just the YouTube 30s in a fortune by gas.
I'm dying on the earth.
The corporate newspapers take it with them.
The ones that I use for the sheets are my fans.
You think we got a big benefit in the troll.
They got us blinded now we got a dust fall.
We're in the heat of pressure, but they don't want you to know.
For the world's richest country is the fresh and low.
It blows, not like joy has been a blow.
It's on the floor.
Nice going, Fatso.
Did you get you on the stake in the OFC?
No, and you want to know why?

It doesn't exist anymore.
If you would have looked at Wikipedia, Stickenail was a semi-casual dining American restaurant chain founded by Norman Bricker in 1966.
It had over 60 locations in the 19 states.
It was part of the Metro Media Restaurant Group which owned Benagons, Bonanza restaurants.
You know what's past tense it had?
Stickenail was founded in 1966 in Plano, Texas.
It remained an independent chain until 1976 when Pillsbury purchased it and folded it into its restaurant group with Burger King, Benagons and other stores.
In 1982 Pillsbury spun the company and Benagons into independent SNA Restaurant Corp, and 88 Metro Media Purchase the company.
In 1993 the company was merged with the Metro Media State Cows' chains, Bonanza and Bonanza, which now runs all three chains under the SNA Restaurant Group brand.
On July 29, 2008, what sounds like today?
Hundreds of Stickenail restaurants across the country did not open due to Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing by a pair of company SNA Restaurant Corp of Houston, Texas.
SNA owned by Metro Media which also owns Ponderosa and Bonanza State Cows, also affected by this closing is the Benagons Restaurant Chain, also owned by SNA Restaurant Corp.
Franchise restaurants are not affected by the closure.
So like I said that the ones that still might be open are the franchisees.
So what do you like better? The fricacy or the franchising? What is fricacy?
You got me?
Okay.
You never had fricacy?
I'm sure I have, but don't ask me what makes something a fricacy.
I remember Ford Frick.
Oh yeah?
Who is the commissioner of I think the National League or something like that?
Baseball.
I remember Baseball?
Nope.
What's this?
Oh, look at that. I feel much better now. Brandon sees the only person nobody called it in festive that they weren't paying attention.
One time at the BK I wasn't paying attention and crashed my side bumper into a huge curb so I don't feel too bad.
Oh thanks Brandon. See that's to make me feel like I'm not the only one.
I bet you have many other people out there who have done the same thing.
But they want me to feel bad.
Oh, get some new glasses, Neil. You're old and daughtery and you crashed into a...
I mean, it's just, it's a winding wall and when you first go down to the parking garage, it's bad.
You have to really take it real slow and real careful and I didn't.
I didn't.
That's all.
Am I supposed to like serve jail time for it or something? Am I supposed to be crucified for it?
Neil do a big cross because I smacked the front end of my Corvette against the wall.
And you know something I could leave it like that for the rest of the time.
And then most people wouldn't even notice it. It's in the spot where it's reading out very noticeable.
Unless, of course, you're on the right of the car.
Oh, look at that. That beautiful Corvette. It's a smashyed up there and all smirred, you know.
Oyster smirred.
609 votes on your poll. I'm very proud of you today. You've done a hell of a job, Pat.
So, I thank you very much.
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if after Guilty finishes with his meeting with Johnny Joe.
Joe calls you and there offers you a big raise that you can't turn down.
And I thought we weren't doing any more hiring. How can we bring in Jodie back when all we've got a freeze on hiring?
Oh, that's a good point.
Uh-huh.
They'll make an exception, I guess, if it's really important.
WDQAM, hello.
Should I be shot?
QAM, hello.
Turned out Chris's office.
WDQAM, hello.
Hey, you know why they want to fill a door?
So they got a smoothie from Luzzy Low.
Oh, that must be it.
Chelsea, huh? Is that the deal?
Let's be.
WDQAM, hello.
What? Five out of 10, number.
QAM, hello.
Bruce Kelly's on IOD now.
Who cares?
Doing mornings.
The guy that got candid magic.
Yeah.
And who cares?
Yeah, look out now.
Yeah, look out my mind.
They ought to get lost. Go away.
You bug me.
Thirty-two years later, you bug me.
First call I picked up at IOD.
I was doing some weekend crap playing music,
spinning records after Russ O'Hase's.
Look at the difference our career paths went.
Man, Russ O'Hase's and his ad team he made.
He's making millions and millions and millions.
And I'm sitting here working for a fat ass goofball.
Would no radio station of here.
If you stuck 15 radios up his rectum pool.
He still wouldn't get it.
Where there's no sense, there's no feeling.
Just keep that in mind, okay?
Words to live by from the old queen.
Where there's no sense, there's no feeling.
WQAM, hello.
Daniel, the reason George got so many votes is because
everybody thought you meant W.
I don't know why you didn't put him on the list,
except they'd probably pick us all up and we'd be in the middle of the world.
That's right.
But anyway, that'd be a poetic justice.
And he, uh...
You okay, great. WQAM, hello.
We're in.
QAM, hello.
Hello, Neil. How are you?
It's your friend, Mario.
Yeah.
And Neil, I would just want to offer our services to you and your district.
No, no, Mario.
And don't send me any more proper gander either.
And what I'm here for you.
Do you want your services?
We'll call the FCC. Do something constructive.
Okay, Mario, go do some business.
I've been here for you for 18 years, sir.
Yeah, you've been there for me. What does that mean?
I've been here for you for 18 years.
No, you've got to thank me for that.
Now, you've got to thank me for that.
I've been here for you. The price is right.
Don't try to peddle your insurance crap on this show.
I've made the list of your life.
Take your proper gander and go away.
My friend, Mario, who thinks I'm going to give him free plugs in here.
Why don't you know there are a lot of people hurting for certain out there.
And business is bad. We're in the verge of the end of the world.
Thanks to your president, Mr. Bush.
All you right wingers out there,
about four more years of this,
we can't survive another four months of this.
We got to wait till January 20th,
the next year until this bastard and his henchman leave.
I hope they nail Ted Stevens to a cross-inclusive
I'm right on National TV, right on Loot Dobs on CNN,
with a bunch of illegal Mexicans.
What do you think of that?
Sounds like he's your buddy, Loot Dobs.
That's power.
And I think that, and his wife is Mexican, you know?
Yeah.
And I think that's what turned him around, so to speak.
That's what created this tremendous hatred, this...
In fact, maybe he'd like to vote on our pool.
That could be for your spouse.
I got six, Chris has got five, and a quarter-slot guy,
he's all the way up to 13.
Unlike the number of quarter-slot guy,
he's got 50 million projects,
40 plus five, 50 QAM.
I think.
Fourth, leader.
Eight.
In Miami Town.
What?
What?
At five, six, oh.
WQA.
Once there was a senator who was caught in dodging a habit.
Oh.
A bublerone, not much different like a typical meocompanic.
You fair, you fair, you fair, you fair, you fair, you fair.
It's up to Larry.
We all thank you.
Forgive me, writers, I'm paid, money to do.
You're looking for guys who make you go high-lying.
Oh, so Larry, crack that cue, or tap in your shoe.
You stole me's last a few days, but you refused.
Take don't away, Republicans are prime, I really did.
Get it.
It's up to Larry, with Cheek Up Love.
We all invite you to a hell of a heart.
Sunny O'Connor, I like doing certain go.
Larry, take a note, crack when he's tapping his shoe.
Game, game, game, I never have been gay.
It's up to Larry.
He wants to stay gay, but his own party wants him to go away.
The religious rock wants him to say,
Larry, crack this crack his leg toward you.
Welcome.
You fair, Larry.
Bye, bye, bye.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
I'm a bad guy.
I'm a bad guy.
