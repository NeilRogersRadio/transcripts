The music expressed on the previous programs are those where the hell is little dog Jesus where the hell is everybody man?
Broadcast group. Where'd everybody go?
Flykin?
Yeah, that's what they're doing.
Flagkin.
Stop this talent.
Go.
Flagkin and fly.
The sports radio 560-M.
Back in WQAM.
Go, go, go, go.
For the Latter-Day.
Got the beast for D.A. tonight again.
I'll set it on you.
Until Bell's not too happy about it, so tell me.
Now the Neil Roger show on 560-WQAM.
Neil got out of the WQAM.
Where the bag is.
I'll just hear those AKMs ringing and giving me my Yahoo!
Boy, come on, it's lovely when we keep our bank rough together with you.
Charge it up, charge it up, charge it up, yo ho.
Let's jump in the hole.
To the tune of 21st set or so.
Charge it up, charge it up to 20 grand.
Now check out my plan.
I'm writing a book and it looks like chapter 13 of the year.
I love to hit the lottery, but I'm an unlucky old smooth.
So I guess this lovely letter to your bank rough together with you.
You, you, and you.
That's a good pull that we ought to take.
Somebody sent that in the other day and we never took it.
Which is better than that crap we're doing today about going to the beach.
What?
I said, ooh.
That may be the worst pull we've ever taken on this show.
The one and so on there right now.
I have a polygrapant bottom.
What?
Scraping bottom.
Yeah, we're scraping a bottom.
Well, when you work for these people, you're already stricken.
But, but the a poll idea was somebody, some character or some a person who used to be on the show.
That's not really what the poll suggested, but that's what I'm thinking.
Who you miss.
For example, Jim Skyler.
Okay.
Faster than a touch tone phone.
Yeah, to man.
And guitar man.
Right.
Like that.
For you just played.
End of the bird.
Mm hmm.
Well, he was never on this show, but not on the station.
Correct.
You know what I mean.
I did.
Well, there's a couple of names for that poll.
How about KJ?
I hear he was there this morning.
Damn, you're not Chris Wayland right on of his car.
Probably.
Did he bring something in?
Yeah, it's sitting over here.
I'll have a bokeh bride inside it to you.
Well, what is it?
Well, it must not be that good if you could get into it.
I didn't listen to it.
It's right over here.
Why not?
B-C.
Wow, you're busy.
Everybody I know is busy.
Oh, so this morning, I'm sound asleep.
I'm out of the toward to this.
I should be sleeping right now.
You should let you should say go back and sleep.
No.
No.
Why not?
What?
Flack.
It's good enough for Joe Rose.
Oh, for me.
He's at a damn Marina's father's funeral.
We were just told.
Sorry, excuse me.
I wasn't a commentary.
I was just sitting in the mic.
I hope not.
That was down 131.
Governor Villanova.
I'm like, well, you know, you've it.
He's accused of corruption.
And he's in federal custody right now.
Solicitation of bribe male fraud.
Governor Villanova.
He's a crook.
How unusual for there to be crooks in Illinois, huh?
So anyway, 515 this morning, the alarm.
And of course, you've been lucky enough to hear the alarm in this building.
I feel blessed.
Right.
Right.
And just loud and blasting.
So I'm awakened at 515 to the sound of a false alarm.
You always know it's a false alarm.
Bam.
Bam.
And have you had tension, please.
This is building security.
Another one of those Inja Punjabi, you know.
And they've had a report of something on the third floor in alarm.
So you know what somebody probably came in at 5 in the morning drunk and was running up and down the hall pulling a fire alarm.
So you can hear the fire engines come in.
The fire department shows up and they check it all out.
And this is going on till 615.
Bam.
Bam.
Like that.
Kind of like.
Like that.
Yeah.
Like, a guilty was in the building.
God forbid that.
That would be close for alarm.
I'll turn it out by me.
We've done the guilty car alarm or something.
We did.
Have we?
Brian.
Brian Boko.
Chicken neck.
Because if we had it.
No, I've got guilty king, guilty, old, guilty pants, guilty show, guilty, a situation, guilty ticket, guilty, when he.
I got this.
That.
And this.
And this one.
Oh.
Oh, God.
That sounds like a ringtone.
So anyway, 615 finally this craft shuts off after an hour.
I fall back asleep 10 minutes later.
Here we go again.
Ladies and gentlemen, we've received another.
So in other words, the same jackass who set up the first one ever.
I don't think this side.
He was going to go do it again.
He had so much fun waking up the whole building.
But that was down one eleven, by the way.
And so this one on now for another.
Let's see 627 another hour and 10 minutes.
We would no announcement.
No nothing.
Just kept going on.
Every every once in a while with stuff for like 30, 40 seconds.
And you think, oh, thank God.
And you put your head on the pillow and hope state we're going to sleep.
And we'll come back again.
Finally 725 somebody who's speaking English somebody came on down there.
It said it's building security.
We apologize for the disturbance by the bomb.
But we're investigating the alarm.
And that was the last we heard until about 10 after 8 when he came on and said, oh, it's all all clear.
All queer.
So I didn't I'm like a zombie now.
Not that I missed that much sleep.
But you know what?
It's not the amount of sleep.
It's the quality of the sleep.
I know that sounds real corny and like that.
No, you're right, though.
It's the quality of sleep.
And when your sleep is interrupted.
Mm hmm.
Oh, sleep is interruptus.
And of course, there's no way to get in the elevator and go down there and scream at anybody.
Because when the firearms come on in any of these buildings, the elevators immediately automatically stop.
They don't work.
So I could have gone down 80 billion flights of stairs.
And then when I got down there, I would have had a walk back up.
And I wasn't going to do that.
Wasn't going to do that.
Governor Real and Roy's and custody.
He's a crook alleged.
I believe it.
Like way of it.
He looks like a over green.
Looks like Stan Major who's also from Illinois.
You think he's Stan Major?
Could be.
I haven't seen him lately.
Yeah.
Maybe that's where Stan's been doing.
What at that whole routine?
Why, you know, why not Stan?
You know, what's the point?
I'll kill time.
Because some time because we ain't got no emails.
I'm going to do a whole rant and rave about the email thing.
Yeah.
Now I realize everybody's, but we actually have three of them.
How do you like that?
How about those leaves?
Yeah.
Goal ranges.
Yeah.
Oh, this is hot Ron again.
Idiot.
You're an idiot.
Block his ass.
Block him.
More on.
Yeah, at least one again.
Big deal.
Oh, here's one.
How much in debt are you?
I like that pull idea.
Yeah.
From Pedro.
You like that?
We've never done that.
Anything.
You're close to that.
I mean, are we counting.
Let's work it out.
I mean, are we counting how much people are on their house or their car or everything?
How much are you?
Oh, wow.
What part of how much are you in debt?
Don't you understand, Mr. Hathor?
What I'm saying.
That's why that's wrong with you.
God.
What a dork.
Let's see.
Hot Ron.
I blocked.
I thought there was three.
Oh, yeah.
Go panther.
Rumors says and panther wins.
Oh, that's the same or on.
That's hot Ron.
Jackass.
Idiot.
Or are.
Oh, here's ugly Adam.
I didn't get to bet till 230.
Then it's six.
My roommates alarm goes off full blast.
And of course, he doesn't turn off till 630.
Then the snow powder sides to show up with it scraping and beeping.
Oh, geez.
Adam is just imitating me.
Since I'm in with you, Neil, we all just take the rest of the day off.
You're ugly, Adam.
I mean, that's what there's anything wrong with that.
Being ugly.
No, but why do you have to send me this picture?
Okay.
I could have like fantasized that you look like a joy and a joy and a joy or something.
Huh?
The people who said the pictures.
I don't know if you've noticed this.
They're ugly.
It's never a picture you want to get.
Rarely, very rarely.
Right.
It's never a picture anybody should send anybody alive.
Send it to the funeral parlor.
So anyway, the alarms are all done and the yadda yadda.
That was just one of those things.
And I'm sitting here watching it pee outside.
And it's going to wash away.
It's going to be plus five today, 41, 42.
It's going to wash away the entry to a snowy head.
Not a shame.
No, actually, it's a good thing.
It's a good thing.
I hate the snow.
I don't mind the snow itself, but I don't like the ice-thedded forms, you know, and
walking and freezing.
And I don't mind the snow.
I don't like the freezing rain.
But I do got those clogs you said.
That's right.
Last year you built the radios.
How long would you send me those?
I've wanted to say it was like two years.
Yeah.
Third time, you still build radios for my feet.
Right.
So I wouldn't slip and fall on my ass like I did a couple of years ago.
Break your pelvis.
That was really sad.
That old guy helping.
Give me a helping hand, but that was nice, you know, because that's here.
It's very nice.
People here are nice and helpful and hold the door for you.
They're the polite, you know, you need not ever be so humiliated again.
I'm not going to wear those things that you create.
Come on now.
Get out of here.
I'm going to wear clogs on my feet.
They're not clogs.
They're like glorifying rubber bands.
They're like shoes.
Springs on them.
Oh, stop.
You spent too much time down there.
That's your problem.
Oh, that's a fact.
That was my problem for a long time.
Oh, I was speaking to my problem.
Tell me what all my problems are.
Are all your experts out there.
And how to solve them.
Oh, my God.
In my life, you know, you have over the years every once in a while by accident,
you fall into a bucket of crap.
But this time you nailed it.
Complaints and critiques.
I even wrote it down.
That's it.
I've been saying that for a while.
That's what the email has degenerated.
And do we've only been doing it for two or three months in the beginning?
It had great promise.
And then around my birthday time, there was this tremendous outpouring.
Oh, all these nice people.
And I mean, really taking time to send me some nice crap.
You know, hundreds of them.
And then it's like, yeah, like that.
Well, that's what the call is.
I told the plug become after a certain point, the calls have degenerated into that.
Right.
It's completely crazy.
You generate into a bunch of long kids.
Complaints and critiques.
Why?
Why?
You should do this.
You should do that.
The show should be this.
The show should be that.
Why?
Oh, God.
I'm blocking so many people.
And now see, I made a mistake.
And last night I did for the last time.
Because last night there was Dan from Maryland, who supposedly has this
paradise life in the Philippines now with his young girlfriend.
And he's on there again.
Now keep making the mistake of going to the deleted ones that are blocked and then
reading them and then responding to them.
Now when I, when things are in a deleted file, I delete them a second time.
They disappear.
They vanish.
Even not even looking.
I just have been looking in there to see who these chronics are, who come back,
who don't know their deleted.
And by the way, Dr. What's his name again?
Dr. Al.
What a, ah, your blocked.
Go away.
I said yesterday he was blocked.
He still comes back with more cockaritoday about how the guy Mr. Bentley died from the Jefferson
I mean, come on.
Abe Lincoln, I'd feel too good either.
Oh, and still and tear.
Oh, in case you missed it, you probably already know this.
Well, if I probably already know it, why are you wasting my time sending me an email about it?
You smuck, you shmeckle, you idiot.
You chronic.
No, seriously.
Shmeckle.
These are stalkers.
You are absolutely correct.
Yeah.
You got these people fingered out a lot better than I did.
Complaints and critiques.
That's what the needle at neorodgers.com said all your complaints and critiques.
And they'll wind up in the deleted file immediately.
The rest of the experts on my life and all my life is so bad.
You should have such a bad life.
Okay.
Really?
Yeah, 90% of you people out there, you should have such a bad life.
And of course, they're listening to you about, oh, your friends just take you for your money and blah, blah, blah.
Yeah, they're talking about your crap.
You know, what?
I said, they're copying me.
Yeah, of course.
Just like Zisco with that pop-up crap.
You know?
Of all the guys, Neil thinks who is hot?
Who do you think is actually pretty good looking?
That was the pull.
629 people.
And I dare say most of them heterosexuals really braved it out to vote on that.
Pretty small total.
Because, oh, gee, I can't vote on that.
Johnny Depp 236, Tom Brady 174A, Tommy.
Brady Quinn, 103.
Luis Miguel 35.
Jesse McCartney, 15.
Matt Castle, 15.
Grady Moore size, 12.
Cristiano Ronaldo, 11.
We finally got it spelled.
No, we didn't.
Close.
Rocky Etibreia, Steven Bauer 9.
Ryan Philip P7, Joey Jonas 7, and Steven Straight 5.
And of course, Steven Straight should have been by far.
Should have won.
But they don't know who that is.
And even if they didn't know who it was, they, you know, their taste is in their tush.
1013 at 560WQA.
No portion of this program will be reproduced without the express spread information.
No, no.
No.
We are in the B.B. Broadcast Group Incorporated.
Your gay.
You failed.
When the squad aback, it's lonely.
He likes receivers that are wise.
Some people say that number eight is gay.
They say Troy loves the big brown eyes.
Brackdom.
Ackman.
He goes down on his knees, Ackman.
His guy's he likes to please Ackman.
He loves to slap cowboys on their behind.
Brackdom.
Brackdom.
He's got a spotless reputation.
What's all it?
America's team has world renowned.
Thor, Thor, Thor, Thor.
But is Troy gay?
I've heard some people say that's a little bit.
In the Hubble, he goes down Ackman.
He goes down on his knees, Ackman.
You're fair with me.
I can't bose the squeeze Ackman.
Don't let him cause he likes it from behind.
Well, I was by request.
In fact, if he emailed me a request, I'll play him all day between on the end of the year.
I'm playing all the oldies all the time.
All right.
I'll play that.
A few new ones today, for example.
For that Willie Nelson creep out there.
Big fat load again.
Gain so much weight, I'm a big fat load again.
That's a cubby's theme song, isn't it?
Yeah.
Okay, let's take a look at this poll if we must and we'll get to some of these great emails.
That was by request from Johnny who says, you think Joe Buck and Ackman do it?
Can you play that Ackman song, Porforvor?
Well, I don't really know and I don't care if they're doing it and I doubt it.
Joe Buck.
Maybe they're doing something that rhymes with Joe.
But anyway, so Joe Buck and Ackman, I don't know and I don't care.
But there was a song for you, no extra charge.
Wouldn't that nice of me?
Yep.
That that was only down 68 now.
It was down precipitously in the beginning and now it's making a little comeback.
88 65.
How about you?
We got wind up in the positive territory today.
Leafs one last night.
Panthus beat out of one overtime.
Any interest in the hockey, me and H.O.
Oh, oh.
596 on the pool.
And again, we apologize for this pool.
It really blows.
Oh, schlots.
No, I haven't.
I don't think I got that.
But I'll get back to it.
Thank you so much.
I think people might actually sense something that we care about.
Now that I'm deleting all these chronics.
Oh, and you should do this and you should steer the ship out of the...
Oh, God.
And leave a legacy for George.
That's the one that really sent me off.
Give me career advice.
Complaints and critiques.
Complaints and critiques.
Waa, waa, waa.
Blow it out your ass already.
I'm sick and tired of your complaints and your critiques.
My life is pretty damn good.
Now, guarantee you a hell of a lot better than many of yours.
Many of yours.
Not most of you.
I don't know you.
And you don't know me.
That's the thing that really gals me.
Is when I read these things and all like they know something about my life about me.
I'm a voice on a radio, okay?
Never met these people and right away their experts give me advice.
And I think to myself.
Boy, does he have a lot of cuts about...
Or she is the case maybe.
Although it's never she.
It's always a he.
At least so it's signed.
Except for that broad, one-need-it-or-what-over-name is in Louisiana.
Who was Jay Font for a while.
Till I looked up the email address.
You know, you can do that.
Yeah.
And Jay Font at Velsau.net turns out to be some woman in Louisiana.
Do you remember A fan?
Remember that?
Oh yeah.
So after the most recent cost of crap, I decided to look it up.
I sure did.
And it's some lady in Louisiana.
At any rate, 596 votes on this really bad poll.
We apologize badly.
Profusely, deeply.
Oh, and also before we read the poll.
I'm trying to stall it off as long as I can.
And they complained and critiqued the permit.
Let me say to you right now.
It's the 9th of December, 2008.
We have about what?
Let's see.
We had 22 days.
So three weeks and five years left on our deal here.
Five years and three weeks.
Got it.
Got it.
For the next five years and three weeks, what you hear now is basically what you're going to hear for that period of time.
This is as good as it's going to get.
It's not going to change.
It's not going to get better.
It's not going to get worse.
The show is what it is now.
Take it or leave it.
If you like it.
Yeah, but what if you?
Yeah, right.
And you should, if you would do this, if you would give it a joy, is it going to be serious?
I'm not going anywhere.
Okay.
I'm here.
My life is not so bad.
At two this afternoon, my cab guy will pick me up.
I could drive, but I don't, you know, I might be freezing crap, you know.
I just don't like driving and freezing rain.
You know what I mean?
But I trust my cabbie.
He's a good driver.
Absolutely.
Not as good as rain, man, but he's very good.
Two o'clock.
He'll be picking me up.
I have my pants, my shirt, my shoes, all of these things on.
And he'll cart me off to a wood mine and I'll win another a few bucks.
Or maybe I'll lose my ass.
I don't know, but I have a good time.
Six hundred votes on his really garbage pool.
I apologize to whoever sent it in because I'm sure they did it with the best of intentions.
But it just, first of all, it doesn't, it's not even written correctly.
I live in Paradise, South Florida, and last went to the beach.
Blank.
Now, how about I don't live there?
That should be added right away.
Okay.
Right?
Right?
I have a lot of people listening online who don't live in South Florida.
Six hundred votes.
I don't remember last time I used to the beach.
Two twenty five.
That's my vote.
So long ago, years ago, I used to enjoy Fort Lauderdale Beach once in a great while.
A long time ago.
You know, the interesting part of it when I lived in Sarasota in 73, I used to go to the beach all the time.
But maybe I'm either old or cravy or I don't know.
And Fort Lauderdale, I used to go to that beach too.
Back when the beach was really, really.
Yeah.
Back in those days.
Oh, baby.
It was kind of a beach.
But then they drove all the fags out of there.
They closed down those hotels and stuff.
What was that one pink hotel?
Was it the Marlon beach?
I don't know.
Well, why not?
From here?
Oh, I don't remember two hundred twenty six a month, meaning a month ago, a hundred eleven.
Two years ago, sixty five.
See, a go should be on all of these.
Two years ago, six months ago.
Am I right?
Right.
Two years ago, sixty five, six months ago, sixty four, three months ago, fifty seven, a year ago, forty four, never thirty five.
Never been to the beach.
How could you live in South Florida, never have been to the beach?
Huh?
Huh?
Right?
Huh?
Maybe you're allergic to what?
Huh?
What do you think of that zero last night?
Huh?
What a...
You know, thank goodness that he ran such a horrendous campaign.
Not that...
I mean, aside from the fact he's a daughtering old fool and she's an idiot.
But he ran one of the worst campaigns I've ever seen in my life.
Joe De Plummer, Joe De Plummer, any of the uh...
Whatever.
Any idiot.
So we have six hundred and two votes on there.
We got the new poll on them.
We're going to switch it soon with Fat Boy's approval.
Jeff says poll suggestion.
The most annoying thing you can walk in two from a sound sleep.
I like that, especially this morning.
Dog's barking baby crying, partner snoring, car or fire alarm, the TV blurring, etc.
I want...
What's the...
etc.?
And you know what else really frosted me about these damn emails?
What?
Now let me ask you a stupid question.
Okay.
I'm sure I know the answer already.
But I get just tons of these that are sent from an apple obviously from Macintosh that aren't compatible.
And so they wind up in all these goofy looking letters and looks like Chinese.
Okay.
And I just have to delete them because I sure can't.
Now if we were...
Hi, if we were doing another format besides Outlook Express,
would they still come through like that?
Yes.
They would.
Yes.
Well why is that?
I don't know why, go to the...
Wait, wait.
No, no, stop.
I don't know what they're doing and it may or may not have something to do with their Mac.
But they're doing something wrong because email for the most part is universal.
Wherever you send it from, wherever you send it to.
Yeah, you might get occasional weird symbols, but you should be able to read it over.
It's them not you and it has nothing to do with the software that you're using.
Oh, I'll screw them.
I get so many of those.
Must be a lot of stupid people out there.
Yes.
Here's one from Trent, who says, I'm moving out of South Florida finally.
So please play the Colt McQuay song.
I have no idea what that means.
The Colt McQuay song?
What?
What if that is?
No.
How about you, Tubby?
You know what that is?
No idea.
Do you know who Colt McQuay is or was or what that's all about?
I believe he's the Texas quarterback.
The Texas quarterback?
Yeah, the University of Texas.
The Long Homes?
See.
Well, why would we have a song about that goofball?
I don't know. That's only Colt McQuay I know.
The Colt McQuay song.
Oh, I see.
That was as a follow up to a toy the boy I guess.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
He was in the library.
Oh.
My 60 QAM.
I think.
Fourth.
The biggest name.
The best talent.
It's the mad dog Jim Manditz.
Afternoons.
Fourth of seven.
Sports radio.
Five 60 QAM.
The sports.
Sports.
Leader.
The O.
Yeah.
When William Shatner starts singing, even Star Trek fans start buying earplugs.
And now they'll be trying to escape at warp speed from his new holiday album.
William Shatner warps Christmas.
On the first day of Christmas, my true love themed up to me.
A drivel in a factory.
Get that thing out of him as disillusioned.
William Shatner warps Christmas is filled with beloved dual-tied songs destroyed as only Captain Kirk can destroy them.
Check on.
Roasting.
On an open fire.
Klingons.
Ripping off your nose.
Oh, that hurt.
Oh, thank you.
If you want to explore a really strange new world as Christmas,
listen to what William Shatner does to jolly old Saint Nicholas.
Scully old Mr. Spock.
Kling your point of ears this way.
Don't you doubt a single soul?
But I'm going to say we're totally surrounded by rungulent large heads.
It's the holiday CD that'll make you want to sit your phaser on kill.
William Shatner warps Christmas.
Silent part.
Deadly part.
It can tear your nose apart.
It can't be, but it can tell.
Someone did it by that awful smell.
What the hell did you believe?
It smells just like rock meat.
Silent part.
Deadly part.
I cut one and came out.
I watched a woman's head swivel all around.
She was wearing a terrible crown.
I walked right out of that place with a big smile on my face.
Silent part.
Deadly part.
Doing it is quiet and arty.
That one girl, but don't look back.
At the victims of your guess attack.
If you're in church when you do, you'll have to stay in your pub.
In number eight, my great, it's better to somebody I want to know who cut the cheese.
1034, so I got some good news and bad news.
Good news is I joyced.
That's why I played those two bits back to back there.
Yep.
Got that out of the way.
The bad news being the phone rang right at 1030 as soon as I was out of the way.
Oh no.
What?
Nothing.
I'm just being sarcastic.
Oh no.
What?
Oh, wait a minute.
Hang on a second.
Oh, see?
That's what I mean.
Well, anyway, they're here to check the speaker.
It's come out that my floor is where somebody stood off that alarm.
So they think.
I follow him right here.
Oh, I think they disappeared during that.
No, it was only like 10 seconds.
I know.
Don't get all panicking now.
Boy, it sure smells bad.
It must be that joy site dropped.
And that's like several feet away.
Oh, you think it followed me?
I just washed my hands.
Let him.
Oh no.
I sure hope that's not going to follow me around all day.
Shameless request.
It's been a list of your listeners for I.
Koon's age now.
Meaning many radio stations ago.
The emails have nice touch to your show.
Yeah, if we had any good ones, although today we're off to a pretty good start.
The complaints and critiques.
Bye bye so far.
If you could play the I'd like to buy the world of coke with the Sodom.
That would be great.
Says Bob.
What is that called?
What was that called?
I don't know.
We've got it.
Chicken that go no.
No, it's not his though.
Oh.
Then I really don't know.
Because I'm thinking something else entirely.
Are you sure?
No.
Maybe this is it.
Now that's not it.
I'll take it.
Well, let's just go all up and down all the Hussein songs.
No, but I do like that one now.
I don't know what it's called.
How about I'd like to buy you think?
I'd like Kathy this ski.
I'd like to kill Sodom.
The United States has no quarrel.
I think this might be a Iraqi people.
You think?
Our quarrel is with Iraq's dictator.
And with his aggression, Iraq will not be permitted to annex Kuwait.
Just the way it is going to piss us off.
Nice chunk.
I can't say and it's him with a fight.
Since I guess watched him patting smooth like a melee way to ride.
He tried to steal away Kuwait and beat the Oyeoshi.
He's a lovely, lovely, up to his face.
I'm blow away this ski.
I'd like to spend a day down the way.
I'll push out the head, push out the bow.
I'll fly with an attack.
I'll feel the challenge here with the ski.
I'm starting to pay.
Sodom Hussein, going to blow him away.
Sodom Hussein.
I'll tell you one thing, man, that people in this building are really nice.
Even though we have some dumb people like they got it set down there during that two-and-a-half-hour fire alarm.
And let it keep bat, bat, you know.
But they're nice.
Unfortunately, the two hot guys were not the ones that showed up here moments ago.
But that's probably still be occupied.
Is that bad? That's bad.
I'm just being honest.
I don't know how to relate out to you.
Oh, my God.
That's right.
Let's have some complains and critiques about that.
Oh, too much fag-talk lately.
Too much faggery with ed Jonas Brothers.
Oh, boy.
Everybody's got complaints.
Ed and four-lotter-de-I knew he was a closet case.
Ed says, yes, it was the Marlon Beach Hotel with its famous dances at the poop deck.
That's right, says Ed.
Here's an ad, an old ad for the Marlon Beach Hotel, where the boys are, it's Ed.
I wonder if Connie Francis ever wind and die in there.
You think?
Connie, baby.
What's she nutty?
Yeah, she had, like, I don't know.
What was her story? She had issues.
Isn't that amazing that I found that?
It is pretty much.
I mean, we got 80 billion bits in there, and the fact that we had no idea what it's called.
Wow.
What did I find it out of the under?
Don't, don't ask.
I'll never find it again.
Where the Glyam are?
This is Connie.
Connie.
Boy, it's a Marlon Beach Hotel on the poop deck.
Okay, that's an offer.
That's an offer, Connie.
Actually, she had some, I mean, I'm not saying that her music was great, but she had some interesting songs.
You know, some dance crap.
Like what else?
Everybody plays the fool.
Everybody's a foolish fool.
Everybody who works for New York.
Everybody's a fool.
Everybody's somebody's fool sometimes, especially if you work for a job in New York, though.
The things that crowd me in could feel and know what's wrong.
What else are you doing?
A wedding.
Oh, that's horrible.
That sounds like fiddling, man.
You see in W.
People all hit, by the way.
It's hard to find.
Yeah, I am.
My heart has a mind of its own.
Yeah.
Is that what that's called?
Yes.
Oh, yeah.
Let's just pop it up again.
Bring it around the collar and let's just time your singing.
Yay, yay, yay, yay.
Okay, let's do that.
No, no, there's more.
If you think that the Jones Brothers are all hits.
Who's starring now?
No, that's not it.
I can barely hear it.
Who's she up?
Who's starring now?
That was her biggest hit, I believe.
Was it?
Yeah.
They all sounded the same.
Exactly.
I'm still waiting for Who's Sorry Now.
I don't have that.
I don't have that.
You don't have that.
I don't know if that's her.
Who's sorry now?
You don't know if that's County Francis.
You're a crazy person, man.
All these years, that's the fact.
I didn't know it was.
Who's sorry now?
There was her biggest hit.
That was a smash.
Huge.
Kill that crap.
Okay, sounds like she's in the middle.

The Atheist Joe.
Thanks Joe.
Yeah, we've had a lot of those.
They sent them along and we read them.
I read them.
George Chuckles had them.
So, what's that called?
I don't think it's in here.
The Christmas New Yorker.
No, it's not.
It's not?
No, it's on ACN.
I thought I'm sure I put it in here.
What, what am I hearing?
My zipper.
New Yorker, I bet this is it.
Let's see.
Yep, here's Ricardo Motelbaum.
Where am I going?
Hello, Mr. M. R. W. W. W.
New Yorker.
This luxurious automobile has always delivered the performance you'd expect from a New Yorker.
And now, Chrysler introduces an onboard microprocessor which even speaks to you just like a New Yorker.
Hey, Moran, you want to put on your fucking seatbelt or would you rather eat the steering wheel, eh?
Ah, yes. This is truly a New Yorker.
Hey, genius, you left the goddamn headlights on.
Cheese, you want some, eh?
Oh, you know that.
And for the most dangerous city in the world, a security system second to none.
Hey, Bagel Bray, you want to lock the fucking doors?
Or maybe we should put a fucking sign in the window since Rip me off.
Yes, the Chrysler, New Yorker.
If you can find a better luxury car, buy it.
Ah, buy it as deep as you can.
I got your luxury right here.
How do you like that? I found that and I found that.
I'll be the other one and I'm finding it. Maybe I'll find me a good machine this afternoon and just stay there and play and never leave.
Just keep pouring the tickets out of there.
So I told you, did I tell you on the air off here about that crazy woman at the Saturday morning of Woodbun?
A different one?
A different one?
Oh, yeah, no, you told the story on the air.
They dragged her out kicking and screaming when I left you, was laying on the floor.
Oh, I, I, I, did you ever figure out what it was about?
No, no, well, how do you figure out? I mean, I'm somebody.
I'm a, I don't want to be a Yinto.
Come on now.
Like, uh, Lee Fowler.
I don't want to be Yenterman, okay?
I do want to be like Jim Schuyler though when I grow up.
Okay.
I do, I like that one.
I want to be, I want to be, I want to be, I want to be, I want to be, I want to be a Latino.
I want to be Brittany.
I want to be cremated.
I want to be like Jim Schuyler.
I wait to hear this.
Where the I grow up, I want to be just like Jim Schuyler with the $30 keyboard key.
He was good.
Yeah.
Anybody know what happened to him?
The last I heard, he was up in like Jupiter, that area, you know?
Oh boy.
And that was it.
That was it?
I mean, that's all I heard.
He's working for like a few bucks a week.
I didn't hear that.
I just heard he was scared.
Well, if he's in Jupiter, how much you think he's pulling down?
I got a location.
Look at that Chris there.
He's in Miami and he ain't making enough to even talk about.
Vicente says, what way to do you hear this?
Can you please play Jack in the box?
No, I just got through playing it the other day and said, I don't like it.
I hate it and I'm not playing it again anytime soon.
No.
And then it says Joe Ross, I effed him.
Oh, who's Joe Ross?
Never heard of it.
You think he means Joe Bell or Rose?
Joe Rose?
Joe Ross?
Typo.
Oh, Vicente, Mamma mia.
Oh, yeah, that woman was screaming and carrying on.
And I'm assuming that they nailed her for stealing somebody's ticket or stealing something.
Because they dragged her out of there and she was, you know what I'm saying?
In other words, she wasn't having some kind of an attack or a physical thing because there were no paramedics.
And believe me, they're loaded with paramedics there.
I've seen plenty of stiffs dragged out of that place.
Some of them still breathing.
It's the crazy season, man.
This is the time of the year.
They talk about how good she, you know, everybody's unemployed.
Everybody's getting their house foreclosed.
Everybody's, uh, don't have two nickels to rub together.
Look at Port Chris.
He's on the way out there screwing him over.
And everything on budget cuts, no matter news papers, radio TV, budget cuts, budget cuts.
I begin to wonder what that's all about.
I'm beginning to think it's a big scam.
Yeah.
We got spots up the ass on this station, man.
I don't see any fewer spots unless they cut the rate to like a dollar or a holler.
I think they make a lot of this crap up.
Oh, no, we can only afford to pay it.
And you know something I still say from where I sit on my fat ass.
I'm glad I signed the deal in spite of you and everybody else.
Oh, geez, norm is this.
I don't see anybody else signing any big deals.
I see a lot of guys out on the street.
I see that.
Yeah.
Budget cuts.
Remember those stories I had yesterday about this one and that one in Opian Anthony.
You know, Oh, free and Winfrey and all this one and that one and God free.
That's the new deal now.
Oh, and of course it's not taking long before the naysayers to like, oh, well, Illinois governor, you're all blah, blah.
Oh, you have it here.
He was, uh, he was appointing Obama successor and we got pictures of the two of them together and yada yada yada.
You know, it's just they just can't, they can't accept the fact that he won.
Not the only did he win.
He won in a landslide.
He demolished McCain.
Demolished.
Destroyed.
Shmeared.
He getting the big smear.
677 on the pool.
What do you think?
Should we change that pool?
I hate it.
Bless change it.
Well, I don't want you to go out in a blaze of, uh, mediocrity of me excellent.
Very good.
I couldn't say a better.
The blaze of this grace.
Although the next one's not much better.
What should every man know?
I think every man should know when to change the damn pole.
Like now.
Change it.
Leads.
Yo, Rogers.
Sport grade you'll 560 QAM.
Think.
4th lead.
The biggest names.
The best talent.
What's all it?
You're listening to sports radio 560 WQAM.
I am a Ford Laude dale.
This is the Neal Roger show.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this is your brain.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, uh, nor any questions.
Any questions?
Well, like he, like very much.
This air is the team.
I don't have him around for a while,
but I want y'all to know what up here in Rock and Roll Heaven.
I'll be thinking of you, this Christmas.
And I'd like to give y'all a special Christmas message.
A message of peace.
Like, how about a little piece of that high-go-on-bye?
Thank you.
Thank you.
A lot of fun.
A lot of fun.
A lot of fun.
Christmas is a time of who?
A time of joy.
A time of love.
And I sure would love him.
Thanks for that feature you got there.
Like it.
What more?
No more, what more?
Oh, yeah, Christmas.
The Christmas to me means family.
The family means friends.
The friends means getting together.
And getting together means eating.
Oh, past midnight comes the day which plays.
Well, it's like it.
Oh, very much.
Now just one more say to you right now.
You know, I may be a big star.
Make it too big.
But ain't nobody so big.
You can't reach out a helping hand.
A helping hand.
Well, would you hand me a helping of those mashed potatoes over there?
Would you please?
Like it.
Like it, very much.
Now like I was showing them, ain't nobody so big.
You can't stoop to help a friend of me,
you know, with a holiday season.
I'm speaking of season.
You're going to pass me that salt sugar when you get the chance.
Like it.
Yeah, just, just unscrew the color.
That's right.
Like it.
I don't remember.
So this Christmas, why don't y'all take a tip from old A.O.S.
Now I'll leave those steak tips right where they are.
You know what I mean?
I appreciate it.
I want you to remember, we're all part of God's great big family.
And you know God made man into his own image.
And look at the mirror.
I'd have to say God must be a big, big center of the universe.
You know what I mean?
Like it do.
But I especially want y'all to remember this one last thing.
You know all that whomever Christmas stringing that popcorn up on the tree,
save a big, big bowl for the can.
Extra butter to little man.
Like it do.
Like it.
Like it remember.
So go, go, go, go.
Look at all three and five, 60 WQAM.
Here's the end result from that first horrible pool, 677 votes.
677 votes.
I live in Paradise, South Florida and last went to the beach.
I don't remember how long ago, 242.
A month ago, 123.
Oh Eric did a good job on air as always.
He put a go on air.
Did Eric do it going to a go-a-go?
I guess so.
Nice going Eric.
He's always on top of these things.
A month ago, 123, 6 months ago, 70, 2 years ago, 68, 3 months ago, 66, a year ago, 48,
never went to the beach, 36.
Don't live in South Florida, 24.
39% of our audience don't live in South Florida.
They're listening online with Constantine.
Have you ever bought Constantine?
Nope.
He's dead.
You know who else is dead?
I got some bad news.
Get your music ready to crank up.
Oh my God.
Lead singer of the 60s group, the classic four dies.
Dennis Yost.
Dennis Yost, 65, help found the band who sits included spooky and stormy.
I don't think we can say spooky anymore, but we could back then.
Stormy, what was the other one?
Class X4.
Looking.
Boy, this thing's slow today.
I'm a good friend.
Like computer is slow today.
I just started it for that great.
Also, it's the holidays, man.
Just relax.
Everybody's taking a really slow.
They're shopping and schlepping and what are they stooping?
Whatever they're doing.
Faded on a grand.
That was the biggest hit.
I can't think of the name of a classics four and spooky, stormy.
Anyway, Dennis Yost died Sunday at Ford Hamilton Hospital and Hamilton, Ohio, respiratory failure.
Traces of love.
And that's it.
Traces.
Traces.
But it says, traces of love here.
Whatever.
What are they doing?
Probably some going.
He'd been in failing health since suffering a traumatic brain injury to fall this home in 2005.
Faded photo.
Yeah, I told you.
I don't know if I just need to know them.
Wow.
What?
It's an awful son.
Traces?
Yeah.
Get out of here.
Are you crazy?
I hate that son.
Oh my god, you need it.
But it's...
But...
Drawn and quartered.
The classic four had a series of hits including spooky traces of love and stormy.
Yost and native of Detroit played drums and sang.
That's spooky.
Alex Spooky.
Yeah, I bet you do.
That's him these days.
He was an original member of the band which formed in Jacksonville, Florida where Yost was raised in the early 60s.
In 67 the band we located in Atlanta, a year later they had their first national hit with Spooky.
Year later stormy.
Traces made this number two in 1969.
What was that one?
You just played it.
Storley.
Oh.
That same year, 69, the group had a top 20 hit with every day with you girl.
I don't like that one.
That sucks.
Buddy Bowie, co-writer of the...
I wonder if he's kid to Bob Bowie.
Co-writer of the group song with guitarist with JR Cobb said, then this had an incredible voice just a great voice for love songs.
The group eventually changed its name to Dennis Yost in the classics four.
I never knew that.
Not that we care.
Who cares?
Although the group's lineup changed, Yost continued to perform with the group till 2005.
Then he had a bad fall in his home.
You know, I noticed how many people have been cross-be had a bad fall.
Not that that was a bad thing.
It was good.
And many croaked.
And Dennis Yost had a bad fall and had any croaked.
Jan Berry on the other hand had a crash in that Corvette, a dead man's curve I think.
And he was like vegetable, including that concert.
Oh, I sure wish you never saw that.
I wouldn't wish that on anybody.
One more time, which ended, and then the daddies come on stage near like singing.
So to speak, singing.
Oh, God.
That was...
I played a little bit of that on the year, remember that?
Yep.
And I apologize for that right now.
But I'm sure nothing in that outlook expressed on those emails.
Dead is a door, Neil now.
Neil at Nearodges.com.
New people are just...
I don't know what happened.
We were off to a good start today.
No critiques, no complaints.
No complaints, no critiques.
And now...
That's it.
Even when I said we're taking all these requests and I've been playing them too, you know what I'm saying?
I've been going working my ass off to find even the name.
They don't even know the names of these bits and we're still finding them.
Right?
Yep.
It's amazing.
It's amazing.
And yet they're in a coma.
That's because I think I've blocked about, you know, 90% of the people are going to send any emails.
And for good cause too, I don't just block somebody just for the hell of it.
Because I don't like their altitude.
I block them if they're a pain in the ass.
Let me say it again.
We don't get paid to sit here and take abuse.
That's not the purpose of the show.
I know a lot of you are confused about that for years.
I thought...
No, seriously, there are a lot of these idiots out there who think that we're here to take their abuse.
He put on your spouse.
He put on your kids.
He put on anybody within the earshot and eye shot.
The sheriff.
Okay, here's the new pool.
This one sucks too.
Well, what do you want, it's the holidays.
What skills should a man know?
What was that?
My computer coming back here.
Why was it off?
I told you I had to keep restarting it.
It keeps crashing.
It keeps freezing up.
Well, I got news for you if you think about it.
I'll put it in the computer for the first time.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not going to worry about it.
I'm second-tiered to spending my money for equipment for the radio station.
Not to mention all of them, facts, paper, and drums and toner and crap that I buy here, which I've never built them for.
Come new years, though, by the way, that's going to change.
Every paperclip, every staple, every rubber band, I'm going to be charging them up the ass.
You'll see.
I'm going to be sending invoices for every piece of anything here.

It's been in the last one.
Oh, wow.
Oh, no, it's smith, you're a lot better than the last one.
Good, God.
Not even getting any emails from the fake this one and fake that one today.
Would not that I'm complaining, by the way.
Yesterday, the fake Barry Jackass was just all over the show, like Stink on Joe.
That's Jolly Joe Bell, by the way.
He do stink.
In every respect, if you look up the definitions of stink,
as he met a foul odor, a malodorist aroma that could put you in a coma, that's him.
Just his very presence could knock you out.
That's what the crystal of me.

When cops responded to a suicide of West Palm Beach, the Grizzly News didn't stop there.
I don't hear any sorrow that Dennis Yoast died.
Well, that's because you don't like this song.
Traces.
How could you not like this song?
Beside myself.
Don't kid yourself.
They may have another chilling discovery, a body stored in a cardboard freezer.
Cops said they got a call after a man found a suicide note stuck in his door from his father.
He found his father dead in a van in front of the residence.
When cops arrived, they found the grandfather's body in a freezer.
In a suicide note from the father, he said his elderly father was in his 80s,
and he couldn't bear to let go, so he froze the body.
And all that's to be fair.
What does that mean?
He couldn't bear to let go.
I don't know.
And on top of see, we performed it in a term, and the official caused it.
His body's grandpa's body's on ice.
And daddy, he's in a van dead in front of the, I don't get it.
I don't understand it.
Couldn't bear to let go.
Why beg your pardon?
He couldn't bear to let go.
Well, what does that mean?
You know, down is down 75.
Not that bad.

Especially considering everything that they're doing to us.
I think we're gonna do extra.
Do extra.
I'll, you know, I've got the, you know, the film show over there.
It's on the calendar.
Besides, this always always takes me to a more pleasant place.

You know, between the false fire alarms last night and the, uh, hysteria today and just all the stuff going on, I think it's time for me to go take a nap.

So the fake Alice Rand tells us what's your beef with the Miami dolphins?
My beef is, I hate them like poison. How's that?
Didn't you in fact, which have season tickets in the 90s? Yes.
What turned you off?
We actually paid for those ourselves.
What turned me off was the organization and the so called fans.
I'm not just drunken, just disgusting people.
And of course the crowd that sat around us, unless you were also a canes fan, then you weren't part of the fraternity, you know?
See, I didn't go to school at UM.
I broadcast a baseball games for six years and I had a good time doing it.
But I didn't go to school at University of Miami.
Thank God.
So why the hell should I be UM fan?
Was it Wayne purchasing the team that have an exciting overachieving team this year?
Plus Chad Pinnington looks good.
Not. No, he does not, Alice.
Alice gets him glasses, sweetie.
He looks like my ass on a bad day after a wild bout of diarrhea.
On top of that, Wayne is selling the team.
Are you going to jump on the bad wagon? No, I am not.
Fans should get the white handkerchiefs out this Sunday versus the 49ers.
Oh yeah, go dolphins.
Says the fake Alice Rand tell.
Likely story.
Now I want to read you an email that this email, it's very short.
Okay.
But this email epitomized, although it doesn't have any complaints or critiques that I know of,
although maybe it does, but I just don't understand it.
I'm going to read you verbatim what it says on this page.
All right.
From Bos, Florida.
It says,
associations because the Atlanta rhythm section.
One more time.
I'm just going to guess, right?
I'm just going to throw it out there.
Yeah.
They sent the email before they got done writing it.
Like, oops, clicked on the wrong thing kind of thing.
That's just, that's just my best guess.
Well, there's nothing else.
Right.
Oh no.
There's more there.
What?
How is this?
This for real or is this area death notice?
Stanley major 76 of West Palm Beach died November 28th.
In the Palm Beach post.
Can that be?
I don't know.
Well, you say it with such disinterest.
Oh, and I've got pictures of the dead people here, but not him.
It's got pictures of three dead people here.
How do I find this?
Oh, let's see.
Area funerals.
They're an alphabetical.
Let me.
I don't see no Stanley major.
Okay.
I don't see no Stanley major on here.
I think I'm googling obituary's area death notice.
It says.
Taylor Smith West funeral home.
Somebody's going to have to do some investigative work on that.
Because this one's from grubber tachas who is very unreliable.
Here's one that says also from grubber tachas is the true what they say about gerbils.
I don't know.
You would know grubber with your busy tachas.
Irving the Jewish dog with the armica.
Do you know what a really not neat email that is crap?
Kevin says I watched the Henry Rollins show on the IFC channel.
The day he was talking about that documentary you liked called Standing in the Shadows of Otan.
I happen to catch the film the other day for the first time on the same channel and you are both correct.
Absolutely phenomenal.
And Ben Harper does a great rendition.
I heard it through the great five.
Thanks for mentioning this film.
Ben Harper is great.
PS I'm related to the rest of this letter was a good Monday and a football game for once last night.
Did you watch it?
No, I did not.
No, I did not.
Let me say it again.
I didn't watch one moment of it because I have no interest in Tampa Bay.
Buckeneers or who did they lose to?
Chris.
They lost to Carolina Panthers.
Carolina.
Nothing would be fine to not watch Carolina.
Oh my God.
Talk about mediocrity.
Woo.
Can that be possibly true or Stan?
No.
No.
No, I mean.
Because we would have heard something more than that.
I'm going to email Stan right now.
I'm emailing him right now.
What day was it?
Ask him if he's dead.
Stan, are you dead?
Dead or alive Stan?
Here's another stupid email about the first Jewish president.
Oh my God.
The stuff that some of you people are sending.
I wouldn't wish it on Heinrich Himmler.
I'm a Heimlich maneuver.
I don't see Stan Major in this alphabetical list.
So that's a good sign.
Maybe he's still alive.
They hit him with five stowies and he's still alive.
How about how about if I type in the name?
I googled it.
I googled Stan Major obituaries.
Stan Major, this and that.
No, no.
I think I think a grubber just made it up.
Let's do a search for Stan Major here.
I'm doing a search in the obituary thing.
I don't got it.
No such thing.
The fact that he only sent me like that little bourbon.
Didn't send me the actual obituary.
Integrates to me that it is bogus.
Like most of his stuff, grubber taught us.
Chronic.
Here's one that says,
He's explaining how the beast has more spots than you.
It's the old nose-up-the-ass technique.
That's the answer to your question.
The old nose and the old...
Braco.
...ass technique.
Which is why the beast is still there.
That's why he's filling for DA to 11 a night.
It's part of the fact that management.
Upper management hates him on the ear like poison and deservedly so.
But he's got his nose and clearances.
Braco.
Ass.
Just ass me and I'll tell you.
Speaking of going to Woodbind today to a clock,
The Land O'Lakes woman hits $2.5 million jackpot on Wheel of Fortune slot machine.
Winner of the largest slot machine jackpot in Florida history said she played the machine
because she felt lucky and plans to use similar $2.5 million winnings to pay off her home in Land O'Lakes.
Where is Land O'Lakes?
I know they make a hell of a butter.
North of here in the middle of the state.
Butter.
Butter.
Manteiga.
Remember those spots?
Butter.
Parque.
Butter.
Parque.
Theresa Morrison, I think we already had this story, but you know, it'll kill some time.
She said she visited the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel in Casino Tuesday night for a card drawing.
She already won 200 bucks before she hit the Wheel of Fortune Mega jackpot worth $2.551.37.
The jackpot's linked to slot machines in a progressive Native American network of 300 casinos across the country.
Every time a coin is played in a linked machine in the network, the jackpot accumulates.
It goes up.
You see the little number at the end.
You know the pennies going up?
Yep.
Kind of like Watson Chris' paycheck.
See the pennies going up and down, mostly down.
Yeah, it's kind of like the jackpot's are so much bigger because so many other people are playing at the same time.
So Gina Morales spoke to him for the Tampa casino.
This was in Tampa.
Oh, well, F Tampa.
Morales said more who could not be reached started crying when she realized the jackpot was real and not a mistake.
Is real.
She called her husband who didn't believe her story until he talked away casino employee.
How do you like that?
Her doubting Thomas husband.
He said, oh, don't make up stories, bitch.
More in her family are leaving on a previously planned vacation to Vegas on Friday morning.
Oh, I wonder how much of it they can blow in Vegas in a few days.
More is winnings.
It clips the previous hijack pot of 2.3 million out in the Wheel of Fortune special edition at the Seminole Casino in Coconut Creature line 19.
The Seminole Tribe operates 7 casinos in Florida to associate it with hard rock.
I like the hard rock.
Just fine.
Let me say it again.
The one in Hollywood.
Now is there another one north of there?
Somebody keeps giving me a song.
There's like a coconut creek or that arrow.
I'm not talking about that one where you have to gum the gelo.
No, I'm talking about the one in Hollywood right up the road.
Yeah, no, that's the only one.
Are you sure?
No.
Well, let's say it.
I think it's that major dead or alive.
Okay.

Face down in a gutter.
My mouth tasted like mong.
My brain was like butter.
Crawled up on my feet and brushed myself off.
Little for stoking.
F.
Started to cough.
Reached in my pocket.
Pulled out my trusty AM radio.
Got ready for the evening with a stand major show.
Yeah.
Got ready for the evening with a stand major show.
Oh no.
Well, this group also made the same thing again.
And every other notice and doesn't say anything.
Right.
I saw the same thing.
Chris found it.
Found what?
That same notice.
That doesn't say anything.
Yeah, it doesn't say anything.
Now, just a Stanley Major 76 of Belgrade died September 17th.
September 28th.
September 28th.
September 9th.
Right.
Does that's the age sound right for him?
76.
He could be.
He was older than me.
I don't know if he was 10 years older, but he was older.
But he would have been in Belgrade.
Da-da.
Huh?
I know nothing.
We better put the audience on top of this one.
Here's a silly one.
It's our life instructions.
Yeah.
We need a lot more of that.
Critique's in the complaints and life instructions.
Since you've lived for so many years in Canada, more than 10% of your life, you're not eligible for citizenship in Canada.
You should apply for Canadian, we announce you a citizenship.
This way, if you went to jackpot, you won't have to pay US taxes on it.
And you obviously be spending the rest of your life there anyway.
No thanks.
Life instruction.
Come on, you need to do this.
You need to do that.
No, no.
Just turn your show on.
Did you discuss the new deal, J. Lennon got stays in NBC and goes on at 10pm every night?
No, I did not.
This is from the Faglery King.
I got it in my pile from little Tom Jickey, either the fake one or the real one this morning.
But I don't really care about J. Lennon.
Do you?
Nope.
If I ever saw him again, it would be much too soon.
But nevertheless.
So what do you think?
This is something to really work on.
If it was the stand major, wouldn't you think there would have been a little bit more to address that?
Yes, because they have a thing like notable people who have died.
And it probably would have been listed under there.
Craig's guilty plea to bathroom sex solicitation stands.
Oh, not Larry Craig.
He never has been gay and never would be gay and was gay.
Real toe tap.
Right.
The line I love in that one bit is he ain't taking no crap when he's in that stall.
Whatever he said.
Larry ain't taking no crap when he's tapping his foot.
The court of appeals rejected an appeal from Senator Larry Craig who was nabbed on a sex thing in a restroom with the Minneapolis St. Paul International Airport.
After his arrest, Craig mailed in a guilty plea.
That means you're guilty.
It says thanks for wasting the taxpayers' money you more on whoever sent this in.
Is that it?
All right.
That's it.
And that's going to butcher stuff about.
Oh, let's see.
Craig's lawyer argued before the state court of appeals September for the conviction to be tossed out for lack of evidence.
The senator and I don't know where public did not seek reelection in a large part because of his arrest and men's public tea room at the airport during a sex thing in June.
His attorney, Billy Martin, argued that Craig's conduct didn't constitute criminal behavior.
George is Natalie Hudson Thomas Kalatowski and Chief Judge and the Tucson decided to come.
You know something I'm never going to get my two grand back plus interest.
Maybe you're in the will Larry Craig and the yadi yadi who the who cares about him maybe he put you in his will.
And Woody grabers and you sent me by way of Woody Graber.
I just forwarded along picture.
You know who is that is that Joe Jonas.
I don't know.
From a concert, you know, he's standing there and he's got the thing in his hands on a microphone too.
I noticed he's got his middle.
Oh, I see looks like he chooses fingernails probably nervous.
Oh, wait a minute more stand major details ready for this.
I'm ready.
That that that.
I November 28th.
Oh, November 28th.
The other story said September.
I did not say that this was your stand majors.
Well, first of all, his name wasn't majors.
I was just asking if it was him or just the same name death.
How the hell would I know if it was him?
And I thought you want to go to the reading of the wheel to see if he left you the thousand.
It's 2000 by the way.
He died November 28th.
I'll see.
Here's the thing that says more.
Okay.
Now there would have to be more if it was the Stanley team major.
I clicked on more and here comes.
No, it's the same.
It's the same one sentence.
It keeps coming back to the area of death notice.
Wouldn't you think somebody would know?
Oh, here's the fake Alice Rantel.
That sounded like the great captain day from Zeta 4.
Was it whatever happened to him?
Oh, go away, fake L.
This is Manny.
Okay.
You know, that thing.
I'm sure you read that thing from the real Adam Kirschner.
Yes.
Or he says all these fakes were getting as like Manny Munozo with their IOD.
Do some work, Manny, if it's possible.
Okay.
If you got it in you, how come he didn't get came when a footy got blown out?
Oh, here's one in Arabic.
All right.
All right.
Whoo.
Boy, you know, that's probably a terrorist.
I chair that.
I think I know what incoherent email was about.
You mentioned earlier about a number of the classics for passing.
Members of that group went on.
Oh, I see.
To form the Atlanta rhythm section.
Says Joji.
Well, the other one didn't make any sense.
At least this one does.
Oh, here's Grover talk us this back again.
I did not say this was your stand majors.
Let me say it again.
His name didn't have an S on it at the end.
He felt compelled to send me this twice.
I just got through reading it out near the first time.
And he felt compelled to send it to me again.
What is that?
The light of the rhythm section.
Oh.
117 votes on this poll.
Would you have it in the first one, 678?
Correct.
You got almost 800.
You got a shot of the thousand altogether there.
All right.
Oh, I like that.
I think what you thought it was.
I thought that was soft so.
No.
You want some soft so?
No.
You got your soft so already.
Isn't tainted a lot by soft so?
Yes, but this is imaginary lover.
Oh.
Well, I guess that explains it.
I do like that a lot.
That's the Atlanta rhythm section?
Yes.
Now.
Oh, here's your soft so.
Here's one that says,
Rub-Sand is known for good luck.
And it's actually a, uh, well, it's a dummy, you know.
It's a penis.
Nekute.
Yeah.
Not sick.
Sick.
What should every man know?
There's only one that's getting a lot of votes.
How to undo a brow with one hand 50.
There you go.
How do we fight out about San Major?
I email him.
I email him.
Like I did and then we wait.
Did you email him?
I did.
And by this time tomorrow we haven't heard back.
And we'll throw a funeral for it.
What if he writes back and says, I'm dead?
We'll throw a funeral for it.
Here's one that says,
don't know where the beast's face starts and fat joebells ass ends.
No, it's not so much joebell.
It's a clearance.
That's where he's got his, uh,
rectum.
No, it's buried in clearances, uh, ass and privates below the waist.
It says here,
you're right.
Complaints and critiques all you hear from South Florida.
I wish I could live anywhere but here.
Keep up the good work or just keep it up.
Be happy from stuck in South Florida.
See, people think I make those up.
A lot of people that want out.
They want out now, but they can't afford to get out.
They're stuck.
New York City day,
who's really chronic says about Stephen Bauer.
I was listening to last time yesterday,
showing the archives I couldn't agree with you more.
Thief of Hearts with Stephen Bauer was a good movie.
I thought I was the only person like that will be said.
No, I liked it in Georgia.
I liked it just fine.
I'm ready.
I do.
And in closing, I don't think the Rangers could score in a lady's prison
with a fistful of pardons or with their sticks.
Your show is great.
Well, thanks New York City Dave and go away.
Take a little rest.
You're way over the top.
All over the top.
They've been doing pretty good today without too much complaints
and critiques except that guy who tells me I should give up my US citizenship
and become a connocton yada yada.
No, thanks.
No, thank you.
Things the way they are are just fine, okay?
Shirtless pictures of the Jones Brothers already seen that a million times.
And boy, do they look...
I don't know.
Joe looks pretty good.
There he's kind of hidden with those shades, you know?
Hey, Joe, take it off in the shades, too.
But the other two, my God.
The little one there.
I'm serious.
He looks like post-Aushwitz.
Give him a salami sandwich.
Give him something.
Put a little meat on those bones.
But Joe looks pretty good.
As if I haven't already scoured in the scene.
Oh, this is from Gruber Tuchus again.
Hey, Gruber.

Someday we'll all be dead.
The minute we're born, we start dying.
We die a little more every day.
Young or old, with your poor, there's nothing we can do to stop it.
So, look long at that Christmas tree.
It may be the last one that you've seen.
Decorate your house in green and red.
Because someday you'll be dead.
Dead dead dead.
Someday you'll be dead.
Dead dead dead.
Someday we'll all be dead.
It might happen in a couple months or 50 years from now.
But no matter when it happens, it will seem too soon to you.
So, we sure on Christmas Eve when you snuggle it.
That you thank God for your family.
Because someday they'll be dead.
Dead dead dead.
Someday they'll be dead.
Dead dead dead.
Someday we'll all be dead.
Who knows how many Christmas is left in their short life?
Nobody knows, that's my point.
Enjoy the while you can.
And so on Christmas morning, let good tidings fill your head.
What a festive season.
Someday you'll be dead.
Dead dead dead.
Someday we'll be dead.
Dead dead dead.
Everyone you know, dead.
I'll bury Merry Christmas to you.
Dead dead dead.
Dead dead.
Merry Christmas everybody.

Very jackass has outdone himself.
Greg Voodelle's old bitchie were and it didn't make any sense at all.
It's got a picture of Billboard, a Greg Voodelle W.
Well, less than Chicago 100 years ago before he wound up in Alabama with a banjo on his thing.
I mean, we take a lot of time, but I don't think so.
It's just Kaka, you know?
Yeah, Kaka.
Even the fakes are out of material today.
I understand it's, you know, December 9th.
You're very close to Christmas, Tannuka, all that stuff.

Yes, I would mind.

This case may be boring.
Incredibly boring.
Self-appointed expert.
They're all experts.
You don't understand that.
Complaints, critiques, and expertise.
That's what we get.
Oh, Maria Bartoromo.
She says, I don't hear you're talking about the Obama bounce that's taking place in our markets.
The market is up over the past two weeks, and I warn you, the loony is up against the dollar.
It's always a buying opportunity on CNBC.
And I hope you and your listeners take advantage of our free markets society, sincerely, Maria V, with a big bags under the eyes.
It's always a buying opportunity on CNBC, because they're peddling.
Let's put some lipstick on this, Pigter.
Oh, it's the new economy against the old economy.
Don't forget that one.
Oh, well, etc.
Peddling, peddling, peddling, peddling, peddling, cram.
That's what you're doing at Maria.
The Dow is down to 103 points.
I just would hasten to add that.
I could look up and see what the loony is, but then I'll get that email from that.
Oh, well, you talk about us, sir.
T.S. X and the loony and spin all the oil is $43.08.00.
You want to buy a few barrels?
Yeah.
Let's make a good boil, jolly, joy and oil, and put clearance in there too.
And then squeeze in Joyce.
Oh, God.
Can you see the three of them boiling an oil in a big barrel?
Roll out the barrel.
We'd have a party like you've never seen.
Am I right?
Am I free?
Oh, yeah.
Freaking lootly.
I'm waiting to see the loony come up here, because Maria advised me.
I think it was around 80 cents.
79 points, something the other day.
Not that any of you care.
Oil, $43.09, dropping like a rock.
I'm serious.
One of these days soon, you're going to go into the gas station.
They're going to hand you $100 bill.
Say, fill it up.
Oh, it is.
Start that.
Fill up.
Take all the gas you want in here.
Oh, 79.25.
No big problem there.
Maria, everything's fine.
It's down at a nice low number, Maria, with diarrhea.
Here's a fake one here.
It's for a little, a little sarcasm in this one.
What?
I'm stuck in South Florida.
I'm at the Camilla South.
I can't afford the bus fare to Toronto, so I can come big for a spare change in the Sub-Zero snow.
Come get me, Neil.
No thanks.
You stay there.
I'll stay here.
Okay?
I'm not begging for change.
I'm not even feeling the change.
This one says, I'll bet that most of the voters in today's pool don't remember or never.
Are those who don't live in South Florida since you've had to put it on the pool?
That was the one about the beach.
Okay, forget about it.
Old news.
Old news.
Old email.
Getting through at the bottom of the pile.
And that's because there ain't nothing coming in but crap.
Oh, you ought to see what's coming like the last 20 minutes.
I just don't even know.
I'm not even complaining.
Critiques just stupid, stupid pictures of a little, oh, just crap.
Just unbelievable crap.

I don't know how to drive a stick.
66 years old.
I don't know how to drive a stick.
I don't want to.
You don't know how to do the one that's in first place.
Oh, I don't want to either.
I'm not.
You want a stick or a stick.
Under a brow of that hand or driver.
And those are one and two.

So what story with Stan.
Come on God almighty. I'm sure there's no story with stand you know I go with him like you
I even put radio and he he doesn't exist I
Found him on the where they know you did yeah, but it's an old entry from 2002. Oh, well. He wasn't dead then well
Oh, here comes some a form is for me to sign

Okay, from my financial guy. Oh, please call me before faxing
Both forms need to be sent signed or whatever
Excuse me while I send these very important financial forms. I'm not really sure which name am I supposed to sign? Oh

Here we go
Sign on the dotted line. Okay
Done
In fact, I think I'll call him during the next break. So if I don't come back like right on time that's because I'm on the phone. Okay
Well, like I said, it's a very casual show now, you know, like
Very laid back. Real formal. No pressure. We get a one-shear. We get a nine-shear. We get a five. It does make hands of him
Why should we care about numbers when they obviously don't?
They think they think that numbers and listeners are gonna fall out of the sky. No items in this view
Now wouldn't you think we'd already have a hundred although he's I guess the forgotten man. That was down 88
Stanley T. Major the forgotten man
How can we find out? I mean, that would be a sad thing. I mean, you know, he does owe me the two grand
I don't I don't harboring any yield feelings to him even though he you know stiff me for two grand
And went to Disney World with the kids that very next weekend. I'll tell you what since uh, you know
We're talking about it on the air. I'm sure somebody
We'll let him know that though we're looking for him or he'll read his email and reply to it
And what happens if two o'clock comes and goes I'm gonna have to be sitting at my machine. It would buy him worrying his stand then
Yeah, right if I lost my two grand forever. I can't see that. Yeah
What you ringing your hands
Yeah, I'm ringing it and ringing the bells
Oh look at that the beast has a mouthful of clearances. I can't say that on here. I could but
I'll leave you wondering what it said. Okay, something like Gunnysack the thousand 101 points

With that famous one small step
I can't remember each event or everything that man did invent
A century we were present
This is how it went
My my how the time it did fly since it started some departed manities we did try
For the century it's time that we say goodbye it all happened in the blink of an eye
A hundred years have gone by
He'd all started when two guys were right when they put an airplane into light
In the start of radio
Sigma Freud had his mom to think and want some theory and max blank and the Titanic that story

Somebody has to win the season's exciting as opposed to everyone hoping the pants would lose last year that was boring
I have three radios going around the house or wherever I go to hear you. It's like you're a god
I'm not your friend, but a dedicated listener says Sam. I'm your friend not well. Thanks Sam

891 I'll take your word for it. You're gonna make it fat. So you're gonna make your thousand
I think today if they get put the pedal of the metal well
The I don't want to read the poll result because it's just there's just too many choices on there
Just too many it's there's nothing interesting nothing exciting. It's got no possess
It's got no schmaltz to it, you know what I mean no schmaltz
I'm going back to bed and keep my two hours. No, no, no, yes. I am right now. No, I'm gonna set the alarm for two

Did I watch the Leafs game? No
I recorded it
Final score Leafs four Islanders two. How do you like that? Panthers beat Ottawa four three. Did I watch that? No
I was I don't know what I was watching the idea that every time I was sitting here watching sports on TV
I watch a lot of I was watching racing from wherever
Actually, I wasn't from Dover Downs
You think I was watching racing from Dover Downs? No, no, well, I just made that up. I can I can turn on out though
Although it's afternoon
And we're probably got a live racing going on right now. That's filled it off you park one minute to the first race
12 horse field and it looks uh, it looks not that bad there
Cold and a little murky maybe but no rain no snow
And the horses the third breads they're dancing around like China dolls
That's the thing I can't stand about third bread. They're so fragile man so high strung and so fragile
And they come up before the race and they like they dilly dally around a little bit for
For a 16th of a mile and then when the race is over like three quarters of a mile six four longs or five and a half four longs
God forbid or even five for one they look like they're gonna croak
You know what I mean? No, what do you mean? Can't wait till Gulfstream though
Me either
Now a little bit confused how long did that go on that went on for months because we remember we were doing
Casting from wood by right well wood wood by not on Sunday just cancel the racing because of the bad weather
And that was the last day of this meet and I'm sure they don't start again to the spring
So I guess this year will be like doing at the least once a week like on Fridays we did it right that was down 114
Right
The governor was asking whether to be more layoffs
So we have a governor in this modern times the only one who's looking for more layoffs
You take that what's going on it edit to the fact that we have a Senate seat that seemed to be as recently as days ago

He's a black newsreader and he's got a great deep voice and he's he's just great. He's good does he yeah
Does he have a mustache no okay better don't know who that is he's got a big head
Lester hold he's a million times better newsreader than freaking Brian Williams
And you know why I watch Brian Williams because I'm not gonna watch old funny that he Charlie Gibson on ABC
And I'm sure it's I'm not gonna watch that bitch on CBS

Nice Jewish boy like Richard Weinsteinstein
Steen

Yeah, I get the email, but uh are they coming in off of that? Are they filling them out on that? I don't know
How do we know you don't maybe we don't know
It's just uh Eric gets a copy as well. Just like we don't know about Don web dead or alive. Who don web
He was on channel two. He was a very very pseudo intellectual
boring kind of guy. I mean, oh
Maybe it was k a t where I worked with Don web not them in just news. I don't know
Anybody out there? Remember Don web. No
I'll tell you one thing
I've survived. I'm a survivor. Remember that song by the monkeys?
Is that the song? I always say the wrong huh? No
What's it called? I will survive by glorigator lever. Oh, I'm a believer
I'm not a believer, but I'm a survivor. Is there such a song as I'm a survivor? Find out
No, I will survive by glorigator. Oh, not that. Oh, you can me that's disco. That's uh, yeah, and that's that
Not that I don't like it. I like it fine, but it's awfully gay
Let's see. Carmelita says I need you guys help
This is just silly crap in my office my boss's secretary keeps looking at me and staring me down
One time I walked past her and she slapped my ass. What do you think I should do? She's looking at me right now with a smile
I would surrender is what I would do. I just have some wild monkey sex with your boss's secretary
Right, and it sounds like a plan. Sure. Is she hot?
It
It sounds like it doesn't really make any difference
She patted around the ass. Maybe she thought she was a football player
Or baseball some kind of a jock
Q.A.M. is the only radio station in America where the sales people pat each other on the ass after they make a sale
Anyway, oh, I did I have all these all on the bottom of the pile and these were from earlier earlier earlier that's okay
Close down to her the end of the show because they're all listen to rush now, you know
Want to know tada tada tada yeah
Fat pill popping hypocrite the real Adam Kirchner here it says to me and George we both got this
It says so every couple of days my girlfriend comes home from work and yes
The ice princess and I divorced a few years ago
Was she that real scrawny bitch he was married to hi? I guess
You don't know
I mean I wouldn't have described her scrawny
For my thinking of Tommy's girlfriend.
I don't know.
Remember Tommy's girlfriend?
Yeah.
She weighed about eight pounds.
Yeah.
That's the one.
Maybe.
Well, why are you talking about?
I don't know who you're thinking about.
Oh my God.
I don't know what's up in your head except for a bunch of gay thoughts.
Well, that's right, but I'm talking about chicks now.
Yeah.
Tommy used to have a skinny girlfriend.
I mean, you say, is that who I'm talking about?
Anyway, I don't know.
Adam says, my girlfriend comes home from work and says, Neil read another email from
some guy called the fake Adam Kirschner.
She listens in the car lunch.
He's a high school teacher.
My guess is that it's the manny guy over at W.I.D. trying to live I curiously through
me.
Let's face it, working over there can drive you nuts.
He's probably bored and having to get the Jimmy Cifalist coffee, yelling at the board office
and crank calling the shows on his own station.
He was always the freighter who produces back in the day.
Too bad none of us had a boat.
But what does that mean?
Oh, for freighter.
I was slow today.
Sorry.
I didn't have my sleep.
We had those phone fire alarms.
This is building security and I'm going back to Injury now because I'm worried.
Oh boy.
There must be an awful lot of all there are.
They're like a billion Chinese and a billion engine and they're all here.
You have never seen so many India people in your life is here.
Food job.
Really?
Anyway, Adam says I have a real job now.
You feminism for not in radio.
So I don't get to listen to that often.
But anytime I do, I'm glued to the radio just like I and all the rest of the chronicles
always have always will.
Hi, Manny.
If you're listening to this, Adam, the real Adam, aka the fake guy with the eyes, whatever
that means.
To the joke.
To the accepted healer.
Well, what does that mean?
It speaks for itself.
In other words, not funny.
Right.
Thanks, Adam.
We miss you badly.
He was always one of the good guys.
No?
Sure.
What are you?
Well, you say that like you don't mean it.
I absolutely do.
Never had a crossword with him.
Chris, did you hear a long pause there a little bit?
And he said it very insincerely.
He had to think about it for half a century.
Remember that song by the McGuire sisters?
Yes.
Insincerely.
Remember that?
We used to chum around all the time.
You and Adam, who's a good guy.
But you don't want, you're just hard-ass.
God.
That was down to 82.
He said, blah, blah, you know, you've a blah, you've sold influence like a salesman
meeting his annual target, like a traffic cop getting his annual monthly quota on the
traffic tickets.
Oh, by the way, I had a, I hope I didn't lose it.
Here it is.
See, this is not timely.
Remember the end of the show yesterday in the cop?
I said, oh, don't be racking on the guys who write the traffic tickets.
That's their job.
That's what they're told to do.
Remember that?
Well, I got one from Jimmy yesterday.
I read it to PM right after we went off the air.
And Jimmy says, please tell that A-hole cop who emailed you that I know of another group
that was doing just what they were told.
They were called Nazis.
I've been caught a more speed traps than you can imagine.
All I was doing was keeping pace with the rest of the psychos on the road.
If I'm not going 100 miles an hour through a school zone, I've got 20 cars up my
ass tailgating me, honking and flashing their lights.
Give somebody a badge and a gun and they'll find any reason they can to screw with you.
These cops are the same buffoons from high school who couldn't make the football team
or get laid so they become cops and take out their failures as human beings and other
people.
Hey, copy, mailer.
Why don't you de-bags trampling over the blind octogenarians who do 50 miles an hour
on the turnpike?
That's right.
They vote and scum like you need a job.
Have you considered Barber College?
Wow.
Pretty hostile to our policemen friend there.
It's hostile, but I think you know, in some cases, very accurate.
I never in all my life saw anybody pulled over for going too slow.
No.
And having lived down there for over 30 years, I mean, how can you not see somebody pulled
over for going too slow?
And especially here, slow is like their middle name.
Slow.

This city is impossible
this city is impossible
this city is impossible
hyung Memphis!!!
one, four, five, 60 WQM. I just felt I was like a little incomplete need like an
exclamation point like like that. Little extra stucque there. Oh yeah, a little
not a stucque. No. A shot. Stucque is like a stamp. Oh, okay. Like a stamp in a
bag. Like we get a QA model. You know, they should have classes. I would take a
class. You just classes? Yeah, I got a book. I got a tape, but it's not enough. I
know. Tom says, didn't Don Webancor the news with Joe DeNarner with WTA in
Pittsburgh in the 70s? I have no idea, Tom. I have no idea. And probably there
were like a hundred guys in radio named Don Web, you know, like like Johnny Dork.
Sure. Johnny Dork. Johnny Dork. Haven't heard from him today. Thank God. Johnny
day. He's probably a doodah is hanging it out. Imagine the gravity guy says, yes,
holds a good newscaster. Good newsreader. Lester Holdy's he's not good. He's great.
I don't want to say it's a racial thing over their NBC, but somewhere along the
line. Now let's see. ABC had Max Robinson, right? He was a black news anchor. Right?
You asking me? No, man. And CBS has had what's his name on 60 minutes? The black guy.
Yeah. What that was his name? You expect me to remember with the earring? Oh my
god. And Bradley. What is wrong with you? What's wrong with me? Yeah. You don't know
your sparsers, Mr. You better start learning some old guy on TV. I know Andy Rooney. You
don't know what Bradley. You know what Bradley. Yeah. That is a real no less
least all. Yeah. Somebody out of bitch slap her man, especially after that.
South off. He should would enter an inskalea that time. Remember that plugging his
book. I don't like her. I hate her. I don't dislike her. I hate her. I hate
Leslie. After that scalea thing up until then I could, you know, I could deal
with her. Anyway, it says holds a good news reader. I cut him on the
financial a few occasions plus a bunch of times on MSNBC a couple of years back.
And yes, and responses to Georgia's query. He did wear mustache for a while. I
don't remember that. Okay. That's what I do. No. You're talking about. You do know?
Yeah. Lester Hold. Apart from TV news, he's actually put a newscaster in some
movies too. The fugitive Miracle on 34th Street and Primal Fear. How do you
like that? Huh? A newscaster playing a newscaster? What a concept?
Coincidence like Ann Bishop and Glenn Rinker in the shining. weren't they the
ones in the shiny TV? And he liked that man Bishop and little Glenn Rinker
who came up to a man's kneecap. Well, if you think Bob Mayer sits on a lot of foam
books doing the news, they must have like a 20 of them for little Glenn Rinker.
He was like a puppet. Oh, did you see that movie about the little people? What
does it call? Was it a boss? No. The mad scientist who created the little
people. I talked to you a couple of weeks ago about that. You never saw it. Dr.
Cyclops or something. No, no, no. The attack of the something people. And
and then of course the one with the thing with two heads. Right. Tomorrow I'm
going to get on what you call it. And I'm going to send it to you. Amazon. This
this isn't like that book that took forever to get in. By the way, I've been doing
pretty good but not there. Look, there's no book that could have been how to
win into slot. Okay. It was for fun. No, it was fun. It was great. And
it's good reading material on the can. But in terms of slot secrets, the only
thing that was pretty interesting was about the RNG and how it's a myth. But
what differences are made? I think that as opposed to reading any book, if you
play the slots a lot like a fool like me, you learn more about the patterns and
the behavior of the machines than you ever could possibly reading about it in the
book. You know what I mean? Yep. And these close misses. Nobody's going to tell
me their program to come up like three or four in a row. Oh, gee. Psychologically
you keep you playing that machine pouring the money in there. Feeding, feeding,
and feeding. And twice on that great CBS series, Lester Hold, early edition,
where Kyle Chandler's character got tomorrow's newspaper delivered by
yellow pussycat, which then compelled him to prevent as many transges as he
could because he knew all the details in advance. I never saw that. You see that
early edition? I heard about it, but I never saw it. I never heard about it. I never heard of it. Did you see it?
Tommy? No. Signed regards the gravity guy. Thanks gravity guy. There's a guy that knows
Lester Hold is a serious newscaster and should be on and the fact that Tom Bocaw
was on there, minsing his way through all those years of being unable to speak. And the fact
that Lester holds like the weekend guy on the sideline. If I don't know why the
racial thing doesn't come up with that. Here's one that says Max Robinson was okay,
but he died of AIDS. Yeah. And so what does that mean? But he was okay, but he died of AIDS.
So he's not okay. Oh, I guess that makes him not okay. Right. I guess that makes him gay or something.
And the same stupid crap from the same stupid people. Oh, look who's deleted and blocked.
Jerome Scroggins. Huh? Let's go to my deleted items.
And empty. I've got a good formula now.
I can just see the names. They're they're highlighted because it tells me that they're blocked.
They're in a dark heavy dark print. And so you delete and they disappear forever.
So keep sending me all your swell. You're wasting your time. 312 on the podium. What you got? You got 990.
990. You need only 10 votes for a thousand today. Granted, we did 75 different polls.
And they all sucked. Who cares? Right? Right. Now here comes a little
countertops on the show from Ian subject German pronunciation. If it's a German base name,
the second vowel is dominant. Wine sign. At first of all, he's got a spelled wrong.
Anyway, would be wine steam. Refinstall would be reef and stall. I before E except after me and
up yours. That's first. No, it's not right. First of all, nobody spells their name.
W E I N S T I E N. Nobody would say that. Wine steam. Steam German. I can understand it.
But how would you know if somebody spells it? And that's not right. And however, it was pronounced
over there. We're in America and people pronounce their names. However, the hell they want.
Rubenstein or Rubenstein. Right. How about Arthur Rubenstein? Rubenstein. See what I'm saying?
And they both spelled E I N. Don't give me this I E N crap. Okay. You will listen to me. Ian.
If he have theirs. That's right. Don't give me this German crap. Germany and what you think
it is. Believe me, Berlin. Colone. Wonderful places. Good food, too, man. And how that answer
name is like folding up all the sex and the drugs and everything else, all the fun. Then who
now? I don't want to go there. Certainly, like I said, not for food. Oh, the ducks with
their pea soup. Man, I'm going to be surprised if they get some of their meals out of the
canals. I really wouldn't. Some of that dirty brown water. Remember that by the sand
dills? Yep. What was the name of that song? Dirty water by the sand dills? That was a melody
of their smash. You know what? We got it. Bum. Bum. Bum. Bum. Bum. Bum. Bum. Bum.
See that? What a memory man. Red label. I can hear what the label was. I got a
great point. What year? No, 66. I was close. When you said it like I was like 20 years
off, 40 years off. God, what's wrong with you? The blazing going shock. 2001. We got a thousand
on votes. We did it. Senator Craig loses video with drug-gilded plea. We just talked about
that an hour ago, but thank you anyway, Ed. Thank you. Larry Craig. I guess I'm going
to have a good name. The best talent. The best talent. The best talent. The best talent.

Sacka girl.
Hey, you can't suck a girl.
No, Wally, Sack.
Sacka, you see, you don't even speak the lingo.
I get girls all the time.
Yeah, but that's different.
It's just a kid.
Oh, yeah?
Does a kid carry these around in his wallet?
Hey, beef.
Yeah.
Went down to the drug store and picked him up.
You know, you got to protect yourself, Wally.
Uh, boy, as your mother and I are going down to the drug store, we'll be back in about
half an hour.
You see?
Oh, no, there's one couple who can't even imagine we're doing any hanky spanky, you know
that?
No.
Warden, June.
Well, there you go.
There's one of them, and I bet you all the other ones are Clint Eastwood too.
Right.
So I'll play him all the same.
Surrel trouble.
Girl trouble one.
That's my favorite word.
Well, which one is that?
Cut number one.
It should be listed.
No, they all say, do we leave it to me?
We're number one, two, three.
But I'll do leave it to be risen.
Let me say it again.
There are cuts one through seven, four, two, forty, six are the numbers on the disc.
There it is.
Which one is it?
Uh, forty three.
Forty three.
Forty three.
Okay, coming up after the break.
Now can we get back to, there you go, Jean over there.
That's, uh, that's an honor of Jean being a long, long suffering, a listener.
Thanks, Jean.
Now here is, and then this was very early.
You see, uh, this is from yesterday's matter of fact, five, eleven, p.m.
Rick, home page question mark, and I agree with Rick.
Cheese, Bob Lasseter is still on there and Tom Brady and vote for the Schwarz or whatever
it is.
And Sarah's fifteen minutes is up and Bush is being drunk at the Olympics.
Come on, get rid of it.
You are absolutely correct.
And Brady Quinn, get rid of that ugly-assed OJ off too.
Just some constructive advice.
Well, see, this is, this is good.
Not a complaint, not a critique.
Just some constructive advice, which he's right.
The website needs cleaning up.
Haven't I told Eric you rid of that Sarah Palin crap?
Not enough.
Write him an email.
No, you read it to him.
You got him in the little box.
He's listening now, maybe, and maybe he's eating a big salami sandwich.
You know, that sounds really good.
Maybe I'm going to have lunch at Woodbine and not eat the candy bars before I go.
Okay.
Good?
No, it's not a good idea to beat those snickers before I go.
I have the habit of doing that.
I make my cabbie guy wait like an extra minute.
I go running over to the little convenience store.
I give me two snickers with almond bars and then I hop in the cab and I eat them on the way.
Sending my blood sugar skyrocketing.
You know the rain has already washed almost all the snow away.
Oh, a happy day.
And that good news?
Yeah.
So what are we going to do about the website?
I just sent Eric and I said, Ricky Romer.
The fake name that was going to help us in the coming to find out it was Ricky Roma from Glenn Geary Glenn Ross from Glen Hill.
Some constructive advice, which is right.
So Eric, the first thing we do is give it all that Sarah Pellan crap.
Tom Brady is Tommy boy on air still.
I mean, let me, I don't, I very rarely look at the homepage.
Do you?
I mean, we got our own page.
Yeah.
So why would you look at the homepage?
Yeah.
I don't want to take that Brady Quinn off in the shower.
Take the one off of me that 20 year old one when I was grotesque with the big boobies.
Well, they've seen that enough.
Betz, your long vote for that.
I like that.
That's cute vote for the schwarzer.
I think that's cute.
Even though it's fake.
You don't like it?
Whatever.
And leave up the certainly leave up the DVD thing there.
The clip of the IOD appearance.
With me in fat rich.
No George in that though.
Nope.
I was probably writing the board back to stations.
So I'm really there and spirit.
I'll be there.
Is that who that was that?
That's not Levi.
Is it no, he's two, this guy's two ugly Levi stubs.
No, Levi's Sarah's fiance.
Now, I wonder whatever happened with that.
You think that wedding is off to?
Don't know.
And Bush, the Bush picture is the drunken boy.
Well, just take a bunch of stuff down.
Will you and the rest in peace last year?
Do you think it's time to take that down?
Yes.
Now, the one we're marked fully grappling with this conscience
and with that young guy, I think that should stay up there.
There is a message to all you closet fags.
Okay.
You're all coming out.
All you closet queens, including our governor.
Limpress, Chris, you're all coming out.
You fairy.
So thanks, Rick.
Good constructive advice.
That was down 145.
Oh boy.
But it's almost 8800.
That's not so bad.
Not good.
Not so good.
I wonder how come Maria hasn't sent me any more information about it.
Well, maybe it's a buying opportunity now.
Anyway, Carmelita, remember she asked you advice about the bitch
in the office that's Googling her?
Yes.
Says no, she isn't hot.
She's about six foot five, at least 350 pounds,
and has a lot of facial hair.
Need your help fast?
George, what would you do?
Law suit.
You know, lawsuit.
Human resources.
That's a whole harassment.
That's right.
Now, Steven Kendall, who's trying very hard to help me out here, but he's full of it.
Thank you, Heratman.
Sorry, Steve says I believe the pronunciation of Stein versus steam has to do with spelling.
My ex-wife is German, and I tried to learn that God awful language, but this is what I remember.
Yiddish is considered low German.
Stein, long eye like eye, STEIN.
STIIN, which I've never seen in my life.
Long-e like Steve, STEIN.
Or the German spelling of beer pronounced beer, B-I-E-R, beer, like Darrel beer.
You ever bet on Darrel beer?
No.
Sean beer?
Who?
Don't do it.
Okay.
I believe the corruption of Stein being pronounced STEIN is an error from coming to the US and trying to adapt.
Kind of like Vito from Cholione.
C.
Vito from Cholione.
Vito Cholione.
And it's signed long and ponderous Steven Kendall.
I don't know.
I've never seen, I could be wrong, but I've never seen goldstein, gold, you know, I'm confused.
How about Steve Geltstein?
How about Geltie Geltstein?
He would know, wouldn't he?
Ask Geltie.
If it's Geltie Geltstein or Geltie Geltstein.
Next time you see him in the hallway, ask him that.
Are you guys just speaking terms or what?
Yeah.
Remember, he's gonna told me that on it.
I was afraid he likes us ripping him an ass about being a squeakmeister and being totally incompetent and left on the Panther game.
Yeah, and he said I was in good shape with your new deal.
He what?
He said I was in good shape with you, something in the new deal.
No, yeah.
Yeah, he really knows what's going on.
Not.
Anybody would say you're in good shape.
I mean, just one look at you.
I wouldn't make me just laugh his terrible.
But the terms of what shape you think is good.
The biggest name.
Maybe he likes rounds.
He'd rather be picked to hit.
That was round 150.
Nick Quick.
Big goldstein, goldstein.
Goldstein.
So, how do you play?
The best talent.
It's the T.A. Joe Wingnights Green to 11.
Here on, on Sports Radio 5.
62 A.
The Sports Gear.
America loves to watch boobs and butts and blanking.
It's the all new Leabert to beaver, starring Barbara Billingsley, Hugh Beaumont, Jodie
Down, and Clint Eastwood as the beaver.
Beaver?
Yeah, Mom.
What is it?
There's a package down here.
Fire just came in the mail.
Looks like it's from Bubbles.
Isn't that that girl you know at school?
No, she's a hooker. She's a hookie.
We hookie. She plays hookie from school a lot.
That's where I know her from.
Later, up in the boys' room.
Hey, Wally.
Look, I got a package from Bubbles.
Oh, yeah?
What did she send you?
Oh, geez. She sent me her underwear.
I got a quit hanging around those kind of women.
I suppose I could say I told you so, but, man.
Guess this is no time to be rubbing it in.
Well, as long as Mom and Dad don't find out, I'll just hide them in the drawer here.
Later, that same episode.
Boy, look what I found in Beaver's drawer.
Where did they come from?
Uh-oh, I think I'm in trouble.
Big trouble.
Mom, Dad, those underwear belong to, uh, Tawali.
Wally?
Get talking about.
Yeah, there he is.
He wears them.
Presses around in them like, like, Tinkerbell.
Well, isn't that right?
Big brother.
Yeah.
There you go.
I don't, um, that's okay.
Sorry, I like it a lot.
Well, you like it.
I do.
I got a request for this.
Ty's right there.
So after the break, we'll play that.
I don't like that.
Well, one good thing about today, I said we take a request during the holidays.
And just a few, not, not overbearing.
So let me put my, uh, ACN CD number five over here, over here.
And by the way, I don't, I, I Googled, uh, goldstein spell, I-E-N.
And it came back and said, you mean goldstein, E-I-N?
Uh-oh.
You know that's the thing.
There's no such thing.
Okay.
No such thing is goldstein or goldstein with an I-E-N.
It depends on how the people pronounce it themselves, right?
Right.
So you walk up to somebody and say, hey, G-E-L-D, I have a goldstein or goldstein.
In his case, it's G-E-L-D, G-E-L-D, right?
Right.
Now, you might wonder why I'm eating now.
No.
I'm trying something.
And it's definitely not going to work.
I'm eating two pieces of sliced Swiss cheese and zero carbs.
Mm-hmm.
And I was going to substitute this for the candy bar or bars I would eat on a way to wood buy.
It's not going to work.
No.
Why not?
Because you're a fat lardo that can't control his food intake.
There must have been a nicer way to say that.
What do you think, Tommy?
I would have said it differently off the original.
What do you think, Tommy?
Um, on which part?
How he described it over the...
The un-cheese instead of a un-cheese.
I got to go now.
What?
To get more food?
To get more food.
Yeah.
I have eaten...
I had that bacon, that horrible...
I know.
It was horrible.
It was horrible.
It was horrible.
It was horrible.
I got a bad bash in that box.
You know, one of these days.
Well, since it was you that turned us all on to the flavor waiver oven.
Yeah.
You'll make some bacon in there.
You mean some real bacon?
You get right.
Some real bacon in that thing.
And it'll be like...
Like turning a new corner in your life.
Realism.
Yeah.
Evenly...
Because this bacon was like rubbery from this package.
Whatever was there.
There's two packets in each box.
And both the one yesterday.
Remember I told you it was rubbery.
And the one today was like chewing rubber bands.
Not good.
Nish good.
But this cheese is really good.
But it's not sweet.
So it doesn't satisfy my sweet tooth.
Right.
I'll be dead soon anyway.
So what do I mean to say?
You got more than one sweet tooth.
I got 32 sweet tooth.
You got my own teeth though.
I think 31.
Didn't I have one taken out?
No I had two taken out.
Rubber band man.
All right.
The spinners.
Now do we decide are they in the iroculable hollow finger nod?
They better be.
I'm going to be really peeled.
I love the spinners.
And who doesn't?
Who with any taste?
I know.
Communists.
anarchists.
Communists.
I think that's it.
Thank you.
Rubber band man.
If you don't like this song, we hate you like poison.
Okay.
So if you just.
Cheese the one.
There's a couple more slices in there.
But one thing about Swiss cheese.
It's not the kind of thing that like when you start eating it.
Like ice cream for example.
The more you eat the more you want.
Like sex.
But.
But Swiss cheese.
No.
In fact, no cheese.
No, nobody ever owed these on cheese.
Do they?
No, that's what I know.
The spinners are not.
The spinners are not in the rock and roll hollow fame.
Correct.
Now when we took that pool, the specter is on there.
The damn well better up then.
Wasn't that long ago either?
Was it?
No.
I think they were on our list.
I think they were.
Well, that's what I'm saying.
Let's see.
Which of these people is too black?
What the hell is that?
Kind of a pool is that.
That must have been George during the summertime.
The me kind of a racially insensitive.
The me.
Let's see.
Which a former QA.
I can't find it.
Which decade produced the best.
Oh, it's way down here.
It's way way down 24 72 24 72.
There it is.
Who should be in the rock and roll hollow fame?
And let's see.
Chicago, of course, one hands down your pants.
Remember that pseudo-anlectual A-hole like Eamie's song?
Oh, yeah.
All the earlier stuff.
What difference does it make when hell they recorded it for
Grine Out Loud?
They recorded so much fabulous music.
You didn't like the leader stuff with the Faggy Sound and Peter Satera.
Too bad.
Yeah.
I didn't need to be able to wipe any kids too, by the way, if that proves anything.
I don't see the spinners on here.
The spinners are not on there.
Oh, we owe a big apology, okay, to the whole world.
Sounds like a do-over.
I mean, Ed Solomon is on there and not the spinners.
God, you might as well put Geltie Gelstein on there.
Joe Cocker is on there, Alta Cocker is on there.
The monkeys are on there, but not the spinners.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
The monkeys made some good music.
But could you compare the monkeys with the spinners?
That's like comparing a halivog with Fulafel for Christ's sake.
Fulafel is for Goyam.
What is Fulafel?
I mean, I know what it is, but you tell me.
You tell me, you know, Shawarma?
No.
What's all that Middle Eastern food?
Is that what makes people want to kill everybody?
Don't you know?
I think so.
Markets down 184 to Dow, 186, like I said.
And that's because that bitch is on CNN.
It's made from fried chickpeas.
Curra Phillips.
What is made from fried chickpeas?
Fulafel.
Fulafel?
You ever see a chickpea?
Just this morning?
Spice and fulafines and or chickpeas.
Nice, can'ty.
Now, what does that say?
Oh, we had 1,000 two votes on that pool?
I got confused.
I'm looking at the old one there,
and it says 1,000 two votes.
I thought, boy, we must add a big rush on this one today,
but we didn't.
But we did top 1,000 for the two polls together.
I told you, if you cheat, you win.
I talked to Bill Achuk, he told me that.
If you cheat, you win.
It doesn't work so well lately, but nevertheless.
us. Now who's playing who this weekend?
No, the dolphins have the 49ers who just have to pound in the jets.
And they'd be buffal week before.
Who 49ers? Yep.
So I guess they're going to make the run now.
They're going to beat the dog.
I don't think so.
Isn't that down there?
That's in Miami.
No, 49ers. My ass.
Stay below. Bring back Steve Youngman.
Bring back jolly jo Montana or jolly jo bill.
Then come back here. Play this weekend.
I'll look it up now.
Probably some little girls team.
I hope.
Just barely squeaked by Seattle.
And boy, you talk about little girls blind team.
Death, dumb and blind and hopeless.
And what that was the story with what's his name?
The quarterback, which one there was.
See that he's the one inspired that picture we had on the
a beaded curtain.
The fruit cake playing Oakland at Oakland.
That's a win for you at Oakland.
All right, we beat the Raiders.
Let's just have a forfeit and I came.
Well, look at how the dolphins just had a squeak by the
Raiders, man.
They just squeaked it.
When you're dealing with mediocrity, that's what it is
ramping mediocrity and spread it out one email.
I got the guys trying to rationalize.
Oh, we've got parody.
Yeah, all the teams basically suck.
One to see that.
The best out of you.
Is no rejects.
Forty to five sixty Q. A.M.
Think force lead your best.
Hey
easy.
The
Davis-
I'm wearing her clothes.
Give 42
Magi
It's a tiny little stress
Like spaghetti
It holds me so tight
I can't cause that night
Walk around in winds underwear
A rack
In the office there's a guy named Melvin
He pretends that I am a fever-on
You'll see how you ready, we'll say
Whoa, raise, let's wait until the white is out of town
Later on in the water
We can dress like Madonna
Put on some ice-shade
And join the parade
Walking out it with its underwear
Oh, flakes and dents
Miss 10, did you pass?
Finishing
Wearing our clothes
Still pantyhomes
Walking out in winds underwear
Oh, walking out in winds underwear
You're fair walking around in winds underwear
Alright, that's time of the year to do it
Tonica time, Christmas time, New Year's time
Just walk around in ladies' garments
Alright, fairies, Arthur, what?
I said, alright
14-02 a.k.a.m. the big O is coming back
Rock solid
Punishment of two
Very Macogniz back
He says, I heard you mentioned a beaded curtain earlier
That's a blast from the recent past
And I would say from the distant past
Why did it end up going away?
Very wants to know
Well, because they pass laws, you know
And you have to have all these things documented
About the age of the chick and this and that
And otherwise you can go to jail
And we decided we'd like it better on the outside
And of course that was thanks to a listener
Remember that?
Yep
Who sent me the law, et cetera, and so on
Not thanks to anybody inside the building like our management
Who was totally oblivious
Oh, well the neo-Rodges website's got nothing to do with QA
And we didn't want to think about that
That's what they would say, you do understand that?
Yep
Bastards
Heartless, relentless bastards
What should every man know?
We got 374 votes, how do one do a brow with one hand?
146, and that's it. Everything else, small potatoes
Small potatoes like Frankie Pentangeli
He had a rain in his wash and we most of the snow here
For Castanoma, I'm sure he's going to want to be given the Toronto weather tomorrow
On his marginally listened to show
Hey, Polly, you still suck
And you still rip off artists, but nevertheless
I was talking to Polly last night at the Eaton Center
Yeah, what we eat, you know, I still, seriously, I still haven't gotten over to Johnny F and Rockets
You will, for sure
It's not far away
It's not that far
I could make a little bit of a journey over there, over there, and you know
And get some of those great, what are they?
Ruben sandwiches, like about ten of them
Who?
No, not Ruben sandwich, what is it?
Patti Meltz
Patti Meltz
You see it so rarely on a menu anywhere anymore, I can't even remember what that was called, Patti Melt
Ever see Patti Meltz?
Just this morning
Some same-sex married supporters are urging people to call in gay tomorrow
Well, that's a good idea, I'm calling in gay tomorrow
To show how much the country relies on gays and lesbians
But others are going to encourage skipping work in the nation's economic distress
Distress, and that dress
Organizers of day without a gay scheduled to coincide with international human rights day
And modeled after similar work stopages by Latino immigrants
Also are encouraging people to perform volunteer work and refrain from spending money
Huh, refrain from spending money, they don't know my life
Sean Hetherington, a West Hollywood comedian and personal trainer
Dreamed up the idea with his boyfriend, Aaron Hartzler
After reading online that a few angry gay rights activists were calling for a day long strike
To protest California voters passage last month of Proposition 8
Which reversed this year's state Supreme Court decision allowing gay marriage
The couple thought it would be more effective and less divisive
If people were asked to perform a community service instead of staying home with their wallet shut
Dozens of non-profit agencies from the National Women's Law Center
Washington, the Methodist Church in Fresno, collecting food for the homeless
Have posted opportunities for volunteers on the couple's website
I'm going to volunteer my performance here, although I'm not working for free though
Screw that, Joe Bell, and screw you too
Or you can take the whole week, you know, last week of the year
Oh, college and calling gay
I'm calling in gay that week
We're all for a boycott if this is what brings about a sense of community for people
Said Hetherington 30, who plans to spend a more volunteering at an inner city school
You can take away from the economy and give back in other ways
Hetherington says he's been getting 100 emails an hour from people looking for volunteer opportunities
And his day without a gay website has gotten 100,000 hits since mid-November
Well, what's the big deal about that? 100,000 hits?
I don't know
A month?
You want to tell me what the big deal is?
No, I don't know what that means
What do you mean what that means?
The significance of that doesn't sound very exciting
No, well, I guess they assume that's a lot
Take a look at our website and the hits we get
And we don't even have anybody listening anymore, we still get a zillion hits
And can you imagine if we still had the beating curtain on it?
I was thinking about that when I read that email from Barry Macockner
And back in the day, it increased the traffic on there dramatically the beating curtains
You know, we used to get a zillion hits and a zillion requests for that page
But in terms of what it did for the rest of the website, it was nonexistent, did nothing
In other words, they looked at the naked picture of the chick
And that was it, and they passed it on to everybody else
And they would do this thing that I only understand marginally
Where they would like link to it from their website
Which would slow us down ultimately, Eric said
Really?
Yeah
So it was a minus minus
And it's supposed to a plus plus
Maybe you know, if you put one of the stories above every naked picture
So that they would have to read the story, you know, at least scroll past it
It didn't make any difference, it would look at it
Guys who are just on there to navigate naked pictures of whatever
They're not interested in reading news stories or reading about the poll
Okay, depends on what kind of poll you're talking about
And by the way, I finally blocked that one jerk ball
I was sending me the, you know, the shirtless pictures of the Jonas Brothers
I've already seen them all, okay, jerk ball, you fairy
Trying to suck up, like trying to ingratiate
Oh, Neil, here's some naked pictures of those hot guys, yeah, okay
Let me say it again, they all look like they could use a good meal
I'd be glad to take them out for dinner
Yeah, you have a mind
Huh?
What'd you have in mind?
Johnny F and Rockets?
No, no, not part of that
Not Johnny Rockets
Jason, who's incredibly chronic, says really enjoying the show today
I love it when you dig up the old bitch you haven't played forever
Well, that's what I'm doing now till the end of the year
I'm digging it up
Did you ever hit the barcaster Bob steel? No, I used to do them over on the A.M. Darlin Hartford when I was a kid
Well, that's good Jason, but I never heard him
Did you ever hear Bob steel?
No
It was the real Bob steel
That's another one, Johnny dark Bob steel
There were eight million guys here, the same name
Rick Shaw
You know, our Rick Shaw was not the only Rick Shaw
I do know that
And here's the poor idea
What's the stupidest crap that George has endured during his current middle-life crisis?
Ruler Derby, sign language, big boobies, ugly fat chicks, that mori crap
Which I don't even know what that is, M-A-W-R, what is that?
Oh, they're talking ancient stuff that I used to talk about when Josh was on the show, Mori Povitch
We watch Mori Povitch about the paternity shows
Oh my God, the way he's father
I mean, illiterate Jason, you know when young people's music and the Yiddish
I've been in the Yiddish my whole life
Since you met me
Right
And is Chris packing on any more weight after the news of his layoff?
He's been wanting to know, he's writing a book, I guess

How will I buy my Christmas tree
My wallet's empty as a meme

Or attack some small mall else
