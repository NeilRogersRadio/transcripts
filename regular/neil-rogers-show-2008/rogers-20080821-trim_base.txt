My Scott's Ice 14 feet.
He's the best in his living meat.
Hislar's down, he's looking cool, makes chicken to a king of the food.
My Scott's Ice 14 feet.
He's the winner of every heat.
And though there was a risk, he'll never hold even the gold.
He eats nine eggs when he wakes, and the second drop of chips and cakes won big gold.
With his giant lips.
And all his big, pretty days, like a drink's the least on pizza pies.
Where's the joy?
My Scott's Ice 14 feet.
It will go under the bed sheet.
Like a tortizo that shot this guy is on the other side of.
My Scott's Ice 14 feet.
All who raised him one down in the feet.
He's throwing the guy from the least.
The Japanese and the Chinese.
My Scott's Ice 14 feet.
Everyone who raises his feet.
Because when they fired the gun, your wrist is on Michael just one.
He's the best off of the block.
You'll see him on the winning spot.
He might pass you twice.
He's the answer very nice.
When he jumps in with no flash, he's already counting his cash.
He's the big star.
Get ready for any car.
Like a slice of fortune, he'll free more middle-eater plates.
He put on a slice of display, went the other way for USA.
Wow, that's all I can say to that.
And he's getting paid to do those?
Amazing.
It was to show you.
Anyways, 10 out of 2 at 5, 60 WDQ, it's a Thursday, August 21.
Of course, usually on Thursday we have the Neil Deal, but we don't have one.
How's that thing coming with a text message, too, that we're doing?
You heard what I said.
Yeah, I can text just fine on my phone.
And me, too.
It's all like I'm going to get in certain months of work.
It's never going to fly.
I don't think it's ever going to come ever.
I beg your pardon?
I said, well, ill.
Well, this pool, I snuck on there and I heard yesterday.
Eight, it was great.
Ten minutes until the two.
That's eight until two when we noticed it.
Right.
I stuck it under a ten-up.
And then you're giving a sign and it's, well, Neil, put this one on there and I found it.
But this is an oldie.
This was one of those pole-building days.
Sure.
And people called in with the groups that I never heard of.
Oh, but there's no big river band.
What did you know?
You were thinking about it.
I said, wait, you for that.
Lay me down.
Listen, you don't know from big river band.
You don't know from big river band.
You don't know how the people are here.
I know the little river band.
Yeah.
I can't stand them, by the way.
I'll replace them then.
No, no, thank you.
Please.
A lot of hits.
Guess who died.
I don't know.
Little way.
Jean Upshaw.
Who?
Chris Knows who that is.
Yep.
NFL Players Association Executive Director Jean Upshaw died at the age of 63.
Clear channel online.
Oh my god.
Cheap channel online.
I'll tell you how cheap they are.
They put their executive program, the corporate PD on, to fill in for footsie.
Whoever heard us, such cheapness, such incredible radio on the cheap.
And of course they were learning fast here.
Thanks to Jolly Jobelle.
That's his claim to fame.
Everything on the cheap.
Cutbacks, cutbacks, cutbacks.
Cut everybody's pay, cut people with those positions out of the, just crap.
Because he sure is how many doing it with the programming or with ratings.
And of course the fact that that's back on.
And I heard you sucking his ass actually, brother.
I told you we always got a lot.
And I love you.
They're out of here.
Oh my god.
What?
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Say, say whatever I say.
Say, brought him back and put him on the ears is scandalous.
We've always gotten along and I don't listen to any of these shows.
It's what your business and personal.
What's the difference?
Clear channel online.
Signing anonymous sources reports upshard that have pancreatic cancer.
NFL Network's Adam Schefter speaking on serious XMZ NFL Radio confirmed the report.
Upshard was a seven time probo selection, 11 time all pro.
It was inducted to the pro probo hall of Famine 87.
Gene Upshard's dead.
Well, it's going around.
And how about that congresswoman from, uh, Boryshe from Georgia?
Who?
She had an aneurysm in the car and she was wobbling all over the road and then she died.
Here's the Georgia's pull from yesterday, which, uh, I gave her this.
Yeah, why don't you write it down?
I put the one on for the weekend and then changed it so there were two polls in between shows.
Why?
The one that was on over the weekend was, uh, let's change it anyway.
Whatever.
What is it?
What is it?
Yeah.
I forgot what it was.
What is it?
It's an injection to another show.
Oh, that would be a QM ever again.
I forgot.
It's your pull.
Yeah.
You did it.
Seven-event-ninety-six votes.
Five hundred twenty-five of them said, who's Jason Jackson?
Sixty-six percent.
Two turds.
Which should have put the jacks in there.
By that.
No, he will not do another show on QM-206 ES-65.
I guess we'll find out at two today.
Now, let's see.
What does it say for tomorrow?
Oh, tomorrow, two to fourth to V-A show.
This is just...it's just...
Kaka is what it is.
It's just, uh, like somebody picked up a whole bunch of crap and they threw it up in the air.
Wherever it fell down, that's where it was going to be in place.
In Rumsan?
Mm-hmm.
Just pick up a bunch of crap, heave it up in the air,
and let it fall, hit the ground, and where it hits the ground, that's going to be the schedule.
This is a business.
This is a freaking business.
Good, God.
You call this big market radio?
I sure is, hold on.
I call this a disaster.
Joe and Clarence.
But this is, you know, this is their idea.
They got nobody to put on, so this is what they do.
They keep shuffling with that.
Like shuffling, remember how well that works with the light bulb?
Remember the PD Bulger and the TV?
I made the comparison.
Yeah.
Light bulb, Jr. baby.
Now the pull I got going for today, which is an oldie, oldie moldy.
But it's going to take hours to read it.
Should I read all the names?
Oh, yeah.
Get out of here.
See?
Get out of here, Meg.
On Rachel Madd, I was getting her own show on MSNBC, which shows there is no God.
What a obnoxious dike.
She's out, by the way, so it's not speculation.
647 votes already on this pull, which I put on their 10 minutes till two yesterday.
And I contrary to what you said about my caring about, what do I care how many votes we get on the pull?
What does it do?
You do the little bit of acts like they care?
I act.
Oh, oh, I see.
I'm sorry.
I'll play along.
You can't just come on the air and just be totally indifferent to everything like you are.
Oh, nothing different.
Everything.
Whatever does I don't care.
Whatever does.
Well, I'm trying to be more like the people down here and management.
The greatest rock, well, that's true.
The greatest rock performer of all time or group is R.
Beetle 79, stone 65.
Now the first time we did this years ago, stones edgeed out the beetles by 16 votes.
And Ceeley Cruz was third.
For the chicken brought the house.
She got 100 votes back then.
What a joke.
Ceeley Cruz, my ass.
Beetle 79, stone 65, Elvis 37, Led Zeppelin 33, Pink Floyd 28, the who 25, Jimmy Hendrix 21, Queen 17, Kiss 16,
U214, Frank Zappa 14, I'm only going to read the ones with double digits.
Rush 13, Erosmith 13, Grateful Dead 12, Eagles 12, Bruce Springsteen 12, Ceeley Cruz 12,
Doors 11 and Michael Jackson 10.
Those are the ones with double digits.
There's 80 million names on here.
And it does say the Big River Band.
We apologize for that.
There is no Big River Band.
You're right about that.
But what does it say?
The Little River Band, but Erich hasn't changed yet.
Maybe he will.
Maybe he doesn't water.
What?
Maybe he doesn't water.
Yeah, that's since fine, whatever.
I think the greatest news in the history of mankind is the fact that Jew Lieberman may be John McCain's roommate.
It's a Charlie Lindford's quiz.
Yeah, I thought that was going to be a real winner, but oh, Jew Lieberman.
And man, he knew even a man.
He looked like Differ Al Gore, he knew the same thing from McCain.
Why, Ne, Orthodox, Jew, Israel, Firster, Neocon, Licker.
And he's going to speak at the Republican Convention to Lieberman.
Now, the Democrats ought to be coming out and just screeching.
And of course, well, you know, he's the swing vote.
If there's a tie, he's the swing vote, the Senate.
So, blah, blah, blah.
Yeah, so they continue looking.
Right, I'm going to utilize it.
Oh, my God, Jew Lieberman, I told you.
He is one of the most anxious sub-humans on the face of the globe.
Now, let's see how these calls are going to be today.
Deputy QA& Hello.
Yes, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Did you ever see Sveta Cruz Live?
Did I ever see you see you?
Thank you.
Live.
Thank you.
Thank you, what?
Thank you, because you never start live.
You never start in concerts.
So, what do you know?
Yeah, but I know, right?
You don't know nothing.
Have you ever seen Luis Miguel Live?
No.
I did three times.
I got news for it.
He was a thousand times entertainer.
That bitch would ever be.
He never thought her life.
He never crossed my ass.
Never saw her life.
She never was alive.
She was then at birth.
Good God.
Did I ever see Sveta Cruz Live?
You know something?
Some of you people are like so, so boxed into crap.
Break out of the box.
Break out of the shell.
Get a brain.
Oh, you can't pick on Sveta Cruz and saw Florida Neil.
That's just a blasphemy.
Yeah, right.
In addition to what she's on the pole.
If I didn't put her on her, that would be like,
Go vote for her a hundred times.
Vote for Sveta a hundred times.
Make you feel happy, okay?
She was the greatest performer.
Next to Desi Arne, as I would say.
Hey, no.
Yeah.
Start knocking Desi, are you?
No, I'm just saying.
Right.
She was great because she was Cuban.
Is she a great entertainer?
Can El Castro, he's Cuban.
Yep.
Can he say?
I don't know.
He was just turned 82, by the way.
He's still alive, damn it.
Did you ever see her?
So what do you know?
I never saw most of these groups in concert live.
Did you?
How could you?
There's like 6,000 groups on this pole right.
And so are individuals.
You know?
If you go to the left, there's a line.
Hello.
Hello, Leo.
Yes, sir.
Look at you.
How can you say that about Asuka?
Please.
And then you have George Cubano.
Next to you, I don't say anything.
Oh, right.
Nice fake, that's got him.
Yeah.
Go back and work on it some more.
In the accent too, schmuck.
W-Q-A-N-HELLO.
Q-A-N-HELLO.
On your face.
Notice how quick that finger is today.
Sir, really quick.
I got to sharpen it up in a pencil sharpener.
I have the biggest name.
The best talent.
You're the hero of this sport.
You'll find 50 Q-A-N-B.
The sports leader.
You're a bastard.
Tonight I'm by your feet with Mr. Manez.
Hello, I'm Harry Smith.
It's a night of the day, it's a night of the day.
Join us tonight as we delve into the life of Cuban icon Silia Cruz.
Born in Oyster Bay, Long Island, Cecil Cragman was a gifted child in more ways than what.
Little did he know what one it would be.
The early days of his career were involved in performing stand-up comedy and drag.
So I tell them, if you want flowers, go bang a florist.
Is it me, a kiss and food, or my big red sparkles, food?
World War of Keith.
Cecil signed up as a merchant marine and was sent to Cuba,
where he re-tooled his nightclub act,
and he came to well and out of Superman that was featured in the film.
Not father too.
Little did he know, Castral would rise to power, forcing him to change his act once again.
Well, common Miranda died right around that time, and there was a voice to be filmed.
So I happened to be hung like Uncle Melty, and I decided to slip on a dress and start singing.
You know, Cecil changed his name to Silia Cruz,
and became enormously successful as a drag queen salsa singer.
Riga, talk to each other, but body can't drag, I can't say, look like her,
just talk to him with a dance.
Rube business dealings earned Silia his fortune,
but the hit song he had after the record label offered him 85 cents per record in royalties.
On a sad note, Cecilia died.
I'm 18 at 5.60 W.Q.A. I'm speaking to Luis Miguel.
How come he's not on here?
Everybody else who ever had a record, whoever sang a song, even in the shower,
is on here.
You're bad writing it right now.
Get him on here.
What do you mean my bad?
Yeah, well you're the one that's his fan.
I wouldn't have thought to put Luis Miguel on there. That's your job.
Just because you put Silia Cruz in that Luis on there.
I have to agree with him.
What?
I have to agree with George.
And what is that?
You don't want to like Luis Miguel.
Ever.
I'm the only person that likes Luis Miguel.
Oh, you're the only person in this room.
Oh, in that room.
I'll screw both of you.
Oh, listen, all of a sudden Chris is jumping on the CD Cruz bandwagon.
You have to see that this band.
He's got a team on, I told you.
Oh, yeah, you should see.
Oh, my God.
He's got all her records.
I'll be out there.
I have them on an A-track.
What a pile of manure.
Oh, God.
That's what he said.
Silia Cruz my ass.
5670560, pound 560 on the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.
WDQYM, hello.
Yeah, how are you?
Okay.
Not only was she an icon down here.
She was a beautiful looking woman.
Yeah.
No, she was.
When was that about 100 years ago?
Oh, come on.
You know she was a beautiful woman.
So what does that have to do with being a great performer?
She was.
I mean, look at the crowds of people she drew with her.
Yeah.
I mean, you know, there's a lot of people going out there that's not success in crowds of people like she did.
And it's just one of them that people didn't follow her.
So they're the great, so they're the grateful dead.
They're not on the list, by the way.
A lot of Jews followed her too.
A lot of what?
Jewish people followed the CD Cruz.
A lot of Jews followed CD Cruz.
That's what they were called.
CD Cruz, right.
Get some help, sir.
Well, it's a surprise he got that out with a straight face.
Yeah, get some help.
Well, he ran.
He ran and hid.
He ran with the bed.
That said, no calls on the board, man.
It's going to be a really grim Thursday, I guess, huh?
Right.
Well, that's because I had the audacity to, uh, I mean, say anything negative about her.
All I said was that she had 100 votes on the first poll.
Okay.
And you said that there was all the freepers, the, uh, clowns.
Yeah, that was the joke vote dessert.
That was the joke vote.
And these calls must be the joke or co-yes.
She was very popular among the Jews in your cruise.
Oh, my God.
And you're not going to Luis Miguel.
Have you ever seen him in concert?
I have three times.
How do you know that?
So what do you know about it?
Like that first call?
I said, whatever.
What do you mean?
What do you mean not for you?
Not for me.
Why?
Because he was used to be pretty?
Is that it?
No, because he's a world-jacked.
No, it's because he's Mexican-atagon.
Yeah, that's right.
That's what it was.
That's the reason Luis Miguel doesn't get the recognition in this community that he deserves
because he's Mexican.
He's Tex-Mex.
He's Tex-Sicken.
W-D-Q-Y-M-HELLO.
I'm going to go.
Q-Y-M-HELLO.
Any other one?
Okay.
Yeah, you know, if he, YouTube, send a cruise back in the day.
What I'd do like about her is the fact that she was like pretty raw and like she, unlike
Gloria Stefan, is completely watered down.
She was pretty balls out, you know.
Let me ask you what.
I mean, to be comparing anybody to Gloria Stefan, I mean, is that?
Because of Cuban, is what I'm trying to say, you know?
Cuban's Latin music.
Gloria's like watered down, you know.
Gloria's crap.
It totally crap.
I mean, it's either what hot mess, you know?
That's her, that's pretty raw.
She's sort of like, you know, obviously I don't want to compare to Janice Chopin, but something
aligned that...
Oh, listen, she really, like, raw.
She really wants to be a very pop-sealed cruise, yeah?
Yeah.
All right.
Well, those are my two.
They're having a commoner both then.
Wow.
We really, we have really stoked the Ecos.
We've really opened up the Pandora's Box.
Celia, cruise my ass.
Oh, she was raw.
She was a...
Balls on, she was...
I bet you had him.
My mother would torture me with her.
Really?
Yeah.
If she came on the TV, my mother would force me to watch.
You'd put the music on and force me to listen and insist that I like it.
She's one of the many, many things that were wrong with my mother.
Hey, your mom ain't no senior cruise.
You'd be a family wealthy if she would have been straight.
No, I didn't.
You am.
I'm...
WDQA and hello.
Hey, Neil, how are you?
Okay.
Well, I know we got TV ghostings back.
Where are we going to get...
What are we going to get to take with Mother Chant?
No.
Hey, he was your sidekick when you took 25 plays.
Yeah, no kidding.
Why don't you tell me who my mother was, too?
More on.
Yeah, he was the farder.
Anglewood, New Jersey police, at a man called 911 reported a robbery after a gas station
wouldn't give him his money back for an unopened box of condoms.
Police charged Katie and Jackson with making a false report.
Police say they take things like this seriously because of the danger of poses to officers.
They responded quickly to the call on Sunday.
Found a gas station employee who fit the description of the robber given by the caller.
Police say Jackson told them he made the bogus report to help him get his money back.
They 21 year old is from Blowville, New York.
Wherever that is.
Blowville.
Blowville?
Yeah, blow, blow, blowville.
As in Cedar Crews blows.
WDQIM, hello.
QIM, hello.
Hey.
Yeah.
Did you know that we began it actually for the week, it's for the weekend of Mexican.
Yeah.
In Georgia's life, it's only a loud stinger.
That's all he is.
Oh yeah.
Uh-huh.
Let me ask you this.
Who sold more records?
Will we see Cedar Crews?
It doesn't matter.
He says the pretty face.
We know ice cream outsells all the flavors to him.
Let me ask you.
You ever see him in concerts, sir?
Yes, I have.
I haven't seen Cedar you gave me about five years, ten years ago.
Yeah.
Well, guess what?
Vend over in the stick it in the slot.
Stick it in the quarter slot.
WDQIM, hello.
A lounge act.
Oh my god.
You just, like, breaks a notch road like all these.
Everybody in Georgia's just, no.
No, if you're just a professional singer, you stand up there and sing like Frank Sinatra, that's a lounge act.
Frank Sinatra, and believe me, I couldn't stand him for a second.
He was a lounge act.
The way a lounge act is.
No, a lounge act is somebody like who isn't doing it.
You'd be a very successful lounge act, but still.
Ha ha ha ha.
Still.
You're so full of crap.
It's just, uh-huh.
That's right.
All of them are just hard to ask.
Just as a whole life is just as a heart act.
They're just singing.
They're just singing.
Other people's songs.
So what's wrong with that?
Nothing.
I didn't say that was anything wrong with you.
I didn't think it was anything wrong with you.
But if you're going back to Georgia's old, old song.
That's my thing.
If you didn't write your own music then you're not a musician.
The part isn't who's the best musician of all time.
Who's the greatest performer?
Me to the argument.
Not who's the greatest performer.
Not for me.
That's my point.
Not for me.
How many songs do you have?
You can have the stones right.
You can have them.
All of them.
They did?
Yeah.
Their own?
Absolutely.
What?
Yes.
Oh.
How did Jimmy Hendrix?
What did he write?
His.
His songs.
His.
He wrote his songs.
Bob Dylan wrote all along the war.
Erasmus.
Yeah.
They wrote their own songs.
Those are their songs.
Oh, they're grateful that it is on here.
They got a dozen votes.
Would you say it goes to show it?
We put them on twice.
We didn't put them on twice.
Why?
You just put them on again?
They're on there.
No, no, no.
They might have gotten those 12 votes since we put it on.
Well, we're checking.
And by the way, are you out of here?
Are you kidding?
Get out of here, Meg.
Same old, tired arguments, man.
Get some new arguments.
Yeah.
Come up with something new.
Right back at you.
They don't write their own music.
They're not a musician.
You keep bringing these other points into it.
I just said not for me.
I don't like low jazz.
Oh, you don't have a least good guy in there.
I don't like seeing a cruise either.
No, I don't.
Do you like?
No, I don't.
You don't like the top six.
You don't like Carmen Miranda?
No.
Although, I liked at least one of her songs.
It was already on the pool.
So if you read it in the second time,
shame on you.
Shame on you.
You know, I like as many Carmen Randa songs as I like
it to excellence, cruise songs.
One.
And what was that?
A koop
And the turrets, and that means the comfort these are still as you'll need to burn it.
Deregulation, dreaming again, dark hearted speculation, I've really gone insane.
It's no crime, strike a price for all its items they like it.
And the trumpet chants it breaks again, that's how the cow just hikes.
Deregulation, dreaming again, dark hearted speculation, I've really gone insane.
Now let me tell you about the vacillating best of all, having waited too much fun.
Out of control and run to hold, that makes your honor risky hedge fund.
When you got close, a board of the low, don't get too excited.
Uh-huh, too powerful to move back up, they go no matter you still gotta buy it.
Deregulation, black, amateurs, dark hearted speculation, I've really gone insane.
And hyperinflation, corporate race, and without infundation, nobody can play.
Yeah, 1033 at 560 W.Q.M. who I've printed on all these pages, all I wanna do is print out one page or shoot it on that selection.
Like I always tell you, that's the way it works.
All these stats about Luis McGill in all the records that he sold, 80 trillion, and vanilla ice cream outsells every other flavor of somebody that they get.
Well, there you go, vanilla ice cream.
In 1992 he established a world record by selling 10,000 tickets for a concert in the National Audit Framework Pro City in three hours,
with an average sale of 52 tickets per minute.
There's that many fat chicks out there?
He was the first Latin artist to perform a sold out concert in Madison Square Garden in New York, 1993.
First Latin artist to perform seven consecutive sold out concerts, and the circus maximum theater at Caesars in 1993.
That must be when I see them.
And anyway, it goes on.
I mean, to compare Luis McGill with Celia Cruz, almost 100 million copies worldwide, 5 Grammy Awards,
4 Latin Grammy Awards, Top Premier alone, The Waystrow Awards, 4 World Music Awards, 13 Billboard Awards.
Wow.
What's the minute? Either one of their concerts?
What?
Luis or Celia. You would never have seen me at either one of their concerts.
Well, why not?
I'm going to a Frank Sinatra concert before I do go out and see either one of those two.
Yeah. I'm going to my Geldie concert.
Yeah, I'm going to Elvis concert before I go to see one of those.
No, you're wrong.
The Fatalist.
The Smalsy Niels, you were Smalsy.
Yeah, okay.
WDQYM, hello.
Hello.
Hello.
QYM, hello.
My birthday.
WDQYM, hello.
It's his death day.
Yeah. We're waiting for that. QYM.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
How are you today? Welcome back.
What do you mean welcome back?
Well, you know, I can't lose it every day.
Yeah, I see.
But I know that George did a wonderful job of always when you were away.
Yeah.
I know you know that.
But I just wanted to give you my little take on Celia Cruz and what's his name?
Frank Sinatra.
That's right.
I think.
I think you're the senior Kugat.
I see.
And that's right.
And Xavier Kugat was one of the best.
But the thing with Celia is that Celia is for Cuban people.
She is like the goddess.
You know, she took our Cuban music and put it all over the world.
She was kind.
And she wasn't, you know, stuck out for anything like that.
I remember seeing her in the airport.
And people would not take money.
You know, the baggage handlers.
They would not take money.
The people wanted to buy her coffee.
They wanted to buy her a sandwich.
Celia, we love you.
It looks to me like she didn't need extra sandwiches.
I'm working the airport.
I've never seen anybody.
They should have bought the sandwich for Karen Carpenter.
Not for a senior.
You don't even know what I mean.
You know, so you can't compare apples and pears.
Now, these are the guys.
He's good looking.
You know, he's got all the courage behind the world.
But you just can't compare.
I've got his like Celia Cruz to this guy.
To Luis McGell.
He's career.
He's career is in the tech now.
Where is he?
How about her career?
How she doing?
He's so bad.
He's dead now.
And you know that.
You're so bad.
You're like a bad kid.
You know, you want to tear it up.
But that's not the thing.
Okay.
So you can't compare one.
They were both wonderful.
But Celia is something special.
He's in a different planet.
She was something, all right.
I can't see it on you.
Okay.
Have a great day.
Okay.
We love you.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
We love you when we hate you because you're a take on Celia Cruz.
We don't like your take on Celia Cruz.
He loves you anyway.
Who?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, thank God for her.
56670560.
56670560 on the right.
I mean, see, you turn everybody against Luis McGell.
I actually had you in Tampa when we were on WSU when I had people in Tampa
buying Luis McGell right here.
You're giving me way too much credit.
If only I had that much influence.
What?
But that's what you try to do.
No, no, no, no.
Try to turn the whole audience against poor Luis McGell.
Hey, what do you mean we got fans?
Women and fags.
Yeah.
Well, I got, how about old fat fags?
Well, they're there.
No wonder you like him talking about you.
That's Charlie Chris.
Yeah.
Oh, the first part.
I imagine he likes Luis McGell.
He's probably got the posters.
Probably got naked in the posters.
Yeah.
Low up doll.
Let's hear about Charlie Chris, Triptomecanos with Mark Foley.
Oh, I'm having trouble finding my favorite carbon red song.
I just want you to know.
Good.
Thank God for that.
With that fruit salad on our head.
You think it's it?
Somebody to be with you.
Hello.
Hi, Drown.

What the hell was that?
Hey, my phone keeps doing that too.
That's bizarre.
That was strange.
You got T-Mobile?
Hey?
No.
Hey, see, see.

You touch a nerve every time you speak to somebody.
It just says, they're like, oh, no, she's great.
No, no, no, no.
No.
Thank you.
She was okay.
If you like her, that's fine.
If you don't, that's fine.
Okay.
Exactly.
Take it or leave it.

She's, she's, she's reminded me of a, of a, of a major and a woman's prison.
But you mentioned earlier about Xavier, a true God.
He just, he just mentioned his name.
And it reminded me.
You notice how he just fell off the, the city there.
You know, you never hear of him anymore.
He's been dead for probably 25, 30 years.
Well, he's been dead a long time, true.
Right.
He, he did a, so, nice mustache though.
We had a hell of a nice mustache.
Well, every did with that.
But anyway, he did a strong on, uh, uh, uh, it was an instrumental with his band, uh, back in the, uh, I guess late 60s, early 70s, something like that.
And it was called WAPA-GAPA.
Okay.
Oh.
And it was a WAPA job that he, WAPA?
WAPA.
As a WAPA?

As a WAPA, that's the person out.

We'll get that one.
This is a project.
4.5.60 QAM.
The fourth leader.
I, Luis Miguel, play it, baby.
I wanna live with you, Luis Miguel.
Why could the half be the rest of my life if you Luis Miguel?
If I met up to Luis Miguel, you'd be hitting high notes that you didn't know how to, while Luis Miguel.
You're fair.
I know I'll never get you.
I just can't forget you.
I still got my dreams and now.
My only word for you is wow.
Wow.
Holy cow.
I wanna live with you, Luis Miguel.
I could be happy the rest of my life with you Luis Miguel.
Thank you, Luis.
I can't comprehend anything that you say, but who needs to talk?
It gets in the way of sex Luis Miguel.
I know I'll never get you.
I just can't forget you.
I still got my dreams and now.
My only word for you is wow.
Wow.
Holy cow.
So who is LK?
Who did that?
Luis Cobalt.
Who's that?
A guy that contributed some things to us for a while there.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, I must have been a long time ago.
Sure was.
And you still remember that name?
Did I ever meet this guy?
Nope.
Neither did I.
Oh.
Well, thanks Luis.
I don't know who knows if he's still out there.
Who knows if he's still alive?
Luis Miguel is still alive and of course George ain't too happy about that.
Oh, I don't care.
He's just another lounges.
He's just another lounges.
That's right.
Lounge, that's all.
Anybody that George doesn't like his assistant lines like that?
No, that's not true.
Anybody that George doesn't like is a spectacular, no-
No, we're getting a musician.
No, I've never said that.
Yeah, you're lying.
I know it.
I know it.
No.
Good, just part of your own business.
Here's a look at the schedule.
The jerk show from 2 to 4 this afternoon.
God only knows who the host is going to be on the jerk show.
You see the tip off on him.
And, Geltie, you're such a freaking liar, Geltie.
You're such a weasel.
Oh.
Telling you, oh, you see sick.
And you see, yeah, just like most hair pieces sick.
You little butt-sucking weasel.
Geltie's on 4 to 7 this afternoon, so he ain't going to be doing the jerk show.
Maybe Curtis will be back again.
Or maybe it'll be Jerks.
7 to 9, it's Hurricane Hotline.
And then 9 to 10, it's dolphins.
Tonight, high school, gridiron reports.
So do you have a favorite Xavier Cooke-Otton?
And then 10 to midnight, it's the D.A. show.
Abby Lane was his wife and the she used to sing with the band.
Abby Lane and Xavier Cooke-Otton.
He died in the 18th of the band.
Oh, I think I know that song.
What?
The peanut vendor.
I think I know that one.
Well, how does it go?
I don't know. I'll let you know.
If it's Cooke-Otton.
I'll try you.
I'll try you.
This sacrilege of roof and lewisio here.
You're just doing that to aggravate me.
No, not.
Of course you are.
No.
Is this the least we've ever done?
No.
Was it not?
No.
Oh, then why would I play it?
Ah, I don't know.
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
I got sacrilege.
Q-A-M, hello.
This is a radio show, sir.
Oh, Joe, get lost.

Cutting the audience, cutting the ratings, cutting people's careers, cutting people's salaries, cutting into people's lives, cutting cheese.
That's where cutting the cheese.
Can you imagine, jolly joe Bell, with that fat ass of his cutting the cheese?
I could smell it all the way up here.
And it's not a pretty picture either.
God.
WDQAM, hello.
QAM.
Now there was one of the better ones this week.
Right.
WDQAM, hello.
We are coming to my party.
WDQAM, hello.
QAM.
I just wanted to tell you, like, how excited I was passing by this week.
The week with Gell is going to be, I think, it's a hard rock on 11708.
Well, 11?
Yeah, I'm listening.
November 7th.
Two days after my birthday.
I'll tell you the temptation to be on your poll for greatest performance.
They're awesome.
Okay, thanks.
How come they're not on the invitation?
I don't know.
Whoever made this list was a...
We don't have any Motown people on their list.
We're taking the Slown Jack.
No, they're not.
You know what a Wild Jack is.
Don't pretend you don't.
Oh my God.
Here's the fact number, by the way, from this Creek Murrio.
305.
What?
I'll say, are the temptations considered rock?
Ah!
I like that.
That's good.
Can I ask you a question?
Are you really as stupid as you come across on your list?
Hey, just for a...
You know what I'm saying about that?
Is this like a cruise is on here for Christ's sake?
Yeah, see the cruise is on there and are the temptations rock.
No, a senior cruise is hard rock.
Well, rock's the hopper out, so.
Marios' fact number is 305-883-8538.
Back in 1977 when you came out of the closet, guess what?
It was December of 1976, so get it right, Marios.
And the world that you were homosexual, I supported you all I asked for,
is you to be here for me.
Oh, look at that.
Look at that.
Did you read the rest of this?
Yes, I did.
Or else, with a sculler, so what the throw?
I thought it was like a...
I was like a threat to my infirmary.
Are you threatening me?
Yeah.
Yes.
First.
305-883-8538, that's the facts number.
And we'll find a phone number eventually too.
I also know the unmentionable one.
Well, what does that tell you?
What does that tell you?
It's not a lie.
It's not a lie.
That's right.
Pathetic.
WDQAM, hello.
Oh, Neil.
Yes.
Hello there.
Yes?
Yes.
I agree to make your acquaintance this afternoon.
Oh, what the crap.
What do you got?
Yeah, well, I wanted to share something with you because they
thought a name they stopped up at the high on pilot people.
But I like to share things with.
And it's about my sexuality.
I've managed to actually change my sexuality.
Yeah.
People say that it's not possible and...
Ready to move all the way around.
Tyler and I get out of here with the fake accent.
56670560, 0560 on the Verizon Singular wireless line.
These are set up calls you've arranged for today, right?
Yeah, that's right.
Now, this is a set up facts.
Now, let's talk about business, sir, or else.
Let us call in crossbow and from...

WDQAM, hello.
Yeah.
QAM, hello.
And finally WDQAM, hello.
I'm doing the job.
Man, we're having been the whole week.
I miss you, bro.
Yeah.
So what's up, man?
I think George is setting you up, bro.
Tuesday and Thursday, sir.
Another three weeks.
Tuesday and Thursday.
But he's just setting you up.
Setting you up for what?
I don't know.
So you get mad and do another day and take one day a week only.
Mm-hmm.
Get the set up.
Mm-hmm.
Uh?
Get the proper proper job.
WDQAM, hello.
Hello.
I'd like to speak to Neil.
Speaking.
Hi, Neil.
How are you?
I'm okay.
Neil, I was calling to ask you.
Have you ever been to a Luis Neil concert before?
Yes, three of them.
I was just going to tell you, isn't he more beautiful in person than even in the picture?
Well, he's not anymore.
He's not.
He's got a fat ass.
I know.
He's going to look in a little funny.
A little chunky.
Yeah, chunky.
Yeah.
Well, I want to tell you a little something I heard about with Miguel.
I heard when he comes to Miami, he stays at the fourth season.
And that he's really a weirdo.
Like, he won't even take the elevators for the celebrities.
He wants to be in the private service elevators.
I hear he likes to close the window.
He's really weird.
But I just wanted to call in and say hello.
What does that have to do with his music?
Oh, no, I know.
I know.
Forget it.
I think he's the synatra.
The synatra of his generation.
He's the synatra of Mexico.
Yeah.
But I just wanted to call in and say hello for my two cents in.
I love your show and take care.
Okay, I asked the cameo to eat us.
Okay, I'll see you this.
Okay, bye.
How we doing on the pool?
Who's winning?

Jimmy Hendrix 24.
Queen 21.

And I can smell it here.
Guys, let's stand up here.
This is the new Rogers.
Forty-two.
The five sixty-c.a.m.
The fourth leader.
This is the new Roger Show.
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you

Start an emergence of what could be the genesis of a new Miami Daphne's team.
This season they may even win two games, or do your 50-yard line season tickets now, or $1
with the purchase of a season parking pass for $5,000.
The no dolphins.
Yes.
Oh, won't you help?
Please.
Okay, not.
It's 11.01.05.60WDQM.
So what's the word?
Are we getting a word from programming about who's going to be doing two to four?
Not yet.
Something we need to look forward to.
But we have our promotions going right now, so.
Oh, they're in a promotion.
Well, excuse me.
Excuse me.
How are we doing on your pull, Chris?
739.
You're going to make 1,000 today.
How do you like that?
All right.
Let's return to the original size of the chains of pulling about 10-15 minutes.
I just made it.
5-6-7.
We don't have anything going on at the phone, man.
Nothing today.
How would the calls you asked today?
I don't remember.
Chris.
The ones that actually got on the air were, yeah, they're okay.
Nothing spectacular.
A couple good ones and a lot of bad ones.
Okay.
Well, what is it called on the air?
What does that mean?
I make a bet to the four.
Yeah.
I know that.
I understand that.
I'm not doing that.
I'm not doing the George Show.
I'm not screening callers.
And I'm certainly not doing that old.
Oh, let's go to Larry and Sunrise.
Let's go to Susie and Margate.
I'm not doing that.
I don't do names or cities or nothing.
Thank God.
Hang up on those fours.
Hang up on the lower floor.
Yeah.
You want?
Those four, you know, the four stalkers.
You heard of the four seasons.
Mm-hmm.
Well, you know, it's really easy to do a fax trace.
Yeah.
And they get the phone number and the address and the last name and all of that.
I'm saving that last, uh, missive that you sent me.
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
Reforge your email on that subject.
I need your old N-E-O.
Q-A-M, hello.
Yeah, N-E-O.
It's, uh, love to know, man.
Question in the comment.
Um, Brady Quinn and Michael Phelps do they get together and N-E-O.
I want to know what the two are saying.
Well, what does that mean?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
Two good looks.
I don't know.
Michael Phelps isn't a good looking guy.
Well, he got a baby.
I don't know.
I can't tell if Phelps looks like they're the spaceship just landed.
Well, I don't know.
I kind of figured those two might hook up down the road and the comment would.
Based on what?
I don't know.
They're, they're, they're, they're going out.
They're going out.
They're going out.
Fantasy, yeah.
Work out.
Work this side.
And what was they as second part?
The comment was me.
I want to know what the Turk is paying you to set up my father.
You can say that one to last later if you want, like when you're bored.
Yeah.
All right, all right.
Hey guys, take care.
Wow.
Holy moly rat man.
Because I got a lot of downtime this afternoon.
I met one at Good Line.
I'm going to put that in my pocket.
Yeah.
Put in your pocket and stick it in the socket.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60 and pound 5, 60.
Yeah, like I told you, I've got a whole pile of stuff here today, including, this is really
piss you off.
Yeah.
And me, Clinton Faithful, seek to sabotage your bum.
Yeah.
A massive email and internet campaigns underway aimed at derailing the nomination of Barack
Obama and making Hillary Clinton the party standard for her next week of the DNC in Denver,
they will not give it up these Clinton vassages.
They won't stop.
They will not stop.
They won't take for an answer.
And of course that was his mistake by allowing her name to be put in nomination in the first
place.
Wimping out.
When a doubt don't win Foudd, that's to be a lesson to you, Barack.
Don't win Foudd.
But he did.
And of course the thing we're seeing now with the pulling is more and more people are
finding a convenient excuse why they won't vote for a black guy.
WDQA M.
Hello.
QA M.
Hola.
Hi, Daby.
WDQA M.
Hello.
It's just that your reputation is more like a free start.
What is it?
What is it made to choose Caltham and turn to be straight?
Oh, this is the same elusive again with a phony accent.
Your phony accent here, my friend.
Yeah, sure.
Or completely authentic in genuine and pathetic.
Perfectly.
You got to understand over on the side of the screen.
That's what it is now.
You got to understand.
Hey, don't brush your teeth, okay?
There's a first verdict.
5670560.
Pound 560 and leave a rise in singular wireless line.
WDQA M.
QA M.
Yes, sir.
No, no, no, no, no.
I don't know.
Paper today about wanting a wide of governor's not picking any men for the different positions.
Yeah, I mean, a deal why you're not picking men?
I know what position he's picking.
Believe me.
Correct them.
That's the only position he's interested in your governor.
Yeah, Limpwist.
Christ.
So that would be a good toss up.
Either Charlie, Christ or Jew Lieberman.
To blow up in a McCain's face.
I say Lieberman would be the best coach.
I'm praying for that.
I am praying.
I'm rubbing my scissors together.
Wouldn't that be beautiful?
WDQA M.
Hello.
I'm Joe.
QA M.
Hello.
I'm normal.
QA M.
Hello.
QA M.
I'm Neil.
Hi.
How are you?
Okay.
How are you?
Oh, hang on.
There's one who we can ruin your audience.
Talk to Andrew Hockey, but we'll not do that.
Talk to him.
Are you crazy?
Hey.
What do you mean, Mike?
You're a big hockey guy.
Yeah, but the South Florida is not.
That's true.
And they, well, maybe if they're not.
I love harness racing.
I'm not going to talk about Brian Tearsley's and Tim Tetrick and the Dave Follon.
Yeah.
Hey, listen.
I think they'll ever come over to think they'll ever be better than 12th place.
You said we could ruin the audience and talk about the Panthers, but you won't.
Now, what was the other, what was the alternative?
Talk about it great for Portrait Lucy.
Oh, yeah.
Huh?
See, I knew it.
You knew you were some of these calls up today.
Oh, yeah.
Cost me a bundle.
Oh, bet.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the Verizon singular wireless line.
I bet you didn't have these calls yesterday.
No, no, you're right about that.
Yeah.
I got to take a lesson.
W to QAM.
Hello.
QAM.
Hello.
QAM.
QAM.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
How come Willie Treino is not on that list?
Who?
Willie Treino.
Willie Treino.
Willie Treino.
Willie Treino.
Who the hell's that?
The guy that does the commercials for, um, he's a Spanish writer.
He's an entertainer.
He does all those smooth lines and stuff.
Willie Treino.
He should be on the list, a little bit on his head.
Yeah, sure.
Likely Story.
Get a life.
No, no, listen to me.
Get a life.
Willie Treino.
Oh, my ass.
Get out of here.
He's related to Harry Treino.
Yeah.
Oh.
Bring the razor.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 in the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.
All of this started with poor Celia Cruz.
They just won't let her lie in peace, you know?
Celia Cruz.
I mean, that tells you everything you need to know about Dave County.
Right there.
Celia Cruz.
Celia Cruz and Ilyana Rosanna Dana.
Put that together and you've got it.
I think that sums it all up pretty well.
WQA Am Hello.

But a boot on it, visitors.
WQA Am Hello.

WQA Am Hello.
Neil, how about putting John Ficotta there on the other?
Oh, yeah.
Sure.
Come on, he's great.
How about Ricky Martin?
We let her off.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, she's not human.
What is she?
GAY.
I'll be sorry to that.
I don't know.
Pair Ricky.
Reacon?
I don't know.
Ricky Martin, Reacon.
And GAY.
A screamer, a flamer.
He kind of like a vanished too real fast, thank God.
Did he kind of fade it from the scene?
Like a queen?
Maybe he and your governor got some...
That guy that called about Michael Phelps and Brady Quinn.
I mean, what is...
What are these people thinking about?
Talk about having too much time on your hands.
Good God.
Well, they're both good looking guys who like to work out.
Well, so naturally...
So, that's all good looking guys who like to work out are probably eight.
Sure.
And going to hook up and do some nasty stuff, starting with the old victim.
No doubt.
WQA Am Hello.
How about Joe Rhodes and the air around the clockers?
That's really big with the Alta Cockers, I'll tell you that.
WQA Am Hello.
Let's go to the...
You know, that would be a good group when Joe and the air around the clockers.
That's right.
And you could...
They could sing while wearing their...
Dockers.
And for all the clockers.
Like the ones...
Yeah, and put on the loop lockers.
And what was that Zach doing again this morning toward the end of the show?
What was that all about?
I'm not sure.
They never tell us when they're going to do things like that.
He is a sandbag in that show.
He's torpedoing it, just like he just like it was most...
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, Tonya.
Never trust a fat producer or a boat opera.
Ever.
The best talent here in the entire day.
The fourth lady of 560 QAM.
And the fourth leader.
The first and two are men on you.
And you can find yourself a little bit more.
Do you use to give away to make a first impression?
That will stay like this.
Just keep the civil prison your hands.
Be free within words of real and not go nuts.
They just have to be everyone to be innocent.
Go away.
There's guaranteed to get attention.
You just smile and say.
It's even housing.
It's the highest battle catchin' by the cross.
Why don't you even leave them all wide open?
Why don't you even open their eyes?
Smile and say.
It's a tight-knit and you make it very clear.
That's it like the two big clubs don't do you.
That's your nice and two big names.
It's a tight-knit.
It's a tight-knit.
It's a tight-knit.
I just spent 20 bucks online to do the report.
Did you send you some information?
You probably read it.

WDQAM.
Hello.
Hey, Mr. Rogers, are you today?
Okay, sir.
I have a question for you.
I need to get your permission to do something.
I bought a new fan phone.
It allowed me to play in P3.
Music on my cell phone and all that.
I miss your cell sometimes.
And I'd like to go in sometimes and just download the attachment that you've got
from the archives.
Save it on my computer and then transfer it to my phone.
For that, when I'm not at home, I can listen to you.
Is that permissible to do?
Yes.
I'll show.
Right click.
Right click.
Save target as.
Right.
Okay.
Cool.
And then I can save it to the computer and then put it on my phone.
I'm not infringing on any of your property rights or anything.
Okay, thanks, Kyle.
No problem.
All right.
Cool.
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate that.

Other residents at this address killed the Morales, Arnold Rangel, in Haya-Lia.
And here's a list of the neighbors.
Not quite as sharp as you thought you were, Mario, Marino.
You're about as sharp as you're a partner in crime there, as you're a boyfriend.
You're unmentionable one.
You're unfathomable one.
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
I have no friends.
Q-A-M, hello.
Good morning, you.
Yes, sir.
You mentioned Ricky Martin.
Did you see in the paper today where he became a father?
Yeah, right.
You know true stories.
Where are the water?
A guppy?
No, two twin boys.
Uh-huh.
It had to be a great pregnancy, but someone had it in for them.
But that's a true story.
If you look in the sun, then no Ricky Martin had twin boys by a surrogate mother.
God bless.
God bless.
Was that Red Skeleton?
Yeah, I must have been.
How do you like this?
Hi, Alia.
It's a pride by that?
No, not at all.
A lot of misfits in hi, Alia.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, that was almost too easy, you know what?
Oh, too easy.
Wait.
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
I'm Paul Meal.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Good.
Good.
Quick question now.
When people call your station when they're trying to crane call, you guys have those color IDs.
Is it against the law or anything?
Are you guys supposed to own your website so maybe, you know, actual call it.
Can we have color ID?
We have color ID since when?
Oh, you guys don't have that?
We don't have squat.
Oh, nothing.
Oh, sorry about that.
You got to tell Joe Bell to get on him, eh?
No, yeah.
Okay.
Tell Southern Bell and Joe Bell.
That's the problem.
We got the wrong bell.
When's the last time you've seen that, Fed asked, by the way.
Um, earlier in the week, once?
Yeah.
Like Tuesday or not sure.
You drop by and say, hey, George, how does things go?
What can I do to assist you guys?
Oh, you just stood at the door, waived.
I think he talked to Chris, though.
And what do you say to you, Fed, Chris?
Oh, actually, I don't think he did.
He just went.
He just ignored the meta-comments about his glasses.
He's got glasses now?
I think he always has.
He's got a new pair, though.
Oh, very stylish.
I said, do they sell men's glasses where you bought those?
WQAM, hello.
You know, Neil, I got a couple questions for you.
Yeah.
All right.
First of all, um, down at the casino, they're taking my favorite game.
What was it?
It was called Alien, right?
I don't know if you have a plate.
It's just like the move of the alien.
And then what happens is once you hit the bonus, you got these boards,
and you got to get the alien and take them out of the space.
Yeah, well, what's the question?
All right.
Well, I'm going to ask you what game, what game do you play?
Simply because I hear you're talking about it sometimes.
So down here in Florida, what games are like something that you might have up there?
What games are like something we might have up here?
Okay, they're all the same.
They're universal.
They're all made by the same companies.
We like to play and make quick games.
We like to slow in 100 bucks.
And which one do you play?
Let me tell you right now, Sarah,
full and his money are soon parted, okay?
Okay.
We'll hook up with a quarter-shot guy and you guys can compare notes.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 1 thing I'm not going to promote on the show is gambling.
Okay, if there's nothing worse than gambling, pouring around, no problem.
Getting drunk, doing drug, smoking weed, no problem.
Gambling, evil.
Oh, I shouldn't probably admit this because Chris will be making all kinds of stupid comments.
Guess where I was talking to going yesterday.
Woodbind.
Well, Paco wanted to go on.
He won 300 bucks.
All right, so you can just send the next check here.
Carefully.
Oh, yeah, yeah, something.
I wouldn't send you a check if I had $80 trillion sitting overflowing on in this room.
So you're going to get small bills?
I'm what?
You're going against the bet we made.
Bet my ass, okay?
That's a big bet?
Yeah, that's right.
Not as big as his ass though.
I'll tell you that.
Oh, no contest.
Good, golly.
And ask from a hell.
I'm pretty psyched about this.
I mean, how could anybody be that stupid not to know that you can trace a phone number or a fax number?
Oh, that answers its own question.
Oh, who ought to be a chronic stalker unless they were that stupid?
A genius.
A roadside.
Deputy QA M, hello.
What?
I got no party today.
Nobody comes over.
QA M, hello.
The fun now offers exciting electronic feedback.
Deputy QA M, hello.
Yes, did you call me?
No, we, we, we, we called you.
Hey, Neil.
Guess what we called you?
Guess what we called you?
Schmuck.
I got a quick, quick, quick.
I know a question you asked you.
Yeah.
Did you choose my voice out of the way?
Like, hot nose voice?
Deputy QA M, hello.
Neil.
Yes.
I'm not calling about Celia Curtis, so I apologize in the fan.
Do you have an IMAX up in Toronto?
I don't know.
An IMAX theater?
I don't know.
Oh, because I don't know if George Fodden, the regular theater or an IMAX,
but I thought the dark night is awesome.
Yeah.
An IMAX.
I'll take your word for it.
Good movie.
Even if you don't like Batman, it's, it's a great movie.
No, I love Batman, but that's got nothing to do with Batman.
Well, it's more genuine.
One of us, you know, the action is great.
The acting is great.
Well, we know it's more, it's more genuine one.
Well, as opposed to the Campy Oki form of Batman movies of the 80s and the 90s.
Batman begins with guns.
The point is zero.
Is there a Robin in this movie?
No.
So how can it be genuine?
That would be like a Sherlock Holmes movie.
It would be like a Sherlock Holmes movie without Dr. Watson.
Batman's thoughts about the Robin.
Well, who we heard.
That's the writer who denies it.
And of course, I'll find it.
I'll find it.
He didn't need help.
No, I'll get to it.
You sure?
Just relax, okay?
He was his ward.
Not his pedophile.
Thank you.
What is that under?
I mean, it's under...
I don't understand.
Hank, Hank, dash what?
He was his ward.
Oh.
Well, how do I find it?
I'll ward association.
You got to do a mental trick.
Beatles 97, Stone 78, everybody else is like an afterthought.
Even people with biggest names.
The best talent is you.
This is a model sport with a 560 QAM.
The fourth leader.
I am Celia Cruz and I am dead now.
And I remember when I was alive.
I was easy to remember when it was...
I'm dying out of here.
D-d-d-d-d-dory.
He had his friends eat up and win.
They put one back in because his heart is old.
But doctors told me it's the hardest thing.
But now we really know his heart is old.
No matter what we're told.
Yeah, Dick Cheney's got a heart that's old.
Hope it don't explode.
He makes decisions.
He has the vision.
He has the country under his control.
While pushing, jogging, digs veins are vlogging.
And that's what happens when your heart is old.
And it's full of holes.
Yeah, Dick Cheney's got a heart that's old.
And it's gonna blow.
He'll keep on working till his heart is cold.
He'll keep pretending that his heart ain't old.
But it's really old.
1132 at 560 WQAM, you'll be very pleased to know that I just filed a complaint with Bill
South.
All right.
I think they're online.
It was easiest pie.
Trying to fact yourself in but I'm getting that fast busy.
Oh, let me take a look at my fax machine, man.
Oh, receiving.
It says receiving.
Well, how can I be receiving?
Maybe it's stuck receiving or something.
I'm trying to get again.
Let me unstick it.
It's a Ricky Martin confirmation for what it's worth.
I don't care about that.
All these queens allegedly making babies.
All these people with their beard.
Yeah, they're pretty bastors.
Yeah, exactly.
Get out the turkey, Baster Ricky.
Okay, here's the way the poll shapes up right now.

WDQA M. Hello.
Hey, I got it a morning, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Two things.
If the lake down here is flooded, there's a goal up after this.
And there's a leak or a hole in the lake.
But that's here to say it figured that out.
But the New York Times reported the other day that 25% of all the people living in the
boroughs of New York have coral herpes.
And now they're saying that when you go to the bars, and even they use the wash in the
bar wash and with the brushes, with the blue chemical, it's supposed to kill it.
If there's lipstick on there, it's still festers underneath there.
They cannot kill the virus.
That's really great to know, isn't it?
Thank you, everybody.
Just another good reason to stay out of New York.
Click, he didn't even listen to a word I said.
What?
He didn't listen to a word I said.
He was already in the process of having a typical New Yorker, man.
Typical New Yorker.
Go back to New York, pal, and smear some lipstick on your...
Shiques.
God.
And that's your tell you where he's coming from anyway, shouldn't it?
He's...
Herpes intensive.
It's important.
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if we got it from the phone call.
Let me file out of the complaint.
All right.
No, I'm serious.
Yesterday, the day in between Tuesday's abortion on this show and today was the day I decided
to draw the line in the sand for the five minutes.
I'm only this time, I'm taking it into my hands.
Just like that little...
I mean, that was pretty easy this morning because you're dealing with somebody so stupid.
And of course, you've got the phone numbers.
It's only about three or four people.
That's all we have to deal with.
Right.
But, Johnny Joe Bell, he's got his private investigator.
Oh, he's going to take care of this.
He couldn't take care of his ass with both hands.
That's the kind of management we got.
Just pathetic, tragic.
Here it is.
It's 22-till noon and we don't know who's going to be on here at 2 today.
Oh, it's the lead able to fax to you.
Am I your friend?
I don't know why I'm an unblocked machine.
I still can't get a fax out to you.
Oh, well, let me take a look at mine.
Now, we're instead receiving.
It might be stuck receiving.
You might want to turn yours on and off, too.
Okay, I'll follow you.
Do it.
All right.
I'm done crawling around on the floor.
How about you?
Oh.
You know, they should put these things within arms.
I know.
I'm nitpicking again.
What's things?
Got that cartoon music, you know?
Yeah, it's Jesus.
Christ.
Oh, I love oil.
I love oil.
I already played that in yesterday.
Oh, did you?
Skip a couple.
Skip a couple of three.
Like, you can't correct this.
I'm going to show you.
And come, and you can't go down.
And come, and you can't go down.
Okay, I got it.
Unplugged and plugged.
All right.
I'll wait a little bit.
I'll just show unplugged.
So, now maybe something will happen.
Right.
Come to QAM.
Hello.
Yes, I'm Ricky Martin.
Oh, true, then.
QAM.
Hello, I'm Delil.
Yes, sir.
How about Louis?
Louis George.
He should be in the list.
Why is that?
Because he's a young boy.
Why?
Because he's a young boy.
He's a young boy.
He's older than the Thuslas grandpa.
Okay?
He's a young boy.
Oh, good name.
Little lights on one of his hair.
It's in the redness.
Forty-two.
The five fifty QAM.
The fourth leader.
Anybody have a heart?
Or a liver?
Looking for all in the sweaty.
Looking my sweaty ass.
You're sweaty.
Every hour I need a glass.
Take a bath.
Now the sunshine's got my head.
I'm hot.
My eyes are filling with boring sweat.
Where are you?
This is where I burn up.
Swing the lamp.
I think there was a man's disorder.
Shut up, my boy.
Since the seed was severed and doused.
It's on the holy heart.
I'm gonna know it when the AC is now switched.
What?
I do when it bleeds to feel cool.
It's dirt.
I don't think it is fine to be cool.
Ordinarily I'd ask you a nice breeze.
Right now I'd kill a penguin for his eyes.
I wonder if I should say...
Baby, hug.
Another sour run the morning break.
She's hot.
I'm better not cause I swear tokin'.
I'm barely hot.
There's not a dry spot on my skin.
No, whoa.
I'm not a tribe.
Every part of me is trippin' like a sick heart.
But my ass is steaming hot, but an assing heart call.
It's hot to say, kid, I am bacon.
Two sides.
Two sides.
Every part of me is fun like a sick heart.
My ass is steaming hot, but an assing heart call.
I'm now part of me.
And I'm still bacon.
Two sides.
Two sides.
Four feet tall, no.
7 feet off our naked bodies.
At 560 W.D. Q.A.
And we got somebody comin' up at two on the Jerkshire,
we don't know if Jerks is gonna be on.
You'll have to stay tuned.
Right.
You'll have to check back what this is to the sea, who's gonna be on.
We can find out around Newdish.
How big you're prun.
At least that's the pattern so far.
Oh, I see.
Well, maybe they're thinking about it.
James Borb Frey broke all the rules of how Sir Rest
When he went for a late night driving his pickup truck last month, he didn't observe his
curfew, he did not remain sober, he did not keep the peace, and as he crashed into a
kitchener car lot, this is in Ontario, Canada, driving naked while speeding drunk high on crack
cocaine next to a naked prostitute, it was not being a good behavior.
This is one of the most flammable, flammable, flammable, flammable, flammable, flammable
life, since I've ever seen, the Pennsylvania Brennan smart said it's almost the stuff of
comedy writers.
Volprey 39 of Waterloo already had a drunk driving record when he was convicted last
year of two weapons of fences and breach of record cognizance.
He received nine month conditional sentence of house arrest and went to a rehab facility
where he was an exemplary resident.
Once out and living with his sister, Volprey thought he had his problem under control
and gradually began drinking and taking drugs again.
Then on the night of July 30, he completely snapped.
He jumped in with both feet smart, said it's astounding.
The former owner of a landscaping business with a sick figure in come, Volprey got drunk
when out in his truck and picked up a prostitute and a kitchen or intersection.
Crowned prosecutor Mark Poland said Volprey then parked on East Avenue and smoked crack
with the woman before they both took their clothes off.
Volprey sped away on East masturbating while watching the woman masturbate.
Then Mr. Kerb went over an island and crashed into a park car at the intersection of Weber
Street.
Witnesses saw Volprey grab his clothes and dress while running away leaving the accident
and naked woman behind.
He was arrested after one of the witnesses followed him behind a nearby plasmagate police
in description.
I think you're either would struggle to find a more egregious breach, Poland told
justice, Colin Westman.
But a beat bit of boy.
I guess he kind of slipped up a little bit.
5 6 7 0 5 6 8 or not a call on the board man.
It's pretty grim, pretty weak.
For a Thursday the 21st of August you think that these people, Marlon's by the way lost
again last night.
Boy they're five behind.
They're sliding bad, aren't they Chris?
Yes they are.
They're slipping into oblivion.
5 6 7 0 5 6 8 pound 5 6 10 the Verizon singular wireless line.
Somebody Q I am hello.
Is the Red Hot Chili Peppers on that list?
No they are not.
They ought to be.
They put them on and they get bastard.

I mean you imagine can you even begin to imagine how many groups we could put on here?
Oh yeah like all of them.
Yeah like everyone that's ever been invented.
You got the book over there just start with a.
No that's a good idea.
I got the board board book.
We'll put the arthoom arthoom arthoom all the way to you know ZZ Zebra.
Now how many groups can you think of with a Z?
I could cheat but I don't want to.
Let me take a look.
Maybe there aren't many.
It's easy top.
It's easy top.
It's just as it was the zombies good.
You're cheating.

You're cheating too.
Zegorneva.
Zego 07.
Zorba the Greek and Zoro.
Zambi.

WQAM.
Hello.

Hello.
Michael Feltz was a glorified retard and I hated Jamaicans.
Okay.
Dolly noted.
Yeah.
What is the story of Michael Feltz?
He's got the thick tongue and like size 14 feet.
Maybe he's got a red feet like a duck.
Maybe that's why he's so fast.
You don't even think he should be disqualified for having like web feet?
Okay.
WQAM.
Hello.
Hello, Neil Godch.
Yes, sir.
Hey there.
Remember that clip he used to play?
That was so funny.
It pushed the lotion in the basket.
We haven't heard that one in a while.
Yeah.
What do you say?
What are the chances of maybe squeezing that in sometimes today?
Squeezing what?
Squeezing the lotion in the basket?
The clip.
Yeah.
The clip.
Squeezing the lotion in the basket.
All right.
All right.
Okay.

WQAM.
Hello.
You're my only friend.
QAM.
Hello.
QAM.
Hey, Neil.
What about the zebra?
That's a big group.
QAM.
Hello.
Neil, I realize there's been some bad words and some bad feelings exchanged between us during the call.
Let me say that how many times have you called here today?
Well, I felt I needed to call again.
Let me ask you again.
It's a very simple question.
It doesn't require an IQ of over four.
How many times have you called this show today?
I felt I needed to call again.
Let me try one more time to get an answer to my question.
How many times have you called this show today?
This is number three and there's a reason for it.
And you know that it's limited to one.
One call per day.
One call per day.
And anybody who doesn't abide by one call per day, we're going to like the wrath of Joe Bell is going to be on their ass.
Then you're going to really be sorry.
Because when jolly Joe Bell comes knocking on your door three in the morning and his bathrobe like Xavier Suarez,
then you're going to be really wonder what the hell you did.
Just like your friend, Mario, Mario Moreno.
Yeah, love buddy.
Who lives in Hylia?
Mm-hmm.
Along with Hilda Morales and Arnold Arrangle.
And that by the way is a phone number.
It's not, you know, in other words, they just use the phone for the facts.
I see.
It's not a separate fact number.
My facts, by the way, is waiting for your stuff.
Let me try it again.
Try it again.
Bring it along.
In fact, here's the math.
Not that far from Hylia racetrack where Mario lives.
Maybe he could stick him out there with his flamingos in the middle of the lake.
Or under the middle of the lake would be good.
WQAM, hello.
Yeah, good morning, Neil.
Yes, sir.
This is my first call of the day, by the way.
Uh-huh.
I listen.
Was it you the other day who mentioned that you saw the dude who's turning into a tree somewhere
and...
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
And just that worked you?
Yes.
Okay, cool.
All right.
I was wondering.
Because that caused George yesterday, man.
I'm telling him about it and he doesn't believe me.
I don't believe you.
You don't...
Okay, look.
He's growing in the park.
He's growing right.
He's growing into his arms.
Solid pictures.
It's a glorified word.
It's not a control word.
It's not a control word, man.
Yes, it is.
It's something that's right there.
Maybe he's bigfoot.
Maybe he's bigfoot.
He's got a lot of money.
Like Michael Phelps, he's bigfoot feet.
Oh, your face came through.
All right.
That's just for text purposes.
I know you don't care at this point.
Oh, boy.
Singer Ricky Martin's become the father of twin boys, born to a surrogate mother.
Martin 36, best known for a song, live in La Vida, loca.
Didn't reveal the boys names of the location of their births, but said they are healthy
people magazine reported.
Yesterday, the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy under Ricky's full-time
care.
Right.
Ricky is just like Michael Jackson's kids.
The Puerto Rican singer is unmarried and the same and didn't reveal the identity of
the surrogate mother.
Martin is long-ten-eyed, rumors that he is gay.
Despite having a large gay fan following, he's also well known for his charity work on
children's causes through his Ricky Martin foundation.
And for that, I had to go through that song and dance with the facts machine.
Well, I'm sure another good facts will come in at some point.
You think so?
Maybe we'll get another good thanks from some chronic of your phone number listed on.
Herio.
Herio.
Oh, yeah.
Starting David Jansen.
David Jansen was also the fugitive.
Yes, he was.
He's got to be dead, right?
I don't know.
Well, Google.
I think it's spelled with two S's, by the way.
J-A-N-S-S-S-E-N.
I could be wrong about that, but I don't think so.
Really strange.
He was, he's pretty good.
Good actor.
You got it?
Uh, if it's, um, who I think, then no, he's still alive.
He's still alive?
He's got to be at least 180.
40 or 30.
By the way, in ordinary on Thursday, we would be getting all set for our big neal deal and
two for one deals and the discount on the restaurants and the good food.
You guys maybe would be eating some of that good food, but guess what?
It's the lotion in the basket.
That's right.
Not today.
The best talent you've ever loved is 4th to 5.60 Q-A-M.
The fourth leader.
Coach Donshuler.
And I sell a Bob Hope on acid.
And I want to tell you, it's the 12-1 hour or whatever it is.
Now you can listen to the nation's best-selling Hal II guide in the words of the author
himself.
I've always wanted it to be a daddy.
It's Clay A. Constoring memoir.
Hal II and Pregnator Woman.
That Clay A. can tell you how it's done.
From meeting the prospective mother.
Do you want that in cash or traveler's checks?
To the moment of conception.
First you go into this little room and think nasty thoughts.
Oh, a bit far.
Take my stuff.
Take my stuff.
Wow.
Oh, where's that turkey bister?
To the blessed moment of birth.
It was born when, but I was in the teddy bear or something.
Gotta go.
I'm doing Regis and Kelly.
Hal II and Pregnator Woman.
The new audio book from Clay A. can.
I hope you have as much fun listening to this as I had dictated it.
I love dictation.
Oh, man.
Trouble 1.
Well, I thought that was kind of timely with the Ricky Martin story at all.
What do you think?
I think it's a joke.
How are we doing on Chris' pole?
813.
You got a real shot at a thousand now, mister.
All right.
We're talking some serious business.
And I bet you at least Miguel still won't have any vote, but I'm going to look.
Got another school shooting in Knoxville, Tennessee.
Everybody should have a gun.
That's the American way, man.
Everybody in school at work.
In your car.
In your car.
In your vine.
In your bicycle.
In your balcony minigun sticking up out of the hood of my car.
In your car.
Knoxville, Tennessee, a student in favor of a shot of 16-year-old class made during a dispute
to the day at Knoxville High School, and a suspect was taken in custody moments later
on the nearby street.
The shooting happened shortly after eight this morning at the Central High School cafeteria
chief deputy Bill Roll said the suspect and victim knew each other said Knox County
School so far intended to build that entire.
This wasn't a shooting that was a random act, Roll said.
It was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual, not the school
of the students inside the school.
He was pissed off, fired up, and he took her a business.
Authorities have released the names of the victim who died at University of Tennessee Medical
Center or the suspect.
No other students were injured, thanks God.
The school was placed on lockdown after the shooting.
School officials were preparing to release students one classroom at a time, then bust
into a church so they could be picked up by their parents.
Knoxville, Tennessee.
I bet there's a lot of kids with guns, Tennessee.
Don't you think?
I'm editing.
Probably in Florida too.
What about the kids?
Oh sure.
I'm going to talk about high school kids.
You don't think?
Oh, in Montana we all have guns.
All the kids.
Well there you go.
Of course it's the American way in the way.
Everybody got to have a gun.
13 or 14 hours.
That's all the continents.
Everybody got that.
The bird shooting.
No.
He's shooting.
Alp.
You get pissed off.
It's a good way to resolve the dispute.
And always better when you've got one and the other guy doesn't.
56670560.560 and they've arrived in Singular Wireless Line.
WQAM, hello.
And back at you.
QAM, hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Let me try it again.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Then what do you got?
What's your name?
David Chan.
They were talking about David Chan.
I was on the wrong side.
I'm going to try that.
He must be dead 15 years.
Okay, thanks.
Are you close?
More than that.
When do you die?
80.
Oh my God.
I've been dead for 28 years.
Can you imagine what he smells like now?
Like so you cruise?
Like the Fugitive.
And you were right by the way.
Two S's.
Yeah, David Chan with two S's.
Unusual spelling.
And you still couldn't find it.
Never the last.
Leave it to this retardo guy that just called.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Can you hear me?
Hello.
It's just, you know, it's just every single day that I do this show.
It just solidifies in my mind so many of the reasons that I don't want to be in Florida.
Any more than I have to.
Couple of days here, a couple of days there.
That's enough.
That's more than enough.
WDQA and hello.
Hey, Neil, are you taking applications to host the two to four show today?
Yes, sir.
Okay, I'll be right over in about 20 minutes with the flying family.
Okay, no, no food.
No food.
I'm sorry.
Bring your own.
Oh, yeah, you can bring your own.
That's right.
B-Y-O, bring your own bag.
Especially if she looks like she, if you want to automatically get the job just to be wearing a jock strap over your face.
Yeah.
Be sniffing it, snorting it, looking it.
So you said around noon we'd be here in the, uh...
I said that's the pattern.
Normally that's when it's, uh, has been happening.
Well, it's 12.05, Mr. We still don't have any clue who's going to be on it.
So I guess jerks might be on today in the twilight.
I'm still at place, uh, place on the desk.
What? That'd be something.
Why?
I'm still at making any bets.
WDQA and hello.
I have a thought, that's it.
We didn't know that Geldie will be on from 4-7 from Addog was vacationing this week.
The squeak, my street.
You're got buddy that you were a consorting with yesterday.
I don't want to hear it again.
You guys always got along great.
Bapapapa.
Yeah. Good. I'm glad.
I don't listen to any of the other shows on this station.
I have no opinion about the other shows on this station.
You know what it will be in Chinese.
You don't have an opinion on whether he belongs on the year or not.
I don't.
Now that's a lie.
I don't.
I don't know how good of a sports show he does.
He's got a squeaky voice.
I'm talking about it.
Well, the sports show is, I'm talking about that.
Hey, a lot of people around the year that have weird voices that have been very successful
Larry King.
Uh-huh.
You're putting Geldie in the class with me.
I'd rather listen to, I'd rather listen to Goldie's talk about hockey than anything from
Larry King.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Wow.
W2AM. Hello.
Q-Y-M. Hello.
Hello, Neil. The great day to you.
Hello.
Neil. The great day to you.
The great day to you.
Hello.
Are you still there?
Hello.
Neil.
Are you taking applications to the sports show?
I already got here ago that you wanted to call this.
It would give you a 90 share.
I believe it was the roughest one, wasn't it?
W2AM. Hello.
Happy birthday to you, me.
Q-Y-M. Hello.
Q-Y-M.
I'm your friend.
Oh, a stunts program.
Wow.
An imitator.
Oh my god, and a really bad one too.
It's inspired a great height, then.
Let's see.
The uh- seven, when you were in school, you had to worry about swimming naked.
George had to worry about a weed hookup.
Uh-branded says I had to worry about my school blowing up, and now kids worry about coming home from school alive.
Yeah, that's the American way, man.
Go to school and maybe get the-
Shut off.
Metal detector's in school now.
Hmm.
A lot of schools and metal detectors that goes to hand in the public just-
The public in America, it can be conditioned and manipulated like-
Like a play-doh.
Like silly putty.
Am I right?
Yep.
Absolutely.
You bet.
WQ-Y-M, hello.
Kill.
Yes.
I'm playing in the beta, Metal-Curve.
WQ-Y-M, hello.
And finally, Q-Y-M, hello.
Hey, Neil, I want to stink of limey, and this is my phony American ass test.
It's me.
Good one.
Yeah.
Good job.
I'm-
I'm-
I'm-
I'm-
I'm-
You're right.
Let's-
Let's take with the call.
WQ-Y-M, hello.
Hello, V-
Hello.
WQ-Y-M, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Hey, George.
Yeah.
Hey, do you remember in bowling for Columbine after they shot the little kid shot the other little kid in the kindergarten?
And then they show that smug uh, uh, Charlton has been with his-
There's hearts to heal.
What a smug.
I hope he's burning in hell right now.
He is.
That's all I got.
Okay.
I love you.
Okay. He's hot.
He's still wearing those spandex pants from the movie so.
They should melt real fast when you think.
I bet.
Good old talk, heston man.
There was a real guy.
There was a real man of God.
Michael Moore made such a jackass out of him in like five minutes or less and with like, uh, easy.
Do you son of a bitch?
Right.
That was the Q-Y-M, hello.
I bought myself a gift.
Q-Y-M, hello.
Now this is Dr. Chica.
W-Q-Y-M, hello.
Hello?
Yes?
Hey Neil, how you doing?
Okay. Can you hear me?
Listen.
I'm not going to be able to come in today that I can free up to-
W-Q-Y-M, hello.
Q-Y-M.
Hello.
Hello.
Hey, you know, I've uh, never called you a show.
I've been listening for a long time.
I've met you when you were in school.
I went to South-Aid shopping center and we were all bitten up by mosquitoes.
But my goodness, there's a lot of crazy people in this town.
No kidding.
I think I'm out.
Thank you.
What do you say he thinks what?
I think I'm out.
Thank you.
Oh.
Well, you're welcome.
You're certainly more than welcome.
You're out all right.
W-Q-Y-M, hello.
I'm Jack the fifth.
He's so full.
He's so full.
W-Q-Y-M, hello.
That's another thing about George.
He talks over everybody.
Can you hear me now?
I heard you the first time.
Well, he had a call on yesterday.
He was plugging this charity and he just rambling on.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Yeah.
Mom, glad to have you.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Please, please.
Biggest name.
The best talent.
You're 15th largest.
Fortly to 5.60 km.
Big fourth leader.
Suck it in and hold it.
From the director of Batman,
the producer of Mama Mia.
Mama Mia.
Here I go again.
It's one mother of a movie.
The Dark Knight star Christian Vales following up his record-smeshing Batman movie
with a stint in jail as British media reported was arrested today,
allegedly assalling his mother and sister.
Heets Batman.
Versus his mama.
I don't want to talk.
Because it makes me feel sad.
Where do we begin?
Christian Bayo is no mama's boy.
I wasn't exactly what I had in mind.
I said I wanted to aspire to Batman.
Versus his mama.
What happened to our love?
It is to be so good.
It's simple.
Kill the Batman.
Serenzo Viti is not advised.
Together, let's sing, please.
I'm 16, so our Super Spy brand.
He tells me we have a technical glitch going on today and it's been going on all through the show.
Five seconds after we do the thing live,
the delay, five seconds later, repeats on the air in the background.
As a replacement for the Fidel Castro interference.
Well, no charge.
If you missed what we said the first time, listen closely.
Crank it up and you'll hear it the second time.
Or if you missed somebody's great calls the first time, crank it way up.
I would you think that somebody inside would have...
Or that somebody...
No, called?
Not on the inside, no.
You mean like when we were off the year on Tuesday for five minutes and nobody inside?
Correct.
Anything about it?
Correct.
I see.
I'm not a Chinese laundry.
Sure.
I'm telling you, that would be...
I think this area could use a nice deli.
No deli, that involves food, man.
Well, we'll be charging for it.
Five, six, seven, oh, five, sixty, pound, five, sixty, under Verizon's singular, wireless line.
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
I'm 43.
Oh, that little red light keeps coming on again.
Yeah, just ignore it.
What?
Just ignore it.
No, I understand that, but any of it...
It comes on, that means you're going to get a stupid call.
Oh, it keeps coming on.
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
Yes, one time I had a religious experience at Seventh Cruiser's conference.
I don't know.
Uh-huh.
That sounds like a seated cruise groupie to me.
Sure.
What the hell was he talking about?
I don't know.
Oh.
Five, six, seven, oh, five, sixty, pound, five, sixty, under Verizon's singular, wireless line.
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
You think there's any way we can edit Charlton's lesson out of the planet of the Eight movies?
How about writing McDowell?
Hey, Roddy.
You ferry.
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
I would appreciate Seventh Cruiser's whole talk of silly cruise, you big MF.
I always like to let the M.
There's a certain sound at the end of the hang up thing.
That's a very ender.
We're kind of like pops.
You know, like popcorn.
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
You must kill someone I only.
Q-A-M, hello.
Hello?
Yes.
Uh, this W-D-Q-A-M?
Yeah.
But I just say when I answer the phone, I said Q-A-M, hello.
I'm fine about that.
I'm a self-honored and texty, super-fac-re-spec-recaw.
Yeah.
I just want to know, are you guys doing the way any of the office participants we can?
No, we are not.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you very much.
The five millionth caller at 1-800-Schmitzbag,
are we giving away any dolphin tickets?
It's amazing.
When I read line came on.
That means you're going to get a stupid call.
Q-A-M, hello.
What's up, Uncle Neil?
Yes, sir.
What do you got?
Well, considering how weak the call is, today, I might qualify as a real caller, but I wouldn't hold back.
What's your take on Obama's BP choice?
You think you're going to pick Biden?
I don't know.
But they keep talking about Biden, but Biden is from Delaware, which has got what?
Like about a half an electoral vote.
And he's already, I mean, Delaware always votes to Democratic anyway.
So what's the big upside?
The fact that Biden is an expert on foreign world affairs and international law?
Well, what's the big upside with Joe Biden?
Well, I think the first one, he just said what it is.
The second one, he's a name.
He's a name that's known.
The other guy's I've never even heard of before.
Yeah.
That's sad.
You're right.
I mean, it's not much, you know, the other guy's I've never heard of the other guy before.
No, I remember I, the rumor I was hearing yesterday is that they had John Edwards picked and then the sex scandal came out and then they had like switch gears.
Oh, thank God the scandal came out because John Edwards, I mean, look what he did for John Kerry.
Yeah.
Just what Hugh Lieberman did for Al Gore, he can do for John McCain.
Well, it's something out of it.
But the whole thing is how, you know, the Russian, all these back houses, let's see what the Messiah can do.
Let's see what the Messiah can do.
Why is it that now this kid has the fix what they have up for eight years?
You know, I love that attitude.
Well, you fix it now.
Boy, you know, like who can fix this in eight years?
Nobody.
Yeah.
But the fact that McCain is ahead in a couple of the polls now by five points, what does that tell you?
There it is.
You asked what?
Well, what kind of a conversation was that?
What kind of a conversation was that?
I can't answer that.
I think it begins with F.
And he said he was going to be a real car, you know.
Real politically, you know, F.
Politically F.
Yeah, F. We're all F. Make no mistake about that.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
Hi.
Hi.
We're going out with the call today.
Well, random.
There's so few to be random, but this is hilarious.
Anyway, George is there, right?
He's here.
I had a question for him.
I listened sometimes to time and he always has, I don't know, like his outtake on marriage being a merry man.
My outtake is...
Take a...
Take a...
It's negative.
Yeah.
And I personally don't want to get married.
Go, go, go.
I'm sorry?
Trust me, don't.
Okay.
Well, I am pretty young so saying that I don't ever want to is...
I don't know, something to say.
Never mind. Don't rush things. How's that?
I'm sorry?
Take your sweet time.
I'm...yeah, for sure.
But why? Like, why are you still married if you don't like the whole...
Children.
You have two kids that he's...
I don't want my children to have a stepfather.
If you didn't have the two kids he'd have been going a long time ago.
That's right.
That's not nice.
That's very nice.
When it's not nice, it's honest.
Yeah, and it's...
You've got a 50% divorce rate and you say, oh, that's not nice.
And that's the most common reason people stay married.
So do you think that I have a girlfriend?
Of course not.
Okay, you just regret having them with a bitch.
Oh, that's another thing.
Why? Why is a bitch hot?
What? Why? Cause she is?
Ask her.
Yeah, but not that specifically.
She knows she don't care.
You, but you mentioned whenever you first were females, you call them bitches.
No, that's not true. Only the ones that are.
Last week you did.
Only the ones that are bitches are bitches.
Are you trying to tell us that there are no women who are bitches?
Of course they are, but...
It was a sleeping bitch.
Ask anybody that knows her.
But you know how they say if you don't have nothing nice to say.
Yeah, they say that.
Yeah, well, you know what?
I don't agree.
Okay, we do a top show and if we have anything nice to say, we wouldn't say anything at all.
We just have dead air all of a sudden.
And you can get a Cuban interference in the background from Phenop.
And you can hear Mario in the background in Hylia.
Oh, get me out of this. What do I do now?
Oh, and by the way, the information that the listener said you was wrong.
But who, what?
The information that you sent me that you emailed me that was incorrect.
Okay, well, I know. I wanted you to match it up.
That just came from a fellow listener.
I mean, how can there be a fax number that's the same as a phone number?
There can be people who use their phone numbers.
Yeah. That's a fax, yeah.
But their computers.
No, no, no, no, no. You don't understand.
The phone number that was listed in there, the fax number,
was the same as this phone number from your good friend, Mario.
Okay.
Which I know, we already know because he signed his name eight million times
and used the name Mario all the time on the air.
So we know that this one is correct.
4305-883-8538.
Okay.
Phone numbered line type, landline.
This is from the reverse phone detective, by the way.
Oh, good.
Private Dick.
You got to probably buy that.
Not to mention, by the way, all the drawings speaking of that,
the pictures and the fax we were getting.
You dug a deep hole for yourself, Mario.
Fario.
Yeah, Fario is exactly right.
You're fairy.
From 26th of QA.
What's your biggest name?
The best tower.
You're the largest.
4305-50QAM.
And then, fourth leader.
I'm gonna cut my balls so I can outsex with you.
What is the point point?
Now I'll be free to leave without the mere pregnancy.
Such an transmit will stop.
Once that I hitch up, I'm gonna cut my balls
because I hear the pain ain't that bad.
You got to wait as long as you're a fan of the past.
Oh, Karen, it makes my boys feel high.
I'm gonna cut my balls so I can outsex with you.
I can outsex with you.
What is the point point?
I'm gonna cut my balls so I can outsex with you.
I'm gonna cut my balls so I can outsex with you.
From 32 to 560-70QAM.
My guess is that the Curtis will be on it too.
Okay.
That's my guess.
Since our program director doesn't want to tell us who's actually gonna be on it.
I mean, why would they want to tell us who's actually gonna be on it?
Tune in at 2-0.
No, you're business. That's why.
It's none of my business.
Yeah, it's none of nobody's business.
Well, there's no business like Bill Business and this place blows.
Let's see how Chris is doing on that pole.
Well, there's 6,000 groups on there.
The greatest rock performer or performer's group of all time.
Beals 104, stones 89, Elvis 50, Led Zeppelin 48.
853.
853 vote.
I don't know.
I don't think you're gonna make your 1,000.
Did Luis Miguel get a vote?
I don't know.
Yeah, he got a vote.
Kentations got a vote.
Rod Stewart got a vote.
There's a whole bunch with no votes.
A Rio Speedwagon, which I can understand that.
The core is primus, mitrider, and the detour wheels.
That's a racial thing.
The Ramones, Janice Joplin, Phil Collins, traveling Wilburys,
Fats Domino, White Stripes and J-Giles 0.
Out of 853 vote.
How can Fats Domino have...
Oh, like that.
He didn't even do all of that one poll that we did.
Favorite dead plane crash recording artist.
I voted for him twice and he got like three votes.
Fats Domino?
Yeah.
Died in a plane crash?
Or the big bopper.
Sorry.
I always confuse those fat black people.
That would be QAN, hello.
Well, mentally.
Okay, there it is.
There it is.
He's next down to list, by the way.
You got his number?
I don't know about his.
Persecret.
We did the other ones.
Daron?
Hi, Ron.
Daron?
Yeah, we did.
I don't know where it is.
You still have a Chris?
No.
He changes it every couple of months.
Really?
Well, it's a cell phone.
Probably buys those gas station cell phones.
You just wait, man, because Jolly Jobelle,
he's got his private investigator.
Oh, he's on the case.
Oh, you'll see, Neil.
See, his solution to everything is screened to cause.
I don't want to.
And I ain't gonna.
You screen him, that's fine.
That's when you do the show.
I never tell you what to do.
How to do it?
You do it.
That's your deal.
I hate those people.
You hate what people?
Those four retards.
You know?
Homosexual stalkers.
Gay.
Yeah.
Incredibly.
Like Mary, or with all the pictures of Penis and...
Sure.
And isn't it interesting that his close personal buddy
is the unmancipatable one?
We'll talk about a wild...
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, gay.
Butterflies of a feather.
Obsession of a feather.
Rub it together.
W-D-Q-I-M, hello.
Q-I-M.
Oh, no.
Sorry about that.
Yeah, okay, sure.
Likely story.
Couldn't pull the trigger, could you, Pally?
Cowboy.
W-D-Q-I-M, hello.
The big bumper was not black.
Yes, no.
Correct.
No kidding.
That was pretty profound, wasn't it?
George, just learn something.
Yeah, I don't mind it.
W-D-Q-I-M, hello.
Yes, Dale?
Yes, sir.
I want an investigation of...
Yeah, investigation.
You know what?
We investigate yourself.
Stick your head, and he goes on your...
Correct, please.
And see what you find in there, okay?
Oh, he's already got a head start on that, huh?
Like you said, four, the fabulous four.
Sure.
And that's it.
Especially now that we got Mario in the dumper.
Maybe Mario was gonna...
Maybe Mario's busy getting phone calls at home.
He wants to talk to him in the garage, his audience.
I think they oughta talk to him, don't you?
Indeed.
What's that date number again?
305.
Where is it?
Oh, 883, 8538.
883, 8538.
He wants to talk to all you folks, give him a call.
Keep him busy.
Keep him off our phone.
Keep him off our fax machine.
With his death threats and pornographic drawings.
W-D-Q-I-M, hello.
Q-I-M, hello.
Q-I-M, hello.
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
Okay.
The guy who called you said you have a, instead of a castro,
uh, fecarring in the, in the background,
there is like a, uh, little bit of a, I guess, an echo sound.
All I can say is that it must be Castro in his old age.
He must be tuning in the Neil Rogers show and having a broadcast in Cuba.
What do you think?
So we do have a technical malfunction at the junction again.
Yeah, leave it, leave it to the listeners to have to figure it out.
Not engineering, of course, not anybody inside the building.
You start up getting it?
I bring your party, starting up again.
Yeah.
New bed, big time.
I mean, big time.
Not just starting up, but big time.
W-D-Q-I-M, hello.
Q-I-M, the Neil Rogers show.
Hello, that sound.
B-B-B-B-Q-A-M, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes.
What happened to Orlando from the old specs remote,
remote, Orlando, the hot, Orlando?
Yeah, I remember him.
What about it?
What happened to him?
He ran off and disappeared.
With him, we didn't look at him.
Love you, bye.
All right, so we do the lineup.
We do know the lineup.
Wait a minute.
We know the lineup for this afternoon.
It's only 12.37.
It's all 12 minutes to go until two o'clock.
Why should we be in anything hurry?
I've actually jerked.
Okay, now first, where did you find this information from?
From Lee, who was able to somehow track down there.
So in other words, the promotions guy,
heading in to hold of the program director,
to advise the on the air staff
is the who is going to be doing two to four?
Well, we used to be a program director at our radio station,
so he knows what he's talking about.
Oh, he knows what he's talking about.
Working radio.
Yes.
Well, how about maybe a phone?
Like us.
Yeah, and the answer is, the answer is,
Curtis, two to four.
What did I say?
Goldie, four to seven.
And what did I say?
I think Curtis is going to be on today.
Where's Jerk's?
Does he steal Ellen?
Must be.
Is that the...
Yeah.
Wait, Jerk!
Wait, Jerk!
Jerk, you need to look behind the head.
Wait, Jerk!
I guess what that's called is another admission
of a mistake by Jolly Jobelle, admitting that they blew it
by putting him on between two and four?
Maybe it was just supposed to be an experiment.
Like the Kenny and Blow morning show.
That was quite an experiment.
Number Mr. Wizard?
Sure did.
On Herbert?
Heat Mr. Wizard?
What was his sidekick's name, Timmy or something?
I don't know.
And I don't care.
Bobby, Billy, Timmy?
I don't know.
I don't care.
21 to 1 at 560 WQ.
And we got Curtis for somebody or two.

Well, well, one Democrat down had a few more million to go, my friend.
He he!
Thanks to one brave Republican practicing has gone give and right to take everything I say as TRUTH!
Yeah, I want to take all my loyal little heads. We're obeying my words.
Words of homes, fund hatred, that are protected by the Suffolk and media and FCC.
D'Alau, joining me on the phone direct from my very own slice of the limbaugh heaven is Tim Dale Johnson,
the gunman and Republican hero who shot and killed Arkansas Democratic Party chairman Bill Guatney.
Great work in the service of Rush and God.
Thank you, Rudd.
I asked you, you know we need more courageous Republicans like you, my friend.
It's too bad you're dead.
Well, good brother, it's the least I can do.
You ain't this right country's bar, so I'm the wrong track.
The Elz of Rush has a devil put aside for you, my friend.
Thank you, in Rush. Well, I gotta go now. I got some word for her and it's my skull.
The Republican Party will miss you.
I'm gonna miss my crystal bed.
Put it up and to the leave, my friend.
I'll hang up and listen.
I want all little heads within the sound of my voice from the comfort of my comedy convention.
To play case your ignorance by killing all Democrats before it's too late.
It'll look good for us in November, my friends.
So if we can't be the Democrats, my friends.
Kill them, kill them all.
From 25 to 560 WQAN.
I guess what? You're good.
One, Mario.
One previous address in Bronx, New York.
Makes sense.
Uh-huh.
One previous address and then some other previous addresses locally.
Just amazing the wealth, the vault of information that's available on there.
560.560 on the Verizon singular wireless line.
And you know what we've had no further communication from Selcid, the Mario.
Corrected that reverse or look up.
Correct.
Huh.
Hopefully the others were so easy.
Oh, they actually are if, you know, they don't mean easy to get rid of.
Yeah.
First you need the phone numbers.
Right.
And then you need people who are going to do something about it.
Uh-huh.
Oh, sorry. Sorry, Joe Bell.
So we got cursed as I predicted for Jerks today because, well, why can't they just say that Jerks is history?
Why can't they just say that?
And the Gellies going to be doing two to four.
One, one, one hey that they have they ever.
You think back all the ways that they fired, all the ways that people get fired and, uh,
or find out that they've been fired by listening to a rejoined for another show during their day part, etc.
Nobody QAM, hello.
QAM, hello.
Not doing a row.
QAM, all right.
Uncle Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, how you doing?
Okay.
Is it Neil?
Is it just every time I see Lieberman's puts on TV with McCann just makes me infuriated?
I mean, I just, I get tense, taken about it.
I get physically ill.
Are they in a relationship for a month?
My gut's so, yeah, they're doing it, yeah.
I'm believein' that you were talking earlier about the polls that Obama's selling in a couple of the polls.
I can't understand that for the life of me because...
I'm the latest Reuters-Roydor Zogby pull on McCann's five points ahead.
How is that even possible?
How is it possible?
I mean, I believe you.
I'm just saying what it is.
There are a lot of people just waiting for good excuse or even a bad excuse not to vote for a black guy.
That's how it's possible.
In this country in 2008, I mean, I'm not trying to be naive here, but it's from my head.
I'm not trying to be naive here.
You may not be trying, but you're sure getting there.
Well, you know, no, I'm nervous.
I'm stunned after eight years of this crap that were people want to even book.
Obama should be 15 points ahead, minimal.
15.
I agree.
I see now it's two months to be elected and ridiculous.
Anyways, I'm almost wrong to do here.
I'm just making it crazy because I see a hole or a lever been on TV.
It just drives me nuts.
Well, crawl under the bed.
We'll let you know when it's safe to come out.
I will.
Thank you, sir.
You have today.
See, there are some problems with McCann's story about the divorce from his first wife.
Is there?
Yeah.
And the fact that he was diddling with the Cindy for months before he finally divorced the first wife.
Oh, well, that's okay.
He's a Republican.
That's all right.
Oh, that's right.
Even if it's gay, that's okay.
That's correct.
Like you mean, your governor?
Gay, Charlie Limpress, Chris.
Oh, I was thinking about the other guy, Larry Craig.
Whatever happened, Larry Craig.
He's back in business.
Nothing.
I'm actually still happening.
That's right.
He's still, I'm in fact, I'm actually, I know right now while we're sitting here talking about him, what he's doing.
You're looking for glory holes.
No question.
Nobody's QAM.
Hello.
QAM.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
Anya, how you doing?
Okay.
I got one to know how it's possible.
I was having a conversation with some guy at the gym the other day and he's complaining about the economy and everything.
And we're talking to each other.
But I just came up with that chocolate drop and that's what came out of this guy's mouth.
And that's what a lot of people think.
That's just not going to go from the dark.
They don't care if the country's going to hell.
They don't care about any of this.
If Obama were white, he'd be 25, 30 points ahead right now.
Oh yeah, the whole election will be over.
But that's what came out of this guy's mouth.
I mean, chocolate drop.
Yeah, chocolate drop is all.
So good luck to us.
We'll go ahead and eat it.
Okay.
Vote over and off in pounds.
All I can tell you.
Bigoted, narrow-minded, hostile, stupid, idiotic people.
So many of them.
I mean, McCain, he didn't even know what planet he's on.
Right.
He doesn't even know that Iraq doesn't have border-Afghanistan.
He doesn't even know the geography theory and much less anything else.
Oh, but he's got such great expertise in world affairs.
Yeah, because he was a POW for five years.
That gives him great expertise in foreign affairs.
He's got lots of expertise in domestic affairs his own.
And by the way, it wasn't just Cindy.
He was the little and well the first wife was dying.
It was a whole bunch of him.
He had a whole lineup.
How about George?
Only George ain't running for public office.
That's right.
And I'm not a hypocrite.
Now, he's the more George is pleased and proud to be here
at screwing around on the bitchy.
Go ahead Larry.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
I live.
I was a flat man of all bodies of...
W-Q-A-M, hello.
Q-A-M, hola.
Hey, there I'm going.
Okay.
Hey, two things.
I'll be the courage and yield come wrong through my bedroom.
And back of the wall.
I like to tell you that you smoked.
See you later buddy.
5667-0560, pound 560 on the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.
No reaction to the fact that Curtis Stevenson's going to be on today at two o'clock.
As opposed to Jerks.
They're used to it.
They're used to one.
That.
The erratic scheduling that goes on here.
The erratic spastic musical chairs.
The fact that we had to have flea call a clearance to find out who the hell is going to be on at two o'clock.
Just stop and think about how grotesque that is.
How unprofessional, how bush league, how amateur hour, how little league.
Not even the little leagues of radio.
No, I'm not going to stop and think.
Because I go crazy if I do.
That's correct.
And the fact that the beastlies have handed the keys to the kingdom to this irrational thing.
This psychotic, this temperamental lunatic.
Oops.
He's like Rumpel Stiltskin and drag.
Who the hell was Rumpel Stiltskin?
And who is Stumbelina?
W.T.R.Y. as Hello.
I stand to drop the drops with my cut-up.
Q.A.M. Hello.
Hey Neil.
Yes sir.
How you doing?
Good.
I just wanted to send a message out to Joe Bell that it brings or cotton.
You couldn't make a tampack of this ant.
You clizzling, you simpleton, you feedback.
How you doing?
But how do you think he really felt?
He don't like it Joe.
He don't like you at all.
In fact, I think that the audience, the long suffering audience of this radio station probably would like to march on the radio station and protest.
They keep recycling and recycling and recycling and shuffling the deck, shuffling the deck.
Todd Rex to learn by the way?
Yeah, unfortunately.
Oh my god.
What bad news that is?
And PD Lenny, don't be...
Take me off your mass email list please PD Lenny.
I'm not interested in reading your sad pathetic, attentive humor.
Send an email out a couple of weeks ago.
Oh, he's running for a person at PD Lenny and he...
And you like him?
No, no.
Yes, don't...
Don't miss quote me like you always do.
You like him?
I miss him.
I said I miss...
Just like Yolte.
I said like Yolte.
I miss him in that department.
You absolutely will not admit that you know the guilty.
Don't belong on the air just even to give the time.
Listen, this format doesn't belong on the air.
Forget about the format.
There are some people who belong on the air no matter what the format is.
Whether it's country music, no it's picking, sports, talk, whatever it is.
You know, let me show people who don't belong on the radio.
And then maybe his son's voice would be tolerable if he's talking about something I might be interested in.
Maybe, but I'll never know.
Now what's the story with line 5?
QAM Hello.
What was that?
Did you see that?
No.
It was like frozen.
QAM Hello.
What's your nuts before that operation?
QAM Hello.
What's up?
Hello, Neil.
No, we're not.
They didn't freeze your nuts?
No.
Oh, they said...
It's a spits.
Hello.
Hello.
How you doing?
How's it going?
All right.
All right.
I want to tell George I resent that comment about fact-flat people because I'm fat and I'm black.
Can you sing?
Well, no, not really.
Well, there you go.
Say I think George was right.
Excellent job, George.
And then the guy that calls to...
Is it currently the Shah news?
Set it up to Big Bar.
Please.
Well, they're a little bit slow.
869, you're not going to make no thousand, but we can make 900 again today.
Maybe 950, who knows?
Who the hell knows?
And quite frankly, when you come right down to it.
Get the best out of here.
The best out of here.
420, 560, QAM.
I think 4th leader.
Just the one to 2 hour, it's a phenomenon.
All right.
I hear hundreds of songs.
Do the rest of the road.
I've had someone through a pair of the dog walk that train of tow.
Yeah, he's gonna get some rest.
The car will be risen blue.
And he's gonna find his footprints in the best room too.
A psychopathic roommate.
Or the geopie.
A gingerbread and a pepso.
Please, I'm on his knees.
Now they've made his custom fondant.
Oner looks nice and fox-y.
Shins and pacifags and prisons.
Where he can get a bit of shoes.
Now this man takes specializing in distractions and lives.
Still don't know how many stars would be exposed.
Our spies will push no insert lots of.
A turtle has beaten through.
Play a load of his dirty.
He's gonna get a heart of title bumping.
With the car roll risen blue.
He'll get the car roll risen blue.
Oh!
1 o'clock at 560 W.
We got Curtis Stevenson at 2 o'clock.
And we finally found out at 1238.
It's never too late to find out what the schedule is on Q&A.
Nothing you can be damn sure of.
And here what that is about these people.
These lunatics, these maniacs, these grey robbers who are running this place.
No, please say.
They have no shame.
Oh yeah, well.
Or conscience is none.
Zippo.
How are we doing with that delay repeating in the back?
Somebody looking for something.
Yeah, when your engineer shows up to fix it then it will be fixed.
Greg, is that his name?
No, no, I'm not talking about the dump button.
I'm talking about what's on the ear of the repeat.
Oh, that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Excuse me.
WDQYN, hello.
Oh, alright.
I'm voice from the blast from the past.
Well, he's pretty p-oated us since you won't let him on here.
I know, it's all my fault.
That was a George deal, okay?
That's right.
You'd rather have Prozac Ron or that.
What?
That first, is that the question?
Yeah, which one would you like to see in a box first?
Oh, I don't know.
Stangaburrio.
Or Murrio.
Maybe Murrio can take care of him since he's a kind of a threatened kind of a guy.
Hey, a scull in Crossbow.
Or else, or else.
I mean, weren't you kind of taken it back by that fax?
Listen, I'm used to that.
Like you always say, when you do know with crazy people.
That's right.
Look at it.
My, my, my.
Look at it.
Nothing should surprise you.
5, 6, 7.
Let's get this smokein' for this big one or two hour for a final round.
Let's get it all whipped up for Curtis or two.
And then you got Geldy.
Four to seven, three hours of the squeak mice to Ron there.
You know what, Norma Kent said about that last night when I was talking to him when I was a...
Did I open something gay?
No.
He said it's absolutely just incomprehensible that they would bring that back.
But then again, you know, you got along with him, so.
With Goldie?
Yeah.
So you'll kiss his ass, you'll suck up to him.
Okay, because you have no sense of...
Sure, whatever you say.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60, 0, 60 on the variety.
In fact, if Moe came back tomorrow, which wouldn't surprise me, maybe Moe is going to do two to four.
I would welcome him back with...
With open arms and legs.
Yeah, warm handshake.
How about the doctor?
Is that the doctor that performed the surgery?
Yeah.
That one.
2 AM, hello.
No need to panic, no need to worry.
This worry is thing today and all the other polls that are seen that...
That it's getting closer to closing the gap and it's getting closer.
This is all run by the big media.
They need both candidates to keep on spending the money and spending the money.
If Barack Obama was attempting to put the head like he really is,
then they wouldn't spend as much money as their race would be over the media.
Right.
They need to be this post-code, so they're going to skew the polls to make it reflect it like that.
Shout out to Truth.
Oh, is it?
Okay, there's the voice of...
The voice of the reason and the voice of Truth.
That's the same guy that called it to us that the big bopper was white.
I don't know what you didn't say, it was white.
He said he wasn't black.
Maybe it was Chinese.
That's right, yeah.
Ten demon.
QAM, hello.
Coming at ya.
Not.
QAM, hello.
I wish I could move.
QAM, hello.
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
Okay.
Listen, the only crowd that are seeing a cruise has a tunnel.
Thank you.
I know the sound of the mic goes to the gas station and the sound of the sound I love it.
There's something about it.
The other sound that I love and that big cut my balls.
Yeah.
That...what do we call that?
I don't know, what are you calling it?
Let's write this in.
I'm gonna cut my balls.
You know what I'm trying to have.
It's all the old.
You cut my balls.
I don't know what to call it either.
You can get the idea, but we can't say that on the air.
The point got it.
That's my ball.
So I can have same sex with you.
I'm the Alice.
That was the point point point.
Yeah.
I don't know what to call it either.
What is that under?
I don't know.
I don't know if we have that, do we?
That's a book of Brianism.
Uh-oh.
So how's he doing, by the way, is he still starving?
Of course he is.
Now, didn't you just say on Tuesday that you weren't kind of responding?
Well, I looked at I lied.
Why did you say on Tuesday?
You wore me down.
No, I did not.
No?
No.
Maybe you couldn't afford to gas to get there.
That's right.
In today's economy, with today's gas prices, I can afford to drive the work.
Well, maybe they have a studio in your house.
Oh.
And then you wipe it.
Or, every time you color a bitch on here.
Yeah.
I mean, don't you think that's a little bit over the top?
What do you mean?
Calling your wife a bitch?
No, not at all.
Well, if the other things that I could call her that I don't, she was always nice to me.
Sure.
She likes to lots of people.
She likes to me.
Mm-hmm.
She likes Chris.
We had dinner last night.
Me and Chris and the wife and I.
Really?
Sure.
And the wife.
Sure.
This is George.
This is pure vintage George.
The wife, the kid.
That's right.
Dog, the house.
That's right.
Everything is kind of like generic and relatable life.
That's right.
So they can do you know who I'm talking about.
How many QAM Hello?
We all be on the pages.
QAM Hello.
I'm a tattoo.
Sure.
QAM Hello.
I'm a tattoo.
Oh yeah.
That's Chris.
I'm a tattoo.
I have a tattoo.
Oh, Bobma.
I'm a tattoo.
How many QAM Hello?
Hey, Neil.
Yes.
Hey, I'm a tattoo.
Think about Jack's goal.
And I'm going to miss the most is that Jack's often bit.
That's the funniest thing I ever heard.
I think you can play that for me to come on for.
And tell these voices a little bit deeper.
Get out over the age.
Yeah.
Nothing more.
What do you say?
Uh-huh.
Sure it has.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.
One of these days you'll be sorry.
Didn't take your chance today and call in and speak to the world.
Or at least to the 50 or 60 people we have listening.
You can see the tremendous drop off of this appointment
when they heard that Jerks wasn't going to be on.
Right.
Because we had a shot at a thousand votes on the pool now.
Now we're going to press to get to 900 now.
It's only 8.79 Chris.
What's going on with you and that poll yours?
I guess they just don't want to vote right now.
Everybody's back in school.
Kind of a lame, meanly mouth answer was that.
Huh?
Lame and meanly mouth.
Everybody's made it.
Rock performer or group of all time.
The Beatles 107.
Stones 99.
Elvis 52.
Led Zeppelin 48.
Pink Floyd 42.
The Hooth 38.
Jimmy Hendrix 20.
Celia Cruz 25.
All right.
Let's hear it for Celia.
And let's look way down the list and see how Luis Miguel is doing.
Tentations have two.
They've got a pair.
And Luis Miguel still has Solomon Thayuno.
And George is pleased this punch about...
In fact, George is pissed off that he even got one vote.
Because he's a lounge act.
Yes.
WDQA-M, hello.
Hey.
Blacks don't last long.
It's four-stop.
QA-M, hello.
And you...
When you look up in the dictionary, hypocrite, it's got to have the word Republican or a picture of Republicans.
I mean, you listen to Bush telling Russia, you know, not the data sovereign nation.
You hear him tell about...
He's telling Africa to have fair and free elections.
He's got these people telling you you can't have Dave Sexton bathrooms.
You have to know the one's doing it.
I mean, hypocrisy and Republicans are synonymous.
And for Barack not to be blowing him away, hopefully he grows a pair because he needs to start tearing in the McCain a little bit here.
So anyway, that's the point.
It's just depressing.
If McCain was to win, I think it's time for a thought.
I'd leave the country, I'll say that.
Well, it'll fix the immigration problem. That's one thing.
But we'll all be leaving it off for...
Or, say that.
Who do you think wants cheap labor, factory owners, Republicans?
Who do you know?
That's all that's going to be left.
Well, Luke Dobbs will take care of his ass.
You'll see. That fat-headed Luke Dobbs would have big mouth.
The middle class, the poor middle class, and the...
The legals and the... the border is a same old crap.
Just a pompous fat ass, Luke.
There's another one that you gravitated to.
I hope no one here. He's your hero?
That's because you don't like Mexicans.
They'll hit it like illegals.
Let me see QYM, hello.
Neil? Yes, sir.
Yeah, when George Bush was running, everybody said...
If he wins, we should leave the country and you're still in Canada.
Yeah.
Hey, we go, are we in Canada?
Are we going, are we in Canada?
Who do you think you are? Hello.
Tom, in the back?
QYM, hello.
Thank you.
Hello.
Oh, how's the hopper doing, by the way?
How's he doing, what?
Surviving, right?
How's he staying alive?
I know what I see him, later tonight.
Yeah, what, what, so he's doing the ESPN stuff.
Once in a while, he's under with some horse racing crap, and what else?
Don't know.
In other words, you're not having dinners with the hopper?
I've been on the air since before.
I've been on the air since before.
Do all you fat gays anything out together?
Yeah, they do, actually.
Oh, I apologize.
You know, you may think that paycheck you got now is pretty small.
I don't know what it is, I don't think so.
When it's all got all zeroes in it, kind of like there are a number at night here on QYM.
Oh, like that.
Then you can't even afford gas to go looking for another job.
WDQYM, hello.
I'm on it.
Yes.
Sorry, I just drew my radio.
I gotta go to the American Express.
Thanks.
WDQYM, hello.
I'll be on it, too.
QYM, hello.
Man, I should be a little cracked.
It's always like country water.
Man, I should be a little cracked.
As far as I can see, man, I should be a little cracked.
I'll trade some for my daughter.
This name is the best tower ever.
You'll be able to live there.
Fortly at 5.50 QYM.
I'll be forced later.
The economy is shrinking.
Winter.
Light a fire.
But I couldn't afford the matches.
Cossession.
Don't say it.
She'd cover her ears, but could still hear his voice.
Recession.
Let's go back to Morocco.
I can't.
I have a-
You have us.
Prime.
Organt.
Recession.
She took it all.
My house.
My car.
Recession.
My heart.
You could never afford me.
She never said why, but I knew.
I have to let you go.
Recession.
She had a black heart.
And a pink slip.
Recession.
It's not a word.
It's a feeling.
Recession.
The new fragrance from Galvan climb.
Recession.
Available big locks.
Okay, we'll be right over.
On 16 at 5.60 WDQM, we got 44 minutes to go.
But who's counting, right?
We got 890 votes on the poll.
You got 900 licked.
Pretty weak, though.
Yeah.
So anyway.
Yes?
Make us rumor.
All programming rumor?
Indeed.
And we'll have to wait to see Barry Jackson's column to confirm this, because obviously nobody's
going to tell us anything.
Oh, some of them are back up to their old tricks again.
They tell Barry Jackass what's going on internally.
But the people are working to slave.
What's your theory about that?
Deal with the devil or naked pictures.
Go ahead.
That he's fired.
Jackson's fired.
As of yesterday.
Or let go or not renewed or invited not to come back.
Or however you fumiz and we're using these days.
Fire did it?
That's a rumor.
It's just a rumor based on absolutely nothing but, you know.
Oh, who's starting it?
Who do you hear that from?
Oh, nobody.
I don't give up my sources.
You might, but I don't.
I know.
That's why I asked.
Because you always get so excited.
I made it up.
I made it up.
I pulled it out of my heart.
The church has been cast.
Well, Barry, I'll have his Friday column tomorrow morning in a hero.
That's right.
So anytime we need to find out what the programming decisions are, QA, we've buried Jack
As in the hero since he's in the pocket of the guys across the street.
That's what really creates me.
It makes a lot of sense.
Every time when the book comes out no matter what it is, Barry, you know, he tried to make a case for said the kid in the morning and the audio, the audio.
You know, he's a shill for the ticket.
Took it.
And this clown that we got in management now, he hasn't learned lessons.
And it was one thing when Greg Reed was doing it.
And even he finally learned he would stop talking to Barry.
Hey, Barry, you're Barry.
Maybe Barry will call in the star again.
You know, we all have a doubted.
I doubt it.
There's information on that competing source of media.
Oh, that's right.
Competing for advertisers dollars that we compete with.
Well, isn't that a fine kettle of fish?
And so that's the first part of the puzzle.
And the second part is who's going to be doing two to four, Geltie?
Starting on Monday.
See, and that's the thing you did across over with him yesterday.
Now they fired your ex yesterday.
Geltie certainly knew if he's going to be doing two to four.
Or not.
Right, or not.
And because you have a job that doesn't mean they're going to tell you that either.
Well, I mean, they're going to have to come to some kind of agreement dollars and send something.
You think that?
No?
Eventually, probably.
QAM, hello.
I'll do two to four.
QAM, hello.
Nail.
Yes.
Hey, I thought I was hilarious when you told the investigator guy to stick his head up his rectum and investigate his ass.
Anyway, this is Tony Shark again, calling your show.
And I asked you if you wanted to hear my mind space or you know, get my address and you said, though.
No.
No.
And I heard you the other day talking about some guy I called and you were like, you smirk.
Why didn't you buy some spots or something like that?
Yeah.
So I was wondering what you were about.
How you go about buying spots?
Oh, in this station, we don't sell any.
You can take like a pen or magic marker and make some spots like like a clown.
Sure.
On your forehead, on your nose, like that.
Look like you had leprosy.
QAM, hello.
Oh, get that whole thing in there, man.
I'm getting used to it.
I'm starting to get excited hearing it.
It's like a complete separation, you know what I mean?
56670560, pound 560 on the Verizon singular wireless line.
WDQAM, hello.
Hey, Nail, how you doing?
Can you tell me a favor?
Nail?
What?
And you gotta get rid of George.
No.
I hate his guts.
Well, too bad.
He hates you, George.
Yeah.
Like a poison.
Old Yorker.
Show up somewhere.
Yeah, go back to New York or if you go back to the Bronx with Mario.
No, that was quite an experience today.
I mean, it was just a little silly.
He was like, falling off a log.
Cars 1995, though.
Well worth it.
Well worth it at 10 times the price, Mario, Marino, in Hylia.
I could give you the address too, but I'll...
Well, yeah, the Eddie was listening to that, Marino.
No, he's...
Can the...
Rita, Marino.
I wish he used to be on...
Pyramid all the time, Rita, Marino.
She was in fame.
Don't you remember Rita, Marino?
Hmm?
Yeah, of course.
I'm reading something.
Q-A-N.
Ricky Martin's a real man.
Q-A-N, hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Is this Q-A-N?
Well, what did I say when I answered the phone?
I said Q-A-N.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You didn't hear you.
Yeah.
Q-A-N.
Yeah, my name is Dan.
I want to talk to George.
Well, I talked to George.
George isn't doing the show today.
I'll go to the show today.
George, I hear you left.
Okay, thanks.
Well, you want to talk to George about?
That is rich wife.
Why, you interested?
Of course.
It's all it takes.
Q-A-N.
Hey, Uncle Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, I'm just tuning in a little late here,
and I heard you said that they fired jerks.
That's what George said.
He said that's the rumor around the station.
Can you elaborate on that and tell us the dirty details?
Let me just get you saying to you,
that the rumour around the station
that he was fired yesterday.
Well, make sure you have a few more tours.
How do we have any details dirty or clean
or sanitary or otherwise?
Out of that.
Out of that.
Yeah.
He won't be come at you.
How about that?
You know, that sounds like guilty.
Come on, that's it.
No, how about that sounds like guilty.
Well, trust me, it was him.
Play it again.
How about that?
Isn't it?
It's a little bit, but it never works.
Wow, man, I haven't been to witness this trip.
It's morphed into guilty.
Maybe they met on the, on the,
probably, they're just back and forth across the street.
And maybe they kind of like knelt it into each other.
So to speak.
72 A.M. Hello.
2 A.M. Ola.
Hey, Ola, are you, are you a fan of the Jonah Brothers?
So what?
The Janet Brothers.
The John is a brother.
I'm a John is a brother.
I'm a John is a brother.
What, what are the Jonah's brothers?
Butch are born again Christian, Twinkie brothers.
Oh, yeah.
How little girls like that.
Probably like a little girl like them.
Oh, good.
I'll pass.
I doubt it.
I'm not into the Jesus Christers.
Sorry.
But that guy evidently is.
So enjoy.
WDQA M. Hello.
What's going to happen to the lab with my air now at 2 o'clock?
WDQA M. Hello.
QA M. Ola.
Hello.
3 in a row.
Can we make it 4? QA M. Hello.
I'm Jason Jackson.
I got some yard work on my house.
I need to get on the call.
Okay, great.
That's it.
Stir up the racial crap now.
Okay, that's the best you can do.
Racial crap.
That's why Obama's not to run under when the polls.
Racist bastards man.
It's all they know.
Wow, darky, darky, darky, blacky, blacky, blacky, blacky,
you know, 899 on the poll, Chris.
We're about to go for greatness here.
All right.
900. Well, it's not that good.
We had a pretty good survey out there.
I think we had like, what do we have?
Like 850 when we started this morning?
I don't know.
We had a lot.
We had 670 I think.
And now we're going to got like 900.
That's pretty weak.
When you consider the level of sophistication of this show today?
Oh, and the red button's on again.
Red buttons that rely on you to get a stupid call.
He died.
Oh, hi, hi.
Oh, am I going to get a stupid call?
Let's see.
QA M. Hello.
QA M.
Yeah, Daniel.
Daniel, I think I used to spend George the one, Daniel.
He's a television.
I just got to get one.
The best talents.
The best talents.
The strongest neurologist.
Fortnightly at 5.65 a.m.
The sports leader.
And they cheese.
Good morning, Americans.
It's Paul Harvey.
Standby for News.
A doctor, a lawyer, a little boy, and a priest
were out for a Sunday afternoon flight
on a small private plane.
Suddenly the plane developed engine trouble. In spite of the best efforts of the pilot, the plane began to go down.
Finally the pilot grabbed a parachute yell to the passengers that they had better do the same and bailed out.
Unfortunately there were only, you guessed it, three, parachutes remaining.
The doctor grabbed one and said, I'm a doctor, I saved lives so I must live and he jumped out.
The lawyer then said, I'm a lawyer and lawyers are the smartest people in the world I deserve to live. He also grabbed a parachute and jumped.
The priest looked at the little boy and said, my son, I have lived a long and full life.
You are young and have your whole life ahead of you take the last parachute and live in peace.
The little boy handed the parachute back to the priest and said, not to worry father, the smartest man in the world just jumped out of the plane with my backpack, Paul Harvey.
Good day.
Well that's an oldie ain't it?
It sure was. It sure was. But it still has got us moments.
Not too many of them. 138-560 WD-3 and we got 905 votes on the hill. Let's hear it.
Alright.
Beatles are winning in the stones. It's close. It's an economic moment to know. She's down to pike. WD-Q-I-M, hello.
Where's my uncle Neil?
Yeah. What can we do for you sir?
Ah, just want to comment on the Obama and panel situation.
Yeah.
You know it. And I hope I still found it and break it up. Is it?
No.
Okay good.
All of us.
The one of the stories that was popular, the other thing it was, was I like the Kenny.
And we feel like we have to say high, special stuff.
Anyway, we'll just talk and show up. What do you think about that?
Okay. Getting new phones. Not breaking up. It just sounds like crap.
Right? So it wasn't breaking up. It just is muffled and ruthless or modulated.
Ooh. Horrible.
Let me just bad phone technique. And we didn't even get to hear click. Don't.
And that beat beat, whatever that sound is.
See where I tell chicken heck I got to have that sound.
We'll do.
If he wants to check. Is he starving?
Yes.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the evil rising singular wireless line WQ-I-M, hello.
I have a pair of bicycles in my rectum so I can view the poly.
Now that's, I like that.
It's about time you shove something useful up there, okay?
I had everything but the kitchen sick in there in the last couple of months.
But that way you can, a lot of cost a lot of money to go for a colonoscopy.
Does it right?
I don't know.
Oh, a few years ago. Don't you remember when I went and had the both ends?
The end of the hospital.
It was five grand.
We, oh.
For both ends.
Yeah, because I'm going to have to have one of these days.
I could have got some bifocals and stuck them up in there and just checked it out for myself.
Five grand.
Five big ones.
Count them.
WQ-I-M, hello.
Nail?
Yes.
How are you?
Okay.
Nail, how come you're gay?
Here's the good sound.
Say we do.
How come you're gay?
Because I want to.
Okay, because I want to.
WQ-I-M, hello.
Don't call me JJ.
History.
Let's hear it for jerks.
Of course, that's just a rumor now.
Right.
Around the building.
Now maybe some Ojohn provocateur looking to start a bunch of trouble.
Maybe they started that.
You know, I don't think so, though.
In fact, as soon as you told me that he thought he was going to be on on Monday and they told him don't come in.
Isn't that generally a pretty good sign that the go-don't come back?
Yeah, it's not a good omit at all.
Don't let the door hitch in the ass on the way out.
Of course, who hired him?
I mean, I could be wrong, but it seems to me that Joe Bell hired him.
Joe Bell hired the Kenny and Low Morning Show.
He invented it.
Who hired DA with his point at night?
Oh!
If you can't be good at least be consistent.
That's what Fed asked Jolly Joe was.
Consistently bad.
WQ-I-M, hello.
George.
Yeah.
Hey, buddy.
Is he also wrong the radio?
Well, let me ask you something.
Are you listening to the radio?
Yeah, well, let me have a let me say something.
Who does it sound like you're talking to?
Do I sound like Joe?
I think it's like a computerized guy.
The my understanding was, I left five years ago to sound like.
And the only reason I'm back is because I didn't take my bill.
So, but it's you.
I mean, five years later I come back and it's like the same topic.
Yeah.
And I'm like, what's the topic?
What's the topic?
I don't know.
You never have a topic.
You always have a, you always have a count, a list or...
And I think it's computerized.
It's a little understanding you might have, I don't know, is Neil Dider?
Yeah, Neil Dider has a nice computer.
Yeah, well, let me make a suggestion to you, sir.
Take your satellite and stick it up your ass.
That's my suggestion.
Hopefully it's one of those big satellites.
I remember I used to have one of those in the back yard.
One of those big, what are they?
12 footer?
Whatever.
And then they stopped putting like all the free programming on there.
And then they started the charging air for everything.
And then we got the small dish.
I wonder how much Hammond's doing.
You think he's still alive?
Maybe.
The five six sevens were probably lean low with a name like that.
Five six seven, oh five sixty, pound five sixty on the Verizon singular wireless line.
Only 25 minutes to kill here today.
And then of course it's all in Georgia's hands tomorrow.
And then this guy, he's calling a radio show and he's so much of a deadbeat,
he can't afford to pay a satellite bill.
Send a bill to Georgia, he'll take care of it.
QAM, hello.
If I get fine, I hope it's during the commercial.
QAM, hello.
Uncle Neil.
Yes, sir.
I have a question for you, please.
Yes.
I haven't been able to listen to you.
The last couple of years my partner got me started listening to you.
I love your show.
But I want to know if you on other radio stations out of markets,
if your callers were more intelligent or if it's just the South Florida thing,
because each people of the call are just idiots.
Yeah, that's South Florida for you, man.
I mean, is you having television callers on other stations?
Yeah.
Man, I said I used to have real callers and then I came to QAM.
I feel bad for you, man.
I really do.
Why is that?
Well, it's just, you know, you're doing a talk show and you're taking calls
and these people are just stupid.
They get on the phone and they make stupid sounds and hang up.
It's like nobody calls with anything real.
Well, that's the show.
Neil talks to idiots for four hours every day.
That's right.
And gets paid a lot of money for doing it.
I was going to say that.
I hope they are paying you a lot.
Really sure are.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you so much.
And then January, of course, we go in that big cos-cutting thing of Johnny Joe Bell.
He's going to show the beesleaves in the world what a brilliant businessman he is.
And of course, how much more brilliant can you be
than to put show after show after show on the air that fail?
Right.
Is that brilliant or what?
That's what they've done.
And like you've always said, if he likes it, it'll fail.
It's going to suck and it's going to fail.
Right.
In that order.
Oh, I see.
If Joe Bell likes the show, it's going to suck and it's going to fail.
And of course, he used to like this show too, so he claimed when he first came here.
Yeah, I don't believe that.
He certainly just, you know, changed it a lot.
Yeah.
So how could he like it?
Well, he wants it to suck and he wants it to fail.
And up until this last book, we done a hell of a job of that.
What's the biggest name of the best talent here?
This is a Roger's 435.
62 AM.
This is fourth leader.
God.
Just to prove that she's a man, alienary pusher.
It's obvious who wears a pants.
This is so-so-hoesha.
It's not what you're used to.
The law says it's okay for them to say I do.
In California, she might be the scum she liked it.
Just to cover all things, Gage, she might be the girl she took tight it.
And got a little like him.
It will be on entertainment tonight.
And just to give it to let me enjoy my celebrity girl she liked it.
She liked it.
Well, good for her.
I don't see anything very, you know what I'm saying?
Whirlin.
Pasty looking dyke.
I mean, what is her talent?
What does she bring to the-
What does she have to bring to the-
What does she have to bring to the-
What does she have to bring to the-
Is that it?
I think that's it.
Sensable shoes.
Where's pants?
Yeah.
Sweatery where's pants, dude.
I know.
Speak volumes.
I mean, she's making a fortune.
56670560.560.
I'm the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.
WDQAM, hello.
Hola.
Hola.
Yes, sir.
I want to speak to the guys.
Speaking.
Yeah, I want to-
I mean, make suggestions like, you know, I have questions.
Yeah, go ahead.
What's the question?
Come on.
Let me-
Let me say it again.
Stop listening to the radio to hear the sound of your own voice, okay?
We're on a 75-hour delay.
Much a question.
Yeah.
What's the question?
See, you can do it.
He wants to hear the sound of his voice.
Choke.
WDQAM, hello.
Hello, Jack Ronchau.
QAM, hello.
Yeah, you know what?
Ignore all these holes until after Barack destroys that old fool in the debates, okay?
Yeah, okay.
Because once that better change everything around it, if we don't see the numbers come around then-
Then really, I'll commit suicide, I think.
I guess I'm saving up some pills right now.
Okay.
All right.
Save some for us.
Yeah.
Save some for jerks, too.
No jerks.
That's the rumor.
That's the big story.
Now, what's Curtis going to say when he comes on to today?
Is he also going to like hide the truth?
I'm sure- I mean, we haven't been told.
I'm sure he hasn't been told, right?
What do you mean he hasn't been told?
He's going to be on the air in 15 minutes.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, they probably said, oh, you're filling in today.
Filling in my ass.
Good God, I'll get to cement.
I'll get to see that mixer.
Oh, my God.
Are you smitten me?
I mean, how long does this game continue?
It's going to be in the day.
Well, I guess they can continue one more day.
Now, who's going to be on tomorrow?
And ODA.
He's already a pencil in from 2 to 4.
I don't know if this whole thing has been handled.
So it's been butchered and mishandled so badly,
just like you'd expect from this crowd.
The wrecking crew.
You know, we used to have that thing the QA morning wrecking crew,
which I played the other day.
We've got the QA-M 24-hour wrecking crew.
The three J's, Josh, Joyce, and Joe.
The QA-M freaking wrecking crew.
I'm going to start swearing on you any second.
You swear I read buttons back on again.
So what's the story?
Why are they going to send the Greg to come and posky around with it?
Apparently they called them, so they're just waiting for him to go to your place.
WQA-M, hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I'd like to know one question.
Do you find Hank Goldberg attractive?
Yeah, he's lovely.
Yeah, he's lovely.
I've got the hots for the Humper.
Doesn't everybody want to hump the Humper?
Let's see, that last wreck is 345.
I'm looking at that.
There's a 15-second spot in there.
Yep.
How do you like that?
A 15-second spot.
When are we going to get the fun?
Then we have at 1.5s.
Or did I dream that?
Maybe when you had the work parts in.
No, I'm serious.
They tried to speed 510.
No, 510.
Yeah, I remember 10s that I went to.
Yeah, we had 10s.
Real men's, listen to 10s.
WQA-M, hello.
Neil, I just wanted to ask you, what part do they have against Curtis?
If they just don't give them that 2-4 slide.
What do they have against him?
He's probably not one of them.
You want an answer?
You just want to keep them babbling.
He's probably not.
Am I?
He's like you.
He just wants to keep interrupting.
What?
He just wants to hear the sound of his own voice.
He didn't want an answer.
I was going to say that Curtis isn't one of Curtis's bunk-butt buddies.
Like, all the people.
All of them, who knows?
Maybe they will get Curtis 2-4.
You never know.
He was on Monday 2-4.
I think he was on Monday and he's going to be on today.
Curtis is a fine job.
He's like a good guy.
He's no jerks.
And he's certainly no joke.
Thank God.
And what is that going to do with the Mad Dog show?
I don't know.
I think there would be an improvement.
I think there are complaints we've had about Mandage's show.
Over the last couple of years, he's been with Curtis on that show.
Curtis should have his own show.
And he does today from 2-4 anyway for 2 hours.
WDQA Am Hello.
Poops and heat.
Poops and heat.
No more hoops and no more heats.
And no more shacks.
WDQA Am Hello.
Yeah.
J.J. is going to be doing a butt.
What do you think about that?
What do I think about that?
I think you are moron.
That's what I think about that.
No, I'm not.
You sure sound like a jackass.
Why are you so mean to call her that?
You're calling idiots.
You're moron.
I'm just like you. That's why.
I give them what they deserve.
If they're like irrational, I'll be rational.
If they're mouth-breathing idiots like you.
If they're like...
Brackdom.
Holes like you.
Then they'll get treated like a real...
Brackdom.
Winston tastes good.
Weinstein tastes good like a cigarette should.
And that freaking J.Lieberman, man,
boy does he get me just my blood boils when I see him.
Makes me want to just...
Kaka.
You still there?
Right here.
Kaka.
Actually, you call me a bit stretch.
Yeah, good.
Oh, I stretched this.
That...
560, 560, 560.
I never rise in singular wireless line.
WDQA Am hello.
EO, I supported you.
I supported center one.
I bought your tape.
I bought the keychain.
I got a client.
Yeah. And you send me death threats on the fax machine, right?
I'm part of the show, sir.
Oh, you're part of the show, sir.
Well, guess what? You're going to be in for a real show
when they disconnect your phone, sir.
You're part of the show, sir.
That he sends me death threats.
And he knows the unmentioned one.
And you better do this and you better do that.
I guess he's getting lonely now.
Mary El Moreno.
At 305, 883, 8538.
How do you like that?
That he had the clips better call back.
Oh, well, you know, there's no cure for insanity.
In case you didn't know that.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Maybe like with Jack Nicholson and the Achief.
Sure.
Or for head.
Or for head.
Well, let's give it a shot.
WQA and Hello.
Captain and to Neil.
Yes?
You got a question for you.
Yes, sir.
How bad do you think the Buffalo Favors are going to disgrace the Toronto Maple?
WQA and Hello.
I'm just going to do some injection, telling them what a minute is on.
What it won?
QA.
QA.
Yes.
How much?
Neil.
Yes.
What the hell do you got to get him, Jacks?
He sucks.
He sucks.
I mean, you can mess with the Buffalo Favors.
He sucks.
Or a sucked.
I'm sorry.
Past tense.
He's done.
Now, wouldn't you have, well, you're going to have egg on your push next week if he shows up on Monday morning.
Or Monday afternoon.
All right.
Well, you're all right.
Well, yeah, you're the one that started that day where you said the rumors around the building.
What?
I told you that on Tuesday.
I told you that.
You want that he will not be back on.
I mean, anybody, even a blind man could have seen, even Stevie Wonder could have seen the handwriting on the wall with that deal.
Because instead of doing it like a bench, Joe Bell has to do this, go through this long, convoluted song of dance,
and Joe dies on one day, and Curtis is on another day, and we're not talking.
And very Jackass will tell you tomorrow morning in the hill, our arch enemy, very Jackass,
whom Joe confides in, it's incredible.
It's unspeakable.
Here is somebody, here's a Pucks, the couch potato over there in a herald, who's just hellbent on doing everything he can to stick it to us because they've got that insistered relationship between the herald and the stickets of the ticket, and he still confides in him.
You want to know what's going on programming wise, the QAM?
Read Barry Jackass in a herald.
And that's probably because it's the only person in the media who will speak to him.
And Jika hates Joe Bell like poison, like poison.
Of course, the fact that Joe hung a slander phone down hung up on him, I mean, maybe that had something to do with it, I don't know.
You think?
Could be.
The greatest rock performer or group of all time, the Beatles 113, The Stones 98,
1155, Led Zeppelin 52, Pink Floyd 44.
I'm looking way down the list to see if I can find Luis Miguel.
One, Solomon Teuno, and Celia Cruz, 25.
She's right tied with Queen.
Rock in the house.
She's rockin' out when you think of Freddie Mercury and Queen. Don't you think of Celia Cruz?
A lot of similar areas there.
She was sort of the queen of her genre, right? They're both dead.
They've got Curtis coming up for jerks right after the break.
And let me tell you right now, all the truth is going to come skewing out of you.
You'll see the break behind Mr. Bell.
The truth is that he'll not have sport with you.
You'll 5.50 QAM.
And the sports leader.
Not no more. It's day.
If I have a town at 5.60 WQM.
Don't lie. All the hard burn.
