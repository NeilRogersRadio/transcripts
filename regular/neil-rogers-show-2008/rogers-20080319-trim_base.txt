You're listening to sports radio 560 WAM
I am a for the other day. We'll find yourself a real job opinion wherever you are.
No. No.
No.
New York Governor, Elliott Spitzer, blamed to a major constitution ring.
You used your tongue pretty or in a twenty dollar order.
A whole good time. I bet a time can I guess it's right for only a fool?
Five thousand dollar pull.
I'm getting my money to work.
I'm just a saturn with that.
Happy anniversary to us.
Five years in Iraq.
Aren't you excited about that? Let's have a party.
Let's have the party.
Some party favors and balloons.
See, I know the media doesn't understand this because the media are perfect.
You know, Hanky's right.
Guys just want to get laid.
Yeah.
Important guys, unimportant guys, rich guys, poor guys.
I'm going to play the new sounder if I need to be bringing stories like that.
Guys just want to get laid.
Dead guy.
This is the dead guy for you.
I have a addiction from Hogan Zero's.
I'm surprised you knew who that was.
Love Hogan Zero's.
I was hoping to catch your own guard.
Actor, director and producer Ivan Dixon best known for his role as Kinshlo.
In the television series, Hogan Zero was dying in Charlotte at the age of 76.
I didn't watch that show.
I hated that show.
That perfect sentence.
Marked that, would you, Chris?
Okay.
What?
It was a funny show.
So if you hated it, you didn't watch it.
See?
That all makes sense now.
It was a very funny show.
Like the Beverly Hill Village that you did watch.
I hated it.
I hated both of those.
I don't know.
I know.
You watched Leave It To Beaver.
The wife's been watching that.
The most unfunny, drôle, nothing happening show in the distance that you've been running.
I know.
I know.
But the Beverly Hill Village that was funny and ripped into everything you did.
I like that.
I can drill.
Dixon's guys, Sunday at Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte.
After suffering a hemorrhage in from complications from kidney failure to this daughter,
Dixon of Charlotte.
Actor Sidney Potta said the two men became friends after Dixon was his stuffed double in the
58 movie The Defiant Ones.
As an actor, you had to be careful, Potta said in the statement he was quite likely to walk
off with a scene.
Dixon began his acting career on Broadway and plays that included the Caved Wellers and
a Raisin in the Sun.
On Filmy Appearance on something of value or Raisin in the Sun, a pack of blue, nothing but
a man and the cult favorite, Car Wash.
But it was probably best known for the role of U.S. staffs.
In the film, the director of the film, Charles James Kinchel, on Hogan's heroes, Kinchelah,
who's in charge of electronic communications, can mimic German officers on the radio or
phone, it said.
While her father was most, uh, boy, this doesn't make any sense at all, worked mostly in
play such as Raisin in the Sun and for films such as Nothing but a Man, he had no mixed feelings
about being recognized for the role of Kinchelah's daughter, said it was a pivotal role as well,
because there were as many blacks in TV series at the time, she said.
He didn't have some personal issues with that role, but also launched him in a directing.
He earned an Emmy nomination for his performance in the CBS Playhouse Special, the final war of
Oli Winter.
Let's get an Oli burger, what are you saying?
A bloodlet out.
In addition to acting on TV, he also directed hundreds of episodes, it shows including The Walten,
The Rockford Files, Magnum P.U. and In A He To The Night.
That's another bad show, Magnum P.U.
Oh my God.
It was very, very gay.
Was it?
Well Tom Selleck was in it, and then of course that was the, uh, Butler's name.
Uh, I don't know, Jeaves.
No, it was not Jeaves.
Come on, you can do better than that.
I didn't watch that show, you think I watched that show?
Copy that, I hope not.
Detective show.
Here's the poll from yesterday.
Who do you think will be our next present?
We didn't even do a thousand votes total on that poll.
What's that all about?
Chris?
Uh, Higgins.
That's it.
Higgins was the name of that, uh, Fag.
I mean, uh, Butler.
Who do you think will be the next present?
955 votes is all we have.
That's lame.
Barack Obama 403, John McCain 264,
Swiller 188, don't know 118 and don't care 42.
Don't care, I just want to get laid.
That's what guys want.
Yeah.
They want to get laid and they want something, uh, new decided.
That's a good poll question.
How many times can you screw somebody before you get tired of them
and you want somebody new, you know, three?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Oh, fill out your brackets for the big tournament now.
That's coming up.
I'm off on Friday.
I can't believe that.
That's some of the best news I've had in a long, long time.
And George is going to be off next Monday, right?

It's one of those things, you know, right?
Don't do the spots there out of business.
Oh my god.
I still, I still can't.
There are a couple of things that have happened last two days that I just can't believe.
It just goes to show you.
Yeah.
You wait and watch it up.
It's something that'll happen.
Just when you think you know something and you realize how stupid you are.
There's a cigar machine.
Oh, speaking of stupid.
There he is.
You're a fearless leader, man.
And there's that stubborn 20% or whatever it is 25%.
Oh no, we think the person is doing a wonderful job.
Hohohoho.
Yeah.
Oh, it's just scary look at it.
Man, it just brings terror.
That's the war on terror.
Thank you for the great economy and the worthless dollar and the, uh,
the cheap gas and all these other things, man.
And all that did people too.
Forget about that.
Here's today's pool.
We got 588 votes on it.
This is from the Palm Beach Trouble Maker.
I thought it was pretty good.
It was okay.
Yes.
The most important lesson I've learned over the years from the Elijah Show is religion is
for crazy people, 214.
For crazy and tolerant, hateful people.
I should have been any surprised that Obama's pastor is a crazy person.
Full of hate and spewing and all that other crap.
Why is that such a big deal?
Which one is it?
You know a harm.
91.
Well, it's not even close.
Religions for crazy people.
One's hands down your pants.
Especially if you're Catholic.
Do know a harm 91?
Just shut up and cast a cheque, 89.
Don't get into radio, 75.
Sugar is the worst drug in the world.
50.
That's true.
It's addictive, man.
I don't care what you say.
Sugar is addictive.
Anybody who tells you that, in fact, we find carbohydrates are addictive.
Not just sugar, but like, um, potato chips and, you know,
you can't eat only one bag.
Like, you can't eat only one.
One of those things come in cheater.
Cringles, you know.
Body wash isn't gay, 36.
And don't be a sport hole, 33.
That's in last place.
588.
Don't be a sport hole.
You can be an A-hole, but don't be a sport hole.
Well, after five long years, the Iraq Wars, the tool mounts, is Capitol Hill blue.
I got a good dog Thompson article column a little later on, too, as a matter of fact.
I got some crap.
George had some crap, but he got rid of it.
Don't do that spot there out of business.
I just sit here, I shake my head.
I wonder, you know, what it's all about.
Don't you wonder what it's all about?
Nope.
I know what it's all about.
Crack, shlock.
Mm-hmm.
Capitol Blue says, as America marks five long grizzly years of war waste, fraud, and abuse in the
Iraq, President George W. Bush plans to claim success, and say the war must go on while
demonstrate his protest and his Democratic opponents say it's time to admit failure
and bring the troops home.
Shaddam Hussein, no.
Not since Vietnam has the war so divided this nation, and today's observance is
marker conflict that have lasted half the length of Vietnam, and longer than WWII, but
it's cost-a-nation far more in political damage and lost prestige in morale.
While American deaths have any at-reach the level of Vietnam, the tool is approaching
4,000 and thousands upon thousands of Iraqi civilians have died.
Poll show most Americans feel the words of failure on Capitol Hill opponents called Bush's
invasion the most monumental foreign policy blunder in American history.
While Bush squanders away money, American lives in this nation's prestige in Iraq, the
nation's economy plunges into recession amid a housing and banking crisis that some
sacred trigger a depression.
Democratic presidential contender Swirli Clinton spoke about the war Monday, but she's
settled by the fact that she voted along with most of her Senate colleagues to give
Bush the authority to invade Iraq.
Democratic frontrunner Barack Obama is expected to speak out more forcefully against the
war today of the remaining Democratic and Republican presidential contenders, only John
McCain continues to support the war without question.
It'll be a sad and interesting day.
Associated press reports that five years after launching the U.S. invasion of Iraq,
President Bush is making some of his most expansive claims of success in the fighting
bear.
Bush said last year, a troop bill of up his turn to macaroni produced the first large
scale Arab uprising against the Samu Yomama bin Laden.
Massive any word demonstrations were planned to don't on Washington, marked today's
anniversary of the war, which has claimed the lives in really 4,000 U.S. troops across
the river of the Pentagon.
Bush was to give a speech which he's doing right now to warn that backsliding in recent
progress fueled by the increase of 30,000 troops, yearning more than a year ago, cannot
be allowed.
The challenge in the period ahead is to consolidate the gains we've made in sealing extremist
defeat.
He says, and it's served from the White House release last night that he's mopping
right now.
We've learned through how to experience what happens when we pull our forces back too
fast, the terrorists and extremists step in, fill the vacuum, establish save havens,
use them to spread chaos, and carnage.
Democrats took a different view.
Representative John Dingell of Michigan said on this grim milestone, it's worth remembering
how we got into this situation and thinking about how we can best get out.
The task that remain in Iraq to bring an endosectarian conflict to devise a way to share political
power and to create a functioning government that's capable of providing for leads of the
Iraqi people are tasked that only the Iraqis can complete.
In other words, let's get to hell out.
While we still got a few people alive, okay, let's get them to hell out.
That's not all this grandstanding.
McCain shows up over there and this one shows up and that one shows up.
It's just, and there was Julie Bremen had a correct McCain.
Do you see that?
He had a whisper in his ear like, yeah.
He had a full of crap, John, you're seeing Alan Fuller-Malkerus.
When it comes to being full of crap, Julie Bremen, he knows what that's all about.
He has great expertise on that.
I think he probably had tied the to filling around his neck too tight, don't you?
Indeed.
609 on the pole.
What do you want for today?
Chris 750, something like that?
800,000.
Somebody, 150,000 votes on the pole and they were never coming back.
12 minutes after 10 to 5.
60, everybody, cue them.
Don't forget no restaurant deal for us tomorrow.
We're taking a week off because, well.
We're taking a week off.
We're taking a week off.
We're taking a week off.
We're taking a week off.
It seems that only Idaho's living Idaho like their senator.
I'm Larry Craig and Marijuana is a gateway drug.
That is to say, a great way drug.
Don Wells is not gay, but he was a very naughty girl.
A very naughty girl.
Most dwellers say she helped them get through puberty.
Not me.
I had the hotspots of professor myself.
No, she was filthy.
I must assume my penalistic stance.
Hello there.
Aha.
What the hell was that?
Wow, talking about followed-up bouncing balls.
I'm trying to figure that one out.
10, 18, and 5, 60, WDQA.
But we're having a spastic response rate of humongous response
on our website yesterday.
And today it's like, they all went away.
I don't understand it.
They're strange.
Lately, they're really strange.
Here's our schedule for today.
Speaking of strange, we got the, we're not waiting a minute.
Yeah.
We got the jerk show from 2 to 4, but then I see we got the DA show
from 4 to 7.
Where's Mr. Maddog?
Taking it out, I think.
Wow.
Well, one thing about the DA man, he's getting all the time slots.
That's good.
Dolphins all asses from 7 to 9, and then we got John Linder
doing the DA show from 9 to midnight.
He'll be there.
He will not be out sick.
I'm sure.
Like the beast who's on the verge, somebody got a big piano case?
Anybody out there who's got a big piano case?
We might run a buy-for.
I have a big celebration of the beast's death soon.
Might as well have a celebration.
There's no point in having a wake and getting more bitten and depressed, right?
Right.
And we can just write on there on the side of the piano case.
He ate himself to death.
I guess that Boba Ghanusha is what put him over the edge.
He would, the shirt had done it for me.
Remember those days?
Sure.
Boba Ghanusha.
So during that last break, the maid cub, I didn't know who was.
There's a knocking on my door, and I couldn't imagine who the hell it might be.
So I had a throw on my walking shorts and my shirt, and opened the door,
and there's the maid there, which is Wednesday.
It's a wood buying Wednesday because it's maid day.
And all we're having a big meeting today, it would be okay.
And I said, just see you next week.
Get out of here, bitch.
And she's okay.
We'll send you back to whatever banana republic you came from, honey.
I'll be, well, I don't want to say that.
That they're all like illegal aliens or whatever.
I said unusual.
I guess not.
No, no, it's standard.
Is that standard way it works?
No, I don't know that for a fact, but I just assumed so.
623 votes on a full day.
Now, I think we can make eight, I don't know.
8, 9, 10 votes.
Stop that million dollar check.
It's turned out, I can't read this right, I'm through tongue-tied.
It turns out to call girl, linked to Elliot Spitzer, but already shatter clothes for girls gone wild
as an 18-year-old while parting in Miami.
The video company's founder said yesterday, how do you like that?
All right.
Who are we talking about?
Ashley Dupre.
Okay.
Joe Francis reached out to Ashley Alexander Dupre now 22 with an offer of a million dollars
to appear in a non-nude spread for his company's new magazine, plus a chance to join the girls
going wild tour bus, his company on his yesterday.
But Francis said somebody had a revelation that they too did more of your staff meeting,
did anybody think to check the archives?
They did, he said, and there she was!
It'll save me a million bucks, Francis, it's kind of like fighting a winning lottery ticket
in the Christians of your couch.
I'm going to go look in the Christian divide couch now, you finished the show, I'm going to go for that winning lottery ticket.
Francis said if that point is offer was off at that time, I've got to take my shirt off, it's too warm in here.
I think it's too warm, huh?
Stripper music for that?
No, it's not that it's so warm, like outside, it's just that it's not, we don't have these horrendous, like,
9 is 17 at night anymore, so it's kind of like in general warming up a little.
Because spring is like tomorrow, right?
Okay.
When we say spring has sprung, and then Friday I'm off!
Hallelujah, it's good Friday, I'm going to be a camp.
Right Friday, we were spending the whole day hunting for author boys.
Francis said that at that point his offer was off the table, we actually had been dealing with her rep,
he said her offer was the real deal, we just never made the connection.
He said his employees got to work on pulling the footage and playing it off her on the website by last night,
maybe it's there already, with a free sampling on the front page and the rest available with a 29.95 monthly subscription,
girls going wild, Google it and find it, and maybe she's there.
Do praise the attorney, Don Buckwell, decline comment.
Don Buckwell, I don't like that.
Oh my God, are you smitten me or what?
Too bad, you know, how has got Don Buckwell, look what I got.
Look what I got, you fairy!
Yeah.
Is this from you, this facts or what?
Yes.
Oh, it's a liner, nothing could be finer than a Rita's Superliner.
Join QM's Orlando Elsa Query today.
Rock solid from 11 to 1 for the FedEx Cup.
Come by the FedEx, Kinko's at 1005, that's 10,000 5 Northwest 41st Street,
and you could receive a ticket to the World Golf Championship, C.A. Championship, while they last.
Plus, have your golf swing analyzed by renowned golf instructor Jim McLean.
Wow, now remind me to read that again.
Okay.
Ow!
Have your golf swing analyzed, alright.
Anyway, the getting back to this stupid, you heard it with girls going wild press conference.
She visited Miami in 2003 to celebrate her 18th birthday.
After fighting with a friend, getting thrown out of her hotel,
she found a nearby girl's gone wild bus.
She sighed legal papers and spent a full week on the bus filming seven full length tapes
that included nudity and same sex encounters with her in the company.
I personally ended up buying her a Greyhound bus ticket back home to North Carolina,
France has said.
France has returned to California last week after being sentenced to time,
time served and finds in Florida in a case involving filming underage girls.
She still faces trial on federal tax evasion charges that career firmly above the 10 years in the slimer.
DuPray's public profile of Skyrocketed since Spitzer of the New York Governor House's
resignation by papapapipipipip.
DuPray's MySpace page was hit more than five million times in the days immediately after the scandal broke
for musical efforts including two songs posted at the Music Sharing Site, Amy Street,
were listed into hundreds of thousands of times and played on national airways.
Hustler published her, Flurry Flint told the Associated Press Friday that he mailed DuPray,
offering her a million dollars to peer Newton's magazine,
but didn't sign up to Mystic, she would settle for that amount.
Flun suggested that by the time she starts talking, she may be too big a media phenomenon for a simple magazine spread.
She's no doubt going to do a book, there'll probably be a movie,
so I think she's going to have so many offers coming in that'll probably be wishful thinking just to get in the door, so to speak.
That's what Larry Flint said.
I'm sure he didn't say it quite that way, but he has difficulty speaking because they, you know,
any of the porn settlers, sooner or later, whether it's Al Goldstein or Larry,
they get them, they get them.
Wonder when was your Ron Jeremy's going to get his?
Maybe they'll slice off his s**t.
632 votes on the poll, let's see how we're doing on that thing.
Let's get Chris up to 900 today, that's our gold 900.
Okay, sounds good.
How come we can't do a thousand anymore?
There it is.
Well, we might be able to.
It's only 1.7 for tonight, so.
Get out of here.
Are you a crazy person or what?
Is if I have to ask.
I work here, darling.
Were you saying when you started or what?
I think so.
The most important lesson I've learned over the years from the Elijah Show is religion is
for crazy people, 227.
It remains.
Just like that one.
Josh shut up and cast the checks 99.
Do no harm 97.
Don't get into radio 83.
God forbid.
Stay out of this business man.
It's a killer.
Sugar is the worst drug in the world 50.
Worst in heroin.

Worst in whatever.
Sugar.
Azucar, baby.
Body wash isn't gay 40 and don't be a sport hole 36.
Unless you want to try out to be another clearing.
Neon calm.
I'll tell you that while let's play it again then.
All the worst biggest names.
The best out of two is new projects.
4.5.60.QAM.
The worst leader.
In the station, Lourona.
I'm here in Mione.
It's the bubble.
It's the bubble.
It's the bubble.
It's the bubble.
It's the bubble.
It's the bubble.
It's the bubble.
It's the bubble.
It's the bubble.
It's the bubble.
Everybody's going back to seeing Mel's movie now.
Mel's hit movie about the crucifixion.
Just get past the violence for movies from back now.
Then these go see the crucifixion.
The light he went through it's only fair.
Making his movie was messed across too fast.
So come on, come on, watch the crucifixion with me.
Do you ever wish that your family and friends knew their Bible verses better?
Well, I have the answer to your prayers.
From the makers of You, St. Mike Martyr comes again the whole family can enjoy.
Crucifixion.
Crucifixion is not just fun to play, but it forces everyone to know their Bible.
And it's easy to play.
First, someone picks a word or phrase from the Bible.
And the rest of the group takes turns trying to spell it.
But be careful.
If you pick a wrong letter, your little Jesus doll gets nailed.
Um, I'll take a guess.
Um, how about a kid?
Nope, sorry, Billy.
I'm sorry, Jesus.
After three nails and one spear to the chest, everyone loses.
But don't worry, in three days you can play again.
So run down to your local crucifixion toy store and grab up your very own copy of Crucifixion.
Why not play tonight?
Comes with a small Jesus doll, nails and a tiny spear, fake blood, wooden cross, and hammer not included.
Crucifixion, a product of Trinity Brothers.
Oh my God.
1031 and 560, WDQ.
And over here we got the jerk show coming at two.
How could you forget that?
Now is it disrespectful and sacrilegious to be claiming those things to just the error of Easter like this?
No, it's important.
It's important.
It's important.
Oh good.
Because just like that pole is showing, man, the religious people are the crazy people and the dangerous people.
These are the ones that will kill you with kindness, literally.
Speaking of being killed, guess who's dead?
I don't know.
Vicky van meter.
Who?
See, I know I'd find one for you that you would stump you.
Vicky van meter, who made headlines in the 90s for piloting a plane across the US at age 11 and from the US to Europe at age 12, died in apparent suicide.
He was only 26.
Van Meter died, sedative and apparently self-inflicted, go shot wound.
A Crawford County coroner said in Pittsburgh her body was found in Meadville, Pennsylvania, and her home on Sunday.
Her brother said she battled the pressure, but her family thought she'd been dealing with the problems.
She was unhappy, but it was hard for her to open up about that.
We all thought she was coping.
Daniel van meter said he said she had opposed taking medication.
Van Meter was celebrated in 93 and 94 when she made her cross, I never heard of her.
Did you?
No.
When she made her cross country and transit landing flights accompanied by only a flight instructor, her instructor said she was at the controls during the entirety of both trips.
If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything Van Meter said before a second trip.
In her teens, she said she hoped to become an astronaut when she grew up.
Later she earned a degree in criminal justice from Edinburgh University in Pennsylvania and spent two years with the Peace Corps in the former Soviet Republic of Moldova.
She recently worked as an investigator for an insurance company.
Her mother, Connie van Meter, said her daughter had begun applying to graduate schools wanting to study psychology.
Van Meter was a sixth grader in September 93 when she flew from Augusta, Maine to San Diego over five days.
I guess she did better than what's her name?
Who was the child pilot Jessica?
Right.
Was that her name?
Uh-huh.
Child pilot.
She had a fight strong headwinds and turbulence that bounced her single engine system 172m6.
Oh my god.
She was keeping her guts up.
At the time she was believed to be the youngest world applying across the US, that record was broken by a 9-year-old in 94.
Excuse me. How about a fetus flying that plane? What do you say?
The right for life is a like that.
What the fetus flying?
Also in 94 van Meter flew from Augusta, Augusta to Glasgow, Scotland, and was credited with being the youngest girl to make a transatlantic flight.
She battled dizziness brought on by high altitude and the crater pond landing.
I always thought it would be real hard and it was. She was talking about the flight.
I'm sure.
The child pilot phenomenon ended in 1996.
Here it is.
When 70-year-old Jessica Dubra, her father and instructor supervising the flight, were killed in a crash in Wyoming.
While Jessica was trying to become the youngest person to fly across the country, Congress quickly passed a bill banning record-setting attempts by unlicensed pilots.
Oh god.
I was really rooting for her, but I guess a reality says accidents do happen by meter, then 14-7th time of that crash.
It's unfortunate how it happened to someone so brave somebody trying to fulfill her dreams.
Connie van Meter, or Corrine, her name is I'm sorry.
Sitter daughter let a full and interesting lifeshed.
More guts than they have us could ever imagine. Her funeral will be held in Meadville, but arrangements haven't been finalized.
All you people want to go to poor little Vicky van Meter's suicide.
I mean, funeral.
We'll be giving you the arrangements soon.
You know, that's the morbid crowd. People like going to funerals.
People whose idea for a watchman like that.
People whose idea for a fun vacation is going to visit all the concentrates.
Oh yeah.
What a hoot.
I'm going to visit all the camps and see where all the bones and dead people are.
It's going to be so educational and wonderful.
Wow. Why would anybody? I mean life is so short. Why would you want to waste your time with something so morbid?
But there are a lot of people who do cramp like that. You know.
People do cramp.
665 volts on that pole. We better get up over 700 by the top of the hour by 11 o'clock.
Then you've got to shout at something. I don't know what.
Okay.
But it's pretty scary.
Scary. Whatever happened on that website.
Was it down or something? Did we have a little, I don't know what they're going on there?
But then it's a spastic market.
Man, we go from a phenomenal response yesterday.
Not so much on the pole, but just in terms of the website.
To like vanishing, like we've vanished from the face of the earth.
I think George chased away the whole audience last week.
That would mean you have what's your name on again from a power?
Yeah.
Oh, God. Why?
Why not?
You lose that yellow pen. She's hysterical. She's a pit.
Okay. I'll take your word for it.
I've never heard her so I'm not going to pre-joy it.
What is the story with that?
It's the fact that she's a female.
Right?
Here's the editorial on Obama's speeches.
The New York Times editorial also got a column by Marine Dowd.
I got all kinds of crap.
I got all the latest polls out.
And whatever you want the pool to say, we got one to make you happy.
You know what I mean?
Makenza Head. He's behind.
Obama's doing great. He's not doing so great anymore.
Swirli's not so far ahead in Pennsylvania as she was.
Now, actually, Pennsylvania, she's farther ahead, but Florida she ain't.
And on and on just goes.
It's just nauseating, but there's the numbers racket again.
See when you're mailing it in like I am.
You have to have a lot of numbers.
And believe me over the course of my lifetime, I've had lots of numbers.
Some of them really good numbers too.
Nothing like a good number, you know what I mean?
Mr. Obama's profile and courage rights to the New York Times editorial.
There are moments increasingly rare in risk-abhorrent modern campaigns
when politicians are called upon to bear their fundamental beliefs.
In the best of these moments, the speaker doesn't just savv'd a current political word.
He's a little wounded but also illuminates larger troubling issues
that the nation is wrestling with.
In inaugural addresses by Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt come to mind
as does JFK's 1960 speech on religion
with its enduring vision of the separation between church and state.
Senator Barack Obama, who hasn't faced such a test of character this year,
faced one on Tuesday, it's hard to imagine how it could have handled it better.
Mr. Obama had to address race and religion
at two most toxic subjects in politics.
He was as powerful and frank as Mitt Romney
was weak in calculating earlier this year,
and his attempt to persuade the religious right that his Mormonism is Christian enough for them.
It wasn't a moment to which Mr. Obama came easily.
He hesitated uncomfortably long and dealing with the controversial marks of his spiritual mentor and former pastor,
the Reverend Jeremiah White Jr., who denounced the U.S.
and demically racist, murderous, and corrupt.
On Tuesday, Obama drew a bright line between his religious connection with Mr. White,
which should be none of the voters' business,
and having a political connection which would be very much their business.
The distinction seems especially urgent after seven years of a president who's worked a blur in the line between church and state.
Obama acknowledged his strong ties to Mr. White.
He embraced him as the man who helped introduce me to my Christian faith
and said that as imperfect as he may be, he's been like family to me.
Wisely, he didn't claim to be unaware of Mr. White's radicalism or bitterness,
disarming the speculation about whether he personally heard the long time pastor of his church speak the words being played and replayed on YouTube, on YouTube.
Obama said Mr. White's comments were not just potentially offensive as politicians are apt to do,
but rightly offend white and black alike and are wrong in the analysis of America,
but he said many Americans have heard remarks from your pastors priest or rabbis,
with which you strongly disagree.
Obama's eloquent speech should end the debate over his ties to Mr. White,
since there's nothing to suggest that he would care religion in the government.
But he didn't stop there. He put Mr. White's beliefs into the reaction to them
in the larger context of racial relations, when honesty seldom heard in public life.
Mr. Obama spoke of the nation's ugly racial history, which started with slavery and Jim Crow,
and continues today in racial segregation, the school achievement camp,
and discrimination, everything from banking services to law enforcement.
He didn't hide from the often unspoken reality that people on both sides of the color line are angry.
For the men and women of Reverend Wright's generation, he said,
the memories of humiliation and fear have not gone away, nor the anger and the bitterness of those years.
At the same time, many white Americans, Mr. Obama,
noted, don't feel privileged by their race. In an era of stagnant wages and global competition,
opportunity comes to be seen as a zero-sum game, he said,
and in that both sides must acknowledge that the others grievances are not imaginary.
He made the powerful point that while these feelings are not always voiced publicly,
they're used in politics, anger over welfare and affirmative action held towards the Reagan coalition, he said.
Against this backdrop, he said he couldn't repudiate his pastor.
I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community, he said.
I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother.
That woman whom he loves deeply, he said, once confessed her fear of black men who passed her on the street,
and more than once uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made him cringe.
There have been times when we wondered,
what Mr. Obama meant when he talked about rising above traditional divides.
This was not such a moment.
We can't know how effective Mr. Obama's words will be,
with those who will not draw the distinctions between faith and politics that he drew,
or who will reject his frank talk about race.
What is evident though is that he not only cleared the arrow-very particular controversy,
he raised the discussion to a higher plane.
And if she were still alive, maybe a little Vicki or whatever her name was,
Vicki Van Meter maybe she would have flown that plane.
But now come on.

An investigation into the drinking water supplies of two dozen major metro areas
has found trace amounts of pharmaceutical drugs in the water.
What if I could or help?
It all came out of our dad from the legs of my home life line.
You drank all those medications.
Now you shouldn't see the sea life.
Boy, this becoming my bed, too much estrogen-throening rounds.
The drugs just won't do our blood.
We pissed them out and then we found drugs in the water.
And they will get you high.
Drug use is fun.
Drug in the water.
Oh, black.
Do I look like I need more drugs?
14 to 11.
As a matter of fact, yes.
Let me just read this one more time and then I'll put it where it belongs
in the circular file.
Join the big O today or land around the query from 11 to 1.

That was bad.

Nope.

And you'll say, well, this is frustrating to know that I'm here.
Maureen Dowder has a column at the time today, Black, White, and Gray.
In many ways, Barack Obama's speech on race was momentous and edifying.
You could tell it was personal that he had worked hard on it all weekend
into the wee hours Tuesday.
Overriding AIDS who objected to putting race center stage,
he addressed a painful difficult subject straight forwardly
with a subtlety and decency, rare, and American politics.
Certainly, Senator Obama was exercising sophisticated
damage control on his problem with Jeremiah Wright,
but he didn't pander as Mitt Romney did with his very challenging speech
about Mormonism, or market test his own convictions as most politicians do.
Unlike what the Clintons did to Lanny Ganeer, responding to a radical racial
ideas by throwing her out of the bus, Obama went to great pains
to honor the human dimension of his relationship with his politically threatening old uncles
he calls him.
The splaying his multi-hued, praise-equalty DNA, he talked about
cringy when he heard the white grandmother who raised imbues,
racial stereotypes, and profess her fear of passing black men on the street.
He tried to shine light on that clannish place where grudges and grievances
flourish.
After racing from race for a year, he plowed in and took his damage
wearing black, what white resentment felt like, and what whites what black resentment felt like.
He was spot on about my travel working class Irish, the ones who felt break his wings
to speak in New Hampshire and Ohio, and made him so in Pennsylvania, she says.
He rightly struck back at right-wing hysteria mongers,
talks show host and conservative commentators build entire careers
unmasking bogus claims of racism he said while dismissing legitimate discussions
of racial injustice and equality as mere political correctness or reverse racism.
Obama's warning about race in America was reveling of Eugene O'Neil's observation about Ireland.
There was no present or future O'Neil said, only the past happening over and over again.
His speech was pitched to super delegates queasy about his spiritual guides Malcolm X's
racism, the virulent racial pride, the separatism, the deep suspicion of American and the white man,
the very things that Obama's post-racial identity was supposed to have transcended.
The candidate may have staunched the bleeding but he didn't heal the wounds.
His naive and willful refusal to come to terms earlier with Reverend Rice anti-American anti-white and pro-ferrican
sentiments echoing his naive and willful refusal to come to terms early with ramifications of his friendship
with sleazy fundraiser Tony Resko will not be forgotten because of one unforgettable speech.
But then the most intriguing thing about this speech in the National Convention Center here, Constitution Center,
and near the statues of the founding fathers who signed the document declaring that all men are created equal
was not even the part about black and white, it was the new color that Obama unexpectedly wore, grey.
The black and white plaguing Obama camp was not only about skin color,
facing up to his dubious behavior toward his explosive friends, he had his first rude introduction
in his political career to ambivalence, ambiguity, and complexity.
Obama didn't surrender his pedestal willingly but he was finally confronted by a problem that neither was
charmed or his grandiosity would solve.
He now admits that he had heard the Reverend Reich made controversial remarks in church,
and then he had a lapse of judgment when he left the much investigator rescue,
a curry favor, by buying the plot of land next to his and selling a slice back so Obama could have a bigger yard.
Nulli alerted to the perils of not seeming patriotic enough, he ended the speech in Pennsylvania
that the morning with God bless America.
A little disinchantment with Obama could turn out to be a good thing,
too much idealism can blind lead to the reality as surely as too much ideology can.
Up until now, Obama and his worshipers have set it up so that he must be so admirable and ideal and perfect
and everything we've ever wanted that any kind of blum as she'd been a parking ticket was regarded as a major failing.
With the Clintons we expect them to be cheesy on ethics so no one is ever surprised when they are,
but St. Obama played the politics of character to an absurd extent,
for 14 months his argument for leading the world has been himself, his exquisitely globalized self.
He should be congratulated on the disappearance of the pedestal, leaders don't need to be massiahs,
gray as a welcome relief from black and white.
I wonder if she made gray or maybe that.
I wonder if his wife knows about that.
Maybe?
692 and intercutor rumors that you see McCain may be picking to be his running mate,
taking of your governor.
Oh, ballots the ticket.
Yeah, two gray-year-old coods.
Right, yeah, one straight, one gay.
Yeah, one that'd be something.
I think that's a great idea.
Talk about dragging him out of the closet man, or be skeleton's rattling all over the place.
Bye-bye, John McCain.
That was like my algorithmic Jewelieberman, same thing, a death wish.
And he still won the election in the end, but it was close enough that he could steal it from him.
That should be a lesson for everybody.
Oh, look at this oil well.
Where is this Oliver Springs Tennessee?
Wow, there's an oil well fire.
Information on it.
Wow, well, well, well.
You know what that means?
20 bucks a gallon by the end of the day.
He's always got some excuse.
Well, you know, we got the shortage over here and the refineries are on fire,
and with this and the Saudis are pissed off and they need more halava, whatever it is.
Poor him by the way on Friday, right?
But that's why I get off on Friday.
There you go.
Good Friday.
He screwed up.
Ference screwed up.
He thought I was taking off because he gave me the day off,
and you got a choice either Friday or Monday.
Happy poem!
And it's Friday is a poem.
Happy poem!
So he gives me the whole day to scour the city here and find some real humontage.
Happy poem!
Happy poem!
Happy poem!
And what else do you do on a poem?
I don't know.
You don't have a visit with Queen Esther?
The Malester?
Finish that semester.
All right.
692 votes on Chris's pool here.
694.
Oh yeah, well you get to 700 by the top there.
Just barely.
It's going to be a real problem for you to get to 1000 today.
If we don't get to 1000 today, I'm not coming in Friday.
Okay.
Now what about you?
Do you get one of those days off for what?
Me?
Yeah, you.
Yeah, you.
He said I maybe he'll find someone for Friday,
or maybe he'll give me another day off.
Or maybe I just have to work every day.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Oh!
How does it feel to be so respected and so...
I'll be working radio, you tell you when I find someone?
Well that's really something.
Maybe he'll find somebody which means...
Well when he says that, you know that means no chance.
He just gives a great idea of show up.
You know what, George having to work alone on Friday?
We'll get somebody.
He's two hours.
Right.
George sounds like he doesn't really care.
Well that's right, we got the basketball game.
Oh, I'm stupid man.
Too late.
Already made plans.
Already made plans.
Already made plans.
Already made plans for Monday.
Plans my ass.
Yeah, no, no, no.
Those are big plans then.
I thought I was getting like a real bananze here,
and as it turns out, we did play an art show on Friday.
That's stupidly on Monday already.
I've got a special ticket for the show.
You ever guess, who is it, St. Mary?
I've got a custom plate.
I've got a custom plate on a good Friday.
Already made a date.
St. Mary's.
Yeah, made a date.
On Monday.
All you heterosexual guys, man,
they always talk about us fags being the perverts,
but all you heterogies, the ones screwing your brain down.
So I don't deny it.
Anything with a skirt on, including even something
that have like a, you know, like a weenus.
So I guess we're going to have old weenus face on you
on Friday doing the UN basketball game.
You know, weenus face.
Uh-huh.
Terrific acting.
Yeah.
So I guess that, well that's all right.
It's okay, I can handle it,
because the following week I'm taking off early in the week,
I'm saying, how?
Catch a flight.
And jolly jolly will say,
I want to see you after the show, George,
let's have an inquisition about winding.
What's Neil doing?
Is he having a meeting about some job somewhere?
Yeah.
Yeah, you should look so long, Joe.
Slacker.
We're going to have a meeting about some job.
That normal can't, man.
He said, always, always does that.
Always sends me, you know, emails about stuff
that I already talked about on the air.
Not that I expected to be out there listening to this show.
I expected him to be out there defending a bunch of perverts somewhere,
you know, doing some work, but in the meantime,
How about something important? How about something meaningful? How about some meat?
How about something that has to do with my life in Georgia's life and chicken X neck?
God
But only forget I got to send him some money pretty soon. Okay, don't forget but not too soon. I don't want to overdo it
I don't want to spoil life child. Oh gee, I need the money now. What am I gonna do?
Yo, we've avoided that for a little while now that I get them all on a straight narrow with accounting with jolly Joe
Which he thanked me profusely for he said no less than anything George tells you he's full of crap right I already know that
701 votes nice going Chris
This is the neo-Ranger show
This is your brain
What's all it any questions?
No
He's good
Thing I knew we had a layman on his feet singing
I
God
Yes, they do but there's other people to give so I now he's the reason that we have any today
Sing and do I did it did it done did it do and he's the reason that all the Christians
Praise him to I did it did it done did it do they praise him praise him kneel down kneel down
Praise him and kneel down the man who wore a thorny crown
Meal God
I did it did it done did it do do I did it done oh yeah
Do I did it did it done he said you do I did it did it done he said you
Do I did it did it done he said you do I did it did it
He said you well, it's low to it five sixty WQM happy spring everybody happy
Poor him happy Easter happy a good Friday unhappy good Friday
Now it's happy for me. I'm not working but it's only two hours off or if you had told me that before I still would have taken Friday
You want to know why why who wants to wait till Monday right
I don't know what it is but there's something about if you have off Friday and then Saturday and Sunday to me
That's like a 3 day weekend if you have a Saturday Sunday and then Monday it's still a 3 day weekend but not right
I don't know why it's a but that's a good point but I'm right though you are right
It feels more like a weekend day
Poor him is more than just home in touch by the way I went to Wikipedia and of course Wikipedia is loaded with crap
Poor him is a Jewish holiday that commemorates the deliverance of the Jewish people of the ancient Persian Empire from
Hamons plot to annihilate them they always were picking on the damn Jews for quite a while go pick on somebody else
They never did nothing
As recorded in the biblical book of Esther hey Esther he finished the semester Esther
According to the history of Hamon cast lots to determine the day upon which to exterminate the Jews
Everyone who wants to exterminate the Jews
Well they kicked him out of Miami Beach they moved him all up to Boko I'll tell you that
Now let me ask you this question see how I was thinking about this before the show
I guess the answer is obvious and that is they keep moving from New York and that is when the Jews in New York
It old enough that they moved to Miami Beach now they moved to Boko my right they replaced the ones that croat
But not enough of them are coming down because that's why all the delis are going out of business
Maybe too many are coming down which is why the delis are going out of business because they're stealing all the silverware in a sweet and low
Hey the famous the the rascal house would be closing soon
Won't that be something huh won't that be like the end of the world a shanda
Remember that song by the beef voice help me shanda
Poor myself read the annual accord the Hebrew calendar on the 14th day of the Hebrew month of Adar
The day following the victory of the Jews over their enemies as with all Jewish holidays
Purim begins its sundown on the previous secular day
So Purim in other words is tonight is that right at the sundown or tomorrow night
Friday at sunset wait no crap
I can't read the calendar from here
Well maybe Chris can read it okay he's been in around now
Maybe he can get his blood sugar on his seven right
That is poor so that means probably tonight that's sundown
Well today's Wednesday
I mean tomorrow night as well
Well listen don't start complicating matters okay like I'm at this age where it's supposed to know what day the week it is
Will you stop it?
In cities that were protected by a surrounding wall at the time of Joshua including Shushan, Susa and Jerusalem
Whatever the hell that means Purim is celebrated on the 15th of the month known as Shushan Purim
What?
Purim is characterized by public relations
Oh a public recitation of the book of Esther
Kariat Hamagila
Not to be confused with McGillagurilla
Giving mutual gifts of food and drink
Michelach Manot giving charity to the poor
And a celebratory meal say that Purim
Other customs include drinking wine
Glossibit, wearing of masking costumes and pubic celebration
Oh let's celebrate our pubes all during Purim
Jewish exiles from the kingdom of Judah who'd been living in the Babylonian captivity found themselves under Purim rule
After Babylonia was in turn conquered by the Purim Empire
According to the book of Esther, Hamin was invited to King Ahazurus
Ahazurus planned to kill the Jews but his plans were for by Esther who was made queen after Zerce's killed out his previous queen Vashdi
And Mordekai, the palace gatekeeper of Zerce's who raised Esther when her parents died, thought he was her cousin
Oh brother this is too complicated for me
There was evidence of divine intervention on behalf of the Jews the Jews were delivered from being the victims of an evil to create against them
Or instead allowed by the king to destroy their enemies and day after the battle was designated as a day of feasting and rejoicing
But this says nothing about Hominthasher
Okay
I guess I'm gonna have to Google Hominthasher and say
Shaped by Hamin's hat
Now what do you know about it?
That's why it's triangular you know in spite of your denials
And I agree with you that the one-taste infinitely better
infinitely better
The one time that the one's that tastes good
The ones that you're talking about taste infinitely better but nevertheless the proper traditional kinds of those hard ones
I don't care about proper interditional like care about what's taste good okay
Nevertheless
Proper interditional my fat ass
I don't taste a
Please, Kate Christ
There's a triangular hat
The events leading up to poor more recorded in the McGillot Esther the book of Esther which became the last of 24 books of the talk to be canonized by the sages of the great assembly
A bunch of bubble mice is if ever I heard them man
But a bit better move put about a bunch of guys with long beards and a lot of things crawling around under their Yamaha
You know I really wonder when I get one of those camps you know with those Indian camp drivers here
That are wearing that head gear
We're in that Shmata on their head
I wonder just how many things are crawling around under that and if they got their turbidon to tight if they're gonna drive good
You got your turbidon to tight slow down you lunatic you maniac you terrorist
See I know that the Indians the people for all their last night it would bind
There was a guy I'd say in his 30s ugly
But anyway he was playing the machine that I finally wanted to play in which by the way didn't do any good but
He got off the machine and I sat down there and I thought he was gone
You know I'm thinking he's gone and once he's gone and he came back and he reached over to pick up his cup of coffee
That I had seen next to the machines. Oh can I get my coffee?
So he got his face very close to mine. He smelled like death. I don't know exactly what death smells like
But that's what I imagine death smells like he smells so bad and I want to just you know over the years I've talked about well
You know it's in it's in people's skin. It's part of their whatever I tried to say it's just excuse for people that don't take a bath I think
It's in the pigmentation of their skin in like some Chinese people smell or oh I noticed
And some people from India oh my god that cura kid curry
I'm not sniffing the Chinese with the Indians as much as I used to
Well I'm gonna tell you something some I've snipped a few
Yeah the other stuff is the half-reads you know the mixed Canadian and whatever
The Irish and a lot of those people are really a lot of very beautiful but then and most people don't smell the mixed breed
They don't actually came no they don't okay I'll take your word with their nose I know this the Irish smell great
Yeah I guess you and footy have been doing things all right yeah that's what I'm talking about
Footy gross
Oh look at this America's cleanest series wasn't this boring
Somebody just facts this says hey you know did you see the article that says Miami's America's cleanest city
Oh yeah you should live so long I guess that would be downtown much
One will live with the air is sweet the water is pure in the streets are clean try the country
But if you don't like the sticks and try Florida it says oh Forbes magazine baby
Well what's more interesting the story of Purim or this brick
Led by Miami the sunshine state dominates our 2008 list of America's cleanest cities with four
Metroid isn't top 10 Jackson bills number three Orlando's number four and tap a St. Pete number eight all make appearances
I mean like like that would make me want to live there try was a very clean city
Vancouver was a very clean see boy Vancouver was great Montreal sucks Vancouver is great just keep that in mind
Clearly it says Florida's estate they rely so heavily on tourism and part time snowboard residents
Know the value of keeping itself spruce effort company with the building advantage or weather patterns that blow out smog
These large metropolitan areas together with number two ranked Seattle and number five Portland Oregon top are 2008 list
See that's that great Northwest Seattle and Portland which probably very much like Vancouver right
Right but it's more than just seedries is pushing these metros up the list
These big cities are also reaping the rewards of investing in efforts to keep clean even as their populations boom
In recent years Florida's Department of Environmental Protection has launched programs aimed at providing power plants
Oh, there is a Barack Obama talking about five years in Iraq
Can I answer the simple question posed by Republican Senator John Warner in hearings last year?
Are we safer because of this war?
No. The agency has single out the 10th electric company for going beyond federal and state requirements on emission reductions
On the water side the agency's aimed its budget not only on fighting direct discharges into public waters like in Amsterdam where the water and the canals is all brown
But on indirect spillage from things like storm grain runoff you ought to see those canals in Amsterdam and I'll make a future gut set
The same as two elsewhere Portland for example is 10 years into a 14 year two billion dollar investment aimed at cleaning up the Willamette River
In addition to cities added more light rail sidewalks and biofuels towards bustle it's gone a long way to reducing your pollution and this goes on in Alakasad
Beyond health tenderness appears to have an important economic impact while nine of our ten cleanest cities showed population increases between 2000 and 2006
Major metro areas losing residents over that period tend to right near the bottom of the cleanliness list
They include Filth of Alphia, Chicago, Buffalo and Detroit. Oh, fat!
No shock to me there. Many factors notably economic ones go into a person's choice to move of course
But a reputation for clean air water and streets seem to count as well. The migration has been most pronounced in the Sunbelt with Jacksonville growing its population 8%
And Miami 11.5% since the start of the decade can they keep clean with all this growth? That's the challenge of the coming decades
Here's hoping they can says Forbes magazine don't throw your stale home and toss them on the street's phone
Bring your door to the edge

I just watched on YouTube I watched on the road again when the 1985 George Morton Levy pace with Buddy Gilmore
All right, about 10 likes
Well anyway, he was one to five, you know it's like 20 cents on the dollar not a big deal
But anyway, now the reason that was important is because it was it, I don't know if it was that year or whatever year it was
But the George Morton Levy was run on Purim at Roosevelt one night and I was watching
Racing from Roosevelt on tape with Stan Verstein and Spencer Ross and they were eating
Homo�an during the Taucast and Stan turned to Spencer Ross and said you don't have to be Jewish to enjoy the Levy and they both cracked up and lost it
It was memorable, memorable moment
Live TV, a Homo�an also spelled about ten different ways is a pastry in the Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine
Recognizable for its three cornered shape and it's got pictures here of those little hard ones you were talking about FAT
Ooh, it's eaten during the Jewish holiday of Purim
The traditional filling is made with poppy seeds, I poppy
But they're also made with many different flavors including prunes, ooh, not date apricot fruit preserves, chocolate or even caramel or cheese
Caramel Homo�an for goyem
Why not? Homo�an are generally made by rolling a dough thin cutting into circles of various sizes
Placing filling in the center and folding in three sides
The dough may be a cookie dough with orange juice added, citrus zest and ray yeast dough
It doesn't say anything in here about the ones that I like, the good ones
Right, just shows that Homo�an make this point, see they're not proper
They're just, I don't care what they're made of proper, you can't make a fan
They're not proper seeds
In other words, somebody made those...
There are two possible origins of the name, the most popular theory is that the name Homo�an which literally means Homo�an's pocket
Is a reference to Homo�an, the villain of form is described in the book of Esther
Hey Esther! A more likely source of the name is a corruption of the English word Montauchin or the German word Montauchin, both meaning poppy seed filled pouches
But there's nothing like filling your pouch with poppy seeds
Over time this name was transformed to Homo�an, likely by association with Haman
In Israel they're called Osnihaman, Hebrew for Haman's ears
I wonder what you call Haman's...
Let go!
Ask! Some Hebrew schools teach that Homo�an is from Haman's hat
There's a popular song that goes with this philosophy which goes,
My hat it has three corners, three corners has my hat, and had it not three corners it wouldn't be my hat
What a great song!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Oh!
The word Homo�an's singular, Homo�an is plural and is the word from more commonly used
However many people referred to these cookies as Homo�an even in a singular
Even though this is not grammatically correct...
In other words get your Yiddish right
Okay?
I'm gonna have song do your Yiddish right?
Let's see, Obama's got 1621, sweater we're 1479
Uh, it means he's how many ahead?
121, 142
according to the CNN account.
Now, then include the super delegates.
They took it off the screen so fast.
I can't tell.
Can you tell?
I'm not going to tell.
Oh.
Full and rational for delegates to be seated for Michigan.
She's saying she's accepting this plan
and Barack Obama's campaign while not rejecting it
is really hedging on it.
She's trying to put the pressure on him
to really say yes today.
And we'll see how this is.
Why would he be hedging on it?
Michigan, I think he would do very well.
I mean, Detroit is by far and away
to bigger city and then grab rapids and cities
with a lot of dark folks who probably would
overwhelmingly vote for Barack Obama.
What's the problem there?
Let's get with it.
OK, let's get Michigan in there.
Am I right?
Right.
I mean, if she only got 55% against nobody
against little Dennis Cassini,
say nobody else on a ballot,
how's she going to do against him for Christ's sake?
Not that great.
I wouldn't think.
Swallowery.
745 votes on the pool.
Boy, we've got to get to over 800 by noon
and I think we'll be safe.
Then they will fear us.
Do you think Chris?
Yes.
749.
The most important lesson I've learned
over the years from the near Roger Show is
religion is for crazy people,
260, 260.
Do no harm, 118.
Judge shot up and cast a checks 118.
Don't get into radio, 108.
I'm thinking of going back into with some day
before I croak.
What's this?
Facts.
Obviously, OK.
Sure was the worst drug in the world, 59.
Body wash isn't gay 45,
and don't be a sporthold of 41.
In one of the hotels in the hotel,
we stayed in Montreal and they didn't have no body wash.
They had soap, you know,
those little bars of soap in the bathroom.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, I felt unclean, man.
I felt like, oh, geez,
little, little white bars of nasty soap.
Like, oh, you people are still using soap, man.
Guess what?
Guys don't wear two-piece bathing suits anymore.
Here's the facts from Lisa and Fort Lauderdale.
She says, the best lesson I've gotten from
listening to you is pay attention.
I didn't give a crap about politics.
So I started until I started listening to your show 12 years ago.
I've been pissed off and fired up ever since.
Oh, Lisa, you were doing so well.
And then she says,
PS, I don't care what you say, arrow bars rule.
Oh, now, do you ever eat that one?
Yeah, we talked about it.
It was at Gulf Stream, I ate it.
And somebody brought me ones back in.
And it was delicious, but no taste.
Like you said, exactly.
It tasted like air, oh,
it's like sucking air, man.
Thanks, Lisa, but you're wrong, okay?
I mean, we can't always be right.
Now, what is the rest of the,
ah-ha-minute that I wonder if that's related to Ahma-Dinajad Empire
was that the first of the Persian Empire is to rule over significant
portions of Greater Iran,
the famous four of the Greek city states,
see Greek-Op Persian wars.
It was the first of many successors per,
what is this all about?
Or this is still about the Purim story,
about Esther,
which you learn into your second semester
and all this other crap, a bunch of garbage, man,
a bunch of bubble-mysed fairy tales.
As my rabbi told me many, many years ago,
when I was just a young man of 13,
learning, studying for my bar mitzvah,
today I am a fountain pen.
Oh, boy, such nonsense, such foolishness,
such crap that people would be okay.
It could just be for fun, you know?
It could just be for fun.
A lot of these holidays,
if people weren't killing each other over,
but they are, and they have been and continued doing it,
because that's what it's all about.
Oh, there's CNN promoting the mystery of Jesus,
the mystery of Jesus.
I bet they could talk to my,
across the street, neighbor down there
about the mystery of Jesus.
She'd hunk you, China,
about Jesus all day long,
if you gave her the chance.
Stay away from my house, Cindy, go away.
Keep your, uh,
get your crap to yourself, alright?
Nobody in my house wants it,
and if my dogs were still alive,
they wouldn't want it either, okay?
They were atheists.
When even your dogs are atheists,
that should be a sign.
Everybody in the neighborhood,
don't start hucking me with your religious crap.
Okay, keep it to yourself.
I don't want to take it away,
if that's your bag, fine.
And when you want to put up that big flag again,
it says the yeast is risen or whatever,
it says he is risen.
Oh my God.
What is that?
Why is it that people have,
life as a bumper sticker, you know?
Everything you believe has to be on a bumper sticker,
has to be plastered on your house.
Some big people are simple,
simple,
simple things,
not simple, simple things.
Seven, 60 on a pool.
I think we got a outside shot today for that.
If we got a thousand a day,
man, I'm taking off Friday.
Okay.
Two hours, big deal, big sumis.
So you think the clearance pulled a fast one,
either because I'm old and senile?
I think you did.
Knowing that we only have a two hour show anyway.
Came in this morning before the show gave me,
gave us the injured,

We are like, about 850 or 850.
eight to the ninety whatever you're gonna make a thousand oh wow the world will be proud of you
they'll say hey you're that fat guy from the neo-radio show they got over a thousand votes on a
pool today even when you started about seven i don't know i didn't start all that heavy duty not as
bad as yesterday that's because we didn't change this pool as um late still pretty late though
pretty late eric although it's my bad and the part of the reason for that is i fixed in the pool
his line was busy busy busy as fast line i don't want to bother him because it's probably some
hooker somewhere is fat line is fat line and uh finally i sent it through and i thought
everything is okay and then a little later on i come and check and i get a message from him
oh um i want only a little part of the pool came through can you refax it stay up that
fact that thing you got there wish he had a real facts machine you know i guess that's old
fashion right when you're a computer ace like he is right you get your faxes on your computer
that's right i like my old machines better because i'm old-fashioned a lot of these days
and i actually hook up the phone here again so uh but i doubted i mean i know i can do it and i
know it'll work but uh the router and the whole deal remember i had that problem oh boy
you you you were a you're witness to that whole thing while the guy that got injured was talking
me through the process of getting my internet scab back on here wow visions of deliverance you know
you crawling around on the floor in your box of shorts yeah crawling behind it uh you well you
never seen this thing right yeah i think what i do but i think he wasn't making you squeal like a
take some digital pictures of the studio totally right for lots of pictures put them on the website
so people want to see the taco take some pictures of that right next piece we put them in the use
yeah who who Florida Democrats overwhelmingly say they should get to help pick the presidential
nominee with one in four voters warning in a new Miami-Hirl pool they're less likely to support
the party November if the state is shut out well guess what you can threaten all you want the
Democrats aren't going to win Florida anyhow how do you like that no chance the pool also found
that Hillary Clinton was still in Florida to vote for hell today but that Barack Obama has closed
the gap in the past six weeks 89 percent of Democratic voters say it's important that Florida's
delegates count well then why not hold a real election that would be a good way to do it the
national Democratic Party stripped Florida Michigan delegates through the nominated convention
because they held unauthorized early primaries like how much of morons a record setting number
for Florida Democrats more than 1.7 million went to the polls on January 29th anyway
as neither Clinton or Obama's got enough delegates to claim the nomination the absence of the
two big states from the scoreboard has been fiercely debated Florida Democrats are divided over
potential remedies but a plurality say the national party should recognize Clinton's between the
January 29th primary right our votes are to count and should count say Mary Buckley 81 a
pool responded from northeast data I was hearing back in January it might not but I was hoping against
hope that it would hoping against hope that's like my heart of hearts we're going to get you Mary
Buckley a faithful voter no bomb a supporter like I said we like Mary said she's not certain now
Florida's delegates to be word of the candidates that's the $64,000 question she said
with or without how much I bet you he's dead Google how much he was the host the game show host
on $64,000 question and then come to find out I don't know if that was part of the a Quixote
scandal or not the $64,000 challenge was what's the question what do you mean what's the
crap about how much he won died in 1970 right boy he's not even pink anymore he's
1970 right see and I'll say wow but anyway as he says but my vote was wasted if it doesn't
count I never voted before that it wasn't counted that's what you think honey if you thought
you're voting on 2000 counted think again
Stroth, Eldon and Associates I wonder if that's Eldon Harner survey 600 registered and frequent
Democratic voters Saturday through Monday for the herald the same p times and bay news nyan the
margin of error was massively misfortune with the state parties decision Monday not to go through
they proposed email voting a promo is mail voting Florida could be the only state left out of the
epic of course why not it makes sense Florida's always effed up man that's our that's our claim to
we can screw it up the whole rest of the world can do things right we can't it's Florida baby
we put the DA in Florida best argument 24% of Florida Democrats say that if the state doesn't
have a say they'd be less likely to support the Democratic nominee that's the state's best
argument for convincing the National Democratic Committee led by Howard Dean to show show mercy
show mercy now where's the um in the herald poll 44% of voters count favor counted the January
20 as results would twice as many Clinton supporters as Obama supporters in that camp if the
National Party reversed its decision to exclude Florida Clinton would not 38 delegates in Florida
should narrow allow me heard a narrow but not close the 100 plus gap with Obama
it all crossed me out again their professor Jesus God I an email before that if I read it on the
year where everybody would be puking for the rest of the month 56% of the voters said the candidates
decision to board kept the state before the primary didn't affect their ability to make an
informed decision when they voted defying the argument made by Obama supporters that the
January 29th primary shouldn't count because no candidates campaign in the state and they already
agreed that it wasn't going to count Clinton would still want Florida for another primary where
held it a but Obama's game ground the past six weeks the poll put in nine points behind her 46 to
37 she won in January 50 to 33 by 17 points in the poll Clinton was more popular among women
white and Hispanic voters and she fair better than Obama in the southwest Tampa Bay and central
parts of the state Obama captured no forwhelming 74% of the black voting was stronger than Clinton
among voters under the age of 50 living and breathing people want Obama old toads wants swillery baby
and that's because they recognize the name swillery she put the swill in the swillery let me tell you
right now just like the canes put the what did they put in you can't spell scum without you
well don't forget we got that big game on friday at noon so Georgia only has to work two hours

well anyway the race for a democrats in Pennsylvania is turning sour for Obama
with five weeks until the if here's the latest numbers and latest pull
swallowing 53 and Obama 41 in Pennsylvania with five weeks until the April 22nd
primary Clinton's regain much of the ground she had lost on February 27th she was only six points
ahead 49 to 43 and now she's back up by 12 key lead continuously among women white voters over
45 old people like me and those without college degrees Obama leads among men blacks voters with
college degrees knows under 45 48 percent of respondents said the economies of nations most pressing
issue and 23 percent said that's the war in Iraq the Iraq attack among those concerned most
about the economy 55 percent favorite swallowing those who said that the war was split between the two
candidates the equatepianque university polls conducted by telephone march 10 to 16 involved
interviews with 13 ever in four elected democratic voters in Pennsylvania and a sampling error of
muscle-minus 2.7 points whatever that means eight away down the point you're doing it man it's
not even knew yet you've already got eight away aren't you thrilled I'm extremely thrilled
because if we get that thousand I'm not showing up on Friday at all oh then I don't think we
skip a thousand we better I'll take right now
I'm getting pornographic messages I'm going to complain to the proper authority the FCC no
members in charge of blackberries oh the F you see some Thompson asked have we really learned any lessons
don't do that spot I'll never forget that as long as I live I mean it's just it's one of the most
bizarre one of the most impossible only this sales department only the station could pull off a
debacle like that selling spots the people who are no longer in business gotta hand it to a man
that time since has ever learned any lessons demonstrators gather on a Washington
all the day to protest five long years of a failed war in Iraq a war launched by invasion
of a nation that posed no threat to us a war founded on lies and faked intelligence reports
wore the self-draughts of this nation in the economic chaos in destroyed American morale and
its reputation with its allies in its own citizens president George W. Bush will fame success
in Iraq and his speech before a carefully screened audience independent on today which he did
this morning but his speech will be filled with the same lies and cooked statistics that have
marked his discredited presidency Bush and those who surround him are serial liars who treat
truth as a disposable commodity and use the laws that land as toilet paper they've shredded a
constitution eliminated the so-called individual rights that used to define the nation
and brought a once great American to its knees today is more than just an observance of a lost
towards an anniversary of a five-year-long assault on the foundations of a country a mile
post into this mandeling of a way of life and a culmination of Bush's desire to ruin a country
and leave it in tatters as his presidency comes to an end you hear those sirens again
I hear it they're coming to save us from the Bushmeister
no president in history has done as much to break the backbone of America and cripple the
government designed to serve the will of its people not to corrupt agenda of a criminal
cabal that serves only the greed and self serving interest of a fat cat lobbyist and rich friends
and our motto of hijack commercial airlines crashing in hundreds of national landmarks
could never do as much damage to the american psyche as George W. Bush and his gang of thieves,
stugs, and scoundrels no invading army could have ever taken over the government and subverted
as much as Bush and his partners in crime the Congress of the USA Bush invaded Iraq but he did
so with the explicit approval of republicans and democrats in congress two of those criminal
co-conspirators are running for president today Bush destroyed the constitution of the US with a
pay for the act approved by a vast majority of both republicans and democrats in congress and
we authorized again by majority members in both political parties if the republican-led congress
rubber stand bushes actions the democratic led congress they've replaced it went along with his
lunacy and reneged on promises to win the war that marks its fifth anniversary today democratic
presidential contenders swelter a clinton may talk about opposing the war but she voted to authorize
it voted to strip away american rights in the pay for the act and she has never ever apologized
for those mistakes Barack Obama says he opposes the war but we have yet to hear where he stands
on the rights-roving USA pay for the act Bush's led americans descended away political and moral
hell but he did so with the help of congress in the complicity of a media that didn't ask enough
questions before the war and an electorate that we turned him to orifice he remains in office
because democratic speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi refused to allow her colleagues to bring
forward well deserved articles of impeachment against the criminal president the blood of those
who died in an illegal and immoral war stains not only the hands of George w Bush but also those
of too many republicans democrats in congress who did nothing to stop his lunacy today Bush will lie
politicians will pontificate and demonstrate this will demonstrate then tomorrow will go on
more americans and arachis will die more americans will lose their homes life saving the financial
security while more speeches and promises will be made but will anything change probably not
on this day when we mark the anniversary of a criminal war brought by criminal enterprise in
the white house and backed by criminal enterprise on capital hill let's remember that the legacy
of more of the same is the biggest crime of all rights our buddy Doug Thompson who's still alive
they're hunting him down i'm sure that in the hills there in west virginia where he's hanging

mcclean whatever that car's name was rame of fein junier
representative john murthy who turns out to be a big fat old toad a former marine envietan
more veterans become one of Congress's most-ots, book and credit to the Iraq War. Yesterday
endorsed Swallow Ray Clinton for President, saying she's the candidate that will forge
a consensus on healthcare education and the economy in the war in Iran, which makes
absolutely no sense. But nevertheless, in ten months, President Bush believed office
at Murthidemocratic Pennsylvania and the written statement, our country is worse off
than anything we took office over seven years ago. He said he's known Clinton for fifteen
years, and she continually reaches out for opinions and ideas, not just from our nations,
leaders, but from all Americans. This week she highlighted the policy faders in
Iraq and the rest of the real challenges we face in regard to building our military,
restoring our readiness, and fully preparing our armed services to meet in the future
threats, Murfidz said, I know that Senator Clinton has a similar position than I have,
in regard to the war in Iraq. Oh, really? Her experience and careful consideration of
these issues convinced me that she's best qualified to lead our nation and to bring
credibility back to the White House. Uh-huh. Murthidem recently told Congressional
Court to leave that he and fellow Pennsylvania Democrats, representatives Mike Doyle and
Robert Brady would vote as a block in the presidential election. Also several elected officials
close to Murthidem have held off making their own endorsements pending his decision.
Murthidem, 75, initially supported the war in Iraq, although he criticized the Bush administration
handling of it, and supported fellow Democratic Senator John Kerry for president in 2004.
He completed the about-facent of November 2005 when he called for the immediate redeployment
of US troops from Iraq, saying US and coalition troops have done all they can. It's time
for change and direction. He was the first to see new lawmakers to call for an immediate
withdrawal, immediately if not sooner. And here we are today five years later and the
money is just a not just an outpouring of blood from human beings, but a blood money.
An outpouring of your tax dollars, the likes of which nobody has ever seen, the economy
is going to hell on a basket and a casket. Oh, it's big enough for your money being flushed
down the toilet. Many, many years ago, I forget the year that we had the election on the
metro rail. Yeah. Talk about a fixed election, man. And of course,
Dave County is famous for a very questionable elections. I mean, really, just like in the
2000 presidential election, when the South Florida couldn't get a right, everything was
all screwed up. We were famous for that. And I remember watching Ralph Redneck on
then channel four on this metro rail, the train to know where they called it. Train to
know where. If you want to go to short east for ribs, then it's great. Otherwise, a billion
dollar boom dog will they call it. Even Ronnie Reagan said it will be cheaper to buy everybody
in Dave County, a Cadillac, a brand new Cadillac than build a metro fail. You've been
ever on the metro rail? I mean, a long time ago. Lately, how about you, Chris? You're
in Dave County, right? The metro rail? Not some type school.
After postponing Larry Lieberwitz in the Harold Wrights, a Larry happy poem, by the way.
After postponing, a federally mandated overhaul of the aging metro rail fleet for nine years,
Dave commissioners yesterday agreed to toss out nine million dollars in consulting fees
and staff time spent on the rehab and instead by brand new cars. Oh my God. Oh my God. They
keep flushing your money down the toilet like it was coming out of a faucet somewhere.
Commissioners, several of them, angry accounting managers and transit agency administrators,
voted eight to two to support the plan to buy new cars with at least $345 million from the
half-cent sales tax for transportation that voters approved in 2002. The transit agency's
argument was based on pure economics. New rail cars properly maintained can be purchased
for $2.54 million a piece in last 30 years. The rebuilt cars would cost $2.25 million
and last 20 years the transit director Harpal Kapoor. Sounds like an engine name to me.
You know, I think India is taken over the whole country, you know what? Right? When you
told me that thing about how when you pick up the phone and you call them, these like the phone
company, what I guess, yeah, yeah, thanks for poor you're talking to some it's not just a
coincidence the guy who helped me get my internet back and believe me, I bless him, I bless him
dearly, a happy poor and pally, but he was in India, right? And then there was no coincidence that
after I spoke to him like the next couple days, remember I started getting like phone calls from
India, so was the thing that I do want this, but I don't want it and I don't want to smell that
curry like I've got the machine next to me. Oh, can I give my coffee? Yeah, only if you don't come
anywhere near me, send somebody else over to get it. Don't come anywhere near where I can breathe
at aroma. Oh, it puts me in a coma. People who smell, I mean, you know, like I'm a sloppy
dresser, I have been all my life and people joke about it. I don't really care, I've got some
nicer clothes now that I do wear, but I'm still a slum. And it doesn't bother me, I don't
dress to impress other people, but I don't smell, I smell good. I always put the order, I always
put on some nice cologne, you know, I smell good, like a human being should. Good. I shower every
morning, in fact, usually I shower twice every day. People who stink have no place on this planet.
I'm going to do is I'm going to arm myself. Somebody smells, I'm going to take like a smell a meter.
And if the needle goes over a certain push, but I'm being, that's it, you're out.
I think like we all feel this is a bitter pill we have to swallow, but swallow it, we're going
to have to do because we have a system that have to have a system that works.
Said Commissioner Katie Sorenson, we can't continue to throw good money after bad, she said.
The fact of the matter is we need to do it. Said Commissioner Natasha Sejas, they're falling
apart. Sejas, that's that silent J in Espanol. Like Paco, every time we go into restaurant,
the orders apple use. The J is pronounced like an H. I understand that Sejas. I know they're like
talk us. So he's I know that no reason to say apple use, but none of the less it's no use.
What would you say apple? Who's no they have the J sound, but none of the less they do that.
They do what? They they drop it for some reason. They say apple use? They do. Well, that's what he says.
It's cute. Commissioner Joe Martinez and Aviger Soder voted no Jose P. P. D. As Sally Hayman and
Aviger Edmondsson were absent AOL no P. P. at the meeting. Of course, that's what we wanted in
Dave Kelly. No P. P. accepted the Westland law or they're still doing the limbo rock to the glory
holes. All you people in the highly a man, you think you're fooling us? We know what you're doing.
You're looking for the glory hole at Westland. I was going to say it. Bird Eins or was it a JC
pennies? Excuse me. It was the theme of a JC pennies. I wonder if Larry Craig is tapping it out
there. Oh, he'd have a good time there. The old toe tap or Larry Craig. People are horny. I know
it comes as a great surprise. People want to get laid. People want to get their rocks off. People
want to do these things. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I know it comes as a great shock to
the hypocritical media because all of them are like, you know, on a straight and narrow path like
Miss Kamal for example. Oh, here we go. I know that this is going to be. Yeah, then I just got
a message from your friend who doesn't bathe every day. I see. Yeah. Your friend on my space that
you communicate with that you send all those nice certificates to who better start getting. I think
maybe we'll send him some body wash with the next certificate. How long does it take to take a
shower? You know, but I'm not going to make any more comment than that because I want you know,
I'm going to keep my nose out of his business. 850 votes on the full. You're going to do it,
Mr. I'm sending that right now and this is going to be one of the great one of the banner days in
history of WQA and even Rick Shaw, but he's like doing cartwheels. I know what Rick is thinking.
You know, remember he gave me that he was hitting around when he said when it's time to retire,
you'll know. You'll know what's time. He's trying to tell me. I'm not going to do it. I'm going to
work for another hundred years. I'm going to work until I croak. Why not? Right? Right. So if
they only want to pay me 50 bucks a week, at least it's 50 more than I had before, I can go to
woodbine for five minutes on that. That'll give you something to do. By the way, let me give you a
piece of advice on the slots. All right. Besides don't plan. Okay. The dollar wheel of fortune is
the biggest sucker game they got going. Really? Now in Vancouver, it's a nifty casino that had their
river rock that quarter wheel of fortune and they also had a couple of five dollar machines, the old
ones that are like three coin jobs. It's 15 bucks every time you get the button, but that's a
less scam. That's a real rip off instead of 10 bucks. It's 15. But I played this a little bit
very cautiously and luckily I lucked out. I got 1250 bucks twice on the same machine.
I didn't have any losing days in Vancouver. Every day was either I broke even or I won some money.
I think a casino. Then we went to Montreal. Bad choice, baby Montreal. The casino there, it's beautiful,
but they have a one way deal. They just take your money, they don't give you anything back and the
frogs. But they would be, they would be, oh my god. If you French Canadians had any idea how obnoxious
you are, you'd probably welcome it suicide. I'm not just disgusting, rotesque, and no I don't
speak frog. Okay, sorry. I'm not speaking of the best talents. I'm speaking of the best
talents. I'm speaking of the best talents. I'm speaking of the best talents. I'm speaking of the best
good or li-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d

Speaking out against it when he was a state lawmaker
In fact here's his whole speech just like you know the speech he gave yesterday

You have some 40% of the 4,000 people surveyed said they wanted the US to play a bigger role in rebuilding Iraq and 36% wanted more British involvement
A lot of them want electricity and water too if they will think that would be nice. This is like a little bonus thrown in
Overall the wide-ranging poll-pated a mixed picture of Iraqi attitudes contrasting their bleak daily existence with a surprisingly
positive attitude about the future
It's true upstart to time that's what I'm doing thrown up
Doesn't mean a lot of pornographic messages on here. Oh
Which I can't talk about on here because they're just so grotesque so
Puking-ducing to me
See how I want those people that's already that excited about discussing bodily fluids and things. You know, I mean
But yeah, like that. What it is. It doesn't do anything for me other than just gross me out. Yeah

Oh that'll kill all those evil doers
Senator John McCain and Republican presidential nominee
And waiting expressed fresh, fresh concern yesterday
About Iran's influence in Iraq and rising sway in the Middle East
However as the Washington Post campaign blog points out
Miss McCain misidentified in remarks Tuesday
Which broad category of Iraqi extremists
Are allegedly receiving support from Iran
He said several times that Iran
A predominantly Shi'a country
Was supplying the mostly Sunni-Milalton group al-Qaeda
Cameron W. Barr and Michael Sheer note
In fact officials have said they believe Iran is helping
She had extremist in Iraq
After McCain said it was common knowledge
And been reported the media that al-Qaeda is going back to Iran
And receiving training and coming back into Iraq from Iran
The post reports senator Jew Lieberman standing just behind McCain
Step forward and whispered in the presidential candidates' ear
Lending McCain to add I'm sorry the Iranians are training extremists not al-Qaeda
Well
POR Jew Lieberman I'd stand there and whisper in his ear
The post blog adds the mistake threatened to undermine McCain's argument that his decades of foreign policy experience make him the natural choice
He'll need a country of war with terrorists in recent days
McCain has repeatedly said his indiment knowledge of foreign policy
Make him the best equipped to mention the phone ringing in the White House at 3 o'clock in the morning or 3.45 or whatever
Look at that, if abhorizing gas prices cost financial hardship to your family
The New CNN poll 72% yes and only 28% no
And probably of the 28% would say no they can't afford a car
McCain also voiced concern that Tehran is bringing militants over the border into Iran for training before sending it back to fight U.S. troops in Iraq
And blame Syria for allegedly continuing to exploit a flow of foreign fighters
Well, let's bomb them all McCain, come on insane McCain, make bush
Mick nut
There was a guy Keith Mick nut used to drive a potato down the Buffalo Raceway
We continue to be concerned about a meeting in influence and assistance that the Hezbollah's Wall is a Iranian pursuit of nuclear weapons
McCain said he ended up elected president he would coordinate better with Europe to impose a broad range of sanctions and punishments on Tehran
To convince them that their activities, especially developing a nuclear weapons, is not a beneficial goal to seek
McCain declined to comment on whether he could back an eventual decision to strike the right if Tehran doesn't cease its nuclear
Nuclear activities
In response to a question about possible U.S. unrest against Iran, McCain only said at the end of the day, we can't afford having a nuclear armed Iran
Which is code 4. You don't know what he meant when he said that don't you?
Bam bam bam, bam bam, bam barand, bam bam bam, barand
McCain ran into trouble last year when he joked about bombing Iran, giving her campaign audience and South Carolina
line of rendition of the opening lyrics of the Beach Boys rock classic Barbara and calling
the tune bomb bomb Iran etc.
The Cana was linked to his political future US success in Iraq was in the war-torn country
on Monday for meetings with Iraqi-N US diplomatic and military officials along with your
Vice President Dixie.
That Chris Matthews man, he must have the Anderson Cooper thing going on for him.
We must have relatives in high places somewhere.
I imagine.
You know what I mean?
He can't speak.
Here's the politics fix.
He can't even say the word.
A lot of people out here can't speak.
What about Larry Campbell?
Boba Wababa.
The brother.
God.
886 votes on a pool.
Come on, let's surge that thing.
Let's get the surge working here man.
Look at that.
They just showed the first computer.
What do they call that thing?
The first computer.
It had a big.
Yeah, that was it. Very good.
It's way before your time.
It's back in the 50s. Unified.
I know.
He used to take up a whole room.
All these big, gigantic.
And you could do almost nothing but the wheel to wheel.
That's before the Google guys came along.
I told you I saw their thing on biography and I got to be honest with you.
I don't know what to say that there were people that bring it.
When you realize how many stupid people there are there,
it goes to show you that there's the potential for people doing a lot of phenomenal things.
But most people would rather be lazy and stupid and just get laid and be stoned all the time.
Like George.
Here's another poll suggestion.
What are these things that's most likely to happen in your lifetime?
We might have done it before, but just like.
Well, not this one.
We've done similar, but not this exact one.
Now with these churches.
Man spaced like the Mars in your lifetime.
Legalized HTML1 in the US.
World will run out of oil.
Cure for AIDS. Cure for cancer.
Peace in the Middle East.
Or the second coming of Jesus.
Oh my God. I'm waiting for the second coming of Jesus.
All those bubble mists.
Man, all those stories.
Now what's the video that we have on our website?
That's one of the zeitgeist.
zeitgeist. That's the one.
Everybody needs to watch that.
And realize.
Eat it for the humble.
Well, beside that.
All these same free retails have been stolen from one religion after another.
Throughout the ages, man, the same stories with the virgin birth and the crucifixion rising from the dead.
And all these other ridiculous bubble mists, you know.
They'd be better off to watch Marty Python and a holy grail.
One of something like that.
Am I right?
Right.
The remease the Bibles and the marbles.
Like the waters.
The life of wine would be good, yeah?
Yeah.
I wonder if that was the life of wine, Andrews.
Oh, and speaking of Vancouver in a casino, they had a game in a slot called Heha.
Okay.
And one of the features on this thing that the big deal was that there were like these chickens that would pop up.
Okay.
And every time the chicken, one of the chickens would pop up where we go.
Like that.
The first one.
And if you have the second one, we're reading go like, my, my, my, my, my, my, my.
And then if the third one comes up, then you get 29 free spins.
Okay.
I had that several times.
Now that's kind of fun to sit back in the band your music is playing and they're picking and grinning and you're sitting there and, you know, accumulating a whole lot of bonus points.
Like that.
It was fun.
It was good.
Let me say it again. Vancouver is great.
Anybody who goes to Vancouver doesn't like it.
There's got to be some kind of a misfit.
I need a drink.
I have a drink.
I like it.
We're going to go with five sixty QAM.
I think sports leader.
All right.
I'm going to go to the next one.
I had a chicken and pay.
One day she blew away.
To Teo on a weather moon is blue.
The moon is blue.
But with our right wing censorship, there are words that mustn't slip.
Who do they tell you how I fail for?
That's fail for me.
So, if you see K&K one on, I'll see you with G1 or two.
Now if you see K, tell her I'm a Surrey State.
And the FCC won't let me sing this song.
I'll see K now if you see K, take her hand gently say.
That after this transmission, I'll be out in 90 days.
Oh, if you see K, if you want to, then I'll see you with G1 or two.
I go, I go, I got a G with G1 or two.
Well, that was close.
I was just a tinkling and I heard the last part of it.
I thought, oh my God, that thing is over.
So, I had to cut off my tinkle in midstream and like come running back in here.
Just made it.
Wow.
That's not good man, it's a bad sign.
You know, when you start losing control of your way to start peeing and peeing and peeing.
Of course, it happens to the best of us.
898 votes, two more will have 900.
Then we start building on that tour that thousand boy.

his raised a number of procedural and legal questions about the most reason
proposal for an early primary in March.
What do they mean an early primary?
What are they talking about?
They're talking about the third of June that's an early primary.
See this is making a sense.
This is on the raw story and if you ask me it's pretty raw.
The proposal offers a rerun for the state but not for all voters Bob Bauer, Obama's
election lawyer wrote in a memo during the day, he wanted the possibility of numerous
legal challenges and embarrassment to the party.
Florida and Michigan both held primaries in January on the streets of the led violated
Democratic Party rules and had been stripped of their convention delegates as a result.
Clinton made a hurriedly arranged trip to Michigan to dramatize her support for new
primaries at a time when some state party officials have been drafting legislation
to hold a primary on the third of June.
She is the word you're looking for, desperate, desperate, grasping for straws baby,
just reaching out there and trying to grab that thing, the brasser, oh there's Ricky Sanchez.
All dressed up like a priest.
What is that?
What is that?
What is that garb he's wearing?
What is that?
A priest without the collar.
We've got a ring around the collar, Ricky Tiki Sanchez proving that CNN is the anti-Christ
man putting his ass on there when his melodramatic rep.
They're talking about the price of pizza going to be so high because the price of wheat
is going through the roof now.
So the price of everything is going to cost you like $400 for a pie pretty soon.
Thank God we got tonies over there and the Jeff.
Swallowrey said nothing less than the outcome of the general election may be at stake in
this dispute over the two states.
The road to a Democratic White House goes through Michigan and Florida, she said, but there
were strong political calculations that work as well.
Swallowrey trails a bomb in convention delegates after primaries and caucuses in more than 40
states and her chances of catching up are remote at best.
Lobside to victories in second primaries in Florida and Michigan would help narrow
the delegate deficit, but even if she fell short, victories over Obama would strengthen
the argument that party leaders who attend a convention to super delegates should consider
a candidate's ability to win in key states in the fall election before they choose a candidate.
Originally Michigan was to have 128 delegates at stake in its primary, Florida's total was
1805 super delegates swelled the totals.
Clinton won the renegade primaries in both states, although all the candidates had pledged
not to campaign in either state and Obama removed his name from the Michigan ballot as did
John Boy Edwards.
Clinton referred to that in her brief appearances before members of an audience gathered in
AFSC and me union building.
When others made the decision to remove their names in the ballot, I didn't believe, I
didn't because I believe your voices should count.
She said, right, wouldn't you love to be the only name on the ballot, huh?
If you didn't want to play by the rules, if your name was Clinton and you wanted to cheat?
And that's why I've been saying we need to either count the votes that have already been
cast in Michigan or Florida and have new full and fair elections.
Powers memo didn't go as far as flatly opposing the proposal under consideration, but it
said it numerous political defuulities.
He said any repo would have to be approved by the Justice Department of the Voting Rights
Act and noted that it would be paid for by private funds.
He also warned a possible lawsuit by Democrats or independents who voted last voters Republican
primary and would be barred from the second primary as a result.
You know what my allergies are kicking off here?
What is?
I wrote Sanchez allergy.
I see.
And now my alley felching vibes, my allergies acting up.
Oh my God.
What do they got her on there all the time for?
What is the story with that lady?
I don't know.
I try to.
In other words, he wrote the proposal offers a rerun for the state, but not for all the
voters.
Both Michigan and Florida presumably are friendly territory for the New York Senator.
Michigan is home to large numbers of white blue collar workers, many whom are favored
in other primary states.
It doesn't mention the fact that they've got enormous numbers of dark voters in Michigan
like in Detroit and Grand Rapids and places like that.
And Flint.
Obama is difficulty in reassuring Jewish voters about his support for his real-makes Florida
problematic for him in a primary as this is the presence of a large number of Hispanic
voters.
And remember, way back one month ago when I had that article you were on vacation, but
I told you about it, that said, Hispanic voters generally tend to vote against black candidates.
Uh-huh.
What is that all about?
We've talked a lot.
You vote for Arabs.
The Jews vote for Arabs.
You're all semi-H.
You're all coming from the same place, right?
You know, kosher and circumcised and all that.
In this case, it was strengthened during the day when the two leaders of the Democratic
Rules Committee issued a statement saying the emerging plan in Michigan was in keeping
with party rules plans for a rerun in Florida collapse over the weekend, leaving the
fate of that state in, uh, in limbo.
We're doing the limbo rock in Florida.
That's because most people in Florida waiting to die.
Pretty soon we're going to be dead in a box.
They'll take us to a, you know, Mount Sinai first and then we'll croak there and they'll
take us to a, well, what's the big cemetery?
Where?
Mount Sinai.
No, Mount Sinai is not a cemetery.
It's a hospital.
Oh, okay.
Although, you know, something you could easily die the right day in here, dude.
Remember that?
I know.
I remember that call.
Oh, my God.
My call to Rick Riley.
I think I got it in here.
Really?
Have it in here still?
One moment, please.
No, I don't think I have that any more.
You got it?
I don't have it.
I never had it.
You never had it?
You called Rick Riley when I was head my gallbladder on.
I thought it was going to die right there in Mount Sinai.
When I was a bad experience, let me turn to that right now.
Nine hundred and five votes on the pool, baby.
Let's, let's in these next seven minutes before one o'clock really goose that number
up there so we can slide into the thousand.
I don't want to like have to push and pull.
And of course, Chris doesn't want to do that because he's too gentile, you know?
Oh, now what are you?
What is when is Lent started?
Are we already in Lent?
They're already in Lent.
Lent.
When is it started?
Like the month before he started?
40 days, I think.
Isn't it 40 days and 49?
Yeah, sounds good.
Is Lent?
Does anybody have to eat that?
Yantle soup?
Yeah, I really did think that there was a Catholic thing.
Yantle soup.
And then what did you tell me?
Is it a Jew thing?
I didn't tell you I listened or did.
That's a Jew thing.
Right, you got a Fax on it.
What did you get?
Lent?
Did you get Lent?
Lentle soup and Peisa.
Is it kosher for Peisa?
I don't know.
If they do a braho or it is.
I sure don't want to go to hell because I had Lentle soup and Peisa.
I don't know the other, every Lentle soup anyway.
Oh man.
It tastes like exactly what it looks like.
Okay.
It's the color of the canal water in Amsterdam.
I don't want to say dark brown but that's what it looks like and that's what it tastes like.
like, oh, fat. Like, duty. Howdy.
Don't forget to fill out your brackets for the tournament.
George is filling it up because he wants to money-lize to you.
He doesn't care about the outcomes of the games anymore than I do.
Dada, Dada, Dada filled it out.
But he hopes to win some more cash just by luck. Blind luck. Beginners luck.

No restaurant tomorrow on our 50-50 thing.
They have a little incident this week.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
We got one all lined up for next week.
I guess that's what the duck mights to tell me.
I think Duff oughta just handle that deal by himself.
And not let some of these other people like Andy, whoever Andy might be.
I remember Andy Devine on the Abuster Brown show on TV back in the early 50s.
Pluck your magic twanger, froggy. Andy Devine. He was about 600 pounds slim.
And what is with Zach losing all this weight?
You know how many 300 pounder plus people we have?
We have and have had in a station over the years.
We have Fat Boy, we had Josh Friedman.
Zach, the beast, the Humper.
You think he wanted 300?
I don't know. I'll talk to him.
Like 5-8.
Hank?
Yeah.
Get out of here 5-8. He's like 5-9 or 5-10. He's not a short guy.
It's just that when you weigh 600 pounds, you're kind of slumped over all the time.
And that big pupa kind of drags you down a little bit.
I think he probably, at least at one time, he probably went about 3-80, M-3-something.
Let's bring Hank back and weigh him every day.
We're back to Humper.

This Miami Hurricanes Basketball Update with Clarence I'm So Pretty Darryl.
Hi, this is Clarence Darryl.
We're going to do a very nice job here.
We're here at the Miami Hurricanes Basketball Game.
And I'm a professional broadcaster that's making about a half a million dollars a year.
Stopped.
Okay, now they're running down the court here.
They go.
You need to be aggressive running down the court.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
They're running so aggressively.
If only you knew what was going through this child's mind right now.
Wow.
Look at those big, tin-y wee men.
I'm so glad sports is the only thing that matters.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
If not, he puts the ball in the basket.
He puts the ball in the basket.
He puts the ball in the basket.
You know what?
What?
He put the ball in the basket.
I'm going to go in the basket.
In a second here when I hear the beep of my microwave, I'm nook and a weeny right now.
That's going to be my lunch.
There you hear it beep.
So I'll fill for like 10 seconds.
I got already a paper towel.
I'm going to either run out of a paper towel.
I weeny.
Really?
Yeah.
That's nice.
Oh my God.
That's not black.
Now the reason I did that is because last time I had like a raw weeny and you guys chewed
me off for eating a cold weeny on here.
That was a long time ago.
Hmm.
What?
The years ago, last time I said anything to you about eating cold weeny.
No you did not.
The years ago.
It was somebody else then recently.
Maybe it was when you were on vacation.
I gave up on that.
Maybe it was.
But I used to eat that all the time.
I think you're porn.
Cold weeny is right out of the fridge.
Did you?
Yeah.
Oh, then it was definitely when you were on vacation because whoever was there was giving me some room.
You know Chris was giving me crab meat.
I eat gosh or something like that.
Are you in Josh?
No.
I eat that when you're poached.
I eat that when I'm money to that I shouldn't be doing.
When you're poached.
When you're right about that.
Huh?
Yeah.
Hmm.
Not something like a weeny baby.
And I'm every flight one goes on to pull.
Don't be eating on the air now because Jolly Joe called you in for another inquisition.
You know.
Was Neola eating on the air again today?
You don't you remember that email I sent you from some I read listeners some old bitch.
Remember that?
Oh yeah.
Everything requires an inquisition.
That's the one thing I don't understand about this man.
Why why have an inquisition about when I had to leave at one o'clock to go on vacation?
Of course not.
I go back on it.
Why?
I don't know.
I still got six weeks left this year by the way.
I'm think I'm going on one right now.
I'm going on vacation.
See ya.
And George is going to spend some wax.
See ya.
When you're on the air it's not good eating a hot weeny.
It's too hot burns your mouth.
It burns.
It burns.
I didn't have time to heat it up in the flavor wave.
That would have been that would have been preferable the way to do it.
And it tastes better that way too.
A weeny is not something that's cooked that cooks well in a microwave.
Am I right?
No I mean the best way is like fry it up.
Fry it up?
Oh yeah.
How about on a grill?
Kill it?
Or am I on a grill?
Yeah, fry it on a grill.
Hmm.
Do you fry it on a grill?
Well you know what I mean let's put you using a frying oil.
It's the same effect.
You're broiling.
Broiling would be good.
The worst, the worst is boiling.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh my god.
Boil it now.
Now old Jews do that.
I don't know if Jews nowadays do that.
Old Jews used to boil weenies.
My mother used to do that.
Oh.
Horrible.
And then all the fat from the hot dog gets into the water.
You know it's like floating around around the top and like,
oh the grease and the schmutz.
Ah.
I don't know if I'm allowed to eat this before Purim.
So better finish it fast.
Now I got my amputech all worked up for that macaroni and cheese.
I know I'm going to have it because you talk me into it.
Then you talk me into a crisp?
Don't do it.
Yep.
So boy there's nothing like that macaroni and cheese it would buy them.
So sure bet.
Now I'm 28 on a pool.
We need 72 votes in 55 minutes.
That's not, that's very doable.
Yep.
Actually if they start coming in in big chunks, which I just accidentally spit out,
truck my weenie on the log here.
Oh not good.
And also on this story.
I'm spitting all over the place.
Gordon Brown has promised that the, see I can't, I can't do him.
I got to clear my throat first.
I got to finish the weenie then I can read these stories.
So probably you should like spin some wax.
I'm not that, but I can keep playing that crap.
Because I dig it.
I don't dig it.
Yeah.
There you go.
That's more like it.
I like it.
That's some, that's some, uh, patty's pool music.
Some springtime Leprechaun, put us some spring neuro step.
Like Larry Craig.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, look at that.
Atlanta's on earth.
They're going to have more severe what I told you.
God has pissed off Atlanta big time.
Now what was the reason I gave the other day why he was pissed off Atlanta?
I don't know.
Fags.
No.
No, because CNN is there.
You better get with it, mister, because the CNN headquarters are there.
Atlanta's on alert.
Streets are, streets are closed as a precaution.
They're right here.
All the wind in the buildings go tumbling in the tornadoes and, uh, and crap.
Another going to have more crap today.
And I could, they deserve it.
Mm-hmm.
Well, it sure took me a long time to eat this wini.
If it was cold, it would already be in my gullet.
What the hell was that?
Oh, filler music.
Okay, I'm done with my wini.
Now I got to wash it down.
You're my really loved.
What's that?
Gasex.
Besides Gasex.
Fresca.
Okay.
How about a fresca?
What about it?
I don't have any more.
I bought three cans.
It's not easy to find fresca here in the big, uh, two-liter bottles, you know?
What's in a while I find it.
But hey, if you can, why don't you read the book?
Toronto Damage Buildings.
Why?
tornado Damage Buildings.
I thought it said Toronto.
I was going to say, hey, look out now.
You are such a pervert of crap.
He was just worried about it.
Yeah, around the vent.
He thought maybe you were falling from the building?
That's right.
That was your building that was showing there.
Believe me, you got to go in there.
If you fall from the building, you'll know about it.
Gordon Brown.
Can I do this story or not?
Are you doing any instead?
Shut up.
Gordon Brown has promised that the British government will hold a full scale inquiry
into the mistakes made in Iraq before and since the invasion five years ago.
His concession marks a significant break from his predecessor Tony Blair,
who said, fastly, be fused to hold a wide ranging inquiry into the war.
Mr. Brown, however, insists it's not the right time for an immediate investigation
as the situation in Iraq remains fragile.
And British troops are still front of the British stability of the country.
The Prime Minister said there's a need to learn all the possible lessons
from the military action in Iraq and its aftermath and how many more people we can kill.
I mean, on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the invasion last night,
Mr. Blair's former chief of staff Jonathan Powell warned it could take decades
to bring calm to Iraq.
He also admitted that the British and US governments had seriously underestimated
the scale of the task before them back in 2003.
There will come a time when it's appropriate to hold an inquiry,
so Mr. Brown, but whilst the whole effort of the government and the armed forces
is directed towards supporting the people in the government of Iraq as they forge a future
based on reconciliation, democracy, prosperity, and security,
we believe that it is not now.
Right, God forbid we should do it now, so the embarrassment.
Oh, look at that.
Severe flooding, boy, the Lord has really pissed off.
What are all those bombs?
Oh, that's bagged out five years ago.
I thought maybe that was Atlanta.
Wouldn't that be something?
Drop out of those babies right there in the middle of CNN headquarters.
Oh, I hope we'll play this great game in there.
That would be really bad.
Not him and that Ali felching queen.
CNN is the anti-crime.
Fox, we know what it is.
Okay, it's a bunch of Nazis and drag, and they're not fooling anybody.
But CNN pretends to be like real news people, you know,
and there's a wolf with all the best, the best up political team
in television yet you should live so long, okay?
You phony baloney.
Get your ass back to the cabuts and go, you know,
wrap your toe, fill it around your neck and cut the crap,
and shave the beard off too.
936 votes on the pool.
The most important lesson I've learned over the years from the Neo-Rodger show is
Religion is for crazy people, 330.
35.2% over a third of this audience have learned from me.
That religion is for, and just look at the world, man.
If you don't believe me, if you think I'm one of those militant atheists,
too bad, just look around.
You don't see the atheists stirring up all the crap in Iraq and in Palestine and in Israel.
Did I say Palestine? Well, what used to be?
Whatever it is.
What is it?
Well, the occupied territories, you know,
but exactly until the supermotoos is real over it, you know.
And Ireland, everywhere, the Indian, India and the Pakistan,
they're packing it, baby, and boy, to some of those people smell bad.
I still can't get over this thing about people who smell bad.
Take a bath, water is cheap, man.
Yeah.
Take a freaking shower once a month, at least.
Religion is for crazy people, 330, too.
Just shut up and cast the checks, 152.

What a waste of a frequency, man.
Could be some really good stuff.
They could have some big numbers over there at 940.
50,000 watts, the best AM signal in the state.
And what do they got on there?
Dreck.
Real cramp.

He's always got that smug look on her face.
I mean, I'd like a white and red offer face with my fist.
First from across this great state.
Need a commander in chief who will end the war in Iraq and bring them.

And grab it.
But something a little hard.
He helped.
He loved to change it.
He embraced it.
And only good thing about it was doing it with processes.
All right.
A big return client.
He liked their books to be giant.
At least 32 pounds in weight.
He liked their books massive.
Aggressive and never passive.
Because he's the king of Ruchi gay.
He knew it.
He knew it.
But he couldn't stop himself.
He had a habit.
And grab it.
Like a little horny.
He loved to change it.
And embrace it.
And only good thing about it was doing it with processes.

Not finger pointing, hyper-grid phony.
How can he just be like a regular guy and go out and screw around and have a good time
without pointing the finger to everybody else?
Like a great clone, somebody a fag, you know.
Or like a Martin Miss Foley or like Charlie Jesus Christ.
You're gay, governor.
Well, I hope we don't get stuck here on this pool 950.
Oh, thank God.
We got over that. That's one hump.
We got 42 minutes for 50 votes.
Anybody ought to be able to do that.
Right, Chris?
Definitely. For show.
Or do it.
Don't sound too cock-sure about it though, because that's a bad, bad altitude to take.
Say what?
What?
What?
What I said.
That's like your real panicking.
Like, oh, gee, we're not going to make it.
So everybody goes rushing to their PC and says, and shoves everybody else in here in the orifice.
Show anybody else out of the way.
That's right.
So let me get to that computer right now so I can go to nirroge.com and vote on that pool.
And then maybe I'll go back to work and maybe not.
Maybe then I'll look at some porn on your computer, you know.
Democrat Barack Obama's big national leader, Rick Hillary Clinton,
is all but evaporated in the U.S. presidential race.
And both Democrats, Trevor, Republican, John McCain, and Coin DeWay.
The Reuters Ogby poll released today.
Like I told you, there's a poll for everybody.
If you don't like this one, look at that one.
If you don't like that one, then I will find another one.
The poll showed Obama held only a statistically insignificant lead of 47 to 44% of his sworey,
down sharply from a 14-point age he held over her in February when he was writing the title of those 10th-rate victories.
Which is how recall was 11 or 12, but nevertheless it's his year 10.
The poll showed Arizona Senator McCain who has clenched the Republican nomination,
is benefiting from the lengthy campaign battle between Obama and Clinton.
We're now battling to win Pennsylvania April 22.
McCain leads in a hypothetical matchup against Obama, 46 to 40%,
and against sworey, 48 to 40%.
The Obama McCain poll is a sharp turnaround from the Reuters Ogby poll last month,
which showed head-to-head Obama would beat McCain 47 to 40.
The last couple of weeks have taken a toll on Obama in a general election matchup.
On both Democrats at polls through John Zogby, see that's what he's doing after he's accomplishing,
is destroying him and destroying the party.
Nice going sworey.
It's not surprising to me that McCain's on top because there's disarray and confusion on the Democratic side, Zogby, said.
The poll showed Obama continues to have strong support from African-Americans,
but is experiencing some stuff that's among moderate independence.
Among independence, McCain led for the first time in a poll, 46 to 36% over Obama.
It was behind McCain by 21% among white voters.
Zogby attributed this to a combination of the fall-off from the sworey victory in Ohio earlier this month,
and the controversy over Jeremiah, whatever's name, is right sermons.
That is named Jeremiah, and is bullfrog.
And just the closer he gets to the nomination, the tough questions whites ask about an African-American candidate, Zogby, said.
But it'll be pitiful to put them out.
Well, who the hell knows?
I just don't see a lot of these red necks voting for a dark guy.
I mean, I could be wrong about that. I sure hope I'm wrong.
And I know for Dan Schruitt that they're not going to vote for her.
No.
They'll like old and sane McCain, man. He's that American hero. He's the POW.
He's the old gray-haired, whatever the hell he is, coot. He's a real coot.
And a real hoot, too, he's got the great sense of humor, you know?
Bom, bom, bom, bom, everywhere. Fill in the blank.
I'm anywhere. Syria, Iran, North Korea, Canada, Mexico.
950-some odd, 54.
And I make it a big push on that poll. See what I'm telling you? You're acting too complacent.
The average price for a gallon of diesel fuel is $4.00 and a 2.5 cent.
Let's take a look at how those markets are doing. We haven't called Rick Riley.
Then got in a... When there'd be something to get Rick Riley on here?
Not... Yeah, well, it'd be something... You said it.
I can't say the word but it would be though.
Oh, Bear Stearns is $5.50 a share.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. All right.
S&P is down 4.5 to $1.50, $7.00 and S&X down 12.
Gold is 948 bucks an ounce.
Why didn't you tell me when gold was like $400 an ounce?
Put all your money in gold.
I did. You did not.
Pressure's not all, actually.
You had a head you did. When did you say that?
I didn't say that.
I didn't say it.
Oh, now you're saying it.
Like when a horse race is over.
Choose different funds.
But it was a long time ago.
After the race was over, I told you he had the winner in every race.
I told you I liked it, 7. I told you.
Yeah, she lives so long.
Oil is only $104.00 and a quarter of a barrel.
What a bargain. Let's go and get a whole bunch of barrels.
Roll out the barrel. Come on.
I want to see what that arrow is.
Now, oh, it's only 156.00 and a half.
And the Canadian is less than the US dollar, 99.31.
Oh, let's go nuts at Woodbuy.
See, that's good because when I withdraw money from my accounts,
it has to be, you know, when Canadian dollars and so if the exchange rate is bad,
I get a screw in it.
And of course, either way, you're going to go.
Well, when I started 10 to be forward, don't pay the dollar a wheel of fortune.
Not that I had some success on, but there's no upside.
You can pour hundreds of dollars in there and there's just not that much upside.
Unless you had a $2 or $3,000 jackpot on there, what are you going to get?
So my suggestion to you guys is take your few dollars to the $5 wheel of fortune machine,
stick it in there and it'll be over in two, three minutes and no.
Okay. All right.
It's a lot less painful that way.
So the sitting there, there's Ricky Tiki-Sansis again with his pre-stop fit.
There you have it, Brianna. The situation. Really? You're on the ground.
The trenches, for Americans, who are having to deal with this.
He is just, I mean, it's just, it's unspeakable, but then again, they'll put anybody on here.
You know, whatever happened to Winnie, Aaron Brown, somebody emailed me on the Myspace about that yesterday.
Where's Aaron Brown? Remember all the Winning he was to do?
Well, to be on ABC on the weekends, I was on CNN.
With his a bad red wig. Oh my God. Even that one would have been embarrassed by that piece.
Some of the most iconic images of the Iraq War come now from photojournalists on the front lines,
but US soldiers carrying point-and-two digital cameras.
And its latest issue, the New Yorker profiles the woman who stepped many of the photos depicting abuse at...
Abu Gharr, rape prison at the same magazine we feel nearly four years ago.
Like many of the soldiers in charge of the detainee of the Raki's at...
Abu Gharr, rape...
Sabrina Harmon had a little experience running a prison.
As Philip Gouravitch and Errol Morris report, she and others in the Army Reserve didn't stick out at the prison
where almost nothing was run according to military doctor.
And there's a lot of other things sticking out.
The low-ranking reserve of soldiers who took and appeared in the infamous images were singled out for a program in punishment.
They were represented in government reports in the press and before court's marshal, as robes were acted out of depravity.
Yet the abuse of prisoners at...
Abu Gharr, rape...
Was de facto US policy.
The authorization of torture and decriminalization of cruel, human and degrading treatment of captives in wartime had been among the defining legacies of the current administration.
And the rules of interrogation that produced the abuse documented on the military intelligence block in the fall of 2003 were the direct expression of the hostility toward international law and military doctrine that was found in a White House and the vice president's office and for high levels of the justice and defense departments.
What they're trying to say I think is that these people are a bunch of butchers and they always blame in somebody else.
Somebody else done it.
Nothing going on hanging for it.
But in the meantime, there were the ones who ordered it and enjoyed it.
They probably used to sit around late at night watching all of the movies, you know.
You know what I'm talking about?
Probably a W and Condoleezza used to sit around Sipin Martinez.
961 on a poll, all we can do, we need 39 votes and 34 minutes.
Even a dead man could do that.
What's their way?
Get vote.
Don't do the spots.
They're out of business.
The biggest name.
The best talent.
You're the real Roger.
This is a really good 560 QAM.
The sports leader.
Presonity and they don't come any worse than Neil Rogers.
What the hell on excess Hollywood?
Hillary, since you've been campaigning nonstop, have you ever feel like you had the time to get sexed up?
Well, I'm a little busy right now.
I hardly have time to sleep.
Hard to find time to have fun on the campaign trail, but occasionally you can sneak that in.
Who are you trying to fool?
For real.
What's the last time you two got your freak on?
2002.
Whoa!
Very disturbing to me.
How's Bill taking this?
I would tell him to take a deep breath, probably two aspirin and get a good night's sleep.
Hillary, you need to get your son.
That's, that's obvious.
I've got a feeling.
When you two finally get a chance to hit it.
I have a feeling it's going to be very interesting.
The sky will open.
The light will come down.
Celestial choirs will be singing.
And the world will be perfect.
Explosive action.
And I think we need to get laid.
You're fair.
It's 131 and 560, though.
Remember when she was a mock in the fact that Obama's a great speaker and so on and so forth and all that?
All of the skies are open and the angels will come down and all this other crap, you know?
That's her response.
As opposed to the fact that she's whiny and shrill and the half of the country hates her like poison.
But nevertheless, right.
967 votes on Chris' pool.
He's 969.
You need only 31 votes in 28 minutes.
That's barely more than one minute.
We can do it.
Look at that Jefferson County Missouri man.
They're like all in row votes and stuff.
They're like drowning over there.
I think this is the great flood.
You better call up Noah.
You better get Noah on the phone.
Okay, that old drunk telemetry.
Call him its poor him.
Get out the wine in the home and toss him.
Or maybe call up Esther.
Okay, tell her Esther that we didn't even do something to him.
You know, this throughout the Bible was always, always God was telling the Jews.
It was the Egyptians.
It was this one to smite all the enemies.
Kill them all.
Right.
You remember that?
Of course I remember.
Everybody was just kissing around the Jews and of course if that's the way it was then, so, you know.
Y'all started it.
And Bigger Furn.
Y'all started it.
Y'all?
Yeah, you crossed that river.
You started crap up.
You picking on Moses again?
Mm-hmm.
He didn't get to, you know.
God punished him for being a big nut.
Bigger.
You picked up what about Abraham?
What about over Solomon?
Oh yeah, God punished him, all right.
How about Solomon's minds?
How about King Solomon's minds?
No, it's minds.
There's the anti-war protesters in the, what is it called, Marx of the dead in Washington?
In Washington, DC.
That's only just said.
On the fifth anniversary of President Bush's invasion of Iraq, the president said he had been
no doubts about waging the unpopular war despite the high cost in lives and treasure.
In other words, all the blood on his hands and all the money that we've pee down the toilet.
Vice President Dick Cheney, Cheney, had a different message, informed during Good Morning
American, to be broadcast today, that two thirds of Americans now think the war wasn't
worth fighting, Cheney said, so, you know, something he is a real bastard.
Yeah.
So you don't care what the American people think, ABC's Martha Raditz asked, he added,
I think we can't be blown off course by the fluctuations of the public opinion polls.
There has in fact been fundamental change in transformation and improvement for the better.
That's a huge accomplishment.
Right.
Cheney added that the economy was going through a rough patch.
There's no question about it.
The Vice President is in Oman.
Today he went fishing in the waters between Oman and Iran, borrowing the sultan of Oman's 60-foot
roll yacht.
It's a hard job, man, but somebody's got to do it.
Cheney's spokeswoman told the Associated Press that the Vice President and his wife, Lynn
and daughter Liz, you're fairing.
A former State Department official is traveling with her father as a private citizen, headed
out under sunny skies into the Gulf of Oman on Kingfish I, owned by sultan Kabus bin Syed,
Kingfish I.
It sounds like something from the Jefferson's, doesn't it?
Right.
Something from Stepan Fetchan.
Amesan Andy.
What?
Amesan Andy.
Yeah, Amesan Andy, that's right.
Cheney's had a personal relationship with the sultan going back to the time when the Vice
President was defense secretary, but the sultan didn't go along on a fishing trip.
He's probably counting all the cash that they left behind in the world palace.
Oman allows the U.S. to use four air bases, including one just 50 miles from Iran, for refueling
logistics and storage of pre-position military supplies.
He's out there fishing on the out, your Vice President, and saying, hey, with American people
don't like it, so what?
Who cares, okay?
How a burden liked it.
Cala Brown and Ruth, they liked it.
That could tell.
That could tell liked it.
That's right.
I could tell them liked it.
Kishmer and Tuckas liked it.
And anyway, that's your Vice President for him, and a real butcher or real thief.
They still have my glasses fixed, yet.
I think, send them back with a wrong earpiece.
Sorry about that.
Me too.
Because these glasses I got now, they are with a cramp.
What?
They mean temples, right?
Didn't we get that out?
Yeah, temples, so what about it?
I call it...
Look, they're...
They need the temple for Purim, okay?
It's only Wednesday.
Don't start with the temples.
Don't start playing so Jewish for the audience, alright?
They know better.
Aroha, toh.
The Aronoil, Ohanumel Ha'ulam, Aashir Kedi Shaka, Bami-Svo-Taw, Bibi-Paribu-Pi-Bah,
Bibi-Paribu-Pi-Bah, Pukki-Andred, 973 votes on a pool.
Let's see how it's going.
975, they're coming in now.
See, now we've got the numbers turned around.
Now you only need 25 minutes in 24...
What do you need?
Like one a minute.
And you'll have your thousand.
Don't this is going to be a miracle, the likes of which even King Solomon
would be amazed and astonished by it.
Even now what's his name?
Aroha-No.
Remember, Aroha-No was looking at that...
What was he looking at?
The ball caught him.
The ball caught him.
He said, Oi-Govalt.
And they opened it up and it was like an empty wine bottle.
And it wasn't even managed to share it.
So I think it was like...
It's grown up, boom.
Something like that.
It was, you know, it was ripple.
And that's the best alcapone could afford.
What kind of a bank robber drinks ripple anyhow, huh?
Well, he didn't.
He made a lot of money.
He didn't spend any of it.
No, I know people like that.
976 on Chris' pole.
Oh, there's Ahmadina Jad.
And isn't it ironic, Mr. Debat?
Here we are standing where Saddam Hussein wants to.
And he built these cars.
Look at this.
Kira Phillips, Ahmed Jernalist, man.
She's standing there with her fatigues and a stupid CNN cat.
And her hair...
Shmere through the back of the cat there.
She's a journalist in Iraq.
This is what CNN gives the world.
It's Kira Phillips.
And they got her on a split screen with Ahmedina Jad on the other side.
U.S. Iran, do you truly believe, to the Prime Minister truly believe,
that you can talk with this President?
We are paying the price of some of adversaries with Iran.
Iran is having a problem with the Arabs.
We are paying her to Nera.
We have problems with that.
Speaking of English, baby, I can't understand a damn thing you say, man.
I can't deal with that.
You know, speak of English.
And don't speak no frog.
Now, there are some real good ones for the French.
They never met a terrorist they didn't like.
You know that?
Am I right about that?
You are.
The French never met a terrorist that they didn't love.
Not just like the love.
They shower them with love.
Kisses and flowers.
9.76 on a pool.
Let's crank it up, baby.
What biggest name?
The best talent.
Kira Phillips is in her projects.
4.560 QAM.
The sports leader.
Push the bar's a knife.
I was spending my fun making my car run.
But I didn't get real far.
I got a crummy deal, thinking these four-wheel.
Maxing out my car can't drive around till the crack goes down.
I thought it could, but I was wrong.
With their pumping, got my wallet drinking.
So I stopped here at Exxon.
And I said,
Exxon is making me poor.
Makes me worried, tapping out my cashflow.
It makes me grow when my tax below.
Cause it ain't up the last of my dough.
Exxon is providing gas.
Your home paycheck only fills up a half-bang.
It's no other control.
All the corner fans asking,
Exxon, please don't raise it again.
143.560 WQM.
Thank you, Mr. President, again, for those low-gas prices.
We hooked up the American...
And we got nothing.
We got squat.
We got a lot of blood in it, though.
Maybe that's what we got in the pipeline is the blood.
Maybe?
Think? Say the oil?
Maybe try to put a bunch of blood in your gas,
think she what happens.
Stick your arm in there.
So here's the facts from it.
It says,
I'm not going to sign bats in the velvety.
I like that.
If George Regouvern had to drop running rate,
Tom Eagleton in 72, because it was discovered
that Eagleton had electro-shock therapy for depression,
then why don't we find out what to be at Kong
did to McCain at the Henry Hilton?
Yeah, that's a good point.
Although, you know something?
I don't think he can win a first election.
Even though the poll show in the head of both of the Democrats right now,
that's because all this divisiveness and crap going on.
What you think?
Indeed.
I mean, once the public realizes that he's...
...and out of control maniac, and it's...
he wants four more years of bush.
Well, once they see that, I think they're going to go running
and screaming and shrieking and carrying on.
Like a bunch of crazed lunatics, just like that.
994-year-oldy six votes away.
There's no point even talking about 997.
Look at that.
All right.
Sixty minutes for three votes.
We could do that with our hands tied behind our back,
which is the way we do the show every day.
So why the hell not?
Right.
Got my shoes on.
My pantalonies.
My shirt.
My watch.
What more do you need?
Nothing.
Got your underwear.
Got my underwear?
Is the U.S. Postal Service approves more than 10,000 requests from U.S. law enforcement
each year to record names and addresses.
Another information from outside of packages every year.
A quoted information released through the Freedom of Information Act request.
The warrantless surveillance mail program, as it is known,
requires only the approval of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service Director and not a judge.
Since 1998, the inspectors approved more than 97% of requests during criminal inquiries,
new documents show court of USA Today, which filed a request in 2004,
5, and 6, the most recent year provided.
Officials read at least 99.5% of requests.
The idea of government tracking that amount of mail is quite alarming.
Director of the ACLU's National Security Project, Emil Jaffer, told paper,
when you realize the figure does not include national security matters,
the numbers are even more alarming.
Officials were not to disclose how much mail was monitored in national security
or terror-related investigations.
Under the Patriot Act, those who received letters notifying them
that they were being investigated often were gagged from even reported or being targeted.
They gagged them.
Responded to the USA Today request for the national security related data,
inspection service counsel Anthony Elverno wrote that even revealing the frequency of their surveillance
one undermined its effectiveness to the detriment of the government's national security interests.
There's reason to believe more mail may be being opened as well.
In late 2006, the signing statement issued by President Bush suggested that
his office had expanded the executive branch's power to open mail without a warrant.
The signing statement accompanied HRS-64-07,
the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006,
which reiterated a prohibition in opening first-class mail without a warrant.
In 96, the Postal Regulations were altered to permit the opening of first-class mail without a warrant,
and nearly to find cases where the postal inspector believes there's a credible threat
that the package contains dangerous material like Una Bomba,
bomb is the ACLU's Senate press release at the time.
Instead of referencing the narrow exception of the postal regulation,
the President's signing statement suggests that he's assuming broader authority to open mail without any warrant.
In January 2007, the ACLU and Senate for National Security Studies filed a Freedom of Information Act
requesting information regarding any additional warrantless mail surveillance.
They're listening to your phone calls, they're reading your emails, they're checking your blackberry,
they're opening up your mail, they're checking the library to see what books you're checking out,
they're going to the bookstore, the adult bookstore to see what videos you're taking home,
and who's screwing on them, all this stuff like that.
Part of these things.
And guess how many votes we got on the poll?
Ooooo!
Right.
Thousand.
Three, even.
Oh.
I have to refresh it.
What?
A one.
Thousand three.
See that?
You have a little faith.
I told you to begin in the show we can do a thousand, and you said you're crazy.
Yeah, well, you know.
One of these things I learned.
You have a little faith.
The Dalai Lama threatened yesterday to step down as leader of Tibet's government
and exile of violence committed by Tibetans in his homeland spirals out of control.
What are we going to do with the Dalai Lama steps down?
And goodbye, Dalai.
Yeah, yeah.
And what are we going to do then?
I don't know.
The writing prompted Premier Wenjibau to announce the Dalai Lama supporters as separatists
and accused them of instigating the violence in Tibet's capital of Lassa, which China's
highest level response to date to the unrest.
Did you see them on the horses writing in there like something from the dark ages?
No.
You haven't seen that?
No.
The Thai Bentons?
No.
The Dalai Lama, speaking to reporters, urged his countrymen to show restraint so that if things
become out of control, his only option is to completely resign.
Leader one of his top-aids clarified the Dalai Lama's comments,
if the Thai Bentons were to choose the path of violence he would have to resign because he's completely committed to nonviolence.
He would resign as the political leader in the head of state, but not as the Dalai Lama.
He will always be the Dalai Lama.
Just like I'll always be?
No, good.
You'll always be or whatever you are.
That's right.
This guy here.
Right.
The recent protests that Tibet and capital Lassa led by monks began peacefully March 10th on the anniversary of a field,
1959, uprising against Chinese rule.
But they grew increasingly violent, culminating Friday with widespread street violence.
Chinese officials say 16 people were killed, but the Dalai Lama government in the next half put the total at 80.
What the hell?
Who wants to live in Tibet, you know?
Richard here?
Is Richard here live there?
Why is that?
I got a lot of dirt on him.
No, he visits.
He's a Buddhist at least he says.
He's a Buddhist?
I don't know any Buddhists.
I know a lot of people who say they are.
I wonder if I have time.
How long is this?
I don't know a lot of people.
This here is no holiday, David.
Reporting live from Washington, sit down, comic booker Brian is about to appear before a senator oversight committee for violating the privilege of speech,
with such low-down, dirty fits as the condolizards song and the sort of mobets.
He's getting out of the car now.
Hey, Brian.
Listen to you.
Isn't it true you are some place of comic pink old assenda who poops holes in the fabric about a United corporate empire?
I find white potato salad to be more appealing than yellow.
Now sit here with the press.
You better take a seriously pal.
And besides that I can't pop my first question.
Well then how about the Chantilly Crowley wrench-aided defeat?
How dare you make light of what we want to be in a serious situation over here?
The Sarah Selvamon really thinks she's beautiful.
With light heaven, you dare toy with us?
Let me remind you, we are the press.
What's that we are?
Go back to your cubicles and tell everybody war as good in the economy has never been better.
Why I'll have you know it's our job to tighten that going of headlines if the tasty human coated toy.
Speaking of that, you think the lever come out with the molded blade and may lock?
Let's, let's, we are leaving.
You won't come out to play with us.
Okay, 150, 10, 4, 1, yeah, before two, whatever the hell time it is, a QM.
We got a little different schedule day.
We got the jerk show coming up at two, but then we got the D.A. show for the mad dog.
Four to seven in John Linder in the nine to midnight slot after the massive tune out.
Dolphins all asses, seven to nine.
Isn't that the tune out for show?
Dress delivery, drug trafficking, migrants smuggling, US customs and border protections supposed to stop these types of crimes instead.
So many of its officers have been charged with committing these crimes themselves that there was a Washington recently issued in order
about the disturbing events and the increase in the number of employee arrests.
Thomas S. Winkowski, assistant commissioner of field operations, wrote a memo to more than 20,000 officers nationwide
noted that employees must behave professionally at all times, even when out on the job, not on the job.
Even when drinking apple juice.
It is our responsibility to uphold the law.
It is not break the law when Kowski wrote the November 16 memo obtained by the Miami Hero.
When Kowski's memo sites employees arrest involving domestic violence, DUI and drug possession.
A court record show customs officers know the Department of Homeland Security employees from South Florida, the Mexican border,
have been charged with dozens of far more serious offenses.
Among them, a customs and border protection officer for a lot of the Ohio State Department with charges in February,
with conspiring to assist the New York drug ring under investigation by tapping in a sensitive federal databases.
How do you like that?
This is Homeland Security, man. Do you feel safe?
All the time.
Let's go into the house where we'll feel safe and locked at door and hide under the bed.
All you kids in school, man, hide under your desk, back like they showed us in the 50s when they were going to drop the nukes back during the cold war.
Hide under the desk. We'll let you know when it's safe to come out.
Thousand nine votes on the pool, but I've said it. That's a real feather in my ass.
That's a real curly wild feather. And Chris's fat ass too. All the feathers all the time.
Don't you feel like we had a major accomplishment today?
Yes.
I'll tell you when my accomplishment started when Clarence came in this morning and said,
you don't have to work on Friday. I said, well, that sounds like a major accomplishment to me.
And then George said, yeah, but it was only a two-hour show.
And I thought, well, it's like a minor accomplishment to me.
Thank you, man. I'll take you to Philadelphia.
There are 256-2-A-M.

us go spice apart, let us go spice apart, let us go spice apart Don't waste, left and right, left and right, right, leave
Oh
Well they're supposed to be some words here, but I forgot because I spoke to you much fine
I lived a lot of balloons and everybody out there was smoking five you fair
That's
