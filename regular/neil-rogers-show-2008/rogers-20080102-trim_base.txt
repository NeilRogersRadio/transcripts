And by the way, Brainstorm, don't worry about synility, man. It hits us all too and we're later.
I am not gay, I never have been gay.
Boba Boba Boba Brands, Boba Boba Brands, 6000 thoughts, you fairy.
Uncontrollable, oily discharge.
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
Well, the hardest part of my job is to connect a rack to the wall on terrains.
Love me and agree with me.
You need me for the home.
You fairy.
Hey, she is a handsome woman.
The boy.
The boy.
The boy.
The boy.
The boy.
The boy.
The boy.
The boy.
This were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.
It's just as long as I'm the dictator.
You're a bitch.
You're a bitch.
I'm not gay, I never have been gay.
Gain, gain, gain, gain, not gay, not gay.
K, K, K, K, K, K, K.
Hey, that's a good looking guy.
Get, get, get, get.
I hear the voices, voices, voices, voices, voices, voices, voices.
I'm a commander, guy.
We are the Moon and Earths, and our culture is advanced beyond all that you can possibly comprehend with 100% of your brain.
That's how we define common-audible brain.
What did your racket do with what?
A long, long trace of it.
Tell me.
Oh, God, what did anybody tell you?
Oh, my God, my insides are on fire!
No, please, no more, no more.
Get the phone. Call my mother.
Okay, okay.
I think it's all God.
I think it's all God.
I don't want it.
I don't want it.
Peter, I need you to hold my ear.
Peter, I need you to hold my ear.
Oh, God.
Look, yes, what?
I don't want it.
Tell 4-560 WDQ.
I'm happy New Year.
First show of the New Year, Wednesday, January the 2.
Aren't you excited about that?
No.
No.
Let's just take another few days off yesterday.
Oh, I look good.
It's pretty boring yesterday.
God.
I'm so glad this time of the year is over with.
Oh, I know you're a party pooper.
You just die with that.
That's right.
I'm a party pooper.
Or just a pooper.
WDQA.
I'm happy New Year.
Nobody on there.
See?
There were a whole bunch of them running there for a second.
I thought, that must be a mistake.
They must be talking about the bull games yesterday.
I haven't watched any of those bull games.
I watched that make believe hockey game in Buffalo.
What a concept.
Snow in Buffalo in the winter time.
How unusual.
Idiots.
It's smack to desperation the whole thing.
Oh, but there were 73,000 people there.
Yeah.
And if they brought a pair of binoculars, they could actually see a little
what was going on on the ice.
And I used the term ice loosely because there was like snow all over during the
winter.
Oh, brother.
Just the pathetic Gary Bedman, tragic.
And the fact that it counted for three points in the standings, it was a regulation tie.
So Buffalo and Pittsburgh each got a point.
And then Pittsburgh got the extra point for when we were shoot out.
Playing in snow.
But never do I say just go to show how desperate they are.
Got a lot of things to say, but I probably better not say.
And Clarence was in the season this morning and some sales holes too.
How do you like that?
Clarence's best line was, well, what was the exact line?
I don't want to misquote him.
I don't know.
There was some other chance that you're staying.
Oh, yeah.
Sure.
In case you stay.
Yeah, there's a chance you're going to get smart too, Clarence, but I wouldn't count on that either.
Come to QAM.
Hello.
QAM, is there anybody alive out there?
Hello.
Yeah, this is Frank from Miami.
And I wanted to say this morning I have to go here for a small.
Well, back to you, Frank.
Yeah, and just to think how fast is here might be going because we're already in January.
But I wanted to make a comment.
Yeah, this is your flight by.
Yeah.
I wanted to make a comment about Cam camera and I suppose we're doing it.
Oh, I'll do it on a sports show.
Okay, this is one of them.
Idiot.
Schmuck, I take back the happy new year, by the way.
How do you like that?
Yeah.
You know something I'm going to get out of my system too.
In fact, you know, we make these new years resolutions.
This whole sports illness.
It's a, it's a, it's like a mental.
It's like a disease.
Like a disease.
And like I told you a long time ago and I've been saying it over and over again.
I said it before to show this morning.
We've been on the wrong station for a long time.
Okay.
Yeah.
Now, see, you don't have any credibility in this because you know they sports spectator family.
Like I am having for many, many years.
Right.
You know, so you know, so it could have been anything.
Any other one topic will fill in the blank.
I would have had just as much of a problem.
This isn't a sports station.
This is an insane station.
These are crazy people.
That's a cult.
That's all they know.
There's nothing else in the world that's going on that they are capable to talking about.
That's all they know.
Oh, did you see the fight?
Did you see the game?
Did you see the, yeah, right.
What, whichever one happens to be?
Just mind blowing.
We don't care about scam Cameron or about bill Parcells or any of that crap on this show.
These are four hours a day.
They had a kid.
Yeah, I got to tell you something.
I didn't tell anybody.
Norma Kent, who's a real pansy.
Norma Kent in one of his phone calls, I don't know, a week ago whenever the hell was.
He says to me, and of course this is actually a spoken Joyce, which we don't, you know, we can't reveal the nuts and bolts of that conversation.
Although, if the two of them were talking about nuts, well, they weren't any.
But anyway, so Norma calls and says, well, you know, you've been privileged and blessed for several years to be, you know, making this kind of a...
I've been privileged and blessed.
I do like that.
See the way I look at it is this radio station has been privileged and blessed to have this show under station for 10 years.
You know what I'm saying?
Yep.
That's the way I look at it.
They've been privileged and blessed.
I haven't been privileged or blessed.
I've been cursed.
And for him, my agent lawyer slash Faggot to be calling me up and making a song and an answer about, well, you know, you've been...
That's just a cop out is what it is, Norma, just an excuse for you're being a weakling, for being a 199-pound weakling, a 220-pound tub of weakness.
That's what that is, Norma.
Happy New Year, by the way.
God.
Privileged and blessed.
Remember that song by Precious and Few?
Privileged and blessed?
Dada, that's not my word.
Remember that?
Yes.
Precious and Few was nothing real so I'm flying back to you.
Who did I say it was by?
I don't know.
My Precious and Few.
Well, whatever.
There it is.
Precious and Few are the people that I would have IQ larger than their thumbnail and sports nerd radio.
Depend on this.
See, I can barely even hear it.
It's so low in the back and I'll clock it up in the next one or the other.
Cranked all the way up.
You know, crank is the word.
Quite a climax.
QA and Hello.
This is a Scablet bike lineback.
Yeah.
White House hopeful Dennis Kocinich.
This is an important news.
Who's not likely to survive a first round of abouting in Thursday's Democratic Iowa caucus.
That's tomorrow.
Today told the supporters to back Senator Barack Obama's their second choice.
A little bit of a little Dennis.
Well, Kocinich was barely pulling any back, any backing quarter of the polls.
He was like a statistical, like kind of like a Joel Feinberg.
A statistical asterisk.
Thereby making it likely he would make the 15% threshold vote needed to be delegates, his
vote is going for a ban on a second round.
Could be critical for a ban coming out of Iowa ahead of swallowing and jotted words.
Who said it spoke to an anti-Junovitz said the deal was finalized today.
Obama called him about 2 p.m. central time to thank him for his support, meaning yesterday.
And making the second choice deal with a ban with Kocinich decided not to do a replay of 2004,
where his followers were asked to support Edwards' their second choice, helping to provide
Edwards with his margin for coming in second.
In a statement, Obama said, I have a lot of respect for Congressman Kocinich.
And I'm honored he's done this because we both believe deeply in the need for fundamental change.
That's right.
And when he was asked if he wanted to say anything else about Kocinich, you know what he said?
Oh, he's a little jai, kind of funny look.
Right.
But other than that, I think Obama's going to win.
That's what the new polls are shown in Iowa tomorrow on the caucus.
Good.
That's what he's going to take it right up the old...
Back them.
Shoot.
Okay, let's see how the polls are doing here, okay?
Everybody's got polls.
We got our polls.
We got the new Iowa poll.
We got polls up the old earlobe.
Once you have won New Year's Resolution this year was our poll over the couple of days, New Year's and yesterday.
We had a thousand thirty nine votes, by the way.
Lose weight three hundred and thirty seven.
Don't have any resolutions three sixteen.
That's right.
Why make it because we break them anyway?
Right.
Although I haven't been to Woodbine yet for the New Year, I didn't say I was never going again, by the way.
Did I say that?
No.
I said I'm cutting way back.
Half more sex hundred and twenty seven.
Well, I haven't started on that one yet either, but I'm thinking about it.
Of course, I'm always thinking about it.
Who isn't?
Right.
Get a new job ninety three.
Find a mate fifty three.
Stop drinking your drugs forty three.
Do more drugs forty one.
I was sure I asked them sure he's off for a good start.
Yep.
And get into Horace twenty nine.
Well, when you do more drugs, generally, or at least it was smelly nasty divorce.
No, here keeps you together.
Why?
I said, how's it going, eh?
Don't start the New Year on a negative note.
Be positive like me.
I'm positive.
I'm positive.
I'm positive.
I'm positive.
I'm positive.
I'm positive.
I'm positive.
I'm positive.
Joe Bell, we took a poll before the show today.
We decided he's the biggest lung kid in the history of this business.
I worked for several lung kids in my time, Stanley Cohen, uh, Kim Williams.
Oh, I worked for some of the biggest, uh, Lou Kron.
Oh, I'm sorry, his kid works at power.
And Lou Kron.
He's a good guy though.
Well, his son.
Yes.
Well, so don't the blame him for his daddy being lunged.
I have a good.
But Joe Bell's got him all beat sideways to a hell.
The biggest lung kid, the biggest zero,
whoever came down to Pike.
Today's poll, and we've done this before, but I'm digging out the oldies for the New Year.
It's the first time we did it this year.
Speaking of sex.
628 votes.
Do you consider yourself exclusively heterosexual for the 80s?
Bisexual 56.
Now it's interesting how bad the first time we did this bisexual, he had 23.
A lot of buys out there now.
I'll be sure of 39.
Exclusively homosexual only 34 or 5.4%.
And first time we did this 7.3%.
We're losing the homos.
By the way.
And asexual 19.
By the way, why those those nut shores?
Yeah.
Bisexual.
No.
Yeah.
Okay.
Just like those bisexuals.
Yeah, come to terms with it.
Right.
There you go.
Even anonymously even on a poll like this, which nobody knows.
Sure.
Even anonymously.
That's called really in the cloud.
Deepen.
The very back of your thumb in the Roger.
Behind the house, Nick Graham.
The fourth leader.
Greg H.
For all the dead, the dead beat aradise.
Only good for a quick visit or to die.
Routing man, grilled swatts in hell.
You want and pass out from just one wave.
All that frankly jolt, angry Cubans who welcome you with the shady things.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So hard you stink and smell.
I'm off to the great white north to luck.
And as I watch you die.
I'm on the way to the edge.
Then the soda is dry.
Oi.
Okay, 1018.
I just nuke my bacon.
Uh-huh.
Where's George?
Still joisin?
Oh my god.
Are you kidding me?
No.
I'm just gonna get up and go get it because the little beaker went off, you know?
Which means it is ready?
George is back rejoicing.
Um, yeah, I guess, uh, you know, he tried to go earlier and it must have been full because he had to come back at the end.
So I guess he finally found an opening and uh, an opening?
Yeah.
Back to him.
Well, I guess we all, they're like, no, it's his man. Everybody's got one.
Uh-huh.
Like opinions.
Okay, let's preview that great new schedule on QAM, shall we?
Sure.
We had the big dog all by himself this morning. What an improvement that is.
Jesus, I didn't hear any of it.
Well, I listen.
I don't want to rip Allison to bed because it's not her fault, but nevertheless, what was she giving you a song to dance about how Hank apologized at the end for cutting me short?
He didn't do that.
We listened to the end of the show.
Not that he was me and the apology.
I think she was trying to say that he apologized like he felt bad when they went into the break after.
He didn't say anything about that.
Not on the air.
No, but no.
So what those are made?
I don't know.
Allison.
Allison.
I felt bad.
I felt bad because I felt like, I mean, not that I need the airtime.
I got home four hours every day, but I was asked to call him and they did, you know, I'm Monday after the organization's standhank in the back like they're doing to me.
And it was his last show on QAM.
And so they had a bunch of people calling to say, hey, all the best, Hank, you're great.
We love you.
Buh-buh-buh.
And good luck.
Well, yeah, it's a nice thing to do.
And certainly management wasn't behind it.
Because management wishes it's all the worst luck.
They wish it's so a wicked death.
Just like I wish Joe Bell, while screaming bloody diarrhea every day the rest of his life.
Maybe he's the one that was in there tapping his toe in the Georgia stall.
Blowing out gallons of oozing bloody diarrhea.
But at any rate, so I called it Hank about five o'clock on Monday to say, best of luck.
And we've worked together for 100 years and you're a great guy.
You'll be fine, but Buh-buh-buh.
You'll be okay.
Just a joke around a little bit.
Just like what he called in here on Monday morning.
Remember that? Yes you do.
Mm-hmm.
And I was on for, I don't know.
And then they say two minutes.
So it had to be the fastest two minutes of my life.
It seemed like seconds.
Well, I haven't really listened to that.
There wasn't no two minutes.
I think it was probably what's about two minutes.
We can try and find out what time it should make.
What differences it make.
The bottom line is I had barely had time to say hello and goodbye.
Oh, we got Don Shula here.
Buy me a meal.
Hey, Coach.
Oh, you know.
Shula.
I just love Shula's lack of a response when he said all that was Neil Rogers.
See, and I didn't hear that, of course, because I was going to go up there.
Right.
I mean, I could have come rushing back in here and caught up with the delay.
But I'm not the, you know, I don't need to hear the sound of my own voice.
Yeah, well, you say goodbye and you pull down a...
Oh!
He frees up Don Shula and he's like, he's like, so that guy that was, that call that was dressed on.
He thinks it's okay to cheat.
And he's like, oh, well, that's Neil Rogers.
And there was like silence for about two seconds.
And they're like, oh, it's low-hank how you're doing, you know, it's the same.
Like, just, there was no one to know why.
I just wasn't conscious.
Yeah.
As usual, he was in the brainstem.
Needs help.
We need some help.
Oh, my God.
So sad.
But, yeah, it's Don Shula.
I mean, can I compete with Don Shula?
No way.
And he was on.
For an eternity, I'm sure.
I didn't hear him.
No, I think all the calls were about the length of your...
Get out of here.
He must have been on for like 10 minutes.
I should have come running in here.
Listen to it.
You should have.
Not.
We get by the well-wanted doing that.
For nine and a half minutes.
You can buy the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, hang-cloth day.
On CD.
What are you talking about?
I'm sure they're gonna sell it.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, they're gonna sell it.
Yeah, of course.
Don Shula, I got news for you, man.
The 72 dolphins couldn't lick the patriots' ass.
Okay.
Not even close.
And you couldn't lick Bill Belichex.
I asked either brainstem.
See, I think, I think he reasoned he pretends he doesn't remember who I am because of the fact that I was one of the few people who had the balls to go on here and say,
Hey, they fired Shula when he tried to act like, you know, like he retired.
They fired your ass, okay?
Cranky old coot.
I gotta go with my bacon, okay?
You got something in your bag?
No, George, still in the back of it.
Hold on, it's like, holy cow.
He must be really joy, he must be rejoicing from the holidays.
Go grab your bacon.
Why don't you go get something to feel?
I'll be right back.
So how many people out there wanna hear the...
The O'Rike is calling for a painful worship?
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b

there'll be pages about Hank Goldberg and the Aronjers, there won't even be like an
asterisk about Jolly Jobelle. I could be wrong about that but I don't think so.
Lunkhead, been a lot of Lunkheads in this business just another fat ass Lunkhead come down
to Pike. He's gonna show the beesleaves, he's gonna save them all this money baby, all
these overpaid Jews, we're gonna get them all off there, well, whatever.
Whatever makes you happy baby, because somewhere a year from now at this time we're gonna
be on some of the radio station kicking your ass.
That's just the most biggest name.
You ever tell me that?
No, no.
4.560 QAM.
The Force Leader.
The Lord even loves Neorodgers.
The Lord even loves Neorodgers.
You're fair.
He's gonna take a long time.
He did eyes it though, he's into Nile, that Rondrie said he never took it in the
NEEDLE LETTERS. 1031 at 560 WQAM. Happy a Wednesday, happy January 2nd, happy new year from
all your good friends. I started to give the schedule and I did Georgia or something.
Yeah I'm back.
Celebrating.
What was going on there?
I could make something funny up for you know, just for what you will.
Well I couldn't get in there see somebody was marathoning in there before the show.
Oh, it was him and Jolly Jo and that poor guy.
I kept going and they were wearing ugly tennis shoes and he's got his own private
John anyway, but I kept trying to go and somebody was in that stall and you know how I can't
use the handicrapper because it's too tall.
Too tall?
Yeah, my feet days long.
I can't do any holds on there though.
Did the handlebars?
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, I need a nice low throne.
Thank you very much.
And I'm done.
Everything's you know, it just took a while to get in there for the moment.
You should be having this experience because my stomach is grumbling too right?
Maybe it's this nukeable bacon.
Did I pick that?
Did you find my Schneider's by the way, Chris?
He's not here.
I think it's his turn.
He didn't tell me where he was going.
He just you know, I walked past him as I was coming back.
Yeah, he made a mad day.
I don't know where he's going.
Maybe he went downstairs to smoke a joint.
I have no idea.
Go on here today.
How many zero-over guys?
That's what you think.
Nothing worse than two in your own horn.
That's where Ron Jeremy told me.
You know who else told me that?
Who?
I'm here.
Another Ron.
Oh boy.
More Ron.
Oh yeah.
QIAM, hello.
Hey buddy, how are you?
Okay, how are you doing?
Not too bad.
I was just wondering.
Sounds like she meant again.
No.
No.
No.
You ever called while you were dumping by the way George?
Oh, yeah.
Sorry I missed it.
Yeah.
And?
Oh and that guy just vanished.
Yeah, he was legit but he just disappeared.
Sure.
QIAM, hello.
Neil God.
Yes.
Happy New Year, Dave.
Same to you.
I missed you.
Crossover with Hank and I always enjoyed it.
Chris mentioned that you might have that on tape.
So if you could play that up here.
Crossover.
Did you call in there on Friday?
Yeah, I called in.
I was on for about, you know, a minute and a half and then Shula called in and they blew me
off.
Oh, that's too bad.
That's not anyway.
Born to Hank so happy New Year, too buddy.
And same to you.
Hank will be missed badly and see Mad Dog as much as I love him and as great as he is and he
really is excellent.
The fact of the matter is that last time they tried that four to seven when he was following
two hours of dead air with that and before that it was dead.
So that's all right.
That didn't do all that great.
See when he follows me with a big lead and he's manages to hang onto a big party.
Part of that audience.
But when we invite the audience to tune out for a couple of hours, a lot of times they
forget to come back, especially when the tremendous promotional job that they've stationed at
the hotel.
So here's the new lineup today.
We have a big dog all by himself, seven to ten tomorrow.
He was on all by himself this morning.
But I'm still here at 10 to two.
The Jack Show, Jason Jackson 2 to 4, Jack's Dirk's whatever his name is, he's on 2 to 4.
Then Mad Dog like I said, 4 to 7.
The office all access is still on because Wayne's got the place last dude.
With John Linder, seven to only half hour tonight.
Oh, that's right.
We got Kane's basketball.
Maybe that's why clearance came in.
It tells we got Kane's basketball.
That's always got a big audience.
Starts with a, oh, Kane's warm up at 7 30.
Kane's in Penn at 8 o'clock.
There must be a home game.
You know how I deduce that?
How?
Because clearance is there.
Hey, you're very good.
Oh, Chris is back.
Where'd you go?
I was doing some Josh Cordis work.
You know, I just wrote Brandon and said that when I was out getting the bacon,
that you were promoting that you were going to play my call to Hank.
Uh-huh.
And I wrote it back in a message.
I said, you're trying to be the next Josh Cordis.
No, I asked people if they would like to hear the Hank call.
And what Cordis work were you doing?
Um, doing with the stream online where like, you know, when we go into commercial break,
we have other commercials that are allowed to be heard online.
Taxes in California, by the way, we both got a big, oh, everything's fine.
We're a stream in it.
No dropouts.
Yeah.
Well, we had a bunch of them that, um, expired on the new year.
And I guess he's not here.
He's not coming or something.
So he asked if I could pull them out of the stream and then we see him.
I'll say you're wanting that Cordis, man.
He was in New York last week.
That was the excuse when George was on vacation.
He couldn't help us out.
And now here it is.
It's already the middle of the week, the new year's starting.
And he's also a, a wall.
Everybody's a wall.
So the new year, baby, it's January the 2th.
The freaking holidays are over.
Thank God.
Man, I hate that time of the year.
I despise it.
Yesterday was so boring and just terminal, just unbelievable.
Although at least New Year's Day isn't as bad as Christmas Day.
If anybody out there doubts that the Glam rule the world, Christmas Day, just about everything is closed.
New Year's Day, at least a lot of places stay open.
Am I right?
Yeah.
So.
Thank God you're safe.
I wouldn't know.
24 hour market close to where I live.
That's open.
Just like the shoppers drug markets, also always open holidays.
24 a 7.
Forever.
If the world's coming to an end, they're still selling crap.
And that good, that was open on Christmas Day.
Thank God for that.
And they have the Hakanaz Rocky Road.
A point.
That was Christmas Day.
I'm still alive.
Good.
Our survey, and it's not full of this survey.
Six eighty five.
Well, no, we should be able to do a thousand on that.
It's just a survey.
It's not even a poll doesn't require an opinion.
We're just asking you about your personal sexual, the hanky panties, your dalliances.
Not sure.
Oh, yeah, I'm not sure.
I'm still thinking about it.
Like you said, it's gay.
A wheelie hand.
Not there.
Not sure.
Not there.
Not sure.
QAM, hello.
One down.
One, two, to go.
Each of you make and you bigger, little girl.
QAM, hello.
How good are you, man?
I'm just a human again.
You're stuck.
Over it.
Over it.
Over it.
Over it.
Over it.
Just intact for the new year.
Robus and more Coke, okay?
Go, go, uh, solve your Craig problem.
QAM, not lying.
I don't know how to do that.
Okay.
One more.
QAM, hello.
Hey, no, I can do your hair.
We're still waiting for our first real call of the new year.
Yes, sir.
You got it right here.
It's the first call of the way right here.
Okay.
I got real bad news for you though.
Right here.
I'm listening.
That course, that guy's back in town.
Yeah, and two.
You're an idiot.
You're still more.
Uh-huh.
Or as a boyfriend, one of them.
It doesn't matter.
Now.
If it's him or his boyfriend.
No, that's right.
Same, the same aroma, same smell.
Might as well be the same aroma.
What?
They might as well be the same person with the same material for lack of a better quality.
So did you find my shnappers or not?
I keep asking that question.
Sorry, uh, it looks like you can, you can't buy online.
I'm sorry.
Why not?
Because nobody's selling online.
What do you mean by that?
Well, I'm searching the internet.
I found your website for you.
So you find shnappers, uh, yes, meats.
Yeah.
Shniders.ca.
Yeah, okay.
It's a big crap here.
Yeah.
But, um, it says like, you know, in your community and some of that, you know, maybe, but no,
it doesn't tell you anything.
So you're S.O.L. brother.
Well, thanks for trying.
I did try.
I'm sorry.
We would order to do a case of it, but, you know, and that means I'm stuck with it.
You wouldn't order me nothing, okay?
Yeah, we would order to and then, uh, on my credit card.
No, it's meant to.
Ah.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
no comment.
So I guess Don Shula is more important than I am, okay?
Hey, guess what?
I'm still working, Shula.
Maybe not that much longer, but I'm still working.
How about you?
You old cout.
You see now, old fart.
See, there's nothing worse than sour grapes.
Ah, the bakery is cheap.
Yeah.
You know, you know, you have a childish that sound.
I'm sure for an adult, for somebody who's supposed to be an adult, childish.
Give credit where credit is due, okay?
Bill Bollochek is 400 times the coach that you ever wore ever would be, okay?
And he didn't get canned either.
Yeah, he did.
Not in New England.
Oh, New England though.
And Robert Kraft, well, I don't want to go into that.
We don't want to talk about baldy.
And that ridiculous celebration in the press box after they finally won a game after 14
straight losses and they finally won a game.
Wasn't it after 14 or was it after 13?
Um, let's see, it was after 13.
I like how I say it.
I think.
See, Robert Kraft is like a real, you know, like he really gives a crap.
Even if he doesn't, he puts on an act.
He doesn't come out and public and say, oh, I'm not in it for the fans.
I'm in it for the money.
I mean, what kind of a statement is that, baldy?
Huh?
I'm not in it for the fans.
I'm in it for the money.
Sounds like, it sounds like an honest statement.
Grotesque.
Yeah, that's true.
Seven out one on our survey.
Now we're going there.
Exclusively a homo only 45.
Five points, seven percent.
Where have all the homos gone?
That's a good song.
Peter Paul Mary or the Kingston trio, which one you like better?
Oh, Kingston.
Let's play, um, MTA.
Last week.
Huh?
You got it.
A lot.
I think you have it in your...
thing there.
I think you had it.
You had it.
You had it for one day.
You do?
The MTA by the Kingston trio.
On Capitol Records, no less.
Those are the days, babies.
Early 60s folk music.
That's F-O-L-K, by the way.
Mm-hmm.
Hello.
These are the times that try men's souls.
In the course of our nation's history, the people of Boston
are rally bravely whenever they're right,
some men are in the reprimand.
Today, in New Zealand, the Metropolitan Council
is making better honesty and give you a time to look at
burdensome attacks on the population in the form of a subway fair in a priest.
Citizens hear me out.
This could happen to you.
Just don't let me know what you're telling me.
Yeah, I'll say.
Man, the man named Charlie O'Neal and tragic and faithful,
named.
He would tend to this in his pocket.
This is why I've been found only when you ride on the MTA.
Well, they'd never return, no, they'd never return.
Land is dead, it's dead, love is a bird.
He may rise forever, meet the speedy, sub-boss, meet the man.
Man, every turn, okay, that's enough.
That's more than enough.
MTA, the key to the trio, huh?
I said I'll say.
It's good crap.
The biggest name.
The best town in New Car than El Rajek.

Give a patriotic nod of approval
to Mr. Iowa Caucus Goer,
A Real American Hero.
Iowa Caucus Goer.
Why can't you guys just not vote
like the rest of us?
Yeah, there you go.
1048 at 560 WQM.
We got Jason Jerk's coming up at 2.
That should really be something.
You know what I mean?
Kant!
Speaking of Iowa Democratic president
who'll candidate Barack Obama has widened his lead
and Iowa over swillery and jointed
were sitting in the tomorrow's nominating caucuses according to the Des Moines Register's
final Iowa poll.
Obama's rise is the result in part of a dramatic influx of first-time caucus doors, including
a sizable block of political independence.
Both groups prefer Obama, what's been a very competitive campaign, says the Des Moines
Register.com.
Obama was the choice of 32 percent up from 28 percent of the last poll in late November,
while Sworey has got 25, he's got 32, she's got 25, and in words 24.
Did you follow those numbers?
No.
The poll reflux continuing fluidity in the race, even as the end of the year-long campaign
years.
I mean, a whole idea.
And New Hampshire's a primary in Iowa's caucus, it's a crap.
What word did you say?
You heard what I said.
There should be a national primary day period, get it over with, and stop all this fall
to fall.
Okay?
National primary one day.
Do it.
Stupid.
Iowa, New Hampshire.
Who gives a crap about either one of those states?
Anybody out there care about Iowa?
No.
Do Hampshire?
No.
And Mike Hockabee, oh brother, he just, you talk about some of you, you look at him and
you see evil.
I'm not sure who looks more evil than me, him or Romney.
They both look evil.
Romney looks like a TV newscaster.
He looks like gumboo.
Mike Hockabee, a former Baptist minister writing away the support from Fundamentalist
Goyam, talks Mitt Romney for first place in a new Des Moines Register poll of Iowa, is
planning to attend tomorrow's Republican caucuses in a battle of former governors, Hockabee
leads Romney 32 to 26.
32 to 26.
Let's see who else has got numbers on here.
McCain's got 13.
Fred Thompson, 9.
Julianne only 5% and Ron Paul, 9.
Got it?
Got those numbers?
Got it.
Good.
Get it.
So that's the latest, you know, from Iowa and I understand a lot of people are saying,
well, who cares about Iowa?
Nobody cares about Iowa.
Even a lot of people who live there, they're probably stuck there like a lot of you in Florida,
they're stuck.
They can't get out.
WQAM, hello.
You know, we're a lot alike.
Yeah.
WQAM, hello.
Hello.
Yes, he must be gay too.
Hello.
Yes.
Yes, is there any way that we can just keep here in the 8th second delay loop over and
over and over and over?
They can't get out.
WQAM, hello.
They know we're a lot alike.
Yeah.
WQAM, hello.
Yeah, keep it all gated.
Hello.
Yes.
Now what happened to him?
I don't know.
We were going to hear the 8th and we got all over it.
We were going to hear it all over it.
All of a sudden something happened.
Probably an active Joe Bell QAM, hello.
Hey, what's up, you know, yes, sir?
Hey, I hear you talk a lot about the machines.
I just wondered if in Canada, when you hit like a jackpot or you know, something for two
three, four thousand is the taxation of the famous here?
There is no tax.
Sir, wow.
Are you kidding me?
Let me say it again.
Let me say it again.
There are no tax on.
Oh, I'm so glad you mentioned that because I got to buy my lotto tickets for tonight.
It's 36 million.
Okay.
So in other words, if you hit the lotto, you can just grab all of it and a lot of it.
They give you a check.
They give you a check for the full amount.
There's no tax on gambling winnings.
None.
Have a great year, and you have a thing.
You too.
Yes, sir, that's a ripoff.
And of course the people, you know, oh, we don't want them.
We don't want those machines here.
Those evil ones are bad.
Yeah, that's a ripoff, all right.
But let me tell you, the Florida Lottery is the biggest ripoff of all.
Well, we'll give you an annuity.
And like if you're 85 years old, we're going to give you a 20-year annuity.
You should lose so long you're going to collect the money.
Just give me the money now.
And if you decide to just take the money now, they can like lap off about 90%.
Oh, we're going to give you 50 bucks.
How's that?
Big ripoff.
And you know, the public, what are they going to do about it?
They're going to like revolt?
Somebody's call us are.
People aren't they be voting?
WQA and hello.
And you weigh my line one, yes.
Hey, Neil, happy New Year to you and the crew and George.
Thanks, you, sir.
A quick thing I went to the dolphin game the other day.
And besides the performance that was I've seen little league football better than that.
The ambiance in the stadium.
There was no personal.
There was nobody there.
There was enough people there.
And the biggest thing was I'm looking around and we've got ripped off 25 bucks a part.
We've got a couple of beers.
There was $17.
You know, we're spending a lot of the tickets for $80 for the fourth level.
And my new year's resolution is I'm giving them at least two years that there's no chance I'm going to go pay that much cash and see.
That's total abomination.
And I mean, the clear lemon couldn't throw a path.
Okay, we'll talk all the sports shows and talk about clear is the lemon.
Okay, I'm not interested.
I don't care.
Okay, they suck.
That's the bottom line.
They stink.
They suck.
They were one in 15.
They were disgrace to the elite.
Okay, they were disgrace to the human race is what they are.
But we got billed par cells.
We got the big tour.
We got the big tour.
And yesterday came and went.
I didn't see nothing about what's in them getting fired.
Scan Cameron, did you Chris?
That was a fire yet.
Well, why not?
Now the thing they're going to wait for the new GM to come in.
Get out of here.
Wait for the new GM and he's going to say, oh, yeah, I want that with silly old man.
It went one in 15 and every decision he made was always wrong and blew up in his face.
Yeah, I want to keep him around.
What a joke there is.
I thought the big tour was going to be decisive, man.
I thought he was going to come and kick ass the big tuna.
WQA and hello.
Hello, Neil.
How are you?
Okay, sir.
All right.
That's good.
I just wanted to let you know that I'm sitting in the parking lot waiting for my friend.
Yeah, we're my fish.
They're your rectum.
I know.
WQA and hello.
Smiling soul.
Let's get...
WQA and hello.
Hello.
No.
Yes.
I just want to let you know.
You know, it's hard for me to spew on this crap that I got a spew.
I'm waiting on the phone this long.
It's completely...
You've got to tighten up.
You've got to tighten up.
Well, I'm pretty...
Yeah, go to Tom off RT building the drills.
Okay, go do the tighten up.
Smuck.
Tighten up your ass.
731 on our survey.
Anybody care?
No.
Well, Chris does.
He wants to get to that thousand of the day.
I think he'll do it.
It's a survey.
It's not a poll.
You can see the self-exclusively hit aosexual 557.
76.1%.
First time we did this.
It was 81.4%.
Bisexual 65.
8.8%.
First time we did...
Well, I'm not going to say first time.
Last time we do it.
So that's doubled.
Now, how do you...
Does that mean there are more people in the closet now?
I think that's what that means.
Not sure 42 exclusively homosexual.
45.4% down from...
We lost 2% of our homos, man.
And a sexual 27.
How about doing it, A?
Not.
Now, that's a Canadian way.
Let's do it, A.
WDQA and Hello.
Sounds like I'm listening, doesn't it?
WDQA and Hello.
Yeah, I kneel.
Yes, sir.
You got to put on your poll only bang a horse.
That's the next choice.
Nah, ah!
Q.A. and Hello.
Q.A. and you can do it.
Hello.
Yes?
Happy New Year, Neil.
Yes, happy New Year to you, sir, with a phony voice.
How do you do it?
Okay, how are you doing?
I'm okay.
What do you got, sir?
What do you got? Say something.
I ain't getting up to you.
Yeah, that's obvious.
Q.A. and Hello.
Let me tell you something.
The epitomeo...
I have no luck.
The epitomeo of that is the call or radio talk show
and when you have nothing to say.
Yeah.
Not even a crank.
I mean, just have nothing.
That's the stout.
Oh my God.
What do you got?
Oh, I have nothing.
I have no luck.
This is a vacuum.
They don't even have anything bad.
They just have nothing.
I just got plenty of nothing.
I have nothing.
So anyway, we got Jason Jackson or two.
Jason Jerks.
I can't, I don't know.
I feel uncomfortable about call and conversation.
Jerks every year when I promoted sure every day.
But I will promote it two to four.
That's our new lineup today.
And then Mad Dog moves back to four to seven.
And then we invite everybody to tune it out at seven
with that dolphins crap.
Dolphins all asses.
That's part of the price we pay to get the dolphins back on the station
before they went one in fifteen.
Nice going, Johnny Jones.
The best talent.
You know his new project.
And the wife's going on a mic on my foot.

Curry for like a week. Yeah, you see some of them and you're like,
am and then we get close like these. No. All right. Well,
how to go to it. Okay, see yeah. Yeah, it's a pretty heavy duty, man.
That's curious though. That's what I wish on Johnny Jovel. I
wish that he has wild, festering, bloody,
uncontrollable diarrhea that smells like curry the rest of his life. See, I
added that other part part. I got it. So when I finished off my
voodoo curse this afternoon, I'm going to I'm going to inject the

Emerald a gassy. I don't watch the food channel that might be the only place
he's on. Oh, I guess what's coming today, allegedly, is my
greenfields pasta and that low-carb sauce. I just let you a
fact. I know what you're saying. That's okay. That's what reminded me.
All right. The fact is I'm fat like you doing outkins again,
this possible tried greenfields. How much do you use for a serving to satisfy?
Well, the president, how much of a pig do you use exactly?
Geez. And how much carbs do we need to lose weight?
20 is too low. 60 okay? 60, yeah, yeah.
Well, yeah, I don't know. Okay. Need your experienced
dieters advice. I don't know. I would I would like maybe 40.
If you really want to lose some serious weight on the video on the maintenance
isn't 60 okay, but certainly the end of it. I want you to lose however much
one. All right. One good luck to you.
Whoever this is, it works hard to do. It's hard to give up those carbs
because that's what you're addicted to. That's what made most of us fat in the first
place. Those refined killer carbs, baby. They're going to kill you. You're
going to die. 801 on your survey. Aren't you excited, Chris?
No, very excited. Fat and lazy man. That's no way to go through life.
Fat and lazy. I should know. See if I was if I was slim and like
energetic and worked out in a good shape, then it would be like who now would
I be to talk right? Right. I know fat and lazy.

Here you go, doll. There's something in my beard.
That's a cigarette-ass. It won't burn you.

Maury Doz column, Dan or Rain.
How many of Hotsika, how many Talies on our survey?
813.
813, like I said, wow, you're gonna make 1,000 today,
and then that'll make us all proud.
What a good way to start the new year, right?
Uh-huh.
Maury Doz says, Edith Wessel, Edith, excuse me, Edith.
Edith Wessel, the 80-year-old white-haired retired nurse,
moved slowly up the aisle with her walker actor,
listening to me, who'll remain her pitch.
She told one of the Hillary volunteers
she had great admiration for the senator,
but also great doubts about whether her strong negatives
would sink her in the general election.
I can't understand why people dislike her so much,
Mrs. Wessel said.
The volunteer assured the waiver in Cockerscore
that the Republicans will slime anyone who gets the nomination,
and that Hillary has more experience wrestling than her rivals.
Mrs. Wessel is torn.
She likes Obama, but worries about his experience.
She likes Hillary, but worries about her baggage.
The presidential anguers here are dancing on the head of a pin.
The Democratic race, three lawyers, married to lawyers who talk too much,
is very tight and very volatile.
Even the jittery pack of seasoned political operatives
gazing into their blackberries,
doesn't seem to have a clue which way the Iowa snow grips are blowing.
A cross-town Nancy Hibbs, a 50-70-year-old nurse,
came to listen to John Edwards give his son of a mill worker
ran against corporate greed,
complete with a sneer-ended Obama,
that anyone who thinks you can be just nice.
You can just nicely carnivorous Republican fat cats
into submission is in never-neverland.
Mrs. Hibbs has decided after seeing Barack Obama
your door had decided that she would vote for him.
She saw him again Monday night in Ames,
and fell even more certain than he was the one.
After listening to Edwards for 40 minutes on Tuesday,
she often changed her mind, deciding to vote for him.
Bitch, you can tell in his voice he's not playing the game
he can hear his moral commitments, you said,
we need a big turnaround.
And what about Hillary? I don't want the same old and French politics
she replied adding emphatically,
and I don't want Bill in the White House again.
But Bill very much wants to be in the White House again.
He's going around the state relentless
of giving a speech as tightly choreographed with Hillary's
as the dancing with the stars' routines.
Miss Bill, Vogue Hill reads one button being sold outside the events.
By the time Bill and Hillary are finished with it,
you could be forgiven for thinking that
she had personally forged the peace accord in Northern Ireland
while sucking away the $127 billion Clinton budget surplus
and dodging bullets on route 2, ending at the cleansing in Bosnia.
The big dog pushed the experience card hard.
Whatever is fiction to happen, whether it's something like 9-11,
Katrina or Pakistan, he said, Hillary is better equipped to face it.
The big dog.
As to the healthcare debacle, he said every president will fail
at something or another, it's how they dust themselves off the counts.
And whether she's learned from her mistakes, the courses at the heart of the matter,
and something that voters can never really know,
or even if they study up as much as iron ones.
As Hillary truly changed and grown from her mistakes,
as she learned to be less stubborn and impervious and secretive and vindictive and entitled,
or she merely learned to master off-putting and self-sabotaging qualities better.
If elected with the old Hillary pop-up, dragging as factored as dysfunctional Clinton Kingdom,
she is speaking in a soft, measured voice in these final days,
so that with as with Daisy Buchanan, you would have to lean into listen.
But she's really different than she was in the years when she was so careless
about the people around her getting hurt by Clinton legal whirlwind that she was dubbed the Daisy Buchanan of a boomer set.
The underlying rationale for her campaign is that she is old.
Old from moving to Arkansas, giving up the name Rotem,
old from pretending to care about place settings and menus,
when she held the unappetizing title of First Lady,
old for enduring one humiliation after another at the hands of her husband.
Oddly, Barack and Michelle Obama also radiated a sense that they are old,
not for a lifetime of sublimation and humiliation,
but for this unresc campaign, for offering themselves up to save an uplift the nation,
even though it disrupted their comfortable lives.
Michelle told Vanity Fair that Americans would have only one chance to annoy her husband,
allowing it is now or never, and explain there's an inconvenience factor there,
and a really, really hard pressure and stress on the family that can only be justified
if her husband can win the presidency and change the world.
She told a group gathered at nursing home in Grinnell on Monday that Barack is one of the smartest people
you'll ever encounter who will dain't wonder this messy thing called politics.
So what comes down to this, will Queen Hillary reign, will Prince Barack dain, and who is old more?
Who did Mo, that's the question I wonder if Mo would say that, who did Mo?
He might.
He probably would, but he's not around anymore.
No, he's not.
What?
She'll miss him.
Yeah, we do miss the moment.
We thought that those days were bad and evil and hateful and stuff like that,
but you know what, there was a certain amount of, yeah,
a lot of six twisted fun involved, there was a cavity.
That's right.
As opposed to now, we're doing nothing funny going on in this joint.
Oh, no, no.
Sad.
Nothing funny.
Ragec.
Oh my God.
A15 on a survey, our sex survey.
Maybe there's some of the people out there busy trying to figure it out right now.
Speaking of that, a retired pastor from Canada was sentenced to three years in prison
last week after telling him, a Henry County judge who was sexually harassed by the four-year-old
by the four-year-old Lacon Hill's girl he pleaded guilty to molesting.
He was sexually harassed by a four-year-old girl.
Kenneth Cook, 73, appeared to have reasonable chance at a probation sentence given his age health,
problems in electrocriminal history, heading into a sentencing hearing.
Well, somebody sent this into us, but the problem with that is that this is a story from last week.
Oh.
Because it says the sentencing hearing the Saturday noon.
There must be a follow-up to it somewhere, eh?
But the Calgary man who once headed his own ministry, likely blew his chance of avoiding prison when he took a witness stand
and painted his preschool age victim as a sexual aggressor.
On a couple of occasions I felt I was sexually harassed Cook said,
I think there is psychological evidence that children even in their younger years can become interested in sex.
He later said he did nothing inappropriate to the girl but pleaded guilty two months ago to avoid putting his family through a trial.
Right.
Judge Joseph Condon responded harshly telling Cook and Stamen show he has no remorse and he's a threat to young children.
It just boggles my mind, Condon said, it's my opinion you have a significant problem and the other four-year-olds have a significant problem around you.
What I'm about to do is necessary for the protection of the public.
And of course what he was about to do, we don't know yet because they haven't.
I'm sure somebody will Google it and find the rest of the story.
Right. The person who sent that is, what?
Right.
QAM, hello.
I'm Neil Ted.
Ted, stay calm. How you doing?
OK, Ted.
You know, you had an invention show on last week.
Talking about invention?
I beg your pardon?
You were talking about invention flash.
Sounds like Reverend Jones to me.
You know, I invented the fake potato of the phone.
Yeah.
I think that was a brand new crazy.
Yeah, no, it was not. That was Reverend Jones.
Right.
Doing a voice. He's doing it for the new year.
He's starting out on New Leaf.
You know, New Leaf Goat.
That Chris was that him or not.
I'm not sure.
We're not sure.
Well, compare it.
Maybe because you'll call back with some other new invention.
You know, like the phone up is asked.
That would be good.
818 on our survey.
You can see to yourself blank exclusively.
Hitler was sexual 629, 76.8%.
So let me compare these percentages now with when we did this the last time.
The last time was 81 and a half.
Bisexual 71, 8.6%, that's almost double what we had before.
Not sure 47.
And we had, what is that?
5.7% was 6.7% last time.
Well, that means 1% have finally figured it out.
Exclusively, homosexual 44 only 5.3%.
That's down 2%.
Where have all the fairies gone?
Come on now.
And a sexual 28, which we didn't put on in the first time.
I had to bet on.
As in no sex, a...
But, as you work the biggest name to the best talent.
You're losing a budget.

Very good place to transform into nations that hadn't been completed yet.
This now has been done by only lives and המing.
Chances for this fact are that on course New Year'sз always means one thing regarding
the landings we have in all voices like Loyal clutch.
Get back to God for this idea of bringing hope to all of these places like that and down
Yeah, apparently that's the thing that they do.
They do that.
That's why to celebrate, baby, alright.
And 11-year-old boy playing hide and seek was killed minutes before the new year began,
when the neighbor fired a semi-automatic weapon into an abandoned couch the boy was hiding behind,
outside an Opalach apartment complex they had police said yesterday.
The boy Joshua Aerolego was shot several times, including once in the head and was pronounced dead at the scene.
The suspect, Zian Fernandez 49, fled from the apartment complex parking lot,
but later turned himself in to North Miami police and was charged with a kind of manslaughter.
Neighbors said they knew Fernandez had a gun, but it's not clear why he started shooting after sofa.
They knew it's awful, they're dangerous.
Joshua's neighbors and family did say Tuesday night, they didn't think Fernandez knew the boy was hiding behind the couch.
It's an accident I think said, at Wardo, you mama, Joshua's uncle.
You mama?
Yeah.
He never meant for the staff and maybe he was drinking said, you mama.
Neighbors said gunfire was common in the area of the apartment complex at 132.40,
Port Said Road, Port Said.
How do you say that?
Say CID, Port Said?
Sure, why not?
But at first no one paid any attention to mine, especially on New Year's Eve.
Gunfire is common.
Everybody does it, says 17-year-old Alexander Kamacho.
We always hear it around here.
Oh yeah.
Around 11-15 PM Monday, Joshua's 15-year-old brother Marvin took a break from a game the boy's called Man Hunt to get a drink of water.
When he came back outside, he saw Fernandez standing near his Ford pickup, shooting what looked like a 9-millimeter pistol into a couch,
somebody had thrown out here the trash receptacle about 20 feet away.
I didn't do not and he's an interview Tuesday night, but my mom came running out to see what he was saying, where is Joshua?
Family members searched the back of the complex, guess what? Joshua wasn't there, then Marvin and a stepfather searched the front.
I saw my brother, Marvin, say he was lying face down in the parking lot behind the discarded sofa.
When Marvin picked him up, he saw wound in his head, then the bullet fell out of his mouth.
He wished he hadn't seen that, he said, I don't wish that on anybody.
Tuesday afternoon there was a light on at the Fernandez apartment, but nobody answered the door, says the hero.
Downstairs, Joshua's extended family was gathering outside his apartment.
His mother was inside to distract us see anyone.
U-Mama, his uncle worried there wouldn't be money to bury the boy.
He'd found a place for the funeral home in Crematory, but cost more than five grand for the funeral viewing and everything.
He worried that Joshua's mother, a hotel housekeeper and father of mechanic couldn't afford to pay that.
U-Mama was trying to start a collection, but it wasn't going well.
Here, let's go out on New Year's Eve and shoot out a few lines there, maybe a year, and a show please.
You know, it's dumb trees, stuff like that.
Anything it's like here, you know.
I got a better idea.
What's that?
Stay inside.
Stay inside.
That's what I do.
Or if a helmet on your head.
That's what I did.
I stayed inside with a helmet saccharisal, an old one.
Eight, eighty one on a survey.
It's not, I don't know.
You think I was the first day of the New Year.
You know, now the holidays are over, people are trying to get back to like normal.
Like this one here, QIM.
Um, what house are you?
Rack room.
The crack problem.
He's just out of control today, man.
What do you think it is?
You think it's the holidays or something?
Maybe the resolution that he made was to have less of a life this year.
Oh, or maybe a lot more drugs.
If that's possible, but I doubt it.
Let's see, people who can afford drugs are too busy doing that, you see.
Oh.
Somebody QA in, hello.
I'll come in over.
Like I said, soft Florida, man.
First show of the New Year.
You think we'd be inundated.
Happy New Year, guys.
I hope it's going to be a great year.
Best of luck in the out of that place.
And thanks for the memories and up your, you know, up your nose with a piece of hose.
Like that.
Then we have one lady called today to say anything.
Now, very, very hostile place, very unacceptable.
So even though it's eighty five million degrees below zero here today, the sun is shining.
At least it looks really nice sitting inside, looking out.
And if people are polite and friendly, a little bit too polite and friendly driving a little too slow, a speed it up a little, put a little, uh, something on the pedal.
Like your ass, something kind of they drive slow here.
I've never seen anything like it in my life.
There are three speeds, slow, slower and reverse.
Which proves, like I've always said, nothing is perfect, man.
If you're looking for paradise, I don't care what certain philosophers have said.
Even that one, there ain't no paradise.
WDQIM, hello.
Well, the weather outside is QAM, hello.
Fucker!
QAM, hello.
It puts the Iowa caucus.
WDQIM, hello.
Happy New Year, guys.
Best of luck getting the hell out of that place.
Bye.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
You got to feed in the lines, man.
Like Jay Leno and Letterman, you got to feed them the lines, you got no material.
Just like, uh, you got to feed him a few lines too.
And I'm sure he's taking full advantage right now.
Maybe somebody's supporting his hand.
I got it.
WDQIM, hello.
Hey, how you doing, happy New Year.
Okay, sir.
Back to you.
Yeah, I was reading investor Daley and they had an article when they were saying,
one out of four cars, they, uh, could be repossessed, which could even be a bigger problem
than the housing problem right now.
And also this freeze tonight is going to kill all the Florida produce.
I'm out.
Okay, thanks for your uplifting call, sir.
WDQIM, hello.
I'm looking for a fool.
So prick.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
See, like I said before, I enjoy it.
I've reached that point now.
I'm an over-emasicist.
I'm absolutely enjoying it.
Yeah.
And you, you're just, you're so, you're so, I don't know, jaded at this point anyway,
then it doesn't make any difference to you.
No, it doesn't.
George don't care, okay?
That's right.
You probably call them like, uh, very, uh, say anything you want.
What difference does it make?
Right.
Like that blogger.
It's some fat blogger's writing stuff about us.
What bloggers, eh?
Remember that?
You read that thing and you had the, the only person that he liked on the station was the big O.
And you ripped you and you ripped me and you ripped a hank.
You ripped everybody else.
Yeah.
Remember that?
It's like that.
It's like, I need a college blogger.
Why do you remember that crap though?
That, that's what you're doing.
I'll just bring it up as an example.
I mean, just barely, vaguely remember fat lifeless holes.
One thing I've learned to do, man, when it comes to a clock, this is all like, I don't need it.
Oh yeah.
It's like you turn a key in the lock.
Exactly.
And you walk out and you just, it's just there.
John, that's what I should do to the studio.
Although I don't let the maid, I let the maid vacuum in here, but I don't let her touch not.
Let her dust with a feather duster.
No, in fact, you know something, maybe that's what I'll do in my spare time since I have so much of it.
And you get a feather duster.
Oh, you know what else I need to get?
And we haven't done that pull in a long time.
It's almost as good as paper or plastic.
The body washers soap.
Mm-hmm.
The fact that there are still people out there using soap.
There's something really wrong about that.
If you're using soap, that means you want to drop it.
You're rich and have the things squawed right out of your hand and oops, drop the soap again.
Squawes.
Squawes right out of your hand.
That's right.
There it goes.
That wasn't sound.
That was good.
There it goes.
I squawed too hard.
It was during the last break by the way.
I did go in and squawes pretty hard.
Did you?
Didn't have to squawes too hard.
I don't like you today.
I don't know what it is.
Maybe we're getting the last year out of our system.
That must be it.
Huh?
Yeah, I'm not done.
You're not done?
I might have to go back.
Not another lengthy session.
I just don't have no idea.
Everybody clear out of the tea room.
George is going to have a gigantic meal.
See, I never know how long it's going to take, unlike some people.
They'd have it down to an art.
Oh, I've got it down to a science maker.
Sure.
I envy you.
I'm already wiping before I sit down.
I know how long it takes me to do it.
Everything else.
Except that.
I'll be damned.
Let's get the stopwatch for George's next trip.
I can't, baby.
Oil passes $100 a barrel.
I'll ride.
Bill's the cause and Monica's the China.
She lets out a giggle.
When he makes it a way to go.
Monica is not the kind you can do in the behind.
But a sick car and her vagina she don't mind.
Well, he don't know where a stoke goes.
I can see how there was some confusion between humor and joy.
And you made horror.
Absolutely.
And then I can saw the term Cedar Box means saw her naked.
Stars reportedly to go in line.
Now, Clinton, he was working hard.
Late nights in the overrear office.
Working on a practical joke.
He took him back a new door, put an explode in.
Loading for Monica was glowing, rings a smoke.
Bill's the cause and Monica's the China.
All right.
She lets out a giggle.
Every time he makes it a way to go.
Monica is not the kind you can do in the behind.
But a sick car and her vagina she don't mind.
Well, people feel that Hillary's been made a fool of by her husband.
Feel that Hillary was wrong.
Up in the Lincoln bedroom she was morning.
Morning, our door was doing her with Bill's old bomb.
Bill's the cause and Monica's the China.
She lets out a giggle.
Every friggin' time he makes it a way to go.
Monica is not the kind you can do in the behind.
But a sick car and her vagina she don't mind.
You're wrong.
You can't do your safe and clean.
Yeah, that's master.
It's master.
Oh, yeah.
What you gotta do is take a tip of real love.
A sick car and her vagina.
You're gonna say one thing.
The day the James Taylor dies I'm gonna have a big party if I'm still alive.
You know, even if I'm just barely hanging on.
I'm gonna have a big party I can't stand James Taylor.
Can you?
I like him fine.
No, you don't.
Okay.
You do?
I don't, neither fish nor foul.
I mean, I don't have any of his records.
Well, why not?
I feel like I'm just fine.
I don't dislike him.
It's just that.
I've seen fire and I've seen water.
And I'm saying it's not for me, but he ain't good.
You know, before your brains out, Bob.
You know, it's not for me, but whatever.
Oh, I told Bob.
Oil passes $100 a barrel for the first time ever to the concerns about inventories and Nigerian supplies.
And we would be remiss and not saying on this first day of the new year, 2008.
Thank you, Mr. President, for those low gas prices.
You butcher, you bastard, you lunatic, you liar, you murdering knucklehead.
All of these things.
And I just said it.
Thank you so much.
So $100 a barrel, so what does that mean?
Because you're like about $200 to fill up your gas tank?
Sure.
I see some bad, bad things coming in the new year.
Like $4 a gallon of gas.
Or pretty close to it.
I know too on your survey, by the way, Mr. Havchot, Fant and Leazy.
Uh-huh.
So now, what were you saying that Shula mentioned my name several times during that conversation?
No, I didn't mention him many others.
When you look, when you're that fried as he is, when you're in the brainstem,
you think you remember who the hell I am?
George has a sound if you want it.
The sound of what?
What the hell was that?
The sound of silence.
Now, what was that?
That was a raspberry.
Do you want to hear the...
George has the sound of what?
When you hung up and Shula came on.
Yeah, okay, let's hear it.
Me and their waving me off on you.
Apparently, there's somebody else wants to get on the air.
You're going to blow me off already?
I can't do that.
Oh my God.
I want to know who it is before I think about it.
I don't know.
Oh, it's not Shula.
Oh, see that in the way, man.
Put it out.
Stop that right there, okay?
I'm going to quit ripping the Patriots.
It sounds like I'm raped.
Got all of my money.
Okay, we're listening.
Yeah.
You see, you're telling me that it was Hank's decision?
They're waving me off already because they got somebody much more important on the phone,
meaning the brainstem, Shula.
They, as in your close personal friend, Allison, who prodded and pleaded...
Don Shula, I have a call.
...for me to call it and hop around the show.
You know, he and I, you know, it's said goodbye to my show Monday morning.
That wasn't good enough.
No call in the hump or okay, which I was more than my pleasure to do it.
And she waved me off.
Okay, well guess what, Allison.
It was her.
But yeah, it probably was.
Of course it was.
She produces his show or did.
Now, who's here to see producer now?
Mad Dogs, I think.
Well, who is this producer before?
Well, Curtis is his board-opened producer.
Yeah.
And Allison was working with Curtis on...
I think she was working on Curtis.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
Yeah.
So I think Shula's now moving with her.
I think she's now moving to a magazine.
Working guests.
I thought that Sister Mary Mandish is the one guy that had the balls to say the call.
I don't do guests.
That I believe in guests.
And you always say that?
I don't know what he said.
And are they inundating him now with stupid ass guests with more of these dumb jocks?
Well, where is her name on the schedule?
It's on the Jack Show.
Okay, then the good word.
Allison and Sumit.
Who the hell is Sumit?
That's a new board-op that Jason is.
A new board-op that Jason knows?
Yes, he's a friend of Jason's.
What is that?
It's like when Mulbrough and that Israeli kid from New York, remember that?
Shy.
Shy?
What the hell happened to him?
Did he shy away?
Or fly away?
I think he was fired.
That's right.
He was fired for what?
He was being judged.
No, for good.
No problem with the Marlins or something.
Uh-oh, you know what?
Something came up with the Marlins that the Marlins complained about himself.
Yeah, that was a good guy.
He was worth.
He was in his really good right.
But he was a really good guy.
He was a really good guy.
I was probably some good as really.
I have a man named him.
I met that one.
How do you like that?
He was Jewish and he got candy, QA and motor coincident.
Oh my God.
Because the Marlins got been under shape.
When you know the way it goes, we made all that money on the Marlins.
Not lost our ass on the Marlins did.
With six days to go until the New Hampshire primary, there are ties and pull results for the top candidates in both parties.
You know, I'm thinking to myself during this last Bill Cigar thing I'm playing.
This is the best we can do.
Every four years, I think that to myself.
Three hundred million people.
These are the best and the brightest.
This is the best we can.
I mean, I like Barack Obama, but you're right about that.
He's got about as much chance of getting elected as great as Pymard.
He's articulate. He's got charisma.
He's got a good idea.
Yeah, he's the wrong color ain't nobody can shave for him.
He's the bottom man.
And you know, you hear the scuttle, but even the black people don't consider him black enough.
So he's not even going to get their vote.
He's too black.
He's not African American.
He's only half this and the black is the wrong kind of black from the wrong place.
If he could be more like a shade like Lester Hoek.
Right, because he's an African.
His parents were never, you know, his ancestors were never slaves.
Can I continue with this poor?
Yeah, I want to.
You know, in fact, I'd like you to finish the show.
No.
With roughly a quarter of those...
I mean, no, thank you.
Oh, you're welcome.
With roughly a quarter of those pulled in both parties saying they won't make up their mind till the election,
both the Democratic and Republican presidential nomination raises the rougher grabs into a Hampshire.
Oh, let's go to New Hampshire, man, where they're real craggie.
Senator John McKaynevere, a zone whose campaign was languishing six months ago,
and former Massachusetts government, Ron Nairn, not a tie for first,
with each grabbing 29% of likely Republican and the primary voters.
The CNNWMU are pulled connected by the University of New Hampshire found,
formerly, or Mayor Rudy Giuliani, is at only 12%.
And Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, 10% far-bison, Bible-thumping, bigoted lunatic, liar, phony.
Well, I got an attack, but I'm not going to run it.
I'll let you guys the media see it, but who the hell's he can?
It's McCain come back.
His new hand, you want to know why?
Because what I just got through saying, because the field is so lackluster,
that even a crazy man like McCain seems plausible at this point.
His New Hampshire support dropped abruptly over the summer when his campaign nearly ran out of money,
but he's made steady gains since then, senior analyst Bill Schneider was seen in and said,
a king was tied with Giuliani for leading New Hampshire in February and March.
By July, he dropped to fourth place with just 12%,
most of the political world left McCain for dead after cash problems forced him to cut his staff.
McCain shared the voters grow steadily through December, and the polls suggested it's come at the expense of Giuliani.
Like Joe Biden says, every speech by Giuliani, it's a noun of verb and 9-11.
For the first time, GOP primary voters see McCain and not Giuliani as best able to handle terrorism,
and a whopping 53% feel he could do the best job with the war in Iraq.
Romney has a major advantage on the economy and illegal immigration,
but it comes to the personal qualities of the two men, McCain's take it lead on experience and see this more honest.
On the Democratic side, Swellery's got a four-part leader, Borabama, 34% to 30%,
among likely voters, but if you take into account this survey sampling error,
it's a statistical dead heat.
John Edward's 17%.
There's only one thing about John Edward, he's got going for me, or what that is.
He's electable because he's a Jewelian Yehu.
There you go.
Here's the white color of the guy he's ever.
The white color of the Gittle Boy.
420-560 QAM.

I turn 13.
I'm a last birthday.
Daddy bought me a doll.
And he told me to play.
I wonder what daddy'd say.
If he knew I got 69 emails today.
But my name, my age, my face, is posted on my face.
I got out of prison.
Oh, in 1982.
I was called at the playground with a kid or two.
I used the internet.
I emailed him today.
And tomorrow I'm wet.
Because her name, her age, her face is posted on my face.
My face.
Hey, baby.
You know, you're really mature for your age.
How about we meet in person.
How about we meet in person.
And our figure doesn't watch.
I'm not standing and saying what this baby will will of every onion's health.
Yeah, I'm pretty smelly, you know that
I'm so, I'm gonna take what I'm doing
Let me have some more
Only of the video shop
But just don't tell your folks
And this bastard don't tell the cops
Whoa
He said I'm wanting a man
That's right
All ain't sex, it's a prank
And it ain't fair
Money, baby, my age, my age
Go stay gone, my age, my age
He goes to his county market and only one place
And he's headed now, he didn't know I wore a brazen
1247-13-1 at 560 W. Femitz, the debut of the Jason Jackson show
1247-2-4 on QAN
Oh my god
That's what a lot of people are saying
Are you gonna be tuned in today?
What are you talking to?
Oh, you, you of course
I wonder who this could be, WQAN
Hey, no, I'll be there
And back to you
Thank you, we are the rest of that collar one
The hair show is response
This is response to one
Oh yeah, that's right, I chopped your job
Okay, and don't let me forget to play a Robi Rance for Anthony the UPS driver Connecticut
This is birthday, oh and I should probably give him one of these too
No extra charge, Tony, here it is
What do you want to hear?
Why do you want to hear the rest of the show thing?
Can you do it?
I'm like Saurid rapes
Oh, I'm telling you
Got all of my money
Okay, we're listening to you
Hey, all of the best
Hey, thanks, Neil
Like we said this morning and keep in touch
Okay, I certainly will
Have a great year, Hank
A little best to you
Thanks
Neil Rogers
Coach
Hey, hey, how are you doing?
I had to drop Neil Rogers, he'll be ripping me tomorrow now
Hey, listen, the guy that was just not, thinks it's okay for New England to cheat, huh?
That was Neil Rogers done
That guy
Anyway, how you doing, coach?
You doing great, good, good
That guy is a silent, this guy
That was Neil Rogers, that guy
The response from the brainstem is silence
Silence
I don't know who that is, that hell you don't
You remember when we were at IOD and he got all bent out of shape?
Who was doing the coach's show after Hank would do it?
I don't know, is that he heard
Was it sunny?
No, it wasn't sunny, was somebody did the coach's show?
Back, was it Renery?
Oh, it was Renery
Okay
And he didn't like the fact that Renery hadn't seen the game or he didn't like the question he was asking
And he had a Yanke him off of that thing and put somebody else's son in remember that?
Right
You take yourself much too seriously brainstem, let me tell you that right now
Much too seriously, sour puss if you asked me
I just wasn't conscious
Done, Sula, I had him
Thanks honey, you're welcome
God, you don't want to think about him?
We need some help
Yeah
Anyway, let's just forget about the brainstem, okay?
About the shoes, myster?
Because it's all about Sula and Marino, it's all about living in the past
Because the organization, well we got the parcels that are coming up now
You know something, Chris?
What's that?
If the parcel, oh I guess who I saw several times over the holidays doing the live spot, I mean not a live spot
I got live spots on the brain, not on the show but on the brain
But I do want to spot for some energy bar, you probably see this spot
Really?
Really, no I haven't seen that
He looks pretty good to me and I don't spot Brady Quinn
I don't see John, what's the name, Beck doing any live spots?
Unless they're going to be doing live spots for dropping a football, maybe they'll have one for that
Maybe
Well what I started to ask you is if the parcels era turns out to be a big tuna
I turned out to be a dead rotten fish, what's going to happen then?
Then they start over again
I just know what they're doing now starting over again
That's why I said again
Come on, let's get rid of that Scam Scammering guy, okay?
As much as I love the Patriots and anything bad happens that often makes me happy
Nevertheless, I mean, come on man, what are you waiting on?
He's waiting for the new GM
You think anybody with a half of brain is going to keep Scam in the camera?
Scam camera is the football with Joe Bell is already losing written all over him
But he's on the phone again, he's talking upstairs, he's talking to the coaches upstairs on his phone
They're losing 87 to 3 but Scamster is on the phone
God, what are we going to do about these, but did you go in and ask parents about the engineer?
No, but I wrote it down, so what I see him
Yeah, tomorrow morning
I won't be in this...
I mean, I could try to find out
Tomorrow, I'll accomplish his outbreak because he need a certain tool as you know
To get these little buttons off here
Should always have the right tool
I ain't got the right tool
Oh, and look at that, the light just went on again
It keeps flickering, which means the bulb is going, you know?
I mean, once upon a time, a couple years ago, the engineer up here came in and he swapped out all the bulbs, maybe like three years ago
And I was fine, and lasted for a long time
But now they've got to be replaced again
I know, I paid expense
The delay pot, the bulbs, what else? I'm making a list
That's it, that's all we need right now, and then I can think of it, it's all broken so far
Intercom
And the innercom, that's right
Yeah, yeah
The innercom, that not only doesn't work, but it goes on the air
Let's try it
Okay, how does this sound? Is this on the air?
Yeah, that was on the air?
Yeah, I guess so
That was my mic close, that was the innercom
That's supposed to be for me to talk to Chris back and forth about the innercom
Oh, my God
See, this is Norma again, see?
Norma, who actually was in the Lake Belief Radio and played radio for a long time on the light bulb, who oughta know about these things
And oughta be holding their feet to the far at least on a minimum of things like this, if I'm going to be here another week, another month, another year, whatever it's going to be in Norma
Oh, it's New Year's Eve, it's Christmas Eve, it's a Tissue ball of it, yeah, right
Property taxes didn't drop like a rock during Governor Charlie Christ's get
First year in office, but neither is approval rating, how do you like that? They like them, of course they like this predecessor too
They loved this a fat ass jet bush
The Republican weather, the difficult year well, despite making only modest gains of two of the issues he championed most during his campaign
Lowering property taxes and property insurance rates
His approval rating did drop, it almost had to, having reached 73% in July, wow
73% but even with more than a billion dollars in budget cuts, property insurance rates they were made high and property tax cuts
It didn't return much to people's wallets, Christ was given a thumbs up
A thumbs up the rectum by 65% of respondents in October pulled by Quinnipiac University
People know their tough problems and don't let themselves to quick easy solutions
But he's getting good marks for the fact that he's trying for the fact that he's gay
And he's trying through bringing people together rather than my way the highway said, Bobby Graham
Who served as two-timbers governor before serving three-terms in the Senate
Go old Bobby Graham, at least he's still alive, you know
He changed the tone of Thalahasse Graham said, Christ is a very open person who normally listens to but solicits advice from a lot of different perspectives
He's an open person, I don't think he meant that
I wonder if he's got a very wide stance like Larry Craig
I don't know
That'd be a good poll question, who's got the wider stance in their pants?
Mark Foley, Charlie Christ, or Larry Craig
938 on the survey, by the way, you're going to make a thousand Mr. Hodgschot
Oh, we're out of town, we ought to have like 15 hundred on there easy
Back in the day, remember those days when we had an audience?
No, it's a long time, QAN, hello
Hello, Neil
Yes sir
I was just wondering if you had the opportunity to eat at a place called Happy Barbeque in Highly A
Never heard of it sir, and I eat with my teeth in, okay? I don't take my teeth out these
I see, wow, it's a very good dish and I'd like to recommend it to you and any of you
For happy birthday
Yeah, well let me make a suggestion to you, okay sir, don't steal the silverware
But silverware
Don't steal the silverware, the forks, the knives, the spoons, get out of here, you old fart
I'll see that, he's so mean to the collar, is that it?
Yeah, right, that's your idea of a talk show with some grizzled, 900-year-old fart that's giving me an awesome evidence
Probably I got some kid as a dishwasher there in a restaurant, some great, great, great grand kid
WDQA, and hello
MENCY-AM, MENCY-AM
QAN, hello
Or GENCY-GARS
QAN, hello
I'm a TOSTA-PATER
Yeah, you can say that again, that's for damn sure
942 on our sexual survey out there, and boy these people on the phone, you can be damn sure they're in the A-Sexual party
At least that's what they ought to be voting
Do you want me to say it?
A lot of
In fact, Sarah Loem, I don't think I'd like that thing about doing the board here, not the right
And they're the light one out again on a mic, now it's back on because I have to turn it off, put it back on again
Oh, why should I be the only one?
Yeah, that's right, why should George be the only one who suffers through stuff that's been broken and they don't want to fix it
Because it might cost him a dime for a new light bulb on it at the pot
Right
The bulb on George's pot doesn't light up either
Really?
We're still talking about the same thing?
Uh-huh
Yeah, we're talking about having pot problems
This is on, this is not a tumor, it's the ones that two hours
You people are just damn bad, if not only you have to be watered by that, then it's passion
But if I wanted to buy some time on your station, I couldn't, you don't have real people that send, uh, you have to worry
You don't have it on your regular number?
I always have to be a guest, I'm one of your talk shows, or an acting at your AM at WIOD
They won't even throw me back to tell me what the name of the show is
My work on your station in 1964, I was sort of prominent guy in Miami
I buy time, and I influence people by time
If you people can't get it together to be a better radio station, then if you work on our ad station or an EBS station
I suggest you take your damn frequency, which my grandmother's friend Jesse Jay put on the air in 1926
And you turn the damn thing off and get out of the business
You people ought to be ashamed of yourselves, my name is Robyn Young
And the telephone number is a motel in Miami, room 13
You people ought to be ashamed, you shouldn't even be running that facility
I used to be the boss of the damn thing in 1926
I ran to the damn thing and I was wearing a mask
You are terrible, you have no credibility in the radio
Now, I damn it all to death before I get on the phone detention
You get on the phone to me, and you get me to take this gun
I'm gonna throw a lot more if the sale goes through
But it will be because you're doing anyhow
There you go, Robyn goes nuts
Okay, I just came up with a little improvisation here, how does that sound?
That sounds fine
Does it really?
Sure, we'll see that's the guest mic, which I never use
Well, that pot works as it's never been turned on
And yet it's a little different somehow
That's why I was gonna ask, is it better or is it worse?
I don't want something like YOLLY
No, no, it's got like, I don't know some of the words
Like, we were to it or something?
It's got a little reverb to it?
Maybe now
Oh wow, yeah, now it's got a lot
Alright, so that's what I'm gonna do because this is the one
Evidently, we're not gonna get a engineering assistants here in the studio
Which of course is just a grotesque and totally unprofessional unacceptable
But Norma's too busy, we're gonna about it so
Well, it's the holidays, you know, it's all cheese, you know
It's the holidays season
Yeah, so hip-hop
That's what I got
And whoop-dew
Some people got a real person for an agent, I got a flower
Pants, excuse me now, I gotta go poo
WDQ not again, QAM hello
Hello, Neil
Yes, sir
How are you doing today?
Good, how do I sound on this microphone, sir?
You sound excellent, Neil
Yes, I do
You've never sounded better in your life
I had a question, I know you eat in a root crisp, I've eaten in a root crisp steak
You've eaten there, yeah?
Yeah, it's very good, actually that's not as Vegas
Anyways, have you ever been to Ziggy and Matt goes here?
Yeah, I don't wanna hear about Vegas, I don't wanna hear about your slot, either, okay, Schmuck?
No kidding
WDQ, A.M, hello
Hi, Neil
Yes, sir
Problem solved, I heard through
You're a problem, alright, I get it
Put the period at the end of the first word there, okay?
You're a problem, not a solver, just a problem
9.52 on a survey, when we get to a thousand, I'm not giving the results
Yeah, this mic seems more vibrant, more alive
You know what, doesn't it?
Or is it just my imagination?
It was just my mind
It could be the reverb or the whatever echo coming from the speakers, I'm not sure, but it's a little bit different
Well, what does that mean?
I mean, I haven't adjusted the overhead, it's the same where it was before
What would you be talking about, Mr. Howe?
And what does that have to do with ball games and jockstraps and coaches?
Hey coach, go!
Nothing, all the way Greg Lowe will be in touch with you, George already spoke to him
Well, thank God for that, he's a real engineer, Greg Lowe, he does a good job here
How many weeks and months of gnashing and screaming and begging to this take, huh?
To finally maybe get an engineer up here?
Which I don't wanna again give the reasons why he isn't coming here, but there's a lot of rumors about that
WDQ-YM has got nothing to do with me either, Q-YM Hello
I want Mirsch loves to tend to squal me
Yeah, ah, ah!
WDQ-YM Hello
George is very scared, why does he...
WDQ-YM Hello
Hello, I'm Antomano
Q-YM Hello
Are we politicians, please be careful
WDQ-YM Hello
Oh, he had no material there for your boyfriend
You know what's that?
No, not new
What? Not new
I think all the new year people are like, you know, trying out some new stuff for the new year
Of course it won't change next week or next month or seven weeks from Sookas, it'll still be the same
Like this one, Q-YM
I mean, just the fact that...
US Kudo all futures hit a record, $100 a barrel today
Sir, thank you Mr. President for the low gas prices
Surging more than $4 as violence in OPEC members, Nigerian Algeria combined with a weak dollar
And cold snap to boost crude futures
Cold snap my ass
And believe me, you probably could right now
Let me see if the temperature is rising, okay, just a little tiny bit
When I got up this morning was minus 14 and it's still minus 13
And the high today is only going to be minus 11
But with a big sun on there and a big sun on for tomorrow and a minus 6
And then Friday a minus 2 and Saturday a plus 2
There's your Toronto weather which I know is captivating, simulating radio
And if you don't like it too bad
Better cold snap and Florida near record temperatures, what was it 59 last night?
I think so something like that
Don't tell me George is out again
Right here, I thought maybe you were on the move again
Literally, I could be
On the move again?
Without notice, unless you want me to give you some notice, I'll you know
Fresh buying at the new year was also cited as helping lift the oil futures complex
On the New York mercantile exchange at 1217 less than an hour ago, February crude was up $2.67
Or 9865 a barrel
Trading from 9605 to $100 even a record front month high, eclipsing the previous record, a 9929 set in November 21
How do you like that? I bet you the S&P is down now for that jackass that wants us all to gamble away our money
I'd rather go to Woodbuy
At least once upon a time you have a good time
Let's see, let me see if the S&P is, let me get on that channel. What is it 184 my cable?
Oh power lunch
Oil 9885 see it's back down under 100 what are you getting excited about?
Oh 9879 see it's coming up but the S&P is down almost 22 points
It's not for simpitously how do you like that? Oh my god
Jackass
Man you just wait you ain't see nothing yet if this oil thing keeps up like that
How about $200 a barrel? How about $10 a gallon for gas? What do you think?
You think we ought to get a new job somewhere close to where you live? It doesn't matter
You can hitchhike, sure
You can be the hitcher maybe wreck your howrel pick you up it could be in the Nome Alaska
A house resolution when P2S Vice President Dick Cheney Dennis Gussinich's HR 799 bill is gathering more support
Why I do like this other mic much better how come he didn't tell me like five years ago to use this one?
Yeah the national impeachment continues to grow and generate increasing interest in being referred to the House Judiciary Committee last month
A Christmas spokesperson said
As a member of that committee representative Bobby Rexler and two other committee members
Luis Gudiera's and Tammy Baldwin have joined together in demanding that the legal action against Cheney moves forward
And there's a picture of Dick right here and in the background there's Conda Lisa. Oh my God. What a nasty bitch
She's got the most sour look on her pusman. You think she was you think her stuff didn't stink man
Talk about arrogant condescending sell out bitch
Well, Dr. Rice, you remember that with the Fox News? Heather that's right. Oh yeah
Congressman Bobby Westler, Florida, great guy
I just want to like the official who says the charges are too serious to ignore. There's credible evidence that the Vice President abused the power of his office
And not only brought us into an honest on a serious war but violated the civil liberties and privacy of American citizens
It is the constitutional duty of Congress to hold impeachment hearings
You said they went on to say he went on to say believes the Cheney and the Bush administration have demonstrated a consistent pattern of
Abusing the law and misleading Congress and American people but on this mic I can't read quite so good
I make a lot of mistakes but you know what does make any difference because they're not all they want to hear this out of my voice
So they can call and say hi Ron. You know good stuff like that right?
We see the consequences of these actions and brought in Iraq and at home through the violations of our civil liberties
Wexler said Congress will maintain involvement Wisconsin said in August that published reports identified
The Vice President's willful and repeated this regard for the rule of law international treaties
Environmental protections in the common good
Wexler involved when joined congressman Luis Guidillas in pending an op-ed that calls for committee hearings on a building of peach chaining
On a variety of charges that include allegations of manipulating intelligence that boosts the case for the war with Iraq
A very serious charge very serious
House leaders and leading democratic presidents of candidates high ever don't support impeachment
One thing they point to is the time frame and expense that surrounded the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton
citing how the business of politics in the US ground to a near standstill as the nation's attention was diverted by the effort to expose the president over a sex act with a White House intern
Gudi Err is saying hearings need not to type congress for a year and shut down the nation
A sex act with a world that's what happened with this bunch we got in there with these neo-con neo-Nazi bastards
A sex act screwing the entire world that sounds like a sex act to me
Not to mention the 4,000 American troops who are dead and the hundreds of thousands if not a million Iraqis
Yeah, what's a few dead people man look at those low gas prices
Oh look at that they're all whipped up on CNN there all Iowa caucus countdown
There's a Barack Obama with his kids hey a little oblique couldn't hurt Barack make him think you're white
Can you imagine if he was white he would he would win in a fight
Oh yeah
I mean he just his heads and shoulders above slippery and everywhere I mean Edwards is just uh...
It's he's just a haircut him and Mitt Romney the battle of the haircut but he's got a draw on that can only help
You mean John Edwards yeah
Yeah John Edwards Johnny Boy he's a good old boy and that's what our collection is
I'm basically a bunch of red next I remember Jimmy Carter I think it used to be a part of Jimmy Carter
He was dumb and he had no uh... wasn't dumb and he had no personality
He had a draw but he had a draw
He's rather used to drink a lot of Billy beer and pee a lot outdoors
Yeah well
He okay and answered him because they got they got pee places outside
I do one of those two things a lot
But with Billy Carter was just the whole outside that was his pee place
Speaking of that here's the Assurme 962 you got the thousand made I think you got to lick
No we'll get it
Oh there's that Dana Bash boy I tell you one thing
Where's the baseball bat and look at that look at the donkey key she's got
No look at that nope
Well I'll tell you what's happening on the Republican side
He's got those senior wedges lips you know where he used to be with the hand
And he's got donkey teeth and a little tiny pin head
She looks like one of those Zavoudem dog
What do they call them?
Voodoo dolls
Is that what they are?
No they're like the shrunken head
Yeah
What do they call those?
Shrunken head doll
Oh 962 on the survey
You consider yourself exclusively heterosexual 743
77.2%
Bisexual 80 now let's see
Did we put the uh...
I didn't send her a canoe pole for tomorrow yet
Why better get on that shouldn't I?
I don't have any good pole for that
Oh let me affect you some stuff that I put it up
Would you better get on it because I don't think I've fixed him on that
No but I already don't believe so
Sorry Eric
Bisexual 80
Exclusively a homo sexual 53
5.5% homos
Not sure 52
5.4%
And a sexual 34
3.5%
There's my cuckabee
Fine because the pole says
Oh my god I don't think he's even got a penis
I really don't
My cuckabee
Phony baloney
And if he does got only knows where it's been
Because he's not one important Christian's man
It's a quest...
It's a battle of the religion
It's a battle of the Getskis
The God Squad
Which one's got the real Tony?
Which one's got the real God?
Now what are you gonna send me?
Some poles from Charlie B
No
I'll be nice to him
Who else is helping that
That's right who works his feverishly hard to send us to swirly Charlie
But they can't all be good
We like it Charlie
We enjoy his male logic

It looks like a pic
He knows you, doesn't even look like siz
I am not gay.
I never have been gay.
Gay, gay, gay, gay, not gay.
That's a little guy.
I hear the voices.
I'm a commander, guy.
We are the Moon-Denights.
And our culture is advanced beyond all that you can possibly comprehend with the
100% of your brain.
What did you rack up to do with what?
Nothing.
Oh God, why did anybody tell you?
Oh my God, my insides are on fire!
No please, no more.
Get the phone.
Okay, okay.
I think it's all gone.
I don't want it.
Peter, I need you to hold my ear.
I don't want it.
I don't want it.
Boy, I sure like this other mic.
My guess mic is so much better.
It makes me feel like the guest on the show, you know what?
Yeah.
And it's a little bit, I don't know, a little twirpy sounding.
Not twirpy sounding.
I don't know, like a little bit of an echo there.
It's not bad.
It's not a bad sound.
It's not a bad sound?
No.
The other one might sound better.
What?
The other one might sound better.
It does?
Why don't you use a bullet?
It's a taste test.
Okay, here's the, what's the story?
Uh-oh.
You got it potted down.
No, I don't.
There it is.
Oh, I was just going to...
Talking into the wrong way.
I'm not talking into what.
What a jerk.
What an idiot.
Yeah, that sounds better.
It does?
Yeah.
That guess mic is kind of muffly.
I thought it was like kind of tinny sounding.
Yeah.
So I got to go back to this?
Yeah, yeah.
But that's okay because the engineers coming anyway.
One of these did.
They say when, what year would them...
They said he would be in touch with you.
He would touch me?
Oh, I don't think so.
In the morning.
Oh, in the morning?
Yes.
Good.
He's a good guy.
Anybody knows his crap.
And I sure hope he's getting compensated.
Yeah, well, you can hope.
No comment now.
No comment.
We've got daytime here, man.
We have an understanding.
Remembering Godfather 3?
Mm-hmm.
And he said we have an understanding.
And then of course they killed him.
What is that?
Deon Warwick.
I mean, a diet of Ross, sorry.
Touch me in the morning.
Oh, do you see me in the morning?
Wow.
Yes, sir.
I rather...
I rather touch Jim Morrison even now that he's dead than the band of Ross.
He was hearing.
You what I'm saying?
Yes, he was.
All right.
He's hearing dead.
Oh, come on now.
From all to all to all not to see me.
Okay, I see him.
He's still alive, by the way, Jim Morrison.
He's running around in France with ants in his pants.
So here's a little more.
I'm better than Zerbuto.
She's still dead, by the way, in case anybody's keeping track.
At the time she was assassinated, Pakistan.
Now, let me just ask you this question before I read this story.
Mm-hmm.
If I went to Woodline today at two o'clock, would that be breaking my New Year's resolution
to go less?
I didn't say it was never going to go again.
We ought to ask Chris.
Well, how often do you go again?
I think he said he weren't going to go again.
How often do you normally go?
I never said that.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm so sorry I asked you because you're such a tub of lies.
How orphan do you go?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, let me ask you this.
Have you ever seen Joe Bell and Chris together?
Same person.
Yes, just the sportive.
Oh, you were together?
And what did he say to you, Chris?
He was standing to me.
Why not?
Because George, do you see him on potatoes?
Do you see him on potatoes now?
Like, fairly tough potatoes.
No one else is around.
Oh.
I don't blame him.
Why did you make that up?
I didn't say it was never going again.
In addition to which, although I did eat yesterday, man, I didn't eat any ice cream,
I don't think.
Oh, yes, I did.
I had two ice cream sandwiches.
Is that bad?
Yeah, it's bad.
It was good.
I didn't say it wasn't ever going to see if you do this ridiculous one.
I'm not going to have any carbs in the next year.
Well, of course, you know, we've all done that.
It's what's the point of doing it.
It's like saying, I'm never going to take a dump in the new year.
You know, I know what's the point of saying that.
You're going to make a resolution and make one that's possible.
Not likely.
And the good news is that my dream field stuff shows up there, I think.
Still having that no phone call yet, though.
From.
From downstairs.
There's a package here for you.
That's what from.
Isn't today Janie with the tooth?
Yes.
Well, when I get back from my blind winner, there'll be a nice package down there for me.
And everybody likes a nice package.
At the time she was assassinated, packaged standing opposition leader, Benizier Boutot,
was just hours away from meeting with two US lawmakers.
They hand them a dossier, alleging that Pakistan's inner service intelligence agency, the ISI,
was plotting with its elections commission to rig the upcoming elections.
God, I hate the way that button keeps flickering and then it goes out.
And I have to hit the thing again.
I know it would be nice to have your mic light on, you know, so you know when you're on the phone.
Yeah, that would be nice.
Sure.
About eight years now.
Uh-huh.
According to CBS News, which is obtained a copy of the reported alleged widespread plans to stuff ballot boxes.
And he doubts.
Oh, there is I shot Musharif.
To stuff ballot boxes, rig voting list and intimidate even kill opposition voters.
Oh, you don't like Musharif?
Guess what?
Too bad.
CNN quotes the document more specifically as saying,
when in opposing candidate is strong in an area, they find a creative conflict at the polling station,
even killing people if necessary, to stop polls at least for three to four hours.
Or even a Bush people weren't that creative.
The report titled another stain on the face of democracy was compiled from Boutot's own services within the police and intelligence services.
It was supposed to be given a Senator Arlen's Spectre and Representative Pat McKinney because Boutot didn't trust the Bush administration.
Which has seen in Pakistan as strongly backing Musharif another crook.
A dictator.
The dossier also accuses Musharif's regime with their hurting USAID and the political dirty tricks,
charging that 90% of the equipment that the USA gave the government of Pakistan to fight terrorism is being used to monitor and keep a check on political opponents.
Pactist Annie Senator Latif Kosa told CBS the ISI has set up a mega computer system which has the capacity to hack any of its computers in Pakistan
and is connected with the elections commission of Pakistan's computers and therefore the lower-term results.
Kosa also charged the computers have been used to change the voter roles.
Pakistan's government called the allegations ludicrous.
We all know him, right? He's rapping the baby.
Yo, yo.
Musharif's top spokesman told CNN he never heard of the dossier but that the allegations were just to packalize laughable and ridiculous.
All this stuff is going on. All these innocent people are dying.
Bloodshed. We invaded a sovereign. Can you remember when Sodom invaded Kuwait?
And the Saudis were peeing in their pants because they figured for sure they were going to be dead.
And we got all indignant. We started a war and we were bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
Iraq, remember that?
I sure do.
But if we invade Iraq and we decide that we're going to like depose their dictator that we put in there in the first place
and we're like occupying the country and starting a civil war and all these thousands and millions of people are dying, then it's okay.
And what is America concerned about? Britney Spears and Hillary Duff and Lindsey Lohan. That's what they're concerned about.
$100 a barrel for oil. What are we worried about? Freaking anode calls body. And we're going to stick it.
$9.78 on the survey. I think you better start pushing a little bit just to make sure you get over the top.
Oh look at that. The Dow is the... Wow, $2.30, $2.5 a dollar is down. How do you like that? I bet you don't like that, do you?
Here comes the bunny. There goes your money.
Feel Roger.
Absolutely.
One more that never led my gear. It's almost midnight time to get me to release here. What the...
He's all my son.
Well we looked it up for our Monday and we came up with the answers all laying sign. Remember that?
What an educational show man. What?
What? You know what? No it's sign. Sign sign. And I didn't play this. We got that one.
And the preview says it will tell us what those crap circles mean.
Where's the one about the Wayne Insigns? Is that under WH? You know what I'm talking about?
We don't want to be playing nothing about Wayne. No way baby.
I'm going to tell you something right now and you can mark it down.
Wayne I sing now.
Oh there's one I would love to play. That's it.
Yeah. Oh come on now. Where's your fun spirit? There's Christod on CNN. Good guy. Very qualified. No chance.
In fact I was just thinking two of the most electable it if they were presented right and if they had any chance.
Joe Biden and Christod. Neither one's got a tournament chance in hell. Neither one of them even makes a blip on a radar scale in the pool.
Like I said this is the best of Republicans could do. Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney too far bison of a different variety.
And Rudy I've been married 400 times Giuliani. Don't do what I do but do what I say. Well this Mike is awful loud. Am I like coming into loud here or what?
No. That's not great. I'm asking Chris he's running aboard.
Nice. I do. I mean he does. It's just awful. I got to cranked up there. This Mike is better than the other one. You're right.
Why do you think that is? I just know what the light was out again. I hate that. I don't know how you've been able to.
Although last time I was down there trying to do a show that was one of the problems.
Remember that every time I would run here and then the overhead you couldn't get a balance in the engineers be running around.
What is wrong? I don't want to go through it. Don't be negative. Don't start out of your first show on the new year be a negative to real.
Don Shula. That was the eruders. That was the eruders. Silence. Who? What? The brains? You've got some nerve. She was myster.
Shine in me like that. What do you do with shoes? You shine them. Right? He's qualified for that.
Although he'd probably do your left shoe twice because he forget that he did it already.
You consider yourself exclusively heterosexual, 766, 77.3% of this audience red-blooded heteros.
Everybody says, oh, that's just a fag show. That's just for a bunch of fairies.
Bisexual 82. Exclusively homosexual. 55.5%. What happened to our 7.3% from last time?
We're losing the fairies, man. Not sure 53.8.3.34.990. I think you're going to make your thousand.
Yes, thank you. What? I think so too. Well, good.
I never did get around to this the other day. This was a kill some good time on those holiday shows.
The beast, which is from a website called BuffaloBeast.com. Not to be confused with our beast.
Speaking of that, we've got to schedule for this. Let me take a look and see who's doing 9.00.
We don't have any 9.00 to midnight tonight because we got you on basketball. Oh, boy. Give me the thing that Hank went on about the Joseph Gackie there.
Oh, my God. What is that all about? 9.00 to 10. The beast is on Friday night for 1 hour. That's more than enough. Right after Dolphins All-Aces.
How'd you like to have to follow Dolphins All-Aces? Chris, that would be great.
I bet you when the book comes out two weeks from tomorrow, when we get the hour by hour,
that the first number of Dolphins All-Aces knows two hours from 7.00 to 9.00 starts with a,
Oh! I bet you anything. Thanks a lot Wayne. And nice to deal here, Jolly Joe.
Oh! Sign in a way our lives. Oh, yeah. The thing of all the fine arrived that they put on and lose money on.
But oh, no. We can't afford it. We've got to cut back. And the interesting part, like Hank said,
they don't negotiate whether we're willing to cut back, which I think both of us would have been very amply by the way.
But oh, no. We don't want to do that. Here's what we're going to paint if you don't like it goodbye.
You know, crazy. And they come up with some number like, what are you talking about?
You know, even George couldn't squeak by what they wanted to pay Chris.
Oh, they offered me something. The Beast's 50 most loads of people in America for 2007.
This is BuffaloBest.com. Number 50, I'll go from the bottom up and I'm not going to be able to do them all today.
So we'll squeeze this through the rest of the week. Okay. And remind me, the rest of the week,
tomorrow on Friday, to squeeze somewhere out. And based on the way things started this morning for both of us,
I think that should be no problem. I'm going back right now. No, you're not during this next break. Are you really? I really am.
What did you eat over the holidays? Well, what's the story with you? What didn't I eat? I guess is the most important question.
Oh, I think I know what are the answers to that. Yeah. That might be the only thing.
Number 50, Nicole Richie. No, in fact, now I think the two things. One, I'm positive.
Number 50, Nicole Richie charges not a brick house, not mighty mighty. Vastly easier than the Sunday morning.
Her criminal exploits, attended by hollow contritions, do an estimable alarm to drug legalization efforts,
while inexplicably adding nothing to the forced derolization debate. Quite possibly a reason that terrorists hate us.
Exhibit A, I've just gone through so much in my life that pulling up my top, doesn't seem like that big a deal.
Sentence, sealed neck high in the outhouse foundation of a popular Mexican spring break destination, draws prompt open.
49, Trent Lott. Charges old school discreet segregationist who switched parties along with strong thermon back when Democrats decided to be nicer to black people.
Retired from the Senate early to the larger new law that mandates a two-year wait between retiring from Congress and becoming a lobbyist, that and the dirt that Larry Flint has on him.
Exhibit A was in the singing senators, a closeted acapella group with John Ascroft, Jim Jeffords, and Larry Craig, not that there's anything wrong with that.
Sentence, accidentally lynched by blind neo-Nazis.
48, Carson Daly. Charges, otherwise too banal for a derision, Daly who caught his, let me be careful, I read this, who cut his schmuck teeth warming musical, similar for tweens on MTV, acted as writers built strike breaker by returning there without them.
Exhibit A, we didn't know he showed employed writers, Sentence forced to appear nightly on the Carson Daly show.
These are, these are kind of cute aren't they?
Okay, if you say something.
In other words, you don't like these?
No.
I haven't got it.
Well, there's only 47 more.
All right.
Come on, boys.
How is Chris doing that poll? We got 1000 yet?
It's not a poll. It's a survey. That's the thing that's for me.
I'd be like 45,000 on it. If we had this gigantic audience, we used to have.
And did we have one lady calling today?
Like we have the Johnny Depp lady, which I noticed that's in the poll.
And I was going there, by the way, I'd surely be.
He did a lot of work on it. All the Johnny Depp movies will do that for Friday, I think.
But we also have to add, I hate Johnny Depp.
I can't imagine, you think there's people who don't like Johnny Depp?
There's got to be, right?
Sure.
I hate Johnny Depp.
Not me, but I mean, that's just adding that to the poll.
Because we got a lot of negative people out there, it's self-floor to man.
Johnny Depp, we hate you.
BAAA! BAA! BAA! BAA!
Number 47, like Huckabee, to which I say,
OOO!
Charges, once worse, they're calculating politicians pretending to be at about Christian,
or a genuine heartland preacher who didn't come from no monkey.
Huckabee is both a Southern Baptist who rejects Darwin, wants to give everyone a gun,
and thinks people with age should be quarantined, and a city corrupt politician
who's never seen a payoff so low he wouldn't stoop to pick it up.
Democrats see Huckabee as easily defeated in the general election,
but they shouldn't be so sure.
Smooth-talking preachers tend to do well in this country.
Huckabee is well-spoken, kind-faced, and the opposite of worldly, he's Obama for Hicks.
Exhibit A, I got into politics because I knew government didn't have the real answers.
That's the real answer, that the real answers lie in accepting Jesus Christ into our lives.
I hope we answer the alarm clock and take this nation back for Jesus.
Sentence just is about to win a GOP nomination.
A freak gust of wind catches Huckabee's excess skin,
and carries him out over the Atlantic where he drifts for hours before God appears to him,
tells him he's a unitarian, and sends him to hell.
Now that was kind of cute.
You didn't like it.
It was cute.
Number 46, Judas Reagan.
Charges is none more to debase the written word than Tom Friedman,
the father-in-appartment attendant at the house overworked 9-11 rescuers,
just so Bernie Kira could plumb her few treason to the shallows.
Contentious working relationship with O.J. Simpson ended with her throat,
disappointingly uncut.
Exhibit A, Reagan books rosters of authors including Rushlin Ball, Robert Borg,
Jenna Jamison, Jose Conceco, Janis Dixon, Dickinson, John Gibson, and John Hannity,
apparently Dracula and the Wolfman had prior obligations.
Sentence, death by a thousand paper cuts.
Holy Makinon, this is Joe Bore on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs,
and you're listening to the Hockey Authority Neal God!
Hello.
I'm calling for Peter Brown.
Speaking.
Peter?
Yes.
I'm Clarence, expert radio program director for Sporthold Radio in Miami.
The only thing that matters.
It's been brought to my attention that you're in the market for a new sporthold gig,
and it won't just so happens that we're working favoritiously
on blowing out our midday talents, so.
Why?
Well, he wants money, but he's just not obedient enough.
Yeah, but wait a minute, what kind of money are we talking about?
Oh, will discuss that later.
Hey, you're just gonna love it down here.
The fun, the sun, the surf, it's paradise!
Give me a number to work with here.
What exactly are you offering me?
Peter, Brown, I want you for my sporthold.
So I can put my hand in your underwear.
You can kiss me when we go on a date.
Then I can bite your aunt and libel on your ear.
Oh, put the foot, pamphlets and the dolphins.
You'll pop your shorts.
With our coverage of ping pong can't get over how I'm earning well over six figures.
Having never known about radio before.
I have a stable now of sportholds, sick with ant-holas.
Not a problem since the management here is sharp as a mots of ball.
Absolutely.
Peter, Brown, I want you for my sporthold.
Peter, Brown, I want you for my sporthold.
Okay, 146, 14 built two, but we better hurry it up.
I only got 46 more names on this list here of the worst, most-slowed people in American 2007.
Now, what was the guy in plan of the ex-wester's name, Dr. Zayevs?
Dr. Zayevs, that was one of them.
Oh, well, I want to make sure I pronounce it right.
Zayevs.
Sounds like Yiddish.
David, grade 45.
Charges the notion of his inside-rest entirely on his trek in resemblance to a shooter-morbable
over Dr. Zayevs.
Start here than a peep with waist-basket.
Grade 3's occasional fake outrage exchanges with various White House press recruiters have
established the reputation as a man, on a parade to confront the big scandals.
Wait a minute, one moment, please.
What?
Probably another message.
Telling you.
Oh, for this?
Forget it.
Okay.
White House recruiters have established his reputation as a man on a parade to confront the big scandals,
once they've been well-mainsfied by better reporters.
Manus just looked by the Valerie Plame scandal completely unnoticed, though every flasher testified
the leaking claims CIA sentenced to regulatory three days before the infamous Novak column ran.
His absurd overcompensatory assurance that he has no problem with being tough now with standing
his penile cleft haircut, much like the warning coloration of venomous reptiles,
betrays his true poisonous nature.
Exhibit A, no dignified reporter would be so visibly happy filling in from Adelaura
on the day's show, sentence quoted by Horses.
44, Hugh Hathner.
Charge is not dating three vacuous sluts for the articles, racially attempting to mainstream
necrophilia, and worst-while-eye kind of virility now forced to martial every faculty,
in maneuvering giraffe-like, his quavering prehensal lips for contract smooches with his
surgically altered concubines, sharing in common with them only arrested adolescents,
and probably some pretty sweet coke.
Exhibit A, idols morbidly luck an octogenarian zeleg on the periphery of every girls'
next-door publicity event, opening domestically and trying to suppress the faint horror of his
impending incontinence, sentenced by Agrobanne.
43, Sherry Shepherd.
Charge's perfectly illustrated creationist level of enlequence he declared her disbelief and evolution,
and was immediately stumped about the shape of the earth explaining her ignorance was due to the fact
that she was too busy feeding her children to acquire rudimentary knowledge about anything presumably.
Further compounded or astonishing lack of basic knowledge, when she authoritatively declared that
Jesus Christ came before the ancient Greeks and that he didn't think anyone predated Christchurch.
Charging by these statements shared probably things there are dragons on the other side of her desk.
Exhibit A, accurately reflects the intelligence of her viewing audience,
sentence pushed off the edge of the earth, Sherry Shepherd.
I've never seen her because I don't watch that show of you, see her?
Yeah, she's fat-blood-tick.
No, well how are you?
Replace the other one, you know, they had to have one.
Right, and then the token fat-blood-tick?
Mm-hmm.
10-11 on the pull, by the way, you got your thousand, Mr. Hunchot.
Yes, we did.
Aren't you proud?
Very proud, you're not.
Could cure us.
Bud Sealeg is number 42.
Charges, his version of the island of Dr. Moro, is even worse than John Frankenheimer's.
The baseball commissioners succeeded in making football the indisputable and several national pastimes.
Followed up the fan-aOA meeting cancellation of the 94 season in the World Series,
the first year without since 1904, by studiously ignoring along with the rest of the management
and tens of thousands of San Franciscans, his players mutating proportions.
A true blue-blooded hypocrite, but reaped undeserved praise for a omissive stewardship
and untold profits for his fellow owners on the back of his grotesquely augmented super soldiers,
and now it's to pretend he shocked about it.
Exhibit A, an irretreivable coward, seemed to have skipped Barry von's record breaking home run in Game and San Francisco,
congratulating the slugger by phone.
Ferris Schienweig repitchment Raphael Parmero remains uncharged for lying to Congress about a steroid use.
Sentence designated BP, a hitting team for giants, denied medical attention over 162 games.
You're right, some of these are pretty weak.
Most 41-Chuck Norris, charges only famous for knowing Bruce Lee.
Churning out Pearl Action built for 30 years, skill as a martial artist greatly exaggerated,
teach value wearing thin, total home gym, walker, Texas Ranger,
once let a little girl battle armed gangsters because she had the power of belief in God.
It doesn't understand evolution despite access to mirrors.
Exhibit A, campaigning for my cock-a-bee, the San Francisco Roadhouse kick from Charles Darwin.
That's a good line.
And number 40, you're a boy, Lou Dobbs.
I don't think I have time to do this before it's long.
We test.
And I don't want to like, uh, do that.
I'll have you do until tomorrow, your buddy Lou Dobbs, who never met any of Mexican he liked.
And you know what?
What?
You may have had a point.
He may have had a point.
I just haven't met all that many Mexicans.
No, I take that back too many.
I see what.
No, it's just, you know, nothing.
You know how it is.
I've been many and only met what I didn't like.
Well, good for you.
I've met several.
I didn't like all that much.
Okay, we got a thousand and fourteen votes on the pool.
You can see to yourself, it's a sex survey.
Baby, it's not a poll.
I'll maybe look at it.
Maybe it looks like a poll.
You can see to yourself exclusively heterosexual, seven hundred eighty two, seventy seven point one percent.
Bisexual, eighty six, eight point four percent.
Why do you think we have more bi people under now?
Is the bi-population growing?
Maybe some of the gay people have, you know, branched out.
They put their branch out.
That could be.
Not sure fifty six.
Oh, maybe that should be the logo for the station.
You're listening to not sure fifty six.
A worse, you're all right.
Jock sniffing luck jobs.
That's what we are.
You're sure exclusively homosexual only fifty five, five point four percent.
What's happened to our queens?
You're asking me.
I don't keep asking you.
Where did they all go?
Where did all the fairies go?
Yeah, they probably hear, man.
Oh, it was.
Thirty five, only three point four percent.
A sexual out of a thousand fourteen.
Not thrilling, but it's an oldie we're good against.
Thanks again to Charlie B for that nice pile.
George says eating his pile came next to that.
Stay high.
Hey, my heavy town.
At five six o'clock.
WQA.
I've been drinking and driving so long.
I can't see why he's wrong.
He totally smashed by the time I get to be nice.
But the cop didn't see my point.
So I need him and the brunt what a tender long.
Forget the witches all I meant.
I just need a good fail bond man.
To get me out of here so I can have more hit and run.
Like a real stone cowboy.
Getting liqueurred up and doing about a hundred and three.
Like a real stone cowboy.
Getting into collisions with people I don't even see.
Till they put their handcuffs on me.
Like a real stone cowboy.
Till the booze is the only thing that's gentle on my mind.
Like a real stone cowboy.
Getting hold in your cord for driving while I'm blind.
Like a real stone cowboy.
Getting all liqueurred up and doing about a hundred and three.
Like a real stone cowboy.
