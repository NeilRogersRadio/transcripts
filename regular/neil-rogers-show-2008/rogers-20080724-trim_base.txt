No portion of this program will be produced about the fresh written permission of WQAM BbR test group incorporated.
It's almost here, Saturday, trading down the open. My AMA opens for...
It's a new video.
It's 4th, 4th, 5th, 16th, WQAM.
What? My AMA. For a lot of days.
Oh my god.
Oh my...
Oh my god.
560 WQAM, trussets.
The Neil Ryder is acceptable to talk to Neil.
Dial 560, 560, and day and roward.
It's new carrying.
Call toll free, 87775, Neil, or pound 560 on your AT&T and Verizon wireless phones.
The appendance expressed by Neil, his guests or his colleagues, did not represent those of WQAM.
Now, the Neil Ryder show on 560 WQAM.
I got your probiotics right here, homeboy.
So, brother, you be talking over radio, hey, did not?
You be talking about a phone for me, you ain't what?
That's right.
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
That's the revisar, exactly, that's no.
Oh, no, no, please, it's slow.
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
Now, that's not it.
I'll say, oh, no, I'll be it's slow.
It's out.
Oh, no, no, no, please, it's slow.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...
Oh, great job.
Damn, great job.
Oh, yeah?
That's okay.
Alright, cool, let's go.
Peter Berk!
Oh, those businessmen weren't they?
Sure.
But did they...
Did they get misheaviors?
Well, you didn't think you'd mispedy Lenny and sales even.
I do.
Is that because what's his name is a jerk?
That's among the reasons.
What's his name?
Andrew.
Andrew, you're a jerk, Andrew, an idiot.
Now, what part didn't you want me to talk about on the air?
The fact that he's a moron?
No, you can talk about that.
Oh.
No, he doesn't know how to tell time.
He can't tell time and he doesn't know what we do.
He doesn't know what we do.
He doesn't know what we show to him.
So, what we make in the factory.
And BS with you?
Yeah.
Other than that, he's a strange character.
He's a what?
Strange character.
So, speaking of strange characters, George watched...
There will be a word of blood.
There will be boredom.
There will be ponder.
Maybe that's where they got the thing in Vananza about the ponderosa.
Because it was ponder.
Oh, yeah.
It was ponderous on the ponderosa and that dramatic music.
Every time there were like a bunch of people riding horses around and nothing was really happening.
And the music was just going crazy.
That was the least of my complaints.
At least you had something to listen to while you were being bored.
And that's true.
Kind of woke you up a little bit.
Bastard from a basket.
Bastard from a basket.
Oh, I drink your milk shake.
I drink your milk shake.
Bastard from a basket.
I have a straw.
Yeah.
Oh, you drink your milk shake.
You're doing John Houston during the whole movie, bro.
What a pointless movie.
There was no point.
You're right.
I mean movies generally have a story.
Oh, it's a story.
It was an excellent story about an angel you didn't care about before the devil knows you did for it.
No, it's not.
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah, I can't dump you.
I can press the button, but I still hear it.
Yeah.
So in other words, your audience would not have that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, it's not.
It's just going to be what it's going to be.
Don't get bastard.
Bastard in the basket.
Bastard in the basket.
Bastard in the basket.
Oh, my God.
I kind of think our general manager is a basket case.
So maybe he's a bastard from a basket.
He is just the worst.
See, there you go.
Starting off again.
It's Thursday.
Yeah.
What do you got to get to get to?
I got to get to get to the end Thursday next week.
And then I'm off for like 12 days.
Slacker.
I'm counting.
Yeah, slacker my ass.
Slacker.
You're the one that was out sick on Tuesday, not me.
Yeah, that's me.
I'm here.
Oh, I was supposed to be here.
I'm here.
I'm not calling in sick.
Yeah.
I'm not on my hands in these puking my guts out
because I'm doing too many drugs and banging too many street chicks.
Is there any such thing?
What?
Street chicks.
What are you talking about?
What do you make things up?
Hookers.
What do you make things up?
Sheep hookers.
You think I can afford hookers even if it's you?
Yeah, that's a good point.
Here's the poll.
George's poll from yesterday.
I voted for the winner.
Did you?
In fact, I think mine was one of the first votes I gave us.
Somebody else is sympathy vote, but it was an obvious choice.
The only 312 votes?
What's that?
Well, I started at 10 and then you changed it to 205.
Yeah.
Well, I wasn't going to come back here.
I had no...
I don't know.
It's fine like I care.
I had to hop in the car and get off the woodmine.
Loose some money.
You know that quick hit?
That thing was dynamite for a while.
Now they... they... they... they tantamall down.
They shut him down.
George's poll, what was the best ass kicking in the movies?
312 votes.
My God.
Sonny versus Carlo, the Godfather 51.
It's going to take an hour to read this poll.
You got too many damn names.
Yeah, let's put it on the short from Hollywood poll there.
Oh.
Really bads from Goodfellas 40.
Spartans were... I'm not going to read this.
Okay, good.
No one yet gets ridiculous.
Right.
I stopped at the double digit with...
Predator, Bernouckel's Dutch and Predator 3.
I mean there's all these...
Club or Lange, pounds rocky and rocky, 315.
Basement, beating and fight club 17.
The only reason Sonny versus Carlo wins is because it's from the Godfather.
Mm-hmm.
I mean it was a very good example.
It's perfect answer to that question.
Even though most people didn't want to answer that question,
they wanted to make up their own as usual.
Like what?
Like just fights.
People were calling in fights in movies.
Oh, that was a good fight, which wasn't what we were going for.
But hey, whatever, you know.
Asking now, that was the topic of the poll and asking.
Yeah, a lot of you people out there serve roundly.
I mean the QYM, Asking Central, hello.
Hello, Nell.
Yeah.
My name's Frank Collins.
Yeah.
Thanks.
My name's Frank Collins.
You don't want to.
What?
How you're...
Idiot.
My name's Frank Collins.
I'm a scholar.
And like that.
And that idiot, Ken Charles says, I don't do enough show prep.
So I'm listening to them.
Well, you talk about a guy who's living in a state of delusion.
Mm-hmm.
I'm listening to them for show material.
The I.O.D. online.
I'm sitting here listening to them.
I'm listening to Futsi and Tutsi and many moonios from material.
Many who used to crank call the station.
The I.O.D.
Is that under Manny?
I don't know.
Might be under Rendy.
No, it's under Manny.
He's a liquid.
Peda.
Peda.
Yeah, Rendy.
Peda.
How you doing?
I'm alright, darling.
How you doing?
I got that Manny fire, huh?
I got that Manny fire.
Why'd you get fired?
You're hypocritical.
Oh, it's you, man.
Why does Manny crank call the station?
Because he's an idiot.
Because he's a total idiot.
Former groupie.
He was just a groupie in all of a sudden.
He was on the air.
He got hired.
Isn't that the way it works out?
Yep.
Like Mr. Broward.
What's that?
What's his name?
Jules Adler.
What's his name?
No.
Mr. Broward, right wing obnoxious homophob.
I mean, just...
And his name was Jules Adler, but he wouldn't use his real name on here.
Because he was afraid people would think he was Jewish.
He was a far-bison Catholic.
But Jules Adler sounds Jewish, don't they?
Yep.
Nobody you know.
Sounds Jewish to me.
So he used Mr. Broward on here.
Mr.
What?
I mean, what kind of a name is that?
That would be like Dwight Ford Lauderdale.
I'm talking about a stupid...
You're gonna make up a name, make up a real good name, like...
Damn God!
That's right.
Something easy, something that sounds plausible, like he could be a real name.
Not Mr. Broward.
God.
I think I should write a book, the history of Florida talk radio,
including on the West Coast, the Elacitor.
Yep.
With his bunch of loser callers over there.
Poor Blabo.
I think they killed him, not the diabetes.
I think I really believe that?
Nope.
Well, sounds good though.
Sounds dramatic, like...
BASCHER FROM A BASCHER!
BASCHER FROM A BASCHER!
And he's screaming it out, and of course the kid is still...
The guy is still dead.
Right, yeah.
That...
Having a lot of impact.
No, he was walking down the hall about...
I know, you're right.
He's still screaming.
BASCHER FROM A BASCHER!
And then how did you like the ending?
Oh yeah.
Yeah, like, okay.
I'm finished.
You warned me.
I'm finished.
Yeah.
I mean, I couldn't stand that preacher, obviously.
Nobody could.
The one thing I did enjoy in the movie is when he was getting slapped around and screaming like a woman.
Yeah.
That was...
And there was a lot of guys screaming like a woman.
Yeah.
And then when we were speaking to Ask Kicking, that was a pretty good Ask Kicking.
Yeah.
Yeah.
When he had him down there on the ground and was slapping his face around with him.
And the mud and smeared him with the mud.
Yeah, that was kind of funny, but...
Other than that, yeah.
What is the point?
Yeah.
There wasn't any point.
The point is that it was an epic...
You know what it was like?
It was like a Neil Diamond record.
Dale.
What Neil ever did to you?
Every song that he ever recorded was like a big production.
He was a legend in his own mind, Neil Diamond.
See, I kept asking, is this a true story about a real...
Sweet car.
Or along with the melodramatic music.
You're going to make it play Neil Diamond.
And the songs all suck.
All right, here comes the...
No, I don't play any Neil Diamond.
Come on.
I can't believe he didn't like long fellow serenade.
Oh my.
See, there's another example.
Cracklin' Rose.
Cracklin' Rose is a horror like that, you know.
Crack.
Neil Diamond.
I think you're just an anti-seller.
Oh, see, George?
Are you kidding me?
Next, you're going to tell me that James Woods is doing it.
You need to see the jazz singer.
I have seen it.
Oh, stop.
Stop with the Neil Diamond already, okay?
America is begging you, stop.
Please.
Long fellow serenade.
See what I mean?
Oh, God.
You know what that sounds like?
Stop it.
Stop it.
That sounds exactly like the beginning of the monkeys,
a little bit me, a little bit you.
A little bit.
Didn't he write monkey songs?
You wrote a couple?
Yeah.
What to find out which ones now?
Wow.
Neil Diamond wrote monkey songs?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, not Cracklin' Rose.
Yeah, Crack spoke the Rose.
God.
Ah!
Now, why are you doing this to me?
Because I'm a bastard and a bastard.
Yeah, bastard and a bastard.
You guys, get it.
I'm just going to sit back over there.
I'm about to go down.
I'm about to go down.
Sure.
65 votes already on today's poll.
An assignment.
And they put it on it 205.
You're like a white man.
I'm going to kill it.
South Padre Island, Texas.
If you've seen this guy on CNN,
who's in the middle of the valley.
Oh, he's yeah.
He's probably going to be in the valley.
I mean, this is the all-time worst.
Before, you know, in the past, we'd seen these reporters.
They stand out there in the middle of a storm.
And they're practically getting blown off the face of the earth.
This guy just getting drenched out there.
It's like an act of suicide.
Of course, if you work for CNN,
you'd probably want to commit sausages too, right?
Unless you're a Ricky Tickie Sancho.
Boy, he is emoting so bad these days,
you wouldn't believe it.
Worst than usual.
Emoting.
Ah, a little bit of a bad bit of a...
But hey, that's America for you.
Okay, let's do the break,
and then we'll take a look at today's survey.
It's not a poll, it's a survey.
So we should get 1,000 tallies on her.
Shouldn't we, Chris?
Yeah, I think so.
You think so, what?
We'll get the thousand votes.
From minutes after 10, here's the schedule.
We got the jerk show at two.
Mad Dog 4-650.
First bitch with Jesse A.
was 650 to 7, which is an industry joke.
Seven o'clock dolphins tonight,
which is not a joke.
It's not a laughing matter.
Trust me.
And then Curtis for a DA to 11.
DA who's been filling in for Joe Rosal,
week long, talking about the Marlon fans
and how come they won't show up because the media...
because of the herald.
Oh, is that why?
We keep talking about the fact that nobody shows up.
I thought it was for the lady.
It was also a bit of that brage loss last night,
and it was again huge chunks of empty orange seats.
Huge!
Chris?
Okay.
Huge chunks of people disguised as empty orange seats.
What do you want me to do about it?
Go out there and support your team, baby.
We love the Marlins!
They're in your first place!
Bye-bye-bye.
Yeah.
Come on.
You buy them to take us along.
No, I'm not buying you nothing.
No!
No!
Neil Rogers, guys.
Hey, ice cream lovers.
First, there was Ben and Jerry.
Now there.
Something new.
Hi, I'm Neil.
I'm Bob.
Rabbit Taze.
Yes, Neil and Bob's gourmet ice cream.
What exciting new flavors like.
Buggical surprise.
Blueberry and sorb behind.
Neil and Bob's gourmet ice cream.
Have a look.
Oh, if there's a movie that you definitely don't want to see,
all you people, shutters, the name of the movie, didn't it?
The only reason I got it is because I went to pick up before they never know what you did.
Also, a real, my own personal copy of There Will Be Bloods,
but I can watch it again and make positive sure it won't be bad.
And it was.
And then I happened to see Shutter in there,
and I'd seen the previews for that on TV,
and they'd like, oh, it's one of the scariest things all of it.
It's a piece of garbage, man.
It's about a scary as somebody with an egg fart.
It's just there's nothing scary at all.
And I got halfway through it, and I just, I refused to watch the rest.
I won't watch it.
Okay.
Have you, I don't know what to think about it.
Shutter.
No, I don't know it.
It's about this photographer and he gets married.
And they keep seeing it.
And that was the scary part.
And they keep seeing these ghost pictures.
There's chick, I don't know.
I don't know what I don't care.
I don't want it.
It's just boring.
It's kind of like There Will Be Blood, but even more boring.
If that's possible.
WQAM.
Very cutting-edge.
Okay. WQAM.
Hello.
QAM.
Colonial.
Yes.
I find it interesting that Nils Woffgren has written an album of all Neil Young songs.
Yeah.
Um, let me know.
But you know what?
About the movies or whatever you talk about.
Oh, okay.
Let him know.
Yeah, we'll see if it's a little bit.
By Western Union.
Who was it?
Did Western Union the fifth, the five, uh, five Americans?
Is that the name of the group?
I don't know.
You don't have Western Union in your collection of fantastic hits?
Look at them.
The five Americans is the name of the group.
There it is.
Yes.
Good song from 1966 to 1959.
60-S.
50-S.
50-S.
And the fourth verse is that.
Aeswet's grown three.
That news has came away.
It's better than Neil Diamond.
I'll tell you that.
A Lake Worth re-tirey hit the jackpot.
At the Seminole Casino Coconut Creek on Saturday,
winning more than $2 million on the quarter-slot.
Well, the quarter-slot guy, it's not our quarter-slot guy, though.
We know because our quarter-slot guy called on Tuesday.
That's schmuck.
And I write Chris when George was out sick.
Yep.
Zach was on for you on Tuesday, by the way.
And Zach was kissing the DA's ass the Tuesday morning.
And I chastised it for him the whole show, but he, yeah.
And he also admitted that he was the one responsible
for you guys not being able to get to free food anymore.
That's right.
Oh, you know the story?
Yeah, I know the story.
I still don't blame Zach.
Well, he took the blame himself.
Never the left.
He said he opened up a stupid mouth and said,
and my suggestion was that everybody ordered a lot of food
and just put the bill on Joe Bell's door.
Just take the tape and take it.
That's right.
It's an expensive count.
So then that way you won't be getting food that you know,
you're plug-in.
Somebody will be paying for it.
Somebody will be hitting or the station or somebody.
Quit being such a cheap ass Joe Bell, my God.
It isn't bad enough if you want the people to work for free
then you don't want them even to get any free food.
What kind of a grave robbing bastard in a basket are you, my God?
And don't send me any more damn messages either.
Zero way I can block him.
I guess I could, can I?
Yes.
No, I can't.
You keep saying yes.
I try to block all these vigrees.
See, all those things are getting on my expression.
And y'all keep keeping their addresses.
Oh my God.
Dorothy Williams wants you to know that you can get that thing up again.
Oh Dorothy, just go away.
Two million twenty nine thousand five hundred and five dollars
and thirty four cents to be exact.
The amount has stopped to be a Florida record for a slot's payout.
Nearly double the previous record of one point one million one
and march at the same casino by a nurse from Margate.
Seminole, casino, coconut creek, uh, place.
Casino officials did not name the 65 year old winner
who requested that his identity be kept secret.
65, my God, that's old.
You're out there pretty soon.
I'm going to be 66.
Yeah.
Well, at least then it won't be 65 anymore.
Great.
Saturday's payout came from a biggest slot machine connected
to the other travel casinos across the country.
The odds are harder but the large pool of slots nationwide
makes the payouts that much bigger.
And guess what he won on?
Wheel of Fortune.
Oh, you've got it there.
So, the 65 year old won on a Wheel of Fortune quarter slot machine
is five days to decide whether to take the lump sum payout
or 25 payments over time.
And the reason he has to make that decision is because in Florida
and all across the US, you've got to pay taxes on gambling winnings
which is the most outrageous pile of crap.
I mean, the odds are stacked so bad against you
and you finally win something.
Oh, what would you like that in an annuity?
And, you know, if you live to be 100, you might get the money.
What a bunch of crap.
Lump sum or 25 payments over time.
You got 65 years old already, okay?
What do you want him to live to be 100?
So, he can collect all the money.
Just give me a check for the $2 million, $29,595, and $34.
That's what I say.
And cut the crap.
WQA and hello.
WQA and hello.
Neil.
Yes.
This is Brady Quinn.
I want you inside my box.
QA and hello.
Hey, Dr. Neil.
Speaking.
Yeah, what's going on, bro?
What do you got?
I got the money.
I just want to call.
And, oh, he just wanted to call.
I don't have anything to say.
He just wanted to call.
Yeah, that picture of Brady Quinn is on our website now.
Yeah.
Now, it Christians that Brady is simulating oral sex in that picture.
I have to go look at it, though.
Yeah.
But he's half naked in there, but he's also got his arm in front of his beautiful body.
I mean, you know, and he's got this other guy who don't look too bad either.
Half naked standing there.
Every time you see Brady Quinn, it's with a bunch of naked guys.
Anyway, hands on guys, crutches instead of like that.
Exactly what he's doing.
No kidding.
No kidding.
Oh, you said it like that.
Why do you think he's doing all these treats?
He's treating me like I'm just a bit like a sub-lucidal.
Chris is delusional, but they have to side the point.
Chris is delusional.
Like your work here, sir.
Yeah, that's right.
It works for peanuts.
And he can't even accept the peanuts unless he pays for them.
Because Joel Bell is a bastard from a basket.
Bastard from a basket.
I mean, it's just not as the movie only boring and inane.
None of it makes any sense.
No.
And you already know when he puts the kid on the train, you already know he's going to abandon.
Yeah.
I abandon my son.
He wasn't too credible there in church when he was receiving the...
No, but he went over the price to whatever that was.
He was funny. He was going to be baptized.
Yeah, I know that.
See, there he goes again.
Like I'm still alive.
Kind of an imbecile.
I don't know. He's going to be baptized while they're shooting on one eye to him.
You said what he was receiving the blood of Christ.
Whatever the hell he was receiving, okay?
He was taking it back somewhere.
And he never had a wife, you know?
No, I know.
They kept asking him all during the movie and I think there's some message in there.
Who's that guy who was living with him?
I'm finished.
And it didn't make any difference.
He had so much money that I guess he could get away and do whatever the hell he wanted.
Is that part of the point?
And you notice there was no blood when he shot...
He shot his fake brother in the head twice.
And there was no blood.
I think it was on the other side.
And even though the movie isn't color or course, but it might as well have been long
the scene just in black and white.
Like when he finally bashes Eli overhead with a bowling pin and splits his skull open
and the pool of blood is forming on a bowling alley and the blood is black.
687...oh, did I ever read this?
And I read this pool.
What's the highest level of school in you completed?
It's a survey. Some college, 228.

1033, I was just reading some crap on the internet
You know there's a lot of interesting crap on the internet about race announcers
Okay
And I had nothing to do with race callers but I was aligned about Harry Curie
In the middle of a Cubs game he yelled out
Oh look at who's down in the crowd, there's Saka is here
Yeah
Yeah, what's wrong with that? So Harry liked his porno, what's wrong with that?
He was an old drunk, why not?
Old Provo?
We can respect that, we like that
We like Proverts on his show
Sure
So show about Proverts broadcast by Proverts and of course bastards from the basket
A Boone County woman, where's Boone County?
Oh this is Indiana
Is that named after Pat Boone?
But maybe
Or Boone Pickens, T-Boone Pickens who's saying, oh no don't you get that oil now?
We're gonna weld, man, what a nut job
Have you seen those spots?
Yeah
A Boone County woman accidentally stabbed herself in the photo with a 36 insured using a Wicked
Ceremony in 11th and Seminary Police
I heard that story
You did?
Yes, I did
Sure did
According to 11 on Police Department News release, Katherine Gunther 36 was performing a Wicked
Ceremony of thanks in Oak Hill Cemetery around 1215 Saturday morning when she ran the
blade through her left foot
She said in an interview Monday that she'd had a lot of good luck recently wanting to give
thanks with the right
Gunther said she was aiming to put a sword in the ground with accidentally hit her foot
A sword
It wasn't the first time I performed a ritual but it was the first time I put a sword through
my foot she said she immediately pulled the sword out of her foot and her companions transported
her to with him at Memorial Hospital
According to police, no charges expected to be filed in the case
Although Gunther and her friends were worn against trespassing in the cemetery after established
visiting hours with her Wicked Crap
I wonder if she knows any
Bastards of the Bastard
That was just the icing on the cake that scene
Just a proofy was a hard ass old
Bastard
And as if we didn't already know it
We already have a pretty good idea that it was a heartless, cruel, rotten son of a bitch
And we already know that
You bet
You're saying yeah and the whole movie
Right
And so what's the point?
Right
He's a nasty rotten old
Thieving piece of turd and what else?
I can't tell you that
Is this a true story because that's the only excuse that you'd have to raise a story
Yeah, but no it's a made up story so what's the point?
WQAM, hello
QAM, chewing line
Hey, yeah and then that's the scene with the when he calls him a bastard and the bastard
Is that you call a BY competitor?
Don't you know that?
Yeah
But listen, Neil, Neil
Don't wait anymore
The best movie is Eastern
Promises don't drag your feet anymore
Why?
Which is the bastard and the bastard
Why is it going away somewhere?
No, but I don't know you keep talking about
Some other movies on

Do you want to get the movies at Eastern Prom?

I was going to hit the apple on the yesterday
Yeah, get with it
I'm going to start taking better notes man
Okay
See ya
A campaigner against Heathrow Airports
Third Runways attempted to glue himself to Gordon Brown at a Downing Street Reception
Dan Glass, a member of Plain Stupid, that's PLA and E
was about to receive an award from the Prime Minister when he stuck out his superglueed hand and touched his sleeve
Plain Stupid says Mr. Glass from North London and glued his hand to Mr. Brown's jacket as he shook his hand
But Downing Street said there have been no stickiness of any significance
It was a sticky situation
Plain Stupid recently deemed publicity by mounting a protest on the roof of Parliament
Spokesman Graham Thompson said Mr. Glass, a 24-year-old post-graduate student at Strathclyde University
Had smuggled a small amount of glue through Downing Street Security checks and his underwear at about 1700
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
He smuggled the glue and his undies, I'll ride
Mr. Thompson said his organization was attempting to make Mr. Brown stick to his environmental promises
Isn't that cute?
Little play on words?
Not?
Those staggy brits man, they got a sort of name
Or what?
Makes you wonder how the Helmatti Python was so funny, because all the other brits
Really just tragic
Including that Mr. Bean?
Right, maybe that's why
Why?
They're all pent up, you know, so that when they do comedy they really go into it
Money Python was the only funny British people I ever can, you come up with another one?
Ah...
Good point, let me think about that
What was that faulty towers?
Yeah, well that was a spinoff kind of, that was John Cleese
That was, but it was crap
It was not funny though
No, and either was Mr. Bean
He's a has-been if you ask me
Kind of like me, a has-been
The uh...
And Fuzzi, what do you call it?
The show that he was in, not the Mr. Bean character, but the Black Adder
The one series, just the one, was very funny
The Black Adder?
Yeah, there was a whole bunch of different Black Adder serieses
Starring him in a bunch of other people
But the Black Adder was a snake
It is, it's the name of a TV show also
Well what's since the Zemmeng?
Is that like, Money Python?
That was the name of the character that does
Is that like, Money Python?
Yes, it's a rip off of that
No
Snake names?
Yeah, there it is
709 tallies on our survey
What's the highest level of school you've completed?
Is there any point in reading it?
Look at all the educated people we got out there
And obviously they're smart enough not to call
The biggest name?
The best tallies
The new projects, the sportland of 5.50 QAM
The fourth leader
Bill, this is Randy West
And if you can't tell the difference between me and Ron Jeremy
You should try girls
Did you know anything about chocolate?
From my controversy, your old mayor of New Orleans
Comes a brand new chocolate treat
This will be chocolate
Racist peanut buttercups
How do you make chocolate?
Pizza dough, Reese's grinders, dark chocolate
You take dark chocolate?
Sir, I'm in a super dome with peanut butter
And because it's Ray Nagan's racist peanut buttercups
All the peanut butter has been moved out
And replaced with chocolate
That's the chocolate I'm talking about
Just a way God intended
It's the way God wants it to be
And you should try the delicious new chocolate drink
Nagan's quick
It makes it with white milk
And it becomes a delicious drink
And for chocolate, family, they want chocolate
They try racist pieces
You can't have chocolate no other way
You can't have it, 16 to 11
Now I just put away my two discs
Okay, then I had me a CD
If I turn the CD decks off
Because I'm playing all oldie moldies today
You notice that?
Yes I have
I'm not all oldie moldies today
Now we haven't heard in a long time
All right
Can you play some Mickey and Eisner?
No
Doesn't that just rhyme you after a while?
Yeah
Although we didn't have three lady collars on Tuesday
Isn't that exciting?
That is exciting
Wasn't that good Chris? We had good collars on Tuesday
A few aren't too bad
Yeah, we had a couple of them
Yeah, we had a couple of them
We had a couple of them
Yeah, we had a couple of them
It was a decent show, even without you
Gee
Not because you weren't here
But just, you know, you just missed a decent show
I'm not going to say it's going to happen again
Maybe I'll listen to the archives
No, I know
Now listen to Ken Charles on IOD
Who?
Then you won't have to do any show prep
How many QA and Hull?
Hey Neil
Yes sir
Hey, Daddy, that used to be a pharmacist
Pretty damn good thought over the weekend
What works as a doctor?
It is about a Russian connected mafia guy
Who's living in London with a bunch of prostos
The heroin
If people kill each other
And beat the crap out of each other
No
It was actually pretty good
But it was quite a nice, suspenseful drama with this
It's two hours, what's the big deal?
Nothing
That and A, does that have a great damage at how he's going to get before
Okay, go ahead
Did you pay for it?
No, he was in, he's gone
He's gone
Oh well
Well, I want to find out if he paid for it
Because if he didn't pay for it, Johnny Joe is going to come out
That's right, he was door-dumped
He's going to give him one four
I still have that memo here somewhere
A lot of people in the summertime
They're here, they're there, they're gone
Sure
And they miss some of the extremity that goes on here at QAM
Here it is, I saved the memo
dated July 9th
To all staff from Josh Dero
Carbon copy, Joe, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
Bell
Ray Food delivery
From this point moving forward
All food ordered to the radio station
Must be bought and paid for
We can no longer receive food free of charge
Any food or restaurant mentioned on here
Must be tied to a sales or promotions program
You can still talk about restaurants and food on here as it relates to legitimate show content
Well, thank you so much, Clarence, you jackass
You fairy
Oh my god
I get choked up just thinking about it
So just another example of
Johnny Joe Bell being a hard-ass and trying to make everybody miserable
Make everybody as unhappy as they possibly can be
That's his role in life
He's kind of like Daniel Day Lewis in that movie
Daniel Plain-Due
He didn't like anybody, remember?
No, I don't
Didn't like anybody, that's Johnny Joe Bell
He don't like anybody, pretends he likes you but I'd be real
I would definitely not turn my back toward his fan-ass
Alright
Somebody QAM, hello
Nail, I got a movie recommendation
Yeah
Antoine Fisher
What is that?
It's a movie
It's one Fisher
Now, it's a Mishi Fisher
No, Antoine Fisher based on a true story
Ben Tell Washington did it
It came out like three, four years ago I think
Yeah
Very good movie
True story about what?
I'm about to Sky's life
And how he grew up in a foster home
And he was abused
And he came out on top
Oh my god, that's depressing
No, it's a very inspiring
Was he a bastard from a basket?
Yes, but...
Okay, well I've already seen one of those
723 on the survey were going for a thousand a day
Chris's lost his mind
What's leaking good?
Based on what?
Based on the 24th of July and there's nobody in town
And he can go bowling on the streets of South Florida
Because there's nobody around
Nobody with a half a brain
Anybody that's got more than like five dollars to their name
And the opportunity to take the time off
They're gone
You do understand that don't you?
Oh yeah
Uh-huh
And of course I said anybody with more than five bucks to their name
We're slept both of you out
That's nevertheless
Everybody QA and Hello
Now you noticed that I punched it nice and like from
Like a real man
I heard you
Everybody QA and Hello
I'm a bastard
An avasca case
QA and Hello
A vamiro
Yes sir
I um...
I was wanting to tell you I shoved in verandars
So...
Somebody QA and Hello
Yeah, I paid for that sandwich
So Joe Belk is sticking up to that
Okay, in fact here's the rest of the sandwich Joe
And he wants you to stick it deep
Back to him in your ass
An ass sandwich
Yeah, that's right
Back to him
If you took a tug sandwich
That's not what's in it, that's where you stick it
An ass sandwich for jolly Joe
Who's all ass
How do you like that to him sending me an email
Well, how would you react to that?
Well, I don't mean if he sent you one but...
I like Dorit
You'd ignore it?
You wouldn't be a...
If I were you, I would ignore it
Well, man, I'm not paying any attention
I like to shorten, especially at your age
To be wasted, be hard
Don't waste 30 times like I do
Don't have to like it at your home
That he's been at
That he's been at
That he's been at your house
Don't waste a minute of your time on anything
There's a fun one
Fun? When the hell is that start?
That's right
To a clock, I guess
Sure
Now I'm having fun here so far today
It's been a blast
Do you believe me?
No
That jerk's coming up at two o'clock though
We had a caller on Tuesday that it was actually defending that show
Remember Chris?
Um...
He was talking about DA having a point
Because he's so bad and about how all he does is talk about sports
He doesn't do any entertainment
As opposed to jerk suitas
All this other whatever
Oh, okay, yeah
Mm-hmm
As opposed to jerk suitas all at the jive crap
Whatever it is he does
Come at ya!
Come at ya!
Well, whatever that is
What is that?
It's comin' at ya!
I mean, I know what it is
Yeah
Somebody QAM, hello!
What a shame! QAM, hello!
Morning, Neil!
Good morning, sir!
Yes, I just wanted to let you know that
Them cubbies are playing the marlins tonight
Don't care
Don't care
Didn't care last week, won't care next week
And you can take your cubbies and stick them where the moon don't shine
This is the year!
Yeah, this is the year they'll fold up again like an accordion
Keep telling yourself that moron!
Moron!
Idiot!
How the marlins do last night, by the way, did they really lose 9 to 4 in it and somebody just made it up?
Yes, they did
Somebody just made that a probably a Norman Bremen made that up because he said, you know, he don't like the organization
Hey, what are your Norman's on the hill?
What?
Your buddy Richard Simmons is on the hill
Christmas and presidential candidates
In order to let everyone know how important this is
Oh my God
And here I stand with a vision today
Everyone is not a jock!
Everyone cannot play sports!
Everyone cannot run!
But everyone can be fit!
It's not important if you're a jock!
It's important that you have your help!
How about if you were a jock?
Then right now do not have it!
Yes, you don't know anything about QAM!
I have a vision!
I know a very average of Simmons
I just a portion of some of his testimony
Oh, come on!
You know, fun!
They cut him off in mid-screen!
Hey Richard, you're fair!
This is what you're Congress!
This is America's Congress hard at work
So we're told that he will switch into that famous work outware for a rally
And some...
Oh my God, are you smitten me?
How about if he pulls out a deck of cards and all and does deal a meal right there in front of the house?
Oh yeah!
WQAM, hello!
Yes sir!
Hey, did you see a dark night by any chance?
No, I did not!
No, George had a good time!
I was disappointed, I know George was like...
It's kind of disappointed with it!
There was a few good parts!
He's led their play to really good role!
But he's still dead!
But he's still dead!
I thought through the guy said that was the magic trick!
He's still dead though!
He's ruining the movie of purpose!
He can't keep a straight face!
Oh, but uh...
He's taking care of you!
Oh!
What do you mean he's ruining the movie?
He's giving away things of the movie!
He's smart ass, he's a craic, it's schools out!
And he's giving things away!
And he couldn't keep a straight face!
And...
Nothing!
Richard Simmons couldn't keep a straight face!
Well, he couldn't keep a straight face!
Anything, could he?
No!
No!
You ferry!
WQAM, hello!
Oops!
He didn't!
Oh my!
Oh my!
There you go, that's QAM for you!
And in a nutshell, I...
A really...
Nice synopsis there!
I've worked QM's all about!
And I've been with Richard Simmons saying that everybody can be a jock!
But everybody better wear one!
That's the beastly credo man!
You can't always be a jock, but you better wear one!
I do face!
And it's very least you better sniff one!
Especially if Brady Quinn wore it once!
Hey Brady!
You ferry!
What a screamer!
Now, why do you think he's doing all that?
Because all the rumors about him being gay, or maybe he is.
Maybe that's just swishful thinking on my part.
Just a...
It codgers up some real images.
Maybe that's why the doffins didn't draft him.
QAM, hello!
How about that ugly chick that was with him on draft day, Chris?
Is that just his beard?
Oh, that's him, maybe.
That's it, Simmons, is my friend?
WQAM, yeah, birds of a feather.
WQAM, hello!
I'm in the show!
What's that?
Who's the shui-en, hello?
Where's all the white people?
Who's the shui-en, hello?
You're a Neil Great show.
Hey, what's up?
What about it?
It's from Senator Cruz, that's some oldie goblies right there.
Please, I've been asking you for like a month.
Hey, Luke, can you come over to my house to come and grab today?
I know you're listening.
I mean, who the hell is in the house?
5670560, pawn 560.
I think we didn't have some variety here this week,
which really shocks the hell out of me.
Then we had some variety there on Tuesday, Chris?
Yeah, we had more, all of a sudden, more women call us on.
We had some different people, that was my point.
Not that we had the three women.
I just said that a minute ago.
You're like a parrot, you just repeat like they're collars.
Just repeat whatever I say.
Whatever you say.
Well, you're not going to make any money.
How's Josh Cordis doing, by the way?
I see you got the stories up again today, very good.
We had one day, I forget what day it was.
He just didn't bother getting them up at all.
Was it last Monday or Tuesday, whatever day?
Maybe it was Tuesday.
When George was out sick.
Maybe George and Cordis were like hanging out together,
and so I talked to him.
Maybe George was preventing him from doing his debt.
I forget it all out.
Somebody QA him, hello.
Hey, and they'll, how you doing?
Okay, sir.
How's things in Toronto?
Excellent.
A couple of years ago, I took the train from Toronto to Montreal.

Have you ever done anything like that?
No.
Are you against going to Montreal because of a French speaking...
No, that's correct.
I've been there about five times, and I will not be going back.
Do you need a Chorces Deli?
Too many frogs.
No, I didn't need a Chorces Deli.
He doesn't have a Chorces Deli.
No, I don't know where it is, I've seen it.

A lot of open lines and I told me a lot of open things. Oh, and I mentioned on Tuesday and you were out sick
I saw a vacancy again. Okay
Because I knew you liked it. It was all right. I thought you liked it. I like it fine
It was not like a lot of surprises or something and I didn't hate it
Like the pretty strong work I
Give it an adequate
I'm not saying there was any great acting in it. No, it was fine. I mean it was no
There will be blood, but then what I was like off for that
It was just a weed that more exciting than that. Yeah, tad bit
And let me ask you what happened all the rats in the tunnel. I don't know
Remember when they were crawling through the tunnel. Sure time on the way to the orifice and
Then every time somebody was crawling through the tunnel again going back the rats all of that most people they got out
Maybe they are they're on a schedule is that it?
Maybe they went schluffin
The legal fight over that new Florida Marlon Stadium and by the way
Cubsay and Draered with that new stadium. Okay, David Samson you you fairy you fairy you simple idiot
The legal fight is linked ever so tenuously to the fate of a controversial four-lane road project
700 miles away in the Florida Panhandle never learn your lesson in South Florida. Do you?
Let the politicians keep sticking it to you man people must like getting raked it
It must be the momentality they like getting raked it in South Florida
How's the old Miami arena doing?
How's Miami Stadium doing I still think what we ought to do is have a venue on every street corner and arena of stadium
What do you think sure it's not like a starbucks then there be no excuses? Oh, it's so far from where I live
It'll be right there on a corner. That's right. Just like Starbucks and Tim Hortons
They circuit judge Jerry Beth Cohen is delaying a seducision that could make her break the marlin's bid for a new retractable roof stadium on the old
Orange Bullseye. I mean what does it take how many years of nobody showing up does it take before somebody gets the message?
Nobody freaking cares. Don't you get it? I don't give a crap on the a says with his point. Oh, oh, yeah
He just hasn't been around long enough to figure out it's a front-running phony horse ball town. It's not a sports down
Yeah, we got 16 sports stations down, but that's because nobody knows what else to put on a year because they won't let George program the station and
Put the what's your name? Brooke Daniels back on a year. Yeah, there you go
That would be a big hit to babbling Brooke shot
Drag her ass out
For some waxy photo
Autodealer Norman Braeman is challenging legality they three billion dollar downtown Miami mega plan
What a Braeman's arguments the city and county cannot use bonds backed by property taxes
Generated inside community development area districts without putting the project before the voters
And of course they know that if they put this before the voters the voters would say overwhelmingly no no way
They've done pull after pull after pull and believe you me the public don't want no part of it
Judge Cohen and a cubby of elected leaders and bond salesmen across the sunshine state are
Anxiously awaiting a decision by the full-to-supreme court on the case from a scam be a county
I wonder who put the scam in a scam be a county
In May 2006 as scambi county commissioners approved issuing up to
$135 million of bonds to pay for a new four-lane road on Pradido Kean your Pensacola
Dr. Gregory Strands Sudan states the Supreme Court to block the bond issue which would have opened up the island to additional development pressures
As Maria Bacteromo would say the market under pressure. It's under pressure
Just like those bags under her eyes under pressure looks like her eyes are gonna like top right out
That crazy bitch. How's the market doing today by the way George? What?
What you need like what like Doris market?
Yeah, how's Doris market doing?
How is the what's his name doing what's his name?
Our friend down the street from IOD sunny although he was down 113 and a half point
And the S&P is down. Remember the S&P is up guy or the S&P is down I
Can also tell you the price of oil oils going down see what they do. This is the way it works
They get it up to this real
124 point to 16
124 bucks in barrel they get it up to 140 and
Then it gets to 124 which is still way way unacceptable and then they say oh you see it so went down
That's the psychology statement like like gas will be 4 1 1 1 2
And then when it gets to like 399 they'll say oh it's under four dollars a gallon now. What a bargain
That's the way they rape the world. It's all part of the big
Grand scheme to separate you from every dime you can make can find
Anyway, Dr. Strand suit of block go the thing his tell-ass you to your David Therreak said strand believes developers not current
Prodito property of owners should pay to widen the road
Strand argue the state constitution permits this can be county from issuing bonds back with property taxes without
Subjecting the project to a photo referendum. That's what we need in the county of referendum
So the oh here's another one of these facts from the same person again. Remember these on Tuesday. Uh-huh
I
Was it here?
You know this is pathetic
Like I don't already know this Neil just heard you complain you about the lump sum pay out of the seminal casino
You should know it's not specific to the Indians most like jack pots work the same way you get a choice like I don't already know that
I
Mean to the Indians control the lottery no doesn't the lottery work the same way yes
Most like jack pots work the same way you get a choice of an annuity or lump sum
It has nothing to do with Florida State Law or US government taxes sure it does
It is true that if a Canadian citizen wins the jackpot in Canada
They don't have to pay income tax but that's a separate issue
No, if anybody wins the jackpot in Canada whether they're a citizen or not there are no taxes on gambling winnings in Canada a
You moron
In addition to makes no difference if you were a citizen as you'll have to pay tax on it anyway
The US government is the only one in the world that taxes its citizens on all worldwide income which means if you win any jackpot over
$1,200 whether on a cruise international waters any casino or lottery in Macau, Monte Carlo, Canada
You're responsible to be ported to the IRS yourself
Because you know will not report to the IRS is the US obviously has no adjure said let me say again
There are no taxes anywhere in the world on
Gambling winnings in Canada a
So you can just continue writing page after but you know the serious thing
Spend a half hour typing out all this crap and again, then nobody's talking about there are no
Taxes on gambling winnings here a no matter who you are where you came from where you stuck to the
quarter slot
You quizzling you you fair and another guy giving me a lecture on stuff he knows nothing about
And
And yeah, and then it goes on later in the in the facts to say that the US is the only country in the world that taxes of its people on all their gambling winnings
Are you following that all the out of the loop?
All right, yeah, I know you know you need to get money. Oh, yeah
Nobody Q.A.M. Hello
Q.A.M. Hello
I'm Pete
Moon Pickens and I approve this message
Go pick it

Remember that day the snooze crews
Yeah
When we put the tombstone on the water there in front of what used to be WNWS 790 on the dime
Would receive it those you were list bastards. They wouldn't take it bastards in a basket
So now and my wrong is the movie seemed like he goes on for least 10 hours
It I had to watch it until it's told it says better fact. I
Mean to take a break on
head on and on and
They're drilling and the oil is pouring and the people are dying and he's a miserable bastard
Wither without the basket and then that's it. That's the story that we watched for a hundred years
Nothing ever happens
I think the last significant thing that happens is when a kid gets injured
You know and loses his hearing and then that's everything in a movie. Yeah, let's talk about a third of the way through the 40 hours
After that nothing happens except of course he kills Ely with the bowling pin at the end of the movie
Oh, you're just ruining for us good saving you a lot of grief, okay?
I'm saving you the money. And I'm saving 75 hours of your life watching swill
Oh, but it's behind you claimed that's why I'm not gonna watch that no one's the other one is there all raving about that you keep ribbing
No, no hold no, no, please hold that man right oh, yeah
I'm not gonna do it don't

I want to give him a one to make.
But there's no chance at all.
So does that make me a sports queer?
If I want to see him grab the ball.
Absolutely.
Oh, baby, wow.
Look at that kid.
He's waiting on that bright, like gravy with you.
I got a high-density screen that helps me see the sports.
I could do what I want, but I ain't got a never-get-num.
Welcome.
No, the days of a busy school.
Okay, that's not so great.
But I'm personal with a mad name.
At least until at least 28.
I'm ready now.
I want some wings.
You ain't too long and quite like gravy with you.
Oh, baby, wow.
Look at that kid.
You ain't too long and quite like gravy with you.
1118 and 560, WDQ.
I'm thinking like Mr. Potato Head.
If we're going to put Tom Brady's head on Brady Quinn's body.
Yeah, that Brady Quinn might actually enjoy that.
He probably like having Tom Brady's head.
560, 560, I was going to say something else, but I better not because he had joy.
You know, that's right.
Similar, but not exactly the same.
And the board goes back.
What are we going to bring back the good showers like constipation with you downs in our chains?
That was a good show.
You know, remember that show?
Sure did.
I used to play a little with that.
Coach Tricer was a good show.
Yeah.
And the board goes back.
I keep thinking of like a jeopardy in our chain.
What would not our chains?
I can't think of that guy's name ever.
The original host.
Oh, actually, okay.
567, 056, let's get this phone smoking here, man.
It's only 1119 for Christ's sakes.
I'm the 24th of July.
Don't you people want to vote for that Marlon Stadium, huh?
So that the Marlon's, maybe you'll play in a dome stadium.
Wait down here in the end of the swell.
Where nobody wants to go.
And you can pay $100 to park on people's lawn like he used to be in your arms.
You know, because you don't go.
You don't participate.
You don't subsidize all our great sporting events and stuff.
It's my fault.
It's George's fault that the Marlins don't draw flies.
If you would go to the games, more people would show up like Pharrell.
That was the other thing that they were talking about.
The most idiotic thing I ever heard in my life.
About how Pharrell used to promote the Marlins.
And I pointed out he didn't...
The only thing he ever promoted was himself.
Well, it was a collar I called out about that.
Yeah, and he was full of crap.
I didn't know it.
I didn't know it.
Oh, he ever did was promoting himself and create unbelievable nightmarish situations.
Most of which we can't talk about on a year.
Remember that?
Yep.
Does that remember it?
George remembers it.
I remember it.
I'm sure Greg Greed remembers it.
Baa-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah.
Somebody Q&A, hello.
Q&A, Ola.
Hello.
You're the best.
Yeah, I know.
Somebody Q&A, hello.
There you go, how you doing?
Okay.
Hey, how's everybody listening?
How come you don't go to answer them anymore?
I just got back from there.
Oh, beautiful.
You haven't got Daniel.
Well, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Why is it beautiful that I just went there?
Well, what's it to you?
Click.
Yeah, well, yeah, he's gone.
Why does he care whether I go there or not?
Okay, it's boring.
I've given it a first hundred times.
He gets boring.
I mean, there were a lot of interesting people there, and it was packed with tourists, and,
you know, they still got the Albert Hine Express, so, for sandwiches on the dam rack, and
Mickey D's and Kentucky Fry.
They got a subway there now.
I'm not talking about the one you ride.
I'm talking about the one you eat.
Oh.
They got subway sandwiches now.
Huh.
That's how bad the rest of the food is there.
In fact, I didn't go there, but probably would have been a big improvement over at least one
of the meals I had.
It's pretty murky at Demarkies.
Don't go eat there.
Wow.
Fat.
WDQA Am.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
Hey, Neil.
Just wanted to say, man, you're doing a fabulous job filling in for George on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
That's right.
Okay, man.
George is the best.
George is the best.
It's always the first time in a day that car got a lot of online from Tuesday.
Yeah.
Just feeding back a line that I use on Tuesday.
That's all they can do.
They have nothing to say, so what they do is they should get back to us, whatever we just got
through sand.
What do you go to Amsterdam?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I just got back from Roman Amsterdam, which if you listen and pay to any attention, schmuck,
you would have known that.
When are you people going to get a life?
I have no life.
Forget about my life.
Forget about George's life.
Forget about Chris's life.
Oh, yeah.
Find your own life.
I have no life.
No, no.
Stop trying to exist bicariously through us.
If they had their own life, we wouldn't have as many lives as they could.
Tell me about Vegas anymore, Neil.
How many of that?
How'd you like to have a million dollars for each one of those girls we've had?
Oh, how come I don't want to go to Vegas anymore?
I don't want to.
I don't want to.
WDQ.
WDQ.
QAAM, hello.
Hello?
Yeah, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Someone's playing some Neil Diamond earlier.
Yeah.
Oh, Neil, don't do that.
I'll call the driver off in a canal if I hear the signal from the playing Neil Diamond.
That's terrible, Neil.
George, please.
George is playing it.
Oh, George was talking to him off.
Knock it off, George.
Yeah, thank you, Neil.
Yeah, okay.
Schmuck.
Somebody told him we were playing Neil Diamond before.
A little bird told him what's bird in his ear.
Hey, it was a wooden pecker.
7.74, I'm the way to 800.
And then we're going to go to 900.
And we're going to go to 1000 like how we deem.
We're going to go all over the world, man.
We're going to go to Amsterdam.
We're going to go to that damn square.
WDQ.
AAM, hello.
It's Thursday.
You missed it in the morning.
WDQ.
AAM, hello.
Hey, why do you want to eat up on the bread of Clint Foodie?
I didn't hear who he said, whatever it was, but I dumped it in.
It's just as well.
Oh, good plan.
Was it a good plan?
Yes.
I figured when it downed.
Right, you did the right thing.
Leave it out.
Yes.
5.670560, 0.560, 0.560, and the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.
On a great Thursday, man.
All these swill, all the slime from the bottom of the...
Barnacles on the bottom of the ship.
That's what we got left in South Florida this time of the year.
And they can't figure out why nobody goes to sporting events or anything else.
There's nobody there.
Look around you, okay?
Look around you.
Sniff the daffodils.
Smell the lilacs, okay?
We don't get it.
It must be because it's in a bad location.
Let's build a stadium somewhere where nobody wants to go, like the where the orange bull was.
Downtown Miami.
Isn't that where everybody wants to go?
Oh, yeah.
And how's the old Miami arena doing?
The Camilla's house is still there.
The pigeons love it.
WDQYM, hello.
Who did you shoot that, man?
WDQYM, hello.
QYM, hola.
Morning, you.
Yes, sir.
Anyway, I got a question you've been diabetic and all.
Those products were bars and stuff like that.
The pedal food that says that the only carrier net, amount of carbs.
Does that affect your sugar at all?
Yeah.
That's a bunch of crap.
That's the bigger of the lower its a scam, yeah.
Okay.
Net car.
Net car.
Hey, and closing the mom is right.
You guys are not the only station that the mom is the one who wants to speak to or be interviewed by.
So don't feel too bad, man.
Why?
Who else?
105.9 has been trying to interview some guys and they don't allow them to go on the show right all.
Why not?
I don't know.
Why not?
I don't know.
So how about that?
Thank you, everybody.
And they're complaining that nobody shows up at the ballpark and they won't put people on the unit promoted?
Well, too bad.
You mama.
You mama so socks and hell, how do you like that?
David Samsung.
Hey, David.
You're fairy.
780 on Chris's survey.
I think you're going to get over 800 by noon and then you got a shot.
All right.
You got a real honest a God shot and if we get a thousand, of course it's not a pull.
It's a survey.
Just a question like are you alive?
Like that.
You wish you were dead?
Things like that.
The biggest name.
The biggest town in the world.
The largest sport in your 5.50 QAM.
The fourth leader.
Another stunt rejoin.
You call this big market radio?
You depressed me.
You say I'm right and then you always second guess me.
Oh, what a letdown.
You call my hand before I even get my back down.
And when I'm always on the main.
You seem to get a bad way.
So when you depressed me.
So why am I in love with you?
In a kitchen.
Never thought three horsepower so sweet your vision.
When there's trouble.
I can count on you to leave me on the double.
When I see you, I fall in love.
So why am I covered with love?
Oh, what a letdown.
Why am I in love with you?
In a kitchen.
You say I'm right and then you always second guess me.
Oh, what a letdown.
When I see you, I fall in love.
So why am I covered with love?
Oh, what a letdown.
So why am I in love with you?
In a kitchen.
You depressed me.
You say I'm right and then you always second guess me.
Oh, what a letdown.
I leave and give you back to your car and call it even.
When I'm alone and I myself.
You say I'm right and then you always second guess me.
So why am I in love with you?
I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm over here.
1133 Christ, 790.
You're welcome.
I'm 560 W.
My person's going to make his 800 by noon.
You got 790 on there already.
790.
Oh, brother.
Oh my god.
That's bad news.
790 is bad.
560.
560.
560.
A week from yesterday the ratings come out.
The spring book.
You schnuck.
The spring book.
Take a deep breath.
Okay.
Let's see if we can break loose out of that point at nighttime.
What's the point even keeping the transmitter going on when nobody's listening?
Yeah.
How is it possible?
On a once great radio station to have a day part where your number is a point.
Oh, all the right and the middle of the daytime we actually had a one point.
Oh, they're not done.
They're not done.
They've still got other day parts they can get down to that level.
Oh, well they're working on it.
Oh.
WDQA and hello.
Hey Neil.
Yes sir.
Hey, you doing.
I want to thank you for the recommendation on that movie for the double notes you're dead.
That was good.
That was good.
No, I'm not doing that.
You know what?
I'm not going to be able to buy a sequel.
What do you think?
I say don't you think it needs a sequel?
No, that's what I thought.
That was my question for you.
I wasn't sure if that movie was talking about, but I don't know how that would work.
But maybe I kind of agree with that lady who was talking with that day that said that she thought it was fine.
I thought it ended fine.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey Neil.
Yeah.
The other thing was, uh, my dog had Hank in the studio the other day.
He didn't say anything on the air and I was wondering if they realized now the talent that they got rid of.
Because these other guys saw that the guy boy he's horrible.
I have an idea.
Hank in the studio with him.
I don't know if he had a Hank here.
Oh, I think this guy doesn't need it because he's listening to sound of his own voice.
He hung up and turned up the radio.
I think he was hanging out with Hank or something like that, you know, at a restaurant or something a couple days ago.
What?
He was the one guy who says he had a business to do with the mayor.
Yeah, no, he was talking about it on the air that he was hanging out with Hank, I believe.
Right.
Not that he was in studio, but that he went off to dinner with Hank and someone else.
Uh-huh.
And so he was talking about that on the air.
But I hate to reach a lot of dinners.
I'll tell you that.
A lot of dinners.
That was funny.
7.91 on your pool.
I'm keeping an eye on it.
I'm keeping my IP online.
I guess 7.95.
Well, turn it over.
Give it to Georgia.
You can buy lunch with it.
Ooh.
7.95.
You get a lot of bacon from howies.
That's right.
Probably get a couple of pies maybe from Tony, who there is.
What's your cause?
Toys.
Brad and toys.
I mean, when you stop and think about all the good, you know, the good times and the people bringing in food and being friendly and, you know, reaching out and touching the community and being involved.
And by the way, we're doing such a great job now that today is Thursday.
Probably we got some people out there wondering how come Neil hasn't said anything about the restaurant deal coming up at noon?
Because there isn't one.
Because there isn't one.
We finally sold out by the way in Japan go from last week.
Took a little while, but because we could only do one for a customer.
And because it's that valid days time in the year, you know.
But we sold them out.
We don't have one.
This week.
And there's a good chance we won't have one next week either.
Correct.
Is when I'm hearing through the rape fire.
And how is that thing coming that they were all breathless about that we were going to get all these emails?
Not emails, the text messages from the audience.
Remember that?
Yep.
Like they have over a tower they've been doing that.
They got 80 trillion text messages the first five minutes or something like that.
Remember?
They have breathless stories.
And you guys, we're going to get you in touch with the audience.
They're going to be able to text message you.
And you're going to be able to respond and read them in the yuck and listen that.
Well, guess what?
Did they ever sell it?
No.
Is it happening?
No.
Did we hear any follow through on it?
No.
And that's because we got great salespeople, great management people.
Of course, that goes without saying.
But great salespeople like what's the guy's name? Andy?
Andrew.
Andrew.
Andrew.
Who's too stupid to even understand that you're not going to stop the show so that you can talk to him?
To just sit there patiently for five minutes and wait until you go into a break.
And then that's the time to come in and ask you some stupid question.
About when you do a spot for a pervenoculars that you have to pee in before you can see in there?
What?
All right, that's coming next week out there in India.
They call it a bigger deal.
It was, then you see life through a hose-colored glasses.
They call it abvervision.
Right.
WQA Am, hello.
Hello.
Is it Neil?
Yeah.
Neil is lost.
I'm before.
What?

The Martin's.
How are you?
OK, how are you?
Good.
Is this the bubble-build?
My Tommy D'Alphins ticket office?
What do you want, sir?
Are you going to a material or not?
I'm sorry.
I said you haven't a material or not.
No, I'm not what you're talking to, is it?
We must have lines crossed.
Yeah, you got your lying cross, all right. You got you got a cross
You got your foot up your ass is what you got well, I think you're actually I'm not sure who you are
But you're absolutely extremely rude. The right I'm dialing 305
5.670
Right and this is WQAM radio as if you have no way of knowing that is that the same number?
I wouldn't mean you would have no way of knowing that where are you? Where are you calling from?
I'm calling from Canada. I'm calling long distance calling from Canada
Where are boats?
We're meeting whereabouts in Branford. Branford, Ontario?
Yes. You wouldn't know Branford from Ashuahman from Medicine Hat.
What the hell you talk? What's my guy here?
How long you want to keep this up?
Well, first of all, here's my question. Am I calling the Miami Dolphins ticket office?
No, you absolutely are not. Let me say it again. What I just get to tell you. It's WQAM radio in Miami.
Well, it's too bad for you. Where did you get this number from?
From the Dolphins website. From the Dolphins website.
Yep.
Anyway, what is it you want? Do you want Dolphins tickets? Do you want to see the bills game December 7th?
I want to get Dolphins tickets. I'll just make sure I'll go back.
Do you want to get Dolphins tickets for what?
For the Buffalo game in October 26th.
So, I think what's happened here is your phone number shows up on their website.
No, what it is is you're looking at the advertisement for the Dolphins Tonight program.
Oh, okay. Yeah.
And that show blows, by the way. So we're showing a history of radio.
That's okay. So...
Why do you want to see the Dolphins? They won one game last season. Why do you want to see that?
That's okay because I have a place in Florida and I'm bringing my family to all my sons down here.
Oh my god. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. You have a place in Florida.
Okay.
Is it in the terrible?
Yeah. You're probably a Leafs fan too, no doubt.
No, no. I'm not actually I'm a fan.
Well, why not? You're a what?
Who'd help want to be a Leafs fan?
I've been a Leafs fan for 50 years, man.
Well, that's your sick.
That's right. And that's the reason for it. That's correct.
That's absolutely correct.
You wouldn't...
You wouldn't know Frank Mahabali from the foster here.
You got to separate your brain from your heart.
Yeah, oh yeah.
Yeah. Irfan, somewhere.
Yeah, wow. Right.
Yeah, Christ, even Christ, you're right.
Yeah, Johnny Bowers coming back this year.
Now we're going to be okay.
Get named the best talent here for this new project.
4.560 QAM.
The fourth leader.
You.
Yeah.
Push in the party for Hagger.
Push in the party for Hagger.
Push in the party for Hagger.
Push in the party for Hagger.
Jamie said, lay off the bed, hangin'.
He brought investigation to women.
They would get into clothes through the towel.
Headed body, towel and catches for a bother to attend.
When you were a mom.
Push in the party for Hagger.
Push in the party for Hagger.
Push in the party for Hagger.
Push in the party for Hagger.
If they don't insist on this work for three times.
Three thousand lives will never be a bench.
Push your brain wash, fucking.
Also, back to the bed.
You're going to back in off a cushion.
Push in the party for Hagger.
Push in the party for Hagger.
Push in the party for Hagger.
Push in the party for Hagger.
They lay off the bed.
Push in the party for Hagger.
Push in the party for Hagger.
Push in the party for Hagger.
Okay, twelve minutes to go.
It's time to go to the bathroom.
And of course to prove it, I've always said,
if you take fifty billion calls, you'll get one good one.
That was great.
I was sensational.
I knew he was Canadian because he had that quaggle,
but you're starting to pick up.
I'm starting to pick up.
Just touch.
What are you talking about?
Yeah.
And look at that phone now, man.
And now they've all given up after that call.
They can't top it.
Can't top it.
Can you top this with Arlene Francis and Bennett Sirf?
Radio show before you were born.
And George S. Kaufman.
I wonder if George S. Kaufman was related to Joyce Kaufman,
who's not Jewish by the way.
She's a Haitian or something like that?
Joyce Kaufman?
Right.
You're kidding.
Let me say it again.
I'm not kidding.
Is it everybody named Kaufman or Kaufman is Jewish?
First of all, yes.
Second of all, I think you're wrong.
All right.
You're full of crap.
Okay.
If I am, I'll eat a cough cup.
Hey, let me tell you right now, Mama Sita is getting her hair done today.
She's ruined.
And so I'm not going to, I'm going to see them.
Do they do it?
I'm going to see Papa today because he's got, I knew that was coming.
Let's see.
WFTL's Joyce Kaufman.
Let me take a look.
Sixteen years, South Florida rated for 60 years of the interruption.
Where is the thing?
American of Puerto Rican, Italian, Austrian, Hungarian.
Right.
There you go.
Puerto Rican, that's Jewish.
She's not Jewish.
Joyce Kaufman says you're going to be telling me that Jaime Rubinovich is Jewish.
Right.
Or you just got Jews in all those places.
You just let's go.
Well, guess what?
We're in places under your bed in a broom closet.
Yeah.
It does, I believe her.
Probably like you.
If God said it, that settles it.
What?
What does that mean?
I don't know, that's on her biography.
Why do I care?
All I ask is, is she Jewish and is she so she's Puerto Rican?
That's why George doesn't like her.
What?
There's two groups of people George can't stand.
It's Puerto Ricans and Mexicans.
Not necessarily in that or Gypsies, get it right.
Or Gypsies.
I only have a problem with Gypsies.
The Gypsies cried.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Now, who do you like better?
Lou Christie or Neil Diamond?
No.
No contest.
Don't make me choose.
Don't make me choose.
WDQ, who am I?
Hello.
WDQ, who am I?
Neil, please.
Speaking.
Neil.
Yeah.
How do you need to do kegel exercises so you don't poop in your pants?
No, it's just a Fetty Pat guy.
I've heard from him a lot of times.
Was it really?
Oh yeah.
Oh no.
He likes the kegels.
Oh well, I don't even know what that is.
I know what it is.
Oh, look, Christie, let's hear it.
The Gypsy cried.
Twenty-one?
And the show.
Two faces and a half.
Oh, shoot.
Okay.
Shoot.
Shoot.
I don't have that.
Well, I'll be damned.
Q.A.M. Hello.
Somebody Q.A.M. Hello.
Thank you.
Neil.
Yes.
Don't fear me, Gypsy Pat.
I don't want to hear tears.
Do you understand one word?
Not one.
No, not one word.
It was very...
A tickle, though, he was in hysterics when he got finished.
Maybe his boyfriend's finger was tickling his...
Right.
...from the inside, of course.
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty, pound, five, sixty,
and a Verizon singular wireless line.
You're not exactly kicking ass anymore on your pool.
I mean, you got past the 800 hump, but it's only 816.
It's only 818, like I said.
Well, you need to get with it, man.
You're not going to make that thousand.
If we don't make a thousand on a survey, then that means we're done.
I will have tomorrow.
Yeah, I'm not coming back to Tuesday if we don't get a thousand.
We had a good show Tuesday in Spive of the Factory, which was out sick.
I should call it more often.
Chris was saying because of the fact that you were...
That's right, that's what he said.
Oh, yeah, totally said that.
No, there was Zach that said that.
I think Zach is looking for your job.
Hey.
It's ready here.
WDQA, I'm Hello.
Hi, Danba.
In fact, I can't imagine.
I can just see you switching jobs with Zach.
You working on the Joe Rochow and Zach working on here.
I'll practice my Zach voice.
To look over his back and get with the sports stuff, get with the Marlins, the Marlins.
Gotta get up and go up and get down.
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta move up and out down.
Gotta, gotta, gotta move up and out down.
That's right.
Now you're talking.
WDQA, I am Hello.
Zach, Zach.
QA, I am Hello.
Hi, I'm Leo.
Yes.
July 30th, the flip-not concert.
I'm going there.
To what?
The flip-not concert.
Yeah.
You ever heard of flip-not?
No.
They're pretty awesome.
I heard of what?
I heard of what?
I heard of what?
Well, July 30th, what's on the...
Nobody cares.
All right.
See it to Marlin game.
That's our poll question on the air today.
How come nobody can be asked it on Tuesday and we had about three responses?
Maybe, of course.
If we gave you a Salami sandwich and tickets to Marlin game, where'd you go?
I would go.
Sounds good to me.
What?
I would go.
What are you doing in there?
What do you mean?
They just fired George.
What are you doing?
I'm the executive producer of the show now.
What are you doing in there?
I thought that's what you just requested.
They're just getting the password of my computer.
Is he surfing my porn right now?
Yeah, I'm going through all the door just stuff right now.
What's that?
May I get that out of here?
I don't like that.
No, he's still...
Because I notice he's not on again tomorrow.
They got that horrible.
I mean, Bo camper and Danny Cannell talk about the blind leading the blind.
Three hours in morning drive.
They're going to put that on here.
These people are insane.
Whose idea was that?
Zack's.
Not Zack's.
Zack.
I just get to know another Zack attack.
No, I got told that they were going to be on and we're doing a Dolphin's training camp show tomorrow.
We're going to be previewing all the stuff, wonderful stuff going on Dolphin's campus weekend.
And for the next month.
I think that Brady Quinn's got a yeast infection.
What did I tell you when I'm in the room?
You're not allowed to.
That's my second time.
You're trying to get ready.
You're trying to get ready.
I said it.
To drive you away.
Drive your fan ass out of there.
As producer of your show now.
You're producing my show, your ass.
How'd you get there?
Let me ask you a question.
How are you?
How are you?
Come on, you're not going to sing?
What?
You never go home or not.
Are you like Robert Greeper now?
Are you like...
Are you the new Robert Greeper?
Are you part of the woodwork?
No, during your show just in case George needs to leave the room.
Now I'm here.
So we could tag me and we're like tagging partners.
So I thought he had to go to the bathroom.
What did I tell you?
He's looking for your job, George.
Sorry.
Everybody is.
They don't know.
They don't know that I have to pay to work here.
Maybe Roger...
Maybe Roger Fagbelin will show up again.
Like a stripper now.
I have to set out the good work.
He's got a lot of life out of that way.
Do we know anything about him?
He's got a lot of life out of that.
Hey, Hanson.
Now, why couldn't he have died in Rineri's still been alive?
That's just the way it is.
God works mysterious ways.
Yeah, that's right.
That proves there's no God right there.
If there was a God,
Mike Wineri would still be alive.
And Roger Magdalen would be dead.
Dead.
Sleep with the fishes, man.
Yeah, he was after your job, big time.
I'm not that that's a secret.
No.
In fact, he probably was the most blatant person ever.
Right.
Like going after another person.
Right.
You would backstab you in the front.
Right. That's right.
Well, at least that's something.
At least that's honest.
Well, I'm Johnny Gaubelle, who's phony as hell,
and comes along.
Oh, hey, George.
How you doing?
And then behind your back is probably ripping you an ass.
I'm sure.
It sends me a message about what a great job you're doing on my days off,
my off days during the summer schedule.
Hey, most of your days are off days these days.
That's for damn sure, especially when I hear from him.
The good news is, though, I don't have to be, you know, hanging around here waiting for a visit.
It's usually about a Mexican time, a half hour late.
I can hop in my car to a clock and go right to it by.
Give me a couple of slices of pizza and pull my butt back down.
Clarge my brains out.
And now that I know that paycheck is actually in the bank,
I can blow the whole thing this afternoon.
And have a damn good time doing it, too.
How do you like that?
Yeah.
Did we lose the connection or what?
No, no, right here.
Mama Sita's got to get her hair done.
Uh-huh.
She's a big shot now.
I don't understand.
I understand.
She's a big city slicker.
Oh, I know.
Moving on up.
To the worst side.
Let me tell you right now about, I can't do this spot because I can't speak.
I'm doing Zack talk now.
If you want to talk like Zack, you've got to sound like your vocal cords have been snipped.
Oh, my God, I'm getting down.
Yeah.
I was on my way to bed.
Listen to me, Quid.
Whenever I shave my balls, I listen to the meal Rogers 12-1 hours.
Oh, right.
You're fair.
Oh, I know.
Oh, I know.
Oh, you can tell your fans.
You don't like their demands.
If they have some requests, you'll just say no.
And then tell Mama Kent to tell the management.
You want nobody missing with your show.
Go round from ten to two.
And when your shift is through, tell George you can relax and smoke some weed.
And then go tell Joe Bell that he can go to hell.
He even almost makes you miss Gregory.
Absolutely.
But don't play a part.
The sound of a fart.
I don't think Joyce would understand.
Because if you play a part.
The sound of a fart.
You'll be in trouble with the beastly clam.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Don't do it.
Don't play a part.
12.3.5.60 WQM.
And of course we all know that's a zipper sound.
Right.
Nobody in the history of mankind ever heard a fart that sounded like that.
That's corduroy.
That's my corduroy pantaloonies.
I'm not wearing them today.
But I might.
Now that I'm going to woodbine, I might just slap those babies on here in a few minutes.
The brown corduroy.
And the legs every step you take is like.
That's me walking to the tea room at woodbine.
Like that.
838 tallies on our survey today on our pool.
Chris is a push for a thousand.
Come on, push a little bit more, man.
Come on, people.
Hurry up, let's go.
We need that thousand to make no happy.
Why don't you make me happy?
It's your poem, mister.
You're the poem, mister.
What the hell do I give a crap about it?
You know you love it.
Yeah, I love it all right, but not the pool, not that pool.
Maybe Brady Quinn's pool.
Huh?
Well, I think it's evidently had a lot of activity.
I think a lot of guys have been involved in his pool activity.
At least, what was that all about?
And now maybe that's why he got drafted what?
Like, 199, 588.
20 something, yeah.
So everybody passed him up.
He was sitting there with that phony girlfriend of his, with that beard.
Remember that day?
Yep.
And every time somebody had life at the doffins, man.
They don't want a gate.
I think that's what the fish need, man.
A turn them around as a good gate quarterback.
Maybe they can bring back Sonny Jürgensen.
Was it Sonny Jürgensen or Billy Kilmer?
One of them was a gate.
I forget which one.
Old Redskin.
Oh, you're crazy, Neil.
There's no gate.
Players in the NFL.
That's right.
56670560, 0.560 on the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.
And you notice that the Joe Rose and the Mad Dog, all the X-Jocks, they won't talk about such things.
Because what goes on in the locker room stays in the locker room, in their hands of W.A.M. Hello.
Yes, sir.
Do you smoke weed?
Hmm?
Do you smoke weed?
Yes.
You're writing a book?
Yes.
Yeah, go smoke your boyfriend, okay?
56670560, 0.560 on the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.
W.A.M. Hello.
See?
Yes, sir.
Oh, yeah, you're talking about a lot of time to talk about early TV games, and stuff.
And I was just kind of wondering if you ever remember to take college or college or be the climatist?
Oh, my God.
You have to be a hundred years older, remember that?
Yes, I do.
Yeah, well, yeah.
The only one that's been like maybe one year, and then there was like a...
Oh, my God, for that.
And then there was like, say, K, do you want to leave a band?
Where he had, like, he'd come up there.
Well, when are you going to get to the Rudy Valley stuff?
Yeah, Rudy Valley is there.
I just thought you liked him there.
Okay.
Thank you.
God, talk about coma inducing, talk about boring.
He's more boring than there will be blood.
And then, you know, something that's the ultimate slap in the push.
When somebody says you or this or that is more boring than there will be blood.
Yeah.
That's the ultimate slap in the push.
How come this whole light moving, man?
838 is that it?
You've done?
Is that all our whole audience?
It could be 840.
Yeah.
W2A and hello.
You're going to like him, aren't we?
W2A and hello.
I'm sick.
Yeah, no kidding.
QA and hello.
The meal Roger's, meal Roger's, I love you.
Yeah.
WQA and hello.
So the guy with a fanny pack was the one that called before that.
Yeah, the new working voice that he's got.
That was his real voice.
Yeah.
No.
That was him doing stick.
Remember what?
Remember, he was a security guard at the immaculate.
Back when they first opened it up and he was carrying a piece.
That's why he used to rely on it.
You naturally give it to the same man who's currently who he can!
Or the 2008 map so you don't get a lot of comments about it when he would be two weeks
Now do you think he was for real to think he really thought he was calling the dolphins to order tickets?
If you go to the dolphins homepage, there's a large banner for dolphins tonight on the radio and it has the
Steve Collins numbers. Yep. So it's right on the front of it. Well so what is that?
I have to do with ordering dolphin tickets. We basically now since that banner's been up there,
we probably get 10 to 20 calls a day for dolphins tickets.
Between our show and the other shows.
What kind of morons on dolphin tickets? What kind of a...
And this guy's telling me that I'm an idiot because I'm a Leafs fan?
At least they've won a game sometime in the last century.
I've been following it for passage two nights. There's a chance for blinds tonight!
Jason Blake, what a stiff. What a stiff. How you like that?
Now that was nice and timely. Do you see that? How they did that for me right on cue?
Because I've been Leafs fan for years. Nice going there Joe.
844. There's that Maddie Cohen. There's that what's his name? Rob Marciano, I'm CNN.
That all the queens think is so hot. Oh he's so hot.
Sure. What do you say? WDQA and hello.
How would you like to have the money that they spend on make up on television?
I just want the money to pay for it. He would begin to imagine. WDQA and hello.
Hey I'm talking about the mollus tickets on a website.
Yeah right. Come up, come up with something original location mark.
Is this Kim Boca? Yeah this is Danny Cannell.
Kim Boca. Good bye. Nice try.
This moron wants tickets says the professor.
We got any tickets you can send him instead. We got no restaurants certificate for this week because we got no restaurant.
Yeah, give them a parking ticket.
Yeah why don't you go to his car away? He's getting used to that.
How would you like that? You move into your first apartment with your girlfriend and the very first weekend that you spend.
Maybe the first day you get up in the morning you go outside and your cars are both gone because they've been towed away because you were too stupid
but the deep chaos on the windows. Live and learn.
Yeah that's right. You should know when you live with a bunch of relentless bastards that if you don't dot all the eyes and cross all the teeth
they're going to come and make your life miserable okay.
And this group all wants marlins tickets for the marlins?
I don't have any marlins tickets.
Although this year I will be getting dolphin tickets. This will be my last year I get any perks.
That was part of the new deal by the way.
Whatever and this ties right in with the thing with no free food you know.
Whatever perks I had in my previous contract.
This miserable heartless bastard not only did you cut my salary in half but the marlins tickets on no more.
The dolphin tickets and all that. Whatever you had that kind of like was a little frosting on the cake.
No you can't have it. We don't want to give it to you. We don't want them.
That's the kind of bastard you're working for.
Text message?
That's a text message from the professor he wants to dolphin tickets.
Don't worry you've got them. Crystal want them.
And even if he did want them they're already spoken for it for my good close personal friend.
Okay. Who's got issues in life? His car got towed away.
Which everyone is driving this week.
There's one thing I can't stand that somebody can make up their mind.
Buy a nice car like my vet.
Got 5,000 miles on it 2004.
Older than Mathieu's lot.
What kind of a I mean like you know me I used to trade my vet in every year am I right?
Yep.
It would be automatic people from loop back row would just drive up the new one and just say hey here's a new vet.
You know sign on a dotted line and I would.
I'm going to hop in that baby at two o'clock and I'm going to fly to woodbine and lose my ass and have a great time doing it.
I'm going to I'm going to pour the hundreds in there while people are starving while George and Chris can't even get a free meal in there because our general manager is a bastard from a blanket from a basket.
That's what you ought to do. You ought to go to his office as soon as he comes in and say faster but a basket.
And I bet you that's where we'd like to see him too in a basket.
Or maybe something that rhymes with basket like casket.
Get some. Get named the best out.
Get into the logic.
4.2560 QAM.
And then 4th leader.
4th leader.
4th leader.
4th leader.
4th leader.
4th leader.
4th leader.
I don't go in there.
You hear my stomach?
I'm going to go in.
I don't know that one.
I don't know.
People heading home from work late one night when they fall behind in the fast food line.
They pulled in and gave their order to the girl and the next thing you know they started to hurt.
And I go out.
This stomach started to blow.
And I go out.
But burning inside their throat.
It had a smell.
That's when they started to blow.
Not feeling well.
From the beanberry toe.
It floats up in the curse of the case of the art.
It's causing all this diarrhea.
But non-levels they are going to die.
They just have at case of ecolon from I go out.
And I go out.
I burn inside their throat.
It had a smell.
That's when they started to blow.
Not feeling well.
From the beanberry toe.
It floats up in the curse of the case of the art.
You might not have made that super.
Next time you pass the signs they know.
Even though it's grilled.
So it's good to go.
Lots of people got sick and wish that they underdone.
So they could hunt down the people who think outside the bun.
The pain from the crans they felt deep in their gut.
So next time they'll just go to be for a heart.
Not not going out.
That's when they started to blow.
From the beanberry toe.
From the beanberry toe.
That's pretty quiz model.
Take inside the bun.
From I teen is 560 W.2.
Happy a Thursday to a George will be back tomorrow.
Oh boy.
I mean you'll be back.
I mean you're there now.
We'll be back when the show tomorrow.
And Monday.
And then the next Wednesday you got the numbers coming out.
The book.
The spring book.
I'm going to leave that in your capable hand.
And if the numbers are bad it will be your fault of course.
Of course.
560 560.
Just like Greg we used to say.
You know you'd be number one in the summertime.
He'd be running right.
Oh that George is killing the station in the summer zone.
Torpedoed the ratings.
Is that what it was saying?
Yes.
Torpedoed the station.
Right.
And those two ratings points ahead of whoever was number two in the market.
No mention double the nearest competitor here on this station.
But hey.
Could never do enough for these batches.
Nope.
That's why we're not getting that's why I've got all those perks going.
No more Marlon tickets.
No more Dolphin tickets.
No more Panther tickets.
No more anything.
No more speeding tickets.
And that's because Jolly Jobelle.
He's probably hopping it up for himself.
You know.
Fat ass like him.
WQA in Hello.
Roger Maglon ran off with his back stepping boyfriend Adam Kushner.
What a joke that is.
Who the hell was that?
That was Al Rogers.
Oh.
What does it say?
I don't know.
The stalker.
Somebody that knows the old IOD crew obviously.
We were somebody who's a radio stalker right.
Used to hang out in stalking the goddess.
WQA M Hello.
QA M Hello.
WQA M.
Hey, Neil.
I was just wondering what what are you doing this weekend.
If you take a trip about two hours south of you,
a swigo in New York having their famous.
I wouldn't go to a swigo in New York if you paid me by the mile.
Come on, man.
What's wrong with a swigo in New York?
Are you some kind of a moron or what?
Of course. I'm listening to your show.
That's what I'd speak for itself.
I'll see you in a good time.
I'm going to New York baby. I'll see you at Buffalo Raceway.
Oh, man. You got it.
See you.
Schmuck.
Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
I'm going to go upstate New York and sniff the lilacs.
Of course, the lilacs are already out of season.
I guess. But nevertheless, I bet there's some fell on the ground at Cobb's Hill.
I'm going to go to the rant Eastman Park.
Are there people from Rochester that keep raving about how great it was there?
What was so great about it?
What was good about it?
Hicky Freeman, Eastman Kodak, Red Wing Stadium, Tom Decker.
What was so good about Rochester?
Can you tell me Joe Kronin?
Huh?
I can't tell you.
I've never been there.
Any meat?
More to this bomb?
Who is the guy who used to do this sports you on WHAM?
Bob does something.
I used to win hockey tickets for you hockey.
I told you that.
Bob Walker.
To the Amhersts.
WDQAM, hello.
That was Marvin Robyn calling.
And this is Steve Ziegler, Mitches O'Wean.
Isn't that sad?
Where are all those people now?
I can't figure it out because now Chief Channel owns all the stations.
And Koch doesn't have any more AM stations.
So they don't work for Disney.
They all have to be Chief Channel.
Maybe they're over there sitting in Ken Charles' lab.
That A-hole.
Neal listens to us all morning long because he doesn't do short prep anymore.
So he's got to get his material from us right.
Oh yeah.
And the sad part of it is this is a guy who thinks he knows something about his business.
In fact, I think if he and Jolly Jorbelly eloped,
it would be a marriage made in Purgatory.
We'd be perfect.
Ken Charles.
And in fact, everyone, what's his name?
We're still at Cross the street.
What's his name?
That beat up his girlfriend.
Across the street.
The Waxi.
Joel Feinberg.
Joel Feinberg, right.
Well, I had a brain fart there.
I could have his name.
When he was there, him and Joel Bell had this
pain contest going on all the time, you know.
Back and forth and ripping each other in ass and sending each other in ass to
like a couple of children in the sandbox.
At least Joel knew enough to get out.
Liberty QA M, hello.
Uh, Neal?
Yes.
Three trees.
I like trees.
Three.
WQA M, hello.
QA M, oh, I...
George is my friend.
George is my friend.
George is my friend.
My friends don't call me on the air.
George is my friend.
Don't you just love the way he says it?
You're my friend.
There's nothing alive on the face of the earth that will want to be friend that.
Whatever it is.
And I'm pleased to say that I actually had the opportunity to see it with my own five eyes to
put my...
yellow eyes to it.
To spy it.
And to see what a pathetic retard we're dealing with.
And of course, you know, we're the babysitters.
You don't realize that.
They've turned his problems and his life over to us for four hours a day.
That fine, upstanding family.
Do we know what the last name is in that family?
No, I don't.
Well, why not?
I bet you can get Jolly Joel.
That's how he put his propaganda here.
I'm addicted to work on it.
And one thing about it, you've got to admit, Jolly Joel has done a hell of a job with these chronic callers since he's been here two and a half years.
He has done one hell of a job.
And I take back what I said before about him not lifting a finger to us.
He lifts a finger to us every day.
In fact, maybe two of them.
One on each hand.
WDQA and hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Why is Neil and Bremen being such a smuck?
He's not.
He's doing the right thing.
No, he's not.
Well, Gable, when he was owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, he didn't have a problem with public police finance statements back then.
And he sure did a nice job helping Baltimore get their public police finance statements.
Well, he's trying to protect the people from South Florida for making the same mistake they made eight million times.
That's what he's trying to do.
He's trying to get back to Jeffrey Luria for not bringing them on as a partner.
Good for him.
Good for him.
I'm all for him, man.
Great.
Norman Bremen is God.
He's a smuck.
And school the Marlins.
The Marlins.
He's a smuck.
You okay?
I'll give you a busy.
School everybody.
The biggest name.
The best talent.
He's here for the New York Times.
He's working for 5.60 QAM.
The sports leader.
The children.
The boys are the boys.
The boys are the boys.
The boys are the boys.
The boys are the boys.
The boys are the boys.
The boys are the boys.
The guys are the boys.
The boys are the boys.
I don't know how to tell you to talk about me that way.
I don't give a crap like that very best to say.
It's me what the school thinks and I said, what?
I don't know.
I'll have you know.
I know what I'm talking about.
Every morning at the condo I can get elevated down.
And on my way to the car when I pull my clothing basket out.
I get a free condo.
The boys are back and pow.
The boys are back and pow.
The boys are back and pow.
They're the boys are back and pow.
The boys are back and pow.
They're the boys, boys, boys.
The boys are back and pow.
I said the boys are back and pow.
Why you?
I'm like God alone!
You sport, old people.
I know everything that's going on in that news.
Why I even know all the new my job rules.
I've hit to the jive that he only used to be the living.
You guys are going back tonight.
It's the better show when I take this place.
I know I ain't always play with me.
But when they drop my voice will change.
A little smoothie to the bird.
I'm gonna play with it to the bird.
I'm gonna play with it to the bird.
I'm gonna play with it to the bird.
I'm gonna play with it to the bird.
I'm gonna play with it to the bird.
I'm gonna play with it to the bird.
Crap 32 at 560 W.K.M. Mr. Chris you better get with it.
Man your pool of abilities are dwindling.
You don't get 864 you need about 920 by the top of the yard.
We'll do it.
Have a shot at a thousand today.
Don't get the thousand man.
I'm not coming back tomorrow.
Uh oh.
What if we do get a thousand?
I'm still not coming back tomorrow.
What if I could sound or break into the clouds.
It was kind of a murky morning.
Let's see what the temperature is in downtown Toronto.
Let's see what it looks like.
You ready?
23 that's 73 degrees.
Perfect.
Oh.
That's nice.
Yeah.
Partly sunny and 73.
Nice little breeze out there.
Breeze between your knees.
Had a call from Branford, Ontario already.
How's that going A?
And let me tell you something.
I've told you this before that you all say it on here.
My space is a waste.
Okay.
Other than a couple of friends I made on there when we had to go with that private page now to do that.
But other than that the rest of it is just kaka the show page.
I don't hear from anybody anymore on there.
I can go days at a time and there's nobody on there.
What about you?
You're getting all those bimbos on there probably.
Why do you say things like that?
Because I feel anxious.
Because that's what you use it for.
I have a nice people that I've met on there that I interact with.
That you interact with?
Sure.
And what does that mean?
It's like messages back and forth.
You know, like that.
I used to do that.
And I was pretty proud of the fact that I answered like 95% of every you know every message I get from everyone of those losers.
I mean, great people.
I'd answer them.
And they're one by one they just vanish.
It's like a novelty that the crap.
It's a novelty.
And once the novelty wears off, once they're gone.
They're gone.
How many QAAM?
Hello.
I have none.
How many QAAM?
Hello.
Yes.
Yeah, I'm having lunch.
You know, can you call me back?
Oh, yeah.
I'll call you later.
Okay.
What time?
Yeah, a public house.
Okay.
5.6705.60.
And they've rising singular wireless line.
We got the jerk show coming up at two o'clock in spite of tremendous public outcry.
WDQAAM, hello.
Yes, sir.
This is a go-on for your lesson.
WDQAAM, hello.
Yeah, I mean, I did.
Hello.
Yes.
What's QAAM?
What did I just say when I answered the phone?
I said WDQAAM.
Oh, hey, deal with the top.
No, but what is that?
Hey, I've been wondering.
Wait a minute, deal.
Why does that happen all the time?
I say WQAAM, they'll say, is this QAAM?
I'm going to sell for you.
Yeah, let's do it.
Yeah.
Check this out.
I was watching a show just now in the history channel.
They were talking about hurricane,
they'll go over warming all that.
If there's a possibility, we could get these super-mercans to get up to like 500 miles
an hour.
What do you think about that?
And?
Pretty awesome, huh?
Yeah, I'll be dead for you.
Stay by five to South Florida.
I'll be dead for you, so I'm not worried about it.
Don't be dead by that.
And I won't be dead.
All right, yeah.
Okay, good luck to you, sir.
Good luck to you.
Get down into basement and close the hatch.
Of course, there are no basements in Florida.
That's one of the bad things a little bit in Florida.
There's no basement.
You're going to have an attic.
Right.
Cross-paces.
Are there cross-paces?
Yeah.
Like in vacancy, like in the motel, there was that cross-space.
You didn't think there was a good movie?
I mean, it was fine.
It was cheesy.
I remember how I came up.
I'm a hard ass.
I've called very few movies, Good.
So in other words, it wasn't as good as saying, there will be blood.
Few movies are.
That good.
WQIM, hello.
This QAM?
Hello?
Another idiot.
Nail.
Yeah.
What's up?
What do you got?
You ever heard of a driver, a pomp and a heart and a track called Chad Stanton?
Cold.
What?
Chad Stanton.
Chad's?
Yeah.
Chad's my ass.
WQIM, hello.
I'm hiding in the back.
QAM, hello.
I'm glad I got a pomp.
I'll tell you what it was.
QAM.
No deal.
Yeah.
Hey man, you sound like you have something in your mouth, man.
Mm-hmm.
Take it out, man.
There you go.
There you go.
Just toss it right over to you.
Open wide and grab it.
873 on a survey.
Just a survey for Kronow a lot.
I mean, how come we don't have like 50,000 tallies on there?
Sally.
Summer.
Are you in denial, is that it?
You don't realize that Joe Bell has blown off the end of it.
When you look at the CUM that we have now when these trends come out,
and you look at the pathetic CUM that we have left on the internet,
it's like, it's an embarrassment.
And we got a 0.0 at night.
The transmitter is pumping out energy, man.
We're spending money with FBNL, Florida Plunder, but Lou,
and we got a 0.0 at night with a DA that they brought in from Kansas City.
You've got canned out there and couldn't get another job.
And they brought him in here.
It's like when they brought the fabulous sports bay
on it, announced to everybody she had no idea about the South Florida teams.
And would everybody please call in and tell us something about it.
That's the kind of expert you want to put on the air.
Why? Why gotta be so mean at the DA?
Comparing him with her.
I'm not comparing him with her.
I'm just saying it's like the same thing that they do all the time.
They put people on the air who don't know the market,
who are supposed to be talking about, like when he was out there talking about
the Marlon fans the other day, there are no Marlon fans.
You could put them in a phone booth in a headroom for the Chinese Army leftover
for a bunch of Chinese money.
Wait till you hear this.
This is gonna make your blood curdle.
George, okay.
All waiting for it.
One of John McCain's most prominent supporters on Tuesday praised an evangelical leader
whom the Republican presidential candidate repudiated after stringing controversial
marks were made public.
Connecticut Senator the anxious Jew Lieberman,
an independent who frequent the campaigns with the king, in other words, who's joined it as hip.
said Pastor John Haguey's support for Israel outweighed the remarks that led
McCain to reject his endorsement.
Another Israel firster, another from Zionist allunantic like Wolf Blitzkrieg, a maniac.
Lieberman said he had been urged not to speak to Haguey's group Christians United for Israel.
The bond that I feel with Pastor Haguey and each and every one of you is much stronger than that
and so I'm proud to stand with you tonight.
Lieberman told several thousand members of the group which urged US support for Israel
right or wrong, Israel first.
I don't agree with everything Pastor Haguey's done and said but there's so much more important than that we do agree on.
Lieberman said that far-bicin.
Haguey, who heads the 19,000-member cornerstone church in San Antonio, Texas,
was criticized for calling the Catholic Church the Great Horror.
And saying that God punished New Orleans with her campaign Katrina for staging a gay rights campaign
he has since apologized to Catholics but not to fags.
And you're like that, Jewelieberman hopping in bed with Pastor Haguey.
If he's good for Israel, he's good for me, it's good enough for me, said the far-bicin Jewelieberman.
Cocks a hoist, baby, you idiot, you loser.
You fairy.
God, you can't complain about his personality because he doesn't have a correct.
Now we're getting close to 900 on that survey so we can make that thousand at 10 o'clock at 2 o'clock.
8.79.
Yep.
That all you got?
See, pretty weak.
The best talent is the largest sport in just 5.60 QAM.
The fourth leader.
And now live from Rijel 7.
It's the new Roger Show.
I like the keys of the song Morgan Riding.
The key of time I feel very grand pises.
Now when he guides the white dogs in off key, this is why they learn to carry on key.
Yeah.
I love the way that I've been ended.
The bitch haven't been the same since, sir.
Go cut, buy and die.
I know.
Yeah, I heard that was some party crack read through.
Yeah.
The thing I didn't go much at the end, she.
Of course, it's not easy flying back there from Rijel 7.
I know.
Thank God.
I'm here.
It's all over for you, poor Schlefsch, Darkerner.
President, no, well.
Well, if you're lucky, that crack head is the last bush to rig an election.
Who's on this line?
That would be good.
Mr. Rogers?
Speaking.
I wasn't the public's a galactica today, sir.
And let me tell you, the clip out coupons in Thursday's paper are the shipping.
I discovered to myself.
No, this is yours.
Yes, I know.
The first one was not too for 99 cents on the contrary.
Got them off.
Two break stones for 99 cents each.
Now, I don't know about you.
That's right.
They tried to pedal me two break stones for the price of two break stones, cottage cheese.
When they're coupons, clearly stated.
Well, here's the cottage cheese that's grown in your toenails.
Now, who's this son?
He's lying 7 and 9.
Klingon, penal colony.
Hello.
I forgot until three times.
No, okay.
I'm not known.
You know, I got a reason.
Of course, you hate my contract.
How about a one minute show, huh?
You can fill the other three minutes.
That's right.
No, can't you bind his next.
George.
Bye, bye, bye.
I'm excited.
They don't make him like that anymore.
In fact, they don't make him at all this week because the chicken act didn't send me his FedEx yet.
Right.
Can you give me an update on that?
I'm what year that might you up this week?
Because you said he was a day late.
I'm telling you what, a day late in several dollars short.
Oh, he's always several dollars short.
Yeah, and nothing.
So, what day is Thursday already?
Usually it shows up here on Tuesday.
So, now it's two days late.
I still have no phone call saying, there's a package down here for you at the concert.
You're right.
Betcha you get one.
I get one one.
Hemroy.
Okay.
884 on Chris's Pullman.
You're not going to make it.
What are you talking about?
You're not going to make it.
We're going for 900.
What are you talking about?
900, your ass.
Okay, believe me.
That's the way.
You've got to get to 1000.
You need 116.
It's a 16.
And you can't even get to 900.
As far as the whole audience is already, they've already checked in on here twice.
I'm sure of that.
What's the highest level of schooling you completed?
And we've got a lot of people out there, too stupid to be able to go to a computer and
to a tally, a tally hole on here.
Tally hole, baby.
My god.
Talk about an embarrassment.
It's a jacks fall.
I'm sure of that.
We were doing really well until he came in and opened up a big mouth.
And what was that all about?
What? Oh, you just happened to be in here while you were talking about him, so I threw him on the mic.
Oh, you did it. Oh, yeah. Don't do it again.
Talk to him more.
WDQA and Hello.
Yeah, I'm a worker, food or drug.
QA and Hello.
This is my friend.
WDQA and Hello.
I'm a lot of people. I just have no meal.
Yeah.
And that question for you, man. You went to arms with any families.
What?
Did you wear thongs or granny panties?
Or what?
Campongs or what?
Yeah, tampons.
Tamp one on, yeah.
Yeah?
How do you measure it through your ass though? How does that work?
5.67 or 05.60 pound, 5.60 on the...
Say that for Ryzen and sing it away with us, line.
You write the punks you're about to school.
Mm-hmm.
Which I'm sure is making for a really great summer for you.
Whatever.
Whatever is right. We get paid the same,
whether you call with your intellectual comments,
or whether it's just a bunch of mouth-breathing idiots.
Just a bunch of suck holes like that that is punk.
888. Oh, that's great.
You got 12 minutes to get to 900.
Because before you get to 1000, you know what? You got to get first?
900.
Right.
You're not going to make it.
889.
If I were going to get 1000, I won't come into one.
What?
If I don't hear the 1000, I won't come into one.
I think what Terran just thinking is if we don't hear the 1000,
don't come in again, period.
WDQAM, hello.
OK. 3, 9, 9, 7, 10, call.
WDQAM, hello.
8, nothing on the...
Yes, sir.
You know, come on and stay.
They go to the police.
You're not ready, you off.
You think that we can win the world here?
Yeah, the Marlins will win the World Series, right?
The Marlins will win the World Series.
And chickens are going to pee, too.
WDQAM, hello.
That was David...
That was David Samson's boyfriend, I'm sure of it.
Yes, sir.
I wasn't going to ask you if you still have the number that you're going to backseat in the car.
Then I realized he's probably old as you now.
Yes.
Do you have any idea what he was talking about?
500 dove.
He's a Indian.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
But at least he was different.
We didn't hear from the quarter-shark guy today.
You wonder why he's upset.
He wasn't the guy that wanted two million bucks.
Playing the quarter wheel of torture.
They don't have the quarter wheel of torture here.
Just a dollar.
And a five dollar from a Reese.
Oh, did I tell you that?
I'm trying to think of what day it was.
Maybe it was on Monday.
No, I guess it was over the weekend.
And we went over to a wood vine.
And as I'm walking out, there was Marise.
Crazy Marise that I'm always talking about.
The crazy frog.
And he's playing a five dollar machine.
He gets a spin for $2500.
And I went over to him and said, hey, nice job.
How much did he cost you to get that?
$9,000.
And he says it loud enough so everybody in the place can hear him.
Would you be bragging if you were that stupid?
The people do it all the time.
They're too stupid to realize how stupid they are.
So they brag.
I am.
He's bragging about the fact that he put in 9 grand before he finally had something.
Maniac, lunatic, frog, crazy frog.
WDQAM, hello.
QAM.
Hola.
WDQAM, hello.
You're my friend.
Oh, my God.
Seriously, something has to happen with that thing.
Something will.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Something has to be done with that.
All the other Kakarai I can deal with, but him, it's something has to happen, Jolly Jo Bell.
Oh, Joe's going to get his private detective working on that.
He's going to straighten out the air.
Right.
You couldn't straighten out your finger, Jolly Jo.
Isn't it amazing how impotent this guy is?
Yeah, that's amazing.
I mean, the simplest of tasks, things that people do in their sleep, this guy can't do
right away.
WDQAM, hello.
Yes.
Yeah, you know, I appreciate you calling me a fuckhole.
WDQAM, hello.
You just say, what the hell is going on?
WDQAM, hello.
Yeah, I love when you give us a silent pause so I can hear the signal from Cuba.
How's that coming by the way?
That's a signal problem.
Anything about that?
Yeah, they ignored it.
Oh, I like all the other problems.
See, one thing about Joe Bell, he doesn't deal with problems.
He doesn't worry about problems.
You want to know why?
Like you said, you had the answer.
He ignores him.
That's the way he deals with problems.
He doesn't.
And you want to know why?
He don't want it.
That's right.
There's marijuana and then there's don't want it.
What does that say?
898.
Is that correct?
899 for me.
Woo!
If we can give a little 903.
Whoa!
Now we're pushing it, baby.
Now we're pushing it to the 11903.
Everybody in their brotherhood law hop on neo-roger.com and just tally, Sally.
It's not a question you got to think about.
It's a survey.
Like, are you alive?
Are you dead?
Are you fat?
Are you gross?
Do you smell bad?
Like that.
You smell like some old training month.
Well, you had some of those people that would mind.
I've told you this for a long time.
I haven't gone there for four years now.
It's amazing that the nasal passages in my nose are still intact.
Some of those people smell so ungodly.
Ungodly.
Like that turd that the toyard turd thing we play.
Where she says it's like ungodly.
Like the devil crawled inside of you and to dive.
W.Q.A.M.
Hello.
Q.A.M.
Hey, Neil.
How you doing?
Okay, sir.
You know, I've been listening to you for a very long time and he's punk.
I'm driving these crazy as you are.
Driving you crazy.
And if at one point he keeps calling us, I have the ability.
I take him off back and kick his goddamn teeth in.
See, this guy claims he's been listening a long time.
He should know that we can't say that.
He does.
GD.
Can't say GD anymore, sir.
Oh, and you know what?
You weren't here on Tuesday, but that was one of the biggest stories in a long time.
The appeal score that threw out CBS, the FCC's fine against CBS.
Yeah.
For the Janet Jackson Justin Tinkerbell, Boudie Flam.
That was one of the biggest and of course that was what started all of this repression.
Right.
All of this clamping down, you can't say this and you can't do that.
The FCC's going crazy.
They're forming at the mouth and like that.
And nobody's talking about it because nobody's got the balls to come back to where we used to be.
Or at least close.
So like loosen it up a little bit.
And you know what?
They won't.
They won't because they're about to spine those colors.
That's this business.
That's this industry.
This is the life we have chosen.
909.
Can that be possible?
9-11.
Mm-hmm.
Wow.
They're coming through.
Coming through what?
You're asked?
You know.
WQA and hello.
I need help.
Yeah.
And we need help from you.
Okay.
I'm going to tell you right now.
Before this year is out, we're going to take care of business with your ass.
Okay.
We're going to say Luca Brozzi and a ghost of fat rich dear house and beat you into a bloody pulp.
That's not a threat.
That's a promise.
909.
You may have pleased.
I'm your pleased.
I'm your pleased.
I'm your pleased.
I'm 60QAM.
The sports leader.
I'm the two-hour.
Everybody knows one of the hippas things to do these days is to open a restaurant slash mini indoor theme park.
In the heart of Manhattan.
And that's why the high-powered folks at the National Rifle Association are pleased to announce Cafe NRA.
At Cafe NRA, every food item is unique.
That's because our chefs always cook your food over an open fire.
And speaking of food at Cafe NRA, you'll find only the finest,
delicious meats.
Welcome to Cafe NRA.
Do you like to try our keel of the day?
You mean, test of the day.
No, my appeal.
But Cafe NRA is about more than just food.
It's about guns.
And fun.
For instance, while you're dining, he's sure to play a quick game of find the crosshairs in your soup.
Find them and get a free clip of ammo for the automatic of your choice.
And before or after dinner, you'll find it's fun to get loaded in our bar.
Where every drink is served in shot glasses.
And for those of you who want to enjoy the fun of shooting something yourself,
Cafe NRA offers some of the most realistic shooting games you've ever seen.
Place such shooting favorites as, I didn't know the gun was looking.
I thought grandpa was a burglar and but officer.
The guy cut me off in traffic.
Cafe NRA.
We're blowing the competition away.
Hey, but Joe, the guy's taking lots of pros at it.
101 at 560 WQM.
I'm serious about that.
I'm not joking.
I have finally reached the breaking point with it.
Now, with anybody else, with it, with that, with that thing.
Remember the thing?
Oh, yeah.
Guaranteed, same family.
Same outfit, same brain, like that.
We're going to come and get you, Ron, and your crazy girlfriend, and the Ron too.
Hi, Ron!
Hi, Ron!
Right.
We're going to do it.
In fact, I'm taking matters into my own hands because I'm certainly not going to wait for Jolly Joe Bell or Joyce.
What's your name?
Schmidt?
Yeah.
Fitch?
Rhymes with bitch?
I'm not going to wait for them because the beesleaves are incompetent.
Make no mistake about it.
What they know about running a talk station or any of it, they would know how to run a gas station.
And even with the prices the way they are now, they couldn't make money at a gas station.
These lunatics, these mugwumps, these banjo-picking mugwumps.
Oh, that's all about sports, Neil.
We're going to have the best sports station.
That's what he said to me right to my face.
Right to my push.
Bruce Beasley.
We're going to have the best, and you know what?
Yeah.
Who cares?
Right.
Who cares?
Yeah.
That in 40 cents will buy about a third of a cup of coffee and it's still racing for the last.
Oh, I tell you, we're doing a hell of a job in that race.
I know we're going to win.
Trees down and other damage from a possible tornado in San Antonio.
Doesn't that break your heart?
God has really pissed off at that mugwumps in San Antonio.
929 on Chris' pull.
You got a real shot here at that thousand.
See, pulled it.
If you lean on it.
They'll do it more.
Let me get you a.m. Hello.
Mr. Rogers.
Yes, sir.
This week Kelly Craig is guest hosting with Banny Munoz on the morning show.
All I got to say about that is Kelly.
Manie.
Don't buy a house.
Oh, my God.
How can they fit them both in that studio?
Banny Munoz.
What a joke that is.
You don't think it reminds me of?
That's like Drew Hayes was the program director of W.Well, I said Chicago when they went all-time.
Drew Hayes worked for me at WNWS 790 back in the day when we had Alice, Rantel and Mr. Ego
and the jury of Williams in that whole deal.
Drew Hayes was the overnight kid who used to scream himself, horse, at the end of each show.
Just scream for five hours from midnight till five in the morning.
This is after Witsner were departed.
It was just on the weekend.
I think it was just weekend overnight kid.
And he became the program director at W.Well, I said Chicago.
Do you have any idea how ludicrous that is?
Yep.
And I think he was a big part of the reason that Lasseter just about lost his mind at W.Well, I said Chicago.
Problobbo.
Lost his brain at that place.
Putting a child in charge like we got for program director.
Once upon a time we had muff look what we got now.
WQA M Hello.
WQA M Hello.
Nia Rogers.
No.
Yeah.
What's going on, Barnard?
What do you got?
The Marlins.
I got an idea for the Marlins.
The Marlins?
Say it right.
Say it right.
The Marlins.
Look, Mully.
I thought.
I just wanted to say something.
I said we made a state of an higher-lea race track.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Nothing else going on.
Maybe the flamingos would enjoy the game.
Yeah, it'll be a hookah there in higher-lea.
I'm guaranteed to go.
Yeah, okay.
I'm bringing some more money to higher-lea, cowboy.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, okay.
Oh, cowboy.
Here we go with that schmunk again.
Cowboy.
Even Brady Quinn wouldn't touch what you got now.
I'll tell you that right now.
It ain't much.
934 on your pool.
We're creeping toward it.
I think I'm fairly confident.
Oh, there's a candy cowly.
935.
Candy cowly in Berlin.
Obama's about getting ready to speak to about
Is it in people in Berlin?
They love him over there.
Look at all those Germans.
I idea and with me on it, but generally.
Say some meat on it.
Right away, she's worried about lunch.
She's probably downing bratwurst like...
Oh, and I give you the good news is I got my shirt on
and my pantaloonies.
All right.
Because I made it into what I'm Thursday.
Because Taco's mama's got her hair be...
Not that that's got anything to do with it.
I would go anyway.
I don't need much of an excuse to go to woodbine.
And play quick hit.
Or sometimes take a quick...
Yeah.
Okay.
WDQ-A-M, hello.
I'm Karen.
WDQ-A-M, hello.
Hey, Neil.
You put your jersey on the air.
Who are you to talk about people for gun-clawed by people?
You put your jersey on the air.
Nothing bad about anything to do with how we going...
That's a turn-to-radio backup, Ian Lonser.
Turn it up and hear your own voice.
And stick your finger deep inside your neck all the way to the elbow.
Don't you love people that you want to hear the sound of their own voice?
Oh, yeah.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60 on the Verizon Sinclair wireless line.
WDQ-A-M, hello.
Neil, how you doing, Mata?
What?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Dude, this guy is getting all fired up this, but I'm scared.
I'm a friend and all this.
Yes.
You're playing right into his stick.
You know he's having the name of his life if he's so much of the show.
What would it mean the day of his life?
He calls this show 65,000 times air-blued single-day for like two years now.
You're making him such a part of the show.
Why don't you just have Chris Green call?
Oh, yeah.
That will do it.
Well, because, hey, we do when we don't screen calls on a show, sir.
I don't play that game.
They're part of the show.
The partner does not.
The partner does not.
I never hear this clown on when it's Georgia's days.
Yeah.
He's got him down past, man.
And?
He doesn't get through.
No chance.
Do you hate me?
Sorry, but.
I do.
That's why they Chris do it.
So he never gets through when Chris Green's a cause?
Well, they can't disguise their voices.
Even when the girlfriend calls in for him?
Even.
The bitch?
Even when?
Well, good.
I'm telling you.
I'm just here filling in for Georgia today anyhow.
That's right.
Don't expect that I know what the hell I'm doing here.
Just relax.
I'm doing the best I can.
I'm a dottering old fool who keeps pooping in his pants.
Just, you know, just leave me alone.
Freaking Joe Bell.
Man, this guy, he is an impediment to everything.
Oh, yeah.
If you're at screen, the calls need a little to it.
And every time I ask you about the calls, I get the same response.
But your calls.
Yeah.
Good, huh?
Like, Polentith.
What do you mean by that?
By the way, the guy that keeps facking you wanting the free pocket isn't going to happen?
What?
The guy that keeps facking you from the keys wanting a free plug for his business isn't going to happen.
No.
He just keeps facking me about what?
He wants a free plug for his business.
No.
And it isn't going to happen.
No.
N-O-O.
No.
N-E-T.
9.
10.
9.
42 on the survey, the highest level of school you completed, some college 297.
Graduated from college 287.
The intellectual neo-Rodges audience really comes through here on this survey.
Forget about the callers.
They're losers with no lives.
Anybody that's got a real life in the middle of the day time, that's calling some radio talk show.
Forget about that.
Post-graduate 165.
Graduated from high school 103.
High school dropout 45.
Elementary school dropout 17. Currently in college 15. Kindergarten dropout 7. Oh a new
category I like it. Currently in high school 3 and junior high middle school dropout
3 out of 942. We're on our way man to that thousand. I don't think screening the calls
was the answer. I don't think we should allow him to interfere with our livelihood. I
think what we should do is get the name, get the phone number, put it all in the year,
have a caravan over a big nasty guys with baseball bats go over here and then maybe he might find
something else to do. This guy keeps calling that sounds like he knows the law. We know restraining
orders apply to phone calls also. What are you talking about? We can get a restraining order against
these people. Yeah. Because it applies to phone calls also. That's what this guy keeps saying. You
know I'm not a lawyer. What were you talking about? I mean on your show? No on this show,
we're restraining orders against people that you don't want to contact you. Yeah. He
has the phone call. He keeps calling. I don't recall that call. No, no. He called yeah, he calls me,
but about the same thing. Sorry. Yeah. And? And nothing I think it's a good idea. It's a word.
It's an excellent idea, but it requires some effort on a part of this company, on a part of
Joyce the Bitch Bitch. She's too worried about whether we're playing fart sounds out of video.
Or whether we're seeing this scum my bucket or douche a ball or like that.
In fact, you know something if they want to get a crown out there, the Marlon's Auto Start
Play in doucheball. The left hand is the largest 40 to 50 QAM. The fourth leader. Hey everybody.
So take a few minutes and come on and do it.
Oh, no, no.
There it check it.
Oh, no, no, no.
Yeah.
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no.
This is a bad boy.
I'm not going to make a shot over here. I was going to show you with that.
Oh, she's here.
I'm the one who's waiting out.
How are you doing all day? Shopping for jelly shoes.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
On 17, they must have a psychic collar that little a punk that called before about
having a Marlins play at the High Martins.
The Marlins?
See.
Because the Palm Beach Post says a Virginia multimillionaire with a soft spot for horses
and preserving history, said he wants to buy highly a park,
restore it to its most glorious state and resume wintertime racing of the facility,
which has been dormant since 2001.
Hasley Minor, 43, founder of NASDAQ 100 Technology News site,
seen it, and owner of an also ran in this year's Florida, Derby,
hopes he can strike a deal with highly owner,
the anxious John Brunetti, begin renovation to the Hurricane Ravage Park,
and compete with Delstein Park during the prime time of the tourist season.
Minor and Brunetti haven't spoken, so no timetables or dollar figure have been discussed.
Reach Friday on a trip to California for the opening of Delmar,
Brunetti was intrigued and said he would spend the weekend talking to a horseman to learn about
minor. I wonder if he's kind to de-way minor.
I continue to say that my first desire was a continuation of racing at
Hylia at the highest standard possible Brunetti said, I wonder if that was with or without the
Green Hot Dogs. I think that Hylia would get a lot of support from readers' owners, fans,
and everyone else. Every place I go I hear when you open up Hylia, John,
and it becomes vitriolic like why the hell don't you open up and get rid of these guys?
As recently as this spring Brunetti agreed that the resumption of racing at Hylia,
which opened in 1925, represented one of the longest of long shots.
He estimated would take 25 to 30 million dollars to get in a racing shape, even then issues remain,
whether racing license can be obtained from the state, whether Hylia can compete with
Gulfstream and Calder, and whether accessibility will deter fans.
Well what does that mean accessibility? They built a freaking metro fail right out there at Hylia,
just blocks from the Dan Track. Couldn't they have like a ride in park thing or something like that?
Could they have like shuttle buses that would take them from the metro rail to stop there right
into the track? Yep. Myer said he needs to study those issues, but is determined to press forward.
Hylia last held a race on May 22nd 2001. I wonder if Charlie Balthazar was in that race.
So minor 43 has never attended the track, not even to turn the grounds in their prison state. He said
that doesn't matter. No matter. Well that sounds intriguing, doesn't it? It's intriguing.
And of course John Brunetti who helped destroy the place in it in the first place,
he's talking about what it would take to put it back together again. He kind of reminds me of Greg
Reed and Joe Bell. It's that broken egg philosophy, you know. Pick up the egg, smash it on the floor,
put your shoe on it, and then smash the egg shells, and then try to put it back together again.
And then keep doing it over and over again. Isn't that the philosophy of QAN?
Yep. Break it and fix it. Break it and fix it. Although in this case it's break it and don't fix it.
Break it and don't fix it. Break it worse and don't fix it.
We got a guy in engineering called fix it. Even he can't fix it. He's a good guy. He's just an
ept. He just worked too long with Steve Ziegler. That was pretty intriguing that IOD,
that little furry we had there. We're not sure. 9.59. Now where are all those people?
Where's Mitch Weenie these days? I don't know. He's probably making a lot of money still.
You know, he threw up on his wedding night. I heard that story. Yeah.
You can imagine why, but I don't want to tell you. No, tell me. I can't see it on the air.
Okay.
Enough said. 9.59 on the survey in Chris's very confident we need 41 votes. We got 40 minutes.
That's 1.1 minute to get to 1000. If we don't get it we're going to be 9.60.
9.50 by the way in Rochester was WVB. After home was until the busy V's. Would Joe Dean?
And Morton's bomb. I mean what kind of a guy goes on here with a name like Morton's bomb,
huh? Yeah. WDQAM. Hello.
I don't think so. No. I'm very uncomfortable. 5.6705.60.
pound.
How many QAAM? Hello? Yeah. As far as our program director goes like how much freedom
would a program director have like to be imagined a real diverse type of like radio station?
Is that possible? Well, what does that mean?
What did you want to say? There were a lot of there were a lot of words in that question there,
but what what did they mean? They meant like is there any radio station that really does have like
a lot of diversity like a talk in the morning hip hop rock. The closest thing that comes to that is like
VLM. Oh yeah. That's a great station. Yeah. The U.M. As far as N560. Yeah. And so is that air?
Who cares? Oh there's a kid from VLM. Maybe he knows Mike Rosenthal. And what's his name?
Who's the PA guy? Don't tell me. Roqueach. Okay. Roqueach.
I said it before you did fatso. Well you said don't tell you so I didn't tell you. And then you
said Jay that's because you got the Roqueach part. You know what? Never ever trust fat people.
I know that being a fat person myself, they'll never trust fat people.
They'll always pull some stunt. Oh there's Barack Obama and Berlin. To give his speech,
he's very clear to say. We don't want to hear you, honey. We want to hear what he's saying.
Not going to be political. It's more lyrical. That's the people on CNN, MSNBC, and FoxBake News.
To the people of Germany. They never shut up.
Let me thank Chancellor Merkel and four ministers, Steinmeier, for welcoming me earlier today.
Thank you, Mayor Boehmere. The Berlin Senate, the police, and most of all, thanks to all of you
for this extraordinary welcome. Thank you.
Well, look at that. Mom's in the two-garden front.
I come to Berlin as so many of my countrymen have come before.
Although tonight I speak to you not as they candidate for president, but as a citizen.
A proud citizen of the United States and a fellow citizen of the world.
I know that I don't look like the Americans who've previously spoken in this great city.
The journey that led me here is improbable. My mother was born in the hardland of America,
but my father grew up hurting goats and Kenya.
His father.
My father was a cook, a domestic servant to the British. At the height of the cold war,
my father decided like so many others in the forgotten corners of the world that his journey,
his dream, required the freedom and opportunity promised by the West.
And so he wrote letter after letter to universities all across America
until somebody somewhere answered his prayer for a better life.
That's the I'm thinking it's a good plan. We do the break right now.
I'm going to come back. We can pick it up. Maybe then he'll get into the really good stuff.
The biggest name of the best talent.
Here's the final round of the world's number one.
Fifty-two-a-am.
The fourth leader.
The world that there is no challenge to great for a world that stands as one.
Sixty years after the airlift, we are called upon again.
History has led us to a new crossroad with new promise and new peril.
When you, the German people, tore down that wall, a wall that divided East and West,
freedom and tyranny, fear and hope.
Walls came tumbling down around the world.
From Kiev to Cape Town, prison camps were closed and the doors of democracy were opened.
Markets opened too and the spread of information and technology reduced barriers to opportunity and prosperity.
While the 20th century taught us that we share a common destiny,
the 21st century has revealed a world more intertwined than any time in human history.
The fall of the Berlin Wall brought new hope, but that very closeness has given rise to new dangers.
Dangerous, they cannot be contained within the borders of a country or by the distance of an ocean.
Think about it. The terrorists of September 11th plotted in Hamburg and trained in Kandahar and
Karachi before killing thousands from all over the globe on American soil.
As we speak, cars in Boston and factories in Beijing are melting the ice caps in the Arctic,
shrinking coastlines in the Atlantic and bringing drought to farms from Kansas to King.
Poorly secured nuclear material in the former Soviet Union or secrets from a scientist in Pakistan could help build a bomb that detonates in Paris.
The poppies in Afghanistan come to Berlin in the form of heroin.
The poverty and violence in Somalia breathed the terror of tomorrow that genocide in Dark War
changed the conscience of us all.
In this new world such dangerous currents have swept along faster than our efforts to contain them
and that is why we cannot afford to be divided. No one nation, no matter how large or
powerful, can defeat such challenges alone. None of us can deny these threats or escape response
to milk in meeting them. Yet in the absence of Soviet tanks and a terrible wall has become
easy to forget this truth. And if we're honest with each other, we know that sometimes on both sides
of the Atlantic we have drifted apart and forgotten our shared destiny. In Europe, the view that
America is part of what has gone wrong in our world rather than a force to help us make it right
has become all to come. In America there are voices that derived and deny the importance
of Europe's role in our security and our future. Both views miss the truth that Europeans today
are bearing new burdens and taking more responsibility in critical parts of the world and that just
as American bases built in the last century still help to defend the security of this continent.
So does our country still sacrifice greatly for freedom around the globe?
Yes, there have been differences between America and Europe. No doubt there will be differences in
the future. But the burdens of global citizenship continue to bind us together. A change of leadership
in Washington will not lift this burden. In this new century Americans and Europeans alike will be
required to do more, not less. Partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice.
It is the only way, the one way to protect our common security and advance our common humanity.
That is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another.
The walls between old allies on either side of the Atlantic cannot stand. The walls between the
countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand. The walls between races and
tribes, natives and immigrants, Christians and Muslims and Jews cannot stand. These
walls are fallen before. After centuries of strike the people of Europe have formed a union
of promise and prosperity. Here are the base of a column built to mark victory in war. We need in
the center of a Europe at peace. Not only have walls come down in Berlin but they come down in
belt-fest where Protestant and Catholic find a way to live together. In the Balkans where our
struggle of a courageous people defeated a part-time. So history reminds us that walls can be torn down
but the task is never easy. True partnership and true progress requires constant work and
sustained sacrifice. They require sharing the burdens of development and diplomacy of peace and
progress. They require allies who will listen to each other, learn from each other and most of all
trust each other. That is why America cannot turn inward. That is why Europe cannot turn inward.
America has no better partner than Europe. Now is the time to build new bridges across the globe
as strong as the one that binds us across the Atlantic. Now is the time to join together through
constant cooperation and strong institutions and shared sacrifice and a global commitment to
progress to meet the challenges of the 21st century. It was this spirit that led airlift
planes to appear in the sky above our heads and people to assemble where we stand today.
And this is the moment when our nations and all nations must summon that spirit anew.
This is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it.
This threat is real and we cannot shrink from our responsibility to combat it.
If we could create NATO to face down the Soviet Union, we can join in a new and global partnership
to dismantle the networks that have struck in Madrid and Hamam and landed in Bali,
in Washington and New York. If we could win a battle of ideas against the communist,
we can stand with the vast majority of Muslims who reject the extremism that leads to hate
instead of hope.
I tell you one thing, there's no John McCain, thank god.
$9.79 on your pool and let me ask you one thing about his speech though, they're in Berlin.
What does it have to do with sports? Oh, I'm sorry. What's it got to do with the Marlins?
The Barley with the important stuff.
The fact that McCain is even got like 10% of the pools that in itself is scary.
But it's America, Zion America. $9.79 on your pool,
create $9.80. You got 21 minutes to get 20 more votes.
You better push it big time maybe. Come on people, help us out.
Maybe we'll have.
Maybe we'll have.
Maybe we'll have.
Maybe we'll have.
We'll have to push it out man.
He needs to have.
Yeah, let me put money in there and we can go to that place.
We can play him.
We can play him.
We can play him.
We can play him.
We can play him.
We can play him.
No.
This is the moment to give our children a little bit better for her if you want them to士 the bar
This is the moment to herausth a moment when we must give hope to those left behind in agglombless world
We must remember that the Cold War born in this city was not a battle for land or treasure.
Sixty years ago the planes that flew over Berlin did not drop bombs. Instead they delivered food and cold and candy to grateful children.
And in that show of solidarity those pilots won more than a military victory. They won hearts and minds, love and loyalty and trust.
Not just from the people in this city but from all those who heard the story of what they did here.
Now the world will watch and remember what we do here, what we do with this moment.
Will we extend our hand to the people in the forgotten quarters of this world who yearn for lies marked by dignity and opportunity by security and justice?
Will we lift the child in Bangladesh from poverty and shelter the refugee in Cheb and banish the scourge of AIDS in our time?
Will we stand for the human rights of the dissident in Burma, the blogger in Iran or the voter in Zimbabwe?
Will we give meaning to the words never again in Darfur?
Will we acknowledge that there is no more powerful example than the one each of our nations projects to the world?
Will we reject torture and stand for the rule of law? Will we...
Will we welcome immigrants from different lands and shun discrimination against those who don't look like us or worship like we do and keep the promise of equality and opportunity for all of our people?
People of Berlin, people of the world, this is our moment, this is our time.
I know my country is not perfect of itself.
At times we struggle to keep the promise of liberty and equality for all of our people.
We've made our share of mistakes, and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions.
But I also know how much I love America.
I know that for more than two centuries we have strived at great cost and great sacrifice to form a more perfect human, to seek with other nations a more hopeful world.
Our allegiance has never been to any particular tribe or kingdom.
Indeed, every language is spoken in our country. Every culture has left its imprint on ours. Every point of view is expressed in our public swears.
What has always united us, what has always driven our people, what drew my father to America's shores is a set of ideals that speak to aspiration shared by all people.
That we can live free from fear and free from what? That we can speak our minds and assemble with whomever we choose and worship as we please.
These are the aspirations that join the fates of all nations in this city.
These aspirations are bigger than anything the drugs has supported.
It is because of these aspirations that the airlift began. It is because of these aspirations that all free people, everywhere, became citizens of Berlin.
It is in pursuit. It is in pursuit of these aspirations that a new generation, our generation, must make our mark on the world.
People of Berlin and people of the world, the scale of our challenge is greater. The road ahead will be long.
But I come before you to say that we are heirs to a struggle for freedom. We are a people of improbable hope with an eye toward the future, with resolve in our heart.
Let us remember this history and answer our destiny and remake the world once again. Thank you, Berlin.
Thank you.
There is your next president, whether you know it or not.
Oh no, he is this, he is that, his wife. She is not ready for prime time.
That is one of the talking points.
Is Michelle Obama ready?
Talking points from desperate people who have been a desperate candidate. An old daughtering fool.
989 on Chris's pool. You were 11 vote short, Mr. New York 11 minutes to go.
We are going to do it. The challenge is yours right now. I never really thought it was going to be this tense right down to the ass wire.
Did you?
Yeah.
Earlier in the hour, I thought we had it made in the shade. And of course, I played the Obama speech here a lot of it.
And oh, well, we don't know what that's all about. And I guess they are all my way.
Either that or they were so transfixed and glued. They certainly were going to take time off.
They go hold on some stupid pool on a survey. And our survey says we still got 989.
I think Eric said it is for them to break, don't you?
Probably.
Fast turn.
Give us a break, Eric.
Take your fat foot off the break.
I guess I'm sure we this week schedule, huh?
Yeah. What do you mean by that?
Why would you say like half baked?
Oh, because I'm only half baked right now.
I don't say half baked. Say it fully baked.
92.
991.
92.
992, we need only eight more votes to get to 1000, which would be, and now you understand why I put it on there like it 205 yesterday with this in mind.
Knowing that it's the dog days of the summer time, there's like about 50 people in town.
And if we're going to get a thousand votes at any point, here's a chance. It's not even a pool.
You don't have to have an opinion. It's just a survey.
That's all it is. Even a moron could do a cast of vote on this.
993. They're trickling in by the ones.
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
Oh, I got it.
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
I was at work listening to the stream, and I just got to listen to that speech live.
That's just why your show rules.
How do you like that? The whisperer like Obama's speech.
Well, that's why I put it on. I mean, most of the people who are listening, they're out sitting glued in front of some TV screen somewhere.
Right?
996. You think that 790 is going to put Barack Obama on the air, making a speech and roll in in front of a million people?
You think they're going to put that on across the street with just two gods over there?
With his finger in the socket?
Of course not. What do we got? 996?
Get out of here.
Thousand two.
Oh, we did it.
How do you like that?
You like that, everybody?
It's OK.
Somebody Q-A-M, hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
What a speech, huh?
Yeah.
This guy is awesome, man.
He's the first person.
Yes, yes, I like it so much. That's all I want to say, man.
OK.
That's why you cook and rules.
I do.
Right.
You're married.
Thousand two vote on the survey.
It's just a survey just to see how smart or dumb or in between you are, yeah?
Of course, the fact that you read the way the college has made you smart.
Right?
Right?
The fact that you got a piece of paper that says you're smart doesn't mean you're smart.
Right?
Remember when you're all kinds of college.
She's an idiot.
Are you picking on Mama?
But, yeah.
You Mama?
What about Paco's Mama?
She's getting her heard on today.
Which is a good thing because that means I can, I got my shoes on, my pantal unease in my shirt.
I got my, um, my card that opens up the gate in the parking garage in my pocket.
So I can rush right down to my beautiful Corvette and zip over to Woodbine, get on the
guard near on a stressway.
Aren't you excited for me?
Aren't you, old guy?
Huh?
Killer chicken?
Killer chicken for me so I can get a blue sprawl on it, man.
So I can get me a good machine and win about, uh, 20, 30 million a day.
What do you think?
A rat.
I'll send you a couple of shovers.
The biggest name of my college.
This is Rodgers.
It's 4.50 QAM.
And the fourth leader.
It's day high.
Miami Town.
Perpure has five six-oh.
WQA.
Once there was a sanitary who was caught indulging a habit.
You fare a boob or roll not much different like a typical Miyokata gig.
It's all too loud.
We all thank you.
For giving us something funny to do.
You're looking for guys who make you go high.
I hope so.
Larry Craig, thank you for tapping your shoe.
You're fairly.
You still means last but you did.
But you refused to go away.
The public ends our drive.
I really did.
Hey, baby.
Yeah.
It's all too loud for me.
With Cheek Up High.
We all invite you to live.
And I fall.
The knee of my heart.
It was certain to go high.
Love you taking no crap when it's happening to you.
You fare a boob.
Game, game, game.
I never have been gay.
Game, game, game.
I never have been gay.
It's all too loud for me.
He wants to stay gay.
But he's all party wants him to go away.
Love him to just run high.
What's good to say?
Larry Craig, his red lips say it's for you.
He wants a man to swim in any guy we'll do.
Bye, bye, bye.
The biggest name is a sex talent.
Are you sure?
I'm a sexual fool.
My amazement opens for close.
The most videos of 560 for you.
U-A-L-I-M-A-S-So, I'm a lot of that.
What the hell, what is the weight of it?
What is this?
