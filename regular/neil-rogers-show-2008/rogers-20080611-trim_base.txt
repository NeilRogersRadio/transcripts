Fireless with it! Fireless it! Honest, give me another beer.
No, no, no.
In this case, I'll move out of the David with an important message from men over a hundred and eighty.
If you see strange things floating in your eyes or occasionally see the shadow people,
well then, you may be suffering from a did macaroni degeneration.
The voiced sides of macaroni degeneration, little white dude,
a nudely looking lines on your nose. Those ain't noodles, those are maggots.
Who are you calling a fake? I said maggots, pop, pop, pop, you need your daring check.
What do you know about Ben's house? Now see, he the health of sport whosers and pups.
The case, Matt has been has an encounter with other sport whosers.
And they're assured of them being in the pink, so to speak, and more exciting in the bedroom.
I've seen a reason why they run so many Ben's health spots.
Why sure, so they can see Adam and Ben are here.
That's why I'm telling them about the macaroni degeneration.
It's macaroni, only degeneration, come and hatch her.
Go and strong, go go go go.
That's macular degeneration!
Watch her jump.
I don't like no mysterious way, did I?
Now, put yourself behind some place.
We got a lot to see, see?
When you go driving on the street.
10-1 at 560 WDQM, happy Wednesday to 11th of June.
Boy, oh boy, what a great weekend this is gonna be, you know why?
Why?
Now I know why for you.
Damn.
In fact, this isn't the really great weekend, the good weekend start next weekend.
Because for me they start on Friday and they end on Tuesday.
All summer long.
40, 40 weekends.
Don't let them know that's going on.
I'm sure they don't.
No, obviously, because what does it got to do with the game?
The Marlins won.
Marlins?
How about that new ballpark?
Anybody interested?
No, paying for it.
Oh.
Anybody interested in going there?
No.
See, a lot of cryptic comments from the readers of the hero on the article this morning about the new Marlins stadium for the Marlins?
They're having a hell of a season, man.
Anybody going to the game?
No.
No, just like that one comment says, nobody's going now.
Who the hell is going to go way to hell down there in the end of this battle?
Where the orange ball was.
Good.
God.
Maybe Crystal will go because he lives down there.
What?
And you're back today.
You don't live down there?
Yeah, I do, but I'm going to live further south in that.
But do I get free tickets?
No.
Then I ain't going.
How do you like that?
That doesn't do any good for the revenue stream for the ballpark for the club.
If I was on Freebies.
If they pay me more here all by myself.
They're not going to pay you more here.
Well, then I ain't going.
Let me say it right now.
You weren't here yesterday.
You weren't here on Monday.
We had such technical nightmares on Monday.
And at the beginning of the show yesterday, we thought it was going to be...
And at the beginning before the show this morning, it looked like, oh boy.
But look at that phone, man.
It's working.
QIM.
All right.
What more could you want than that to start a great Wednesday, huh?
What did I tell you?
That was Joe Bell, by the way.
He's very much involved in the show.
Yesterday, he emailed me about the restaurant in Cooper City.
What is it again?
Oh, I forget.
Beverly Hills Cafe.
You forgot. Of course you forgot because you're getting old and sena.
You're losing your memory from too much bad weed until these skanks.
It's good weed and please.
It's much hanky-panky with too many skanky broad.
Please don't describe these women that way.
Skanky.
You have no idea.
I don't have any idea.
Do you know what I want?
I don't know.
Well, it doesn't keep lying.
Keep making stuff up.
Okay, good. That's my intent.
I know.
I know.
You're a stupid.
I know. That's what you're always doing.
I'm not as stupid as you think.
Let's take a look at that Q&A lineup.
You want to talk about stupid.
I mean, we got the jerk show at 2.
Q&A.M.
Hello?
Hello.
Thank you so much for the work.
Okay, they're working.
Bye.
The jerk show at 2.
Mad Dog 4-650.
And then at 6.50 it's the 10 fastest minutes in radio because 8.5 minutes of our spots.
Just to be angry with the Marlon Pregame Report.
First bitch, pitch.
And then Dolphin and I would keep a vote camp for a 7-8 that's been sliced down to an hour because there was a public outcry like, oh my god.
And then 8.11.
It's the V-A show.
Then midnight to 5.00 in the morning is ESPN radio.
There's a gap in the schedule.
You notice that Chris, there's a gap in thirds and schedule here.
11.00 a midnight we must be doing transmitter maintenance or something like that.
You think?
Maybe.
Because there's nothing on from 11.00 a midnight.
And we'll still go.
Oh, point.
Oh, regardless.
Q-A-M. Hello.
I've been waiting at Tom's day.
Yay.
Q-A-M. Hello.
Hi, Tom.
See, we got the phones working out. Aren't you excited? I am.
Oh, yeah.
We've been taking a lot of calls today. Tomorrow and Friday.
Tons of them.
Millions of them.
Beans of them.
Not that I'm sending in or anything like that.
In fact, I got to do a joys again all of a sudden.
I just got to do a joys.
Yeah.
In fact, I think right now.
Just while you're sitting there.
You left the letter out.
No, I didn't.
And it won't be right here either.
Be close.
Q-A-M. Line 9.
Not line.
Close them.
Yeah, close that.
Close that.
Hear my friend.
Close that.
He stood right there at Gulfstream Parkman.
We had a chance to take care of some business, you know.
He didn't do it.
Three people.
That's what we need.
There's two out of the boyfriend.
Four people.
Mm-hmm.
But, Johnny, Joe, you know,
while I mean, I would be about, I'd be Johnny Joe's going to private detective.
And he's going to take care of business, man.
Yeah, he's going to take care of squat.
I had a dream last night that was doing a music show in Tampa.
I was on some non-existent radio station.
And Bob Green was the general manager.
And it was the same old thing.
I've always told you about these nightmares.
I have about this business.
About doing a record show.
And I was queuing up records, but I couldn't hear the cue.
And I'd never had a record ready.
In other words, the spots would end.
I'd come back and my record was never queued up because I couldn't hear it.
And I didn't know who these other people were that I was working with.
I just showed up there.
And I was, you know, near Rogers on some horse ball station in Tampa with Bob Green as GM.
I am going to go rejoice right now.
Really? Right now?
Yeah, right now.
I've got a lot of calls that you could take.
Uh-huh.
QAM, hello.
Like that one.
I was pretty good.
That was the best one so far.
But just going to say that.
Well, it's wrong with that.
It was getting better.
Yeah, I'd better do it right now.
Wow.
Or should I do the break now?
Okay, do that.
Do that.
Bad form if I got up and vacated it.
I'm telling you, I'll be back.
I'm just telling you, it's an emergency situation.
All right.
I think it had to do with the start of the show.
Probably.
Or the fact that Fat Chris is back.
That might have not.
He's moving you.
Scared the **** out of me.
I'll be back.
All right.
Take it easy.
I got a second to take some of these calls.
QAM, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Let me ask you a favor.
He's not here.
He went to the bathroom.
And that was it.
Oh, he didn't care.
QAM, hello.
Hey, how are you?
Fine.
Neil went to the bathroom.
He went potty.
He went to go poop.
Hey, Neil.
Neil's not here.
He went to go poop.
Is there something I can help you with today, sir?
What happened to Joey Reynolds?
He's in New York.
QAM, hello.
Good God.
Hello.
Re time.
Okay.
QAM, hello.
Hey, it's the boyfriend.
QAM, hello.
Neil.
He's not here.
QAM, hello.
No.
And there you go.
That was it.
That was it.
That was it.
I'm not taking it all.
Speaking of not taking it all, he's going to be popping in any second now.
So Josh Cordis.
You're right.
Come in and say, what's the deal with now?
I'm going to save it, see?
What's the deal with what?
I'm not going to say.
I'm saving it, see?
What is that mean?
I could have done a half hour tirade on what he just told me.
No, I'm saving.
No, I'm saving it.
I'm saving it.
Monitor, I'm saving it.
I want to go down.
Well, then stop calling these women's gangs.
Call them ladies.
What's the deal with what?
Monitor, touchers.
What?
Monitor, touchers.
What does that mean?
People want to point to something on your computer and they insist on shmuring their hands on it while they're doing so.
They like, they got to get their finger on there and smudge up your monitor that you try to keep clean so that you can see what's going on.
I never had that happen.
Well, you don't have people looking over your shoulder on your computer saying, well, you see this over here?
Like, they just can't point to it.
They got to touch the screen with the fingers on there, see?
Thanks, I'll hang up and listen.
Okay.
That was excellent.
WDQAM, hello.
Wrong line.
QAM, hola.
What the hell was that?
QAM, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, I think that's a picture, buddy.
From the downstream.
Yeah.
What's with all George's expressions?
It's now a gate half the time.
What's that all about?
Gate?
A gate, yes.
Yeah.
Hey, what about Paul?
Hey, I thought I'll hit you.
Hey, Neil.
You know what you need?
What's with the ball, you know what you need, sir?
I thought I'd offer a hitch on that.
You need a life is what you need.
I have no life.
That's what I'm sure that's what he said.
Ten minutes after the temple, I was pretty quick when I did a new job, like usual.
Very quick.
And you're eating already?
It's a little ten o'clock.
Right.
Christ almighty.
And Brandon's already got his instant messaging screen up there on a thing.
Oh, stop.
Fifty-five second dump.
You certainly have it done.
Oh, he's to his timing, my dump.
That doesn't include the seven seconds each way from the big,
you get that room.
I didn't use the small guest bathroom.
It's closer to the room.
I'm like if that time was spent on paperwork.
Neil, God.
Hello and welcome to a current affair.
The presumptive Republican nominee, John McCain, renewed a challenge to Barack Obama today.
He said he'd like to travel around the country together and host a joint townhold meeting
every week for ten weeks, beginning next week.
The 71-year-old Vietnam veteran also issued a challenge suggesting that instead of debate,
he and Obama be dropped naked into a forest with only a hunting knife to see who comes out alive.
Putting a cigarette out on his tongue, McCain added,
the day I get out tracking the jungle is the day I saw off my own b****.
And Obama quickly told reporters he thought it was a great idea.
I may be skinny, but I'm tough to...
John McCain is a hundred years.
I get angry from time to time.
And guess what?
I'm looking forward to it.
I'm there worst night.
Yeah, you're everybody's worst nightmare after a W.
I'll tell you that.
Ten sixteen at five sixteen W.

And I had to change and put this one on there a second poll to get to a thousand.
Oh well.
Poor guy.
Poor guy.
Well, son, in other words, you're sucking up to Judge Cordis.

Cool.
Now, security scanners that can see through passengers clothing and reveal details such as
their sex organs, colostomy bags.
And breast size are being installed in ten U.S. airports.
They're going to be able to see your sex organs, your colostomy bag, and your breast size.
A random selection of travelers getting ready to board airplanes in Washington, New York's
Kennedy, L.A., and other key hubs will be shut in the glass booths.
While all three dimensional images made of their body beneath their clothing, I think what would be real good is if they had like a big
scoreboard like at ballpark, you know.
And everybody in the airport could see you.
Would that be great?
That would be great.
And right next to your name, the other vital statistics like your weight measurements.
Right.
That's right.
The length of the excellent.
The booths close around the pasture and emit millimeter waves that go through cloth to identify metal plastic
ceramics, chemical materials, and explosives according to the TSA.
While it allows the security screeners looking at the images in a separate room to clearly see the passengers, sexual organs, as well as other details of the body,
the passenger's face is blurred TSA said, well that's no fun.
What if it's somebody really hot going through that scanner and you want to see their goods, you know.
If you blur out their posts, the scan only takes seconds and is to replace the physical
breakdowns of people that's currently widespread in airports.
The TSA began introducing the body scanner's airports in April, the first in the penis, penis, penis service on a terminal.
The installation is picking up this month with machines waiting to hear this.
With machines in place or planned for airports in Washington, Reagan National and Baltimore Washington International, Dallas, Las Vegas,
Albuquerque, Detroit, and Miami.
Oh my God.
The new machines have provoked worries among passengers and rights activists.
People have no idea how graphic the images are, very start-hard directly, technology and liberty program, with the ACLU said.
The ACLU said passengers expecting privacy underneath their clothing should not be required to display highly personal details of their bodies, such as evidence of mastectomies,
colostomy appliances, penile implants, catheter tubes, cubes.
And the size of their breast are general as a prerequisite to boarding a plane.
Before you get on the plane, we want to see your goods baby. Let me turn it that right now. Let's see your junk.
Right, enter-bads.
Besides masking their faces, the TSA says on a website, the images made will not be printed, stored or transmitted.
Yeah, likely story. Are we buying that? No. No way.
Once the transportation security on it, and of course you'll be seeing all these goofballs that work security there by the scanners that they are put laughing and giggling,
ahaha, Tee-ee-ee. Oh yeah. Oh sure. They'll be telling stories.
They'll laugh at you! Yeah.
I can just hear the first voice now at Miami International.
Mm-hmm.
I'll find it, especially the guys that have innings.
You call that a penis?
You know, Larry Euseilding, a TSA spokesperson said,
Oh, Lara, I thought, oh, Lara, Lara is kind of planning for it.
Lara Euseilding, a TSA spokesperson said,
passengers were not obliged to accept the new machines.
The passengers can choose between the body imaging and the patdowns, you said.
Well, it all depends on who's patting me down.
TSA 4C's 30 of the machines installed across the country by the end of this year
and Europe Amsterdam's Skippel Airport is already using the scanners.
Skippel Airport in my ass.
When you come to security, when you get off the plane and you go down to security
at Skippel Airport in Amsterdam, that puts the skip in Skippel.
You just skip your way through there, you hold up your passport, and they go,
okay, go ahead.
I mean, you talk about security, they don't care.
I mean, they don't even put on an act like they care.
Role, that's another story. They got those oozees man,
and they'll just blow your crap away to give them a dirty look at Role,
at least they used to.
I'm going to have to start getting across the pond again before I croak.
Maybe I'll have to do that this year, go over across the pond,
even with the Euro at 80 bucks or whatever it is.
What is it, 500 bucks?
5,000 bucks for a penny.
Thank you again, Mr. President, for those little gas prices,
which are now at record highs again, well over four bucks a gallon.
How about that broad-to-cogist today, that lady?
She was no lady.
Give me crap for my Corvette.
Well, I hear how he's bitching this out because we don't do anything.
First of all, she's not the listener anyway, or husband,
as I guess she was trying to impress her husband.
He already knows what a bitch he can be, I'm sure.
785 on a port boy, you're going to get way over a thousand a day,
and Cortis is going to be hanging this head like Tom Dooly,
but he's got that check coming, what do you got?
Nothing.
Well, that's because you don't do the website.
Well, I would, but you know, he won't give that up.
He what?
He won't give that up.
Well, what do you mean he won't give it up?
It's not for him to sigh.
In fact, remember Johnny mattress, it's not for me to say,
remember that?
Say it rhymes with gay.
The African Queen Johnny mattress.
He had a great voice, it just was tough to look at her.
Him, hit.
You know what I mean?
Oh, I do.
It's not for me to say.
What was that?
What's the name of that?
Oh, that's Chances R.
I don't have that.
What do you got?
You got any Johnny mattress?
The Tross of Never?
I got this.
That's when the equipment's going to work right at QA and the Tross of Never.
That's when the song's going to start.
What do you got?
I got a slow computer.
That's what I got.
I got no.
What will Mary say?
What will what?
What will Mary say?
Oh, come on.
Nobody.
What will my Mary say?
And, uh, you don't have changes, are you?
No, I'll have to get it on.
It's not for me to say.
I have this.
Or what about I've a Marie?
I guess I'm going to get cranked up.
I have this.
Yeah.
Keep it.
You don't know what this is?
No.
It's a duet with these volumes.
Oh, it's called without us.
And here's the theme song.
Nobody a very famous TV show that does.
I know that you love and watch everything episode up.
Family ties.
Oh, kill it.
Kill it.
1026 at 560 WQM.
Don't forget the jerk shows, Colin Pantue.
Don't say we didn't warn you.
I'm son of a bitch.
The last comic standing.
A political addition.
Please give a warm welcome to our first comic star in George Bush.
The story I like to tell about the preacher.
You're so...
Let me...
Hey, good joke as a point.
John McKay.
You look like the guy who enjoys getting into a hot tub
and watching his swim trumps inflate.
Brother, this guy stinks!
Hillary Clinton.
It is so great to be here.
You know, I was worried I wasn't going to make it.
Yeah, I was pinned down by sniper fire.
I thought I was funny.
You know, you guys keep telling me, like, love.
You're like Obama.
Hopefully, get some...
Bits, bots.
What do you expect?
Should I be at home making cookies?
Mawing.
And Dick Cheney.
We have Cheney's on both sides of the family.
And we don't even live in West Virginia.
You can say those things when you're not running for re-election.
Chokes kind of suck.
The last comic standing.
Political addition.
A central one.
NBC.
Okay, it's 1031.
You're right.
They all sucked.
1031.
A QIM.
Bill Sidel died.
George was bruntless about this when we came in.
That's right.
That's right.
You were.
And of course, I remember his commercials, but I never...
I never met him.
You did.
Yeah.
You hung out?
We hung out.
Right.
Maybe you could hang with Sodom.
How do I know?
Did you see who wrote the O-Bit?
No.
Eleanor Breffer.
Oh.
Eleanor Breffer.
Norma's good, buddy.
Ellie.
And you'll guess what?
Cardinal Bill Sidel dies.
Bill Sidel high school graduate of Parley Day.
Single dots in dealership into a seven-store auto sales empire.
Died unexpectedly is West in home.
Yesterday morning the causes and known it says in the hero.
Sidel 82 is getting ready for work like he does every morning and fell down in the bathroom and never got up.
Said granddaughter Jennifer Sidel.
Michael Sidel also was instead his father suffered from macular degeneration.
Oh, gee, it's bad that I played that fit to beginning the day that was bad.
Haven't played that in a hundred years.
Hey, you had no idea.
No, I did not.
Played again.
No, that would be in bad taste.
And had respiratory problems dating to his World War II combat service in the Navy.
He was wearing a patch over his left eye after cataract surgery on Monday.
Oh, he had cataract surgery on Monday and Tuesday he was dead, huh?
Wow.
His father loved cars said Michael, a family's company's vice president,
riding in them, working on them, restoring them.
Sidel sold Nissan's initially called Dazons.
Mitsubishi's Suzuki's in Hyundai's in South Florida and Chevy's at a dealership in the Orlando Suburboclermont.
Michael said his father liked cars from Japan and Korea because they weren't expensive and they were good on gas.
Bill Sidel knew how to weather his industry's boom and bust cycles.
This sunset he'd say it better be prepared for the downs.
You can't always expect every day to be stiller.
You have to work harder in the bad times.
That's right, just like us here at WDQA and man, these are the bad times.
These are the jolly jolly bell times.
We have to work 100 times as hard just to compensate for his ineptitude and bad attitude.
On the side, Sidel collected classic cars, about 20 of which reside in a Miami warehouse.
The sun said including a Nissan 240Z and a Ferrari from the 70s, a Model T and Model A forwards.
It was a very significant person in the South Florida Auto business that Bill Lehman and other South Florida car dealer and a friend.
Sidel had a good reputation Lehman said he was smart and got to ride franchises.
He came up to the junk business and built a strong organization just on the force of his personality.
He looks like an interesting guy of them, suspenders, you know.
Right, Mr. A regular old guy.
That's right, you would have known that he was a a millionaire.
What a wow.
Like me, right?
Looks like homeless.
When he was in a room everybody else kind of wilted.
He was very dynamic, bombastic, gruff, unpolished, but there was no kinder and gentler man.
Indeed, many a flea bit in the stray dog that wandered onto his 36th rely and ended up as pets, Michael Sidel said.
Not much junkyard dogs he cleaned up.
This has been going on for years.
William D. Sidel was born in Lawrence, mass grew up in Philadelphia where his father worked in the shipyards.
He was the 36 children and regularly vacationed in Miami.
After the war in November 46, Sidel married his childhood sweetheart, the former Betty sales.
They moved to South Florida where his her father had an auto junkyard and part store.
Sidel went into the business and started selling used cars.
In 1969, he opened the Dotson dealership by Northwest 36th Street.
Over time, he bought several more properties on the street, open additional dealerships.
A stretch of the street at Northwest 32nd Avenue was named in his honor.
In 2000, the company expanded to...
Where were you?
Richard Baker, president of the South Florida Auto Truck dealers' association at Trade Group representing 200 dealerships said Sidel was an active member of one of the core group of dealers who were very instrumental in meeting the needs of the industry.
He stood behind his products and treated the consumer fairly, Baker said.
He was part of the history of the Miami Carb and as you don't find a better guy.
Sidel served as US federal trustee in the bankruptcy courts of the Southern District Courts of Florida, was a member of the Mahi Shrine for 50 years.
What is that?
I don't know.
The Mahi Shrine.
He sponsored charity golf tournaments, was active in community groups that cared for veterans, the homeless and the hungry.
His model was just to fire your existence, granddaughter Jennifer said, and he lived up to it.
In addition, his wife and son Michael Bill Sidel survived by his son Robert, who runs the Cermont dealership and brother Joe Sidel at Lanna.
The family in... instead of flowers, the family requests donations to the American Long Association of Florida.
Well, that's a shame. He was... having surgery, cataract surgery on Monday and then Tuesday just to collapse in the bedroom and croaked.
It was a good guy. He was a pit.
Well, that's a shame. I would sue those people who ever did that cataract. Maybe they would have them for millions, wouldn't you?
Sure.
I'd sue their fat ass.
Big time.
Bossuit!
But that's...
That's life and death.
800-5 votes on a pool of garbage and Chris is just crowing like a peacock.
Oh yeah.
Well, you're gonna go way over a thousand. There's no doubt about that.
All the week, we assumed that yesterday two of them once the audience realized that Curtis was on in your place, then they kind of backed away a little bit.
Oh well.
It looked like it was a foregone contusion that we're gonna get to thousand and it got really hairy toward the end of the show.
And I gave up. I said, oh, you're not gonna make it. Maybe Eric just stopped letting the votes go through.
And maybe Eric had his foot on the brake because I think Eric probably hates Josh.
Because they got that thing going, you know, about those bedtime stories.
Because every now and then with Josh, he's on one of his all-night drunks and getting laid and all this other crap.
The stories don't, you know, exactly always get on. Especially like on a weekend, you know.
When he's on an all-night drunk.
Not that Josh Curtis would be doing like that.
So what did he say before?
What were you talking about about people touching his things?
Monitors.
Oh, people touch your computer monitor.
And you have to say WTFH.
Why are you doing that?
And then they eat home.
And then they go, what? What? What's in that attitude?
I don't, you know, you're always telling me about all the bad company I keep, etc.
But I don't have anybody that ever touches my monitor. It gets even close enough to touch it.
They might look at it.
But they don't touch it.
I don't think I've ever accused anyone that you know being a monitor toucher or going into your studio or anything like that.
Oh yeah, Paco comes in and wants to mount him out.
I want to look something up on the net.
I'll never accuse them of being a monitor toucher.
No, he never touched it.
And the monitor either.
Now if we want to look something up, like find a yacht to rent for his birthday party.
Oh boy.
What?
I just was giving an example.
A generic example.
I didn't say that was going to happen even though of course it is.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing.
Are you starting against him?
I didn't live my life.
I didn't spend my money on how to do my duty.
No, whatever.
I've done my duty.
So you had to be a smart and a smart person.
Notice I did a really good job too.
Fast, effective, bomb, fast, I might just have another one inside of me.
Exstatic?
Spastic.
812 votes, my God.
Now this is pretty, and then I say I said this was a good pull.
Yes, and it is.
You want to know the pull, but you already know it.
The most depressing movie ever made.
I'm bringing that one back for tomorrow.
I'm not going to switch it though until we get to a thousand on the first one.
Although we could, it's all up to Fat Chris.
Think about it during the break.
I'm going to go out and do another choice.
And this one I'm taking my time.
I might take like two minutes on this one.
Okay.
Well, I think it builds a little bit of suspense.
I know I'm building some pressure on the inside.
But it builds a little suspense.
The audience is going to be just calling everybody they know.
Two men when the break is over and see if Fatso gets back.
Or maybe if he falls in the bowl and the other, maybe if he flushes himself down,
then he won't have to retire.
Like I heard that.
This is the one who's the sport of the 560 QA.
We're the sports leader.
That's the honey, Junior.
Friends, help elect Barack Obama, the next president of the United States.
Today, as I suspend my campaign, I congratulate him.
On the victory he has won and the extraordinary race he has run.
Now on a personal note, I'm going to keep doing what I was doing.
Long before the cameras ever showed up,
working to give every American terrorism and global loans.
You know, we all want an America,
to can't afford gas or groceries or college.
So I want to say to my supporters,
when you hear people saying or think to yourself,
to save for college a home and retirement don't go there.
And I want the same for all Americans.
The stall and slip backwards.
To build that future I see,
we must make sure that women and men alike.
falter.
And I want to build an America that respects and embraces the poverty and genocide.
There is nothing more American than that.
Thank you all and God bless you and God bless you.
God bless America.
Thank you.
God bless America. It's 10.45 at 5.60 W.A.M.
I change the poll by the way,
while you were looking, Chris.
Oh, yeah.
Come on, you're guaranteed over 1000.
You already were guaranteed it 822 vote on the first one for Christ's sake.
All right.
Now we got the new one on there.
Virginia Congressman says the FBI has found that four of his government computers have been hacked
by sources working out of China.
And remarks prepared for delivery of this afternoon, representative Frank Wolfe.
Don't you hate people that say wolf?
Yes.
They can't say wolf, so they say wolf.
Frank Wolfe.
Can't stand there.
Why do people, I guess because they're dumb.
Yes.
Says he's been told by the FBI that four computers in his personal office were compromised.
By the way, since Chris is so down on slot machines,
let me just give you two words, okay?
Quick hit.
Yesterday afternoon, I met Woodbine.
I'm, I'm, I'm, we're getting lucky to get started with that wheel of fortune crap.
They're really bad.
They don't pay.
I'm losing my ass.
I finally said this blows, this sucks.
And I got up and I went into back to the quick hit.
You following this?
Mm-hmm.
I sat down at one machine.
I put in 60 bucks.
I hit it a few times.
I would, one 500 and two bucks.
The light is flashing, waiting for the attendant to finally show her ass up.
And while I'm waiting, so the machine next to me to my right is open.
I stick 40 bucks in there.
I hit it a couple of times.
Bing, Bing, Bing, Bing, I get seven quick hits.
1370 bucks.
You following that?
Not bad.
A total of almost 1900 right there.
Not too shabby.
Then, like in India, I went and had little dinner, sucked.
The food there blows.
I went back to be able to fortune like I'm moron.
I need to be shot for doing that.
And lose a little moron.
So I went back again to quick hit one last time before I hopped in my vet and came home.
640 bucks.
Chris.
Uh-huh.
Not bad, huh?
Very good.
Quick hit.
The Virginia B. Publican, that's Frank Wolf, says that similar incidents also originating from trying to take place on computers.
Of other members of Congress and at least one House Committee.
A spokesman for Wolf says the whole computer isn't being used by staff members working on human rights issues.
Wolf is a long time critic of the Chinese government's human rights record.
And since the dogs in China, maybe it's appropriate that we call them Wolf.
What do you think?
Maybe?
To the way that it fits together?
Uh-huh.
Not even mentioning it.
Just like that terrible bit I've played about macaroni degeneration at the beginning of the show,
you should have warned me.
Don't play that.
You're insensitive.
You'll silently have right.
That's right. Start up now with that crap.
You're stupid, you're insensitive.
That's right.
An old fool.
All of these things.
You're right.
So here's the final tally on your, uh, who is the funniest supporting sitcom character or duo?
See that, that business about having George and Louise Jefferson together.
And that, that's just stupid.
And what about, uh, there's so many other good ones too.
What about the, uh, all the other people on the Jefferson's?
Yeah.
What was that guy with the big nose that British guy, the next door neighbor?
Mr. Uh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Bentley.
Bentley?
Yeah, he was great.
He was great.
And what about the other neighbor's, the interracial couple?
The willesses.
The willesses is right.
And what, what did she, uh...
What did she sing?
Uh...
Or right?
Or he heard that she was the singer of one of these things, but she's Lenny Kravitz's mom.
Oh, that's right.
And that we do not forgive.
I agree with that.
Wholeheartedly.
By the way, aren't you proud of me?
I went, I did a double-duster song.
Wow.
Double-duse, it's the double-dutch bus.
It's a cramer from Seinfeld 138.
Bernie 591.
George from Seinfeld 63.
I don't want to read all these.
Do I have to?
I don't want to.
I don't want to.
There are too many stupid things on here.
Frazier.
Oh.
I mean, just like the norm at Lenny and Squeezy from Laverne and Squirley.
Oh my God.
What is wrong with some of you people for Christ's sakes?
And Chias?
Chias.
But, I guess it was a bad pull.
I thought it was a good one.
There was to share.
What do I know?
And if you think there were a lot of names on that pull, wait till the one that's on there now.
I got the one for tomorrow.
In fact, it should have been the one for the new one for today.
Which talentless child of privilege capitalized best on his or her family's fame and fortune.
And the first one that this listener put on list was Joel Feinberg, to which I would say,
absolutely correct.
Good choice.
Oh, what's your name?
Walona from Good Time saying the Jefferson song.
Says Brandon.
Walona?
Yeah.
She sang the Jefferson song.
Okay, there you go.
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.
You know.
Oh, that's not the one.
No.
That's the one.
You were going to get a good time.
You were going to get a horrible one.
What?
The good time?
The good time is a horrible song.
No, that's not a horrible one.
It's a great one.
I'm going to make me dig it out again.
I can play it.
Don't do it.
Bad.
Okay, here's the new pull.
What was the most...
And by the way, the phones are working.
We can take a million calls today if we had some.
WQAM, hello.
Why George the Scrette to come out of...
Okay, here's the pull.
What was the most depressing movie ever made?
Get back on a banana boat and go back where it came from.
Go back to Guatemala, you idiot.
Fifteen votes.
1984 or two.
Old Yeller 2.
The Dear Hunter 1.
The Grey Zone 1.
Death and Venice 1.
Oh, that was so depressing.
Did you ever see that?
He just sat there and he kept leering at that young boy.
What was that?
I know it was...
Yeah, that, but I mean.
Remember that?
Nope.
Oh, you didn't see it.
Good.
What was that one with Elizabeth Taylor?
And Montgomery Clip.
Right, that one's like all I've had with the...
Oh, my God.
The Black and White one.
Very, very gay with the kids' Aiden.
With the kids' Aiden.
At the end of the movie, the animals.
The kids are turning the animals and the Aiden.
Well, I guess it was, you know, payback as a bitch.
Like Peter Marshall used to say in Hollywood Square,
turn about his fair play.
I hated when he said that.
Turn about his fair play.
When the X would get the O and the O would get the X.
It was called...
Something.
Right.
And we'll find it.
Is it on here?
Maybe it's on the list.
Cooquas Nest One, Volly One, Ryan Song One.
Oh, my God.
Talk about the...
Mystic River One, Ordinary Pipple One.
Looking for Mr. Goodbar One.
Romeo and Juliet.
That's what I voted.
One.
Midnight Express One.
No, none yet.
Four holes.
A million other ones.
Yet.
Now, you want to know why I voted for Romeo and Juliet?
Why?
Oh, because it was tragic for you.
Because London Whiting died.
That's exactly right.
Good guess.
But that Georgia Sharp is a Motsubal man.
Mm-hmm.
When London Whiting died in the end, my little piece of me died.
I didn't really die, you know.
I know. It was just a movie.
But never left.
Right.
Well, when River Phenus died, he did die.
Yeah.
That's right.
I was more and more enchanted with Leonard Whiting.
Or good choice.
He was even prettier than she was.
I remember who played the Juliet in that movie.
Olivia Hussie.
Olivia Hussie.
That's right.
Wonder if she's kind of Charlie Hussie, the jocky from Calder 100 years ago.
I hate it.
Maybe the same person.
She was much lighter, more complex than Charlie Hussie.
Probably had bigger cans.
I doubted.
Well, I'm thinking about jocky's man.
I mean, I must have real tiny ass, you know.
Mm-hmm.
Your ass must weigh about an ounce.
How'd you like to have to go through a life like that?
I mean, I was fat people like me and Chris.
You know, it's bad enough like this morning.
I weighed 191.
That's not good.
Not bad, but not good.
And you go through a life worrying about losing 40, 50 pounds.
How would you like to have to be like 115 pounds of your life?
For 110 or whatever it is.
I would get it.
Like little, like short like that?
No jockies.
Yeah.
I mean, don't you understand the way through?
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, it's a part of the job.
The course racing shows that we've done.
And since now you're an expert on why big brown.
And you're so bad in the Belmont, and you're given all these stories about drugs and people cashing.
That's it.
And all these crooked, bad hugs.
That's it.
Anywhere there's money involved.
Anywhere.
There's always the potential for, as they say, and I don't know why, skull buggery.
Schenervigants.
That's right.
Mm-hmm.
Always the possibility.
Mm-hmm.
And the probability.
And I understand why I'm not hearing any more about it.
I've been searching for articles on...
Shut up.
That's why I'm...
Oh, I see.
Yeah.
Okay.
Mm-hmm.
Anyway, Leonard White, I thought, was extraordinarily beautiful young man.
I thought, mm-hmm.
He was so pretty.
But anyway, that's very gay.
It's a good movie, though.
Very well-done.
It's a great movie.
Shakespeare doesn't translate well into movies, but they did a good job in that.
They did a really good job.
I would like to have done a good job, but that's the side of the point.
I'm Leonard White, and start playing that music now.
Oh, yeah?
Get me nostalgic for that.
By Franity and Tite here.
The Romeo and Juliet theme.
If you've got the Romeo and Juliet theme by Franity and Tite here, then you're going to send Chris and Chick for fun.
There it is.
So now that's a good song.
Mm-hmm.
And Sam, it's he pressing just like, oh yeah, he has his own stuff.
Sam, I know.
Both versions of it.
I have it.
And then you see that in bed, and you can do it.
Yes.
Yes.
He's on his ass.
They showed us that movie in school.
And when they...
He's so Leonard White, he's ass.
When he gets up to watch the window and his white ass is hanging out there.
Yeah.
Everybody lost it.
Everybody chored it.
Oh, yeah.
What about if his junk was hanging out?
Solid lips of her boots.
And it's like a memory.
Yeah, I'm crying.
He came out young, got the bull.
I'm going to get all the things.
And then we have all the versions of this.
So, you know, Johnny Madness did a version of this.
I was going to change the lyrics, yeah.
What did he call it?
Chances, I don't know.
Chances?
Anyway, that's depressing.
Yes.
No votes yet for ghost Chinatowns, Flander and the Grass, Flander and the Grass, Charlie.
Oh, Charlie was said.
Yeah, it was.
The foe of what was sitting in Robertson.
That's right.
Good movie, very sad.
A great movie.
All mine to give, Blade Runner, Raging Bolshmit, Deep Impact, Running on Empty.
Bar fly, Jungle Fever, Dancer and the...
Dancer and the Dark?
Yeah.
Depressing is all hell.
Bjork.
Bridges of Madison County, the Champ, Hockey Talk Man.
What's that movie with Liz Taylor?
Google Liz Taylor, you'll find the movie.
But you'll find it Google Montever, yeah.
A couple weeks ago.
And they chased him down me in the movie and they ate him.
Yep.
Sleeper.
Oh, come here.
Oh, glory Sunday.
It's not really called Sunday, Bloody Sunday.
With Peter Fincher was great.
Was gay.
Under the volcano, once upon a time in America, was great.
But if you got 40 hours to watch, talk radio, it was sad because they made it.
Murder in the first.
The planet pianist, leaving last night.
There's too many to read.
There's four hires.
Like every movie it's ever made on this pool.
I like that.
Did you look at Google Liz Taylor?
Doing it now.
She's got, you know, a whole new year.
I hope 40,000 movies.
Maybe during the breakout, Google it and I'll find it before you do.
Suddenly last summer.
Hmm, it's something like that.
But I don't find it.
It just came to me.
I'm sure that's it.
Suddenly last summer.
Are you doubting my word about some Fag movie with a 8-to-guiney end?
The biggest name.
A film set.
I leave it on the feet of the rocket.
4.560 km.
The sports leader.
This is the Neil Rogers show.
The watch doll is the new train.
The watch doll is the new train.
Any questions?
Imagine, I'm an ice cream.
What did Ben and Chevy do?
They made me an ice cream.
A tasty treat for you.
Imagine, I'm an ice cream.
That's why I turn on a tool.
I'm not an un-nation dairy creamer.
That would be a fitting tribute to you.
I hope someday you'll enjoy me.
Who's that B-1?
B-3rd, man.
11.0205.60 WDQ AM.
I looked up Leonard Whiteing.
I grew up in the middle of the summer.
Is the name of that movie?
Sorry.
Really?
Yes.
You didn't find it?
I found it.
It's suddenly less summer.
Tennessee Williams shocks you again as he transports you to a strange new bowl world.
Kind of gay.
The only son of a wealthy widow, Viad Venable dies while I'm under.
She's kind to Floyd Venable Jr.
Oh, yeah, I grew up with E.Y.P.
So many morons and so little time.
The only son of wealthy widow, Viad Venable dies while I'm vacation with his cousin, Catherine.
What the girl saw was so horrible that she went insane.
Now Mrs. Venable wants Catherine lobotomized to cover up the truth.
That's what it's all about.
They're trying to give her lobotomaymy.
Or we got some requests for Sophie's choice.
Okay.
Get that on there and also suddenly last summer.
Horrible, horrible, bad movie with a sad movie.
I already put that last one on there.
Did you?
Yes.
Well, that's because you're trying to goose to get that thousand votes.
You only got a 22 from the first boy and you get 178 on this one.
Fat chance.
Ah, a piece of cake.
No problem.
I'm getting choked up about Leonard Whiteing.
Because they acted the picture that I found actually was from the 1968 version of Romeo and Juliet.
And if we move quickly as somebody would say, we can send a birthday card.
June 30th will be Leonard Whiteing's birthday.
You know what year he was born?
No.
1950.
Okay.
So that means in 1968 when it made Romeo and Juliet, he was 18.
Legal, but just barely.
Although I don't know if it was maybe they made it early in 1968.
Barely legal.
Barely legal.
That tender young butt.
He was pretty.
What?
He was pretty young man.
In fact, I'm thinking that would be a great pull.
We get no votes because the audience are heterosexual male audience would vomit from it.
But who was the, how do we, how do we, how do we phrase it?
What?
Who is the girliest looking male actor?
Young male actor.
Not the earliest looking.
He wasn't girly looking.
He was pretty, but that don't make him girly looking.
I had a party in my own.
Yeah.
He sure did.
It was wide open and it's picture too.
What kind of open?
He was acting.
He was nearly almost like the shag.
No, that's not the pull, okay?
I mean, this is from 100 years ago we're talking about Robert Wagner, was pretty.
And Brandon DeWilda was real pretty.
And what was the movie?
All fall down.
But our audience would give, and Leonard Whiteing.
And what's his name?
From Flipper.
Luke Halpin.
Okay.
Luke.
Sandy.
Sandy.
Hey, Luke.
He might be listening out there, old Luke.
He's still, maybe he's still around, maybe not.
That was on Zeta.
That was 21 years ago.
You imagine how old he is now?
What he looks like?
Oh my God.
It's always good when you don't see people, celebrities you haven't seen like in a zillion years.
Because when you do see him, you think, oh holy crap.
Look at that.
You know what I mean?
Yes, I did.
They don't look good.
People who are really voluptuous, really smordering when they were young.
And then like, you know, 40, 50 years later they're old parts.
And you look, oh jeez, what happened?
Like some of the people from those sitcoms, from the, you know, like, like a watcher call.
Leave it to be, or.
Yeah.
Like that.
Like Wally.
Like Wally.
With those little belts, those little plastic belts.
I always noticed that because I was always looking at his crotch.
But anyway, never saw anything.
What was the most depressing movie ever made?
It's a good poll.
Perfect for QAM.
64 votes already.
Chris is celebrating.
Because you got almost 900 votes.
Not even, it's just barely after 11 o'clock.
All right.
Brian Song, 10.
Wasn't James Con in that movie?
Yes.
And who was the black guy that played, what's his name?
Gilles Sears.
I don't know.
I mean, Brian, what's his name?
What was his name?
Piccolo?
Brian Piccolo.
Very good.
Oh my God.
I used to live by Brian Piccolo Park.
Did you?
Yes.
That's where that, the Piccolo.
Mike and Shuse on that story, I'm trying to remember who was the died.
Brian Piccolo.
He wasn't black.
Was he?
No, that would be James Con, played him in the movie.
Billy DeBoliams played Gilles Sears.
Oh, that's it.
Oh, and you just go early.
You're cheating.
No, I am.
You beat it.
Well, whatever.
It's the same difference.
You went online and got here.
I never saw this movie, so.
You didn't?
Well, if you want to get really depressed, if you want to blow your brains out.
That's what I'm going to go.
Huh?
When I do that, I just go to my paycheck.
Oh, yeah.
Just, in fact, on payday, watch Brian Song.
You look at the stuff from your paycheck and then watch that movie.
Then it'll put you over the edge.
You don't like me, do you?
Why do you say such things?
Well, you're trying to get me to feel really, really bad.
No, I'm not trying to kill myself.
Not really, really bad.
Just really bad.
Not really.
Not really.
No, you got to cry.
Look at that.
Yes, I'm crying over the big help.
No, it's not.
I'm crying about Leonard Whiting.
I'll take it that.
Who?
Well, what were you know about Romeo and Juliet?
You're just a big fat old, a turd.
You're not into those romantic kind of movies like that.
Correct.
Let's play for Eddie and Titerin.
Romeo and Juliet theme all summer long.
Okay, I'm going to download every version of it.
No, I like that one.
Was that a good one?
No, it was the Henry Man's Teeny one, but it's just instrumental.
Oh, it's Henry Man's Teeny.
I'm going to get a copy, yes.
I'm going to get a copy of the version that they sing in the movie.
Remember when they're at the party?
No.
And they, they're at the dance floor.
Are you going to be at a random party?
Right at the beginning of the movie.
It starts out.
They go to the door and go party.
Remember and crap.
That's right.
There you go.
They're playing cat and mouse flirting with each other.
And they clear the floor and the guy comes out and sings that song.
Was that a ball-headed mouse that I saw in that movie?
No.
Oh, it was a ball-to-roll.
That was praying for it.
It was eagle eye.
Hey Leonard.
Let's see your junk Leonard.
I don't think in the days of Romeo and Juliet they were talking about junk.
Maybe he'd like to dunk his...
Okay, here's one for the, it says,
Hi the Razer Blades movie, My Life with Michael Keaton and Nicole Kidman.
Never seen it.
Got it on there?
Good.
My Life.
My Life with Michael Keaton and Nicole Kidman.
Just affected two of them aren't it's enough to get me a...
Send me to the bowl, I'll tell you.
So there's a Hi the Razer Blades movie.
Yeah, a lot of the depressing movies.
It'll get you really all choked up and get you all teared up.
I'm going to go out and get me Romeo and Juliet.
Okay, I'm going to go get the DVD.
It's a good movie.
It is a good movie.
I had a lot of comedy.
You didn't even have to understand what they were saying to get what was going on.
They did such a good job.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
You know that Shakespearean English, you can understand that.
Romeo and Julietta.
See.
Late yes and late Monday excuse me, Duluth Police, Duluth Georgian, I'm an Asona.
Duluth Georgia Police were investigating reports of a Molotov cocktail
that had been ignited in a Korean radio station.
A Corrinda Police, Hong Che, whom they described as a disgruntled former employee of 1080 AM
and Atlanta Radio Korea, walked into the offices on Duluth Park Lane at 330 Monday afternoon
with what investigators said was an incendiary device, Una Bamba.
Una Bamba Grande.
Investigators said Che ignited the devices he walked into the offices, resulting in severe burns.
They said a second man was burned less severely.
Both men were taken to Quinnett Medical Center in Duluth, which must be a suburb of Atlanta.
I wonder if Bob Neal, a little Bob Neal, he should have gotten Una Bamba in his mailbox.
I was thinking about him yesterday, I was sitting there at that wheel of fortune,
losing before I finally came to my senses.
And thinking about Bob Neal in the grotesque way that they dismissed all of us,
remember when they sold IOD?
Remember that?
Yep.
Just absolutely unacceptable.
Well, we tried everything to make money with you guys and with this format,
but we can maybe be taxing into it.
In other words, you guys suck and we're delighted to be dumping your ass.
Bob Neal, somebody should have stepped on his ass a long time ago.
You could have stepped on him, that's how short he is.
Yes.
Come up to your knee.
And they head shaped like holding a dead fish.
Yeah, a cold dead fish.
Mm-hmm.
Holy mackerel.
Mm-hmm.
Although in his case, dead mackerel.
I wonder if Leonard Whiting has got a dead mackerel.
Well, maybe by now, how old is he?
58.
June 30th, he'll be 58.
And I bet you he looks like hell on two legs.
51-year-old Che was later booked in the Gwyneth County Jailies charge
with two cons of possession of a destructive device and one kind of first to be arson.
Police said Che was a recently fired salesman.
Oh, yeah.
Well, how do you like that?
Is that start to put this in better perspective?
Is ails people are ails.
Amen.
A recently fired sales hole.
Hong Che, my ass.
A former employee entered in the business and set off the device.
We believe to be a Molotov cocktail.
So Captain Tommy Rudlidge of the Gwyneth County Fire Department.
Slow down, relax.
Trying to read this too fast.
Too much reading won't take all those great calls for a crank out loud.
What's wrong with me?
QAM, hello.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry about Neil.
Is that no?
Yeah, about Neil with a bad pony voice, yeah.
Hey, Jar, that was your buddy.
I know.
We know everybody knows.
Everybody's on to you, Schmuck.
Everybody knows you.
He doesn't.
Bad.
Felt what?
He doesn't care.
He gets off just to say.
Oh, I see.
There's not a motive at this point that says,
what leads it's part of the ongoing investigation.
All we can say at this point is that the perpetrator is a former sales hole of the business.
The suspect that a man who tried to stop were both burned.
The strange attack has left the Lutz Korean community startled.
I don't know about Koreans.
I don't think I ever seen that many Korean.
I'm sure we have a lot of them here.
They're just fine.
We have a lot of every.
What?
They're just fine.
I'm talking about how they look.
They're put on top of the house.
Oh, really?
I don't know about that.
I know that those Asians, man, there's so many really talk about Leonard Whiting.
Forget about him.
So many really beautiful Asian people.
I mean, beautiful, smooth, just, oh.
And obviously with all the babies they're making in China, they must be pretty horny.
They must be screwing their brains out.
Mm-hmm.
I still wonder how that, you know, I don't want to get too graphic or anything like that.
Yeah, well.
When you got a button mushroom, it's supposed to be.
I guess it must be just enough.
That's right.
Just enough to get the giant D-Octon.
Just got to get it with the threshold.
Like when you flush the turret, you know?
That's right.
And there's a certain threshold back there and hopefully everything here gets passed right.
Over the limit.
Over the limit.
The NBA Final starts in.
It's like a blast from the past match up as the Lakers take on the selling.
It's been 21 years since these two squared off.
Kobe and Kevin.
Kobe and Kevin.
In a battle for the best of seven, this will end the mystery of who's the greatest demon history.
Kobe and Kevin.
Kobe and Kevin.
Basta and I always feel like they're in heaven.
I always feel like they're in heaven.
I always feel like they're in heaven.
I always feel like they're in heaven.
I always feel like they're in heaven.
I always feel like they're in heaven.
I always feel like they're in heaven.
I always feel like they're in heaven.
On a scale of 10, they rate an 11 this will end the mystery of who's the greatest.
Who's the greatest.
Who's the greatest demon history.
The most historic robbery and the provasional ball.
Oh yeah, Kobe and Kevin.
I'll scale of 10, they rate a...
Oh!
But that's another story.
11, 18, and 5, 60 WQM.
This shows a little bit too late for everybody's liking today.
Let's get it back on the head of Rowa.
Let's get George on here.
Here's George.
Hey, how you doing, everybody?
I was talking a whole bunch of calls right now, but it's dead as a door now.
That's all right.
No, it's not all right.
I'll be angst in the grief that we've gone through.
Are there dots?
Are there no dots?
Well, what's dot?
Hey Leonard, what's dot?
I know what dot used to be, but probably no more.
And I can't fight a biography of him.
It says, no bio post the first bio.
I bet you're on IMD beetle, be there.
We're gonna be...
We're gonna be...
You think?
Probably.
That we're gonna be a...
We're gonna be a...
We're gonna be a...
We're gonna be a...
We're gonna be a...
We're gonna be a...
And they...
What do they do with?
I don't understand the question.
You can do anything.
How do they create these things?
How do I mean software?
Software.
The right software.
The right software.
That's what Eric does.
Yeah.
Eric writes software?
Yes, he does.
In between visits to the parliament house?
WDQAM, hello.
Hey Neil, how you doing?
Okay.
It's gonna let you know Kelly Craig is a hottie.
WDQAM, hello.
Hello?
Yes.
We're...
We're...
We're...
We're...
We're...
We're...
We're...
We're...
We're...
We're...
We're...
We're...
We're...
I have no life.
WDQAM, hello.
Hi, you Glenn and Miramar chicken.
I have no life.
Yeah, we know that.
I'm a guy.
Die with your death.
Go shoot your death.
That's the idiot.
Another stalker.
Another moron.
I wonder how those guys...
Remember the guy called yesterday said that they were coming to fly up to Buffalo to save money?
That's pretty stupid.
Yeah.
And they're coming up to the Blue Jays game, which is gonna be starting soon.
I wonder what their deal is.
And then he said, maybe you'll see me at Woodbine later.
Maybe today they'd be a good day to lay out.
I can't go every day.
I'm at Kud, but I don't want to.
Because then if I go every day, then somebody will say,
Oh, and you've got a compulsive gambling problem.
You better check into GA or something like that.
You better contact me, foe.
Speaking of contacting people, how come you never called Bob Green?
You were the one that was gonna call him after he gave me his phone.
Yeah.
But you kept it because you told me he's got a lot of money now,
and you want to find some scam with him.
Yeah, that's what.
I guess you forgot that he told me.
I'll take care of George.
I'll tell you how he took care of you.
Oh, I didn't forget that.
I need you to lie.
WQA in Hello.
It puts you in the middle of the room.
WQA in Hello.
Ahhhhhhhhhh.
QA in Hello.
The Gua-Anne in Canada.
WQA in Hello.
How come that didn't work?
That's scary.
QA in Hello.
Good morning, Neil.
Good morning.
How are you?
I'm good.
For the poll, American Beauty, I don't notice it.
Yeah.
Anyway.
Pretty depressing film.
Any other thing is how come, even on your bedtime stories,
I don't see the articles on the pagement,
the little Dennis Kissinich brought against...
It was down there yesterday.
It was.
Yeah.
I missed it.
Okay.
Very good.
And I'm sure there's another story on it today, and maybe not.
But the depth of the media, I actually see it nowhere else.
And of course, we were talking about the last night
and making fun of it, and it's not gonna go anywhere.
It's not because the Democrats are a bunch of chicken schmitz,
so that's, forget about it.
Yeah, but the deal is we got it.
I don't know what happened to rule on it.
The deal is it isn't going to happen, sir.
It should have happened a long time ago,
but the Democrats don't have the will.
The Obama people don't want to touch it with an 80-foot poll
and Nancy Pelosi and the Harry Reid
between the two of them haven't got them none.
I agree.
Well, it's about this.
And that's right.
Well, say, he finally catched it on.
I mean, you people don't want to beat a dead horse.
You know, hit him again like a big brown.
Maybe he'll start running.
I doubt it.
Nothing worth beating a dead piece.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60.
Reading this poll, that would take us till midnight, at least.
There's just a million movies on there today.
If you want to get depressed, go to your favorite movie store.
Pick up a few DVDs.
Just take this list with you.
Right.
Old Yeller.
Oh, my.
What about a little baby?
What, had a good ending?
It did?
Yeah.
What dinner?
No.
I don't remember.
It's a million years ago.
What about Lassie come home?
I don't remember that.
Here, girl.
Here, girl.
Come on, Lassie.
And of course, Lassie was supposed to be a girl, and Lassie was a guy.
Where's the other way around?
Lassie's supposed to be a girl, but was usually played by boys.
Really?
Lassie means girl.
Huh.
Bambi, oh, it's on her.
It's got two votes.
See that?
That's what happens.
When you've got 40,000, remember I'm supposed to know all of them.
Oh, yeah.
Branded's got two for the poll.
Okay, let's hear them.
Lay it on us.
What's eating Gilbert Grape and Mask?
You see either one of those?
Mask.
That was with Cher, right?
Right.
The nearest old person.
Very depressing.
True story.
Very depressing.
How about the guy with the elephant face or something?
That's correct.
And what's eating Gilbert Grape?
Johnny Depp.
Johnny Depp is eating Gilbert Grape.
What's your like to see that?
Last time I checked.
I know exactly what's eating Gilbert.
I need some accent.
That's how it grapes.
Well, thank God he didn't show up on that Saturday.
You know what?
Yeah.
That's too bad.
Yeah, he could have stood off in a corner and cried.
Oh, you're not paying attention to me.
Yeah.
That was Cher another one of those great moves by Rick Riley.
You know, and Alex Beddard did the same thing.
Remember that?
Everybody tried to pick up Gilbert.
They pick up your trash.
They root through your dumpster.
All of the discards from the New York Rouges show they try to pick up and make a...
Like a holy Joe.
I remember when Craig Worthing picked up Holy Joe on a street corner.
When Craig had bad eyesight.
WDQ-A-N.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Well, Bob-R is going to be the...
WDQ-A-N.
Hello.
It was me, Brown-Bowl-Luvit.
Q-A-N, hello.
Yeah, you got to give her the jersey.
She's so boring.
Q-A-N, hello.
Bob-R.
Yo.
Hello.
Yeah, me-O.
Yeah.
This is Lorenzo.
How are you?
It's who?
Lorenzo.
Who's that?
That's me.
As a courier about that, the constancy thing.
I know you have to be repaid up about it.
But...
About what?
About the constancy situation.
Confetti?
So, I mean, I'm...
Confetti, just 35 at the...
Counts and states.
Yeah, right.
The impeachment.
I think that'd be great for a future poll, even tomorrow.
I don't know if they voted on it.
You have to be supposed to vote on it today.
They're not voting on impeachment.
They're voting on whether to send to the Judiciary Committee where it's going to die.
And he's our...
Who said it's already agreed to let it die there.
It's not going to come to a vote.
On impeachment.
I tell you, it's got the politicians really...
They're not doing the constitutional duty by...
My old kidding.
Well, thanks for the bulletin'.
In the case of...
Thank you so much.
Thanks for the bulletin'.
I mean, some of you people out there wake up and sniff the daffodils already.
Would you please?
Good God.
Talk about flogging a dead horse.
Is ass.
Jesus, God.
We could spend the rest of the week giving you 85,000 reasons why poor little Dennis Kusin
is with all the right right intentions and Bobby Wicksler, a good guy that he is, he's signed on
and corresponds to the resolution.
That's great.
It's not going to happen.
Isn't going to happen.
Oh, Jesus.
And of course, it's already the 11th of June.
Don't you think it's just a little bit late now to be starting to worry about beginning
impeachment hearings against these Nazis, these Neocons?
Yes.
Yes.
I mean, I'm talking about important stuff like Leonard Whiting and Romeo and Juliet
and they're talking about Dennis Kusin.
Jesus, we're getting serious.
Yes, you're the best talent.
You're the real largest sport in the 560 QAM.
You're the real sports leader.
Real Rogers God.
Stay waiting.
Yeah, I'm wearing a wrap for a New York setting.
Hello, did you also count me?
It's a quality for all of us.
What are you doing here?
Why, maybe in the CIA, the FBI.
I'm from Canazi.
A frontman had two sleepless days down when the campions.
I came here for the vote of every American.
A famous dynamic.
And then out of which black male.
Woo!
You were big in the Democrats,
I saw with the election away.
Ah, shut your mouth.
I'm not going to shed my mouth that you are.
You are too much.
I should be more forced that I should get my phone right.
That's not my America.
You got a wrinkle there.
I was a second class citizen before now.
I'm not the daughter.
You're a white-glass bitch.
I'm a Democratic party through once down the tubes.
You mind your car keys?
And they are able to won't turn and bump from a chain.
Why, but those four of you.
McCain, don't be the next president of the United States.
I would never still my seat in you.
It's 1131, what a thought at 5.60 WTQAM.
On Monday evening, this is for those old parts out there
who continue trying to beat that dead horse in the fog.
On Monday evening, Representative Dennis Gocinic sir
to the floor of the House of Representatives
to read out 35 articles of impeachment against President Bush
in almost five-hour marathon.
Gocinic sir's action made an immediate splash on the Internet.
For example, at progressive website Democratic Underground,
the historic performance quickly garnered an astonishing
56 separate threads on the most recommended list.
By noon yesterday, raw stories article on the subject
was the top political story of the day at dig.com
and the 10th most popular for the last year.
A separate article at afterdowningstreet.org was also high in the ratings.
Both sites as well as Cocinic's own web page were experiencing slowdowns
due to the volume of traffic.
However, the mainstream media were far more reticent
in their coverage of Cocinic resolution,
much as they were following the release last week of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report
on the administration's misuse of pre-war intelligence.
For example, Washington Post and USA today had short items in their blog sections,
while other major outlets merely ran wire service coverage from APR Reuters.
Who sentenced supporter John Kassumi responded angrily about that news,
writing, the most important thing going happened on Monday night,
an event that matters greatly to the course of history
and to all Americans who do you hear about it?
On ABC, CBS, NBC, did they break in a normal programming with special coverage?
Are there special alerts and bulletins on the cable news networks where people can see them?
No, no, and...
No!
No!
NewsHounds was equally skating, saying,
so what if they impeached the president?
Nobody rejected reported it.
As the 3am Eastern Daylight Time, the GD-Libber media's largely silent,
a dentist could finish his introduction of articles of impeachment on the floor of the house.
Are they afraid of getting it wrong?
Just reported it as this rostery, no matter what you think of it, this is news.
News, relevant, important history-making news, it was live on C-SPAN, reality TV.
Yet our most famous trusted 24-765 cable news media outlets are asleep at the wheel or holding back,
neither was a good option.
More considered analysis of the actual political and historical significance of Consentious Move was mixed.
At the Ophengdon Post, political historian Joseph Polermo, author of Robert F. Kennedy in the Death of American Idealism,
had lined up a blog and three dentist's Consentious Make History again, impeached Bush.
Polermo wrote,
In contrast, Salon.com's political blogger Alex Kapleman wrote this misively,
some articles in the blogosphere are complaining about the dearth of coverage of Consentious Resolution I have to disagree.
As I pointed out before when this was a joke,
the media is in the business of covering news.
This barely qualifies.
If it deserves mention in the mainstream media at all, it certainly doesn't deserve to be a court of the status of something big and breaking.
I'm sorry, but the action of a long congressman who's widely considered something of a laughing stock,
especially when it's clear that action will never come to anything, just as in especially newsworthy.
Jim Trackis, who sentenced his Republican opponent next fall's congressional election,
also took the opportunity to blast his rival, complaining that on the day's constituents first started paying $4 for gallon of gas,
congressman who sentenced uses his time and efforts for more political games,
and I'm trying to solve the real problems in Washington.
But it beat a boot for the right.
I ain't going anywhere.
And he had, they showed it last night on Dan Abrams on MSNBC.
They showed from C-SPAN the feed.
They showed them reading the entire bill on the floor of the house, and that's it, Yamama.
At Consentious, already agreed that they're going to bury it and it's not going to come to an actual hold on impeachment.
And nothing's going to happen. It's already a foregone contusion, man.
Well, what's the point? Isn't it a little bit late? Isn't the horse out of the barn in 700 miles down the road?
Yeah, it's a little late now.
Yeah, that's right. A little bit late now.
Brian Song, 16. Requiem for Dream.
Now, let's see the first time I think Requiem won by a mile. Well, no, not by a mile.
First time we'd done this 600 years ago, Requiem for Dream had 132 Brian Song 107.
Was it a two horse race?
And old Yeller was third.
I was Romeo and Juliet on this the first time?
I don't know.
I'm sure it was. Or maybe I just added it.
Make it on there. It had ten votes.
Romeo and Juliet, the so sad, don't drink that wine.
Wasn't wine.
What was it? Poison.
I know. It was poison.
What was it in? Just poison in a bottle?
It was.
It was about the little bottle of poison from the apothecary in the air.
What did she put in it?
Drink it in her mouth.
In her purse?
He drank the poison. And then she woke up.
And then like he was already there, croak,
does she try to get the poison out of his mouth? You know, she tried to lick it off the earth.
You're trying to get out of his mouth?
Yeah. And that didn't work so she grabbed his dagger and thrust it into her breast.
And croaked right over him.
I'll be damned.
If he thrust it into her breast,
this is the song from the movie, maybe it'll ring a bell.
When they were doing that little flirting thing,
it was while the sky was singing.
He ever starts.
Maybe not.
Of course.
No, there's a...
I've had these somewhere.
You've had what?
The actual song from the movie.
Which was kind of you.
Didn't suck.
As far as that kind of thing goes,
maybe he'll start singing this time.
Nope.
I'll get it yet.
Get out of here.
You should just keep on talking.
Where did these young people behind John McCain?
Plants.
We got British me.
We got British flag on his shirt there.
Yeah, figures.
Go back to England.
Okay, and go out and get your rod at Rotten Teeth and throw them in the Thames.
You idiot.
Go consort with the Prince Willie.
I get the Willie's just thinking about the Brits.
They're so damn silly.
Really?
Oh, and Prince William is going on the secret mission.
And Prince Harry is over there in Afghanistan fighting the Taliban.
And yeah, how about sending the Queen over there?
Prince Charles.
That's the real Queen.
One thing about Elizabeth ever crooks,
and he becomes the head of the kind that he'd eaten,
still call him Queen.
Buggering that guy there in Buckingham Palace.
They ought to call it Buggering Palace.
Buggeringham Palace.
Am I right?
You bet.
Death in Venice has two votes.
Well, look at all the ones that don't have any votes.
Now, what was the one with Liz Taylor?
Suddenly last summer.
It's on her, but the never any votes yet.
Nobody saw that, nobody.
Get out of here.
Nobody saw that movie with that Queen.
No.
What's his name?
Yeah, my money cliff.
Boy, you've got to be kidding me.
Nope.
Nobody saw that movie.
Nope.
You'll see.
It's going to get a sudden flusher vote just to prove you're wrong.
I'll upset.
WQAM, hello.
What's going on in the movie?
QAM.
Oh.
WQAM, hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Hello, Neil.
Yes?
I apologize if it's already on the list,
but you got the champ on there with a little Ricky Schroeder.
It needs me.
We got a champ on there.
I thought I'm checking.
That was him.
Yeah, Jacker.
Real quick, Neil.
I got two things for you.
Yesterday, you talked about you were doing that thing with the Burton Jax,
and the reason that Burton Jax went out of business was because of the Homeland Security thing.
We sent that close up, 9-11.
Yeah, it was just, there was too much on their business, but, you know,
you're talking about right now the vote with the synergy you're saying,
well, it's too little too late, which it is.
But there is a reason for that, just like they voted to repeal the tax incentives
for the oil company yesterday.
And that's just to make it a matter of record, and to get everybody's vote on there,
because when it comes to paying for re-election or...
They're not going to get everybody's vote on there.
Don't you understand?
I just got you saying that.
Or the oil yesterday, they voted, and it was straight party line.
The Republican said, no, we're not going to repeal the tax breaks for the five bills.
They're going to be the big oil companies, which amounts to about $1,000.
You didn't listen to anything I just said.
I bet.
Absolutely good.
They want to get it on record to see how people vote.
Yeah, it's too little too late, but you know what?
Now it's a matter of...
You've been listening to a word I said.
You just keep talking and talking and talking and what I said does make any difference.
So, what's the point?
Oh, you're voting.
I'm going to hang up on the table, Rodgers.
4.50, QAM.
What did you say?
Fourth, leader.
Neil Rodgers.
Ah.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
I'm going to hang up on the table.
For team No踢 the cue� bird.
Maybe I didn't put that story.
I just looked on our home page there.
I didn't see that story about the percentage.
Maybe I didn't put it, but I read it on the area
yesterday, including the first articles.
Remember, they're like these stories.
Remember that?
Right.
And all these people, well, put it on the record.
It's not going on any record.
I mean, he introduced the articles, and there they are.
And they're going to send them.
They're going to bury it in the House Judiciary Committee.
And it's going to die there.
Nobody's going to vote on it.
They're not going to be any impeachment proceedings.
Oh, these people.
Oh, but it'll be better.
But about it, he just don't get it.
And then when you try to tell him, they still don't want
to get it.
See, there's one thing about Dennis Krocinich.
Even then, I've said this when he was running for president.
I'll find it.
Nobody takes him seriously no matter what he does.
I know.
It's because he's short.
Nobody takes him.
Oh, he's a little jai.
Kind of funny.
But you should see his wife.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
She's prettier than Leonard Whiting.
She's prettier than pretty much anyone.
And let me say it again.
All this bluster now at this late date, it's pointless.
If Pelosi and Reed would have had any balls long time ago,
they could have impeached both the Bush and Cheney.
They should have been doing it long before now.
But nevertheless, too late now.
Here's Muriel adding to the confusion.
Well, we've got a lot of confused people out there today.
For the poll, he says, how about a mercenistry X,
which is on there and it's got three votes.
And Rick and Pedreem, which is on there, has eight votes.
Sorry, Muriel, but guess what?
It's way out of touch.
And the champ was already on there.
And what was?
The champ was already on the champ.
Well, he was just inquiring.
And you answered his question until he went through that long
rant about this exercise.
It's a pointless exercise.
It means nothing.
It means absolutely positively nothing.
Absolutely correct, sir.
And to show you what a screwed up situation the situation things are,
I would use the veto as needed, John McCain,
said during his speech yesterday, I will veto every single beer bill with earmarks.
He said his rumblings from the crowd could be heard.
Every single beer.
And every single bill that we've got, that we have come across my desk,
I'll make them famous.
I'll veto them.
You know, you will know their names.
MSNBC reported that protesters interrupted McCain's speech.
McCain was introduced by eBay Inc. CEO Meg Whitman was briefly interrupted by three protesters.
We all that war is bad for small business.
Protesters were brewed and escorted from the room and McCain used the interruptions to
call for civil debate in the campaign.
Now a war is what war is a business.
It's a big multi-billion and an out trillion dollar business.
That's what this Republican establishment is in the business of.
There's a business of war.
Remember when W. was going out of the war time present?
I remember that crap?
Right.
That's what that's all about.
Big money for Halle Burton and for Boeing and for Lockheed and for Kellogg Brown and
Rupertless, all these crooks.
Making billions while we're sitting trying to fill up a gas tank here for 80 bucks a gallon.
Like I said yesterday in the public is like that.
Somebody QAN, hello.
QAN.
How you doing?
Okay.
I'm in the car so I didn't read your whole list.
But I asked you for these.
One of them was as a movie with Alan Arkin.
It's called The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.
Yeah.
Where he's out of you may have seen it where he plays this deaf new guy.
Yeah.
It says pretty well no movie and his best friend dies.
And he winds up killing himself.
It's like this.
It sounds like a rather fun.
It's really depressing.
The other movie George's White Man theme.
I'm sure you would think it's a smooth but it's the famous Italian movie called Umberto
D. It's about an old man and his dog.
Yeah.
It's a great film but it's really heartbreaking.
If you don't cry you have no heart.
Okay.
All right.
Take care.
Thanks, Brian.
You got those two?
A great film but it's heartbreaking.
See I don't think they can be the same thing.
Why not?
Because that's not why I watch movies.
Life is heartbreaking.
I watch movies too.
I'm a director for a dream.
Wasn't that heartbreaking?
In some ways yes but it was heavy.
It was heavy yes.
It's heartbreaking.
It was heavy but it had a happy.
Also a lot of it was beyond television.
That's right.
And Jerry that part of it was heartbreaking but it all worked out in the end for Jim
for Connoir.
In the end yeah.
She got hurt as soon as the end.
That's all you care about is asked to ask.
That's the only reason you like that movie and that's not true.
That is true.
You don't care about Sarah you don't care about Jerry and that purple thing.
I care about what people mean.
I care about his purple thing.
I'll bet.
Yeah a lot.
You would have helped him.
I would have helped him out.
I'd give him a happy hand.
So how are you doing combined here, Chris?
You had $8.82 on the first poll.
Let's see if we can put this poor man over his out of his misery.
$147.
That sounds like $9.69.
That means the next half hour going over a thousand votes.
I'll told.
Another exciting?
That's the kind of excitement you won't hear on the Futsi show.
I'll tell you that.
That's silly as best.
Well, I'd by the way to Sun Senthal's doing this thing of inviting people to send in their
pictures taken with celebrities.
And the second picture on here is a bunch of group balls with footy.
And all those people that we had as you keep chewing them out and bitching them out who
took the pictures of Gulf Stream that day, there must have been 75,000 people snapping
the picture.
Nobody sent any picture with me or you or with any of our onto right.
But three people sent pictures.
Well of all the snap that went on.
Isn't that sad?
Yeah.
Ask not what your talk hosts can do for you.
You know how that goes.
WDQA Am, hello.
Hey, Dale.
Yes, sir.
What about one of the best theme songs ever from Walking Tall?
We're not doing fine songs.
We're not doing fine songs.
We're not doing fine songs.
Yeah.
Do you remember?
Do I remember what?
The theme song from Walking Tall, the end of the movie.
It was a pair jerk or what a Johnny Mantis did it.
Walking Tall?
Yes, sir.
What was the name of that song?
I believe it was from I was walking tall.
All right.
I'm going with it.
Johnny Mantis did the theme song from Walking Tall.
Well, he could be right.
I don't know.
He could be.
Who knows?
I'm a Google in it right now.
You might have fooled some people.
Walking Tall 2004.
I don't think so.
With the ghost venson?
Who?
With the ghost venson?
With the ghost venson?
With the ghost venson?
And John Beasley?
I do like that.
That's probably a remake.
Isn't it?
Dennis Consentius is making a sequel walking small.
Oh, and I'll be picking out Dennis.
He's got that resolution.
He's got balls.
Mama, yeah, great.
Too late.
Too little as usual.
Democratic Party.
Failing America.
That's what they do best.
Failing America.
The only reason we need them in there is to get these Nazis out.
That's all.
They're a buffer.
That's all they are.
They're a few good guys like Russ Fine Gold, you know, a few good people in there.
And then the rest of them.
Like that.
Week.
WQIM.
Hello.
QAM.
Hello.
Swine spaghetti monster, please.
WQAM.
Hello.
Good morning, sir.
Yes, sir.
Absolutely correct.
I mean, I love Dennis, but what's the point?
I mean, it's over, man.
It's done.
They should be in jail.
They should have been in jail a year and a time ago.
That's right.
Absolutely.
But hey.
For the movie, listen, you're building the list.
I thought to kill a mockingbird.
Yeah, that was depressing.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm a great rich man.
Yeah.
There you go.
All right.
All right.
Let's put every movie that was ever made on there.
They're all depressing.
How about the Godfather?
How were you talking about?
Be pressing.
Happy ending.
There was no happy ending and it ended the three.
You're going to be ending?
Sure.
They got the old age.
The Michael Ciceroan drops the orange on the ground and crawls.
That's right.
That's a happy Godfather ending, meaning they didn't get him.
He died of natural causes.
That's the best thing to have for him.
Take the canolli.
What?
Yeah, you're right.
Happy ending.
What about walking tall with Johnny mattress?
I wonder, Johnny, you know, is anything about dial amatris, do you think?
It's your hope, so.
You'll be doing this thing on a really comfortable mattress.
I'll tell you that.
Four minutes till noon at 5.60 WQM.
I think this is the day that we all just collectively lose our minds.
You know?
Like that.
Although, what would be different about any other day?
This is Pretty Quit.
Whatever I shade my fall, I listen to the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour.
I'm coming at you.
Why, from Mr. Dullard, right there?
They called him Mr. Dullard, baby.
No, we're not my amacillth at all, but that just buys another 10 minutes anyway.
For about 100 and 30 minutes of elaborate wrap around your niggas boards per version.
So go on out here, jazz with me and get a parade donut.
I'm Mr. Dullard, in President's Marga.
He's identified on the corner at 441 of Margae Boulevard.
Right across from the Lakeshore Drive-In.
The nearest trip that are here are view doors out from a groin.
Hey, I said Strict, where's my truck?
I can't. I forgot the equipment.
You ain't got no equipment.
No.
Are very capable program directors.
You're blarrants, ladies and gentlemen.
You got that, but you don't got no drugs.
Sorry, I...
Well use your handlers of the drum on the table.
Do something. I need my drums.
Okay, I'll try.
Hey, Claren.
Yes.
I want you to take off your pants and run up and down 441.
I'm not going to do that.
I'll have you know.
Horts, huh?
I'll say it.
Sports.
Give me a butt, I can't.
Here we go.
Sports.
He's sports.
Okay.

Sports.
Oh, that happened.
Couple two at 560.
Well, I can't wait till 2 o'clock for that jerk show.

Or maybe just I can't wait till 2 o'clock, you know.
Well, yeah.
You realize it's already Wednesday?
The ball goes into Georgia's hands on London.
Well, it's the summer schedule.
Yep.
And aren't you lucky that I didn't take this week for vacation this week?
I am.
It's great.
I'm pushing it back until Apoco gets his passport renewed.
Puffa Porto?
He'll pass a photo.
He's got the old one back now.
He's legal.
He's permanent.
He's got his stuff.
Contrary to some, a lot of negative people out there.
Oh, gee.
Everybody's illegal, you know.
Yeah.
Right.
I just get really worn out from people who are so negative, you know.
I like being positive like me.
You're positive?
You know what I'm going to do?
Because I just want to have 4,000 more facts like that stupid one from Mario, who meant well.
But, you know, both of the movies are on the list.
Since we're back to pole building.
Pole building.
Oh, sorry.
I'm going to read to the whole list right now.
That'll take us till midnight.
I'm no fool.
Although I got to go be delivery boy today.
I got to go get that chicken parmesan today.
It's a really good crack.
You like chicken parmesan?
Yeah, very much.
I like practically anything parmesan.
Yeah, me too.
I like that.
Me too.
Veal parmesan.
Oh, yeah.
Elbow is parmesan.
Strip parmesan sometimes.
People have that, yeah.

Oh, yeah.
What was the most depressing movie ever made?
Brian Song, 21.
Recorded for Dream 11.
Old Yeller, 10.
I never saw that.
Thank God.
I'm such a dog lover.
You know, I don't want to see any sad sad.
Yeah, you don't want to trust me.
You don't want to.
Why, Old Yeller.
Croaking in.
I ain't going to give it away.
Why not?
You'll cry.
No, I won't.
You want me to tell you?
The root of everybody.
Listen, if I haven't cried sitting here in this station all day,
I'm not going to cry now.
Yeah.
Well, it's a very typical up to a certain point.
It's a very typical boy in his dog movie.
Old Yeller is the best dog a boy could ever have saved the kid's life.
Everybody loves Old Yeller.
Old Yeller is the best dog ever, but then he gets bit by a bat.
Yeah.
And contracts.
I'm going to cry.
Rabies.
Who's rabies?
And he starts going nutty.
Oh, poor Yeller.
And he's got to be put down.
And the police says, you know whose job it is to do that.
Don't you son?
It's the dog's owner.
And he's got to go shoot his own dog.
And you do it?
Of course.
That's a good kind of a little dog.
He's got to be done.
He's got to be done.
He should have shot dead.
That would have made more sense.
That's a good kind of a dog.
He had rabies.
He was going to save her.
Yeah, rabies.
I don't care.
I'm not going to cry.
I'm crying right now.
Sounds depressing.
Sophie's choice nine.

If that's Ryan Felipe, I sure like to save his private in a jar.
How come I'm doing all this stuff today?
Wait too foggy today.
Maybe I'm making a comeback.
Maybe my innards are starting to revive.
I doubt it though.
I'm beyond that point.
It's like that lip we talked about on the toilet.
See down in plantation in my house, there are two bathrooms.
One for each bedroom.
Okay.
And my bathroom has got the worst toilet in history.
It's just, I don't know why that is.
It's just that we don't have enough power.
Oh, I see.
Yeah, yeah, that's bad.
And I remember I was talking on the room.
Maybe getting a toilet and all of them.
They were expensive and they're lousy and they're this to that.
And so you have to stand there.
I don't want to get too graphic in the middle of lunch.
I'll be able to stand there and watch after you flush to make sure that everything,
all the drape re, clears that lip.
You know, that's something that you should do when you're at other people's houses.
Well, leave a load.
No, no, no, make sure that everything goes where it's supposed to.
What do you mean by that?
Well, because if five people...
So it was in my house, I shouldn't make sure that everything goes wrong.
Of course you should in your own house, but especially when you're at someone else's house,
because you never know what kind of weak toilets other people are going to have.
I've heard about my uncle Red that did be there used to come visit us every once in a while in Rochester.
And he wouldn't even bother flush and see.
Really? Well, maybe he was into conservation.
Yeah, he was an early water conservation person about it.
I wasn't talking about water conservation.
He was a green guy.
Of course, every time I go in there and look in the turtle, I can't even turn green.
Turn green?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Drop it a little low.
Look, it's a water log!
Oh, no.

I wonder if Johnny mattress sang it
Made in 2003 starring Isabella Rosalini the movie is said in 1933 winner peg where a beer bear in his Rosalini holds a contest
To find the saddest song in the world on the presumption that depressed people drink more beer
She's a double amputee who's fashioned beer-filled prosthetics made of glass

Out of the Washington Post
Having failed an efforts to impeach vice president Cheney represented Dennis Kucinich escalated his battle against the administration this week
By introducing 35 articles of impeachment against president Bush using a parliamentary maneuver that will probably force a vote today
Who's sent it to his impeachment measure accuses Bush of taking the country to war in Iraq under false pretenses
He introduced as a privileged resolution which requires the house to take it up within two legislative days
Any lawmaker may offer a privileged resolution, but it's usually done only by party leaders
Who sent it to upon introducing his articles of impeachment Monday evening and system reading the resolution of a congressional record a process that took nearly five hours
He finished reading it late yesterday after the close of legislative business
As they previously done the Democratic leaders stoshfully opposed Kucinich's impeachment effort they expect a table of resolution
By referring it to the judiciary committee where they expected to die
I mean read that again. They expected table of resolution by referring it to the judiciary committee where they expected to die and it will
House majority leaders stand hoyer of Maryland suggested yesterday that engaging in lengthy debate over impeaching Bush and the waiting days as of administration
Is not a productive use of a house's time
Who sent it to try to similar maneuver last November bringing an impeachment measure against changing the floors of privileged resolution
And it was referred to the judiciary committee just like this one will be too
I mean you can always say better late than never, but it ain't gonna happen
And you want to know why they don't want right?
They don't want
Selina Kansas
Selina police say a 60 60-year-old man who's car cracked into a house leaves brain freeze from a cold ring for the mishap
We've all had that right from a drink too cold or from ice cream too cold right brain freeze. Have you ever had that Chris? Of course
When you work in this outfit you get a lot of that in fact our management suffers from permanent
brain freeze on the wife or guy you have to have a brain first
Robert Schultz told police that the sudden sharp pain in his head while driving Tuesday afternoon was followed by a
chest freeze. What's that? I don't know
Schultz said he had just purchased the flavored frozen drink from a sonic restaurant and was drinking it while driving a 345 p.m
But he was hit by the painful sensation of after it comes after a big swathe will cool liquid
Schultz said his car then went out of control left the street and slammed into the front steps of a house
An ambulance took him to the Selina Regional Health Center where he was treated and released brain freeze
Well, I can you imagine all the people in the world who suffer from brain freeze some of it permanent
Speaking of El Presidente brain freeze
And the fact that there are people that still defend and support that that part is just
It's unconscionable. It's unimaginable to me. It's just but
So some people are
Maybe they have brain freeze too. Here's a 90-seed to seven-year-old woman in
Surprise Arizona
and
A 90-seed year-old surprised woman who has voted in the past 19 presidential elections
Should she find yourself a casualty in the voter ID battle
Surely price cannot register in Arizona for the November elections without proof of citizenship
On illegal Americans. You said I'm born here born and raised in America
The Arizona law was approved by voters in 2004's proposition 200 on that year's general election ballot
It requires voters to produce specified types of ID when casting ballots at polling places and to provide proof of citizenship when registering to voting there for the first time
We're in different country. We need to break it
The problem is anyway
Yes, no, I didn't cross it off which is very bad when you get to be old and feeble feeble like me fee bra
You got to make sure that all your advisor dotted your teaser crossed
Price was born in 1910 and Clinton Kentucky before before birth certificates were even issued
She said she no longer has got to driver's license. Thank God. I never had one I pass a port the
You can see my mother's not a national threat center son Nathan Nimich been voting since 1932
Nimich produced a files documenting his attempts to get her registered
On by the way those seven quick hits I got on that one machine
So the two ladies who were planted just before me they happened to while we'll buy as I was waiting to get paid
And saw the 1900 and 60 a seven dollar jackpot flashing
And she mumbled something and I said yeah
Too bad too bad honey get lost
A delayed birth certificate he said you have to have eyewitnesses everybody's dead
They're all dead when the family tried to get school records from Tennessee
They found out the school she went through don't even exist anymore
We're talking about something that is so precious the right to vote said
Linda Brown of the Arizona advocacy never how many hurdles are okay to jump through how many barriers that we're going to accept
State representative Russell pierce spearheaded lost at a protection integrity of the voting system to get to a movie
Have to prove who you are per se to get a movie
To go right a car you have to prove you are that's part of my to get a movie you have to prove who you are
When did that start what like a blockbuster or something? Yeah, I guess it's lockbuster
You have to have like an id one of those ID cards that you're like I'm right when you sign up
They take down your you know like
That's right. No, everything so that's proving who you are
That's another good reason that to go to slot buster and so I don't good
In addition which they censor movies and they censored language and they are you know plus bald
It was all sorry Wayne it's right. I forgot we were got to be nice to Wayne
Price said for someone who once lived at the time and women could not vote the law is a step backwards the former school teacher said
She's voted in every presidential election since 1932
You know who ran in 1932
Nope
Herbert Heaver Heaver Heaver Hoover and
That's the one juror thirty-two Roosevelt
Oh yeah first term 32 that was after the Great Depression
Nimin had said his next step is took all the governor's office for help
Experse said it's hard to say how many other people in the same situation is priced
But the Arizona advocacy network said almost 40,000 voter registration forms have been rejected since the state voted id
Went into effect see I thought they're trying to get more people to vote and they're not
Maybe they don't like her because she's old. I know what that's like
You're old me on your old. We don't like you're old. You're out of touch. You're an old fart too bad

Queen of hearts
Or like Joyce the queen of farts. Hey Joyce you bitch
See every day I try to think remember thank you mr
President for the low-guest prices and thank you Joyce for helping the show out
Right somebody q.a.m. Hello
Daniel
Maybe a president don't want to call him real quick. I was telling my friend of the day about
No, you think of our politics you get so frustrated
I think it's because it's a lot like another entertainment industry where instead of voting for like a movie with the your wallet
We go see the movie we're voting with an actual vote
But the basic principle is the same how much can they entertain you to to give you
The motivation to go vote for them. You know, and how much can the news entertain you with the Hillary versus Obama nonsense
You know it and I think the real problem comes because people aren't required to vote because it's
Not required, but let's say if we give them an incentive maybe the day off in a national holiday to go
God forbid we shouldn't want to do that to make it too easy to vote
Of course, I think in most countries maybe some facts benefit something then anything to make it more required because
Yeah, I mean how hard would it be it's like almost like they don't want people to vote
They want to make it the system where it's just like the movie industry is a popularity contest
That's right
Like people are you talking about it and I know you care. I know we can't get on people care
But it's like because if you feel so passive because you really don't have a say
You have a vote, but it's but not everyone vote so it's like sure happy about 80% of the countries against Iraq
But only half the country votes so we're not really getting a legitimate vote
And if I can vote about it about 20 or 30% of those people ought to be forced to stay home too
Right, just like the people who voted for passion of the Christ when that came out
It's not that you know, it did well because the whole nation is eager for a movie like that
It's because the church is all one and bought it entire movie theaters to watch the movie
So you had the same thing applies to the voting
Well, they like Mel Gibson because he's an anti-Somite so you know, oh, you've got to love that
Have a great day pal. I'll pray for us. Thank you. 126 of QAM

Hoyki, Newton, Canada, if you can go a buck by CTV.
You're just thinking of me the same.
No, no.
And that's stop and Tom if they put that thing on her. I'm not gonna watch some
Warhockey games on Saturday. I'm gonna go to Woodbuy in Saturday night.
They'll miss you. I'm gonna go to Mohawk and punch my guts out on Randy Waples.
And Jack Moisea.
And Satch Werner. And Marty Cohn. As failed Democratic presidential candidate
Hillary Rotem Clinton continues her behind-the-scenes quest for the Vice
Presidential nomination, her long shot hopes for even that job are being derailed by
her husband's continued affairs with other women.
Actress Gina Graschon is just the latest young woman to be linked with Hillary's
philanthropy husband and Clinton inciders fear the former president's jet-set lifestyle
will do many real political future for his wife.
With presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama insisting that all potential candidates
for Vice President, including Swoley Clinton, be fully vetted by his search team along with
their spouses and family, AIDS to Swoley say any real scrutiny of Bill Clinton's activities
will uncover more evidence of adultery. He's still screwing around Grumbles
One Clinton. I was gonna say that myself and then I see it's the next line on the story.
Is that amazing or what? That's amazing. But that's you thought.
He's still screwing around. He's always has and probably will they said.
Over the last few years, AIDS have Winston repeated tabloid reports about Clinton's
episodic friendship and occasional dinners out with
Columbus Strannack, a twice-deboard billionaire auto-parts-aerist, a member of the
Canadian Parliament 20 years as junior. That bitch. Or had more recent high-end Hollywood
dinner party gossip that Clinton has been seen visiting with the actress Gina Gershaw
in California. There's been talk of a female friend in Chapacua, a woman in a bar at
a meeting of the Aspen Institute, and a public signing of Clinton.
Oh, I see. A public signing of Clinton being an Arabishing entourage in a New York
elevator that a former Clinton they told me, let a business leader who saw them to say,
I don't know what the guy was doing, but it was so clear that it was just no good.
Well, he thought it was good. It's all good.
Nobody always says it's all good. Kiss it. No. Kiss it. It's all good. No.
I don't want to. Prince would say kiss it goodbye.
None of these whispers to smoke have produced a public fire, but four former Clinton
needs to hold me. Who wrote this? It's by, oh, it's on Capitol Hill, blue.
That about 18 months ago, one of the president's former Capitol Hill blue
dressed 18 months ago, one of the president's former assistants who still
advises him on political matters. And heard somebody complaints about such reports
from Clinton supporters around the country. He felt compelled to try to conduct what one
of these aides called an intervention. Because the aide believed Clinton was apparently
seeing a lot of women on the road.
They would be intercessor was rebuffed by people around Clinton before ever getting
an audience with a former president. And another rate told me the effort wasn't well
received either by Bill or Swillery. And that's some swillery anders in particular
were in denial about the continuing political risks that Bill's behavior might pose.
Well, he sure can't get in any way to hurry. He can be damn sure that.
Is there anybody who doubts why he's screwing around? No, I imagine it's because of the
pins.
Hellries.
A either one Bill Clinton is a man who does like to spend the night low. He spends
many nights away from his wife. A former aide of the president told Capitol
blue he still has an eye for the ladies. As Joe Rose would say, how you doing with
the ladies and like the Marlins?
Clinton also likes to hang out with others who share his passion for young women.
Prudome writes of Clinton's buddies who joined him at the wedding of his long time
assistant. Also in attendance was Ron Berkley writes a California supermarket
billionaire investor who's Clinton's bachelor buddy, fundraiser and business partner.
Berkley come with an attractive blonde described by fellow guest as not much older than 19 if that.
Berkley usually means a transport as the custom converted Boeing 757 that Clinton calls Ron
air and that Berkley's own circle of young age privately for to his air F1.
And that's not for seater air F1.
Air F you wedding.
Clinton himself had arrived on the private plane of another California friend, the
Rita State air Democratic donor liberal activist and sometimes movie music producer Steve
Bing whose colorful private life includes fathering a child on their
woodlock with the actress Elizabeth Hurley and suing the billionaire investor Kirk
Kirkroy and for invasion of privacy alleging that private investigators for
Kirkroy and swite Bing's dental floss out of his trash and a successful effort to prove
that BNAs that Bing's DNA match that of a child delivered by Kirkroy and his ex-wife
the former tennis pro Lisa Bonder the suit was later settled on the court.
AIDS admit privately that Clinton still messes around and say there's no way that his wife doesn't know.
Swirlry is perfected the art of looking the other way when a suits her political needs
and ambition when it pants suits her needs to his a Clinton insider. I don't think she cares
as long as it doesn't become public. While Clinton is refused to discuss these specifics
in programs article spokesman for both the former president Grishon had denied any affair
and Clint is called the author of scumbag and worst names even though
Prutem is married to D.D. Myers Clinton's first press secretary at the White House.
denial however solved always part of Clinton's game plan he denied later admitted
in a fair with White Hurst and intern Monica Lewinsky meanwhile two other women in
Clinton's passive come out of the shadows with a tense to cash in on the relationship
with the former president Jennifer Flowers and Paula Jones which we babbled about yesterday.
How do you like that he's still screwing around Bubba when you think that would come
him down a little bit or what? No. Just got that nasty temper man that nasty red faith push
keeps getting redder and redder on his face too and maybe that's why.
254 you realize how many votes Chris has got on his poll today? A lot.
6 and 7 10 76 you're going over 1100 Mr. with these two polls.
You don't care? That's all good. Not impressed. Oh it's all good now you're quoting Bubba huh?
Huh? Kiss it. 254 on the poll. Yeah I'm sure I just got a real look.
I just got a message. What was the most depressing movie ever made?
Ryan's song 25 all the other 15 Requiem for Dream 15 Sophie choice 13 and the deer 111
everything else say a single digit saving Ryan's private says next.
Government lawyers tried yesterday to revive a 1998 law designed to keep online
porno away from children and questions that it is significantly outdated and blocks too much
legal speech while having no real effect on content posted from overseas.
The third US Circuit judges hearing the case questioned the laws of effectiveness
giving given estimates that have all online porno is posted and porn is posted overseas
beyond the reach of US law. Free speech groups say the child online protection act misses the
mark today because it doesn't cover chat rooms or YouTube and other interactive sites that
emerge in last decade like I said you. Cheers. Excuse me.
Lawyers with the AC of you representing salon dot come and other sites that challenge the law
argue that Internet filters block 95% of the offensive content and can be sent to match a child's
age or parents judgment but only half of all families use them just as department lawyer Charles
Scarborough can counter if there's nothing that works perfectly here why not go with the thing
that least defends the Constitution judge Thomas Ambrewast. Scarborough argued that the nation needs
a belt and suspenders approach to the complex problem. Maybe those suspenders that Bill Sidal
was wearing. Rest in peace. Was he wearing suspenders when you met him? Yeah. Or overalls.
Wow. What a guy. I kind of guy. Got all the money in the world held rest. I'm in early once. See?
You don't need to impress people with fancy clothes. That's right. The three judge panel didn't
indicate when it would rule last year federal judge early month long trial on the law deemed
an unconstitutional infringement on the first amendment. The justice department's hoping to
overturn that ruling the law has never been enforced because sexual health sites along.com and
other web publishers sued and won a temporary injunction that the US Supreme Court later upheld.
The law would make it a crime for web publishers to let children access material
deemed harmful to minors by contemporary community standards the sites would be expected to require
credit card number or other proof of age penalties include a $50,000 fine up to six months in the slimer.
ACL U lawyer Chris Hansen. By the way you see the kid the drummer for the Hansen died? Yes.
Not gonna make some cost to come but it will be in private taste though.
So I won't say it. Okay. Don't we have Hansen through the years? I think we did. Oh yeah.
Flores. To Hansen. The year 2000. You want fries with that?
ACL U lawyer Chris Hansen said the government was trying to override the rule of parents who
deploy various ways to monitor their children's computer years. I'm not here to say copas perfect
but filters aren't perfect either. Scorbal argument. Filters. Even on cigarettes, even on those
faggots filters aren't perfect. People are still dying and choking and gagging.
Paul Newman by the way denies that there's any, you know, it's a report. I got the story here.
Have we cared about Paul Newman anymore? No. No. He's still alive. He's still alive. He's hanging on.
He wants a story real fast. I can be a sure. It's in my pilot. So here it is. Paul Newman
responds cryptically to cancer reports. It's suspected that he's got lung cancer. He's being
treated. He's keeping it quiet though. Probably smoking a lot of faggots over the years.
Ask for running active problem and responding to a flurry of unconfirmed reports that he's
gravely ill with cancer. Is he a tourist cryptic state in the estate that shed little light on
his actual condition? The response was he's doing nicely. That was it. He's doing nicely. He's 83.
And according to numerous media concerts relating on the internet, he's been diagnosed with lung
cancer and is undergoing outpatient treatment in Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York.
He's doing fine. He's doing okay. Quit popping on them faggots or you kids out there.
Okay. Quit try that grown up. Okay. You're going to be grown up so fast. You're going to be dead.
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah.
Prominutes after 1560 WQM.
Brickite f***ing bow.
Why don't you tell me I need a surgery? I said dog, let you final answer.
Gotta TV show it in New York Jack.
And unlike Kathy Lee, I'm gonna be back.
But first I have to bypass my arteries.
Maybe doubted quark and fill in for me because
Regis Filvers got a quark of heart.
A bunch of doctors look at my chart.
They're gonna have to spread my ribcage apart.
Oh god. Regis Filvers got a quark of heart.
Don't worry folks. I'm not gonna weather away and die like America's got talent.
I've got a great ways to live.
Can we rip up promise to give me a sponge bag?
All right. 117 at 560 WQM. I still think I just checked in a kitchen
and the hot water is back. All right.
So I think you ought to let me go because we already had that timing for my
choices. I did. Just take a shower during a break. You take those fast too, right?
Are you out of your mind?
That's a shower during a break.
Yeah, come on. You got four minutes.
You think I could do it?
I'll even play a long rejoin.
That's right. We'll play a bit after we play.
A sports rejoin and then I'm gonna do it.
I'm not waiting. Okay. I'm clean and perceived.
I'm strange. Like an old queen.
No.
I'm not gonna do that.
Good.
I can take a shower later on the afternoon before I go to Woodbine if I
decided to do that later on.
But I don't want to go there because that idiot's going to be stalking there.
You believe me?
I think so.
Then oh, but maybe we can hook up at Woodbine and have a little chat and go away.
Just go away.
Oh, don't you want to hear from your fans now?
I'm sure that's what Jolly Joe was thinking.
And in his case, thinking is unusual.
Speaking of unusual things, the last witch
beheaded in Europe should be exaggerated because she was the victim of judicial murder more than
200 years ago said the government of the Swiss state of Galaris yesterday.
The 1782 execution of Anna Goldie.
Now it's spelled G-O-E-L-D-I.
I'm probably pronouncing it wrong. Goldie.
Oh.
For an alleged case of progeny was a miscarriage of justice.
The Cantanal Government said the decision to recommend rehabilitation or clearing her name
came after a long debate in the Eastern Swiss region and was taken in consultation with a
Protestant and a Roman Catholic Churches.
The decision reverses to be fused alasdier by the Cantanal Government and a Protestant Church
Council to consider an exoneration.
The government changes due after the Cantanal Parliament urged her to be considered.
I guess it's going to make a lot of difference, do you think?
Yeah.
The recommendation to be known is that Goldie was unfairly prosecuted not a witch goes back to the
Parliament for final approval.
You think that we're wasting time in our Congress which we are on a lot of Khazirai?
Well, this is the kind of stuff that wasting their time on the Swiss.
The Shvites.
They got nothing else going on.
They're still looking for a lot of the gold that Hitler stole from the Jews, you know.
There's one bank in Amsterdam which is not too far from where I had my second apartment there.
And my landlord told me that there were rumors that a lot of that gold was hidden in that man.
Nazi Jukehold.
Yeah.
When you know what he thought of the Jews, my landlord.
Well, he was an Amsterdamian wasn't he?
He was Dutch.
I think the Dutch, are they like Nazi light?
Yeah, yeah, except that the interesting thing is that the worst thing you can do
the biggest insult is confused Dutch people with German.
Oh, if you call them like that.
Everybody's like that.
Personally, having been in Germany so many times, I'll take today's Germans any day
over the Dutch.
Any day, especially the young ones.
Goldie made servant in the House of Prominent Berger, Johann Jacob Tudy,
was convicted of spoiling a family's daughter causing her to spit pins and have convulsions.
What does that mean spit pins?
I don't know.
I've heard of spitting blood.
Tudy, a doctor in Magistrate was less of a headlovafer with Goldie.
She was a daughter who had been made public as her potential would have been seriously damaged.
Goldie's trial and be heading in the village of Mollice was carried out at a time
when witch trials had disappeared from most places in Europe.
Like, you know, last week or so, 20 years ago.
The Protestant Church Council which conducted the trial had no legal authority
had decided in advance the one who was Goldie.
She was executed even though the law at the time didn't impose the death penalty for non-lethal poisoning.
This is to acknowledge that the verdict handed down came from a non-legal trial
and that Anna Goldie was the victim of a judicial murder set ago.
I'm sure she feels a lot better about it now.
Well, she, she me dead anyway.
That's when we'd look at her right?
Right.
Oh Jeff, one of our my space people, he denominates elephant man for the poll.
Okay.
You see it?
Yeah.
He said he cried through the home movie.
He balled.
Yeah, it was sad and then it ended tragically.
Really?
In other words, it was sad and then it got sadder and sad.
That's right.
Kind of like our experience at QAM.
It was always sad but it keeps getting sadder and sadder.
Badder?
How you doing on there?
Chris, on the poll.
Brian's song, you know what I'm saying?
It's interesting.
This poll is getting squad.
274 votes and like I said, there's 80 million choices.
Most depressing.
First time we did the poll, I think we had a pretty good response.
Let me take a, let me take a puke at it.
Four pages.
Four pages of this crap.
Yeah.
1352.
You think we're going to 1352 votes on this poll by tomorrow?
By the time we, I schmit can it?
No.
No.
But why is that?
How come it was so good then and they liked it and now they don't like it?
Is there a reason for it?
I don't know.
I mean, what does it have to do with the Amarlin's?
I know that.
Probably not much.
Brian's song, 25,
Requiem for Dream 18, old Yeller 16,
Sophie's Choice 14, and the Dear 112,
and six million movies with single digits.
How did Romeo and Juliet do?
Has it got any?
It's got mine, I know that.
You see it?
Two.
Me and somebody else.
Me and some of the queen that loved Leonard Whiting.
Two, uh, yeah.
That's a problem.
We have a hundreds of votes on there for too much.
Faggot reading it.
That's okay.
George wants me to be a professional fag.
And I don't want to disappoint you.
I do.
Yes.
What the hell is it saying?
What did I say that?
You said I'd go out and get more actions where you're saying.
Oh.
Where you can't get out of your car.
No, you're personal life.
Unless you start thinking about it a lot more and talking about it.
I thought you meant on the show, no.
What?
Yeah, go get yourself.
No, what?
No, don't be so faggy on the air.
Be really faggy the everywhere.
Off the else.
Yeah.
Well, that makes me a phone event.
No, no, no, no.
Yes, it does.
No, no, no.

beer thing or some bar.

Yep.

Goodbye.
Oh, listen, those sirens, man.

What does Dan LaBaston have to do with this radio station?
Oh,

Yeah.
I thought that I called information and they gave me
a ISD QAM and they gave me this phone number.
This is QAM.
Ah, I'm looking double.

I'm not going to ask you a question.
I'll help him.
I'm not going to ask you a question.
He asked you a question.
Help him.
He lost.
When did you die and they forgot to tell you about it?
I about a week ago.
Okay.
At least he's honest anyway.
That was bad.
No, that was great.
You were going to talk about it.
That was bad?
I mean, he was bad.
That way, he was great.
If we had a hundred calls like that every day,
we'd get back up to at least a three-shear anyway.
I don't think we'll ever see any numbers again.
Thanks, Jolly Joe.
You're ready to help a job.
Now, that's just a hand-fashed job.
You did a sensational job.
You destroyed everybody.
Even the once-in-vincible, okay?
Damn, God!

So all of the same
All the same people
WQA and hello
Christopher Camille, please
Speaking
Yeah, no, I'm just curious
What is this personal agenda you have with the clips
Every time I mean
What is it that makes you
Every single article is negative about them
I'm going about it
But they don't present me to you
I'm just curious because
I'll tell you don't like them
You've got stuff
We've established that
But it's
No, we haven't established that
No, we haven't established that
I voted for him twice
And I liked him when he was president
I don't like him now
But you just
It's every day
It's really this, really that
But you don't like it
Listen to somebody else
That's not the answer
If you don't like it
Listen to somebody who's going to kiss her ass
I don't like her
Okay
I don't like her
Well, yeah, I think we made that clear
But in my entitled not to like her
If you're totally entitled but you
Well, in my neural business
Go to your own show
Shma, go back where you came from
Go kiss the queen on a race
I like that
This will be distance
Will it be that
Because that's in my opinion
That's why
And
Lots of Democrats, lots of swallahs
Willary, I've plenty of Republicans
Concert as an all-important independence
Can't stand her
Says the Associated Press and MSNBC
Suggesting possible pitfalls for Barack Obama
Should he make her his
Vice President
So running mate
I wasn't even going to read this story
But just because I want to make this last
Brits day
The intense dislike for Clinton
Suggested beside support for a woman
And others
She could bring to her with a ticket
She might make it harder for Obama
To win over some independence
A pivotal swing group in the November election
Against John McCain
It also means she might push
And Republicans had conservatives
To vote against the Democrats
Who donate money to the GOP
Who might otherwise lack motivation to do so
Because of
Tepp and feelings toward insane McCain
A substantial 32% of independence
Strongly dislike Clinton
10 points more than say so about Obama
Independence group that both Obama
And became wondering their party
Premiers this year
Comprized a quarter of the voters
In the 2004 election
And have been closely contested
Every race since 92
In addition, 67% of Republicans
Have very unfavorable views of swallahy
24% more than feel that way about Obama
Among conservatives is spread as similar
58% say they feel very negatively about her
18 points more than say so about Obama
I don't think I like the idea of Hillary attached
Anything said Kim Williams 33 in Oxfills, Tennessee
Or if Republicans not decided how to vote in November
I'm not for a lot of the things she stands for
Other groups would significantly
Stronger negative feelings about her than Obama
Including whites under 30
Male college graduates
White men and whites earning at least $100,000 a year
But I beat the bloop the rub
How come you're talking so bad about the girl
You have this idea
Because I want to okay
Because it's my show
And I'm going to talk about whatever the hell I want
I'm going to read whichever articles I want
And that's the way it works, Schmuck

Hello, Neil
Yes sir
Hi, how are you?
Okay, how are you?
Robo-Boi
Robo-Boi
A vibe was a negative
A vibe
Good, and then you know what? That's so what his lesson is to for sure
Mm-hmm
And if you would have said it just a little bit louder, I'm sure what it got on the ear
Not
How many Q-A-M, hello
Can I get the all cards and George?
And the best part of the deal is that now that we don't put them on hold nobody hears it
Right
So far as to them right
It cares, you know
As opposed to the old days when people on hold, could hear you know
That's another definite advantage for a screenwriter is that all those people want to perform you know
And stuff that they they've got to know is never going to get on here
Right, that doesn't mean nobody hears that to them
But he hear, oh that's true
So many Q-A-M, hello
Q-A-M
Yes, hi, I'm an arbitrage writer, I got it for this week for arbitrage and they say that
We can write comments
Give them your opinions, I wondered, do you ever get that?
Did they ever form with the opinions to you?
No
Okay, that's what I would ask, thank you
You're welcome
How many Q-A-M, hello
Hey, Neil
Yes sir
That quarter-slot guy, whoever he is, he might be a lot of things, but he was telling the truth
And Goldberg was on this show
And you killed his
I don't understand you do care, I'm just telling you it's true
And they're using it as like one of their drops from lying something about
He said some lying about bedding or something like that
Right
I just want to let you know
Okay, thanks
So Hank was not with Sid the Kid with the id
Greenberg and Goldberg
I don't understand why we're supposed to care about that, Hank doesn't work for these bastards anymore
He can do whatever he wants
If he wants to help him over there, I wouldn't blame him in the least bit
The way he was treated by Joe Fattas-Jolly Joe
Absolutely, unacceptable is the way he was
Some human
After years and years on his station treated like some subhuman garbage
Like yesterday's toilet paper
How many Q-A-M, hello
Now

Hola
Yeah
Yeah
Hey Neil, I'm glad you're taking calls
I gave something for those guys at the NSA to chuckle at
But I was reading you read earlier about you
Finishing going through the whole
impeachment
The thing that's frustrating is the Democrats are the ones that are holding this stuff
Because they know that they're implicit in this
That if it comes down to it
Nancy Pelosi and others will go down
But I think that's just the
Yeah, they got to take the fall
They got to go after this guy
Not gonna happen sir, not gonna happen
It's a shame
It's just telling you know they're all bad
It's not just a Republicans
As much as I'd like to think so it's some of the Democrats too
And got to get them all out there
Most
Yeah, yeah, hopefully the Bible changed that a bit
But we'll see, I guess
Anyway, good luck
Okay, good luck to us
Yeah, good luck
I thought only little girls giggle
Didn't you?
We'll get to get
That's what Bobby Kennedy said that Jim is a hawker
And of course
They're both dead
How do you like that?
Hmm
They both wound up dead
Jimmy Hoffa, he sleeps with the fishes in the middlelands
Or somewhere
Maybe Herado can make a comeback
Well, I know he's on Fox somewhere
But he can make a big splash like he did with Al Capone's empty vault
Mm-hmm
Remember they found that empty wine door or whatever
Once
Maybe he'll find out what happened to Jimmy Hoffa
They can dig up the whole metal lands
And find out where he's buried there
Come into QAM, hello

Get me some wires and a battery pack

Toward a place we know

With our tanks and all our troops
But special forces are so tired
Of jumping through them hoops

So let's cut out all the nonsense
And go blow up Pakistan

Why don't we stop to see food
And go blow up
