We got the era ones we got you you name it we got them
Future terrorists to the world right here in my building. It's a breeding breeding ground
So one day if I'm not here I either croaked or they blew up the building which I guess would be same thing
That was up 29 points. It's not doing much
the works in a 21st century financial system now
This will be one of my earliest initiatives and we will be releasing a very detailed plan on how we think a good
quite a fighting but to not see something inaugural not a good idea
241 votes on the pool other than dumb rude or no speaking English I
Found South Loverians generally speaking to be hostile 85. Oh, yeah, there's a good idea for what's his name over there that loser
Adolf Cycle Grover no not eight off. Oh, what's his name over there at a 50 James Crystal Radio Steve Lapa
Hostile 85 it would they probably get a 90 share
That's at a 50 you know the one that gets a oh point. Oh, they put man. Cow on they got a oh or maybe with 640
I don't know they got all those other
Mediocre station. Oh, you know the ones that normal can't hangs out with James Crystal Radio and
David Ross at the cheap channel. Oh my God. Oh
Every time I think about Norma I think of that one line that Santino says in the Godfather when they come down to the bottom of the stairs
Pop had jenko look what I got
Pop had jenko look what I got but you know what that's okay
He made me a lot of money normal
That's one thing I'll say made me a lot of money and
And by the way under this new deal if he thinks he's gonna get a whole lot of money in 2009. Oh, Norma. What a sense of humor

It was Charlie be left it off Charlie you know your poor ideas are a little bit better. They're coming back into shape
But the suggestions on there are a little bit lacking. How could you leave out hostile?
Pete from Bokas says
Why is everyone so reluctant to let go of fantasy land as long as we keep indoctrinating our kids with imaginary figures like Santa
Tooth Fairy and Jesus will never grow up as a nation wake up. What do you mean as a nation is in as the world the world?
The world Pete the world is in the stone age
Wake up people Santa like marijuana is a gateway drug
It's the first step towards preparing our minds for accepting fantasy figures as reality very well put Pete
That's exactly correct. So rich and in Orlando where we're going to hell he was from it's full of crap
As long as we keep teaching children these fairy tales will never break the back of religion
We'll never grow up as a nation. We'll always be simple
And so never mature in whose minds remain open to the brainwashing that organized religion brings to the world in a nutshell
The childish delusion of the America Americans begins with Santa. Santa must die says Pete from Boka. How do you like that?
By the way the fundamentals die what the fundamentals really hate the whole Santa Claus thing
Thank you to all of that. It's got nothing to do with the secular draws attention away from the true meaning of Christmas
No, he's a no
He's a person the real meaning of Christmas and that is shop till you drop

Labor day for the July you name it every single holiday is about getting drunk
Have in barbie cues and go out and spend a lot of cash. That's what it's all about
Absolutely memorial day you name it. You make it president stay probably people love your plastered on president's day
Wouldn't surprise me
Let me take a look at that view. Okay. Oh
There's something new in there
I'm shocked when I see something new with very exciting
Scott says streaming great in Denver
I just wanted to send you George and Chris happy holiday wishes even though I'm agnostic and only see the holidays as a
Cash crop for retail. Well, that's what it is. I just got to say that the real Scott and Denver
I don't really understand why people take the time to send you and George hate mail
When it's just as easy for them to keep their fingers in their nose where it belongs to begin with everything that is the neo-Roger show
includes you George and even Chris
What does that mean? I'm thankful that all of you are there to entertain me and they have no
I have no complaints keep up the great work. Thanks Neil real Scott and Denver. Thanks Scott. He has no complaints
What's he doing and fading our email with no complaints? I don't know. He should try again
Oh, here's this guy again Edwin. Why did you hate my email? This is gonna be back and forth back and forth
I read it. I put it on the air. I give you your attention that you're looking for and I respond to it
Here's one it says stopping the excuse to dolphins at a week's good. Don't care not interest to call us for shows. Oh my God. Don't care
The food here by the way they squeaked by the raiders and the the patrons the patrons were 700 points ahead before they broke a sweat
And they squeaked by Oakland for crying out loud even even tubbing knows that oh
Right
See
What are you doing?
We're eating oh the food is there what you didn't tell me that one of my supposed to be psychic
Let me just hold you a minute ago, but you didn't hear I wasn't paying any attention. What do you got?
Some sort of a penny pasta thing with some dried tomatoes on it
Some cheese. I don't know what it's called because Andrew did the right thing
He brought the food in and then you got the hell out real quick good. You're an idiot Andrew
They brought food for the whole trip so the kitchen's going good. Thank you Andrew. He just brought some more food in here
Thank you Andrew. You're still an idiot got some Kessadea's or something. I got some
George's and you're something wrong with you. I didn't say it's something. I said there's a lot of things and I don't know how many still counting
So anyway this Edwin says why did you hate my email?
I'm not a chronic all the way. I like to smoke it
I thought my email was halfway decent you completely ripped me
Deservedly so I brought my wife and mother-in-law in the room right before you read my email
You completely embarrassed me in front of them good good. That's awesome. That is the best. Oh
I didn't rip George. I just thought he might be a little arrogant unbelievable new area my day
Thanks a lot. I went yeah you rip George and ask
You just thought he might be this you're giving instructions on life and ripping him and ask you don't even know me
If you if you stumbled into him you wouldn't even know who it was if he farted in your face
You wouldn't know that you couldn't identify the aroma the reason I'm very arrogant is because I'm way better than Edwin
That's right. He's a hell of a lot better human being than you are believe me that ain't saying much Edwin
I'm glad we embarrassed and humiliated you in front of all the people that know your smell
I just go away. Okay. Don't don't don't try this back and forth. Bop bop bop bop
You know see that's one thing about these misfits these chronics. I'm not talking about him
All I will find out but the other ones they did they never go away
I delete them. I block them and I look at the deleted the stuff and they just keep sending and sending
I never read any of it. I just permanently throw it out again because of the same people from the phone
They don't go away either the same chronic lifeless misfits

But I just saw your pull when I lived in South Florida
I found the people to be more snobby than anything else on your list seems many of them were the opinion their own
Schmidt was of an aromatic quality not to be equaled in any other being living or dead
Could you please add snob to your list?
Okay snobby all right good got it. Uh-huh get it on there in between all the feeding going on
That's their hobby to be professionally snobby
Oh, here's one from this clown

Somebody trying to be funny. What about we said about some one last question. Do you think they'll very Timothy bottoms up?
Neckute very cute
Maybe bottoms down who knows? Let's make much difference because once you're dead you're dead
You're not going to heaven or hell. That's the more crap somebody made up
You're not going to purgatory. You're not going to heaven
You're not going anywhere and you're not going to be sitting up at God's side because you wouldn't see him anyway
Because you got no eyes you got no brain you got no heart you got no liver you got no kidneys you got no blood you got no nothing
I got plenty of nothing that that's what you'll have you'll be dead
You'll be rotting for eternity unle but remember what I told you 1973
I was working at WSPV in Sarasota in my landlord who was a crusty old goofball who I'm sure is long since dead
I don't know what kind of conversation we were having but he got into a thing about well
I don't I don't really worry about dying because I'm sure that by the time I get old enough though
They'll have a cure to make let people live forever
How do you like that and now?
Yelp he's dead oh
I mean what kind of jackass comes up with that crap
And the time he gets close to death age. Oh don't worry about it because he'll they'll come up with some kind of a deal
You'll be able to live forever right
Guess what he's dead
You're dead. He was a nasty old fart anyway. I didn't like him
I'd kind of a neat little apartment though in Sarasota that was okay. That was an interesting year of my life 1973
35 years ago. Oh my god. I'm I hold oh
I don't feel low any different like from I'd say 50 yeah
You don't you don't look any older than 50-ish 50 something. Yeah
I could pass for like 65 mm-hmm as opposed to 66
Got you up that wardrobe a little
No, I like being sloppy like Paco says I look like homeless
That's what he says all the time
Good news. I saw a sign on Lincoln Road that says cold stone creamery is coming soon
Even though there are already tens of ice cream gelato yogurts or babe places. I'm like and road one more can't hurt says of somebody some emailer
I
Like cold stone creamery just fine. I think it's really good stuff
It's great. Not good. It's great
You agree I do I know tubby likes it even though he doesn't like ice cream. He's very good
Oh, and he sends it again now
He sends it again
Your denunciation of Lord Santa again the same guy trying to be funny and you're not stop already
He sent a couple of other things this morning. It was fine and you're not funny. Stop trying so hard
I appreciate your efforts, but this particular one blows it blows
It sucks that that was down 28 points not a big deal
The fact of the matter is I don't know that Illinois is doing itself any credit
I'm the light of the and the light of the scandal and the light of the problems of the image of the state in
Illinois is having it seems to me that to put together a process which which deprives the governor of any sort of right
What so ever does not do is ask get this flunky lawyer and
That you'd like some of these get on a shave for crime out like get them a razor
284 on a pole. What's our goal 500? No good to me. No. Are you crazy? All right 400 400
So weak before Christmas and the day before the trend comes out tomorrow
Now what are your fearless part notifications about that? I don't know holding my breath
That cat was right. Well, you're busy eating. That's where I'm sorry. I'm starting to rep lunch
You should be I just jealous. I know I
Think I should have the show catered one day and just have a whole banquet table behind me here
There you go. I'll let the old days. Well just to get even
Although of course most days you guys can't eat anything anyway because jolly Joe is such a hard-ass. Yeah
So
It's not important that everybody else succeeds, but that we make everybody inside the building miserable
That's that's the motto of Q.A.M
Make everybody as miserable as we possibly can and screw over the little people
How's Allison doing by the way? Oh won't see her no more. No, she's like Polly
Won't see her. Yeah, that's right
Well, I think we're out of emails. I could take calls the rest of the day, but I prefer to play the right home

Hostile 108 boy that 37%
So
Say generally speaking most self-evident are hostile
We could have put unfriendly, but I think hostile sounds my I think that summarizes it so much better
And believe me we know about hostile because that's what we get on the phone on the email
On the door on the window everywhere you can you it's palpable as they say you can feel it
That's right you can walk outside your front door and you feel
In the air itself. Well it

A motion lived in our TV.
Had a child out of wedlock.
His blue dance reality.
Now he's wandering.
His bulls are a clown.
Had a hand in breakin' like a commonly down.
Working, earning, now I have to explain.
When did big work become an agent for sight of the same?
Tatt-tatt!
The night that quail watched the earth had brown.
All the foam were living, the night that quail watched the earth had brown.
His water singing, George, you'll go over soon.
For maybe for now that's 60-part two.
Wow, by request from your personal post-buddy, is this go?
Alright, it's a good one.
Since I'll go away, I promise, but I just wanted to wish you and George and Chris a happy holiday.
Shameless request that pit you guys have that's to the tune of the night they grow old, they see down.
Thanks, Pally, I'll go away now.
Good, bye Zisco.
Bye-bye.
Richard says, I know you hate pull building shows, but South Florians are and I...
Oh, I wish you could see the way he spelled us.
Pretentious.
CIOUS.
Pretentious.
Pretentious.
Overly concerned with their money and everybody else's.
That's not the pretentious.
Pretentious like being a poser.
Right.
I mean, it applies, I think we can add that.
Spelled correctly.
Yeah, TIOUS.
Hey Richard, you know, you're going to want to talk about other people when you can't even spell the words that you're putting on here.
Pretentious, my ass, Richard.
Dick.
God.
304 votes on a pull, our goal is 8 million.
If we don't get 8 million, we're all leaving and we're never coming back.
At noon.
Mike says, just wanted to drop you know to say enjoy the time off away from the chronic callers and fake ass e-mailers.
We don't really have enough fake ass e-mailers today.
That would be a big improvement.
It would really help big time, but we just don't...
We had the fake very jackass with that long ponderous thing from the New York Daily News about Stern.
Hope you have a great time.
I would buy and hit it big in the slots too, it says.
Any chance you could play the song?
No.
Can I get it for a nickel?
Can I get it for a quarter?
That's called how much for a *** job?
Yeah, we can't even say the title of it, much less play it.
No way.
Well, are you kidding me, Mike?
Oh, you better watch your Johnson Mike because you're dreaming.
Dreaming.
Any chance you could...
Play it.
No chance.
Look at that phone, man.
That is a door nail.
I was going to go into like a little mini lightning round there, but I don't think so.
You heard the beginning in that first hour when I took those three in a row.
Is there any doubt?
They'll always be there.
Oh, yeah.
Always.
Here's a question and a request.
Has there been a study that included the men who listened to AM radio?
Have soft members.
Every other spot across the dial is for men with problems in the bedroom.
Well, that's all the spam that I get, all of it.
1130 last night, I'm lying there in bed in the blackberry buzzes and I look at it.
Oh, Deborah Johnson wants to help you with your Johnson and they got the softy.
I see I have a Viagra and softy Alice.
Oh, God.
That seems to be the problem all across America.
Is guys with the limp noodles.
Shameless request.
The big turd in the backseat bit.
Keep on trucking you old Zeus is Jason.
Oh, Jason's chronic, but he's all right.
He means well.
Toe art turd, right?
Toe art and play it.
Close it up.
Toe art.
Toe art turd.
Okay.
Is what it's in the DCS under OK.
I say well, you pro yard turd.
That's what you did.
I think we're calling this as T toying.
I may help you.
I just picked up my line of tool cord from your line and that is on huge turd in the back seat.
Are you stirred?
Yes.
And there's one in the back seat?
I'm stirred.
A big ass human turd in the back seat of my car.
I assure you our guys did not take a dump in your car.
If you want to bring that car back and we'll take a look at it.
You want to take a look at it.
My car is fine.
It's that big ass turd in the back seat.
Okay.
What would you like me to do?
I said, okay.
How about I go to your house and pick a loaf on your couch?
How about that?
What would you like me to do to fix the situation?
I want somebody to come over here, get this turd out my back seat.
That's not going to happen.
What do you mean it's not going to happen?
You can bring the car here and we can take a look at it.
I am.
I'm going to bring it back there.
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to take a dump in every last car you got there.
I'm going to peel your counter.
I'm going to do it all.
Okay.
To tell you how it feels.
Okay.
And you know what you feel?
I'm a big girl and man.
It probably came out your ass.
Oh, yeah.
I don't make it happen to go on out and take your dump in the car.
I'm going to let you wait.
Uh, about 400 pounds.
That's your turd.
That's my turd.
Yeah.
That came up from a 400 pound man.
That is a 400 pound man.
He's an adult gorilla.
I'm driving his car right to my lawyer's office and I'm going to let the whole world see.
You're going to be on the news this evening, buddy.
I'm going to get seven on my side.
What?
You're going to be on the news.
Can you describe the thesis?
I mean, what does it look like?
You know what it is.
It came out your ass.
What the hell?
You were telling us.
Ask me what color.
I say what?
It smells ungodly.
That's what it smells like.
It smells like you sold your ass to the devil.
You're going to get it from your teeth to a hand.
Well, how long is it?
It's not as long as my arm.
I don't think it's fun.
Why y'all?
This is not fun.
I got a damn two-bar four and my back feet.
You know, I think this is a racial shit too.
That's what it is.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Look, it's running away from it.
Oh my god.
I'm going to find this funny.
Oh, okay.
You're probably going to share a wheel suit, don't you?
All right, all right.
How long does it look like it's been sitting there?
Steve is coming off of it, okay?
Steve, Steve is coming off of it.
Yeah.
Steve.
Steve is coming off of it?
Yeah, Jim.
It's been a while, yeah.
I am taking this into fresh chairs.
Okay.
What you need to do is you need to bring that chair back.
And we'll match it up.
We have a lineup.
We'll match it up with the other chairs that we have.
Well, what you need to do is learn how to use a toy.
We'll say you're not going to bring the chair back to me.
No.
You know what?
Is this the sample?
No.
I'm starting to like it.
You're going to keep it as a fact?
I'm going to keep it.
Because it's a nice, you know what?
It's a nice conversation, please.
Okay, cool.
Thanks, sir.
All right, thanks, sir.
The biggest name.
The best talent.
You're the new Roger.
Sport Radio 560 QAM.
The fourth leader.
The biggest name.
The best talent.
It's the mad dog.
Hey, a man that's half the news.
Order seven.
Sport Radio 560 QAM.
The sports leader.
It's the best.
It's the young number one.
I'm even me on the east.
It's the bubble east.
It's the blue to the end.
And now a message from Oprah Winfrey.
Oh, hi.
I'm taking a break from telling you how to live your life to enjoy this double.
I'm going to walk with extra cheese.
Oh, this is so good.
Oh, my God, onion rings.
Oh, I'm going to tell Baroque to get onion rings in the wide house.
I would kill for some Dunkin' Donuts and maybe a pizza.
You know, if I keep eating like this,
I'll never fit on the cover of my magazine.
Hey, is that a pork chop?
Oh, boom.
This has been a message from fat Oprah,
who is too busy eating to be a sanctimonyist bitch.
Wow.
11.45.
How about a pretentious bitch?
321 on a pole.
We're going for 400.
Yep.
I think we can do more than that.
But let's start slow because it's a week before a Christmas, man.
And only three days before Tannuca.
Are we going to like the menorah or what?
Cana-hara.
Sure.
All of it.
And we can like doffin in front of the candles.
We can wave our arms by baruchatod.
A noi, mehsmehs.
It's a goisjeveld.
Baba-baba, like that.
All of these things.
That's right.
That was down nine bucks, 9.48.
Nine and a half point.
Fixed no storm coming here tomorrow.
To moin all the way to Detroit.
It's pretty much east to west.
This storm will be a wall of white.
What I mean by that is it's going to start snowing in a hurry.
And when it does, it'll come down fast and furious.
And it'll be a little bit more serious.
Blizzard.
Whiteout.
The walkie were calling 8th to 12.
This is the official weather channel number.
It's Detroit, 6 to 10.
Chicago, 4 to 6.
But the northern suburbs will be in that 6 to 10.
And all this crap about, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas.
What's the big simmiss with that?
I'm not complaining like that one e-mail just now.
Quit your complaining, yodd.
I'm not complaining.
I'm here by choice.
Weather is whatever it is.
But this crap about dreaming of a white Christmas.
Who invented that?
Did Sandy Claus order that so the sleigh could kind of like a land in the snow?
Yeah, there you go.
That's all that song.
I'm dreaming of a white.
I'd rather have a green Christmas myself.
No snow, no frigid temperatures.
Wouldn't that be wonderful?
Yeah.
Wouldn't it be nice?
We're good.
Remember that song by the beach boys?
Wouldn't it be nice?
You like it?
I do.
E2.
312 hours from pet sounds.
Not to be confused with the pet shop girls.
There we go.
It's a little bit nice.
That was the vocal's only version.
It was the what?
I have the vocals only version.
Oh, I see.
Wouldn't it be nice if we all would have the wind storm?
Poor Brian.
Poor misunderstood Brian.
I don't think he was misunderstood.
He was just a nut job.
That's all.
Too much time sleeping with a teddy bear.
And too much dysfunctional family.
Daddy was a real bastard.
I don't know what his name was.
Is he dead?
I don't know.
The Wilson brothers daddy.
He ought to be.
Imagine.
He was no daddy like Jan and Dean's daddy.
They came out to that end of that concert and started singing and juking and jiving.
And acting like a couple of real clowns.
Like, oh, look at us.
Where the daddy is, Jan and Dean.
Well, big deal.
Jan, very by the way, is still dead.
You wouldn't have driven that damn vet like a lunatic.
How about James Dean?
There's another one.
Drove too fast.
All your kids out there, all your little kids.
When you steal Mama Dad's car in the middle of the night, don't drive it too fast.
So I had an update on something.
Yes.
Today is Mr. Maldon's last day.
Oh, my God.
That is tragic.
We wish all the best.
And I'm sure you'll find a lot of people who are going to be able to do this.
I'm sure you'll find a lot of people who are going to be able to do this.
I'm sure you'll find a lot of people who are going to be able to do this.
I'm sure you'll find a lot of people who are going to be able to do this.
I'm sure you'll find a lot of people who are going to be able to do this.
I'm sure you'll find a lot of people who are going to be able to do this.
I'm sure you'll find a lot of people who are going to be able to do this.
I'm sure you'll find a lot of people who are going to be able to do this.
I'm sure you'll find a lot of people who are going to be able to do this.
One of the nicest people I've ever known in my life.
And I've known a few people in my life.
But that doesn't count for anything when you work for the beesleaks.
When you work in this, what am I told all you people out there?
Oh, do we want to be in radio?
Don't ever be in this business.
And guess what?
As bad as it used to be.
Now it's a thousand times worse.
Now it's a toilet.
It's a disaster.
There is no more radio business.
There's only monkey business.
What?
I'd like to come down there and take a look at the books.
You know what?
I'd like to take a look at the payroll.
I guarantee it within five minutes.
I'd find some people on there.
They'd be out the door faster than you can say.
How's lunch doing?
We got some of the most useless turd burgers hanging around there.
But because they got their nose and other body parts of Clarence's backside.
Breakfast.
They're still running around there causing all kinds of trouble in the being Ojohn Povacatorum.
But the good people, they get, they get a stoch for the holidays.
Isn't this nice?
Three days before Hanukkah and they're showing Ken Maldon the door.
And giving them two weeks' severance.
How generous.
Ooh.
If that email was correct, I don't know.
Did you tell you that he coming in and give everybody a big kiss?
No, he hasn't yet.
Well, that's right.
He's not done until four.
Tragic.
Sad.
Runes my whole week.
Runes the whole month.
Runes my life.
At EK, there's another guy.
Low key.
Never would never heard of fly.
Good guy.
Liked by all.
His show was boring.
But nevertheless, he was, you know, liked by all.
And I guarantee I sure had a bigger number at night than we got now.
He had a bigger number than a point.
He never ever came close to the numbers we're pulling at night.
We're pulling it.
The last since Jolly Joe came on the scene.
But we were doing it tonight.
I wouldn't wish on Hanukkah.
I wouldn't wish it on James Crystal Radio and Steve Lapa.
As Norma Kant once said, Steve Lapa's got the Midas Touch and Reverse.
Everything he touches turns to crap.
Only he didn't say crap.
He said, Schmidt.
Now you're getting me all worked up again.
Why didn't you have to tell me that?
Well, you know, I figured you would want to know that.
To ruin my day.
To get me depressed.
Is that the idea?
And of course you're going to be next.
Not far down the line.
Although you, at least they're not showing you the door.
Not fully.
They should have a picture of the door.
That's kind of like a warm up.
So, when we tell you, this is where you're going.
Yeah, see this door here?
Yeah, here's a picture there.
Does it, does it bring anything to mind?
Oh.
You depressed me.
You say I'm right and then you always second-guess me.
Oh, what a left-down.
You call my hand before I even get my back down.
And when I always on the main.
You seem to get a bad wedding.
Oh, and you do depressed me.
So why am I in love with you?
Oh, and I kiss you.
You never thought it was me, so with your vision.
When you're dead, when there's trouble.
I can be how time to believe me on the double.
When I see you, I fall in love.
So why am I in love?
Covered with love, so with your depressed me.
Why am I in love with you?
In love with you.
When I see you, I fall in love.
So why am I in love with you?
Oh, and you depressed me.
So why am I in love with you?
Oh, and I kiss you.
You depressed me.
You say I'm right and then you always second-guess me.
Oh, and I kiss you.
Oh, and I kiss you.
I leave you back in your car and call it even.
When I'm alone, and by myself.
You say I see you, from on the shelf.
Oh, and you depressed me.
So why am I in love with you?
Amen.
Oh, I got a real doozy.
I got a real doozy.
I hate email coming up.
That's gonna break.

Except in 9-11 when he must have been gone on a bustman's holiday.
Take your card and chubbant.
I ain't gonna work in no more.
Just a year all right.
If you're worthless, because everybody else is wrong.
I'm getting tired of watching people die.
That's the name of any miserable Lord.
But take your card and chubbant.
Deal good.
I ain't worth a bit in no more.
No.
Take your card and chubbant.
I ain't worth a bit in no more.
Trouble one.
We got 70 left.
We started with 80.
We got 70 left.
So we sold 10 for Miami Prime.
All right.
And it's right there on wqm.com.
$60 for 25 bucks.
Great food.
So you guys are telling me?
Yes, very good.
I need a nap.
What?
I need a nap.
$69 left.
State case case.
What do we got here on the emails?
And here's here's somebody trying to be real clever.
And you guys don't know what you're talking about.
It's just me because I'm so negative and hostile.
Which the next email will bear out.
It says, guess your pullbear is not the same thing that the Travel Aliezer magazine survey says year after year.
That the people of Miami are the best looking in the world.
Oh, yeah.
And whoever wrote the articles for Travel Aliezer.
And obviously never got out of Florida.
Right.
I guess maybe those people just stay in a lot.
You know, the really beautiful people on South Florida.
Except for the plastic people on South Beach.
Right.
They're the shut-ins, the beautiful people.
The beautiful people are the shut-ins.
That's right.
They never get out much.
Because they're afraid of the other ones who are out there.
And I don't blame them when you come right down to it.
Now what's the story, Tuber?
You keep a nearby on this total on here?
67.
67.
They're dribbling out.
Slow but sure.
They're dribbling out.
When and out, they're dribbling out.
Now here's one from the Bridge Tender Sun.
Okay.
You are angry.
It says.
Hello, sir.
How can you say that South Florida is angry when you are the angriest of all of us?
Every day you make negative and angry and hateful comments about everything.
Just in the past couple of days, which is good, the Bridge Tender Sun listens every day.
I've heard you say that you hate Billy Joel, Pulp Fiction, the sopranos, the Rangers, Howard Stern,
I don't hate Howard Stern or the Rangers, the callers, the e-mailers, and hundreds of other things.
You've become a hateful, spiteful old queen who's lost touch with reality many years ago.
I don't understand exactly what you do or the point of the show is.
Any moron can read poll results for four hours a day without adding any quality information or advice.
It's time for you to step away from the radio industry.
You, sir, are finished, sir.
You know who this is?
Bridge Tender Jr.
Yeah.
Mirio.
Oh, sir.
You're indeed crazy, Mirio.
Okay.
And Hylia.
That's who that is.
You reach the point where you just know the tone.
Yeah.
And you know who the hell, who the misfit is that wrote this swill.
Even if they change their font.
Oh, yeah, Jay font.
Jay font.
A fan.
A fan.
I'm not the chicken Louisiana.
And I'm not the, yeah, who cares?
You're just an idiot.
See these people think that if they start out by saying, oh, I've been listening to you for years and years,
that that's going to excuse the swill that they write after that.
About how miserable I am and how to live my life and how you want to do the show when you're doing it.
And all this other crap.
66 is what we got.
That's right.
Now he's reading the numbers from the certificates.
Just numbers.
Like the old guy says, all you do is mail it in.
You read numbers numbers.
That was down 20 at six points.
There's another number.
How do you like that?
Mm hmm.
352 votes.
We're going to go away over 400.
I think, but start low.
You know what I mean?
Don't, this time of the year, don't start high with some high ball number.
Got to walk before you can run.
That's exactly right.
I couldn't have said it better myself, although I think I could have.
Other than dumb rude or no speaking English, I found Southamberians generally speaking to me.
Hostile 122.
Let's put beautiful on there.
Okay.
For that smart ass who's going to be, oh, travel leisure magazine.
You're right.
They're the same people who tended to travel to some terrorist countries where you're going to get kidnapped and the butchered and robbed and looked out in the desert to ride.
Hostile 122.
Short tempered 33.
Loud mouth 33.
Attention deficit disorder 30.
And keep in mind, I didn't make up this poll.
Charlie B did.
Although I did at hostile, which is winning hands down Charlie's pants.
What a horrible thought that is.
Slappily dressed 23.
Lazy 23.
Vulgar 19.
Perfect.
We're near to it 17.
Out of shape 15.
Accentric 12.
Snobby 9.
Smelly 6.
Pretentious 5.
And ugly 5.
Beautiful.
Hasn't got on there yet.
You put it on there.
Yep.
We just put it on there and it's going to go zooming to the top.
Is it it?
Oh, yeah.
Out of 357.
Oh, I have a message to pass along.
Yes.
Kenny says thank you for all the kind words and he will be listening every day.
I don't even know what to say.
I don't know what to say.
I mean, really am I to lost for words, but it's just devastating.
Rotten.
I know it's a rotten business and it's a business where they don't care about people, but boy, this is just devastating.
Nasty, unnecessary, uncalled for.
And okay, so they're eliminating the updates.
They can find some other stuff.
They certainly they sure have got some other people on the air.
Many hours a week doing stuff that Kenny could do away superior job here, but nevertheless.
Yeah, he's a real broadcaster and he's not part of the fraternity.
He doesn't have his Jewish nose up clear and says Jewish ass like some people.
I can think of.
I don't want to get bitter about it though because then that the bridge tender junior is going to get all over my ass again.
Yeah, see how you are.
That's me.
Angry bitter old man.
You hate everything and everybody.
You're rotten to the core.
You're this.
You're that.
That's me.
And by the way, you blocked people.
It's really funny because every time I go to the deleted items, there are the emails of some of the block people over and over and I just get rid of them.
Over and over and over.
One thing about that man that they're every single day every minute of every day, putting bridge tender June.
Let me take a look at that phone.
Then I'm going to play bits.
Q.A.M. Hello.
Q.A.M.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh, what's the administration number for the dolphins, the officers?
I haven't got any idea.
This is WQM.
Did you ever hear of us?
9.4.
I'm sorry.
I think that's not a lot of the L.A.
He's going to tell you.
9.5.4.
Oh, okay.
4.5.2.
7.000.
Okay, great. Thanks.
No problem.
Happy holidays.
Bye.
She didn't even say happy holidays or back at you or I'm going to be over.
Bye.
Bye.
Who are you?
Bye.

All like you, like him very much.
This here is the king.
I know I haven't been around for a while,
but I want y'all to know,
what up here in Rock and Roll Heaven,
I'll be thinking of you, this Christmas.
And I have to give y'all a special Christmas message,
a message of peace, like how about a little piece
of that time I go and buy it.
Like I've got a lot.
A lot of old saying,
Christmas is a time of hoot,
a time of joy, a time of roll Heaven.
And I sure would love to take slides
that feature you got there.
Like it, what would you want?
No worry, worry about it.
Oh yeah, Christmas.
Now Christmas to me means family.
And family means friends.
The friends means getting together,
and getting together means eating.
I'll pass me that drumstick, which please.
Well, it's like a remote.
Now just want to say to you right now,
you know, I may be a big star, maybe too big,
but ain't nobody so big,
you can't reach out a helping hand,
or a helping hand.
Well, you can't help me helping those my data's over there,
which I believe is like it.
Like a remote.
Now like I was saying,
ain't nobody so big, you can't stoop to help a friend of me
over the holiday season.
I'm speaking of season.
You won't pass me that soft sugar when you get the chance.
Like it.
Yeah, just, just unscrew the color.
That's right.
Thank you.
I don't know.
So this Christmas, why don't y'all take a tip for more A-O-L-L-Us?
Now, I'll leave those steak tips right where they are.
You know what I mean?
You know what I mean?
I appreciate it, thank you.
I want you to remember,
we're all part of God's great big family.
And you know God made men unto his own image.
And look at the mirror.
I'd have to say God must be a big, big center of the gun.
You know what I mean?
I like you dear.
But I especially want y'all to remember this one last thing.
When y'all that home is Christmas,
stringing that popcorn up on the tree,
save a big, big bowl for the can.
That's your butter, you know what I mean?
I like you dear.
I like you.
I like you, man.
The biggest name.
The best tower.
You know what this is, you know, Roger?
Forty-year-five sixty-q-a-am.
The fourth leader.
So big of a.
The best talent.
It's the D.A. Joe.
We've got three people in here on.
Forty-year-five sixty-q-a-am.
The sports.
What is Play-Po's retreat?
And now the recording stars
who sold more records than the Beatles'
butts car really in the Calseils combined.
No doubt changing.
And I have a feeling.
Something something that I.
Yes.
The immortal deaf tones are back.
And now they're singing all your favorites
just as you'll remember them.
Forty-five.

I swear it had something in your head. So it's the death tone with their unforgettable new album
Songs we know most of volume something
Available now and crackle record and tapes and those compact thing of the bothers
I'll give me no yeah
Hey man, I get right on incredible. Yes
I'm a long time listener. I'm gonna be 50 years old about 10 days. Just want to wish you a Merry Christmas
And I don't know what life would be without you man. I love you. See you
God bless
Reskelt used to say that at the end of every show and I always wondered why why didn't he say that God bless
God bless because it's the PC thing to do right suck up to the latest way back when before he had to be PC, you know
That's why they got to have this getchki come there do the invocation at the inauguration
Just Rick Warren Nazi son of a bitch, but that you know
They want a pander to everybody. They want everybody to feel welcome under the big tent even the Nazis are welcome
So Jimmy syphilitic maybe he'll get a personal invite for a sit down at the inauguration
You think Jimmy syphilis will be there maybe oh well, and I don't think so he's not too fond of Barack Obama
He's not too fond of anybody to the left of a till of the hunt so I don't I don't think he'll be invited. I you're not getting invited Jimmy
378 votes. I think we can make 500 today
That would be quite an accomplishment. Well, he won't play too
Has done a tremendous tremendous amount of good and he has a reputation as a guy who despite his personal views on any issue one way or another
Trying to stand up and reach across with us. Oh my god and curry on MSNBC you crazy bitch and gay marriage
He has unleashed a fire storm and and but that fire storm was with liberals and so just as you just reported earlier
She's interviewing him on MSNBC. They're breathlessly promoting the interview. She's doing with him and she's on there kissing his ass Rick Warren
and curry scurvy curry
conservative, so she probably smells like curry
bitch
Anyways, this goes back. He says I know I wouldn't bother you again
But I had something to say about Ken Muldon. I only ever heard him on updates
Don't know if he had a show or not, but he always did the jobs. He was given flawlessly
He sounded great and not better than any other guy there
He sounds like an older man. Obviously, so it breaks my heart to think these cold heartless bastards would send him packing
That's right. This go these cold heartless bastards. I'm gonna put him out there in the street to freeze his ass off
They have to have room on one of the 30 big O's shows. It's just a real shame
Hope you have a happy holiday Ken and my prayers are with you and your family
Let's start a petition to get him back on says this go
Gornish tellfans this girl that means who ain't gonna do any good with these people right and the court
I guess finally after all these years they find out that Ken was Jewish
Gotta go
Allison Jewish Eddie Kay Jewish Humper Jewish Neil cut a salary and half Jewish
Who else now fat Chris there? He's not Jewish so he gets to stay kind of yeah, he gets a set to stick around a little while
If they found out you were Jewish you'd be out the door already you'd be you that door would hit you in a backside
So fast four meals would have come popping out of your mouth
How you doing on the other way forget all about it down to 60 60 I have to say if you wanted to come and say hello to you before
You know the day was done. Yeah, no, that's okay. He's like I don't want any pomp and circumstance
No, it's just I just want to you know fade away. You're too awkward about it. Yep. Exactly. That's what he said
I feel very awkward is there's nothing
You know and of course he's gonna get that last paycheck. Hopefully are those two weeks whatever
Oh
Talk about and right in the middle of holidays too right in the middle of Chanukas on Saturday and Christmas is a week from today
No, don't don't do that that would be very very awkward and
The pressing sad I thought this was the time of the year. Oh, you know goodwill P. What I said a few days ago
It's the truth. It's not me. I'm not the one who's the sour pus
I'm not the Grinch that stole your happiness. It's all these business people who suck
And when you stop and think of all the millions and millions and millions of dollars
They never lost money on this show. I'll guarantee you that
But all the money they peed away in the rights to the marlins back in the day and the dolphins when they had in the first time
And they were paying way just some exorbitant, you know because Greg Reed wanted to be a big shot. We got to dolphins
You know
Think of the millions of dollars they flush down the toilet. Oh, I don't want to help you
You'll vomit that good. Me or you just head for Miami primal you'll vomit all of that up there
I keep looking at this menu and I you know, it's almost enough to make me wish I was there maybe for an hour good stuff
All these grade
dressings on the salads blue cheese basil vinaigrette raspberry vinaigrette
Pepper corn omission ego is probably smack in his lips right now. They got pepper corn shash
Let's stick on his
Yeah, just stick on Brian Craig's unit
384 on a pool come on. Let's get that 500 day get get it all whipped up
Let's do it for Ken Maulden not that he cares about the pullers unless unless unless the station pays them like a hundred dollars for every vote we get
That would be good. That would be a good parting gift. Remember on an old Hollywood squares with Peter Marshall. Yep. We have parting gifts
And of course the parting gift in all those quicheos were always so cheesy, you know
Oh, yeah
You know like we got a we got a gallon of lint away to put you stick in your closet scratch your move or front of Simonize that repairs
He's always
Isn't he annoying his helmet yes
If he had the cure for a life on there for a dollar I still wouldn't buy just just out of principle because he's so annoying
Billy maize
Oh, that's that scratch on the prestige you on applicator apply and let dry maybe you can tell me how that works
I don't know it feels and seals the scratch and it matches the original color like on your car
dries clear so it's virtually invisible how do they do that? I think it dissolves a little bit of the
paint or whatever around it. Yeah
And uses that but that's just a theory there. I'm just a guest. I don't think he's being his believing because it works instantly
Hey, they're showing it. I didn't have an a scratch like this now watch fix it go to work it feels it it feels it it disappears like magic
Now the scratch has met its match. Oh god
I'll get the butterfly net and go get a catch Billy maize
annoying
In fact, let's do a poll the most annoying TV pitchman of all time is Billy maize there we go
He wins remember one one we've a couple times we've done a poll with only one choice on it
Oh stop already Ed you know I made the bad mistake you know edden for a lot of day who I blocked a long time ago
Yeah, and he sent that thing about god and if it's a job he's a messed up whatever that was not
I made the mistake of saying but I was pretty clever it was cute, you know
It was it was amusing it was right on and so since then he sent like
75,000 boring emails trying to be funny. You're not funny yet. Just go away already. You did your good deed for the day go away
Come and play another day and go the hell away
Jesus God
Six that's 1803.053096 to order yours now
Or do you fix it pro-Simonize and then you know go out and scratch a bunch of people's car and I want to get all up
Said say oh don't worry and you whip out your Simonize thing there your little uh you yeah
Looks like a magic marker and then you just smear it across in the paint like magic
Where's that magic one you got
Oh
There it is just like magic the douse down 38 points
Just give a bunch of numbers just to piss off those people's sour pushes out there
Let me say it again the price of the show is perfect it cost you nothing if you like it great
If you hate it, but it's still certainly you know it it fills your SNM need every day great keep listening
But quit with a wha that's in fact that should be a New Year's resolution
A lot of you should make quit complaining and griping quit with the what is it complaints in the critiques right
For the New Year enough
Confession what I just want to say confetching
Yeah, quit enough of the kveching that's right
Enough of the kveching and then this jackass telling you all about your life and about what and how me how to do the show
That's right. He don't know what it means because he's a real goyish of cup, but he's got hootsbar
Does he have a lot of hootsbar?
Oh drew Peterson's engage who the hell is that?
If he on say is 23 years old the same as his missing wife Stacy. Do you know who that is?
Oh, is that the dude that uh they think killed his wife right the pregnant wife with the boat?
Oh, that's an old story man god Scott Peterson wasn't it? Yeah, that this isn't the same one
So I was another Peterson the story that he's going after a divorce uh two or three weeks ago
He's a suspect of death
He wants to be happy and move on with his life the bitches dead now he wants to move on and find out what some other hot piece you

That may qm.com. They're on there 60 to go
David in L.A. says what?
It's David in Los Angeles. Been listening to you since my parents had you on in the 70s one of the
Highlights in coming home to Miami for my visits was listening to wq. I'm hearing you the Humper etc
What is that station doing?
It kind of reminds me of fox like who made a rarity in hand of these so important
Where do these morons come from the same goes for sports radio in Miami the bigos do gods who are these people?
Hank Goldberg was involved in somewhere another with the Miami dolphin for almost 40 years
Eddie was on the air forever as was maulden what the hell is going on down there
It's the radio holocaust David David by the way his last name is good steam so he can relate oh
Happy Chinooka by the way David
Anyway, a happy healthy holiday to you as I remember you're saying back in the day may let go come and carry all of us away
That's right. Let's go funeral part of our wonder if they're still in business. It's a dying business
Would you think that would be a pretty good business to be in even even if you have no money life? That's right
Everybody's going
It's right. It's a sure thing
It's a camp miss
That's what's going on David
Sad and tragic the demolition it's and of course you know they the excuse will be oh everybody's doing it budget cuts look at the other uh, well
That's true
I mean we sure got a lot of spots unless we're doing a dollar a holler we got spots Joe Rose does more spots in five minutes and most people doing a lifetime
Am I right? Yep
He's got spots in his eyes. He's got spots in his rectum and I hear spots on his uh, you know what is Vastelforce what now
You know what it is. I don't that's that's what that means. Oh, it's an expression for now that on a bet
What you just said there? Vastelforce
Vastelc what
Vastelforce you know what it is okay
That's an expression for dinging I see
Vastelforce
Wow, unless my father made that up. I don't know my parents used a lot of really strange jatish words. I'm sure he didn't make it up
That's what's happening. It's a very sad and I you know something I don't see
By the way, beautiful's got five votes
It's in last place, but it's got five votes. Oh the people that might be the most beautiful anywhere in the universe sure they are
Maybe it maybe ten of them
And
Where are they talking about they must be talking about South Beach. They're sure and also the Gailoree in for Lauderdale
I told you that time I went there with the professor for what was the restaurant. Oh, I just the steakhouse. Okay
Come on you can go. I don't know
It was very good, but anyway the people in there the living and breathing beautiful people in that mall just shocked the cramp out of me
I squatted right there in the mall and dropped a low. I thought oh my god
Yeah
What the hell was the steakhouse?
It was very good. It was no more. It was no more. It was no more. It was no worth Chris
You don't know how to wow capital grill. There you go see leave it to the old queen man. I haven't lost it completely mostly
Oh, and here's a joke
Oh
Should I read it? We haven't had a good joke on here. It's a good long. No. Well read it then we'll decide if it's good
Well, I don't have time to read it off the air. Let me just print it out
Because you know what will happen. This will start a this will start a whole which I wasn't gonna even say anything else the rest of the show
I was gonna do from now till Christmas just you know play the rack
407 on Chris's pool. We're gonna do 500 day if it's the last damn thing we do
Got to really get a big push on though. You got to get up to about like 450 by one o'clock time is a wasted man
Let me just ask you let me ask you this what
How would you like to be the person who sat down with Ken Maulden and said we're gonna have to let you go
No, thank you. How would you like to have been that person? I would not
other than falling
face down into a filled toilet
How can you think of anything more distasteful more disgusting more unacceptable on a human level
As mr. Eagle would say on a visceral level
I can't know how how how could you anybody even do that? I just can't even imagine it
So
Anyway, here's the joke
The man him opened the brothel door and Winnipeg and saw rather dignified well-dressed good looking man in his late 40s early 50s
I help you sir. She asked I want to see Valerie the man replied
Sir Valerie is one of our most expensive ladies perhaps you'd prefer someone else said the madam
No, I must see Valerie he replied
Just then Valerie appeared announce to the man she charged
$5,000 a visit without hesitation the man pulled out five grand gave it to Valerie and they went upstairs after an hour the man calmly left
Next night the man appeared again once more demanding to see Valerie
Valerie explained that no one ever come back to knights in roach. He was too expensive
But there were no discounts the price was still five grand
Again the man pulled out the money gave it to Valerie. They went upstairs after an hour he left
The following night the man was there again
Everyone was astounded that he'd come for a third consecutive night, but he paid Valerie
They went upstairs after their session Valerie said to the man nobody has ever been with me three nights in a row
Where you're from the man replied?
Ontario
Really she said I have family in Ontario
I know the man said your sister died. Now I'm her attorney. She asked me to give you her $15,000 inheritance
Ha ha
The moral of the story is three things in life first certain death taxes and being screwed by a lawyer
Was it worth it?
No, whatever it's the holidays. Oh I see for some other words you're cutting of some slack because it's the holiday
Absolutely look at that phone man. That is a door nail like somebody disconnected all the aligns
I think that'll be next
Phone fave talk radio listen don't give them any ideas. Yeah. Oh, well, let's at least disconnect
Have we already done that what line nine?
No, not line nine, but it seems to me that we've already disconnected something we are missing one that line eight has never lit up
Really line eight. Let me try it
Oh, that's right. It's a there's no that's the one they got rid of that line
Sure, you were to line eight why not the other ones oh
PR Ralph is back here this Christmas. I'm putting missile toe in my back pocket
So all the people wait me can kiss my ass
Oh
buddy, yeah
That's real funny when I heard that in grade school. Yeah, 100 years ago
Furkey says happy holidays to you and your listeners and George of course

Being in the tax bracket that you and being that you are and being someone appreciates a good bowel movement
Let me recommend something that every man of mean should experience
During my many visits to Japan. I found myself on the total toilet for over an hour to time
It's well-mounted with keyboard control water preheat and self-cleaning
Paul Sating nozzle are a sensation. It's on par with the greatest sexual experiences
They run about a grand but are worth every penny
The total toilet
Okay, I got news for you Carl
When the day comes that I have money to buy a total toilet. I mean, I got plenty of money
But when the day comes that I've got that much money. I have somebody else wipe my ass. How do you like that?
There you go
Yeah
the total toilet
On a par with the greatest sexual experiences
This guy is definitely a nice man
Am I right? Sounds like it
Who was it that though we worked with who was big into that whole high-colonic crap if you put in an expression
I don't know some young punk was a JC. I don't know always running to get his
Uh, uh, uh, colonization. Oh that that was then on him. No. Why is that under JC? That was ponytails Jeff. Come on. I wanted it
Yeah, that was JC
Wanted to move into my house
Please watch this video during the break you can see Drew Care's reaction to a perfect bid. It's a short video
Says Brandon if anything if anybody else would have sent this I wouldn't watch it
But I trust Brandon and the problem is the link doesn't work
youtube.com watch the link doesn't do anything
Okay, I tried Brandon. Oh no, in fact my my computer just froze up from that
Oh, no, here's the link it works the prices right exact showcase bid
Drew Carey blows on that show. Oh there you go again. You don't like anybody. I like Bob Barker. Just fine
Drew Carey is so
inappropriate for that that show somebody made an exact bid you know at the end of the show when you have to bid on the showcase
And the dark-complexed chick
She missed by 494 bucks and the guy the cracker guy
Well, this is law it better be really good Brandon
He bid 23,743 and the actual price
Right on the right on the money. How could you do that?

Well, you can listen nobody's perfect once in a while even Brandon's gonna send a clicker
Well fake fake Barry Jackass is back. I think one to two hour. We're gonna like play stuff
Ooh Pete Wentz reveals way too much to Howard Stern by Vicki Hyman the star ledger
Remember Bobby Hyman that's way before your time from the dating club whatever that was no the mating game Bobby Hyman
Boy, they hated me when I was doing a mating and dating show on the Ws news
And I got a lot of couples married and we had picnics and all kinds of stuff and people meeting and getting together and
Everybody who was in the dating club business man a hated me like poison because I was hurting their business
Huh, because it was for free. Oh, how dare you yeah, so we were stepping on their toes
I don't see any expression on Drew Carey's face. That's why he sucks on that show
The guy gave the exact price of the a showcase
443 votes on a pool. I think you got a real shot of 500 if you keep pushing it mr. Fat
You're gonna push it definitely
Maybe we need one of them Japanese toilets. No, thank you
Ha ha ha ha
I'll tell you one thing most of the people in management in this business need one of those because they're really full of it
They got a lot of
Experiment to get rid of
fakeberry jackass says
Pete Wentz reveals way too much to Howard Stern
We've read many and unsafe everything and pursued a first celebrity dirt
But we did not get paid enough to read past this headliner on huffing and post
Hugh Hefner I almost swallowed the sex toy we didn't however read about Pete Wentz growing about his amazing sex life
Uh with wife and new mom actually Simpson to Howard Stern and quickly wished we hadn't
But our philosophy is that spreading the misery makes it thinner for yourself. So here it goes
If he and Simpson fit on the show last year went says they probably would be doing it in the green room right now
The basis revealed that the couple who married and made currently do not have sex because of the reason birth
But do other fun stuff such as
She gives me loving
Laptances. She gives a mean lat dance. He said she wears songs and sexy clothes
Those lat dancers not to mention sex were a long time coming for wince who admitted he pursued the singer for while before
She finally hooked up with him their first time the best section on counter I've ever had was at New York
Soho Grant hotel he says
I'm looking in the mirror thinking oh my god. You're banging the girl of your dreams and you can watch yourself
He said
Other golden nuggets of information. We probably should not know included Simpson's pregnancy weight
150 pounds, which is now blazing off her her broad-prey size and post pregnancy
Seacup but I think with a breast milk hits a D and how wince would have considered a threesome with Ashley and Jessica 20 years back
Ironically at the start of the interview the 29 year old noted that his wife ordered him not to say anything
Crummy about me on stir and show oops
Do you do find this interesting not at all or uh, you know spicy?
You know
Whatever
None of those things no
Ranchi racy and and keep in mind. This is on uncensored radio. Yeah. Yeah
Whoopee this here
Yeah
The fake berry jackass there's one for you. There's another one just like Bernard gets on the subway
There's another one for you fake berry
I guarantee you the real berry jackass would never send me anything like that never
Don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again
Ever thousand thirty six points
No more emails no calls
one to two hour
Stuff
Right, I mean it's a week before Christmas right much longer before than usual
But that was back in the day when we really had an audience don't forget that trend comes out 10 o'clock tomorrow morning
Oh
The fourth lead
The biggest name
You're listening to sports radio 560 wq a.m. I am a for the other day
The one to two hour
Oh
Our
and those that singing, Jesus truly did us from when he made the same
this song. We may not the hair lift angel sing.
For me, you're the new one king.
One o'clock at 560 WDQ at Merry Christmas. Happy Tinnokka. All these things.
All of these things. That's right. Although I don't see any holiday greetings from too
many people on our emails today, you know, or on the phone. Oh, well, or anywhere else.
Now they want to know why? That's South Florida for you. We got 57 left on the
certificates for Miami Prime Grill. We sold 23. Pretty weak, if you ask me.
Mm-hmm. Excellent food. Great location, right? Perfect for dating, Broward.
But nevertheless, 455 votes on Fat Chris's pool. If we get to 500, he is going to be,
he's going to go naked right into Joe Bell's office and demand this thing.
No, it's a good thing he's not here to hear that. Oh, where'd he go?
He ran out, so I don't know where he went. He ran out. Maybe too much food there today.
Maybe? We did eat a lot. Maybe he's looking for him to those Japanese turlits.
Now you're into all things Japanese with that scene student you had a couple years ago.
Yeah. Wouldn't you ever hear that fancy toilet? They got a lot of fancy things in Japan.
They're way ahead of us. Really? So maybe not by that name, but yeah, I mean,
I've signed it on a documentary as all the kind of weird toilets they have in Japan.
Robo toilets. You know what the kind of, what's his name? Fort Lauderdale, Jim Noggle?
Is that his name with the Robo toilets? Yeah, it's the Nazi Mary. Yeah.
Things like that. Maybe Barack could invite Jim Noggle to speak too, along with Rich Warren
at the inaugural thing. Brandon says I sent that video because it was the first time in
37 years and over 6,000 shows that it would ever happen there was an exact bit on the showcase.
And to Drew Carey, he could cure less and was more expressionless than ever before.
See, I was looking for an expression and there wasn't any. And that was the point.
I mean, what are the odds of anybody just guessing it right to the dollar?
Right to the dollar. Right. And the other chicks, you only missed her showcase by 454 bucks,
and I'm sure she thought, I want, I want, you know, like guaranteed it's, it's in.
It's a done deal. Guess what, bitch? I'm sorry, she might be a very nice lady.
Don't call her bitch. See, there you go again, you can't help yourself because you're so angry and
hostile and nasty. And it's got nothing to do with the fact that you talk to these A-holes in
South Florida for 33 years. The negativity is just overwhelming. It's just it's not drowning in
a sea of negativity when you're dealing with a South Florida audience, drowning in a sea of
negativity. Oh, it's your fault, Neil. Yeah, I invented it. I created it. Did the tummy come back?
Yes. Yeah, I'm here. I'm sorry. And what was I saying about him that he wouldn't want to hear?
Oh, I put it out of my head. Something grows with Joe Bell or something.
Yeah, there was, that was not that. It was disgusting. You just made that up.
It was gross. I forgot what it was too. Filthy.
It was not filthy. We're not allowed to do so much mootsy, much less real filthy anymore.
You should know that Joe says I have to use a new way to get your show work watches are internet
use. AM is nothing but buzz and static from the equipment interference. So I got a smart phone
from me and TNT with Windows Mobile 6.1. I can click on your website, stream over the phone
and Windows Media Player Mobile. For all the people who bitch they can't listen. If there's a
will there's a way. Thanks, Joe. There's a guy that makes the effort. Right. And admits it. He
admits he listened to the show and goes out of his way to do it as opposed to
at retire. You're all done. You're all washed up. You old fossil.
I'm sure that those are coming from Howard Davis across the street or maybe from Howard David.
Did you ever, did you ever think about that? Absolutely. That's the first time I've ever
done on me that somebody evil like Mo Howard David might be sitting around. What else is
you got to do? Yeah, I don't think I don't think so. No, little too much imagination, you know.
Little too much humor. Little too much work. Well, what else has you got to do for crying out loud?
Pick Dingo berries. Pick Dingo berries and Voka? Where else? Maybe they're having a big sale.
Well, I want to think about picking Dingo berries. That's what they grow their thickest.
That's sex. Yeah. Well, I tell you that that was the bad mistake blowing him out.
We couldn't have done much worse between two and four if he'd have stuck around if they'd
kept him around. Told you it was like a human battering ram. Not just for me, but for everybody.
Right? Am I right? Yep. There was there was some excitement. There was like a certain something.
A little something something. Yeah, a little something something there with him. Now,
how do you know? Who did Mo for Q.A.M. Mo Howard David or what's his name? Jerks.
Wow, we're still bouncing back from that or at least trying to. We'll find out tomorrow morning
if there's any bounce. I feel like a lifetime ago already. I beg your pardon. It's almost like he
was never here. Who? Jerk? How about that? Yeah. Was that him? Where's that guilty? That was him?
Yeah. No, play that. Come on that shit. No, not that. How about that?
That sounds like guilty. Nevertheless. Do you think Chris that sounds like guilty? Not at all.
Are you crazy? Maybe, but it doesn't sound like guilty. Same. How about that? See, I know that's him
because we recorded it while he was sitting right in front of me. Really? Yeah. Jerks? Yes.
My good friend Jason Jackson. Oh, man. Wow. Look, I told you we got along. We got along great. We never had a
cross word off the air. Yeah, you said the same thing about Rick Riley. Then the last couple days
you've been ripping him an ass. I had not contradicted anything I've ever said about Rick Riley.
Oh, no, what is this? Feel the fake fill Henry is back again? Not funny fake fill. Not funny at all.
But I'll print it out. I mean, there's nothing else on there. I just don't want to play bits
the whole hour because it's a week before Christmas and all through the house. Not even a
house. Isn't that the way that went? Not even lower. We're talking about a lot of losses yesterday.
Lices and Lusai. Very, very weak. 463 votes. We need 37 an hour. No problem. Easy. Pickens. How the
how we're going to do 500 today must be a great poll, huh? Yep. Beautiful's got 12, by the way.
Generally speaking, the people of South Florida are beautiful. They're lovely.
I just don't I guess when I'm down there driving around, I just don't see those people. I see all,
all people that make me feel like I'm a like a child. Yeah. That's a bad luck. Is that it? Must be.
Here's one that says from the fake Mr. Ego. Oh, yeah, by the time I make believe in. Not not funny.
Paul in LA. Not funny, Paul, from the fake Mr. Ego. Happy holidays to you though, but
thanks so much for a real feeble attempt. Well, what have I always said? Nothing worse in the world
than people trying to be funny who are not. Yuck, yuck, yuck. You know what I mean? Mm-hmm.
And so many of those people rolling around on the ground. WQA Am hello.
Hello. You can tell there's somebody there because you heard the back. Hello. QYM hello.
I think it's really sad. Oh, no. Oh, no. Not a week before Christmas. It's really sad. Oh, no.
I just think in the morning for years back when it was. I said, what? I said, how you doing?
I'm doing fine. How you doing? Okay. Happy holidays to you. Yeah. Yeah. May next year be a good year for
everybody. Mm-hmm. Look out now. My, my, my, I'll tell, I'll tell Ken you sent your regards. Have a great day.
You too. They want to bring back that wording. Bye. That'd be fun. Bye. Bye, Mike. Bye, Mike.
Bye, bye. Bye, bye. Oh. What are you laughing about? You're suggesting bastard? Yeah, that's right. WQA Am hello.
That's from me. Just coming by, baby. Yeah. Who cares? Screw him. QA Am hello.
You ain't deaf, honey. Anymore either, dude. Yeah, no, but you're listening. Yeah, you're listening. WQA Am hello.
I'm holding it for a year, Mark. Oh, she'll be on a half an hour.
That was Joe doing a voice. That was Jolly Joe. He said that he's holding it for a year, Marks.
Only she'd rather have her hold it for him. QA Am hello.
Well, I won't just happen with the phone there. I don't know. Look at that. My, my, my, my, ask you.
QA Am hello. Hola. QA Am hello. Hey, I'm Cornel. Yep. I always you guys are happy holidays.
You're yours in the crew. Have a good one. Okay, you too. Bye. Well, let's not have like a whole week of that.
I mean, it's pleasant, you know, but, oh, you know what I mean? Yeah. Happy holidays.
Happy holidays. Happy holidays. That was down 30 red points. Let's see if there's any emails pouring in. Sure, there are. Here you go.
Oh, no, Adam again. Go away, Adam. I'm going to come to Kitchen Waterloo and track your fat ugly ass down and just take a whoop into you.
Oh, the fake Phil Henry says that can't be me check the email address.
Yes. I'm listening. Wouldn't it be something if it was the real Phil Henry? But of course, you know, it's not right.
What would be a code that he could write in that only Phil would know? I don't know, but somehow you would know.
But here's another way that you would know. Yes, he won't write you an email. Oh, the fake podcast and over is back to it's most still on serious NFL radio. I have no idea.
Sam Rosen who called it off in 49ers game on Fox Town just like Mo that is true. Only Sam's a nice guy. I'm told with a much bigger schnauz. Oh, he had to say this, you know, because we can't control the jeans that created the way we were born looking. Right. Sam Rosen could be the ugliest human on the face of the year.
What was the guy's name on happy days? Al.
Okay.
You know, with the big nose and the big head. The guy that ran the diner. Yeah. That's what Sam Rosen looks like. Wow.
And he's got the real New York, Julie Sound, you know, but he's good. He does the ranges ranges.
And he does one NFL game every week. You know Sam Rosen, right? The tummy. Yeah, some kind of this weekend. You saw him? Well, yeah, on the broadcast.
Am I right about his appearance? I would love to tell you, but the TV that I have in this room. Kind of blurry.
Really? Yeah. Oh, you don't have the cables not working again. No, the cable's fine. The TV. Don't say the cables fine because they'll have that disconnected. No time.
I'm amazed that they haven't stopped paying that bill. That generally is part of the course. Am I right? Yep.
And we're all the times. Oh, cables out. Oh, they didn't pay the bill. We got to go to accounting and see if we can get that cable turned back on.
Let's turn on ESPN. Oh my god. It's a blank freaking screen.
Somebody said it's a bag of money.
The 560 QA and the sports leader. We're going to get Ricky a blow.
Yeah, Steve.
Get off. Wait. Get the double record. Push the kid and cuss the cash here.
After this, I'll need a cool beer.
Sing it. Hell's up. You want your little brass? That makes us any happy for me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Where do you get my age? All of sudden Christmas is 19th December,
Bobby, Chris and six months to pay it off. Hey, you. I saw that place. Hey, give it back right now before I shut my
boot as far as your lies of them. No. Yeah. Oh, how do you do?
Hey, miss, how can that possibly be out of stock? Do you people realize there's more than one customer who might want to buy it
special? Where's the manager? I'm the manager. You got a problem.
I only wish the happiest of holidays to you and your.
Kids, come here. Come here. Come here. You'll be saying, okay? Yeah, yeah.
I gotta get out of here. Very Christmas. Yeah.
Yeah. Well, it's gonna be a long drive home.
118 at 560 WQ. I got an interrupt. I was gonna play like a bunch of those, but I got something too important.
Well, then late on us. Brandon sends me this to risk from Port Saint Lucie. Police are seeking an arrest warrant for a man accused of
hitting his wife after she asked to smell his penis to determine whether he was cheating with another woman.
Okay. The 37 year old victim told investigators her husband of three years punched her face and kicked her arms and legs
Monday night after she accused him of having an affair. The victim said she told her 25 year old husband as he used the
restroom to display his penis to her so she could smell it. She said she asked him to show his genital area so she
could determine whether he was cheating with another woman. As she went to sniff her husband's penis,
he reportedly punched her mouth and started to kick her when she was on the floor. The husband then fled the scene.
Police saw bruises and red marks on the victim's mouth legs and arms. She became uncooperative when told the warrant would be filed for her husband's arrest.
Ain't that something bust? Can I smell it, honey? Oh, you can always tell by the smell. Is that it?
What do you use? That's swell. I
Luis says the reason Drew Kerry had no reaction in that clip is because there was a 30 to 45 minute wait while they verified the guy wasn't cheating because
obviously they taped the show, but even so. I
mean, would you show like some reaction like, huh? Raise your eyebrows a little. Right. Do something act like you're going to have a
BM or something, anything? Start jiggling that big public around anything Drew, but he's he's like a statue.
Totally unfit for that show. Q. I. Am hello.
Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, how's it going, man? Okay. Have you guys kind of a chance to check out the movie doubt?
No, the one with Philip Seymour case of Catholic priest and Mel Street. No, it's being highly touted.
Say why no? It's being highly touted. Yeah, man. It's a good move. It kind of drags on a little bit, but it's good movie on nominets.
Anyway, there's a there's a part in it, man. We're
going to see more tells Mel Street. Well, there are no facts in the church. Okay.
Yeah, I guess that's it. That was it. That was the punchline and then click run away. Click run away. Let me go turn the radio off.
Naomi on the radio. See if it was as bad on the radio as it was live.
You don't have to listen. It was Q. I. Am hello. Hello. Yes, sir.

I wasn't really paying attention because I didn't care. They got swept. You ever have sweeps? Yes.
They were swept. They lost. They blew it. They stunk the joint out. They choked. They gagged. They puked all these people with their teams.
You know, it is one thing to use. They religion is a weapon. These people use their sports teams as a weapon. Ranges. Ranges.
I think that that's a by part of the station that we're on. You know, yeah, a bunch of so called adult men who still are like in their
infancy. They're looking their childhood. They still run around with their baseball caps on, you know, backward sideways.

This is called a cradle.
You spin it in the seaward lands.
And you sing this song.
I have a little cradle.
I made it out of clay.
And when it's done ready, with cradle I shall play.
Oh, cradle, cradle, cradle, cradle.
I made you out of clay.
Traddle, cradle, cradle, cradle, with cradle I shall play.
Now you try it.
I've just been in with your fingers like this.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hello, hey.
Up the sun, like all the wind.
Clean, came down the way, then washed his fire out.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
Oh, hey, Carmen, we're playing trails.
You want to try?
Sure.
Here's a little cradle that's not in made of clay.
But I'm not going to play with it because Traddle's
fucking gay.
Hey, shut your mouth, fat ass.
Two.
Play stupid games.
Two.
That's why they're little, cradle, cradle.
Do I made you out of clay?
Play stupid, cradle, cradle, cradle, cradle.
Two with cradle I shall play.
That's why they're named.
What's going on?
Oh, it's that Hanukkah thing.
It's so amazing.
He's spin this thing on the ground and it does.
Man, he man, I could watch it.
Oh, dear, let me try it.
I'll try to make it spin.
It fell while try again.
Oh, cradle, cradle, cradle, cradle.
I like naked light of clay.
Traddle, cradle, cradle, cradle.
Well, try to like something.
Oh, cradle, cradle, cradle, cradle.
Two with naked light of clay.
Play stupid, cradle, cradle, cradle, cradle.
Two with cradle I shall play.
That's why they're named.
Oh, cradle, cradle, cradle.
Play stupid, cradle, cradle, cradle, cradle.
Two with cradle I shall play.
That's why they're named.
Hello, boys.
Hi, Mom.
Oh, how precious.
You boys are all playing traitles.
Now, you know that cradle is a time
on a tradition for the Hebrew people.
Yes, we know this, but as he is still very interesting.
Now, when you want to make a cradle spin,
you'll know a people who always went to spinning car.
To make a cradle spin, you'll see the game.
I'll take the whole way to win.
That's why they're named.
Oh, hi, Dad.
Hello, everybody.
Say, can I join in?
Sure.
I have a little cradle.
I need it out of play.
And when it's dry and ready, with cradle I shall
everybody, cradle, cradle, cradle.
Yeah, I need it right away.
Different, different, different, different.
Oh, cradle, cradle, cradle.

That's why they're named.
Oh, cradle, cradle, cradle.
Yeah, I need it right away.
Different, different, different, different.
Can you hold cradle, I shall play.
Courtney Cox, I love you.
You're so hot on that show.
Dad?
Courtney Cox.
Dad?
We're singing about a cradle.
Oh, sorry.
We'll talk about this later, Joe.
Oh, baby, baby, baby.
How long will it take?
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby.
You'll be great, baby, baby.
You'll be great, baby, baby.
You'll be great, baby, baby.
You'll be great, baby.
You'll be great, baby.
Yeah, I'll play.
133, QM, my printer ain't doing nothing.
Oh, here it is, finally.
Oh.
Well, it took a little rest, man.
I'm printing out a whole bunch of crap here lately,
you know?
I sure hope that these damn things don't break.
We got five years and the two weeks to go, right?
Not that I'm counting or anything like that.
I was looking at the bottom of our website
this morning where Erick's got time left on Neil's contract,
you know, and it says five years, zero months,
and you know, so many days.
What are we going to do when Neil retired?
What are we going to do when George retires?
I think somebody, I mentioned this before, it didn't work.
Once upon a time at WS News, we had a sales guy.
I forget the name, it's just as well, who was a thief.
And he met somebody, some woman.
I forget whether it was from my dating show
or somehow, some listener, some old lady,
with lots and lots of cash.
He was a young guy like in his 20s, you know?
And he started whining and dining her
to try to grab onto her cash.
Really though?
Yeah.
Had her put him in his will and all this other crap
until finally she, you know,
somebody clued her in that this was a scam artist.
Sales guy, well, I figured, maybe it was Andrew
in another life.
A nice job by the way today, Andrew, not,
or at least he got you guys the food anyway.
Yes he did.
How many of those certificates we got left?
Tubby.
We have 53.
53, so that's not so bad.
We sold, that's not so good.
27.
Fake Barry Jackass says, oh, but anyway,
let me get to my point.
And that is that all these years I've been on here
and I mentioned this a couple of times before.
You'd think that there'd be somebody wealthy, you know,
some old goofball guy lady with millions of dollars
without without any relatives, you know,
maybe they outlived their relatives who never had any,
never got married, whatever, some old queen.
Yeah.
And after maybe 30 years of listening to the show
would leave me in their will and leave me like,
you know, 10, 20 million bucks.
That would be the thing.
Sure.
Never happened.
Not even a dime.
Oh, the money you're making.
Well, you know, money I'm making is okay,
but I mean, you know, I had 20, 30 million.
And I could tell these people were to slam it,
slam a jam it, take that pig skin and stuff it.
You ever have that stuffed pig skin?
No, not lately, a little wish.
You know what I'm saying?
Never happened.
Right?
Yes, that goes back to this hostile bit again.
You know, they don't love me.
They don't love.
River.
Didn't live you.
So the fake Barry Jackass says, sorry about that.
That was rather boring.
I'll wait till I have some better material next time.
We'll be at the touchdown club today.
I went to Johnny F and Rocket today for lunch,
had the patty melt it was great.
Well, good for you, fake Barry.
I know it's not the real Barry,
because mommy packs him a bag lunch.
She packs him a salami and Swiss sandwich on rye.
It's trache, but that's okay.
He's like a smaller version of the beast,
Barry Jackass and an equally annoying.
The fake podcast, Ranova says,
I wanted to give the new Phil Henry a spin,
especially since Manny had hooked me up with some old Phil tapes.
You know, Manny?
Yes.
I know Manny doesn't think Phil is relevant anymore.
And since I've been listening to the radio recently,
I wanted to see how bad Phil sure really was.
How the mighty have fallen, it says, are you sure?
That's what fake Paulie says.
By the way, Paulie is going to have a big snow storm here tomorrow.
Gonna be bad.
Gonna be like 10 to 20 centimeters.
Not good.
But right now it's a little murky and minus three.
Not so bad.
It's going to get bad though.
It's going to be snowmageddon.
They're calling it big storm tomorrow and another one on Sunday.
Anyway, it says don't get me wrong.
It's an okay show, meaning Phil.
It's just that it can't compare to his old shows.
And it simply is not funny.
He's too calm, too balanced, lacks innovation.
In short, it was a boring show.
Phil spent most of the show talking about Obama and from voters
to be smart and not to listen to the talking heads.
A large section of the show is devoted to an unemployed worker who had called in.
Phil also talked about the definition of socialism for a long time,
even at a caller who lived in Sweden promoting socialism.
There was some focus on how the media likes to focus on Sarah Palin's expensive wardrobe
as opposed to the other players in this political game.
I laughed twice, but my laughter was a quick giggle.
He used his veteran voice and called himself to complain about Obama saying
he was a better dancer than McCain.
Secondly, he played the now infamous Obama Robo call where the person on the recording
is named something that sounds like Jerry Watermelon.
In terms of satire, parody comedy and the passive aggressive social commentary
that made Phil Henry the most creative voice on the radio waves, none of that was here.
None. Are you sure positive says Paulie?
He pretty much had a show by giving his take on the linked drudge report articles.
Phil has passed his prime.
I'll be passing on any new Phil Henry shows.
Maybe one day was she'll see the return of the real Phil with all of his sock puppet voices.
How do you like that?
Fake Paulie cashed in over with the Phil Henry review.
And I'm sure the fake Phil will probably respond when you think.
Right. See, the one thing about all of us on the year, we are making a living.
Some of us more so than others, but that's what it's all about.
I mean, the business blows.
And of course, when you sell out to the far right and then you try to like wiggle back,
oh, it Obama's great in the idea.
There's something called credibility that isn't there anymore.
You know, it just is lacking.
It's like when some ex-jocke goes on here and starts spewing right wing political crap like Jimmy Cifalitic.
Somehow they're just something lacking there, something missing like credibility perhaps.
Hey, Jimmy.
The best talent you don't give me a Rogers.
Fort like your five sixty QAM.

No.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I feel like it's the full of you
I figure since we got Connick had come up together on Saturday
Might as well get some juice stuff in there first, right?
Right?
Well, why not?
What do you think?
Do it in order.
And then we get all the goeshes stuff in there all next time.
That's right.
Oh.
Maybe it's just me.
And of course now I don't really care anymore.
I'm oblivious.
I'm an adult.
I'm an old fossil.
But in my youth, there was never any time of the year when it was more distinct, the different
between Jews and Christians, than this time of the year.
Not so much anymore.
What do you mean by that?
It's kind of all wrapped up together now.
You see all the decorations together.
There's rarely a store that you don't see a menorah, you know, and all that stuff in
the...
Cana horror.
They were displaying a menorah.
If they got a bazza on the door.
Probably.
Ask Isidora.
She'll tell you.
Rae says, I agree with you about all the negativity.
This is me.
We'll only contain positive ideas.
Misspelled.
Sorry, Rae.
There's only one S in positive.
Boy, I just...
I don't know what it is with you folks.
Rae says, the economy positively sucks.
My paycheck positively sucks.
Joyce and Jolly Joe positively blow.
The traffic in this blowhole town is positively awful.
Also Misspelled.
I'm positive that no matter what else happens, I'll keep us new in the erogies.
And then Rae says, oh!
Okay, no, no demirror points for the Misspellings Rae.
Sorry.
And I didn't have to point that out.
It's just that I'm a cruel, meanhearted old bastard.
And it's because I've worked in Florida for 33 years in South Florida.
That'll do it to me.
It makes you that way.
When you're in an area like here, like I've told you before, I'm very polite.
I hold a door for people.
How's it going?
You know, I mean, not overly, but...
Yeah.
You say, hey, a lot?
No.
I never say it.
I only say it on the air.
Hey.
How's it going, hey?
I really wonder what the origins of that are.
Oh, like anything.
They probably wonder what the origins of our figures of speech are.
No, but hey isn't the figure of speech.
It's an affectation.
Right, but people say, yes, no, with the end of sentences.
Yeah, to talk to you.
Oh, yes, it was that kid, but he kept saying the same word.
And you were going nuts like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, you know, and then he said something we had a dump there at the end.
I forget I started with an F, I think.
Yeah, it was like profane, you know.
Oh, you hear that?
The sirens are out there.
We're going to come to get us because you said some profanity crap.
Well, we got a nasty snowstorm coming tomorrow.
Not going to be a good day for people traveling tomorrow.
Oh, my God.
It's going to be blowing snow and drifting and like, oh, nasty.
I'll stay in though.
So like this afternoon tonight, I'll get my last, my last taste of woodman for a couple days.
Okay.
Either that or I'll take a helicopter over the weekend.
Okay.
I'm not one of those people.
I mean, I enjoy going there.
I do pretty well lately, not gone something, but I'm not one of those people that's going to risk my life to go gamble.
Okay.
In fact, I'm trying to think, are there many things in the world that I would risk my life traveling in horrendous brutal weather conditions to, you know, the pot at the end of the rainbow?
You know what I'm saying?
I mean, even some wild sexual experience with somebody incredibly hot.
You know what?
I mean, how good could it be?
I don't know.
You know, you know what I'm saying?
Yes, I do.
Is it worth risking your life for?
Yes.
Get out of here.
You're a crazy person.
Well, that's a fact.
You are crazy.
Well, yeah, look at your situation.
Every time I get depressed a little bit, I think about all poor George.
Poor George.
Every time I get depressed, I think of these e-mailers.
Here's one.
Here's one that says someone called into the labaster show the other day, inquired if the rumor was true, that labaster during 65 grand year at 790, to which Mr. Labaster replied in the affirmative.
65 grand.
That's pathetic.
This means that even with your pay cut, you'll be earning more in a month than hearings in a year plus only work nine months for kid pay for 12.
Yeah, I guess that wasn't a response to my lamenting the fact that nobody ever left me in their will and left me a crap load of money.
There you go.
I'm not.
I'm not.
There's all that movie right now that that guy was talking about with Phil Opsi more often right now.
Yeah, MSNBC.
It's on now.
I think that MSNBC is showing a movie.
No, there's showing some awards thing, but there's showing a clip from that movie.
And and nothing.
I just wanted to point it out with Phil Opsi more often as the priest.
Everyone says it's very good.
Really?
It deals with issues, you know.
He says, no, there's no facts in the church.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, click, click.
It's just, it's just I can't even find words to describe it leaves you limp.
It leaves you very weak, you know.
524 votes on the pool.
Nice going, Mr. Poolmeister.
Well, thank you very much.
We wish the best to our good friend Ken Maldon today is his last day.
Listen to his updates carefully.
Listen to his dulcetones between two and four.
Because they screwed him badly.
They screwed him and tattooed him.
And oh boy, for what?
Like I said, how much money could he have been pulling down?
Eight bucks.
He's no Dan La Bastard, thank God.
So Dan La Bastard's making 65.
First of all, why would you go on here and talk about how much money you're making?
Makes me wonder if it was true.
Either the story or, you know, or this email.
Are you doubting any of our insider emails?
All the time.
Boy, I've heard of doubting Thomas, but never doubting Jorge.
Well, guess what?
No doubt.
Here I am.
But you know, something somehow, some way we made it through another day.
Don't ask him out.
Oh.
He don't belong to me, Grace.
