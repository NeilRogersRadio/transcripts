Now install this? No bill.
Did you see our ratings for the last book?
Yeah, I know it's going to start in.
Sure, good talking with you.

That's right, watch your back.
That's right, watch your back.
Right below, below, below, below.
Don't bend them, bend them.
Watch your back.
Watch your back.
Watch your back.
Watch your back.
Watch your back.
Watch your back.
Watch your back.
Move away.
Yeah, let's get that stuffy.
I know one more time in your life.
I'm going to be a little bit more nervous.
Yeah, that's the weakest link right there is Zach among the producers.
He votes you the emotion and always doing the same thing to Joe.
Let's play to him.
That's what I just said.
That's why I played that.
What?
I think the turning point on the morning show is for Zach Kimmelman.
Was that, uh, got to, got to move up and out down.
I think that, that's the kind of change that was on.
That was the reading spike.
That's the highlight right?
That wasn't a spike.
That was a disaster.
That brought new shame and embarrassment to a station that's already for the last two and a half years.
Been disgraced, humiliated, and what are embarrassed.
Anyways, so the book came out yesterday.
We did not so bad.
Whatever five and Claret's came in to congratulate me this morning.
How do you like that?
Who was to show you how far this place is going in the toilet when somebody comes in and congratulate you for being on the first page in the target demographic?
Hey, we'll take it these days.
Oh, hey, listen, I was, I was pleased because when the hourly's shared between 10 and 2, you know, we did over a five share or five.
I'm saying five six. That's my psychic prediction.
Yeah, that's just what you make up.
Right. Exactly. You're saying five six.
That's it. That's it.
Based on five six, that means that the two to three hour with jerks would have to be a disaster.
And what's with this Aradio Hitmo when it's salsa crap?
Another one.
I don't know. What the coast?
Explain that to me.
They took me to a dump.
They're going to fade back where they belong.
Good.
But Aradio Hitmo, I mean, it's like one of those also ran stations and all of a sudden,
Oh, and in some day parts, what is it?
Where's that one plea?
Here it is.
Overall, for the whole week, they're number two and men.
They went from a typhoon ninth to number two and in the morning, they're number one.
They slaughtered Ron and Old Paul.
Now, do you believe that?
They went from sixth and men, the first from a four to a nine-nine from the winter of the spring.
Aradio Hitmo and that salsa crap?
No. I don't believe it.
Does anybody believe it? It said maybe a whole bunch of wire diaries.
Does anybody with a brain?
No. Anybody who wants a radio believe that crap, huh?
Jesus, God Almighty.
All right. Here's George's poll from yesterday.
And this is my last show for a long time.
Yep. For a week and a half.
Thank God.
And the good news is it's only going to cost me 1,500 bucks to repair my vet.
You know, you think that I came on here and said, oh, I totaled it.
I just demolished my, you know, I smacked, I kissed the wall. That's all.
I kissed it. Like bubble would say, it kissed it. That's all good.
And so it's only going to be 1,500 because after we place defender,
you know, when you're dealing with a fiberglass,
and you got a big crack,
like Oprah, a big crack.
If I could overcome my fear, I would blank. That was George's poll.
Yesterday, 608.
And the reason he had that many votes is because Eric,
I think you got a deal going with Eric now.
So I can't change the poll like early in the afternoon.
That's right. Is that the deal?
It has only begun. Well, no, why don't you do that?
I kept faxing him the poll and he wouldn't put the new one up there.
I could have called him and said, right, you know,
I try to explain the fax situation to you before about that.
If you don't want to tell him that you're going to fax something
and he doesn't turn on his five subplates,
he's not going to receive it or no day to pull every day that I'm on.
Yeah. Yeah.
Like this is something new.
If I could overcome my fear, I would call any arranger show 120.
Well, hopefully a lot of people overcome their fear today and call in.
Right. Don't be afraid.
Be afraid.
Skydive 93. I think only people with a death wish do that.

Oh, I'm going to tell you I would mind two nights ago.

Oh my god. I would just I try not to be one of those people who stirs it.
People, you know, too too obviously.
A lucky Lou.
Oh my god.
There were these two young guys in the early 20s.
One was his ugliest dirt.
And the other one.
I would say they were like Middle Eastern.
Whatever that means.
You know, like maybe Egyptian or so.
I don't know like that.
I have seldom in my life seen anybody who looked that good.
And I just kept staring and staring and he seemed to be oblivious.
Approach my love interest 26.
I should have gone up and given them big kiss on the lips.
A sweetie.
Maybe he was a terrorist.

Yes.
Oh.

Here.
Okay, here's a bunch of stuff.
Oh, the hourly is.
Is this the hour means yeah?
Well no, it's not the hour by hour means.
It's something yeah.
Yeah, it's better than what we had.
Clare said he's having some trouble with tap scan.
He's going to give you what you know what we want, what you want as he's cabinet.
Is that what he said?
As long as it's...
First before you tap it you got to find it.
Oh.
God, looking all these pages.
Anyway, this is interesting.
This will kill the whole show.
Let's look at my poll here which I got a good poll on there if Eric would ever put the damn thing up yesterday.
Finally, we must have put it on there like two in the morning or something.
The weakest link on WQM is Jirks 68.
Jirks.
And you're telling me that Geldy's going to replace him.
Now did you really say goodbye to him yesterday?
Jirks.
I said hi to him yesterday.
You said you're going to miss him.
Right.
I said it all the time on the air.
I've been saying that for months.
You told him that?
Yeah.
Why are you going to miss him?
Oh, he's a nice guy.
I'll stop talking crap.
What you're saying?
He is.
You were telling me that in the beginning and then all of a sudden you changed.
No, no, no.
He's only ever been nice to me.
A lot of other people have some crap to say about him.
No.
The weakest link on QM is Jirks 68.
Kimba Bo camper, who you were leading there for a short while but he passed you like you were laying flat.
Kimba's 47.
That's why we keep bringing him back.
And that's why we're promoting him being on the Kill Mad Dog show.
Kimba Bo camper, a speaking statue.
47.
George has got 37.
You're a respectable third.
DA 21, who's got a 0.5 there at night.
Joe Rose 19, the big O13.
I got five and Mad Dog's got four.
I'm the weakest link.
Oh, and now Mad Dog just tied me with five.
Good.
I don't want to be a, you know.
Okay, so here's what we got.
Should I do the break first?
Or should I go down all these?
Because the numbers are just pouring out of my machine mine.
They're pouring out.
He got some time.
5 to 7 a.m., Radio Hitmo is number one with a 10 share.
This is men 25 to 54.

Oh my god.
Look at all these pages.
Holy crap.
Pages falling on the floor.
I got a miss here.
You know me, Mr. Organization.
And I wonder about the Beasley organization.
I wonder how long they're going to sit still for this swill.
Let's see, 7 to 10 a.m.
Here's the important stuff.

Thank you, Zach.
I was Zach, totally that nice job on a Joe Rochow.
There was Zach, you killed it.
Butchered, destroyed it.
Got it, got it, move up and I'm down.
I guess what, in the next book you better move up and out
down earth.
You're out of a job, all you.
Q-A-M-2-7 and Waxi, said the kid 2-8.
About a flat footed tie.
I-O-D, that will 1.8 share 7 to 10 in the morning.
Holy cow, can that be right?
I-O-D, 1.8, 1.7?
1.8.
What about WFTL-A-50?
A 0.4, nice draw on Steve Lappell.
0.4, I love those numbers that start with a-
Oh, oh yeah.
What about Mr. Ego?
What's that station he's on, WWN, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, like that?
Don't, don't, don't, doesn't show.
You don't know, and it doesn't show.
Doesn't have any number.
So in other words, he always points.
Oh, zero.
I think we'll do the break, then we'll get to the important stuff.
Look at that, we're number three.
Yeah.
Five two.
So we get a bonus.

Mm-hmm.
Not more, a little bit.

The sports leader.
We're number three.
Gaming.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, kind of a fat.
What Michael Jackson likes to do.
Kind of a fat.
Who's he kidding?
Is it you?
Oh, girl.
You're the proper talent.
We're the interviewee.
We're the always willing goal.
We're the least together.
That's really cool.
They're okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
10.18 at 5.60 W.D. Kim.
Let's take a look at the award-winning schedule today.
It's Jerks from 2 to 4 in the studio.
You can save it by to him again.

You can say even though you're blind.
Mad Dog at the Shula's.
Stake 2 from 4 to 6.50.
First pitch with Jesse Agler at 6.50.
Did the Marlins win last night or what?
Yes, they did.

Yep, 75.
They beat the match?
See.
So what's the story?
They like the filming amount?
I don't know.
I didn't see that score.

An audio hit mono.
Speak in English.
6.0 and we got a 5.2.
We're number three.
Big is the fourth with a 5.0.
So you said we had a 5.6?
I said that was my psychic prediction.
No.
That's what you were talking about.
I told you we had more than a 5.
Yeah.
And that's because two to four is a disaster.
But anyway.
Coach is fifth with a 4.7 tied with hot.
And the other, let's see.
I.O.D.
Look at that.
We kicked their ass.
3.6.
They're tied for 10th with the W.H.D.R.
Whatever that is.
Some crap.
3.6.
We got like 50% more.
And that includes that's 10 to 2.
That includes 2 hours of rush.
Well, I can't wait to see the hourlies.
Are we going to get those or what?
I assume.
Then you are.
No, don't assume.
Go in there to Clarence's office and say they old fag wants the hourlies now.
Yeah, yeah.
Not this segment.
Oh no.
Go in there.
Coach Chris, whatever your name is.
I said bring a bit as soon as you got the tap scan.
Taps scan.
Taps scan.

I.O.S.
A.O.D.
John McCain has several supporters trying not to not off great here in Ohio.
Hello my friends. I just ate a soft meal here at Floucess Wiener and Snitchel's my friends.
With my friend, Lindsey Graham there love.
Yes, he's my smithers.
I enjoyed the meal my friends, especially my dessert of chocolate covered felty.
After I ate my friends I like to sing with my diapers full.
This old man John McCain, he's got water on his brain.
Here I'm a wack cow maniac who is much too old to campaign for anything I wish I could just go home.
I need an nap. I'm tired my friends.
I can't beat that guy.
1032 at 560 WDQAM let's take a peek at the puke of that poll now.
250 vote. The weakest link on WDQAM is jerks on 85.
Kimberville camp for 55. Georgia's steady there at 44.
A rock solid third.
Rock solid.
The A's got 26 with that 0.4.
Oh, oh, oh.
Joe rose 21. The big O was got 15.
Rock solid.
My dog's seven and I'm stuck at five.
I'm in last place. Look enough. I can see him all.
As Jackie Lee would say, back in the days when he was lucid and not a crappy old molemeister.
Here's the facts that really is aggravating.
Hello, Georgia.
And the O.K.
Congratulations on the latest book.
I recommend a book for both of you to read it will make for good segments when you discuss it.
Title how the world really works author Alan B. Jones.
Press A, B, J, press. A B, J.
You'll have a tough time getting it. No bookstores, no Amazon, etc.
We sent away B, J, press for it.
Best personal regards.
Caroline Ian and Hamilton, Ontario. How's it going?
Hey, what's a nice day, man? It's sunny.
Going to be like 79, 81, something like that.
Listen to your most days whether in Australia, Canada or Scotland.
And then it says, if you don't like it, we'll give you double your money for it for a pet rescue or any other charity.
What else talking about charity?
That's what Georgia's thinking. He's got his own charity.
That's right.
Charity begins at home. You know what they always say?
Yeah, it ends there too.
And the fact that we actually got a little dribble of a bonus out of this book and I'll say it's a major miracle.
You know what? You were laughing at me when I said we had a possibility when I was extrapolating in my head the 2554s.
You didn't believe me, did you?
I wasn't laughing, but I didn't. I just smircled a little.
I curled one end of my mouth.
I went snorting.
You were snorting?
Yeah.
Under Tim Horton was ever snorting.
I know he was drinking the night that he crashed his car and got a snort.
Well, they called out a snort.
You starting with Danny Boy now again?
With poor Danny Boy?
Danny Boy got canned because the Neocons, they were going to show them, they were going to show the network something or two or three.
And they did.
And CBS caved in.
And of course that was after they got that $550,000 fine which the court sister out.
And they said, oh, we're flying.
Exxon post a new profit record.
Exxon mobile once again reported the largest quarterly profit in US history today, posting net income of 11.68 billion dollars on revenue of 138 billion in the second quarter.
The profit works out too.
I want you all to grab onto something and hold on real tight.
The profit works out to $1485.55 a second.
$1480,000, even I don't make that much.
$1485.55 a second.
Although they were short of Wall Street estimates.
Able is predicted they would make $12.1 billion in profit.
But they didn't, they only made $11.68 billion.
That's in the second quarter.
That's in three months.
The rape of the world continues.
I don't need to read any book about it.
I can see it.
You can feel it, you can smell it.
You can pump it.
WQAM, hello.
What a shame.
I was just going to start taking a tremendous run of calls here.
It's my last show for many, many days for week and a half.
And I would have thought today we'd have a tremendous outpouring of call.
When you were thought so?
I imagine.
How was it yesterday?
I don't remember.
Chris?
There was a whole day ago.
Um, not that great for calls.
Yeah, that's what it was.
What does that mean?
I just wasn't very good calls.
I mean we had a couple good ones, but nothing major, nothing constant.
You have a lot of calls yesterday?
No.
I had a lot of chronics.
Yeah.
A lot of stalkers.
Stalkers?
We always will.
Those homosexual stalkers, you know, your people.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 pound five.
We were number three and we're pretty stupid.
We'll take a coast to show you how this place is degenerated on the tutelage of Jolly Jobelle.
He's butchered and he's just strided.
He's decimated it.
And of course our sports child who still hasn't given me the hourlies.
He's a, he's a co-conspirator.
He's a meeting right now.
He's a meeting right now.
He's in a meeting right now.
He's in a meeting of what?
The emotions.
Sports children.
That's what he's in a meeting of sports nerds.
He promised us the hourlies and this is like the last time, remember?
He kept being in a meeting and he wouldn't send us stuff, remember that?
Mm-hmm.
And I had a scream and carry on like a petulant child.
WQA and hello.
Hey Neal, it's people that call and thank my dear.
It's just killing our show.
Body clean!
It's like that.
WQA and hello.
Neal.
Yes.
Happy birthday, sir.
Back to you.
Couple of talking points here for you.
So I just heard the profit of course.
I had heard that earlier this morning.
But what's your position on drilling here at home?
What's my position?
It's all a big scan.
It's all a big scan.
I believe so too.
Of course, we have to be resourceful and use our resources with the highest infection.
They don't want to be resourceful.
What they want to do is keep shoving all the money in their Saudi buddies pockets.
That's what it's all about.
It's a game.
Don't you get it?
Right.
I need to tell the other talk, talk about drilling in homes.
It's just window dressing.
That's what it's all about.
I don't believe with picking up a low sea, read and baroque.
They're talking.
I think they're fear-mongering.
They're trying to spend the issue.
It takes 20, 10, 20 years to extract the oil and be sure.
I don't think that's completely accurate now.
I just think they're trying to spend the issue with that.
It's the rape of the world and they're 11 every second of it.
You notice as soon as there's some resistance, it's like testing how far they can go.
Testing the marketplace.
How far can they go?
How high can we go before the public starts revolting a little bit?
They put the screen on the congress, on the consumer, and then, of course, they put the screen on the congress.
They're all a bunch of crooks.
You don't believe me?
Ask Ted Stevens.
They're all a bunch of crooks.
Of course, oh, 12 a.m.
To answer your question, six ten Allen Combs, 12 a.m.
From the Combs and Hannity Show.
12 a.m.
Scary America.
12 a.m.
You got a good number there.
Allen Combs.
What do you mean 12 a.m.?
12 midnight?
Yeah.
We don't have got no midnight numbers on here.
Are you kidding me overnight?
No, no, you were asking who it was.
No, no, I wasn't asking about 12 a.m.
I was asking about 8 to 9.
Something down for both of them.
Okay, good choice.
Thank you.
All right.
Excellent choice.
The Wooden Soldier, Kibble Bowl camper.
Standing straight and tall and erect if I can say that.
And his boring is, and they keep bringing it back.
They love it.
And George knows why.
Yep.
Sports!
Sports!
Oh yeah, do you see what they had at JFK yesterday with a luggage?
Nope.
The system broke down.
They computerized the software glitch, crippled the SSI.
So they had like 80 billion bags all over.
And of course, big, big, big folks that they are, American Airlines said,
Oh, well, you can either travel with your bags or just leave them here.
Nice.
Yeah.
283 votes on the pool.
Let's take a puke at it.
I may have to read this one several times today, because this is the kind of stuff they
sink their teeth into.
We already have 50,000 votes if Eric would have put this pool on there, you know, by 5, 6
yesterday afternoon instead of being out the parliament house.
He's getting more and more like Josh Cordis every day.
The weakest link on WQM is Jerks 94.
Kibble Bowl camper 61 is moving on up.
If we were smart, he'd be moving on out.
Jorge's got 50.
The 828, Joe Rose 22, the big 015, who's got an ego bigger than the German, it's 8 and
I got 6 last place.
The best tower, your 151st, your 151st, your 151st, your 162st, your 162st, your M.
The fourth leader, the three down south, where the mudwems go to hang from trees and play banjo.
You got some who own a station on, newfangled raiding old.
Now as North Carolina goes, rallies a big city, you know, and that's where the beesleaves
had to go for Goli, Riley, Joe, you ferry.
A new GM, he'll do what he can.
Shake your hand like a friend, then quickly walk away.
Absolutely.
They had Joe, go to 56, oh, with raiding and the toilet mold to get those,
blaming sportful mose in order and control.
And then so, Goli, Riley, Joe, above you'll learn in the know, he lets mose.
Go, here's what blows, his Goli is on show.
He'll make a big change and rearray.
It's worse or the same, he hasn't done a thing.
Or what goes all the air had to, Joe don't have a stinkin' clue about a poor,
not that essentially blows sportful radio.
Oh my god.
Oh, 56, oh, Goli, Riley, Joe.
He's doin' it baby, he's done a few things, I mean that's an old bit so when he says he hasn't done a thing,
since that was recorded, he has a few things, all of them in the toilet bowl.
Get the plunger out, man, because that bowl is going to start overflown any day,
it's getting really full with the crap that he's put on here.
I love that nighttime point, whatever it is.
There's a thing where it's got the ratings in this last book from all around the country,
different markets for sports talk stations, and they're all like 17th and 24th and 199th, not good.
I mean, there are some markets, I didn't see like New York and Chicago and St. Louis and like that,
were probably doing pretty good, but around the rest of the country,
sports talk is in the crapper man.
It's down the old cube.
WDQAM, hello.
Good morning, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, what do you think about the Marlin's, boy?
The Marlin's.
I don't think about them at all.
I love the story, we're going to be good, people are going to go start going on the games now,
we're back boys, we're back.
Yeah, likely story.
We're back, cowboy.
You can go bowling in the aisles there, man, you can bring your own bowling ball.
No chance, go back, get on the rubber wrap, and go back where you came from, loser.
Cowboy.
298 votes on your full, what's our goal today, 400?
Well, that's Eric's fault, he offered you an explanation of why he did it around and didn't,
he just wouldn't put the new full thing up there for me to change it.
I kept trying to change it and there was nothing on there, nothing to change.
Except your underwear, why did he do that?
I don't know.
I think you put them up to it.
Yes.
56670560.560 and they've rising in singular wireless line.
WDQAM, hello.
Go on the rally, it's called Bob Pusenland.
WDQAM, hello.
Come on up, shot, come on up, shot.
QAM, hello.
I didn't match you 202.7, do.
Really?
Wow.
They need to bring back what we're doing at night.
Maybe that would do something for QAM.
The air thing was never on Magic 102.7 and you noticed one was on it, a quick whirling
and a disc jockey.
Right.
Is he on the air somewhere?
No, not yet.
No, Craig is not doing anything.
Nobody's doing something.
Kind of retired.
Okay, thanks.
Bye, bye, bye.
My, my, my.
I bet she's doing something.
56670560.560 and they've rising in singular wireless line.
I wonder how Stan Major is doing.
I keep thinking of that guy so I would buy a couple of nights ago.
Yeah, just like he's on his double inch shades on inside.
What kind of a lunatic where some rest is indoors?
You see that sometimes.
Shady people.
Is that it?
That maybe that's why I thought I'd stand major.
Not so slim with shady.
WQAM, hello.
They'll tell your sportholders no Marlin Stadium.
Yeah.
Like I haven't been saying that for a hundred years.
Have I been saying that for a hundred years?
Uh-huh.
Schmuck.
56670560.560.
See what you understand sir is that the powers that be since everybody the whole world is nothing but corruption.
They're going to go ahead and they made their back door deal and they're going to shove it through.
And no matter what Norman Brahmins says or anybody else, they're going to push it.
Just like the Metro fail.
Everything else if it doesn't make any sense, let's do it.
Like near a thingy, thingy per canyotherr with the Mickey Erison behind closed doors.
I just wonder if any palms got greased on that whole deal with the Mickey Arena.
Huh?
What do you think?
There's a lot of grease in going on.
Let me tell you right now.
56670560.
It's pretty slow on that phone today.
You were right.
Must be your fault.
You know what it is.
No, it's the fault of the fact there's nobody in town right now.
It's the 30th.
It's today the 31st of Julio.
This is the last day of our sale.
Uno de Agosto.
See.
Wow.
We better get with the right language now because if you look at these numbers, see.
The market has turned, I mean, it was pretty lopsided before.
But now it is just no speaking English.
I mean, it's just amazing.
Just shocking.
Right.
Right.
Maybe we ought to give Paco his own show.
There you go.
Get him to do something.
WDQAM, hello.
QAM, hello.
QAM.
Morning, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I see where you're starting to follow them, gubby.
No, I'm not.
Oh, yeah.
You mentioned them in the fall.
Let me say it again.
No, I'm not.
You can call every day and say the same stupid thing about them, cubbies.
And then when they go into a big skin, they're like 17 games behind with 15 left to go.
What are you going to say then?
You must be delusional, man.
You must be on heavy-duty drugs.
I'll meet you at Murphy's.
We're not interested about Murphy's bleachers, or the cubs, or Steve Stone, or any other modicone.
Not interested.
Take your cubs and stuff them.
God are you boring.
Jesus.
How about them, cubbies?
How about them coming?
Not interested in the cubbies or in baseball or anything that boring.
I'm an old, daughtering queen.
Okay, and I don't have that many years left, so I'm certainly not going to waste my time with stuff that's boring.
Good God.
Three hundred of hosts on the pool.
That's not a bad number.
Not a good number.
Nice going, you're about...
No, Eric screwed up my whole, all my plans.
I thought we'd have a rip-roar in the response and his pool and leave it to him.
He said, I'm sorry.
I had to leave early and didn't get home until very late.
I wish time.
Well, don't do it again.
No, in fact, do it anytime you want.
Now for an ex-cubber, we said George isn't worried about.
George hates the pools anyway.
Right.
Don't you usually put him on right before the show?
Right.
Well, that's a no way to get him in votes.
It's the same amount of people voting.
What do you mean by that?
By the time you change it.
In other words, let's say a thousand people vote on the pool typically.
They're always going to vote no matter when you change it.
We only wish a thousand people voted on the pool typically.
We only wish.
We only wish this radio station and a thousand people still listening to it since Jolly Jo and his demolition crew
came down from Raleigh in that big van.
I think we can do better.
In that moving van and what it is, they move the audience off of QA and MN at the right place.
That's right.
Well, you know, who was it?
It's the program director that wanted to be number two.
No, not the program director of the General Manjury.
Tim Williams.
Oh, I'll be a safe number two.
I'll probably be a safe number two on the risky number one.
I'll never forget that.
It's like the either one that's a big unwieldy audience.
That's right.
And the company's difficult.
It's dangerous, right?
Number one.
That was when I was in Zeta.
Right.
And Tim Williams, who got the job as GM only because he was the son-in-law of the Olivia,
their own the station.
Right.
The total is like, I can't.
A real moron, Tim Williams.
Oh, it would rather be a safe number two.
Don't be saying all those things, you know.
WQA and hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How about a poll or how about doing a poll who would be better from two to four?
You mean, Galby?
We've all done that.
Oh, my.
Been there.
Done that.
Click.
See, hit him on here at response.
He just wanted to make his statement.
Make sound of words, mouth.
Right.
Making sounds with your mouth.
M-O-U-F.
Right for some smash mouth for ball.
Sure.
See, I've seen an envelope where we were up against that first couple of months down on the second floor.
Although, it couldn't have been because it was over.
It was the end of December.
Football season was ending, not beginning.
Neil, you ready for some smash mouth for ball?
I remember that call like it was only yesterday.
Just like they got it, they told me I lost touch with the audience with that Eric Clapton.
WQA and hello.
Hey, good morning, I'm Khalil.
Yes, sir.
Good to see you.
Another cab driver went down in the line of beauty last night.
Meaning what?
Not my army.
They killed the cab driver last night.
Well, that's not good.
That's very good.
There's banana republic.
Oh, it's very good?
Yes.
Yes.
Man.
And what?
That was my question and what?
It was a response today.
Yeah.
Wow.
I've told you something.
Banana republic is the word I'll write in your part of it, man.
You're part of the fruiner.
You're the people that Lou Dobbs is always screaming about.
WQA and hello.
Neil?
Yes, sir.
What were you and Taco doing when you hit the wall?
Ah, ah, ah!
Taco wasn't in the car, ballet.
I was in the car.
It was 8 o'clock on the Sunday morning.
You think Taco or anybody else is getting up at 8 o'clock on the Sunday morning?
I don't think so.
But you keep hallucinating, man.
In fact, I got a perfect story for this guy.
A territory man.
What is territory?
What was that?
No idea.
Is that a Canadian story?
Evidently.
What is this from?
The Northern Territory News.

You're going back to Europe.
You're going to Amsterdam.
You know, people ask me where did deal go and I say, I don't know.

They were like the, part of the Golden Age of QAM back in the mid-90s.
They were like the, part of the Golden Age of QAM back in the mid-90s.
They were like the, part of the Golden Age of QAM back in the mid-90s.
They had a nose for sports.
I'll tell you that.
Fender 28 votes on the poll, let's see who's getting hammered, as they say.
The weakest link on WQM is Jerks 107, Volcamp or 68, George 57, DA 31, Joos 25, the big
O-22, Mad Dog and I are tied with Nina piece.
I've got you Robert Bieber voted several times.
Probably for me.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah

Funnier calls. So something changed in what show?
In the Neil Rogers show. What's the one you're saying in that show like you're talking in the eighth person or something? What does that mean?
Is this like an out of body experience for you or something? I mean, what are you talking about?
No, this is but you know, it's not like there's a lot of choices to do it to another channel
Good radio. Oxymoron man
Well, I'm sorry. You know, I used to do a little radio down here in the key. Oh boy

terminal guy that was giving me a song of dance about talk radio and about how he worked
a key West and was fortunate enough to work for some boring guy who let him.
Who cares?
It's a radio show, that's all, it's a means to an end, it's a mockster leban as they say in
China, a mockster.
Oh, it's big in China, how'd you like to be breathing in that pollute?
Oh, no thanks, what's talking about that?
My god, I got everything you wanted.
You make L.A. look pristine and clean.
Dog with lead sauce and poison sauce.

Also impressed, I swished a guyco and saved over $600.
I was very happy.
Guyco.
Real service, real savings.
Am I smiling?
I can't do this.
I mean ordinarily, I'm not all that fun to her anymore, you know, for like the last hundred
years.
Yeah, but once in a while she can be pretty funny when she's making fun of herself.
Right, working that ad.
And that's, I mean, guyco doesn't have too many clinkers.
Too many stinkers, clarkers.

Nobody at QAM, hello.

WQAM, hello.
Danielle, what's it...
What's it that George's going to do with a toy show with Lucy Lopez I'm waiting?
Is what?
Again, what's that?
The toy show.
And what is that?
I know.
It's one of those bits where he goes over killing good time.
I don't know if he's talking about him personally or with their audience.
What are you talking about, sir?
Are you talking double talk?
I don't know, he always talks about killing good time, but I'm not sure if he's talking about...
Yours, yours, believe me, you've got plenty of it.
WQAM, hello.
Danielle.
Yes, sir.
Hey, what's up, man?
How you doing, Bella?
The guy calling about the show, I think what's happened, I've been a long time listening.
And I think it's plain to see that Joyce's the show, you know?
Mm-hmm.
That's not.
We made little bonus money in this last book and actually was on the first page in a ratings number three.
It's a miracle.
Yeah, but I'm asking you, because I know you always said that the silence here would never go through,
which are a pinion about that.
It's going through.
No, it already went through it.
That's what I'm saying, it's going through.
It's a done deal.
And you know what?
And I still don't want to have it.
And you said again, and I still won't subscribe to it.
I still don't want it.
And there's some keeps calling me, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, because the accident wasn't that damn pondiac, you know, when we bought it.
And so they keep bugging me and I don't want to take me off your list.
Don't call here anymore.
I don't want to.
You want it?
You want sound like radio?
I have sound like radio.
You do?
I have a free subscription to series, yeah.
And?
I listened to a couple of music stations on Sunday.
It's a pinion of the ass by the way.
You got to be in the door.
You don't listen to how I read the door.
Who?
388 out of poll.
Boy, you're really struck me to get to four.
We're going to do it.
We're going to do 500 a day if it's the last damn thing we do.
All right.
We're going to push it and push it and I mean, Jesus got all mighty.
These are already, it's one of those polls our audience usually.
They eat this for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
They lap it up.
I guess where I'm going at two o'clock.
What?
You got it.
Good guess.
I'm on a street there like you wouldn't believe.
He has to damn plan quick hit, the two cent quick hit.
Not that it's interesting, but it kills some time.
And then of course I play to max 300 which is six bucks a play.
Most of these sluppers are playing 20, 30 coins, you know.
I mean 20 credits that's 40 cents.
How much, how much you going to make on any game playing 40 cents a shot?
So anyway, I'm playing it and the machine seemed dead as a door nail.
I was getting ready to leave except they're all jam packed because it's real popular now.
And so I'm stuck at this machine and I hit it and all of a sudden here's seven quick hits.
1100 bucks.
How do you like that?
Okay.
I liked it.
And they came and paid me and said, I said, where's the door?
I think I know what's over here.
Bye bye.
Bye bye.
I'm on a wild streak there.
I have no idea why it's called.
You know what's called?
Look.
Blind look.
WDQA in.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
You know, someone should kick in that door with a brain trust.
This is a consulting and tell them that from two to four, man, we want George.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Can somebody out the ball to do that over there?
No.
Maybe George ought to do it.
Maybe George ought to go there, kick the door down and say, I want that two to four shot.
Now, don't bring back that squeak, myster, for Christ's sake.
You want it?
Now, of course, they wouldn't pay any more money for it.
What do you talking to me?
Yeah.
No, no.
For no more money, no.
Thank you.
How about if they give you a lot of money?
Okay.
How much do you think George is pulling down?
I don't know.
Couple of hundred grand?
No.
One city.
One hundred.
One city?
One twenty.
Maybe.
People are starving and they're paying him for that...
Carpet Hatcher.
Oops, and he's heating.
I like that color.
I call this one.
Come on back.
You know what I'm talking about?
He does the heat and hoops I like him.
Maybe we could put him on from two to four.
He'd pay us.
W-Q-Y-M, hello.
No.
Yes, sir.
It's not bad to be at number three in the Philippines because the only ocean was number three at one time on K-S-E-K and the stopoverty.
Then he wants a number two to follow.
W-Q-Y-M, hello.
Death cost him, give me a round of gas.

W-Q-Y-M, hello.
The cast is busy, Yovon.
Yovon.
W-Q-Y-M, hello.
Come here, Nail.
Yeah.
I think that George is going out with my traces.
Hello.
Yeah.
I'm here.
I think he goes out with my traces.
I'll be masking.
Mm-hmm.
I think that.
W-Q-Y-M, hello.
W-Q-Y-M, yes.
Speak to God, please.
Speaking.
How are you?
No, we're a Wingo Star.
My name is Colleague.
Larry King's and Wingo Star on the show the other night.
How very unfortunate, yeah.
Well, Wingo put him in this place.
It was Wingo that just celebrated the sixth day birthday and Larry King was going on and on and on about his age and everything.
And finally, Wingo looked at Larry and says, well, look at you.
You've been here forever and then he says, how old were you?
110, 120?
And I thought to myself, boy, he did meal proud, so.
Yeah.
I always like that Wingo.
Nice going.
No talent for a good sense of humor.
393, I think, by the top of the hour, we're going to be like,
breaking 400 on there.
Whatever happened to Glenn Rinker, by the way, the crope, I think he might have.
Is he the one that blew his brains out or not?
No.
I don't know.
He was like a munchkin.
He was like a little guy.
I had no idea.
I think he, we're like Bob Mayer.
He used to sit on six phone books when he did the news.
Who is the guy that blew his brains out, the newsman, from Channel 10, I believe.
I don't know.
Orlando.
He woke up one day and he realized he was in Orlando.
It was brains out.
I don't blame him.
Poor Eric, man.
It's really sad.
He's got to be in that place.
Maybe that's why he wouldn't put my poll on yesterday.
Maybe he was really depressed.
He was out late, he said.
Out late doing what?
He's a married man with a family.
He can't afford to be out late on a weeknight on a freaking Wednesday.
Not what's wrong with that, man.
You married me with a family you need to be out late on a weeknight.
It's not possible.
Good thinking, Eric.
More power to you.
A few a.m.
No more calls.
Yeah, right.
This is the guy that told me five days ago.
Three more days, no more calls.
And here's his stupid call on again.
And there'll be 12 more days, no calls for me, because I won't be on here.
And when I come back on Tuesday, whatever that date is, there'll be plenty of calls.
Schmuck.
W.Q.A.M. Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Have a good vacation.
Thanks.
And a Rocco bomb as wife is gone.
Okay, yeah.
One note earlier again.
Why?
Is she, what was the first freshness he was using?
Does she have what it takes?
Is she have what it takes?
She has what it takes.
I think she does have what it takes.
She's got what it takes.
It's only one thing that she needs to have.
That's right.
She's got it.
She evidently has one.
We have a 95 vote on our world famous pool.
The weakest link on W.Q.A.M. is Jerk 127.
Week.
Week.
With a two share, although I'll be honest with you, that's about twice a while I thought he would get.
It's twice what Geldig got last time he was on the air.
And twice what Mo got between two and four.
When they had a one point.
Oh, God.
The kind of note, like I said, Florence Walk Radio.
I want that too.
We'll honor it.
And that's what Joe Bellen is specializing in.
Those are the kind of numbers that he rebels in.
Kim Bokap were second with 80 Georgia 72 right on Kim's ass.
DA 39 to big O 29.
Joe Rose 29.
Mad Dog is slipped out of me.
He's got 10.
And I'm still sitting with nine.
The best talent for the new largest sport radio 560 QAM.
The sports leader.
It's Dick Cheney.
I'd like to relax by having Mary Magdalen massage my balls while listening to the Neil
Rogers 12th of an hour.
You can behave.
Two nine on discovery.
Sharks.
Two Maronite on discovery.
Sharks.
Followed by several more nights of Sharks.
Yes, it's bits I'm programming once again here at Discovery.
Sharks.
Sharks and more Sharks.
Not fascinated by Sharks.
Okay.
Let's check out the Discovery Channel Video Library, shall we?
It's in here.
Let's see what else they have to put on the outside of the Sharks.
See there.
Sharks.
Sharks.
See this one here?
Oh, Sharks.
How about this one here?
Sharks.
Well, here's one.
Bonsi jumps the Sharks.
There's some more here.
Sharks.
Lots of Sharks.
Oh, I guess, uh, don't miss it.
You know.
Two nine on discovery.
Followed by one at 560 WQAM.
Happy, uh, 3rd day to sound like a little marshmallow, because I'm eating right?
I'm eating it.
I'm eating it.
Schneider's weenie, yeah.
I nuke it.
During the break.
Ah, if I didn't nuke it long enough.
Uh-oh.
Half cold.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, try it.
Not on the outside, cold on the inside.
I'm gonna do another eight seconds.
I'll be back.
All right.
Yeah.
Should we just make us smithly noise as well as go under something?
Sure, then.
People won't notice that there.
I'm just, um, I want to keep on with my bookkeeping over here before I automatically log out.
I'm doing some banking, paying some bills over here.
I've got to keep busy during the show, you know.
I guess I don't know how we got along without online banking.
Indeed, you know how a writer's cramp.
Like every, every, like twice a week, you'd spend an hour writing and writing and writing.
Yeah.
Who?
Writing checks, writing the return address.
Payings don't build fashion way.
Who?
You?
Us, all of us before the internet, before online banking.
I still write checks.
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, I'm not.
I mean, there's something that pay online, a couple.
That's it.
Oh, much better now, am I waiting nine seconds?
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Bad radio is eating on here.
I were, they're not having that meeting now, it's lunchtime.
There might be out, I don't know.
I think we ought to send a fat Chris to, you know, burn off a couple of calories.
Go do a little scouting for us. See what's going on.
We're back.
And tell that clurries we want the hourly.
Tell that nitwit we want it now.
Okay.
Unless, maybe he don't got it.
I guarantee if somebody would have had him.
Hard of had you.
He'll be able to buy now.
I'm sure.
He's sent out already blocked you for a fat boy.
32 a.m.
I feel.
Yes.
How did I go eating some food there?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, that's so pretty likely, huh?
403 votes on the pool.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and 5, 60 on the Verizon singular wireless line.
He's having major computer problems.
And what does that mean?
Out of thousands of years when I said Neil would like the hourly.
He looked me and said I'm having major computer problems.
Is there anybody in the building that has a computer that works?
Me?
Chris?
Josh?
Lee?
Yeah.
See where there's a world there's a way.
If he wanted to get us that, then we could get it.
Is there some kind of a disk you have to have to get the tab scan crap?
Is there like, you know, some...
I'm sure there's software access all of these things.
I don't know how that works.
I'd love to.
I'd love to be able to do it here, but you know they don't want us to have information about ourselves.
We might do something with it.
Like, no, like, no, like, no, read it.
Like an aspergerist, the spear?
Yeah.
Well, he's not being very helpful.
I'll tell you that.
I guarantee you, if someone had building those computer that works,
and he could be getting the numbers for us, very important,
and we important thing.
Because this is my last show for 12 days.
And if you think I'm going to be like, hang in around here doing cameo appearances to find a...
Well, you'll fax it to me, right?
Yes.
If he gives it to you.
Q.A.M. Hello.
So I could say in Billy Ocean, or it's the number two that we can end up...
Somebody Q.A.M. Hello.
Why is that being very helpful?
Q.A.M.
Uncle Neil.
Yes, sir.
Tony Shark here.
Uh-huh.
I'm an artist.
And I got some good music on the web.
Ah, you could listen to it for free if you want to website.
No.
It's controversial.
No.
Hey, listen, I'm a long time first time, and I called you earlier and asked you, you know, a simple question,
and you will root to me and hang up, obviously.
Yeah, man.
What was the question?
And never mind.
You remember the question, dude.
Yeah, sure.
But, hey.
You saw it.
I'll give it a short.
You called the first time, as you call it, this time or what?
I'm calling this time because I want to tell you that I'm listening to you show for a long time.
And you make me laugh, man.
I'm a truck driver.
I'm good.
Well, I'm a good woman.
Okay, you too.
Bye, Tony.
He's a truck driver.
I've got an artist.
I'm an artist.
I'm a jeez.
406, you've got over the 400 hum, Chris.
You'll make 500.
All right.
Not.
Hey.
Let me say it again.
Not.
Look at five.
WDQ-AM, hello.
You're paid.
Q-AM, hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Well, I hope he's carved and just trucked like just explode in a fiery, fireball that guy.
Okay.
Wow.
How you doing?
Great.
Hey, listen.
Seriously.
Are you really anti-satellite radio?
What does that mean?
Well, I mean, you know, for a while, wouldn't you like cocking to get on it?
Of course.
If they would have paid any money, they don't want to pay anybody any real money.
They want to give Howard all the money and Mel Carmison and everybody else so that can't get a real job.
There's a lot of people off the cliff.
Oh, my God.
That guy is up.
WDQ-AM, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Hi, brother.
Uh-huh.
It looks like the pretty master got the hourly because they're claiming he kicked your butt over there.
Yeah, likely story.
They got a three something.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
He looked like he's got the hourly.
He got it broken down.
Let me see it again.
The program director come in and say, let me say it again.
No chance.
No chance.
I'll let you.
I'll let you.
I'll let you.
I'll let you.
I'll let you.
What he did it.
Likely story.
True.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Give me a big kiss from me on the red nose.
Okay, sorry.
I got news for him, man.
And the idea that he's on the year in the first place is so humorous.
So you don't know what it'll affect or cry.
Let's see.
All right, but we had Dave LaMonde the morning and then we fired him and we lied about it.
Yeah, you really got a culinary control.
So you're really doing it.
Chicken ass, you're on.
He's the asparagus master.
Well, I'm telling my weenie it was, uh, it was okay.
Was it great?
Was it full filling?
No.
WQA M Hello.
The cane met with the Dalai Lama.
Now it's bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, picking.
WQA M Hello.
I'm at the doctor.
Thank God.
Oh, how a little y'all happy day.
Oh, man, maybe the lobotomy is underway.
Yeah, I'm sure not the right kind of doctor.
WQA M Hello.
I'm Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, my calls you last week about the slipknot concert.
Remember that?
About the what concert?
Flipknot concert.
Oh, yeah.
Uh-huh, sure.
Well, the concert was awesome and I actually got to go backstage and hang out with him.
I got picked out of like 2000 people.
Yeah, did you get to have a sex with him?
Uh, no, unfortunately not.
Yeah.
No.
Well, better luck next time, okay?
Good idea would be to like bend over and put your hands on your cheeks or more sucking around.
Got to do it.
That would help.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8, 5, 6, 10, 60, and a Verizon's thing to get a wireless on.
What about those marlins, man?
What about the marlins?
Any interest?
No.
I think that's what's killing Jo and the morning besides that.
Hey, they're getting manny.
Too much marlin talks.
Like I said, somebody get a haircut.
They get him out of here.
It's got a crappy attitude.
They're getting manny.
They're getting manny.
Like when, uh, it's all the same crap.
If people ain't interested in something, you could, it's like when the panthers got
Pavelle Bre.
You would have thought in a town where anybody cared about hockey that they would have been
screaming from the rooftops.
They would have been going nuts.
They would have been having parties in their pants and in the streets.
But no, not in South Florida.
We don't know nothing about that.
We don't want to.
Name the topic and that's the response to the...
Somebody QAN.
Hello.
Hey, did you see the story on Certainly Not News about the woman who followed the
geezers of the space in her pussycaps hair?
Are you going to ponder that one for a while?
Nope, I'm going to ignore it.
Oh.
Not talking to me that was the rest of them.
You might think about it.
No, that's one to think about.
Is it a fact you sent me or why?
Yes.
Oh, I thought it was going to be the hourly, some clearance from that idiot.
Neil and George, good afternoon.
You have the new controversial Obama rap song by Ludicrous.
I heard a small piece of it on Power This Morning.
I'd like to hear it all if you have it.
What I heard was phony thanks if you can't from Ray over at Morini Dodge.
No, don't got it, Ray.
We don't got it.
Power's got it.
Power's also got the...
They're doing the text messaging thing too.
Right.
They're selling you advertising budget.
They're all over the buses, the rigbles, and the banner planes and the dot.
What do we got?
And by the way, it's Thursday, but you know, this noon came and went and we didn't give
you the restaurant thing because there isn't one this week again.
Correct.
But we are eating tomorrow.
Thank you, Steve Slur.
Can Tucky Fry, can I say it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And they are going to bring you a graveyard bag.
A tub.
And I'm going to soak in it.
I agree with you though, man.
I'll climb into it.
First of all, any mashed potatoes, I have never had mashed potatoes in my life without
some kind of graveyard on it that were worth eating.
It's just a vehicle for something else.
And that is correct.
It's like a no ice cream.
I mean, even as much disdain as I have for a no ice cream, if it's got like gobs of hot
fudge and marshmallow and stuff like that, then they're pretty good.
But they're gravy is so good.
I just want to dip my fingers in it.
Really?
Yeah.
How about wavy gravy?
They don't make that anymore either.
Remember the good flavor is to make venegeries wavy gravy?
They sold out another corporate and other thing about all these horrible flavors now.
I could already be dead if they would have kept the good flavors coming fish food and wavy
gravy and stuff like that.
But no.
No.
We got strawberry, shortcake and bananas split.
And then a lot of things that sound really good and then you taste them like, ah fat.
Fat?
Yep.
As they say in the Middle East, fat.
I wonder what country those are guys were from at Woodvine two nights ago.
Maybe they'll be back.
Maybe they'll be the saftonone.
Maybe the guy will leave his buddy at home in an alley somewhere in a dark alley.
What do you think?
Yeah.
Hey, it's worth dreaming about, right?
Oh my goodness.
Dreaming is free.
I wanted to, I was sticking this guy out of a movie star or something because that's
how good he looked.
I want to go over and say, hey, are you in movies or something?
Let's go make something or something like that.
Tell me your producer works for lots of other people.
Ah, yeah.
Produced.
I'm going to make you a star.
414 votes on the poll.
The weakest link on WQM is jerk, 139.
Kimba Bullcamp were 82, George 74, you're moving in on his territory.
Hey, the mall is Mediterranean.
It's official now.
They got it?
No, they got Arthur Rhodes at the moment.
They got what?
Dusty Rhodes?
Yes.
Almost as old as him, yeah.
DA40, the big O31, Joe Rose 29, Mad Dog 10, and Neil Nein.
The Marlins.
Who the hell is the battle politics?
Sporting of my season.
You am.
Big sports leader.
The Marlins win.
Marlins win.
Marlins is on his behalf of their beer.
He's worry, so where we are now?
Looks like the fight the Rhodes dies.
Smells from the body, robots.
Barbara Bush has Marty Bell's an ice bulls-other ice, my bow.
It happens when she's alive.
She raised more criminal clouds.
Barbara Bush has Marty Bell's an ice.
And she's testing, holes in crab meat.
And she raised more crazy Saturdays.
She's a troll steak.
And takes our bricks to an A1.
Those dead say, what's no boys?
What's like she's carrying an apple and bull
between her thighs and eyes.
Marty Bell's an ice.
She's at the teacher's board.
And when she's always surprised.
She's whimmel when she's caught.
Barbara Bush has Marty Bell's an ice.
She gave us George Bush and Jim Bush
not a match in the wild and white.
He'll be mentioned back.
And smells just like the magic sauce.
I'm a big hat.
Barbara Bush remembers on his four-night
on a fair day with Marty Bell's an ice.
But sure, he's had it at the right time.
Much too long as one of my favorites in the occasion.
Notice, co-19 at 5.60 WQA, I'm happy Thursday.
How's that meaning coming?
Almost be over with.
Must be.
And he's still got nothing for us, right?
Because he's a quizzling.
He's a simple thing.
He's an idiot.
He could make the effort to go to somebody's computer
that works in it.
But oh no, not Clarence.
Here's a story for George.
I know I had this in my pile here.
Somewhere in here it is.
I found it.
Swingers and Hollywood haven't exactly been loving
bedfellows yet starting yesterday.
The city that once declared war on a downtown
swingers club and tried to ban two-life crews.
Smuddy rapping is playing host to swing fest 2008.
I know, they're sponsoring.
I'm doing well.
I know there's a world's largest swingers party
and adult trade show.
Well, of course they are with you because you're a prover.
Yep.
Like all of us.
The four day three in Wild Night events.
What does it say?
The four day in three Wild Night events takes over the entire western
diplomat resort in Spam, right foot theme parties, hundreds of exhibitors,
a shuttle service to a nude beach and a four-play golf tournament, F-O-R-E.
Ah.
Point stars including former California Gubernatorial candidate
Mary Carey will be in town,
mingling with the expected 10,000-so convention delegates.
Everyone's been talking about Hollywood looking to meet their
said convention spokesman Greg Freeman.
Why would that be?
Because you live there?
Yep.
That's it.
Jerry over you.
Can you believe he's on the air?
I'm on the International TV.
Ricky Tiki sent.
And watch the Spanley-Cladwoman dance.
While there have been other large-scale swinger conventions over the year,
swingfest is considered to be the first of its kind on the east coast.
Freeman said organizers chose Hollywood because it's tucked between Miami and
four-loader-dilets tucked.
Yes.
Miami-Dade's nudist playland,
had a hollow of a beach as only a short, simple shuttle bus ride away.
When not parting, convention goals will attend similar, such as pole dancing.
Swingers and nudists can coexist,
and the all important legal issues affecting swingers clubs.
Hollywood is the perfect back-draft for that last tutorial.
Freeman City was nowhere of Hollywood's rocky relationship with swingers,
and the legal son, now what is this?
Oh, it's an email from my good friend Ken from Atobico.
It's a link to something.
CityNews.ca.
Well, I'll get it off by a thing in a second.
Must be mighty important.
Can you think?
Sure.
For just a second or so there,
I thought I might be an email from some listener out there that Joe Belgate
gave my email address to when surprised me.
I speak out of emails.
Clarence came in and, oh, here's the hourly.
He's all right.
Where'd we get these?
Clarence.
Twenty is an idiot.
Oh, now that he put IOD on here too, I hope.
Yes.
I hope I hope.
Yes.
Because he usually just gives us an waxy because he thinks that's the only other station on the dial,
because he's an imbecile.
There it is.
Okay.
Okay, let's first go to, um,
oh yeah.
Foody, he really kicked our ass.
Take a look at this.
Take a look at those pathetic numbers, footsie.
If it weren't for Rush from Noon to Three, they're pathetic.
And Disney is the answer to 9 a noon.
9 o'clock, Joe Rose has got a 2-5.
He's got a 1.6 here.
This is a men 25 54.
And 10 o'clock, I got a 5-5.
He's got a 2.
And 11 o'clock, I got a 5-5.
He's got a 2.
You got squat, footsie.
How do you like that?
Yeah.
Noon to one, we got a 4-8.
Rush has got a 5-4.
He beat us in that hour.
But, one to two, we got a 5-4.
Rush has got a 4-7.
Strange.
Two to three, we got a 2.3.
That's Jerks and Rush has got a 5-5.
Three to four.
Jerks has got a 1-7 and Rush has got a 3-7.
Rush didn't do all this great.
Maybe some of the right wingers in July didn't, or June didn't get all the adiaries.
All the way doubted.
And take a look at those, and at the afternoon, let's see that.
Four o'clock, we got a 3-7.
Five o'clock, we got a 4-1.
And six o'clock, we got a 2-8.
They got a 2-7.
So, except for that weak first hour following dead air, a man dog beat him the other two hours.
Then, at night time, take a look at that 8-9 pm.
I want you to take a look at this.
Between the two stations combined, W-I-O-D, oh, that's I-O-D.
I'm on the wrong side.
I'm on the wrong side.
Sorry, ours are exciting.
Even more exciting.
No, let's see, I'm giving the wrong number.
But they're very similar.
Yeah, back to the I-O-D in the afternoon.
Still, we went.
We got the only 0.0.
All right, night time.
They got the Marlins, man.
They got a 4-5 at 7 o'clock, a 4.5 at 8.
A 3-4 and a 2-6.
And a 1-2.
And at 11 o'clock, they got a 4.3.
Which I don't know what they got on after the Marlins.
We, though, on the other hand, at 7 o'clock,
that's the dolphin infomercial.
We got a 1.0.
At 8 o'clock, we got a 0.1.
A 0.1.
Nine o'clock, we got a 0.5.
At 10 o'clock, we got a 0.0.
And another o'clock, at 1.0.
At 10 o'clock, we have a 0.0.
Yeah.
I think at that meeting, they're trying to figure out how to go lower than that.
And if anybody can do it, baby, they're the ones.
Yeah, you kicked your own ass, man, with two shares.
A 1-6, a 2 and a 2.
A 2.0.
To be exact.
These footsie liquors out there, man.
I've heard of the foot locker, but the foot liquor.
The people in there, I guess.
People in there, everything.
Right.
There's even some people out there like the late Peter Clayton, who are into...
But that's another story.
So there we go, we finally got the hourlies.
And you're welcome, clearance.
And these say, thanks for the great job there midday between 10 and 2.
It is mine, he said that.
Far and away, the, in fact, at 4 o'clock, we got a 4 and a 5.
We got a 3 and a 4.
And the rest of the day, how about from 5 to 7 in the morning?
The big O's got a 3-1 and 3-1, consistency.
And Waxy is got a 1-8 and a 1-3.
Now, what time has it to kid on?
Is the Analyche 5-9 or something?
5-30 to 10, I believe.
Oh my God.
The big O kicked his ass.
And what about those hourlies there?
6 o'clock, what do we got?
3-1 and they got a 1-3.
They got a 1-3 at 6 o'clock across the street.
7 o'clock, we got a 3.0 and they got a 2-5.
And then the last hour is about even Stephen, maybe this is a fraction.
And that was when Zach was doing, got a guy to move up and out down, got a guy, I'm telling you.
That's responsible for Joe Rose taking it up the old butt.
But, I'm going to break them in this book.
Zach.
People like that raspy voice, I think that's what it is.
It reminds them a little bit, you know who reminds them of just a little tiny bit?
That's it.
I'm going to kick his ass and then I'll steal his two pay.
Come 26 and 560 WQM.
Greatest American dog.
Here's the hottest show of the summer.
Critics are raiding.
Audiences are rolling over and playing dead.
Now, it's time to shake hands with the next step in pentatainment.
Greatest American.
Gerbil.
Gerbil.
How are the contestants performing the giant plastic sphere?
Can little Skippy take the wheel of death?
Or win an immunity carrot and avoid being voted off the seat or chips to take the long walk down the plastic tube of shame.
With celebrity judges.
Randy Jackson.
Paul Avgoul.
And Richard Geer.
Greatest American.
Gerbil.
Gerbil.
This fall only on CBS.
It's 12.32.560 WQM.
So how do you like to go to those houries?
Not too shabby considering what we're up against.
It's a major miracle.
Let's hear it for us.
I'll ride.
We'll take it.
Exactly.
We'll take it.
I won't tell you where we'll take it.
But what's that?
That's the wrong one.
I've done that before.
I was going to say.
We're number three.
Damien.
I didn't do a good job that time.
We're number three.
Damien.
That's better.
Not good?
It's better.
And you have a little bonus money coming.
So you don't have to cry so much all the time.
Damn it, little money.
It says pretty, uh, pretty mean.
Because I know what I'm going to get.
It's not not all that big.
So if I'm getting a poultry sum,
although I'll get mine a lot, you're sooner than you will.
They're going to hold out a dollar bill and let me smell it.
They're going to let you sniff it.
What about the dollar?
That's it.
Johnny Joe's got to come along and bend over like George Sniffett.
That's what we're keeping this cash.
Imagine when he farts, oh my god.
I'm not sure which would make the world.
It doesn't mean a good pull.
Chris or Hank or Johnny Joe Bell.
Who's far from shit like that?
Maybe that was that earthquake the other day in LA.
Chris was here the whole time.
I've got the best story ever in the history of the show.
In the history of mankind.
Okay.
And it's for my close personal friend, Ken and Tobico,
which is right off the road here.
Who a message of me every now and then.
And this I must be psychic because I was thinking about this yesterday.
There was this Chinese woman, Chinese man, who was sitting next to me.
And she, old lady, she smelled so bad, she couldn't have seen a bar of soap in a hundred years.
And I wanted to scream.
Oh, and I had a good machine going to other one leave.
I had a good machine, but oh my god.
She was unclean at her machine.
And here's the story from City News,
Managecited from Casino because of BO.
I heard that story.
Did you?
Well, not just really briefly.
I want the details.
All the other details.
Michael Wax wants an apology, but don't bet on his getting one.
The 54-year limousine manager was an Atlantic City casino on Tuesday,
gambling his hard earned money.
Waxed have been at a table for 17 hours straight,
and the 440-pound man complained he didn't have time to attend to his personal hygiene before setting out.
As he went to use the restroom at the Borgata Hotel Casino in Spa,
the establishment regular was followed to the squeal in the men's room by a manager.
What he was told, floored him.
His fellow gamblers were permanently upset by his rather distinctive and unpleasant body odor,
and the casino was asking him to leave the premises.
Waxed doesn't deny he wasn't exactly as fresh as a daisy that night.
There is no question I stink, he states bluntly.
I'm not denying it.
I do have an odor I've been playing for 17 hours.
I mean, when you can smell it yourself, then you know you really, really stink.
He tried to retake a seat at the table where he'd been playing,
but management refused to allow him to return.
He was ordered to leave in front of his fellow gamblers.
He then asked if they'd given use of a hotel room to freshen up.
The answer was an adamant, no.
First rated the Brooklyn man left the complex steamy mad,
and smelling it more than just a fury.
Right, I'm sure he was steaming.
He's now filed an official complaint with the Casino Control Commission,
which is promised to examine whether any laws of regulation were broken.
The entire issue of this is that it raises the questions of when people's hygiene
become grounds for refusing to serve them,
and in this case shows there are no easy answers.
Still, waxed things he deserves one and wants to go back to the hotel with his dignity restored,
why doesn't he discuss somewhere else to blow his dough on games of chance,
and better and better claims he likes the burgauda,
and there's no reason he shouldn't be allowed to go there.
And he insists he's not mad that they told him he smells,
he just believes they shouldn't have embarrassed him in front of other patrons.
I'd like an apology, he says.
So far, there's been no resolution to the impasse,
and waxed vows to raise a stink if he doesn't get some kind of satisfaction,
which unfortunately is how the whole thing started in the first place.
He raised a stink.
Now that I know that they can kick people off further,
I think maybe I'm going to start to open up a mouth.
I'm going to start swooning, oh my god, you stink so bad!
And then fall off the chair, and then have them kicked out and then sue the place.
How's that sound?
I mean, I'm serious, I've told you these stories for a long time,
I've been going four years, and I just can't believe how many people
there are who smell like they've never...
I mean, how water and soap are very cheap?
How water is free and soap is a muya cheap?
Well, does it say how fat that guy is?
440.
Oh, okay, well, I've known people that big, haven't you?
There are places they just can't reach, like anywhere.
Rack them!
That too.
Yeah?
So what does that mean?
Have you made an excuse for this?
No, no, no, no, excuse is a reason for this thing.
I don't want to sit in the end of my heart and earn money and it's just somebody that think he smells like that.
Like the end of the world, okay?
That's the only way I can put it, like the Chinese lady,
I smell like the end of the world.
My one, now dead fat friend, reeks to high heaven.
Oh!
Of various things.
Ha ha ha ha!
Really?
Yeah.
It was a wonderful thing.
Who you've been?
It was like paparine.
Oh!
Like a poop tree.
Like a food streetman.
Indeed, very similar, yes.
Phenomenon.
So what do clients have to say about the hourlies?
Here you go.
That's it?
What do you want them to say?
Great going, guys.
Yeah, right.
Nice going.
You're coming back, you know?
So it's in December when the fall book came out, remember we were number one.
We had a gigantic book.
And then through the wintertime months, that's when we just, the whole place went in a toilet.
And that was, that was, of course, after Johnny Joe blew up the radio station, remember that?
Yep.
Blow out any K and the Humper and put on some stuff that I wouldn't wish on Hitler, you know?
And now it looks like maybe we're making a little bit of a comeback.
Plus I got rid of those bedtime stories and taking these great calls again.
They don't want to hear anybody reading bedtime no matter how important they are or how well written they are.
They don't want to hear that.
You really want to push in for it?
That's me.
Sabotura.
Mm-hmm.
Gabriella Sabotura.
Who?
448 votes on Chris' bowl.

Can we do it?

Somebody to QIAM, hello?

Hey, I just want to tell you, you're right again on another issue.
I called a couple weeks ago and talked about how, when Deputy Miller was on vacation, I turned over to a real quick as 610.
And I couldn't decipher where if it was scary or sad.
And I told him to do a shopping class up there in Port St. Louis looking for a hobby shop.
And right next door is the St. Louis County Republican headquarters.
So I said, different few minutes, trying to decipher, you know, which, which to go into, the hobby shop or the headquarters.
And asked him, you know what they're thinking about.
And I got to think, I'm kind of curious that there's any women, especially in their work in Benar.
And I said, I'm sitting there, a woman's lifestyle there with halfway out the door there.
Please answer your question.
What is the hobby shop have to do with the Stephanie Miller and whatever you were talking about?
No, I told them a shopping class, look for a hobby shop.
And I tell you this story, if you tell you another story, but so I said that.
And this is story?
I thought it'd be here.
Idiot.
56670560.560 in the Verizon's.

Yes, sir.
Hey, why is everybody making a big deal about Le Mans getting fired?
If he was fired or not?
From what I remember, he took Sonny Hurs' job.
I think Sonny Hurs died of a broken heart.
That's correct.
So basically, we're going to go ahead.
Sonny in the back, that is correct.
Yeah, and also, I was at the game.
The Philadelphia Eagles and the dolphins.
And I hope Rick knows it, by the way, that guy did die.
What guy?
You know, the guy he ran over.
You were talking about Rick's thing?
Oh, it's old news, yeah.
Okay, good.
I hope Rick knows this.
And know what the best part of a lot of these causes?
They think they're funny?
No, no.
Well, that goes without saying.
And a lot of them think that they're mysterious.
This guy was serious.
And you got serious?
Yeah, I did.

I'm telling and I don't understand why he does so badly. I mean he's got a good voice
He I don't know if he has any idea what he's talking about
I know a couple weeks ago when he was filming us for Joey got me really parked off that one morning him
And Zach was there kissing his ass
Talking about the marlins don't draw because the media keeps talking about how nobody goes to the game
I mean, that's got to be one of the dumbest things I've ever heard my life
So media's fault. It's the heralds fault that nobody goes to the marlin games because they keep reporting that nobody is going

Who?
J-Lino
When you think it'd be something really important
Look at that, it's sunny in 77
Right here
Just some white puffy clouds in the sky
No rain in the next four days
Looks like a beautiful weekend
And some of us aren't going to be working for a long time
For 12 days
Futsi
513 votes on your poll menu
Are really on fire with it, that poll crap
All right
And we just got a few minutes left
I bet you're going to get some great calls
There aren't any on there right now
And that's because the delays got to build up
Once it does, they're going to come out of the woodwork like crazy
These last few minutes
You think?
So, hey guys, congratulations on being number three and men on a station that is clueless
You can't complain about the leadership there because you haven't got any
Oh, and I take that back, they're leading us right into the toilet
Don't forget we got the jerk show coming up at 2
You want to listen because you never know what day you'll tune in at 2 and he won't be there
Come on, Andrew
That's what Georgia's saying
I mean, I don't you think it's kind of a low blow to be saying to somebody I'm going to miss you?
No
I'm not going to miss you, that would be a low blow
No, fill up the door, hit the ass on the way out, that would be a low blow
And I want you to try to say he knows he's on the way out
I'm pretty sure he does
We've got a two-share
Night time, we got a, uh, uh, four-share
We got a 10 o'clock, we got nobody listening
Oh, point, oh, nobody
No, sorry
That's what I'm saying, I think that number is a little bit too high for them in the afternoon
Oh, two, yeah, that's a two-point
Oh, I never thought of that
Actually, a whole number, you know
Yeah, how do you spell that?
H, WDQAM, hello
Hey, Neil, do you hear me?
Yes, sir
How come you don't like to feel hungry anymore?
WDQAM, hello
What the f***ing goes?
WDQAM, hello
Hey, Neil, hey, I know you guys are working on getting that instant messaging
What I understand is, uh, oh, coming at your jack there has instant messaging on his show
And they won't give it to you yet
He's got, he's got text messaging on his show?
No, no, he's his aim
Oh, okay, I know, I'm sorry, I mean, it's time, I was just curious
Well, we could do that too, I don't want to do that
Yeah, I know you could
It's a message of something like that, must be
Yeah
Have a good vacation buddy, and, uh, congratulations on hitting number for you and your...
Thanks, pal, you're welcome
Thank you, thank you
Yeah, number three, well, how the mighty have fallen, man
We're in number three and excited about it
But these last two and a half years, this wrecking crew has come in there and it's like, uh, just unbelievable
And you tell me all these tales about Power 96 with all this, uh, the, uh, promote, outside promotion and build boards and craft, bus signs
Yeah, well, you know all about that
Never, of course, and given away money to buy the audience, stuff like that
Mm-hmm
How did they do, by the way? I guess they went up a little bit
Sorry, did we off my fan? I had to reach back and grab my credit
Well, all we got is men 2554, that's not their demo anyway
So that's what they would say, oh, that's not our demo anyway, we don't care about that, we're into punks
We're into Quentin and Queenagers, not into, uh, yeah
Old guys like 26, 28
And neither of mine
WDQAM, hello
But, like, number three is the right thing to number two, and then, it was all they heard, because they're not gonna be going to number one
WDQAM, hello
QAM, hello
Neil
Yes
Good afternoon
Good afternoon, sir
Uh, we'll be back
You're gonna make it the right?
A week from next Tuesday, yeah
A week from next Tuesday, a couple other things real fast, uh, why do you do radio station play?
You may have two different radio stations playing the same, we're working at the same time, what's up with that?
Conspiracy, it's a comic conspiracy, communist, a communist, uh,
Okay, last thing here is, uh, uh, the reason why, hot 105 is number one, they got this new guy on
It's a syndicated show and it's pretty good, you know, they get from music, good conversation and stuff like that
I doubt that
Yeah, y'all get that, man
No thanks
All right, it's very vacation
Thanks
And we got this new guy on, I don't know what his name is, and he's, uh, talking all kinds of good crap, and uh, yeah
You believe that?
No
How 105 my ass
514 vote, man, not only we get to 500, but we ease down by
Aren't you proud of us?
Very
And of course the important number is the ones that are arbitrawn, we do it, you know, we're gonna be, uh, spending some big bucks off those ratings bonuses
Hey listen, you know, you give me a, and I know you're, I feel the same way, but
The fact that the matter is the idea that we would ever collect another penny bonus, or under the present regime
This is a miracle, but I want one of those people that's big on bragging and miracles, but this is a friggin miracle
I had abandoned all hope
Oh my god
And this guy's just like, uh, Obrubius, he seems to be a detached from reality
Everything he's put on there, like you said, if he likes it, it's gonna be a disaster
And we'll fail
Bad?
Misrubly, like the Kenyan Woe Morning Show
WDQ-Y-M, hello
Hey Neil, how you doing?
Okay, sir
Did you want you to do the last night?
They had a reporter ask McCain whether he like boxers or brief
He says, the pen

No, it looks like it might be off
Why?
Looks like it might be off
It might not happen?
Yeah
Or then how is anybody gonna jump on the bandwagon with the Marlins?
Well, they got Arthur Rhodes
You know, Dusty Rhodes
Dust it off, Dusty
Like Ross P. Row would say
Gotta roll up your sleeves and dust off if they old studies and do do do do
I thought they were talking like this was already done deal the Ramirez deal
If they just bought war, yeah
And they got till four o'clock deadline?
Yep
I get the distinct impression that the Jeffrey Luria David Samson, that perfect of there
They're trying to like put on the act that I've seen since the team's a shocked out of everybody
And they're in the position they are right now almost standing in first place
Put on this act of like, oh, we're really gonna try to put together a winner
We're gonna do this because they want that stadium, man
They are on the edge of their seats, they're peeing in their pants wanting that damn stadium
Wanting you people to show up money at a time when nobody can even afford to fill their gas tank
They want the public to build on the stadium
For a product that nobody cares about
Like I've said before, it's like selling lots of balls to these Saudi Arabians
And that's the place you want to be really you want to be pissed off?
Be pissed off at the Saudis, baby
You want to drop one a bombah?
That's the place to drop the big one
Wipe those bastards off the mat, take all the oil first and then wipe them off the mat
Am I right?
Yes
Sure, absolutely
Don't stop there in Saudis, smut the heads
And in my building here, I've got all these Muslims and a lot of the women have the whole burko
But a whole thing over their face, and you want to know why they cover up their face?
For the ugly?
Because they're right, that's right, because their husbands insist on it
Otherwise they couldn't be reproducing like rabbits, like rabbits
That would be a good pull question, who makes the most babies? What group of people?
Orthodox Jews, Catholics, Muslims, who else?
Mormons
Oh yeah
You picking on Donnie and Marie again?
No, just say it
I can't wait to find out how her next nervous breakdown is coming

Yeah, $15 a second thing made
Yeah, and what's great about it is on the radio broadcast and then in USA today on the frontset.net.com
It's a record profit, but it's okay because it's not as much the experts thought they were going to make it
Right, they fell short of the Wall Street email is dry
Yeah, terrible
Okay, I'm going to over and enjoy it
And over and enjoy being rafedded by the big world companies and by the big crux like Bush and Cheney and all of them
That's what the world is all about, all new people waiting for you know, I mean I like Obama a lot
And I think he's got good intentions, but you don't think they say about good intentions?
No
What did they say?
They go to hell on a hand basket
BASS IN THE BASS GET
What happened to that music?
Oh, I shut the browser down
Oh, you already schmucked it and we're packing it up
Oh, I got another vote on the poll. I got 13 mad dogs out of 1-11. I got them by 2
You have the weakest link
WQ-A-M, hello
Neil would all short drilling get a become a reality
Let me ask you this, our chicken is going to pee
Oh, how sad
WQ-A-M, hello
Good afternoon, Neil
Good afternoon, sir
I agree with you about the stadium and as far as the gas prices, Neil
What sort of feel like we're getting a break now?
We can get a gallon of gas for 387
Yeah, right where they want it
That's right, it's a psychological game
They lift it up to they just a grotesque number
And then they knock it off a few cents
They say, oh, what a bargain you're getting now
And the public says, yeah, yeah, that's good
And not to change the subject, you talk about lineups
The best lineup in history on the radio is Rick and Suggs in the morning
You were 50 days
I know, okay, thanks
boring
How many times have we heard that?
Right, you talk about me living in the past
At least I'm not wanting to do that
And you need to remind
That's it, yeah, we're good
When you know what little Bob, Neil said
We tried everything to make money with you guys
And we can't do it so our hope and passion can do better
A meeting from a hell
Now there's this something in the past that won't forget
Little Bob Neil from Consular Broadcast
He's from Cuxillhoes Broadcasting
Standing up there in the stage and belittling
All the people that work their asses off
To try to make money in that place
And come to find out after they did so
I remember how passion, when passion owned
As the log was full all the time
At least they had a really professional sales department
I mean they didn't have no PD linear
I think that could but or Andrew
But nevertheless
WDQ-YM, hello
Neil, how's the Sydney Rosenbergs, uh, uh, uh, uh, nervous
Bad
Bad
Is it coming over to Cuxillhoes?
What?
Is it coming over to Cuxillhoes?
Not bad enough to be on Cuxillhoes, I'm not that bad
Maybe you can put them on a night
You can break that point
And get the minus in front of it
You know, when you look at that, I mean you've got that sheet right there
Don't you with the tap-skam with the Arleys?
No
And you're starting at 8 o'clock
I mean this kid
I don't know what is he thinking
Who?
VA
He's got a prominent grant
He's following dead air but he's got a point one
A point five
A zero and a 1.0
And he's not even his hour
That's the SPN radio at 11
So the three hours he's on
He's got a point one, a point five, and a 0.0
So he ended up as a point six divided by three as a point two average
How can you
What?
That live
You know what I'm saying? I'm sure he does
Does he live?
I think they take him
Does he breathe? Does he move?
Does he fart? Does he smell?
A 0.0
Well maybe he's just kind of like radio-ish
Maybe he doesn't take it too seriously
We can only hope
And we're sure he's going to miss Jerk
He's coming up next to two o'clock
We're going to miss him real bad
When Gildi makes a comeback
Or whoever
The biggest name
