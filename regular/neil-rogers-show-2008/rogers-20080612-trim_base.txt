You're watching WAM by M.
Wafs.
Oh yeah.
We're gonna be real dangerous today.
560W, July 5th, the Neil Wenger show.
Oh!
WQAM.
You can kick my rear end.
It's the old new Leverto Beaver starring Barbara Gillingsley, Hugh Beaumont, Tony Dough, and Clint Eastwood as the Beaver.
Well, Beaver, you broke your brother's trophy, didn't you?
Yeah.
So what?
Well, Beaver, you've been told time and time again not to touch Wallace things, haven't you?
Oh, yeah, Dad.
But I was just target practicing in my bedroom.
Right out of your box, I need to use something.
Well, I think the first thing you should do is to tell your brother how sorry you are about this whole thing.
Oh, really?
Why is that?
Because you're a little snake, that's why.
Well, I think I can handle this.
Beaver?
No, I don't know.
You don't know if you're sorry?
I don't know if Wally wants me to say I'm sorry.
Well, Wally?
Yeah, that's okay, but just a trophy.
Anyway, it's not real gold.
Yeah, you're telling Wally.
Let me ask you a stupid question.
Did Beaver ever have a real name?
What was his name?
Oh, no, I can't remember.
Oh, yeah.
Hang on.
Sure, Beador.
Oh, that's right, very good.
Theodore?
Well, no, what are they called in Beaver?
What's the name of Beador?
Right, Theodore.
Right, 10, Ted is okay.
Teddy.
Hey, Teddy.
Yeah.
The Theodore.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, when Barbara Billingsley would get bent out of shape,
she'd start calling Theodore, and then she'd go into that
bubonising of hers.
That was...
Excuse me, I speak chive.
That was the best.
Oh, God, I was.
That is one of the best movies I've ever made.
By the way, in case you don't know when you probably already do.
Anything like that, any little clip from a movie like that that you want to see,
it's all on YouTube.
Like, if you just want to see that scene, it's on YouTube.
Anything you want.
It's already on YouTube.
Really?
I could go find it right now.
Barbara Billingsley talking chive?
Yeah.
Here's the poll from yesterday.
It's going to take till midnight to read the damn thing.
Oh, God.
Well, we'll get rid of this when we get to a thousand votes.
So vote a lot on it.
We got eight something.
What do we got?
Eight, 60.
Oh, yeah.
We'll get to a thousand this hour, I think.
Or whenever.
Take the wish-mix.
You can't.
What?
Takes two minutes just to scroll through it.
Oh, yeah.
I mean, it's going to take me till midnight just to read all the-
And of course, I got to do them all and do justice to all of them.
It's a tight game.
It's a shame.
I forgot we can't play that.
Anyway, there it is.
What a way to start a bit.
Yeah.
This is sheer-
Anyway, I'll email you the link.
He was trying to bring me-
He was trying to bring me-
I'll straighten down.
And by the way, John McCain is-
What I tell you-
Crazy, then a bed bug.
Oh, it's not important when they come back of the troupe.
He's-he's a lunatic.
He's a staggy old nut job.
Period.
Which is good.
That's exactly what we need.
What was the most depressing movie ever made?
Brian's song, 71.
It's been on top from the get-go, as they say.
And whoever says get-go, they ought to be shot.
Let's see, now what about when we did this to the other time?
I'm sure it was-
No, it was not.
Requiem for a dream, one by 25 vote.
Look at that.
What's this all about?
I don't think our audience now has seen Requiem for a dream.
You better do your homework, folks.
About 100 degrees in the shade.
It cost 80 bucks to fill up your gas tank.
So I would go out and get Requiem for a dream.
And then you'll realize, hey, you think you've got problems, right?
But you'll feel much better about your own life.
If you have one.
I have no lie now.
Brian's song, 71.
Old Yellow 57.
Requiem for a dream, only 55.
The deer 139.
Sophie's choice, 34.
Leave you Las Vegas, 30.
Elephant Man, 28th.
That was a late edition.
Up to.
Midnight Express, 25.
Oh, let's go take a shower.
That was a true story.
What was his name?
Who?
Den.
Oh.
Bread.
Pit.
No.
Midnight Cowboy 25.
Davis.
Bread Davis.
Oh, it's Jordan's.
I speak, John.
Oh, cool.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing.
Well, she's not going to say a Shiite.
All right.
What we got for you, son?
He said that she's in great pain and he wants to know if you could help me.
All right.
Well, you tell him to just relax and I'll be back as soon as I can with some medicine.
Just hang this blood.
She could have said she'll probably read that out of me.
I'm not going to read his notes.
I'll write him.
All right.
I was going to say, uh, I know.
Terms of Endearment 23, Cuckoo's Nest 22, Saving Rhymes Privates 21, Love Story 19.
Oh, that was depressing.
Ray Milan was in that.
I was the heartless father, you know.
I never saw that movie.
Really?
Really?
Well, you didn't miss the thing.
I was like, don't you?
Thank God.
Ali McGraw.
That's Ray Milan.
Yeah.
Love.
Why do they make those kinds of movies?
Because they can.
I get people are too happy because there's a lot of people.
They're really people.
I want to go see that.
They're too many happy people in the world.
They need to be brought down.

Nine for West Eden Gilbert Gravesisler running the Green Mile Titanic Philadelphia and looking for Mr. Goodbar.
Eight for City of God.
Seven, mask the Champ Glinger Eglund Ross cast away the last American version of Graves' Arat Deliverance.
What was depressing about Deliverance?
I guess they didn't like what happened.
Why not?
I don't know.
Not a happy ending?
Yeah, it was fine.
I couldn't sure what was special.
You?
Six for the Kilomockingbird Ghost Beaches JFK, the House of Sand and Faw, Kramer versus Kramer.
Five for Blade Runner, Bulley and Lenny.
Four for my life, Bridges of Madison County of Mice and Men.
I'll watch that someday.
You said O'Jacket born free on the beach.
Irreversible monsters, balls, El Norte.
Three, a whole bunch of mad trees.
Saddest music in the world, Charlie.
All mine to give, raging bull.
Dancer in the dark, the pianist.
Happiness, clockwork orange.
I don't think there was anything depressing about that.
No.
Thought it was one of the all-time greatest.
There's funny, funny ending.
Well, the people of these three people have voted maybe a little dim.
AT, the hour is death in Venice, breaker, marante, Romeo and Julietta.
Romeo and Julietta.

He jumped off the telehatchy bridge, Robbie.
Yes he did.
I did it with him.
Topped off the bridge?
No.
Citizen Kane won and Magnolia won.
Don't start with that fact stuff again.
You went over the top.
I think I had my fact quotient for the rest of the week yesterday.
With that limited whiteing stuff that you started in.
Yeah, yeah.
No votes.
None.
Out of 800 and almost 900 votes.
None.
For the sorrow and the pitty suddenly last summer, deep impact running on empty jungle fever.
Bloody Sunday under the volcano, the professional, a beautiful mind, the crossing guard,
the lovers and the cube.
Rhymes with...
Tube!
Rhyme.
And cube.
So there's that a lot of depressing movies.
But like I said, some of them, if you watch some of the real trials and tribulations of the people in the movies,
you think, oh, I'm doing so much better in my own life than I thought it, then I realized.
Life could be a lot worse.
So what do you think?
I think we switch it now.
Do you think that's a good idea?
No.
Why?
I just wanted to say no.
What a bastard.
God.
Why you want to be negative today?
We got all positive stuff going on today except for Jolly Jobelle, who feels that we need to...
we need to hear about every hostile or negative or critical email that he gets.
I'm going to start forwarding all the fan mail that we get.
You, me, both Chris, anybody.
Yeah, that's you take a long time.
Sure.
Here's the new poll.
Which talentless child of privilege capitalized best on his or her family's fame and fortune.
And what a good list we've got.
Joel Feinberg, Paris Hilton, John F. Kennedy, Jr.
Oh, yeah, JFK Jr. I'm putting that.
He was just...
I mean, I...
Okay, so he died in a plane crash, but in the meantime he had no talent.
His magazine was boring.
He was boring.
He had nothing.
Anderson Cooper, Ashley Simpson, Casey Affleck, Greg Gumball, Donald Televersacee, Nicole Richie, Donald Trump Jr.
See, again, then we just do this poll?
No.
We talked about it.
I read the poll.
I talked about it.
And I asked who the hell's Donald Trump Jr.
And we didn't know then and we don't know now.
Maybe is this from Sean from Hollywood by a chance?
No.
Who's this from?
I don't know.
From Shamrock.
Right.
It's definitely Shane.
What's wrong with Charlie Shane?
I mean, I'm not a big fan of him.
Nothing good.
But, you know, his...
Yeah, I just...
Sophia Coppola, I'm on a team.
George W. Bush, Paris Hilton and Joel Feinberg.
A magnificent bunch of choices there for you.
And we've already got a smattering of votes on the new poll.
Yeah, that will be poll.
The depressing will be poll.
Depressing.
Enough with that crap.
Middle of the summertime, it's 100 degrees in the shade.
One thing you don't want to do is get everybody all depressed.
Now, today is Thursday.
What means it noon?
And it's also the second of last day of the full,
a neoscadial here until the summer schedule starts on Monday.
Nothing I'm looking forward to that.
I think like that.
Or even better news.
Now, we're going to have another winning night of Woodbine last night.
But the guy who was threatening to stalk you,
you know, he didn't come by.
He wasn't there.
Or I'll see you inside me.
Or maybe he just was standing in the off to the side, staring.
Luring.
Lurking.
Luring.
Luring and lurking.

Which talentless child of privilege capitalized most?
Uh-huh.
On his or her family's name in fortune.
I'm not saying I agree with him, but I mean...
Oh, I thought the implication is that they had famous parents.
Family.
Alright.
It could be a sibling.
It could be like a John.
I mean, if he wants to, I don't think he qualifies, but...
Why not?
I mean, he's not, you know, great or gay busters, but...
Well, so what about Charlie Sheen?
Alright.

Gas prices.

Mm-hmm.
Speaking of a reality show,

Why does anybody care about Gene Simmons anymore?
Or, or, or, or, or did?
Well, if you were a kiss fan, like I am.
Then the offense 100 years ago.
It's a funny show, though.
I've never watched it.
By the way, we got an email suggestion for George Bush for the poll.
The original?
This one.
No, W.
The one that's leading the poll right now.
EW.
23 votes.
He's leading the poll.
But that always happens.
You know, in other words, don't look at it,
or don't wait till I read the result.
In fact, I just got through reading the results,
and I read his name, but ready.
Well, somebody, you're so negative today.
I don't understand.
I think you're probably sour,
because, you know, that's starting next week.
You're going to be working to do in the show three days a week.
That's sour at all.
And having to come up with a poll three days a week.
Wow.
That's going to be a really tough ass assignment.
It's a challenge.
Maybe your close friends out there, Charlie B, and Sean from our label.
That's right.
Send your whole batch of new polls.
New refreshing, great, and Liz.
Come on, all you people.
Liz?
Yes.
Who's Liz?
Who's Liz?
The poll that we're using right now is hers.
Shamrock?
Yeah, once you get her, you're going to be able to address out
on the air too, hypocrite.
What are you talking about?
Well, you are a real bastard this year, and I've said,
it's a good thing I'm not going to be here much next week.
After a little whole summertime.
You're a bastardo this week.
You are giving me a meal today.
I'm going to have a hit with it.
I'm dumb.
What else?
What else?
What else?
What else do people call me?
You're giving me your meal addresses out on the air.

little with mine.
Okay.
Like Joe Bell.
Oh, and Kelly Osborne.
Hey, there you go.
Give his email address out on the air.
I don't want it.

Oh, we already had this story.
Sorry, Brandon, about the stalker filming himself masturbating itself.
Oh, no, this is a different.
I'm sorry.
Remember that one?
Yeah.
Now where's this from?
Does it have like a location, anything like that?
No.
That's the daily telegraph, so it's Brit.
Then Brit's man, they're really busy.
A stalker filmed himself masturbating and sent it to his victim's mobile phone while she was a
police station making it complaint about him.
The video gave police the evidence they needed to charge him.
The G-LONG advertiser reports.
What is that?
The G-LONG advertiser.
Sounds fresh.
No.
Benjamin Baker, 27, of Princess Highway and Coriob Victoria pleaded guilty in G-LONG
magistrate's court.
Well, this must be Australian.
Doesn't it sound?
Does?
Does stalking and using a telecommunications device to harass?
Police prosecutor Sheeten Shotton, S-E-A-T-O-N.
How would you say it?
Seatten?
Well, Alyssa said Baker repeatedly harassed his victim by phone and sent her a video of him
masturbating.
Unfortunately for Baker, one of his video calls was made while the one was at her local
police station laying it complaint.
She was laying it.
The victim answered the call to find Baker again masturbating and she showed the officer
taking her statement, seeing her constable a little stole the court.
Magistrate Tim McDonnell called Baker's conduct, disturbing and finding three grand.
His conduct was disturbing.
Quit disturbing everybody.
Okay, put that thing away.
People are starting to talk.
You idiot.
Now, what's this?
Oh boy.
Somebody sent this into us.
Neil, I hope you had a great chavuice.
I didn't even know it was chavuice.
You're not doing a good job of keeping me up to it in the start.
I got my calendar right here.
And when was chavuice?
When is some historic?
That's what I'd like to know.
June 9th was chavuice.
The first day of next when you got to look forward to his tish above.
Or tish above, that's one of my very favorites.
Even the glam can enjoy tish above all day.
Sunday August 10th.
Really?
August 10th?
Yeah.
You know his birthday that is, don't you?
No.
Paco.
Oh, well, happy birthday.
It's a long ways off.
Not far enough though.
Problem gamblers hit Ontario casinos with a $3.5 billion lawsuit.
This is right up my alley, baby.
I'll illegally, I don't know what, I got a streak going.
It's just done cany.
I don't know where it is.
One another thousand bucks last night.
In fact, that'll cover that check that I might send to a courtist this week.
I'll get around to it.
Don't let me forget about it.
Okay.
I just don't like being like one of those people every time somebody snaps their fingers.
You just, oh, I'm going to go into the room right now and put it in the mail.
I'll get around to it.
You know, right now I don't want to.
I'll get around to it today or tomorrow.
A $3.5 billion proposed class action lawsuit has been launched on behalf of thousands of
addicted gamblers who led to the a** to be barred from Ontario's casinos, but we're still
allowed in.
I bet your Maurice was in this.
Crazy Maurice, the frog.
The suit was filed against the Ontario Lottery and Gaining Corporation on Tuesday in Toronto,
claiming that the corporation did not do enough for those who signed up for a self-exclusion.
A program that allows people to have themselves banned from casinos so they can curb their ruinous,
gambling habits.
None of the allegations has been proven in court in a statement of defense as not even
filed.
Those who signed up for the program are photographed and registered and their information is
stored in binders at every provincial casino.
If they're caught trying to enter casinos, they can also be arrested for trespassing.
But gamblers who spoke with CBC News on Condition of Anonymity said the program doesn't work.
One woman said she registered for the program at her gambling addiction letter back to the
casinos soon after.
I walked through and nobody even looked at me.
She said I kept gambling for next couple of years.
And losing her a** no doubt.
Lawyers say the OLG should be using high tech system to catch self-banned gamblers, and
Netherlands gamblers present photo-idead casinos and their ideas checked against the computer
database.
Lawyers say.
Lawyers Jerome Morse said the suit has designed help addicted gamblers who've lost large sums
of money in their families.
He also hopes the suit will bring about changes at casinos across the continent.
We hope it sets a precedent that not only benefits all members, but that will benefit
anyone who's subject to the dangers of gaming in North America, he said.
One thing I can't stand is gambling.
Ontario has settled nine individual lawsuits pertaining to self-exclusion, but has never
been hit with large-class action suit.
The OLG has argued in the past that it's ultimately up to the gamblers themselves to stay
away from casinos, although the corporation's expressed interest in obtaining facial recognition
technology to improve its screening process.
Like process cheese.
I bet your Maurice is involved and I maybe can get some of his money back.
I don't.
I'm on the side of the street.
He's done proud with the money.
He looks at me.
He's the sports leader.
I'm all the time.
I don't give a crap what that ferry has to say.
If you want to score things to guys that laugh.
I'll have you know.
I know what I'm talking about.
Every morning at the condo I take the elevated down and on my way to the car when I put my
clothing basket out.
I give a three condo piece.
The toys are back and pow.

Why you lose it?
I'm like a Hori, the sport whole fool.
I know everything that's going on in the news.
I'm like a Hori, the major rule.
I'm up to the judges.
Daddy O'Rooz.
Do you guys enjoy soccer today?

They also do that they write out what they want them to say they go over it. They go over. Yeah, it's all out of here
Get out of here man. They're they're told what to say. I don't think it's scripted literally, but you know
That is pathetic
What do we show that sign? I don't know
Facing assured of foreign exotic dances a group representing 53 of Ontario strip club owners is turning to immigration consultants to find a loophole in the rules governing foreign workers
The adult entertainment Association of Canada is looking for alternative legal ways to our foreign-born strippers and dancers
One way might be to use foreign student visas since foreign students can now work for 20 hours a week in any job
So the group's executive directed Tim Labrinos in 2004 then Minister of Citizenship and immigration Canada Judy's grow resigned
After extending the visa of Romanian exotic dancer who have worked for her election campaign in the wake of the public outcry
Immigration officials have been looking at each individual application and visa offices have brought around to orders to
Screen out women
I think might be victims of trafficking don't lead health criteria or don't have a way home after their visas expired
This is led to a reduction of work permits and extensions granted to foreign strippers from 4 to 23 in
2014 to just 17 in 2006 up to 98% of foreign exotic dancers who apply for visas get turned down
Sid Lambrinos. That's bad

people all the time whatever that means 5 6 7 0 5 6 you got a good we got a good
run on a call is going out we're building up some good low but I do want to
pass this along some good news for Obama people they's have to be coming as
parties presumptive nominee and receiving an endorsement from his swirly
Democrat Barack Obama's open-to-general election campaign with a six-point
edge over John McCain and the most interesting thing in the Keith Obermann was
hyperventilating about last night is the demographics where he's ahead in
other words where people thought he was going to be in big trouble and ahead
ahead match up Obama leads McCain among African Americans 83 to 7% that we
knew Hispanic 62 to 28% you following these women 52 to 33% Catholics 47 to
40 independence 41 to 36 and even blue collar workers 47 to 42% Obama's
also had among those to say voted for Clinton 61 to 19% yet among white men
who made up 36% of the electorate in the last presidential election Obama
trails McCain by 20 points 55 to 35 points that's the only reason why the
election is close white men red mix good old boys don't want to vote for no
darky that's what that's all about right you about your company with white
men and white suburban women and the poor McCain has what seemed to be even
bigger challenges they include president bush was appropriating stands at
25% as well as an electorate that wants change from the president's policies
they don't want four more years of big bush and they certainly don't want some
daughtering old fool who comes on TV and says dumber things every week that
thing with Matt Lauer about the soldiers not important when they come back tell
that to their families tell that to them I'd like I'd like to see make another one
of his 4,000 visits to his photo ops in Iraq and tell the troops outside
important when you get out of here what's important is that we're going to
win of course nobody knows what that means when it's like a Vietnam what
what what does it mean to win how do you win what we're not when all the
shears in the sue as soon as the shearings and the Kurds stop killing each other
that when you win sure when it gonna happen when we win and then then he's
then they showed a clip where he's talking about well by the end of 2013 the
troops will all be home and blah blah blah I mean the fact that he's even got
more than like 10 percent in the poll shows there's something really really
wrong
let's guess with the
Larry Fㅎ
scream and Clint Eastwood as
Alright you not go ahead be careful with my stuff don't break anything
Tested out my bed are you curly?

And the like the guy said without Bokeh Brian is sure wouldn't be squad
Is he right?
So everybody sent him a bunch of money you can use it then who get off my track
Now I'm wondering if he thinks that because I moved up his
Steipend a month this time I get the feeling that he feels it's gonna be perpetually moved up a month
And perpetuity, you know, I mean yeah, I don't know
What do you mean you don't know why do you always run away from these things?
I don't know what right away like what on the on Bokeh Brian's keeper. Yes. Oh, okay. You're a sage and you're a spokesman
I see all right. Well then let's let's talk about it
Suspected terrorists and foreign fighters held by the US military at Gitmo have the right to challenge the detention and federal court the Supreme Court rule today
the decision
Marked another legal blow to the Bush administration's war on terrorism policies in a five to four ruling the justice to
Said the US military lacks the legal autonomy to prosecute as many as 300 prisoners an issue with the rights of the
Detainees to contest their imprisonment as well as the rules established to try them in military tribunals a
Congressional law passed in 2006 would limit court jurisdiction to hear such challenges
It is a legal question the justice is to tackle three times since 2004 included is ruling
Each time the high court ruled against the government's claim that it has the authority the whole people at labels enemy combatants
Which can be anybody could be you I don't think they like your attitude
Could be a lot of these cars too their enemy combatants make no mistake about that

She found the officers to let her go but sadly police said no
No, no, no she looked like it all white
The date of only one crack
Best out of talking smacks

1117 at 560 WNQ wait till the next break man when we come back here out one of the bits that you've been dying to hear
I finally yeah
I'm not going to tell you what it is yet
Okay, I'll give you a clue
Now back to the show
Exciting huh I told you it was going to be a great day
It's a great Thursday in spite of some of the naysayers out there in radio land some of the
Some of that crowd we don't care we just don't care
We don't give a crap here's a very disturbing story by the way secret plan to kill internet by 2012 leaked
Some question if reports that pay-per-view system to be introduced as a hope but wider march to regulate the web is documented
By Paul Joseph Watson. Oh on prison plan. Oh well there a little little bit of a little paranoid little uh, you know what I mean?
Yeah
ISPs have resolved to restrict the internet to a tv-like subscription model where users will be forced to pay to visit selected corporate websites by
2012 while others will be blocked
According to a leaked report
Despite some people dismissing the stories of hoax the wider plan to kill the traditional internet and replace it with the regulated and controlled internet to is manifestly provable
Both bell Canada and tell us employees officially confirmed that by
2012 ISPs all over the global reduced internet access to a tv-like subscription model only offering access to a small standard amount of commercial sites and require extra fees for every other site you visit
These other sites within lose all the exposure and eventually shut down
Resolving in what could be seen is the end of the internet's ones a report that spread like wildfire across the web over the last few days
The article which is accompanied by a you
CHIEW! clip
Says the time magazine writer Dylan Patton has confirmed the information is about to release a story and that the movie will effectively shut down
The web could come as soon as 2010 and it's got the clip right here in the story right away
It'll be on our website tomorrow. I'm sure nobody will watch it
People have raised questions about the report's accuracy because the claims aren't backed by another source only the promise that a time magazine report is set to confirm the rumor
Until such a report emerges many have reserved judgment or outright dismissed the stories of hoax
What is documented as the story on the scores is the fact that tell us this wireless web package allows only restricted pay-for-view access to a selection of corporate and news websites
This is the model that the post 2012 internet will be based on
People have noted that the authors of the video seem to be more concerned about getting people to subscribe with their you
CHIEW! accounts than fighting for the net neutrality by
probably featuring an attractive woman who isn't shy about showing her cleavage. They're just hanging out here
just about
Best majority of the other you
CHIEW! videos hosted on the same account consist of bizarre avant-garde satire skits that they have with the same people featured in the internet freedom clip
This is prompted many to suspect that the internet stories merely a stunt to draw attention to the group
I wouldn't have to use one oh yeah
Well, let us know now. Let's see 2012
That's four years away and we got five and a half years ago. What are we gonna do then? Well, we'll come up with something else by then
I'm sure we will by then the good callers will be back

Technical history are going on yeah, and now we finally got the phone back and there's now one light ringing right now
Look at that there's not one line ringing blinking the whole whole got a second out caller

Even lionates not ringing of course. It's so discontinued now
We think that that to me is just it's hysterical well looking all the money Joe Bell is gonna save the bees
He's now he's gonna be the hero. He's gonna show him how to make up the transmitter off to save him a lot of money
That's a good idea in fact their day part times of the day when it'd be probably a public service
Just shut down the transmitter look at all the juice you're gonna save
Johnny Joe you idiot
Wtq.a.m. Hello

Trust me what I'm saying is
Well, yeah, it's a clone. It's another wannabe
Because the one thing not only they lack any material but
The closest that they'll come to finding any is to is to do a weak imitation of somebody else's material
So it wasn't good enough material right right
If somebody else's crap
That would be like taking a dump and it turns out that really with somebody else's you know what I mean?
Oh, yeah, I know it's not easy to fathom that but I get in this in this crowd
I think I think we don't get named the best talent

I sure was me too am still she was at the house yesterday
What is she the show Neil?
We're gonna Q a m. Hello. Oh, Neil how you doing? Okay, sir
Just the question would you class this show under a political or a comedy show?
Just that a curiosity if you had the party it's not a categorized show. It's it's it's the show
Whatever it is. It's a WTF show
Right you had to put one of categories. I don't have to and I'm not gonna
But what I don't know why I don't want I don't want if you had to if you had to categorize your life and
Really that all besides pathetic and ponderous. I don't know what else I would say
I think that would cover it all if I see there goes again pick it on the cars you so rude of the cars
I would love to know what it is that anybody has ever said on this show that I cut off
There was worthwhile hearing that that when it was oh it was worthwhile right
In fact, I could have rebate that mm-hmm five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty and leave a rise in singular wireless line still looking for our first lady caller of the day

I'm great. I just got through telling it. He does nothing to do with whether I take calls or not
That's not what he wanted to hear

Is it perient? I don't know what to tell you he told in his paper. I think it's odd and interesting. It's part of life
It's not part of my life converting with sexually aroused farm animals, but nevertheless
Yal Kaczynski the judges film editors son told the New York Times yesterday that the site is registered to him and he maintains it friends and family are able to post it
There he said the fact that it was publicly accessible actually is my fault to Yal Kaczynski for the newspaper. I made a mistake configuring it
Neither father nor son make clear Wednesday who posted the images in question
Judge Kaczynski said earlier that he didn't believe any of them were obscene
He's spend it until Monday the trial of Ira Isaacs who's charged with obscenity for selling movies depicting
Bestiality and extreme fetishes involving feces in urination. I'll start to do that in a minute or lunch
Sorry, a pellet judge is such as Kaczynski occasionally handled trial court cases
Kaczynski told others in the case he wanted to give them time to consider whether or not to be disqualified
Federal prosecutors are discussing their options department of justice lawyer Kenneth Wooded said
At best the exposure of his website was embarrassing turn in vents for Kaczynski who reached the pinnacle of a long illustrious and colorful judicial career in November
When he was appointed chief judge of the 90 West Circuit Court of Appeals which has jurisdiction over nine Western states
The appointment kept a 26 year career on the bench that began in 1982 at age 32 when he was named chief of the newly created federal claims court
Which handles lawsuits related to federal contracts?
Three years later president Reagan appointed him to the 9th Circuit making him the youngest federal pellet judge in the country
President George Herbert Walker Bush seriously considered nominating Kaczynski for I court openings in 1991
Even though the jurist hasn't received the same considerations from Bush Jr
Still Kaczynski enjoys a sterling reputation as an eloquent opinion writer and a titan on the bench even while his off-the-benture
San Fristonies run the gamut
Kaczynski 57 was born and romamed into Holocaust survivors and came to America when he was 12 six years later
He won a date in 1968 while appearing on the TV show the dating game after greeting the contestant with good afternoon flower of my heart
He purports to build his own computers and say was an authority on snowboarding while successfully vying to win gossip blogs contest for judicial hottie
Seven years ago we engaged Washington DC federal court administration a battle over web
Filters that they installed a block porn from government computers the computer savvy Kaczynski walked into a government computer room in San Francisco
And personally disabled the film is from three appellate circuits including his own touching off a feud with administrators and ultimately one when they stop blocking porn
I do like that. I think the judge is you know a little freaky is what he is
But to each its own, you know, yep
Maybe he likes animals
So how are we doing with that thing?
Let me refresh 30 30 us nine no there goes another one

At least 14 Republican members of Congress are refused to endorse or publicly support
Senator John McCain for present, and more than a dozen others declined to answer whether
they back the Arizona Senator.
Many of the recalcitrant GOP members declined to detail their reasons for withholding support,
but Representative John Peterson, Republican and Pennsylvania expressed major concerns
about McCain's energy policies and representative Walter Jones and North Carolina's side of
the war in Iraq.
A handful of other Republicans on Capitol Hill made the distinction between endorsing
and supporting adding that while they haven't yet endorsed they do support McCain.
Right.
In recent weeks, much of the discussion in debate about party unity has been on the Democrat
side amid their protracted presidential primary, achieving harmonies and concern on both
sides of the aisle this year.
It's not unusual for certain factions of the Democratic and Republican parties not
to embrace the respective candidates for president.
McCain's campaign sees that Senator Crats' reticence about Barack Obama issuing a release
on Tuesday that highlighted the representative Dan Boren is an endorsing the presumptive
nominee.
While some conservative Democrats have yet to endorse Obama and didn't back John Kerry
in 2004, there are both centrist and conservative Republicans representing various parts of the
country or not embracing McCain.
Throughout his career in the House and Senate, McCain's been in odds with his party on
a range of issues including campaign finance reform, earmarks, immigration, healthcare,
taxes, and energy.
Some Senate Republicans were especially hurt when McCain's role in the gang of 14 V-line
judicial nominations.
Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado has been sharply critical of McCain and immigration,
told the Hill and February, I don't like McCain, I don't like him at all.
And I second that emotion, I don't like him at all.
Kind of like Swirlery, I feel the same way about him that I do about her.
Don't like them at all.
Maybe that British guy will call in.
Oh, geez, why call me both?
He was, he was just foaming at the moment.
That's good though.
Yeah, maybe he came up with that.
And that was actually a real call.
Yeah, maybe we'll clean off his teeth a little bit.
I'll let foam.
Look at that phone, baby.
Look at that.
The hole on the phone.
Yeah.
Not a call on the board.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 6, see this is what cracks me up about those people who scream
and holler for the phones.
Oh, the show just isn't the same without the callers.
Are you with the callers make the show?
Yeah.
Or where are they?
Every time I do this, it's the same story.
Right.
They just can't keep up the mo.
They can't maintain the mo.
WDQA and hello.
As we were saying, George, now.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 and pound 5, 60 in the Verizon and Singular wireless line.

Listen, I'm white and I have a black wife.
And I want to know with the rate to stop it with,
why can they get on I'm just for saying certain things or you can't say the N word,
which is perfectly understandable.
Why can everyone get on the radio stations and TV and like Joe Rose and such?
White trash, this, white trash, that.
If we start saying black trash, it's on that very racist.
I mean, I'm far from racist, but what is your take on that?
Isn't that racist comment?
That's my take.
Isn't white trash, but racist comment to be saying on the airways?
No.
Okay, but if we say the other way, it would be taken as racist.
That's correct.
Now you got it.
Now you catch it on.
Okay.
Take it a little while.
It will slow.
You're catching on.
560, 705, 60, 560 and they Verizon,
sing it a while on trailer trash.
See is better.
White trash, then you get into race.
Trailer trash, then that's more general, right?
Sure.
How we do with a certificate, by the way, we got 39 still?
Yep.
You got to be kidding me.
We started with only 50.
WDQA and hello.
QA and?
Barack Obama is the second coming of it.
WDQA and hello.
It's Barack Obama.
It's Barack Obama.

WDQA and hello.
Neil.
Yes.
I'm love at the bulk and I've got singular and I use pound five-sixty and it doesn't work
because it can't be completed as dial.
Yeah.
It's because you have singular.
Are you aware of that?
It's a talk-off.
It's because he is singular.
It's Verizon and singular wireless is one of our FACNC.
How can you have singular?
Okay.
I've got FACNC singular.
I didn't know there was a difference.

Okay.
Okay.

Hello.

WDQA and hello.
Hello.
Yes.
I'm Neil.
Yes.
Yeah, I was wondering.
One of these FUShing OSHOIs, but that was today.
Last week.
Last week.
Yeah.
Oh, it's on your website.
Let me say it again.
Last week.
It shouldn't be on our website because Eric should be taking all of that stuff off of there.
It's outdated.
It's on the top of the thing.
It's on QA and.com.
Okay.
It's a commercial thing.
It doesn't belong on NeilRogers.com.
And how it got on there.
I haven't got any idea.
Eric was trying to be helpful and it was helping a little bit too much.
Did that take it up before the show today?
And didn't we say he was going to all of that stuff?
He did it right away.
It's not even on there.
It's not even on there.
It's not even on there.
Once it's gone, it's gone.
Okay, Schmuck.
Oh, Sean Permanke tour.
WDQA and hello.
We are.
That's not.
QA and hello.
Hey, how you doing?
Hello.
Hello, hello to George too.
Yep.
Hey, I'm a, um, I'm a, um, rabbit atheist.
And, uh, I was wondering if you guys could clarify a couple things about the Bible for me, because I, you know, I've read, I read, and the guide to the Bible.
And, uh, I've heard enough about it that, you know, it doesn't make any sense to me, but I was having a heated discussion with some Christians the other day.
And, um, I brought up some of the ridiculous stuff like, you know, being killed for working on Sunday and killing your kids as they misbehaved.
And, uh, they insisted that I was nuts, that that stuff's not in the Bible.
And, uh, or go to Bible.
But a Bible.com, it has a search engine, find anything you want in the Bible.
I'm sorry.
And a version of the Bible.
Bible.com.
So the Bible for any phrase, any word, any version.
When they said, uh, they go, uh, Leviticus.
I'm sorry.
Leviticus.
Oh, okay.
Levit, uh, get going.
Uh, and they said, they said, oh, that's the old testament. That's, and that's not.
Okay, but I ask you a question.
Why would you dignify such garbage while I was wasting your time with it?
Why would you, well, what's the point?
Well, you know, it's just that we're at a party and somebody said something that was so ridiculous.
I had to say, like, you know, you guys call yourself Christians, but you do all these things that are so contrary to, you know, what it says to do.
This rulebook that you have of, uh, how you're supposed to, you know, behave and, uh, run your life.
And none of you guys even seem to know what's in it.
And, uh, there were several different people that just, you know, told me how close that by was.
And I was going to confront them because they said, oh, that must be the old testament.
And that's the testament.
Yeah, there you go.
So, I mean, so they're not, and I'm not, right?
Correct.
Hey, how about, uh, post-adjusting, uh, what's the most ridiculous thing in the Bible?
People living for 900 years or, um, they're long-hauled.
Yeah, there wouldn't be enough room to lift up everything.
All of it.
Well, the most ridiculous thing about the Bible is that there are people who actually believe it.
Yeah, and they said to me, will you ever ever read it?
I said, no, I read books that told, uh, the ridiculous, you know, contradictions about it, and stuff like that.
And I've heard enough about it.
No, let me say it again to you, sir.
Don't waste your energy with Kaka, okay?
Don't waste your energy with Kaka.
That is correct.
Kaka moan.
Next time they start giving you a song and a dance about all this, the good book says this, just tell Kaka moan.
Mm-hmm.
And that next time, it'll go away.
That's a catch-all.
How you doing on your poll, there, Chris?
367.
You got to shout it 500 today.
Wouldn't that be something on that new poll on a second poll?
That'd be pretty good.
That'd be pretty, uh, be a lot better if we sold those certificates for Chris, of course, is up here down there.
The biggest name.
The best talent.
The best talent.
This is a live dance.
Fortly to 5.60 QAM.
They.
Fort.
Later.
Now back to Dawn Jeopardy and your host, Alex Trebar.
We move on now to Double Jeopardy.
Sparky, you had the lowscorpy end of the last round.
Choose a category, please.
What a culture for 200.
The tough exterior covering of the common birch tree.
No, I'm sorry we cannot give that to you.
It must be in the form of a question.
What is barks?
Sparky, you still have control of the board.
Taboo's for 600.
And the answer is the new sofa and the poodle next door.
Correct.
What are two things you're not allowed on?
First little hygiene for 200.
The answer is because they can.
Sparky, no, barn barn.
Correct.
The answer is because they can.
The question, why do dogs look there?
Oh, and that means we're out of time.
We'll return with final dog Jeopardy.
Where our category will be.
Scratch and sniff.
We have to do this.
Yes, scratch and sniffers.
1231 at 5.60 WDQAM.
That's a great Thursday.
We got 80 training callers lined up here.
What's that?
What?
How do we do with the certificates, by the way?
38.
38.
There goes another one.
And I had some food and I had one of the meat patty things.
Meat patty.
Yes, meatless patties.
It was pretty good.
There.
I had like three of them.
Yep.
So I do apologize.
It's pretty good.
It's got some nice spice to it and everything.
So, the natural apology.
I said just that you're such a hard ass.
Well, I like that stuff.
It's just a pile of plate up with them patties.
I like that kind of thing.
Like a baby.
Like a baby.
I've listened.
A lot of people are superstitious about vegetarian food.
I can relate.
I used to be.
Oh, I mean, superstitious about veg.
I never heard of that.
They just, they don't think they're going to like it
because there's no meat or lard in it.
Because nothing suffered in order to make it.
So it's not going to taste good.
I'm having a smoothie.
Are you really?
Yes, I am.
Good.
You usually do that, don't you?
What?
Have smoothies?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, oh yeah.
It's like a little while.
Well, yeah, you're talking in the past now, okay?
No, no.
There's still hope for the future.
I hope so.
Yeah, good.
I doubt it though.
I don't think so.
John McCain's demonstrated non-chalance
and whether or not you guys should bring its troop song
from Iraq demonstrates that the Republican presidential candidate
is out of touch and just doesn't get the consequences
of a continued occupation.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said yesterday.
Reid issued a skating review to the Arizona Senator
after McCain's appearance on the NBC Today Show,
Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean
and Syrigans of Presidential candidate Barack Obama
also were quick to condemn McCain
after Wednesday morning's appearance.
Post Matt Lauer noted the perception that the surge
is working in asked McCain if he had a better estimate
of one American forces can come home from Iraq
to which McCain replied,
no, but that's not too important.
As he has before, such as his off-criticized 100-year statement,
McCain said the length of occupation
wasn't what was important,
but the number of casualties he has troop suffer.
So let them stay there and rot forever as long as they stay alive.
That's what really counts.
Little, little, little, little, little crazy person.
And this is the best of Republicans could come up with.
It was a total crazy old coup.
56670560,
Pound 560 on the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.
WDQ-Y-N, hello.
WDQ-Y-N, hello.
Hi, this is Nancy.
I enjoy your show mentally.
I have a question.
Yes, I do.
My question is,
last week your ratings came out.
How did you do it?
Because I was looking in the paper
and nobody wrote anything on it.
Good. That's good.
That's good that nobody wrote anything about it.
They're not good.
They won't hurt.
The station is vanishing from the earth.
That's why nobody wrote anything.
Yeah, he's just a trend.
They don't write articles about trends.
Oh, okay.
That's what Barry Jackson was going to write something
because he usually writes things about...
Especially if the guys across the street
or in the middle, he's in their pocket if they do well,
which really happens, but especially if it happens.
Okay, because I was out of town
so we can read my nephews' graduations.
I can't even write in, you know,
be able to hear what happens.
You don't want to know.
Okay, but you're not going to have to have a great day.
They sucked.
The ratings sucked.
They blew.
We don't have any.
Can't complain about a ring song.
QM because we don't have any.
But Jolly Joe is running around.
We're going to do this and we're going to do that.
You'll see, Neil.
I'll see you all right.
WQAM, hello.
Hi, Neil.
Did you see the recent time magazine article about the soldiers on Prozac
and anti-depressants?
No.
It's very interesting.
It has a stat that shows...
When the soldiers have been on three or more tours,
their incidence of mental-serious mental illness is close to 30%.
Well, don't tell us, John McCain.
Yeah, so that's what I'm saying.
Okay, thanks.
Thank you, sir.
May be he wants more people to be mentally ill, like he is, John McCain.
That's possible.
And this is where he loves companies, not what they say.
I think you're eating again.
Chop, chop.
WQAM, hello.
WQAM, hello.
I have a number one news.
WQAM, hello.
Yes.
Why do you have something again, Hitler recladen?
What is Joe and Jack?
Oh, here we go again.
Yes.
Let me ask you a question.
Let me ask you something.
Is this your one topic?
Is this all your people will be talking about?
What do you have against Hillary Clinton?
Yes, I talk about men, part on your face, part on your whole.
Every time you get some scores,
what are you talking about with cruising in the 80s?
Did they spank?
No?
Yes, I said.
Yes, I said.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
Was there any doubt?
No.
Was there any doubt that he had the other order?
56670560, 560 and they've arrived in Singular, wireless line.
Well, I got such a big throw a lot of it yesterday.
Let's come back and do the thing.
You betcha.
WQAM, hello.
How you doing, Neil?
OK.
I'm Jeff Dauter from Life in a band called Doc Hooler.
Yeah, you're in a band called the Voice in the band.
You're in.
56670560, £560 in the Verizon.
You know, the interesting part of it is,
as weak as the responses today,
when you take away the four or five, you know,
they're called 600 times a piece,
there ain't much of anything.
No.
You know what I mean?
Oh, yeah.
Kills time, though.
Oh, yeah, he kills some sensational time.
Yes, after all.
I think Kills the operative word.
How we doing with the certificates, by the way, still 38?
Refreshing right now.
38.
Not so good.
WQAM, hello.
Hey, Neil, whatever you do, man,
just don't get the right TV.
Please, don't get the right TV.
Why is that?
I have the right TV.
Oh, I think just want to keep saying it.
Got it.
I like it.
Got it down there.
Don't have it here, because it doesn't exist here.

WQAM, hello.
I'm Gavore.
QAM, hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes?
Hey, as the media given any kind of indication on who Obama is going to have his running mate at this point?
Well, what do you mean he's the media given any indication?
He hasn't decided yet.
How many of you have been in the chat?
I know, like, with McCain, there's everybody talking about Chris now.
That's going to be his running mate.
Everybody's talking about Limp Risted, Charlie, Chris?
That's all Flurb about it online earlier, so.
Well, that doesn't mean everybody's talking about it.
You saw Blurb about it, so therefore everybody's talking about it.
Well, online and also on the talking head shows.
Yeah.
Well, once they're looking to his closet, this Chris ain't going to be the running mate.
Yeah, I think it would go by on my...
I don't understand why Richardson's not talked about to be with him, and then they will fear him.
Okay.
Well, I guess they can just forget the whole, you know, vetting process, and they just call this guy,
and he'll tell him Bill Richardson's the man.
Yeah, that's it.
Has the media done a speculating yet?
Yeah.
How about we just wait till he decides and tells us who he chooses?
Wouldn't that be an interesting...
Yeah, that's no fun.
Let's speculate.
Speculate?
I will.
You're picking on Bill Richardson again.
391 votes on the poll.
We're getting close to 400, Chris.

You know, a piece by George?
I said, how's it going today?
No, sir, it's not going to happen.
I mean, where, you know, if it makes you happy, saying these things, fine.
I don't disagree with it.
What's not going to happen?
But wouldn't it be ironic?
And irony is the point I was trying to make it happen.
Let me say it again.
It isn't going to happen.
Read my lips like Daddy said.
Read my lips.
It isn't going to happen.
Yes, it would be poetic justice, but we don't have any justice.
Okay.
We're too busy, you know, busting people for having a pin droid or something.
We're asking their ass train, their car.
We don't worry about people that, you know, send folks to get killed on a war based on lies.
Okay, I got a really good article here about blame Bush, where the hell is it?
Oh, and Chuck Berry said no to John McCain.
Aren't you impressed by that?
Medium impressed.
That doesn't blow you away.
The fact that Chuck Berry turned down McCain.
He said, hell, I don't know about blow it away.
He joined a course of musician's starving John.
I don't know why that's even a story.
Would you expect Chuck Berry to be a Republican?
I would not.
Well, there you go.
I can't find that damn story about blame Bush.
Oh, here it is right here.
It's in my hand.
That's why I couldn't find it.
Sometimes you're looking forward.
You can't find it because it's in your hand.
Robert Scheer says, blame rising oil prices on Bush.
Wow, a lot of people must have bought Hummers last week.
How else to explain the spike in oil prices?
I've got a brief one.
Can I read this?
No, I'm not being silly.
They are, and by they, they, I mean the gaggle of media pun,
it's another administration apologist, embedded by some green zealots
who want to explain our energy crisis by reference to propagate consumers.
Sure, in the long run, we consumers, especially the most wasteful ones
who have put a reside in the rural USA, and who become a customer
to consuming many times our populations' worth of the world resources,
do need to shape up.
But that has little to do with the five-fold rise in the price of oil
since George Bush became our president.
The AP did it.
Bush's deliberate roiling of rural politics is the key variable
in the run-up of oil prices.
No president's been more brilliant in destabilizing the politics of oil producing countries
from Venezuela to Russia and onto the key oil lakes of Iraq and Iran.
The last will go down, and the history of our nation
is one of the dumbest excavators ever rivaling even the madness of the Vietnam War.
But this time the neocons bet their smart money on oil
as the decisive missing ingredient for success.
Vietnam was always absurd on its faces the imperial adventure because
as American consumers who check their labels must know,
the Vietnamese dominate the market only in the provision of farmed shrimp.
I won't bother here to dignify the canard that Vietnam,
any more than Iraq, ever represented a serious threat to U.S. security
to our McCain sacrifice in the former warnaz,
apologetics for the current one outwithstanding.
After the most ignominious defeat in American history,
Communist Vietnam did not have to be fought on the shores of San Diego
as the hawks at that time predicted,
but rather went to war with Communist China,
the country that had occupied Vietnam for thousands of years.
The Vietnamese later made their peace and outcompete successfully
in the capitalist market without controlling anybody else's resources.
Something similarly unexpected is likely to occur if we get out of Iraq
and permit the people of that region to make their own history.
Events upon our departure will follow the vagaries of a historical script
centering on religion, ethnicity, and nationalism,
which is the talking heads in the median political circles United Ignoring.
As Iraqi Prime Minister Al Malaki demonstrated the other day
with his third visit to his former safe haven in Iran,
the politics of the region have already been sorted out in ways
unproductive by the Neocons.
When he'd only note the words of advice extended to Malaki by a ran supreme leader,
the Itollical meeny, that the Iraqis must think of a solution to free themselves
from the U.S. military.
Malaki nodded every grateful for an audience with a man
who holds Iraq's destiny as hand thanks to the American overthrow
to Ran's nemesis Sodom Usain, as I said Bush was brilliant.
But to be fair, the administration did finally get something right last week
when defense secretary Robert Gates fired both the civilian
and military chiefs of the Air Force.
It were being punished in part for being in charge of an Air Force defense system
that lost track of a nuclear load, be it loaded B-52,
that flew over the U.S. without anyone in the chain of command
or where it was dangerous cargo.
Then there was also the matter of ballistic missile fuses
that were wrongously shipped to Taiwan.
The Air Force has been especially egregious in exploiting the history
of over 9-11 to commit to hundreds of billions in future spending
for high-tech weapons that make no sense
with the collapse of the Soviet Union.
One issue in the firings was the Air Force's pushing for hundreds more F-22 fighter jets,
a $65 billion program that Gates had concluded was not needed
as there's been no rule for the existing forces in Afghanistan and Iraq wars.
Gates rejected the argument that China or any other nation
was on the way to providing the F-22 with a worthy opponent.
Given a sudden commitment to logic, Gates may not survive long
even in his lame duck administration.
Better get someone in their fast who is content that we taxpayers pay the interest on loans from China
to pay for building up an arsenal of counter-reppings that the Chinese show no sign of building.
He had so many money, yours.
Robert Scheer, he was good enough for the early times.
Nope.
But nevertheless, I love all these people.
I mean, you know, that young guy that called before.
I mean, he was articulate and intelligent and concerned.
But what's the point?
You know, what's the point of beating a dead horse?
Am I right?
Might feel good.
Not for the horse.
That's my death.
Well, I'm looking at that death by a chocolate.
Got to stop eating carbs, man.
Got to stop.
Don't you agree?
I do agree.
When it's out, store them out.
I'm trying to cut them down.
You're what?
Cutting down the carbs.
Whenever I'm on a diet, I'm on a diet.
I'm on a diet.
I gotta get back into the 180's and then the 170's and then 160.
You can do it.
By what?
By will.
George will.
George will.
George is diet.
I got news for it.
He likes that show.
If you watch George step on top of his that show on Sunday,
you will lose weight.
You'll lose your appetite for life.
God is at a bad show.
Let's bring back David Brinkley.
What do you say?
Prop him up.
I knew he was in bad shape when his eyes started getting ready to pop out.
Yeah, yeah, you know how some it's not me yet. Thank God, but some people when they get old their eyelids begin to droop and their eyeballs start like they look like they're gonna pop out
yep like
like that
Where's Chad Huntley when we need a man? Where's Edward R. Morrow?
Where's Robert Trout and his buddy trouser trout?
The Democratic Party as a whole is as spineless and cowardly as
Anyone could ever begin to imagine which is why the Republicans every time they get in there every time they steal another election
They get away with basically whatever they want
Bubba he gets a hammer and he's being impeached okay
For lying about his personal sex life which was nobody's damn business, but nevertheless
Whole country had to be everything had to be held up in limbo because of that crap
While Kenny Star was writing all this damn pornography and
The public said and of course the media they loved it. Oh my god. They just drank it up. They love they sucked it up
I have shouldn't say that
416 votes. What do you think 500 Chris or what? Yeah, mr. I don't like cheesecake

School administrators at Chikam Laga Elementary stated no longer investigation of their own
Superintendent Melody Day says in the school systems 30 year history
They've never had a deal with allegations of this nature and they're waiting on the official word from the sheriff's office before proceeding
How do you like that?
Crafts lawyer Chris Talley tells us his plan adamantly denies the charges

How many Q a M hello? Hey, miss O'Neill. Yes, sir, mr. Collar
I'm wondering if you've heard this rumor going around that the reason that Hillary Clinton only
Suspended her campaign did not quit is because the fact that
Senator Obama isn't legally allowed to be in the race to begin. Oh, are you?
You know something you've been reading national review too much
Well, the truer is not true. No, it's not true. Let me say it again. It is not true. Well, I think you're a damn liar

I know because that that goes from generation that's all those puzzles
And of course they would imply that somehow the rural family has got some kind of talent
Exactly of a brilliant some kind of something besides just being a bunch of funny-dirty old hypocrites
For busy screwing their brains out
In addition to Prince Charles buggering the butler or whoever the hell he's doing or it's the other way around. I'm sorry
That's why he likes wearing them kills
The fourth leader
You idiot
You believe that jerk
Oh, man, man, you seem a little tense. Yeah, I've been snapper the people all day
Maybe it's time of the month. Me too. You know, I've been cranky retaining water and look wearing these white gloves
I know what you mean every 28 days I get this insatiable craving to buy a banjo and a corn cob pipe
Yeah, well then it looks like there's only one thing to do
And was that down mr. Lacka
Oh these two men are suffering from pre-ministral syndrome
Beware the warning signs if your husband ever comes home with a tambourine or a banjo pick and insist on calling you
Mr. Bones hide the shoe polish and call your family doctor immediately
So tell me that mr. Bones yes, sir, mr. Lacka
It's a love that woman. I saw you wear blood now. Oh, there was no woman. There was Martina never to
No, it's not very funny and there is no cure
So when it happens to the man in your life try to understand pre-ministral syndrome
Once they see that totally is we're good. I mean you know what this reminds me of what this is perfect for the
Coaches your will comes around goes around or however that goes
These are what 20 years old
Right the ACNs from the early days at IOD thereabouts. Yes, and you know back in those days
They were like you know like amusing, but not not hysterical fall down funny
You know not what we thought and then we went through the whole cutting edge period where we could play a whole bunch of
Of course we can't play and I was you look back at this and this is perfect for now
These are amusing not hysterical right not dirty. Yeah, not cutting it what they're like oh
Come on
There's lukewarm at best. Yeah, the National one
So what the National one sorry? I have belped right in the middle there
You you don't understand what I'm saying what he said I don't know. Okay, I understand
117 at 560 there is Barack Obama in Wisconsin each year
Seniors in this conference should not vote. That's what the guy said before anybody 65 and older don't vote
Even if you vote for the right candidate don't vote anyway. I mean he just made a whole lot of say it's our time
No, yes, he turned about his unfair play as Peter Marshall would say
Used to be the old parts in South Florida, but you know in his son. He's the early bird. It's our time now get out of here
Oh
I'll never forget that is that's a true story
It's a true story some old bitch
I go in a restaurant with a couple of friends. This is way back in the day
70s mid 70s and
Some old bang is sitting there. I think it was a Chinese restaurant was an early bird
What are you doing here you're not old enough for the early bird this is our time now and
And other dead W. Q. I. Am hello. Hey Neil. How you doing? Okay? Are you gonna be traveling abroad this summer maybe
Tell me I'm a few months back. You were putting this kind of putting a knock on Amsterdam. Yes, what's the deal?
It's not the land of the free anymore. No, they're like
They're getting rid of most of the red light district and they're banning a mushrooms and they're becoming more and more
fascistic
We would which it's gonna be their funeral because tourism is good and drop real bad there too many other neat places to go
As opposed to going there and eating their crappy food. Oh, yeah
Yeah, you don't want to eat a Mickey D's I can do that right here
What about at that pancake place next to the river? Have you read that place is that still there?
Pancake yeah, there's some big old building there the end Frank building where they serve these
Panty pancakes well, I need no pancakes okay. Okay. All right. We'll have a good summer Neil
You're okay twice a week then right? Yes, sir. Okay, because I we don't want to die a slow measurable death with George Kavorkian
Okay, see you there's another one of your fans. I know they're lined it up
That's all right. You better get used to it because George is gonna be on a lot
I'll be here Tuesday and Thursday. I guess I should explain that we might have some new listeners out there. Oh not
That during the summer months starting whenever I feel like it's starting about June 16. It doesn't matter what we do. It's a secret
What do you mean by that nobody on the outside is gonna know? Oh nobody outside?
Well, no anyway, that's right because we don't do any promotion outside. We just keep preaching the choir
So like the costume appearance was great. It was a lot of fun, but you know, those are people who are already listeners
We don't do anything anything to create one
Soledante Uno not one listener new one
So either they find us by accident or they just to don't find us and
And the numbers keep dwindling and dwindling and the audience keeps dying and vanishing and moving away and a whole bunch of
You know
And these people but a beat better go and of course the excuse used to be
We're losing a million dollars a year on the marlins. It was always the marlins was excuse why they didn't do any promotion
Well, we don't have the marlins anymore and we're not losing any money on them
In fact, we're we're siphoning off a few extra bucks not a whole lot
But with that 10 minute phone. He showed we have it 650 every night before the marlin game with Jesse Agler
Who's a good guy, by the way?
I don't think we're doing but nevertheless
It's just a commercial thing is all it is. Oh come on. It's a great show a lot of insight
How much insight can you get into 90 seconds in between eight and a half minutes of spots a lot?
Okay, good
Boy, you're sure turn turn your ass today
He turned his ass and cut a big fat one. I can smell it all the way up here
That wasn't me must have been the damn cheesecake
Wtq a m hello
Wtq a m hello
George the mushrooms please Q a m hello
I'm sure you'd like him. Yes, I was wondering if George gonna be a you are wondering you were wondering
If you're ever gonna croak. That's what we're wondering if you're ever gonna croak
Everybody in town is wondering that
You know, it's amazing how many years has he been like infesting our lives so put it too many
And yet there's not one person who has who apparently has got any idea who that is other than his boyfriend
You know, I mean? I
Mean like when it was what's his name there the Eddie although that was from the phone number wasn't from some business that he's the manager at right
What's his name against Steve Steve something?
And then we put his name on here and the phone number he still didn't care
This is what process is what this is what the deal is when you're when you're dealing with crazy people
They don't care in fact they enjoy it right. It's like the serial killers. It's the same thing
They're doing it because they know that they're gonna get their 15 seconds of fame before they get fried
Everybody Q a m hello
Okay, sir, first couple things I don't want to kill the ratings of hockey cock but congratulations on your new coach
I wonder what you think of him
Wouldn't make a congratulations
But Wilson we got Doug Wilson who I can't stand and we got Cliff Fletcher there because there two
There two stupid and cheap to hire a new GM
So we're stuck with old white-haired Cliff Fletcher again, but anyway, I can't be any worse than I was
I think Wilson might be a good fit for Toronto. I think I'm gonna say because they have no talent
Well, yeah, I think he knows the ropes. I think you might introduce me some well that I know something
He ought to be at the end of one, but anyway go ahead
second thing
I wanted to tell Chris too. They also got the cheeseburgers at the Donald's since the 19th on Sunday also
Now you're talking okay. Thanks. Oh listen and and Chris
emailed me yesterday
Which I forgot to mention and I didn't understand it was about the the anus burgers
Uh-huh, and what were you trying to tell me if they have them in the states? Yes, sir
We have BK BK has an angus style burger
Well, I don't think I don't have well, we're not talking about BK
I understand that McDonald's does not have the angus burgers in the United States
They've test trial them in a couple places only Canada has them in a wide they're great area
So I must have the BK BF burger and that's what I thought I was burger eight yes
Yeah, because we were talking and I said I'd lottery they tasted like ass. Yeah
Who's oh
Ian's
Yeah exactly that's what Sandy Faten said
You
469 on a pool. I think you're gonna make the 500 that that would be a pretty revolutionary
That would give me a little bit of confidence that maybe there's somebody how do we do with a certificate?
It's not too good. That doesn't surprise me because lately. I mean we have two sushi places there
You have a vegetarian what 38 not good see we're still stuck there on 38 we sold 10 right off the bat and then we sold since then too
Not good
Which isn't what's isn't a reflection on the restaurant? I mean you guys are eating and the food is great
Which the other place was the same deal
But it's just that people are afraid of places that they don't know about and the certain types of food
Right, I think well, I think what we ought to do is based on the colors last few days
Get some Mongolian beef, you know some on goalie restaurant honor for Mongolian idiots
We'd have no shortage then
We write up this crowd's alley
Nobody Q a.m. Hello
You low-peasant George again, please please
I'd forgotten all about that
Well George is trying to get into her pants or whatever the deal is I don't know yeah, that's it
I don't know what it is Chris hates her like poison by the way. I do not you had you don't I don't you don't like her whatever
You know see you know you're you're one of these guys you're getting just like you're just trying to start stuff

Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama charged yesterday that US credit card companies are tricking Americans with the accepted practices and the Republican John McCain has done nothing to stop it
Obama on a two week tour focusing on problems in the US economy held a roundtable discussion with three people who have seen their credit card debt
Skyrocket due to relentless cycle of interest rate increases and fees
For too long credit card companies have been using unfair and deceptive practices to trick Americans in assigning agreements
They can't afford a bomb a set
Americans have enough session with credit cards often using plastic in place of cash. They're spastic over plastic
And I'm encouraged by the credit card companies to use them to buy not just big ticket items, but on every day I was like gas and groceries
See it says not just big ticket items now gas is a big ticket item. Yes. Yeah
As a consequence many people owe thousands of dollars in credit card then are only able to make the minimum monthly payment
The balance in place for a long time there are some fears that the credit card debt could mushroom into a crisis in much the same way that subprime orgises have afflicted the US economy
Companies held up for scoring at the event included Bank of America Washington mutual and GE Pearl money a credit card issued through the eyeglass vendor pearl vision
Obama said the laws and regulations governing credit card companies have been lax and that the companies have paid millions of dollars to create favor of members of Congress to get laws written to their liking
I think everybody out there who we said Mickey D's you had to go to see the manager next time to go to your local

Who yet? Yeah
Why are they holding it back from America is it's like anti-American or something? What's that all about?
You've gotta talk before how sometimes they'll have a special T item one of those places and they discontinue it right when you're
Yeah, it's like that Arby's used to do it all the time really cross my ass. I hate when they do that

We pulled up to the drive-through there and you know I hadn't been to hardies in the years

Got back on a Hershey highway, but they had it
And it was de freaking delicious and it was just out there. That's right. I was really good
