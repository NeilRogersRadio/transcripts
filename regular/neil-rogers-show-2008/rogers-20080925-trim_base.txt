Not over your last business.
You pervert.
I have a pipeline.
Down south, you need to inspect LMAO.
Ah!
Go away!
I have hacked your cell phone number two, calling you now.
What?
Mara Puma.
Oh, my.
Hello?
Hey, you hot little hockey mob.
Your number one on my political poll if you know what I made.
Oh, that was it?
Wow.
Well, I was just looking at some emails here including one old clay aching comes out of the closet.
Oh, God.
It's just, you know.
I realize people can't listen every day every minute, but why not?
You know?
Becky, we had that there was the first thing I talked about yesterday.
Oh, my.
Jesus, God Almighty.
Anyhow, here's a really good email.
Did they have Drew Rosenstein crant's house on again?
Boy, everybody hates him.
And Alex Marvez?
Oh, this station.
You know something?
I'm going to hire a guy who's going to come and take it.
I don't want to do any violence to clearance.
Well, I really would like to.
But just kidnap him for a year and watch those numbers go zooming back up.
We could have Gilbert be the PD for a year.
Who better than we're tonight.
I'm serious.
Well, Gilbert's a big fan of this kind of show.
So you're right.
At least Gilbert knows something about the show.
Well, let's see, before I get to Larry, Larry Good-Jewishboy, his email,
here's one from Mia, because they're still showing them.
Let the bailout fit.
McCain, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
See now, I'm telling you the good news is that the Republicans have,
they've stolen that guaranteed lose page from the Democratic playbook.
I mean, they are committing political suicide.
That was up 160 points, by the way, for those who care.
Here comes the money and there goes your money.
Mia, recent college graduate says, hi, I'm very disturbed.
Oh, no.
Recent college graduate, it says I'm very distributed, not disturbed.
She meant disturbed, but it says I'm very distributed.
The former president Clinton, the proclaimed Democratic Obama supporter
who reports his Clinton and Global Initiative is bipartisan forum
for discussing improving global issues around the world with law and McCain
to give a partisan Republican speech, which he just got through giving, by the way.
Clinton should have made it very clear and read the speech ahead of time
to ensure his speech focused on the spirit of his organization
and wasn't a speech to promote the Republican agenda.
The question, this question's Clinton's true support for Barack Obama and the Democrats.
Why in the hell would he allow such a thing?
Would Clinton rather compromise the most important presidential election
in the past 50 years over his own personal endeavors?
Uh-huh.
The icing on the cake is Clinton provided courtesy videotape
to the media of McCain's partisan rhetoric.
What the hell was he thinking?
Please heal my wounds, I'm hurt by this warm and kindest regards, Mia.
Recent college graduate who says she's distributed, that has happened.
Not disturbed, she's distributed in capital letters.
So, Rita, I'm very distributed.
Retestribute her.
Quit being sarcastic, okay? She's serial.
Oh.
Now Larry says the economy is going to hell.
People are talking about another depression.
We have a so-called war hero, Wacadu, flinching in the face of something he can't handle.
Even canceling an appearance last minute on the Letterman show
is if those ten minutes would have had an impact on what's happening in Congress.
Letterman, by the way, ripped him an ass, it was great.
Good.
For like ten minutes, and had Overnment on there instead.
He was the replacement gags on choice.
And then coming to find out that McCain lied.
I mean, this is what I'm talking about.
This blatant, bald-faced lies.
Oh, he's got a hurry back to Washington to work on the bailout scheme.
And the fact of the matter is he wasn't in Washington at all.
He was still in New York over doing an interview with Katie Kirk.
Lire.
Lire and liar.
Which is the biggest liar?
Sarah or, of course, Sarah don't like because she don't speak.
They won't let her speak now.
They've got her encased in a glass bubble.
They're a Sarah with Henry Kissinger.
And they're a Sarah doing Kuchi Kuchi with the Hamid Karzai.
Oh, I say Kuchi? I'm sorry.
Anyway, even canceling an appearance at the last minute on the Letterman show.
Canceling debates.
We have a witch-fearing moose.
Oh, did you see the preacher?
Oh, yeah.
Whoa.
Been there done that.
Wow.
Been there done that.
Oh, sure.
That kind of preacher.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What a voice on that kind of.
A witch-fearing moose eating nut job is possible VP or gas present.
We have an ongoing war that's sucking up much needed money from our trouble economy.
Yeah, we could use that trillion dollars, I guess.
We have Galveston destroyed.
And nobody paying attention showing, again, the ineptitude of the Bush East handle anything that doesn't involve putting more money in the country.
We have rich people's pockets.
We have babies dying in China from bad milk.
We have a mother buying her son a salt rifle so we can more effectively threaten fellow students' lives.
We have offshore oil drilling improvement in Congress.
We have a father sending his son to school with a t-shirt saying that Obama's a friend of terrorists.
But that's okay. I can handle it because all is right in the world.
Why?
And here comes the best part of this email.
Okay.
Why?
Because both the dolphins and the hurricanes won this past weekend.
Aren't we blessed?
At a boy, Larry.
A bad.
Excellent email.
And your close personal friend, Flea, who's just psychotic.
Not only is he look weird, he just is weird, you know.
I sure hope he's in that meeting right now going to bat for us on these screwed up rejoins.
You know that there are people, there are little children in South Florida running around asking,
what those rejoins, what those rejoins.
Little children who understand the formatics of this business better than our so-called program director
underlining the so-called being the operative words.
So-called Schmidthead, idiot, Simpleton.
I guarantee you that we got spies in that building.
We've got people on the payroll across the street.
We've got to have.
Because what they're doing to us in this radio station is criminal.
There are people on death row for far lesser crimes than what they're doing at WQIM.
End this show in particular, but not just singularly.
You got me?
I got you.
So Flea says, and Flea is just whipped up.
He emailed me this to the anneal at neorodges.com.
Also to my own Yahoo email.
He just all over the place that Flea.
You know what you do with a Flea?
That's it.
Governor Charlie Christ passed this into law yesterday and I quote,
first of all, the governor doesn't pass anything of the law, but he pushed it.
He pushed it.
If your driver's license address does not match the address on your VOTE's registration card,
you will not be permitted to vote.
And here's the best part of this from Flea.
Please forward this to everyone in Florida to check today both addresses on their driver's license and voter registration to make sure they match.
And then it's got a link to change your address online.
Please forward this to everyone in Florida.
Well, I'll see you guys, because I'm going to be busy for days.
In fact, even by election day, I might not be able to give this to everybody in Florida.
Please forward this to everyone in Florida to check both addresses on your driver's license and voter registration card.
If they don't match, you ain't going to vote.
It's got a link.
I'm from Flea, from your friend Flea.
I thought he was a coherent guy.
Yeah.
I think he's becoming a crazy person.
That could be.
And he doesn't have to get all bent out of shape because the Republicans are doing everything but forfeiting right now.
This all this crap about, oh, we got a cancel or a postpone to debate.
Well, there's such a short window that is like what, five and a half weeks before the election now.
Such a short window for the three debates.
That the obvious tactic here is what they've been doing all along and that is to shut her up and not give her the opportunity to open up her mouth and show the show her ass to the world.
Which a lot of you guys probably want to see that and I guarantee it's at this point, probably a wrinkly nasty ass, but nevertheless.
That that's the whole game plan.
Oh, we got to get rid of that vice presidential debate because the idea that she's going to be up there.
And even though they're not going to be able to interact with each other in that debate, which the Democrats should never have agreed with that.
Even though they're not going to be able to do that, she is going to lay an egg the size of mercury.
The size of Mars, the size of Uranus.
I can't wait for that debate. I'm going to be I would pay to watch that.
That's how enthusiastic I'm about this.
Oh, no, we can't we got a cancel that we got because we got that crisis.
Oh boy.
I mean one thing to lie.
It's another thing to do it so blatantly and so poorly.
So this is the worst run campaign in history.
Even Michael do Kaka with a picture of him in the tank with a helmet on.
Even that was better than what they're doing.
So maybe Bubba's trying to help old Johnny boy out.
You think maybe because I'm very distributed by it.
Now here's a story.
You're a bastard.
What? Although it is funny.
Well, she points out that she's a college graduate at the end of the email.
We didn't think your college graduate would know how to write the most.
No, no, not if that college is UM.
Oh God forbid. I said college.
Not football school, not suntan you.
You can't spell scum without UM.
Anyway, here's a short but sweet who sent me this.
Trying to think who sent this to me.
Oh Josh Cordis sent this to me.
I'm sitting at Woodbine which I had another marginal winning day.
Not humongous books but enough to make it worth going.
And I get a text message from Josh Cordis.
Oh, here's a really cute story I found.
Maybe you want me to put this on the site.
Second around for that grand okay which I still haven't mailed out yet by the way I'm thinking about.
What do you think, Chris?
Should I send the money or not?
Uh, two for that really little care.
Good. I like that. That's an excellent answer.
What do you think George?
Yeah, well whatever.
See whatever which means F you Josh.
South Charleston West Virginia as if getting a DUI wasn't enough.
A man arrested for driving under the influence gotten a lot more trouble at the police station.
It's got a picture of this guy looks like a marginal guy.
I mean, marginal human.
Police stopped Jose Cruz on Route 60 in South Charleston Monday night for driving with his headlights off.
Then he failed sobriety test and was arrested.
When police were trying to get fingerprints police say Cruz moved closer to the officer and passed gas on him.
The investigating officer remarked in the criminal complaint that the odor was very strong.
Cruz is now charged with battery on a police officer as well as DUI and obstruction.
How do you like that?
If you fart on a cup it's a battery.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay.
Maybe he hooked up a battery to his ass to like you know kind of ratchet that thing up a little bit.
What do you think?
Maybe.
Glenn Beck rhymes with direct promoting that thing.
What a disgrace.
Don't we have enough Nazis on the year already for crying out loud?
No.

Hockey mom lover.

I wonder if she's very distributed by this.
In a world exclusive, the National Inquirer names, GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin secret lover.
No less than three members of the man's family, including one by sworn affidavit, have claimed that Sarah Palin engaged in an extramarital affair with husband Todd's former business partner, Brad Hansen.
I wonder if he was one of the Hansen brothers.
Then one of them died.
Yeah, I believe so.
Wow.
What are we going to do now?
Nothing.
These sources have named Hansen as Palin's secret lover and say they refer nearly wrecked both their marriages.
Hansen owned a snowmobile dealership with Palin's husband Todd, who immediately dissolved the partnership after he heard stories about the affair which occurred in 1996,
according to sources at the time, Palin was mayor of Wasilla.
Palin is vehemently denied cheating on her husband and Hansen insisted on the National Inquirer that he was never romantically involved with the 44 year old VP candidate.
However, Hansen family insider Jim Burdett has gone on the record and passed a rigorous polygraph test revealing details of the affair of the National Inquirer in a World Exclusive interview details.
He probably even drew some pictures of who had what and who stuck what where and how many times they put it in there.
And out and in and out.
Burdett is a former brother-in-law of Hansen's estranged wife, Carolyn's brother Craig Batten, and still speaks with many family members.
I've known about Brad having had an affair for a long time. It wasn't just he'll recently. I learned his affair was with Sarah Palin, Burdett told the Inquirer.
Sarah was elected mayor of Wasilla. Brad became a city council member nearby town of Palmer and they started an affair. They were screwin and doin' and chewing and bluin'.
Todd found out about the affair with so many broke up the partnership at the snowmobile dealership, Burdett says.
Another source who preferred to reign anonymous for a fair of repercussions provided the Inquirer with a sworn affidavit attesting to the Palin Hansen story.
Todd was away on business a lot and Sarah felt lonely. Oh poor hockey mom.
Brad was a good listener and Sarah talked to him at length. Eventually she realized she was falling in love with him and she probably dropped her panties.
When Todd got back from one of his trips, Sarah told him she'd begun to have feelings for Brad.
For the full story and exclusive details of the shocking allegations of Sarah Palin's affair pick up the latest issue of the National Inquirer, which you can be damn sure I will do today.
Oh isn't this gonna be great? It's all just blown up in their face. I just love it. I love it.
The cards. I just win. I just can't find my diamonds. I guess they are.

Two Sebastian River Middle School eighth graders have been charged with lured and liviest molestation for attempted sexual battery on a child in connection with an incident on a school bus while the school soccer team returned home from a game.
Rodolfo Rodriguez, 14 and Jose Zamora, 15. No relation to George Rodriguez or Ronnie Zamora.
Both of Felsmeer, boy, they're saying, vasemeer and Felsmeer were arrested at their home September 17.
Scripts, treasure, coast newspapers while customarily not naming juveniles accused of crimes.
Does name some juveniles, depending on the seriousness of the crime, their age, aggravating circumstances and other factors.
The two eighth graders attempted to insert an apple pie box in a sixth grade teammates rectum.
Reckum, while others tried taking photos with cellular phones according to an incident report released Tuesday.
No, that the box have a pie in it or was it not? Well, we'll get to it.
This is important. No, maybe it's like Tom Thumb. He pulled out his thumb and six greater troll deputies, Rod Rodriguez and Zamora first tried to put a box in another sixth graders bottom over his clothing, but did not insert it.
It's kind of hard when they got their clothes on.
The two students then turned another sixth grader around the back seat and pulled his pants and boxers down.
One student held the sixth graders face against the winner of the bus while the box was placed in his rectum.
Recorded the report. Reckum. The reports said the sixth grader was able to pull his boxers up with the students then dragged him into the aisle of the bus and held his pants down.
Other teammates tried to take pictures with their cell phones according to the report.
After the two students let go, the sixth grader grabbed the box and pulled it out of his ass.
That says pulled it out of himself, but ass is so much more colorful.
Sure. He told deputies he threw the box and Zamora heading him in the shoulder. Zamora threw it in the box back hitting the student in the right eye.
Students stated then started crying and vomited on the bus while he was vomiting. Zamora said to him, you're not going to tell, right?
After school and district officials heard about the incident, the school's principal, Eileen Shirah, cancel the rest of the soccer team season.
Good. Little nasty punks. Two adult employees on the bus at the time of the incident have been suspended with pay, pending the outcome of a district investigation.
The sixth grader told deputies he yelled at Rodriguez and Zamora to stop.
However, everybody in the school bus was so loud that the coaches were sitting in the front of the school bus couldn't hear him.
The coaches were probably eggie, Mcmuffin him on.
Oh, yeah. What do you think so? Those coaches, yeah.
Egg Mcmuffin and he teachers, we know about them.
I'm pretty distributed about that.

Attention, ladies. I asked you all here today to judge our finalists for the 790 WQAM auditions.
Will our three finalists come out of the closet, please?
Audition finalists number one.
What is your name and what do you really do?
I am proud. My name is the fabulous sportsman.
And I do a show that amounts to nut.
And I do it very badly.
I got what you call a face for radio.
And I don't fall on there either.
Which is perfect for the way you're on the station you've got to see.

Well, I really liked what a great voice I have when I sang in the shower.
My mom will have told me so.
Ladies, we have a winner.
Okay, everybody, all together now.
Sports is the only thing that matters.
It's a 1032 or 560 W.
I finally decided.
I've been debating it for all the years we've been on this radio station.
I finally decided that sports talk is the most ponderous, the most monotonous,
the most boring and swill in the history of radio.
Oh, come on now.
It's important.
Or television.
Just rehashing.
Oh, and then that email I got yesterday about, well, I bet it reached 90% of the mail audience
in your audience's sports intensive.
So you got to mix them in.
Remember that email?
Sure.
Mix them in.
Yeah, mix this.
Okay, go on a date with Tom Mix.
Okay, he's got a nice pistola.
Maybe you'll blow your brains out if you can find him.
Mix them in.
20 hours a day of the same swill isn't enough.
Oh, well, the fish does and the fish doesn't.
Sounds all fishy to me.
God.
And the same.
You know what it's like?
It's like the same thing with the news channel.
Right.
And this crap about Rachel Maddo and all this.
All she's doing is recycling some of the same talking heads that Obermann's been having on offer a year.
Same people.
And he as much as I like him, he has these same ones on over and over Eugene Robinson.
And then the guy with the real razor thin face that was on again last night.
The same people in around for like two minutes.
And thank you so much and wonderful to have you.
Oh, thank you, Keith.
You know, it's Jesus drew Rosenstein and her Kirch's jerk street and oh my God.
All these experts mouthing off of swill about garbage.

Last night after I had a decent afternoon at Woodbine, I went upstairs to the cafeteria.
The cafeteria center because Wednesday night they have thorough bread racing.
They serve all the good stuff.
When they don't have thorough bread racing, they're no burgers.
They're just like weenies and pizza and stuff.
Macaroni and cheese.
So I got me a cheeseburger which they make very good cheeseburgers at Woodbine.
And they put a big thing of lettuce on it.
I mean like a whole head.
And I just took it and I threw it away.
And the burger was great.
I had onions on it, you know, and stuff.
I took the lettuce off.
Not because it's good for it because it just gets in the way.
You know what I mean by that?
Yep.
It gets in the way.
A big thing like a handful of lettuce.
Take the lettuce and stick it in there with the apple pie.
Let us four, salsa four, peppers three, relic three, and honey mustard had none.
I don't know where the hell that came from honey mustard.
Honey mustard is great on salads.
You know who had a great honey mustard dressing?
Houston's.
Oh god, do I love Houston's for their soups and their shallots?
Oh, they had the best honey mustard.
But whoever heard of putting honey mustard on a burger, nobody ever done it because it didn't get any votes.
Maybe somebody a vote for it before we change the poll.
Now what's your take on change in the poll?
We're doing what about nephatism for tomorrow?
Yeah.
We want to change it this early?
Chris?
Sure, why not?
We do?
Yeah.
You don't want to wait till we get 1100 votes.
We got a 1072.
Let's be a maverick.
Oh, let's see.
David says, according to IMDB, all three actor hockey players, the Hansen brothers are still alive.
No, I wasn't talking about those Hansen's New York City Dave.
I was talking about the Make Believe Singers, those retards.
Even George knew that, right?
What is this?
What?
Oh, it's about the Apple Pions.
Oh.
No, I'm changing the poll.
1072 is more than enough.
I mean, what difference does it make if we get to 1100?
What do we get a gold star in a purple jelly bean?
Yeah.
Who is the best example of nepotism?
Here's what we have so far.
And you can email some more choices to neolatneilrodgers.com.
Or you can just shot them out the window.
We'll hear it.
Sophia Coppola, Torey Spelling, Joaquin Phoenix, Chad Lowe, Robert Downey, Jr.,
Kiefer Sutherland, George W. Bush, Nicholas Cage, Ashley Simpson, or Luke Russell.
Obviously, everybody's going to vote for George W. Bush, so why should I vote for anybody else?
Right?
Yeah, he's got both votes so far.
Did you vote?
Not yet.
Oh, he's got the first two votes, including mine.
W.
That was up 186th and Aztec's up 33th.
And the S&P is up 19.
Oh, a happy day.
We're starting with the money and there goes your money.
Hansen, 1998.
Flarse, four, two, Hansen, the year 2000.
You want fries with that?
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, street ticket.
Okay, so somebody named John says our streaming is sputtering.
I don't believe it.
Okay.
If our streaming was sputtering, I'd have heard it from Brandon.
We'd be getting lots of emails about it.
Am I right?
Our streaming is, according to that one guy, it's just sensational.
That's right.
It's the world of fire.
It is high-fi and Wi-Fi and whatever it is.
Flying your hat.
Well, there's always people who want to throw a apple pie in the mix.
You know, always wraps with the flying.
And I.
And five.
I really like pie.
I like, I'm telling you, I like banana cream pie and chocolate cream pie.
I like chocolate cream pie.
You don't like key lime pie?
I love key lime pie.
Okay.
I like a small slice.
I like a can pie, but a very small slice.
Oh, began, that's really sweet.
Mm-hmm.
Like a small slice, dizzy.
About the size of your ass.
Doug says no burgers complete without the meat.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Great, Joni.
You listen to the, to sports all they long, almost.
So your show is one that brings me to reality with humor.
Thank you very much.
I listen to sport all they long, almost.
Get some help, Doug.
Fat man after dark says, please, Ed, I got two more for the poll.
Jamie Spears.
Got it.
Got it.
And Jeremy Shapp.
He's the son of the late Dick Shapp.
Dick Shapp was going to like get his thumb fixture, some kind of a cosmetic surgery thing.
And he, during the operation, he croaked.
Dick Shapp.
He said he had the son of legendary sportscaster Dick Shapp.
I wouldn't say that Dick Shapp was legendary.
Okay, talk about getting carried away.
Fat man.
But Jeremy Shapp is the guy that they used to make fun of.
And they used to have on the phone.
And some guy didn't impersonate him on the, on the worst team.
Don't you remember that with me, foe?
Mm-hmm.
That was one of their characters was Jeremy Shapp.
I don't know if it was the real one or the fake one.
And don't really care.
Because it's all boring as crap.
But I listen to sport all day long.
And it is just shocking to me that there are people out there.
And there aren't that many of them anymore.
I'm not that sure that they ever were, you know.
Want to hear about the game and dissect it and rehash it and revisit it and give meaningless opinions.
I mean, opinions are like a-holes, you know, everybody's got one.
Who cares?
It's one thing to have an opinion about politics or something meaningful.
That was up almost 200 points.
And then to the sport.
And that's why the third commitment I'll make is working to erase the global primary education gap by 2015.
Every child, every boy and every girl should have the ability to go to school.
To ensure that our nation does its part to meet this goal.
And I think every boy and every girl on the school bus ought to have their own apple pie, don't you?
That's right.
And Brandon has got a good point here. He says, what about shoe fly pie?
An apple pie?
Sure.
Remember we looked that up one time. I don't want to do it again.
Shoes fly pie and apple, panda. What's that song?
That's old.
That's it.
Shoes fly pie.
But who does that?
Who doors day, I think?
Doris day does shoe fly pie?
Oh my God.
Looking for it.
I wonder if Rock Hudson knew about that.
That Doris day had a new one.
I'm sorry, Donna Shore, I misspoke.
I was nine with Shore, now we're talking.
Fanny Roachor, who was Jewish.
And put on that red Nekia actor, Merpina.
See the USA in your shed, remember?
And Jewish.
That's for her title, by the way.
Nice talk, girl.
Thank you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, that's one for that.
I'll say.
I saw that show when she was on.
This is your life with Ralph Edwards.
And her real name was Fanny Roachor.
And she was Jewish.
But she was from the South, and she had that whole red Nekia who draw, you know, the Fanny.
And she was just Mordecai, I mean, Mordephied.
Yeah, what was your favorite?
Dinosaur song.
See the USA, you won't have that because it's a commercial.
Open, well, it's an open, it will show.
Well, this is mine.
That was up to 110 points.
I don't know what that is.
Sure you do.
Oh, I don't.
I'd love to do.
Salah, good, do lament, a boule of biblity, biblity, boo.
Yeah, okay.
Put them together and what have you got?
Squad.
Here's the new poll.
Who is the best example of nepotism?
We got 36 votes on the new poll.
Chris is really geared up for this one.
That was up to...
Here's the new poll.
Who is the best example of nepotism?
We got 36 votes on the new poll.
Chris is really geared up for this one.
That was up to 107 trins on dialogue, you know, catch up.
Brook Hogan.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks Brandon.
I want to change my vote.
Brook Hogan.
I don't even know who that is.
I know Hogan.
You're lucky.
I know John Hogan.
My friend Derek's least favorite driver.
Let's do a harness racing poll on the email thing.
Okay.
You don't think that would be to do a separate poll on the email?
Yeah?
Oh!
What?
We just had a power outage.
Are we still on the air?
Let's find out.
I'm not going to...
Listen, I get paid by the word.
I know.
So I'm not talking for free until I play, you know, Doris Day.
Give me a...
Scratchy.
Boy, that was scratchy.
Remember those days when we had the scratchy records?
Sure.
So, you know the most heartbreaking things as a kid when you'd like...
Accidentally, putting not the needle across the record.
Oh, yeah.
Big gouge in it.
Like tick, tick, tick, you know, like that.
Uh-huh.
Tick, tick.
It had like a nervous tick.
So are we on the air or what?
Chris hasn't made it back yet.
I presume I think it was just something in here.
Just an internal situation?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe it's because that guy has sent that caustic thing about our...
our streaming is sputtering.
No, you chiefscape.
Why don't you go steal some money and get you a good...
connection for Kranowlow.
Dial up my ass.
Who else would...
What's the number?
B-2579.
Yeah, we're good.
As McCain suspends campaigning,
aid accidentally emails bailout talking points to the media.
Oh, my God.
As of Tuesday, McCain hadn't even read the bailout proposal.
The one that he's allegedly...
Oh, if they don't come up with a solution by Friday,
I'm bailing on the debate.
We're suspending our campaign.
They might as well just call off their campaign.
They don't have a campaign.
Senator McCain's campaign accidentally emailed a list of talking points to several media outlets.
Yesterday, amidst his announcement,
that he was suspending his campaign to focus on ongoing wall street bailout discussions,
even though as of Tuesday, he hadn't read the bailout proposal.
I'm calling on the president to convene with the meeting with the leadership from both houses of Congress,
including Senator Robon and myself.
He said, it's time for both parties to come together to solve this problem.
According to McCain's senior advisor, Mark Salter,
the campaign will suspend all ads and campaign events.
In addition, to trying to postpone the debate tomorrow night with Senator Obama,
who said, no way Jose.
And the debate commission said, no way Jose.
Everybody else says no way.
I think it'll be funny if just Obama showed up alone.
That's right.
As of Tuesday afternoon, McCain hadn't even read the wall street bailout proposal,
not being reviewed by Congress.
I haven't had a chance to see it writing.
He told WKYC's Tom Burris, I have to examine it.
Somebody ought to examine you to see if you're still alive.
You're ridiculous old coot.
The campaign talking points, a copy of which appears via a political CEO,
focus on bipartisanship with aims to push bailout legislation through by Monday.
It's time for both parties to come together to solve this problem on talking point reads.
This is the time to put our country first.
We must meet as Americans, not as Democrats or Republicans,
and we must meet until this crisis is resolved.
And until we get all of that taxpayer money in the hands of the right parties.
Good. Got all my...
Oh, we can't let Sarah debate.
Oh my god, we can't let her out.
They talk about Clay Aiken coming out.
You know, the space that he left open in the closet, she's in there now.
Oh, and the stream went down when you had that coin of brand and the stream went down.
Oh boy, now we got a whole bunch of emails.
Which I'll get to during the break.
I'm not going to try to read these.
You know what I'm thinking I might do?
What?
Do I have enough room?
No, I don't have enough...
I could move some stuff around a little bit.
But I don't want to.
Because then I'll mess the cords all up.
I'm thinking of like moving the monitor to a different spot,
like right in front of me there.
Okay.
As opposed to off to the side.
Okay.
Now let me just try something.
Because these voomikes, you know, they got long reach.
Like that.
Oh, Betty Smith months to saw me some Niagara.
Blow it out your ass, Betty.
Get some apple pies.
Let's see, add to the poll, John McCain.
Naval Officer John McCain.
Now, burger poll.
Speaking of burgers, Vibri, in a restaurant called Red Robin?
No.
I keep seeing their commercials as supposedly a gourmet burger place.
I went to their website.
They have only one location in Fortinson Ford Myers.
Many of you looks encouraging yummy
and different than other burger joints.
Is it worth the trip from Fort Lauderdale?
How the hell do I know?
Love the new formats.
Stop the A-holes from sabotaging your time.
Deb.
Here my friend.
Oh, Kenny Gramer says this streaming's okay.
Thanks, Kenny.
Chronic.
Your stream is fine.
Tell the guy to get a new computer in life says Bill.
Thanks, Bill.
Is this supposed to be best example or worst as Rick?
The best example?
You know what?
God.
Do I have to explain it to him?
Yeah, let's talk.
Where's the classic example?
The best example of nepotism.
You understand what it means, Schmuck?
I think McCain is a wussy to run away from the debates as Frank.
Neal, I prefer to listen to sports.
Joe Rose, Vigo, Man, which all day long,
while I'm working and listen to Rush Limbaugh.
Oh, that's, I guess that's the only choice.
I like to say opinions are like A-holes.
Everybody's got one of the all stink.
Says Jonathan and Boka.
Bring out your Joe so we can throw him in a pond.
What?
I don't know.
Bring out your Joe so we can throw him in a pond.
You know what they said?
Nobody wants another Joe.
That's what the guy with the glasses said in Godfather 3.
Nobody wants another Joe.
You're still on the years.
He's like, okay, yeah, we know Larry.
I was listening online and craped out, so it's Frankie.
And streaming.
You craped out twice about one minute before Georgia and out
it's on the earth.
It's okay now, but thought you'd like to know,
it's Andrew.
We craped out on the streaming.
It was sputtering.
You're sputtering.
You're struggling and you're sputtering.
And you know what?
Who cares?
So what's the story with Flea in that meeting they had?
Are we going to get some real good stuff?
They're still in that.
They're still holding that meat?
Yes, start a little after 10.
Oh my God, are you shmitting me?
All they do all day long is sit around and have meetings
and talk about crap that most of them have no idea what they're talking about.
You're especially clever.
You're a bio-radio.
Sport radio 560 QAM.
The fourth leader.
The biggest names of best calories.
You're listening to sports radio 560.
WQAM.
My Miami Ford Lauderdale.
This is the Neo Rodge-er show.
Rock solidis is your brain.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Any questions?
Hello!
I'm John McKayne.
You may have heard that I invented the Blackberry.
Well, my friends, it's true!
And I'm going to tell you how I did it.
My tribe and I were camping in the Heroes of Kentucky,
but we didn't call it that back then.
Anyway, I was messing around and I crossed a blueberry with a poison berry and the next thing you know I got a blackberry
What's that it's coming from this little box?
John it's Sarah P.E.L.N.
Sarah, how did you get into this funny little box my friend?
John it's a blackberry. It's a phone. Oh
really but that's okay. It's time for your now just let Sarah take care of this just like I'll take care of everything when we're in the White House.
Okay, do
I'm governor Sarah P.E.L.N. and I approved this message. I'll approve anything that kicks me in the White House with this ancient geezer.
Oh God I can't wait for the Biden pale and debate it's gonna be it's gonna make everything else pale and even if it ever happens.
Well of course we got a cancel it because you know there's a lot of emergency going on and I'm sure it'll generate some more.
If you had emergencies I may have to do a wild choice here in Montmelville. Really?
Yeah, well I'll play some tunes.
You mean play some tunes? I'll spin some wax.
Donna sure see the USA in your Chevrolet. I'll take requests. See one thing about the early days of television in the 50s.
There were a lot of people who just happened to be in the right place at the right time because television was in its infancy.
You know what I mean? Yep. So it's not that they were like great talents or very entertaining or or great comedians or great singers.
It's just that they happen to be in the right place at the right time.
That's what life is pretty much it's like it's like going to the casino. It's like playing the schlats.
Oh and where's the where's the thing from the guy who says he misses the quarter schlock guy? I got to find this.
Oh boy. I'll find it. I got a hole. I got a pile. Oh here it is.
I'm also for the poll Michael Powell. FCC chairman the anxious Michael Powell son of a real a hole.
If ever there was one just like his father by the way sell out hold up that file again so the world can see that was a
vile act colon total sell out. He might vote for Obama though he said. Antonio says,
Hey last night my wife was listening to Joyce Myers. Her words are beautiful and comforting.
Who is Joyce Myers never heard of her? The problem is that I have unfortunately we don't live by the way God directs us,
but what is convenient to man at the appropriate moment. I do believe in the almighty but why is it that it never turns out the way God wants us to conduct ourselves.
Now I know that you do not believe in God but I do. I only believe in.
Damn God. Why do you think humanity is turned against him? I think it all started when prayer was taken out of the school curriculum.
Yeah that must be it. I must be that dead bitch. Madeline Oh here. That must be it.
PS George I enjoy your interaction with your audience can't wait Neil to get sick to to hear your show exchanging thoughts and ideas with your audience in your business.
That's the way I believe it should be. PS missed the quarter Schlatz guy Tony West Kendall. I mean talk about.
Yeah. He wants to hear your thoughts and interactions with the audience. That's the way it should be. Take your calls and shove them right in there with a quarter of a slot.
Okay Tony. Yeah. Mr. Quarter Schlatz guy. Idiot. Anybody who misses those calls needs needs to be exterminated immediately.
Not sooner. Including many of those who were the callers. By the way speaking of red Robin location in Fort Myers close a few years ago says somebody and it says it sucked anyway.
Well I thought the guy said he keeps seeing commercials for it. Oh maybe nationally must be a national shame. Must be you get it. I get it. Here's a joke.
Do you dare me do you double arm brace myself I double dare to read this on the air Rogers. Now this is from one of our good emailers Ralph emails are pouring in today by the way.
And you were giving me yesterday. Oh I think this is all done two weeks. I miss your interaction with the callers. And your friend.
Controversial program. Oh. He wishes somebody's whistling in a hallway. A tune. What's what's that thing about whistling past the graveyard.
I don't know. Yeah. I'm sure it's a superstitious kind of wishling past the graveyard. Ralph says the mother was working in the kitchen listening to her five year old son playing with his new electric train in the living room.
She heard the train stop under sun saying all of your sons of bitches who want get the hell off now because this is the last stop.
And all your sons of bitches who are getting on get your asses on the train because we're going down the tracks.
The horrified mother went in and told her son we don't use that kind of language in this house. I want you to go to your room and you're to stay there for two hours when you come out you may play with your train but I want you to use nice language.
Two hours later the boy came out of the bedroom resume playing with his train soon the train stopped in the mother heard her son say all passengers please remember your things.
Thank you and hope your trip was a pleasant one we hope you'll ride with us again soon. She heard her little darling continue for those of you just boarding remember there's no smoking in the train.
We hope you'll have a pleasant relaxing journey with us today as the mother began to smile the child added for those of you who are pissed off about the two hour delay please see the bitch in the kitchen.
Excellent. That was good. See and you don't want me to do jokes. I said proofread the nuts off. Come on and it takes the fun out of it. Oh, sure that's one way of putting it.
Oh, there's just a whole bunch of stuff. Palin protected from witchcraft we saw that guy that guy is scary.
Ooh, I think Tang while I'm being banged. Let's find the witch doctor by David Seville you got it coming right up on Liberty Records.
David Seville and patients and prudence they were on Liberty Records. What a memory. What a memory for it was like a kind of a.
I was in love with you. Oh, I was in love with you. And then which doctor told me what to do. He said.
Okay. See the world just isn't what it used to be and that's because they don't write them like that anymore.
Ooh, I think Tang while while I'm being banged. Right. And we can still say those because we didn't ask.
Oh, but if we asked if we say those things are no way banned by Joyce.
Yeah, we see national commercials all the time for red robin jacket a box and sonic of which they don't exist in software. The sonic on the west coast.
No hardies. Do you ever see a spot for hardies? Nope. I don't either. Maybe they don't do TV.
That's Schrumberger. Well, I'm just dying for one of those. I'm dying from eating. Well, you heard it on the year yesterday.
You pocket worked about eight million dollars worth of food in here yesterday and I ate pizza and onion rings and all kinds of bad stuff.
Ask me how my blood sugar is this morning.
Okay. A grainy YouTube video surfaced yesterday showing Sarah paylon being blessed in her hometown church.
It's on our website with the link to it. I'm pretty sure it's one of the stories. At least I send it along to I want my thousand dollars.
Court is being blessed in her hometown church three years ago by a Kenyan pastor who prayed for protection from which craft is she prepared to seek higher office.
I mean talk about crazy than a bed bug. Everybody in America should be forced to watch that just before they watch the vice presidential debate should it actually take place.
I bet you the night that they're going to have that VP debate that she comes down with like a hang nail or something. Oh, Sarah couldn't be there because she had a hang nail.
And she is a screw in her husband's ex partner by the way. Oh, the video shows paylon standing before Bishop Thomas Muthi in the pump out of was so
that somebody of God church holding her hands open as he asked Jesus Christ to keep her safe from every form of which craft.
Come on talk to God about this woman. We declare savor from Satan.
Muthi said is to attend his place their hands on paylon shoulders make her way from my God bring finances her way even for the campaign in the name of Jesus.
Use her to turn this nation the other way around.
Paylon formally announced to bid for governor a few months later October 2005.
Paylon doesn't say anything on this video and keeps her head bowed throughout the blessing.
She was baptized at the church stopped attending regular in 2002. She was busy getting laid by her husband's ex partner.
A spokesman for the McCain campaign declined to comment a person who answered the phone with the wassella church confirmed the video was from May 2005.
But declined for the comment probably from embarrassment purposes.
Paylon was baptized Roman Catholic is a newborn while she's all over the place.
Pentecostals are conservative in their reading of the Bible unlike most other Christians including most evangelicals.
Pentecostals believe in baptism in the Holy Spirit which can manifest itself through speaking in tongues like that.
Modern day prophecy in faith human which includes the laying on of hands.
Oh I guarantee she's done lots of laying on of hands on lots of glands.
Maria Camilla spokesman for the McCain paylon campaign said Pellamethen's different churches does not consider herself Pentecostal.
Just crazy like that.
And of course a lot of women in Africa have been butchered.
Burned at the stake.
Over when we was talking about that last night about all these witches women being proclaimed as witches and so they burn them and stuff.
Stuff that went out like way back in Salem here a couple of years ago.
Salem.
Yeah Winston Winston tastes good like a cigarette should.
I just smoked Newports when I was in college I smoked two three packs a day.
Newports.
Okay it was kind of a yeah cigarette.
Men thought you know when you say menthol cigarettes packets are gay.
I don't have an opinion on that.
Well that's because you're not a smoker and at least not a cigarette anyway not a bag.
It's 119 votes on the poll.
Who's the best example of nepotism in other words who's got the least talent the best example it should be self explanatory.
Anybody with IQ larger than their thumbnails should get it.
Which leaves a lot of you folks out.
121 votes.
Chris is just crelling from that.
I know what that meant.
George W. Bush 83 he's in a class by himself thank God.
I watched about two minutes in that last night I promised myself I wouldn't watch it.
But he was on there he was a guest on the Rachel Mano show you know she's got hands like a guy.
She's got a lot of things like a guy I think.
She has an Adam's apple I haven't you know she's got that desk.
I think she should put some lipstick on that thing.
You know she was wearing something the other night I forget when I was watching it.
Was she I took note she was wearing some makeup.
I think she heard you.
I think she heard your comments.
Rachel have a little makeup makeup like Uncle Milti would say makeup.
Christ yeah.
Now she leaves me limp.
She just keeps rehashing.
She keeps rehashing and recycling the same old Obermann guest.
George W. 83 Tony Troy spelling 17 Luke Russell six Sophia Coppola four.
Brooke Hogan three Michael Powell two.
Chad Lowe's got a pair Jeremy Shaplon Ashley Simpson one Nicholas Cage one Robert
Downey Jr. one Joe Mars Jr.

I won't get any votes on it Jamie Lee's fears don't have any key for Settling and
Joaquin Phoenix have none out of 121.
You'll see you're all look at all that look at the emails are pouring in today.
What is that all about I told you this thing was taken off like Halibut in and
Heifa and you said oh no Neil you're wrong or was it Clarence who said that?
Well you know what Jolly Joseph's oh yeah the audience wants to your
Neal's interaction with the colors yeah with the colors you know both of them.
The biggest name the best talent.
You're busy your projects.
Sport rate your five sixty QAM.

You've said the angel.
Wake nights from eight to 11 here on.
Sport rate your five sixty QAM.
Yeah.
What are my plays?
I'm waiting.
Come on Clarence.
The sports leader.
I know that the Zord even loves Neil Rogers.
I thought Christy I was fairy tales.
This religious thing was not for me.
They held a big convention.
They let me in for free.
Carcadilla turns around.
I don't idea what I was about to see.
They were speaking in tongues.
That made me a believer.
It was kind of fun.
Just to get out of my mouth.
Speaking tongue.
They got me believe in my tongue as we then from side to side.
The Lord will now embrace me.
I flat my tongue to the feet.
Now whatever I do, he'll forgive me.
Because now I speak in tongues.
That makes me a believer.
And I'm having fun.
Playing round with fine.
Now I speak in tongues.
That makes me a believer.
I'm going to read these two emails.
You're not going to wonder.
You're going to wonder why I wonder if there's any hope for the human race.
And they're both from like regulars, including our good friend Zisco.
So when you hear this, you're going to plots.
Don't know if you knew this.
McCain wants to debate on Friday post-pone because of the financial problems.
Even cancel his appearance on Letterman in order to speak to the rescue on our economy.
But wait, he canceled with Letterman and then did an interview with Katie Kourik.
He wants his debate rescheduled for next Thursday when the VP debate was supposed to occur.
Thus postponing indefinitely the VP debate, possibly without being able to be rescheduled.
They don't want the mad dog Sarah Pailin to debate.
Ha ha, right, Zisco.
No, I don't know if I knew that.
Did I talk about that for like about 85 hours today?
Yeah, a little bit.
And Anita, who's also a regular emailer and I thought had an IQ larger than her thumbnail,
she says, hello, Neal, my theory is this.
If Obama falls for McCain's BS and postpones the Friday night debate,
which he didn't fall for it and he will not postpone it,
the GOP will then say there's not enough time for the three debates unless they eliminate the VP debate.
Hopefully Obama will show up for the debate and McCain will have to join him.
It's amazing how these people keep feeding back to me the things that I've just been saying on the air.
Well, maybe they aren't listening today, maybe they're busy.
I think it's amazing how these people keep feeding back to you on things that you just said on the air.
Yeah, not that there's something new, but nevertheless.
No.
Tim and Miami says the hockey mom isn't made available to the press.
The maverick won't be available for the debate tomorrow.
I predict that McCain's efforts to bail out on the debate is the tipping point for this election.
No wavering independent can consider voting for this turn coat says Tim in Miami.
And William in somewhere.
Miami.
Well, he actually Williams got a date and a borrowed number.
How do you like that?
I asked me a big shot.
Like a like a business guy, you know, like Mark.
I imagine.
He says John McBush has for corruption, McCain's an expert.
His actions caused American taxpayer more than any other SNL failure than 90s.
Remember the savings alone crisis while McCain was instrumental causing the largest loss suffered by the US taxpayer in any anyone SNL failure.
And he's got a link to a bunch of articles, even from his hometown newspaper on the Keating 5.
Also, let's not forget that George Herbert Walker Bush's son, Neil Bush was a responsible party in the failure of the Silverado, SNL Colorado.
Of course, his daddy was president.
So Neil escaped scrutiny.
Neil God.
Neil Bush.
Bailing out on a faithful wife who was injured, hiding the injury from McCain and stuck by McCain when he was in prison, only to be dumped for a rich bimbo whose daddy is one of the largest but wise distributors in the country.
McCain carried on the adult risk relationship with the first with the would be first bimbo, while still married to his faithful crippled wife.
Does the word A whole cross your lips?
It says it's all about character.
And McCain has none.
Oh, and by the way, War Hero not POW.
You see, a war hero is not some dumb ass who screwed up, got shot down and lost a multimillion dollar airplane and had his ass dragged to the Hinoa hill.
And that's a POW, not a war hero.
Says William, who's pissed off and fired up.
He's lobbing his grenades.
Is what he says.
He says he's lobbing grenades.
Mark says, now it's getting to the point where it's almost unhandleable, which is good.
You know what I mean?
Yep.
I telephoned the dolphins organization prior to the season opener, Mark says, and quite about season tickets.
I asked if there would be a religious exercise and invocation before the start of each game.
The answer was yes, and that it's a dolphins tradition.
I passed on the season tickets.
Also, I would like your opinion.
Tommy Rowe underrated.
Oh, it makes me dizzy just to think about it.
Dizzy.
And then he's got in parentheses, hooray for Hazel.
Sheila, Crimson and Clover, which I'm sure is Tommy James and his shondells.
Yes.
Tommy Rowe might have done a cover on that, but Crimson and Clover was a big hit for Tommy James and his shondells.
Jam up, jelly tight.
Oh yeah, jam it up.
As in...
Brackham.
Apple pie.
Last, my vote for the best one hit wonder would be the cheater by Bob Kubin and the Inman.
Oh, come on.
I mean, that was okay.
That was the best one hit wonder.
We did that once upon a time.
I had to dig those poles out.
You know, if that was fun.
You hated it.
No, I saw in the news that it's like one hit wonder day or a week or some crap like that.
It is now?
Yeah.
One hit wonder week?
Something like that.
I wonder wonder who, but oh, who wrote the book of love, the monotones.
I'm sure you got that.
You know what?
One moment, please.
That only touched her fast.
You can only what?
Touch so fast.
Wonder who.
Who wrote the book of love?
That's it.

Carrie says.
Neil, like you, I find it hard to find a decent pizza in Toronto.
Do believe I stumbled on something halfway decent, voted the number one pie in Toronto,
a place called Vesuvio.
Let me know if you like it.
Call us with your order.
Oh, this is from Carrie from Mrs. Saga.
I see he, I guess he just pasted that line on there.
Well, he don't work for them.
I guess.
Because he, he's with a ocean air consolidated.
What is that?
What is that?
Last time I looked out the window.
I didn't see any ocean.
What's the one you see Lake Ontario, eh?
Carrie.
Carrie's in Mrs. Saga, poor baby.
Sorry about that traffic on a QAW, Carrie.
Well, the traffic here, the driving here is the world's worth,
and the traffic as a result of it probably is right in there.
Jonathan invoked his all apologetic.
I don't even know what he's talking about.
He says it was a money python and holy grail reference.
Sorry for the poor choice of movie.
Should I stop emailing or just go F myself?
Why don't you keep emailing, but you can still go F yourself with an apple pie?
What does he preferring to?
I don't know.
Oh, yesterday it was a money python.
Don't you remember the, um, oh, that's right.
I like Chinese.
No.
No?
No.
Okay.
I don't know.
I don't know what he's talking about.
Let me know what you're talking about, Jonathan,
and you can still go F yourself.
If you double-jointed like Ron Jeremy, you can do something else too.
Paul says I saw at least three McCain campaign I ads on TV this morning.
What happened to the suspension of the campaign?
Suspension of belief is what we're supposed to have.
Suspension of belief that there's daughtering old fool and there's hockey mom,
this slut, this trailer trash slut from Alaska are planning on being in a White House.
You've got to be schmittin' me and bubble it and go there and speak.
That first email we had this morning, he was right.
Boba, Boba, Boba, behind the scenes, he's trying to pull you, you know what I'm saying?
Yep.
He's still campaigning for a swillery for 2012.
He wants that bitch out of the house in Chapacua.
Jay and Baltimore says the trailer for the new Oliver Stone movie, W,
it looks pretty good.
Apparently the movie is going to cover from Bush's younger days all the way up to the beginning of the Iraq War.
The Bush years are too screwed up for one movie.
The trailer is here if you want to take a puke at it.
No, thanks anyway.
First of all, it's Oliver Stone.
Secondly, it's about W. Stone.
Then he says when I saw the president do a stupid speech,
all I could think about was that it needed to call you those years ago,
thinking Bush for the low gas prices, what a schmittball that guy was.
At that time, over 70% of the country's support of the war.
But day after day, you said it was Vietnam all over again.
As always, you were right and they were wrong.
It says Jay in Baltimore.
You go Jay.

Crash McKay.
As water on his brain.
Crash McKay.
Is used to those guidance.
Crash McKay.
Is good flyer plane.
He walks the same, I racked for 100 years until I rocked Q.
Patient at one.
The theme of his campaign is country reversed.

Johnny Peripin's all-marfarin policy problem.
Had the drop of a bomb.
In this place, a station system is in.
They you and color us down.
Crash McKay.

Somehow he survived it.
Crash McKay.
That's not good news for us.
What is it exactly that the meaty does?
Oh.
Maybe the VP's got a PP, you think?
Maybe.
Maybe we got to do a PP.
It's 11.30.25.60 W and we got the big O.
Rock solid.
That could two o'clock to digest and rehash and regurgitate.
All that important sports crap.
It's important, you know.
Marlins are done.
The Marlins.
How many games they got left?
About four or five.
Four.
Chris.
Four.
Mm-hmm.
I think they had to do like McKay not to do.
Just, just, forfeit the rest, you know.
I think he had to drop out.
Okay.
Can't be something if he came on today.
Yeah.
And made a breathless announcement.
Of course he's always breathless because he's old and daughtering and dying.
They just announced that he was dropping out.
He just, you know, he sees the handwriting on the wall like Daniel and Lyons did.
Who?
Wasn't Daniel who saw the handwriting on the wall?
That was him.
Yeah.
More bubble miceies.
Just like Jonah in the whale.
Oh my god.
He was a whale of a guy though, Jonah.
And don't forget about Noah, Drunken Noah and his arc.
I won't.
And Rochester, we had a chain of hardware stores called Noah's Ark.
If anybody ever asked you that like on Jeopardy or something.
Okay.
It certainly pays to be Treasury Secretary if your former firm is a brokerage house in a new study says,
Goldman Sachs Group formerly run by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Morgan Stanley
stand to be among the biggest beneficiaries of the $700 billion US bailout.
It's benefits and its current formal largely be limited to investment banks and other banks
that have aggressively written down the value of their holdings and have already recognized the
attend the capital impairment.
Jeffrey Rosenberg, Bank of America's head of credit strategy research,
wrote in a report obtained by Bloomberg News.
Paulson was head of Goldman Sachs Investment Banking Division from 1994.
He later became chairman and CEO of Goldman and left his post and joined the Bush administration.
It's just a coincidence by the way that they're going to stand to benefit so much.
You do understand that.
Just like it's just a coincidence that Halliburton stood to get all those
a no-bid contracts in Iraq of which your vice president Dick Cheney is the former peace of crap.
Court of the study that bailout benefits Paulson's former firm more because banks haven't had to write down
as many troubled mortgage assets under accounting rules.
It means that participating in the program would cause them to actually lose capital as opposed to investment banks which stand to gain.
By Goldman Sachs as in Sack a Crap.
But nevertheless, Chuck says I'm at a red robin for the first time when I lived in Texas who was pretty good.
Red robin. Remember robin Seymour in Detroit?
No.
Rock and Robin?
Rock and Robin?
I remember that.
Robin Seymour.
He was on WJVK and he was on CKLW.
Robin Seymour.
Back in the day of personality radio in Detroit.
Anyway, they have different types of toppings for their boogers, red robin, and have dinner-type fries.
What does that mean dinner-type fries?
I don't know.
The only Florida location in Fort Myers I visited about four months ago is located an outdoor type shop.
Well, that's interesting because he's just visited four months ago and the other guy said it's been out of business for years.
I would recommend red robin but only if he happened to be on the Southwest coast.
I don't think it's really worth the drive.
You don't want to drive to go eat in a dive dive.
Five guys, burgers and fries as a national team that people should check out never heard of it.
Never heard of red robin either.
I don't think I heard a robin with the green tights.
They have great burgers and the French fries are cooked in peanut oil with their skins on.
Oh my God.
I didn't know that fries had the foreskin.
The fries at five guys remind me a lot of wolves.
Five guys has got locations in Florida.
Great show is always Chuck.
I'm currently using Ubuntu Linux and Firefox 2.0.

No, thank you
From 30 to 40 cops and the same Lucy County Sheriff's deputies were sent to the gas station to control a crowd and traffic Kirk said

Even a term of up to a month in prison
Because they were drinking juice juice
The young people told the court they were not Muslims and were thus unaware of the fact that directions could be punishable
The court took the mitigating circumstances in a consideration
But found that the defendant's guilty anyhow since ignorance does not excuse a responsibility
The court ruled that the young people must pay the fine of a thousand durham's 278 bucks each
The case became the first one since Dubai in Dubai and violation of article 313 since the beginning of the month of Ramadan on September 1

Aggressives in districts other than their own especially when the candidate in questions a long time personal favorite and is being targeted for defeat by the fascist plutocrats
Bob Wexler Bob Wexler isn't going to get beaten okay just relax calm down
Send him a whole bunch of money. He's great. He's one of my favorites to Bobby Wexler is not going to get defeated

I'm checking up on here because if we still have 88 certificates left
I'm gonna be really
85 well, you're not giving me no update 81 now and you know something what part of the problem is this damn QAM.com

How can we stick it to those bastards around between ten and two
They say all that crap about us. It's all true
Aaron Gupta. I wonder if I wonder our own is a kind to a doctor. So I'm a Gupta
You know dr. Gupta. Yes, he pooped
Was in rage as he learned the details of Treasury Secretary of Palsons playing the Fixed-D West Banking System with $700 billion in taxpayer funds
The 43 year old copy editor in freelance journalist who publishes his own alternative newspaper the independent needed the channel is
But couldn't find a live protest to attend so on September 22
He's sent an email to some politically active friends in New York within days
They'd planned a protest against the bailout in New York and an 80 other state locations in the US on September 25
Which is today? I
Couldn't sit back while this plan gets rammed through congresses Gupta
We live in a digital world, but change has to happen in an analog world. We married the two
The internet health has organized like wildfire. I see we married the two
Is written very poorly
Gupta now working with the online organization true majority doctor or says he expects hundreds possibly a thousand protesters
Convergent protest near Wall Street protesters planned to build a pile of citizen junk
That the government should also purchase in front of the iconic bullscooter. We haven't seen it on TV
They got some blonde bimbo there on CNN standing in front of the
somewhere
Much of the populist outrage against the bailout is building on the internet in blog post and websites
And not all the posters created by left wingers like Gupta the internet is now swirling with petitions
The baits border we on rants and fighting satare about Paulson's plan and its potential consequences
The calls to arms come from across the political spectrum from right wing enemies of taxes
To libertarians and left wing progressives they demand that Congress amend
Scaleback or scrap the plan altogether
The anger fueled much of the political theater in Washington this week
It's a democratic and republican lawmakers are working behind the scenes to put together that deal with Paulson and the Bush administration
They got to get that thing put together or are old funny. That. He don't want to show up for the debate tomorrow night
So they can cancel the VP debate and get Sarah off the hook for all time's sake so transparent

He said all the ads pay his salary so he loves him
Hmm
What what what all the ads pay his salary yeah, well good then I'm not gonna worry about that check then fine

So it's just once in a blue moon that we need access to that qam.com and you keep you know
You guys keep putting stuff on there. Oh usually it's Danny boy
He said Danny boy this and Danny boy that whatever Danny boy does he takes precedence over us

Pete and Bokas says I
Should be a reason these were my mouthful whatever what wouldn't be the first time
How many of you guys left 68 correct
Well, we'll get them we'll get her done. Maybe might take three tomorrow, but we'll get them done
And if not like I always say on these certificates
It's it's not like you're doing us a favor. We're doing you the favor
Especially during these really really tough economic times
And you can buy up to five of them by the way
Right yep
Now we're doing you we're doing you a favor Neil. We're doing you a favor. Yeah, okay. Don't do me any favors
Peter from Bokas is I find the timing of this economic meltdown a little suspicious
Makes me wonder if this whole mess wasn't part of a bigger plan
I really believe there are people tied to the bushes and the power elite
They must be thinking they're about to get away with the biggest heist in history a little too coincidental that the oil prices
Explode a few months before Bush Lave's office a little too
Coincident over housing bubble bursts
And all of a sudden bush gets on TV and begs for close to a trillion dollars
Hmm just like the trillion dollars that he peed away in Iraq
Besides the billions that Bush and his friends will make from the war and increase the oil prices now
They're gonna empty the treasure right before Bush heads off the Crawford
Neil I'm not much for conspiracies, but this is really starting to stink he says
This administration has no fear of being exposed or prosecuted
They've got away with so much without any repercussions time and time again. So I am not take it all
Just take it all
Now I'm speaking of taking money
He says one thing I've learned from your merkins are dumb as dirt and they're paying for their stupidity
That's right Pete
Now this morning I got an email not gonna say who was from because you told me oh don't do it. It would be very bad
Hey, whatever no, okay
But it was a request for a loan of four thousand dollars from somebody I don't even know yeah
What no, that's a new thing that's a new one on me
I mean the bank in Nigeria you know that's one thing. I don't know those people either but they're asking me for money
Well, he's actually called uh
Couple months ago asking for you George did he know you're already gone. Oh, and he wanted to ask if you had some money to lend him
Are you serious? I swear to you
I just told that
ah
Oh boy, actually I think he called I'm choking on the mushroom
Twice in three weeks. Oh, god
Hey
No, the really funny part was after I said that you didn't have any money you could lend him he's like oh well
Do you I'm like no brother. Sorry. I don't
Like I definitely don't trust me
Let it go. I'm leaving my weaning
No more bites
So don't feel bad. You know don't feel special apparently he's asking everybody
Really interesting that your reaction when it was you is a lot different than when I told you
It's funny because I don't have any money you see
So you do it's just sad that people with a lot of money, you know, beggars. They attract beggars people with a lot of money attract people
You know, I'm gonna put my mustard away while I think about how whatever
Places and how much you can give them so it's not funny. It's just sad when people when bums, you know
Bag from rich people. I mean, that's who you would beg money off of is somebody that has some that ain't funny
It's just sad and pathetic
But to ask you for me or me. Yep
Yeah, it literally cuz he called one day. It was like two thirty in the afternoon
And I'm like, I he's calling here stuff like I was like oh
I'm gonna leave it
And take it or leave him I really do like Bob McGowan. He's a great broadcaster, but the stuff he talks about is so
Tremorly boring. I can't watch it no more
Six right towards that off the ear
Every time I turn it on you're talking about golf writer cop and
This one and I was who's the Canadian golfer Mike Wears. Edden. I have no idea
I'm sorry. I just it's just ponderous man. It's boring
But what about the Keynes, baby the Keynes and bush dives. Bush dives that that Yehu Bush dives. He's in town now
And they're starting quarterback is injured in my right ques. They're like a little girls team now that they got no quarterback
Oh, that I have no idea. Maybe they can borrow Matt castle from the pants
Now if you were the Patriots wouldn't you go out and get another quarterback? I
Would have tried to yeah when you go out and sign like a real quarterback talk to
I tell me they got a couple there who Tampa Bay
How about Rajon Beck rhymes with Dreck a lot of them if you'd be a upgrade from Matt castle
I
Not castle. He sure looks pretty good, but he can't play with a schmoo
Get names the best talent

It's 1232 to 560, another email from somebody wondering
Has McCain suffered a stroke
Hmm?
Has he suffered?
Did he cancel the debate?
He sure didn't cancel his speech there in front of that bubble group this morning
With all those bubble miceys
Cornell says it's amazing how you and George can hit it on the head every day of the week
Do you know we get hit on the head every day of the week?
I do.
I feel like it
Maybe that's why I sprouted at the floater
Oh, they don't bother me that much, no more
I'm getting used to it
I wanted to let you know that I get to hang around a few young people, 20s and 30s, who are energized by the selection
Or they used to talk about nothing but women, sports, motorcycles
Now they're talking about this election
They actually text each other with, did you hear what Neil was saying today or are you watching MSNBC?
It makes my day that you're getting through to them
I'm turning the mind of the Neil Rogers show slowly but surely
Yeah, just like Jolly Jo Bell, he's expanding our audience slowly but surely very slowly and not very surely
Dimwit
Get Jolly Jo off his ass head of the sense of them reading diaries to the fellows in the hood
Says Cornell, he says Joyce Jolly Jo and Go Obama Go
And what do you know?
Thanks Cornell
What do you think?
You think that the McCain had a stroke?
Hmm
Hmm
Here's one from, oh this is this just this whole email makes me want to cry
In fact, people generally a lot of make me want to cry so many of them
What's that speaking of that bit I just played?
What's that play Jersey Boys about the four seasons?
Okay
Is that just here or is that on Broadway or what is that?
I don't know
Jersey Boys
It's about the four seasons in Frankie Valley
What was that song that that last parody was?
I'll Billie Joel, uptown girl
Oh uptown girl
Yeah, that was that I got to do with the four seasons
I don't know
Well, it's the same kind of thing that would be a falsetto voice in the whole deal
I know
Yeah
Hmm, well that was quick
Four seasons did that?
Not at all
Not that one but I bet you they done it
Double Veria
To do what?
That they did uptown girl?
No, I don't know
No
It just sounds like one of their songs, you know?
It's got that like I said
Yeah, big girls and five
Little drums, many drummers
Here's where he grew up
He used to be not to be confused with
Ragdoll, that's right

Now let it go
Oh, I was going to play one that I like
Sherry?
Yeah
I like Sherry
And the song too
I see
Oh Sherry
Sherry, baby Sherry
I can't believe it, you wouldn't play the drums for a while
You walk like a man
I always do
You're queer
You walk
Walk
Walk
I tell you the drummer, okay, I said enough
The drummer and the funk brothers, I forget what his name is
He just is great
Now, what song was it one of the Ben Harper songs they did?
He did two songs on that video
He did, I heard it through the grapevine
So definitely, I always, uh, the, um, stone song
Which one?
I don't know
You know
I'm thinking
At the end of it, the drummer, he just goes nuts on it
He's great
They're all great, the funk brothers
Standing in the shadows of Motown, everybody needs to go, uh, you see that
Yep
Buy the video, steal it, get the soundtrack
I'd play it if I could find the name soundtrack
Here, there's just got too much stuff piled up here
Was it dry?
Was it dry?
No
It was a temptation song, ain't too proud to beg
Oh
I mean, the stones did it too, but it was a temptation song
Stones ripped it off
Here's this very disturbing email
Remember I was talking about Hanson before?
Uh-huh
What is it with you people with the Hanson brothers, okay?
I can understand Canadians who are tend to be very silly people
Getting all whipped up about the Hanson brothers
And, um, what was that stupid movie Slavshot?
You know the Hanson brothers?
Nope
They did a really bad hockey movie called Slavshot about 100 years ago
It wasn't funny, they're not funny, they're annoying
So Nick, uh, not Nick, oh not Nick Noley, Dan from Erlen says
Met them in Indiana last year to minor league hockey game
30th anniversary of the movie Slavshot and they look the same, hard to believe
I wasn't talking about the Hanson brothers from Slavshot
I was talking about those ugly Martian looking kids, uh, Hanson from that music group
God, and then he writes
Walter Case was the best, he gets out of jail in the spring for stabbing his ex-wife soon
Walter Case may be the most troubled, uh, him along with Irvay Filion
The most, but even beyond that, because Irvay never rust stabbed his wife
The most troubled driver in history of harness racing
And this is the guy that he picks out
He's not driving now and hasn't in years, but this is the name he comes up with
As opposed to responding to the question
Dan, stay in Maryland, okay, stay in Ballamber
God, I'll see a Dover Downs in Delaware
Not, you know, once upon a time I think I was vacationing in Philly
Philly's not bad, it's just for good food
And I drove to Atlantic City and I was going to go to Dover Downs, it's in Dover, Delaware
Yeah
And I drove into Dover and I'm going to tell you something, I drove right out
I just kept on my rent a car, I just kept on driving
It was just one big slum, and I didn't see any, I mean, I don't want to sound like some old bigot, but I didn't see any white people
Not one
And you saw, I kind of felt like out of place, though, but you know what I mean?
Yep, it was a scary place
That doesn't mean that, you know, if you're in a Detroit, if you're in a place where it is like all black people
And you're the only white person within miles, that doesn't mean it's necessarily dangerous
But we white folks, we just sometimes feel that way
Am I right?
Right, I mean if Barack Obama would have been out there waiting to shake my hand, I'd have gotten out and meet in Greek
You know what would have been great, but there was nobody there who looked like Barack Obama
It looked like a really, really smart-me-place Dover, Delaware, I could be wrong about that
You ever been there?
Nope, why not?
I've been a Newark
Oh, that's just the idea I was going to say
What the hell?

Then wave at the bar and country closest to you
To enhance your foreign policy experience
Hey, how are you?

Even without the Z, the authentic likeness of the Sarah Palin Funpatch Doll doubles as a useful puppet
This is Sarah Palin Gritch and succulents and famines
The Sarah Palin Funpatch Doll
Another small town ideal toy
From Crystal Methlac
Club 45, when we got a cancel ed debate

David Miramar speaking of dumb, they've got some help
Wait till you hear this email, Ken?
Sure had been loaded up with emails today
And it's true that this thing is like just catch it on like wildfire
Who did that song wildfire? Michael Murphy?
I think you're right. I'll be damned

Yeah
No, you don't have to look it up, I don't want to hear it
It's not a good song. Hey, that's Michael Martin Murphy to you
Michael what? Martin Murphy
What does that mean? That's his name, man
Just because you're chummy with him and unfamiliar terms that doesn't mean you can get his name wrong
I'll be damned on a public forum
I went to high school with a kid named Marty Schneider

Dave and Miramar says
Hey, Neal, I've tried three different body washes
And found them to be a big waste W-A-I-S-T
A big waste of money
It takes a large amount to get a bubble
And almost impossible to rinse off
Not to mention the past plastic bottle being an environmental issue
I'll stick to lever 2,000 bars in a wash cloth
Using a bar so properly
You won't get any here on the bar
And it will not get slimy
After soaping up your wash cloth
Rinse the bar off and put it in a dry soap dish done
And by the way, body washes are gay
Gay, this is Dave and Miramar
Hmm, I think you're gay Dave and Miramar
You're either that are retarded
Like there's some like his rocket science
How to use body wash
And he's already using a cloth with his soap
A wash cloth
So why can't you smear some of the body wash on a wash cloth?
You idiot
Right, and it's hard to get a bubble
What does that mean?
Lather, I think, maybe he's what he's talking about
Hard to work up a bubble
I don't know
Well, let's work up a big bubble and put Sarah in there
So nobody can ask her any questions or get too close to her that bitch
And realize she is what she is
Oh my god
Don't let me forget to go out and get the inquiry today
So I can read the whole article tomorrow about how she was screwing her husband's ex-business partner
Okay
Tommy Tees says, kneels at Mir as Paul McCartney

Paul McCartney, you know, he just turned 150
Well, he's had a tough time
You know, with that bitch ex-wife, he's all that stuff
That's what happens when you got money
Everybody wants a piece
Oh, I don't know you, you don't know me
But can I borrow $4,000?
And you're telling me I should keep my mouth shut about that
I didn't say who it was
Okay, whatever, you know?
But it's somebody I don't even know

I don't know the person I've never met them
I don't know from them, I don't, you know

So we sold 37, we still got 63 to go on, have a dqm.com
I think it's a lawsuit, I'm going to sue Josh Cordes
Instead of checking to me, he's going to get a lawsuit
Yeah
A subpoena
No, it's a great annoying, have you been on air?
Yes, and all about it, exactly what you're talking about
The thing keeps flying over a marble high course
Every time you turn around, they come up with some, there it is
Stay cool with football season, football season my ass
And of course there's Danny's picture, oh yeah, beat Dan
I'd like to with a stick, beat Dan
And then finally, that thing clears away and there's an open now, Neil's deals
You suck, Cordes, you think I've sent you a check?
You got about 10 chances of me sending you a check
And they all start with a zero, none
No, if he don't want to put the stories up there, I'll have Chris doing that
And you know what, I'll make sure I'll FedEx to check to Chris
All right, nice
I will, just as a way of getting even with Cordes for dealing with us
Oh well I can't do anything about it, then you're useless, okay?
Everybody in that place, just like Flea with the thing about the rejoins
I mean, it is not his department for can you have a civilized conversation with Clarence Dero
No
No, it's not your department, it's programming a but out you Torb
See, then we tell him the other day, we warned him
They're turning on him like a cornered rat, man
Yep, we did warn him
Because he is consorting with us and with this show and now he's on the QAM Schmitt list, baby
He is Mr. SH
Speaking of Clarence
Here's an email from anal
Y'all, I wish I could read the last name that they use on this email's Q
Yeah, is it pro? I can't, no, I can't do it
I can't even come close
I'm troubled by some of the recent goings on with the McCain campaign, it almost looks as if they want to lose
First wall street spirals out of control and then George Will and Chuck Crouthammer
Among other among others, writes, skating articles about how McCain is unqualified to be president
Now McCain wants to post voter marauds debate to focus on the economy, he's trying to lose
Is it possible to be public in his want Obama to win with the attendance saddling him and his party with the blame
For the upcoming great depression
In all likelihood there is no quick end of this mess if somehow Obama wins by 2010
The GOP will come back with a new contract on America and trick the public into giving Republicans control a Congress
Effectively, dooming the second half of Obama's presidency
With Obama and the Democrats effectively demonized the homeschooled flag waving crowd
The'll crawl out of their caves, teng to their guns and bibles and both the Republicans into power for the next 12 to 20 years
Good gravy, Ainal says, I hope I'm wrong but I wouldn't put it past him
Country first, my ass, love the show, Neil don't ever change, sign Ainal
And if I held onto that for a while would that make me Ainal retent it?
Yeah it would
Glad you made that choke
No it's weak
It's better than there's knock knock too
All this thinking about making it but I was too scared
Oh and wait till you hear this more of that

George thought it was ground control occernal Glenn and you played a few seconds of that
Trust me there was an old and great bit used to play frequently

Well when he mails it to us then well nobody's talking about
Yeah please try to find that bit and play it it's hilarious no hope you knew format is working well

Yeah just like this one Gary you also commented I was only sending emails so I could hear him read on the show
Daw isn't at the point
Of course people send them to hear and read them on the show with your comments or reactions etc
What also be the point of sending them if not to hear them just to kill some time

or what part of fill you visited
but let me tell you from experience it's a toilet
oh this is years ago
years ago Shirley
I lived there for over 20 years before I came down here
it's full of drug addicts and crime
I would hear gunshots almost every night
oh let's go for the last one call
also I hope when you went to Lanark City
you didn't step off the main strip either
other than Los Angeles
Atlantic City was the only other place I've ever been
where I could you could almost smell fear in a year
I remember I parked
I went to Casino
and I parked in the parking garage
and when I walked out to look for the
a rented car in the parking garage
I was like terrified
oh yeah
and I wasn't even out on the streets
you know I was just in the parking garage
how long since you've been there?
oh it's a long time years
I was there two years ago I guess
with Eddie Kay
and I think it's right around
seizures I guess it is
they're really rebuilding everything
and it's like you know new shops
everything looks really nice
but literally if you go two blocks
even off the main road
if you're like two blocks off of it
it's still you know the old look in
and you just you don't want to go there at all
so yeah
scummy and slimy
and smarmy
George is still out
hours
oh no I've been here
oh my
you're in this conversation
did I miss something important?
I was just talking about
I got an email about
Philly being a toilet in the
Atlanta City
also
and I reprise my story
about going to a casino
and Atlantic City many years ago
and going to get my rented car
in the parking garage
and feeling
just the smell of fear in the air
just as a scary police
I just know what those people that walk around like you know looking over my shoulder, but we just oh yeah, I'm scary
There was the smell of fear in the bathroom just now. No, I don't think that was fear
Mm-hmm, and I think the smell of fear is outside the bathroom
Be afraid be very free to smell that's inside
I don't understand what's going on with you man George show up about 20 minutes
I ate something last night don't ask me what it was because I don't remember
Yeah, like it had an effect well because I woke up today not being able to stop doing that so

63 we still got that that's pathetic. Oh
There's Barney Fag
That's
Are you heard it from both parties there?
Democrat and Republican they're holding a live news conference on the hill there you heard it
They say they have a plan they are going to respond to the president with regard to this federal bailout plan
They believe it'll pass the house the Senate be signed by the president Ed Henry real quickly
We're still not hearing when though when they will do that and if and obviously it is it's up to the
All three parties here to sign off let me read the tea leaves been around long enough to tell you once they
Democrats are Republican start patting each other on the back. They're pretty close to finally passing
Yeah, they're all they're done. Maybe it's not an hour. McCain is gonna have no excuse to avoid that debate to sign step at the
Mar or night, which means next week the vice presidential debate is gonna take place
Unless of course, yeah, he's got a hang nail great or son is consummating a big drug deal up there in Alaska and
He's mommy to come up and write a check
Jeff and Boi and Beats it or maybe maybe the daughter is like you're giving birth to triplets or something

Liston ship to your show

Don't you love the way they put you in there like they don't want to leave you out. It's fine. Thank you
Yes, I appreciate that remember uncle Miltees on Alton Road next to the epic here. No, I sure don't
My grandfather Joe Cole gold for our brand the place him and his friend Alfie used to run numbers back then
I was just a kid but when he was older he had a lot of interesting tales to tell me he told me he met you
I almost met you in a Marlins game
But was too scared to talk to you you were with a big guy probably fat rich sitting on the first base side
Anyway, I know this might be a weird email
But I just had to get my face and tell you you're appreciated every day for the hard work and being honest also not for not being a sellout
We're extremely lucky to have you in George life is what we learned from other people in our own experiences
We can all learn a lot from you guys. Thanks and have a good one
I wish I had a good one but nevertheless
Thanks Jay whatever your name is
Lots and lots of stuff pouring in on there in spite of them. Oh, no, we like Neil interacting with the colors

Shocking. Oh, but you're gonna the callers are what makes this show Neil the call. I'm your fan. Yeah blow it out your ass
God
Or take an apple pie from Mickey D's and stick it up there
Mike says I think one of the things people like best about your show is how you rail on management
You say all the things that they would like to say about their boss
Was there a point when you first started to do that management wanted to fire you before they realized that the ratings
It brought or did you get to them first before you started tell them you were gonna do it as a stick so they wouldn't fire you
Oh, yeah, I want the management said I'm gonna rip you on air is that okay? Come on Mike
You think anyone warned Joe Bell about it before he came down
Or does he know or think it's just a stick? I don't care what he knows or thinks because in his case
It's not just a stick believe me
See that you were doing well most of this until you got to that part. It's just stick. It's that I
Couldn't make up the kind of stuff that they're doing to this place especially jolly Joe and clearance and Joyce
By the way, did I mention that the unmentable one got disbarred and floored earlier today?
Did I miss you did oh
Long overdue better late than never too much hanky spanky baby for too many years God
I don't really recall when I started with the management, but once you start getting the big numbers I
Think it might have been an I and Z

When when mommy who owned the station made the son-in-law Tim Williams the general mangler. Oh my god
What a moron what a oh don't rip beyond remember what we went to IOD or when I would know you would remember

Disney passed along a very humorous request from Tim Williams. Oh my kids. I have teenage kids
They listen to the show and kneels ripping me on the air and all the kids are you know too bad?
Like I'm gonna stop ripping him on the air and ripping him the ass
He's so richly deserved because his kids are taking crap in school because their daddy's a dodo bird
And I'm sure that they realize their daddy's a dodo bird right of course
Kids are not stupid 15 oh here Shamwa wait a minute or dry
This is for the house the car the boat the RV
Shamwa holds 20 times its weight and liquid look at this. It just does the work. Why do you want to work twice as hard?
Doesn't fit doesn't make a mess
Bring it out you wash it in the washing machine made in Germany. You know the Germans always make good stuff
You can cut it in half. There's one is a bath mat
Train your dishes with the other one. You don't want as a towel. You know why you're right
They use it as a towel. Look at completely dry. You've never seen this Shamwa, huh?

Things that have to do with radio clearance
The greatest day of my life is when you call and report to me that somebody finally had enough and just sliced his head off
