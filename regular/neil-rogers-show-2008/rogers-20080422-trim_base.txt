New person in this program will be produced by the best government of the UAL
Becoming also incorporated.
The biggest name is the best talent.
You're listening to sports Radio 560 WQAM.
My name is Ola D'Ale.
I'm Sir General Pierre D'Ale.
I guess I will.
I took home the person all that year.
The device is actually out of reach and is for the new Roger Show.
The original Z-Rex R5-6 is the first break box for the end day in the row.
In other counties, I want hold free crowd of 7775 NEO or pound by 60 on your AC&T and Verizon Wireless phones.
The appearance is pressed by the SES.
Oh, he's cool.
He's not wearing a Z-Rex of WQAM management staff.
You're a new person in the field.
Roger Show, I'm 560 WQAM.
NEO?
God, Randall Simmons is a real Geico customer, not a paid celebrity.
So to help us tell his story, we hired an actual celebrity.
Barack Obama's pastor, Jeremiah Wright.
I was in my car headed out on a date when I had my accident.
Accident! It was no accident!
Not a dera black man in this contract!
I called Geico and right from the start I couldn't believe how helpful they were.
Oh yes, they wanted to believe, but I never believed the white man or no.
Geico got me a loner car and actually called ahead to the restaurant and explained why I was late.
I'm still waiting on an explanation, an explanation of how come a race of him in this contrasting agenda,
an explanation of how a black man has never been president cannot get an even.
Geico, real service, real savings, real insane celebrity.
Oh, that's our station man, that's QA and real insane celebrities.
Like that, we got jerks to become that come up at two, and then we got the DA show for the man dog at four.
First pitch with Jesse Agde, what else?
Marlins are on fire, Chris, they're smoking it.
Yep.
That will last.
Dolphins, Al-Assas, 79 and John Linder for a DA who's on earlier of course, not a minute now.
We're not going to have him do in double duty again, that's too much duty.
Oh boy.
I have a warning for you people out there about halls, no sugar added, vitamin C drops, but we'll get to that in a minute.
Oh, I guess I better do it now because other when we get to this poll too many numbers.
Oh, there he goes again, mailing in the freaking numbers, that son of a bitch faggot.
That's right, that's me.
You know, I could solve this problem, although I sound okay, don't I?
Yes you did.
A little bit scratchy, maybe I had a couple of little horses.
But yeah, he'll be a little horse.
Keep on that tea in a third race, a little horse.
Tea pots.
Oh, speaking of horse, Dave Pallone, you've heard me mention him many times that, I've always even thought you were nothing about it.
He said a per mutual record yesterday he won 11 of the 14 races.
All right, I'm sure that means something.
A lot of money.
Do you have any idea what that means to when 11 races in one day?
No.
Being tired?
I guess it means a lot.
Uh oh.
I'm going to be doing a lot of sniffling in.
Okay, that's fine.
Zombies.
Floating my nose.
Well, it goes with the territory.
That's right.
And those three people out there who actually care whether I'm alive or dead are probably saying,
well gee, what do you got Neil?
What kind of crud you got?
Well, I got either a cold or the flu or allergies.
Remember I was telling you how I've been reading that many, many times you think you've got a cold and it's really allergies.
You get a Rothschrode and a running nose and red eyes and headache and tired.
And a lot of flu symptoms, but it's really just allergies.
I had really bad ear here last few days.
I mean, it's been beautiful.
Like now it's sunny and like going to be 72 or whatever, but it's been polluted air.
You know what I mean?
Smog alert things like that.
Burnt dry.
Huh?
Burnt dries.
It burns here.
Burns.
So anyway, yesterday I figured being the genius that I am.
And I got another whole bag of these, so that was solved my problem.
Although I'm going to tell you, I never want to be that sick again.
I have never, ever felt so on that store as I did yesterday.
Real night.
Oh yeah.
I mean, my insides were like exploding.
And I'm not just talking about from the...
Back to...
No, I took care of that.
I was able, luckily, not to have another accident.
Well, now that you're getting old, you have a lot of rectal problems.
Yeah.
Careful, I want to ask problems.
Well, that goes with the territory.
But anyway, I guess when you're full of crap like I am, you never run out.
But I got these no sugar added, Hall's Vitamin C drops, our cough drops, you know?
For the throat, the suture's throat, which usually these kinds of things,
like the regular Hall's Menta Liptes, sugar-free, are fine.
Now, at Grants, you have a little bit of sorbitol or one of those things at them.
And if you have too many of them, it makes you crap your brains out.
And I said that, crap your brains out, it just makes you crap a lot.
But anyway, and I looked on the back here on the label,
and unfortunately I didn't read it well enough.
Because when I got home last night and just sick as a dog,
I mean, my insides were exploding.
It felt like I had bowling balls rolling around on my intestine.
And I looked on the back here, I don't find any of those ingredients like
ice, malt or maltatol or sorbitol or nothing at all.
But it does say maximum two per day.
Now, first of all, what kind of cough drop or throat lozons,
two per day without good azacca, that's crap.
That's not going to do any good, maximum two per day.
Well, there must be a reason why it's maximum two per day.
And of course, I only had 24 of them.
They're 25 in the package and they're all 24.
Why are you eating like candy, you know?
That's right.
And it was over a period of a few hours.
So I don't think I have to apologize for that.
But my god, and I have another whole bag of them in the other room.
So I could start on them right now.
Do you think I could have one now?
Hey, we'll do it on air experiment, how's that?
Oh, now if I'm going to feel like I did last time.
We'll get some bits loaded up, you know, all the loaded, ready bits.
Uh-huh.
Okay, I'm having the last one of this bag.
They're very good.
They're delicious.
I might have had them.
Pomegranate citrus.
Ooh.
Oh yeah, the very taste.
Sounds very good.
Mm-hmm.
No sugar added.
Sauns sucre ajut.
Ajutte.
See, in Canada, everything by law must be labeled.
Every product must be labeled in frog.
In frog.
Oh, a nice job, by the way, with the frogs, winning the series against the Bruins.
And they went nuts in the streets in Montreal, burning up police cars and wrecking cars.
Just going nuts.
Bunch of damn stupid frogs.
They are.
I mean, I haven't been all over the world, so I'm sure they can probably find some scum of your people in the French Canadians.
But I, and you know, for years, before I ever went to Montreal, it was notorious and soft for the people in
Hall and Dale and Damien, Hollywood.
Just bitching and moaning about the French Canadians who were coming to the winner.
The cheap frogs wouldn't tip them with their speedos on a beach.
And actually maybe the worst drivers.
Mm-hmm.
And now that I've been there a couple times, I mean, well, a few times.
I won't go back.
If I ever go back, what?
She bitch me out.
All right.
Well, bitch.
I got to hold back at least, so maybe, I mean, I would think that one would be okay, wouldn't you?
I would imagine.
You're very good.
And maybe you've already gotten it all out of your system.
You know, maybe you've been built up some time.
I don't think so.
Really?
All right.
We'll find out.
I mean, I hope so, but what have you gotten it all out of your system?
They give you the cramps without the M.
Anyway, here's the deal we're doing this.
And we're not changing the poll again today.
We started with over a thousand tallies on here, but it's a survey.
You know, what's your favorite, what's the regular, you know, the best burger in town?
That guy, I know you think that I have some kind of obsession.
And I do, only in the sense that I don't understand how he's on the air.
Futsi.
I mean, I understand that, you know, all of us, even if we've been in the business a hundred years,
not everybody's like Rick Shaw and has 50 million dollars put away or whatever he's read.
We can't afford to retire, because some of us have a lot of mouse to feed.
What's the rest of the programming around him? Is any of it local?
Well, what do you mean by that?
Iod is got rush after here.
From where do they got Dave Lamont farting the news?
And after rush, I don't know what they got.
What's his name?
Rush Jr.
The wannabe Tom, like us?
No, not Tom, like us.
What does that guy's name?
It's been so long since I heard anything about him.
What the hell is his name?
He's another right-wing, syndicated guy?
Right.
Of course.
That's Chief Jailman, open up a pot and throw some crap on me there.
Tom, I don't know what his name is, somebody will play.
Joy.
No, not Tom, Joyner.
He's like a fly job.
I was working, the fly job.
Yeah, yeah.
Tom, Joyner, my ass.
Okay, so the pull is which one are you?
It's our ethnic survey.
And it's very...
See, the audience may think this isn't very sexy because it's not an opinion pull.
So, that's not that exciting.
But it's interesting only from the standpoint of we know for sure that since we took this pull before,
which was what, may of 2000, 2000.
So almost exactly eight years ago.
We know that during that period of time, the show...
I mean, the show is so much different than we could actually do things.
It was the near Roger show.
Now it's just a shell.
In fact, the only...
I would say the only connection between then and now is that you and I are here.
Right.
You know what I mean?
And that's the only constant.
Right.
Other than that, there's nothing the same.
We can't say anything, we can't play anything, we can't...
Right.
And then I read all these bedtime stories, as opposed to...
Well, my router showed up last night.
Yeah, George and I are going to work probably tomorrow morning.
Before the show.
You got it.
Because the one thing I do know is I can get my internet back even if I can't hook up the router.
Correct.
I went into a panic last night because I tried huking the router up, I couldn't get it to work.
And then I thought, well, I just took my modem directly into the computer again and get the internet back up.
And the first time I didn't work, I thought, oh no!
How am I going to survive without the internet?
Right?
Right on.
Well, talk about becoming dependent overnight on something.
But the second time I got it, it's working just fine.
Thank God.
Thank...
Deal, God!
Okay, which one are you?
And we asked for your ethnic background.
Now, the first time we did this, the eight years ago, we had a 2067 vote.
And we got now about half.
What do we got?
1047.
So about half.
So, if you double these numbers, that would tell you how many we have in the ethnic.
So, we're starting to say we know that during that eight years, we've lost a gigantic portion of the audience.
And of course, Joyce and the FCC and Jolly Joe, they're all...
They're responsible because, you know, they've limited what we can do on a show until we do the best we can
and take the checks, which starting next year will be...
Well, which one are you?
Non-Hispanic white, of course.
747.
Nothing like flying in the upper deck of a 747, George.
All right.
Really nifty.
Or even in the lower deck.
A bit of the lower deck.
In business class.
You haven't got any boys up, man.
They'll have it.
Were you like in cattle class?
You know it.
Not good.
72.2%.
Now, back the first time, see it's always interesting to compare, it was 64.6%.
So, we got a lot more white folks percentage-wise.
Cuban, first time we've done it, we had 8.6%.
Now, it's 8.8%.
And 91 now, it was 178.
So, if you double 91, that's 182.
So, that's pretty much the same.
Thank God for the, for our Cuban listeners out there, the ones who are, you know, not
come on East out, come on East out, not that old crowd, that old QBA, a radio mom B-Crow,
it's screaming about Fidel all day long like a bunch of idiots.
Other 51, other Hispanic 31, African American 26, what we have the first time, 46.
So, we actually picked up there a little bit, I think.
Because if you double 26, you got 52.
You follow these numbers.
A lot of numbers.
Get your Crayolos out.
Reacon, Porto Recon 13.
That's way down.
Native American 12, way down.
Haitian 12, way down.
You're making 9, way down.
Middle Eastern, we didn't do that the first time.
8.
Colombian 7, way down.
We have 44 the first time.
Other Asian 6.
We had 21, that's down a little bit.
Japanese 6, that's-
That's back!
But same.
Chinese, or is our Chinese mon mon?
Where's all our Chinese mon?
We only have 6.
And the first time we done, we had 68.
Where have all the Chinese gone?
Well, what is that all about?
How's the Chinese mon mon?
And I'm always saying these nice things about the Chinese guys,
about how hot they are, and-
Which is-
Maybe that's why.
Maybe that's why they ran off.
No, I don't think so.
You scared them.
Brazilian, now this is the relay.
We had 86 the first time we did the pull, now we got 4.
So, we have level 4, what do you got?
8.
Brazilians, I think that's where the problem is.
Maybe because you keep talking about Brazil, where the men are men,
and so are the women?
That's not me that says it.
Oh, that's right.
Nicaragua in 3, Nicaragua, we had 22, so that's why.
Now, in Mexicans only 2 now, we had 19.
So, we've lost our ethnic people.
It looks like to me.
I don't know that the Anglo and the Cuban seems to be pretty constant, right?
But where do all the ethnic's go, huh?
You got me.
What do you think, Chris?
Where did all the ethnic's go, huh?
I have no idea.
Especially the Chinese man.
Boy, there is nothing in a world like a, like about a 20-year-old Chinese Canadian young
man with glasses, real bright look, and you know.
I'm sure that's a matter of perspective, smooth skin.
I think you're pardoned?
I said how's it going, eh?
One thing you don't find is hairy Asians.
Have you ever found a hairy Asian guy?
How about a hairy Asian woman?
No, I have not.
How about hairy reams?
What about him, he's Asian?

You don't want to levels out.
They stop.
That means the whole audience is already that is able to vote on there.
The Arigers.com, by the way, for those who are wondering where we keep reading these polls from,
like all you ethnic South are no speaking English.
All you Chinese mind.
Come on.
Let's get a few Chinese men on me.
I'm the Arigers.

Huh?

Okay.
I'll pick it up and look at it, then.
Can you come to talk to the boss?
I have two things to do.
Okay, 10.33.
I think I should do it.
I think I should get a whole bunch of Chinese models.
Oh, hold on.
We only got six.
That's the thing that's so disheartening to me.
I mean, somebody would probably say,
You know somebody in the right mind would say well what difference is it make what the ethnic composition is if you want
If you have the same number of people listening someone might say that yeah, but the point is we obviously don't
Right we have the same percentage of anglos and Cubans and other NAD and
African-Americans dark folks real dark, but other than that
I mean every every other demographic is like vanished. Huh?
They've abandoned us. They're you feel like an abandoned stepchild. I feel really bad. No, I don't
Pennsylvania primary is on by the way voting stops at eight tonight
Beautiful day there the weather is great. There's no excuses all you college kids in Pennsylvania vote 10 times today, please
Well college kids, you know, they know how to pull off all these pranks
Yep
So 1103 on your poll Chris is really excited about that not
all good
Now what's this back? Oh boy?
This is good because I mean I've got a huge pile of stuff here, but I don't this is a little white
I don't know that I can what right hearted fair. Yeah, lighthearted fair especially after my experience last night
At least I didn't have any experience in my pants
That's good although my stomach man. I'm gonna tell you I thought my kishkeys were gonna explode
I was that what I'm missing those contrabs and there and I didn't realize it
Even though I've had many sorbitol experiences, but this was way beyond that when you're only supposed to have two at a
weight 24
And of course when you have too much vitamin C that roll that'll do it that'll flush your system
Now I wonder about the bleep in this thing cuz I
Yeah, that's a good bleep
I did I should hope so oh I'm sorry to want to Rebecca to think I'll take my time. Shnit is who's on three?
Oh that guy I looked it up cuz I forgot
That's easy for me is Schmidt and so is the show is Schmidt
A hospital did nothing wrong with it tried to examine the rectum of a construction worker
Brackum would be hit on the head by a falling wooden beam a jury found Monday
After deliberating for about an hour a state supreme court jury awarded nothing to Brian Persol who soon near our
Presbyterian hospital for unspecified damages the panel found the hospital and some urgency were medical staff were not liable
I'm gonna be doing a lot of that
But that's where it goes
I just showed up. I just blew my nose for a sympathy. Oh for those lawyers
Gerard Marone Marone and Gary D. Filippo said he might appeal Marone
We're very disappointed Marone said after two weeks. I'll say miscarriage of justice. I'm gonna sneeze in a second
Okay, that's another thing. I've been sneezing man. I'm and I never do that. You want to have a cool. I don't sneeze a million times today
I'm gonna uh-oh
He
Oh
What is it like?
This is great radio. It's it's not as compelling as what's your favorite hamburger?
But then what is nothing the hospitals lawyer Jeffrey Lawton declined comment
Marone said Prasol 38 was injured while working at a construction site in Midtown Manhattan made 20th 2003
Prasol received eight stitches for cut-overs
Eyebrow to hospital, but tonight emergency room staffers request to examine his
The lawyer said he said doctors told Prasol the examin up determined whether the accident caused final damage
He even got nobody knows and around and then asked
When Prasol resisted staffers held him down while he begged please don't do that
Marone said
Look at your prison there in the world. No, no, no, I'm not oh my god
You can enjoy him and oh
Not an a-hole man. What a jerk
And and they're yuking it up there on CNN
Oh
Thank you, Mr
President for those low gas prices for all the dead people in the end of the economy. Thank you
Hospital witnesses testified at the trial that the exam was never completed
But Marone said that when Prasol woke up he was handcuffed to a bed had an oxygen
You down his throat and lubricant in his
Wow kind of an exam is that
He resisted because he didn't know what they were doing defilepro said once he said he didn't want the director of Sam everything should have stopped
Deep Felipe says he believes director of Sam was done as retaliation because his panic client hit the doctor
A judge dismissed an estimate of assault charge
I was filed against for so because he hit the doctor, but he hit the doctor for
Deep Felipe said his client is unemployed, but unable hold a job since the accident
See your foot by a couple of drinks see
First oh the doctor the patient
Disposable by the patient a couple drinks. Yeah, then maybe wouldn't have gotten hit how about he would have given him some cough drops
Then they wouldn't have gone anywhere near him. Oh, they hit the road fast
It's still got only six Chinese mom that that's the only demo on there that I
Concentrating on now till we improve from six mm-hmm
I mean a reaches a point where you realize that that's that's it
You know what I mean right and eight years ago we had how many do we have
78
The 68 whatever that's 68 and now we got six
That's enough to make me fart right in this chair. Oh, I just did oh geez. Well, at least we didn't hear it
Well, I'm sure that
This chair is very old. I put this thing together way back in the beginning when I came here when Bob removed left me without a real chair here
So he's no longer with us Bob removed so I can say what an a hole is on here without them getting all upset what you did before when he was with
She's a he's an idiot
What he didn't answer them with that studio there? I wouldn't wish on Heinrich Kimmer
That's the kind of job he did there and just left a mess for the Amsterdam engineer remember those days yep
Remember that I tried to put a call on you and rumor called in right of all people
Oh
It's that sounded like it was under the Atlantic like on a cable underneath the Atlantic that leaky basement or something
Yeah, the pipes leaky but moldy in fact back in that day I felt like this every day because it was an unsanitary
That's what I'm thinking about Amsterdam
Is that most of the people that own real estate and ran out places are crooks?
their thieves they overcharge especially for an American and the places are unsanitary and clammy and
horrendous I see
Like my lawyer my blame Lord Peter douchebag
I had owned eight buildings. He's collecting rent from a zillion different people. Okay had more money than God
And he was wearing an old coat that looked like he got it from goodwill and I in a dumpster somewhere
But a haircut that looked like carrot top huh on a bad day the Peter douchebag
Who was introduced to me by the way hooked up with me or recall who pulled me in touch with him for my great apartment?
I'll go steam
So I you know I wish you the best but let me say this
What comes around goes around I think the Lord is punishing him for what he did to me I
Like hello, mm-hmm. I don't like too many people of course the audience is thinking that I like hell
He's down and out. I think Ryan Jeremy ought to pay all his bailouts
Help him out. I don't know if Ryan's really making any money. Maybe Ryan is helping him out
I don't know and so one good thing is I never got close enough to Alfred
I'd like to call me and say oh gee could you help me? I'm dying over here. I need some money. I'm going on the street
Like that. Yeah
My all it wasn't Catholic when I knew he might be
Well, he could be converted they didn't have to him at my confirmed anything
Wait where they served food during their services. So he might even go straight again. I don't know
1118 on the pool. We need the 3000 votes. Do you think we could ever do that? Sure, sure leave it on there long enough of course he could
Well, that's because you're assuming we have 3000 people listening
Yeah, I know we still have six Chinese
I'm sorry. Maybe if you played I like Chinese
We just have a Chinese campaign day
I like that. I don't have that. I don't think I have it in here either
I might have it in the country under working spud. I don't know
Maybe we have Rick Riley doing the um
Stock reports that will get on like tiny. I don't have the world today. See how it in the computer I
Did download it?
The
Well
I was shopping at the store for some food
Buy and groceries never felt so good
Too bad I didn't know my credit was wax store security was breached in the database
I see R8 me that spells me my credit is crap dot com baby
I'm as good as I can be thought about killing myself maybe now instead of eating good and getting fat
My identity was going down my life is just crap
See R8 me that spells me my credit is crap dot com baby 1046 at 560 WQ and I'm a little under the weather
But nevertheless we we prod prod long pod prod prod
1127 on Chris's survey. He's real
This is sad sad. Yeah, we're losing all these people. Oh, that's true
And we can't get even one more Chinese monitor Chinese lady or Chinese anybody
Maybe that expression Chinese mind. Maybe that's derogatory. I hope not
Because I was one we are if we find one let's ask one
If we find another Chinese mom. Yes, I don't think there's anything wrong with that Chinese mom
I think it's funny my
K. Lysby and he's cab driver came up with that. He's got he's got a derogatory term for everybody. Well, that's gonna be oh
Yeah, he's a big it. He hates Jews to it doesn't know I'm Jewish
What are you gonna tell him? I'm not gonna. We're a big old star David
That was like the where they don't try that would be a bad idea
He might just dump my ass out, but nevertheless
He was well, he was telling me that it's Passover. I
Think you're wrong. I think Passover was on for several days. I could be wrong about that
Well, do tell us I mean Hanukkah goes on for a bunch of days eight days and
Pesach goes on I'm sure for what do you mean? Do tell us I don't know
You ought to know that crap
On this schedule says it starts on Saturday
Yeah, and it says Passover on Sunday and it doesn't say Passover any other day
So what does that mean? Well, by the way speaking of the date what day is May 2nd Friday? It's that's that's what we're gonna be a Gulf Stream by the way
All this Friday, Dave Johnson is calling the next one
What next Friday is May 2nd, right? Correct
They have a book of the day the book comes out. Wow big day that day then. Yeah, we already read the
The book comes out 10 a.m. Dave Johnson will be calling around noon right? I'll be a real Gulf Stream
betting on calder I guess I don't know maybe we've been on Dave Falon at one to five at the medows. I don't know
I don't like that he won eleven races yesterday. You don't seem to care
No, even a puss like you that doesn't care about racing. I mean you ought to appreciate the the
Just incredible eight second third quarter battle both flexes laid down all the speed
Pacific Prince is coming on Pacific Prince or both likes through the stretch drive both like
He's getting in and holding a lead of a length of a half up to the wire. He raised Frank Salive in Western fairway sway
What a joke? Well, he lives there you know, so he got tired of driving the woodbine in Mohawk and that
Frank Salive the track announcer
You I'm trying to give you an education about all these racing things because that's gonna be your new
I mean it's part of your new contract. I I like it
Jolly Joe says that half of you he's giving a big increase, but it all has to come from winnings a Gulf Stream
Okay, so I was gonna come somewhere. I'll take it
I'm reading up on paysock by the way and last for seven days. I told you that
Eight days outside of Israel
Wow eight days. It's a long holiday man when you buy all those boxes of Matsu
You think it's you just leave it around to get stale for next year for Christ's sake
Not for his sake paysock man. It's going on right now for maybe that's what the Chinese Chinese monarchy on our pool because they're celebrating their eating Matsu
You think how about I wonder if pony tells to about his Matsu pizza. We never heard anything about that see rather to loop with everything
And that's because that sales department is just really kicking as they've rejiggered the whole approach to the show not
Next time you see Brian Schmutz kick him in the groin. He is such an a-hole. All right. If I can kick that high
He's needed to be a rock at he's pretty tall. I
Just a penis. Hey
There was a guy. He's what was his real name?
Hennesse or John John penis. Oh, Hennesse. Yeah, we've just come John penis. It was a crazy person
But he was a crazy guy, but he was a so of course he was a sales guy right but when we first came to QM
He loved the show. He sold the show like crazy. What a zeal
And for me it accounts to I mean, I just do some place where the salad was he cared he served the accounts to he
He's always the best copy without belly aching about it
He was a good guy and then he gave candy left. I don't know one way or another he didn't fit in here
You know he departed. Yeah, he was doing too good of a job with the show
And we could sure use somebody like that back. I mean we got Duff. We got wait
That's you know, he's busy selling the golf clubs that you're peeing hey
I can't wait for that spot to start me either
He's starting early. Don't my bow to true story
Well, when you're out there on the list man, you can't just whip it out and pee on that off course
Although let me ask you this how have you whip it out and pee in your golf club?
I'll do the thing it has a privacy towel
It has a privacy towel you didn't read the spot I
Was fascinated by it. I'm thinking of taking up golf just so I can use that thing
Yeah, but who's gonna supply the balls? Oh God, I'm sure
Please take it back up. You know as much as I'm wailing and carrying out about this whole thing with a churning monitor
That's it. That's what we got six
I think you ought to take this survey when we finish it finally
Mm-hmm and stick it under Jolly
But tape it to his door and say look what you people have done to us
I mean, I don't know as we signed a new deal now got five and two thirds years left. So
What turns is make right?
But obviously the tiny money one here fart sounds
And sort of the Brazilians and Nicaragua is in the Mexicans especially
Make some feel like they're at home. I think they hear them all the time don't they? Japanese
Colombians Colombians want to hear fart sounds
Who doesn't do makins mine when you're smoking a big fact split you want to hear somebody cut in a big one man
And Haitians of course I don't know Haitians 14. What do we have the first time only?
12 now that's interesting. We're way ahead pick up the nation on our Haitians and
Reekens we only had 13 the first time and now we got 14
Ooh
Native American. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I'm reading. It's the same pool
Careful not good now. What was I getting excited about oh, hey?
483 and I only got 14 now we're we're down and every ethnic category except for whites and Cubans not Hispanic white and Cubans every other demographic
War way down
African American 29 the first time 46. I guess we're a little bit of heat there
And
Those people can't stand all the numbers you better start getting some Crayolas for the show every day right now
Get like a big crap a scrapbook. Mm-hmm. I write and all these things I'll let you be a pretty interesting someday after I croak soon
Six Chinese man
Don't you find that
Unspeakable almost not in speakable. That's what I'd say unusual. Where do they go?
They didn't go back to China what to eat all those horrible animals those
Varma's of all the economic economic opportunities going on over there as opposed to here
Maybe they couldn't stand the way that the white people smell that you know that's a good point
See I tried to explain that a long time ago and people all shot me down on it. Oh, you're wrong. No, it's a bad hygiene
I don't think that's it. I think it's a dietary that you're in your I think it's in your system
It's a little bit of both different ethnicity smell different especially to each other. Yeah to other ethnicities. That is correct
And some people you know if they never get close to a bar of soap or isn't a little body wash
We want some might help that might improve that a little bit. Yeah, I'd make for better relations
Well, I'm pretty a morocin depressed
It wasn't bad enough that I had that really sick. They yesterday
I couldn't hook up my router last night and I just sliced the crap out of my hand to the elevator that I didn't mention that
No, you didn't let me take a look at it. Let me pull the band-aid. Oh my god. Oh
Wow, it's like gray on top of the
Do I mean great? It means infection doesn't it? That's fairly just means you die on it all just what just means you're dying. Yeah, you're ashen
Yeah, there's idiot comes out of the elevator. There's old cout and you can see I'm getting on there
I've got my box with the router on which way to about a half an ounce very lightweight
And I'm getting any elevator and instead like holding it there for he just slips right out of there
Now usually the elevators of my building if you it's they've got very good sensors
Right and so if you stick a foot in there or hand they automatically open right back up
This one didn't do it. Huh
And it slammed right on my hand in the box in the whole day. I just cut the crap on it. I'm gonna kill you hand it
And then it reopened and I thought to myself. Oh gee. Thanks a lot you bastards
Support for Barack Obama's nomination bit has rebounded among national Democratic voters as the Gallup poor
Who now favor him over a salary by seven points nationally? This is 49 to 42 percent they're voting in Pennsylvania
This is the first time Obama's had a statistically significant advantage over Clinton since the risk left into it that he last week
Prior to that Obama was enjoying his longest
Frontwater streak since the start of the Gallup Daily track and pull the January and we'll sneeze again
They need me during the break. Uh, what do you need to know this?
Balls and idiots sitting on the tree
Waiting what was that more money five on that's how I like Chinese stuff
Today's results from Gallup poor daily track conducted April 18 to 20 show Obama doing quite well in the last days of pulling
Suggesting the latest defuulities traveling his campaign largely stemming from the April 16 so-called the beta Philadelphia and the ensuing media coverage are subsiding
Gallup Daily poll friends suggest swallowing may have received a short-term Bruce Nier standing after the Philadelphia debate
But she's been unable to sustain those gains now the focus shifts to today's Pennsylvania primary
They Gallup Daily tracking poll shows no change from Sunday's report in the national voter preferences for Obama versus McCain and a
hypothetical match up they remain tied at 45 a piece
McCain's one point ahead of swallowing 46 45
How do you like that the fact that McCain is even close should soot scare you enough to make you crawl under the bed and just stay there until you die
This is the Neil Roger show
This is your brain

Brittany spears joins David Karuso on an all-new CSI Miami
So Britney what a way god
It looks like that the serial killer
Don't wait until the murder victim all I can say is
Oops he did it again
It's Britney as you've never seen her before in the most toxic CSI Miami yet.
Oh my gosh! Hey! Look at all these multiple contusions on the baby fam, right?
Hmm. I guess he won't be saying. Hit me baby one more time.
You've been saying, give me, give me more and CBS has answered.
Whitney Spears, guest eyes on CSI Miami.
That's for you Britney. It's 11.02 at 5.16 W.C. and Blast, gross and disgusting.
What's that? The good news is we got 7 Chinese money out now.
We went up, oh we went up one, you found one.
Are you excited? Okay.
You just don't care about your Chinese money. That's your...
I don't like you do, no. I think Rebecca was right.
I care about my Japanese woman more. Do you?
Yeah. Well that puts a different slam online.
Sure does. Which is an interesting... I don't want to go into it.
You don't have to go into it. I don't want to go there.
And Tsar. And now you have to decide who would you hire?
And you, honey, foam resistance. You'll be ducking a sniper fire.
It is so... I don't know. Polls are open in Pennsylvania and come see Kamsa.
Who knows what's going to happen?
For minimal adversary and she has many good ideas, in fact,
we share a lot of ideas. We share a lot of policy positions.
But the reason I'm running is because I believe that I am more committed.
It's a bringing about the changes that are necessary that Senator Clinton is.
Yeah, she wants to bomb, bomb, bomb. She said that we could bomb Iran in the Stone Age.
Maybe I'll get to it. If I can read that much today.
Here's the sirens. I could open the window. Lots of Iran here.
The only reason I don't want to open the window is because I think that it's letting the polluted air in,
which I think is contributed to my... Like that.
Better do here the sirens now.
Do you hear them?
Uh-huh.
Wow.
Wow. It's right. Lauderd Lauderd. It is right outside.
When you live in a big city man that goes on all days...
Although it's only the last year or four months that I've noticed it as much.
I mean, I've been here for six and a half years.
And for whatever reason, it's only the last three months or so that I've noticed it just never stops.
That's because there's five million people here.
And there's people dying and people getting hit and run over and smashed up and fainting and having strokes and attack.
Because the Lord works in mysterious ways, you know.
We could have been invulnerable like stupid man.
That's one thing about Batman and Robin. They didn't have no supernatural powers.
Nope.
Well, I was kind of sad.
They just had to have...
I mean, that was the whole idea is that so they'd common man can have a game.
They'd have to have a whole idea was...
Yeah.
If you ask what he's saying.
Well, not if he asked Bob Kane.
Who?
The guy that invented the story.
Oh, of course. What's he gonna say?
On his deathbed.
He's gay.
That's a swishful fantasy on the party you fagot.
Oh, he's reading all that stuff into it.
Right.
Shame on you.
Uh-huh.
Trying to sell the image of a wholesome family-oriented comic book.
How can a wholesome and family-oriented were they wearing those tights that you could see with their religion?
It was just worn out.
I was telling you what the man said.
Dave Palo and Drone 11 winners on the Meadow is 14 race car.
Yesterday, the most victories ever by a driver on a single-per-mutual race-way car.
I know that nobody cares about this, but I do.
What is it?
One other...
What?
It is something.
There's no question.
It's an amazing accomplishment.
I know Dave.
Once upon a time, many years ago, my late friend, Alan J. Finkelson, brought Dave Palo
up because I was trying to talk him into coming to Pompa no Park to drive.
Because he was great then and he's still great.
And he sat at the table with me in fact, Richard, for quite a while.
He's a great guy.
Only one other driver, Roger Hamers, one of the races on a single-car to compensate his
feet at the York, Pennsylvania Fair September 9, 2000, tree.
Well, who cares about some County-S Fair, Roger?
Palo and also set the record for most two-minute victories on a single-car with 11, eclipsing
the previous mark of 10 hell-joyedly with Greg Grisborg and Walter K. Jr.
I wonder if Walter ever got out of jail.
Palo and seven consecutive wins fell one-short of the record that category held by Steph
on Bouchard, Frog.
Palo and Ranks threw it all time in driving wins had twice before probably 10 winners on
a card.
In addition to Grisborg and K. S. Brett Miller and David Miller scored 10 victories on a single
car, but not Andy Miller, not yet.
And not even Brian Sears, and not even Ronnie Pierce, and not even Joe Mars Jr. and not even
Brad Kramer.
Not that I put him in the same category, but nevertheless, that'd be a good pull to
take, who's your favorite hunger-striver driver of all time?
Let's do it.
Wally had a seat.
Wally had a seat, not a bad choice.
Hey, how's it going?
Wally, how's it going?
Well, they're sure sticking to those horsemen of pomp at them, eh?
They sure screwed that thing up big time.
I mean, I know it's Florida, but how is it possible to screw up everything that you
do?
And that's a Florida.
Florida.
That's our way.
We have days.
Every place else, there's slots have been a really great boon in places like Delaware,
Dover, Dowsen, Harrington.
Purses are way up, and they're raking in money, hand over fist, woodbind, mohawk, anywhere.
Not in Florida.
Everything in Florida is a disaster.
We got eight Chinese men.
So I put out all that energy.
We got a couple of Chinese men.
Oh, you know something, if I get one Chinese man, although I, not today, I don't think I
want to get too close and personal with anybody when I feel like this.
Oh, and give them whatever I got.
No, you don't want to be that giving.
No, I'm a giving person.
I know, but some things you, you know, people don't want to get.
And sometimes I just want to take, like Joey Zaza said, if you don't want to give, I
will take.
I thought we could reason together.
Michael, let me talk to him.
I was such a scene.
That scene performing, uh-huh, by Eli Wallach and Godfather III.
He made Sophie a copula, seemed like a man and bankrupt.
Right.
That's how bad Eli Wallach was.
And I never noticed it.
Oh, the only way.
Yeah, like it's a big surprise.
I've seen other movies all in a sense, you know, and I didn't realize that he was such
a bad actor in all these movies.
Speaking of bad actors.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
He's a voter or something.
Oh, my God.
He is so far over the top that it's just it's nauseous.
Careful in them coming out.
And he's flailing the arms again and he's emoting and putting on all this fake crap.
He just, I don't know.
He must know somebody.
I agree.
1155 on the survey.
Chris, what's your take?
I think we go for like a 5,000.
Careful.
That's if everybody knows both twice.
I mean, you're not supposed to say these things, but let's be honest about it.
We know it.
We can feel it.
We can smell it.
We can taste it.
We can sense it.
It's there in the numbers in a month after month.
I mean, sure, we got a kiss in the fall book.
That was nice.
Got some bonus money.
I don't think that'll be happening with this winner book.
Unless we have a humongous march.
Gigantic.
And is there anything to believe we're going to have a humongous march?
No.
You don't have to answer.
It was a rhetorical call.
Oh, OK.
I was just taking a breath.
Which one are you?
Non-Hispanic white, 833, 72.1%.
That's up almost 8% from the first time we did a say years ago.
A lot of white people.
Not to disantying wrong with white people.
Cubans, 103, who are white, but not non-Hispan.
What depends on who?
103, 8.9%.
Well, there are black Cubans.
And there's Jewish Cubans and Chinese Cubans.
And all of our Chinese Cubans.
How can there be Cubans of every stripe?
How can there be Cuban Chinese?
There are many Chinese Cubans.
Yeah.
A lot of Chinese.
How was that possible?
A lot of Chinese.
How can you be Chinese and Cuban?
A lot of Chinese words and English.
How can you be Jewish and Cuban?
How can you be a...
There is a religion.
Yeah, but it's an ethnicity with a country and a language
and a culture.
No, yeah?
That's what the Pope said.
I can't believe he went to shul and had the Passover
say it over again.
I can't believe he let him.
That was ridiculous.
Yeah, they shouldn't let him in.
They should have said, listen, you old Getski, you far
bison get out of here.
Go back to the camp.
Go back to the camps.
Go back and burn some Jews in Europe.
Get out of here.
Other Hispanic 33, African-American 29, Native American 15.
Puerto Rican 15, Haitian 14, Middle Eastern 9, Jamaican 9.
How many Jamaicans we have first time?
32.
Oh.
We're sucking wind in me.
Jamaican community, man.
I think all of your contacts are going down the tubes.
I don't have any.
I have my y'all.
Jamaican best friend.
By the way, he's the straightest, most uptight person that you've
ever met in your life.
Really?
Yes.
Let's see uptight about everything.
You name it.
Other Asian 8, Chinese 8, Colombian 8, Japanese 6, Brazilian only 5.
We had 86, 8 years ago.
And now in about half the votes we have 5.
Oh my God.
Brazilians.
Nicaraguan 3 and Mexicans sucking wind in last place only 2.
They figure out enough Mexicans here.
The feed.
Yeah.
Well, I guess that's what they're figuring because we've only got 2 on there.
They're in last place.
Well, they're busy picking, you know, produce.
No, not picking cotton.
Mexicans don't pick cotton.
How do you know?
What do you say?
I don't know.
I don't think so anymore.
I know some cotton picking Mexicans, but that's the seedable sense.
I think they have a lot of the sector level at 560 WMI.
And if I sound like I'm in slow mode today because I feel like I'm in slow mode and just
you know, it sounds like you're in a home mode today.
The home mode is in slow mode, okay?
So just bear with me or or not or turn on Pitsy and hear about the best hamburger in
the world.

If you live in Pennsylvania, can you do me a favor?
Will you please cast my vote in yours on Tuesday for Senator Barack Obama?
I haven't spoken publicly till now as to who I would vote for.
Primarily for two reasons.
One, who cares?
And two most people I know don't keep a rat's ass whose name is on a ballot in November.
As long as there's a picture of JFK and FDR writing a donkey at the top of the ballot.
And the word democratic next to the candidate's name.
Seriously, I know so many people that don't care if they name under big D is dancer,
dancer Clinton or Blitzen.
It can be Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Barry Obama or Dalulama.
Well, that sounded good last year, but over the past two months the actions of words of
Soror would have gone from being merely disappointing to downright disgusting.
I guess the debate last week was the final straw.
I've asked Senator Clinton or husband to play this game of opinion to the worst side of white people.
The last ones they went, she hurled the name of Farrakhan out of nowhere.
Well, that's when the silly season came to an early end for me.
She said the F word to scare white people if you're in simple.
Of course, Obama's got no connection to Farrakhan, but according to Soror, Obama's past
who does, and the church bulletin once included in LA Times Out Bed from some guy with Hamas,
known off the church bulletin.
This lazy attempt to smear Obama was brilliantly explained the following night by Stephen Colbert.
He put it out that if Obama supported by Ted Kennedy, who's Catholic,
and the Catholic church is led by a pope who was in Hitler youth, that could only mean one thing.
Obama loves Hitler.
Yes, Senator Soror, that's how you sounded like you were nuts.
Like you were a bigot stoking the fires of stupidity.
How sad that I will ever have to write those words about you.
You've devoted your life to good causes and good deeds, and I'll throw it all away for an office you can't win,
unless you smear the black man so much that the super-duller gets quite uncle-time and give it all to you.
But that can't happen.
You cast your die when you voted to start this bloody war.
When you did that, you were like Moses who lost it for a moment, because of that,
was prohibited from entering the Promised Land.
How sad for a country that wanted to see the first one elected to the White House.
That table will come, but it won't be you.
We'll have to wait for the current Democratic governor of Kansas to run in 2016.
There are those who say Obama isn't ready, or he's voted wrong on this or that,
but that's looking at the trees and not the forest.
What we're witnessing is not just a candidate, but if we're found massive public movement, ready for change.
My endorsement is more for Obama the movement that it is for Obama the candidate.
That isn't to take anything away from this exceptional man.
What's going on is bigger than him at this point, and that's a good thing for the country.
Because when he wins in November, that Obama moon is going to have to stay alert and alive.
Separate America is not going to give up.
Corporate America is not going to give up their hold on the government just because we say so.
President Obama is going to need a nation of millions to stand behind him.
I know some of you will say Mike, what have the Democrats done deserve our vote?
That's an angry question.
November of 2006, the country loudly sent a message we wanted to end the war, yet Democrats had done nothing.
So why should we be so eager to land up happily behind them?
I'll tell you why.
Because I can't stand one more friggin' minute of this administration than the permanent irreversible damage it's under our people in this world.
I'm almost a depot right now, careful that Democrats don't have a backbone or a knee bone or a thought in their dizzy little heads.
Just as long as they name Ain't Bush, and the word Republican isn't be h-side there's on a belt and that's good enough for me.
I like the majority of Americans have been pummeled senseless for eight long years.
That's why I joined millions of citizens in staggering the voting both come November, like a boxer in the twelfth round, all bloodied and bruised with one eye swollen shut, looking for the only thing that matters, the big D on the ballot.
Don't get me wrong, I lost my rose-colored glasses a long time ago.
It's foolish to see Democrats as anything but a nicer version of a party that existed to the bidding of the corporate elite in this country.
Any endorsement of a Democrat must be done with this acknowledgement and I hope that one day we'll have a party that represents the people first and laws that allow that party in equal voice.
Finally, I wanted to say a word about the basic decency I see to Mr. Obama. Mrs. Clinton continues to throw the reverend right up in his face as part of her mission to keep soaking the fears of white America.
Every time she does this I shout out to TV, say it Obama, say that when she and her husband were having marital difficulties regarding Monica Lewinsky, who did she and Bill bring to the White House for a spiritual counseling, the reverend Jeremiah right?
But no Obama won't throw that at her, it wouldn't be right, it wouldn't be decent. She's been through enough hurt, and so he remains silent and takes the much he throws in his face.
That's why the crowds have come to see him are so large, that's why he'll take us down a more decent path, that's why we vote for him in Michigan if I were allowed to have an election.
But the question I keep hearing is, can he win, can he win in November?
In the distance we hear the siren of death train called the Strait Talk Express. We know it's possible to hear the words President McCain on January 20th.
We know there are still many Americans who will never vote for a black man, Hillary knows it too, she's counting on it.
Pennsylvania, the state that gave birth to this great country as a chance to set things right, it hasn't had a moment to shine like this in 1787, when our constitution was written there.
In that constitution they wrote that a black man or woman was only three fifths human. On Tuesday the good people of Pennsylvania have chance for redemption.
So it's fat Michael Moore, how do you go on Mike?
Oh he's not there.
How do you go on?
Yeah, right.
But nevertheless.
Hey listen, I'm clearing out my analysis.
You got it.
I'm trying to do a respectable show here today with all this mung in my nose.
I sure wish I could have another one in Los Angeles because my insides aren't churning yet.
You think a second one might have no other art or experiment.
I don't want to do too much experimentation, it's only about 1130, okay?
In addition, which I'll have to go in the other room and open the other sack.
They're all gone from this.
They're just where it then you want them to get up.
And once they're gone.
Nine Chinese is all we got, nine Chinese.
And Brazilian only five.
Where have all the ethnic strong, well the ethnic like farting are isn't a funny bit so I guess.
Who stuff are we against?
That I understand that.
But evidently these are the things that I talk about and these stories like the one I just read by Michael Moore there,
which I would think most people were interested in the election and what's happening in this country in the world
and are pissed off about four dollars a gallon of gas and all the dead people in Iraq and the billions and trillions of dollars
that were peeing down the toilet there in Iraq.
People were not too happy about these things.
But maybe if you're like from Brazil, you don't care about that.
Maybe all you care about is like carny-volumes, stuff like that.
A dressigan drain.
I don't know.
A fast challenge.
You're just in the logic.
We're like the five sixty QAM.
The fourth leader.
The butt, honey.
Oh right.
Welcome.
This is all around me.
Everybody is broke.
The economy is drowning.
They got us by the road.
I factored you some driving.
But you're the fourth.
The fourth leader.
The fourth leader.
The fourth leader.
The fourth leader.
The fourth leader.
The fourth leader.
The fourth leader.
The fourth leader.
The fourth leader.
The fourth leader.
The fourth leader.
The fourth leader.
The fourth leader.
The fourth leader.
The fourth leader.
The fourth leader.
The fourth leader.
The fourth leader.
The fourth leader.
Every little breath.
Just the little rhythm.
Just the little rhythm.
chts.
ания.
The fourth city.
The fourth midfield river.
The fourth one.
The third외la.
The fourth identify los crumble.
The fourth sawp.
They got us blind and now we're kind of just following
We're in the heat of pressure but they don't want you to know
For the world which is country is depression, though
I want to make this paper good because we have this depression, though
I want Hillary Clinton to win battles like these women that I thought of
Oh my god, the world is coming to an end, Rick Sanchez is on the human
1133 and then of course the Tony Snow and then after that it will be a Howard Beale
Well they're not given any information on what's happening
They saw I went to the Philadelphia inquire.com
Okay
And sure enough, I mean wouldn't you think it would be more important than
Showing Rick Sanchez interviewing a bunch of old bags
Haha
Well he's actually a forget about it right now look at that
No, she looks like Mathuiseless grandma
The median age there is death plus 40. I can do it
The polls are open will it be Obama or Clinton?
Sam Woodass he's added Philadelphia inquire staff writer
Turn out if the Pennsylvania polls expected to shatter all
Previous records as voters cast a balance into these primary elections
And you know who's going to be voting today all those college students are our first time voters
Let's hope
This is going to be crazy today said Laurie Wester a campaign worker setting up at 6 this morning
Outside the polls at masterman high school at 17th and spring garden streets
It's going to be very busy westler democratic committee person said there's a lot of interesting races
Aha
A near perfect spring day is on tap across the keystone state with mostly sunny skies and temperatures
Nor 70s and both, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh no rain is expected anywhere
Across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
How do you like that the Lord is looking around and he's looking at Hillary and he's going like
Like that
We're voting for a good day said meteorologist Patrick O'Hare of the National Weather Service
In the Philadelphia region some morning clouds will be chased away by a light breeze
O'Hare said wow
How profound can you get?
The polls officially opened at 7 o'clock this morning at Radner however a few voters were able to jump the gun
At 6.30 to this morning several voters already cast ballots in a Radner public library
My clock said 7 said Lambrose account of meetings the majority inspector pointed to his watch
It was 6.502 and well that's close enough isn't it?
Sure
By 7.05 22 Radner residents have finished voting
Pennsylvania's democratic presidential primers been closely watched across the nation no Schmidt
That's profound
Clinton and Obama have crisscrossed the state for six weeks each confident of victory that will carry no no they're not
Obama said the other day yesterday is going to lose but try to make it very close so again more misinformation
From the Philadelphia inquire
Which I'm not sure if it's still a nightrider newspaper but they has enough relationship with the hero to make them dirty
You know I mean they say dirty
It's a great opportunity for us
Voters will also be in a number of state and local primaries among the most highly contested and is the race to replace state senator Vince Fumo
While we don't care
A record number of Pennsylvania's are registered vote 8.3 million plus
Fired up by the slugfest between Clinton and Obama more than 152,700 voters have joined the democratic party since January 1
In addition more than 164,000 have changed the registration to become Democrat
The GOP also served this year adding more than 40,000 new admitted Republicans to their rules obviously they let them out for a couple of days
They let them out of the institutions Renfield was laughing
Hmm hmm hmm like that before voting first time voters must show a valid photo ID
Though the polls are scheduled with those at 8 p.m. Any voter still in line will be permitted to cast a ballot
I'm gonna have to blow my nose it's dripping it's running a little bit I'm doing better than I'm supposed to
I'm having another past deal
On a back of my quarter for the day
The bad part of it is that they're really good
Yeah, they're good. They're soothing. They're all the things that vitamin C laws and Jesus opposed to me
But then yeah, I can't think of the explosive feeling in my guts. I have a sign. Oh my god
I really thought I was gonna have like like my we just like we always used to say about the Humper you know
You say he would just burst that was funny remember that yep you used to say I did not
Yeah, you did I did not or maybe it was the beast that's what Joe Rose was saying about the beast one day was just gonna like
Break up
Is that what Joe was saying because he talks about the beast way too much he's not listening to Zach
Now Joe I don't want to start interfering with your show, but the last guy who did listen to Zach
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, he's been gone a long time you know once he's gone
The US Department of Justice here to announce it'll have staffers monitoring polling places
Throughout the city to ensure compliance with federal voting rights laws that's in Philadelphia
The legal women voters of Philadelphia has a staff volunteer answering questions on election day
They got a hotline which I'm not gonna give the number because we don't have anybody in Pennsylvania listening I'm sure
Oh and your buddy Rich Pactor your close personal friend yeah
Would about sent me a little bit of a follow up on this guy whose name I can't pronounce Jason Becky the actor about Scientology
I'll get to it. It's just a little bit more than what I would do that it's okay
All right and Rich Pactor George still hates you I do or is it vocal that hates him how they hate each other okay chickeneth
The committee of 70 a nonpartisan election watchdog group will also be available answer election related questions all day
And it's got a bunch of phone numbers here and it says contact Sam Wood to tell him what a jerk he is at the Philadelphia Inquirer
That crap about what was that line here?
They both what do you say they both expecting or whatever you both expect the waiting well whatever you say was a bunch of crap you know
But that's that's the media for you most of the media a bunch of like high school and college kids
I wouldn't say they're green behind the ears. They're like a puse behind the ears. They haven't got any idea which side is up and which side is down
It's like the people right about hockey and the Harold in the Sun sent like David J. Schlameel
Oh Jacques Martin listen Jacques Marta
This isn't this is a guy would know a hockey game if they shoved 14 pucks up his ass
But now you're making I thought he was gone too. I thought once he'd be gone he'd be but he's back
David J. Schlameel that's because he certainly works cheap
Something Georgian Christmas about yep 1190
Whoa W.O. W.O. 1190 on your dog Fort Wayne Indiana
Fort Wayne, Kamataki baby here we go
Which one are you non-Hispanic white I'm not going to read the numbers 72%
Cuban almost 9% those two are well the whites are up we have more white folks
But that I think the reason for that is because the the percentages are so far down on the ethnic see what I'm saying right white
Other Hispanic 33 African American 31 we're doing okay with the dark folks thank God not that many of them but couple
Native American 16 and we'd have a lot more than that if you wouldn't pick on the Indian
That's right keep confusing with me foe

Wonderful W.A.M. you have what
B.M.
3 30 in the morning and you hear yourself on me
Why the hell did God his phone on when he should be fast asleep
You get up and check the message and it says thanks for the sex
You just call your hubby cheating
You're a goofy high school
Sex
And the screaming stars
And the screaming stars
Oh
Your screen name's cookie panda and your man keeps her warm
Dexting about their last date when he visited her dorm
She banks and wall the sweater
The gift card and I pod
This is as you can't wait to see him
And feel a sexy body
And the screaming stars
And the screaming stars
The screaming stars
And the lamp is grown
Give him in the head
With own cell phones
Then you get killed
And you get lost in the family peace
He's lying on the floor
Holding his in between
What the hell?
You woke up on the neighbors
But to them it's nothing new
Because they've got rockin' husband
Who cheated on them too
Here comes another message
A wreath it if you dare A boogie panda says he's not wearing underwear
And the screaming starts
The screaming starts
And I'll get thrown
Get him in the head
With his own self-porn
And he kicked him high
He'll fairly be
He was running on the floor
Holding his seat
Okay, let me 48, 12 minutes before noon I love that
It's just the first time I've played that thought, well I guess
That's one of those pet and girl bits that goes on too long
But it's okay
Okay, plus it allows me to drop in all those screams
I'm trying to remember which PD it was, was it Boy Gary or was it Steve Nichol
Who thought that that sound was like offensive and it was over the lower I didn't hear that one
Oh yeah, you know, he didn't?
Oh yeah, they wanted me to stop playing that
Like there's something wrong with that
Oh, that's disgusting
Everything is disgusting
Now Boy Gary was disgusting and certainly Steve Nichol
He was beyond disgusting order
Now remember that dinner we had at Burton Jax with PD Bulger
Yeah, Grana Finkrat will think
And they took us to dinner so they could announce to us that they just paid off Steve Nichol
The PD to go away, we paid him off to go away to make us happy I guess
Right, to make me happy and give a crap about you
But nevertheless, that was at his good dinner too
It was free
And it was at Burton Jax and Mr. Ego wasn't even there even free either so that was good
There was no peppercorn sauce, there was no Parmesan cheese, there was no...like that
We need one more vote for 1200, there's not a vote it so we need one more
This is like a tally, you know, a tally-sally
You know if you want to get more Chinese you should just play a taitami
Yeah, that'll do it, yeah
That'll probably erase the time we got on there already
You know something, if we made you the PD, we would old points
That's here after all this time on this show and you're just lost
You're like little boy lost
A lump in the chair just desperately flailing around looking for some connection to reality
That's you
Well, our girlfriend is a nice person
Thank you for your service
And very accommodating
Toller it
Yeah, exactly
We'll need to put up with anything
1202 now, Mr. Hachot
Told ya
None of those votes were Chinese, I know
Oh, oh
We're still stuck on your mind
The ethics of the gun
We can leave this up there for a month, I don't think it's going to make any difference
And also a whole bunch of new listeners
See, that's another part of the problem is that in these eight years
There's the normal, I mean, aside from the fact that we don't have our show anymore like we used to
But there's the normal attrition, you know, the cosine
And there's no addition because there's no promotion
So without promotion there's no addition that we have just subtraction
Trition without addition
That's right, attrition without addition and
It leads us to the sorry, conjection
Yeah, it was busy-pition
You gotta be doing something
It sure isn't promoting any of these shows
But that's okay, because I'm sure now that this new deal is signed, sealed and delivered
That they're going to, that norm is going to hold their feet to the fire
And make sure that they live up to every dot and jittle of the, uh, jot and dittle
Of the contract, including the promotion that's in there
They, they, they don't do it
And he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he's busy with his baseball cards
Normal
Normal
Yeah, that one
So here's that story about the guy whose name, where you still don't know who it is, Jason Beggie
No, it's still don't, I mean, I could, you know, research him and go, oh yeah, that guy
Mark Bunker on Vimeo.com says last week we barked your actor Jason Beggie's stunning statements about
Leading Scientology, they were part of a three minute teaser video
After 13 years in a million bucks, Beggie finally decided to call it was dangerous and he left
By that time he was estranged from family and friends
Now Jason's full video interview with Bunker is available at Vimeo.com
And this is what he says, the Scientology process of getting clear is in Jason's words a con
You believe it, you invest your time in money, it's the getting out that's painful Jason says
Because people don't want to believe they've been conned, you can't be a fool that's too much to confront
I hate that my nose is dripping and it's running like a faucet
I hate it
But that's the story about the company, his childhood friend that really stands up
And my friend I met this kid, my best friend, he came to my class and I said, you and I are going to be friends
That's David DeCovney, my best friend
Our relationship was adversely affected by being in Scientology, he was very cool but he wasn't into it
I think his life received that she didn't like it and they were right, he was called a one-one SP, it affected our relationship
One of the first people I went to see when I left Scientology was David, I went over to his house, we were walking around
We talked about it a little bit, he doesn't lot South Park, doesn't know about all this stuff, I explained O.T. to him
Biggie said of the high level you can pay to attain in the sect
I start explaining him about Zenu and the Royal Officers, a basic story from Elrond Hubbub's science fiction
I couldn't get it a third of the way through the story and we had our faces on the floor, we were laughing so hard
I mean you couldn't even talk, it is so retarded
That is correct
I'm so over-corrected
Retarded, let's end again with what religion is in you
Right, so I looked him up
Who, David, Biggie?
Jason, Biggie, yeah, whatever his name is
And oh yeah, that guy
What guy is that?
I mean I've seen his face, he's a character actor in this and that
Yeah, as he looked at him, I've seen, no you would not like him
Oh my god, they're who care
Who old and pockmarked
Ten Colombians, ten Jamaicans but still only nine Chinese men
You know, is this thing going on, it becomes more and more disconcerting to me, you know what I mean by that?
Yeah, no you mean by that, but it's derving
I don't know why it's derving to you
Other than I know you like the Chinese, I mean
No, that's not, no, that isn't the point, it's not a question whether they look good or I'm going to do a hanky-panky with him
That's not the point
I mean why would you be so concerned about the Chinese as opposed to the French?
Well, I'm just using that name, okay
I don't know any Brazilians
The Brazilians are the Japanese
They're the Japanese, they're the Brazilians
Should I weigh more Japanese?
No, we should not
Yes, we should
The first time we done this poll eight years ago, we had ten Japanese, that was the last place
Yeah
And now we got six
We just over half the tally of what we had
So that's about the same ratio
You see, you see an S U again
Looking for Japanese chicks, that's all you care about
That's not all I care about, I don't like the Japanese, I like their culture, I always have
I don't since I was a little kid
I don't, okay
I don't like the way they bombed the Pearl Harbor, I didn't like that
Well, you know
A lot today
I don't like the way they screwed up the auto industry in this country, all of a do make good cars
Yeah, they didn't screw it up, they just did a good job
Yeah, we screwed it up
We?
We want to bad job, we the American
We mean we, white man
Yeah, the American screwed it up by being a...
From about six on Christmas survey, man
He's going for ten thousand votes
What do you think about that?
Should we go for ten thousand?
Just leave it on there
Yeah, a little bit on that side for a week or two
A week or two?
You think we're already a ten thousand and a week or two?
Well, you are a crazy person
You're insane, Ab
We'll be lucky to make two thousand
When's the last time we had two thousand on any pool?
Even when we were asked, are you alive or dead?
Paper or plastic?
Yeah, difficult questions
Favorite sandwich filling?
How can you get any better than that?
Have you ever killed a possum?
Have you ever played possum?
Charlie, be my god
What a retard
A pseudo intellectual...
There's nothing worse than a pseudo intellectual retard
Somebody who thinks he's brilliant and he's a dumbo
You know, like...
A little bit like that
Oh, y'all are really holding by the balls
And make them give you your fart sounds back
And all those four letter words
You know what, it leaves me limp
I mean, I start out limp
And then I'm that much limper when I'm through reading any of that crap
You ought to do this, you ought to do that
And he once worked in college radio 80 years ago
I'll go for you, Charlie, be
Bite it
This is Pretty Quint, whatever I shape my balls
I listen to the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour
Time for a gravy
Now
I want some quint
Ah!
Well, I'm gonna play that gravy
Quint
Time for a gravy
Please avoid, Lord, play or do
Assign me well and beat
The kind of guy that I want to do
That's who's Mr. Eason
Go to your moon
I'll go for it
And go on a date
But there's no chance at all
So does my make me a sports queen
If I want to see him grab the balls
No way, be wow
Look at that kid
You ain't seen no man
I've got a high-damping screen
That helps me see his balls
I can do what I want
But I ain't gonna never get none
No days of a busy school
Okay, that's not so great
But I'm also low that it might need
At least until he's 28
I'm great
Now
I was
So long, so quick
You ain't seen no man
Right like gravy quint
Oh, that's a wow
Look at that kid
You ain't seen no man
Right like gravy quint
So until at 5.60 W.I.K.M
I think our website by the way could use a little bit of refurbishing
It's getting a little old and stay out, yeah?
Like me
Yep
Old and moldy, you don't think?
Sure, so that's a big picture of that.
Pictures of Brady Quinn are fine, including the one where he's got those three guys that
are hands on each other's privacy.
But, they're old.
We need to update some of that, Mr. Who's going to take care of that?
Well, I think you should send some pictures in for starters.
Pictures of what?
You about the idea.
Oh my god, you want to see me?
And I put the camera on the snaps and shots of you doing stuff.
It's your website, people want to know about you.
You need to look at what you're doing.
Do what you're trying to do on?
Sure, in action.
You're doing the show.
Yeah.
And your boxers.
That's right.
You know something that is so disgusting, you got to look at that one.
You off the window.
The pigeons.
Yeah.
What the elevator looks like.
The concierge down there, you know.
Get out of here.
This is like a crazy horse.
What?
Why don't I just take a picture of the front of the building with the address on her, too?
That's a good idea.
Oh, by the way, Neil, how you doing?
We just came to visit you.
Yeah.
When the police cars go by, take a picture of them, you know, drive them by.
Take a picture of woodbind, your favorite slot between things like that.
That's not a bad idea.
Get a picture of your cabbie.
That's right.
It lets you take cameras into woodbind, just like they're a gallstream when you guys sneak.
That's right.
We did have to sneak.
The bouncing.
They got the real wheel of fortunes, and they're not the earth's osmos like at the hard rock.
And by the way, those ducks in a row that I was sending, I did so good Saturday.
The ducks suck.
You know what these are now?
Dead ducks.
I see.
I have to be really sick.
And not that I have a gambling problem, I have a boredom problem.
And I don't know why.
I mean, I could have sat around and watched them TV last night and got a bed real early
and rested and probably feel better today.
But no, I had my cabbie guy pick me up.
Because the car was spoken for last night, you know.
Paco was out and about.
Got only those doing what and with whom, but nevertheless.
And I went there.
And I actually, and of course that's what my stomach started exploding because it was eating all these damn...
All citrus things.
Seriously, there has got to be something really explosive.
And I mean, in the most literal sense in these things.
When the package says limit to per grade.
Could have also been a combination of things, you know.
No.
Okay.
Like what?
Like, you know, you might have been in a, you know, in a natural state,
anyway, maybe it was something you ate and then that put you open the top of the coffin.
All right.
No.
Just try.
No.
Make an excuse to form.
No.
For who?
Who calls?
Yeah.
Because you like calls.
I think if I were smart, I'd put my clothes on right now.
And do like, you know, about a ten minute interview.
Go across to the little Chinese market.
I'll find some Chinese money over there.
Y'all bet.
I know speaking English.
I know speaking English.
Very, very nice lady.
Her husband run the market.
The only problem.
Well, there's two problems.
Several problems.
What is they operate on Chinese touch?
I got only people at Mexican time, few time.
They're on Chinese time.
Which means basically the opener store wherever they feel like it.
So on a weekend, noon means 12, 15, 12, 30, 12, 45, 120.
Whenever they show up, you know.
And the other problem is no speaking English.
Now, she loves me because I'm probably her best customer.
I'm in there at least a couple times every day.
Do you say hi in Chinese to them?
No, I say hi in English.
And they say, oh, hi, how are you?
I see the others a few words now.
But like when tourists come in there, they don't know that they speak
you being less.
And so they'll ask you something.
Oh, I know speaking English.
See, to me, that could be wrong, but that's not a good way to do business.
No, but you know, if you're going to be like a retail business in a city where you
overwhelm and you're not speaking English.
Right.
You should be accommodating to the majority.
Yeah, I mean, she's a very sweet lady.
She's a very nice old lady.
But then again, she's a Chinese man.
Well, bust out with the hello and Chinese saying, Ni Hao the next time you in there.
I'm not speaking or Chinese.
Ni Hao, it sounds like crap.
I'm not doing that anymore than I speak to Paco and Espanol.
All right.
Except maybe once in a while, I'm calling Puta, something like that, but never less.
Puta.
Puta, Puta, Puta, Puta.
Well, you're well, it's just a make.
It might be right with his anyways.
Yeah, see you there you go.
One is right.
Okay, I'm sorry.
You're right.
Who said that?
It wasn't me.
But sure it was that right.
I wish it was me.
Who said that?
Me.
How many people are in the studio, do you think?
Sounded like the Humper.
No.
Didn't say, well, I mean, fat was definitely from a fat person.
All right, that was nasty.
Mark it down, Chris.
Yeah, chalk went up for Chris, he finally had a line, okay?
Once every like two or three weeks, you know, once every two or three years, he'll come up with a really great line.
That was good.
Puta, Puta, whatever.
Maracana, Maracana, Ishbinai, Maracana.
From 18 on your survey, let's keep it along.
We'll be lucky to get to 1500 on the stand thing, even if we leave it up there for a week.
I hope that Joe Bell puts his head in his hands in weeks like a child when he hears about this.
Because this is as good a, and I mean, of course not everybody who listens has got a computer.
Not everybody who listens can vote because if somebody within about 40 block radius votes, they at blocks them out.
But if we really had the kind of audience we used to have, we'd have like, you know, a 2500, 3000, they're already.
Wouldn't we?
Yes.
Yes.
But we don't.
And I'm not going to sit here and keep begging people.
I mean, it doesn't require rocket science just to put on there what you are besides A-hole, you know.
In a lot of your cases, we already know that.
It's obvious.
Uh-oh.
Could be TomPayne.com.
Yeah, it is.
Right.
Let's get ready to a rumble.
Let's get really economic stimuli.
Yeah, stimulate this.
Okay.
That.
And here's Photos.com.
You know, it's hotels.com.
I'm saving Berlin.
Well, that's for a Michael who listens to the show.
I keep threatening him with the same information about Berlin.
Maybe I'll send it along to him.
He wants to go to Berlin.
Each me and I have a winner.
If there was one place that I'd been that I would recommend to you, it's Berlin.
You've said that I'd love to go more than Amsterdam, more than Rome, more than Stockholm, more than...
I like Helsinki a lot.
But it's very far and maybe three days a year that we don't have temperature against above.
I don't know.
It's pretty cool there.
It's beautiful though.
And the finished people.
Woo-hoo!
They put those candy.
How many finished people we got?
I don't know.
I haven't met a fan once.
How about we could put Brit on it?
I mean, we've got other.
We've got 57 other.
But we could put Brit.
Oh, I mean, you could break it down, especially, you know, you get into the...
That angle of being.
You could break it down into all the different subgroups.
Like not tea.
Like, not tea.
We've got other ones.
Wow, that's great.
Other.
Right, well, there you go.
There's only, even though it's in third place, there's only 57 other.
Ten shiny ones, that's all we got.
And that's all we're going to get.
Maybe one or two more.
All week.
And all week in long, I'll sit with my head in my hands crying like a little baby.
Oh my god.
I don't do that every weekend anyway.
I see.
Well, the weekends are very boring.
I'm going to accept getting up early on Saturday morning going out, winning a thousand or fifteen hundred of woodbots.
I'll start crank calling you just as basically.
So Chris can say, oh gee, he'll get up early so he can go lose his mind.
Oh, how many weeks before I make $1,200, Chris?
How many weeks?
Yeah.
Next year.
See what I mean?
And he's giving me crap because I go out there and say, I said he mornings day to well Sunday, never on a Sunday.
Sunday should be my day to sleep in.
In fact, probably if I would have slept in a Sunday, not only would I have not lost back 800 bucks,
but I would have not gotten sick.
I would have felt great today, as opposed to feeling like really logian stuffed up.
I don't think this is allergies.
I don't think it's the flu.
I think it's a damn bad cold.
You know how many years since I had a cold?
Remember when I first started doing the shows up here all the time?
I had that scratchy throat and I started taking a ligra.
And I realized back then it was allergies and it was during the winter time.
And I got a humidifier and I had like that thing going all the day.
Get a little humidity in the air in here.
The winter time, that dry air man.
Yep, it'll give you...
It dries out your sinuses.
It'll give you bloody bogies.
I beg your pardon?
It'll give you bloody bogies.
Really?
Dry air.
Bloody bogies?
Mm-hmm.
Chapaties we got seven.
George is into the Chapaties six.
So say you're picking to the George, okay?
Make it.
Don't need to be.
But preferably or a scantily clad.
I mean that'd be nice.
I don't know to me and I hate to say this because I'm sure there are...
I don't know how many million people around Japan.
There must be some extremely attractive ones.
And I've seen a few of both sexes.
But generally speaking of course I don't know.
I don't go up to people and say, oh are you Korean or are you like Chinese?
Or are you Japanese?
Right.
You don't always know.
No.
You don't always know but generally speaking I can pick a...
Oh I can't.
I can pick a lot of them throughout Chinese.
The good look at it there's like a whole bunch of Asian people.
The good look at ones are Chinese and the ugly ones are Japanese.
Oh my god you can't see.
No the opposite.
What?
The opposite.
No.
I just said that the opposite.
Let me just say you know I know the guys.
Okay.
I just stick with the chicks and stick it stick it stick it stick it stick it stick it stick it.
It's a good plan.
Yeah.
I have to agree with George though.
About what?
Japanese women.
Just one of these guys?
No women.
Yeah the Japanese women are way better than the Chinese guys.
Yeah that might be way better.
Like those gaysha girls?
I wasn't thinking about that.
What was there any gaysha boys?
Yeah.
In Japan I'm sure they're wrong.
Yeah and Gaysha boys.
Gaysha yeah well a lot of Gaysha.
Gaysha Gaysha's.
Now what is that religion shinto?
Yes it is.
You gotta be careful the way you spell it and the way you say it.
And what is it?
Who is shinto?
It's not a person.
I know that.
But what is it all about?
They have several guides and ancestor worship and it's a...
It's not uncomplicated but they do do this.
We've got three Mexicans now.
Hey.
Go ahead.
Let's dump stuff on the material now.
Tell Rebecca.
The good news is that it's only a traditional thing over there.
They don't take it all that seriously.
It's just a...
I just dumped myself.
Well I said the PR word.
They don't take it all that seriously.
They're really, you know, it's just a traditional kind of thing.
But they do.
Well what kind of an answer is that?
I said what is it all about shinto and you said they don't take it all that seriously?
That's a good answer.
Yeah well because they got a lot of...
That's what I was saying.
What is Judaism all about?
Well they don't take it all that seriously and it's mostly about...
They've got a lot of...
Yeah, there you go.
They've got a lot of little holidays that they observe and rituals and things like that.
But what do they believe?
What do they believe man?
Multiple gods and...
An ancestral spirit.
Multiple gods and multiple orgasms.
Sure.
What's the biggest name?
The best time of the year is now Roger.
4.25.60.QAM.
The fourth leader.
Huh?
That's a good day!
The Will Today!
The Will Today!
Language tape number seven.
Ordering Chinese food over the phone.
Follow along and repeat.
Chinese take out manager.
I don't know what I'll be paying for this.
What's on with that?
Customer.
Yes.
I would like an egg roll to go, please.
Take out manager.
Ah, you want spinoe or animal?
Repeat.
Ah, you want spinoe or animal?
Customer.
I would prefer the egg roll, please.
Take out manager.
Ah, okay, I'll spinoe.
Give out a moushio's living with that.
Repeat.
You want a moushio's living with our customer?
No, no moushio, thank you.
And I requested an egg roll, please.
Ah, okay, spinoe.
You want a poofo, venna poofo, venna?
No, no.
No poofo, platter or spring roll.
Just an egg roll, alright?
Oh, do we have to want a pingual, right?
No, an egg, egg, an egg roll, I just want an egg roll, understand?
Ah, yeah, hold on, okay, boom, daly, I'll poop.
Valsa, tony, on, ah, hony.
I'll pass out, ah, one spring roll, don't egg roll, okay.
No, no, no.
No, spring roll, I don't want any spring roll, I just want an egg roll.
Who, an egg roll, okay?
Urgh, egg roll.
Yes, ah, we are from an egg roll.
Baby, eat, go back later.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Now turn this leaf over for language tape number 8.
giving directions to Iranian taxi driver.
All right.
I think our Germans are too tight.
We're getting a sympathetic quaggle there for you.
Getting what?
I'm bowling my nose and hacking up flim just for you.
Good.
Misery loves company.
And it gets a great...
Over at Mourney Dodge where they send us a lot of stupid stuff.
Yeah, we've done this so many times.
They send a poll.
Generally speaking, the group with the worst body odor is.
And then I got a bunch of...
I've done that a zillion times, okay?
Who smells worse?
I'll tell you who smells worse.
People who don't bathe.
There you go.
They smell the worst.
People who can't afford to buy a bar or a soap
or a little body wash.
Do people still use soap?
Ah!
They must.
I know we've been through this a million times,
but it's just...
It would be like a guy still wearing two-piece bathing suits.
Like people wearing knickers and white-buck shoes.
One of those other shoes, those, um...
Penny loafers?
Yeah.
And those two tones.
What do they call those?
I thought those were white-bucks.
No, I don't like those shoes.
Saddle shoes.
Is that what they call them?
Yes.
Two-tone.
So Steven, on my space, not our regular friend,
but another Steven says,
every time we mention Brazilians lately, I'm reminded this.
BAM!
BAM!
Ah!
Are that?
Robert Gates briefed Bush this morning.
He told Bush that three Brazilians were killed in action this morning.
Everyone's amazement.
All the color ran from Bush's face.
Then he collapsed on a was desk hidden in the hands,
visibly shaken, almost whimpering.
He finally composed himself and asked Gates,
just exactly how many is a Brazilian?
Uh, that's that's kind of cute.
I mean, it's not.
Falled on the floor, life you're asked off,
but it's kind of cutesy.
How many is a Brazilian?
In other words...
The...
Dumb.
That's your Brazilian dumb.
And even dumber than that,
our people will still support him.
That twenty-some percent, whatever it is.
People are just our intractable and immovable,
especially those far-bison religious nuts.
Oh, he's a madagob!
I'm sure he's getting instructions from God
to make sure we kill all those innocent people.
Well, there's A-rabs, you know, God-haven.
That's true.
You mean even the American troops,
almost 4,000 plus there,
then were A-rabs too?
I didn't know that.
Well, there are heroes.
1239 on the survey.
We better get to 1300 plus by the time we're done today.
I'm going to be embarrassed.
We had over a thousand,
and I sat down here this morning.
Well, I mean, by before 10 o'clock.
Chris...
Uh-huh.
Ten shiny mine.
That's all we got.
Hey, it's pretty good.
It's what?
It's pretty good.
No, it's not!
It's more than nine.
The first time we had eight years ago,
we had 68.
3.2% of the entire audience was shiny mine.
And now...
One...
What is it?
0.8.
Zero point eight.
What was it before?
3.2.
So that's a fourth.
We've lost three quarters of our shiny mine.
And I just keep using that one because it's a class,
and now we can do the Brazilians.
We got six.
Eight years ago, we had 86.
We've lost 80 Brazilians, man.
That's bad happen.
Maybe they all had the operation, I don't know.
What?
Nothing that's still in Brazil.
I don't think you need the operation.
All you need to do is have the right clothing.
You know the right attire?
Is that how it works?
I don't know, I've never been there.
I almost went to Sao Paulo.
Yeah.
I'll be there.
I realized I was going to go there on vacation,
this is many years ago.
And I look at my travel book.
It's a nine hour flight from Miami to Sao Paulo.
And I thought for crying out loud,
I can go to Europe in less time than that.
In addition to which I might not like Sao Paulo.
You think I would like it there?
I don't know.
If you have any desire to go to Brazil?
Sure.
Check it out.
I don't know how to stay in the language.
No, I know, but my biggest concern is don't they do a lot of kidnapping
and just killing of tourists?
I'm talking about like in Colombia.
Right.
And a lot of those other Latin American,
Mexico?
Oh yeah.
Ooh, it's big industry there.
Yeah, but I got friends who could escort me around Mexico.
Yeah, that don't mean much.
I'll kidnap them too.
I doubt it.
1242 on the survey.
We want to get a million votes on here.
In fact, I say we leave it on the same poll until we get a million.
Okay.
I mean, we got five and two third years to go.
And George would be happy about that.
Yeah.
Can you imagine the joy that you would have?
Not having to worry about the poll?
Hmm.
George might want to work every day and get Rebecca all upset.
It's not a small piece that could over you.
It's not a small piece that could over you.
George works every day.
Okay.
Starting now.
Now, what do you, I guess you didn't like my idea of just putting on my clothes?
No, I hate it.
Yeah.
It's like her idea.
Yeah, it's like her.
Well, I would do it like at the beginning of a break, which gives you like a couple minutes.
Okay.
Yeah.
And then you could play along a bit.
I'll play a tune.
I'll play a tune.
Stop with the tune.
Like a ridicul.
Oh, yellow bird.
You're a ridicul.
I'll bet.
I'll play yellow bird.
Isn't that a bit?
No.
The worst.
Speakers at a Doha conference on Mika's.
Sorry.
Just get it ready.
Speakers on Mika's.
Important said that the Holy City not Greenwich should become the reference point for
World Time.
We're igniting an old controversy that started some four decades ago.
These Mata, Shmata heads, man.
These Mung Brains.
They just won't stop.
A group of Islamic scholars presented on Saturday.
Scientific evidence to prove that Mika was the core of.
See, there's something missing here.
The core of something that the zero longitude passes through the Holy City and not through
Greenwich in the UK.
Greenwich in England has been the home of Greenwich mean time, GMT since 1884.
GMT is sometimes called Greenwich Meridian Line at the World Observatory in Greenwich because
that's where it's measured.
Greenwich is the place where all time zones are measured.
In a clear support for the call, Islamic scholar Yusuf Al-Qurabdu-Adawi said Islam unlike
other religions never contradict its science.
Right.
The participants recommended the unification of the time in the Arab world to the time in
Mika instead of Greenwich.
They also called the Arab governments to abandon the new world match because they're forged
to serve Western interests.
Oh, where does it stop?
It doesn't.
They also demanded that buildings in the Arab world be directed towards Kibla.
Kibla?
Kibla.
Kibla.
Kibla.
Kibla.
I see.
The gathering also urged to organize conferences to go with the idea of Mika's the center of the
world's land and distribution of CDs to support it.
You got your Islamic CD?
Better know but I ordered it.
You better get it.
They're going to make you an offer you can't refuse.
The conference was organized with it as Saat Makkah, the watch of Mika.
The inventor of the clock, Yassin Aishuk, said it runs and I clock wise the direction of
Kowaf, the rotation around Kaba.
The Switzerland based the word winning in the veteran Palestinian origin said his invention
meant a lot of opposition.
It took him four years to win the patent.
What does that mean?
The inventor of the clock?
What looked like?
I guess somebody had to invent that.
They're different from the clock.
They're different from the clock.
So what kind of they talking about?
A moderator of the event?
Raba?
Raba?
What's his name?
Who's also the wife of the watch?
His mentor said the West imposed on us the invisible, wrennage line is the world's reference
time.
She said she hoped that an Islamic country would adopt the project to strengthen the belief
that Mika was the core of the world, not theoretically but practically.
Yeah, let's argue about it.
Let's kill each other about it.
Okay, sure.
Let's get real far-bisit about it, baby.
Let's argue what kind of they are.
What's the next talent?
You don't have no politics.
425.
62 AM.
I mean, 4th leader.
Meal.
I'm Johnny Knoxville.
And I'm going to set myself a fire.
Jenkins, number three.
The final chapter of the Jackass COVID-19.
I'm Ben Margera, and this is pre-style wood chip for diving.
Woo!
I'm the first human 3 from zero IQ pictures.
I'm weaving on top of this face needle, and instead of a parachute, I got a backpack full
of cooking utensils to run them on.
I'm Steve O.
I'm going to guard a lighter fluid.
The chapter's nuclear warhead to my back, and rest of the mountain lion, dude.
I'm going to be a nuisance with the performance.
The professionalism will not be returning for Jackass from the fall.
Okay, 1231 at 5.60 WQAM.
Happy you're Tuesday, too.
Is there anything worse?
I mean, there are more serious things, serious diseases, but is there anything more annoying
than a cold?
Okay, maybe like a bad cold or a flu or tuberculosis or strep throat?
Cancer.
I'm not, I just got through a thing.
I'm not talking about those kind of diseases.
Okay, Jackass.
Move on to clague.
Let's proceed.
Oh yeah, let's get into the endowing.
The parts fall off.
I hate that.
Very, very.
Who?
Which I definitely wouldn't have now, because I'm getting all this vitamin C.
I hate to break the news even having my third, lasage, my third cough round.
Don't know, dude.
Only supposed to have two a day.
You can't eat only two.
Right, you can't suck only two a day.
We still have only 10 Chinese men, by the way.
There are 149 tallies on there, though.
That's not too good.
Well, what are you going to think of it?
Like it's about 1,500, and then that's the end.
You can just stop.
I don't think it'll ever stop.
It might slow to a trickle.
I mean, just, you know.
Just be over.
Maybe I have pneumonia.
But if I had pneumonia, wouldn't I have fever and cheetos?
Right?
Right.
I imagine.
Popping on a peels.
Never says.
Try to email this, but this email address failed.
Please announce this event to your listeners.
Thanks, says Deborah.
Move on.org political action.
Move on members to the main senator, Mel Martinez,
stop spending on endless war and focus on issues at home.
Good luck, Deborah.
Yeah.
I don't want to be a negative, Deborah,
but you're farting into a windstorm, honey.
On Thursday, April 24th, this Thursday,
members of move on.org political action in Boca.
And South Palm Beach County will release a new report,
Iraq and Recession.
The report focuses on groundbreaking poll numbers that show that
voters in Florida believe that the billions of dollars a week spent on Iraq
should be invested in economic priorities at home.
No kidding.
Senator Mel Martinez is consistently voted with a presence
to spend half trillion dollars on this endless war and Iraq
while ignoring the mounting economic pressures of voters here in Florida.
The billions per week were spending there
to be invested in our ordering economy here at home,
said Deborah Lysden, local move on member.
It's time to bring our troops home and use those same dollars for the priorities of most Americans.
Healthcare, clean energy and job creation to help those heard by impending recession.
After the event, local move on members will deliver a report to
Representative Bobby Wechler at his office in Boca.
And he's agreed to bring the report to Senator Mel Martinez' attention.
Here you go, Mel.
Emelle is going to say,
Get lost.
Madi Cohn.
Like that.
That will be the end of that.
Here's your president.
Canada is negotiating a Columbia Free Trade Agreement.
Mexico has a Free Trade Agreement with Columbia.
Columbia?
And a lot of folks are waiting for the United States Congress to bring this issue up and pass it.
Oh my God.
Many are.
It makes no sense to me to say that Columbia goods can come into our country.
Duty free.
Yet our goods can't go into Columbia.
Duty free.
Duty.
And yet that's the case.
An agreement with Columbia with level of playing field.
Nazi bastard, lunatic, maniac.
But that's him.
That's what some of you wanted out there.
That's what you got.
And that's what all the rest of us got.
That's the part that's so painful.
I didn't vote for him.
George didn't vote for him.
George can't vote of course.
Right.
Well maybe.
He didn't vote for him.
Criston will have to vote.
See what?
I said you're too busy filling your fat face to wear about voting.
That's what I said.
I vote.
You did?
For him?
Yeah.
Currie?
Yep.
Scary.
And I was still a Republican at that time.
What did I tell you about him?
Hey, given some credit he got better.
I said I was.
He gave him some credit for what?
For changing from being a Nazi.
Right.
It's not easy to admit that you were wrong for so long.
Some of us had to.
It's a very difficult thing to do.
Some of us?
Us.
Well I was born again, remember?
Oh my god.
But I got better.
I think Rebecca's got a good point.
Yeah.
George is trying to take over the show.
That'd be good pull.
Yeah.
How would you phrase that?
Is George trying to push the old man out?
Right.
You kiddin?
This is the best slacker job.
If only I could get paid for it.
Then it'd be sweet.
I like a bird.
Remember the bird?
That was too slacker job.
In fact it would have been great if we could add Chris and the bird on the show.
Then we could add the bird and the turd.
Hey if I got paid like him, I would do whatever.
That was it.
That's all you had to do and eat.
You know what?
If I got paid like that, I would even run the board still.
Wow.
Let me tell you something.
He used to make 50 grand a year for sitting there cackling once in a while and eating.
Right.
I was going to run the board even.
He didn't let the fact that I used to talk about the cubs in Harry Curie.
I used to throw a tantra gun nuts.
He put his head down on the table.
He'd storm out of the studio.
No he wouldn't storm out.
He would just put his head down on the counter and act like, oh jeez, nothing's again.
Oh dear.
I saw him storm out.
I don't remember why during a couple of my training sessions with Nick Lawrence.
On my show?
On your show.
Get out of here.
All right.
I'm going to storm out.
I'm pretty sure it was over things like that.
It was a tantra gun that was thrown over that you wouldn't stop talking baseball.
Did he have crutches or something?
Yes.
Okay, so I remember those stories now.
He had MS.
And now he's dead.
So don't be picking on the dead, okay?
Why?
Well go ahead and pick on the dead.
What are they going to do?
That's right.
1257 on the survey.
10 Chinese Month.
That's it.
That's all you're getting.
We started with six.
Two and a half hours I've been screaming.
I'm bleeding.
I had choking and my nose running and gagging.
I've been screaming for more than two and a half hours.
What are you trying to say?
BAAAAMING!
I know it.
Verbeca is right.
George wants to turn into a hetero show.
God forbid.
You can see that studio now.
All my pictures.
Oh yeah.
The Tom Brady pictures.
Oh yeah.
All those pictures I'm sure are long gone.
Just tear it down.
Damn god!
We made a bonfire out of them.
And now there's all these pictures of hot and chicken.
All of our balls.
All of our balls.
And then all those posters as if they weren't played.
You understand?
That's supposed to be a studio.
I know.
We had to exercise.
You're just loud in there just to eke out a minimum living.
I had a Santorilla priest come in here and exercise the demons.
He's exercising.
He heard that.
He sacrificed a chicken to Chango.
Got all the patriotic.
That's especially.
Did you throw a post-allocating?
I threw it around.
Two.
Fluff 57 on the survey.
Lights of course.
Cubans, yeah.
Other.
69.
Other Hispanic 34.
Like Niga and I.
No, we got those.
What would be other?
Like Guatemala?
Sure.
Or Salvadoria?
Things like that.
Maybe Spaniards.
Spaniards?
See.
Don't you think we got those?
We got a couple of Spaniards in the audience.
Speak like that.
Yes.
Catalan.
Catalan.
Other Hispanic 34.
African American 31.
They're holding up their end.
Don't hold it up too high.
Native American 16.
Recon 16.
How do we do with the Recon's first time?
43.
Oh my god.
Every ethnic group has vanished on this show, Joe Bell.
Each of your parts out.
But thanks for the great promotion though.
And thanks for the Fartsounds.
If we could play like if we had a quota,
we like to play three or four Fartsounds today.
Hear the ambulance again?
Right.
Are they coming up your wall or something?
That's loud.
I mean, that was like the loudest we've heard.
Sure.
They're getting closer.
They're coming outside my window.
They're getting closer.
You want me to come to tone it down a little bit?
Would you?
No.
Haitian 14.
Colombian.
Like your friends as Colombian.
Or all wing.
13.
I just call it correct.
Colombian.
Like a Tony Montana.
Yeah, but we're speaking English.
Pronouncing English.
Yes.
Speaking English.
Say a whole.
He thinks he's his brother, Piquit Pani.
Chinese Mon 10.
You're making 10.
I wonder if there's any.
You're making Chinese Monks.
I've met several actually in it.
Get out of here.
You met several you're making Chinese Monks.
Yeah.
Get out of here.
Listen to me.
They sound like Jamaicans and they look like Chinese.
And you want to talk about twist in your brain.
Just try to reconcile those two.
You know, that sound of that image.
You know, they speak all Jamaican Mon.
You know, I read Ghanja on all that stuff.
Chinese guy speaking Jamaican Mon.
You know it.
Well, there's white Jamaicans too.
I mean, you might not have seen them, but they're there.
And they speak that way too.
You mean like Bob Marley.
He wasn't white.
No.
Oh, that Rebecca is so sharp.
You got a running guy.
You're right.
You're going to be a new old progos 560.
If you think you're a newbie, you need a horse.
Leader.
I'm not my junior, honey.
Kuku, baby.
Let's turn this mother out.
Puff the match of rapper is on my TV.
No one heard of him before.
Oh, his name is Bob Marley.
I said that's Bob.
The match of rapper won't be here then long.
Not unless he learns to sing on the right of the friggin song.
I said Bob.
The match of rapper is all over MTV.
Only because someone shot an old glorious viage.
That guy may be someone should tell him.
Making it this way is wrong.
Hicking at your dead best friend.
Sticking plus fall.
Stoop doggy doggy dog on the ball track.
1245, a QM.
I know that the whole world has just reached rock bottom.
Rock bottom.
When George tells me that Bob Marley wasn't white.
And says it was a strange face.
What other kind of face do I mean to say?
It was a joke.
I knew what you were talking about.
Oh my god.
You're like Marvin.
You said Bob Marley was talking like that.
He wasn't white as a joke.
I'm going to read the Rebecca facts all the rest.
Just chill too.
Oh my god.
Democrats turned out earlier cross Pennsylvania today.
After enthusiasm generated by the president's primary between
swillery and barack led to record voter registration.
Perfect day with the weather.
All across the state.
A few minor glitches reported that election polling places.
And I'll gain you counted this morning.
I want you to the Pittsburgh Post Gazette to try to get a little bit of something.
Because see it isn't, you know, they don't care.
In fact, if it's a record turnout, that's probably good for Obama.
So they don't want to put that on here.
That's right.
Because there are a bunch of fascist pigs, Wolflet's Grig, and the whole crew.
And I think I've got Tony Snow coming aboard.
Won't that be lovely?
Pretty soon they can get Hermann Gehring and Wolflet's Grigah to Man Show.
Mark Wolosik directed the County elections bureau said another reported problem said
had a significant effect.
Because of the expected large turnout election officials defuverly getting machines started
at a polling place in North Brattick.
And another in the city's bank sales section prompted some concern.
At these two sides, election judges, folks and inspectors all nominally paid volunteers.
Initially, we're unable to print out verification that the voting machines have been set at zero.
No, they were probably set at like 50,000 first-woolery and three-for-obama.
Nothing was wrong with machines.
He had the case, Mr. Wolosik said.
A technician was dispatched to each location, helped to properly set up the machines mine.
Nothing like machines that are like tighter than a snare drum like the dollar wheel of fortune it would buy now.
See, it's living proof.
I mean, what are the odds that all of a sudden for like three weeks, everything just dies.
Is there any, if they had no control over it?
If it's just random chance?
Random chance, my ass.
And the world of computerization, they can control any damn thing they want.
That's right.
All I got to do is flip a switch, click a mouse, and all of a sudden everything is on slow cook.
You know what I mean?
Yep.
You believe me?
Of course I do.
I mean, we'll never find that out because even in that book that I'm supposed to get saved if I live long enough.
See, here's the thing.
If they have the ability to do it, they'll do it.
They'll do it.
Right.
And they do what they do.
Nothing was wrong with machines.
A technician was dispatched to each location, helped to properly set up the machines mine.
More than 30 people, and thanks Bill and several more North Broad, I've used emergency paper,
the ballots to cast their votes.
Emergency, on your Stephen Harper, a real A-hole of the...
Progress of the name?
Maybe the B-A.
No, he's doing it in front, say, very impressive.
You idiot, you bush junior.
Stephen Harper, Canadian Prime Minister, by the way, Jackass.
Validating in Butler County was proceeding smoothly with no major glitches or slowdowns at any of the county's 85 voting precincts.
The elections bureau director Regis Young had predicted last week that turnout could retrek at levels.
Reports from precincts were mixed in the initial hours, which didn't say too much.
Stay wide turnout would set a modern record for Democratic presidential primaries of more than 2.3 million of the 4.2 million registered party members.
Show up at the polls today.
The current record just under 55% was said in 1980, when Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy narrowly defeated them present Carter in Pennsylvania.
Remember that?
No.
You know?
No.
Jimmy Carter, what about him?
He had a lust in his heart.
Who does his brother... his brother was peeing a lot on the side of buildings.
Who does a Billy Beer?
And his daughter was butt ugly, just like the Clinton's daughter, butt ugly.
Emi.
Troglidite.
Democratic, of course I can understand in that case, because both parents were so.
I mean, Jimmy.
Jimmy Carter, my ass looks better than his face.
I'll take your word for it.
I have seen too good.
The lady.
I don't want to compare.
I know.
Democratic enrollment began to so earlier this year when it became apparent that neither candidate would cleanse the nomination before the Pennsylvania primary.
The Republican primary is also being held, but what's the point?
Since last fall's election largely due to the aggressive efforts of the two presidential campaigns, the number of Democrats increased by nearly 317,000 as of March 24.
The deadline for switching or joining parties.
Yeah, let's have a party.
I'll tell you who ought to be on the ballot.
Party.
Yeah.
Don Cox.
We'll write it down.
They've priced 65 Republican and Bellevue cast a vote early today for McCain.
But he said that's not necessarily the way he'll go in November general election.
If Obama runs, I'll be very interested in taking a look, he said, retiree Mr. Price.
The change thing gets me Mr. Price said, I'm a Republican, but I don't need jerk Republican.
Just a jerk.
I don't know, like Chris.
Oh, come on, I'm not giving this a song in a dance, not even on the show.
Oh, I'm going to vote for Obama, yeah.
You're going to go out there and vote for McCain 40 times.
I think I'm going to want on the show that voted for Obama.
I beg your pardon?
I think I'm the only one on the show that currently voted for Obama in the, uh, what did we say?
What do you call it?
Just saying.
What about November?
Assuming he wins the nomination, which he will.
What about November?
All vote for him again.
When the chips are on the line.
I will vote for him again.
Yeah.
You believe him, George?
Yes, I do.
Flyer.
I'm not lying.
Did you know Greg Regress?
Flyer who?
No.
You don't know Greg Regress?
I know of him.
I mean, he never said one word to me, even when like, you know, why not?
I don't know.
He doesn't want fat kids.
I guess I was beneath him or something.
I don't know.
I wouldn't want to see that.
I definitely wouldn't even.
Just about everybody else in the building was only female.
My God.
Talk about a guy who got around.
And I write, George, or what?
He got all around.
He spread it all around.
Well, maybe they were spreading it.
I don't know.
Yeah, he did.
Some of the people that he allegedly, well, I don't want to go into it, but makes me
gag.
But then again, I guess he wasn't very choosy.
1272 votes on the pool.
Now, is he still married to Carolyn now that she got canned or what?
Yes.
You know that's for a fact that they're still married?
Yes.
How do you know that?
I'm up to date.
When he comes by, the building is he stopped buying, give you a pen on the shoulders,
and say, I was going.
How's it going, George?
Right?
No.
No.
I haven't seen him in a long time.
Really?
Really.
Well, what do you sound like you're almost in a good mood?
Oh, there's your dumb president again.
Your trade relationship with the United States is their point at which you shift attention to
the people running for the White House and their views to try to reach out to them.
Well, actually, my husband is just serving on trade right now.
He's the biggest concern with trade is trading baseball cards with.
I'll give you 15 guesses in the first 14 don't count.
You're a kid.
You're a kid.
Yeah.
Trade baseball cards.
He's got an old Dutch lender that he wants to trade for a 53-roney banks.
572 votes on the pool.
11 Chinese Monks.
Did I mention we got 11 now?
You did.
I'm pretty, I don't know.
Maybe they're just a little bit slow with the Chinese Monks.
If you're not slow at reproducing, I'll tell you that.
How do they make a billion babies?
They try harder.
They're harder?
You told me.
Never mind.
Don't worry.
Oh, thank you.
Well, how would I know?
You'd know.
You know.
You know your Chinaman.
Couple.
Couple of Chinaman.
You've coupled?
Well, I have.
One.
Why do I want to go in with it?
Okay, so you keep trying to suck me into talking about sexual experiences on the air.
Yeah.
And being an old fool like I am.
Oh, suck me.
Yeah.
Just leave you down this road.
Maybe that's why I'm having such an obsession with the Chinaman on the pool.
Okay, I keep thinking I want a particular.
That could be.
Maybe.
About 75 on air.
We got to get to 1300 before 2 o'clock or Chris is going to quit.
He's going to be so depressed.
We started with, when the show started, a little over I think a thousand four something like that.
Yeah, something like that.
So another 271 during three hours is not what you call, especially when we're just asking people to give us an answer.
That's all.
Paper or plastic.
Are you alive or dead?
That's all pretty simple.
Am I right?
Right?
Don't die.
Don't eat more of those things.
Not.
I would never, I'll take it one thing.
I would never want to go through that experience again.
Just a warning to those of you people.
See, you tried to do the right thing.
They had a million different kind of lozenges in the drugstore.
But I get the one that says no sugar added.
Isn't that the right thing to do when you're an old diabetic like me?
That's right.
That's right.
And the great part of it is that my blood sugar this morning was the best it's been in a long time.
I mean, I was sicker than hell, but maybe that's the, you know, the trade-off that I'm going to have to have.
Get my blood sugar down, keep my diabetes under control, and then be sick all the time.
Like, ugh.
Or go out and get me a, like a gallon ice cream or something.
And feel much better.
You were the president called around saying it's in the region's interest to trade freely.
There's something he is so dumb that it's just, it's staggering.
It is staggering.
Well, if you want things to say in articulate, but that doesn't even come close to describing it.
He's a dumb-o.
He's a moron.
And he's your president.
Not mine.
Next, come here.
12.56 at 5.60.
And don't forget what we got today.
We got them jerks at two.
Oh, boy.
And then the D.H.O. from Adolga 4.
John Linder for D.H.O. at 9.
After a bunch of stuff that you almost knew.
Boy, it's the 1 to 2 hour.
From the producers of Ice Road Truckers and X-Men, comes an all new series about one of the most intense hockey of patients in the world.
Sess Cool Suckers.
You never know what you're going to find.
Or smell.
But you can't let it get you down.
Just pick up and get in there like a man.
Get in there like a Sess Cool Suckers.
Sess Cool Suckers.
A lot of guys like to use the black hose, but I like the clear kind.
I like to see what I'm sucking.
See what it's like to live live on the edge every day.
You know one wrong step?
That's it.
It's over.
You're covered in it.
An American original series, Sess Cool Suckers, only on the history channel.
Smell the fear.
Yes, smell this.
101 at 5.60 WDQM, and it seems like we only been here one about 40-50 hours today.
Right.
That's how it is when you will under the weather.
Sure.
The weather under the weather.
But this ought to cheer you up.
Great news.
Yes.
Very important press conference today.
Dolphin's press conference today.
At 145.
Not earlier.
We're going to carry it.
We're going to carry it because it's very important.
Oh, right.
It's not going to be 145 firm.
We have to wait, you know, do that little bit of a waiting game.
Oh, but they'll tell us.
They'll tell us.
They'll tell us.
They'll tell us.
They'll tell us.
That's a little bit of a risk.
So we're going to move all the breaks up.
Obviously, get them all back to back.
Let's run them all back to back.
Then, when they tell us that we're ready, that they're ready, then you and Jacks are going to have a handoff with each other.
What are you talking about?
Well, we're going to hand it off to Jacks.
Or you are.
No, I think we're going to throw it to the press conference.
Okay.
And when it's done, see, we're making sure that...
Okay.
...Furj is trying to sabotage me.
That shes me.
I think he just...
I think he just...
...clarars like he's trying to...
...clarars like Sansa.
That's exactly what he said.
What?
He might have said something to you differently on the way out of the room, but in here he was talking about it.
Yeah, that's because he talks out of both sides of his ass.
He'll be able to actually hand off.
Jacks hand off.
I'm going to hand off a rotten egg to Jerk.
Okay.
Oh, come on down.
And that's the truth.
1285 on a survey in 12 Chinese men.
See the coming through for you?
But I'll...
Yeah.
Six.
So you should let me go across the street and get some real off-coff drops.
You can do that.
And I'd be good.
You're good.
I'm sitting here gagging and puking and we're back at a very good point.
That's so I'll croak and then you can take the shoulder.
Yeah, that's it.
That's my big point.
Well, I'm not going to croak today.
I'll tell you that.
Good.
Sliker.
That's just like you.
Croak to get out of work.
Well, here's that iodine factor.
Iodine?
Iodine.
Well, most of the media...
Try it again.
Well, I'm under the weather.
That's a good excuse, Jerk.
Well, most of the media attention focused on the Pope's trip to the U.S. overwhelmingly positive.
One TV show host, choice of words for the Pope and Catherine Church, landed him in hot water.
And an apology has only stoked the fire.
Apologize my ass.
Bill Maher, host of real-time on HBO, spotted off a man on his ankle on his live show that had many calling for his resignation.
As Benedict was ready for a six-day trip to the U.S., Maher was critical of the Catherine Church because he feels the religion was treated differently after it's sex abuse scandal because of its history, size, and clout.
Maher also took comedic jabs at the Pope, commenting on his attire, and harping on the fact that he was part of the Hitler youth, a group he was forced to join and he eventually fled.
Right.
Maher said, if you have a few hundred followers and you want some of them alleged children, they call you a cult leader.
If you have a billion, they call you the Pope.
After the attacks, Maher offered napalgeum as April 18th.
So what I tell you about him is a whim.
He always has been always will be.
He says a lot of the right things, and then went into out, he'll always whimper.
A nibbish.
So on that score, you know what my Catholic friends, I'll never make the Pope as an Nazi joke again, because you're technically right.
Okay, and also because of the distraction from the main point.
And the main point I was making that if the Pope instead of a religious figure was the CEO of a chain of nationwide, they'd hear centers who were thousands of employees who'd been caught molesting children and covering it up, he would have been in jail.
William Donahue, the far-bicid William Donahue, president of the Catholic League for religious and civil rights.
We have set Maher's apology for accusing the Pope of being a Nazi.
Too bad he didn't stop there.
For him to suggest that the Pope was in charge of policing molesters and failed in doing so is patently absurd.
Oh yeah!
Any criticism of the church is always patently absurd.
Just ask William Donahue, BAAA!
With his teeth clenched and his eyes darting around like a pinball machine.
The American life leader, Roman Catholic, group of set up a website asking for the outright firing of Maher.
The New York Native has no stranger to controversy.
In 2002, ABC decided not to renew his show, pull politically incorrect, after Maher commented that Adlovin terrorists were not cowards.
He's an idiot.
I don't know if the deal he says a lot of things to you that he's still an idiot, okay?
And a whim.
Apologize my ass.
What did he say that was incorrect?
Right. Nothing. He just wanted to keep his job.
Why? He just wants to keep his job.
Oh, like I said, a real whim.
I'll find it. Where, where, how is it?
I'll find it.
Oh there it is.
It's the right. I am not a Nazi.
I got news for the Pope couldn't hold a candle or a ritual.
I might like it.
What a whole Ricky Tiki is doing, either we're not taking calls for wild but pretty soon they'll have that problem alleviated.
Next couple of days I'll have you walk me through the whole installation of my router, right?
You claim you're going to be able to do.
Well, done it before. So let's see.
And some of the ones what you're saying is if I'm not a total ninkapoop, well that's not the only factor.
And so what's the fact that the other devices that have to be plugged into it, they have to be at least as smart as you are.
What does that mean?
That some devices are very plug and play and they find IP addresses all by themselves.
In other words, you got to take them by the hand and tell them where to look and what to do.
Either way, we'll figure it out.
Well, how come I can like hook my modem right up in the computer and the internet is right there, no problem?
The different dead thing.
It's a different thing?
Yeah.
Then a router is there.
Well, the router has to pick up.
There was a disk that came with this, do I need to install after I have to move?
I do.
Not necessarily.
Do you use Windows XP?
Okay, here's two experts.
Chris says yes.
George says no.
That's what you hear with that.
Well, I like George walk you through it.
When I installed mine, I installed a disk and then it's just that everything by itself.
You did what?
I installed the disk and it didn't work.
Who want purpose?
When I installed my router this weekend.
From what purpose?
To install programs.
Well, like George said, Windows XP a lot of times you don't need to do that.
You are.
Yes.
Well, thank you.
Although we got 1200 and what?
1290 on the survey.
We'll get to 1311.
That's not so great.
If we really had that gigantic audience that we had eight years ago, we'd have probably
2500.
Easy.
Easy.
But not no more.
And that's that Joyce bitch over there in Naples.
That's the evil doorman.
Too bad the Pope didn't go give her a good talk into when he was here.
Probably should have farted in her face.
Can you imagine the Pope farting with all those robes on?
Well, he talks about that.
Probably just stays right there.
Oh my God.
Talk about musty.
I wonder what William Don who would do if the Pope farted in his face.
Probably have that same grimace on his face.
Like kisses, right?
Kisses thing.
That's the thing in this world man.
You can criticize this one.
You can criticize us whoever us happens to be.
Criticize anybody you like but not us.
Because we get pissed off.
Chinese we got a dozen.
We got a dozen Chinese month.
Now I would cure you.
I probably shouldn't say it.
Oh, it's not that bad.
Well, like sometimes people will be discussing what they want to go for lunch or dinner.
You want to go get chinks?
You know what they'll say?
Sure.
Now do you find that a derogatory term or what?
Oh, I'm not Chinese so you have to ask what are them.
But you know what I'm saying.
You're not black.
Probably because I can eat derogatory.
Never mind.
That's not good.
No.
That's probably why we only got 12 Chinese month.
I would imagine they don't appreciate that.
You're always saying let's go eat chinks.
That's me.
Oh wait no.
That's you.
Yeah.
From 95 on to pull a Christmas time we come back will be over 1300.
We're going to wait till we get 4 million people on this thing.
Okay.
I think the whole audience has already voted at least once, maybe twice.
Now if we could just...
Oh, oh.
Tell you one of those, you know.
What's the hour?
How's that?
One fart an hour.
Well, so when you have your big meeting with Jolly Joe as you come to your last couple days and say,
oh, let's talk on Thursday Friday.
No.
No.
No.
What's he waiting for?
The 22th of April for crying out loud and you've only got to January to figure this damn thing out.
What else are you waiting for?
Hey, what are you doing for George tomorrow?
What?
It's administrative assistant day.
Don't help me.
How do you tolerate him?
How do you tolerate being in the same building?
I pay for breakfast.
Let's try and teach tips of how he goes.
How do you tolerate?
He does.
Yeah.
He makes the call.
He makes the call.
He goes, again, the kind of money you are in.
George lets you tip the food people.
I give him money.
Not enough.
I assure hope so.
I don't have enough.
Yeah, Mother's needs some money, okay?
So when he's at the Wii from Friday, he's at Gulf Stream.
Bring him a big suitcase of the same.
COME IN, programming it.
Plenty of ass would be either one.
I'll convert it to money one way or another.
Help me look!
Biggest name!
Oh, big stout!
You're his new Rogers.
We're coming to fight.
I'm gonna get you.
I am the fourth leader.
The brokers on Wall Street don't know it yet,
but a fair market is coming to get them.
One, two, bad news for you.
Three, four profits out the door.
A nightmare on Wall Street.
Five, six, better self-quake.
Seven, eight, cut the interest rate.
Terror on the training floor has stocks
plugged into the gaff sum.
Hell.
Oh, hell, hell, hell, please.
A nightmare on Wall Street in portfolios everywhere.
Line 10, I broke again.
Well, you broke through that barrier, Chris.
You got 13.04.
How do you like that?
Oh, right.
Bless you.
What was it?
Bless you.
Oh, I'm not gonna story about him.
Thanks to Brandon.
An update on your favorite little news queen.
I remember that.
My colleague got him cursed to my colleague.
Oh, my God.
As long as I live.
You know, Aaron's got a great show.
Yeah.
Hey, boy, what's that in your mouth?
Four months after leaving WFOR, CBS4 for Columbia,
Ryan Andrews is landed in permanent gig
with Columbia's largest TV network, RCN.
Well, I bet she she's had a real good town there.
We're running out of material, folks.
Were that talking about women?
No.
He'll produce a series called Columbia through my eyes,
and it'll be basically driving all over the country
for the next two months, stopping off in small towns
along the way, telling unique stories,
and likely picking up male hitchhikers.
Maybe some runaways.
And you know who'd be interested in taking the sloppover?
Roman camp.
Roman camp.
Also in a few months, Brian will begin anchoring Columbia now
RCN's first daily English language newscast.
He's also freelancing for Al Jazeera,
and says on his blog, Columbia's Samana magazine
is interested in a daily web-based English newscast.
Were that talking about women?
Yeah, we know already.
I like that, so there's little Brian Andrews
who really made his mark.
Not.
He was on CNN for about five minutes,
and even they couldn't handle it.
They said we can put Ricky Tiki's sands here,
because we know he's a hyperventilating lunatic.
And a maniac.
But other than that, the little Brian,
I don't know what that was all about.
Come on, get out of bed.
In fact, I think Anderson Pooper,
he fulfills the quote of there on CNN.
And of course, what's his name with the vest, Ali Felchin?
Oh, yeah.
I didn't know they had it that's enough.
That's enough.
Yeah, host on CNN.
13 or something.
Probably wolf blitzky would like to burn them
in an oven somewhere.
Can you imagine?
Nope, not too bad, dude.
You picking on the Pope again?
I've heard you've heard?
William Donho is going to come at you.
For what?
For picking on the Pope.
I'm not talking about the Pope.
I'm talking about wolf blitzky.
Oh, that's far-bicin.
I wonder if he's dating Julie Bremen.
Zionist of a feather eat mussels together.
13 or 8 on the survey.
Still fuck tiny man.
Well, nobody cares.
I'm going to get off.
For no.
Yeah, I was just going to sell my lines.
Twice divorced former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani took communion
at a mass celebrated by the Pope Saturday and my nose is running.
Breaching rules that bar those who re-murry outside the church from doing so.
As he left New York City, Patrick's Cathedral,
but asserted third wife Judith, the failed presidential candidate,
what he went to a Heller campaign to me, confirmed to writers that he took communion
from a priest.
He took communion from a priest.
Oh, my God.
Asked if it was uncomfortable having broken the church ban on the divorce and remurried
taking communion, Giuliani said.
No.
The church doesn't recognize divorce and teaches that divorce Catholics are still
married to their earlier partner unless the church grants him an annulment,
or ruling that the initial marriage was invalid.
Giuliani and Enzo, we know him, did this, he did that.
Despite his Catholic fate, Giuliani's espoused socially liberal political positions
such as back new women's rights to choose an abortion and supporting gay rights,
which is why an Ed party had no chance.
Less than that.
The American Nazi Party.
I voted for Hillary Clinton because...
Donkey, tooth bitch.
I don't know, I just...
I agree with all of these issues that she supports.
Barack Obama, I think the reason that most people are voting for Obama,
they're just ready for a change and sort of tired of the same bodies in Washington.
I'm voting for Hillary Clinton.
I had had very difficult time with this.
I've been making up my mind.
Less of different ways for weeks now.
But at this point, I feel like she is student well qualified.
Oh.
Topping our political ticker today.
It is of course the thing of primary.
Less than seven hours.
Polls closed at eight o'clock in Pennsylvania.
Less than seven hours is right.
Six hours and 38 minutes, not done counting.
And I'll be prompt on my couch with my vix.
And some real cough drops, you know.
Right.
They don't give you the...
They don't give me the runs and the promotion.
It wasn't just...
I mean, that was part of it, of course.
But it was way beyond that.
It was like a rumbling and a discomfort like my inside was stretching.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Last year, a pro-beteed reform that Catholics who divorced and we may not receive communion
unless they have stayed from sexual relations with their new partner.
Ah!
Careful.
Careful.
Careful.
Watch out.
Wow.
I know.
That is his spirit stand up.
What a joke.
See, only the priest can have sex and usually with like little boys.
Okay, that's okay.
And once in a while, little girl just to keep that balance.
It's hard like a hundred boys.
Hardly balanced girl.
Okay, yeah, it was good to say.
A little outside.
But you know what I mean?
Just to make her look kosher.
Everything is okay and appreciative, baby, in the rectumry.
Whatever they want to do and then they cover it up and they move them all around the deal.
But everybody else, oh don't you do that!
Don't you touch nurse and oh yeah, right.
Cox a hoist, pops.
U.S. clergy tend to leave it up to individual personers who are divorced to be framed and contained communion instead of excluding them from the sacred right.
Catholics believe that during master communion, host and wine are transformed into the body and blood of Christ.
I know that sounds really bizarre and it is but never worth.
They're eaten up on the booty.
Saturday's master Pope consecrated bread and wine that was distributed to the congregation by the priest.
Julianne didn't take communion from the Pope himself.
Thanks God.
What a pope would be that like unclean.
During the presidential campaign Julianne said he had some very very strong views on religion that come from having wanted to be a priest when he was younger and studying theology for four years in college.
Among other politicians who attended the Mass was Cornelius city mayor Michael Bloomberg who no kidding is Jewish, it says.
Oh, what a revelation, that name like that?
Yeah, what name like Oliver Hirish?
Oh, he veys me and on pace off no less, they didn't take communion.
I don't know what it made sense from the take communion, they had to put that in a story.
Right.
This is the news media for a man, they're all a bunch of crazy people, great robbers, lunatics, just like us.
1313 on the survey, 12 Chalimon, 13 Colombians, 15 Jamaicans, 15 Haitians, 17 Ricans, 19 Injans.
Remember that song?
One little, two little, 19 Injans?
Mm-hmm.
Three Mexicans on the bottom.
Nicaragua in 6 and Japanese 7, Georgia's favorite.
Yep.
You said you're fireish for my favorite, but...
You what is?
I wish.
Why is that you like that pasty complexion of the fact that they drink so much?
What is it?
Yeah, not like in the average of course.
I like it when you die.
And these things.
The pasty complexion?
Yep.
I like that, I like the big drink.
That's what they always like.
They always like to have a lot of fun.
Sure.
Maybe the footsy's got a red nose, he's been eating too many hamburgers.
That could be.
He's doing, I'm sure, a personal...
Yeah.
...soft food or search from town to town, from pillar to post.
To find the best burger in town.
And it wouldn't surprise me if the best burger in soft food is in Tutsi's nose.
Maybe the biggest burger.
That red nose.
He looks like Rudolph on a bad day.
Now when I see something like Tipple near you, you still have that big red nose.
Oh, he's in the head to me.
Drunk.
I mean, I could be wrong.
WC feels had a big red nose.
Drunk Winston Churchill.
Linesline Churchill.
He was a drunk.
Of course.
No, his sister, he was an Irish.
Was he an Irishman?
Or the Englishman?
Just a drunk in Englishman.
Right.
And of course over there they drink their ale, you know, pints of ale.
Just big boosers, you know.
And of course you'd have to be.
When they go to Amsterdam on a weekend, they're all drunk and loud and rowdy and obnoxious.
Just because they want to make sure you realize that they're brits.
1350s are gold today to get to that.
And then of course the rest of the week, I'm not how long we'll leave this up there.
Now remember we're short in today, so.
Were what?
They have a shorter show today.
Well, I forgot about that.
Let's do the break.
The three oldest names.
The best out here is no projects.
435.
62 AM.
The sports leader.
He's 50 dollars.
This is Larry King Live in Washington.
Larry, it's an honor to be on your show.
Thank you.
I have to ask you this question.
I heard that you're well.
Oh, yeah.
Could you prove it?
Okay.
Holy crap.
What's the big one?
Have you ever seen anything like this?
Only once at the San Diego Zoo.
It made me sick.
How much is it weighs?
62 million pounds, I guess.
Now I understand where you wear suspenders.
We'll be right back.
I'm Larry King Live.
Don't go away.
Okay, 131.
Let's do another break in a minute here.
Not right now, but...
You screwed up, mate.
You could...
Forget to remind me.
Well, I forgot to remind you.
You're both forgetting them all.
Yeah, I thought I was fooling.
I forgot to remind Chris.
You can't even get in my mind.
Even in his spots, and we got like 14 minutes before the press conference.
The office press conference coming up at 145.
Any interest?
No.
And what's this?
I'm going to hand it off to Jerk.
So what... what in God's name are you talking about?
That was one of the options that the Clarence, you know, laid out.
He laid out?
Yeah.
That's what he did.
So what is it we're going to do after last week?
They're going to tell us when they're approaching the podium,
and we're just going to throw it to them,
and then they're going to handle it from there.
They're going to handle it?
Somehow.
They got rubber gloves on.
That was you.
I wouldn't like Clarence handle it.
Could be wrong, but...
I don't think so.
Here's got rough hands.
Relip, uh...
Maybe he'll bring some new equipment.
1321 on Chris's pull.
It's still 12 Chinese money.
Yeah, I think we better do the second break, because otherwise...
I mean, I hate to do it this way, but you guys screwed me all up.
What the heck?
The best talent you've ever had in a long time.
You're a 2560 QAM.
The S4th leader.
And a 535.
Three sons like the Mora.
Yes, and a half.
Every time you speak,
just the way God wants you to speak.
He wants to take a city,
and cover it in the sweet.
Rainnaging, can't.
Rainnaging, can't.
Rainnaging, can't.
Rainnaging, can't.
Curse he wants to make new Orleans peace.
And I don't care what people are saying.
Sounds like Jesse Jackson.
We as black people.
His comments are bizarre.
Surely God is mad.
He compares the vocals to a really gongka-bong.
Shocked.
Rainnaging, can't.
Yes, Rainnaging, can't.
Rainnaging, can't.
Rainnaging, can't.
Rainnaging, can't.
Rainnaging, can't.
It's time for us to come together.
It's time for us to rebuild a New Orleans.
The one that should be uptown or wherever they are.
This city will be chocolate.
A chocolate in the world.
He never takes the blame for anything he says.
Chocolate at the end of the day.
He never takes the blame for anything he says.
Rainnaging, can't.
Rainnaging, can't.
No, I can't.
Rainnaging, can't.
He wants to make new Orleans peace.
You can't have New Orleans no other way.
It wasn't the New Orleans.
No other way.
Okay, 139.
And of course, the big press conference.
These last few minutes, this has been an abortion, you know?
Yeah.
This has been really bad.
And the first pick.
Dolphins will select Michigan Offensive Tackle Jake Long.
That's where the press conference is to announce.
We always have press conferences to announce things that are anti-climactic.
That all already everybody knows.
Hey, hey, don't argue.
They have the news conference of 145 to announce an agreement in terms of offensive tackle Jake Long.
Who will become the first lesson this year's NFL Draft on Saturday.
After two weeks of negotiations, centered solely around long.
I think that's answering the question is Jake Long.
Remember Jake Scott?
Remember him, Chris?
I know the name.
Agent Tom Cunningham with offensive recidile level avoid what could have been a potentially messy holdout
had the negotiations last to be on Saturday's draft.
The decision to focus on long, occurred largely as a result of in-depth research.
In the risk involved with selecting a tackle during the first round.
The team's findings during that breakdown of past tackles have led them toward feeling more comfortable
about the prospect of selecting long or research prospects of defensive ends Chris Long and Vernon Goldstein.
They just know they want somebody who is long.
There you go.
Can we all get long?
So that's what they're going to announce and we're going to get out of here in four minutes and eight seconds.
So what's the deal now?
With what?
Take that break as you will fill it.
Oh, no, we've got to do another break.
No, no, no, we've done all breaks.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
We're done.
We're done.
We did all breaks.
What are you talking about?
Like I said, when we first said it, I moved the last break up.
So we've done all of our breaks.
I wonder if those breaks seem like the end of the world, like on and on.
And I'm looking at them.
I wonder why you went so early to it.
Why?
That's why I wondered why you went so early to that last one.
Because you're not communicating well because you're a toad.
That would be it.
And George told me 1330 on your survey.
You're not going to get to 1350.
I think we've exhausted the audience.
We got 12 Chinese, I know.
Pretty deep.
Flayed me to look at that thing and see the way that the ethnic people have just abandoned us like we had leprosy.
And what's the clearance worried about?
Oh, we got a press conference with the dolphins.
We don't want to get the dolphins upset.
We got to put on Jake along.
Idiot.
Total absolute idiot.
But that's what we're dealing with.
As you well know, the jockocracy.
Oh, I sure like to smell that jock.
Pungent.
Yeah.
The aroma puts you in a nutty.
Musty and musky.
Remember Ed Musky?
He was crying.
You don't remember Ed Musky?
No.
Who was crying about they picked on his wife during the campaign in 72 and he didn't get the nomination.
Guys who cry generally don't get picked, you know?
Is that right?
Not very much, oh.
No, it wasn't much, it was the needle.
Of course when Sori got all teared up, that was okay.
That was okay for her.
Oh yeah, that was fine because it made her like almost human, almost big, the operative term.
I'm scouring there to see what's going on in Pennsylvania, but not much information about these sides of the turnout or, you know, is Jake Long or anything like that?
So here I sit with my hanky.
Yeah.
I'll broken hearted.
I might know, is yeah, I'll broken hearted.
It didn't farted though.
I don't want to get joystripe before we do this stuff and Ed.
It wasn't illegal, I just get up and walk out of here now.
Yep.
Just walk away.
Now?
No, not yet.
Oh, Jurch is going to be around after this thing is over.
He can confabulate about this whole deal.
Because I don't know anything about Jake Long or any of that stuff.
I don't want to say crap.
Do you know anything about Jake Long?
George?
Nope.
Let me see his picture again on here.
See if he looks pretty good.
I mean, at least I could drive.
You know, on that team, they got so many ugly guys.
Couldn't they like once, just once?
That's why they didn't want Brady Quinn.
He looked too good.
They don't like that.
Let's see.
Dolphins take a shot with Jake Long.
There it is.
Well, he's got the helmet on.
Yeah, you can't really tell.
It looks like he's got a beak, you know, like a bird.
Okay.
But you can't tell him the helmet is on.
And he's got that uniform.
And he's got tattoos all over too.
He's got a big husky left arm.
I bet you have a big, I bet you have a big, oh, rock solid.
Has measured with calipers the size of those arms.
You know, when they do that NFL combine?
No, I don't.
Oh yeah.
And they measure all the body parts of the, uh, Jurch.
Do they really?
Oh yes.
That's why the big old ghost there every year.
He even used to pay his own way.
Now, Jolly Joe, who doesn't want to pay anybody else.
But he pays for, uh, the big old to go there.
Because it's important crap.
He'll be in New York for the draft this afternoon.
Well, there you go.
See what I mean?
He's a real jock sniffer.
A real fart smeller.
So, now, let me just turn on here.
We got 50 million sports channels.
Maybe one of them thinks this is important.
I doubt it.
Because it has nothing to do with hockey.
Or the blue jays.
Well, there's fish TV.
Sports net connected.
Now, they got Sam Mitchell.
Well, let's see.
I don't know.
They're in commercial break.
Tennis.
You want to hear some tennis on the radio?
Oh, sure.
A couple of Russian guys with names I can't pronounce.
Or check, maybe.
I don't know.
Check's in the mail.
The score.
The thing, maybe, on the score, it'll be.
Player, there's no question about it.
He's a great player that the team that he came up with
and has broken into and become great with is decided now
to cut him loose and trade him.
Uh, that is...
No, that ain't it.
And that's probably some hockey crap.
You're all obsessive they are here.
Well, where might it be?
It could be on TSN.
What do you think?
The sports network?
What do you think?
I don't know.
I don't know where to find the sports covering.
We got tennis on now.
They're not going to interrupt the tennis for that.
Let's see about the other feed.
Oh, I don't have it in here.
I have it in the other room.
Maybe I'll go in the other room and turn it off for your loud.
There you go.
So, what's the story now?
Do we have somebody there?
We have an engineer there that's...
Well, that doesn't have a...
That's one other way.
If we have an engineer...
I don't think we have any...
We probably have a reporter out there,
but nobody that's going to come on the air to say,
all right, we're ready.
But the engineer tree will tell...
Oh, my God.
...the other people will tell me and then we'll tell you.
And by the time that gets all around,
they'll be halfway through the press conference.
Yep.
For now, something we already know.
It's Jake Law, a baby number one draft pick for your...
You remind me dolphins.
You're one in fifteen dolphins.
Yeah.
And you know what...
You know what two of the smells like, don't you?
I do.
It smells like fish.
So it's already 146.
See, I hate these deals.
What they should do is have somebody out there.
I mean, obviously they have to pay somebody.
They don't want to do that.
Because then they couldn't pay the big O to go to New York for the draft.
They could pay somebody to go out there.
And then, you know, like, give a build up
and he'll be able to see when somebody's approaching the podium
and all these things, you know.
Which generally, when they say,
145, we could be here at two o'clock.
We could be here to, uh, health freezes over.
Well, good thing we already ate.
I didn't.
I got Red Lobster coming up at two.
I'm just going to put my water.
I got to have Dayton first.
I got to go pee.
So we've done all the breaks, all the spots.
Yep.
Everything is out of the way.
Well, you are a crazy person.
I perfectly, we've purposely pushed him back a little bit
so we could get him all in there and...
and you screwed me up.
It's all right.
I know it wasn't intentional.
Not.
I'm not drawing.
I'm not trying to spree you up.
No, that's not what Rebecca said.
She said, look, I didn't read the rest of it.
Look how it was more to that one.
Oh, yeah.
She said Chris is trying to destroy the show.
He's working for, uh, Joel Feinberg.
Damn, she figured it out.
She doesn't know Joel Feinberg in across the street anymore.
But you might be working from anyway.
His daddy might still have a few bucks left after all the mans he lost
with that stupid sports station.
How those other sports stations come in?
The other 45 of them?
Yeah, right.
I hear Ray Perry is running around town with,
with like, uh, sandwich boards.
There's no world in five.
There's no world in five.
The five WFTLs.
So, see, if you would have told me this, I'd have gone home.
I'd have gone the other room and laid down.
Right?
Well, that's why I didn't tell you.
Because this is not the way to run a railroad.
I mean, this is what I was saying.
What do you mean?
You're in the dark.
I'm just talking about how long I was there.
What?
That's how it's going, eh?
How can we not have anybody there?
If this is so important that we got to carry it,
how can we not have anybody there at the site?
At the podium?
With the microphone, killing time, filling time.
Like I'm doing right now.
And God only knows when I'm going to say,
oh, throw it to, uh, who am I going to throw it to?
To, uh, Bill Parcell's probably.
Bill Parcell.
Bill Parcell.
Bill Parcell.
I'm going to throw it to Bill Parcell's.
That Faso, that big tuna.
Well, you can't say that on the dolphin station.
I just said it.
My God.
What did you just turn about 95 Bill Parcell?
He's had some great years, uh, hundreds of years ago.
How come they don't bring back Vince Lombardi?
I think he's kind of dead or George Hallis.
I think he's kind of dead too.
Yeah.
That's what I'm saying.
Just a little bit though.
I'm nothing with the Cubs.
The 60 years of WGN and the Cubs they showed,
Harry's singing, taking out to the ball again.
And they showed some other people, including Mike Dittka.
I have never, I wish I could have recorded that.
You have never heard anything so embarrassing in your life.
Just screening and shouting like a crazy person.
I think I heard like low light though that.
Yeah.
It was low light, sorry.
I'm gonna have to take it up to Lausage.
Uh-oh, careful.
As it's already four minutes past post time.
Just sit on the can while you, uh, you know.
I'm serious.
How long is this going to drag on?
Because you know as well as I do,
any of these press conferences never, ever start on time.
But be a poster second.
We're having all of us just in behind those two.
Well, look at that.
We're missing all the races from the Meadows.
Maybe Dave Polona would another 11 today or something like that.
We missed all the good races from the Meadows and the bad ones too.
And all the screening and pueping calls by Roger.
I'm an Englishist Houston.
Here's the answer to one of the press conferences is going to start.
Got one of them?
It's right since the minute.
Well, sorry, one, four, you know.
It's gonna go up.
Phil or music on the back.
Okay, I can ask.
Post time.
For sure.
You know what this is?
This is the difference there.
That's what this is.
Typically.
Nobody out there.
Now, you guys able to see it?
I'll be carrying it on a local TV.
That's what we're trying to do.
We're gonna give it a shot.
Turn on 4, 6, 7, 10, 23, 51.
No speaking English.
Or got a soap opera.
Yeah.
6 has a soap opera.
Yeah, 7.
Shevon has a mat rock on.
And then has an ad bear commercial.
Maybe you want to stick with him.
Oh my God.
See, it was like a real market.
They have like a sports TV station.
Like you got 8,000 in here.
Maybe sunshine.
What about that?
You got that on your tail?
I don't know what channel sunshine is.
What is it?
I don't know what channel sunshine is.
I just came out of the middle around.
I did what?
I did what?
People are searching for it.
I did what?
My bell scan is there.
30s of the port.
So, you know, I think it's like 35 to 26.
33, 32.
Got it?
Still, I got it.
I found it.
Tell us how we got it.
There's just a picture of an MP podium.
We can answer my question.
Got it?
There it is.
Yeah, boxing.
Boxing?
Boxing.
Oh.
Oh my God.
Florence, I'm going to tell you this.
There's a special place in the hill where your name line is.
Resure for you.
Yeah, I did offer to a cross talk with Jacks.
What is him?
Florence suggesting what we can do to a, you know, fill time, kill time until the press conference starts.
Cross talk about what?
Oh, you know, the log.
You both know your logs.
Yeah.
I see him a few logs.
It's right.
Maybe more than him.
So, in other words, your illustrious program director, he's got a clue.
What's going on over there?
He's not in touch with anybody.
You could end up that sentence way earlier.
Oh, yeah.
Put a period after clue.
152 now.
Seven that has passed post time.
What's your laughing about?
What's his name, Jake?
Claire, it's like my line.
He's a big fan of my words.
A bunch of men ahead will care if you can find a ring.
God, what a moron.
And it would still be bad, but out of day when I was like feeling human and like not sick as a dog.
Ew, this is not the best day.
Not that I'm complaining, you understand.
You do get it.
I get it.
I love it.
It's like 20 and you know where your kids are now.
Do you know where the dolphins are now?
The 115 dolphins.
You know, it's a place of more music.
Eric Kumoro is going to line up for the dolphins.
I'll never forget that day.
Joseph Gackey came on an IOD and said it so breathlessly like it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.
Eric Kumoro is going to line up for the dolphin with that usual illiterate, you know, sound of his.
Joseph Gackey sucks, okay?
That dull sound of his.
Of course, parents works with him so.
Birds of a feather sound dull together.
What?
No nothing.
That's only 153.
One eight minutes past the first time.
What are you?
So what about Channel 10? Do you go back there?
Yeah, I'm flipping over.
Back and forth there.
So in other words, this is so important that none of the local TV stations feel compelled.
To televised it.
Well, you know none of the local TV stations.
Because this anti-climatic thing, like everybody here on this radio stage.
Exactly what's being announced.
And they're not going to interrupt their regularly schedule programming.
Right.
They're not rubbing you trying to win a minute on themselves like we are here at this station.
And are we, I mean them?
What are you battling about?
Nothing.
And what's going to happen to go with the ball?
Well, we can put it in jerks just fine hands or two.
Yep.
And then he can kill about a half an hour.
Because if there's one thing we've learned over the years that every time,
like they had a threat of a transit strike here.
Yeah, over the weekend in Toronto.
And supposedly the deadline for negotiations was four o'clock on Sunday for two hours.
On city calls, they showed the podium with a whole bunch of microphones and a bunch of engineers running around.
And so they finally came out and said, oh, we reached the agreement. No strike.
Two hours.
And if you think I'm sitting here another two hours, man.
See, you gave me a false sense of hope.
I didn't give a false sense of hope.
How did I get his fault either?
Because you saw we're out of here early 145. That's why we were all told.
You came in here like breathless.
Well, he used you how that he lies like a bandit.
Josh came in and you believe anything he would say?
Like Mad Dog says, we wouldn't believe anything he would say if his tongue was notarized.
Florence.
He came in there.
First of all, what else he'd do in there?
Program directed.
Yeah, plan PD, huh?
Oh my god.
I mean, I got a lot of stuff here.
I got a great story of super delegates, and I'll clean this parade.
Yeah, well, read it slow.
I don't have time to do it because in the middle of like the first sentence, you're going to say, oh, we got to go to the press conference or something like that.
Hey, that'd be a good way to get it to start.
Wow.
Susan Lucci looks old.
Susan Lucci is not really pretty.
Don't tell Fiki Carlos that. He'll punch in a sack.
Oh well.
Grab your share a long time and it's on Channel 10 and wow, she looks bad.
He's ancient.
Well, that's what happens when you don't see somebody for 30 years.
Now, what's the deal?
You know what?
This is it.
This is the deal.
Hold your breath.
Hurry up and wait.
Hurry up and wait for what?
Press conference, whether they're going to make an announcement that we already know what it is.
That's right.
I mean, all I had to do was go to the Harold website, which anybody else could do with half a brain, like clearance.
I mean, half a brain.
1340 on a survey, very, very slow.
And that's because clearance and joys and jolly Joe have destroyed the show.
But that's okay.
We got another five and two two years ago.
As long as those checks keep coming, George wants a big fat raise.
No questions asked.
He's got a family to support.
He's right on the other people's side.
He's, you know, Dillon.
Hey, they don't cost money.
They don't cost money.
All my hobbies are, you know, they pay for themselves.
All the expensive weed you got.
They pay for themselves, all my hobbies, except for the roller skating.
156, we're 11 minutes past post time.
Well, it's the rollercoaster of Jason.
What?
We've always just thought to Jason early.
Why would I want to do that?
I'm not going to like put the ball in his hands.
He probably had slam a jam.
Go ahead.
Put the ball in his hands.
Believe me.
Because then we'll start talking about that crap again.
Maybe he'll dribble it.
I hope not.
I've been dribbling myself here the last 24 hours.
Mostly it's a nose.
It's a nose, thank God.
Not the hose, the nose.
157, it's coming up in 20 seconds.
So what do we do here?
We're doing it.
This is what we do.
This is something this is so incredibly bush league, so embarrassing,
so absolutely unacceptable.
But that's clearance, man.
It's a little boy radio.
There are two ways to do things in this business.
There's the right way and there's the clearance way.
Which at least he's consistent because it's always.
Not usually, not most of the time, it's always the wrong way.
I could spend some more wax.
Some more beach boys in my ass.
Okay.
Here's some of this pinwheel.
I mean, it started with running 85 minutes of sponsored
about 20 minutes.
Yeah, that's right.
This is not for our staff.
This is just spin cycle.
Yeah, he's been the dreidel.
He's the Canadian and spin the dreidel.
And then take a ladle and get some chicken soup.
That's what I could use, you know?
Yeah.
Although I think that clam chowder, red lobster,
will do me good today, don't you?
I do.
Although I don't know, because it's like milk based.
Yeah, you know, that I just thought of that before.
I have some chicken soup.
Now, to clear you right out.
Listen, if you think I'm going to argue about where I'm having lunch today,
the fact that I'm being honored two days in a row with lunch appearance?
Okay.
You just don't get it.
See, once upon a time I had a rich full life as Mr. Ego would say,
once upon a time I had a-
Oh, there's Oliver.
He's still a baby, baby.
What?
Rich full life.
No, sure it is.
Just go get you.
Just go back to my home.
I'll be a lot better.
Give me that Chinese-a-Canadian guy.
There you go.
I'll tell you one thing if I did.
Boy, some people had never seen me again.
I don't want to mention any names, but-
Right, but-
I can't.
Puto.
Puto and Puto.
Puto and Puto.
For the family, you just sent me a message saying he would see me at 2.15.
And I said, here or up there, he writes back, yes.
Well, I guess-
I guess it's either one of the above.
I'm- I'll wait here.
I'll wait.
And if nobody shows up, I'll take an half.
I apologize to the audience for this abortion.
Probably we had a whole bunch of right-to-life people picketing outside of the studio.
The anti-abortion crowd, the fetus huggers, because this has been for 30-
about 40 minutes now.
An absolute total abortion.
Yep, but-
But-
I'm gonna follow this.
I mean, I would even do this to jerks.
Yeah.
I wouldn't without his log.
Am I gonna play the legal ID?
Yeah.
You utter.
Fother.
Oh my god.
I'll do it right on time though.
You know how-
That's right.
It would be punctual.
Mm-hmm.
And the really bad news is our total on tabulation on that thing is 1340.
That's where it stopped.
That's- that's the audience.
That's what Clarence has left us with 1340 listeners.
Thank you, Clarence.
You jackass.
You cymbled him.
You far-bisoned.
You jack-sniffing and looking idiot.
I bet you he's the guy who's gonna go in the locker room and find out it is Jake Long.
Wouldn't surprise me.
I think they draw straws for the owner.
Yeah.
Something like- looks like a straw.
The biggest names of this calendar.
How about that?
And you're told from I am a Dovens football.
Sports radio 560 WQAM.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
