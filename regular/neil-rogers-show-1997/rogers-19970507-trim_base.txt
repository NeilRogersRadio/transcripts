Right.
610 WIOD, Neil Rogers, while you're goofing off, it works.
So what kind of a non-sequitur was that as an excuse to take a shot?
What the hell was that?
610 WIOD.
You call that a born-again penis?
It doesn't lick them.
610 WIOD.
Same pack, Clinton, done with it all.
Shored ball and Jones, his trousers, trouts.
He said, honey, will you partake?
Come on and kiss my one-eye snake.
He says, no, she says yes.
And she could prove it if he'll untrust.
We'll find out who's right or wrong.
Let's see, let's see, let's see, let's get shot.
Let's see, let's see, let's see, let's get shot.
Just lick up.
Just lick up.
I like it.
Let's see, let's see, let's get shot.
What's it gonna take?
Two shepherds right way more on this Jones.
I asked you up here to thank you for the knob job you've been doing
in my re-election campaign for the State of Arkansas.
Excuse me, Governor?
What I mean is, don't blow job security by going down
to the private sector.
I'm afraid I don't follow you, sir.
I don't care, I'm gonna slap with JFK.
Org, have a damn, if Cooper was gay.
This lack of dignity gives me fits.
What the hell now?
Hey, Hillary, show us your sex.
Let's see, let's see, let's see, let's get shot.
Thank you, April.
I'm just gonna miss your best commandant.
Let's see, let's see, let's get shot.
What were you gonna take?
Two shepherds right way more on this Jones.
Let's go out of line.
And if we won't be gone, boy, we'll be gone.
I had a nickname day, one day she flew away.
Oi, to Tijuana where the moon is blue.
The moon is blue.
But with our right wing censorship, there are words that mustn't slip.
To truly tell you how I feel for gay.
That's gay for gay.
So, is this K&G?
I'll see you with Tijuana too.
Now if you see K, tell her I'm a Surrey State.
And the FCC won't let me sing this.
So, I'll roll to the day now if you see K, take her hand, gently say.
That after this transmission, I'll be out in 90 days.
Oh, is you see K&G?
Then I'll see you with Tijuana.
Go, but gotta see you with Tijuana too.
Oh!
10-04, W-I-O-D, happy Wednesday to all and to all a great day.
Man, is this a day or is this a day?
Hansen, other day as we continue counting them down.
A Dindva, et cetera.
Chitiri, Piaach.
Don't start with that Russian crab, man.
Fidel's gonna know what it's all about.
Don't tell me Miri's making more changes to that log again.
God, we wouldn't want to be doing that.
Home Depot's fault.
Yeah, well don't be having all that stuff fall down, please.
So, at any rate, I'm gonna, I lied.
I said I was never gonna mention it.
Well, I don't have to mention her name on here, do I?
Ms. Antichrist, Walter Sabo's other quarter, whatever the hell she is.
By the way, she is very cute.
Just ask her, she'll tell you on the ear.
She's cute.
Do you think she's cute?
I think she's like a nondescript.
I think it would be the best compliment I could pay with being nondescript.
That's a high compliment.
Exactly.
But at any rate, so last night was the definitive, I mean, I just, I'm bursting at the seams.
I could sit here and ramble on for four hours and I just might.
I just might do it because I'm like really just bursting like I said at the, at the thing today.
I heard last night the definitive, the, the, I mean, it was the Walter Sabo Harry Penis format to a T
and it was enough to make you either scream, laugh, cry or all of them.
So yesterday, of course, Rick was off for his birthday.
Don't do it again soon, Rick.
Now while I'm still here and Rick was on a course and Brooke, we love, we like Brooke, don't we?
Yeah, we like Brooke.
But at any rate, so they moved everybody up on a schedule and we had the unmentionedable one from six to nine and ski for M ski, whatever his name is for nine of midnight.
So Karen, what's her name is on her last night and she's, she's doing this Sabo formula where she takes one little article from the book.
And then she's going to get the news paper.
Remember the one about the engagement ring.
Of course, did that guy ever get the nine grand back or the ring or boat?
We don't know.
In Kansas, let's find out.
Let's talk about that today.
What do you think?
W-I-O-D.
Hello.
You think you ought to get the money back or what?
Yeah.
Okay. Thank you.
So at any rate, she goes on, she's got this story about these two dicks that want to adopt a kid who's like retarded that nobody else wants.
He's in a foster home and she's reading this little blurb out of the newspaper.
I mean, this formula, it's unbelievable.
You take a little kind of like sidebar story that nobody really gives all that much of a crap about and you make a show out of it and you insist and you keep reading it and reading it and reading it and reading it and banging it and pounding it and clanging it and just insisting.
You're going to talk about this even if you're all gone, even if everybody turned it off, you're still going to talk about it.
God damn it.
Oh, by the way, Roger Crotch is quoted the week.
Did you see this?
George, you see this this week?
Yes.
I love it.
By the way, I like it a lot though.
I think it fits into a tea like a glove, like a rubber glove.
Roger's quoted the week is the best way to get back at your enemies is with tremendous success.
End of quote.
We plan on it, Roger.
So at any rate, there's like no calls.
So I'm like mesmerized.
I'm in the car, but it's one of those deals where you don't want to get out of the car.
Not because it's entertaining, not because it's interesting, not because it's fascinating, but because it is so embarrassing.
I'm just asking myself, how can this be?
And she's like training these other underlings, these other people who don't belong on here.
She's training them in the formatics of this.
It's like talk radio in a box.
It's like, you know how you have like instant tea and instant coffee and you put them in a cup and you just add hot, hot boiling water.
Just take any one of these goofballs off the street, especially if they happen to be the girlfriend of the consultant and put them on here and put hot boiling water and all of a sudden,
pull if they're a talk host or host this as the case may be.
And she's going on and on and so I think this is just, this is just ridiculous.
I mean, if they are loving family, if they want to adopt this, okay, 6222 WIOD, 767.
And on and on and I would just with this dribble with this dribble and I'm thinking of myself in my wildest nightmares I could never have believed.
And I'm also that little part of my mind is thinking how close I came to sticking around this joint.
I mean, this is like something out of an insane asylum.
I mean, is this really their idea of something that's going to work in this market where we've had all the kind of talk that we've had for the last 20 some years, 30 some years going back to Alan Courtney rest in pieces and the dean and all these other everything that's going down to pike and they think that they can pedal this half baked bunch of bull crap.
That somebody is fooling somebody that you take something out of the paper and just keep reading it over and over and over and over again and insisting.
So finally, just before I was going to get out of the car finally, some anal retentive Julio calls in named Javier.
I sure hope you're listening Javier, but I'm sure you're not.
Javier. I'll never forget this guy's long as I live and he's going on.
Of course, he's obviously the expert on facts and he's going on about well, this is unnatural and it's against God's law.
And it's there's no love involved there. It's just lust. It's only lust and she gave him kind of a half baked very weak answer because first of all as soon as you hear that it's the voice of a Julio and his name was Javier, you know that he's a victim of brainwashing from the time he was born about those evil facts,
even though he's probably been rubbing up against trees and guys and whatever he can when his wife ain't looking.
Oh, he has a wife, you know, but at any rate.
And so then when it gets to the end after we finally get rid of Javier, it's like, Oh, am I the only one? Am I the radical one to down here?
Yeah, your radical caraners, nobody else down here to the left of a till of the hunt.
This is the first time that anybody has dared to express such an opinion in the history of talk radio in this town.
It's all new. It's all revolutionary. We're a guest. We just can't believe it.
We're sitting here almost speechless. Now, are they doing like real? You can tell me this. Are they doing extensive like heavy duty screening on those shows?
Is this also part of the formula of the calls? Yes.
Because I knowing this audience the way I do and I know I'm like the palm of my foot.
I cannot believe that there is nobody out there calling her or some of these people and saying,
will you get off this already? Don't you understand? You've been banging it for 40 minutes and nobody cares.
Don't you get it? Who are you kidding, man? With this phony instant talk formula of yours, man. Nobody cares. Nobody gives a crap.
And I'm thinking to myself, are these people really that dumb that they don't understand that if you take one narrow little tiny thing and you keep and you say,
this is all we're going to keep banging this. We don't want to hear nothing else. This is all we're going to talk about that it's like the great.
It's like sending an engraved invitation to everybody who might be in the audience saying, hey, goodbye because we got nothing here.
You're going to want to hear about. It is unfreaking believable. What am I so exercised about here today?
I don't know. I'm just I'm just almost in disbelief that anybody could be this dumb as this crowd.
It's just amazing when you think of all the people that we've had in the Phil Henry's and you know,
some of the other and even Uga Buga, the people that worked and sweated their brains and their balls off in this place.
And now it's come to this to this Kassimmi, Florida formula with the boy at the hot boiling water.
And by the way, guess who the latest rumors are that it's going to be doing midday if they were finally say goodbye to me.
Just tell me what your problem is. I don't think I can handle that.
So what do you think about this? What's the guy's name Chuck Humphrey that off himself, the heavens gate guys who are like they waited.
They had to leave their what do they call it? Their vehicles. They had to destroy their vehicle so they could move into Uranus and do their thing.
Okay. Unbelievable. CNN's having a field. They were there by the way. They've had these video tape things that they left behind.
They've had them on like morning noon and night over and over again. More of these good, religious man who are waiting to leave their vehicles and move there into outer space to other thing out of your vehicle and into your in Uranus.
In fact, remember that out of the closet into the streets. Ellen should be screaming out of your vehicle into Uranus.
That's the new deal with the heavens gate heavens, call whatever another one of these stupid religions just like all the other ones.
Hey, Javier, how you doing? If Javier calls by the way, we'll put him on immediately, but he don't have the balls to do it.
He's listening. We know you're listening, Javier. You're probably a closet queen too.
Someone called to say that they're filming a Wendy's commercial in the Grove and Dave from Wendy's is listening to us right now.
Dave Thomas from Wendy's is listening right now. Yes. Well, guess what Dave Thomas? I love your food. You got great food of all the fast food joints. You got the best, but, but how about hiring some like people with an IQ bigger than their shoe size?
Okay. I realize we have a lot of this EEO E whatever the hell they call it these days. A lot of pressures to hire like certain minorities in your joints, but it would be very nice.
It's just one time, just one time to drive away from one of your establishments and find about a mile down the road when you open up the sack that the stuff is in there that you ordered.
I mean, it's even in the same family. Okay. We'll be very nice Dave. So we love your product, but we hate your help. How do you like that?
Including the one out there by the sawgrass by me and the one over here on Hollywood, and the one on Hollywood Boulevard where they really boned us big time that first time.
Sure did. And then we're going to make up for it with free food, which they never did. Not that we would snore for free food, but we will, especially those chicken clubs.
Right. Spice. Especially those atkins. And we do also appreciate the fact that Wendy's is the one place where they'll give you the stuff like Atkins style without the bun.
So we appreciate that Dave. We love Wendy's, but all your help really blows. Okay. If you actually had some help in there that knew what they were doing, you'd probably triple your business Dave.
And by the way, lose some weight, will you?
Hey, it's kind of like Brooke. You know, he's a nice, but could afford to lose a few pounds 10 14 at W. I. D. Just like me could afford to lose 50 pounds.
Hey, listen, speaking of losing something, if you're losing your hair guys, you know, a lot of young guys lose their hair. And it's like embarrassing, you know, you're like 25 years old. And you got this gigantic ball spot.
Maybe you know, you got Wayne's money, right? Sure, likely story, but you don't want to look like Wayne, even if you had his money, you don't want the Zits.
You don't want that gigantic ball spot. It's out when telly. Sevalas died. They put the rest of the ball. Look. So if you want to look great at a price that you can afford,
headed Charles Alphiery for just 800 bucks. He can make your hair look like it's growing right out of your scalp with the best, most natural looking system anywhere in the universe.
And Charles knows that the real secret of any natural looking system is regular servicing. That's why service visits at the Charles Alphiery Studios are affordably priced at only 25 bucks, not 60 bucks like the other joint soke you.

We've replaced the tire of old morning show with a tired new morning show. My account said to me, do you have any receipts? Like, what do you think?
I go, let's make some up now, but don't think that I'm collecting things when I'm driving places. Yes, I spend $12 for gas. You don't say that? I don't say anything.
I have a little bag that I just dropped the receipt. I get a little bag too, but I'm taking stuff out of it.
Ron and Ron, 610 W I O D. The opinions expressed on W I O D are those of Neil Rogers. How can people believe this crap? You know what? There are other opinions.
Not for long. 610 W I O D.
There's day all around. There's day all around. On W I O D. Go ahead.
1018 W I O D were reinventing talk radio or reinventing a boredom or reinventing stuff that is so hackneyed and so tried and so unbelievable that there are no words to describe it. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello.
W Diento Vardes, Cacti Pogevae, Shivordna. Great.
Yes. Why are we even getting upset over? I didn't say I was upset. I'm just worked up. Not upset. There's a difference. I'm not upset. I'm just amazed and astonished and shocked and almost speechless.
Well, Neil, from now on I'm going to switch to dial over to 1400 and listen to Craig. Great. Because it's just it's ponderous and terminal. Have you ever heard anything like it in your life?
I mean, it's so it's so obvious even a child can hear what this attempt is to this formula. Take take a little article. Get it on a year. This is your topic and just keep reading it over and over and over and beating it and pounding it and clanging it and and just championing it and screaming about it.
And even if nobody in the world gives a crap, it's just that's it. Man, that's it. I don't know when they find that no one's listening.
Believe me, trust me when I tell you they will. They will this place is going to old points before long and but it won't matter because you'll be long gone and someone listeners. Hopefully Rick and Fletzel end up someplace.
Yeah, that well actually though, I don't think Rick and Fletz can stay on this station. I'll just turn the dial at night.
Okay. Have a great day and thanks for calling 610 W I O D. Yes. Yes. May I call for a two. We have an open line at day at 622 all three. Broward lines are open 767 9463. We had every line on the air lift for a couple of seconds. This is the deal this week. I guess they must be real busy.
They must be really, really busy. Not landing tonight 9 to 11 also Friday 9 to 11 part 2 only. It's a two part return for the time being big piece in the paper by Deborah Wilker.
No less in the scum central this morning about the return of not landing briefly for four hours this week. Two hours tonight 9 to 11.
Two hours on Friday 9 to 11. Not landing returns. Boy, what a great show. Huh. Could be one of the greatest shows in the history of television. And if you didn't like it, you got no taste.
And what about that Annie on guiding light? What are we going to do about Annie and Riva? Riva is going to jail. And Ross, of course, is going to be prosecuting the case because he's the new district attorney just in time to prosecute Riva for murder and attempted murder and everything else is if we can't see through all of that grab.
On freaking believable and Annie's on her way to the morgue to get that fetus to make sure that nobody can find it. She in fact, I think she's going to stuff it back in.
That would be a good place to hide it. I was asking you that the other day, how long can a woman walk around with a dead fetus and a boarded fetus inside her body without getting serious infection and like going into toxic shock and the croaking.
There have been historic cases of that where the fetus actually became petrified and petrified just thinking about there forever. Yeah, pretty disgusting. Yeah, like it gets home. I'm a fine. That's why we call it a soap opera. Okay. It's only make believe. Thank you, Conway.
Here's a moment was it come a 20 said that or was it Roger Crotch? Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.
Mobile in Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, Neil. I got a one D story. Yeah, listen, I went through the drive through. Okay, Dave Thomas. I'll piss off.
This game. I'm going to Sony. I street foods always excellent. Yeah, what do you want? I think I always take the baked potato instead of the fries.
Okay, what kind of potato? I said a baked potato. What kind of potato? I said, we already told us this story eight million times. Okay.
We have an open line and date six to two. Can you believe this guy? We already heard the same story that this guy's making up six to two W I O D and date.
We have two open lines in Broward seven six seven nine four six three. He's like the guy that called a Rick and Suds with the same. Remember that guy yesterday.
Same story over and over again. And he wants to use the show as a vehicle because he knows Dave Thomas is listening. Okay.
I'm sure Dave in impressed. Okay. By the way, what kind of potato was it? Here's Kendall. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Are you going to watch the heat game tonight? No, I'm not. No, I'm not. I got a fiery port. Yeah.
Pack Cooper is on the Howard Stern show right now. Yeah. Okay. And who cares? How come you're listening to this show? Yeah, exactly.
Okay. Two open lines and date six to two nine four six three to and Broward seven six seven nine four six three seven six seven W I O D.
Pack Cooper. He's pretty exciting. When's Alan King coming on? Here's Miami on a mobile. Hello. Neil. Good morning. Yes, sir.
I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought.
I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought.
I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought.
I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought.
I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought.
I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought.
I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought.
They're shooting something and it's like they're foot. I mean, that rule, that rule is a disaster. But you got to understand at least for the season they're calling that rule.
In fact, Anaheim last night, they had a goal. Their first one just allowed. Then they got a two nothing leading the first.
And then there was two to one. They want to blues in five three. But if that first goal would have counted, they would have had a three nothing leading the way they would have been totally different game. They probably would have won which they did not.
But I mean, that's just the way they're calling it. And these guys are being careless. And while Bill Gehran is skating right through the crease for no reason at all, while Gilmore is sticking the time.
So the Rangers got lucky. But you got to, you know, Richter's playing great. But they're consistent. You know, at least they're consistent with the call.
Yeah, but it sucks. It's the worst rule in the history of sports. Got to stop.
Especially if you're on the opposite side of the goal. I mean, if you're in front of the goalie, that's a different story. And they shoot from the, you know, from the pointer.
Exactly. But if you're on the back side of the goal.
Unless there's interference with a goal tender, the goal should be allowed. And this is, this is a farce. And you got a bunch of hard headed jackasses who insist that this is a great rule to protect the goalie and it's bull crap. And it's destroying. It's destroying the games.
Maybe when we move down the diet, we can make some contact and see if we could petition almost every playoff game.
There's at least one of these goals this allowed because of this stupid and the crease deal.
Yes, sir. Anyways, are you a little more excited about this series now? Or are you still about what series?
Well, about the New York, New Jersey. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm not at all excited. I mean, the devil's to me are boring team.
Philly and Buffalo. That's exciting hockey. And even Edmonton, Colorado as much as one side of this is. Those are exciting teams to watch.
But I mean, watching New Jersey, man, they're just the coma inducing. Well, I'm not. Again, I'm not a New York friend. I wish New York the best. I'd like to see him beat New Jersey because I know Miami's going to beat the next in New York needs something to cheer about.
And by the way, I see the Panthers resigned Kirk Mueller for three more years. Wow. I'm sure excited about that. Can't you tell?
Neil, I love you. Can I can I get a request? Yeah. One of your favorites anything you want to play. Okay, have a great day. Okay enough of the sucking. Have a great day to open lines in day.
622 to W I O D to enbroward 767 one on the mobile one purple line pound I O D. We want to talk today to people who've tried to call some of these other shows.
The formula shows and aren't being put on a year like this last guy who've been told we can't put you on a year because you don't want to play the game.
In fact, that goes back to the heavy, heavy, heavy screening that we were told about months ago, even when nickel was still here when water say, well, first put this plague upon his radio station when he first like stuck his nose into our business.
And then lied about it said, Oh, I never said any of that right. Steve nickel was the liar because he's not here to defend himself anymore. He was the one that was making it all up just like the thing about the wonderful island dreams.
He just made, oh, he didn't just make that up. Mobile one purple line is open pound I O D. It's 1026 at W I O D.

One of your loyal fans called an asterisk. She was the nameless one. Neal talks about and she got so pissed off and made him and I mean insistent.
He repeat what he just said after he repeated it. She told him I wish you would die. Get in a car accident. Have AIDS.
Blood get into your veins and die you bastard. Neal. Does this mean she likes you? She has a big problem. Signed Pascuali.
Okay, we're off to another raging start today just like we were yesterday. It's going to be the same thing all over again. You think it's just ask you during the break. What?
I forgot to ask you during the break. You want norm to drop those tickets by here for your. I'm not going to no ball game. I got to watch Edmonton and Colorado tonight.
Okay, there you go. No, forget it. Norm, I'm not going to some stupid baseball game. The guy who called yesterday was right just because the tickets are free. I mean, it's boring. I'm not interested. Okay.
We have an open line in the purple line pound I OD the mobile one line, which we pay for two and day two and brown. Come on. What do you think? Okay?
Should these lesbian mothers be allowed to adopt that kid? He's in a foster home. He's retarded. Nobody else wants him. These two dicks want to adopt him.

About what about somebody drop of eight in your blood? Yeah. And that was around 10 to nine six to nine between 10 to nine to six.
Nine if you have a tape, you can listen to that. Okay. She said, I wish your car crash and you die. Uh huh. And get aids in your AIDS blood in your veins and die. You bastard. You. Yeah. She said so very uptight. It sounds like to me.
Yeah. For somebody you don't belong on the air extraordinarily uptight broad. Yeah. I don't know what's wrong with her. You know, she was talking about street guys who sell the papers. Yeah. And she said they bothers me. They bothers me. They bothers me. All show one hour. You know. Yeah. And somebody called the same guy call it to her and tell her, you know, they made. They are making living. You know, they are begging. They're making living. Yeah. That's why the Neil call you. Uh, name less or mention less or something.

Open line in a mobile one purple line at pound I O D years homestead. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. I didn't know that you're talking about Karen K when I first started listening to show, but I kind of cut the.
Sir, I'm not just talking about Karen K. I am talking about a devastating destruction that is going on in this place. A so called instant hot formula that's going on here. Just add hot water that is so astonishing and so amazing.
And the phones on this show right now should be blazing off the hook from people who are fat who are just astonished at what's going on in this place. I listen to maybe I'm wrong. Maybe maybe you know something. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this is where it's at.
Uh, maybe I'd have a full board of calls. If I said here, it took some half bake article out of the newspaper this morning and just read it on the year and kept reading it over and over and over again and said, what do you think? What do you think? It kept pumping the numbers out.
I listen to her show yesterday. I mean, I listened to it probably from a six until.
602. Yeah, for a little while. She's talking about the three steps. This was that breast implants. Whatever. And I'm listening to colors. I mean, when when you're in that position, I've never heard a caller rip you apart.
Rip, rip, break and suds apart. I've never heard them rip apart. Person apart like they rip Karen K apart. They ripped her a new ass. Yeah.
I was just astonished. And she just kept like opening yourself up for us. I call my excellent. Okay. We have two open line. Thanks, Walter. Two open lines in Broward 767 9463 767 1 and day 622 mobile 1.
Purple lines open pound I OD to one of your townlines. I guess we're not going to be doing calls on a station anymore because when I listen like at night, I never hear any like maybe one an hour.
So I guess it's kind of like spreading. It's like a disease. It's spreading to the entire radio station. We'll just see her and vent for four hours every day. That's okay with me. That's fine.
That's what you want. Little Italian music, a little bit of venting. Here's the mobile in Hollywood. Hello. Yeah, Neil. Are you aware of any market where in the evening people are able to get good numbers on talk radio because I think they just give up at night.
Oh, do they really I know that I used to have 10 and 11 shares at night here back in the old days and W snooze. I know that Larry King used to have good numbers at night here. I know Alan Courtney used to have like double digit numbers at night. Okay. Well, because I'm a sort of creative. I know that KMO X always has had big numbers at night with whoever they had on the air.
Well, it seems like in this market they've given up. They just know they haven't given up. This is what they really believe is this is it. They really believe in this. Well, they're never honest to God believing this formula. It's not like they really thrown a thrown in the towel. They believe that this Orlando formula, this real radio formula is what talk radio is all about, which proves beyond a shadow of it out when they bought this station. They didn't have any idea what W. I. D. was about or why was successful or why people listen to it. I don't care how many how much research. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't
care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care.

but widely used drug cocktail known as fenn fan
what do you think ok six two two w i d
rower seven six seven thank you so much that we needed that
thank you
there you go there's your topic today for all four hours
fenn fan like it don't like it
before mary linen of quincey mass died in february from a heart and lung
disorder drug maker why a year's laboratory zinc warned doctors that taking its
appetites at present fenn floramine with the com
competing fentermine is not recommended
the combination band in sweeten by the way as popular weight loss centers
like newtris system whose doctors wrote several thousand fenn fan
prescriptions last year company spokesman joseph debar to lamos said

here's mimey springs hello
uh... yeah uh... last night it wasn't her
the other close to the day came afterwards ski for mske yuh well i only got
the ski the rest of it was kind of complicated
uh... driving away down from the route to uh... mental zoo
about uh... thirty minutes yes sir it was not one
phone call we don't take phone calls on the station anymore we've driven a phone
calls all the way
there are no more phone calls well
all we have are people rambling on incessantly about things that nobody cares
about
over his topic was it was astounding yes he was pining away about uh...
fantasies about uh... women that he wanted to bed and that
i guess he did were all ex-girlfriends
i guess they dumped them
uh... i don't know that that's what it sounded like yeah
it was it was going all over and uh...
and he was asking for phone calls but they didn't come in yeah
and that's that seems to be the new format i guess in the course i can relate
to it because i do that every day but i have a different way of solving and i
probably the audience into calling and uh... eventually wind up getting usually
some response
but the idea that you're going to take one little narrow thing and just keep
just keep hammering away at it and banging and twisting and shoving it down
the audience is through and force people to listen and talk about something that
they couldn't obviously give a crap less about it that it's not gonna happen
it ain't gonna happen guys
well i'm going to keep it up
okay
thank you so much so like i said keep it up

died in a wedding dress they're bearing this bitch in her wedding dress
because they put her on fend for the loser way so she could uh... fit into
a wedding dress and god thank the lord she finally fit in
course i guess the body after well it's kind of grotesque isn't a little grotesque
to think of how the body kind of like shrivels a little bit
after you lose all the fluids you know after they drain the fluids out she fits
very nicely in that wedding dress so what are they complaining about god damn it
she went on the diet so she can fit in her wedding dress and she does fit in her
wedding dress so she's in a box what's the big deal that they never promised
a rating about that

controversy which we've already had more than enough contrived controversy in
this market to last a lifetime

league radio station even the mobile one purple line is sitting there dead at pound i would be

game that rule just it's got a stop man it's why didn't they change it before the playoffs i don't
know why doesn't Gary beckman and they had Gary beckman on air by the way that twerp they interviewed
him for about five seconds and he's got nothing to say he's a smuck even a look on frasier
face i mean he looked pain to even go on here he never called it to lines man man was the right
call based on the way they're calling the rule but what what was bill garen thinking about why
is he doing like skating right through the other side of the crease when doggie gillmore is sticking
the time goal in there amazing well you talk about uh but it happens to everybody i'm not going
to knock the rangers for that because it happens there with everybody they didn't have any defense
the last couple minutes there and then steve tomas uh steve tomas had one taken back in game two
the other night again the same thing crazy did you see that one no i did yes steve tomas had a
goal called back because again somebody was in a crease together i think he was a one in a crease

for all these experts around here a call like that is worth 50 million dollars get some jackass on

today is the coming out day that's what Ellen said and that what she said she wants all the
holios to come out of the closet on the meal roger show that's exactly what she said
then we'll lighten up on those bulldox feminists again see the thing that i have a problem with lesbians
about and i've told you this before is that for years they pretend to be real uh... uh... uh... uh...
gutsy but in the meantime balsy i guess it'd be the word i'm looking for but the bottom line is
their cowards they've been masquerading as feminists
which is why so many people are turned off to the national organization for women of women on women
and by the whole feminist movement is largely been uh... like a hundred years behind the times
because it's been largely a bunch of bull dikes masquerading as feminists why can't they just say
were a bunch of angry bull dikes and we're not going to take it anymore what's wrong with that
the manhating the manhating bull dikes right those real mullet like bella absook that wants to
hit you over head with her purse who sided with Lorraine of obit when she did that uh... that's right
when she got her since i guarantee i guarantee that bella's got a big pair of scissors in her purse in
her bag in her sack still got two open lines in date i am not taking a call till we get a bunch of
spicks on the phone right now including that have here that called up last night

closet with her i'm not even going to call her the unmentioned well i'm calling her by name
she's a disgrace she's embarrassing she's grotesque and this business of her being in here because
she's the a girlfriend of the consultant the idea that bud packs and allows this crap on a year
here shows you how much that the packs and people care about this radio station they bought it and
maybe that was their game plan maybe because they have all these other stations they bought this
place and maybe they were out to destroy it from the beginning because they're sure doing a great
job would you know it tell adam don't give that much credence to bar thing because you know that's
that's giving credence to him he put up meals from now so here you go i don't got a straight
up here adam has a straight enough i also want to say because i've been a long time listener

yeah we have two open lines and broard seven six seven nine four six three seven six seven
w-i-o-d and broard where we're desperate to try to get these people off their ass it's a very uh
strange week monday usually every week i mean every week unless there's something really really
phenomenal going on like maybe the dolphins won a game but other than that monday is usually a
death mel because people are trying to get their lives back together and pretend they're doing
their job after screwing off all weekend and then the rest of the week is uh
marginal but this week monday was ass kicking it was great you almost felt we had people out there
and yesterday and today man it's been just brutal it's been like pulling teeth it's been like yanking it
open line in date county do we have any hulios on there ready to come out of the closet or what

eliminate all the spots we're pushing away all the spot breaks we're gonna go right on through
it'll two o'clock if it takes that long until we get some hulio fag on here right now that wants
to do an ellan it sits timely it's right on target it fits in with knots landing coming back tonight

open lines in date six two two nine four six three and two and broard seven six seven nine four six
three see i know it's very unusual these other people these other dollars that we have coming around
on board here i know it's very unusual for me to think this but i would think on a highly rated
show even a mediocre even a lowly rated show that when you're on a year saying here's your
opportunity this is america say whatever the hell you want i don't give a crap about those feminists
bull likes and then adopted kid who gives a flying crap come on here and when in doubt vented out speak
your piece speak your mind how about those panthers how about that Kirk molar and Randy muller and
whoever the hell these people are huh they don't know they don't know from nothing they wouldn't
know bill he would from bill bonds they wouldn't know bill kennedy from bill stern
which is a very sad commentary on the and i realized does make people bad people they've just been
sheltered they've lived a cloistered life here in the state of florida and that's pretty sad like
i said yesterday get on a plane and just say go to the airport and just uh whip out your credit card
go to the airport and whip it out there's a lot of that goes on over there by the way go over to
the airport just whip out your credit card say here give me a ticket to somewhere anywhere you're
going like in the next hour so i don't have to wait too long just to go somewhere and see what the
real goddamn world is all about i'm a serious man the the periculous level of the people in this area
in this state in this state the idea like if somebody lives in kendal their idea of a big a big weekend
is like a trip up to the palm beach line or even a broward line forget about palm beach oh we got in
the car with all the way up to the golden glades wow whoo heavy duty baby that's their idea of a big
outing a big trip that's the kind of outing that they're into they pack a they pack a box lunch they
put a few ants in there so they can feel like it's a real picnic and they take a drive up to go
they don't get out and i'll tell you one thing by the way if you go up to the golden glades get off
on a hundred and sixty third go east about five or six blocks and go through the basket robins drive
through at least make it worthwhile you don't have to get out of the car at all you'll be safe but you
have to stop the car well you keep the motor running why have you ever been in the basket
driving through robberies are have you ever there's no robber oh you are the biggest turd burger
there are no robberies at the basket robins drive through on a hundred sixty third street
you even know where it is yeah yeah have you ever been through there no i have never got robbed
oh it's a good stuff i mean i'm not eating that stuff now and not if you're on a diet but like if
you're a skinny or if you like don't have to worry about your weight if you like something sweet
if you're gonna drive all the way up from candle least you can do is go to uh uh basket robins
and go right through the drive through and say give me give me a hot fudge sunday three scoops
with extra fudge and like rocky road and maybe uh whatever else whatever uh uh uh uh

saved same with isa right in college he was j off now it's isa no this nobody ever changes the name

traits at the bombing all through sports history this has been happening cash his clay became my
mom and i laid lu al sinbo became kareem up do jibbar and so on chicil on yield didn't have to
change his name was stupid in the first place a couple years ago Mike Tyson was thinking about
an aim change but he decided against it because he had enough troubles following his old one
another thing i noticed is how do you never see white guys changing their names on old pama
becomes amad abdula larry bird changes to alim gombo rabal the closest thing we got to a white
athlete changes name is tanya hotings xx has been Jeff goolee he had a hearing in portland to
change his name to jep stone and there were a bunch of people there fighting to change in court
i didn't know you could do that one of the guys protest and was an actor named tall pison who
played a character named jep stone on the donna read show he was outraged and said his reputation
could be ruined i got one question Jeff what reputation not only ain't it your real name nobody
remembers you you could be dead and we wouldn't know or care at least the guy that took your name
out of you sick remember that hotting belouli honeymoon video whoo maybe that's where people get
confused and you'll rack up the chicks i say you get a name when you're born you ought to be stuck

205 at w i o d on a great wednesday here at the home of hysteria man where everybody's running
around in circles going little bit like that we got lots of open lines now again at noon yesterday
too we actually built up a little momentum just before noon like maybe a call and then noon came
and all of a sudden okay we don't care no more you can't do that to us man you can't do this to us
we're dying over here two open lines in date six two two nine four six three two and
broard seven six seven nine four six three here's poppano hello time caller all right all right
hey i got a question a comment and a request yes okay forget about the request we're not doing a
request we want verbal intercourse today forget this request stuff well it kind of go hand in hand
with the uh the fat or the with the fact stuff yeah well think about it okay okay anyways uh
question i never really got an answer or found out an answer about what happened to run and run
why they left uh zeta four can you answer that they didn't leave zeta four the paxon people panic
because howard came on the year and they panicked and realized that howard was going to blow them out
of the water and so they blew that show off and then in their infinite wisdom they bought the
network a couple of years later and put them on the year here and they're doing like fractions man
their numbers are so small you need a magnifying glass to see them well that's that's weird because
in the typical way that only paxon can do yes i was hearing all kinds of rumors that uh
there's sexual allegation no there were not uh nothing like that i had nothing to do with that
nothing nothing that good uh okay uh comment to do with desperate ratings as in none
yeah comment yes i was in the army i have had basic and a it over at fort dix new jersey yes
um it's kind of surprising that uh hearing about this this drill sergeant and the sergeant
major of the army and everything like that um now all this is suddenly coming out of the closet
yeah at least he was living up to his name anyway yeah right girl sergeant yeah well anyways um
when i when i was an a it we would have the guys in the first floor girls would be on the second
yeah i would see the girls in formation the next day a couple of them coming down in
here's because a couple the drill sergeants what they're and put some kind of you know
i got you down yeah yeah so it's it's kind of surprising for me to hear that all of a sudden
all this stuff is coming out this stuff should have been out a long time ago yeah and
just like that Graham James with the hockey players man all this all this stuff has been swept
out of the carpet for years like the thing with all the priest to child molesting priest they just
sweep it out of the carpet as long as nobody knows about it just keep it a secret well they don't
want to hear it right you know anyways because one thing we know in a military man there ain't no
sex going on thank god for that no it's not him and good morning the military no way not out there
in the navy not in the Marines in the navy when those guys are about to run those ships for months
at a time we know there ain't nobody doing nothing out there they're not even touching themselves
what about their wives back home the exactly yeah uh huh anyway so they're quest I gotta make
maybe they're getting drilled by the dentist that could be uh they're quest I gotta make yeah
the the gay square dance gay square dance yeah see what you're gonna do is make this in a way
in a way requesting now oh well I don't mean to but you know it's
riding along to the gay square dance got a great big zipper in the back of my pants
get off the horse at the old barn door got my saddle turned around I'm a riding on the horn
look inside folks are dancing all around there goes Johnny and his mother's not yeah all the man
left and all the man right all the man needs a pillow to fight
give your partner a silly a smirk all going hands for a big circle jerk
volunteers all raise your hand who's gonna be the next pivot man
invest your partner home for a drink lick your lips and give him a weight with a great big smile
and a great big nod let him know your gerbil's deep cloud okay 1209 at ww i'd be here it is this is

day six two two nine four six three six two two two w i o d we have one inbroward seven six seven
nine four six three seven six seven w i o d our topic today is should those bulldogs give back
that diamond engagement ring here's a uh what does that mean is that his name is that uh what does
that mean christian and davie a christian and davie hello hey Neil how you doing okay sir
hey first of all i've i've listened to you for years and i love you yes you know just like god loves
the centenary hates to spend oh yeah right well listen anyways about that's what it is that's what
need a bride used to say before she went bankrupt yeah well listen i you know i don't hate everyone i
i really care for everyone and and i don't have any animosity towards anyone i want to get that
straight but no there's no but but but but but but but but no but it sounded like a preface to
something else no i sounded lucky i guess you know a man makes him a little while ago regarding
Halloween and that started in with the druids and a lot of people don't understand well let me
ask you a question okay what difference does it make how it got started don't we know what it
means today don't we know how it that it's a fun thing for people to go out and pester their
neighbors and get their kids a bunch of candy and get them sick and for perverts to put like razor blades
and apples and that's what it's all about that's the purpose well could i take it has nothing to do
with religion it has nothing to do with the devil it has nothing to do with the druids it has nothing
to do with Lucifer it has nothing to do with jews or goyam or anybody else it's just a night of
fun for the people in their little pat monkey kids that's all okay well i remember that's all very
simple okay well i respect your opinion can you let's not in opinion it's a fact what can't can
you listen what i have to say i'll be delighted all right listen all right uh and and the early
uh twelve hundred okay the druids they started uh why do you keep going back to this again well
listen to me because you don't understand it's correct that way that's correct they were probably
good that he's totally wrong all right well listen they would they would have child sacrifices
and the cackel and they'd like the candle with human fat and and and first of all let me ask you
this were you there to see this well do you do you believe that Napoleon and Hitler existed
Napoleon and Hitler yeah i believe yeah they both existed right okay well that's history
we're Napoleon and Hitler back in the uh twelveth century well listen that was history and i'm
trying to say is and how about Shakespeare did he exist of course he did yeah was that his real name
do we know how about there there's all kinds of historical people that we didn't even know
of for sure if that was the real name if they were some of them if they we leave it existed
well i guess in five hundred years but what does that have to do with anything why you giving me a
history a tortured fractured fairy tale history lesson here uh that has something i just got
through telling you what uh holo means all about right well and what are you trying to say
in my far-bicinna glacier friend what do you try to say Neil and five hundred years
that could have if no riders existed okay forget about that what is the what are the druids
have to do with the way that holo ween is celebrated now well it started out as an occult
i don't care how it started out let me see it again you're like that you're the most
definitive typical religious asshole i there all you're all the same you just keep repeating
the same crap and you just keep going like a steamroller out of control if somebody asks you a
question you can't be bothered because you know you can't answer the question well can i answer it
i'm waiting okay one last shot all right one last shot okay you talk you talk you talk you talk
you're talking about Jesus and he said that he is the way in the car Jesus has got nothing to do
with holo ween let's get back to holo ween because he's a good okay two open lines in day it's

other townlines these religious people man this hocus pocus and you know something these guys who
are offering themselves this heavens gate of this cult it's not helping at all you think that at
least if if anything that these people dying might wake up somebody out there and realize that
all this religious horse crap is nothing more than horse crap superstition and bull crap it's garbage
and here's a guy a huck in a trine who didn't say anything who started defending this other
Catholic guy who's all psychotic because lucifer and holo ween are like uh go hand in gland or whatever
now it was and now this guy's talking about the druids and crap that allegedly happened like eight
million years ago which didn't happen in the first place but who cares if it did what does it
got to do with the price of rice in peoria anyway nothing but don't try to have a conversation
because he's just gonna keep rolling right along there with a blinders on right down the old Hershey
highway but of course he don't have nothing against anybody he's just a good Christian

human race right here and you people are such a bunch of bungholes that you don't even have the
energy to pick up the phone and scream and yell that guy should have you hysterical hysterical

into guy who uh sold them a bill of goods named water sable and he really believes that this guy
is going to reinvent me and reinvent talk radio and thank god i'm getting the hell out right my
experience with him is like they can't seem to separate the business from that you know something
that religious i'm i let me say it again the meeting i had with him several weeks ago every other
word was f in this and as that and god oh yeah he's that all that crap is just for show i don't
believe that uh... he's in any of that stuff the word hypocrite comes to mind the user when it suits

dollar bill we have two open lines in broward seven six seven nine four six three seven six seven

here's a mobile in my army hello i need yes sir if they didn't have a devil what would be the
sense of having a christian yeah so that's why they have to promote it meaning without without an
evil there's no reason for their good like madeline oh here's like madeline hair said before she
disappeared religion without a hell isn't worth a damn that was exactly her quote yes exactly
right you got to scare you got to scare the hell out of the people okay if anybody really believes
that if there was a god he would for you would cause you to burn in hell forever what kind of a god
is that kind of a sick twisted god is that that's right supposed to be a loving god and yada yada yada
but also was a selfish god how can god be perfect and also be selfish isn't there like a little
contradiction there of course it is and it's all ridiculous even a child if they sit down and
they read any of this crap they say this is ridiculous this is stuff for simpletons people don't
they just blinded by everything they're just brainwashed and they're too stupid they're too lazy
to think for themselves and get a new phone they're too lazy to get a new phone so they're steven
jay gray who's also sick and tired of that news guy that jackass that arrogant egotistical
popus award-winning jackass we have an open line in date six two two two w i o d we have one
and broard seven six seven w i o d yeah everybody around here all this new ray jeman they're all big
shots they're all bossing everybody around and oh give me this and get me that yeah big deal we're
really impressed with your award okay john millford bread for douchebag the third we're really
impressed you would know a new story if it's lit inside your anus here's bokeh hello i kneel how
you great i've actually i've listened to you back in the w n w s days yeah you know sometimes i
agree with you and sometimes i don't and i guess this is one of the times i don't agree with you
about what well i know you i know your show is satire and quite frankly no one does a better
than you in terms of satire and that's right but there's one thing that i needed to mention and
that has to do with some not all but but a part of the the jewish humor you use for example
a lot of the jewish humor i think is fantastic like the the song be true to your shul and
yeah well i'm not here about the good stuff let you have the bad stuff that here's the bad stuff
here's the stuff that bothers me bad stuff according to you okay uh you know a lot of people don't
know that you're jewish and sometimes how could they not how could there be somebody on the
you're using yetish words who could up wouldn't be jewish well okay what i'm ridiculous okay but
what i'm really saying it's that sometimes you don't be like me saying to molly goalberg don't say
oye vey because a lot of people don't know your jewish okay i guess what i'm really saying is
sometimes you'll say things like ju-bitch or ju-canoo and what i think it does at least in my opinion
is that i think it fuels some of the you know the anti-semites again i'll get out of here give me a
break i mean now you talk about ridiculous well no i i i you know i'm gonna tell you any people who
don't have a sense of humor that's one thing about the jews look at all the great jewish comedians
the one reason the jews have survived all these years is because they've always had a great sense of
humor even in the middle of the worst adversity they got a sense of humor i'm just saying that
there are times where you'll get an anti-semitic call or two uh you know on the air and i think some
of them feel that if they talk show host makes these kind of comments on the air it adds more
we know how long do i put up with anti-semite calls well you don't how long do i put up with anti-cuban
calls even though i use words like spick and hulio and stuff like that people with a sense of humor
listen to this show and the other people don't have a sense of humor they're listening in the closet
and i feel sorry for them i just i just you know that's just my opinion and i know that for example
when you know like the term ju-bitch or whatever if someone other than a jewish person said that
it would be highly offensive there are many things you say on the air why don't you go back to
Canada you you bastard see i didn't even say it i know but that's one of the things but the bottom
well wait a minute that's another one of the things well not that you said but the the recording
that you just play yeah that's also offensive you know but when i say there's a lot of Jewish
how about if i say you go a bastard is that okay no it's not okay he's a book i'm saying is
this how about you spick how about you spick bastard no it's not okay you to but i'm well i'm saying
how about you dumb shfarts are you how would that be in closing all i'm saying is it's a lot of
Jewish humor you use i think it's great i think that's fine and you know something i'm going to
continue doing what i do okay that's just my not i don't see one thing i don't do is ask the
audience to call in here give me instructions as to how to do the show we have plenty of people
on a station who could use some instruction believe me desperately but i'm not one of them
all right just my opinion zygazooan was he Jewish we have two open lines in dates uh huh humorless
kike exactly six two two nine four six three two open lines in date and we have an open line
of browards seven six seven let's get back to the halloween stuff okay i think the guy had an excellent
point halloween is a disgusting grotesque satanic holiday and all those evil cats and bats and
spirits uh there you can smell it in the air can't you at halloween time you can go out there or
is that just all that rotting candy in the fruit too much rotten fruit here's tamarack hello
me yeah that's you you're not prejudiced you pick on everybody equally yes there is a sign that
there is a god though i'll by the way there's a jew in tamarack yeah did you read last week or the
week before i need a brian declared bankruptcy yes i did i've mentioned that several times and thank
you so much for mentioning again all right last but not least because i missed the morning you did
mention fenn fenn the big article yes i did and then again we were we were we had it yesterday we
were on it yesterday the woman buried in her wedding dress you got it and in closing you've heard the
term serial killer yeah it's a serial killer a guy who goes kuku for koko puffs no frosted flakes thank
you have a great day too much frosted flakes and you want to know why because it's loaded with azucada
baby it's loaded with sugar sugar sugar sugar sugar is making more people hysterical and more people
hyper and jumping off the walls and your little kids are crazy why because you're loading them
with sugar even all the baby foods as if you look at the label most of it's loaded with sugar
it's the american way of killing the population with a great taste and talk about addictive
anybody else out there i'm i'm sure there are plenty of other people who even have a worse addiction than
i do although i have no idea how that's possible i am telling you man if i eat something with sugar in
it there is no such thing as eating only one if there is a box of a hundred i could eat one or two
with the best of intentions and within a matter of twenty thirty minutes they're all gone i don't
care whether it's candy i don't care whether it's cookies i don't care whether it's like a half
gallon of ice cream if i start eating something with sugar in it it stimulates my appetite to the point
where i just practically am killing myself with sugar and you don't hear the government talking about
that because it's big business i don't hear anybody i don't hear one person out there all these
people that want the network shows all those tv shows to be rated everything's got to have a rating
so we know we're not sending for presenting anything harmful to our kids like god forbid naked boobies
oh my god we don't want to see our kids see a naked woman or a penis god forbid
but every show on Saturday morning is sponsored by candy bars and cereal all loaded with sugar
every single one of those products that advertises on those cartoon shows and every other kids show
on Saturday morning every single one of those sponsors is killer crap killer crap for your kids
and i don't see anybody getting all bent out of shape about that
so it goes to show you man you can't complain about the american priorities because there aren't any
we have an open line and brow at seven six seven we have one on the mobile per one purple line

w i o d the worst talk radio I've ever heard in my life was on w o d death bed records presents a one
of a kind collection the only good solution in my case dr jack of orcane sings the songs of the
rolling stone now you can enjoy the soothing sounds of dr kay in the privacy of your own home
listen when you get up in the morning listen before you go to bed at night listen as you're placing
your lips around the tailpipe of your car this album is not available in stores to order yours
just call that elderly lady down the street who probably has his number by the phone and the
ban will be over shortly your copy
dr death sings the songs of the rolling stones once you hear it you'll wonder how you ever lived without it
and
there's a
there's a
on
w i o d
and we didn't even need dr jack how do you like that one nineteen and w i o d we have an open line
in day six two two all three and broard seven six seven nine four six three seven six seven w i o d
here's Delray Beach hello nil your faggot okay good thanks a lot thanks for the bulletin
here's oh that was buddhu in a voice here's surfside on a mobile hello
see
tiki amo and don you and don ini
i'm don you and o lini i got beach at the oh no what can we do for you sir
phasier as a referee you think he's a good ref they all suck now come on it's gotta be one
that better than the other he's not he's fair he has his good days in his bad days
one of the fair of them all right man he's okay you would like to see some i've seen some real crappy
games that he's called more i've seen games when he was more worried about getting his hair out of
joint he's to you know that that's all he cares about is having enough hair spray that head is not
move that's why he doesn't move the head too much and a lot of stuff is going on the sides and behind
him you don't want to look because his hair might get out of joint i give him more fair than poor
games i think he's you know more on the better side more fair than than well he's fair i think
we i like him sucks was watching the game the ranger uh
jersey game was that was that also watching paint drawing your opinion no it was it was better
it was better than the previous game i thought the third period was pretty exciting that's good
new jersey was all over them they were hanging on like life and death oh my god
rick your rick your kept him in the game then of course the disallowed gold didn't hurt any
because because bill garen decided to go through for a skate in the crease uh i still can't
figure out where the hell he was going he was probably trying to get out of the crease
he was he skated right through it though he had no there no reason being over there he skated
right through the crease yeah put all that happens in like a hundred percent yeah you're right i
know but these guys are going to be much more conscious of it because they know what's going on
he he cost them uh wow all right i'm not going to argue with that in closing Neil uh is your
prediction changed on the ranger part i mean on the uh i don't know i know my prediction is not
changed on the rangers going anywhere they're not going anywhere they're like uh you know well the
look like it to me i mean they played one uh uh pretty damn good third period there but they
just can't score they don't score any goals how to how can you win games when you can't score any
goals they remind me of the panthers if it has caught enough to win they're no they are
looks looks to me like they're down two games to one last time i checked
i'm sorry i'm sorry i thought you meant the rangers but all right no i'm talking about the devils
they're not score any goals but the peppering rick the was shot well they got to stick it in
you can't win unless you stick it right in there and the puck too right exactly good luck pal finally
finally in closing yes okay i don't know even though you say barna be in the butching up of the
buff flows is costing them the game with the flyers no i i i i i said that i said that mouthing off
in the game on saturday and getting into that big brawl woke the flyers up out of a deep coma
and that was the turn to me that was the turning point of the series if buffalo with a one-net game
they'd be in pretty good shape right now but they're not how about the last game with the barna
he was great in the last game he's one of my favorite players i won't knock Matthew Barnaby he's
great huh now i can see why you like him he's he's he's dynamite i'm most of them ray also they
they got a hell of a team and they got uh uh mike peca and he got uh holes in her and he got uh
michael uh growshik and he got uh jason daugh none of them are superstars but each and every one of
them is a good solid two-way player man they got a very nice team and balls too exactly they would

and thanks for those nice new billboards by the way all over the place the big red ones you know
with that the stokey in my purse and George and i just continue with amazement shaking
our heads and wondering when the holiday is going to come that we can finally get there a lot of
but in the meantime we show up every day and yeah i could just put a bunch of crap music on
there especially you know this it's interesting this guy calls because like i've said this before
as bad as the paxon people are and the consultant and all the other crap that's going on here
if the audience which they're not but if the audience in his town and they're never going to change
up in your 21 years they will never ever change these people are dead heads but if the audience
was responsive it could be okay i mean uh we're you know basically in the driver's seat here
we could be having a good time every day but it's the same old crap no matter how many different
things you talk about it well that's not they're not interested they got nothing to say they
got nothing to offer they're too damn lazy to pick up the phone oh hey no i listen every day but
i never call i'm so sick of meeting people like that if i had a a hundred dollar bill for every
person i met like that i could buy the day and join and turn it into a parking lot oh they're
going to do it already look at those deadlines two open lines a day i spent half of the show here
just given the phone numbers out so now one of these boneheads they got on there doing these stupid
topics no one of they just keep repeating the numbers over and over and over again what's wrong with
talking about a couple of bull dikes they want to adopt some a retarded kid what's wrong with that
we had two calls on that today which i don't even want to talk about it we had two calls on it
which is more than she got except the course from a hove here i know you're listening out there
hove here but you don't have the balls to call here today you've figured you might it cone
exactly you might it cone
date county six two two nine four six three two open lines there two and brown and just like all
these religious nuts they're out there listening right now all these believers they don't have the balls
how much how much confidence can you have in a bull crap that you've been brainwashed and do
that you won't even pick up the phone and dispute what i'm saying because you know you can't defend it
you know it's a bunch of crap and you're still over the years man they finally just kind of
vanished into the woodwork except for that one jackball that called before about Halloween in the
druids frank frank oh is that his name yeah figures probably knows frank synatra
here's mommy lakes hello i'm not calling about the drink the druids or the dicks or anything
how about druid dikes or the druid dikes or frank synatra yeah i would i never drive at six o'clock
but i happen to be driving yesterday and i hit a few buttons and all of a sudden i hear a guy who's
doing a really funny black guy really horrible accent you know i'm saying she maybe fill Henry's back on
so i'm listening to this and i just can't believe this guy can't can't form a sentence and he's talking
like super ebonics and all of a sudden it's i find out that it's Hank Goldberg has some guy on
who actually like has a show because i'm a more boring chromati chromati oh he don't belong on
here just to say hello he's horrendous when you get over to you but i get him out of here oh i
better get him out of there yeah where i'm like i'm going to decide who's going to be there and
who's not going to be there well your power come on please let me tell you this right now okay my
power i have never ever any place i've been in this town twenty one years i've never decided
whether anybody was going to be there or not going to be there but you tell the truth
yeah when you get on and explain to the people it's over and you explained it i'm not there
yeah warren chromati does not belong on here i've already told those people that and they're pretty
well aware of it he blows he's inarticulate at best well embarrassing at work i thought i
felt bad i thought it was like an anti-black thing because this guy was took i thought i had the
king fish on her like a name is an am he is he's going to be he's going to be be doing aim is an
Andy he was terrible okay i'm glad you like the show okay now we're down to two calls date county

the paxon people that's that's a separate story it's a different chapter in the book i mean that's
like the different 400 chapters but it's this audience here man it's the i.o.d audience it's the

care about that it's great that everybody listens that's wonderful i want some assholes to talk to
not smart people i want some morons to talk to i want some jackasses to talk to
that's what makes the show good and to show you how little they know is they they screen the
call so on the other shows they screen them so intensively that the morons don't get on the year
very rarely and that's what makes great talk radio that will make that's what makes this station great
is once in a while here in a jackass here and somebody ripping the ass out of me or out of uh
whoever it might be out of rick riley i mean what more what could make a better day for anybody in
america then hear it somebody call up and ripping an ass on rick riley my god i get sexual excitement

everybody around and making all kinds of demands like some kind of a hot shot i mean don't get me
wrong i like rick and suds to a point i like suds we have two open lines and broward 7679 463 767

spices it up as opposed to this dry boring contrived controlled we're gonna manipulate and put it
on here yeah good put it out of a computer why don't you start generating voices out of a computer
and type in the words that you want to be said on the year that's real exciting radio man you

yeah because the person has to be crazy to come it's like sign in the suicide note coming to go
just just just just just just just just just tell me what your problem is yeah he's he's
campaigning feverishly here mr. ego he's campaigning feverishly morning noon and night he's playing
both all five sides against the middle but uh and i congratulate just for spending uh iod for
spending packs of money while whining and dining the people from w and n the motivation station
which is the very popular room around this joint that he's uh playing them against the middle
against the middle and uh all over the place because you know like i said you your numbers are
going to go with you your listeners are going to go with that's right they're going to be they're
going to be better than have been in a long time because it's still this whole station is still
my whole existence on this radio station is still i need to be born again but uh you know i i just
uh it'll be interesting to see because uh it's something less like they find some guy from the
hellbop comment it comes out i know something i couldn't give a crap who they bring in they can bring
in uh Walter Cronkite god and Moses i couldn't care less i'm just going to do my thing rip rip short
make them over there you go hey by the way you know there's a rumor that sunny fox i'm glad you
mentioned all of this sunny foxes on ten forty on that uh words in bokers somewhere yes is that true
yes it is oh my god hi this is sunny fox oh jeez he's playing like Andy Williams records yes he
fancy well he's bouncing around everything he does uh cut weekends on the country station too
on kiss yeah he's kissing it thanks for the good news okay have a great day okay so sunny
foxes on that ten forty they're real real i mean magic plays songs from like the fifties and sixties
and maybe early seventies the uh that ten forty w jna they play music for people over the age of death
in fact the heavens gate people they had that station on as they were eating the pudding they had
on the sunny fox show hi this is sunny fox welcome wow so some well you know we all get a mosque the
leban as they say gotta eat we all gotta eat somehow gotta pay for that pudding here's napoles hello
hello yes sir can you hear me okay i hear you great great okay two things i just meant the last
uh six days traveling around florida went to uh orlando to uh see my ex-wife yes sir and she's
moving back down to napoles and i tell you what up those people think that orlando radio is what's
gonna go down here uh i tell you what they have there to think coming they need a lobotomy exactly the
last three days i'd sit up there and was it joe bob and willie or wherever the heck it is first
thing in the morning it's just it's unbelievable yeah did you hear real radio uh no i didn't go that far
oh i spent a lot of time with my wife and stuff so you know i only time i really heard them was on the
way back today going across i four and all because if you heard real radio you'll hear a almost
exact replica of what they're trying to reproduce down here with you can try thing with the topics
and with the heavy screening of the calls and if they think that's gonna go over here man more
power to them t salud one more thing is every break is the same thing yeah every three oh they're these
these old ponderous jingles these rejoins they're doubling up on them now we have one going into the
spots which is a great way for the advertisers to make sure that nobody hears their recorded messages
because everybody's diving for the dial to tune it off and then when we come back at the end of
the break we have another one of these corny old uh crap things so to the like driving them down to
people's throats which is a lot more clutter just takes up a lot more time and just to aggravate
the audience i mean i'm in the talent it seems like in their news broadcast i'm talking about
up there in Orlando everything is the same yeah for two hours they mention the same stuff every time
so uh i'll tell you what uh
