heard up but across the nation and Canada to call toll free at 1-888-474-WI-O-D.
And now the Neil Rogers show.
Okay boys and girls that's a great start to the week there let's see I punched
that up look I was playing but the only problem is it's on the production line
on the DCS George that's the only problem so guess what boys and girls let's
just pretend we didn't see that okay and let's start all over again by saying
Golden Globe winner Jeffrey Rush starred in the true story of a musical
prodigy who suffered a nervous breakdown after being emotionally abused as
a child. Now Jeffrey Rush returns to the street in the story of another
music student who suffers in even worse state and here from my channel listen
Mrs. Motherwell the different last week's lesson yes is another well all right
let's hear it okay that's terrible oh my eye do it again okay
let's leave it a worse I'll be out of my eye again okay
God you take my eyes Jeffrey Rush stars as a no-delete
boom with two black eyes in China China now playing again then again then again
until it gets it right out of theater near you one more time okay 10 out to a
W.I.O.D. Happy Monday to it it's gonna be a day-to-day man you can just
feel it in your bones can't you can just feel it you can smell it almost it's
gonna be some kind of a day. Oh where the hell do we start do we start with that
game on Saturday do we start with that did we start with the H word already
this morning do we start the week with that I don't know what it'll not it's
better than talking about all the other stuff that's going on yeah let's leave
that for some other time by the way fat rate you're getting on my nerves
mister too many Yenthas out there everybody in a brother we got engineers who
are Yenthas we got the fat people or Yenthas
Rogers quote for the day what you're kind of syrpy a little bit convoluted my
quote for the day is going to be very simple don't be a freaking Yentha okay
that's my quote for the day don't be a Yentha okay man there are dime does
there everywhere you look pop pop pop pop that's all they're doing like a
Hakanah China just find a life okay that would be a real good idea find a
life get a search party out there and as far as any of the people in the W.I.O.D.
sales department are concerned not to mention Brian Barbara specifically how
about servicing the account number one don't worry about bankwits about
plaques thanks by the way to the people at Poppano Park I couldn't possibly be
there last night in my debilitated mental state which I currently find myself
there was no way but thanks to Carol howke and the people at Poppano Park give me
a nice plaque last night the L.N.J. Finkelson Award for the media and Poppano
Park and Harness Racing for which I think them profusely but be that as it may
that's really not what it's all about Brian but it's all about is like getting
us some copy and servicing the account and getting some some even minor little
miniscule notion of what that account is all about what it is that they do up
there you know the little horses with the carts that keep going around and
around and around that's what it's all about it's called Harness Racing maybe
it's great so getting back to that thing that game on Saturday good game good
game but as usual I'm perplexed and kind of founded by the fans they
continue astonishing me and he scored two goals now came his first game back
after the injury right but I said to JD remember to do some of the John Davidson
was doing the game with my camera for Fox nationwide Saturday with the
national game in between the second and third period I said to JD I said you
know this game is kind of like a microcosm of Eddie Jovenaski's career with
the Panthers and that is the good the bad and the ugly I mean it's all in there a
horrendous giveaway early in the game right at his own blue line nearly resulting in
a goal some of the dumbest penalties you'd ever want to see one fight of course
in which you got the snot kicked out of them and then of course two goals so it
like all kinds of good stuff and Dave Hyde yesterday was yesterday I guess it
must have been in the sunset and I'll head the balls nice go and David had the
balls to actually tell it like it was about the Eddie's performance as in
honestly as opposed to Eddie I mean Eddie's out there getting a fight getting
the crafty out of him and the crowds going Eddie Eddie I you guys I don't
understand yet I don't know what it's all about I don't get it neither my
played great struck a plate great these are played okay we lost the game
it over time see we don't want to be going and all these over time is because we
just over time is deadly for the Panthers it's the kiss it at we blow leads late
and then although in this case we tied it up actually in the third period very
early on it was Eddie Eddie I guess now we got two players on the team that the
crowd knows we got we only had one for a long time when Eddie was out injured
there by the way also the Sun sent a lot should mention to you that you ought
to get your crap right which you rarely do here next to the article about Scott
Melon being the rats which quite frankly the timing of the center what they'll
answer all about since we don't do the rats anymore and everybody should know
about that right next to it fatigue suspended Philadelphia defenseman Michelle
Pate has been suspended pending an NHL hearing for kneeing Panthers forward Johan
Garper Law on Saturday but now here's the best part fatigue who received the
major penalty in a game of conduct on the play miss Sundays game against the
Rangers well obviously he didn't receive a game of conduct because it was
Melon being his pictures right next to this little inset article who came out
there to retaliate later and beat this not out of Michelle Pate for doing the
knee job and shouldn't gotten the game of conduct but he didn't that's the whole
point but the Sun sent a don't confuse them with the facts because it's a local
newspaper they just put any crap in there that they can come up with by the
way what are we going to do with those aroma therapy people in here today
ever have come back we got to do something because there's something in here
like the other joint now see we've been in here five months we've been in here
long enough now that there's a funuous among you with which I got to by the
way before I get back in that game stuff tip my hat to my tag and doctor doctor
mark this guy is a freaking genius how long have I told you if you find a doctor
that has any idea what he's doing don't ever let him go and that's the truth
you find a good doctor man that's better than money it's better than liquid
gold it's better than sex it's better than anything because without a good
doctor man you got you got source you got serious problems and so here I was
sitting on Friday listening to all you witch doctors out there oh yeah you got
to do this and you got to do that and stick your head and drain oh okay
fact if I would have stuck my head and drain over the weekend it would probably
been an improvement but at any rate so I go to my doctor on Friday and of course
I've had the thing with a real dry lips since coming back from Vegas I'm
beginning to think that this whole thing the doctor may be wrong about part of
the reason he said that it's like a real low grade virus kind of a thing it'll
go away which it is but you know what I think I think it's an allergic reaction
and you know what I think it's an allergic reaction to remember when I did
that Mark Jacobson show and they loaded me up with enough makeup for 70
prayer the the entire cast of West Side Story now somebody mentioned to me that a
lot of people have allergic reactions in fact the next day even though I tried
washing it off pretty good like the left side of my nose there was a big and
reek a kind of growth and like it went away but you know I'm saying like an
allergic thing a skin thing and so I think that this whole thing is a reaction
I think lawsuit sounds good to me that make up bitch that put on about 40 how
much makeup do you need again I guess you know somebody pointed out to me at the
game the other day he tapes that show with me okay now he meaning Mark Jacobs
and he sits behind that desk right so you're basically only see him and he has
lost a lot of weight he looks pretty good for him but you but even if he had
you'd never know he puts me out on the edge so to speak out on the edge of the
desk I'm at high cheer like a little infant and my puppet hanging out if I was
behind the desk like he was you'd see me like from about mid chest level up and you
wouldn't know if I wait like a hundred and fifty or five hundred and fifty and
would make any difference so the idea I guess that I chose to make him look as
good as possible which ain't easy because this is America and to make the guest
look is on flattering as possible especially if it's me never done on me
before nice go and mark you maniac I'm still pissed off about the thing that
they've leaped out that that deal about Wayne and by the way speaking of Wayne
more bad information here oh so when we're getting back to Dr. Mark I got so
much crap here man but my mind is a little bit scattered this morning and
any rates of the doctor says to me don't use that Vaseline lip therapy good
good information for you George since you're the one that was peddling that with
the best of its time to give it to me to yeah so I passed the norm we just keep
passing it down the line because it doesn't work and it no car mag and the reason
that what about carmax does that have alcohol in that one I don't think so
it's just wax yeah they're more so anyway you don't want to put most of this
stuff on your lips when you have real dry lips because it has in it alcohol and
guess what alcohol does your skin when in doubt it dries it out so you're
trying to put this stuff on there I guess if you got a cut or something it
might be okay but if you have like real chat dry lips don't be putting that
Vaseline lip therapy on it it'll kill you so the doctor says just go and get a
regular jar of Vaseline and I thought to myself I don't live in a trailer park
I ain't getting no Vaseline on apologies to my Italian ill-profissority by the
way couldn't possibly be their Saturday morning I've been a psychotic all
weekend no way but at any rate so I get the regular Vaseline put it on my lips
right and I wake up Saturday morning it's like 70% improved put it on again
now over the weekend and this morning it's like 90% better and even my tongue is
like a 90% better how do you like that which may or may not have to do with
the irritation there but I think it's that makeup I think it's the allergic
reaction to about 175 422 pounds of makeup speaking of makeup how did
Ricks-Wife do it at Mrs. America page and out there we don't know yet well
I'm sure we'll hear about it at two o'clock yeah I thought there was some
emergency or something because I know Rick and Suts are taking off on vacation
next week the same week that I am which I thought was kind of a Zara in the
first place but you know you get your dates locked in and your flights and
he's got another one of these skiing deals great more power to them but Friday
Rick and Suts aren't here and I'm asking everybody what the hell's going on is
did somebody one of the weasels get a bad case of diarrhea what's going on
over there in a family and it seemed to be kind of mysterious and by the way
Brooke did a damn good job too nice call at Brooke I like Brooke she's okay in my
book okay little too small to you sometime but she's she's great nice call at
sweetheart and actually there's nothing wrong with Brooke at all it's just
that because she reminds me so much of Randy that that part of it you know
we can just clear that out of our brains and we'll be okay we'll get along fine
you know what I'm saying and she can't help that that's a sure she's not
imitating Randy because quite frankly who would want to but she's just being
herself but there's just that Randy issue thing that if we once get over that
she's great but at any rate there was kind of this mystery like how come
Rick ain't here today and through the rumor mill today it's starting to up put
the pieces together well yeah you know the W.I.D rumor mill which is very very
I mean it yeah that one so that's gonna get a lot of use both of Brian strikes
again got to get a lot of use Brian yeah so anyway she was Mrs. Rick Riley was
in another one of these Mrs. Beauty pageants in where was it Kansas City
I believe some horrendous place like that man oh man I sure hope she did better
than little girl out in Denver you know the one from the beauty pageant oh and
speak of that if we think we've had enough of art for him in this week you
know what kills me about these television assholes is that on the one hand you
notice every show that he's on now with the exceptional Larry King I'm
surprised Larry didn't do it uh Al Jolson thing and put on black face to do
the interview because everybody who interviews Mark Furman now who's busy
peddling his book as revolting as we find him but we're just on our hands and
ease to see who can get him first because he's out there peddling his book
Oprah Hadamon you see that and she said they're basically kissed his ass and
this morning CBS which I really watched that show because I still can't I
can't figure out which pictures that Jose Diaz Valar whatever his name is
is that is that him or is that his brother which one is he is he Jose oh that's
right Lincoln Diaz Valar and Jose Diaz and Abraham Lincoln Diaz whatever his
name is he's got this man's got to have naked pictures he's on a national TV show
on CBS he's got no personality he was bad on local TV here Jose Diaz Julio I
mean he is terminal he's as boring as spit so at any rate guess who's interviewing
Mark McEwan interviewing Mark Furman Mark McEwan fat bald and black well you do live
up there in Idaho just a matter of 50 minutes from the compound of all the skin
heads the area they pop pop pop pop yeah there was again how do you like that turn on
TVS news this morning I'm here it all over you no matter where you turn you
can't get away from it and the interesting part is they act very in
sense and very outrage but they just can't wait to get them on because you know
because it's the ratings they're interested in not because they like them
because they want to make sure that you understand we all understand that they
detest and they find him deplorable and subhuman but can we help you sell that
bookmark how long will you come on for how much time will you give us 10
14 to W I O D if you're tired of being treated like crap by your bank if
you're tired of all the problems and the screw ups and the fact that they don't
even care about it which is the part that infuriated me a few months ago do
what I did switch over to family bank man it's a much higher family bank is the
place where you're a valued customer not just a number in a puter somewhere
family bank is locally owned locally operated they do business to
traditionally old-fashioned way if you want to talk to a loan officer you don't
have to wait for some stranger some Yahoo in Atlanta or Charlotte North Carolina
to prove your loan you'll talk to people right here who will approve your loan
or not as the case may be and they've also got the lowest service fee anywhere in
Broward County family bank offers all the features of any other bank like ATMs
at every location honoring press their honor and service networks and you'll find
them all over the place in Broward there are seven family bank locations
including one out there in the sawgrass by me great go and mad and one right up
the street here on Sterling Road in Hollywood family bank do a business the
traditional way locally because customer satisfaction is what they're all
built so if you're pissed off if you're unhappy if you're sick and tired of all
the scrubs with your bank make the smart switch to family bank member of the IC
he said he bought it for you and he pulled out a gun I said I'm just learning
electronics when I want many in that he said his lesson what old you
a lot for a loop for a lot of money as I lay there I thought I was tired
someone called the paramedics I presume then another dude said man you pathetic
honky bull do the bottom thing it will be this and you take a book
take a book now how do you like it take a book take a book that you don't like it
take a book take a book the honky don't like it take a book take a book

take a book take a book now how do you like it take a book take a book that you don't like it take a book

220 out of townlines as in both of those 1.48474 9463 I might just not give these tickets away today
the way this is going talk about a welcome back on Monday morning man talk about a good
swift kick in the ass here's Port St. Lucie on a mobile hello have your money Neil back to you
this weekend was watching Saturday night live yes I think somebody up there is listed you because
they were doing a bit it's beginning of the show where they showed this Italian family that hand
paints the cue cards it takes an hour per cue card and the first cue card they held up said wow
I think I pooped my pants oh my god and I thought next week you're holding one up that says
that that that that that that yeah that was it but I figured you'd get a I get out of that I love it all
right well this is I pooped my pants yep and this is a skinny Italian for marketing phone I love you Neil
all right have a good day bonjournal bye bye yes skip to tag in class Saturday morning I was just
ready to blow my brains out in fact I still am but you know the show must go on it's just show
business folks it's just a radio show it's just entertainment it's not the beginning and end of
the world that's obvious judging from these phones it's not really often important
made a lot of really great people at the Gandalf the other night Saturday a lot of people
over there at best buy in uh over by the sub-rest yesterday went in there to pick up a couple of
things like some fact paper for my facts machine and a couple of other minor little things and
demand everybody in there they were genuinely reflecting everywhere you go everybody listens to
this show okay everybody in the world listens to this show it's amazing nobody calls it but they
all listen to it that's all accounts we don't mind don't bother calling me because you got important
things that when you don't need these stupid tickets anyway and I will demean you and degrade you
won't probably not give me anyway but hey it's worth a shot the price is right what does it cost
cheaper than a lottery ticket why how do you like to have won a lottery this week
seven million dollars a putrid seven million and three winners so that's like two and uh two and a
third million right pretty weak pretty weak 20 years not but they still do it that way that they
do that in newty business which is a real rip off which makes it even a bigger uh sucker bet
than anything else in the world that lottery but I think they still do the annuity so they pay
you like over 20 years and uh what's two and a half minutes that's like what about a hundred little
over a hundred grand a year after some of your slumpers out there that would be oh my god there you
go i'm gonna retire like you you could retire in a hundred grand a year easy right sure i'll take it
no seriously couldn't you for the rest of your life okay
who puts a small town low cost of living sure what do you mean by that
can't cost you a hundred grand a year to live now unless you're deeply in the minus column
oh that's right i forgot you are making the big bucks now you got that title i forgot about
this right here's a mobile in the hollywood hello
oh
brilliant and the best part of the whole thing is that they wouldn't go off of there
broward county opens seven eight seven seven six seven give the right number that might help
i won't make any difference seven six seven nine four six three seven six seven
eight eight eight eight the crowd and a friend you there is Saturday afternoon
eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight
he caught it up he got the crafty out of a net fight they got their favorites baby don't confuse
them with the facts i still say let's make that deal malin by the way talking about making deal with
Montreal they're desperate that deal they got to make a deal pretty soon pretty fast
because they stink that you on out they made the leaves look like a real team Saturday night
leaves five Montreal one oh baby we want a game i'll get too excited about if a boy those kind
of games they are pathetic they need a good defenseman okay which i guess leaves Eddie out
haven't i told you that Eddie ought to be a center that he's got great scoring instincts he
ain't no defenseman never gonna be he ought to be a center put the four act back on the wing put
Eddie as a center out there in that line and i guarantee you this team will start sticking it in the net
guarantee can't miss but they won't listen to me
and Chris Wells the healthy scratch again Saturday eight now that Brian was back again Brian
screw it up he was out a little trouble after each if he was going over there puking his guts out he
said on the bench after each shift and losing every face off in fact they're what we do lose about
90% of the important face offs 98% in that game yes we did including the one there at the end when
they scored and learned rustifted and over time but hey it's just a game and they won again last night
they beat the Rangers and kind of a i don't know that was kind of a marginal game to be honest with it
here we throw and try to make it into something that it wasn't but thanks to guards no all of a
sudden found a life and don't ever lose anymore hextall sitting on a bench and snow is
winning for the flyers night after night after night after night after day after day after day but
i'm gonna tell you something forget about them let me give you a little tip right now there's
three teams in league right now there's the Buffalo Sabers who win every day not just most of the
time they win every day and there's the Dallas stars the Colorado Avalanche who both win every
single stinking day those are the three teams right now boys and girls for all you age people
1028 at W I O D
6 times W I O D about his functional as Al Bundy back at oh 1031 W S O was Tommy Kramer that got
everybody crazy this morning and cooked up that really a half baked stupid thing about
Dustin Hoffman being dead which he's not by the way I just I was sitting back there in our
little locubicle back there and I heard some I thought it sounded like Tommy Kramer saying about
they just saw the they reran the graduate on TV over the weekend and he just saw Dustin Hoffman
again then he found out he was dead and I you know my ears picked up a little bit at that point
and I thought to myself he's dead and then I heard the rest of it and I realized he's not dead
and Pornginel down at the tax and main building doesn't need all these goofballs calling up
wondering uh what you know yeah wouldn't you have thought it might be in the newspaper like
on the news or somewhere if he really were dead was dead might be dead but he's not
Dustin Hoffman still alive they hit him with five shots and he stood five I said not six and he
still alive I mean what kind of crap is that plus he wasn't at the Empire State Building over the weekend
see there you go folks America one more time but I'm not going to go into it because you don't
care you accepted I mean dead babies and dead tourists and all of a you accepted it's a big joke
it's very funny and I you know that's fine and if that's the way you think that life ought to be
I'm very happy for it I'm very unhappy for you I'm very unhappy for me because I'm surrounded by
people who believe that this is the way things ought to be but hey that's what Howard Biel said too
and look what it got him here's the mobile in Miami hello hey Neil how old when was Diaz oh
everything's great listen I you know you know you know Athena you turned me on to hockey yeah and I was
watching the games uh yeah the the pants is a little bit of a horn is when uh Garvin love got
uh me yeah the least thing thought of retaliation yeah oh it's good we still lost the game though I
know it was just a point it was a heartbreak Melody came out there and kicked the crap out of
fatigue although the Sun Sentinel says fatigue got a game of conduct in which case he wouldn't have
been out there so I guess Melody thought he kicked crap out of fatigue but he was not I mean the
Sun Sentinel man what a bunch of embarrassing fools over there what a bunch of retards he got a
game of conduct I live oh there's not a sports rider in Miami that are south Florida that knows
what the hell is going to want about any it's sad it's very it's pathetic it is although I give David
Hyde again credit the give him high marks for having a guts to tell the truth about Eddie in the real
story about his performance on Saturday this has been Eddie's problem all along he could score six
goals in the game but he might give up six other ones and you know because they scored on two
power play goals while he was in the penalty box exactly and I don't think he got three penalties I
think he got four if my memory is right pretty sure he got four I think you're right too and you
can't have a defenseman out that you depending on especially on a power play sitting on the
penalty yeah and you also I can't have a defenseman who keeps coughing it up and doesn't play
defense like I said make him into a center let him do what he's does best he's got a great shot
he's got offensive instincts make him into a center like Keith Pimo he's spashed he's he can
stick it in there he's not a defenseman okay guys but they won't listen to me because they're the
experts well you know I even though we haven't won a game in five games they're the experts I'm just
to dummy with a big mouth on the radio I know nothing why tell you what if they have a
poll I'll vote for you to be the next coach okay release the assistant anyway okay pal have a
good day and have a great life bye bye open line and date 622 WYOD we have a pair in
Broward 7679 463 767 WIOD now the sellout every game will be a sellout that's the one thing I'll
say everybody's in their seats they're all a Eddie Eddie Eddie it's getting louder and louder and
louder and louder it's like a oh man in fact when they introduced the starters and he came out there
you would have thought that Mary Olamu Wayne Ratsky Gordy-Hom or East the rocket reshard Bobby or
all wrapped up in the end of one and just stepped on the edge Eddie Eddie I'm taking it all hey okay
okay let's not get too carried away let's see what the kid does out there and sure enough first
couple of minutes oops there it goes and poor Billy Lindsay I don't want even single amount because
Billy's a great player and usually you know game after game and on-song hero but he had himself a
rough night you know a rough afternoon whatever what may I hope he had a good night but at any rate
he had a rough afternoon coughed it up once coughed it up twice really once resulting in that
breakaway goal by Bryn DeBor but hey he's he's entitled okay how often does anybody said Lindsay
had a crappy game very I can't remember last time so he's entitled it happens to the worst of us
we have two open lines in date 62229463622 wiod here's Evan Chura hello hello hello yes sir
I met you yesterday at the MRCost yes sir I'm calling you finally I took the day off just to call
you a lot of my people in there yesterday at the MRCost buffet yeah the food was unbilly food is
outstanding yeah I mean I probably gained 15 pounds there not I got on the scale this morning in
spite of some bad eating over the weekend and I'm still holding my own so to speak great I'm
hanging right on it okay yeah I just wanted to tell you also there's a lot of you listener that
can call you during the day because they're working yeah and you know we just can get to well it's
usually on Monday see the rest of the week people screw off but on Monday they have to like you
know get their act together again after the weekend and so people on Monday it's like
five hundred times as difficult on it's impossible so if I were smart I would I would not come in on
Monday the only problem being they decided to pay me on Monday so they realized that there's
that incentive to stay home and call and sick on Monday but if your paycheck is there you're a
little more inclined to show up so Paxco Paxco get smart right right well I wouldn't go that far okay great
great Neil I love you show yet I'll call you soon okay pal thanks good to see you yeah there's a
guy who just kind of hanging out there at the MRCost with his wife waiting to get in there
and have some of that great that's a great place great place man I'm telling you
and they don't use MSG and they don't use the crap they use canola oil they use the best
ingredients not a sponsor anything in fact they probably don't need to because that place is jam
in most of the time and yes there are some old parts in there I can oh speaking of old parts
I got two things here which are both related to that topic Florida's drivers licenses can be renewed
by telephone now are you ready for this oh your drivers license expires in the next two or
three days but it seems the only time you remember you need to renew it is late at night or on
the weekend sound familiar fortunately if you're eligible for mail-in renewal all you have to do
is pick up a phone or renew your license or change your address the Florida Department of Highway
Safety and Motor Vehicles Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles My Ass
is offering renewal via a one nine hundred call available seven days a week 24 hours a day
mail-in renewal notice is explained the new touch-tone phone option
so let's say that you've had your drivers license for the last six years and maybe you like
had a debilitating stroke but you keep driving anyway then your head is like out the left side
like that but you keep driving anyway they don't know let's say you're 96 years old but you don't
get any tickets because you only drive like five blocks you cause everybody else to have an accident
but you're never involved in one you certainly never go fast enough to get a speeding ticket
so you have no violations and they give you a mail-in renewal for another six years
that means you'll be a hundred and two a lot of other people will be dead they won't make it to
twenty five if they get in your way but you'll be a hundred and two before it expires again
and before they send you another mail-in renewal or just do it by phone and of course if you're
smart and you're hundred and twenty five years old the thing to do is have somebody who's like maybe
your great great great great great great great great granddaughters sit there and make the call say oh yes
this is Mrs. Schwartz and I want to renew my buy oh you sound pretty good for 149 Mrs. Schwartz
oh yes I'm in very good health please send me okay here you go it's in the mail
and you wonder talk about ineptitude and incompetence in this state and you wonder why we have so many
geeks and so many old parts who have no business whatsoever being out there in a highway you wonder
why the driving here is so bad it's like taking your gland in your hand just to go out there in a highway
it's unacceptable is what it is but they're doing it now not just by mail-in but by phone
oh no problem Mr. Epstein here you go you're 187 today happy birthday to you here's your license
it'll be in the mail tomorrow and don't go too fast watch it now
and in line with that here's a letter to the editor which I read these every day in the
scum sentinel because usually there is source of humor and comedy and today is no exception
from Irving in Del Rey Beach
hey in fact I might just do something special on a reverving in a moment here
the headline over the letter to the editor says Florida benefits greatly from seniors
your editorial cartoon by Chan Lowe on February 4th regarding the state song and its new lyrics
was not funny although we do play golf tennis and bowl and we do frequent the twilight dinners
local restaurant the twilight dinner we seniors also volunteer at hospitals nursing homes and
serving we care programs and open our neighbor's mail oh I'm sorry I thought in there some of us
drive cops cars patrolling our condos
that's right being professional yenthas our seniors have brought their retirement money down here
and made the restaurants departments doors and flea markets happy right you should live so long
Irving you put most of the restaurants like pumper next out of business by stealing the silverware
by taking in those big sacks and putting all the pickles and the rolls and all the other stuff
in there fifty dollars worth of freebies with every three dollar meal and most of all Irving says
Florida benefits benefits from the taxes seniors pay so tell the funny cartoons to the Marines
sign Irving and Delray Beach nice going Irving
by the way Irving go back where you came from soon okay we'll buy you a sandwich

discovery of DNA cloning of the sheep and Michael Jackson having a baby yeah okay and the
second thing is only in Miami with navigational negligence be converted into martyrdom think about
okay take care of it have a great day whatever you say we have an open line in day at 622
9.46.36.36.22.2 W.I.D I was driving to work this morning by the way and I saw a
Vaguja plane coming into a Fort Lauderdale hollywood international airport and it made my blood
boil speaking of navigational incompetence or whatever this guy just said I mean let's get
serious okay these are people who like this airline murdered a bunch of people is the way I
look at it that that would be my term for it through gross negligence and neglect and in
aptitude and the government says well uh yeah go ahead and fly suburb not everywhere you want to
go but just go ahead because we like those cute planes you got man oh man and you think this country
you think that this government really gives a crap about us you'll be dreaming baby and you wonder
why other my crap is going on they're too busy you're doing graphed and stuff they don't have time
for any of this other stuff they're too busy doing graph they're grafting it here's Cooper City
on a mobile hello there we go there you go I was pulling for them Saturday yeah see those of 14,700
and three hats go back on the ice yeah they had a couple of shots at it too there yeah we're
we're really fun of course we did lose the game yeah struck at a big game he is so quick we were
out there watching them at the pre-scape I can't believe how fast he is so much faster than the other
guys yeah he makes things happen Marty and he waited that one one that goal he got the first goal he
went right around everybody went right to the net slid it off the skate I mean just haven't
it escaped but nevertheless he went all the way to the net and made a great play and he played a
damn good game and he did my play to tremendous game too for a change yeah he was hit in the few folks
there um I mean that's my first year of the fan and I got one is with those fans though what is
the any what what is it they like the way he looks do they like the number they like the fact
he gets it a lot of stupid fights what is it now come I keep hearing my echo back on your phone
I don't know why I like it though I like the sound but it's great like reverb is a big guy I don't
know that's what they like they like it big the fans are fans they like it big I got a question
Neil yes sir why do the fans sometimes start with one like I said I'm a new fan this year you're
asking me yeah they start whistling like when they're playing for a while I guess what I'm thinking
maybe they want a goal or something I heard a lot during the range whistling usually means if the
referee makes a crappy colleague start whistling or else they start yelling of senators Adam which is
more appropriate or you know I don't know who knows it's a job thing that only the what is it okay
get a new phone pound have a great like we have an open line on the a purple mobile line not
a pound io d and we have one in brown at seven six seven yeah those match y'all fans they are brutal
they're the worst they're worse than a Philadelphia fans they are the worst Canadians were sticking
the joint out there on saturday this poor kid the theater Joe Jose theater was in nets for
match y'all he had one like three games in a row for them and played his guts up playing
tremendously well and he plays one bad game and did let a couple of really greasy goals by
window clerk but nevertheless uh place one bad game and they were then from that point on as
soon as he would stop even a little a little shoot in you know they're doing the jeering in a
sarcastic applaud you people from Montreal man exactly whatever that was that just was on here the
exol of it and then some second that emotion you suck go back to Montreal you frogs you they're
disgusting there a bunch of pigs and the best part of the whole deal is for some reason I don't

crowds here tonight in Montreal was leaf fans they were yelling go leafs go louder than they do in
Toronto eight it was great but I won't bore you with the highlights go to I already raised the tape
