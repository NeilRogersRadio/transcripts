Look, I have to show you how to use it, don't I?
Well, okay.
You have a little under your shoulder.
And they're rubbing like this.
Okay.
How does that feel?
You're pretty good.
Your muscles are so high.
Yeah, I want my spine keeping straight.
I need this heart all over.
Excuse me.
Are you feeling hot yet?
And not really.
I know I am.
Look, I'm really feeling a lot better now.

Now, how much we scouting our tickets for today?
Here's Carl Gables.
Hello.
Neil, good afternoon sir.
Good afternoon sir.
When it's time to this.
I was just coming south from downtown and I saw a nice billboard with big fats regarding your push.
Again?
Yeah, it looks pretty good.
Well, I got news for you, man.
You better take a good look at it because the word I have is those are coming down real fast.
And our new PD says we better get those down.
He's absolutely right.
They never should have been put up in the first place.
Why are they spending all that money promoting the guy who's on his way out?
No idea.
I think I'm going to take a picture of it though.
Please.
Anyway, I was wondering if I could get a couple of friends of mine these bags.
But before you do that, tell me where it was.
I was coming right on a 40th avenue across the US one right at the end of Coral Gables.
Great.
Excellent.
That's where my people are.
That's cool.
And Randy and Derivos, you're a couple of carpet matching dish bags.
Alright.
Thanks for the good news.
Okay, get those billboards up.
Then let's take them down real quick.
Okay?
We have an open line today.
See, that's again, is the case where we got so many bureaucrats and they're not on the same page in this company.
And this one is saying, yeah, go ahead and put them up.
And it's what's saying, no, don't, don't buy us spend money.
We got 85 different people.
Too many fingers in the pot.
Too many fingers in the pot.
And nobody's getting to smoke it.
That's the problem.
Okay?
Too many fingers in it.
Here's Florida City.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, when you head on over to QAM, you can be putting out the best of stuff.
I think so.
You think so?
We're working on it.
Okay.
Are you kidding about Bill Henry?
He's just yanking it.
Kidding about one.
Bill Henry.
He's not coming.
He's not.
He's coming here for two days though.
Oh, good.
Okay, whatever.
Don't miss him Monday.
Oh, okay.
Okay, pal.
Alright, go panters.
See ya.
Alright.
What do you say?
We have an open line at Brad.
He was all over the place.
That's good.
He touched all the bases, baby.
Just like Gary Sheffield, there's once in a while.
He touched all the bases.
So Alex, something to join out last night.
Okay, notice the Marlon fever has already gone.
Stick that there.
Mollin' right in this town.
Correct him.
And the fever has gone away, baby.
They had it for like about what?
Three, four, five days there?
How'd you like to have the cubs, huh?
All you sad sex out there because this team don't win air.
Every single thing in the single day.
How'd you like to have the cubs?
Because it's going to be a long time before you know who says...
Cubs were.
Cubs were.
Cubs were.
Yeah, hold your breath, Harry.
You should live so long, we hope.
Open line in Broward, 767 WIOD, 2 on the other townlines.
They've palm beach lines, 1,88, 4749, 463.
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.
Hello?
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I want to talk to you about the ranges.
I've been listening to you for a long time and I recognize that you're a real kind of
sore of hockey.
Yeah.
Have a good understanding of it.
I was a been a range of fan for about 25 years and I had to live through the whole islander experience.
And what I find is that the islanded fans are very similar to the panther fans as being completely uneducated about the sport.
I'll tell you one thing, they sure don't show up.
It's unbelievable, but even so, I mean if you looked in the paper the last time, the ranges had more wins in their column than the fans.
Yeah.
And, you know, what does that mean?
Well, I mean to think that the panther is going to just go down below out the ranges.
Who said they were going to blow out?
I said we win in six.
That's not a blowout.
Yeah.
What is that?
What was the record during the regular season?
In the six games that they played against each other, what was the record?
I don't know, I think it was three and three or a four and two.
No, it's three and one and two.
The panther's one, three.
The ranges one, one and there were two ties.
Okay.
No, I mean, you know, the panther are great.
See, the ranges have got a lot of talent on there, but they don't have defense.
They don't have defense, okay?
And in the playoffs, unless you got great gold, then in which they can't have it for a good cut.
Unless you got great gold, then in a great defense, you're not going to win the Stanley Cup.
Now, you're absolutely right.
You're absolutely right about that.
I agree.
I mean, Ryan Leach is a great player.
Old Samuel said he's a great goon, not a great player, but a great goon.
And other than that, they don't have a great defense.
Yeah, the gold panel will make a difference.
That's right.
The other of the hottest is going to do it.
Absolutely correct.
Okay, Neil.
Good luck, pal.
All right.
Thanks, see you.
See, there's a range of pace from the Yorkier.
This boy said, doesn't run with that.
I'm sitting here.
I'm saying, go, leave scope.
Go, wait, they're all done.
Not go, leave scope anyway, okay?
Go, leave scope.
I'll guarantee you one thing.
The Toronto Maple Leafs will not lose one playoff game this year.
You could bet your life on it, okay?
You can bet Cliff Fletcher's life on.
In fact, if the lease lose a playoff game, I personally will put a bullet through Cliff Fletcher's head.
Okay, in fact, even if they don't, you know what I'm saying?
You killed my team, Cliff.
You killed my team.
I don't care if Sonny Boy works for the Panthers.
He's a good guy.
The Cliff Fletcher destroyed the team.
And that guy thinks he's coming back next year.
No way, Jose Cliff.
You're dead.
Dead me.
We have an open line of dates.
622, we have London Broward, 7679, 463.
This town's got Panther fever.
You can smell it, catch it.
Oh, here we go.
Let's hear the whole thing over and over again.
You can't.
You can't.
Oh, here we go.
Kill that bitch, oh, I hate to.
How could I do that?
Did I really play that last year during the middle of all that you've played in the cereal?
And I kept playing it.
We love you, Robbie.
You're getting late.
You know, that kind of stuff.
I mean, what is that?
Well, how could I possibly get so carried away?
And of course, you know who kept edging me on.
Oh, it's great.
It's great.
Everybody I'd talk to is there a whole crowd?
Start.
Yeah, right.
That's who agged me out of that stuff.
And of course, you notice, you notice the last time he came in here to do a hockey show,
although somehow you may have also noticed that I faked my way through that mic lying piece.
We did it was great because I know what I'm talking about and don't have to kiss anybody's ass.
And my client is great.
And we had a great, I think they're 15 minutes last week before the penguins and myriose visited here for probably the last time of this year.
Myriose ever.
We were positive, man.
I was so sure they were going to beat the Bruins on Sunday and the penguins will be right back here.
And we get to see Mario over and over again, at least four games straight, which we would have beat them.
They got no defense.
You can't complain about the penguins defense because they don't have any, including that big, franky LaRue.
Number 18, take a look at them.
Okay, he reminds me of Chris Wells on defense.
Big Gooney, Cascade and all the Alisee fights.
Here's a mobile and Kendall.
Hello.
Hello, God.
Yes, sir.
When is this?
How you doing?
Great.
I think the penguins are going to do it.
We're going to beat him in six, man.
I can feel it.
I can smell my predictions.
Like, the end of you noticed that my predictions have been right on target.
Actually, I heard it.
Three to one.
And we got the empty net or a devorec made it four to one.
And the penguins rule.
That's right.
How do you...
Marty's struck a guy.
By the way, the coach wants you to know, and I'm not making this up.
Coach McLean wants the entire South Florida crowd to know that Marty's struck is coming back to line up just to please me.
Okay?
Thank God.
Thank God is right.
Can you play that hockey tonight's song?
The hockey tonight's song?
No, the one that starts off.
The one that gives me goosebumps all over.
The one about to play off?
Yeah, that's the one.
You mean the one that goes like this?
That's the one.
I'll think about it.
Keep it every heart.
You're gone and made.
Let's leave them alive.
And it worth the worth.
And it worth.
This thing is so effed up.
I was trying to pause it and it wouldn't pause.
The damn thing wouldn't pause.
I don't want to say we got any problems in here.
Thank God that Max is still around.
He's gone.
Max is gone.
Things are falling apart.
There's a dream I live.
You hear that, Howard?
Keep it every heart.
You're gone and made.
Let's leave them alive.
And it worth the worth.
And it worth the worth.
Because it's been there for so long.
And it's been a long time.
And it's been a long time.
The father of his life.
Staying for the guy.
Yeah.
For the day and the evening.
You're gone.
And it's been a long time.
For the day and the evening.
You're gone.
And it's been a long time.
And the day and the evening.
But they say they're gone.
And they say they're gone.
Okay.
Roll.
Okay, let's get used to it.
We're going to be hockey tonight.
Hockey, hockey, hockey.
The playoff starts tonight, baby.
And the Western Conference.
And if you don't know nothing about hockey, your life isn't even.
It isn't worth a quarter.
Okay.
It isn't worth the cost of a token on the Toronto subway.
On the rocket.
Remember the rocket in the pocket, rocket, of course you don't.
And I'm going to tell you one thing.
And I mean this from the bottom of my heart.
If any of the crap starts in the first playoff game or any to playoff game.
That we saw in Pittsburgh game in section 106 tomorrow night.
There is going to be some action at Jackson, baby.
I'm going to tell you that right now.
If you want to poch the around, do it before the game.
Do it in between the periods.
Okay.
If you want to get on your hands and knees and puke on the floor,
go do it in the hallway.
Go do it in the man's room.
Go down to where Wayne sits.
Take care of him.
Okay.
But let us enjoy the game.
Let us see the game.
God.
I have never seen such an act put on by a group of about a dozen vozos,
including some adults who are old enough to do better.
I saw it at Pittsburgh game.
It was only the last game of the regular season.
It was only for home ice.
It was only the most important game of the year.
Don't confuse these drunks with that because they were already,
they were ice to shickered before they got there, baby.
Whatever that means.
Do you know what it means?
Exactly.
144 WYOD, Pompey, O Park.
They're doing it.
Let's see.
It's Wednesday.
What do we got on tab tonight?
Tonight being Wednesday we got.
What is that?
Where did that come from?
It's a present from you.
Thanks, Kim.
Kim just brought me a picture of Scott Melody.
And way in the background there is somebody which I wish I could make up to you.
Who is that?
Way in the background.
Nice going.
Right from the arena.
There they are playing against Tampa Bay, no less.
Like I started to say, only moments ago, it's seniors night out tonight at Pompey,
no harness.
You know what that means.
It's a big night for all you senior citizens.
Only four bucks gets you grand set of mission and program in a hot dog in a parkridge in a period tree.
And the dining room, by the way, will be open every night until the 26th will be the last night for the dining room.
And then they'll be closing the sixth floor and starting on the 30th of April.
The International Buffet comes back on the fourth floor in the clubhouse.
The price only 1495 for all you care to eat, including chef Iris Fabulous.
This is where it's get there early before Fat Rich cleans it out.
For all you care to eat, 1495 and I'm talking about good quality stuff, roast beef, all kinds of great stuff.
Door is open at 6 p.m.
Post time for the first race of the 30 reservations recommended.
And don't forget Saturday, April 19th at this coming Saturday,

It only took me four hours and nobody out there even knows because the sports people are all gone.
They'll be participating in the Dolphins draft.
They had pro players stayed in this Saturday.
The 19th stop by the Pompadoparco tent meet top race drivers from team Pompadoparco.

Everybody is building and putting the goal judge.
We're going to wait on the fence to the Guardian and John.
Man, these brook makes the penny for the night.
Big goal champion in this hockey game.
We are in the second overtime.
They love having won off the board.
It doesn't get out.
I was going to let my back down there,
but really cool catch up to it.
Loose your arm.
The only back back.
Now I was going to let you.
That people's chair.
You know, the four of us work along the line.
The past is on.
There's a better show than anything we see tonight.
So far, by John Van B. Scott.
You cannot believe what he has just done.
But please believe.
Let's show you again.
Thank you, Colley.
Boy, that brings back the memories from last year right.
By the way, Bob, please don't say the F-L.
Don't do it again.
Okay, 12-152 at W-I-O-D on a great Wednesday, man.
What a day this has been.
I can't really put my finger on why, but it's been great.
Here's a mobile in Pompano.
Hello.
Hey, Dale, how you doing?
Great.
Like I said, it's been great.
Yeah, actually, I'm in Pember of Pines now.
Anyway, I have a couple things.
I went to the hockey game last Wednesday night.
The devil's game.
Yes, sir.
The finest hockey games I've ever had.
Victor is.
And by the way, you called the score that day, three to two.
And it was three to two.
Oh, that's right.
It was three to an end.
Dorik got to be a smart ass.
Got the imps in that array.
And my whole section was doing the Neil God.
The whole time when three to two appeared on the scoreboard.
Yeah.
Anyway, what I want to know is just moving down the dial.
You and the Hummer have to like have a peace conference.
Is there going to be some kind of a summit?
Or you guys just say that?
Who what?
I just, I know that the, I don't know, just sounds like there is a whole lot of love loss between you and him.
Well, let me say this.
When I came from Zeta, the IOD, okay, eight and a half years ago.
Right.
And Steve Kane was doing afternoons.
And he followed me immediately, just like I assume Hank probably will.
There was no problem.
You work with people if you're a professional.
If you like, in addition to which I don't hate Hank, I never have.
Right.
Which I don't hate Hank.
I never have.
Right.
Let's hear it again.
I don't hang, Hank.
One more time.
Break it up.
Okay.
He's doing a time penalty there with the Hummer.
We have two open lines in date.
You won't get on the year not even close, but they give it a shot.
You know, it's worth a chance.
You won't get on.
6229463.
These people are just, it's a radio show.
Moth the Levitas they see.
You do what you do to make a living.
Like we're supposed to go over there and have a war.
We have to have a summit conference.
The heads of the five families have to get together.
We'll probably have to have Alan Mason and Jim Bokock and Buddy Bud himself.
And who else then?
The attorney Bill Watson and whom I leave it out.
Jay Holker, that's the wrong company, sorry.
It's too over there.
It's very simple.
There's only a couple of people that's in.
A couple of people.
That's it.
Here, it's like tinkers, the average, the chance to this one or that one.
And by the time you get through, there's like 85 different people.
On 85 different pages.
Here's Marathon.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Great.
Something's bothering me.
What is that?
If the radio station you're on now, if they wanted to, they could pull you off the air and not allow you to be on the air till your contract started at QAM.
Right.
Does they want to pay me off, yes?
But if they'd want to do that right now during the middle of a hockey playoffs, it's going to be a lottery because there wouldn't be anybody on the radio that would be talking hockey that knew what they were talking about.
That's a good point.
And by the way, keep in mind, I don't want to get you nervous.
Keep in mind, pucks, pucks and I mean, paction hates hockey.
Even though he bought that AHL franchise, nobody knows why because he said that hockey is a crap sport.
Or at least he was quoted as saying that.
Well, I hope I hope he's in the soccer.
I hope the powers of B are smart enough to see that this philosophy is the soccer is born every minute.
That's why he's got all those infomercial stations.
Well, I hope they keep you on at least through the playoffs.
I got news for you, sir.
If I'm out on the beach during the playoffs, I will work my way somewhere, even if I have to do it on television in this market.
So the public can get the highlights and the low lights and get some crap.
Oh, I'm feeling much better.
Okay.
And in closing, let me rest your fears.
In closing, yes, sir, I've never seen Bob Nice, Droom and Billings eat together at the same time.
Okay.
Every day life.
Okay.
Living in a past, those ranger, those the islander people living in a past.
Hey, why not?
Like the leaves.
Hey, Tim Horton's God, baby.
Too bad I put that damn disc away.
Okay, here's the day.
The hello.
Yes, sir.
Now, there are our under family living in the past.
Okay.
Well, why not?
Hey, Billings, he does not have a mustache.
True.
Meanwhile.
Thank God.
We don't want no mustache, Billy.
Well, my wife is probably going to get that big face full of hair going to the playoffs.
We want her face full of hair.
We'll get Ron Jeremy.
Oh, wow.
I don't want to bring the max back.
Did you see the herald this morning?
No.
A little note in there.
Fred Kusik has retired.
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.
Fred Kusik has retired.
The great voice of the Bruins, one of the greatest in the history of our sport.
Yes, sir.
And none too soon, by the way, as much as I love Fred, none too soon.
I mean, Fred was great, but sir.
Well, I remember last year you know how old he is.
Last year you were playing a thing where he was like losing his voice on the air.
And he disappeared for like the second period.
Right.
Well, sorry to see him go, but.
And also, CNN is how we're running out of time real quick.
What's your opinion on the Pittsburgh series?
First rated laffaro Philadelphia.
You think so?
Yep.
I don't think so.
I bet serious money on it, okay?
The penguins I hate to say are a broken team.
And Yaggers coming back, he's operating on two cylinders.
Forget it.
Yeah, you're absolutely right about that.
Now, what do you think is going to happen when they come here?
Actually, we're going to go there, aren't we?
Yeah.
You mean to Philly?
Yeah.
Eventually.
Panthers in six.
Didn't we go there last year?
Yes, we did.
Kicked their ass.
Same thing.
No problem.
Good deal.
Hey, go Panthers.
We're going to have Chris Wells spear Lindross right in the first game.
Get him out.
I think it'd be better.
Get him both out for the series.
He would be best to have Chris Wells filling hot dogs or something in the stands.
Okay.
Have a great day, pal.
Hey, you two nailed it.
Audrey's out there with the lead.
And the setter, Harkins, is cracked.
Steps up for four hands here.
His pass on the left.
Please protect the last two.
Ray Scheppert.
Scheppert in front of our scores.
Threatic to the more act.
Watch out for Florida.
And to the more act.
Who's for twice to get the row in last first and out in Boston.
Scores again here for Florida.
And to the right.
And to the right.
So far.
Before we get to the right.
That goal is his 13th of the year.
Here's Scheppert throwing it around with that.
He's got a right point.
Sending it in low, knocked down by four.
Oh my god.
That's so great for this one.
But that was just a TV screen.
And then it's in the stand.
Scores.
Powerful.
New nothing.
Florida, Pembers.
Where's Fred?
Lindsay, Harkins.
And it's on side to Melendue.
Melendue.
Watch the enduced.
Tell us the save of the rebound.
Left on the doorstep.
Scott Melendue.
Well, how it's her and that one hurt.
Tell us he's trying to stick it out.
Here comes Jody Hall back to back break the ways.
He's more.
Jody Hall back to back break the ways.
Misters on the board and Lee Greenow's way.
Perfect.
Oh.
Get it together.
That'll break.
Oh, one more coming up.
DeVile women.
The bark bark.
Never scores.
Ravenfork.
