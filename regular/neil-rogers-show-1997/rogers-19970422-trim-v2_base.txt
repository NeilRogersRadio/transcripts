610 W I O D Miami Fort Lauderdale
610 W I O D presents the Neil Rogers Show
The talk with Neil calls 622 W I O D and Dave
767 W I O D and ground
Somebody on this station said cracky head
Why are you just going to call it when I dream that
Somebody on a run and a ride you'll say cracky head
They go forward and I just lean across the nation
And somebody on this station called toll free at 1-888-474
Did some trailer park trash say and now the Neil Rogers Show
Hey Brian, are you happy?
I hate W I O D again
I suck my d- I'll be no happy
Are you sure?
No, I'm not just foul and distasteful
The dolphins are cursing and man it's distraightful
Cause Brian Cox and the rest of them are saying
Somebody take my b-
She got you, mother f-
Words of love, they toss in the microphone
The dump button just can't seem to be left alone
And all of this is because they like saying
Somebody take my b-
She got you, mother f-
Okay
Oh, but they play football badly
I'm so bad
How did the patriots kick their ass?
Somebody take my b-
Well, they make it to the Super Bowl
But with an attitude as bad as theirs
They were, they tossing our hopes down the stairs
Oh, man, rude, obnoxious foul and distasteful
The dolphins are cursing and man it's distraightful
Cause Brian Cox and the rest of them are saying
Somebody take my b-
She got you, mother f-
Oh, they're saying
Somebody take my b-
She got you, mother f-
She got you, mother f-
I like it
So did somebody on this radio station
Some cracker from some trailer park say
Crackhead Nigger Horror on Ron and Ron show it about the 10 minutes before the hour
Did I dream that? Was I having like hallucinations?
Did I just imagine that?
I mean, I realized that that show was geared strictly toward trailer park trash
toward Redneck Yahoo's with big pickup trucks and dobermans
Excuse me, I like dobermans, pit bulls
But I mean, what the hell was that?
And then they left her on the air, that was the best part, okay?
Redneck Central, baby, that's where it's at
Crackhead Nigger Horror
And the caller they were referring to was somebody that said
Hey, you guys with your racist crap, you're all done
And you know what, I think she had a point
I think she had a point
I mean, I could be wrong about that, but I think she had a point
In fact, my prediction is in just a few months
There will not be one show left on this radio station that was on it
Back on September 30th of 1996
Anybody want to take me up on that?
Other than of course, what's the one we got on the way?
Toys for Graham, he'll still be on here
He's got the naked pictures that Steven J. Gay
Now I understand that the new regime does not like those special interests
Okay, like I said, they're all out including that bitch Irene Richard
They don't like those shows, what they do like is some of what I heard last night again
Oh my God
Oh my God, did I tell you that Walter Sabre was the anti-Christ or not?
By the way, happy paysock
And I'm really pissed off at the Sunsend or from putting these old Jews
On the front page of the paper
Oh hey, man, look, there's a Jew
Yeah, do you see that?
You see what they got on the front page?
All these, and if you read the caption which nobody does
The headlines says celebrating the start of Passover
And it shows all these Stone Age, all Haseedum there with their pay us in their heavy coats
And God, they must smell really good
And they got a fire going over there
They got the burning bush on fire
And it says preparing for paysock
Altra Orthodox Jews in Jerusalem
Use bonfires to burn 11 food items or objects tainted by them
Oh my God, they're burning it over there
People are starving to death, they're a bunch of shleppers over there
They haven't had a meat in their meal in the last six years
And they're burning crap because it's 11
So anyway, getting back to a Walter Sebel
And the stuff I heard last night
I mean, I hate to break the news to you
But all of these trite little cute topics that people are bringing up now this topic driven
Which I told you was going to happen that they denied it because they lie a lot
I told you that's their idea of what a talk show is all about
Of course they're going to sell it anyway so who cares
But what did I tell you?
Oh no, we're not going to do that
It was hot button topics baby
So last night we had what's your name?
We had Aaron Keon and also the ski master
Who's not a bad guy by the way, he's a pretty good guy
Kind of like a doll on the ear, you know what I'm saying?
But nevertheless, she was talking about some story from Kansas
About some guy that gave his girlfriend a $9,000 engagement ring
First of all, who in his right mind unless they're loaded
Unless they're, gives anybody a $9,000 ring
Unless they're out of their mind
And then they split up does he get the ring back
And she's reading this article over and over
Somebody's got a call and of course like three or four insipid calls
Then we had here about water again
How they were house looking for houses
And water doesn't want to send a lease because they're not married
Anyoddy, yoddy, yoddy
And then ski gets on Aaron he's doing a thing about
About service in retailers
I really can't even tell you what the topic was
I can't put my finger on it
And all I hate to break the news to all these experts who have come up with this
And they're going to come in here to try to reinvent w-i-o-d
Which is what I predicted months ago
All of these tight little cute topics years
They've already been done over and over and over again
And they're bible by the way which Walter Sabo was the president of
This talker's magazine
Which you notice this is all over the building now
If you're looking at another copy of talker's magazine
Even I'm on the mailing list now
So if we want to start our own bonfire we got some good stuff
Here's the talker's 10
Here's the top 10 hot topics
Here are those hot topics that we can get those peaks of 20 shares with
Like buddy bud would say
Peaks of 20 shares if we just listen to Walter
Number one, cults and madness
Number two, science
Number three, politics and scandal
Number four, the legal system
Number five, conspiracies
Ooh it must be the trilateral commission
It must be the new world order
That's responsible for that crack head nigger horror call on that show this morning
Can you believe that?
And they left around the air
That's the best part of the whole deal
You saw my reaction
Crack head nigger whole
What the hell is that?
Man, oh man, number six is natural disasters like the run and run show
Number seven is sports
So we don't want to talk about that not here
Number eight gay rights and lifestyle
Number nine, arts and entertainment
And number ten, relationships and gossip
Those are the top ten, those are the hot topics
They're going to put WIOD over the top
I say, by the way, Phil Henry and could have been here today is doing a deposition
That's why I played that thing at the beginning
Just, you know, for little nostalgia
For little nostalgia because you know what?
Back in those days, back before this new regime took over
When Rick and Suds were struggling in the morning but never less doing okay
And I was sitting here fun a little long in the mid days with seven and eight shares
And Phil Henry was in the afternoon entertaining the hell out everybody
And even the sex bitch at night, you know something
Compared to what we got certain hours which I don't want to mention no names
She wasn't all so bad
Her biggest problem except for that fake voice in the a phony laugh was the fact that she ran out of topics after the second week
But she was another graduate of the Walt Sabo School of Media remember
Oh but you don't know who is coaching her every day
Harry penis
Coaching every day on the topics that is
I mean every single day
And she was a big star up there in Orlando
See I hate to break the news to these guys but what plays in Orlando
Ain't necessarily going to play here. This is a Mickey Mouse place
But not quite as Mickey Mouse is Orlando which is a real real nose pick in place
I mean it's like light years ahead of Tampa but it's still a real real serious nose pick in place
Up there in Orlando lots and lots of Bible thuppers and good old boys
I mean if you took Disney World out of there all you got is a bunch of fruit growers
And a few fruits and that's basically all you got that's Orlando for you
So anyway I hate to break the news to these experts that are going to reinvent this radio station
But all those great trite topics they've all been done until they're coming out of your ears
Nobody wants to hear about service in God damn Florida okay
Nobody wants to hear about it
Nobody gives a flying crap about hearing about what's your name is dating the you know after the first five weeks of that
Enough is enough already okay
I want to hear more about the ear wax though
I want to hear more about those cute tips
Do you know what I'm saying? That's what we all want to hear a lot more about is that waxy build up
Because because behind that whole thing there's something really I can't put my finger on
Want a lollipop little boy?
I really can't figure out what that's all about
Here's a mobile on W-I-O-D
Neil
Yes sir our first call of the day
This is going to be a great Tuesday man
You are so right you got no idea and the proof is in the pudding because nobody called in
There was such a low and phone calls you couldn't believe it
Yeah
And she was just grabbing for work
She must have read that article 400 times in an hour and a half
And how come she was only on for two hours and the ski for Msky was on what's that all about?
She ran out of things to say it was almost embarrassing
What do you mean by that?
She had nothing to say and nobody called in
So she just left?
There were times with nobody was talking
What do you mean?
Did we just dead air?
Just for you have for a moment
You could have a woodburning maybe she would have had a woodburning
You better watch yourself mister
You better watch yourself because she's in tight with the consultant man
This is a joke
This is like I was listening to the stuff that was going on on and off on this station last night in between 85 hockey games
And I'm going to tell you something it's enough to make me cry
What are these people thinking about?
I don't know when we listen in the evenings but I got to tell you something
They must think we're in Jacksonville South Carolina or somewhere
They don't they have no clue
They have they're totally out of touch with what this place is all about
You're right
But hey, have a great day
Thanks a lot
Okay
Hey, that's the first day of Pasa or what the hell you want
Look at that board we got we got no calls here today
Panta is playing the Rangers in New York tonight
I'm going to play all my hockey huts stuff today
I got some great exciting stuff I got Rick Jennerette
I got Bob Cole from one Edmonton tie that came up on Sunday night with three goals in a minute and 56 span
I got some great stuff because I'm not going to say to read talk about some asshole paid $9,000 for an engagement ring in Kansas somewhere
And should he get it back?
You know something I don't care if he gets it back
Do you care if he gets it back?
I don't care
I do care about that crackhead nigger or comment on Ron and Ron this morning
Next thing they're going to be talking about the hurricane football team
I mean what the hell is that?
And if anybody can't tell the difference I feel really sorry for you okay
Okay, let's take these hot topics one by one
Cults and madness what do you say
622 W
What do you mean by that?
No, that's the way she did it last night she read the article
She read like a little blurb out of it
Okay, he spent $9,000 he wants to ring back okay
622 W.I.O.D. it's called contrived man contrived
And be sure and present it in such a way that it'll really get the audience whipped up into a frenzy
Contrived controversy what do you think are you pissed off or what?
There we go let's get him pissed man
It's a pay song it's even a work day today for teachers
Why can't they just be honest and say it's a Jewish holiday
Why can't they say that?
The Jews are celebrating pay song today they're eating cardboard
What's wrong with telling kids the truth?
Oh, it's a teachers a work day isn't that what they're calling it by the way?
Teachers work day when it's a glial show holiday when it's Easter
It's Easter it's Christmas it's Easter it's whatever
Which I guess basically that's it
But when it's a Jewish holiday it's never like a Jewish holiday
Because Jews are a small minority so it's a teachers work day today
We got to pacify the Jews you know that's the way it goes
Kind of crap is that it's pace it's pace over man
Oh God I'm gagging on something here I think they got the poison gas going again speaking of Hermann Gehring
I think they're piping a poison gas in here the Paxing people
I wouldn't be surprised if Walter Sebo has got his fine finger in that
Or maybe his fine q-tip is stuck in the middle of this conspiracy
And conspiracies is number five on the list by the way
Let's talk about the Paxing conspiracy that's one of those hot topics
That sure to get his peaks of 20 shares
They don't like all that inside talk. Oh, that's right
Let's see we don't like the inside talk we don't want people talking about W.I.O.D. because nobody cares about the station
We don't want to talk about any of the things that are going on inside
We don't want the producers talking on the air. Sorry
Asshole
We want those hot button topics let's get back to what it's all about
Okay, what do you think war or peace?
Life or death? Right or the far right or the far left?
Has it him with long a piece?
Who's got the better dreadlocks the Hasidim or Ronnie B?
That's our poll question today, okay?
Crackhead nigger whore what what kind of animal?
What kind of piece of redneck trailer park trail she's on Jenny Jones today?
Okay, be sure to check that out
Comes up with a comment like that
See those guys haven't figured it out yet this ain't Tampa
They haven't figured that out yet
And to show you what geniuses the Paxen people are
Their show goes off the year at nine o'clock in Tampa on a station that they own
Paxen owns the station they cut their show off at nine o'clock in the morning
Which was their home base up until three four months ago
Can you figure that out?
I mean how many cubic sir Coney is the half to buy before you can figure what that's all about
Six ten W.I.O.D.
Oh Neil Rodden, what are those on your feet shoes?
What else?
S.O.C.K.S.
You just said kiss my ass in Cantonese
Oh, I'm sorry
Don't be sorry, hey what's that around your waist?
About?
Spell it
You just told someone to f*** off in Zulu
Oh my
And that's just one of the many techniques you'll learn with the National Profaniks language cassette program
National Profaniks can have you cursing in Spanish, French, Italian, German, and a host of other languages in just a few weeks
So call 1-800-F*** you today
Because the most important thing you'll need to know about other cultures is how to tell somebody off
Say buddy S-O-C-K.S.
Okay, okay 10-19 at W.I.O.D.
Here's a lady in Miami, hello
Hi
Yes ma'am
I got a change of topic for you today
What do you think about mandatory sterilization for kids who are on adults who are on welfare
That have more than three kids with three different fathers
Well how come your radio is up in the back first of all?
I think they're definitely ought to be mandatory sterilization for trailer park trash
Do you think it's that farly just civil rights?
Did you hear what I just said?
Yeah
Yeah
I think that anybody who lives in a trailer park first that we should do that by the end of the week
Sterilize everybody in America who lives in a trailer park
Sounds good
That's a good start?
Sounds good
Then I think that anybody who makes under 50 grand a year they ought to be sterilized
Because they can't afford to raise kids
Right
Right
I think that what will happen is we'll form a commission and you and I can be the co-chairman
And we'll decide who can reproduce and who can't
Okay
No seriously I am all for four sterilization
I think that if people can't pass if their IQ is like smaller than their penis size
That those guys should be sterilized
And women whose IQ is smaller than their breast size must be sterilized immediately
Well America's biggest problem is dumb people reproducing
Right
Dumb people making more dumb babies
Happy people don't even know who the father is
Right
Okay I just want to get your opinion
Okay see you at the trailer park
Okay we have a day lines wide open here
Come on we got a hot topic going here today we can get these peaks of 20 shares
And we get this one going
Let's yank it and rip it and pull it and squeeze it and pound it
And bang away at it until they finally get pissed off about it
That's the way you work this thing
Okay
$9,000 for an engagement ring
Oh that's the wrong one okay with him
Okay here we go
So anyway sterilization
Well you got to get in the right page I got my list here I got my 3x5 cards
It's the stabilization of WIOD
Come on 622 WIOD we're going to have a wild day here today man
622 9463
2 and Broward 767 WIOD
The purple one the mobile one line
Whatever that thing is pounded purple at pound IOD
Let's hear it
$9,000 for an engagement ring
He wants it back
Should we sterilize him or what?
Should we sterilize consultants is what I say that would be the best idea
Let's bring back Aaron Summers is what I said
And really you know what this broad is doing
She's doing like a watered down Aaron Summers thing without the insects
Are you following what I'm saying?
It's like watered down without the sex
And there's no spots in there anyway when you come right down to it
So why not just shut off the thing at 9 o'clock sounds good to me
Here's coconut creek hello
Hi
Yes sir
Listen I'm all for sterilization of trail attract
Yeah
And as for your question about what kind of person could say crack head nigger hoe
Well that's got to be one of them fish people
So can spear a cults and
Are you saying to me that she might be a born again Christian?
She might be an expert
That's probably attending a prayer meeting at the Paxen headquarters today in Tampa somewhere
Absolutely
And what I want to say about cults and events
Yes
Yes
What about science?
Don't start giving over my topics here man
You're going to screw it all up for me
What about science?
You just said cults and events science?
Yeah
Science rules
Okay
Okay
Excellent
Number one, cults and madness
Well the greatest cult of all is them fish people
Christianity, the number one cult in the world today that's right
And it's caused more madness
More murder, more mass may him right?
Absolutely than any other so-called cults
So I think it's interesting I think it's interesting that the mafia people are like very big in the Roman Catholic Church
Because the Christian religion taught them how to give people off or they couldn't refuse
Absolutely
And it melts in your mouth, not in your hand
Exactly
I think you covered all ten
The prizes in the mail pal
Thank you
Nice job
Walter be right over to see you
Okay, let's go man this doesn't seem to be doing it 622 WIOD and date come on

Oh wait a minute that's topic number seven yeah topic number seven toenail clippings
Yeah and he didn't want to get rid of him but he didn't know what to do with him
Oh my god just lick him
Yeah he kept repeating the same thing you know something it's you it almost be like a joke you think it's a put on but but they're serious
Because this is what they've been brainwashed into believing is how you do it here this is how they want to do the station
They're going to make it into light bulb junior are they light bulb light are they thinking that people are tuning in and tuning out so quickly that they have to keep repeating the same thing over and over and over again
Yeah especially at that hour the night
God beautiful beautiful beautiful so what do you do with those toenail clippings anyway I don't know how I made a necklace let him fly in all directions what I do let the dogs have
Have a happy bye bye happy a forum even though it's the wrong holiday we don't care let's have some
Homotouch and the food is much better on forum time and also at Hanukkah mobile one purple line is waiting on you today pound
I OD we have an open line and date 6 2 2 9 4 6 3 1 and Broward 7 6 7 we're inviting straight people and
Goiim to call it today which you're nearly there excluded of course but they will make an exception because it's a tough day it's paysock baby it's
The day when the orthodox Jews there that embarrasses that humiliates I find that so degrading reminds me when I went to school to Michigan state in East
Lansing Michigan and of course Michigan state is a state university so the kids who live in Michigan get much cheaper tuition than those out of
Staters so there was a kid from Owaso Michigan I could trying to think of his name was Allen something I don't know what his name was kind
Like a real Yahoo gay looked like a Yahoo because he was a Yahoo but not a bad kid but he was just a Yahoo he was the good Yahoo but anyway he was from Owaso
And of course there were many of us from like from New York and from around other parts outside of Michigan who were Jewish and when he met me I was the first Jew he had ever met
And he thought that there were going to be like horns sticking out of my head and that I have paced like sticking down the sides of my thing and have a beanie sold at the top of my head
You didn't show him your tail did you know I did not I didn't even show my back home but now that I think of it now he wasn't that good but at any rate you know this is and you look on the front page of the newspaper
You're talking about perpetuating ugly stereotypes like that crackhead nigger horror comment on Ron and Ron this morning and here's these old ultra orthodox Jews which I'm going to say it again nobody reads make one person out of a hundred is going to read the thing underneath a caption
They all look at the headline celebrating the start of passing they probably think that's in sunrise all the people are read the sun sent they take a look at that
They were looking to picture celebrating the start of Passover here's the fire is burning here's all these get keys with their big coats and their pay us and their big heavy hats looking like something out of those stone age
You crazy crazy ultra orthodox Jews you're out of your mind and let me tell you another reason by the way that they're the ones saying now that the only real Jews they're not Jews
Because it's a oxy moron there's no such thing as a conservative Jew not possible because liberalism is the essence it's the big forget about you can scrape away the gulf of fish and all the all the mots of balls scrape all of that away put it over there I'll have to be with it in a minute
But the bottom line is the fundamental liberalism of the Jewish code of the whole concept of Judaism without that you can't be real Jew I don't care how close to the bone they cut it you know what I'm saying I don't care if you've been sliced so small you're like an acorn like some of the rest of us you still can't be Jewish so the whole concept of that's like Jews for Jesus same same thing ultra right wing Jew can't happen can't be sorry you're out
Here's a mobile in Miami hello hello yes sir I got a question for you yes now I know facts and screwing you over but how come Ron and Ron had Betty boobs or something having a live sex act and they're worried about your program that's so well you're asking me how about giving me an answer I don't know I found out in I found out in the last week that they're doing like live sex stuff during the show I don't care what they do out of the show but during the show they're doing like live sex acts on that
show and this and this man is supposedly a goody a man of the cloth and goody two shoes in hallelujah and don't say God damn on here and all this other phony baloney born again bull crap that this company portrays with their Christian ethics in her manual and everything how can you how can you do business the Christian way when you got guys having sex on you're during a morning show I mean afternoon show that's another story what I don't understand that either I don't know why there maybe maybe one of those good Christians can answer it for us today sir I think you should try to get some trying to answer that
maybe somebody out there's got a good head on their shoulders are just a stop us your balls okay I think you're good so you should go to WQA I am going I'm going I'm on my way good for you see you okay I thought they already knew I'm going I'm going I'm going I'm going I'm going I'm going I'm going already okay it's a slow process I'm going someday open line and day six two two we have one and Broward seven six seven the mobile one purple line is open which is a bad sign pound I OD space off course in the orthodox use they can't call us today can I
I'm not really sure see how I'm I'm like in limbo and this one on y'all I'm sure they couldn't call and certainly not on shabbos but we're not on the air on shabbos anyway so what differences are make what the hell is shabbos I don't know
but on paysock can the orthodox use call us today that's the question right now that this gentleman who just called wants to know can the orthodox use have sex in the morning on a morning show if buddy but facts and don't find out
they have to cover their faces and they have to cover it up and are the Mormons still wearing those feel good what do they call those things
the holy clothes with little hole in them the sacred garments the secret undergarments are the Mormons wearing their secret undergarments today and which side do they have the little hole on
uh exactly where's the flap of the what temple garments temple garments okay temple garments I thought the Jews would be wearing those I thought
that's a good question let's find out today I think slumys has got a sale on them right next to the stale maca you can get one of these real neat hats look like an old Jew
I mean take a look at that is that pathetic is that make you want to care make you want to sit down on on a curb somewhere and cry like a baby
taking a look at that you wonder about the condition of the world today this is what people ought to be talking about and they're worried about
the martial apple white huh that faggot who the hell gives a crap about that he's dead already
he's dead who cares about him but you talk about madness and cults this is what they ought to be talking about these
geckys here right in the front page of the paper and these born again fish people this is insanity man nobody wants to talk about that
they're too busy talking about let's sterilize everybody we don't like which ain't a bad idea
we have an open line in brow at 767 w i o d the purple one line the mobile one line is open which you know that's the barometer
when that line is open you know it's pays off pound i o d we pay for the call mobile one we're desperate today baby

hi now i'm uh my am a resident and i just happened to hear the meal talk show
on my way home and i think it's absolutely horrible and i don't understand how anybody
with values and morals or social conscience can allow such a thing to be broadcast on their
station this guy is just cursing at people insulting blast feeling just spreading anger and hatred
i don't understand that i mean do you have children do you have a family do you care what's going
on you know in the world here that that just this bad stuff should be going around someone just
venting all their hatred and anger at innocent people i mean he just left somebody crying on the
sun the air and uh maybe it's very popular and makes a lot of money for your station but
this is really not what the world needs i mean things are bad enough i don't think we need a guy
like this and i really find it very offensive and and just horrible i mean how would you like
if your children were listening to that and growing up in a world where this kind of thing is
acceptable where people can talk like that and and be pain for it and be endorsed i mean
i'm just horrified and disgusted and i'm sure i'm not the only person to feel that way
please try and take consideration of you know the rest of the world and the other people that
have to listen to this kind of garbage and i hope you will because this is really something that's
not acceptable if you want this world it gets to be a better place this is not the way to do it
all right the who have to listen to this kind of you know as that they have to listen to it they
have no other choices of course and either you cheat she's the one to tell us what's acceptable
and what's not another good Christian i'm sure she probably got a fish on her thing
she's got a fish on her pus but she's going to tell us what's acceptable and what's not hey there's
your marioga or stick a one in there not enough i told you flyers and four i told you the penguins

with a post game show well you can straighten it out hey listen sure what happens to the sabers now

okay very good in fact it might it might be uh he doesn't play that great in a playoffs anyway
he never has they never go anywhere in a playoffs maybe it's the best thing that happened to him

w i o d happy twos day happy paysox baby don't eat too much motsol your kids out there don't let
your parents force you to eat that crap. It'll kill you man. Sooner or later you're
going to die if you eat that crap. So anyway here's some pretty interesting stuff. It says
proof that Jesus was Jewish. He went into his father's business. He lived at home until
the age of 33. He was sure his mother was a virgin and his mother was sure he was
God. Proof that Jesus was Irish. He never got married. He never had a steady job. His
proof that Jesus was Puerto Rican. His first name was Jesus. He was always in trouble with
the law and his mother didn't know who his father was. Three proofs that Jesus was Italian.
He talked with his hands. He had wine with every meal and he worked in the building trades.
Three proofs that Jesus was black. He called everybody brother. He had no permanent address
and nobody would hire him. Three proof that Jesus was Californian. He never cut his hair. He walked
around barefoot and he invented a new religion. All right. What was that? What was that?
What was that too? Well got some good facts stuff here today. Some good anti-religious stuff.
Thank you so much by the way. The more the merrier from Nick who talks about the
contradictions of all this the Bible and all this hocus, focus and bullcrap and has got a whole
great list of them here. For example Exodus 20 verse 8. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it
holy but then in Romans 14 5 it says one man is steameth one day above another. Another
steameth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. In other words,
say do whatever the hell you want. On the permanency of the earth ecclesiastes one four, the earth
abided forever. Peter the element shall melt with fervent heat the earth also in the works that are
there and shall be burned up. Ah. And on and on and on. Here in Genesis it says I've seen God face to
face and my life is preserved but in John it says no man has seen God at any time. How do you like that?
And it's got a whole list of what two million 485 contradictions in all this biblical gobbledy
book but don't confuse these people with the truth because they want to wear all that heavy clothing.
Save that for me please. Okay. We have all the Broward lines. Why don't we hear today?
Man kneel us on the ear. He's like foaming at the mouth. He's ready to rock and roll and Broward is not.
What a shock. What a surprise. 767 W. I. O. D. and Broward are topic today. The Halebob comment.
You like it or don't you? How about that tail? Anybody out there one other? It's got a turd tail.
Can't be all bad if it's got that many tails. 767 W. I. O. D. The mobile one purple line is open
pound I. O. D. Out of town to green lines forget about them. Even to go him up there and
Palm Beach or all Jewish today because it's paysox. Here's Halea. Hello. Hello. Yes sir. Is this new?
Yes it is. Hey new man. This is the first time I ever talked to you man. You're the best.
I am. Yes you are. You know it's I'm lucky to be listening today. I had to stay home.
Yeah because it's a Jewish holiday today. No because you know I was sick today.
Isn't that a holiday indeed? No no seriously they have school in day today.
Yeah. Oh my god. What a bunch of anti-semites on paysox. Yeah. Man. No but you know I was like
I did the right thing. You did the right thing. Stay at home. No man but you know I've been
all listening to you from almost two years now you know you're the best man for me. Yes I am.
Say it again. I do the man. I don't know why people bitch about your show man.
Because they can't deal with the truth because they're a bunch of mental cripples that's why
they're emotional cripples. Listen to it. That's right. I know that's true man. Well can I
pick off somebody douchebag? Go ahead. My brother Abraham and his girlfriend Vicki
her a bunch of douchebag. And brother his name is Abraham. Yeah. Is he Jewish?
Yes. Have a great day pal. All right. Happy paysox. Hello. All right. Okay we have an
here's a Julio with a brother's name Abraham. A.B. Hey A.B. Okay. Open line. No his sister's name is
K. Indeed. 629 463. We have Broward County. We're still waiting on Broward. Look at this. Look at
this on paysox. No less. You're going to burn in purgatory if you don't call me today and talk
about life on Europa. If you don't talk about golf and tag your woods today man. Let's hear
about tag. Oh and speaking of golf by the way. Another little contra-dumps. I don't see Michael Mayo
writing no column about this. About fuzzy zealard. Don't you love that name fuzzy zealard. Another
golf hole. He said Monday he was only joking when he was suggested that Tiger Woods not make fried
chicken and collared greens. The featured dishes at the champions dinner next year at the
Masters. But he says he'll apologize if Woods is offended. And by the way Tiger Woods made some
anti-dike comments in an interview that he didn't know we're going to be printed too. So all
these golfers are nothing but a bunch of far-bisoned goy-m. So David Halberstam just makes a little
a little comment that was much into about nothing and people are trying to get his ass fired which by
the way Michael Mayo still hasn't apologized yet. And fuzzy zealard says something about collared
greens and fried chicken. And Ron and Ron have got some bitch on there talking about crack head
nigger hose and nobody cares about that. I don't see where Michael Mayo calling to write a
column about that. Oh, there's kosher waters killing me. Oh God. Open line of date 622.
Broward County last call and Broward 767 W I O D. We got the big game. The Rangers and the Panthers
in New York tonight. Any interest whatsoever. Any interest in anything today. If I spent $9,000
on an engagement ring for my dog. And Karen case swallowed it. And the ring too. Would you take it
back? That's the question today. Okay. I had one in my mouth once. Here's Miami. Hello. Now. Yes.
Oh, I'm there. Let's get with it. I didn't want to get French or anything but I hate listening to the phone.
Yeah. What's going on? I haven't talked in a long long long long. Not a goddamn thing going on
this place. This is dead as a door nail. We've got to wake these bastards up. Get some of these hot
button topics to get these people going. But you get them pissed off. You're still in room for
dude. Yeah. I'm going to be in room for them all day today. I feel great. I'm finally over this crap.
I've had for 15 weeks. I'm finally all healed up and ready to rock and roll in this town. They just
can't do it. Well, let me give you some of the places. So dead. This town is so dead. It's dead. Isn't
this a dead place? That kind of God. But listen, when I was when you were there screaming for calls,
like casually walked over and called you. Now, if you would have said the magic words, I would have
ran and jumped for the phone. In reek. Oh Louise. Oh Louise. You don't like Louise? You don't
like Louise? Oh, what's not to like? Oh Louise, do not. How about you? Say I'm going to play
Louise. How about in reek. Uh Louise Miguel. But you don't mind in reek. I think you got a
thing for in reek. No, not really. But it's just like last time I told you when you had said,
I'm going to start playing Louise Miguel songs. Somebody doesn't start calling. Yeah. I mean, I jumped.
I'm going to start. I'm going to start playing Rick Riley bits of people don't call.
That'll do it. What station is, um, is, um, uh, still had me on in the California. KFI. KFI.
FI 50,000 watts. How do you call? You were letting all you doing or anything like that? We talked
to him on Friday. We called him and we'll come up. He's doing great. He's doing excellent. He's
doing great. There's some assholes think that he wants to come back here. I got news for you. He's
only here for those depositions and that stupid Brian Cox lawsuit. And once he gives the last word
on that, he's on a plane and out of here. The best anybody that gets out of here, they'd have to be
out of their mind to come back here. Other friend of mine, he was also a big kneeler. You left
from here to, um, to Georgia. Right. And he loves it. I said, yeah, he made the big move and
not too soon. I can't wait to get out of here. Oh, my, my man. What a place. This place is a
point. The people are like about as friendly as a cobra. What's up with that lady? I
I didn't go for a couple of minutes. I thought it was like a joke. I thought Aaron was back.
Karen Kay makes Aaron Summers sound like Walter Cronkite on a great day.
She is unacceptable. Exactly. But what do you put? What did you find her? How did you get her on
the show? She's the girlfriend of the consultant. The Walter Sabo's girlfriend. Haven't you heard her say
that 4,000 times? I did hear you say that. There you go. Incredible. I'm sure that had nothing to do
with the fact she's got the job, but just a coincidence. But she doesn't talk about anything. Yeah.
She's got the hot topics, baby. She's got the hot topics. What do you think? Should she give the ring
back or not? Should she give the freaking ring back or not? Oh, well, this asshole spends nine grand
on an engagement ring. They break up. He should get the ring back, right? Yeah. I think they ought to
stick their ring in his neck. That's what I think. Incredible. Have a great day, Pat.
Number one, dude. A rivet archie. Ciao. Now we got two open lines in date. We just can't keep the
going with it today. The Jews, they're busy. They're still doing their satyr thing. They're drinking wine.
They're passed out on the floor too much wine last night from their big satyr. If it was good enough
for Jesus, it's good enough for them. That's what Bonnie said. 1115 at W.I.O.D. Here's something that's
good enough for you. It's family bank. It's good enough for me. Let me put it this way. If it's good
enough for me, it's good enough for you. Okay? If family bank, I don't want to sound like arrogant
or condescending, but if family bank is treating me great, they're going to treat you great. It's just
as simple as that and they will. They don't care whether you got like five dollars or five
million dollars or something in between, which is more likely. They'll take great care of you and
your money. They're not going to make mistakes every five minutes. And if they do make a mistake,
they'll look corrected humbly like, oh, we screwed up and what can we do to make you happy? And
do actually occasionally, depending on which teller you get, they do stick a lollipop in your
thing once in a while just just because they're great people. They got seven convenient
brower locations. They got the lowest service fee in Broward. They got all the features you want.
They have a drive-through that opens early eight o'clock in the morning every day. They're open
Saturday morning even for your convenience. They have eight TM's at all locations. They honor
Syrus, they honor Presto, they honor Honor. And you're just going to love doing business with
these people. The old fashioned way of banking man, they get to know you. They treat you friendly.
No big song in a dance when you try to do a transaction. So fire your unfriendly big chain
bank that treats you like a number in a computer. Say goodbye. See you. Give me all my money. See
you later. Good luck to you and head for Family Bank. They'll treat you great. Family Bank member
FDIC. 16 WIOD. When the Don is in town, she's not listening to us. Okay, 11, 18 at WIOD. We have an
open line on the mobile one purple line, which is not doing too good today. See, when that line
ain't doing too good, that should be like doing bio rhythms, like doing psychic readings.
As soon as that goes out, it should light up again because everybody and their brothers out there
driving around. I didn't see no light traffic today. Traffic was heavy duty coming to work.
That was all right for me. Huh? But it wasn't lighter than usual just because it's paysock,
just because the kids are out of school in Broward. Are you telling me the kids in
day to have to go to school today on a Jewish holiday? Sounds to me like that. Mayor penis must
be anti-Semitic, huh? The one that sold everybody out to Mickey Ererson who just happens to be Jewish,
too, by the way. I just thought I threw that in there for good measure. Just in case you didn't
know that Alex, you two faced piece of third. Mickey Ererson happens to be Jewish and his daddy
Ted is over there in Israel with nine billion dollars that we ain't never going to see no taxes on
here. Here's a mobile in Hollywood. Hello. Hey, deal. Yes, sir. Are you being great?
Rangers are going to kick up. That's what I know. Yeah, I doubt that. Four two Panthers.
Four two no. It's already done. Four two Panthers. We have an open line in day at six two two nine.
By the way, get get out from underneath that thing, whatever you're under. Okay. Do you hear the way
sound like Lloyd Bridges? Six two two W. I. O. D. in day. We have an open line in Broward. Seven six seven
nine four six three. Here's Opalaka. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Science rules. What is it? Science rules.
Science rules. Okay, but we already heard that. You're the best. You're the best. Yeah, we know that.
Hey, question. Well, let's move down to list women. Maybe you can give me a quick comment on some of
the how about politics and scandal? They can't hand in hand. Legal system. It sucks. Conspiracies.
The way of life. Natural disasters. Can't help it. Gay right. Gotta have it.
Art the Netter Tamad. Oh, that's the same thing. Relationships in gossip. Go ahead and hand.
I just, Adam was asking for an interesting question. That is that if, oh, who was it? It wasn't Adam.
Somebody was asking an interesting question. That is the water sable breaks up with Karen K. Does she
have to give the show back? Of course. Okay. Okay, Neil. Love you.
Haha.
Two open lines in day six, two, two, nine, four, six, three, gasping for oxygen.
As they can try topics, just don't get the job done, sweetheart. It doesn't get the job done.
Because nobody gives a flying crap about some stupid little article out of a newspaper
that somebody bought a nine thousand dollar engagement ring in dumb fork Texas somewhere,
or Kansas, wherever the hell it was, nobody cares. Actually, I should know it for baited by heart
by an other whole article because she read it 65,000 times. Nobody cares. What does it have to do
with the price of rice? How does that affect our lives? Why should we care? Oh, it has to do with
relationships. That's right. We're doing relationships without the sex. We're doing errands summers
without the spice, without the penis and without the vagina that we're doing it.
Here's the lady in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hi. Yes, ma'am. First time call up a very long time listener.
Great. Neil, want to let you know just well talk about two things. One, the fact that
Broward schools are closed today and my son is home. Yeah. They're still a little bit bogus here
in that it's a teacher planning day. They did not have the you know what to close the school for
pass over. That's what I just got through sand. If it's a if it's a Goya shaholiday, if it's
Christmas, if it's Easter or some Goya shaholiday, they're closed for Christmas. Okay, but when it's a
Jewish holiday and we got to close up to pacify the Jews, then it's a teacher's planning day. It's
a teacher's work day. The teachers went to the matinee at Highlight. It's something like that. Why
don't they have the cajon's to say it's a Jew day? Oh, absolutely. And better still my last comment.
Last night, sitting around first night, satire, family, friends, having a good time. I like it. I like it.
Yeah. Yeah. Long rings. Hi, I'm from the Miami Harold. Would you like a subscription? Yeah, Tom,
Cox a hoist. Oh, don't ask what I didn't tell them. And this morning, call circulation vice
president and ask if they have solicitors on Christmas Eve calling the subscriptions. Right in the
middle, well, you know, they're anti-Semites at the world anyway. So that proves it. That proves it.
That proves it beyond a shadow of it. The only reason they let Bob Rubin and Howard Kleinberg stay
on staff there is because they have to have a couple of tokens. Exactly. Exactly. Well, go
panthers tonight or two panthers tonight. Peace of cake. We're going to wake up tonight. We went
into a little coma or waking up from your mouth. They had some a pace of power. Pace,
aqua and it's a mogen. David. They'll be okay. Well, my surprise. They'll be ready to skate. Okay.
Goodbye. See you. So we're our poll question today is where do we find the chocolate mottes?
Brook was having trouble finding that. Brook, by the way, will not be on tonight again because it's
it's a pace often. She's real Jewish right now. She. Oh, she's looking. Okay. We have two open
lines in day six, two, two. We have one in Broward, two in Broward. It's very weak, very, very weak.
This is always the worst couple of days of the year. Why? Do we have no glam in this audience?
Is the whole audience Jews? All those Julios out there while a one guy, even his brother's named
Abraham. What does that tell you? Even our Julio listeners are Jews. They're jubens.
Six, two, two W. I. O. D. And I'm going to play this Bob Kualtsegment from the Edmonton
Games Sunday. It's about three and a half minutes. Great stuff, man. It'll blow out all the calls,
but it's great. I mean, it's scintillating. The last couple of minutes there when Edmonton came
from down three, nothing tied it up. And then of course went on to win it over time. Just unbelievable.
Phenomenal. Gut wrenching. Teres your kiscus. Broward County, two open lines in Broward,
seven, six, seven, nine, four, six, three. As we we haven't had a call in Palm Beach today.
Have we all in a half, not a call on the out of townlines? What the hell did the rabbi do?
Squirt score in this kosher water, man. I'm gagging on it. Good God.
Nothing nice Jewish scam here. Life kosher water. What's not to like?
And these guys are real comedians. They say, oh, we're having a good time with it. What does that
mean? It's got a star of David on it on the label. Does that make it kosher? Does it have a little
circle K? It has a circle jerk on it. Yeah. It says a little, does it have a circle you want it?
Let's see. It says sodium free big deal. Big Macia. Oh, it says big Macia on it. That's what does it.
It don't even have a little circle you want it. How do you like that? Fet. I think it's trife.
Let's go to a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hey, good afternoon, Neil.
When is evening to you? Hey, listen, my new daddy would I'm so excited to talk about it. Yeah.
Anyway, this last lady she reminded. Whatever that means. I mean, we don't have anything for new
daddy so that'll have to do. Thank you. This last lady reminded me about the incident I had with
my new, my new staper delivery person, the Harold. Yes. I was sleeping very soundly one evening and
the 550 doorbell rings. So I got my rundown stairs in a in a in a a sleepwalking super.
Apparently she had thrown the neighbor's newspaper up and it landed on my roof and she wanted me to
get it down for her. And the paper too. Can you believe that? Unbelievable. 550 in the morning.
Incredible. I got you down. Have a good day, Neil. Nice call, pal. See you. See you.
Okay, we have a deadline. He's reproducing. Daylines are open. 6229463. All of them. 6222. I think
that guy gave me a good idea before Luis Miguel. Haven't heard a lot of Luis this year.
Too much Enrique, not enough Luis. I mean, we love Enrique at least I do. I love him dearly. You have no
idea. But Luis, exactly. Luis is so great. In fact, I was coming to work this morning,
listening to Luis during the middle of that show that I don't listen to on our station. And I was
taking to myself how come when he does his concerts here? The Harold always has to do this obligatory
review where they take a few shots or when he has a new album come out they have to do. They take
a few shots because they know that I am obsessed with Luis Miguel. And therefore, it's the anti-neil
thing. If Neil likes it, we got to knock it. Kind of like excess magazine, New Times, same mentality,
same much assholes. Dave County, 6222, WYOD, all alike. What am I doing this for? What am I doing
this? Why do I go through this? I'm not even going to be here. I'm a lame duck. I'm not even
going to be here. And I'm still pumping and pushing and yanking and pulling and twisting. And with
the numbers too. I mean, the guy spent $9,000 on a freaking ring for Christ'sakes. Can't you make a
comment about it? If you spent nine grand on a ring, what institution should we stick your ass in?
That's the question. And if you brought that as an opposite topic on a talk show,
do you really belong on a year? No. There you go.
610 WYOD.
Don and Mike blow.
All right.
All right.
1132 WYOD. I'm going to have some more of that stale Shamura Matsu in there. But it gets nice and
hard like a brick on the second day. And oh, man, it's great. Nothing like having it on a brick
when it's going in and coming out. Here's sunrise. Hello. Happy Paisach, Neil. And back to you, sir.
Just before Paisach, I went over to Admiral Coast Restaurant. Yeah. Oh, phenomenal food.
Yes, it is. Oh, thank you. While waiting online, though, which also was phenomenal, thank you.
Yeah. I walked around the park. Oh, yeah. I found this place called Secrets. Have you been there?
Called what? Secrets. What the hell is that? So, lingerie boutique, adult boutique. No. This place
was great. You got to get there. Yeah. Check out their back room. Uh-huh. Well, what's going on in there?
Huh? What's going on in there? What's going on there? Last of adult video, Falcons. Everything
you could want. Yeah. You'll enjoy it. I promise. All right. Can you do me a favor for my father,
the can't do who ran the state of the last two nights? Could you play Rostadjou?
Rostadjou? Rostadjou. On Paisach, I'm going to play that.
Rostadjou. Rostadjou. I say, I deny. I say, well, you're your boy. How come you don't
do that? I like gochetsu. And I ride the motorbike. Chicken soup with carnada. That's what I like.
Have you ever tasted? Cretchfish, fresh and cringe. Flanting and give filter fish.
That's much more my speed. Rostadjou. Rostadjou. Rostadjou. Rostadjou.
I want me tell you Rostadjou.
Oi.
I'm dying out of here.
Oi. Rostadjou. Rostadjou. Rostadjou.
Yes, my Rostadjou.
How are you doing? It's like you're smoking a nose-pike, bro.
Rostadjou is keeping your pants on butt.
Rostadjou is getting up and shaking.
Do you want me to come for that?
I'm going to get crazy. I'm going to get crazy.
I'm going to get crazy. I'm going to get crazy.
I'm going to get crazy. I'm going to get crazy.
How much do we just play this all day? I'm obsessed with this.
Oh, right.
Just the lick up.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
11.37 at WIOD. Happy Passover, man, which is another one of these silly holidays.
When everybody sits around, they have a satin, they drink wine, and they eat this, uh, this matzah.
Which, by the way, if we had some shmuckers preserved today, man, we'd be shmiering it.
It would be great. Thank you so much.

Santa closed dammit instead of god damn it right and i don't know how he that's it okay i'll
read it urchy we have two open lines and date six two two it's all bull crap baby it's all a
bunch of fantasy but you can't tell these people in this country that because they're so brainwashed
they're so their minds are so closed because they've been robbed just like this thing with rob
rhinos speaking of rob although guess who the guess who they were on yesterday opera do i hate that
bitch if i could if i could put into words she is so phony so fake and she puts oh well i'm only
worth like five billion dollars well you listen i mean the fact that that woman has made that money

educate the children while they're very young and their brains you know like that's this whole
thing that they're discovering now in fact the new newsweek magazine has got the whole magazine
is devoted to this thing about how you're you know when you're two or three years old that's when
you learn that's when your mind is uh because now we're hopeless so she says oh well if you'd like
to help general colon powell help the children of america when she said that you could see her
eyebrows were saying i don't mean it it's phony it's bullcrap just show me the money sweetheart
which there's nothing wrong with show me the money but don't put on a pretence there like you're
gonna save the world remember she came down here a year or two ago because they had another
deal where tourists got shot or whatever the hell was going on here oh and she had to come down
here because she felt that she needed to solve the problem talk about an ego bigger than her big fat
body that disgusting else you the board and cow look alike i mean give me a break opera you crazy bitch
but anyway rob riner was on i thought i mentioned that what that was i talking about rob riner
was on there talking about something very important about the little kids and about your brain

to share and he wasn't sharing in right right and but that was political yours is not political
i don't think no it is not it's not political no mine is my own decision it's based on the fact that

to reinvent my show and tell me what i can and cannot do and don't keep their word
well they do the same thing to them down there right but then that this man just walked off

walters sebow

the martshow
Homer
that
that
Although bigger Неferi's
Bring the
Yeah
They have
the third. I'm going to check the lineup. This Anderson messily and
pretzzy in this lineup. They used the score goals and
punches and the current edition. The 1997 payoff of this one of the
letters are ripping a page out of the historic pass by scoring three in a
minute 56ers. Two or four to go and these fans are delighted.
Any other half folks this is unbelievable.
Absolutely.
Surprise new game with a minute 55 seconds left.
Three of the series. Three three time.
Three or yet the time goal.
While Adela Starr's are going on the attack.
What's signed up now?
But I'm going to treat it.
Twoacie.
CK play back to tactical,
and settering him on a save by Joseph and other stop by Joseph and it cleared out a
breakaway comment.
Aaron and Breastling in, that's the truck coming back.
Aaron is the back of the neck.
Setters it, it's paired away.
But not out of his own, Miguel has beaten in ready shot all.
That just missed.
Dallas now hanging on back under heels.
We're in the final minute of the third period in a three-three tie.
An unbelievable turn of events here in Eiffenton 10-Eight.
If the audience coming on for them, her posky shot.
It'll go into the crowd, deflecting off the stick.
The crowd can't believe it.
What am I talking about?
I can't believe it either.
Unbelievable.
That was one of the great sporting events in the history of the human race Sunday night
Edmonton, where that great comeback was just spine tingling.
If that doesn't, then goose bumps up and down the insides of your neck.
Then you're not alive.
I'll tell you that right now.
You don't know nothing.
Broward County, everybody else is a filled up at Broward.
What do we got to this problem in Broward today?
What is the story with you assholes in Broward today?
If you got some kind of a mental defective problem in Broward today?
What is the story?
Too much MOTSA?
Too much MOTSA?
Too much smear in with the cream cheese and the schmuckers?
That's the problem, baby.
It'll kill you.
Broward County, 7679, 463, 767WIOD.
What about if he only spent $2,000 for the ring?
Does he get it back anyway?
What about if he spent $4 million for the ring?
I say the word stupid is operative.
767WIOD.
Let's hear some stuff about Karen K today, okay?
Let's hear how great she is and why she was only on for two hours last night.
It was enough.
1226 at WIOD.
WIOD.
Holy MAKA-NAH.
This is Joe Bowen, the voice of the Toronto May beliefs and you're listening to the Hockey Authority
NEO GOD.
Thank you, Joe.
1231 at WIOD.
Here's a facts from Sitzel.
Sitzel, that's his name, okay?
His name is...
Oi!
Sitzel, can we say that on here?
He says I'm a new listener.
I understand you were asking if Jews can call you on Passover.
The answer is absolutely...
No.
Not.
Not only phone calls but no driving, numerous other no-nose, numerous other...
No, no.
I know because I was... I know because I was religious at one time, says Sitzel.
I still believe in God because of a few undeniable miracles that have occurred in my life, but
became tired of feeling guilty all the time.
I'm undecided about whether I like your show, but I'll listen for a while before I make
up my mind, says Sitzel.
Some things you say offend me, but other things you say make sense.
Thank you, Sitzel.
Why don't you go back to Canada, you Jew bastard?
1232 at WIOD, we have an open line in Dade.
Is that like Sitzes?
That's right, that's not a dirty word for all you glamour that are tittering right now, okay?
Sitzes is something you wear on... it's like today.
On important days, like whenever it's real hot outside and you want to smell bad, you put
on your tefillin and your Sitzes and your talus and your Yamaka and your big, big silly
hat.
Did anybody ever call on tell you what those hats are?
What do we call those hats besides silly and heavy and smelly?
What do we call those big Jew hats that they're wearing over there in Jerusalem right now in
a front page?
I'm telling you, I really believe that that was in sunrise, not in Jerusalem.
Look at that, right on the front page.
It says celebrating the start of Passover and here's a bunch of ultra orthodox, they're
getting ready to go to the Emerald Coast.
Look at that, they're dovetting, they're rocking back and forth.
We're rocking tonight.
They're getting ready to their praying for the Panthers tonight.
That's right, it can't hurt.
Say an extra brookho, okay?
Say an extra brook that Wayne Gretzky will break a leg.
Here's West Palm Beach, hello.
Hey, what's happening?
Yes sir.
Hey, this is a guy I call on on Pesa from Connecticut, man.
All right, great, congratulations to you.
I like your show, man.
What's not to like?
Hey, you're all over it.
Listen, got a question for you.
Yes.
It's kind of deviates from the topic and it's up to you.
Did you say deviate?
Did you say deviate?
Deviate.
Are you a deviate?
We like you already, yes sir?
That a boy.
Listen, it's just, you know, not the reason it's kind of like a need to know basis.
Let me ask you, can I ask you a personal question?
Absolutely.
I already know the answer.
You are circumcised, right?
Mellow, big guy.
Listen, I got a question for you.
No, no, seriously.
My favorite team is the Yankees.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, slow down.
All right.
You don't know what the word mean, circumcised?
Well, it's just actually not my favorite topic, my brother.
No, no, but is that a difficult, in other words, you can't deal with that?
Is that personal?
Well, I just want to know if there's any homosexual baseball players on the Yankees.
On the Yankees?
Yeah.
Let's see, Yankees, they got Yankees.
Who that?
There's nobody left on the Yankees.
David Cohn.
No, Cohnhead.
Oh, yeah.
Cohnhead.
You're killing me.
Yeah, David Cohn.
Joe Gerardi, he's a fact.
Listen, let me ask you this, because I'm not going to talk about that.
Well, I'm going to say it for the more lives in the Yankees and the World Series and
I'll call it.
Oh, and then at Wap Pitcher, they got with all his name that, that Grease, who?
Nelson?
No, no.
The Greaseball pitcher, the Yankees.
Oh, millionaire, don't be paying it on Grande, you go up there?
That's one, yeah.
That's one.
There you go.
Listen, any chance of the mones, because they'll all hop in a pan.
Any chance of them picking up like either John Melendez or perhaps Fred Norris or even
Howard Stern?
Yeah, all three of them.
That a boy.
They're all coming tomorrow.
Thanks, mate.
OK, Paul.
And of course, you're going to be helping.
We have open line in the out of town.
What are you looking at me like that?
For I do not understand the West Bonnolo.
OK, I have no idea what he said.
What are you talking about, China?
Oh, I'm not going to be a good guy.
OK, he was a commie pinco bastard, I think.
Here's a mobile in Oakland Park.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I was wondering, you don't read the hero, do you know?
Why do not?
I know.
Why did they have a bunch of Jews on the front page of that paper, too?
No.
I'll talk about Jews in a kind of way.
All right, let's get to those Jews.
The day they had all the picks from the draft and the Dallas Cowboys picked that David LaFlure
a tidiac.
Gila Fluria.
He's playing with the Cowboys now.
And it said he was 66280.
Pretty good looking guy.
And it said Troy Aikman put his stamp of approval on him.
Yeah.
And the guy's quote.
He put something on him, yeah.
The guy's quote was, I couldn't believe he came down to see me.
I think you must read it.
I think it said he put his stamp of approval on him.
Anyway, out of Bonnolo, yes, the idea of deliveries.
And there was more skull caps out there yesterday than I've ever seen in my whole entire life.
Yeah.
Little kids running around with beanies.
Oh, man, with the curls coming out of the sides of their hats, long, gross beards.
It was like a sewer plant out there.
Well, you know, that's an old Jewish saying, if you can't have a big weeny, at least we're
a big beeny.
Well, they have a national weeny, I think.
There you go.
All right.
Have a great day, pal.
Give Troy a big kiss for us, OK?
I'm playing.
I'm playing.
OK, I'll play it.
I'll play it.
I'll play it.
Go play it.
So what choice do you say?
When this quarterback gets lonely, she likes receivers that are why.
I like it.
Some people say that number eight is gay.
Yes, I am.
If they say Troy loves the big brown eye, a-men.
Brackdom.
He goes down on his knees, a-men.
His guy's he likes to please, a-men.
Just lick him.
He loves to slap cowboys on there behind.
Bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs.
He's got a spotless reputation.
You've heard America's team has world renowned.
He goes down on his knees, a-men.
I can't some balls to squeeze, a-men.
Don't clip him cause he likes it from me.
What is that?
More paychecks?
We're getting some more paychecks now.
Just mail.
Come on, let's get a bunch of paychecks in here.
One would like a whole bunch of zeros on it.
In fact, Wayne was telling me before he said all the paychecks, he gets all that's on it.
It's a bunch of zeros.
We have an open line at Broward, 7679463.
I said it kind of reminds me of that morning show you work on Wayne.
A bunch of zeros.
Here's Coral Gables.
Hello.
Coral Gables.
Gone.
Coral Gables is gone.
Some spicken of Gables left us in a lurch.
Well, thanks a lot, Julio.
We have an open line in day at 622946.
Thank you so much, Leslie.
I mean, Lisa.
Well, I'm gonna call you Lisa for the rest of the time that I'm here cause at least I like being consistent.
Even if you're wrong, be consistently wrong.
I call Leslie Lisa one day and George is never gonna let me live it down.
That was embarrassing.
See, when I've discovered the best thing is just pretend you don't know anybody's name
cause then you'll never make a mistake.
Is this a letter or a check?
It is a check.
Look at that.
See, when I psychic or what?
Look at George.
I open up the envelope.
Here's a check.
Made out to center one for 20 bucks.
They probably want something.
So just cross out center.
I want to put your name on it.
Just a joke.
Been a big fan.
Bapapah from Coral Springs.
Tom and Coral Springs.
What does he want?
Tom wants something.
No question about that.
Tom wants, uh, thanks for getting out from the oppressive tax regime.
Getting a big raise.
And getting a paid European vacation.
Bapapah.
What does he want?
Twenty dollars represent.
Oh, this guy lost 20 pounds on the Atkins.
And he's sending us a buck for everyone.
Nice going.
Tom and Coral Springs.
Thank you, Tom.
A lot of people promised that they would send us a buck for every pound they lost to center one.
On the Atkins diet.
Didn't do it.
We don't even hear about Atkins much anymore except the guy to call me for lost 90 pounds.
Here's another dumb facts from Pa squally.
Karen Kasey that on her first date, she and her boyfriend were deciding to move in together.
She told him that she was a high maintenance bitch and he would have to quit smoking cigars
and he did and she trained him to put the toilet seat down.
One thing about Walter Sable, baby, everywhere he goes, the toilet seat is down because they know that there's going to be a heavy load soon.
At one point in her show, she sneezed and after her commercial break, she came on complaining that something was all over the microphone and said,
what the hell is this stuff?
Who knows what disease the people before me have?
And I don't want their germs.
How do you like that?
She don't want to catch our germs.
Well, there you go all over the mic sweetheart.
And here's another one.
I want to give you a cap.
There you go.
Mo brother, she's something or what, huh?
Snooty bitch.
So anyway, here's a check for center one that you can give to Tracy.
How do you like that?
We're not even raising money right now and this checks her still coming in.
Thank you, Tom and Carl Springs and keep up the good work.
Here's Carl Gables.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Can't hear you.
All right.
Are you on a, are you on a pay phone?
I want a pay phone.
Bad phone.
Speak up.
All right.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
All right.
I just took the thing.
The reason why your phones, uh, are not getting any calls,
is your phones aren't working when you were calling,
when you're requesting call.
I was trying to get through and it was all busy.
Yeah.
Sounds like somebody's are pushing it around.
They're patching with our phones.
It's probably that, uh, Roy again.
And one last thing.
Probably a Paxon plaque.
What is it?
Are there Paxon plaques?
Take it.
Want to play on?
Yes.
They are.
I think so.
Aren't there?
Maybe not.
I don't know.
I have to find out for you.
If they could find out, it can't be.
Okay.
Thank you.
See, I'm not really sure about that.
Are there, Adam?
Adam would know.
Not Panther Pack for the playoffs.
What?
We don't know.
We'll find out.
Okay.
We have an open line in day six, two, two.
We go on a mobile and purple line.
Somebody just hung up there.
If you're real fast, pound IOD, grab it.
Squeeze it.
Yank it.
Pull it.
Here's Hollywood.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Hi.
I used to listen to Jim Phillips up in Orlando.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
So I know you're not the only one that schleps for food.
Yeah.
I'm a fat shlip for food all the time.
Everything that I do on a year, people rip off.
Lee Fowler is begging for food.
Jim Phillips is begging for food on a year.
But you're not really.
You're not begging.
You're just saying you're talking about food and people.
Not really.
People are bringing it.
That's right.
And the food too.
I have to bring it.
That's right.
I'm bringing it for, you know, so if it's anybody's problem, it's people that are bringing in and...
This broad that we got tonight, this bitch, she's got a problem with everything that everybody else does here.
Okay.
Everything that everybody else does, she's got a problem with it.
I didn't realize what a toothpaste bitch she was.
Yeah.
She's been here three and a half weeks.
She's the expert because the consultant's her boyfriend and some of us are leaving anyway.
So she's the expert.
That f***ing bitch.
Right.
But anyway.
Have a great day.
She just vanished.
Okay.
We have an open line in day six, two, two, nine, four, six, three, six, two, two.
One on the out of town line.
Sometimes that happens.
They just freeze.
They're just so overwhelmed by my magnificence that they just can't deal with it.
Anyway, good points, sweetheart.
Thank you so much.
I have a great pass over in Paisach and Easter in Pura and whatever you're celebrating because it's all a bunch of bubble miceies anyway.
Okay.
Don't ever forget that.
That's the one message from this show.
More important than all the others put together.
More important than all these contrived topics.
Okay.
See, there's something called credibility.
In other words, if you come on here and you're talking about stuff and you got some credibility and it means something.
Nothing we're going to change the world.
But all these stupid lists of stupid ass topics.
Guess what water?
You wouldn't know a talk show if they slid for it.
If they slid, whoa, Rush Limbaugh and Gordon Litty up your record.
You still wouldn't know a talk show.
Okay.
You wouldn't recognize it with a magnifying glass.
And the show either.
Fony, phony, phony is the day is long.
Phony, baloney.
And his clone, the same thing, man.
His clone.
Send in the clones.
Yeah, hold us business about cloning humans.
I mean, what's the big controversy about that when we already got water, say, bow and his clone?
1244, WIOD.
Let me tell you about something no cloning around here.
There's your check, by the way, Tracy.
Tracy just came in here and grabbed it.
And the check, too.
Put away those purple pajamas where you people are starting to talk.
Six times WIOD.
The station that reaches the beaches.
The kid be heard in the office.
Hey, we know our limits.
Rock, dirty, tell me.
Yeah, but wait, yeah, but wait a second.
Yeah, I'm the Walter Sable.
We look like a sedan.
I want you hop inside my company car.
I got the pictures and taxidies out of my hand.
I'm going to make it you and Rainy old-style.
I'm going to save up, baby.
I can do anything I want to do.
I'm your consultant woman.
And I'm going to make it so to you.
I'm giving that phone.
On a crap show.
And a formula.
I've got the phone.
I've got the power to hold and control you.
Whoa, you know I do.
Where are I have a way to get your own show?
At a station down in Hollywood.
And I don't care if you're waiting alone.
Just as long as you can stroke me good.
I'm also saying, oh, baby.
And you'll do anything I want you to.
I'm your consultant woman.
Spread your leg when I desire you.
I'm going to bone you.
Oh, bone you.
Oh, I've done sloth.
I've sat in a real dog.
That's why I'm a consultant.
Cause I'm just an asshole.
Yes, I am.
1250, a W-I-O-D.
We're being saber-wise here at W.I.
You can help.
You can help it and feel it and smell it.
Helet.
Here's a mobile in South Miami.
Hello.
Neil, how's it going?
Great.
I think the pants are as well.
Take them and I three to one.
Four to two.
Four to two.
We'll take whatever we can get.
Four to two sounds real good to me.
I got a real strong feeling on it.
Are you going to play that last goal?
The winning goal?
Or was it the audit?
The audit?
I beg your pardon?
The winning goal for Ottawa?
No, no, no.
The one you just played.
You mean Buffalo?
The game.
Yeah, the three three.
But they want it four to three.
Or you're talking about the winning goal for Edmonton?
Yeah.
Well, that was good.
It was about the 18th time.
Yeah, I might be able to do that.
Okay, I appreciate it.
Okay.
And uh, douchebag?
Yeah.
Frank, fat,
Ron, you're all douchebag.
Bunch of fags.
Okay, pal.
See ya.
We have an open line at day six, two, two.
By the way, speaking of that,
Bokeh Brian just came in and looking fat.
Oh, look at that.
As soon as I said that, he pulled his poop again.
You see that?
Boy, that was amazing.
Didn't, and it didn't help too much either.
So anyway, Bokeh Brian says that
Kieran Key is really something.
He wishes he could say it on the air.
Here, camp stop it.
Aaron Alvis back there.
He has played an attractive
tonight for Robinson.
Here they come.
The Irish.

Amen.
Boy, that was some game, boy.
That was some game.
Sorry, you missed that.
Because what can I tell you?
We have an open line today at 629-463.
If you guys had the right sets of dishes,
if you had your milkshake and a
big dish and a small dish,
then you'd be, I'll say you'd see some good stuff.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Miami, Buenos dias.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
How you doing, Neil?
Great.
Listen, I think badminton players
are the toughest players.
I would say next to a golfer is your right.
I say badminton and tidley wings.
You got to have a good grip on your handle while you play with it.
How about chess players?
Right.
Yeah.
No, I think badminton players have got it on there.
Yeah, watch out for that shuttlecock.
Anyway, yeah, that too.
Yeah.
I got a request for you.
A couple of weeks ago,
you played something, a buddy of mine was driving on this truck
and you played something called Cowboy Dick Ichring.
Yeah.
And he ran over his neighbor's dog.
Did he?
From laughing to hard.
All right.
I guess you could play that today.
What kind of a dog was it?
Oh, it's just a mud.
It's a dead dog now.
Okay, then we'll play it.
Thank you.
Okay, see you.
Okay, what happened right there?
We were smoking, man.
We hit him lit up like a Hanukkah bush.
Walter would have been proud.
He would have been pissed off.
We have an open line at Broward 767.
We have two in day 622.
These hot topics are doing it for me today.
Alan Ginsburg.
This audience wouldn't know.
Alan Ginsburg from Arnie Ginsburg.
Hey, what's eating?
Cowboy Dick.
Hey, Buck of Roos.
There's nothing like a little cowboy Dick Ichring.
I want something.
I've got a craving.
Yeah, well, how about some cowboy Dick?
Sure.
All the cowgirls love my cowboy Dick.
And I should know, because I'm cowboy Dick.
I like my cowboy Dick with some nuts.
No problem, partner.
Introducing cowboy Dick.
With not so big, you can hardly wrap your lips around them.
My young and loved cowboy Dick.
Hey, I'm Phil Yearpossi with my cowboy Dick.
Oh, cowboy Dick.
Here, try it.
How is it?
I can't talk.
My mouth is full of cowboy Dick.
She smiling.
She smiling.
Phil Yearpossi with my cowboy Dick.
Available in your grocery freezer.
Ooh, once you've had your first cowboy Dick, you won't ever go back.
When you're filled with cowboy Dick, you'll scream.
Woohoo!
Say it again.
Okay, 1254 at WIOD.
We have an open line in date.
If you move quickly, if you get right on a hot topic.
If the one to do our...
...then hold that magic, slap me on my ass.
That same old magic that used to jump and pass.
Then he got eats and had to quit the sport.
Although he liked guys if tight still be sure.
He was always stealing everything with joy.
He even nailed a couple of Asian bulls.
Oh, I don't want to run.
Down and down he went in and out.
He went like a redneck.
Does to his goat.
Well, he should stay away.
But he could not.
He needs the cash.
And he likes ass.
And soon he'll feel that burn in desire.
But he's got eight.
And his dark sunfire.
He's had lovers all around the world.
The only three of four of them were girls.
And now he's old.
And he's got eight.
And soon down and down he'll go.
Under and around he'll go on magic.
Because a box of bones.

What do you call it?
What do you call those things?
A snowball.
Is that what you call them?
All these years I've lived and I never knew what you call those things.
You know, with a little thing with a snow inside.
It's a snow but that's not what they call it.
Shake me.
It's a numbered snow globe.
That's what it's called.
It's a snow globe.
Fargo collectors letter box edition.
Wow.
Suds are being pressed by that.
What's that other crap?
Why do you want this?
Because I bet your audience would like it.
Yeah, there you go.
There you go.
It's all yours.
Free stuff for George.
And that's not to be given away either because I need a bargo.
So what's the point?
So what are you talking about?
Given away.
Who said anything about giving away?
God damn it.

Wait a minute. One moment please. Okay. And even realize this one was on there. One moment
please. This will do it for you. This will set you right on your ass on Paisach. Okay. What
I tell you, George is converting and we're not talking Judaism. I like it. You facts know
your music. It doesn't lick them. God help us at the Aberlora Macarena. That's a great spot
that Pepsi spot. Pepsi's got the best spots, man. Pepsi and Snickers. In fact, there's nothing
like heating about two or three of those big king size Snickers bars while you're down
in some real not diet, but regular Pepsi with all that heavy sugar in it. All right. Here's
Dear Field. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Hi. Yes. Seven year listener and first time caller.
Great. What is it? I know it is. Fact my my medicines run out. So I need you. Sounds
good. And I don't know. I just want to say hello. Okay. And goodbye. We have an open
line today at 622 W. I. D. and two and Broward 767. I'm trying to get this other one open.
It's one of those. It's got to look at how I munged on my shirt. Oh my God. You're going
to burn in hell when you mung on your shirt on Paisach. God, I look like fat rich on a
bad day. I got to this guy after I'm going to have to do with my teeth. Come on. Open
up already. Will you? Oh, I just broke the plastic. You're never going to be able to play
this thing by the time I get this thing open. What? I don't need that. Just one moment, please.
Just relax. I'm just going to dig this damn thing. Like I said, I think I need that. Okay.
Open line in day at 622 2 and Broward 7679463. Got some great music in here. We could play.
We got Diana Ross. We got wait. Wait a minute. Before we open this, let's see if there's
anything worth opening it for. This is crap. And Donna Summers on here again with last
dance. Okay. Enough with Donna Summers already. That bitch. Oh my God. There's nothing but
crap on here. Last dance reprise. The one that goes on for like seven and a half minutes.
That one's on here. Tell my Houston. Get this crap. Give it to that spicken here. That's
silly. Holy God. Oh, my God. He acted like, Oh, don't give that stuff away. There's really
important stuff. It like what? What was on there that you want that anybody would want?
Bunch of crap. Thanks again for more crap. Tracy. Needy. What is your problem? What is this
sweat you keep sending us? She just sent it to you. She didn't send it to me. It's all
about your crap you're taking home, including that nice thing with a snow globe that
that woman wanted so badly. Here's Miami. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing?
Great. I was wondering if I could ask you a question or sub request. I'll be following
hockey. Now, I was just a panther. She came in. I have yet to come across someone who
can explain to me what the plus and minus statistic is and what the purpose of it is.
The purpose of it is to have something to talk about. It's a stupid statistic for the
most part. And it means how many goals are scored when a player is on the ice for and
against the team at full strength penalties, power plays don't count. So when a man is out
there and the teams are at full strength, six aside, how many goals are scored for the
team while he's out there and how many schools are scored against? Is there any like any
award at the end of the season for this or anything? Yeah, there's the Alka Celter plus
minus award. Also, also the prediction on the patches one three to one on an empty, empty
net score by it's available tonight. And also, I wonder if you can. Can you play Star Wars
just in casino? How about Star Wars Cantina? Yeah. That'll have to do. Okay, pal. Have a great
life. Okay, two open lines in day six, two, two, nine, four, saying he just obsessed with
that. Is he the guy? There's one whole year. I think it's him loves that thing. Just
calls every five minutes for that. And of course, if we want to format this thing right,
we don't want to keep playing the same stuff over and over again, because Walt Sable
can't really upset. But you know what I say? School Walt Sable, that's what I say. I think
it's on just 49, don't you George Cut Number 17. Let's give it a shot. Yes, sure.
Sure. You're going to sure. Okay, sir, I can't play it for it because George is going
to sure. No, I think it really is. Let me just check it out. What a genius, man. What
a freaking genius. So what do you think? Politics, scandal, science, the legal system, conspiracies,
natural disasters. Let's have one.
The boss will do with you.
All the six, seven, ten, ten, no.
One twenty eight of W.I.D., where everybody is Jewish, man. This place is vacant today.
Isn't that it's like deadly here? Everybody got the religion today, man. Everybody is
passing it over. They're eating the monster. They're drinking a wine, mostly the wine
part.
George, George.
Too much Bill Cosby will do it every time on thirty three at W.I.O.D. on a great Tuesday.
Happy Pace套, baby. This is the kind of day it's hard to pass over. Here's a mobile
in Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. Good afternoon, sir.
Buenos dias. Buenos tardes.
See, I got a roll. I did. Listen, first of all, topic flow. Topics only concern the few
amount of people that are interested in whatever particular topic that is. That's right.
That's what I tried to explain to Walter Sebo as he was trying to pick my mind and steal
my material a couple of months ago when we had a very nice, very mediocre meal at Denny's
up the street. I explained that to him. Immediately as soon as you hear somebody with one topic
and it's really boring in term and like about that stupid engagement ring, 98% of the
people who don't give a flying crap about the engagement ring, they're turning it off.
And then you lose any carryover people that may be listening from whatever, like your
shelter carries on to Rick and Sous and so on and so forth.
Right. Who cares about some asshole with his stupid, damn engagement ring anyway?
Not me. That's for sure. If I had $9,000 like that, I sure wouldn't be buying no ring for
the wine. And if you could afford to buy a $9,000 ring, who'd help with care if you got
it back anyway, you're probably loaded. You're most cubic of the colony and they won't
know the difference. Right. Tall up buddy, bud. Get a pubic zirconia.
But listen, I called you last week and left a message. Why don't you leave a message
with those people over to QIM about once again tonight. I'm going to have to listen like
a radar station with the 790. I know we had a call on it earlier and belongs on kiss.
It belongs on the FM Greg. Get it on the FM and stop short. Change it our panthers, damn
it. I came out and get it on a station that somebody can hear with a full post game show
and give it some justice. This is a playoff game for Christ sakes. What do you think the
odds are? I was very fortunate. I do have a big dish. I did not have to watch that stupid
blue and red puck thing. I got to watch it on the CBC Sunday. Great. Will it be on here
tonight, you think? Oh, yeah, they're doing our series. Are they? It'll be on. Oh,
they were down here. It'll sure be on from up there. You bet. Oh, man, great. And I don't
have to even worry about 790. Do I? There you go. Chris Cuthford, John Garrett, you
could do worse. You're right. I could have to sit out here like a radar. In fact, I'm
glad you reminded me that I'll have two choices. I can take both feeds tonight. Just in case
Rimmer screws up. You know what I'm saying? I was so grateful. I thought it out when I
turned the game on. And I thought that little blue thing. I said, wait a minute. You
said, what's that? Gotta be. And so I flipped it on. There it is on a boxes and abortion
man. They're killing the game. The game's last for four hours. They're it's long. It's
ponderous. They delay it. They stall it. They did it out. They got that stupid blue thing
that's three rows up in the crowd. The whole game Fox hasn't got a freaking clue. They
don't. Well, Neil, you have a good day. Go panthers and please no topics. Okay. Take
care now. See you. So what do you think about your capital punishment? Let's bring
it back to tried in the true. Let's bring some new ones back. How about service in the
department store? How about if you went in and wanted to buy some batteries? Okay. First
of all, I don't think you go into a department store to buy batteries anyway. You go into
your supermarket or into your drug store, but they got a whole section of batteries. And
you see the little ones there, the triple A's and then there's the quadruple A. Just pick
them off and they're going to pay for them and dummy up. Okay. And stop with these stupid
contrived topics that nobody cares about. Just like I predicted, didn't I tell you this?
Did I come on here and tell you as soon as they got this asshole consultant and we had
that stupid meeting up there at that hotel, which got really knows how much that cash
cost up there. Way to help back in October. Yeah, but we got nice notebooks. Yeah. We got
nice notebooks from Walter. And they're talking about this 38 year old schlepper car salesman
in Pembroke Pines, who's our average listener out there. If they, huh? Mark. Oh, yeah, he
even had a name. His name was Mark. Oh, maybe that was the mark that was coming down the
elevator said, F. Nearoger. That must be it. Not buddy, but son and law. Oh, was the son
law. Okay. Like I said, it was buddy, but son and law mark that comes down the elevator
says to that nice lady with their 10 year old little girl standing there in the elevator.
F. Nearoger is not once, not twice, but three times. Okay. So let's say just F you too,
buddy. Please don't say the F word. Why not? Forget it. Here is North Miami Beach. Hello. Yeah,
Neil. Yes, sir. Great. I don't know if I was dreaming, but wasn't, uh, still supposed to come in.
Yes, sir. Today, but he's a tight up with these depositions. He's the Brian Cox lawsuit thing.
I am. So it's my deepest apologies, but he can't make it. I really need it. He's leaving today.
Yeah. Uh, damn it. He likes it so much here that as soon as he gives the last delay, he said the
last sentence of the last answer to the questions he's flying on a plane and getting hell out of here.
As soon as possible. I can't blame him. Yeah. Well, he's he's Mark guy, huh? Yes, sir.
Any, anywhere that's better than this place. All right, man. That's all I wanted to say. Sorry about
that. Okay. Well, we'll get a hold of him. We'll get him on a phone one of these days when he's
awake. Don't be calling him like it eight in the morning. L.A. time again, George. That was
your doing. That's probably why I didn't show up here is picked off. We have two open lines
in date six, two, two, nine, four, six, three, six, two, two, W I O D. Here's a lady in Oakland Park. Hello.
Hello. Yes. Yes. I am. Happy face off now. This is no lady. No, it's a guy.
Says lady in Oakland Park. George, you wouldn't know a lady from a guy. There was somebody else on
the phone originally. Yes, sir. What? Yeah, he got got a crossoff somewhere. Uh, yeah, you're
speaking of a song a few minutes ago and Zeta had a hate song week. Yeah. And the most hated song
was the Macarena. Yeah. So, uh, it's speaking of songs. Guess what WJNO's playing? What is that,
sir? Boy's life sex in the morning. Really? Yeah. Okay. W off here by the end of the week. Thank you so
much. Thanks for the warning. What do they do?
When I tell me call me melanoma, I tend until I'm almost in a coma. How wide my amy and they never
ever use any sunscreen. Sun with me. 10 with me. Hope we don't mind. I'm a little
freckle. I'm not even a cent. Until we get melanoma. We date like a bun. You can sell the aroma.
Our lights are all on, but there's nobody more. Hey, no, no, why? I spend all day at work
planning that when I get off a go tanning. I get naked and fake baked. How much
lunges my skin gonna take it? My astrologist and numerologist have to help me find a dermatologist.
We lie in the sun till we get melanoma. We date like a bun. You can sell the aroma. Our lights
are all on, but there's nobody. Homa. Hey, melanoma. We lie in the sun till we get melanoma.
We date like a bun. You can smell the aroma. We got lung stars. Skin bigger than the metroidoma.
Hey melanoma. We don't care if we get melanoma. We got the best tan from here to Arizona.
We're glad we don't have genital congaloma. Hey melanoma.
Hey! 140 at W I O D. Here's West Palm Beach. Hello. Okay nice talking to you too. Thanks Randy.
Here's Margate. Hello. Neil, good afternoon. Yes sir. I'm at this hell. I'm going to rip somebody
one tomorrow. About? A non-family dental essay. Nothing heavy. A little pass-on. A little
on the cup. Yeah. A little 13 year old system at the table. Excuse me, excuse me,
with his hands crossed. Says grace. Really? Yeah. Except he's in special ed because he was
down syndrome in a board of education. Yeah. And when I find out which teacher decided to teach
him that instead of how to spell his name. Isn't that nice? Yeah, real nice. Did he mention Jesus
in there a couple of times? No, when he gets to, when he teach him how to talk the right way,
I'd understand it. Yeah. But they're teaching him grace. We couldn't eat until he said, you know,
we said some Hebrew words and said, on end, we start dinner. Yeah. But they got me really,
really upset. Good. Go kick some ass. Damn right. Okay. Question? Yeah. Before you go,
I get to go to Vegas this summer. A little vacation. Yes. I know you mentioned Rio Nogo.
Don't go there. Valley? Don't go to the Rio sweets. What do you want to go to Bally's for? It's
off the beaten path. Go to some place on the strip. Bally's is right next to MGM. I was there two
years ago. No, it's not. Bally's is right next to it MGM. You take the Monterey equal right over.
Well, George is nodding his head like George is the expert. If you say it's right next to it,
it's not right next to it. It's down the road, but it's right on the strip. Bally's is not
right on the strip. It's like, okay, whatever you guys say, but you said it's like slightly back off
the strip. Okay, don't tell me it's right on the strip. It's behind a flamingo. No, it is not.
The balance is right next to MGM. I went there last two years ago. Bally's is not next to
MGM. You're wrong. Oh, you went there. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You went there when?
Two years I was in MGM. And Bally's was right next to it. We took the Monterey over right next door.
It is not right next door. I'd make you a little wait. I bet you how much you want to bet.
It's like three or four hotels down. Whatever you want. I'm going to have to take it. It's all
paid for. It's not next door to the MGM grand. Believe me. Trust me. Okay, but if you say,
well, and then let me ask you this, what difference does it make? Well, it doesn't. I'm going to
want to stay at the MGM. I'm not care about that. I just want to know which hotels played a better
slot, but she said old hotels. There's nothing left. Who's left? Oh, where the slots are better?
Yeah, you mentioned tropical. Tropical. Tropical. Tropical. Tropical. Yes. I know. I know. Not the
I never liked. Not the M guy. I never go into Bally. I never went into Bally's. I maybe once. I
never go to the flamingos. I'll redone inside. I haven't been in there. I mean, you can listen.
You can only punch so many places. Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah, but there's things I just
didn't do the last time. I want to catch up. Tropical. I can't. I give it a shot. It's a great place.
All right. Okay. Thank you. Punch your brains out. Yeah.
And you're agreeing with him? It is right on the strip. It is not right next door to the MGM grand.
It's not right next door to the MGM grand. And it is not on the strips. It is wrong. Bally's used to be
the MGM before it burned down. Okay. It is slightly back. It is set back. They're conveyor belts
to take you right off the strip. But it's not right on the strip. God damn it. Close enough.
You better watch yourself.
Do you know what I'm saying? You, you little miserable uncircumcised spick.
We have two open lines today. 6229463. 6222. Pretty soon you're going to have a nose ring if you don't
watch it. Or some kind of a ring. What do they call that? A four-skin ring? That's probably what they
call those. Prince Helbert. Anyway, when it's time to talk mattresses, when it's time to talk
turkey about where you're laying your putrid body, you know, why don't you walk around with a bad
back? Probably one of the reasons you may have a bad back is because you're sleeping on an old
mattress that is headed. It's lumpy. It's bumpy and a mattress too. Pick up the phone and call
1-800-MAT-T-R-E-S because mattress shopping is a cinch. It's a snap. You don't have to leave your
house. You don't have to do anything. All you got to do is make one easy phone call. You talk to
people who really know their mattresses inside, outside, upside down. And they sell you the greatest
mattress in the world. Whatever kind you like. You like extra firm. You like extra soft. You like
extra hard. Well, why not? And of course, they got every kind of mattress under the sun. Seely
posture. Pedic. Surder. Perfect sleepers. Simmons beauty rest rest on a comfort care. They sold me
a great mattress. You were in a half ago. I sleep like an infant like a child, even working for these
people. I still sleep good. That's a major miracle. So pick up the phone. Save a ton of money on your
cost. Save a lot of grief on your delivery because they deliver what it's convenient for you.
Seven days a week all the way up to 11 o'clock at night all over the state. Just pick up the phone
and make one easy call. You got a great new mattress. It'll be there before you know it. 1-800-MAT-T-R-E-S.

Leave off the last S. It stands for something. If you haven't heard Brooke Daniels lately, here's what you missed.
Right now in front of my face, I've got the ultimate man of heated ism 2 calendar. And the other
ones is stud muffins of science. By the way, you haven't lived until you've seen a calendar made up of
old men who in their real lives are scientists and one sort of another like these. You guys
don't know my nerds. So they just take their tops off and I'm supposed to get psyched on these.
Guys when I know they'd rather be playing around with the P2 dish than me anyway.
Brooke Daniels week nights on 610-W-I-O-D.
610-W-I-O-D is just real static-y.
I'm very proud of my new nose ring. I think I must be a sassion king.
Look in the mirror what do I see? And head from what somehow I don't look like me.
You see, I had surgery, but the plastic surgery. My skin, my nose, and my eyes.
What my way is, is even dialocidol.
I can't believe this time. I got the big whip.
I got the big whip.
I got the big whip.
I got the big whip.
I got the big whip.
Oh, look at that.
150-W-I-O-D. I wrote it down. What was that comment? Crackhead Nigger Horon.
Ron and Ron this morning. 9.50. Write that down in your diary, baby.
Here's a mobile implantation. Hello.
Hey Neil, how you doing, buddy?
Great. That guy is crazy.
B M G M is at least a mile from Bally's and the Aladdin's in between.
Oh, the Aladdin is definitely right next door to the M G M grand.
And it's like several and the flamingo is in between.
It's down. It's on the corner.
I don't know what the name of that screen is in there.
I don't know what the can is.
Huh?
Did they call Tropicana Bolivite?
No, no, that's where the M G M is.
Right. I'm talking about...
He's right on the corner there. It's like about 60 R D and they got an escalator now, dragging in.
Right.
Yeah. What he was talking about.
He doesn't know any of his George.
George has been in Vegas twice in his life.
He's been all of us three times in his life.
And he's an expert now.
I've been there three times in the last five minutes.
When's the last time you've been there?
Me or George?
No, you, no.
January. January 17th.
Didn't you all tell them that opened up yet?
Or...
Yeah, in fact, that was the day that New York, New York was opening that day.
And it was so jam packed in there.
I mean, it was an incredible place.
But we went in and lost a couple of hundred and ran right out.
I mean, it was just...
It was hysterical. It was just too jammed in there.
I'm going in June.
You'll love it.
All right, Neil, take care, buddy.
When it gets over...
I'm going in there about 20 times.
What's not to like?
All right, love it.
I've been there about 20 times.
I got to go back every year.
Okay, pal.
All right, Neil.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Yeah, that guy called me for a good guy,
but he's got his geography a little bit wrong.
And you're trying to like squeeze all those places together.
I'll tell you, you know, that Bob Stupac place,
whatever they call it now.
It's changed about for that's in receivership.
That's right next to the MGM Grand II, isn't it?
In fact, Fremont Street, downtown.
That's right next to the MGM Grand II, I think.
The Golden Nugget Downtown.
That's right next to the Grand.
And I think, uh,
Lockland, that's right in the La Laughland.
Whatever that town is.
That's right next to the MGM Grand II, I think.
So stay at the MGM because it's close to everything.
I'll ride.
It is a great place.
Boyd Wailer and the food in that joint.
The food.
I'm Tony.
I know it sounds crazy because I've eaten at hotels all over the world.
And most of the hotel food sucks because it's not a restaurant.
It's a hotel.
That's not their primary business.
It's a hotel.
But the food from room service at the MGM Grand
is just as good as any gourmet restaurant
at which you have ever eaten in your life.
And that's no exaggeration.
It's great.
Right?
Right.
In fact, once the restaurant, the Rosewood Grill.
Rosewood Grill is great.
A lot more expensive.
Although the food is not cheap.
It's pretty expensive.
But Boyd's good and delivery.
They got 5,000 rooms in that hotel.
20 minutes of your food is there.
We're even at 5.30 in the afternoon.
The middle of dinner hour.
And you're wondering, how the hell do they do this?
Oh, by the way, that guy just fell on the floor.
That you had up on the wall.
That guy with a heavy pecs just fell on the floor, George.
Here's Hyperluxo on a mobile.
Hello.
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
Great.
Hey, listen, how can you tell George Balley
does not on the strip?
How far off the sidewalk do you have to be?
Caesar's Balles is as far off the sidewalk
through its on a strip, right?
But Caesar's face is the strip.
Balley doesn't even face the strip.
It's across from the Babaric coast
with a beautiful hangout.
So how is that place?
They've never been in there.
Christ, now you know from the Italian dinner hour.
Yes, Father.
We're called the hole in the wall.
It's supposed to be really famous years ago.
Yeah, that's right.
I call that place, I call that place the Barbaric coast.
Yeah, but Balley's is on a strip.
They got people movers.
It bring you right in.
But it is not, okay, see, it's a technicality, okay?
Yes, it is.
But the point at the point he was trying to make
is this guy's trying to say it's right next to the MGM grand.
It is not.
It's way up the strip.
It's toward.
I'm going to walk by the Aladdin.
I close my eyes when I go by there.
Now you take them on a rail.
Do it some work.
Do not go any Aladdin, by the way, okay?
Oh, it's horrible.
Now listen.
Although they do have a good buffet,
you'll feel like you're right at cemetery village.
Hey, listen, let's go down a free monastery,
now for a minute.
You've seen that you've seen that
that $80 million light show down there.
Yeah.
That's our right point.
It still sucks.
Downtown still blows.
Downtown still blows, huh?
The four queens.
Yeah, there's four queens.
I think there's a few more than four queens.
The beautiful, love Vegas.
Now I'm going to make a cheap plug here.
Yeah, go ahead.
I'd still up.
Go ahead.
I jump into the cabin.
There's a Guido driving.
Yeah.
Where would you go for, you know,
a bowl of pasta, that's all off the beaten track.
He took me to a place called Chicago Joe's.
It's a house, old house, renovated, two brothers,
zone of maybe they serve 30 people at the most.
Yeah.
Beautiful.
Where is it?
It's a couple blocks off between,
I'm going to tell you,
it's between the star dust and the ionosphere.
If you know what that's like.
Oh, right next to the MGM grid.
Yeah.
I'm a good after there.
Okay, thanks.
By the way, oh, you know something.
Well, the guy's still listening.
They got it started all this with his Vegas,
Kakaray.
If you want to place where the slots are great,
go to the start.
This guy just,
I always went in the start.
Why do I ever go any place beside the start.
The start is great.
In fact, I got a machine there.
A haywire machine.
I'm not going to tell you which one it is.
You can't lose.
You cannot lose.
I love that machine.
That machine loves me.
That machine loves me.
I walk in there.
I get a couple of rolls of a dollars.
I go to that machine.
I stick them in there.
But I'll bring them up 200 bucks.
Like that.
Just like that.
Here's Coral Springs.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
What's happening, brother?
Great stuff.
Great stuff.
I'm having the best day of my life.
Almost.
Sounds like it.
Yeah.
What's not to like?
Nothing.
Beautiful day.
You're stuck in an office.
Yeah, but it's almost over, man.
Yeah, you got 10 minutes until you're out in the sun.
I got a nice new Corvette sitting out there waiting to work.
Okay, we have an open line.
Open line.
Dayed.
622, WIOD.
And one in brown.
He's similar to a bunch of bird crap,
but he's probably right.
But tomorrow, thank God,
his Wednesdays car wash day.
So don't worry about it.
You know, people like it all
talk about people who go out there and shoot pigeons.
Let me tell you one thing.
Okay, even cats, which I'm not too crazy about.
Cats don't dump on your car.
Dogs most certainly do not take a dump on your car.
Birds, however,
they dump on your car.
So anybody that's out there shooting birds
for fun and profit, be my guest.
Okay.
I mean, they're smart little critters,
but if they're not smart enough to evade that,
exactly too bad.
Here's Coral Springs.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Quintanently, I'm right next door to the MGM, too.
It sounds like it.
Yeah, I want to do, you're getting that gifilt to fish thing.
Yes.
I wanted to know if you've ever seen the fish
on the back of some cars that has little legs on it
and says Darwin inside it.
Yeah, I love that one.
That's great.
Oh, okay.
Isn't that great that intelligent people
are combating all this bull crap now?
It's like, hey, you either go, you can't ride,
you know, the Pope is riding both sides of the fence.
I mean, you know, pick one or the other.
I hear he's only riding one side,
but I don't want to say which side.
Well, that's all I call to say to see if you've seen the Darwin one.
I love it.
Okay.
See you.
Bye.
Okay.
Well, I'm going to give me a pull out right now.
I'm going to go home and drop it in the bay in the in the creek
and fish for something you're filtered fish for pay saw.
How do you like that?
I know how to do it right.
I'm getting me a pull and I'm going to either that or do fish.
I'm going to go over to that do fish creek
and fish for something you're filtered fish.
What other kind of fish would you expect to catch
in do fish creek besides you're filtered fish?
God damn it.
Or dang it.
Damn it.
So anyway, listen, I just moved in right next door to the MGM Grand.
