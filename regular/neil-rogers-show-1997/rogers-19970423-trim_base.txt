She bought a voodoo doll Karen came bought a voodoo doll for someone who's giving her a hard time as she was holding the doll thinking where she was
Gonna stick the pins a large rock fell out of the sky into her windshield later that day
She went to look at a house to rent a house still thinking about the voodoo down
She ran his own bushes and damaged her rental car
She wants to know if the voodoo had something to do with it. Yeah, okay, whatever you say Karen
Let's talk some voodoo. Okay, that's a topic number 62 by the way today
Let's do some voodoo
Here's Pemberpines in a mobile. Hello
Yes, sir
I'm a huge pianist and I don't want to point fingers, but that was the worst god damn coaching
I've ever seen in a third period playoff game on the road when you got a one goal lead. Yeah
Yeah, so back on your heels and expect a way you know that in the last 16 minutes of the third period we had one shot and
You know point to coach you want to come today?
Yes
That prevents you from winning having to learn that goddamn thing yet
Did you say god dang? I can't help it. I am really pissed. Yeah, really pissed off. Yeah
I just don't believe I mean
Everybody was getting backwards for 19 minutes trying to protect the one goal lead desperately and then
Flouting around in there and then of course any sitting on a bench being a spectator because we got a guy dressed who isn't ready for
Primetime and can't play in a game. That's a real sad commentary man
When you got a guy dressed who's supposed to be a big star and you know that he's such a liability
You're terrified to put him out there in a game. That's a real sad commentary on where we are
It's terrible. I mean like I said I just I just can't get over it being a man. If it's where going you're up by one
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna take the lead in the series and you're just skating backwards for 19 minutes right
I mean that's not coaching and I love the dog. I mean, I think he's he does a great job
Yeah, I think he's gotten carried away with himself man. I think he's too big for his bridges
Okay, I'm glad you enjoyed it
Dayd lines all open all of a sudden man
These people were forming it to mouth and all of a sudden date is wide open 622 W. I. O. D
We have an open line in the mobile one purple line pound I would eat the Panther fans are not happy campers today to say the least
They are pissed off. They be pissed off, man
They are not pleased okay
And I'm glad that I was able to come on here today and explain to you what it was all about last night
And it was not like what you thought
Am I getting way ahead of myself now? Yeah, I'm like already. I'm already in the anew an hour
Not that I'm getting ahead of myself, but I'm in the one o'clock hour. It's time to go already date County everybody else is smoking

To any 20 24 weeks ago we were separated

We were incorporated, emailing red tape out of control.
A powerhouse castrated, a ship without a rudder floating out to sea.
No one in control, creating anarchy, a redheaded that child in the Paxing Family.
Oh no, oh no, oh no.
Two any twenty-twenty-four weeks ago, we were incarcerated.
Punching a time cloth before we go home, suicide was contemplated.
They bought a famous station with national acclaim and shoot away the talent.
They ought to be ashamed and now they'll close the doors and you know who's to blame.
No, oh, oh don't know no but but but.

We have two open lines in
Broward, what's their story?
7679463, 767WID.
Here's Pemberer Pines.
Pines, hello.
Hey Neil, how you doing?
Great.
Good.
Ian.
How you doing?
I was doing great for most of the
morning.
I'm just calling, I haven't spoken
in a while.
Seeing how you doing.
A couple things, though, first.
I'm doing great.
You should have talked about
hockey and everyone's following you.
No matter what you say, though, Neil,
people kiss up to you and agree with you.
Oh, so in other words, you're back to the same
call we had last time.
No, but noticed in hockey, though, today,
our first caller was disagreeing with you
and then he called.
Because he didn't know what he was talking about.
Let me say a couple things about modern
Staka. I mean, nothing against him.
But it's his fourth team.
You're acting like he's, you know, the great
Gretski. No, he is not.
I never said that. He's not a great player.
He's a very good player, though, and he's not being
given an opportunity.
And you know something when you got people on the roster,
you evaluate the talent and you played the people who are the best players, which Chris Wells is not one of them.
He has no business playing in the playoffs and you know what is well as I do.
I think you're a little overcritical on him, though.
You okay? Well, that's your opinion.
And just one thing about the beater at the end on the last play.
Yeah. I'm actually on the third goal.
I mean, he's out there in the middle of all the action.
I'm sure in hindsight, maybe you should dig out the puck.
But when he's out there on the ice, I think it's easy to be sitting in there, you know, at home going,
oh, it was a bad play. I was a bad player.
So in other words, what you're saying, basically saying is that when you're watching the game,
you shouldn't have any opinion.
You shouldn't second guess what anybody does.
Is that what you're saying?
Not about a second guessing, but it's I think the battle of saying.
I'm going to say it again.
I thought it was a panic move.
He went flopping out there and it was one of those deals.
Either you're going to get it.
Either you're going to cover the puck or they're going to have a shot at the empty net that you just vacated.
And that's what turned out and they tied the game.
Whereas if he would have stayed home, there's a good chance that even if they got a shot,
he might have been in the net to stop it.
Yeah. Well, okay.
But basically what you're saying, which is idiotic and enane,
is that no matter what they do, don't criticize it because we're not out there playing.
So I got a better idea.
Why don't we just not talk about it?
Okay.
Okay.
I'll talk about it with somebody else.
We have an open line in Broward, 76794637.
Remember the last time he called several months ago at the same crap?
C-E-N guess what?
Somehow I'll survive.
Even when this bad book will bounce back, maybe on another station,
will bounce back and continue doing just fine.
But I can survive somehow without you and your inanity.
And no other people do not all agree.
There are plenty of people who disagree.
But it would be nice for once to have somebody, which is me,
giving an opinion, having watched this game for a zillion years now,
for 40 years, who's got some idea of what it's all about,
other than just an ask kisser, okay?
This town has got too many askissers.
It's right there also.
We've been in Dave Hyde's column.
Dave Hyde's got the column right there and says,
in fact, when I picked up my paper this morning,
I'm wondering, how come there's not all this hysterical stuff about how we got robbed?
And Dave Hyde says, a proper goal negating call and overtime against Scott Melonby.
Proper.
That's all he even says about it.
And it was proper.
It was the right call.
The announcer's on a game didn't tell you that.
Their coach isn't going to tell you that.
I'm here to tell you because it was because after I read the paper,
I then watched the replay over and over and over again
because I wanted to have some idea what I was talking about.
And it was the right call.
So if you want to eat and I'll say whatever the hell it is you want
and I'll sit here and you know, you can write out the script.
Not.
And this guy thinks that Chris Wells is better than Marty Strack.
Well, I respectfully disagree, okay?
I respectfully disagree very strenuously.
Here's Homestead. Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
I have to agree with you.
The coverage last night was like.
See, there you go.
I'm agreeing again.
Well, come on.
Just pretend you disagree.
Well, I'll pretend that I don't disagree with everyone.
Yeah.
And I couldn't wait to hear your show this morning because I knew everybody was going to be going.
Oh my god, we were robbed of that goal.
Right. That's why I went to the first call immediately.
I never said a word.
I didn't give any opinion.
And the first caller was, he didn't even know the name of the referee, Martin Elley.
And there's another one of these guys who means well, at least he's watching.
But he's still got a long way to go to understand the game.
It was blatant interference call.
I mean, Richard got spun completely around.
Exactly.
It's not even debatable.
There's nothing to talk about there.
And this crap about he won't even go upstairs.
There's nothing to review because they're not reviewing the goal.
He was calling a penalty, Dumbot.
Yeah. Well, no, I just wanted to let you know.
Love the Rangers and your show rules.
Okay.
Later.
See you.
We have an open line on the out of town line.
One triple eight, four, seven, four, nine, four, six, three, one, triple eight, four, seven, four.
So what the hell is with this Ron and Ron show, man, that they bought the network in DS took a walk.
And they come in here.
Their numbers are plummeting and plummeting.
And even during the time when the rest of us had good numbers there back, nothing.
Just down, down, down, down, down, down in one direction, man.
Drap it like a gigantic boulder in Colorado.
So what do you think that means, huh?
What do you think, George?
Oh, don't speak.
Here's Boka. Hello.
You forgot to mention what Dave Hyde said in his column today.
That Neil Rogers, the only franchise player in South Florida radio, will be more than QAM's ratings of the Dolphins Panthers.
Where is that?
That's on page 12c in today's Sunset.
Oh, I didn't see that.
Yeah, check that out.
Get out of here.
That's right there.
In where?
That's on set, no?
Neil Rogers.
See that?
Not on my paper.
No, I don't see that.
I don't see where you're reading.
Where you're looking on a page.
Where you having this hallucination?
Dave Hyde's column today.
Yeah.
It continues from one scene to 12 scenes.
Yes.
There's nothing about Neil Rogers in my newspaper.
It's right here in the second column.
He's talking about, um, uh, he's reminiscing in the column today.
And he's talking about, he gets about halfway down.
He starts talking about you and how great you're looking.
Where is this, sir?
Let me say it again.
Where is this?
You know, I dropped the paper off at the beginning.
No, tell me, tell me what the paragraph's I've got it right in front of my face.
All right, go to the second column.
I'm at the middle of the column.
Up and down.
Down high and low, it says, right?
In and out again.
Go ahead.
Start, bro.
Clash, insight to the sideline.
What?
Say what?
Cosa brought clash, insight to the sidelines.
Cosa.
Yes, this is Dave Hyde's column.
So there's a positive flavor than his joke.
Cosa.
What does Bernie Cosa are retiring?
Have to do with the Panther game last night.
That's the headline in the second part of the column on page 12c.
Well, you must have a different paper, man.
The headline says, no time to dwell on stunning laws game four is tonight.
All right, I'll, bro.
You know what? This is probably an earlier paper.
Well, bring it right over.
I will.
Okay.
Thanks.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
I think I'm losing my mind, man.
As a matter of fact, if he asks me, I think.
I'm dying over here.
We have two open lines on the out of timelines.
One, triple eight, four, seven, four, nine, four, six, three.
By the way, if Karen's listing, I got my dryer.
The people from Brandsmart were there right in early 7.45 this morning.
Took away the old ones set up the new one.
I'm all set to rock and roll.
Okay, Karen?
I thought you'd be very concerned because I knew that you were really worried about whether I got my dryer fixed.
You know what I'm saying?
Karen?
I had one in my mouth once.
Okay, let's go to Miami and a mobile.
Hello.
Hey, Neil, how's it going?
Great.
You know, you remember the good old days like old last year when coach McClein used to come under the show.
And you know, he still listens.
Yeah, well, he's not a town at the moment.
I don't think he's listening now in New York.
I know, but even when he's in town, you're right.
And you know something I'm going to tell you another reason why Rimmer doesn't do these hockey shows with me anymore?
He's afraid.
Because he doesn't want McClein coming on here and doesn't want Brian Murray coming on here.
And I really believe this because I'm not going to listen to the bullcrap.
And I'm just like the last two times that Doug did call it on the show.
We got a hold of him.
You know, what's the point of having the same argument again?
He's never going to admit the truth.
He's never going to agree.
He's going to continue hard-assing this Chris Welles thing.
He's going to continue putting down Barnes and Straca and Wolley and all these guys.
What's the point?
We don't want to hear it.
It's like a stuck record.
Right. And it's the same thing with McClein.
I mean, how can you defend, you know, Chris Welles as a player?
Come on.
He meets me for real.
And I kept here last night from both Denise and Rimmer about, oh man, he was phenomenal.
And they were double shifting him.
And he was out there for a while.
I'm against Messier.
Even though it was only an accident because it was a partial line change.
And I mean, just this guy, I think he is Jesus.
I think he ought to let the beard grow fully back again.
They put some sandals on him.
I think he could be Jesus.
It's pretty, but I mean, look, my boss doesn't love me at work.
You know, I'm not his favorite guy in the world.
But I do my work.
I do it right.
I do it on time.
It's not a problem.
And that's it.
I do the job.
I'm not, you know, you know.
But that's not the way that the world really works.
Okay.
For example, we got a broad here at night.
It doesn't belong on a year.
And she's the girlfriend of the consultant.
So she's got a show.
That's the way sports works.
And almost every coach plays his favorites.
You talk to anybody who's ever been in professional sports and they will tell you that the coaches
they played for had their favorites.
And then there were guys they didn't like who got very little playing time.
That's the way it works, unfortunately.
But if you can see it, it's actually hurting the team in a 10-year performance.
Well, that's what pisses me off.
Can't you step away from your personal feelings and say, look, I'm playing a guy that sucks.
No.
Can't do it.
No.
You know what, Neil?
I'm sorry, I'm going to change the subject.
When you leave the QAM, you're not supposed to say that.
On 560 QAM.
Yeah.
The best thing is we're not going to have listened to William Robert perfect the third.
He'll be gone.
He'll be stuck on this station.
And you'll be on a real stage.
He wants to go with us.
Oh, no, no, no, don't say that.
Oh, he's not gone.
I just see he wants to go with us.
Oh, good.
Have a great day, pal.
Thank you.
I'll see you.
Let's kick ass tonight.
See, and I said it was going to be 4 to 2.
We were head 3 to 2.
I'm envisioning we're going to get the empty net call at the end.
It's going to be 4 to 2.
I'm going to look like a genius tomorrow.
And then now we screwed it all up.
I had the script all written out there for these guys and they screwed it up right there at the end.
Didn't most of you think we were going to get the empty net call at the end.
And it was going to be 4 to 2.
And I was had the perfect score like I oftentimes have.
Or pretty close.
Didn't want we all thinking that except for Ian out there.
The expert.
Who thinks that you're nothing but a bunch of ass kissers?
We have an open line at day 622 WIOD, two on the other townlines, Palm Beach, the other unit, and the rest of the universe at 1.884749463.
You know, some deals are too good to be true.
That's why when these guys, these scam artists come along and they tell you about, you know, cleaning your carpets and giving you this so much per room and etc and so on.
And that's all it's going to be.
Then they get done.
They start giving you all these add-ons.
That's right.
They start adding on all kinds of charges after they've started doing the work.
It's called a ripoff. It's called a scam.
That's just one of the zillions of reasons why you need to call dry concepts.
Because first, you're guaranteed a super job every time.
And secondly, as far as price is concerned, they give you a written guaranteed price up front before they start touching anything even you.
So you know exactly what it's going to cost.
No add-ons.
No scams.
No rip-offs.
No bad surprises at the end.
Just a super job every time.
Your carpets are dry in two or three hours.
They give you a nice little rose when they leave your house.
And you walk around the house saying this is a freaking miracle.
It looks too good to be true, but it is.
It looks like you had brand new carpeting installed wall to wall.
So if that's the kind of deal you're looking for next time your carpets need cleaning.
Just pick up the phone and call the experts and dry concepts you're in for a real pleasant surprise.
And date call 930-3636.

Well, there's nothing worse, seriously, than making me feel cheap.
Well, there's nothing worse, seriously, than making me feel cheap.
Because I'm not cheap.
I happen to be like a big tipper.
I leave 20 to 30% in a restaurant all the time.

All the time, unless it's crappy service.
All the time, unless it's crappy service.
In which case, I don't go back.
But I feel like like some kind of a quizzling here.
Of course, it's your fault, George.
You're supposed to find these things out.
You're supposed to find these things out.

I started doing a family bank and I got sidetracked there
because I got no money left.
Anyway, if you got a lot of money or a little bit of money,
they'll take good care of you.
They'll treat you like a valued cousin.
Banking in America today is in a crisis situation
because you got a handful of big banks,
the small banks most of them have been gobbled up.
They're gone.
So if you got a complaint too bad, they don't give a crap
because they're all big.
They're bigger than life itself.
They treat you like a number in a computer because,
generally speaking, that's all you are.
Even if you got a lot of money, they don't give a flying crap.
Believe me, I had an experience.
I had many experiences, which you all heard about.
They sucked.
So fire your bank that sucks and go to a great bank.
Family bank.
Seven convenient locations in Broward.
They got your ATM that honors press the one citizen honor.
They got a drive-through that opens early eight o'clock
in the morning every day.
They're even open Saturday morning.
And they got friendly, great people to get to know you
and treat you like a manch.
So fire your nasty and personal bank and head immediately
to Family Bank.

point oh so they had a slight drop there okay and that's all I'm going to do
for because it's killing me okay so what do you think well I think that they
better build those new studios over a power before you get there because if you
see what I'm working with a kiss you're gonna freak I'm not working with that
crap I'll tell you that so by the way how do you like that Ron and Ron show you
had an experience to be a part of that yeah I was hoping they call me back yeah
well if you saw the numbers you won't want to be a part of that they listen by
the look bad on your resume don't put it on your resume that you were for in
there yes I have a suggestion okay you're making a million dollars a year
that's what you say yeah well whatever and you're living high in the hog yeah well
once you do an idea of how to help you for four years and what's that said all my
money to solve foos no put a landline in and do the show from your house sounds
good to me yeah you get up you got the phone bank there you do the show from
your house yeah it sounded real good with that little dog barking up the storm
all day that would be good to be a part of the show yeah knock off a hundred
thousand a year and have put a landline up okay okay thanks honey bye see
not we have two open lines and Broward 767 so sunny's happy because the numbers
at magic are dropping real real bad they're taking a real dive a swan dive a
nose dive but not like here not like here we lost almost 50% of the audience in
some day parts like this one in certain demographics almost 50% have
vanished they have Van Moose they've had it two open lines in Broward County 767
WYOD 767 Puckhead here's Cooper City hello yeah how you doing great I got to
believe you if you say that Melon B. Spun Rector around but I didn't see it and
I'm wondering what the feed was you know was it off your satellite it was the
same telecast you saw okay so but you have to you have to back up the tape you
only saw it once as it happened and it happened so fast that unless you have it
on tape you never would have seen it I watched it about four or five times
because I did tape it yeah and I'm gonna go back and watch it again because I didn't
well then how could you have missed it that's what I'm wondering because what I did you watch it
will you listen to me did you watch it from the face off yes no you didn't yes I did couldn't
have when you went to the boards Melon B I didn't I couldn't see Richter because of the camera yes
you do then you didn't watch you didn't back it up for enough I will let me ask you
right to the face off they show the full the full shot there you see Richter you see Melon
be coming in from the side and all of a sudden he and Leach come barreling in director they
spin him right around and then the puck it's tipped it in there and Merrioli standing there looking
at it he didn't get his arm up in here in time but he's definitely calling it penalty well he
didn't get his arm up he didn't blow the whistle it sounded to me like you said there was five seconds
or so and I'm wondering how come you don't hear a whistle you don't see the arm go up in the
place dead yeah and then there is no controversy well again if he got his arm up in here that would
have eliminated the problem but you're still nobody is going to allow the goal when the when the
the goalie is being pushed out of that nobody is going to let the winning goal go in especially
in a playoff game on a goalie interference it just it can't happen cannot happen well it was the
first penalty and in what did from the second period on yeah so what about the one on robot
tie later in the overtime they even up call what about that yeah well what is that I mean you know
how do I want that I don't think you do either but I'm just telling you was I mean I can sit here and
argue with you all day go back and look at it again you will see it he spun him right around and when
the puck goes in Richter is way off on the far side of the net he's way off balance he's not
in position because he's been run into it's not acceptable it can't it can't happen I'm gonna
I'm gonna watch it again Neil and let me say it again Dave Hyden his column says a proper goal
negating call against over Scott my little baby he's right this one is he right okay have a great
thing okay like I said we got Rob we love you Panthers we got screwed oh my god there we go come on
everybody now we don't come in no penalties we was Rob we love you too Chris well you got a big
one Chris so we hear you you would have coach are doing it in the shower
I get out oh melon but yeah nice place got we have an open line in Broward 7679 463 that's
slew foot 767 wiod here's the real expert for you here's a man it can really screwed up I want
to throw out some real hot topics but first I switch the coach would take off his necklates I
like I'd like to give him a neck lace and a neck brace next time I have to see Chris Wells and
Jovanoski in there man next kid let me tell you what I'm going to impediment to our lives
I want in fact I want the mayor I want Alex penis to declare today anti-iddi Joe day in the
dead county let me tell you to scare the crap out of you the other night when Wells was warming up
yes and he and Jeff him and Jeff Smith were both in practice and I started counting frantically and
I realized they were just letting them warm up for a future date which I didn't realize would be
so soon Jovo and someone else were questionable and they wanted them out on the ice to see whether
or not they could play and obviously they were wrong about Jovo Jovo is always questionable
mentally anyway two of the hardest shots I have ever seen taken the one-were shepherd
hit ricketer in the head right oh my god and then do you notice that rumor about like 30 seconds
later says I think that might hit him in the helmet no kid and Jeff very very good I think
rumor I think somebody spiked his punch last night yeah I don't mean you carry it away but Chris
Morris downing better all the time anyway talk about losing your credibility soon and by the way I
had to jump out in the car for a while and Chris Moore is giving more detail now is he yes so he's
taking some advice uh-huh the other shop would give any less the winning goal less yeah the winning
goal that hit the camera yeah that was a rocket yeah I mean and it was just shut there's just no
way he could have stopped that is correct they came in so fast we're not blaming the geyser on that
he had a good game okay so they did a little blame I am blaming the geyser for Ovelli flop
in there at the end of regulation and panicking but I'm not blaming him for the winning goal but
our defense in addition to which our defense was in a panic which it let me say it again what
what it's obvious we keep blowing a lead in the last minute the guy called before with that staggering
statistic about ten times all year long now you can't keep doing that how about that caps game in
Washington 48 seconds left they leave Peter Bond were untouched but I'm being it's in the net
anyway and over and over again this team's got too many blow jobs man
that's right I'm telling you they're blowing it too much late what the hell happened in your
section the other night I saw the cops come over and it's got some guys some asshole Ranger fan they
took the Ranger fan out who knows okay and closing the two hot topics yes socks and toilet paper
have a good we have an open line in Broward 7679 463 767 WLD and we have one on all I guess what you
know something on that this number 13 George is going to be real upset about this
guess what was on that this number 13 speaking of Paul Harvey Jr
but of course we can always get him to do that again and we will 1228 at W I O D
610 W I O D

God I feel like Samson in reverse I feel like now that I had that 40 pounds of hair cut off I got
all my energy back man I was like really schmootsy but I'm also very embarrassed what is her name
by the way I'm embarrassed about that Beth Becky oh Becky it's close is she in there oh hi
Becky there you are but I'm so she's even doing a Jay Leno I can't believe that but Becky
you know hit me up for like an extra 100 bucks I can't believe that only a joke ma
now how much did you pay Becky for your haircuts George do I really have to say on the air
because I'm really cheap yes I gave her a tip though yeah I gave her 25
so the shop gets 20 and she gets five five bucks well she's on the clock I'm sure
okay here's Miami hello hello Neil yes sir hi how are you great
a long time listener here uh disappointed uh uh like last night uh what gets me out of mind losing
but there's not one there's now one person in this crowd who talks about the fact that for the
umpteenth time we blew the lead again with 18 seconds to go nobody wants to talk about that okay
you're right you're right uh we blew it many times four one shot in the last 16 minutes of the
third period one shot on the net and the funny thing is you see it coming you see you see I'm going
into the law you know you see him going to that shell and you know something that almost never ever
works it never ever ever works right and I have a question for Doug McLean it isn't the object of the
game to try and win it no to try and put the best players you got on the on the ice no no the
object is to prove how smart he is now dumb all the rest of us are that he and Brian Marie are
geniuses and they're gonna pedal us Chris Wells if we have to lose every game the rest of the next
two years they're gonna pedal to watch just how great he is whether we want to believe it or not
it's it's because it's become like an obsession they're obsessed with this kid
it's I thought we left behind the the era of playing favorites when Roger Nielsen left that's
what you think yeah and and and to lose of all people I know I know that if we play the uh the
the flyers or the devils uh you know we're playing against the higher caliber team but to the
Rangers that will be the ultimate right that's right to lose to those New Yorkers will be and they're
just not that good they're just and you know something what happens if they're not uh feeling
their age as much as we think they are what happens if they get rejuvenated from pulling that
game out and overtime last night and they come back and kick our ass tonight what do we do then
exactly exactly I mean it's like you said it you we had it we had it and then give it away like that
you know you don't get it that position many times we played one period again last night we played
the second period and that was it and I'm gonna say it again you got to do it during the season but
especially during the playoffs the game last 60 minutes you got to go out there and have a 60-minute
effort and we didn't do it you know I'm waiting see Robbie Neethermire did it he was flying he was
great and a couple other guys but other than that we didn't do it I'll hope and maybe the coach
you'll call you again like last year yeah hold your breath hold your breath remember when you
told the food truck and against the peg this coach is too smart for me now he's too smart for all of
us he's an expert well he should he should look back at you I last year's tapes and he should
realize it okay thank you good luck to us pal see ya two open lines and date six two two nine four
six three six two two they are violently pissed off we got Rob Dan Merrill Welley is the anti-Christ
we got screwed etc and so on don't believe what that fat bag on a radio says he don't
know nothing about this game don't believe him and by the way you notice how fast that guy came
by with a sun sentler was dropping it off here not with his version of the sun sentler word Dave
Joseph allegedly wrote all this stuff that we still haven't seen which I don't believe here's a
lady in West Palm Beach hello hello gone lady in West Palm Beach is gone what a shame two open
lines on the out of town line sorry lady sorry we couldn't hang on long enough for you or was it
the other way around one triple eight four seven four nine four six three one eight eight eight four
seven four WYOD in Palm Beach in Peoria in Batavia in Geneva in Utica here's Coral Gables on a
mobile hello me oh yes sir how are you okay listen long time listener sorry I'm a ranger fan
you guys were alive last night I don't think that they should have disallowed that goal in the wrong
over time wrong well I don't seem out of opinion it didn't look like a much happen there but you
didn't see it you didn't see it maybe I didn't there it did happen rather quick but it didn't
look like it should have been disallowed okay and I'm very happy that the roe the panther is one
of the first game because I've got tickets for Friday nights game and had night had they lost
the first game I might not be able to go see the game okay it's going to be a sweet meal I'll see
you there last panther game they won how do you how do you sweep in five games well you're right I'm
sorry okay okay whatever you say pal have a great luck get on here gonna be a sweep how do you do
that we want to first get well okay so here's the paper the guy was right didn't I just get you
saying I believe that guy sounded very sincere to me sounded Jewish how he wouldn't lie well
so anyway I'll see it's a different it's a it's a it's a whole different version see it's a
different version of the paper from the one I get how do you like that it's a it's a what is this
it's not even a same article it's a different thing it's a whole different thing Khozar brought
class and insight on a sideline oh it's it's not even it is this today's paper when's the April 23rd
I don't get it different edition for different locale but it but it's not the same article it's about
it's Zellers apology is laimer than his joke how do you like that so I guess he's picking up the
the baton for Michael Mayo there in Ripon though and by the way fuzzy Zellers not Jewish we had
several reports confirming I don't even think he circumspect how do you like that so it's a totally
different article the one in my papers all about the hockey game and then inside it says Khozar
brought class and insight to the sideline and Buffalo Goli Dominic Haschic shows how fortunate the
Panthers were in writing John van Beesbrook last season we were writing him oh my god don't get
so about it bezer it's a shame that Muriel Mewens is right this way everybody is riding that
according to Dave Hyde rhymes with ride and he's got a bunch of crap in here okay I guess this
article this column must have been written before our game was over you know I'm saying like for
the real super early edition that they put this in there because our game wasn't over yet so
almost nobody saw this he misses albums he misses Bernie Khozar's class insight and intelligence
missed more than his throwing it says Neil Rogers the only franchise player in South Florida radio
will mean more to WQAMS ratings than the dolphins Panthers or Marlins like I said you know that Dave
Hyde a genius always loved Dave Hyde a legend before his own time here's Weston hello
well Weston hello Neil yes sir hey Neil first ball what is your opinion some Chris Moore I have
I don't know enough about what you think about him but he blows he blows is the worst I ever heard
in my life okay I heard the first about eight or ten minutes of his speech at about 12 o'clock
and he goes exactly against what you're saying and he even brings out the rulebook stating that
deliberate conflict with the Goli if it's if it's not deliberate then it should have been that
goal should definitely have been allowed and he even ran the radio to about a full ten or 15 minutes
so let me say it again you can't make contact like that and spend the Goli around and have a
pucco and have a goal go in as a result of it it is not allowed I don't care what he's reading I
agree with you what he's smoking it is not allowed period and he's stating on the and he's seen
the replay probably from his truck as well that it leach brought him into the goal and at he's full
of crap he's absolutely full of crap I watched it 20 times
is anyway do you guys could get each other on the phone here I'm not good why would I argue with him
why would I argue with him who's nothing more than a paid show for the team all these broadcasters
on those games there are nothing more than paid shows for the team it would just be interesting
to hear the two you guys debate it out I don't want to I have nothing to debate with him about he's
a lightweight I'm not going to debate with him even you are even there they were saying that even
from the U.R. columnists are writers of their agreeing that the call was bad okay whatever you say
I disagree vehemently okay okay okay Chris Morris says it was a goal okay that convinces me
I mean all these people talking about well there was nobody in the crease and why don't they go
upstairs the people who were broadcasting that game didn't have any idea why the goal was
disallowed what the hell was going on but hey they're right not wrong because I know nothing about it
we have an open line in Broward 767 just like all season long when I'm talking about trading
Jovanowski and certain people I don't want to mention no names there's a oh they're not going to
trade him he's like the franchise okay whatever you guys say you're the experts all you people
have sit in the stand chanting Eddie Eddie you're the experts man that's why he's sent on a bench for
half the game left for more than half the game last night that's why it's about the third time
that he's been benched during a game because he's a liability out there okay but everybody else is
the expert in this town and God forbid you should have a the setting opinion like you will try to
watch it a little bit objectively like here's reality going on in front of us oh no you're wrong
we were screwed okay fine we got robbed come on let's go we love your panthers we really got
screwed come on let's go every time one of our guys gets checked it's a penalty every time we
hit somebody else every time we put a stick in their post and let me say it again I haven't heard
from one person here today yet tell me anything about Chris Wells getting a stick up and mark Messier's
in opening up a cut bigger than the god damn Mississippi River there right on his chin with gallons
of blood spilling all over his body which I enjoyed by the way because I hate the Rangers and mark
Messier but nobody's talking about that that nobody saw that should have been at least a four and
maybe a five minute major penalty during which God only knows how many goals they might have scored
nobody is talking about that because they haven't got a freaking clue that's why
Chris Moore my ass the more I hear him the less I can stand it we was robbed no make no mistake
about it okay this was all just a joke today we were robbed and we're going to appeal it to Gary
Batman and God and Jesus and Moses and Abraham and maybe even Joseph Smith how do you like that and
fuzzy zeller and that freaking fuzzy zeller too that you bet oh he's not that's going whatever he is
oh man I got a headache now I have a headache that you wouldn't believe
1244 w i o d
610 w i o d
visual party station of the American Family Federation
fuck it in and hold it and now a royal flush
princess die are you in there yes could you bring princess some more tissue
yeah okay bitch
1249 and w i o d we were robbed we got screwed it was one of the worst calls I've ever seen in my life
I think we ought to have a congressional investigation we better call up Don
Sherry everybody at the cbc we better call up Jean Critsch and the Prime Minister of Canada
they know something about this let's get Gary Batman down here and write his ass out of town on a
rail come on what do you say Dan Merrill Welley huh sounds a tad into me I wouldn't be surprised
if he's got pizzeran in satilia wouldn't surprise me
pizzerani here's the sunrise hello sunrise yes sir
it ill yes all right she's your question you're in the game last night what game is that the
hockey game oh yeah Denise and rim job what were they moaning about about all the hometown
scoring with the shots on goal the hometown first of all I'll see all five officials from
different city for the playoffs yes and what what in in an addition to which let me
let me you still here I'm there let me just tell you one other thing nobody cares about that
because it is what is the point who cares exactly and it was also I know I know exactly when
you were talking about they were talking about the fact grisky shot one three feet wide and they
showed as a shot it was during a very crucial part of the game and again it's one of those examples
of people start meandering and wandering around talking about a stuff that has nothing to do with
anything which doesn't build up the suspense and excitement of the game but I mean far be it for
me to start critiquing other people in a way that they present something but I'm not interested
in hearing about the most exciting overtime game Denise potfam was ever in I'm not interested
in hearing about anything to these potfam was ever in whether it's a game a bar whatever the hell
what an address I don't care what he was ever in because guess what he doesn't play for the panthers
we have an open line in Broward 7679 463 here's Boka hello
okay there's a ranger fan with a sock in his purse all right great ranger fan
excellent put you back on a subway with Bernie gets and by the way pal here's another one for you
here's Kendall hello you know I couldn't agree with you more on all your insight
into the game last night yes first of all oh now you're going to get Ian all up sick because you
agreeing with me well you know if I didn't agree with you I really would say it and at first you
know of course I was upset when that happened but looking at it as I did as you've suggested to these
fair weather fans down here that really know nothing is true I mean the goal but the bottom line was
is if you were to play the way you're supposed in the third period not this would have happened
you can't keep blowing the lead with a handful of seconds left and then start belly it can
be because of some call later on in the game you cannot keep blowing the lead this team has done
this over and over and over again that's why we had 75 million ties this past season because the
team cannot play with the lead and the thing is as the check it as I was after the first period
thinking that these guys gonna be they'll come out and kick some ass and they did they did and then
they played one great period the second period seconds ago I was like what I mean we're
I you know an ending I couldn't let me just I want to tell you something when the beasor made that
belly flop to try to you know it was coming at that point I let out a scream like what are you
doing and being before I could finish the sentence the puck was in the net you know what I'm
saying you could just smell it coming and as far as the commentators less mentioned the better but
I agree with you who cares about 1979 how there was 80 shots on goal I can I can understand if
you're doing a regular season game okay we're ahead five to one or we're losing five to one we're
getting our ass kicked then you feel some time okay but during a playoff game you try to build up
the excitement you know I'm switching back before the between the CBC I'm watching Edmonton
Dallas last night which again was the hell of a game Dallas winning 4-3 and it looked like Edmonton
was going to score it again with a minute left and damn you're tight it up again but you listen
to the difference in just the sound the crowd noise and the excitement of the announcers and the
way the game is being presented and the drama you listen to that and then you turn on our telecast
and you listen to people talking about somebody played 40 years ago and yeah crap I mean you've
got to be able to present this as what it is you play all season long to get to this nine weeks
these are the Stanley Cup Freaky Playoffs baby present it like it's something special about 20
years ago yeah presenting like it's something special not like it's a piece of chop liver and what
the rumor was saying with the shots on the break exactly but it's like I mean where do what is I
mean who cares if I don't get 50 shots I'll go only had 10 the bottle on it's a show since they
started sticking all these jocks on there doing these games everybody all these jocks think that all
the rest of us want to hear about when they played and all these self-deprecating jokes from a
Jim Palmer and this one and and Don Sutton I don't give a crap about any of that I want to hear a
real professional announcer call a game make it exciting and the color guide to add something when
there's a break in the action like hearing yield is on a CBC and interjects something that might be
a little bit humorous or a little bit informative and give you some insight as to what's going on
and then you know do do a little voice over on the replays and that's it that's what I want to hear
unfortunately I can't I don't give the CBC I'm a schlepper I don't have a satellite dish but
you know the thing is I smelted coming as soon as Rick went to the bench you just knew I mean because
the Rangers have pulled off these last minute aerobics yep and you know as much as I hate the
Rangers we didn't we we just I mean we were back into a show that third pack I couldn't believe
when you shot in the last 16 minutes okay you know so all these people that are playing in the
a dogma plane you know play this Roger Neil said let's go into a show let's go into a coma
let's sit on a one goalie then guess what like I said it almost never ever works so all I could say
is these guys better come up pump tonight because let me tell you something we go down three to one
it could be ugly and at least a lunch lost yeah but the Chicago is giving them a run for their money
so you know at least there's some you know consideration or kneel not important that we win but that
they lose exactly and you know what I know rimers your buddy but you got to smack him around a little bit
we're gonna beat the snot on him when he comes back all right okay later we have an open line
in date six two two don't look at me I don't know what it was and I don't want to know six two two
two W.I.O.D. and Dade we have two open lines and Broward seven six seven nine four six three so the
consensus is about everybody connected with that telecast last night that's the general consensus

audience not what these numbers show here it's deadly baby it is deadly and where did they go they

610-W-I-O-D Miami Fort Lauderdale
it's straight from the Vatican introducing new Catholic life the religion with one third the guilt
of your regular faith new Catholic life satisfies your need for Christianity but it doesn't fill you
up with a lot of doctrine
more of a feeling more of a feeling
Catholic life there's no confessions no sermons and no lingering afterlife it's the perfect alternative
for modern agnastics who don't want to take any chances our services are held three times a year
and they're only 15 minutes long plus there's no added guilt for sneaking out during communion
we've dropped that too look for our church mobile in your neighborhood hey you might be in the
for you little faith try Catholic life because a little faith is all you need
104-W-I-O-D guess what's on sports channel right now

last 20 seconds yet but those of you who are like arguing and debating it all worked up to a
frenzy just sit your ass down here it's on the small dish now in 319 permanently sports channel Florida
and it's on your cable system so there it is and when you get to about two and a half minutes of
the overtime if you watch real close right after that face off to the left of Richter you'll see
what happened okay and if not you'll never see it again because they don't show it again because
they didn't have the foggy as clue what happened open line and date sick but Chris Morris says okay
whatever he says is okay with me 622-W-I-O-D and date open line and Broward 767 here's Gainesville hello
hey how you doing great why would you want to watch that game again I don't
god anyway it's you mean you're right it's they played last night he reminded me of like the first
two years of the Panthers yeah I mean Roger Wilson it was just like I mean if this is a regular
season game it'd be like boring you know yeah second period second period was great the rest of
the game was coma inducing in our part it's it was I was really I mean and even though it was an
overtime game let me say it again the Rangers had 45 shots it's a second game in a row they've had
they peppered us with over 40 shots did you um did you watch the the Phoenix and I'm game last
night I saw a little bit of the early part of that game I want one that game I had a question
um who wanted why I don't know I only watched the first period but why was everyone wearing
every one every single because in in that was the tradition in Winnipeg the winnipeg just before
they moved to Phoenix so they said if we make it in the playoffs we want to keep that tradition
alive down here so they ask all the fans to show up in white it was it was a tradition in Winnipeg
yeah yeah it looked really weird it was great though I know just every single person was when
I'm glad you mentioned that because I sure like to find out who won that game I didn't I don't
know I didn't do it too late I know Dallas beat the oil is four to three and what another
would tremendous game but I don't know about the other one yeah but and the other thing I want to
talk about and I'm sure you probably talk about this already but the game on Sunday I was at that
game uh actually I said hi to you there right but um I in the six the section I was in there's
this guy I think he's the guy that starts that refuge suck chant not the rad guy what section was
that well I I sit up in uh two fourteen oh and there's a guy sits like two rows behind me yeah he
starts this refuge suck chant right and like everyone starts to chant that same thing and this
was right after that I don't remember that Garpent love fell the Garpent love penalty yeah he
liked through a punch right right and he got called for roughing I mean that's a legitimate car
yeah well but does make a difference with that with that group of assholes up there anytime we get
a penalty hey ref you suck including the time when they called a double minor which game was that
this was not too long ago they called a double minor against the other team right we got the power
play and because these people were such assholes that was the most embarrassing moment of the four
years we've had the franchise when people are screaming hey ref you suck because they don't
realize that we got the extra we got the power play I mean I was at that day one Sunday I mean and I
was and this is on Fox National TV seen all around the world right and they're saying how stupid I
know I was I was really like I mean well when is the day gonna come I mean it's four years already I
realized it and not only that but how about all the people who are here from the northeast in the
midwest they shouldn't be like something from outer space to them how come we don't have more people
here know something about what's going on yeah exactly I mean it's not just it's not just
hockey either I mean I go to a lot of marlin's games yeah oh if you listen to the conversations that
are going on it's about everything except baseball when they do try to talk about baseball they have
no understanding of the rules a simple game like baseball they don't understand that I have to
people there this is what happens they just go there it late by the way yeah and leave early and
and uh... the walk up and on the island block my view
yeah and then
the talk
you'll just talk the whole game leaving the book to seven tenning
and that's it
and i don't even know why they went
i'm there to wash again exactly that that's the question why did they go and i
keep asking that about some of the people in my section
who usually pay very little tension of what's going on in the eyes
why are they there what are they doing there if they want to have a social
club let him go to the bar somewhere let him go to one of their guys house and
have a a drunken party okay
but why the hell are they there just to disrupt everybody else's enjoyment of
the game
yeah and another one of the other
this is i'm just trying to like i'm just meant to hear i mean
the other thing to do at these marlin's and patters games that he should
throw anything yeah
and at the marlin's games they do it between innings right yeah and like they're
still doing it as the game already started
and like the game is already is coming back to the starting pictures already
and they're still like talking to you should say welcome to my amma
everyone standing welcome to my amma
uh... it's like killing each other for way to lay stock you know passes to the early
bird
uh... he's i think it was it's it's
it's annoying i mean i like watching baseball it's my favorite sport yeah
i just these fans
sometimes i just have a great life now
see a man hang in there open line in the out of town line one triple eight four
seven four nine
and thanks for calling six ten w i d we don't say that on the show we should be
say that a lot more you know
because that always impresses me when i hear certain people always saying and
thanks for calling w i o d
it just uh... it doesn't for me
that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that
that that if you can play a game last night or what he was spectacular was
sensational here we all
mellow be just fell down with must have been a penalty by list three the way
didn't touch the must have been a penalty we got screwed again hit that robot
a hit that pussy come on hit him
what is this
it says uh... change-top it no more pants this day at the rest okay change
the topic go change your uh... toilet paper will you
go bend over i think you got an important fact coming in pal
here's candle hello
new yes sir i got the score of the uh... coyote ducks came yes sir
uh... phoenix one one nothing dammit
and uh... corkham scored on a backhand or late uh... in the third period but
another uh... goal taken away in the crease by the ducks i think
uh... ruchin scored right
and the guy i think like a little bit of his toe was in the crease
and they took it away i mean the
just like don cherry says the worst rule in the history of sports i think there
was another maybe two or three game maybe
decide that one another goal was definitely taken away last night i don't know
which game it was i was uh...
i was actually disappointed because i think uh... not yesterday maybe the day
before you said that
possibly the rangers panther was gonna be on the cbc
uh... i forgot i forgot that i forgot that they had my trail new jersey last night
plus the orler uh... Dallas can
yeah because you know i can't stand room or and and i mean i'm going to
that performance last night was the all-time
confused and bizarre and like uh... off the wall
yeah i really care about how many shots there were in that game eighty three
seventy nine and that uh...
i don't know the fun pain game when they beat washing the right twenty five years
ago right when we're concerned about i think i was a maybe in grade school back
that i don't care about that i want to know what's going on the game you know
i it's just it's ridiculous
they are the j-rand of a gary carder of hockey okay
alright i'll tell rimmer
i'll tell alligator arms
i'll see you
we have an open line and date six two two nine four six three here's for
water deal hello
nil yes sir
how you doing great
uh... first of all couple things i couldn't agree with you more about my
victor's about showing my character when all the action is going on down the
other end can you believe that
it was amazing i mean the game is going on okay all you have to do is say
victor is still in that we don't have to see it or you can do i know it's very
revolutionary but like they do on all the other games how about a split screen
where we see for just a couple of seconds here's rickard still rickard still
in the net down there but in the meantime you don't miss any the action i'm
telling you the technical ability of the sports channel crew in presenting
these games you can't complain about it because they don't have any
exact nonexistent
and my favorite thing about last night is when rim jobs said
and it's not bad enough that they didn't allow the goal but he got a penalty on
top of it yeah
which was amazing clueless
i mean i had no idea that they had called a penalty or what it was about and
like i said nobody in the truck is like
finding anything out or rewinding the tape just another five seconds back to
the face up so we have some insight as to what's going on
and most people are not taping the game by the way so most people i mean it
i'm telling you i watched it over and over again this morning unless you
you know i didn't have it on tape unless you watch the court you're never
gonna see what happened
they didn't show it again
yeah i mean they showed it from a certain point just like that goal just like
ticken and goletian there oh yeah well and we're waiting an
interminable amount of time and i'm screaming show us something you must have
some kind of a replay and all they show us is the thing from inside the net
you see a lot of blur you see nothing exactly unbelievable
i agree and the other thing is the the rangers tank during the second period
too because they made the they i'm a rangers fan but i also like the panthers
yeah but they made the they made the panthers look like they had a 40%
power play because they just stood back and let them get in perfect
formation and yeah like i said the rangers haven't showed me much in this
so i don't think you the team's going too far right right you watch these
other games do you see some real intense playoff hockey and you watch this
muddling around it's going on here and you wonder what else going on here
yeah i agree and in closing i'll say that the ambies pro cast have been horrible
but last year he was unconscious and people should probably appreciate that
more now okay that talk you later see you bye bye
we have an open line in date 6229 463 kls sex here's a fact from
ericin or land to one of our radio groupies
who says kls sex used to be a legendary classic rock station in
Los Angeles they recently changed to the hot talk format
excerpt from radio column march 7 1997 by Richard Wagner
commonly Los Angeles newspapers kls sex is format is in trouble he says
and it would even greater extent kls sex is underperforming
kls sex has been a laughing stock ever since adapting Walter Seibos talk for
morons format perhaps it is time to dump it and try something else
something like let me think a successful talk format or better yet
put classic rock back on kls sex kls sex now by the way is also known as
real radio 97.1 sound familiar you folks up there in Orlando like
eric well also says qa m comes in great up here in Orlando by the
thank you eric
like that
Walter Seibos is trying radio stations from coast to coast
unbelievable this man i'm telling you he could screw up the pope
he could screw up an orgasm this guy it's on it's a
man oh man it's frightening when you come right down to it
isn't it i had one in my mouth once
115 at wio d
610 wio d when lightning is coming
here it is first the work thought radio i've heard my life on wio v
after miserable attempts at comedy and being a nice guy short-sittingers back
as the regurgitator freeze maggots yeah what you gonna do about it your big cute
exactly with society and up people who else are you gonna turn to
oh help he's getting away i can't help you oh yeah try this ice cream and sour
purging the forces of evil shorts and here it is regurgitator
i like it i'll bet okay one eighteen at wio d we have an open line on the out of
town line one triple eight four seven four nine four six three three and a half
minutes left in the regulation by the way if you're not watching sports
three thirty like i said remember three and a half minutes i'm counting right now
so very soon i'll be showing i'll be showing you over time and then we'll watch it
it'll happen while the show is still on the year and you'll see it and you know
something if you really uh have been brainwashed already you'll still say we got robbed okay
in fact before that comes up i have a feeling though that we're gonna see that out of the
goal scored that tied it up are we gonna see that with just a few seconds left again we might
just see that here's hollywood hello is he crying yet not yet god listen i
i wanted to bring up the mess a thing nil i'm not gash you took yeah okay he he
that wasn't just a gash that was like uh he was chin got yeah he was quite serious he
gaped it but the the other thing he went right to the bench yeah and you know that they plugged it
up no problem did you see the end of the first period and i i forget his name blinky got hit
the guy with the bad eyes and he stand in there with a stick broken half and he blinky yeah the guy
with the eye problem on the panthers with the beard lorry yeah yeah he's standing there mownin
and wine and he broke my sticky broke my stick broke his one oh stick right in half yeah and he's
and he's waiting on a call and i think that if if guys like him and and McLean would stop you know
yelling at the referees and just do your damn job play the game the way the referee stink we all
know that we've had plenty of crappy calls against us there also been crappy calls we benefited from
but the fact is you got to go out there and play the game and stop always looking we're starting
to become like a bunch of crybaby yeah that's that's what i see us now is we're starting to be the
crybaby's the league yeah and then it really takes away i mean it was not the officials that blew
a three to two lead with uh... nineteen or twenty seconds left in the game for the umpteenth time
this year it wasn't that merwellie or the lines meant that it was us and last time i checked it wasn't
the referees that got three shots on that in a third period i don't think merwellie made the line
up and put Chris wells in there and i don't think merwellie is the guy that said jovonowski's great
and put him on a line up and then had a sit-em on a bench for two periods because he kept coughing
and you know that the fans down here and that damn gritsky man do i hate him do i hate him
she's not i hate him and i don't want to see him again but listen i don't want to see that needle
nose dickhead again before you start going off yeah if if you look at it and the way that game was
played in the end in the third period you're saying you're saying that there's there's something that
they can reach down and pull an extra breath and come back and put on a performance like that see
one of the problems is when you're you're intentionally running a short bench because the first of all
once he got hurt so then you got jovonowski's sitting on a bench you're playing four four and a half
defenseman because laws you're not playing very much for whatever reason i don't know and by the
end of the game man he's four guys there murphy and the wariner and carciner and uh... who uh... spayla
those four guys are playing a whole game exactly you can't do that you can play five defenseman
a whole game and maybe get away with it but not four nobody can get into a rhythm and if you can't
get into rhythm it's just gonna it's gonna be a hard spot all night and you can't you can't play two
periods of hockey yeah and and and we only played one we didn't play two periods we played one
a quarter of a period four i don't care what rumor has to say okay the rimman uh... we got a
work on those alligator arms in the work in the worst in the in the words of Larry King worst
broadcasting i've ever had a great day okay we have an open line of browards seven six seven okay
here we go two sixteen to go in the third there we go calm down remember oh my god i just about
wanted to puke all over the carpet when they live in that time when a bea's are took that belly flop
where you go and bea's are what are you doing now
here's steward on a mobile hello great
hey um... i definitely agree with you on the quality of the cbc games versus what we have here yes
i feel sorry for the uh... slumper the cantifort addition our clueless they don't know uh...
what the real action is hey and i've only been following hockey i think three years now
and i even knew why the the goal isn't going to replace the penalty like you say
and um... and you can't just be professional saying why isn't it going to replay they can't
understand it not how to get the penalty yeah and then the coaches over there pointing up stairs and
screaming in the end of the cleaners carrying on you don't go upstairs on a penalty okay there were
there was nothing to review it had nothing to do with the man in the crease and Denise and uh...
remember our boat screaming all of that is not even close to the crease that wasn't the uh... debate
i'm i'm just i'm weak trying to explain it okay to these people out there who just don't get it
and part of the reason they don't get it is because it wasn't shown to them
or exactly i mean i'm not saying i agree with the call of time because i didn't see it i'm
i'm on my way home now hopefully i can catch it and see it good
but um... just uh... i mean we got a minute we got a minute wait a minute
minute left in regulation sir uh... hang on a second oh no it's coming
rickard just went off uh... we got a whistle here okay
we did this on the home opener too if you remember yeah against the ranger
yet but that but we had an excuse and i came was legit we got a really crappy
icing call that was a bad call by that lines been at trotch a frog
but in this game we got no excuse uh... nobody to blame but ourselves we know it
still we got to learn that the best defense is to keep the puck over there and not only that but it
seems to me that even though uh... we had the one goal just a lot we were still alive there
and over time and we still had a chance to win the game and they're the ones that got the winning goal
yeah what do we have three or four shots in the whole third period uh... well the last
sixty minutes we had one i think it was only three or four and a whole
the last sixteen minutes one shot are you ready for that sir yeah and the over time they were all
over us like stink on uh... stink on wells and uh... easily jolvin ask his worst game
i think i wouldn't say easily i don't know he we didn't get we didn't give him enough
a chance to be out there to make it his worst game he is he is an impediment man he's a killer
i mean all these like you said all these guys can eddy eddy and look at like ret Warner probably
have people don't know who he is and look at the game usually there you go have a great day pal
see you got to go now got to go now because it's come oh there's Adam graves coming out there
he makes me sick too they all make me sick when i got that ranger uniform on a one up you look at

ton of bricks in the sunday game here remember that for about three minutes oh yeah yeah and then last
night they said it might have been a broken ankle uh-huh and he put didn't he play last night
yeah but i'm saying what he finally got hit again ummm i didn't hear what the exactly the injury
was i had been broken ankle i said oh really um also you're watching sports channel now

i would call your cable company right now and bitch their ass out oh i've already done it before
yeah well do it again just for old time sick and uh also jovinovsky yeah at least he got two assists
but to the wrong team that's right he's got a lot of points in just that they're not for the right team
if we could just put those on his stats he'd be a killer oh yeah and uh christwell why okay
that's excellent he's summed up why should i waste all this verbiage on it okay why that's good

So clear channels about what stations?
133 at WIOD, happy
And what is this long the regulation ended like 85 minutes ago
And now sports channel Florida is showing like a 85 minute commercial sweep here
What the hell is that?
Please don't tell me that they're going to show the in-between period fall to roll
Because it seems like a very peculiar time
Do you know what I'm saying?
I can't imagine that they're going to go like skip all the in-between stuff and go right to the overtime
Here's another Nissan spot, here's another spot
Here's the dog name spot, here's a lady in Pompano
Hello
Yes ma'am
First of all I wanted to know what number is WQAM on the dial
560 but don't ask me again
I'm sorry
That's okay
And another thing I just started listening to you, I adore you
Of course, that's not the best thing on radio
What's not to like?
And if everybody just knew that this show was here I'd have a 100 share
And I listened to, well that's the only station I do listen to because of you
And I don't understand why you have to leave
Because I think a lot of people are going to leave with you
But that's not the point
Anyway, Karen Kay, I hate her, she's stupid
Yeah
And what else?
I think that's bad, but I adore you, you are so wonderful
Thanks, sweetheart
Thank you
Have a great life
Okay, oh here I do like this spot though, the woman's screw-in where the doctor is
I love the Cleveland Clinic of Florida
Have you ever seen this? Of course not, George, because you don't watch the game
You communist, commy bastard, here we go
Holds
Oh
It sounds like one of the coyotes here
Nice going, screwy
Oh another spot
What is it? It must be a 25 minute spot break now
Before we go to the overtime, nice going guys
We have an open line in Broward
7679-463-767-WI-O-D
Every man, woman and child is glued to sports channel of Florida right now waiting for the replay of that overtime
So we can see what's very, very closely
And even when they do see what really happened they'll still say you're wrong
Okay, I'm wrong
I'm really pulling for the Rangers for secret
If you had any idea how I despise, how I detest the Rangers, everything about them
Needle nose and at Messier and at Faggot, Lucro, but all those guys they make me sick to my stomach
And at Leach Brian
But hey, what do you say you're right, I'm wrong
I'm used to that
Here's Miami Beach, hello
Neo, how you doing?
Okay, sorry
I'm listening to your show today and I really didn't want to hear it because you know how we gave the game away last night
I thought with every sentence man it would be like ripping my heart out again and again
But remember it's Panthers and 6
You know what I'm saying we have to be happy
How we can still do it, we got to win tonight that's all
Got to come out of these first four with a split
Yeah, we had them beat, man
And I'm going to tell you something we got to play 60 minutes tonight, not 20 minutes, 60 minutes, 60 minutes
I got a question for you though
Even Mike Wallace knows the answer, 60 minutes
Yes
The two line pass, the guy said something about a two line pass, what is that?
Offside, sir, and that's offside
So that's offside
How could you watch hockey and not know what a two line offside passes?
I just didn't, I didn't
Okay
Two open lines in date, 62, two, another South Florida hockey fan, we know our crap, we really do yeah
Priest pleads guilty to stealing from church, a bad fact that I can barely read
Tampa, a priest to cue, this is an old, this is an old thing about his former male boyfriend
He pleaded guilty, he pleaded, he plotted on it
Because he needed the money to subsidize his young
Whatever it was, nice go on papa
Two open lines in date, 62, 29, 463, 62, 2WID and 2 on the other town lines
They're too busy to talk to me right now, they're all waiting, they're sitting there breathlessly
And then they're going to say, Chris Moore was right, we got Rob
Okay
Here's a pay phone and cutlerage, hello
Hello now, yes sir
It's really blown out here today
Despite that game last night, it blows
Hey when, when is anybody else going to learn in this downtown?
I'm under the blur, say two pet burns, pet burns
That's the only way you control the game, the old
You know, remember the Yankees last year against Baltimore?
Who?
And how Ricky Garcia controlled that call right there?
Yeah
By the way, do you see Roberta LMR, show cans with John Hershbeck on the way to the field yesterday?
Yes, I did see that
And then he's spitting his face again?
No, he didn't do that, it would have been great though if he would, wouldn't that have been great?
That would have been classic
Goes out there and shakes his hand, it says, by the way, I don't take it back
Oh, come on, there you go Bobby, nice going, yes?
I agree with you, I saw what happened, I watched that whole game
Yeah, I was taping it, he pushed him into the goal, he, and that's a great call
Melon B came flying out of there, he shoved Leach right into Richter, they both went spinning around
Richter spun around a whole 360 like a dreidel way out of position
And the puck goes in the net, they're not going to, well that's not a goal
It is not a goal today, it's not going to be a goal seven years from now
Chris working at 45 birthdays between now and then
It's still not going to be a goal, period, that's all end of conversation
I got some bad news though for tonight, I just, uh, I turned your last break, I tuned into 56
Doug McLean was on there talking to me about the time
Well that's bad news
Jovo is going to get more playing time tonight
Oh, great, maybe we can bring back Joe Serella
Well we have to win three out of four
No problem pal, piece of cake
It's in the sack
Hey, I can one more thing before I go
Yes
Harry
And, uh...
Yeah, okay, two open lines in day, 6229463, 6222, WYOD
And don't call me Harry, I was before I got the nice haircut
So that's, that is embarrassing Becky
That was, uh, I feel so...
There's nothing worse than people feeling that I'm cheap
And every now and then, like people will like the dry concepts, people that come to my house
And they do the thing and I don't tip them, okay?
Because I feel uncomfortable, you know what I'm saying?
Because it's a sponsor
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
If I know I'm supposed to give you a tip, I'll give you a good tip, like Valley Parking
Never less than five bucks, never
Most people give like two bucks now, right?
Buck two bucks, never less than five
So I'm not cheap, I'm a good tipper in restaurants
But I mean, tell me upfront what you expect, tell me what you want
And she comes here and she says, she says to me, uh, well I'll come back if you will tip me next time
And I'm thinking, what?
Well, we didn't know that they were taking all that money
Exactly, how am I supposed to know that?
I didn't know the shop was taking a whole 20 bucks
So I gave her another 20, I gave her 40 bucks for a haircut for the amount that would be like
Phil Henry paying 100 bucks with no hair
Do you know what I'm saying?
Here, here's 200 bucks, cut my hair, okay, oh there you go, thank you
Oh there's that BDI dead Smith on there again, man
Now, have you figured out which one's the real eye?
Come on, Ned, fast up to it, which one is the real stick and eye already?
God almighty
Here's Hollywood, hello
I can't believe they don't edit this in between junk out
I know it, I'm sitting here, I'm stalling for time
Because I want to see this over again, I've watched it 20 times at home on tape
Uncle Neil, by the way, it was too nothing, I don't know if anybody updated your Phoenix over Anna
Well, Phoenix won a game, I don't care about the score
But Phoenix won, so that ties it up to a piece
It makes it interesting, but Anheim got robbed and I was watching that game
I'm ruined for Anheim and I was saying to myself, I know whoever scores the first goal is going to win this game
It was just so tight right down to like, I think there was like seven minutes left when they started
Really?
How be Bull and must have played great, huh?
Oh, he played incredible
Yeah, in the last minute, he was making some unbelievable saves anyway
But back to this game and unfortunately I had to listen to up to overtime on the radio
But I got home in time to see overtime and when the incident happened, I didn't really catch the interference right away
Oh, of course not
And I was pissed, just like everybody else
I'm cursed and I'm screaming
But I stayed up long enough of course to watch the Anheim game and I watched Sports Center and sort of replayed a whole thing and sort of interference and was like, okay, so what's...
See, I mean, even if people don't agree with the call, okay?
Even if they don't agree with the interpretation or marijuana well, he's called
But at least show the people what happened so they understand what took place
Instead of they kept showing Mel and B and Leach on the ice in front of that over and over again
And rumor kept screaming and Denise screaming
Oh, look at that, there's not anybody close to the crease, they gotta go upstairs on this
This is the worst thing I've ever seen, the man was calling a penalty, don't you understand it?
He was calling a penalty, it's a...
Oh God
The interference had already happened
Right, before they...
And this, you know, what really pisses me off though is that
And let this esotericatin SOB get in there, what has it been hitting them?
I hate that guy, like poison, I think I hate him worse than you hate Gretzky
I doubt it
Oh, impossible
If anybody else would have scored the goal, I don't know, but this esotericatin I just hate his goal
Okay, we'll get him tonight
Anyway, we're gonna win tonight
My prediction five to two, they gotta come back, they got the young legs, two nights in a row, the range is gonna fall apart
Okay, and three in a row baby, we got out of the van
Okay, let's kick some assias, dumpy, that's dumpy junior junior
By the way, what did Ned Smith say?
For Christ's sake, I only had one eye
We have an open line at Broward, 7679, 463
Okay, here we go, finally, and a regulation
They just wasted 12 minutes, they must have shown a hole in between periods and again
Of course, they got a lot of time to fill here on the sports channel Florida thing
They got nothing but time to fill
So hey, let's just run the whole stupid, oh man, unbelievable
142 at WID, just with luck we might get to sound before the end of the show
And then you can all say, see you're wrong, he didn't do not and okay, I'm wrong
Takes a big, big, big fat man to admit that he's wrong, I'm wrong
Whatever it is, whatever the outcome is, whatever you see, just keep in mind
Neil is wrong, the coach is a genius, the general manager is a rocket scientist
Eddie Jovenowski is the best defenseman in history, he's better than Bobby Orren, Ray Borkfoot together
And Anacos
And Chris Wells, oh my god, forget about Gordy, how, forget about Rocket Richard, forget about Bobby Hall
Forget about Wayne Gretzky, forget Chris Wells, Jesus
143 at WID, you're gonna be up anyway tonight celebrating the big Panther win

It's way over time, thinking like we've lost
You're like stepping on, and what we've fun with you here
Pushes, Leach, right into Lector's, spins him around, the puck is in the lead
But he's way too far, I don't know if he's gonna ask for a replay
Now the puck went up, somebody's skate
Now Scott Melon B was closest to the priest, but there's no one else near the priest
Oh, man, the puck may have even gone off
