Hello to the WIOD Happy Monday to all and to all a good night.
Man, what a day yesterday.
How, what a game, what a performance.
What a lollipop little boy.
All right, just calm down, we'll get to that later.
And anyway, what a performance yesterday by somebody,
by Edmonton, that's who it was last night.
Man, there was a game.
Finally.
And yes, we left yesterday early
before we get some spy report here.
Oh, they left the game early with like six or seven minutes ago.
That's right.
That's right.
Now, yes, there were some people in Edmonton last night
who left that game early and came running back.
Because there's a team that actually,
at least showed up a little bit last night
and made a phenomenal comeback.
They're down three nothing with four minutes left in a game
and they wind up winning an OT, four to three.
Unfreak and believable.
The Erlers.
But the path is yesterday.
Must have missed the team bus to the arena.
Didn't show up a lick, not even a little bit.
Even alligator arm's rimmer with speechless.
Of course, he was not in a year.
So I guess he had to be speechless.
But he was speechless, had no excuses.
Of course, he blames Marty Strockner for missing that wide open net.
Nice going, Marty.
But hey, like he had a lot of company.
Nobody showed up.
Even the greaser, I mean, the Beaser led a couple of pretty
marginal goals in there that Gretzky shot just inside a blue line.
And then that other one at the robot.
I just, I mean, that was pretty greasy.
Greasy.
Everybody's stuck to join out.
But especially Eddie, Eddie was bad.
It was bad.
So it's one one going to New York tomorrow night.
And we got two back to back.
And by the way, speaking of alligator arms,
remember the, I want to give credit where credit is due.
Randy Molar has dubbed Jeff Rimmer as alligator arms.
Remember because of the fact that when, anytime there's a check
to be picked up, whether it's for dinner, for drinks, whatever it might be,
all of a sudden, Rimmer gets that short arm disease.
Can't reach for that check because the arms are like an alligator.
Man, they just barely get out of the body.
Nice go, Randy.
And don't overfeed, Ray Shepard.
People are getting worried.
So I'm sure we're going to have a lot of response to that tremendous performance yesterday, not.
And yes, we did leave early yesterday.
And it worked out great because I made a B-line straight up to Emerald Coast buffet.
And got there just before it got really crowded.
And they treated us great.
And it was marvelous.
So that was the right move to make.
They're walking out the door.
And there's one guy says, oh, yeah, even you're leaving early.
And he said, that's right.
See ya.
Bye-bye.
Nice knowing ya.
I love these Yentos over there.
Who think that they're going to tell ya when to leave.
I mean, they was over.
It was over.
There was no doubt.
We weren't even making a whimper in that third period, okay?
But everybody is a Yentah there.
And thanks for coming.
Yeah, that guy that sits next to me, Bruce, whatever's naming.
Thanks for coming.
Yeah, okay.
Everybody's got their nose in everybody else's business.
But in the meantime, their own ambiance at the game certainly could use a little work.
You know what I'm saying?
Guys, but they're okay.
106 was okay.
Even the two rows of misfits.
They were okay because the Ohio guy, who I find out doesn't really belong in our section.
Anyway, Mr. I'm drunk or I'm pretending to be drunken and coherent.
He was way upstairs.
We belong in the nosebleed.
So Friday night.
I don't... should I spend more than two or three hours on this today?
Should I spend more than four or five shows on this this week?
You know, once in a while I hear something on the ear.
It just... it inspires me to respond.
But what I heard on the ear Friday night on this radio station was so unbelievable.
So unbelievable.
Now I'm here in other stories.
I'm piecing this all together.
And what a piece of bone it all turns out to be.
Better watch yourself.
You better watch yourself.
Steve Knowsring.
Or she'll report you to the consultant.
I mean, what are we going to do then?
Want a lollipop little boy?
So anyway, Friday night I'm in the car and here's Aaron Kay or whatever the hell her name is on the ear.
And guess what?
No show.
I mean, no material.
None.
I guess she hadn't lost her gas cap again that day.
So there was nothing to talk about.
No real penetrating topics.
Like who should be bitch slap and if he ever lost your gas cap?
Right.
So what is she talking about?
This lightweight who wouldn't even make it on ear in Utica, New York?
On a bad day?
She's talking about, well, you know, some people on this station and every now and then she'd show my name in.
And it's obvious the whole show again.
Didn't I mention this last week that it seems that her or the game plan there were those two is like, let's go after Neil.
And Neil will talk about me a lot and make me into a big star.
I got news for a sweetheart, even mandrake the magician and Jesus and Abraham and Moses and Buddha.
They can't make you into a big star.
And as far as being too faced is concerned, let me say this.
You don't understand the difference between business and personal.
Personal I had been told by George and others that you were a very nice person off the air.
I met you in a hallway one day for about 30 seconds.
You seem like a very nice person seemed.
You can't really sum up a person, you know, in 30 seconds.
But seem like a nice little person.
You know what I'm saying?
Personal.
But business, different story.
So Aaron or Karen or whatever your name is.
If you want to come in here right now, anytime during the show, we got an open invitation sweetheart.
Come in here and I'll tell you right to your face.
You don't belong on a year for like two minutes, even to give the time.
You're pathetic.
And then he goes after the women again.
Well, how come Rukka was a woman?
How come I say good things about her because she does a good show and she's that's right.
She's Jewish.
And you're nepotistic that that's what I never thought about that.
She's Jewish and likes basketball, which I don't like.
That must be it.
How about Jennifer Rem?
She was a woman.
She still is a woman last time I checked.
Not too close.
But love Jennifer.
Want a lollipop little boy?
So anyway.
So getting back to Aaron case or her topic, a topic is that all she hears on a station all day is how about the station sucks and about papan how boring that is.
And nobody really cares about that.
See, she's been here for a total of three weeks.
She's an expert on what we should be talking about and also what the audience cares about and what this town is all about and what the topic should be all about.
She's the expert.
Since she has no material of her own, she's critiquing me and everybody else on here who've only been on this station for like I've been here over eight years, Rick and suds seven years.
George has been here for like what six, seven years, too long.
And she's the expert.
She's been here three weeks.
She knows what the audience wants to hear.
She knows what's interesting and even though this is all boring by the way, she's going to do it anyway one time just like in Godfather, just this one time K, I'll let you ask me about my business.
And no matter what you ask, the answer is no right.
So she's inviting people to call in and tell her that her show sucks.
And I thought to myself, this is a show.
This sounds like something Mr. Ego might have done like eight years ago on a bad day on a desperate day when he had no material, which was like almost any day.
That's how desperate it sounded to me.
And so what does she get? She gets on the one hand a handful, about four or five syrupy, psychophantic women, probably bull dikes calling it all.
You're so wonderful and Neil blows, Neil sucks.
Yeah, well, that's true.
And then the other hand she gets in, of course, some of the mouth breathing guys who are saying, you suck your show and that said.
And she kept insisting and pounding and pushing and pulling it.
I can't get anybody to call and tell me I suck.
See, I guess it never dawned on her that after like the first couple of days of listening, if people assume that your show sucks, if they don't like your act, they probably aren't listening anymore.
I know that comes as a great surprise, but most people, especially during the nighttime hours, if they have even a minimal amount of life, they're not sitting there listening to something that they think sucks.
Sweetheart, I hate to break the news to you. I got you down.
So I was just astonished with all of this. Then I was just here in a spy report, a little bird in the hallway was telling me that Thursday night she was on air and some caller made some comment about Walters Sabo.
However, the hell it started and she talked about how her boyfriend or consultant, so anyway, the next about ear wax, yeah, about how he we would stick a Q tip in his rear ear and get the wax and then stick it in this pocket because he's so forgetful, he's always thinking about what he's going to do next and then it kind of took a sexual turn.
And Steve knows ring the board up, but was chuckling and laughing his ass off during all of this because it was so ass and I and she became very red in the push and so I'm hearing from birds in the room.
Little birds in the flies on a wall and so they go to commercial break and come back and on the air, I want you to listen to this no commercial break.
He was laughing and there was a long pause, there's long pause like seven, 10 seconds in there and she says not jokingly, but seriously to Steve knows ring the board up, you better watch yourself.
Seriously, not jokingly, seriously because she has connections.
So anyway, the big rumor at the game yesterday from I heard several people is that WIDS for sale. Now of course the people of present packs and people would deny that vehemently because they would never
try to that upfront. Remember what we went through last year? It's like day, she have all over again. Only we have a little different perspective on it this time.
Thank God called security, but last year we went through months of this. I mean months like January and February and March, even before.
Yeah, it started in January, I think. Just shortly after Bob Green took me to lunch at Christmas time and insisted the station is not for sale. It's not being sold.
And here's our plans in the audio. So the station now we understand is for sale.
So she can go on here and say, well, nobody cares about all of this and about the insides. Yes, they do because this has been an amazing radio station for the last eight years plus and we've had
a hell of a relationship with the audience and there been a lot of great talents on here, which Phil Henry hopefully is in town and going to be here either today and or tomorrow both.
But man, oh man, what they've done. I mean, even your neighborhood butcher could never do to a raw piece of meat. What they've done to WIOD in the last six months. And yes, that is important to a lot of people out there in the audience and to me and those of us who make a living in a business, which quite frankly, sweetheart, I wouldn't buy a house, even a pup tent if I were you.
So I go back to talking about, you know, have you lost your gas cap? Does your chewing gum lose its flavor on the bed post overnight? Very important topics that the average Joe is very concerned about 10 30 11 o'clock at night is he's driving down a Hershey highway out there looking to be entertained.
Those are the kind of things that they want to sink their teeth into. And by the way, happy pay saw.
Did you give me a bum steer on that? What was the official starting date? Is it tomorrow tonight? Oh tonight? Tonight is pay saw. How do you like that? And I thought it was like this last weekend. I wondered what Howard Clymer wasn't eating motsas at the game yesterday.
So how do you like that? Happy pay saw to all. And what a bunch of crap Jews eat on pay saw. I'll tell you that. Motsa no taste like eating cardboard.
And what was the other stuff in Lorenzo spot about parsnips and turnips and rosemary and thyme and sage and crap like that?
Not my kind of holiday no wonder Jesus picked that time to like end it all you know what I'm saying? The last supper he said, fat okay, nail me up. It's time. If that's the best we can do, I'm ready to leave this planet.
Let's have a good holiday winner something like like poor. Um is a great holiday that even a goyem can enjoy if you need to write kind of homotox and there's something you can sink your thing into.
Yeah, I'm the one through save a little like a sedan. I want you hop inside my company car. I got the tickets and tax and eat that up. I'm gonna make it you and rainy old style.
I can do anything I want to do. I'm going to be consulting you. I'm giving that.
I got the power to hold in control.
I have a way to get your own show at a station down in Hollywood.
I don't care if you're ready to love. Just as long as you can stroke me good. I'm all the same baby and you'll do anything I want you to.
I'm your consultant woman. Spread your legs and I desire you. I'm gonna bone you. I'm gonna stop slot. I'm not in a real job. That's why I'm a consultant because I'm just an asshole.
Give me a big kiss and I will argue still not to be amazing at it. A good kiss and I really want it.
I got it. There. Give it to me. I wanted it wrong. I needed it. I want a kiss. Give it to me. The good thing they did was. If I'd written it just like this.
is that the bridge i'm gonna try it out on the top of the isn't good it's free what

art sends me a thing from people magazine it's all article family reunion about the godfather
and about the movie stars who were in it mostly is what it really is all about and it shows where
they are now and many of them you'd be amazed are morto marto dead sterling haiden played a corrupt
cup buddy did try the viola you had a great last meal it was the best in the city you said as he
was going yeah yeah like that sterling haiden played corrupt cop McCluskey in 1986 at age 70 he died
of prostate cancer john kazal fraydo i didn't know he was dead did you oh anyway he was a rising
star he was in uh dog day afternoon in 1978 to age 42 he died of bone cancer
Richard Castellano portrayed hitman clemenza he died of a heart attack in 1988 to date 55 he died of
fat as jack waltz john marley found a horse's head in bed 1984 he died after heart surgery
Richard cate Richard cate was a great actor by the way but you not old enough to remember sorry to it
who played rival boss don barzini died in his 60s of a heart attack in 1975
as luca bratsi lent a lenty Montana slept with the fishes in 1984 he too died of a heart attack
oh hey what is it because he was fat oh he also died of humongous fat
Alex roco who played mo green he's still having trouble seeing out of that one eye but he's still around
who else oh if you could see this picture of uh gianno russo who played carlo you would cry
anybody could believe there was a god am i he looked not saying he was a hot looking young guy but
he would look normal like your carlo right he looked uh for a while but anyway uh but new
if you look at him now with his pet pig oh my god krotec brutto multobruto anyway uh he's uh 53
years old he says he never did a movie after that where he wasn't a gangster the kind of set him
off for life also aevegoada which we all know and here's al martino no stranger to the mob al martino
says i thought i could play the role because i had lived it the problem was johnny fontain was widely
believed to be partner a pattern after frank sanatra indeed it says according to martino sanapura was so
angered by the parallels that old blue eyes and a team of lawyers tried to have the dani a johnny
fontain role cut from the movie he failed though the part was reduced in the end martino says i
sent frank a message telling him i was doing the role and thought he should step out whatever that means
he has no love for me and i feel the same for him in other words they hate each other like poison
and the sanatra still maintains that he don't know nothing where's the thing about aevegoada
here for christsecker here he is he's still kicking in alive it says uh he wants three amine
nominations for barney miller had his own spinoff fish in 1977 it was when he missed a wrap party
in 1982 for barney miller they was reported and rumored to be dead i lost a lot of work after that he
said he was rumored to be dead aevegoada he's still alive can you get me off the hook down
full time soon don't call me selling so anyway there's a for anybody that saw the godfather which
probably is none of you but you're missing it i'm telling you can't tell these people anything
here's hollywood hello hey now how you doing great great game left now oh yeah oh you mean the
Edmonton game i fell asleep in the second period after the sixteenth icing call that was back and
forth was great game what game are you talking about the beam into pants are game yes that wasn't last
night well yes the afternoon excuse me it sucked well there was a great game last night but you didn't
see it was on ESPN i watched and was on cbc it was great and it was a great performance by moge
with the final three three minutes left well anyway listen how many times is when's he going to leave
his feet there someone as many times as many times it takes to get stupid penalty so we lose games
and also what a dumb penalty to just get that greasy goal by needle nose there down a shot that
visa should have stopped and like immediately thereafter Lindsey gets a stupid charging penalty
as he leaves his feet it's obvious it's right in front of the ref and but i'm being all of a
sudden it's too nothing and i just love my people in section 230 after every time every single call
that Lindsey leaves his feet he almost hits the ceiling yeah that was real obvious yeah right
and you know something he did suck koharsky called a brutal game yesterday but we didn't lose because
of bad officiating and that was not a bad call that was a very accurate call right there but koharsky
was awful he would have awful brutal he was listen to a couple things um how how is it that the
uh... the pamphor patrol yeah when they when they're flipping these shirts up how is it that people
actually kill themselves for these t-shirts i've never seen anything like it before because this is
Miami that's what it is and they're free and they're free right and i see this one yenta she was
you know she went up for it and she landed on her head but she got the t-shirt she was happy that's

Unbelievable.
What a game that was last.
Now, what a comeback.
There was a team with character,
a young, they're fast, they're, they're hanging there.
It was unbelievable.
And I want to remind you, by the way,
it was our own Brian Murray, our general manager,
who never makes a mistake, who said,
early in the year, back in November after that ugly trade,
which I won't mention was made.
He said, I'd rather have Chris Wells than,
Doug Wade, any day of the week.
Okay, whatever you say, what a sense of humor,
our GM is God.

It's so, you're so transparent.
It's like looking through a panaglass.
We lose the game and right away,
or we won't want to say another about that.
We sure didn't watch that other game last night
because we don't know who those guys are in that team.
Is there anybody in this town
who knows anything about anything?
Other than early bird dinners,

Anything besides golf?

Good place.
Excellent.
How do you like that?
Yeah.
Listen, what's with those little beanie's anyway?
Are those orthodox Jews?
Yeah, they're real orthodox Jews who are living in the dark ages who are so beanie's
into their kids here and make them go around and everybody laughs at them.
Ah, look at David over there.
He's got a beanie on his head.
I want them to make sure they're dead.
Why don't they leave that to the Pope for crying out loud?
You know, the Pope is wearing a dress.
So how you know, beanie, who's going to even look at that?
Do you know what I'm saying?
Yep.
All right.
I'm out of material.
Thanks for the good news, pal.
Glad you enjoyed.

Uh, Julio Iglesias Jr.
Yeah, Julio Iglesias Jr.
And one of the fruity ones.
And he said,
Grab my junior, honey.
No, he's, uh, I don't know, but today he's kind of strange looking.
He's not really as fruity looking as I thought he was.
He's kind of strange looking though.
From the lower lip down, I mean, he's, uh, I give him a 98 on scale of one.
But from the lip up, he's kind of little on the, uh, strain side.
Julio Hunir.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, my name is Frank.
A long time listener, first time caller.
Yes.
Uh, two things I wanted to mention about the, uh, thing on the Godfather that you played.
Uh, there is another Italian in that movie that's still around.
That, uh, I do a jazz show in Miami on, uh, public radio once a week.
And, uh, you know, there's a jazz singer that was in that movie.
Morgana King.
Morgana King, right?
She's still around and still singing fine.
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
I used to have that on the tape somewhere, but it was that long gone.
Yeah, that was great.
That was the thing, Neil, too.
She's great Morgana King.
She's a great, the stylist, very underrated to Farfinger.
Uh, secondly, uh, I was originally from New York.
Of course, I followed the range.
It's back to the Jokmen days.
But uh, a long time hockey, watcher.
And I love the panthers and it's a tough one for me, but I'm just rooting for a good series.
And I want to see a good seven game series.
Well, we haven't seen a good series so far.
I'll tell you that.
I mean the first two games I mean the Panthers played nine good minutes in the first game
No good minutes in the game yesterday and arrangers first game didn't show up and yesterday
We're nothing to write home about either
It's what I've seen in those two games as far from what you'd call playoff hockey
You know you watch the other playoff games and you see these incredible games going on and phenomenal excitement like that Edmonton Dallas
Game last night and our two games man has been about as much excitement as turd and a punchball
I know I mean I've sort of been flipping back and forth and watching some of the other games
Yeah, there's been a lot of action already in the first round right Chicago beats Colorado and over time yesterday
I mean we've had some and double overtime no less we've had some real great playoff hockey out there
But we haven't seen any of it here. Yeah, I know all right Neil. I appreciate it and have a good show
Okay pal see ya two open lines a day down at the worst Monday of our lives the worst ever
Let's say cottage today even though it's the wrong holiday

Can you not find any other words other than douchebag and
Let me say let me say this to you. Okay. This is the first time you listen to the show. Yeah, it is
Your main scene and you're making me drink it 10 in the morning. I mean, it's pretty bad making you drink at 10
Amor you have a drinking problem? No, I don't know. I'm just I'm kidding
So then why are you listening is somebody holding you hostage now?
No, but I mean part three times if somebody is holding you hostage enforcing your list of the show
Okay, let me ask you something do you want to have a conversation or you just want to a pontificate?
I'm more than happy to have a conversation
It's like if you don't like the show then why are you listening?
Well, like I said it was a first-time listener and I was a fat. Let me say this to you if I turn on a radio show or a TV show
And I didn't like what I was hearing or watching
Guess what I would turn on something else. I wouldn't take the time and the trouble to call up and say well
Why don't you do why don't you do the show in a way that so I like it?
I didn't enjoy listening to your show. I said that at times you're very offensive
No, no, but you want me to do the show the way you want to hear it
You want to tell me how to do the show and what to say isn't that right?
No, I'm not telling you how to do your show. I'm just saying that you sound like you live in a locker room
No, I don't yes, you do I live in a real world and you know something I know
Okay, everybody I know uses the same words that I do in fact plenty of words that I use that we can't use on here as you know
You must hang around a lot of high schools because I don't know I don't I don't hang around high schools
We know some people who do but I don't hang around high schools. No, you don't no
So in other words you live in such a you live in such a goodie you live in a goodie too
Let me say it again. Can you hear me when I'm speaking or not? I can hear you fine. So why do you talk at the same time?
Well
What's the MW you got the radio up and back you like the sound of your own voice?
No, my boyfriend's listening. Oh your boyfriend's listening with the radio cranked up and back. Is he getting off on this?

I'm asking does a tax on own QVC
Not that I know of they they owned home shopping network which I don't think they own anymore
Oh, that's where he made he stepped into that crap and made a ton of money and now all of a sudden he's dangerous because he's got a lot of money
Oh, all right
I thought you don't keep it. All right
That's it. Maybe he does I don't know
But the only reason I think is because his dark hand is like every where you look his dark hand is in the background
There was there was a QVC sponsored
NASCAR
crashed a couple weeks ago. Yeah, and all that when they interviewed the driver all he kept to every other word was god damn it and
And damn this and the hell with this guy and guy
Yeah, I thought I was telling the wife that I wonder if he's gonna have a job next week

Thanks a lot see you in god dang
All right and thank you, no we have two open lines in date six two two not is it right next to denang is god dang
Two open lines in date six two two two W.I.O.D
We got one in Broward seven six seven nine four six three if you're offended by douchebag
If you're disgusted and revolting by the gutter locker room language on this show if you think that we ought to be hanging around high schools waiting out in the parking lot
I
Know some people are probably hanging around elementary schools, but I won't make you know names yet
Here's a mobile and crawl springs. Hello. Good y'all to feel. What is it good y'all to good y'all to have to use sir
Question for you. You don't wear a beanie on your head. Do you know? Oh, thank god. Oh, can't say that
Good question for you yesterday's game, which we won't go into length about was there a game yesterday here?
It's a little common do think could afford a few notice once you read these come central today. Yeah
Four page spread or two double page spread
Uh, qualifying the Rangers where we won the game Thursday night. Yeah, if you remember by the half of page. Yeah
This town is like
Forget it with anything. Well, they need to deal with the other sport but hockey
But the football right
Yeah, well, they do and you know, it's interesting that all the articles in here. I mean, Dave Joseph's column and Dave hide and
The chair anchor airvie article in here says the same thing. Yep says the same thing and you know the worst thing that could have happened
Would go ahead and get that first goal. Oh, that took the scene. I hate him that was a pretty greasy gold. Beeser should have had it
Beeser should have had it just inside the blue line of course. Where was the defense?
Where was the defense on a three on one?
The Rangers got the power play were short-handed and we give them a three on one were a man short
I mean, I have never seen anything so embarrassing seldom in my life. That was pathetic
That's the I went from blue line to blue line right down the board. Yep
I'll see you on one with the power play. How come we're not back where the hell are our guys?
What are they thinking about while we're still in the game?
I've also liked another conversation Doug McLean gave to Marty Strock after he whiffed on that one
When he shouted wise
Well Doug McLean don't like Marty Strock in the first place
I'm gonna tell you the only good shift that we had for many buddy in that game was Strockas first shift in the game
Strocka was great
He was in there for check and he was kicking ass
He was keeping it in and then he eventually
Duro penalty when they hauled him down for the third time
Gauharski finally had to call it so Strocka had a great shift there
He did miss the buck the puck was bouncing on a one-year talking about what the wide open net
Because the ice here is the worst in league. It's a nightmare and the puck was bouncing
But then you know just also uh finally latent the game he puts Strocka out there with lorry and shepherd on the power play after we were out of the game
But the coach now has got a new lover boy and that's Kirk Mueller
He's obsessed with Kirk Mueller
Kirk had a couple of good games there
So now all of a sudden Kirk's on his regular shift he's out there in a power play in set of Strocka
He's all over the place and the what did he do?
One hand one good shot that was it the ranger really took out
Melon being shepherd out of the game. Yep
It really ached them out like we did with Krebski and well
We played with with no intensity whatsoever. We got a lot of stupid penalties
Lindsay's Lindsey's dumb penalty was unconsumable and he's been doing that a lot lately and he should know better
We Billy Lindsay doesn't need to be a goon on this team to play well. That's not what we pay him for
No, okay, we all know one thing McCleen must have told was keep your hands in your
I used sick. Yeah, and you're saying the bill empty happens to be a good looking for the penalty
ridiculous. Yep
All right, let's hope for a better one tomorrow. Okay pal. We're still alive. All right, see ya
They hit us with three goals and we're still alive
We have an open line in day 622 W I O D. We have two and Broward 7679 463
Here's Kendall. Hello, hey Neil how's going? Okay on that first bowl with Gratsky
The Bees are why was he so like far out of the goal? He was very when I saw the replay
He was way I mean
There's nothing wrong with being out of the goal to cut down the angle
But he just was not in the right position
He was at a wrong angle. He was like four foot out of the goal. Yeah, I thought he was a little too out
And he didn't have it out of the way. No, he wasn't too far out
He just was on a he didn't have he was on a bad angle
He just didn't cover the right part of the net right right. Yeah, well hopefully we'll pick it up tomorrow
Yeah, spy report. Yes
That guy on Zeta Paul. Yeah
He's through and hockey bits to copy and you like exact to the tee almost talks like you now. What do you mean hockey bits?
He does hockey highlights now. Oh no in the morning. Oh no
I happen to listen to Zeta of the uh, Friday morning
And he like at seven in the morning. Yeah, and he does your bit at seven in the morning
Well, does my bit what do you mean my bit what bit does hockey highlights? He's eating on the air
You know, I think he got a copy at all you from it
Well, that's one thing about Paul man
He never had an original even when he farts. It smells like somebody else's have a great day pal
Okay, oh, I shouldn't have said that get that bitch upset that called before
That's got her boyfriend in the other room with the radio turned up real out that fucking bitch
Yeah, go find something you might be able to relate to okay go turn on the uh, Jenny Jones
Something go to go to Jenny Jones maybe you could lose some weight you slob
God almighty. I these women in his town
That's a big part. You know, we had a lot of women come up to me yesterday before the game
I signed autographs that were very nice
Can we get our picture made with you no problem
But I'd say about 85 90% of the women in his town got no sense of humor whatsoever
They're uptight they're repressed. They're living like in the uh 15th century already
Here's a lady in Delray Beach. Hello
Hi Neil. Yes, ma'am. You're a lady who's not uptight and repressed. Well, thank god right damn it

Anyhow, I just as long as you're ripping everybody in a hole today

Well, they couldn't stand her here before they can't stand her here now and they kicked her out in New York kind of like the Irene Richard of TV

Here's the cover of Time magazine tinkerbell tells all and tinkerbell is saying I'm a fairy
Then here's L.C. The board and cow saying I'm a homo holding a thing of milk
And then here's popular mechanics saying with ready kilowatt saying I'm AC DC and here's Jim Maddett saying I like it
So it's all on there on the cartoon
Ignore the bad boost the good and Cal Thomas is the Hakanah trying to get about Ellen and Ellen is coming out
And those awful TV people and about family values and boppa bond other it's all a bunch of propaganda and it's not entertainment
So here it is he says all over America the New York Times tells us lesbians will be partying on the night of April 30th
During Ellen's broadcast all those amiss type here and it says hezbians
Thesbians will be celebrating that must be what it is
Some hip television critics are praising the network for its daring and courage
Here you go listen to this real courage would portray Ellen or one like her as a heterosexual married stay at home mom
Who goes to church with her husband and children votes Republican loves Ronald Reagan listens to rush limbaugh and honors her country
Oh, yeah exactly
Oh my god. Oh hallelujah and probably gives a sense might a gym baker and Tammy fade to in her spare time
So Tammy can afford that expensive makeup
Wake up and sniff it man wake up and sniff it right now before it's too late
What are we doing for lunch today by the way just to piss off the guy that says I eat too much
It's a habit, you know eating is every now and then you just find yourself eating a meal
When you least expect it there you are sitting down there's food in front of you. You're eating a meal
I know it's a terrible habit
Although I understand that if you go like three four months without eating you won't want to anymore
Yeah, oh, I think it's more than that
So what do we want to do Wayne Arnold on paysox that would be good?

the laser show and they really went ballistic

about uh two weeks ago i was in Orlando at the Orlando arena there was a big motivational program
that Anthony robins put on and oh Anthony robins that figure yeah right oh there's some good good
speakers there and in the middle of the whole thing one of the speakers was your buddy Larry King
yeah uh he was sort of i don't know what he was there for to be very honest but he kind of
humid up and he did do some reminiscent about some stories and he mentioned wiod and uh different
things that happened while he was down in in the Miami area yeah do you mention he mentioned all
the money that he borrowed from people under false pretends that ever paid him back no he didn't talk
about that oh i don't know why he didn't talk about i've been doing this a long time yeah he probably
felt uneasy talking about that yeah but it was really i mean an excellent program and it's kind of cute
to see him there it was cute to see him there it was cute to see him there because it kind of
bounced off of all the serious people over there because i know a lot of the people at the he
owes five grand and two grand they they'd love to have the money back i will i give it to you they
want it back i will i give it to you well i'm sure i know one guy the dog food guy that i did
business with many many years ago he'd like to have that five grand back i will i give it to you okay
well was there is the only story you spoke about in all of all of the work that he did with years
with only about Miami he didn't he didn't talk about where he is now well you know you know how
sometimes your memory uh twist and turns and you know what i'm saying the past the passage of time
kind of romanticizes the way you remember things in the past uh huh i think Larry may be uh
slightly guilty of that well i will i give it to you there's a disease out there that they say

know i it's like it's like buddhist for Joseph Smith i mean it's just uh they don't you know

she'll be singing away.
Roar!
I'll hear you sing.
...
So speaking of a paysoft, there's a big thing in lifestyle in the Sun's Emily, another
pandering section.
One quote, many collars, it says, Jews live in worship in various ways, but under all their
differences, they remain a nation of people.
Yeah, you should live so long.
So anyway, it's got a picture of Jewish scholars up here.
Look at this, older than older than Moshi Pupka in a bed day, and they've got the Torah
out there.
And young Israel synagogue in Hollywood, young me under the age of 110, but not too much.
Striped prayer shawls are typical of the Orthodox tradition.
Look at that.
Look at those al-Tabubbitchq's there.
Look at that.
And it goes on.
It says there's 650,000 Jews in South Florida, which means if there's four million people
down here, there's like almost three and a half million goiim here.
Can you believe any wonder why we got so many problems?
We have an open line in date, 622-946-3622-WIOD.
Here is the Lake Worth.
Hello.
What is it?
I do have a ball spot.
Do you?
I saw your buddy Larry King last Saturday at the Whitaker Telehoyah fight in Las Vegas
with his 22nd life.
Nice young babe.
Did you ask him to give you the money back?
He was there walking around strutting stuff.
Free tickets of course.
I will give it to you.
That's right.
I ran into a lady that remembers you from top radio.
And we were sitting having dinner and she says there was a guy from Florida who used a bad mouth up here at the Imperial Palace.
And she remembers your trip with Bob Lincoln.
And Connie Ross, she was a director.
I have no idea who that is.
She said she called you once and you turned out to be a real nice guy.
She got bad reports of you bad mouth.
What you got were troublemakers trying to ruin that trip.
We had other travel agents trying to screw up that trip.
And we had callers, you know, the guy that owns the Imperial Palace as you may know, has a collection of all these old antique cars and the Hitler memorabilia and stuff.
And she does a show out there every Saturday night.
Right.
And so people were calling about that.
So right away we had spy reports going out there that I'm ripping them and that they're whatever.
But they were very nice to us.
Oh yeah, she said that that she finally talks to you one day. She said everything was fine.
Right.
She remembered a guy. She couldn't remember his name and I said, how about Bob Lincoln?
Yeah.
She said, oh, what a thief he was.
Really?
You heard that, Bob?
Yeah, Bob, you got it.
Okay.
We're just out across the country on you.
No thief, he said, not peace.
Well, a piece of thief.
Okay, pal, thanks for the good news.
Okay.
We have two open lines in date.
Six, two, two.
Oh, thank you so much, Bonnie and God bless you so much.
Six, two, two, two, WI O D.
We have an open line on the outer timeline.
Have audio like it's drape, by the way.
But it's before she doesn't care.
I'll say that much for her.
She doesn't care about drape.
She said if it was good enough for Jesus, it's good enough for me.
Yeah, I hear he ate pork.
We have two open lines in date.
Six, two, two, nine, four, six, three, six, two, two.
WI O D. That's what I hear.
Of course, you never trust the guys I hear that from.
Here's Hollywood. Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Oh, how are you?
Great.
Just got my paycheck, pal.
I was worried you wouldn't be on the air live tomorrow.
Yeah, I'll be here.
All right.
Even though it's Paisach, man, and some other people are taking off for the holiday
because at the holiday time everybody gets real Jewish.
You know what I'm saying?
I don't want to mention no names.
But some people get real Jewish.
But anyway.
Have you seen Brook Daniels and Randy Rhodes in the same room?
Same person.
Sorry, Brook.
I'm sorry.
Brook is, what do I say about that?
You know, it is astonishing.
Isn't it that we could find two people in such a short period of time
who sound and are so much alike?
Never met either of them, but they do sound alike.
I mean, shock.
I will say this.
Randy can't duplicate that laugh.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
You're out, Randy.
Hey, I appreciate you being honest about the problem with Miami.
It is the fans.
It's the fans in every sport.
It doesn't matter.
We're all from somewhere else.
I do.
I mean, look at my Toronto Maple Leafs.
And by the way, Cliff Fletcher was there at the game again yesterday.
They would like to have shot him if I had a rifle.
But at any rate, I mean, they still sell out all the games.
Well, that's because hockey is a religion.
It's a way of life.
They understand that they love it.
They support their team.
Here it's like, what have you done for me in the last 24 hours?
And if you haven't done a phenomenal performance,
it got for a bit of your laws.
And got for a bit of your laws.
Did you stunt that joint out?
We don't got nothing to say about you.
Like screw you guys.
What kind of attitude is that?
What's the more dramatic word for fickle?
I'll work on it.
Fickle's pretty good.
Hey, play me a burp so I can get my son to do one.
Okay.
I love you, Neil.
Here's one.
There you go.
Better go clean up.
Okay.
We have an open line at day at 629-463.
We have two and a brow at 767-9463.
Thanks to Murray and Wayne Arnold and all those goyam and other foods here,
fat riches here.
Oh, thank you so much.
He's bringing me some goyam drops.
See your horses at a rough week.
Here they are.
They just want them just crossed that one little moment just crossed the line.
That's all right.
They'll be all right.
You stiff them.
Okay.
We have an open line at day at 622-29463.
Two and a brow at 767-WYOD and one on the other town line.
On paysoft, we got tray food here at Fat Ridge shows up.
How do you like that?
Here's a mobile and Palm Beach.
Hello.
Hey, Neil. How you doing?
When is DST, sir?
Are you celebrating the Jewish Passover?
Well, my question is going to tie both the hockey and Passover together.
Great.
We need a prayer, man.
I'll tell you that after yesterday.
We need several prayers.
We need Francis' come on the air, so people will stop.
Oh, that's right.
Judy Garland was not Jewish.
Her real name was Francis' come.
She was as Goyasha as the day is long.
And Eliza Manelli, if somebody can't tell that's a pretty Italian name, they need help.
Anyway.
Yes.
Okay, met the hockey game yesterday and Thursday.
Thursday game was excellent.
By the way, but anyway, yesterday's game.
If there's a hat trick, and somebody's wearing a Yamaka, do they take off the Yamaka and throw it on the ice?
We rip it off their head and we throw it on the ice.
Excellent.
That's right.
That's one of the no proper etiquette.
Thank you, sir.
And then we take the Goyasha players who aren't circumcised into locker room and we give them a quick brisk.
Hey, can I call Rich Clark and Don'tign a couple of dudes back?
They're doing a brisk business. Have a great day, pal.
Thank you, sir.
Okay.
Two open lines a day to wonder if Judy Hall of Circumcised, now we'll find out.
6-2-2-9-463, indeed.
Open line and Broward, 7-6-7-W-I-D.
By the way, next time you talk to Kevin Wallace, find out if Brad Kramer circumcised.
12-26-W-I-O-D on a really great Monday.
You might be asking, of course, Monash Danna, High Laila, Howzeh, or you might be asking what they're all so great about it.
Because I got my paycheck in my hand right now.
That's why.
That's why, because I got my check.
I'm in my hand.
I'm squeezing it as we speak and now life is almost worth living and I might think about coming back tomorrow.
Unless, of course, these far-bitching are going to say, oh, by the way, here's another check and don't bother coming back.
In which I'd say, oh, thank you so much.
I could use a few months off.
12-26-W-I-O-S. How is Harry Penis doing?
I understand he's in the building right now trying to get the lay of the land, trying to figure out what's going on here.
Is he in there drinking diet soda, by the way?
Did you walk by the program director? Was he in there drinking diet soda out of a bottle?
I don't think so.
Oh, I hope not.
God, I'm Tonya.
This man will come at suicide by a caffeine overload.
Diet soda out straight out of the bottle by the gallon by the multilater.
I mean, just they should put it in the gigantic trough and just give him a big straw.
Of course, to show you what the radio business and how George is drinking diet Pepsi out of like a small one
out of a one-liter bottle with a botelia de Pepsi.
12-27-W-I-O-D if you're...
6-10-W-I-O-D.
The official party station of the American Family Federation.
Hardaway left for it.
Left side, lie morally.
3.0!
Oh, he hit it.
Oh, he hit it.
I don't mean that was a 3.
I mean that was from the moon.
From the moon.
From his restaurant.
About three blocks from here.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Okay, just calm down.
So I just met David Halberstam for the first time in my life.
He's about what we say about two foot six.
He weighs about 80 pounds soaking wet.
Nice guy, small guy, little guy.
He could be a jockey, couldn't he?
I'd say he weighs about good by 95.
Anybody need a rider at Hylia?
David Halberstam, a great guy.
And he brings me in a bill you would take, which I already have,
but thanks anyway for the effort.
There's a good guy, man.
Of course he's Jewish.
What does that tell you?
And he brings us some...
Shamura Matsu made by hand in Brooklyn on Albany Avenue near Empire Boulevard.
So you know, and it's by the...
The Browsky and Y Tenenbaum.
And on the bottom of the box it says,
Oi!
Look at that.
Have you ever had Matsu?
No.
You haven't?
No.
Oh, here's your lucky day.
In fact, maybe we could get David back, because he had a sharp instrument in his pocket.
A bris and your first pizza Matsu on the same day.
All right!
Ooooo!
Mmm.
Boy, this is...
You know what this is like?
It's like, you're not really sure if you open the box or not.
It's like eating the cardboard, just like I said.
There's no difference.
It's in a cardboard box.
And when you finish, you can eat the cardboard,
because you know what it's Jews.
We like to, you know, we don't want to waste anything.
Finish your plates, scrape it off your plate now.
That looks like it would be good with like some guacamole.
No, it would be good with some butter and the salt,
or even better with some cream cheese and strawberry preserves,
which would be okay for pay-sol, I believe.
I don't know.
It's one...
Some real Jew out there will have to call in and really tell us what you can and can't...
...on Passover.
Now, white hearts are definitely okay.
And the Neely Burgers would cheese, and bacon are definitely okay.
Up until six o'clock or seven,
what's sundown at night?
About 7.15, 7.30, something like that.
Up until official sundown at night, it's okay.
Otherwise, you're going to go to purgatory forever.
Here's North Miami.
Hello.
Manail.
Yes?
Hi.
Happy day, Seth.
And back to you.
You're here with your obsession with brochas last week.
What happened to notice?
I just thought of a great line for the end result when they call in.
Yes?
I'm going to have to say a broch against you.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Give that one to your...
...Carrion cheek, make a show out of it tonight.
Okay. We have all the deadlines open.
622-946-3622-W-I-O-D.
Yeah. Matsu is...
This is Shamura Matsu.
Not to be confused with the regular cheap stuff that you buy in the store.
For like 13 bucks, for a five-pound box.
Because they like ripping off the Jews.
And that's what it's all about since the beginning of time.
Look at the Bible.
What does it say in Genesis?
All the goi-am are going to rip off the Jews.
It is written.
It's written right there in Genesis, baby.
When in doubt, rip it out.
Here's Miami.
Hello?
Okay. Nice talking to you.
When you call them, when you call from Miami and they're out of townline, you know what you're in for.
Here's Hollywood.
Hello?
Hollywood.
Hello.
Yes.
Hey, Neil.
Am I on?
Yes, sir. It sounds exactly like you or your twin brother.
Yes.
All right, man.
This is Roger.
We're at the same age and everything.
I just finished the book last week.
Charles Templeton.
Yes?
Farewell to God.
Did I tell you it was great?
Man, Neil.
You put a whole new drill thing to me all my life.
Yeah.
And after reading this, man, I am free, baby.
All right.
I am free.
Near right.
You're the man.
God bless you, man.
God bless you, my child.
Thank you.
Okay, and happy paysock.
Okay.
Go put on a armicle before it's too late and you wind up burning in purgatory wherever it's supposed to burn.
That's what Linda Blair said.
It burns.
We have an open line.
In fact, I'd like to be at burns right now.
I have a nice stick.
Why do you eat so much food?
We had that one go.
I call this morning because I feel like it.
Okay, because it's a free country so far.
And if I feel like eating a lot of food, it's my business.
Okay, plus I can afford to buy it.
But I rather get it for free.
Rather get it for free like at the Emerald Coast yesterday.
Thank you very much, by the way.
Oh, yeah.
I'm a big celebrity over there now.
He's eaten for free.
Chinese.
No, that's right.
In the middle of all you old Jews who are paying up there, I'm eating for free.
Okay, eat your cookies out.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I'm a rabbi.
You had a couple questions what you could eat on paysoft.
You're a rabbi?
I'm a rabbi.
And you know what?
You're not an orthodox, do you, are you?
Yeah.
I'm from Toronto and I'm a native leaf fan.
All right.
Well, let's say a brochle for the leaves.
They need more than one brochle.
In fact, when Cliff Fletcher, when I saw him in the stands yesterday,
I brach the couple of times all over my shoes.
Anyway, the cream cheese is fine and they just have a hexer on it.
You should have a one?
A hexer, a kosher, a paysoft stamp.
Oh, in other words, it has to be from the circle you ranch.
From the what?
The circle you ranch.
It's about to have a little...
Okay, or OU.
Yeah.
Or how about OY?
How would that be?
All the brochles to the panthers and if they get a hat...
So, so what can you...
What can you...
Yeah.
Will you listen to me, my crazy Jewish friend?
Will you listen to me?
So, what can you eat tonight?
What can you eat tonight?
Besides MOTSA.
I mean, after the first 15 pounds, it gets a little bit old.
You can have meat.
You can have your roast beef there.
Yeah.
That's part of the African style.
And my white hots from Rochester, I would pork.
And have some maroise, some...
Some good old pork.
How about Borst?
Borst is ALK.
Oh, fair.
Okay, have a great paysoft.
Okay, have a seasoned paysoft.
And go panthers, go leaves.
God bless you.
Take care, Bob.
Go leaves. Go.
Get out of here.
Okay, there's a man from the Stone Age.
We have two open lines in day and 622-946-3622-WYOD.
Harry Valentine, by the way, is eating trade today.
I just want you to know that.
What did he take out of there?
Like, uh...
A few nearly burgers.
That boy, Harry, will indoctrinate you as to what it's really
is all about on his show.
I don't care what that silly bitch says at night.
The one that desperately needs some material.
The one that couldn't do a show if he had the gun to her head.
But let's...
Let's give it a shot.
Oh, like I said, let's give it a shot.
Here's a Davy.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
When you go to the new station, will you be giving away one to mug?
Yes, we will as a matter of fact that we got a special on that.
Oh, good to hear.
Thanks, push on them.
Good to hear.
Uh-huh.
Listen, a spy report on the fickle fans of hockey Thursday night
went down to the arena without a ticket.
A ten dollars to get in.
Ten bucks?
And there was lots to be had out there.
So, there is fickle as ever.
That's pathetic.
I agree.
Ten bucks?
Ten bucks, the scalpers were crying.
Minimum should have been 200.
Exactly.
Minimum.
The scalpers said it's too early in the series.
They're not excited yet.
Oh, yeah.
Well, if they weren't excited before it started after yesterday,
they should be in a deep coma.
I agree.
Neil, a happy paysa.
And back to you.
Thank you.
Okay, see you in line for the White Hots.
Two open lines in day at 622-946-3622-WYOD.
And we have an open line in Broward, 767-9463-767-WYOD.
Rich just happened to be in the neighborhood when the food came in.
It is now throwing out.
It looks like a scene from FATSO.
14 boxes of Chinese food.
Okay, here's Pemberg Pines on a mobile.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes.
I'm a young Jewish man living in South Florida.
All right.
I want to say happy paysa.
You don't wear a beanie, do you?
No, not all the time.
What do you mean all the time?
I only like to temple.
Okay, but I mean not out on the street.
Oh, hell no.
Not in school, just in shul.
Right, right, right.
That would be a great poster campaign.
Not in school, just in shul.
I agree.
I like it.
What's up with these panther fans, man?
Yeah.
I don't understand.
I'm not here for many of them.
I don't know that there are any left.
I don't understand.
I mean, they make the play.
We like to panthers till yesterday.
Yeah.
I mean, you make the play.
But after that game, it's Aachenwe.
I have a shameless request.
Yeah.
I want to hear.
I'm an asshole by Timothy Leary.
By Timothy Leary?
Yes.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Timothy Leary, there was a real asshole for you.
Do all that drugs.
We have two open lines in date.
6229-463-6222-WIOD.
Do all that many drugs.
You can't even find an asshole.
Much less than no one.
We have an open line on the mobile and purple line.
Pond IOD.
You know, it's out of town lines.
Today, man, I wouldn't wish him on Hermann Gehring.
1-884-7-4-WIOD on a...
Of course, that's in Palm Beach.
There, but is he getting ready for a...
Paisenstownite in Palm Beach?
Aren't they?
There's like three Jews up there.
That's under the age of 100.
Plus, there's about 5,000 over the age of 100.
All jammed in there in Cemetery Village.
Boy, what a place to add is.
Mm-mm.
Here's the mobile and Delray Beach.
Hello?
Any meal?
Yes, sir.
Do you want to know what you can eat on paths over other than Mopta?
Yeah.
Well, I have it to work from the Bisco.
So, trisket and wheat, then, is all kosher.
Great.
So, that's, you know, it's a little bit of savior
better than eating that cardboard.
I'll stick with my white hots in my Neely Burgers.
All right, Neil, happy pace.
Okay, and back to you.
Thanks.
Since I already know I'm going to burn like hell for a long time,
because my mother's so socks and hell would lend a bluer.
As the lendabler said, let's all go see the exorcist.
If they can bring the godfather back, which is great,
I say they should definitely force everybody to go see the Echersist.
Especially if they're missing scenes.
What do you mean?
I just think that that would be great if there were.
If there were missing scenes?
Yeah.
What does that mean?
All these movies that they're re-releasing have all these like extra footage or added footage.
Oh, I see what you're saying.
If they're really missing scenes.
I see what you're saying.
I don't think that needs too much chosen mother.
I don't think it needs too much sprusin, okay?
Unless you like green pea soup.
Oh, maybe 3D.
That would be good.
That would have been great.
I remember the first 3D movie I saw was The House of Wax.
And then there was a movie called The Maze.
Or something like that.
It had this big guy kept turning into a frog.
And jumping throughout the screen, that was great.
Here's Cooper City.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, ma'am.
Happy Path of a...
Happy Pace-Ach.
Where are you?
Great.
I had a question.
I hate to go this direction.
But can I talk to the doggy doctor a second?
Yeah.
My thing goes about a year ago.
You were saying how you had retriever.
And he had ear infection.
Uh-huh.
And you switched his dog food and they went away.
Yeah.
What dog food did you put him on?
Kibbles and bits.
Oh, just store bought kibbles and bits?
Yeah.
No more ear infections.
Kibbles and bits.
Lean.
Lean because he was fat.
Lost a lot of weight by dog.
Was it like a diet dog food?
In fact, kibbles and bits gives you the part of something that rhymes with it.
What is it?
No, it's just whatever agrees with your particular dog.
My dog has a lot of allergies.
Oh, okay.
Well, at least a few anyway.
And if you give him kind of a certain kind of food, almost any kind of food, he starts
having ear infections and giving you a dirty look.
And this particular food happens to agree with him.
And so my doggy doctor said, stick with it.
And so he's never had any more infections since then?
He has never had, well, I mean, they're not perfect.
You have to keep working on it.
But very rarely, his ears are pretty good.
Okay, okay.
I think he's like, is my poor dog with this black stuff in the ears?
And, um, oh, it's horrible.
It's black.
Well, let's not go there.
Mike?
Fatrid says it's mites.
It might be.
It might be mites?
It might.
Okay, I guess I'm making a trip to the vet.
Well, yeah, why don't you go to the vet?
Don't be so cheap just because you're Jewish.
Doesn't mean you have to be cheap to prove it.
Oh, no, definitely not cheap when it comes to him.
Most of us Jews are really big spenders.
Yeah, we definitely.
Must we live in Sunrise or Tamarack?
I had the misfortune of getting stuck out way on it.
You know what I'm going to start doing?
I'm going to start when I go to the Emerald Coast on Sunday.
I'm going to sit there outside on the bench with a big sign.
Even if they want to see me in there right away, I'm going to sit out there for half an hour.
And when all the old Jews come by, the sign's going to say, I'm near Rogers and I'm eating here for free today.
Oh, well.
Just to piss off those old, old, cheap Jews.
You will have a denture riot, I think.
Uh-huh.
They'll be throwing them right at you.
That's right.
Okay, well, again, happy paystuff.
Go panthers.
I'm still a panther fan.
They can lose.
You're the one, huh?
I am the one.
You and I, we're hanging in there.
All we got to do is split in New York.
We'll be all right.
We're going to be fine.
And if we're not fine, we'll be fine again someday.
That's right.
It's not the end of the world.
There are still ours.
They're always going to be our...
And if we're not fine, we'll be goldstein.
And we're stuck with them.
Okay.
Have a great day, sweetheart.
Say goodbye.
I'll be right there, Chi.
610 WIOT.
Folks, I'd like to sing a song about the American Dream.
About me, about you.
About the way our American hearts beat way down
in the bottom of our chest.
How about that special feeling we get in the cockles for hours?
Maybe below the cockles, maybe in the subcockware area,
maybe in the liver, maybe in the chimneys,
maybe even in the colon.
We don't know.
I'm just a regular joke with a regular job.
I'm your average white, superman, I slow.
I like football, and I'm torn open, books about gold.
I got an average house where the nice hardwood floor,
my wife, and my job, my kids, and my car.
I'll feed on my table and I'll keep it to go.
But sometimes I just hate enough to keep a man like me.
Oh, no, no, wait.
I know I've got to go out and have fun.
It's someone else's expense.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I try really slow in the olds for fast lanes.
Well, people behind me are going insane.
I'm on a tour, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm on a tour, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I use public toilets and I f***ing saw a seat.
I walk around in the summer times, saying,
I'm about to speed.
I'm on a tour, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm on a tour, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sometimes I pour in the handicap spaces.
Well, handicap people make handicap spaces.
I'm on a tour, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm on a tour, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm on a tour, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Maybe I should be singing this song.
Ranting and raping and carrying on.
Maybe they're right for they tell me I'm wrong.
I'm on a tour, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on a tour, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on a tour, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to get myself a 1967 Cadillac Guilderado convertible.
I think with a whale skin, a half the caps,
and all other cow in the career
and big brown baby seal eyes for a headlight scan.
And I'm going to drive around in that baby
at 115 miles per hour, just getting one mop regal.
It's like a now-quarter funder she's purchased my town
with the old fashioned sign by the great of all styrofoam containers.
And when I'm done sucking down those grease ball burgers,
I'm going to wipe my mop with the American flags,
and then I'm going to toss the styrofoam containers right off the side
and then I'm going to catch them, think anybody can do it by the end of life.
Because we got the bomb, that's why.
Jewards, nuclear.
In westerns of days, Russia, Germany, Romania,
they can have all the democracy they want.
They can have a big democracy, Kate, walk right through the middle
and see it even square, and it won't make a lick of difference
because we got the bomb.
So dad, John Wayne's not dead.
He's frozen, and as soon as we find a cure for cancer,
we're going to throw out the dupes, and he's going to be pretty pissed off.
You know why? Have you ever taken a cold shower?
We multiply that by 15 million times, that's how pissed off the dupes can be.
I'm going to do it, and John gets a betty,
and leave arm and face and second boy, and a case away,
and drive down a big saint.
You know who really are an asshole?
I should just shut up and sing this song, pal.
Come on up, go, get to you, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Oh, but they're still suffering from the game yesterday
Well, you know something I feel great today, okay? The team didn't even show up yesterday
It's not even worth getting upset about it's one thing if you lose a heartbreaker like if you were a Dallas fan last night
Okay, and you had a three-dathed lead you had one other goal disallowed earlier in the game
You thought you had the game wrapped up and you give up three goals in a minute and a half and you lose an overtime
That's a reason to be upset
But when you didn't even show up for the game when you never had a chance from the start why even worry about it
They didn't show up they stunk
They look good until gretski score that goal in the middle. They never look good. They stunk the joint out
Well, I couldn't decide who sucked more javan asking your koarski yesterday. Yeah, that interference call
That listen, I can give you 80 bad calls
But the fact of it is if you don't show up you don't deserve to win anyway
That's true panther fans love pitching about the referees. Okay, the referees also at least they're consistent. They're all bad
Yeah, that's true. But as far as javan asking's concerned he belongs
He belongs into pica somewhere he belongs in a minor league sent him back to the Windsor Spitfires get him out of here
Bring back Joe Serella anything bring back Brian Benning. I'm out of material. Okay pal. I'm with you

All three lines of day in white open open line and Broward 767 i-463
It's Enrique or you you can't help both one of the other
Up to you
I prefer Enrique myself
Oh
Here's Key Largo on a mobile hello
Key Largo
Okay, sir
Removing the red line what on the ice and hockey toe open up the ice for the
No, they are not no, they are absolutely positively not
One of those big mouths on
Yes, he let me say it again. There is no chance. There is less than no chance
They're removing the red line the center line and it's not gonna happen
So what do you think about Lemieux crying about you know getting hurt and all that
You see the interview with him. Yes, I did
And what do you think about what he said? I think he's absolutely right
I think that the game anybody wants to play the game today if they have any health problems at all
Has got to be a massacre especially if they got the money. He's God
So and obviously it's from the way you said that it's obvious to me that you're a real knowledgeable hockey fan
Well, at least I'm trying not
Yeah, what do you think about Lemieux crying about getting hooked and speared and yanked down 85 times
You may have the fact that they can't play the game. What do you think about that? Another knowledgeable hockey fan here
It's out Florida baby. Give it a rest forget it. It ain't gonna happen
They could play here from now until the cows come home from now until foster you it starts doing the games again
And it's still ain't gonna happen
Here's a mobile in Miami Beach hello
I think what Mary was talking about it was a lot of the clutch and grabbing going on and all the time
Why would you dignify this guy and know exactly what he was talking about oh sure well, you know
Everybody doesn't have an opinion basically, but they're not very knowledgeable also with New Jersey bringing in the neutral
Don't trap it kind of cut down. He limited space on the ice and guys like yaga and Lemieux haven't been able to get the
The ice space I guess you can say yeah, and their complaints realistically are the complaints are absolutely correct
Because the great players can't play the game because there's holding and clutching and grabbing and hooking and stuff that isn't being called and
For example in our game yesterday there were guys being tackled there were takedowns
It was like a combination of a football game and a wrestling match
Koharski was just whistling on his very way and nothing was going on
I don't know if you saw Pittsburgh game the other day when Casparitis took down
Took down Joe Lotto with the puck nor here. I did not sorry
I'm being called which was never enough or anything now what the hell is clipping?
I thought they were gonna even 15 yards
I never saw clipping in a hockey
I've been watching for 40 years. Yeah 15 yards he walked it off and stood first down
But anyway, but I mean things like that it's like they have to cut down on those things cutting couple somebody at the knees
It's just unnecessary
There isn't too many guys that can run around and take the guys of auto size or lindraff and they're keep shot
And it's what's killing the league. I'm gonna tell you another thing that's killing the league is these damn Fox games
That game yesterday first they don't start until like three 15 you got to sit there and wait and wait and wait and put on his
Fony orchestrated bunch of bull crap till Fox gets good and ready 19 minutes instead of 15 in between the periods
Every every break every commercial break every interruption and play seems to last about three times as long as normal
So that Fox can take a two and a half to three hour game and make it into a three and a half to four hour project man
By the time you get through with any Fox game you're ready to pass out
Sir and so in his well these phones are all crap and out all these mobile phones
I think it's an act of the Lord if you ask me
I think we're being smitten right here on era of paysock baby. I thought paysock was this weekend
God I've been I've been just piling down the matsu do you believe that no
Two open lines and day at six two two W I O D and open line and Broward seven six seven
It's the same old song same old dance with the same old crowd here
Here's Margate hello. Yeah, sir. I watched the whole interview with Mario. I didn't see it here fall
I think everything said was very legitimate
This asshole had called me for anybody that knocks Mario Lemino's nothing about the game
Mario has got absolutely no reason to continue playing and I wish him all the luck in the world
He's the greatest guy that ever put on a jockstrap and this guy's just a dumb redneck who don't know hockey from his ass
I think they should do like most people in this town. He knows nothing about it. You're right when they would they don't
Whatever you say they have guys upstairs. I don't know something should be done about the officiating
Guys upstairs doing a calls. Okay. There's another excellent idea
Let's have the video replay guys call all the penalties. We can make it into a 10-hour game nice going pal
We have an open line and day at six two two W I O D. We have two and Broward seven six seven nine four six three
They wouldn't know a puck from this from the monster that we're eating today. That's what they know about it
Here's Evan Churron a mobile. Hello. Yeah, how you doing? No, okay. All right. Just thought
You might like to know a little trivia though. You probably know it because you know hockey
Koharski was the goat was the
Was the referee that the new jersey coach said have another donut your fat pig? Yeah, remember?
Do you remember when New Jersey went to the conference finals? Yeah, well the coach in New Jersey
I think was the guy who was a coach of Buffalo after that
He got thrown out and there was like a strike all the referees struck and they had to use minor league reps for the rest of the playoffs
Yeah, I'm just saying that was done Koharski
So if you have any
Problems with him officiating just remember from the source
Meaning what meaning he's an incompetent he was so I'd like you to tell me your referee in the national hockey league who is competent today sir
Well, there's some that are less competent than others. Maybe one. That's a good referee. That does a good game
Uh, I can't think of okay. We have an open line in day six two two nine four. They've all got a story baby
They all have a story here's a little trivia for you. Okay
To
Open lines and Broward seven six seven never has there been a town on the face of the universe anywhere in this entire universe of ours
I don't know this for a scientific fact, but I'm willing to bet a lot of somebody else's money on it, okay
Never has there been a place where so many people expanded so much
Verbiage about things about which they had less than no idea than this neck of the woods right here
This is the place you've come to with baby if you were looking for a place where people didn't know they're asked from their elbow
A grapefruit from Uranus and by the way, what that was all a grapefruit on the highway yesterday
Driving home from the hockey game and it looked like a bunch of uh, nose pickers or a grape pickers had lost their wares on i95 go in northbound
There was eight zillion grapefruit all over the side of the road
Not too bad either by the way
W-I-O-T
Hey, it just feels like a prick
Hey
Say boy, let me see your license there. What's the problem officer go a little fast. Why don't you say what's in the back seat?
Nothing crack rock
Sitting in his back seat. I said crack rock
You can sell on the street you can smoke it
And you'll catch a good buzz just don't get pulled over by the fuzz cake hop
Singing with a big band he's a gay cop
His nightstick in his hand he got busted
With three pounds of dope so bent over and thick of the soap
The party's over now at J-A-I-L
You got busted and it's J-A-I-L
I like it
You were once a big dog
Then you made the big switch and till you're just buff us bits of parties over now at J-A-I-L
You got busted and it's J-A-I-L
132 at W-I-O-T
He's no one watching in that did the FCC song you're the same tune remember that that was the best
It's in there somewhere by the way speaking of those carts. Let's set box up. Okay. Let's go to a mobile in West Palm Beach. Hello
Mobile in North Miami Beach. I mean whatever it is up there something with the beach. Yes, sir
Hey, I have a question for you. Yes, I'm aren't line judges allowed to make blatant calls in the NHL line judges
Someone told me that a line judge is allowed to make a call if you the ball. Sure. There are no such thing as a line judge
The line judges in football sir
The other the other referees that are in there. There's only one referee. There are two lines men
Lines men that's what I mean. There's the Wichita line's been
Yes, they are as a matter of fact the four-minute double minor on Billy Lindsay on a game on Thursday
The referee didn't he didn't see it
The lines been called it. Well all these other guys are calling about you know
The referees are not making the calls. Why don't the lines the these lines then go and make more calls
And we don't see it very often and they're obviously right in front of a lot of them
Wouldn't that solve a lot of the problems?
Yeah, that's well that would be great then we could like have that
Well, I want we get three or four more like somebody has suggested we have two referees. Why do we get ten officials out there?
Then the game could last 15 hours
Well, I mean if we're upset that they're not making the call
How to make the right calls you know, I say I say what they ought to do is be consistent at the beginning of the year
Get officials who know how to officiate and tell them how we're going to enforce the rules and just how we're going to open up the game
So it's something the fans can enjoy paying big bucks to see and then enforce it consistently all year long
That's the way to do it sir that's the answer for it
But since Brian Burke and Gary Bettman between the two of them have the brain a brain the size of a miniature pincher
I don't hold out too much hope
And the fact that people like our good friend Brian
Murray are telling us all the in the crease rule is great to protect the gold tenders
I got news for a brine the in the crease man in the crease rule is the worst thing that happened in a hundred years even don't
Share he knows that or is it even the or Rogers well something like that whatever he said with the
Alligator arms of that night
Alligator arms rumor manage just has a certain ring to it doesn't it?
Certainly I broke a brine or guitar man out there. It's a certainly an idea for another song
As he short arms it again in the restaurant can't reach that can't reach that check. I try like hell can't reach my wallet and can't reach that check
Here's the lady and Davy hello. Hello. Yes, ma'am. I was just calling to please beg you to stop playing in rege. Yeah
That was why is that trying to do why because it drives me up a wall and you entertain me so much when you're playing something other than in rege
Yeah, and so yeah, but it worked like magic man. I got a million calls on here now. We're like crazy. I got you to call
That's true, but everything's about hockey. No, it's not everything's about hockey. No, it is not okay. What do you want to talk about?
I don't really have anything to talk about other than please stop playing in rege. I'll be up front and say I've got no material whatsoever
Yeah, I'm just being why should you be any different? Yeah, I agree. I agree happy pace
So we talked about MOTSA and we talked about paysock we talked about Jews with beanies on her heads
We talked about Karen Kay and consultants
That's some Jewish holiday crap that I heard earlier
Yeah, that was the news guy that was that goi shakup this news guy was a good friend of Harry Wintergarten
No, the third or a program director who is Harry penis one who is this guy? I've just been out of town
And who is this guy some axe murderer
Okay, he's doing our news now. He is yeah, are you moving?
I figured they figured let's hire an axe murderer then if we we don't have any news to report
He'll go do some and make some what is it? Are you moving? I've heard that you are moving. Yes, rumors is true
This is true. Are you leaving radio?
Am I leaving radio? No, I'm getting back into radio. I'm going to WQM and getting back into radio
And without the assholes right good. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hey happy pass over and back to you. Okay. Happy paysock. Bye-bye
Open line of day quit playing at Enrique already. Well, yeah, it's killing her. What's what is wrong with everybody loves Enrique except George
And anybody else who likes music. Yeah, right. I got news for a mister
You better watch yourself
We have an open line in day six two two nine four six three six two two
W I O D you're starting to really really get out my nerves. You know what I'm saying?
You better watch yourself mister
Yeah, she comes in here see yeah, she goes through that whole wrap the first night about how she's sleeping with the boss
And the consultant is her boyfriend for five years, which I'm not so sure if that's true
But anyway, it's a good story
But the bottom line is now it's like she's big stuff
Now she's critiquing the rest of the station and what we talk about and does the station suck and what the hell is Neil talking about and
You know the board apps better watch themselves. Yeah, because she's got the inside track
Talk about just creating a hole so deep that all you got to do is take take a spyglass you can see a China on the other side already
Just keep digging and digging will bring an extra shovel sweetheart
Here's a lady in Miami. Hello
Hello, Neil. Yes, ma'am. I got to tell you my husband is the biggest ranger fan and he says we are all sore losers
And I know he's listening. He's right. He's right. No, he's right
I don't understand why I'm here. This town doesn't give a flying crap about anything
They get excited so long as the other team is winning the marlins the dolphins the the panthers the heat
They don't care about winter lose. They just don't care period
But I mean they are so phony man. It's it's frustrating as hell that's true
You got to stick with it. Okay. I grant you was a beautiful performance. It was terrible
But in the meantime, it's still one game of peace
We're still I think I got a good shot to win the series
And these people here are the biggest bunch of sarpa's assholes. I have ever seen in my life. They are they make me sick
I wanted to thank you for playing and reek a glacier. Well, thank God for you. What's wrong with Enrique? He's the best
He is as a matter of fact next to Louise
Every morning. I have to play him on the radio for my son. I'd like to play with him every morning
Believe me
Okay, see you. Well, she ran like hell on that note
Two open lines in day and six two two nine and then twice in the evening once in the morning and twice in the evening
Enrique don't get so about it
six two two w i o d and dayed is anybody awake and alive and alert out there
Okay, and that woman before says well, it's only been about hockey
See if you really listen to the show every day on this show we talk about at least a 50 a hundred things every day
There's a zillion things that come up like Francis gum
Where else could you you get a gum job like the one you got today from judy garland and she's dead
How do you like that? Francis gum?
Goyasha
Because somebody's trying to give us a song and a dance that lies a mannelli is jewish
Now judy garland was married about four hundred times and one of them may have been in juby
You know something it wouldn't make any difference anyway to listen to which mannelli wasn't the one who was jewish since it sounds real
Italian or to me okay. I know my dagos
It wouldn't make any difference because unless the mother is jewish
Can't be jewish okay? Are you following me? And if you believe in Jesus you also can't be jewish okay sweet heart
Oh she ain't listening over there. She's listening
And she said and she would nodded when I said that Jesus ate pork. She said I think you're right
North Miami Beach hello. Yeah, how you doing?
God doing happy pass-off and back to you sir
Is he's in Pesauk how about the Jewish hockey players? Yeah, Matthew stider really? Yes, sir
Toronto Maple Leafs
Is he kosher? He's kosher for Pesauk. Yes, he circumscribed
Yeah, that's good. That's a real matchable tonight, right and don't
Some wine. Okay, don't forget the wine. Okay, open line and date six two two nine four six three six two two
W.I.O.D. Try the wine. What was the song he was singing up in the bathtub? I'm singing in the rain
That's a song he was singing in clockwork orange. There's another great movie that probably most of you haven't seen
And if you haven't seen that movie you still don't know what life is all about. Okay. I
Love that I love the the sergeant there with a mustache. He was the best
He was the best
What was his name? I don't know what his name was in the movie. I don't either neither would anybody else
Okay, here's a Hollywood on a mobile. Hello
What's up off the band wagon
Yeah, yeah, go right range here as I told you I told you it's all what you pay for
Meaning what you had all those marquee players although they did keep Brian leach and check. Yeah, okay
Also in other words now you're singing a big song because they won a game. No, it's not a matter. We won a game
We beat you just like you beat us the first game. Yes, so it's even so what so what do you get all excited about with those marquee players
Let me ask you something about last year when they got yari curry and marty Mcsorley at the end of the year who also were older than dirt
They really worked out good didn't it? Well, that's all because they need a little bit of size a little bit of top
No, it's you know, it's because they don't know what they're doing
It's because Neil Smith is an asshole and keeps getting guys who are older than Johnny Bauer
Okay, which doesn't get the job done the Rangers are old baby and you're going down you're going down
See on the one guy that's still I mean
Granted we played one of the worst games you could imagine yesterday
But I'm not gonna sit here like and throw in the towel like a lot of you pussies out there
Well, you play by the way speaking up pussies. What the hell is this with bsr?
Yesterday we're on a power play and the puck comes to the side of the net and he covers
We're down at that point like one nothing two nothing whatever it is
He covers the puck at the side of the he does that more than any other goal tender and league
Except for Felix Poffan this last year because Felix didn't trust his defense with 38 or 40 shots of game and I don't blame him
You watch the way the other goalies and league play the puck you watch dominant a cashek
You watch Pat Roy there you watch the real great goal tenders in this game
And you'll see the way they play the puck instead of pushing out and freezing it every time anybody gets within 30 yards of the goal
I'm sorry when you're on the power play you don't freeze the puck so you have a face off in your own end bsr you pussy
Here's a mobile in Delray Beach hello
We love you panthers at least for a day
But if you lose the game please go away
Oh stewie why'd you have to go
Because without you we really blow
Yes, sir how are you great other than pretty depressing how the fans are bailing out on us huh?
Yeah, there's bad as the game was the fan reaction here is even worse
And then he's ranger fans just foaming it them up. I'm gonna let me say it for the 400th time today
They didn't play any great game yesterday. They were mediocre at best. I know it's pretty sad
You know, it's funny to have it all it transfers to all the other sports too, you know
Dolphins going on a little streak. They lose a few games everybody's ready to be too much
Half-fast phonies we got here man. Let's get some spirit
I've been trying for 21 years to inject a little enthusiasm in these people you can't do it if they don't have it
You can't do it. It's like making it's like making months of balls out of chicken crap
You can't do it exactly. You know what's that to and when a fat you know you're a true fan like
You're critical of the panthers and so forth and you hit these guys calling thinking just because you're being critical
That you're jumping off the band well. Yeah, their idea of being a real fan is just being a shield
That's all that then you want to know why is because they're not intelligent enough
They don't know enough about the game to discuss it intelligently. That's why right exactly
Even when we were winning for a period of time there we were sticking the joint out and god forbid you come on here and say that
And right away your attorney code you're a traitor. I know people they still understand
These people need to have a seminar to understand what the game is all about right
They don't understand that you can still be winning a game but not playing to you
I mean if you can't speak with a Canadian accent if you can't say a boot you haven't got a trineman's chance in hell and learning this game
Yeah, I will um hey Neil can I call somebody to do you back? Yes, sir
Leonard frank jabie you're all bunch of douchebags. Thank you. Okay pal whatever you said
Now that Edmonton Dallas game last night
Three nothing with three and a half or four minutes left in the game
Three nothing and the oilers come back a young team a fast team with Jason Arnard and with Doug wait
And I'm gonna say it again Brian Murray says back in the middle of November after he made that disgusting
He says I'd rather have Chris Wells than Doug wait any day of the week
And Doug wait is playing his brains out for those Edmonton oilers and Chris Wells is walking around in a zootsuit
As a healthy scratch. He scratches it every night
Can't stop it
The oilers
That was excitement baby that was emotion that was playoff coffee that was what it's all about
Not this turdburger stuff we saw yesterday
And our crowd, you know all we got to do is get down one other and the crowd is in a coma and
Did nothing for the team whatsoever in terms of that nothing zero zippity doda nothing
You're three people in the background. Let's go pan there like way off in the background
I mean while the right guys running around trying to you know get some attention
W-I-O-D when McDonald's in town she's not listening to us. We're not talking about women
Come on everybody. You looking man. We gonna play a game
All right, we be flipping Smith there
Any panic to be the name you know what you're talking about you take a bucket don't work
It must some skills to make it right

Like what's that one oh that guy?
Shaky what's his name shaky Schwartz whatever that coaches name shaky how you doing shaky well be a little shaky today
You used to like your pizza in the old days
Here's Miami hello
Neil yes, sir
I just have a little bit of advice for you. Why don't you get off the subject of hockey and watch a real sport
Which is what which is football or basketball?
Well guess what football ain't going on our last time I checked
I'm not talking about right now but football ain't going on right now
Well, how can you watch it now at an equal and on why don't you get a life?
Why don't you discover what life is really all about okay? You would know a sport if they jumped a hockey stick up your ass
Here's plantation hello
Hello, yes, sir. Hi Neil. How you doing you watch it any football these days?
I'm a ranger fan and a penguin fan excuse me. Yeah, I'm really enjoying to play off some from back east
I'm down here visiting and and I'm on a penguin fan and you're enjoying to play off?
Well, wait a minute now
First of all, I'm gonna be a ranger fan and a penguin fan. I'll get that well from from when they started
I'm a ranger fan from back into 50s. Yeah, I'm a penguin fan since they're inception in the league in 67 68 and they've been in different divisions
Part of the time, but I have a tough time when they play each other. Yeah, but
If the penguin flyers game on a radio tonight the penguins flyers game on a radio tell me why would it be on a radio?
Well, I thought maybe one of the stations down here was gonna pick it up. No, okay?
Because we're on staying they don't get a ESPN. So I don't have a SPN. Where's that on the doose?
And I'm doing a doose and I'm so well for that. Oh, but anyway, um, I'm talking about the rangers. I think they're underachieving
Um, I like a colon Campbell. He's already the coach. I don't agree with that. I think he blows well
He's so so but anyway, I think the real coach of the team is Mark Missy and Wayne Gretzky. Yeah, and just like Brett Holland
St. Louis and you know something you can't do that. You can't have the players coach in the team. They go down pal their going down
He put a finger right on it there
Just like when Gretzky was trying to run the team out there in LA and they finally said okay get out of here already
Try to do the same thing in St. Louis with his boyfriend Brett Hall. They said hey, I'll get out of here already
You can't have the players running the team. Okay, it doesn't work
Here's Hollywood. Hello, Daniel. Yes, sir. Happy pay fuck and back to you. Hey
That was brilliant. That was great man. How long do you work on that?

They're the same and every like the guy said before everything that goes on down here man
It's a fair weather. What are you done for me in the last five minutes every single thing that goes on exactly
You know, I need that you feel all of a sudden they lost yesterday against the ranger than all everybody's ready game

Who said he hated me speaks to me all every game he you know he's too face. He speaks to my face
What do I care it's a radio show who cares? No, no problem. He's so worth of about. He sucks
