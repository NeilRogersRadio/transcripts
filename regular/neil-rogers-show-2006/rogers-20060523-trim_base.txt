Tomorrow, we'll be funded at 8.30, General Manager of the heat.
We'll discuss Shaq and whatever happens tonight as they take on Detroit.
Big night in town.
Good news? Yes.
Could have fooled me. Well, you're not here.
And even if I were there, you think I would care about Shaq and the heat?
You would be in a distinct minority on that one.
Like I care about it, does this seem to be anew of other things?
It never bothered me before.
Like I'm supposed to care about Shaq and the heat because everybody in South Florida
get all of a sudden it's on a bandwagon.
Oh, this is so...
How were you about the Sabers, man? They played pretty crappy last night.
You're a distinct minority there.
Well, you know something? Who cares?
There ain't a soul in this town. Who cares about that?
The old lady's so clean-offs. Well, you know what? In that case, let's pull it.
And you know, I'm going to tell you, the panthers have got some stinking nerve.
You're a good racetrack buddy, Alan Cohen.
Yeah.
If you had any idea how much those...
Of course, I get reimbursed anyway, so I shouldn't bitch about it.
But, although I do have to pay tax on it.
And the fact of the matter is that there are tickets that used to be like five grand for two season tickets.
It's like over seven grand now.
My God. The bills don't stop coming, man.
I just sent another thing there to the accounting.
You know what they're doing?
You know what the heat's getting now for the parod tickets?
I can't even... well, you mean just for the playoffs?
No, for the regular season.
Oh, how much?
Like 19,000.
It's 260 dollars a ticket per game.
You know something, if they gave me 260 bucks a game, I wouldn't go there.
If I was there every single day of my life, I wouldn't go there.
If they gave me a thousand dollars a game, I wouldn't go.
How's that?
They're selling them out.
I'm happy to hear that.
And if they're selling them out, maybe some of the people this season,
because they're now deep into the playoffs, actually are watching the games.
As opposed to Schmussen and Wanderer and Wannup Stairs.
And then, you know, when they were boozing her hand?
I don't think that changes.
Oh, well...
Well, let's face it.
Who could have had 260 bucks a game?
Yeah, real fans can't afford that.
No, only plastic A-holes can afford that.
Yeah, people like me, I buy it here.
Well, like I said, you're a fan though.
Not.
But I buy the tickets, you know what?
You're just a gambler.
You're always told that you don't care about the...
That's right, I watched both games last night.
Yeah.
And won them both.
Well, I watched the Saber game.
I didn't win or lose, because I don't bet on sporting events.
But, you know, I buy tickets.
The only compulsive gambler has been on sporting events.
I might take it because I get, you know, pre-quest form.
Yeah, personally, I'm very much against gambling myself.
Me too.
At a March 12th, 30, I might, you know, take a break from that for a few hours.
I'm going to do that tomorrow too.
9,342 last night.
Or 460, too, I'm sorry, I get it right.
Probably a couple thousand cup fans, I would think.
They had 9,000 at the game last night.
That's what it said in the box score, 9,462.
I check those numbers every day for the home games to see, you know,
how many they're claiming show up.
You know what, if I can count them personally, I don't think that it's set the ground.
Right, I don't think you can count that high.
Now, probably about 4,000.
And including at least a thousand cup fans, I would think.
What a cup's a really pathetic.
9,000.
So, the Marlins won a game last night.
They got one in a row, man, and we got their game tonight.
And then we got the big game tomorrow, 12,30,
and if I do not reign before then, I know it's going to reign every day at some point.
There'll be a big crowd there tomorrow afternoon.
Oh, yeah, I will be surprised to maybe 30.
I don't mean 30,000, I mean, like 30 people.
But 30, man.
Sunday, Shining Man, we finally broke the kind of winter slopp over there for a couple days.
Sunday and yesterday, we're not too toasty here.
I don't think we made the 50 yesterday.
Not too exciting.
But all of a sudden today is that we turn the corner, baby, up north.
We turn the corner, it's already.
It's already warmer now than it was all the essence.
Already 50, it's going to be 65 today and in the 70s for the next foreseeable future.
Hallelujah.
73 tomorrow, it sounds like a good day to go to Woodbuy.
Of course, it was 43.
It would be a good day.
It would be an even better day because it would be better.
I'll tell you one thing.
Would they keep it so cold in that place?
My God.
I think I should sue them.
Maybe that's why I can't get rid of this damn cold.
I am getting rid of it.
But boy, it's lingered on.
I think it's because of that place.
Have you ever been in a casino where it wasn't cold?
No, because they want to keep your ass awake.
Yeah.
The last thing they want you to do is get sleepy.
Yeah.
You know, wind or rather there.
And of course in Vegas, or in any place,
like in Niagara Falls, the same thing.
If you're staying in Fallsview in a hotel,
they don't want you to get tired and go up in the room
and take a nap for a couple hours because then to lose your money
that you could be plunging and losing.
No clocks.
And they keep you up.
No clocks.
They don't want you to know what time it is.
They want you to be alert and awake.
I'm surprised they don't like along with the free drinks.
Give you a doggy uppers there too.
If they could get away with that, they would do it.
So you tell me, July now, by the way, Barbara is still alive.
He's a chipper and doing okay right now.
Nine boards.
And he's still alive.
Yeah.
You see that x-ray with all those nails in there?
Whatever those things are.
What are those things?
Pins.
Oh pins, needles and pins, excuse me.
They look like nails.
Basically that's what they are.
Maybe it's a safety pin like the one that's spectacular
bit allegedly stepped on.
If I'd gave a knife and I talked about that,
I'd say about that stupid story that buddy dealt me
up to cover up for Ronnie Franklin.
For his stupid ride in the Belmont.
We thought they were going like four four longs,
half a mile.
Sorry, you tell me that Bernadini is definitely not
going to run in the Belmont because I don't.
I'm unlikely to write.
Well, he's a possibility, but they're right now.
They're not sure he is.
Because the list of names that you gave me except for Bob and Tom
or Bob and John, except for a couple of others,
we didn't even heard of any of those horses.
Well, the list is up to 12 possibilities,
but not all of them are going to run.
No, brother Derek's definitely not going to run.
He's his counterfeit.
He's $26.
Definitely, yeah.
Totally fun.
And now there's the trainer, sweet Northern St.
who cut his foot during the race at the preateness.
I don't think Tom Bet is going to sit on there,
but he's on the list.
Well, you know, that was a very doable exact and triple
there, if you like Bernardini.
Yeah, I don't know how you would have come up with
Steinbrenner's source.
No, no, I'm not an all.
Oh, hit the all, but hit the all.
What's wrong with that?
You take Bernardini and sweet Northern St.
Well, you would have had to have left out Barbara,
which a lot of people weren't going to do.
I already picked him third.
Well, you I don't think that anybody who hit that tri-fact
they just either played numbers or right, you know,
it's just you know, you're going to be more.
Really paid 26 bucks.
It's not like he was 30 to one.
He wasn't one of the rank.
He went off at 12 to one and, uh,
when I said he paid 26 bucks, he was the open at 16 to one.
In fact, I commented on our show all afternoon that the odds on him were,
we're dropping and he was the only one whose numbers were changing.
But, uh, which he was being played.
By the way, according to yesterday's New York Post,
a decision on Bernardini has been made yet.
Yeah.
So.
Well, I'm more whipped up about the heat myself.
I'm going to have to fly down, be there for that gang tonight.
Is it tonight?
Yeah, it's not here.
It's in Detroit.
You go to your old hometown.
Oh, I could probably get my cab guy to take me right across the QEW man.
For the 401, whatever the hell it is.
Hershey highway right over to Detroit.
I would go to Detroit again, man, if they paid me 10 grand to go.
And in fact, a friend of mine, uh, Queen's not a friend,
but a Queen's of Woodbuy.
I wonder if he'd be generous.
He went to the MGM in Detroit because he had business to do there.
Yeah.
A few weeks ago, three weeks ago, he said it was the biggest dump he's ever been in his life.
He couldn't believe what a crap house it was.
The MGM is, uh, well, there are two casinos in Detroit.
Once across the river, yeah, or across the lake, excuse me, on a Canadian side.
Across the lake, across the river.
Is it across the lake?
They'd tour at River.
Yeah.
And they'd ride down.
Okay.
It's on a Canadian side.
Yeah, it's in Windsor, right?
Yeah.
And then there's one in Detroit.
The MGM.
I didn't think it was MGM because I...
Well, across me, the MGM, maybe they have another one, but the MGM is the big one downtown.
And it is a toilet, according to my friend.
The one that I went to downtown is actually operated by, uh, people from who have the rampart casino in Las Vegas.
Yeah.
It's not MGM.
Well, there is an MGM in Detroit, okay?
I'll bet you $80 trillion in that right now.
Well, I'll...
I'll tell you how I know because my friend from Las Vegas, who's the marketing director for the company, Comtor Dinner There.
Oh, brother.
Okay.
Wait a minute.
MGM.
I'm Googling it right now.
Okay.
If it shows up there, you owe me $100 trillion?
Yes.
MGM Grand Detroit Casino.
Here it is.
Great food, exceptional service.
Here's their website.
So either it's a bogus website or you owe me $80 trillion.
Which where is it?
Oh, who the hell knows.
Let's see.
You want me to look that up too?
Uh, gaming, uh, players club, group tours, uh, where the city shines.
Oh, yeah, that city really shines.
It's too dark in that city that was shine.
Maybe the teeth, uh, dining entertainment.
It doesn't tell you where it is.
A bout, oh wait a minute, a bout us.
Oh geez, uh, not a bout us.
Still doesn't tell you where it is.
It says MGM Grand Detroit Casino is a winning company.
It shows these silly broads that some, she just hit the like three, three single bars, you know.
Just one 20 quarters or something.
You know, the one thing about women at Casino is, man, they just too many emotional hysterical women.
They hit like 500 bucks and they're streaking like they just want a million.
What's that all about?
They do the same thing at the craft table.
Do they?
Yeah.
What's your craft?
You always hear screaming at the craft table.
No, but guys will do that too at the craft table, but not shrieking.
Non-stop excitement.
And it just, it doesn't say where it is.
I'm not going to waste any more time with this, but entertainment.
Let's see, maybe poopy compo is there now.
Poopy compo.
Well, who else would be at the MGM and Detroit, huh?
And do we premise still alive?
Keeley Smith, I think, is, uh, she just died too.
Now, he's dead.
Well, anyway, there it is.
Don't go there.
That's my point to you is don't go.
I've been warned by a sudden.
Actually, I didn't play there.
I just went there for the free dinner.
Oh, well, in that case, it says excellent foods have go there and get fed for free.
I heard the one in Windsor is a lot nicer though, across the Detroit River, just over the Ambassador Bridge.
My room, my hotel room when I was there for the Super Bowl, faced that hotel.
Do you ever go to Windsor?
No, I didn't go over there.
As a matter of fact, it's a track that you thought you'd not have been for harness racing,
but if the Windsor Race Track, we can, you know, a simulcast, bet on thoroughbreds, whatever else you like.
They got a huge, it's as big as falls, you know, they got 3,000 slots in it, because you know,
but they don't have any other, I don't think they have the rest of the stuff.
They got a sports book.
And Windsor's got it, man.
They just had a murder in Windsor.
I think the first one in about five years, I'll whip up about that.
So they've named civilized Canadians again.
Not to be gone murder.
As opposed to Detroit, where they're real big on it.
Yeah, Detroit is, uh, these.
Speaking of murder.
Yes.
I don't, I just, I have a reach to point now where I just, um, we're not even going to try anymore.
How's that?
I'm coming on to your making announcement today.
We just, we're just, we're just give up, you know.
I, I don't know what these people are thinking about.
Have you ever seen anything like this?
I mean, I don't want to put you on a spot, are they having any discussions with you about anything that they're doing?
Or thinking about doing or.
No.
No.
Me either.
But what, what, what in God's name?
They're hiring a lot of sales people.
Oh yeah, they're having a lot of sales people.
Of course, we don't service the sales.
I got a, I got a replacement piece of copy for one of my accounts today from Troy, ball-headed, Troy Stratford.
And I, that's the same, he's pulling the chat, direct routine now.
He takes the same old copy that's been on there for two or three months.
And he asked somebody to retype it, word for word verbatim.
And it's supposed to be the new copy.
So we don't care about, you know, serving the public, the all listening audience.
I mean, that's obvious based on some of the people we're putting on a year.
And we certainly don't care about servicing the clients, but we're hiring a whole bunch of new sales people.
Welcome to the WQ and boiler room.
Yeah, that's what it is.
That's what it looks like back there.
As a matter of fact, no, pretty soon it's going to be empty back there.
All the phones are going to be connected to people in India.
We're outsourcing the jobs.
And might as well, because you know what the crew we got back there now.
Do you know that, I don't know if anybody told you, but the last Wednesday when did you show from,
Pemiko from Baltimore?
Yeah.
The new sales people, they rounded them up and they brought them in a satin studio to watch your show.
Yeah.
Yeah, I see you didn't know, did you?
No.
And of course the only problem being you weren't there.
So last Thursday, George was outside, keep that in mind.
So there's, you know, Josh Cortes is there and there's no, but I'm here.
And they wanted to do the same thing.
And I said, we'll pass.
They would have wanted to have a whole bunch of these new sales discs coming there and sit around and watch Josh Cortes looking into an empty studio.
Yeah, see?
And you're wondering what I'm talking about?
I don't get it, man.
These people are, it's like they open up Bellevue again.
They let them all out.
They're crazy people.
Yeah.
They sat around and they watched your show.
They watched your voice coming through a speaker from Baltimore.
And then they wanted to do the same thing the next day.
At least, at least when you were out, at least the beast was there and Reaper and Copen, you know, the Oranteuraj.
At least there were some people milling around.
What do you think they thought of Reaper?
You found it.
Does that answer the question?
They're still here.
Huh?
They're still here.
Who's still there?
Those sales people who came in.
Oh, yeah.
I wouldn't surprise me.
They're still there with their eyes glazed over.
Oh, my goodness.
Wouldn't shock me at all.
Yeah, they sat around and watched an empty studio so they could get a better idea of how to sell our shows.
That was the rationale du jour of why they were doing that.
Wow.
Now, they were working for a certified, the crazy people now.
I mean, these people are just, I still say they're on the payroll across the street.
They've got to be.
They have to be.
Don't you think?
Especially, Clarebel.
You know, that one's got to be on the payroll over there.
You know, his claim to fame is that back on January the 13th, he paid motor go away, you know, for a couple of months.
That's it.
That's been his big move so far.
Little did he know how irreplaceable Moas.
Little did he know that we could do worse than a one share in those two hours.
And we are doing worse.
When you look at that 0.5 in here, man, it's enough to bring a grown man to a week like a child.
Well, listen, have a great day.
It's Tuesday.
We're still getting that.
No wait for that.
Getting.
Unbelievable.
Yes.
Enjoy that game tonight now.
Yeah, I will.
Oh, yeah.
I'm going to be praying for the sabers, praying for my buddy, Lindy Ruff and the Buffalo Sabers and Rick Generette.
All right.
I'm going to say a brother form.
Okay, say a brother for all of us.
Oh, tomorrow you have a short day.
Yeah, like I said.
Yeah.
Love those marlins, baby.
They're on a roll now.
Maybe they'll bring in people into watch the crossover one day.
That'd be a good idea.
Or maybe they could bring them into watch the show when the marlin game is on.
Yeah, they can watch the marlins game.
Bring them in about one o'clock tomorrow sounds good to me.
One o'clock talk studio.
Right.
The marlins game.
Amen.
See you.
Aston, man, y'all know.
The music expressed on the previous programs are those of the host guests and
the music.
The music broadcast group.
It's staffed advertisers for agencies.
Oh, my god, your breasts are beautiful.
Hey, there we go.
Hey, y'all, my name is Grant.
And Eugene Thomas.
Grant DeBusch is nominee for this Supreme Court.
And you know, there's not some people that I did.
They think just all I smoked a little marijuana when I was in college.
And it wasn't that they were.
They enjoy.
Yeah, maybe the cigars I enjoy.
I know, remember.
They don't think I'm fit to be on this Supreme Court.
Yeah, I got it much.
Let's do this quick and get out of here.
I want to switch our straight.
When I stopped reviewing the law, I don't just review the law.
There we go.
I'll be talking.
And I'll talk it to the east.
And I'll talk it to the west.
And I'll talk it while I look up Saturday.
Oh, God, I'll be talking.
Let's go bird one, y'all.
Yeah, George is back from his illness from that bad of a bon water.
Yeah, that's what it was.
It's fine at bitching, Mark.
I'm going to go to the hospital.

Let's look at that award winning lineup.
We got Kimba Bo camp or again, they had two.
That means no.
One lap.
Thank the Lord.
Mad Dog had four, 630 got your marlins on deck.
Those red hot marlins, they kicked some cubby ass last night.
It's 705 and then 80K follows the Marlin game.
It's about 1035.

Yes, George W. I love you, Megatimes and just for fun.
Hey, President Bush, having a great time torturing Inferdals in Tehran with you are here.
Amadena Jodg greeting cards when you're care enough to send up very crazy.
CKW.
Gooooooo.
Hello, darkness smile, friend.
I think it's got a real possibility, man.
Got a ring to it.
792 votes on the poll today.
We got that 1000 licked again.
You'll be pleased to know even though you were out sick yesterday.
We got over 1,100 I think.
Almost 1200, didn't we, John?
I didn't help that one on the vote.
Yeah, we did you?
Yeah, which I normally never did.
You were out sick, you were actually paying attention to what the poll was.
I normally never do, but I thought I would catch up on small emails and just one thing led
to another.
Oh, like the email from Eric Brandon at Magic?
Yeah, that one.
I don't understand what that's all about.
I never met Eric Brandon.
I mean, you know, well, maybe he overslept me a little great train.
I don't want to meet him.
Unless he's coming up here, I'm not coming down there.
Maybe he'll buy me lunch.
Oh, and here's the best news.
You know why I'm in such a good mood?
Why are you in such a good mood?
It didn't dawn on me till last night.
I'm watching the sabre with a very weak performance, couldn't be by Carolina.
And it just dawned on me that guess who never called me over the weekend or yesterday
to invite me to buy the mammal.
Remember, I told you, friend, that he had called and bugged me when I was a Hitler
in Jettison.
Yeah, that's the one.
Thanks a lot, Rimmer.
Maybe he's finally starting to get the message.
Leave me alone, okay?
I'm tired of buying you and your whole gypsy family buying you meals all the time.
I'm sure Doug McClain is more than taking good care of all of you, so just leave me alone.
God.
I mean, you know, it's one thing if people want to like socialize and everybody picks
up their own tab or maybe once in a great while reciprocating by me or me, a lot that I
want to go out for meals, but, you know, something.
But this business of calling up, here's the look at this thing here.
This is nasty.
The facts you just sent me.
What's the big deal with Barbara or let the animal recuperate in peace?
How much money did you lose on the horse race?
None.
I don't bet on that stuff.
Are you ever at the hard rock?
No, I have not.
I've been a couple of times.
I'd like to invite you to game a poker at rock.
I don't go there.
I don't play poker and I'm not there anyway, whoever sent this idiotic facts.
What are you doing?
Huh?
Stuttering Gil.
Who doesn't stutter when he types?
I noticed.
Stuttering spelled with two D's.
Now, this is not stuttering Gil, because stuttering Gil knows how to spell stuttering,
okay?
I sure about that.
Positive.
We just got faxes from Stuttering Gil, uh, wicker to a golly spelled it correctly.
This is spelled with two D's.
Oh, but he's stuttering.
Even stuttering Gil's got a fake now, okay?
Yeah, I'm serious.
Oh, boy.
And today's pulled a bit from court TV.
I'm sure he means Nancy Grace.
Even though I'm a court TV.
I'm a court TV, huh?
Good phrase.
Oh, she's everywhere.
She's on court TV.
No, she's on, uh, headline news.
Trust me, Nancy Grace.
She's everywhere.
She's on your pop-up.
Toaster.
She's on your iPod.
She's everywhere.
Nancy Grace.
She's on your toilet paper.
That's not stuttering Gil, believe me.
I know stuttering Gil, and he knows how to spell stuttering.
This is just amazing.
Much of idiots.
And I was saying just yesterday, I twirled it this before the show.
800 more votes already.
That's pretty exciting.
Let's give him a run down the pool.
Other than George W. Bush, who would have won obviously with a zillion votes.
What person most makes you want to puke when you see them on TV?
Somebody just nauseous seeing them.
Pat Robertson.
You know what it is about him?
It makes you want to puke real bad.
I don't know everything.
That green.
You know what I got there?
That syrupy grin on his ugly pus.
You know, like he knows something, which he don't.
What we all know is crazy.
Pat Robertson 208.
Bill O'Reilly, a close second, 194.
He got, again, voters the worst person in the world by, wasn't him last night.
I agree.
Heath Oberman.
For more BS.
194.
Just a total compulsive BS artist.
Jesse Jackson 127, who inspired the pool and Greta C.
A lot of other people get want to puke when they see him.
And there's just something about the, I don't know.
He doesn't talk out of the corner of his mouth like Jean Critch ennused to.
He just, he talks out of, I don't know, his ass.
Sean Hannity's because of that 106.
Ricky Picki Sanchez out of sight, but never out of mind in South Florida.
67.
Always good for a lot of votes on a pool having to do with hate.
Tucker Carlson 20, Bono 18.
Very good choice.
Mary Cheney that self-hating dyke that sell out bitch 18.
Paula Abula 14.
Rosio Donal 7.
A late addition.
Chris Matthew 7.
Star Jones 5.
William Donahue of the Catholic League.
He got my vote.
Raving, Luda 5.
Just a crazy, with always gritting his teeth and like, I'm going to kill somebody.
I just, you know, if he could, now about this movie, he just, uh, for me, he'd be
torquemadot to you, uh, give him a chance.
That's correct.
Torchermata.
Uh, so you didn't watch the Saturday morning 10 o'clock George should be in sick last
night.
He forgot all about, uh, he's already out.
Illuminating the angels and demons.
So Saturday morning at 10, it'll be on again.
Speaking of the Tracey Modern.
I'm sure they were a little woman on either the church stuff they got rid of all of
them because they burn them at the stake.
They burned them alive.
Yeah, but they grew back, which was certainly the Christian thing to do.
Of course.
Uh, Nancy Grace is not only three.
I can't believe that.
That's, that's just, there's something wrong there.
Ron Reagan Jr.
Three and where I carry it on have any, I don't know why the hell she even got, why did
you get put on there?
I don't know.
I didn't do it.
Josh must have done that and that was, oh, what do you mean?
Well, who the hell put her on there?
No, I'm just joking.
It was me.
Well, why?
Because you got the back.
I was already getting one.
Well, I already put it on before you read that.
Uh, Jesus.
What is wrong with you, man?
And Josh wants to apologize to you people out there.
All 2,300 of you that read the stories on our website wants to apologize for not getting
one.
They'll 10 o'clock this morning when I discovered that he had tried.
He thought he had put them on her last night.
Hey, it was a good 9 feet.
It was 9.56.
And I said, are we going to cross over with Hank or whether we switch it over one?
It was 9.56.
Okay.
You know, you can mess with the old man all you want, but my mind is as sharp as a
mots of ball.
Okay.
So don't give me this crap about trying to play loose with the time.
Okay.
I know my time.
I don't know anything else, but I know my time is up.
Wait till you hear what the new anchor is going to be on ABC.
Oh, so before I get into that, what else are we going to do this damn break?
You know, I want to say this one thing about Chris Jones.
I want to take back what I told him last week about what a fine job he's doing.
He ain't doing any job because your salespeople not only is there no new copy.
I mean, it's thing that Troy Stratford pulled his morning, give me the same copy, retiped
with two words added to the SN that make no sense.
I mean, and then his feedback sheets.
Remember how many of those do you think I got?
Well, two, right.
More than one and less than three.
You see what I'm saying?
No, it's kind of like, well, we don't really care about that.
We don't care if the audience likes the garbage that we're putting on the early bad voices
and have no consistent programming.
We don't care about that.
And we don't care whether we just want that money.
We're just a money machine.
We're no longer a radio station in case you haven't noticed.
We're just a money machine, man.
We're a good machine.
And I would suggest maybe there's nothing wrong with being a money machine.
If you were, it really a good machine.
But there's a gator capture, aren't you excited about that?
No.
Better luck next time.
There's a poor gator in a big-ass cage.
Why don't they just leave them gators alone, huh?
Well, they keep coming at us.
Well, good.
Maybe there's a reason for that.
Maybe it's part of the Lord's plan.
This is new rocket.
Good.
This is 5.16 Q.A.
Damn.
I don't have a clue.
That's your opinion.
How the heck did Barry's muscles grow?
He was a shrimp deli when to bow call.
I hit home runs thanks to the juice.
It did the trick because I just feed the room.
Babe.
Happy you babe.
Yeah.
You beat the babe.
You beat me only away.
I beat you don't check my feet.
You beat me you cheating punk.
I beat you you big fat drug.
You and me are in different legs.
Well, in your day that's the way it would be.
You beat me with turning tracks.
Just don't give me no answer in.
I beat you babe.
You beat the babe.
Happy you babe.
Happy you.
Rick.
Sean.
And now that we're in H.D.
You're right.
This is music to the sound.
I'm here.
H.D.
Radio set.
Wow.
You were handier.
Speaking of anyone from the triple.
Oh, rock.
There he is.
There's the metaphor to B.K. and B.K. Thomas.
I like that.
I like the blues sweet version better.
I don't.
Anyway, here's some bad news.
ABC News is named Charles Gibson.
The unconscious, the terminally ponderous and very almost as boring as David Hartman.
ABC's had his long line of very, very blamed people.
Blanned.
I'd be honest with you.
I mean, they had lost a million viewers.
I was just watching this thing on CNN or hyperventilating.
How excited they are.
But Elizabeth Vargas was okay.
Then she had been able to go get pregnant.
In fact, the newscast was a lot better without Bob Woodward.
And I thought I wished him to get blown up in Iraq, but he did.
But she was okay.
When you're great, she was all right.
I know.
I was just hoping to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to

to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her children to get her to get their free....
I think it's a racial thing myself.
Cover him up.
Hey father, can you help me to hold on to boy?
I'm a cat like, can you really?
Can you do this for me?
I do.
I sure hope you are.
You're fair.
I'm a cat like, can you help me to hold on to boy?
I'm a cat like, can you help me to hold on to boy?
I'm a cat like, can you help me to hold on to boy?
I'm a cat like, can you help me to hold on to boy?
I'm a cat like, can you help me to hold on to boy?
I'm a cat like, can you help me to hold on to boy?
I'm a cat like, can you help me to hold on to boy?
I'm a cat like, can you help me to hold on to boy?
I do care about that.
That was a good move that they made.
Nobody wants to hear no do-op.
They made about like 16 guys from Brooklyn that want to hear do-op.
And they think that the whole world is into the do-op shop.
You know, nobody wanted to hear that crap.
That's one of the best moves they ever made is getting that swill off the ear.
You want to hear good oldies.
This is going to be the place for it.
And after all, wasn't that how Q&A became famous in a music station?
Huh?
Right?
In fact, it would be surprising to me if this song is one of the songs that took you
a lot of top-of-the-charts back in the days.
And I used to listen back in the day.
Huh?
They can build out a quarter ounce of sugar.
Not too much music, but a quarter ounce of sugar.
It's the art of it.
And you don't like art, do you, right?
That's right.
You did it.
And Gloria.
And me has cried.
And you're crying.
And you're crying.
And you're crying.
And you're crying.
And you're crying.
I'm trying to think it very seriously of making a big movie because the rights of these people here in this place
are just, uh, uh, seen a flum is starting up again here.
All since the end of the year, I guess they haven't had one frocky, man.
Like just the ta-
Right.
Uh, that's the front part of the ass end of a cold as the flam is it settles deep into your throat.
At least 16 civilians were killed by airstrikes led by American and Reled forces on a village near Kanda,
and Afghanistan.
You saw how they, uh, killed all those Taliban who were supposedly killed a long time ago.
But they been acting up bad again, the Taliban.
A U.S. military spokesman said a Taliban compound had been targeted,
but survivors from the village said civilian houses were bombed and did it.
16 civilians killed, including much of children too, by the way.
There were dead people everywhere said Zermina BB,
cradling her eight month old baby, BB with a baby.
She said 10 people were killed in her home, including three or four children, three or four, more or less.
One village, your said Taliban fighters had used the roof of his house to fire missiles at the U.S.
Uh, so a lot of those pennies bystanders have to get killed, you know.
They always get in the way.
Uh, more, more good flim today.
Let's see.
Here's one that says to your full Rami Rumsfeld.
Oh, yeah, he's scary.
Donald Rumsfeld, do you want to put him on there?
Yeah, absolutely.
Says he's been sending me to the bowl for 20 years, his lorry in Baltimore.
He says, PS, I think Barbaro is a fine horse, and I love animals, but I really feel badly injured,
and I really hope he pulls through.
But I think people around here have kind of lost touch, they're actually putting up signs that say,
God bless, we have to be able to shoot him on the news this morning.
God bless Barbaro, get well soon, Barbaro, be brave, Barbaro, and believe Barbaro,
I don't get it, Laurie says the horse can't read.
Well, maybe somebody can read it to them.
Yeah, surprise, Zolory.
It's the reason the horse.
Like I said yesterday, and I know that offend some people, horse lovers, there's nothing wrong with loving horses,
depending on what act you're, you know, but the fact of the matter is they're awfully incredibly dumb animals.
They are shockingly dumb.
Yes, they are.
No, I'm not worried about that.
Where's the ring with it?
They are.
They are more horses than you've seen, trust me.
Amazingly dumb.
But then again, let's just human exploiting horses, and we ought to start with your peated people and the animal lovers,
you know, about how inhumane all this stuff is.
Nobody cares about that. There's big money on the line, man.
Just ask ourselves a home brother.
Give us the epinones.
Now.
This is the Neorodger show.
What solid, this is your brain.
Dr.Dotolory.
Any questions?
Oh, say, can you see my coyotes fly fly across the border today?
As the Minutemen were shooting, trope and eyes in one car through the desert of my
life to the protest we must, but they just thought we were loathing.
And the farms were all there.
The fruit ways they were us there.
Give us the messy rights and we'll pay our fair share.
For they does not understand the English you say.
Give a break to humanity.
For we say another way.
Give us the messy rights and we'll pay our fair share.
Give us the messy rights and we'll pay our fair share.
That's when the farm would have been wonderful.
WQAM.
What's not to like man with HB no less?
Chris, I keep reading on FMQB and radio records that HD is going to be the hottest thing since Tomales.
As soon as a few people got a set, you know, just like those HDTV DVDs that are out this month, the Toshiba.
Right?
No matter if I can go and I mention that because I've got to go on and look for that today.
I don't know why because I don't want to see Batman Part 85 or whatever the hell is it?
There's only like about a half a dozen titles that have been released in HD DVDs.
So until there's a good selector, might hell even bother with it.
Other than you know just saying well I got one and I ate exactly.
You know, buy them as they come out.
There you go.
That's a good idea.
Just put me on the list and send me one.
By the way you should be watching a mail because that weird window is coming.
I will be watching the rear window.
Did you bring him a motown?
I did that.
I got it today.
Hot hands.
Did ya?
I'm a busy man.
I got some movies to watch.
And just speaking of that, I watched parts of that again yesterday.
That movie just sends me man.
Not to the bowl, but right to a heaven.
I just love that.
I just can't describe.
Thanks, Todd.
If you don't watch standing in the shadows of Motown, I knew people are such a bunch of lung heads.
They just don't know.
You know, these are the same people who are wasting their time watching that stupid John Pervolta movie.
What the hell is it?
Urban cowboy?
No.
The one with the mayonnaise in the French fries.
What the hell is that?
It's pulp fiction.
Yeah, pulp fiction.
Yeah, see I've got a mental block.
An intentional mental block.
God.
Talk about a movie for pseudo intellectuals.
That's it.
Speaking of A-holes, Madonna.
The Church of England has criticized Madonna's appearance on a cross to kick off her latest two-in-air law.
What?
She is all hype.
About 2% talent and 98% hype.
That's a good thing they're helping her out.
Yeah.
Why would someone with so much talent seem to feel the need to promote herself by offending so many people said the church in the statement?
And like you said, the church continues helping out people with marginal talent.
Marginal movies just like the Da Vinci code that make it a big stink and a big fuss.
And everybody says, oh, I better go see what the stink and the fuss is all about.
Madonna performed the ballad, lived to tell, while suspended from a giant mirrored cross on opening night.
David Muir of the evangelical lion secures the singer of blatant insensitivity.
Madonna, as you see, the only thing about the religions they don't understand.
In a free world, at least allegedly for a year, once upon a time, we can make fun of your religion.
We can mock it.
We can, you know, and they're probably pretty accurately.
Right.
All we want, and if you don't like it, the Imamah, too bad.
Okay?
That's what it means to be non-religious.
Right.
To have kind of a brain.
Madonna's use of Christian imagery is an abuse and it's dangerous, he said.
David Muir.
She should drop it from the tours to David Muir and people need to find their own means of expressing their disapproval.
A little veiled kind of a threat to us, a little liar, you know.
Don't subsidize this bitch, which I don't anyway.
Madonna's close person was not available for comment.
Not the first time she's upset the church in 1990, the book called for a boycott of the blind ambition tour,
in which she simulated masturbation during like a virgin.
The video for like a prayer also brought condemnation from the Vatican,
which claimed it was blasphemous to contain burning crosses and deprecate a black Jesus.
I mean, can anybody imagine a black Jesus?
How about a Mexican, a Jesus?
Huh?
How about a Jesus?
How about a 40?
The 51-day compressions were in Turkey, dropped in LA on Sunday,
were reached Britain in July, since the BBC News.
Madonna, getting everybody all whipped up again, more hype.
I gotta get rid of this flim in the worst possible way, or maybe in the best possible way.
Whichever way.
Just gotta get rid of the remnants of this thing.
I think the Sun shines.
I'm gonna help.
Huh?
Gargle with some drain-o.
I think the Sun shines, gonna like, Gargle isn't a rid of a flim.
Does it?
Well, it depends.
I don't know how you crap.
I have a duty, Mr. Clean, Mr. Reen.
People say it's both a gargle with like salt water, something, not a-
For what?
Give it a flim?
One, do you ever hear that?
Oh, all the time.
Yeah, Mr. Dr. Reen.
Mr. Respert, that's sick in this whole family, and even his dog has got the strip through.
Yeah, yeah.
Man in Gytus.
You could just hack for four hours, I could get it yesterday.
I really did.
Well, what am I gonna do about it?
You know, I didn't feel all that bad.
That's all I could do was just hack.
Like, oh, Jay.
Well, speak out of that bit that we opened the show with that token, Clarence token, Thomas.
The reason he was on my mind is because he's back in the news again.
Just how bad are things for President Bush, asking New York TV news in Monday's editions?
Pretty bad, I'd say, if Clarence Thomas is worried about him is what they said.
The other night at a Washington Book Party for the President's sister, Dorol Bush Koch,
the Supreme Court just described with his wife, Ginny, on the ticket roof of the Hay Adams Hotel,
overlooking the White House and made a beeline for the author.
We have to pray for your brother.
He's in real trouble.
token, Thomas told a wide eyed Koch, who's older brother is indeed suffering from near-catastrophic public opinion ratings.
He's a dottering fool.
Koch, who's been one of the first President Bush's, my father, my president, a personal account of life at George H. W. Bush,
politely thanked Thomas and kept this stiff upper lip.
Later I had a nice chat with a conservative Justice writes, who wrote this?
Whoever this is in the, I don't know, somebody from Ross Story didn't put his name on it.
Who's had little use for journalists since his 91 confirmation hearings in which Anita Hill accused him of inappropriate sexual advances
and Thomas accused the Senate Judiciary Committee of conducting a high-tech lynching.
Life is long, I said at one point.
That's right, Thomas.
Agreed. That's what you should say when somebody does something to you.
Life is long.
Ha-ha.
In other words, gonna get ya.
Pay back his big stuff like that.
Currents token, Thomas said.
A real black Nazi if ever there was one.
So I was saying yesterday about the calls, and it's probably good that you're back today.
Not just from the fact that you're not quite as sick as yesterday, but the fact that you know a little bit about the history.
Back on IOD, on our worst day, nah, well I wouldn't say that. I mean we had some days.
The other day that was the worst, I give up.
Was the day that Jerry Sullivan decided to come in and control him and stand there and watch the show and just wouldn't believe?
I don't remember that.
You weren't there that day?
I don't know.
Let me have proceeded you.
It might have.
I don't know.
All we had was basically the mad trumpeter.
Ah, not that they're not.
They're not that they're not that they're not.
I don't know. It wasn't the mad trumpeter.
It was the, yeah, it was the, it was the, yeah, that guy.
That sounded like Johnny Dark.
Doing a bad cousin Bruce imitation.
That's all we had that day.
He made a couple of other crimes.
I don't think it was there for that event.
And Jerry Sullivan who is the former PD who got demoted and a canned and the read the way they canned and was not by just saying you're fired.
They made him the overnight news guy whose job was from midnight till five in the morning to drive the IOD news car and go out and get news.
And that's a good story.
So he was a big fan of the show.
We decided to come in at the end.
I was still like post stroke.
I know you weren't there was after I had that stroke.
But I guess maybe Nick Lawrence was there.
Would have had to add a little aroma to the program.
And it was, he just wouldn't leave.
You know, and it was just one of those days it wasn't going to happen no matter what.
You know, they're just, it was hopeless.
And he just stood there and stood there and stood there.
And I thought, why are you doing this?
Are you some kind of a bastard, some kind of a relentless bastard?
It's bad enough that I'm happy to endure this, but you're standing there watching it.
But anyway, what is that cut to do with what I was saying?
On your way to saying that on other than that, on the worst days, we never ever encountered it.
From the very first day at two a.m.
It was like we were in a different world, you know?
Yeah.
And obviously we got some, you know, we still have a chunk of the same audience from before.
You know, chunks, yeah, that kind.
But we also have a chunk of a different color, like deep brown or deep purple.
And as a result, the calls, you know, during those seven months that I shut them off.
Now I wouldn't say I did that right.
It was kind of like practice, you know?
Because I read too much crap during that period of time.
And there was much to tune not only Newsy, but too serious.
Not enough fun and gain stuff.
But the color is, what the show has degenerated into on this radio station.
And the phone call part of it, it's a playground for Simpledons is what it is.
And we do have a small segment of people who think, oh, well, that's what the fun is now.
No, not really.
Because it would be one thing if it was a playground for like, you know, a thousand different Simpledons.
But it's a playground for like about a dozen different Simpledons.
And that's it, you know?
And for all the money that we're spending technically on the phone, on this great tele-host phone system, which is the worst in the world.
It's hardly even worth it.
You follow what I'm saying?
Oh, yeah.
I know you would agree with that.
Now, Josh, of course, would also agree very hastily if I said that maybe the solution would be for him to start screening the calls.
Yeah, it was probably that.
Oh, man, what an accurate prediction that was.
So, I'm, you know, I'm mulling in my mind.
And of course, we're coming up very soon to the summer recess, you know, with George is doing three days a week.
And of course, George is never going to stop taking a call because that means George will be playing music.
Because George is not going to be reading bedtime stories.
I don't know how to assure you that is not going to be happening.
I'll talk about them, but I'm not going to read them.
Well, I would be okay.
I do that.
You talk about them?
Sure.
I mentioned them.
And go to the website, read this.
Here's what it's about.
Go to the website and read this.
Or then I'm going to do that.
No, they're not.
And as a matter of fact, that's another component of the show because I'm taking a retooling the whole thing now because the management is just uninvolved.
Oh, Lloyd Benson died.
Who?
You know, he was best known for?
No.
Senator from Texas.
And he was the one that told Dan Quaylor in the debate, presidential debate in what you were that have been.
Oh, my God.
I knew Jack Kennedy.
Yeah, Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine.
You know, Jack Kennedy.
That was one of the great moments.
He was 85 and he just died.
Former US Senator and Secretary of Treasury.
Lloyd Benson is dead.
And more was asked blank because he was a good guy.
Even though he was from Texas.
Whoa.
Now that was a great moment in debating.
Absolutely.
You ever seen the tape of that?
Yes, I did.
Many times.
Yeah, it's funny.
I knew Jack Kennedy.
Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine.
And Senator, you know Jack Kennedy.
And Quail just stood there with like, eh.
Danny Quail.
