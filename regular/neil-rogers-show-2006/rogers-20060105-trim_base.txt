I have mine too.
That's a very nice call as a matter of fact.
Me too.
Yeah, cordial, very well.
Yes, me too.
Bye, Greg.
I was suspended.
One last time, not a suspended one.
I know, it was very cordial and you know what?
We've got four minutes.
You might have that chance.
You know what?
The guy took a care of me when all of a sudden done.
I have no complaint.
Well, I think that mostly for letting me be here in adding years to my life, which by
the way you'll be pleased to know my blood pressure is excellent 111 over 66.
I'm not going to die kind of.
They wish is of many of the OJ on provocateurs out there.
You know, you know, by the way, who's here?
I'm no Ariel Sharon.
Yes.
Eddie Kay.
I thought Eddie Kay was like, can't Dracula, you know, that Renfield goes and opens up the
Cass County Day because of the six of long he could never be there.
Yeah, exactly.
That is amazing.
Hey, I want to say a word and I know you've talked about him a little bit.
Chuck Zink.
Pass away.
What a shame.
What a good guy.
What a nice evening.
He and I played golf together frequently.
We were good friends for a long, long time and he had a good sense of humor.
Oh, yeah.
He was a lot of fun to be around and everybody knew him.
You know, I once was he was going up to New York for a muscular discofy association.
He was a national vice chairman and I was on the flight with him and everybody came
up and said hello to him.
This is a good truck.
You know, and he never minded that.
I don't think anybody didn't like Skipper Chuck.
Yep.
So anyway, they weren't thought on last night's a game, by the way.
It was an unbelievable game.
It was great.
Unbelievable.
I think Texas deserved a win and USC deserved to lose because USC really in the first half,
they could have put that game away.
Exactly.
They kept driving down the field and driving right down and then did some bonehead thing.
Exactly.
Like Reggie Bush with a super lateral.
I mean, give me a break.
I mean, you couldn't make a fourth and one.
Yeah, and not only that, and then he goes for it on fourth and two, which I thought Pete
Carol got our coach, which is why they lost the game there.
I thought so too that they were.
They were in at the end of the game.
Yeah.
Basically, what he was saying is, I don't want to give them back to ball because I don't
think we can stop them.
And instead of backing him up, maybe you inside their own 10-yard line, you know, it gives
him the ball almost a new fear like an 42-yard line.
And that was the end of that.
But I'll tell you that Vince Young, I've never seen anybody like him.
They just couldn't tackle him.
They couldn't, they just couldn't bring him down.
Yep.
He's great.
I've never seen anything like that.
I enjoyed it.
Even though that fourth down play, you knew he was going to get in there.
You just knew it.
Yep.
Yeah.
And everybody knew it, but Southern Cowell, who for some reason had everybody back in
the end, so I didn't protect their outside.
Exactly.
And that's where Carol, who's supposed to be at the back of the...
All I like to do is knock him out of bonds.
You know, just have anybody over on that side knock him out, but there was nobody near him.
All you have to do, you know what?
All they had to do to prepare for that game was to watch the way the pros play against
Michael Vick.
Yeah.
And they, and I'm surprised Carol didn't do that.
Well, he went out coached.
But it was still a phenomenal game.
Yes, it was.
Particularly if you had the over.
Here we go again.
What a degenerate.
By the way, one thing, the Minnesota Vikings, there three guys have been Dantaco Pepper,
Smooth and Brian McKinney, all charged with Mr. Meter.
Oh yeah, and they're running back, Mo Williams.
Mo?
There you go.
Oh, and I'm sure that Mo will be in this meeting today.
Yeah, I'm seeing him.
Not here yet.
Really?
Yeah.
What a shame.
I'll let you know.
Okay, let me know about Mo.
Yeah.
Mo, come back here.
I'll come back here.
I think this guy is going to be there.
Eddie Kay is here.
You just got dark glasses on and he can barely squint through them.
Yeah, I don't blame him.
And there's no reason today.
Not to be there during the daytime.
No, but I got a great that herald article about Gulfstream.
It was really amusing.
In fact, even I have been printed that out of high time to get to it.
You see it?
I have not seen that.
I've seen all these.
He old cockers there at Gulfstream.
It was pretty funny.
I worried it.
Anyway, I got a right.
In fact, one of the guys name was I think Irving Goldberg.
No relation.
Well, you never know.
Mo was in relative.
Different Alta Cocker.
Don't say that.
You might have a lot of money.
You never know.
Different Alta Cocker Goldberg.
Well, enjoy the meeting and give everybody a big kiss for me.
I will.
I'll just come.
Neil says A.
Until Greg, thanks for the man.
Or I'll say it since you're in Canada.
Neil says A.
Yeah.
Okay.
How's it going, A?
See ya.
Yeah, you too.
Bye.
Thanks, A.
I'm going to talk about it.
A.
A.
A.
A.

Q.
In goes under investigation now.
And hold that you must know.
And so the high and curtain must come down.
You have a headache, a ghost.
Go to your attendant.
He picked you all up right before your eyes.
I wonder how you react when you discover you eat me alive, Dean.
That's something else you're not told, Dan.
And trees and boar without a reason.
Poked and they brought some gold and they brought onto it.
Trainers and criminal liars who do things that they don't want you to know.
One day you wake up and see your dreamers go.
For the ultimate is pre-align show.
Let's get back to a group of group of.
A group of group of.
You're a group of.
A group of group of.
A group of no more Terry and her.
Yeah, what would really cost me to pour Rita if we didn't have the chicken and a group of.
And the cool miners.
No, she fat.
I was just seeing a picture of her.
Fat head.
So they have a worse scarves a lot of time trying to cover up the fact she's got that fat neck.
Keep your chin's up Rita.
Don't worry about those numbers.
She's disgusting.
She just nauseated.
And she can't speak.
But I don't know what a great.
I'll tell you who I really like.
And I should have mentioned it to the hump.
We didn't have time.
It's Keith Overman.
I'm liking him more and more.
He's got a good show.
All right.
Nobody watches MSNBC.
But of anybody they got on there, he's pretty good.
But of course, you don't even know who that is.
How much do Josh know who that is?
Because of the sports factor.
Right.
He was on sports.
Josh who picked Texas to win yesterday and we congratulate him on a magnificent pick.
But nevertheless, like I said, USC should have blown him out in the first half.
They just kept doing stupid things, man.
They just, the mismanaged and they deserve to lose.
Texas deserved to win.
And USC deserved to lose.
And that's the way it wants.
That is correct.
But that was a phenomenal game.
Awesome.
Oh, and what else?
Don't let me forget tomorrow because we'll have more time with the Humper.
Keith Jackson was so bad last night that I feel bad for him.
That's how bad he was.
Well, that's what happens when you call like two games a year.
Well, not only that, but when you get to be 100 years old, I mean,
there comes a point when you just hang it up and say, you know, I always like Keith Jackson.
He was fun.
And he had that drawl and a whole deal.
He was okay.
But he needed compass in a road map last night.
And evidently, the ABC couldn't afford one.
He had no idea what was going on.
No, he didn't.
You were just listening and you were saying, oh, nearly.
Yeah, exactly.
Oh, nearly.
He was not good.
But anyway, the game was great.
Even his horrendous performance couldn't have detracted from that.
Well, I don't want any track from your enjoyment of this great Thursday.
But five US soldiers were killed when a roadside bomb hit their vehicle while I'm patrolling Baghdad today.
And another two American soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb near Najaf.
So that's seven more today.
Police had earlier said that only two civilians were killed in the job, but come to find out two American soldiers as well.
Before we go to a skipper chuck, that's really sad.
Yeah, it is.
See what I tell you about the good people.
Although media isn't exactly young, but, you know, for him, it was young.
And the good people by your end course, that fat aerial sure on.
Have another cheeseburger area.
By the way, nobody told him it was trathed.
Not that he would care, I guess.
I guess you know, one of those people that's real careful about your Cuban area enterprises.
He didn't have that look about it.
I told him they actually gave the after we had the first stroke a couple of weeks ago.
They gave the rundown on what he had for dinner tonight before they weren't joking about hamburgers and lamb chops and beef kabab.
And a couple of other things that followed by two huge servings of chocolate cake.
Cake factory is right now.
Look at that.
I mean, when you're seven years old and you weigh 700 pounds, it shouldn't come as any separate.
And then they were joking about in between the two strokes about, oh, I was dying to be told to go on a diet.
He's going, ha ha ha, yeah, like that.
Yep, yep, yep.
We'll see him no more.
He's still alive though for anybody.
It's like glued to that aerial sure on.
Old fat Jew.
Oh, I shouldn't say that.
Oh, and I got a great story about a pizza thief.
That's what I wanted to do before I do a skipper chuck and the polls and all that stuff.
Nothing worse than a pizza thief, you know what?
Can we have a song by Gary Lewis and the playboys.
Everybody loves a clown, right?
Well, everybody hates a pizza thief.
Kansas City, Missouri.
A man apparently looking for free lunch was arrested for allegedly assaulting a pizza delivery man.
I can only think of two pizza thieves and one would go well, an alignal tape, right?
That's right.
Slimey Lionel.
And then of course, that other one.
Police say Virgil Dennis ordered three pies from Pizza Hut at lunchtime Tuesday and gave the address of a vacant apartment downstairs from his own.
When the driver arrived, the 30 say 22 year old Dennis pressed a knife against the delivery man's neck and demanded the pizzas.
The crime was rep...
You didn't want money, you just wanted the pie, that's all.
The crime was reported and police placed the number Dennis provided the pizza to an apartment two floors up from the one where the pies were delivered.
He was real clever.
When officers arrived, they said a young man and a woman opened the door holding a small girl who was eating a slice of pizza.
That was our first clue, said officer George Springer, who was almost as good as Shirely Combs.
Officers said they found Dennis hiding in a back room.
While police waited for an officer to be terminated, the delivery driver identifies the same and Dennis bolted from the apartment barefoot handcuffs still dangling on one wrist.
This guy jumps across about six different balconies, and he scales down the second floor of said officer Darren's snap.
After a brief struggle in the parking lot, police got him under control to drive or identify Dennis as the thief as the pizza thief.
Jackson County prosecutor Charles Dennis, with first degree robbery, armed criminal action, police returned the uneaten slices to Pizza Hut, which they probably put on their buffet later on.
I would imagine.
They returned the uneaten slices to Pizza Hut?
I mean, come on, crack your please, a little bit silly, a little bit.
Well, okay, let's do the pull result from yesterday and in poor skipper Chuck, we it's a really tragic.
Yep.
And Ariel Shirell, well that's more expected, I would think.
You know, when you wait like I said 2000 pounds and you're 77 years old and you can barely walk, that doesn't bowed well for a long help, whatever.
Here's our pull yesterday, we took 1377 votes and I sneak the other one in there last night when at least expected that.
I like doing that because when you come up with another pull and Eric gets it on real quick, why not?
Right.
Neo-Roges is very entertaining 509 out of 1377.
A voice of reason 296.
Absolutely.
A genius 155.
A fat old fag 147.
Absolutely.
God, 106.
A panic, 67.
Stale, 48.
Devices 16, the anti-Christ 15, boring and a bigot owning on a piece out of 1377.
Well, at least we're not boring on this show anyway, okay?
I don't think it's a fail, but even stale can be like tasty if you're really hungry.
Like crackers?
Right, like old amazement.
Slab, just slab a little butter on that thing and some salt and you'd be amazed at how when you're really desperate, down and out.
Your day is coming for that.
What, to be desperate?
No, yeah, I feel like they're done that.
That's what I mean, like tomorrow.
Skipper Chuck 80 dies following a stroke.
Boy, there is a guy, I mean, talk about local broadcasting legends.
Right.
How many local broadcasting legends would you say there have been in radio and TV?
I'd say Rick Shaw in South Florida.
Rick Shaw, okay.
Ralph Redneck, Skipper Chuck.
Right.
Bob Weaver.
Okay.
Robots on handbrake.
Does he qualify?
No, okay.
He wasn't there long enough.
All right.
It was good.
It was very good.
Probably the best news anchor we ever had, but not there long enough.
And now there, you're not going to be too many legends now because they're there like for about five minutes.
Oh, you'll never guess who was doing the news at noon one of the days I was there.
On Channel 4.
That could give you a little too.
Back when Puking Angel over there.
And I thought, hey, things are just as bad as ever.
Anyway, Chuck D Zink.
No, remember the remote we did the, we actually, yeah, I guess we did one there too.
But Rick and Sajuram do their remote from someplace.
Where was that in the Grover somewhere?
I don't know.
You were there.
I was.
And Skipper Chuck was one of the guests that I wasn't there.
And I was there.
And I guess I had done my show there and they were like doing the afternoon still at that point.
And Skipper Chuck was there.
And I was like giving a couple of raspers, you know, and he had a good sense of humor.
He was fun.
Didn't take himself too seriously.
But guys, nothing worse than somebody who takes himself too seriously.
Chuck D Zink, known to hundreds of thousands of South Florida baby boom kids at Skipper Chuck,
had wished his fans peace, love and happiness for the last time.
Zink, 80, has died at a vocal hospice following a stroke.
A lifelong entertainer Zink was best known for the, as the spirited host of the Popeye Playhouse,
morning children show on the old WTV, day for nearly a quarter of a century from 57 to 79.
At one point, the waiting list to be one of the 30 to 35 kids who got to enjoy the show live in the studio reached two years.
Waiting list of two years, even Alex Bennett didn't have that.
In 1972, an estimated 49% of they brought in Monroe County TVs regularly tuned into a 7A in broadcast.
That's almost half 49 share.
And a Miami hero, Trump, again, of you that year, Zink and two of you, in his success to his genuineness.
You're sure as heck never going to last in a kid business being anybody for yourself.
He told writer Robert Bonin, kids can spot a phony in mile away. I'm not telling you if you are.
I'm a guy who hopes these, I hope these kids like to look up to.
He said, I suppose a skipper Chuck, I can be sort of a hero to them. All we need and we all need a hero.
I've never tried to be a father image or a big brother. I just tried to be me.
Although rare was the day in Zink's life that he wasn't greeted by a dare skipper Chuck, children are not his only audience.
Zink spent 12 years as the announcer for the Jackie Gleason show. I never knew that.
Do you know that? Nope.
And hosted Miss Universe Pagins around the globe for CBS.
He also hosted 22 King Orange Parades, 24 local broadcasts of Labor Day telephones and several quiz shows and travel programs.
Even once tried to host the Orange Bull Parade on a radio.
After he was booted from the annual TV broadcast to make way for the younger talent, recalled his co-host at the time,
current WLRN Miami Hill radio news anchor, Rhonda Victor.
Good old Rhonda, I worked with Rhonda at a couple of stations. She's out at PRD.
There was an outcry from a lot of traditionalists who were unhappy to see Chuck Goason, Victor,
who twice as a child was among the pop-eye playhouse studio audience.
WKAT thinking he could capitalize decided Chuck and I could co-host at Orange Bull Parade on radio.
It wasn't the best executed plan ever, but we had a ball, she said.
List news to WJNA640AM, her Zink is a disc jockey of his daily lunch-bunch radio program,
featuring music of the 40s and 50s, which he hosted into last fall.
And in recent years he was a familiar TV pitchman for the cemetery fellows communities.
I felt bad about that, you know.
Well, you got to make a living, you know.
I know, but, you know, it's kind of like saying, well, I'm getting old so therefore all you old farts out there, I'm your hero now.
He was always brimming with new concepts to pursue, said, Dura's Bernhard to produce Zink's children's show in his later years,
and work him on many other rough projects.
Right up until the last time I saw him around Labor Day, he was playing three different shows that he wanted to do him.
I was putting them together for him Bernhard said.
Zink as an only child was born in South Bend, Indiana, grew up as a farm boy.
He spent five years in the Marines, served as sergeant in South Pacific during WW2 receiving a bronze star for bravery.
He later worked in a variety of radio jobs in Pennsylvania from this jockey to program director before making the jump to TV as a newscaster.
He came to Miami in 56, began working as a weatherman for WTBJ, the following year he was asked to write and host the kids program.
I stared down and thought of my last six months he said it went on for 23 years.
As Skipper Chuck employed occasional set pieces, but mostly he and his longtime sidekick Scrubby played by Richard Andrews, followed an ad-lib format.
Zink opened each show with a three finger way of another stand by with the song Peace Love and Happiness.
The live audience was filled with kids who sat in bleachers, cheered, played games, and chatted with Skipper Chuck scrubbing other shows characters.
Zink didn't claim to be broadcasting educational TV. I'm not an educator, I'm an entertainer, he once said.
He took a courageous moral stand in the 50s when he insisted that the N-Studio audiences for the pop-up playhouse no longer be racially segregated.
This was unprecedented for a 7 TV station in that day which earned Zink national praise.
It's early days Zink said the players had been playing either all black or all white studio audiences.
One day he heard the program's reservation taker asking a phone caller, are you colored?
Incredibly, you're the person never asked that question again.
The show went through pure hell making the policy stick Zink said. The show also went underwent two regional Emmy awards.
Zink and his wife Clarice never had children. A fact that Zink said gave him greater patience with kids than if he were his own.
Hey like that. Well miss him Skipper Chuck will.
I want to be a legend in South Florida. Right.
It was no dicky Farcle man, he had his moments.
This is Neil Rogers. This is by 162.8.
You idiot. Whoever told you that you could work with men, what's your hired for?
Is to help us. Does that seem clear to you? To help us? To help men who are going out there to try to earn a living?
You company man, you ferry.
Oh this is the one I wanted to play. Sorry my bad.
Oh no that's, you know have you ever done that? Have you been on the board?
How many times a day? No. Where's the one that I wanted to play? I think he goes like right here somewhere.
Is that it first I got to know I got to stop the other one first.
It was like this. Then again I could be one.
Goodbye from Koleon. You have your hat for going.
You must have lots of hope and hope to tell somebody that is not bad news.
If this time you're not still alive.
That's it. Come on. No surprise.
We're a good friend. Great big fashions.
A lot of strong love to men.
You lose millions of dollars to the penalty. They caught your parents.
With two times a bill, you're a perfect family bus.
I had another children to see me this way.
And as for some, it's too bad you could never turn by easy times.
And then the half a genome hasn't had a good role.
Since one day it won't work.
Six thousand dollars. You failed.
There's no better not to put an margin in that.
Goodbye Don Koleon.
Ramsa is good by Ariel Shurong.
I wouldn't surprise me if we had a good bicep or chuck coming up soon.
I could be wrong about that but I don't think so.
I figured Ariel Shurong had a good shape.
He weighs 848 pounds. He's getting the piano case ready.
I don't know what that means.
Is really a Prime Minister Ariel Shurong emerged from emergency brain surgery this morning after suffering a massive stroke as the national vigil over his life continued?
Doctors said his vital signs appeared normal but that his condition remained.
And this is not a good choice of words I don't think.
His condition remained grave.
Oh, oh.
Isn't that a bad word?
That is grave.
That should just be a poor or something.
Speaking of graves, they better get a bunch ready in Iraq because we got more bad news beside the seven more American soldiers who are dead.
Not that we're counting by the way.
It's for a very good cause.
Two suicide bombers killed at least 110 people.
And what, see, this is about the fourth time I printed this story out this morning.
But they were just going up and up and up and up.
First it was 80 and then it was 92 and not 110 and wounded more than 200 more.
In the Iraqi cities of Carbola and Ramadi today, the second consecutive they have conserved it in surging attacks.
The insurgency is waning though.
Don't forget your vice president Dick told us that several of my body are going out.
It's waning.
I get it.
It's waning men.
Another three bombs exploded in Baghdad, two of them detonated by suicide bombers.
And the roadside bomb targeted the U.S. combo and the holy city of Najaf is throwing a humvee and killing at least two civilians there.
Coming at day after 58 other people died in a wave of bombings and shootings.
The latest bloodshed appeared certain to ratchet up tension between the Sunnis and the Shiites.
And meanwhile the Kurds are busy, hooking up at long tube to the oil pipeline.
But nevertheless.
And also in Afghanistan, see if we would have concentrated on doing like one job and got it done right which we never do.
Like the Taliban?
They were done in Taliban.
I don't think about it, Sharma.
Suspected Taliban militants have beheaded a headmaster in a central Afghan town, latest in a string of attacks on teachers and schools in the vulnerable region official city.
Yesterday, they be capitated body of Malim Abdul Habib was found on his home in Kalat town on Wednesday said, I'll leave Khalil.
But maybe it's just me, you know, their names just sound all the same to me.
I'm not sure.
The Samas were believed to have killed him late, Tuesday in front of his family after breaking into the house.
How beaver was the headmaster of the Sheikh, Mati Baba High School, which is really nice.
Well, that's right next to Ali Baba and all those thieves, which is attended by some 13 and Revoys and girls.
See, that's the Chequer and Woodpile is the girls.
They don't like that.
Zabul Provinces Education Director blamed the Taliban for the killing.
Only the Taliban are against girls being educated.
He said the Taliban often attack our teachers and beat them.
But this is the first time one's been killed in this province.
The insurgents in the past year vocationally put up posters around Kalat demanding that girls schools be closed-ended and threatening to kill teachers.
Don't be teaching on girls.
Okay, they're only good to have one or two things and learn and ate one of them.
They might have a point.
Yeah.
Oh, really?
Say the man with two daughters knows.
That's right.
Like I said.
And a wife, but nevertheless.
And I was held by game last night, too bad you're not into football.
Oh, yeah.
Josh will tell you all about it.
Look, he'll give you the yellow down during the break.
I'll give you the inside after the show.
Well, you won't have time to do these breaks today, um.
No.
Don't forget about that.
This is quite a testimony.
Now, what's my sandwich or the design vacation about the fact that there was no sales holes around?
What's my saying, Josh, that after the first of the year we'll have an empty log because they're not to do anything?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you said that.
And guess what?
We can't have a self-fulfill in prophecy.
Not that we care anymore.
And by the way, clearance, you're a slow learner.
Although he's not listening anyway.
He's in that big meeting with Greg who's saying goodbye.
And he called me to phone rang about four o'clock yesterday afternoon.
Nia, let's Greg read.
And I thought.
You know what?
I thought to myself when I heard Greg.
Yeah.
Because haven't I been saying that once Ray Perry left and Duff got the motor to sales hole,
that that was the definitive son that it was no longer going to be GM?
He's going to be a consultant for the company.
And he's going to have several other stations out in the west coast.
He's going to be consulting as well.
And anyway, no, we had a very cordial conversation and he was very complimentary and kissed my ass on both cheeks.
And even little in the middle too, was pretty embarrassing just to look.
He was very nice.
No hostility, no, you know, best of luck and have a great life.
You know, there's an interesting poll if the Sun sent those things because I could all like the guy to call him said that he was in Oakville.
Remember that yesterday the guy was in Ophil, Ontario.
Okay.
Give me a son of the answer about how crime is just as bad and Toronto and all of it.
And the high price of gas, which he's right about the gas.
But that would be like my coming to South Florida and going to Atlanta for a couple of days and then giving you a lecture about what they'd been brow or like all about.
And then it just Oakville, I mean Oakville, for example, like 40, 40, at least 40 miles from here.
It's like a little podon suburbotent in Yenem'sville to the middle of nowhere and this guy's an expert.
And then we had another fax which I didn't even bother with, the essence of it.
Well, everybody's coming in there pouring in a South Florida and you're like knocking it.
The Sun sent them took a really interesting poll. They got a 6,560 responses last time I had checked it.
The cost of living is soaring in South Florida.
Real estate insurance, gas, utilities, property tax bills, even our restaurants are now among the costless in the US.
Have you considered moving?
Have you considered moving?
60,568 votes, 21.1% say no, South Florida is home.
7% say no, every place else I would live is just as expensive.
41.1% say yes, I've thought about it but a move would be too complicated at the moment.
And 30.8% say yes, I'm actively looking to move.
So you add those last two categories, you've got 72%.
Who are either dying to get out or like already in the planning.
So the fact that a lot of other suckers, I mean a lot of other folks are coming down and you know, hopping up the properties and so on.
And thinking that they're going to have fun in the Sun and that's it paradise.
Well, you know, we'll see how long they last.
By the way, expensive wouldn't be so bad if it was worth it.
Right. Right, like here, it's not cheap living here at all.
By far from it.
Man, if you had an idea what I'm paying for right here, you'd fall off the chair right there.
And the price of, oh, there are no bargains here, man, especially now that the Canadian dollarism moved back up there like 87%.
When I came here, it was like 62 cents against American house 87.
That's a quarter on every dollar that I've lost in last whatever four years would have.
What it is, what it be.
So it's not cheap, but again, it's worth paying if you're getting something in return.
It's like West Europe is certainly not cheap any of those countries there.
My goodness.
Costs a multilay, multicadro, but nevertheless it's worth it to a lot of people.
And of course our audience thinks, oh gee, no, you're wrong.
You know, everybody wants to come to South Florida.
So they'll be passing most of you folks as you run away out.
They'll be just way of, hey, good luck to you.
You'll need it.
How about today's poll?
What do you think?
About what?
Our goal is a thousand votes today.
And since I put it on here about seven o'clock last night, we already got seven ninety.
Seven ninety.
Oh, you see the symbolism there?
Seven ninety.
I think Joel Feinberg fixed that.
The most overdone news story of the past year is the missing chick in Aruba 272.
Terry and her...
Chew!
Cuba!
205.
Pretty good second place.
They're running away bride, 145.
Michael Jackson, 1268.
Four Lunderdale kid goes to Iraq 39.
Rosa Parks dies 16.
Hurricane Katrina 16.
The war in Iraq 12.
Nunezzi Pope 7.
Kulminer 7.
I mean, that's just ridiculous.
There are only seven people who think that's the most overdone story of the last year.
Wow.
It's just...
You're still hockin' away on a manor.
I just have sex like a sickness.
When they're looking at his ear from now and they're still hockin' about it, then it'll be a contender.
Oh, and they will be.
Supreme Court nominations five.
Republican scandals three.
Hurricane Wilma II.
The Iraq elections two.
And none for the London bombings in the...
Chew!
And zero for the Asian earthquake.
7.99, which is just fine if you ask me.
Let's look at that award winning line up for Thursday.
Moe Howard, David, did the...
Two.
Mad dogs got three solid hours tonight.
Why sure?
Hope he's in training.
Four to seven.
Now, is everybody in the meeting?
Did all those people show up at work at other times?
Is that just...
How do we know?
We have no winders?
Well, I mean, you ought to get some scuttled, but...
Scuttled over there and looking to the...
Hurricane hotline at Bernie Kuzars at seven.
I'm sure they'll be talking about the fired coaches and about that tremendous performance in the Chick-fil-A Pete's Bull.
The beast had Bernie's at nine o'clock and then 80K at 10 o'clock tonight.
Long day for the K-man.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 516-Q-A-A.
Here's plate those retreats.
She has got militant.
She has put out a veil and slapped on some explosives and is looking for someplace to detonate it.
But tell toys, if it loses to you, G-Hod Barbie.
G-Hod Barbie comes with her old toyota pickup truck,
which she is not allowed to be driving,
several traditional buskets and the plans to blow up an embassy or art-doored market.
You ought to make it the choice.
G-Hod Barbie comes completely detonating device they may or may not work, just like that real one.
So get G-Hod Barbie today and start planning your own G-Hod.
G-Hod Barbie.
I'll insale it all, bagged that toy store is now.
Just in time for the infidel holiday season.
What does it say about a place when 72% of the people want out?
What does that tell you that might not be a great place to live?
Not good, nice to good.
Okay, let's get a lot of calls in here today for crying out loud.
Skipper Chuck dies and you think he soans and be lit up like a Christmas tree, like a Hanukkah bush, wouldn't you?
What we talked about on Monday and Tuesday.
You did?
I did.
Well, why is that?
Somebody facts then during the previous week that you had a stroke, we mentioned that.
We talked about it and it did a change reaction.
Think people were calling up saying, hey, I was on the show and it was really cool.
Right.
I got to make sure, Daddy.
They gave those to the kids.
Oh, I see.
I'll make sure, Daddy.
I thought maybe we were making like a statement.
No.
567-0560.
Tom 560, the Verizon and the Singular Rouser Center, maybe just a wish list for the new year.
I'm not sure what that was.
Dominic QYM, hello.
Hey, Neil, good morning.
Yes, sir.
You were talking about Keith Overman.
I'm pretty much the only one that watches that show also, I guess.
You and me, we're the two.
That's a pretty good show.
And now about Keith Jackson last night, pretty much hilarious.
This is a quote.
The stadium is full of Texas orange and also USC, silent pause.
He didn't know what colors USC was.
Yeah, well, there was a trivia question they had in late in the end of the game.
And it was about what USC player, what was the question?
I think you want the question was, but it's one of the MVP, the Rose Bowl MVP,
more than two times or more.
It wasn't USC player, but it was that was the question.
Yeah, he was just out of the game.
And he left the two times, he left the two times part of it out.
He didn't read the whole thing.
He was in coherent man.
He was a perishing.
Love you, Neil.
Thanks.
Put him out to pasture, okay?
And again, this is not a guy I ever dislike.
I always thought he was fine.
I'll enjoy him.
But you know, it comes in time.
He gets to be 110.
It's time to say, bye-bye.
God.
I wonder when Barry Jackass is going to get around to analyzing that,
ripping him the big fat ass that he deserves, Barry.
70 QYM, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I heard you talking about Miami.
I thought I'd throw my two cents at you.
Yeah.
I was born here and raised in Yidd Lock.
And I do my work here, started my business here.
Oh, I see.
Yeah, the city drives me nuts.
With the traffic and the crazy people from everywhere,
I think an hour to get around.
And customer service just doesn't exist.
No responsibility and no accountability.
But I don't know what family's here.
And it's beautiful.
And I like the weather.
I don't know if I want to go freeze my ass off up there next to you.
Yeah.
Well, it's not everything.
Yesterday it was like 41 and 30, to me.
It's just not that bad.
Not that extreme.
No, I didn't see why nobody wants to live in Buffalo
or Detroit or places like that.
But not just because of the weather.
Right.
Exactly.
Now, like I love to use that line that he used to say
that nothing wrong with Miami, that a complete people transplant
couldn't take care of.
That's right.
There's nothing wrong with the area.
I mean, it's a beautiful place.
But he just got the wrong people there.
Right.
Love you, Neil.
Good luck, pal.
He hang in there.
All right.
Somebody has to.
Oh, Neil, you're wrong, man.
People are just dying.
They're flooding in here to Sanofuode.
Yeah, too many of them.
Too many of the wrong people, see?
If they're being replaced by the right people,
that would be a different story.
We should have auditions.
Like those people who are full of water,
they'll airport on Monday.
Who were they?
I just got kicked thinking to myself,
who are these people?
I mean, these aren't.
This here isn't my audience.
And these aren't people that I've ever met or they just,
I don't know.
Maybe the same people at the mall last time I was there.
Oh, well, how about the sawgrass?
Who are those people?
I don't know.
You're walking in my sawgrass.
And it's like a, like the United Nations of walking
over in Aventura.
And it's just, that's the flush fest.
That's the most you can do.
Yeah.
A flush fest?
Telling you.
Well, now we're talking in my language.
That's like going to Fallsview Casino, man.
Just sit there and let your tongue or lick the tops of your shoes.
Or whatever it can lick.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Get your licks on root 66.
Remember that show with George Maharest or whoever the hell it was?
No.
Hey, George.
You're fairy.
Maharest, I'll play the theme for you if you want.
Okay.
Come to QAM, hello.
Meal.
Yes, sir.
How you doing, buddy?
Great.
What about Phoenix Arizona?
What about it?
I'm moving there.
I'm getting the hell out of South Florida.
Oh, man.
Well, you know, South old enough to me.
What's that?
You know, South old enough to go to Arizona.
You know, you have to go to the age of 100.
I'm 30 and you know what?
One thing different about being out west and being out here.
Yeah.
People actually like it out there.
If you ask anybody, how do you like it, they say they love it.
But you have the normal person in South Florida.
How do you like the people here?
The only reaction is they suck.
Yeah, and that's true.
And if it's not for me, it's not good enough for me.
Okay.
Well, good luck, you apparently.
Watch out for those cacti.
5.6705.60.
I'm still waiting here.
Route 66.
I don't hear it.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were saying it.
No, I don't really want to hear it.
I was just joking about that.
I just thought you had to all cue that.
I can't even without.
Arizona to me is just too.
I shouldn't have said.
I almost took that job in you, Arizona, before I came to Miami.
You, ma.
Ever win the you, ma?
No, I haven't.
Don't.
The only good thing about you, ma, is it's close to California.
Then it's, I guess, not all that far from Vegas.
But, boy, what a just, I don't know.
I mean, it's very scenic, like, driving to New Mexico and Arizona.
Very scenic.
Beautiful to look at.
But then, I'm sorry.
I don't know.
Look at what the compounds are.
The ones that are still standing, things like that.
5.6705.
And, like I said yesterday, I'm not here to pedal any place.
I'm not for the Chamber of Commerce.
Do not come to Toronto.
You'll hate it like poison.
Do not go to Rochester.
It's Cobbs Hill and Naranda Coyton, whatever.
Go where you want to go.
You don't have a great life.
That guy with this story about Oakville.
I mean, I was in Bointin Beach for a couple of days.
And you're just don't know anything about it so far.
Right.
Oakville, my ass.
I mean, that is way down the road.
That's on the way to Niagara Falls.
Give me a break.
WDQYM.
Hello.
Morning, Neil.
Two things.
Skipper Chuck was the greatest thing ever happened at KIT TV.
And I'd love to see Grabs Flyers on a particular range and Crawl for Texas for my new year's wish.
Okay.
There you go.
That's guy with a short list.
WDQYM.
There's Route 66 for you.
I'm not really sure if that was the show that George Maharest was on.
I'm going to look at the line guy.
Huh?
Look at the line of.
I know he would know.
But you could also Google Route 66.
You just Google TV show Route 66 and I'll tell you who was on it.
I don't know if I can see.
Good team song.
No, I do like that team.
Sorry.
What about that?
It seems to me once upon a time I may have driven on Route 66.
I'm not really sure.
I do remember my drive across the Southern Tier on I-10.
Yeah.
I picked up that hitchhiker.
There's many years ago back when we used to pick up hitchhikers.
Remember those days?
Everybody said, you're probably not older.
I remember it used to be said to pick up hitchhikers.
Right.
And a hitchhiker.
In fact, his name was Chuck Ryan.
Yeah.
How many years ago that is?
Remember his name?
I remember a couple of things.
But anyway.
Yes.
Comedy.
White porer.
George Maharas is absolutely correct.
I didn't want to step on the end of that theme song.
George Maharas knew was the other guy.
It's like a lot of types of thing here.
Hello.
Daniel.
Yes, sir.
I have a question about the game last night.
Yes.
First of all, I'd like to ask George a question if I may.
Martin Milner.
That was Martin Milner.
George.
Collar.
Why do you continue to hate?
What are you talking about, goofball?
Continue to hate what?
Get out of here.
That's just another one the same idea.
That's toothless old fart.
Toothless old fart.
That's right.
Remember there was toothless old fart.
I hate that.
I'm going to continue to hate him until he dies.
He likes poison and hopes that you die real fast.
In fact, maybe we can do a swap.
We can bring Chuck back to life and you can take his spot.
This is the game.
You get a lot of pain.
Mark.
The heroizers of our sports hall radio WQ AMM.
And now the show that's the antidote to those liberal media distortions of our government.
It's the West Texas Wing.
Excuse me, Mr. President, but I...
Why are you here?
You wearing head foe, sir.
Oh, hey, Dick.
I'm monitoring some illegal wire taps.
Mr. President, don't we have people to do that?
Yes, but I have the really important call sit right here to the overlord.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hang on.
Something big is coming over.
Oh, what is it, sir?
Word of a terrorist attack?
No.
Brittany is taking Kevin out of the house again.
And he just set up a date with Lindsey Lohan.
Oh, that no.
Come back next time for a fair and balanced.
It's compassionally conservative view of our government in action.
Only on the West Texas Wing.
125 over 87.
Does that mean would you approval?
No, yeah.
I'm cool.
We ought to be ecstatic.
You ought to be jumping around and dancing up and then.
And that was after running the other room to get this thing too.
I would have if I would have sat for like four or five minutes.
If I would have sat through the end of that long commercial break before I took it.
Yeah.
Boy.
Now, what the hell is that thing, yawning?
Are you faxing me something now?
I did.
You ought to hear that yawning sound of my faxing behavior.
Certainly, but for her, it's his day.
It must be a commentary on the show so far.
The most overdone news story of the past year.
859 votes.
Our goal is 1,000.
See, I figured yesterday we went right down to the wire because we took it for granted.
Don't ever take South Florida people for granted.
You have to keep pushing him and pushing him.
So last night we got part of our new Head Start program.
Oh, yeah, I know about George Maharest.
This is an actual picture of him.
I can't really make out the whole thing.
You can make it out enough.
Is he like with somebody else in that picture?
Well, he's with a friend, but it's not somebody else.
What is it?
A blow up dog?
No, it's just his number there.
Oh, I can't see it until.
Oh, well, because of Oliver, he never did nothing for me.
George Maharest is gay.
You were right.
His actual picture of him says, right, well, why would I say it if it weren't true?
What, what do you want from him?
Tell me a little bit about your next governor is going to be gay.
Huh?
No, no, you don't lie about that anyway.
What?
Who have I ever said his gay is not?
Give me one.
Give me a name.
Tommy Cruz.
Give me one name.
Give me one name.
No, I was just laughing at the way you say it if it wasn't true.
I'm talking about that subject.
No, subject.
About that subject, no, never.
Well, there you go.
I mean, can you call anybody anything worse than gay?
I can't think of anything other than maybe a liar and cheat and scoundrel and republicans.
Heater thief?
Republicing, right?
Born again, fanatic and not religious, not all of these things.
All of these things.
But other than that.
Well, how about Jack Abramoff?
I realize that we got a zero-win on the coal mine disaster and about how the media screwed up real bad.
I do like Heath Overman.
I warmed up him very slowly because when he had his show previously at MSNBC, I thought he was a real A-hole.
And he still does some things that annoy me, like a little melodramatic for me.
But he's a very bright guy and he happens to be liberal, which I know is unacceptable these days.
And he riffs bush and asks every chance he gets.
And he has some interesting stuff on there.
Even Josh knows who that is.
He was very funny when he did sports.
Well, there you go.
And he's still very funny on MSNBC 8-9pm on whatever it is.
And they call that show Countdowns.
Is that the name of the show?
I have no idea.
Well, yeah, look.
Well, he was an actual sports center anchor.
Like he did.
I know that.
And he went from there, then he bumbled around a little bit and they wound up on MSNBC.
And he got all pissed off because they wouldn't let him say anything during the Monica business.
And was it the Monica thing or the OJ?
I forget what period of time it goes.
And he got that out of shape for them because they wouldn't let him say anything.
And then he finally surfaced on MSNBC.
Well, wait a minute.
What was the one I just said he was on?
He was on there when John Gibson was on there.
And then John Gibson decided that he was a full-fledged goose-stepping Nazi.
So he decided, oh, by the way, I got some good news.
Okay.
Me. Good news for me.
And good news for John Jiris.
Remember, he told me he was sending me chocolates.
Right?
Well, they're not going to get here.
They're not going to let you use the chocolate.
Oh, that's right.
They're not going to let you ship food across the border.
So, you're going to reserve John.
I mean, you know, I'm waiting for that good chocolate.
I could be good.
Why?
I could have eaten that chocolate.
Yeah, that's right.
Somebody there could be enjoying it.
Somebody who's not diabetic and not starving underprivileged family like me.
That's right.
So, God is punishing you, man, just like He's punishing Ariel Sharon for being a big fat and treating trache, man.
When He had those bacon cheeseburgers, that just put the Lord over the edge.
You couldn't handle it no more.
That was bad.
Poor Skipper Chuck.
You know, look at all the, in fact, I'm working on a poll about the all-time broadcasting legend in South Florida.
Look at all the people who are dead.
Oh, hell.
What?
You don't get out alive.
Ralph Redneck?
Mm-hmm.
Other youtubers are showing the news story of it.
Final goodbye to the man known.
Skipper Chuck.
Join us tonight for the...
Right.
There's scrubby Giffr up Chuck.
The only thing I only bone ever had to pick with him was when he kept leaving his teeth in the ground.
And he left his teeth in the ground.
And he left his teeth in the ground.
And he left his teeth in the ground.
And he left his teeth in the ground.
And he left his teeth in the ground.
And he left his teeth in the ground.
And he left his teeth in the ground.
And he left his teeth in the ground.
And you talk about a real bunch of big spenders.
So yesterday we had another near stroke experience with the certain people getting me crazy before the show.
Which parents came in again this morning and stopped doing that clearance, just go away.
I love his line this morning.
Whatever happened to us.
Isn't that a great line?
I hate this one.
He and I had a great relationship.
I have no problem with him personally.
But business.
I mean, coolest.
That's cool.
I didn't tell you until now, but we taste Troy away this morning.
You know how you told me you wanted to thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah, refuse to turn the microphone on and we've got a pointy stick and drug mononon.
Good.
Good.
And I hope you have scared him with it.
At any rate, so the deal is the beesleys are going to put the seed money for the best
of the 30th anniversary March year winner.
And what is that going to start?
Or don't we know yet?
February?
We don't know yet, but still.
But anyway, we're coming out with a CD.
And of course, the first day it's out, people will be like, it'll be on the internet
and you can download it for free, you can steal it and then burn copies of it.
They do it all the time, which is one of the reasons we stopped doing the CDs.
It went primarily to make a nose keychains, which went over very big.
I was told that we actually had more of a surplus left over keychains than CDs.
Yeah, but you want to know why?
That wasn't true with the mad dog keychains.
They went like hot cakes.
They went like Halifan Manhattan.
We got left over both of them running around.
What the one with your buddy?
They got those jacket pants.
That one, who do I want to that?
Although I will say that for him, both times, we raised money for a band and pair rescue.
We had the Mow bits and we had the keychain.
We went and asked him if it was okay with him.
Not that we needed to do that because it's station material that we put on there.
But nevertheless, he was cool with it.
And he said, you know, it's for a good cause.
And he also said,
That was that on there.
By the way, I don't think that's on there.
I think that's keychain.
That was keychain.
Keychain preceded the days.
So we'll say we'll do the best we can, but anyway, the bees these are putting up the 10 grand seed money.
But then of course, they're going to take it back out of the proceeds.
That's the point I was making.
If they really had any kind of generosity or any appreciation for what I've done these eight years,
they'd say, oh, no sweat.
We'll write the check, no problem at all.
And we want all the proceeds to go to the charity and there were Taisaloud, you know, or Kiss My Ass,
which is what Greg did for 20 minutes yesterday.
I had Asperin.
I think it was Bayer.
I had Asperin right after that call.
I couldn't believe it.
Meeting's over by the way.
Very nice.
Huh? The meeting's over by the way.
And so what's the lowdown?
We got a spy report?
Well, I got that a Mow was not in the meeting.
Neither was the mad dog.
Well, they probably got a phone call.
Because Hank said he got a phone call.
Do you want the lowdown?
Yes.
Our new general manager.
Joe Bell.
What a good guess.
Joe Bell probably missed.
Because it's Roaches of Beesley Station.
Kiss, we love Joe Bell.
He's a great guy.
I don't know.
He was over here, but then Skidaddle back on over there because he's got a shuttle back and forth for a while.
Right.
And.
And that's it.
It's yet to be determined who's going to be moving where?
Now, do we get our fart sounds back?
Oh, no.
One step at a time, sweet Jesus.
No, seriously, do I?
I think Joe Bell has a guy with a little, you know, he's coming in a different position than a Greg was.
Maybe the, yeah.
Well, we know a position.
Greg was in.
It's true.
And told me.
But anyway, so we got Joe Bell as our new general manager.
That didn't take very long.
It's only the fifth of January.

I'm going to try to think of like any major development.
It was alright.
I had its moments.
Not spectacular.
And certainly that will-mouth thing.
Without will-mouth, it would have been fine.
You know?
The whole will-mouth kind of like screwed up everybody's life.
Yes it did.
So you're wondering if I is-
You need out of a heart attack.
You think?
Is he going to be calling in?
I sure hope he finished his job.
Because you already got paid for it.

70 Q.A.M. Hello. Q.A.M. Yes sir.
Super Truck was a great guy. I used to play golf out of Century Goers. I used to see him out there all gone. Right.
And do you remember the days when North Miami knew all your neighbors in every direction of your house? Yeah.
So it was happy to know you were glad to know him and to have died. I don't think even if we changed the people and come back to nice place,
we really have to wipe out half the houses and half the development on the beach. Well, I could come up one more hurricane season.
I just take care of that. You know, maybe this is God's way of creating a cleansing experience for the community, you think?
Because he does work in mysterious and evil ways and often painful ways. Maybe all these hurricanes are his way of like purging out the swill, the slush from the community.
I mean, sure Dan, you're worked in your house. But you do have your cable back though, right? Yes. Yes.
But it's just, put it on the man. It's just banging. Oh man. If you had a, and there's blood spurring out of my time right now, but it's so hard.
Careful. Those three days that I spent on their Friday, Saturday and Sunday this past weekend, that was a real fly opener. I'll tell you that right now.
I would just, oh, brother, there are so many things lacking. You know, just like, it's like a tenth rate life.
And if your whole life is based on the beach and the palm trees and the ocean and the sunshine, then you are in heaven.
Other than that, if it's anything beside that, you got problems. That's probably why 72% of the people want out.
Even I was shocked by that. Yeah. Now, aren't you, don't you think that's a little bit of a high number?
But I mean, it's like, so it's a pretty good sample. It's like 66 hundred votes of people that either are actively planning on getting out and working on our leaving or like wish they could. 72%.
And like, I wouldn't care if the electric was high for a good reason, but when you know that they're just getting raped and they've got 11 billion to buy another utility in the public service commission, gives them whatever they like.
And like when the voters vote on something and then the governor and the legislators do everything in their power to kill it and then water it down into stall and delay stuff like that.
It's just a hopeless place, man. It's a Yahoo place. It could be I've said this for years. It could be paradise, but it's not.
Like when you find something running down your chin, you know, you think it could be paradise, but it's not.
One for what there's another former defense secretary Frank Carlucci. There's a real like gangster for it. There's a bad guy.
Kuchi Kuchi. Look out for Frank Carlucci. Always been nervous about guys whose last name's in CCI, you know, like Mary Uchi.

Bye-bye.

Plenty after love at a Q&A.
Now let me ask you, we got a new one, General Manager.
Now Greg Reed is a set fare while he's moving on to a bigger one,
other things, other things, and Joe Bell's new manager.
Now who's the new sales manager?
I don't think there's been a change there.
A bigger pardon?
Do we have a bad connection?
Hello?
I've heard anything about that.
Once powerful lobbyist Jack Abramal completed the second half of his plea deal
with the government yesterday by admitting to conspiracy and wire fraud charges,
stemming from his 2000 purchase of a gambling boat fleet.
Abramal 46 stood somberly before US District Judge Paul C. Huck to plead guilty to two of
the six criminal counsel in an August-grange re-indipment.
Guilty, your honor, Abramal, said when Huck asked how he wanted to plead,
Huck said attentive sentencing to March 16.
The plea came a day after Abramal have entered guilty placed in three other federal
charges as part of the agreement with prosecutors,
who is required to cooperate in a broad corruption investigation in the members of Congress.
It's going to still so bad.
It's going to be just on, it's going to be great.
They're all running for cover and they're all busy giving their money back too,
by the way.
Oh, Newt King Ridge and Fat Bernie Haskard.
Oh, yeah.
Even the Bushmeister gave six grand back.
Oh, we know where that came from.
We never heard of this guy.
Kind of like Kenny Boylay, you know.
Yeah.
We have no idea who that is and say hi to Kenny for us.
Like a former business partner in the last month,
Abramal played a guilty to contracting a false $23 million wire transfer.
They made it appear as if the pair contributed a sizable stake of their own in a cash
and the $147.5 million purchase of Sun Cruz casinos, Mon.
The plea agreement caused for a maximum sentence of just over seven years
that the sentence could be reduced if Abramal cooperates fully
and would run simultaneously with whatever sentence is imposed in the Washington Corruption case.
Your remaining four accounts in a four-in-demon will be dismissed.
Wearing a dark double-breasted suit and tan baseball cap,
unlike the John Gotti out for the day before,
he ducked out of courthouse side during the waiting car with his Washington lawyer,
didn't talk to attorneys or reporters or anybody else.
Abramal's agreed to cooperate in a wide-ranging corruption probe
that could involve up to 20 members of Congress and AIDS, including Tom D'Lay.
Oh, yeah.
And we'll debob me.
And they're going to really make hay with this.
You can be sure of that.
Just scandal that.
These are the people that we're going to bring integrity back to the White House.
You know that?
After all, I had the Monica business going on.
Let's see.
What's this fax from Eric and Coral Springs?
Eric says, I just wanted to write and say, I met Chuck Sink about four years ago,
when I was searching for way to advertise my golf course.
He was a genuinely sincere man who listened to what I had to say.
His spots for my course were excellent, and I believe they helped my business.
Also, I just wanted to say, I tried to advertise on WQA,
and it was a joke, and when you complain about the people in advertising,
just know there's at least one person out there who understands what you're talking about.
Says Eric, thank you, Eric.
God bless you, baby.
Man, here's a guy that tells it like it is because salespeople are ISIL.
Yes, especially at QAM.
How many times have we had over the years people say, I've had people come up to me at hockey games
and say, you know, I really wanted to buy spots on your station,
but I called as this one or that one, and they never return my call.
How many times?
About 30,000 times.
Just the really pathetic.
But you know, something that doesn't cost us any money.
Like I said the other day yesterday, I'm turning over a new fig leaf.
If they don't want the money, if they don't want all the revenue that they could be making,
hey, that's their problem, you know what?
They're rolling in money.
They're not missing any meals.
I guarantee you the bees, these are missing no meals.
Robert's here, right?
Good old Robert's here, remember you got candid the LA Times?
That's new.
They're liberal and they're like moving all liberals out.
But nevertheless, he's got his own website, robbertshear.com.
He says, Averwap's crimes are indicative of a deep recess pool.
Oh, man, like South Florida, a cesspool.
Top Republican lobbyist Jack Averwap has set to sing
and his long list of former buddies in Congress and the Bush administration
are quaking an anticipation of possible indictments,
stemming from the consummate Beltway Hustlers Crass Rain as the king of K-Street.
Casino Jack, a former head of the College Republicans and a pioneer grade fundraiser
for the Bush 2000 campaign, pleaded guilty to three-flawly accounts
of conspiracy mail fraud and tax evasion in DC yesterday,
and was in Florida, well, this is the day before,
to plead guilty to fraud and conspiracy, et cetera.
Averwap and other defendants must also repay over $25 million to defraud and clients
and another $1.7 million to the IRSA.
The most important for the nation is that Averwap is now detailing the massive web of corruption
he's spun inside the Beltway, which is already sneered to top Bush official
Procurement Chief David Saphabian on charges of lying and obstructing criminal investigation
and reportedly threatens dozens of other DC players.
When this is all over, this will be bigger than any government scandal in the last 50 years
both in the amount of people involved in the breadth to it,
the Stan Brand, former US Councilist specializes in representing public officials
accused of wrongdoing told Bloomberg News, it'll include high ranking members of Congress
and executive branch officials.
Some of the wild westfield of this Beltway corruption was captured in Saturday's
Washington Post X-Pose, the delay Avermaw money trail in documents in chilling detail
how among other scams Avermaw funneled a portion of the millions he had been
skimming from Indian casino operators with a cool million from two Russian energy
moguls through a shell organization called the US Family Network
and from there into the coffers of politicians in a position to help his clients.
Ironically touting its commitment to moral fitness for the nation,
the front group for the multi-million dollar budget had a single staff member
housed in a back room of a capital townhouse it owned and rented out to other organizations
like Link to Avermaw and Tom Delay, the latter's staffer is called
it ominously Delay's Safe House.
This is apparently while Delay felt the need to top the US Family Network
in a 1999 fundraising letter as a powerful nationwide organization
dedicated to restoring our government to citizen control.
It was run by Edwin A. Buckham Delay's former chief of staff who's
lobbying firm the Alexander strategy group carried Delay's wife Christine on its payroll.
But the moral fitness of Safe Crony is impales in comparison to the scandal
of how Avermaw drummed up support for his very clients under the cover of conservative morality.
Isn't that like an Aussie Moran conservative morality?
For example, in order to block the ambitions of a rival tribe to the Chokto Indians
who had paid Avermaw off millions, the US Family Network set a mailing to Alabama residents
warning surely that the American family is under attack from all sides,
crime, drugs, pornography, and one of the least talked about adequately as destructive gambling.
We need your help today to prevent the poor arch- Creek Indians from building
casinos in Alabama.
The letter conveniently failed to mention however that the US Family Network had received
at least $250,000 from the gambling proceeds of the Chokto's.
Another scam detailed in the post story, which could be quickly obtained by Hollywood
for a thriller, players in the mafia dominated Russian energy industries split
a cool million dollar payment through a now defunct-lended law firm in the US Family Network's account,
which was the fact away slush fund for the Avermaw Delay Network.
Sighting the Reverend Christopher Gislin who served as a titular leader of the US Family Network,
the post before that Buckham told the Reverend that payment was intended to secure Delay's support
on legislation forcing the International Monetary Fund to bail out the following Russian economy
without demanding the country raise taxes on its energy and other profitable industries.
Right on cue, Delay found his way on the Fox News Sunday to take up the Russian viewpoint,
they're trying to force Russia to raise taxes at a time when they ought to be cutting taxes
in order to get along from the IMF he said, that's just outrageous.
The IMF back down.
This is just an initial peek into these sorted world being revealed by Avermaw
and two of his key cronies, now spilling the beans to federal investigators,
but in the bigger picture, what we're witnessing is the death-throws of the GOP revolution,
which once promised to restore morality or Washington, but it's that saying far deeper into a
the cesspool of corruption.
Oh, I like that.
The cesspool, kind of like the QA himself department.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 516 QA.
Back this kind of like asking the brain surgery operate on hemorrhoids.
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, I, we're not
1132, 20, it sounded a little like Hannibal Lecter right there, it's a very in.
Yeah, 28 till noon at QIM.
So anyway, guess which movie has got the most nominations or awards by the Screen Actors Guild?
Oh, the Gate Cowboy movie.
Bareback Mountain.
Right.
How'd you like it?
What did you tell me to review?
What was the review?
You're not going to notice you that.
How would you see that?
I'm going to ignore you, Josh.
I don't know if you can get it.
Somebody said that they were going to bring a copy by for Josh, though.
We're waiting.
We're holding our breath.
Yeah, hold your breath.
Just like everybody in the audience is going to be bringing food up to the press box during the Marlins season.
I'm not assuming there is going to be a Marlins season, by the way.
I guess.
I'm assuming.
I don't know if they've got enough players left to feel the team, but, you know, you've got to have nine.
You think?
Yeah.
Could be.
Hopefully.
Hopefully.
They'll find some minor leagers that throw in there.
Josh Corda said that.
Like, I haven't done it already.
I mean, what do you want to do?
Yeah, but if you want to solidify that easy job you got there and all that great free food you get from the Marlins organization.
Yeah, that easy job, but the free food part.
You see, this season will work on up to the big time.
We're just kind of our old friend Troy from Balance for Life to Bring in the Food.
Well, I'm all kinds of people bringing the food up there this year.
I'm sure there will be.
In fact, you know something.
It just dawned on me.
What's that?
What were we begging for them to bring you this last baseball season?
A pizza.
Pizza.
Oh, for me.
There you go.
See somebody probably intercepted all the pizzas.
The pizza, a burglar.
Probably intercepted all the way.
Probably with 20, maybe even the pizzas were brought up to you various games last season.
And they never arrived for you guys because somebody intercepted them.
The stealth pizza thief.
This is great.
I don't know what you're laughing about.
That's his speciality, man.
It's set out of feather.
Racing's on again.
Finish his way off.
This is a funny article about by Diana Moskovitz.
Hey, we'll get back to you.
Diana.
Moskovitz.
What kind of a name is that?
Ho!
They took it all in.
The new grandstand, come house in patio.
Then they got down to Venice.
Like a throwback to a bygone era.
Yesterday was all about horse racing at Gulfstream Park in Hell in the Elvete.
No concert series.
Oh, no Gary Puckett in the Union JAP.
No carnival rides.
No Johnny Maestro in the Brooklyn Bridge.
No gimmicks in the past.
This was an opening day for serious veterans.
Reason they didn't have any gimmicks going on is because they were discouraging people from coming out there.
They wanted people to go to Calder to bet the Gulfstream races because the track is in finish.
They don't want people to be like disappointed.
They said, just go to Calder and plunge your guts out.
I'm the Gulfstream races.
Many shrugged off the unfinished second and third floors in the new clubhouse.
Their views of promise luxury restaurants blocked by green tarps.
But already advertised on flags across the parking lot.
They got fags into parking lot.
Yellow tape marked closed off areas.
Construction dust and the smell of fresh paint hung in the air.
Never mind all that said Joe Hudson on his 30th year.
But third man.
Oh, visiting the races.
There was the new grandstand without a scuff gleaming bathrooms with slick tiles.
Oh man.
By the way, the rumor is that the Palestinians peed on a pedigalock is that the Ariel Sherone ate at the Hanukkah.
The bastards.
They're getting even for a sea.
They hit us a wee hit them back.
It didn't even went air fart.
It's a beautiful facility.
Too bad it's not complete, Hudson said.
This was an older crowd dotted with walkers, canes, and plenty of gray here.
Oh, boy!
Hi, well that's very unusual for Gulfstream Park.
Not.
Most keep a home in South Florida, but some live here part time.
Time spent at Gulfstream is measured in decades.
And they know how to bet.
Horses are called by their numbers, not names.
It's hitting a race, not winning a race.
They jot down every horse, scratch, and jockey change.
You know, Diana, it's really wonderful.
You must know a lot about horse racing as if it's a novelty that horses are called up by their numbers when you go to make a bet.
And if Diana, we knew anything about the tracks.
You'd understand that the old cockers at Gulfstream that lay their racing form down in front of them at the window,
while there are 10 people standing behind them.
These are not people who know how to bet.
They're an impediment to everybody else's enjoyment.
Among them were a few like Mike Nolan who said the new grandstand was getting away from racing.
He couldn't see the horses clearly at the new saddling paddles.
Maybe he's got the key Jackson syndrome.
He paid 10 bucks to get in the club house and was too expensive when he's right about that.
You know, one thing about going to the thoroughbreds, they soak you 10 bucks to go into the clubhouse of Gulfstream now.
It's like, I wonder how much they'll have to ask Hank tomorrow how much the racing form is these days.
And then plus the program, it's got to be like three, four bucks and then a tip sheet.
It weighs 15 bucks before you even get in the door before your ass is in the seat.
Even the George can't afford that.
George would love to go out to the track.
Yeah, George would love to go anywhere if he'd get a free meal and they'd just not go home.
So they're trying to get too fancy Nolan said, but it's a beautiful plan, a gorgeous plan.
Better started at the paddock, bobbing for one last look at the competition.
Then the trumpeter called the horses.
And to the track for the post parade, they stretched along the fences three rows deep.
And the smell of construction gave way to dirt and ocean breeze.
And probably the smell of some of those colostomy bags that the old farts are wearing too.
A few hard hats bobbed among the crowd.
Helen, the albeaches condos towered in the distance.
One unfinished building flanked by construction cranes.
See it highly and they each have like flamingos and whooping cranes.
Here we got construction cranes.
Each race started in neuroscience only the announcer's voice following the horses.
Then they came around the turn.
Then the shouting started reaching a crescendo, drowning out the clacking hooves or commentary.
Come on baby, turn it up, you can get around, come on baby.
It's got like a...
Like, like a street wise at the end of baby there.
A little exaggeration.
The horses crossed the finish to answer calls out a winner most of the crowds sulked away.
See that, she's like saying that most of everybody lost their ass.
Kind of a thing is that.
Among the betters are Tony Vanacore and Irving Goldberg.
Vanacore puts his famished vanacore as many many years.
Goldberg is a little more specific estimating 25.
Goldberg hit the first race.
Vanacore didn't but he had many more to go.
The longest line were for bets not food.
The most red publication was the Gulf Stream handicrapper tucked under arms and rolled into pockets always within reach.
The daily racing form is a close second.
For those less inclined to stand online, walking bettakers run call.
They wore navy blue shirts, bet with me and pink letters on the back and electronic betting machines,
slung across their shoulders like purses.
Soon slot machines will join the fray.
Lotus approved them and prowled last year in Governor Jeb Bush at a middle-of-the-law Wednesday.
We're waiting for a slot, Goldberg said that's the real opening day.
That's the real opening day.
How do you like that?
Even the old cockers are saying we're waiting for the slots.
And one thing that the grand mutuals have failed miserably all of them over the last many years,
getting living and breathing in young people to come out.
Once the slots start, that's going to change totally.
You'll see even Josh is going to be there trying to win his three million.
I'm sure I will.
I just wait till they get those topless cigarette girls.
Matter of fact, I got $98.50 on the $649 last night.
Of course, I spent $200.
But that's not too bad.
In fact, I think when you go gambling, if you can have your money back, you should be pretty happy.
Not as happy as the one guy that won the 10 million cash in a lot of last night, but it wasn't me.
And of course, you didn't have to tell me it wasn't me, did I?
No.
You want to know why?
Because we hear your voice now.
That is correct.
Got a new manager, a new general manager.
At QL Joe Bell, we welcome with Open Arms and Legs.
This, let's go.
Meal Rogers.
This is $5.62.80.
Second on, this is Joe Bell on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and you're listening to the Hockey Authority Neal God.
