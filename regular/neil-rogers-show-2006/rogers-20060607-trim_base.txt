You're fairytale.
And the world is good day.
Absolutely.
Okay, John Lennon, last time we did this, he went to pull.
And we knew he was going to win again.
That's right.
Favorite dead singer.

Not even taste in women, but we don't hold that again.
Who's your favorite dead singer?
I got a great, I got the new inquireer.
I told you the national inquireer.
Yes, you did.
And there's a great rip job here on Yoko, your love this day.
In fact, I'm going to go through the whole magazine.
I'm going to give you a bonus today because it's a film.
Great time too.
We're just ripped to an ass.
You're only going for both hot shots.
Yeah.
You just flipped out, you just went nuts.
Good.
But there's a picture on it that shows stars with eating disorders.
This is the June 12th issue of the inquireer.
And Barbara Strasen, who doesn't weigh an ounce over 400 on here,
she is just a cow.
Oh, he is campbellier.
Wow, I would say a pig, but that wouldn't be kosher.
She's a beast.
She is a beast, all right?
In fact, you know what we got through yesterday?
We made it the world still spinning around.
The sun's still revolving around the earth.
Is that the way it goes?
That's the way it goes.
Yeah.
And we got to that 666.
So we made it to Y2K.
We made it to 666.
All of these things in the life goes on except for Billy Preston.
Who's your favorite dead singer?
We got 547 votes.
I don't know about that thousand, man.
I'm pretty leery on it.
I'm pretty Timothy and Dennis Leary, aren't you?
No, whatever.
Well, that's Eric's fault, Smok.
John Lennon 116.
Bob Marley's 70.
I just don't get that.
I mean, was he a singer?
Yeah, I'm not.
Get out of here.
He didn't sing as well.
I have a paper that reggae cramp.
What's wrong with Bob Marley?
Get out of here, man.
He smoked a newspaper that was fine.
I don't begrudge that to anybody.
But you tell me he made good music?
Bob Marley?
Yeah, he's got some hits.
That had been remade probably at Gillian time.
Such as Joe Wolner.
Oh, cry.
I shot the chair.
Oh, I can keep going, but I don't know.
Oh, my God.
He wants you to be telling me about the...
Give it up.
Yes, you're going to be peddling me tiny, thin as great as his.
Bob Marley's 70.
Although which one had better here?

Roy the Boy.
Elvis 36.
Marvin Gaye 34.
Johnny Cash has got...
Bob Thirdman.

Thirty people.
Good day that he was their favorite singer, Johnny Cash.
That's all with that.
Come on.
Get out of here.
Johnny Cash a lot.
Jimmy Henry's 27.
You know why you like this pull?
Because it's all drug-induced.
That's all drug-eased man.
Sure.
I'm surprised we don't have Eric Clapton on here.
Why don't we have him on there?
He's not dead.
Well, you're...
Huh?
I mean, I say I mean Kurt Cobain.
I'm really on there.
Maybe since I saw that movie, I keep like interspersing those two.
Maybe it's a death wish.
Yeah, Kurt Cobain was next 26.
Why do I keep saying Eric Clapton?
He should have been...
He should have been the one to fly out the window.
Probably.
Jim Krochi 24, he was great.
You got any operator?
I bet you got the...
I got it all.
Huh? You got all of Jim Krochi?
That was one of my very favorites.
And of course Big Bad Lee Roy Brown.
Was Lee Roy big and bad?
I know he was brown.
Was the name like Lee Roy?
Remember Lee Roy Kelly?
Yes, I did.
It sounds like operator.
Yes it is.
Oh yeah.
Since he was a smooth operator.
And he went home just fine.
Not all of you.
Huh?
All the Krochi.
All the Krochi all the time on All Hit Radio.
I can read it.
Let's talk.
Okay, let's listen.

Man, I was a good song.
I like that.
Played that on Zeta a lot.
Patsy Klein's 20, could she sing or what?

You put him on there and then...
Then he went out of his way to tell me
Freddie Mercury died from AIDS,
is if I didn't know that.
You were talking about Billy Preston.
You said he died from AIDS.
Chandler's Joplin, sir.
You're starting to get like Norma Kent.
You know, you're telling me things that I already knew.
You're getting like the listeners that
facts me articles we had on the website
two weeks ago.
Okay.
That Norma's really getting my mind nervous that queen.
I didn't say he died from AIDS.
Who?
Freddie Mercury.
You said something worse than that.
I said I'd buy it again.
I don't want to hear it again.
I don't want to hear it.
I know.
Chandler's Joplin 13.
He died from having a bad...
He died of AIDS.
Since you're making...
Jerry Garcia 12.
He died from those...

I'm dying out of here.
I think they died those ties.

Or what about Diamond Bag Dural?
Who knows Diamond Bag Dural?
I have no idea.
What does that mean?
I don't know.
John from South Carolina.
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
He is a textbook example.
Don't ever go to South Carolina, man.
I'll tell you what your brain language.
It'll melt your brain.
Frank Sinatra got to get him on there.
Yeah, I put some of them old crew members on there,
like Frank Sinatra.
You hear the story about that band leader?
Yeah, I heard that story.
Yeah, well, they know band leader.
WQAM, hello.
How cool, Neil.
Yes, sir.
What about Mama Casselia?
Do we want to put Mama Cass on it?
Yeah, put her on.
Mama Cass?
Put her on.
Okay.
I hope I don't lose you.
Hi.
How are you?
Neil?
Yes.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I haven't.
Who are you talking to?
Hi, how are you?
That wasn't for us.
Who was that?
Yeah, no.
It was for you guys.
I love you guys.
I'm a poll suggestion.
Good.
What's your favorite thing to do when you blow off work perhaps?
You're going to go to the track?
Go to the casino?
That's good.
Here's my boss, took me out for dinner last night.
Here's my birthday.
And I am so hungover.
I got up.
And I drank a beer.
And all that.
But you know what I mean?
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
And that's a good poll, though.
What's your favorite thing to do when you're on that board?
We will do it.
That's cool.
It's like this was my favorite thing to do.

So that's a good thing.
Okay, the price is right, too, man.
Okay, bottoms up, Kelly.
Happy birthday.
By the way, the dime bag Garell is the guitar player for Pantera that got shot and killed.
But he was the guitar player.
He's not saying, oh, who cares about that?
And this guy puts it on there along with Frank Sinatra.
Man, you better start learning your famous singers, Mr. John and Columbia South Carolina.
Jesus Christ.
Nothing could be finer than to beat up Carolina.
That's where everything's open tonight.
Poor Dwayne Roleson.
Man, that's a shame.
Well, that's the way it goes.
You know, life is a bitch.
It just works that way.
Let's play some hockey stuff.
I bet you think about hockey stuff on the NHL network here.

Everybody's in commercial.
So why don't we do it?
Might as well.
Let's well make Chris Jones happy.
He's from Rawley, North Carolina.

You know, the summer season is approaching fast.
What's the day?
The seventh?

And of course, that means it must be close to Father's Day, which it is.
In fact, it's a week from this Sunday.
It's June 18.
We all know what Dad likes to do on their big day.
And on top of that, they like also to eat.
It's time to call the melting pot and make your reservation for Father's Day.
Do something special for your Father, for your Father.
Maybe get him that big like wedding cake.
Or maybe go to the hospital and visit the Don Corleone and stand bodyguard
out front in the smoke of Faggot.
The melting pot is a fondue restaurant.
In addition to their famous cheese and chocolates that I've raved about for years,
they serve up some serious meats and fish for hungry dads with big appetites like yours.
Hardion, trace from Cedricut Filet Manion to Black-in Shrimp,
Teriyaki Sirloin, pork lobster, and lots more.
The melting pot definitely serves some serious food for serious appetites and take it from me.
Nobody leaves the melting pot hungry.
They walk out of their mangasut and pupa because they see an Ethiopia.
I keep going back to Ethiopia. It must be those falaches.
They have an award-winning list to put.
Have you ever been to Ethiopia?
May you have a blast there.
And don't forget the melting pot's famous desserts.
Guaranteed to put a big smile on Dad's Puss.
So make that call today.

This is 5.62 AF.
They're beautiful.
Welcome to the World Cold Soccer Championships.
I'm Tony Charles.
And I'm Nigel Durby.
Today's match pits the Scientologists of America against the French Ray Aliens.
How do you rate this match?
Well, it should be quite the contest.
Celebrity Scientologists against the Ray Aliens
called Made Up Entirely of clones of soccer-grade paylays.
Both teams are taking the field.
The Scientologists will kick off.
They will underway.
It's cool, cool.
Passing to John Travolta being marked closely by paylay number four.
Paylay number six is split.
Two groups in the club.
I don't know where I left my ball from.
Travolta.
Who's attached to Patrick's Ways?
He backed up Roosie Shunks.
He's hitting the back of that.
The Scientologists take up with one million and the Ray Aliens, what is this?
It appears to be the Ray Aliens' impassioned true cult-version committed martial arts.
I'm not banned by loving-ass teams.
Join us for our next match and the Southwestern Philippines take on the Deadhead next time on the World Cold Soccer Championships.
Jail!
On the Deadhead's, they were called us on Monday.
They were all been out of shape and went,
Oh, did we put Jury Garcia on here?
Yeah, he's got a few votes.
Good.
Thank God.
Put the air clapped in on.
Just to go.
Jury Garcia.
Well, I keep hoping, you know, Jury Garcia has got the dozen.
Wait till I get to this inquirer thing, man.
Got some good stuff.
Finally revealed the real father of Jack O's kids, all over the dozen seeing here.
And Oprah and Dr. Phil already told their stroat, good.
And a whole bunch of this crap.
This is the usual garbage.
Oh, and Taylor Hicks gay scandal.
What a shock that is, huh?
Oh, yeah.
You have to be deaf dumbblind and in the box for 10 years now.
And they are Taylor.
You fairy.
Spectators and family members as some of the 17 Muslim men accused of plotting terror attacks in Canada were stunned yesterday.
Stunned.
Oh, my God.
When they heard allegations of plans to storm parliament,
take hostages and behead the Prime Minister.
Off with his head.
Why don't know the Shmata heads there.
They're very big on that.
Yes, they're.
Maybe they're going to represent in the Shmata.
I always heard that Stephen Harper had a good head on his shoulders, although I wouldn't agree with that, but nevertheless.
Wouldn't it have been something that would have been televised right there on live TVA?
A thorough ease during a hearing at the Ontario Court of Justice further relates to one of these suspects.
Stephen V. Koch chained.
Also plotted to take over media outlets, including the CBCA.
Oh, no.
That would be bad.
So the details of the charges notably the purported plot to take political leaders hostage and behead them.
If Muslim prisoners were not freed in Afghanistan.
See, the beheading business, that goes back to just how the kind of century that these people are living in.
And today, tellings like Chapp Chapp square there in the Saudi Arabia.
They chop off their hand, they chop off their head, they chop off their wealth.
And in a chilling dimension to a case that led US authorities to toughen security law and the border.
And on settle Canada's large Muslim community, where we got more ragheads here than you ever seen in your life.
Police say they expect more arrest.
And intelligence officers are probing whether 12 adults and 5 juveniles arrested over the weekend.
Had any, see I'm okay because my can driver, he's a terrorist.
I told you that story tonight.
Yeah.
Proving whether 12 adults and 5 juveniles arrested over the weekend had any ties to Islamic terrorists in the USA.
And 5 nations in Europe and Asia, which I give you those hits they won't repeat it.
Chand, a 25 year old restaurant worker from Toronto, was one of 15 suspects who made brief court appearances today.
They were held behind a glass enclosure, brought in as a group of four or five.
Chand together and ankle, ankle shackles and handcuffs.
Ankle, fuckles and handcuffs.
Chand, bearded with shoulder like, I like that.
Fuckles.
I'm gonna have to do it.
Bobbles, bangles and beads by the Kirby Stone IV on Columbia Records.
Chand, bearded with shoulder like, you don't have that one.
With shoulder like here, the loa kiss to supporters as he was led away, formal bail hearing screaming another 14,
pro spawn to the least next Monday.
I don't have time to straighten all these things out and chop a few heads off.
You're right, I don't have it.
Kick a little ass.
Oh no, these are two good ones now.
Nat King Cole.
That's right.
Put that bag out, Nat.
Too many of them damn faggots made it out of lung cancer.
And I shouldn't have said lung cancer, sure, and it's bad.
Smoking good for you.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just gonna remember that thing we have today.
And Celia Cruz.
Oh, she outpriced.
She's gonna get a lot of hoax at our no-speakening waist ground.
Yeah, there she is.
Celia, I still say she was a guy.
But I could be wrong.
I don't think so.
I know what guy when I see that.
That's what I heard.
And a raki doctor who was in Aditha during a deadly U.S. raid last year says there are many more stories like that.
Aditha that are yet untold.
This is just, didn't that stress it?
I didn't even say just the tip of the iceberg?
That's right.
Just the tip.
That's what God wants.
That's the tip.
You can have the rest of it, but God wants the tip.
Just like a waiter in the restaurant.
Just wants the tip.
The Pentagon in the last week that U.S. Marines can, we know that, but it'll be better boot, but it'll be better.
It's a lie.
There are many, many, many cases like Aditha that are still undercover need to be highlighted in Iraq.
To Dr. Salam Ishmael,
projects manager with the organization Doctors for Iraq and former chief of the junior doctors and vagadads medical city hospital.
In Aditha itself, he said the U.S. military cut electricity and water the entire city of TACTA hospital and burned the pharmacy.
The hospital has been attacked three times.
In November 2005, the hospital was occupied by the American and Iraqi army for seven days,
which they severe breach of the Geneva Convention, he said, out of course from Geneva, New York.
In one of these attacks, the U.S. soldiers used live ammunition inside the hospital.
They handcuffed all the doctors and destroyed the entire contents of the medical storage,
and ended with a killing of one of the patients in his bed.
Well, I guess that's a captive audience.
The Iraqi Red Crest reported at the time that earlier a thousand families have been forced to flee their homes in Aditha,
following the launch of the U.S.-led military operation.
Joseph Hatcher served in Western Iraqi town of Valor from February 2004 till March of last year.
He said his culture of training before deployment consisted of a three-hour class and a pamphlet he was given.
It's just here where you are in a map because you'd be surprised how many people don't know that Hatcher told IPS.
The only language training we received was a hand out flip book type flyer,
which was how to say things like, go down on your hands and knees and don't resist.
We didn't know how to make any come.
Oh, I guess who is speaking to go down on your hands and knees?
Who has the lift up to like about 8,000 pounds?
You're going to be so excited when you hear this.
You mean beside Barra Streisand?
Let me give you a clue.
Wait a minute.
Right.
Have you been down on your knees praying for a quick easy way to lose those unwanted pounds?
Believe me.
I know the ceiling.
Hi.
I'm Monica Lewinsky.
She is going to be around 4,000 pounds.
Oh.
I'm going to be around 4,000 pounds.
I'm going to be around 4,000 pounds.
I'm going to be around 4,000 pounds.
I'm going to be around 4,000 pounds.
I'm going to be around 4,000 pounds.
I'm going to be around 4,000 pounds.
I'm going to be around 4,000 pounds.
I'm going to be around 4,000 pounds.
I'm going to be around 4,000 pounds.
I don't know how to grasp the feet from the jaws of victory.
I want to cry.
Former Republican Congressman narrowly beat his Democratic rival last night to fill the house

Wanted several contest in eight states, closely watched as a possible early barometer next
falls vote.
Republican Brian Bilbray in K and were emerged, emerged victorious after a crossing, contention

A local school board member.
He's a good outfielder man.
Steve Busby.
Is that Steve Busby or Jim Busby?
Ruth Busby.
Jim Busby.
Who Steve Busby?
Is that a basketball player?
Busby Berkeley.
Ah, Josh Donnelly and his stuff.
He's just a punk.
Would 90% of precincts be reporting?
I've actually Josh Dero knows this stuff.
He didn't know anything else.
Space pop.
Who?
Jim Busby?
Steve.
Steve.
Steve.
Steve's more recent.
Would 90% of precincts be reporting, Bilbray had 56,930 votes or 50% Bill Bray
saved with a trail with 45%.
The race was viewed by Democrats as a chance to capture a solidly Republican district
and build more momentum, more on their hopes to capture control of the house, more on control,
but didn't happen.
Also in California, state pressure of Phil Angelini's narrowly beat controllers Steve
Wesley in the state's gubernatorial primary is not related to Glenn Wesley, a place for Carolina.
He next faces European governor Arnold Schwarzenegger who faced no credible opposition in this party's nomination.
And it goes on.
Also the only good news is, and not really good news, but something.
Alabama, Republican governor Bob Raleigh easily beat back his U.O.P. primary challenge from 10
to maimage judge Roy Moore.
While Democratic former governor Don Siegelman, who campaigned while on trial and corruption charges,
lost his combat fight against the tentative governor Lucy Baxley.
Also in Alabama, of course voters passed a ban on gay marriage by margin of 4 to 1.
I wonder who the one was if they find that one.
That pick is asked.
You know, they're going to all, they're going to time to a tree and yell,
while I shoot his ass.
What do you think?
I would have been.
Or maybe they'll just do the old severed head trick.
This is Neil Schwarzenegger, anytime I'm from.
This is 560 QAS.
If you love delicious convenient Omaha states,
but we're something a bit more exotic than you got to try,
Bell Mara states.
I love it.
Smarty Joe is medium rare.
That's right.
We slaughter horse racing's finest past champions,
craft them in colorful selves, then overnight them straight to your home.
Who wants another jocomow burger?
I do.
I'm so hungry I can eat a horse.
Well now you can.
Thanks to Bell Mara's take.
When the triple crown of breed taste,
try new Bell Mara states.
Anything less is just vlogging a dead horse.
I always like that chicken picker burger myself.
1046, 14 before 11 at 560 W.
Come here got Curtis for a little cameo today and right in the middle of the daytime,
broad daylight when people are waking the sun is out.
Curtis to the three and we got to the Marlon game.
Oh, Marlon's in the Giants.
Let's see in the first two games this series have been out scored 16 to 3.
Hey, well listen in 20 and 36 I believe.
Is that correct?
Yes there.
20 and 36 has been in the third and if this rate they might actually win like over 50 games.
It looks like to me they got a good shot at about 55.
That's exciting.
That's that's a hell of a season.
Of course if they won 55 it means they lose 107 but you know that's being negative.
Jelly at the NBA finals follows the Marlon Giants game,
the third final game in a series and then it indicates end of night.
Give the get the game out of the way you know early so you can sleep well the night.
Marine down writes good old Marines.
He's always got something to say in New York Times and this doesn't cause you dime either.
Not great.
Wonderful.
Marlon says is that right you don't like Marine down?
I love her a lot.
Oh.
Is that right this on 6606 you said yesterday?
Well it's today's paper but yesterday's calm.
With the new Damien demonically wheeling through movie theaters trying to kill his mom and her remake of the Omen.
Let us now speak a famous boogie man.
Now who's in that movie the boogie man?
Oh there's been time for certain heaven.
I can never think of his name.
You're talking about the most recently.
Very Watson.
There you go.
Elementary might do Watson.
The voices have always been good at using boogie man of their political advantage Marine writes.
Lee outwater the devilish strategist for Bush senior turned an obscure criminal named Willie Horton into the candy man in 1988.
Whipping up the fear that if Michael Ducakis were elected,
Horton's of swarthy's skulls would be freed on weekend parole and swarm into your neighborhood.
W. Supporters beat back the McCain threat in the 2000 South Carolina primary by spreading gossip that the Arizona senator had fathered a black baby,
a creepy distortion of the fact that he and his wife had adopted little girl from Bangladesh.
Carl Rove and atwater acolyte had a closet full of boogie man whisking W.
Pass the finish line in 2004, terrorist who might strike again,
gays who wanted to get hitched, stem cell research, darwin, dan rather, and a swift boated John Kerry.
W. prefers tactical bait and wires to real ones,
salary followed his lead by joining conservatives to support a constitutional ban on flag burning.
The president had a truly terrifying boogie man in Osama,
but instead carried it up a fake nuclear villain in Sodom.
He has played down bin Laden, first averting the resources needed to capture him,
and now they've heard him the money needed to protect against his likely targets,
letting Homeland Security funds be moved from New York and Washington.
John Stewart has said that O. O. O. O. O. O. got a lot of Homeland Security money because it was under threat by the renowned bin Western terrorist O. Hama bin Laden.
O. O. O. O. bin Laden. I blew it. O. O. O. bin Laden. Thank you.
That's cute. That was cute. Even though I blew it.
As Mike Crowley of the New Republic notes, the FBI does not even mention 9-11.
When it's 10-most wanted fugitives, profiled of Osama,
the poster updated in November 2001 says bin Laden has wanted the bombings of the U.S.
M.S. season 10s in E. and Kenya. Kenya, believe it, that killed 219-98,
and is a suspect in other terrorist attacks, not one word of the nearly 3,000 killed on September 11th.
Fearing that their monopoly on Washington power could be coming to an end,
voters grumpy at Republicans over Iraq, gas prices, Medicare, social security,
corruption while spending in general in competence,
Bush strategists have revived the gay marriage Frankenstein to scare the basin
that's turning out for the midterms. That brighter Frankenstein would have been female.
Same-sex marriage is far less spooky than the 17 severed heads recently found
in the village northeast of Baghdad, or the terrorist suspect accused of conspiring
to be head the Canadian Prime Minister.
W. Ignored the gay marriage issue in the 19 months after he used it to help
and stay in the White House, to reprise it now knowing it has no chance of passing
is so transparent that surely even the most blinkered values voters see through it.
When Polsters ask Americans their top priorities, gay marriage doesn't leap onto the list,
in a new ABC News poll, only four intense surveyed were in favor of rewriting Constitution at all.
Even as W. gave a speech here promoting a constitutional amendment,
decided demonizing the discriminate against a group of Americans who have done nothing wrong,
his heart didn't seem in it. A Democratic strategist noted on CNN that the president looked as cowed as a
long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs. Wrestling with Iraq in Iran have worn down W.
and he knows as we do that a couple of middle-aged guys who want to tie the knot in Provincetown
is not the worst threat America faces. With our Marines needing refresher courses in core values
and with Nick Cheney promoting values like torture, government snooping and preemptive war,
it rains hollered to opportunistically proselytize on family values.
Mary Cheney, the gay daughter of the vice president, told an interview as recently
that her father opposed the marriage amendment.
As the Times media who sometimes emails may put it, the values voters turn out to be opinion voters.
They believe that God hates homosexuals, that superstition trumps science every time,
that all those foreigners ought to be sent back where they came from,
and that all government programs are wasteful and a moral except the course for the government programs which benefit them.
Those are opinions not values and mostly ignorant opinions of that.
I know Republicans are desperate. Does it make sense to use gay love to hate monger here
when we have so much real hate coming at us from abroad? Ask your buddy Marine Dowd.
Nice going Marine, you go, girl. Very good. I don't see how many votes we got on a poll.
Let's see if we got a fighting shot at 1,000 today because if not boy, I'm taking the right to the month off.
The rest of the year. 625. You think we're alive?
You know something somebody didn't put Karen Carpenter on his poll and I say Karen Carpenter, I said it right on the air.
You did? Yes. Did I say that Josh?
He's getting the food right now but I don't remember you saying that.
I'll put it all right now. He's getting the food right now. See what I'm up against?
These are the priorities. He's all right here. What's going on?
I think Karen Carpenter, you put that bitch on there. What do you like anti-carpenter now?
You're talking about it. You didn't tell me to do that.
I don't know how I did not. I'll bet you your next $17 million.
Tell me when I'll rewind. I don't remember any hour.
Like I've always made up about Billy Preston this morning.
You're making a lot of stuff out of it. I thought Billy Preston died from AIDS.
I didn't say that. And Karen Carpenter, she would have just eaten an extra sandwich.
Okay, I didn't say it. Whatever you, look, I know that. I saw that movie many times.
What? Gaslight? That's the one. With Humphrey Bogart?
Yeah, with Billy Preston.
634 votes. I think we may have a shot.
You think? Let's get out and push.
Oh, there's the John Stewart.
Well, that is the most surprising thing about the club.
Although I have to say, I was a big fan of their Variety show.
Karen Lee Bob.
I still remember one of their big kits.
We gotta do something about outsourcing the India.
Oh, boy. Anyway, like I said, I'm not fortunate enough to catch all the kids.
All the really funny bits he does.
634 votes. Who's your favorite dead singer?
John Lennon 134. Bob Marley 76.
Bob Marley, my ass.
Come on. I don't get that.
I mean, I understand a lot of people like Bob Marley and like his hair do
and like the fact he used to smoke a big fat stiff man.
But come on. But, you know, we're asking their opinion.
Maybe they just got crappy opinions, you know?
Jim Morrison 62. Elvis 42.
Roy Orbison. Roy DeBoys. That's what the fags say. Roy DeBoys 40.
Marvin Gaye 37. Johnny Cash 33. Jimmy Hendrix is God.
Bob Thirdman.
Kurt Cobain 29. You see the connection between most of these names and throes?
Yeah. They like the droggies.
Not necessarily. I mean, Jimmy Hendrix could he sing or what?
What's got most of his time in a purple haze?
No. Oh, come on.
Kurt Cobain and Jimmy Hendrix each have about 30.
Jim Krochi 25. George Harrison 25.
Patsy Klein. She used to walk in after midnight, 21.
Freddie Mercury 17. He died of pneumonia.
Janice Joplin 15. He might have actually had new most systems pneumonia.
You see, I should have said like headache, right?
To think Janice Joplin 15. Georegreci of 14.
Karen Carpenter just went on her. She already got one.
She had a whole bunch of you to put around her when I told you.
That's right. Rick Johnson a dozen. Frank Sinatra 8.
Buddy Holly 8 and 8. They need Netho.
Billy Preston 3. See, the cruises got appear.
I believe that. And that where you think either.
Karen Carpenter 1. That King Cole 1. And Mama Cass Elliott.
None. And did they say that that was just a made up story about that?
That was like in a powerful, huh?
That was correct. It was a made up story about her choking on a sandwich yourself.
That's right. That was really good.
Well, it's Google it. Let's do it.
Right. Wikipedia probably has it.
Yeah. Wikipedia. It's wicked.
Has Mama Cass. What about what's her name?
Who also is dead?
There aren't really too many female singers.
You know, when you come right down to it?
Who you talking about? Peggy Lee is still alive.
And she or she did. I mean, I wouldn't put her on her, huh?
No idea. You don't have any idea about Peggy Lee?
Well, why do you're on Wikipedia? Do a little Peggy Lee at the end.
Lots of different websites.
She's got fever.
Febra in the morning and something at night.
I can't say it though.
So 643 will be closing on 700 by the end of the hour,
which is approaching very fast. Not fast enough for me.
Way to like it to this inquire stuff, man.
It is just, although I can't show you the pictures on the radio.
Taylor Hicks.
Yes, can you let me come on.
You know, that's supposed to be like a bulletin.
Good God.
Oh, Jessica and Nick were spread to the siblings.
Now, you know, Ashley Simpson was a tremendous talent.
Yeah. Now let's see.
She married Drew, his brother.
Is that correct?
I'm afraid I'm not as up to date on the Simpson's as I should be.
No, that's not true.
Oh. Well, see, Josh is.
It's obviously he's big on Ashley Simpson.
No, definitely not.
Well, if you want to get over it, Jessica here,
she looks like a guy with a blonde wig.
Got a pick-rover in his wallet.
Oh, who, Ashley?
Right.
You know, Harry keeps it close to his ash.
643, we got a shot.
As Jimmy Johnson said, we got a shot.
Of course, in his case, he should have been shot.
Made up a lot of stories.
Made a trash, the brainstem real bad.
It was all done, washed up, and then he came in there.
What did he do?
How long was he there?
Four years, I think, made a fool of himself.
Yeah, he didn't do too well.
No.
Talk to Big Game, no?
And now of course, he's under Fox talking.
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.
They're not going to bring back Shannon Sharpegan.
Are they this football season?
Please tell me no.
Well, we would hope not, so that would probably.
My God.
Why the racial organization don't do something about that?
He sets racial relations back about 6,000 years, man.
And he's just impossible.
Plus being an idiot.
At least Dion was a snappy dresser.
It was a part there for a pimple, you know what?
The question.

You've got that.
This is the Neil Roger.
This is your brain.
Two to three.
Any questions?
Hello, this is Albert Kina from Charlie Van Records, inviting you American infidel to why latest cat Stevens collection.
You know my home, it is right.
Take your head off your body.
Got a machete with the real sharp blade.
How I wish I had an American hot pitch.
Make those in middle length.
Also including this classic.
I was on the airplane and suddenly with the change.
Their magic is I can burn.
And where it's out on my head.
I don't know what I'm at.
I'm being followed by an X-16.
The money from your purchase does not go to fun terrorism, really.
It's not time to get off the plane.
Just relax and take it easy.
You're just dumb.
That's your fault.
It wouldn't have been a firewood you.
Oh, I find dark skin and a red.
If you want a detainee.
I know there's a variation on the classic.
I ask myself every day.
Which American should pay?
Tell me who would move on with slaying.
I'm going to share your evidence.
I'm going to do the neck of a woman.
She lived her veil and explored her self.
So find no catch, Steven's collection good day from 1995.
Or you can play with Lisa, Mastercard or weapons of master drugs.
And back at you.
Hey, William.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Okay, just relax.
I can't afford for this story not to print out.
This is too important.
You want to hear the heading?
Russell Shaw writes, and Colter bitches too kind of word for you.
Got it?
I got it.
You don't like that?
I'm jones and to hear more.
Well, let me see if there's going to print out now.
There it is.
Oh, thanks God for my really nifty equipment here.
Oh, thank the Lord, man.
Earlier today, this is yesterday on the Huffington Post, Russell Shaw wrote this,
the today's show is Matt Lauer challenged,
Frightwing Pundit, not right wing, but Frightwing Pundit, and Colter on this charming statement of hers.
The self-obsessed women seem genuinely unaware that nine-level was an attack on our nation,
and acted like as if the terrorist attack only happened on them.
They believe the entire country was required to marinate,
and they're a exquisite personal agony,
apparently announcing Bush was part of the closure process.
Then Matt said, and this is the part I really need to talk to you about,
these bras are millionaires, lionized on TV,
and articles about them, reveling in their status as celebrities,
and stalked by grief parotsies.
I've never seen people enjoying their husband's death so much,
because they dares speak out and ask,
and quoted and said something in the fact that she,
that the left loves the fact that by being widows,
these women exude a certain gravitas of quotability.
Well, Anne, if you believe these are reveling in millionaire broads,
I invite you to be a fly on the wall tonight.
A fly on the wall is one of these widows
who looks at her dead husband's picture about her death,
and remembers the finer times.
A fly on the wall is one of these widows who looks at the other side of what was her marriage bed,
and sees no one there.
A fly on the wall is one of these widows who introduces a new male friend to her children,
and the instantaneously, yet only to themselves,
wonder if he'll be as kind and loving to their mother as their slain father was.
A fly on the wall is one of these widows
who listen to a new audio tape by Osama Bin Laden,
and wonders why the man who was the ultimate mastermind of her husband's murder hasn't been caught.
A fly on the wall is one of these widows' needles in prayer,
looks up to heaven at the projected presence of her slain's husband's spirit,
and with tears in her eyes says,
I'm doing this for you because you can't sweet art.
A fly on the wall is one of these widows reads,
and hears Anne Coder's hurtful, spiteful words,
and dams Anne Coder to hell.
I'm no authority on the next life, Anne Coder,
but I know something about this life,
and in this life, consigning you to bitch them is too kind of an designation.
I've got a better word for you, Anne Coder,
that word rhymes with a football team's often do on fourth down.
Is that good or what?
Great.
Woo!
You punt!
All right.
She's a whore, paid off for.
Man, that's good.
Transvestite.
Oh yeah, well just like Miss Fudge, you know, her boyfriend.
So, Anne, thanks to a faxer out there
who faxed us in the real DMS on...
I'm a cast?
A printed that up off a Wikipedia, instead of saying.
Oh, I thought the listener's synthesis in.
No.
Well thanks to George for a print this up.
No, sorry.
I got a paper cut during that last little crisis there.
Mother's a small one.
But on my knuckle.
Ooh.
I sure hope that he doesn't open up a woodline.
I bleed on the machine, man.
Infection.
Wouldn't be the first time.
Wouldn't be the first time I had some bloody machine.
W.Q.A.M. Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes sir.
I know you're not too big on dark phones, but I want to put Luther Vandross on your phone.
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
I'll give you Luther Vandross on the phone.
Yeah.
So what does that mean?
Some of my favorite singers were Black.
Oh, okay.
Don't you get out of the way you.
Okay, get out of here.
Not too big on Black folks.
All that Motown stuff.
Well, what is wrong with you?
What do people say that?
That's such an acid-ine thing to say.
You know, I deal with people as people.
Some of my best friends are White.
Put Luther Vandross on her.
I mean, I put more Black artists on there, but I just can't think of that many who are dead.
You know?
Marvin Gaye.
Marvin Gaye.
He's on there.
All right.
He was kind of like light mocha anyway, you know?
He wasn't chocolate now.
He was like even lighter than Ray Nogginhead.
Well, well, name me, son.
We got Jimmy Hendrickson.
Let's look at the list, Bob Marley.
It seems to me he would be damn dark, huh?
That's pretty dark list now that you are.
Marvin Gaye.
Jimmy Hendrick's, right?
Right.
Let's see.
Billy Preston.
Billy Preston was Black.
That King Cole.
I got news for it.
There are no darker people in the world than that King Cole.
That King Black is Cole.
Right.
That's correct.
He just happened to be a very dark player.
You know what?
Like Sidney Prachi, he was a singer.
What about Johnny Nash?
You said something about him yesterday.
Yeah, that he died of AIDS.
He did it with?
Huh?
That's that he died of AIDS.
Oh, would you stop already?
I wonder if he's dead or alive.
We could put him on there.
He won't get any votes.
So we had a couple of this.
I'll check it out.
Luther Van Ross.
So just there aren't that many dead, big singer people that I can think of.
If you got some fine, Black.
Right.
That's their job to do the research.
Like how about a few soccer motos?
We can put a Japanese guy on there.
But I'm not too big on the Japanese, you know?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
You're going to say this crap.
I don't know where that comes from, man.
Maybe he heard the show.
Oh.
Yeah, maybe he heard you make some kind of a racist remark.
But probably it was Josh who would make that comment about Steve Nash that he's speaking of Nash.
Oh, there's a few soccer motos on Capitol Records.
I eat in someone at Tsukiyaki.
Oh, the vocals are like, no, we're on them.
Yeah, that's why I talked it up to him.
But we can hear him singing.
That's okay.
That's enough.
Wow.
A few soccer motos.
I had that record.
Aren't you excited about that?
Yeah.
Don't ask me why.
Well, because it was a little bit of a hit.
I know when you're thinking about it.
You buy all the high-understand ballads all the time.
Myths and urban legend holds that Mama Cass Elliott died while choking on a hand sandwich.
This is patently incorrect.
Surely after her death, but before her autopsy, the Times Post was an article I quoted her doctor
speculating that she probably died as a result choking on a sandwich while lying in bed.
However, later that week the coroner found no food in her trachea and determined that the cause of death was heart failure.
Well, how could that be?
She'd been way more than 800 pounds.
Nevertheless, the juicy rumor spread with the popular imagination and belishing that it was a hand sandwich, possibly based on an association with hand pigs and her obesity.
No.
Another version of the story holds that the doctor found a sandwich or partially eaten sandwich in a room causing him to speculate about the cause of death.
The urban legend led to the joke that if Mama Cass had given Karen's temperature a hand sandwich they'd both feel like today.
I always like that.
That's cute.
Come on, Karen.
Just a little nosh.
Come on.
Another popular myth about Mama Cass is that her vocal range was improved after she was hit on the head by copper tubing.
Cute!
Surely before joining the band.
Elliot had been dogging her friend and former bandmate Danny Dorey led her join the band.
The myth purports that while Cass and the band members were in the Virgin Islands, copper tubing fell on her head and miraculously changed her voice.
The myth was started by band member John Phillips as a justification for letting her rid of the band after initially refusing her to love a join.
He repeats the story himself on the PBS special California Dream in the songs of the Mamas and Poppins insisting it's true.
Casey Kasey repeated the story during a show.
It was right after they lost that band dog.
Now let's see.
Do you have a bet you got that Mama's in the Poppins?
Oh, yeah.
Scads of a lot of them.
I loved them.
I liked them a lot, but I want to hear it.
The e-true Hollywood story about Mama Cass reports and revives the completely unfounded and baseless rumor that singer songwriter John Lennon of the Beatles may have been the father of Elliot's daughter Owen.
Uh-oh.
That's it.
It's just a tease.
This rumor most likely, but you cut it off because you know I was going to like nail it.
That's right.
This rumor most likely originated from Cass's obsession with the Beatles.
Many years after Cass's death, badmate Michelle Phillips, I'll go and find her real biological father.
It's Wednesday. It's not Monday.
So, can I crack that?
How are we doing on the pole? We're going to make that thousand of they or what?
That's what everybody in town is talking about. That's what I'm hearing.
That's the feedback I'm getting.
Because 690-0, 690.
Ooh, we can't say that.
You know something during the break, 693.
During the break we hopped over, we went from 665, but to top it out every freshness which is 667.
So we hopped over the obvious.
That's good. That's a good thing.
Must have been Jesus.
693 votes.
Luther Van Ross, by the way, don't have any votes here. We put them on there, even though I'm not too big on dark people.
Probably I'll tell you one thing.
Can't get much bigger than that, with that icy sleeve.
I see we're in that icy hot sleeve and the icy hot pants during the game tomorrow night.
No.
Can't hurt, huh?
I'll tell you one thing, Mr. When you go to Detroit, you better wear all the protective armor you can.
It's just what I want to tell you right now. Just keep that in mind. You ever been in Detroit?
No.
Do not go there.
In fact, I finally thought of the name's Fowlerville and Weberville and Brighton.
These are the, remember the other day I couldn't think of those names as you driving from West into Detroit?
Right.
And you go through all these suburbs, these, uh, in Northville, all these Fowlerville and Brighton and Weberville.

This is 5.62 AF.
Take off those checkered pants.
Where the high you're going to CBS?
Why do we give the damn?

Shouldn't take the job from an old man.
You're only good when you're perky.
The credibility's what you lack.
Are you going to cross your legs and smile?
When your life on the scene in Iraq?
So good back to the today show.
And all those cookies say men.

Oh you're not to think that you're alive beyond the today show.
If she started yet or what I don't watch CBS news.
I don't know how you are.
I bet she's watchin' CBS news.
He probably likes that old funny that he bob sheeper.
I bet you don't watch any nightly newscast.
I don't watch news period.
Good thing.
You read our bedtime stories.
That's right.
National Association of Broadcasts of President and CEO David Rear.
Has sent a letter to the FCC chairman Kevin Martin.
The commission of investigators said the radio is offering a free list.
The NAV is considered about free trial subscription that becomes standard with new SM and serious receivers installed in cars.
Thus allowing listeners to hear potentially offensive and indecent material without having paid for it.
As well as recent reports of radio is being able to pick up sat-catcher signals that are overmodulating.
Overmodulating.
Sort of like bleeding over to the conventional terrestrial bands.
Rear says that the NAV is considered about the unequal regulatory treatment between free over the air and satellite radio and damn well ought to be.
He said recent articles about satellite broadcasting bleeding through so they can be picked up on FM radios.
And notes here's the best part that we had this once before.
Even on normal probably sent me a breathless email about it later on.
Notes that people listening to NPR and Christian radio on non-commercial stations at the end of the radio band have been especially subject to the receipt of unwelcome satellite program that could clearly fall within the FCC's definition of indecent material.
During NPR and Christian radio, oh my God, the NAV has passed along complaints to the FCC that states it received over such incidents.
Rear also discusses free trials of satellite radio and new cars and the rental cars.
And to the extent that satellite radio service is now received free by non-subscribers, this undermines the frequently met argument that satellite radio should be regulated very differently than traditional broadcast radio simply because satellite is a subscription service.
So you see they're creeping into our frequencies now just like that Spanish language kept.
I don't hear any more about that if they don't anything about it.
They killed a pastor or something. What are they done about that? Nothing.
I don't know.
Is that still bleeding through real bad?
I don't know.
I can't know.
I'm not sure if it's in English in a background.
So whatever happened with the voices I was hearing before, John, so you go in there and investigate?
Yeah, there was nothing going on.
I heard some voices in the back during a couple of spots.
In fact, I think it was Robert Creeper saying, yeah, I go.
WDQYM, hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, how you doing today?
OK.
Yesterday you mentioned a fruit fly and cracked me up because you used to play a bit where the guy is something about the guy being hung like a fruit fly.
Uh-huh.
If you could think of what that is, a player for me, I don't know.
No, we can't play that no more. You're dreaming, man. We can't play that.
You're in fact, if we did, we would get hung.
We'd get the old severed head routine. Right. Not like a fruit fly either.
This guy, you know, you people just don't understand it, do you?
And now that the house is going to like, you know, or cave in, they haven't done it all ready this morning.
They're going to do it sometime today.
And they're going to pass that indecentity thing that the same one of Senate passed.
And they're going to jack up the fines to a 325 grand per cent 32.
If you think that it's repressive and restrictive now, you ain't heard nothing yet.
That's why it's so stupid that Norma's having this idiotic meeting with the two of the trombra there on Friday.
You know the trombra, Joyce, Joe and Josh?
Darryl, that is.
Yeah, that's the, we ought to change our name.
Well, let's see if Janipal Crouch will allow us to steal an impunity broadcasting.
That's the evil trinity. Joe, Josh and Joyce, the three jays.
Not necessarily in that order.
Yeah, see they thought that the three sixes were the evil thing. No, it's the three jays.
They probably thought it'd stand for old Jews.
So don't be talking crap like that, man. You're going to wind up in prison and federal prison.
I'm going to get to this inquirer stuff. I might have to be take 400 cars.
All right, it's been season.
Now let's keep our eye on that poll now because I don't, you know, Josh lays down on a job.
He's not pushing the audience to get under and vote.
We're definitely going to get it down in there.
715 old beans, 715. I don't know.
It's 22 past 11. Time is marching on.
And you know what's two o'clock it's here. You know what it is. You know what day it is?
It's not Tuesday. So it's not Prince spaghetti day.
It's not Thursday. So I'm not wearing a green shirt.
It's wood buying Wednesday, man.
Oh, that you have a lucky shirt.
Actually, if I played my cars right, what I could do is like maybe during a long break,
I could like get my clothes all on and go down there and get that package.
Right? Because that's got to do a book of Brian Disgund.
It's also got all my new stuff for my iPod. That is correct.
You know, I'm not going to, I don't want to get involved with Gary Sarner,
but it really, it's just frost my fan. I spit that again.
They don't listen to the station anyway. And certainly not to this show because they're all bunch of sports nerds.
And what does this show have to do with that? You know?
But now that I got my iPod, and I'm shopping around for like maybe a docking station,
and hearing certain other people do it. Yeah, I don't want to get involved in it,
but Gary Sarner, man, you are as useless as breast on a hog.
Speaking of that, here's that picture of Barbara Streisand.
Oh, oh boy. He's got no bra on.
Oh, oh, you're so happy.
I haven't seen the picture. I'm afraid.
You know something. If you saw this picture,
if you want to scare the terrorists, this would do it.
Yeah. If you want to send Osama back into the hills, this would do it.
She could use a burka.
Oh, please.
Man.
Every jerker should be covered by a burka.
Yeah. So are they pointing down?
They're off to the side.
Oh, oh.
She's got a jacket on.
And it only shows her right breast, which is probably like,
hooping down, kind of like southeast, southeast direction.
The other one is kind of like, I don't know. I don't know what that is.
I just threw up in my mouth, but yeah, there you go.
And she's got a pooping on here, man.
She looks like a fat boy.
Looks like Karen Carpenter on a bad day.
See, the thing on the cover is stars with deadly eating disorders.
Now, most of the ones they show not all, but many of them are like anorexic.
Right.
And Nicole Richie who weighs four pounds.
You know, Nicole Richie has got a bra on, and I have no idea why.
Oh.
I mean, over a face.
No, seriously, my boobs are bigger than hers.
They're not even debatable.
She's wearing a bra on.
What's the point for what?
She's a nasty skank.
Good, God.
And then here's Osas Guess Who, low point, five six ninety one pounds.
I guess you have to turn into the article and find out who that is.
Oh, here it's Ashley Simpson, Josh's soulmate.
She's five six and she weighs seventy pounds.
Oh, she's not even a one on the front page.
She's a different one.
Oh, here's you.
Oh, another one.
Courtney Thorne Smith.
She's five six and a hundred and three pounds.
Wow.
She used to look good.
Barbara, who doesn't weigh, she don't weigh an ounce over six hundred.
Seriously, here's a much bigger, uh, bigger version of the picture on the front cover.
I'm gonna have to go buy that magazine.
Oh, you've got to get this.
It's the June 12th issue where you won't miss it, believe me.
Eating disorders.
Felicity Huffman.
She's five five and ninety eight pounds.
Kelly Clarkson, five four one oh nine.
See, I don't, I really don't know them.
I mean, you can only imagine.
Oh, Oprah, her ass is bigger than an apartment complex.
I gotta read this right now.
Okay, so you're getting me all out of order here.
But this is a Christie alley.
Oh, look at that.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Listen, she makes Barbara look like Halley Berry on her hottest ever day.
Oh, that's a good word of bravery.
There is a picture here, the before picture, you know, before she, you know,
a star wearing these real tight skirts.
In your life, you have never seen it.
You want to vomit meals that you have that can't even remember what it was anymore.
Oh, oh my goodness.
Wow, her ass, her pupic, her boobs.
I mean, she, and the face, the hair, you've got to get this.
Please, I'm begging you.
Somebody's got to bring it into you.
The June 12th issue of the National Inquirer.
It is a must.
Oprah Winfrey is going to picture that cow.
She was on a 400 calorie, they died.
And then she added a couple of zeros on it.
And she says, I have an eating addiction that I'm constantly trying to control.
I know there have been instances where I'm eating to repress my feelings.
Poor baby, with her billion dollars.
For those words, Oprah, a lifelong yo-yo diet or confess the world's worst kept secret to her touch of audience.
Now, 52, she's also admitted.
I've been struggling with my weight since I was 22.
In her most famous weight-related episode, 5.7 Oprah lost 67 pounds in three months.
On a 400 calorie a day liquid protein diet, 1988, by the way, several people died on that.
She probably showed off her some 130 pound figure on national TV and sleek size 10 genes.
But two days later, two days later the genes didn't fit no more.
And her weight continued to soar hitting a high of 275.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Two days!
She finally took control of her eating when inside of a say, doctors told her to diet or die she turned 50.
Just about a year ago, she probably showed off her remarkable 100 pound weight loss and fitted clothes.
Since then, she's packed on 57 more pounds.
Wow.
Ah! While she tried numerous diets and exercise regimens, her addiction to food always seemed to me to fail in the end.
Food is my drug, she says, and I just can't kick it. Old-style, new-style, any-style.
Wow. What a cow.
Man. See, one thing about me, I know 187 this morning, it's not too bad for me, huh?
Right.
Not good. I'm still a cow. I'm looking back to you.
I'm sitting here way better than you have been.
No, it used to be better than that 240 at IOD.
Oh, man. I can't even imagine what that was like.
I don't know why it used to be, it was big wire, it was big wire, it was obviously colored chocolate.
How could you find your wrist? Put your shoes on without straining.
Shoes? What were those? Yeah.

We're past 27.2560 WDQM. We got, I think, 700 in some votes.
We get close to 800 by the end of the hour. We got a lift. What do we got? 745. I think we got a shot. Don't you?
We got something. Your favorite dead singer? I think we had to put like Tammy Torell on there too. She was great.
Speaking of dark dead singers. Sure, we'll get any votes. Kim was in Tammy Torell, huh? Let's do it.
What about Gladys? Nice. He's not dead, but she was black. Get that one guy happy.
746 votes on there. Mama cancels on the bottom with one. Luther Van Raus has got only one.
Billy Preston III, acting cool three. Celia Cruzade, Buddy Hollyade, Karen Carpenter did not eat 12. Rick Nelson 13.
I guess this audience is seven that crazy about Rick Nelson.
Whoop. Come on. You like his music. He's fine.
Jerry Garcia is better in Jerry Garcia. You got that right.
Okay, and Jerry Garcia has got 15. How do you like that? All your Rick Nelson fans, but are hop on there, man. Start revolting.
What the hell is that? Rick Nelson. Get out of here.
Yeah. Oh, I hate that song. Why did you pick that song and play it all the sozy hit?
How about some small sea like Hello, Mary Lou? Huh?
There we go. Like I said, something small sea like Hello, Mary Lou, or Travelling Man, or something a little bit of a beat to it, a little something something.
Anyway, there you go. That was the first music video ever made. I couldn't have asked before and it was boring, man. It's boring.
Yeah, I seen Nelson. Did you know that? I did. I told you before, but you forgot it because there were too much drugs.
But that was the first music video ever made. Now, as you Nelson done it. In the background, he, you know, with his group there, they were singing the song in the background.
They had clips from Hawaii in different places, you know, all over the world.
Welcome Garden Party is in here under Rick Nelson and everything else is under Ricky Nelson.
Well, that's because by that time he became Rick. You know, when you get to be a certain age, that's an interesting point.
Yeah. No, no, seriously. Like in sports, no matter how old a guy gets to be, he's always like Bobby or Tony.
Tommy or Timmy. Yeah. But like in the real world, like in real life, you know, he went from Ricky Nelson to Rick Nelson because he was trying to shed his teenage pop star image.
And of course, you went over like a lead balloon, you know, and he was pretty peered about it. You know, he did that thing in Madison Square Garden.
He didn't sing all the old hits and they booed and they got all bent out of shape. And that's why he did the song.
In fact, this is the song. Why are you playing all this Rick Nelson?
He's dead. Here we go. See, he's got 15. I don't know what you people are thinking about.
Janice Joplin 16, Patsy Klein 23 or is that pasty Freddie Mercury 24. He died from hiccups.
Frank Sinatra 25, Jim Croci 27, George Harrison 28, my sweet Lord. I got my mind set in you Jimmy Hendrix 32, Kurt Cobain 34.
Oh, you got to see that movie.
Oh, I blow your own brains out. Oh, yeah.
If you're feeling like a little on the edges suicidal, this will put you right over the edge last days with Michael Pitt.
Johnny Cash 36. I mean, I like Johnny Cash, okay, but I just, I don't know.
He's like two four. Well, a lot of these in the top 10. I just, but then again, that's your taste. You know what bad taste I have in music.
Oh, that ring of fire, man. Every time you sit down on it, it hurts like that.
Correct. Don't say Henry Song.
Okay, don't we have a thing like that?
Yes, we did. What's it called? You don't know what it's called. I don't think it's a, I saw fire or something.
Oh, is it asked on fire? What I got one here asked before we can't play that.
Oh, you asked me to give it to you.
By the way, it hurts.
I'm coming.
I bought it.
I'm coming.
Anyway, that's joy. She's the bad ass. She's part of the Trinity man. Don't ever forget it.
The evil J's. Josh Joe and Joyce. That's Josh Darrow. By the way, one like, you know, you're going to have to change your name.
Look, we've been through this. Just kind of over here. Huh? Just call him. Yeah, but Karen still begin with a J.
Okay, okay. It just doesn't fit in.
When you cast 37 Marvin Gaye 41, Roy the boy 45, Elvis 49. Our audience is not really like Elvis intensive.
But we're very satisfied with that because he's highly overrated.
He was a great innovator and a great entertainer and Vegas.
Very good.
Very good.
Very good.
Very good.
Very good.
Very good.
Very good.
Most of the gym Morrison 72. Now we're talking. That's more up my alley, Sally. In fact, I could, I mean, I don't want to, I got the album over on the side there.
But I'm not going to do that or get used to.
Okay.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Oh, that's not the time of the year for that.
Uh, Jim Morrison 72 Bob Marley 86 and John Lennon wins hands down your pants 152.
Okay, there you go. That's, that's enough. Same bed.
Oh, so I got to find the Yoko story before I go through what I'm going to do.
Is I'm going to go through my inquiry here. I'm going to go page by page and then I will select take a vote among three of us.
And of course, then I'll read whatever stories I feel like. I mean, what's everyone's you think I should.
Oh, no, here it is.
You will love it. You got to get this issue. I'm telling you take up a collection on the street corner there and you can get the a bucket of half to buy it.
Yoko goes local while getting Botox shot.
And it's a picture of her all freaked out here with the shades on. Oh, man, with her mouth wide open like that.
Those those giant goggles. She's always wearing. Yeah. Yoko auto had a Botox breakdown. Oh, no.
I mean, 73 year old widow, a former beat.
John Lennon went berserk and a Beverly Hills doctor's orifice refusing to let the doctor into the exam room until he showed identification.
Them throwing a tantrum after the Botox shot didn't show immediate results.
Oh, God.
It's a bad guy.
I don't have any. He was pretty me as himself. You know, he would not look at that's right.
But he could be a little bit of a rock. His money in his fame is a rock star. He could do a little bit of my face.
Anybody, but you know, Yoko recently booked an appointment for Botox treatments with celebrity dermatologist, Dr. Arnold Klein, hoping to get rid of a few wrinkles before a photo shoot.
She had scheduled for the following day. She thought that some Botox would help her look younger when the photo is a source told the inquire.
The source also said that Yoko was nervous right before the appointment consumed by the bizarre notion that fans might follow her to Dr. Klein's or a fist and try to impersonate him.
I mean, not paranoid. You understand? Not like, what a little bit like that. Oh, she's perfect for our management team.
Who made Yoko no figure with the J? Yoko was waiting in one of the treatment rooms on the doctor knocked on the door. Yoko asked her is ID?
Are you serious, the doctor asked her? Yoko was planned that she had to be careful because she was an LA for a photo shoot and people were following her.
Dr. Klein showed his ID and Yoko lit him in. He gave Yoko the Botox shots and handed her a mirror.
And when she saw her reflection, she threw a fit. She pitched a fit. She started, well, if you know, if I look like Daniel, then they're at pitch a fit too.
In fact, I'll let you. I do. She started screaming that she couldn't see any difference in that for all the money he's charging.
She should notice an immediate change. She then stormed out of the office in a fit of rage about three hours later. Yoko called the doctor for nearly 20 minutes.
She apologized for how she acted and blamed her behavior on nervousness because she'd never had Botox shots before.
Oh, shot a good shot. That's the kind. Dr. Klein was polite and accepted her apology.
Yoko's PR and Miss Yoko went to see Dr. Klein for consultation but said there was no Botox treatment. She did not leave angry. Right.
Her gigantic publicity machine.
Man, now what? And Julian, is that the kid Julian learning? Yes.
Does he? Is he looking kid? No. Does he sing good? No, but other than that.
Man, they all got it from mommy, I guess. Don't go see the omen by the way if you want to do something useful, go out and rent or buy the DVD, the original one.
And that's some good advice. Now we asked that I said, I said, maybe you watch the you see the omen? Yeah, I said, I haven't.
Huh? I said, I haven't. You have an omen? Yeah. Pretty good, huh? The one with Gregory Peck. I have not seen it.
You have it, but you haven't seen it. I have not. Oh, you have it. I said you have it. You have it. They're just hearing things today.
Yeah, it must be my ears are plugged up. That's what it was. I get the clang of the machines going.
You'll be pleased to know by the way. Yeah. Then I got my clothes on. I even got my shoes on. Are you going to make a bad?
Huh? You can make a mad dash downstairs for that disc. Don't you think that's a good idea? I do, especially since one of the bits on there is a...
It's what? There's a bit on there called. One moment please. Jolly Raleigh Jove. Yeah, what's that about? I don't know.
Can I hear the... Oh, good. Now let's see, I got to figure out, okay, George Bush, I hope for one free. Too much Oprah is so far. I've got another Oprah story coming.
Oprah writes to Star Jones Rescue. I got all kinds of... I like I said we'll go to the... I'm here. I'm here.
And we'll do it the diplomatic way. We'll take a photo among the three of us and I wonder where I say that's the one I'll read.

This is 5.62 A.M.
On the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority, Neil God.
Right down the house, where the mudwings go to hang from trees and play vanjouk.
You got some cool old, a station on, newfangled, rainy old.
Now, as North Carolina goes, rallies a big city at all.
And that's where the beesleaves had to go for Goli, Riley Jones.
On the G.M.
He'll do what he can.
Shake your hand like a friend.
Then quickly walk away.
They had Joe go to 5.6.0 with ratings and the toilet mold to get those
blaming for the most in order and control.
And then so Goli, Riley, Joe, above you were and in the know he let's move.
Go and hear what blows Gisgeldy is on show.
He'll make a big change and read a rave.
It's worse or the same.
He hasn't done a thing for what goes on the air at two.

Not that essentially blows for all radio.
The G.M. of 5.6.0.
Jolly, Riley, Joe.
Oh, you're right.
That was worth the Russian downstairs and coming back.
That was a record.
Would you do the fire escape?
No.
Hey, I just got a tattoo with science, man.
I know.
I was on an elevator and I zip right on down and I zip right out there to the orifice
and he knows who I am and he hands me my package.
And quite frankly, this is one of the most exquisite packages I've seen in a long time.
Really?
And I've seen quite a few.
That's all I know that.
No, I've got some good stuff in here.
You've got your 70s hits disc with all my good stuff there which for later on.
And then KJ disc which you never even warned me about this.
I told you about it a while back.
It just got me well.
If you want me to be horny and illegal Latino.
Yeah.
Have these been censored?
Have they been screened approved by the FCC and the SPCA and the TRIPLExerina?
Well, I already played them a couple times during the vacation days.
And Jolly Rolly, Joe, man.
That's worth the price that is going on here right there.
That was special.
That was sensational.
WCYM Hello.
Can I see the wheel?
Yes, speaking.
Hey, meal.
Yeah.
I should put a two-pack on there.
Two-pack.
There's a bit more for you to do.
Okay.
I'm going to put him on there and put a six-pack on there too.
Two-pack.
Put a little biggie on there while we're out.
Put biggie smalls on there, huh?
What do you say were smally bigs?
Hello big.
Yeah, see.
We don't care what color these people are or what they ate for breakfast.
We just want to know who your favorite did recording artists.
So that's all.
You don't have to make a big racial fang over like that one guy, right?
Right.
All right.
That's just, I don't understand people.
They'll be like saying, well, what about Cecilia?
We know you don't like Latino, but that's what you think.
Oh, you're dreaming.
Oprah speaking of dark.
She's the kind of like mocha, I would say.
Right?
The star, Jones, rescue.
Oh, boy.
Aren't you excited about that?
And you want that story or not?
Yeah.
Well, I want to know what the deal is.
OK, I'm going to wind up buying this magazine anyway.
Oh, you're going to have it.
What's happening, Neil?
Yes, sir.
I just want to let you know that Cooper City is the safest city in the state of Florida
because the PSO has got a griffin road covered.
All right.
Like, stick on, like, stick on Joe.
OK, thanks for the good news.
There's a little big report for you.
What was that guy talking about yesterday?
Your buddy, the boomer about we don't do this fire.
Wasn't that him that said that?
That we don't do purports anymore.
True we do.
Not our fault.
We do what people call them with them if they don't call in.
Right.
And that's probably because we're out of touch.
You know, I'm out of touch.
How many QYM, hello?
Hey, Neil, how you doing today?
OK, sir.
Pretty good.
Son of Shining.
Yeah, it is.
The Shining.
I let you open up during that Joe Avald bit.
My ear opened up.
How about Bobby Daren?
Oh, yeah.
How could we say it, Mack?
He was great.
Thanks a lot, Pally.
OK, good-bye.
Have a good time.
Am I going to have to dig out that Bobby Daren disc again?
No, I thought it was.
I got it.
I got it all.
Here we go.
Beyond the sea.
Bobby was all right by the way.
That's where Bobby is now, America.
Somewhere beyond the sea.
And he was not a drunk and I was San Rodeeta was a drunk and we don't have to rehash all
of this stuff.
We did anyway.
Well, I feel bad about that.
Because there are, I mean, there's some things that you can say about, you know, performers.
Like William Holden.
He was a drunk.
He was following his dab with a bottle in his hand.
But he's a great actor.
And I think I just, the big William Holden fan.
But, weren't none of us perfect.
And in a lot of cases, these artists are pretty good.
He's artists.
Yeah.
Singarols, partyers.
Perfect.
Because they have a lot of money.
Right.
Just like a lot of these athletes, these young punk athletes and the job is to get all that
money and all of a sudden they take a powder.
People kissing their ass, feet, and you ask, you do the wrong.
Too much money when you're two young man is back.
Just send it to us.
We're all the right now.
We're responsible.
In fact, Josh Kortis said he just turned old enough that you can send him any slap over money
you've got.
And all you young punks, it's going to, you know, get you into deep crap.
Right.
I'm ready now.
Just be sure that I take that money and be real.
It's possible with it.
That's right.
They'll be staggering in about 5.30 in the morning, most days, but nevertheless, they'll be
having a hell of a time.
All for Winfrey is daughterful, supporting high-talk show, Deva Star Jones, as rumors swirl
that her day, and that's a true story, by the way, about my ear opening up as soon as I've
played that.
Oh, God.
Maybe if I turn my head the other way.
Rumors swirl that her days on the view are numbered star.
According to Insiders Oprah, recently we'd stopped to the 44-year-old star Oprah's 52,
and what's it, in Vannis 98, who has repeatedly been devastated since her nemesis Rosie O'Donnell
was hired to take over for co-host Meredith Vera in the fall.
That's Meredith who's going to the, today's show, where place Katie Currick was going to
the news, which I ain't going to watch.
The star was close to tears when she heard Barbara Waldo's hired Rosie because she felt
she was being squeezed out.
Oh.
If you were inside a reveal, how'd you like to squeeze that out of a tube?
Out of a what?
Chew!
The star took it as a personal slap in the face from Barbara and her boss.
But for Oprah, this is not just about protecting stars.
Also pay back to Barbara Walters for giving Oprah's former on-air life skills expert, Ian
Ella Van Zandt, her own show.
Aha.
Well, I tell you about Teddy people, you know?
Really?
Oprah's former eye, let's see.
Her own show.
At the time, Oprah was trying to convince Ian Ella to sign an exclusive agreement with
her, and then she's also fuming with Dr. Phil.
Take a pill and a tube you just lock off the edge of the earth.
Oprah didn't get angry with Barbara Orianna, but she didn't forget it either.
And now it's time to give it even.
Pay back is a bitch, bitch.
Oprah didn't appreciate Ian Ella leaving to show her two thousand work for Barbara.
Oprah's the one who really discovered her in the first place.
You don't want to hear the rest of this, do you?
Oh.
This is just the highlights.
That's enough.
Ian Ella, 52, promoted with their own stuff titles show in two thousand.
And was quickly canceled after one season.
So now Oprah's stepping in to help star just to stick it to her.
This thing about Jessica and Nick, for instance, so we don't care about them, do we?
I mean, I don't care about Nick anymore because he's, you know, I feel about him the same way you feel about Brittany, you know?
Yeah, tainted by your girlfriend Jessica.
Really?
Let's paint her fault.
Yeah, it is.
Jessica Simpson and Nick, well, I just want to straighten this out because we have the wrong information and Josh is very big on Ashley Simpson.
Yeah, the negative one.
Oh, good.
Jessica Simpson and Nick let's chase impending divorces, turning it into an all-out family feud.
Well, let's get Richard Dawson under the mediator.
Drew, who wants vowed not to take sides and their siblings split, has stepped up into the fray.
Ashley and Nick's brother drew.
I had let Mr. a couple of words there.
Get very emotional when I think about this.
Up until recently Ashley maintained a good friendship with Drew and his wife, a family friend told Ian Quarer,
Ashley and Drew are still considering each other in laws and bumped into each other all the time.
So to speak.
But now they've stopped talking because blood is thicker than water and each one is now supporting their sibling.
Ashley's publicist Rob Shooter denied any hard feelings.
Oh, let's do it.
Ashley gave Drew and his wife a gift after they maybe was born.
Shooter she even called him after his win on dancing with the stars.
You know who he is?
He's Nick's younger brother that was in 98 degrees who can't sing.
He looks like hell and he's got no talent.
In fact, I think he and Ashley would be a good match.
Okay.
Because it was related to somebody who was, you know, much better known, who had at least some kind of talent, although I don't know what Jessica's was.
And they have no talent at all.
Well, just what you see, that's a talent.
And I, yeah, at least Nick can sing.
I know you would disagree with that. He's pretty good.
I didn't deny that.
Yeah, and now they had some pretty good news.
Of all the boy bands, I would say that they were the ones that could really sing.
And the best read for is had a couple of songs that even you admitted were pretty, but then again, like we said,
and I recording studio in Sweden, they could make the three of us sound like, you know,
you could have had a couple of good songs.
That's right.
That's something you need.
Big hits, man.
And I recording studio in Sweden.
Well, let's see.
Keith's pal warns don't marry Nicole.
Do we care if we don't care about Nicole Kim and doing?
No.
No.
Hard working lady, Marmalade, not in money, Jan.
Patty Lebel is working like a dog and she's selling her house.
Do we care about if Patty Lebel know, but I'll tell you who we do care about.
Speaking of recording artists who might be dead pretty soon.
Who?
Get lost fast, girl.
Get lost fast, baby.
Jan Lennon.
Hey, sister.
Yeah.
Oh, no.
Okay, that's enough of Patty.
I even five star restaurants.
I take major trips and take four girlfriends with me and I pay for all of them, says Patty.
So if I was broke, obviously I couldn't afford to be doing it.
I thank God every day for my blessings and that only enough.
She works hard but not for the money.
Work and for the money.
What's that song?
I don't know what that song.
It's got a suburb.
Yeah, that's it.
Emergency heart surgery for Mary Wilson.
And for Mary Wilson.
Mm-hmm.
Thought a bitter 30-year feud.
Fought 30 men.
With Diana Ross, which only ended in 1994 when Mary's son Raphael, 14, died in a car crash.
Mary was driving the car.
And now, and then she didn't have enough tourists as they say in the darker parts of Detroit
tourists, where did it go, honey?
That's right.
Motown legend Mary Wilson made a mad dash to the emergency room.
Terrified she was suffering a massive heart attack.
The 62-year-old singer was at the Vegas, at her Vegas home on a sudden painstruck,
doubled over, gripping her, Cheshey told her daughter to get to the hospital before it was too late.
Mary was in agony.
It was clear it was in her.
It was her heart and it was very serious.
Her daughter was an nervous wreck while she waited for word about mom.
Finally, Ches revealed that Mary's pain had been a warning sign of a potential heart attack.
She had five blocked in an arteries due to cholesterol buildup.
They relieved Warbler underwent a successful angioplasty.
They relieved Warbler.
Not a great line.
So, this was a wake up, yeah, okay.
Okay, I'll get that thing.
I'll say, Cecilia message.
This is a new Roger.
This is 5.69 A.L.
This is more than it even.
And this portion of the new Roger's are your 12-to-1 hour.
It's brought to you by the Liddett 12,
one two group of bite tickets,
seven eight, nine, ten eleven, twelve.
So, lices of pizza, all for me.
And air, up, up, up, up, up.
See, you wanna get married?
Well, let me give you some advice.
If you wanna be, you wanna bother us in your life.
Always make a Jewish woman in your wife's home
from the bite person who's going to be a Jew.
Yeah, that shits us a very Jew.
If you wanna be, you wanna bother us in your life.
Always make a Jewish woman in your wife's home
from the bite person who's going to be a Jew.
You should never marry a Jew.
A Jewish wife is like a ghost.
I can't think of anything else.
All she ever wants to do is shop.
Take your credit card and never stop.
Show, show, interest, add on and sexy.
She only cares about your paycheck.
You are never gonna get laid.
You'll regret the commitment you need.
If you wanna be, you wanna bother us in your life.
Always make a Jewish woman in your wife's home
from the bite person who's going to be a Jew.
Yeah, that shits us a very Jew.
If you wanna be, you wanna bother us in your life.
Always make a Jewish woman in your wife's home
from the bite person who's going to be a Jew.
You should never marry a Jew.
When your honey moon is finally through
there are things she's never gonna do.
She only cares about her nails and hair.
And I'd up there about what's down there.
You are gonna feel like a smock
because you're never gonna get the clue.
Find out how it feels to be.
A journey of recklessness and celibacy.
If you wanna be, you wanna bother us in your life.
Always make a Jewish woman in your wife's home
from the bite person who's going to be a Jew.
Yeah, that shits us a very Jew.
If you wanna be, you wanna bother us in your life.
Always make a Jewish woman in your wife
who's going to be a Jew.
You should never marry a Jew.
Oh, I know.
I know.
So as long as you would say this package today
was a real bonanza, wouldn't you say?
Wow, yeah.
So speaking of getting hitched, this just in.
That's because we're so newsy on this show.
We know what's going on in the world.
Even though Norma keeps saying,
Norma just sent me an email and said,
President Lincoln, love the play.
Go away, Norma.
Okay, pack, maybe the four of you.
Joyce and Josh Dero and Joe and Norma.
Maybe they can all elope.
Senate blocks same sex marriage ban.
The Senate today blocked a bid to amend a Constitution
to essentially ban same sex marriage.
Nobody gives a crap about this,
except of course the gay people wanna get married.
And then we got that other story just from a Toronto game out.
He's planning to wait this month.
I could use some lines for that, but I'll, we'll get to that.
Republicans pushed a plan,
even though supporters conceded the measure,
never had enough votes to pass.
Opponents failed to get the 60 votes needed
to end debate and move to a vote on the actual amendment.
The Senate vote was 49 to 48 to end debate.
Opponents called the measure in election year
before that wasted precious time on the legislative calendar
and your tax dollars.
That's so moving, correct.
This is not about the preservation of marriage.
This is about the preservation of a majority
said Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois
as debates started there.
I think sadly most people realize there's political motivation here
while the understatements of the century.
Republican Senators said 45 states have passed laws
or constitutional amendments, the finding marriages
of a pact between a man and a woman.
I wonder if Utah is one of those.
The voice of the people has been heard loud and clear
since Senator Wayne Allen Republican
of Colorado, a real right-wing unshaste
where the Iraqis are busy having their prayer,
their prayer ends.
And by the way, they keep looking,
what are they lost like five in a row since that story
came out something like that?
They're going to be terrorists.
They suck.
So if God has helped them to their several game under 500 record,
you can only imagine maybe they'll start praying to Satan.
Maybe they'll change their name to the devil Rockies.
Although they haven't held them the devil race too much,
the real emphasis behind the debate was to energize conservative voters this fall.
See it ends then, a bash reported with a,
a bash with that little stash?
Uh-huh.
Those conservatives feel like Republicans
they've sent to Washington,
they've sort of turned their backs on them on key issues that they care about.
I'm the bigoted issues, you know, like same-sex marriage, like hate.
I'm the good old age right.
Senator Ted Kennedy denounced the proposed amendment
as an instrument of bigotry and prejudice,
which he said was designed by the GOP leadership
to try to bring Republican Senators
out of the ditch of this approval.
Senator Minority Leader Harry Reid
and Nevada Democrats said the reason the Senate Republicans are pushing this marriage
amendment is because they don't want to arrest the real issues of the country.
Well, what's easier, you know,
ending the war in Iran or like picking on fangs again, you know,
finding another scapegoat.
If the Jews didn't do it, then certainly the dark folks did.
And if it wasn't them, it was the beeners done,
and if not that, all the fangs.
All of these, uh...
All of these things.
Kicks.
Okay, some of the beeners might be fangs.
And some of them might be pretty dark too, you never know.
That's right.
So there you go.
Toronto.
It promises to be a grand june wedding.
They better hurry up and do it though before Stephen Harper loses his head about this issue.
That's true.
When I saw that story on the news,
about the terrorist one,
they were going to like storm the parliament in Ottawa,
and they were going to like slice off Stephen Harper's head.
Don't touch!
And I kept thinking to myself,
how could you really tell, you know,
or there's no sense, there's no feeling?
It promises to be a grand june wedding,
two scarlet coated officers of the famed Republican Indian Montenegro,
mounted police,
and we use that term mounted very loosely,
standing before a justice of the piece with an escort of similarly spiffy mountains,
observing the nuptials,
on the eve of candidate day, an actual holiday.
When the two constables become the first male Mounties to marry each other,
the grumpiest witness from afar might well be,
Prime Minister Stephen Harper.
Yeah.
The planned union of Jason Tree, 27,
and David Conner's 20th, Nova Scotia on June 30th.
Absolutely.
But third, man!
Has cast a spotlight on Harper's pledge to his conservative backers
to try to wall back same-sex marriage laws?
You know, he's like Bush Light.
Harper hasn't spoken publicly about the upcoming wedding,
and has ordered his party members to keep mum about the matter.
Harper's attempt to silence lawmakers has served the drum more attentively issue,
while sparking complaints about the Prime Minister's heavy handiness.
Last July, a candidate's parliament nearly approved same-sex marriage
just throughout the country.
I think it's great if we change the public perception said Tree.
Is that Tree Crawford? I never knew.
If the public sees the RCMP is representing the diversity of the community,
that is good.
The two men that have been calling eight years ago,
they've been partners since.
They've been Mounties ever since.
How do you like that?
I had a line there, but I don't just let it go.
Don't do it. Don't do it.
No.
Because the... I'm Tonya.
Trinity Broadcasters.
The Colorado has no problem at all.
Speak out of her.
This is a great headline.
And back to the inquire,
which is where the good stuff is.
Radio's gone to the dogs, and I would say...
Absolutely correct, sir.
And it's got a picture of a pooch who's got like a...
He's got shades. This is cute.
He's got shades on, and he's got a... like a walkman.
He's got a camp and a walkman on it.
Cute.
He's lounging.
Man's best friend can now rock and roll over for two internet radio stations.
dogcatradio.com and dogradio-tylean.com.
Both stations say they provide pet-friendly tips and tunes such as
Baja Man's Who Let The Dogs Up and Elvis Presley's How Dog.
Kind of a limited playlist, I would think, wouldn't you?
There are a lot of more dog sounds than that.
dogcatradio.com, which is on Slice, July, is not just for your pampered pooch, though.
The stations manage your operations.
Desmarque Tinas claims that it's designed to satisfy the appetite of all the
music hungry animals, including snakes and horses.
If you think that there would be a big audience for a pet project like this,
you're barking up the wrong tree.
dogcatradio.com got off to such a big start, especially in Chicago,
that it crashed its first weekly and its website was overloaded by people trying to
download programming all at once.
And dogradio-tylean.com is actually looking for keen-eyed DJs.
One of the main qualifications that he or she must be good at barking is
an operator on you pan a bunshin.
Now that's a howler, it says.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, what a cool, yeah.
Mike Walker's got says gossip-com.
Here's the anything we really care about.
Others one you might be interested in.
It's about Tom Cruise.
You fairy.
Mike Walker writes folks have been sleeping a lot better lately.
I know why.
Tom Cruise is praying for Mike Walker.
Inside his reveal at Tom, fed up with what he apparently perceives as
persistently lousy press and started praying for journalists to make negative
comments about him.
The lord of intergalactic cruise control calls such newsmen aberrations
defined by Scientology as those afflicted by departure from rational thought
and is praying for the supreme being the grand them redemption.
Thanks Tom, that's why you're my favorite alien since Mike Walker.
Our favorite alien is in Cuba.
Isn't he all our favorite alien?
He is.
New trial for Scott Peterson is here.
I didn't know about that.
Did you?
No, I didn't.
I saw his ugly push on TV, though.
In fact, they were showing him on death row.
And there's this lawyer that what's that jerk's name with a mustache?
Well, what is his name?
You know.
You know the one I'm talking about.
The one that looks like a real slump.
I can't think of any name.
He's a driver.
Yeah, he's a driver.
Not that kind of a mustache.
No, this guy was also Michael Jackson's lawyer for about five minutes.
Not Robert Kardashian.
No, Robert Kardashian is dead.
Although this guy, when he's sitting there with his hand on his pussy, looks kind of dead too.
Anyway, his name's not a mystery, damn it.
Plus, we don't care about it anyway, do we?
Not really.
Scott Peterson can walk out of prison to free man incredibly.
It's all because the jurors who send a death row from murdering his wife and wife, wife,
wife, Lace Amborn, son, Connor in 2002.
Seven jury members are collaborating to write a behind the scenes book on the shocking case.
One of them were shall nice.
Oh, she's so nice.
Recently admitted she's been exchanging letters with the fertilizer salesman turned convicted.
Killer since August.
Reportedly titled, we the jury deciding Scott Peterson's paid the jury to allow scheduled
for fall release.
But that book gets got a new trial in centimepri.
Legal experts say, Scott's letters will examine the book and those letters with a fine tooth comb.
For any hint of juror misconduct, it could be grounds for it.
So, it's very speculative, I think it's said.
He ain't going nowhere.
They're going to fry his ass.
It's a sudden example.
What about Charlie Manson?
Can we change the law retroactive?
Right.
I mean, he didn't kill anybody after all.
He could sit like in the Scott's lap when he pulled a swish.
12 minutes passed noon at 5.
60 W. Killing our Curtis Stevenson for a nice short hour there.
Two to three this afternoon tough assignment.
Marlon's on deck at three.
Oh my god, those red hot white icy hot Marlon's against the Giants 335.
Gildi at the NBA finals.
Seven o'clock tonight.
A lot of that talk no doubt in the 80K-10.
You know, I was reading an article about the four most in termites.
In the heraldous morning, you see that?
No.

This is Neil Roger.
This is 516-Q-A-S.
The O's bomb's a sparkle in the nose.
It's a secret deep in the nose.
Right, that energize mushroom cloud everyone is cold on the dive.
There's no good share of the mega touch.
It's gonna make the ultimate look.
And even bring the small little hammer close.
Bye bye bye.
Bye bye bye.
Bye bye bye.
The baby's not so kneel so I know it just stands to blow it.
Go hide and rule.
You will be amazed.
That's the secret.
They take traitors who's retarded enough.
But now you know where Blakely is J.
Yeah, there's gonna drop the bomb 90 miles north.
But you're still gonna be used as fire.
That ain't the first time that he's seen by this time.
It's not funny.
He keeps smiling.
Well, when it's over you may see on the news.
O's is gonna show I've got a thing on to my music.
Love is through a flow in.
Bye bye.
And all say this.
Bye bye.
Bye bye.
Oh no.
I think that was the escalator.
And I'm too soon.
From 19 to 5, 60 WQM.
So was J. tell me that you liked the escalator.
We had a very brief discussion.
No, I liked the New York New York.
Oh, that's the one that you got testy.
But I'll be honest with you.
The first time I went in there, they just opened it.
And I got a little bit lucky in there.
I want a few bucks at the slot machines.
But I just go back in.
It's so damn tacky.
I just don't like it.
Well, your taste is in your touch.
Well, good for you.
Okay.
Taste this.
I like the MGM just fine.
And I, I said it place.
I said it place.
It did not impress me all that much.
Okay.
That everybody raves about.
And that was the Bellagio.
First of all, I'm not in the art.
I'm just an old slob.
I don't care about art.
And the one thing about the casino in the Bellagio is it could be, after a while, most of them start looking like anywhere else.
I mean, you're in the middle of a whole bunch of tables and slot machines.
And, you know what I mean?
Unless you're in the casino, so many of them look the same.
Am I right about that?
Yeah, you're right about that.
I think you judge things a little differently, though, because I don't really gamble.
So, I think you're judging.
That's because you can't afford to gamble.
No, no, that's not true at all.
I don't, I don't, I don't remember one any money in the MGM.
I mean, I hit a couple of small jackpots, you know, like a thousand or something like that.
I never did anger there.
But I just think it's a beautiful place.
It's great.
Yes.
A place that I like that's old and dumpy is the start-us.
I've had a lot of luck in there, but I certainly wouldn't say it's one of the great casinos on the strip, but start-us is okay.
And then it closed down at Dan Little Diner these days.
And then at 50s, a Diner, oh, that pissed me off.
I forget the name of that.
Although they still have the FLM chocolates placed in there.
Stay away from that. It's dangerous.
I'm trying to find out.
I'm seizures.
You know, seizures, I mean, they got great shops and they got a couple of okay restaurants.
I never had that big pick out.
What's that Italian, the thing that we can't never think of the name of it, the feast begins with a B.
Bucket out.
Bucket out, very good.
But, I don't know.
And as far as gambling in there, it's very of a week's selection of everything.
It's a Tide in there.
It's a place to go shop and drop a lot of cash.
A place for a plastic bag like a heat state shop.
Although I didn't see it in the week's Miguel at the seizures.
He was great.
I was the week's Miguel on this disc or not.
Is that the one you were making?
The one I'm making right now.
Daniel, next one.
Okay.
Oprah versus Dr. Phil Fude boils over.
Two people we hate.
I don't know.
I hate him worse.
Although, it's kind of a tough choice.
It's a tough one.
I hate him equal because he's just like a male clone of her.
Yeah.
Yeah, but at least, you know, she did her thing first, you know.
Go for good or bad.
This is true.
And then all of a sudden she made him into a, you know, she's kind of like the Dr. Frankenstein monster.
He's like Dr. Frankenstein.
He could always kiss her ass no matter what because without her heat.
That's right.
You could put his talent in a thimble and have room for the Chinese army left over.
Oprah Winfrey and Dr. Phil McGraw's rocky relationship has exploded over a battle to land an exclusive interview with 32-year-old Mary.
I was going to say, you know, the Paris is the one casino in Vegas where it's totally unique.
Have you ever been in that one, Jay?
Yes, I have.
Now, that part where you're like, it's got the phony sky.
You know, and you feel like you're outside.
And they got all the machines outside.
That's the neat casino.
It's just totally unique and different from any of the other ones.
It doesn't just look like another place with a lot of machines, man.
Anyway, getting back to Oprah and Dr. Phil, the important stuff.
A battle to land an exclusive interview with 32-year-old mom Mary Winfrey,
the Tennessee mom of three accused of killing her minister husband.
And sources say that neither one of them in playing nice.
Both Oprah and Dr. Phil are accusing each other trying to play dirty,
traced the land that Jay will have sit down with Mary.
Oh, Jay will have sit down.
Put your love that word.
Yeah, yeah.
Police alleged that Mary executed her husband,
and forced to reach a Christ preacher, Matthew Winkler, 31,
by shooting him in a back with a shotgun, March 22.
Although she pleaded not guilty, she's currently being held in jail in summer Tennessee.
Both Oprah 52 and Dr. Phil 55, her former protégé,
have been working overtime to land the blockbuster chat,
and the bad blood existed between them and seated to the boiling point.
Bad blood.
Who the hell did that song?
Bad blood.
Oh, that's right.
Very good.
How come I didn't think of that right away?
All service.
Bad blood.
Get out of here, man.
Next thing you're going to tell me,
Daniel Sedac is gay.
No, but put it back.
He is.
Oh, let's see.
Here's one.
Where's your favorite and mine on the poll?
ODB, old dirty.
About 30.
Unless they're old dirty, about 30 on there.
And you don't have to left off, even though I also tweeted,
put a, I hate this poll is not on there.
Oh.
So first it was the carpenters they stiffed me with,
and now you're going to get old dirty on there.
I may have to play that bit a lot,
and I'm getting tired of that, aren't you?
Yeah, the little tire bit.
I'm not tired of readjust, too.
I like readjust, but you know something?
It's like, I always told you about banana splits.
I love a banana split.
Of course I can't have one now anyway, but, you know,
after the first seven or eight,
it starts getting a little bit heavy, you know?
It gets to be a little bit much in one sitting.
865 volts.
I think we've had it made, dammit.
How do you like that?
Who is your favorite dead singer?
John led in 168.
They can't touch John.
Not anymore.
Bob Marley, 97.
Well, who'd hell would want to?
Jim Morrison, 75.
He touched it.
Elvis, 56.
Oh, it's in Q56.
Let's go all Elvis all day.
I mentioned we could beat the numbers we got now.
And you know, I was thinking in the elevator on that real quick trip.
When I'm right, I'm right, and when I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
And in this one case, I have to hand it to you right.
That's what?
These people that are running this outfit, you know,
these crazy people, they really believe that they can take it like,
like interchangeable parts.
They can put anybody on here, and as long as they're talking about
the same sports crowd, it doesn't make any difference.
It's still like, it's a winning form.
It's all good.
And that's why we got zeros and ones most of the day,
you know, because they believe that.
That's right.
And if they really do believe that, how come they're paying,
paying Hank in the mad dog all that money?
You know, the fact that they got most of everybody on the wrong day part,
that's, you know, that's just an accident, I guess.
Anyway, let's not start on that, but you're right.
They really believe that.
I never thought anybody could be that stupid, but that's how much they know about this business.
Nothing.

8.69.
No, we got that thousand licked.
Aren't you proud of us?
I am.
I was a little bit skeptical there.
How you getting me in on me?
I never had.
And it's for this crowd.
You never like to take anything for granted.
When you've worked a hundred years in this market,
you realize how lazy.
Well, you know, lazy.
Plus, it's a hundred reasons to shave.
Anyway, should pat your shoulder first.
Sure, right here, though.
I'll tell you that because I know
Castor Nova is taking notes on the Toronto weather.
So, they shine it.
It is just, oh, look at that.
It's already 73 degrees, man.
And it's going to be like in the low 80s today.

What's that?
Let's see.
24.75.
77.
And I have about 83.
Another sighting?
That's a...

There's not a cloud in the sky on it.
It's a beautiful day.
And I'm sitting here doing this crap.
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
I'm taking a Ferris Boehler day off.
I should be doing that.
And that's a good poll idea to go ahead.
And what is your favorite thing to do on days when you screw off from work?
I don't know.
I never done that.
I don't think I ever did that.
You do it all the time for tend to be sick.
Oh, yeah.
You don't have to be sick the throughout the day.
Well, nobody could be sick as much.
Josh, do you believe anybody could be sick as much as he claims to be?
Yeah, we believe it.
No, no, it's true because he's got a sick house.
That's right.
He's got the kids and the wife and the dog.
It's like a two-month edition there.
It's like a leopard colony in there, huh?
Yeah, it is.
28 past.
That's how we feel here at QAM.
We feel like we're a leopard colony in the middle of the sports.
It's like a clean right.
Unclean.
They're not talking about the right.
Like those cows we get from out of town.

12.35 a.m.
Pride and prejudice, Macy's young's gay display blasted by both sides.
If you could see these mannequins, these are two guys with boobies.
Yeah. Macy's department store found itself married in a fierce national debate between conservatives and gay activists when it bought the complaints and removed part of a windows play marking
Boston Pride Week.
The downtown crossing store display featured two male mannequins, one wearing a gay pride rainbow flag around its waist,
standing near a list of several planned Boston Pride events.
The display was designed by Macy's with the approval of Boston Pride Committee.
But the story yanked the mannequins from the window.
After Macy's resistance, the conservative group formerly named Article 8 Alliance, which is also campaigned against sex education and gay themed books in public schools,
complained that the display was offensive.
Sounds like a bunch of far-biz and a goiim to me, so not.
They were male mannequins with enlarged breasts and one was wearing a skirt.
Oh yeah, I didn't even notice that.
Said master's-istence president Brian Kamikler, referring to the gay pride flag wrapped around one figure clenched with a white belt,
since it was really disgusting.
Yeah, I would agree with that.
Elina Kazan, the York-based spokesman from Macy said the decision to pull the dummies, but leave the rest of the display was an effort to strike a balance.
We believe in diversity.
Our customers are very important to us, Kazan told the hero.
That's the Boston hero.
Adding that display supporting pride we can previously do not use mannequins, but the display did affect a few of our customers and we had to re-examine it.
That decision of said gay activists, the mayor Thomas M. Menino, who spokesman said he was disappointed that Macy's with bond of this kind of pressure.
The mayor believed the window reflected the diversity of our city since spokesman Cife could tell.
This entire episode flies in the face of that.
Well, they're banned and lost in life, just about everything else except the Kennedy's.
Right?
Right.
Now let's see, getting back to the inquire, I'm interspersing in a few of these urgent stories that like Miss Fudge had on her website because it was gay.
You know that Macy Miss Fudge?
Oh Frank Zappa, oh my god.
How the hell could we have forgotten that Frank Zappa?
Here they are, people on Bob and Brown.
The sea on the queue is boiling down.
My car is fast, my teeth is shining.
I tell all the girls they can kiss my honey.
Welcome.
I'm Kira, and I'm not a famous school.
I'm Britain's job, and I'm acting dooms.
I got a cheerleader here and want to help with my fate.
But they're new all the work and maybe later I'll meet them.
Okay, that's enough.
That's enough of that, but we do like Frank Zappa a lot.
Yeah.
Well, you see you got to give a head start to the other ones, right?
That's right.
Here's a thanks from John who says go to this website, it's a riot, and it's got like a whole bunch of old words forks on it.
Okay.
Whatever you say to them.
We don't really rely not go to it, but we don't like to acknowledge that they're in.
There's no such thing as far as that's right.
It's an evil flag plot, and of course it has to do with it.
Correct.
Anything has to do with ass, it's obviously a fact thing.
Speaking of ass, here's a picture in it.
When you get this inquire of disgusting Rosanne Bar, looking even more disgusting than usual,
what is the size 85,000 of Rupert Blac's t-shirt that's just turned your television off.
And of course, if she's on, that's a good reason.
And she's got her son there, a book, and he's wearing two sneakers, different, in other words, an amount of mass pair.
One is blue, and another one is red.
I say, he must be stylish.
He's a fashion player, like, a man, I understand.
Oh, crew has raised his roof over raising the baby.
You're French.
Tommy!
Calm down, Tommy.
Katie demands non-scientology parodying class, and he's not too happy about it.
He looks really a porky.
New parents, Tom Cruise, and Katie Holmes.
All right, odds after she asked him to take a six-week non-scientology class on parenting for daughter Surrey,
and then told him she was having a new manager.
Now, is that the Surrey with a fringe on top?
That's Curry.
What?
Oh, it's spelled with a...
The other name is not Curry.
Her daughter's name is Surrey.
Surrey?
Surrey Surrey, yes.
And you'd be Surrey too if your daddy was Tom Cruise, because you know that he's...
Yeah.
Katie, matter of fact, where did you get that curry from?
You're stuck about Katie Kirk.
Now, Katie Kirk got married to Surrey.
Would that be Surrey Curry?
Oh, Tom?
Surrey.
Katie, matter of fact, told Tom, she wanted him to take a parenting class for Surrey with her.
One totally independent of the church, said a close friend, and of course the Scientology, church my ass.
It's the first time Katie's really put her foot down.
She's butchered up now.
She wants to be almost as butchers he is, which ain't saying much.
She told Tom that the class would teach them how to better manage their time, divide responsibilities,
and most importantly, allow them the chance to get some feedback from other parents.
Katie's demands left Tom speechless according to a close friend.
Speechless?
He immediately became defensive.
He told her he didn't need a tutorial on being a good parent as it raised two kids, those what he's doing.
But Katie dug in her heels and refused to back down according to the friend.
That's when she dropped another bombshell.
Katie announced she's looking for a new career management.
It's the first time she ever swayed from the well-timed course that Tom personally mapped out to me.
She's like a captive. She's like an abductee.
And then a way to look at her.
That's right.
Katie told Tom that she wants to start interviewing new managers, dental creative aspects of her career.
Tom was stunned, but Katie held her ground.
The bottom line is Katie is fed up with Tom's controlling ways to the source.
She loves him, but she's realizing she's not a little girl anymore.
She's a mother and actress and soon she'll be a wife.
Uh-huh.
It's like she's fine to discover she had a backbone.
She can't say no to Tom in the world won't end.
If she can say no, what she did.
And the world won't end as we knew it.
I'll believe that.
Wedding, what did I say?
Oh, Tom's got McFever, Tomcat.
Pal, say Tom Cruise and Katie, home has become such big fans of American Idol runner-up Catherine McFee
that they want the 20-wine-year-old son to sing a fair wedding.
I think it all kind of fits in real well.
Well, the other guy would have been more appropriate.
Huh?
The other guy would have been more appropriate.
Oh, no.
Not Taylor Hicks.
Who ain't do no chicks.
Unless they got well anyway.
Taylor, Tom and Katie have become Catherine's biggest fans as sort of sold a couple until the acquirer.
They think she's destined to become a singing legend.
Oh, yeah.
Just like that other guy in there.
What was the guy's name that Japanese guy?
Oh, William Hung.
William Hung.
And the answer is definitely not.
Good back to that guy that called earlier.
They was trying to steer the pot.
You know, remember that guy?
I was trying to steer the pot.
You're not fooling anybody, pal.
You're not fooling anyone on this side.
We've been around a block a whole bunch of times and look where we wound up.
Oh, God.
In the middle of a sports bar with a microphone.
Fuck.
But the pay is okay.
Nine, oh nine.
Now we got that thousand-licked easy.
I don't know what Josh is getting off freaked out about.
This is Meele Rogers.
I'm paid.
This is 5.16 Q.A.
You know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.
That's the movement.

If you have J.
L.O.
To adopt question mark has got a picture of here.
You talk about a Max Maiden Hell.
He had hoped to be pregnant by hubby mark Anthony before Mother's day.
If we know something.
Doesn't happen by osmosis is what I'm told.
Can't make nobody does that. No, not that way.
J. Low was devastated and her dream to be pregnant by mother's day failed to come to us.
So now she's considering adoption.
The 36 year old superstar with that gigantic ass still hopes the struggle visitor and heavy mark Anthony.
Oh man, he just looks like a still a tour.
Yeah, I'm not doing that story.
Oh, wait a minute. Tom and Katie's new baby.
You think it takes after mom or dad.
It's a picture of who is that the Tomcat baby is just a stuffed monkey that Katie was holding during Tom's
son Connor's baseball game. She got a stuffed monkey.
In fact, there's a better chance that the monkey got a pregnant than Tom, but oh, and look at this man.
You talk about.
Faming.
Man, oh man, Taylor Hicks.
You you've got to get this paper. You got to get it.
It's a magazine.
Taylor Hicks denies rumors from internet and his hometown.
Either winners gay shockers gay.
He blamed the fruity purple jacket. That's what it was.
Man,
jaws drop on clean cut clay.
Acid showed up at the American Idol finale looking like this race actor Paul Rubens P.
We Herman, but in 2003,
Votide Clay runner-up in American Idol's second season was the mirror image of Rubens D.
Key P. We Herman character and it's got the pictures here.
Oh, it's beautiful. Rubens is on probation for possessing obscene material with his Votide.
American Idol winner Taylor Hicks is caught up in a raging gay sex scandal.
I can't believe that. Can you?
Not ever. What a delicate.
The inquirer has learned that the silver here 29 year old backslur in all of a day over 50
has been the man target of nasty homosexual lies on the internet and his hometown Alabama.
They don't count to then kind Alabama.
And behind the scenes sources say the malicious gossip nearly kept Taylor from beating up
Catherine McFee on the Fox TV finale May 24 when he was crowned the fifth idol in front of 42 million
idiotic viewers.
Inside how they was co-act theater Taylor was freaking out that a queer smear would rob.
Oh no, a queer smear hits the smurious of all.
Yeah, I think I've been involved in a few of those.
He was freaking out that a queer smear would rob my victory and AI insider told the inquirer.
First he blamed a fruity purple velvet jacket that he wore and he was told there were rumors about his sexuality all over the place.
I think maybe just because he looks.
This was especially alarmed about gay comments posted on an AI internet blog.
Taylor was angry with one fan type Freddie Mercury or the band Queen was also gay and he too was an amazing vocalist said the idol insider.
See there you go.
That Freddie Mercury must have been psychic again.
A source added Taylor was even upset that viewers would think buddies and his audience cheering him on would be considered his gay lovers.
But he's in bunk, but he's in like a net.
And when the inquirer went to his hometown of Birmingham, Alabama, the place was a buzz with Taylor's gay talk.
Taylor's gay talk.
Maybe they'll do that across the street to have like lighten up the load of that heavy stuff they do on and on and on.
In fact, you know what? I think we had to let them talk about all that and do something else on this nation.
That's really an idea.
It's about a different kind of happening.
At the oldest gay bar in town, the quest club and employees told the inquirer the rumors about Taylor being gay got to such a point that I checked out whether we'd ever signed in as a club member.
He hadn't, but we would love it if he was gay.
I have one question for that.
Why?
Well, that's right. I forgot I saw that American idol of session with lifeless people.
Hicks' three performances in the openly gay 22nd Street jazz cafe also feel the Birmingham rumor mill.
Club owner Randy Harper told the inquirer, Taylor and his band played here last in 2004 and got a great reception.
It would be great if he was gay, but I haven't heard anything that makes me believe that he is.
One reason for the rumors may be that never married Hicks doesn't have a serious girlfriend.
Oh, it was only 29.
His grandma, Johnny Hicks 77, was quoted as saying, Taylor is married to his music right now.
You know what that means?
Gay.
Yeah, exactly.
That's code for gay.
That's right.
Married to his job. Kind of like kind of Alisa.
Gay.
Right.
Kind of like any, what's your name?
They say they're gay.
Any other answer.
Kind of like Miss Fudge.
Girlfriends require quite a bit of attention and time and that's what Taylor actually does not have now.
Taylor is not the first.
Taylor is not the first American Idol star to face gay rumours.
Play Aiken 2003 runner-up has long denied persistence speculation that he's had a fears with men.
You mean gay, Aiken?
Including Prince Charles.
Oh, and it's got a bunch of trivia for American Idol.
I'll say that for you.
You can read it when you buy a...
Oh, yeah.
You know, rap art solves around it tight.
Oh, here comes the part.
Here comes the piece of resistance, baby.
The piece with no resistance.
Seriously, it's right in the middle when you open up the middle fold of the magazine.
You'll see lots of folds.
In fact, they are called as La Page de Fools.
This is the stars with deadly eating disorders.
All right.
You're just going to go nuts when you see this.
Ashley Simpson, her low point, she was five foot six and weighed seventy pounds.
My left leg weighs more than that.
Wow.
I think Fat Boy's...
Raccoon.
Certainly weighs more than the side of the pound.
There's more to weight more than that.
I think this is right cheekways more than that.
Stars with deadly eating disorders.
And those at risk, fame can kill or hear a curse the alleyway.
I'm serious when you do not eat a meal before you open up to the middle of this magazine.
All right.
In fact, I would go on about a three day fast.
Let me have a little...
Fatatini.
Cookie doll.
Cookie doll.
Wow.
Fame can kill.
That's especially true in Hollywood where the constant pressure to maintain their figures causes some starry to develop deadly eating disorders.
Shush his anorexia bulimia even binge eating and puts up the stars at risk it says.
It goes on.
I already read you the Oprah thing.
Jamie Lynn Seagler.
I don't even know who she is.
Leto from the Supredos.
Oh, I don't want to say a joke.
She's a little bit...
Her low point was five foot six and ninety pounds.
Damn.
At 16, she struggled with what she calls exercise bulimia and eating disorder the competitor exercises obsessively to burn calories.
This thought over the breakup of the boyfriend, the five six beauty lost thirty pounds.
Factority man.
And weighed only ninety.
By eating less than three hundred calories a day, taking seven dance classes a week and exercising up to four hours a day.
I hated the way I looked when I saw myself in the mirror but I just couldn't stop what I was doing.
She confesses.
She co-stars as daughter Meadows of Prano on HBO's mob drama.
There's your pranos.
Finally, she reached out for help from a nutritionist, a therapist in the psychologist who prescribed me a medic.
Maybe she just had it for like a restaurant would have been good.
Could have saved a lot of cash.
Actually Simpson actually says I was around a lot of girls with eating disorders actually had a minor one myself.
Yeah, a minor one five six seventy pounds.
Oh God.
The punk rocker turned pop's tart reveals that she had a brush with the eating disorder area.
There's pop tarts that way more than she does.
She had a brush with the eating disorder and I see when she was only eleven.
Actually, we're taking ballet classes and found ourselves surrounded by real thin dancers.
At five foot six, the aspiring ballerina slipped away, scrawny seventy pounds after about six months of night eating too much at all.
Luckily her eating habits and gunfigures sparked her parents' concern.
Now, Shapley at twenty one, the pop prince is boast that her food issues have long been put to rest.
I think I have good curves and they're womanly.
She said that you would never know that because the picture here is your way by four pounds.
Although, Josh is smitten with her.
Not.
Actually Simpson.
I'd like to smit with her sister.
There you go.
Well, George did.
He didn't smit but he said he did sip with her sister.
That's not what the other other table put my own.
No, there was a table and he put his hand over the table at all.
No, we got this blockage down here.
You know, Kelly Clarkson, another American idol, a bitch.
She's five four.
She forked herself to send down to one oh nine.
I can hear the beach boys singing it right now.
After losing a music edition, we were rivaling judges D more physically fit.
How about four oh nine?
They'll have it, huh?
My out too.
When I was younger, I tried out for a part and the other girl beat me out of it.
It was not musically gifted as me, Kelly, because she must have been really talented.
So if she was so cheated that she for nearly six months, she didn't eat much anything.
There it is.
Told you.
Yeah.
That was enough.
Paula Abdul, that bitch.
I realized I needed professional help when I looked at myself in the mirror.
My body looked like a skeleton.
I could see my bones sticking out through my skin.
My legs looked as thin as two things she said.
With all those chilling words, the American idol judge me called it as she hit rock bottom,
rock bottom, rock bottom, and checked into a clinic to beat the eating disorder.
At a petite five, two, she now tries to maintain a weight of 105,
but she's below into 135 in the past.
In her darkest days, she would binge on an entire cake, a bag of cookies in a tub of ice cream,
then purged by going to the bathroom and vomiting.
Oh, God.
The egg right is worse than former L.A. Lakers,
Chewie, who were exercised obsessively to burn off the calories.
On 1994, she was down to waste scant 86 pounds.
But here's the, this is, I'm not going to waste your time with all these other ones,
like Courtney, for instance, which I don't even know who she is.
She's on a sitcom day by day, and never seen it.
She's been a little bit about two things, but she was down to five, six, and 103 pounds.
When she's up to a tub of 104, I guess, then say,
Barbara, stress, man, man, if you, when you see this picture,
you'll either laugh yourself to death or just pee in your pants or both.
Barbara says, and she's got that, in this picture,
she's got that one booby pointed toward the southeast,
and I'm not sure what else is behind it, Jack, and on the other side.
Maybe a sandwich.
Maybe they've all blended into one now.
Maybe she's got a grinder.
Maybe a blob of fat on her chest.
I've been even like a pig.
I hate exercising.
It's torture for me since Barbara.
Oh, could've fooled me, sweetheart.
People, the multi-towned Hollywood diva,
and she's got a $1,000,000.
She's got $3,000,000.
She's got six months, and we didn't have $1,75.
During her 60s heyday, she died at an exercise
as they had spent $120.00.
She gradually pumped up to $1,45.00.
And then $1,75.00.
Anybody go for $200?
But while filming the 2004 comedy Meet the Fokers,
a 64-year-old asked to in a morphed-in-away junk food junkie
gorging on fried chicken, brownies, cupcakes,
and asking him from the refaithable between scenes.
If you were to move, we'll be called Meet the Fokers.
You'd probably have some disorders too.
Pals revealed that bad times, how many James Grolan
encouraged her to change her eating habits,
and began an exercise routine.
Instead, she turned to night experts at Jenny Crafer,
and I actually looked just like Kristie Ali.
Like her cow.
Cookie dough.
Oh, here's Winona Judd.
Oh, my gosh, she makes Barbara look like a magic.
Winona Judd, my guess, holy moly rat, man.
You know, Winona Judd?
Yes, she's always a thick.
Oh, yeah.
She's a little more than thick right now.
She weighs 274.
Wow.
She's wearing a pup tent.
Wow, but the best one I say for last,
remember I told you about this before, hopefully you forgot.
I gave you that musical clue.
Right?
On a cold-richy.
Let's see, in 2004, she weighed 122 pounds,
but funs to weigh fairly frail.
Oh, this is the one.
Why is she wearing this bra?
She has, like, where other women have, like,
outventations, like, she has indentations.
It's about the skeleton they're concave.
She weighs 85 pounds.
Yeah.
Five foot two, or her, and fuller goo.
And she weighs 82 pounds.
But wait till we get back and do the moniker one,
man, that's my favorite.
Seriously, if it's the last thing you do,
go out and buy this magazine.
Do it today.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 5.59 A.M.
The ride to two hour.
Play me it all on our rack,
and then wire tails.
Big shot, that old guy in the face.
Few hurricanes,
and valoury play my booger-ray,
bing-gwan-tam-on-o-bay.
I booger-ray, no Debbie and Dees,
just coulda-layed-me,
and gas prices out of control.
I can't stop the flow of people from Mexico,
so I'm going down in the pool,
cause I'm the press with low ratings.
I feel folks like me,
But most hate me my second term
Let's face it, people, make everybody swarm away
My English in need's translating
I'm on thin ice and boy I scared no
I'm the friends with no redness
Absolutely
I'm the real world
I'll be folks like me
Anyway, your buddy Lou Dobbs, your new hero writes before we get to Monica and her cow-like appearance
Dobbs says, game marriage amendments, she or nonsense
President Bush is Wig Urge Congress to pass the Constitution Amendment banning game marriage
By the way, it never got to be voted, I killed it
Right
At a time when the US faces some of the greatest challenges in our nation's history is Lou
So logically what could possibly better ensure the prosperous and bright future of working men and women and their families than for the Senate to work on a Constitution amendment that's guaranteed to fail
It is clear that cynical patronizing what House political strategists are trying to rally a conservative base that they believe is more based than conservative
They're wrong in all counts
We're fighting a war against radical Islamist terrorists with ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan
We're drowning in debt from our growing record trade and budget deficits and we're watching our public education system fail the generation of students
Congress has yet to act on effective solution to our illegal immigration crisis as many individuals flood our borders each year
And our nation's borders and ports are still woefully insecure four and a half years after the attacks of 9-11
Lou says I believe most Americans are far more concerned about their declining real wages and lack of real creation of quality jobs than in the insulting insertion of wages using the national dialogue and political agenda
But President Bush and the Senate have decided they should take up a constitutional ban on game marriage
polls tell us most of us oppose game marriage
Those same polls also are shouting to our elected representatives in Washington that we want real leadership and real solutions to real problems
The President and the Senate's Republican leadership are now claiming that an amendment to our Constitution is necessary to save the American family
No matter how you feel about the issue in many of us feel deeply a constitutional amendment to ban game marriage is utter and complete nonsense
It's an insult to the intelligence of every voter Republican or Democrat liberal or conservative
The President and the Senate are focusing on one of the few reasons that is not been proven to cause divorce
They instead should look to financial hardships and lack of communication about family finances
The median family income is stagnating, log gasoline costs and higher interest rates are eating up the family budget
Nor is the Senate looking at the national tragedy of out of a wedlock births in seven states more than 40% of our children are born out of wedlock
Nationally more than one out of three of our children born to unmarried parents
Both political parties love to excite and in life and their so-called bases by focusing on wedges
Like game marriage abortion, gun control, school prayer and flag burning, both Republicans and Democrats raise these issues to distract and divert public attention
From the pressing issues that affect our way of life in our nation's future
Are these wedges really how Congress should be spending its time, especially given how little time policies and spend in Washington DC these days
I'd rather see our 535 elected representatives and this president use their time to combat poverty
Fix our crumbling schools secure our broken borders and ports and hold employers accountable for their hiring illegal aliens
And like millions of Americans I'm desperate for resolution to our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
How can we tolerate elected officials who press wedges issues when 37 million people in the U.S. live in poverty won an every eight Americans
Almost 18% of children under the age of 18 live in poverty 13 million kids
Nearly 46 million people live without health insurance about 16% of the population a number that is risen by 6 million since 2000
More than 1 in 10 children are uninsured and a quarter of people with incomes below 25 grand also lack any health insurance
Colleagues cost their skyrocketing there's been a 40% jump in place and adjusted in tuition and fees at public for your colleges and universities over the past five years according to the college board
The cost for brand name prescription drugs have also increased twice as fast as the rate of inflation
In fact over the past six years the average rise on the price of brand name drugs is 40% according to the AARP
While these increases in the price of basics make it harder for working men and women to make ends meet the president congress would rather drive wage issues and work toward real solutions
I wonder if the president's political advisors know just how ill advised and smart me this wage issue looks to the millions of us who want solutions to the critical urgent problems facing this nation worse
I wonder if they even care since you're a hero Lou dobs. How do you like that?
Great goal Lou keep it up. Keep it up.
Yeah that thing that John Stewart did on Lou dobs and who wasn't was I don't know what that was all about.
It was just a panic it was a laugh right? No 958 votes at 105 we got it we got it made in a shade 958

almost twice less I'm sure you may feel a judge it looked like a magic unfortunately my appetite doesn't discriminate against my moods happy or
so the infamous white house interior loves to eat so much that her weight has one sword away scale
blessing 300 pounds according to a 94 drivers license 5 6 Monica weighted her bust 135 but by 1999 a year
after her zipper gave a fair with Bill Clinton a slow in the headlines she tipped the scales at 175 but that
was only the beginning desperate to slim down Monica sounded the oldest postwoman for Jenny Craig
we're in a reported 10 grand for every pound she should the incentive work but after the dye
company dropped her ass Monica fell back into her old eating habits and hit almost 300 pounds by
late 2004 she was down to waste felt 260 when she spent five days consulting nutritionist and fitness
experts at grail springs health retreat and wellness fine bankrupt Ontario candidate a I thought
that the earth was tilting pal is close to the 32 year old handbag designer blame her chronicle
reading on her scandalous affair with Clinton oh yeah let's blame bubble for it he used to eat all
him t-burgers you know yeah Monica struggled with her weight virtually her entire life at a Jenny
Craig spokesman brim luscom about poor Monica mental health experts by the way we port that eating
disorders have the highest mortality weight of any mental illness 95% of those with eating disorders
are between the ages of 12 and 25 see nothing wrong with being a tubby kid I mean I can live very
long but nevertheless wow hey you sure do oh and look at this we both been heathered ex-boy of

fueling negative stories by using ex-girlfriends who are producers to make cruel documentaries about
her and not be mad enough for minutes oh just all kinds of don't you wish you had these problems oh

now from this getting started though now if I was you in there that Walgreens right there in the
corner right on the way out the door in fact I'm surprised see back in the day one of our listeners

One who jammed, he'll do what he can.
Shake your hand like a friend, then quickly walk away.
They had Joe go to five six oh with ratings and the toilet mold to get those
Play means for full most in order and control.
And then so, jolly, rolly, Joe, a bunch of humor and in the know he lets smoke.
Go and hear what blows his gildy his own show.
He'll make a big change and read a raid.
It's worse for the same.
He hasn't done a thing for what goes on the air at two.
Joe don't have a stinkin' clue out of four.
Not that essentially blows for all radio.
The GM of five six oh jolly, rolly, Joe.
Bye, bye, bye.
