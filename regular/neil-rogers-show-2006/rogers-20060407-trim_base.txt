The music expressed on the previous program is by the way did the cast of the Incadensis for you, but in it you jacked it.
It's the best of a thorough state in this.
It's for the radio, but it's for the radio.
Kenny and Fort Lauderdale might have, and take a fast, by the way, if people are starting to rock.
It's Friday, you play a series.
In Miami, Florida, here's what's happening today, just for you.
As your community-minded station, 560 WQA up, want you to know what's happening all week long, right here in Miami.
Starting this Saturday, the retard parade sponsored and led by the Miami City Commissioners, then become a sacrifice at Kayaocho, as angry Cubans offer you what the Tupa Hobra.
The Lapitha homeless tour featuring misery, starvation and other maladies under the 395 overpass, plus it's leave at 9 a.m. from the Burdad section of Liberty City.
Don't miss the Miami-Date Police Bravo Festival and the grand opening of the new smash-addict methadone centers, all this and more in the bedroom countable world.
It's great to be in Miami.
Better for you than me. It's a 10-1-560 WQA. They're at the end of the big O for the Humper Show.
We had one of the great misfits of all time. The guy with the eyes, your body and your appearances.
I sent Josh in there to tell them it was too late.
Gournish Telfan.
See, that's one thing about the board ops like Gryper, you know. They just, they don't know anybody. And that's, of course, they're all sports and nerds.
Here's a rule of thumb to tell if it's one of our retard chronics. If they mention your name.
Right. That's generally a pretty good hint.
Yeah. Cause like regular ordinary normal people aren't going to be calling.
Or you're going to be doing a crossover with a nailer like, hey, yeah, that's a...
But obsessed, you know, obsessed because...
I have no idea.
...and they could cast it, he turned them down, I guess.
Keep listening, Parkford Redgar family records, Kenny.
See, and you know what I was just thinking about? Because I don't think about those people often, thank goodness.
But how old are some of these people got a V-Buy?
And are like in their 40s maybe pushing 50s some of them, you know. Some of the people with the LLT and the Red Breath.
And...
It's still the same. Nothing has changed.
Ah, lots of the time.
The little fraternity, they still have the regular meetings, you know. They sit around the smoking...
...camel.
Camel.
Oh, not what you're thinking.
They're not a peal.
No.
They kind of poured the good stuff.
Oh, yeah. Even Sigourney Weaver's got better stuff than they got.
Oh, you better not play that, you might get somebody aroused out there. Hey Kenny.
OK, that's not...
Don't play David Cassie underneath the bad music from the bad news.
An explosion rocked a Shiite mosque in Northern Baghdad after religious services today.
Kill your lease 43, wounding another 138.
Oh, brother, it sounds pretty bad.
Oh my God.
Major Fala Al-Mohamadawi. That's his name.
So dozens were wounded and the blasts, he said the occasionally toll was based on reports from three hospitals.
43 day and 138 at least wounded. They're still counting bodies and body parts.
Everything is just fine over there.
Really well, it's really going swimmingly well.
Anyway, we're not going to get too newsy anymore after yesterday.
We had so many great calls including that lady that called 400 times.
Then I find out from Josh that she called her front or office. She called the front desk.
And what did she want? She wanted the email.
Even though George already got one from her.
Right. She already had email, George, but she called out there to bug them too.
So like I said, most women are curfews and just annoying.
Well, she was bugging, you know, K-carlo.
So, hey, you know, like I said, good job.
He deserves to be bugged.
Oh, I got a one for that.
I know, you know what time you got food there already?
I was just on the bagel showed up magically.
Oh no, that's bad stuff for you.
The east in there you're going to have a headache.
Your head's going to be throbbing.
You're going to have a Houston texture.
You're going to feel like the quarterback of Notre Dame.
There's just a Todd Mabertill that chile from Howie's got to meet the quarterback in Notre Dame myself.
But anyway, of all the things that he'll talk about, which is the most interesting to you.
That was our poll yesterday.
Our interesting poll.
I'll not as interesting as any Sochin and those shows on Socks.
I remember he used to say I'm a very interesting guy.
1235 votes.
Politics 572.
Bush bashing like that guy tried to do yesterday at that Trumped up appearance.
The guy, but it would have opened a crowd as booing.
Oh, Bush is pretending to be Oh no.
Let him speak.
Let him speak.
And then of course he only responded to one thing and gave exactly the answer you'd expect.
Everything is for our safety, you know, safety of the American people.
And they're all cheering.
Hey, don't slam it over on us and I was the end of that.
And then you failed to point out that he didn't respond to any of the other things that the guy brought up.
But that's okay.
Just like Scott Mausel-Brien this morning trying to cover up after Bill Schneider.
Talk about the leaker and chief and all this other stuff.
It's just a garnish dolphin, man.
They're all there.
They're all on the take.
They're all on the payroll.
Anyway, all the things I talk about which is the most interesting.
You politics 572.
Inside radio stuff 163.
Religion 131.
How about that Judas, huh?
Good guy.
Thought he was a bad guy.
Now he's a good guy.
It's the home of the good guys W ABC.
Or was that WMCA, I think?
I don't know.
I hate this poll.
I didn't know it was WMCA with Joe.
What was the name?
Not Joe, Brian.
Whatever his name was.
Jewish stuff 56 like.
Oh!
Paisach coming up.
And by the way, you'll be interested in know that in Chinese, the opposite of delicious
is halosius.
Add that to your vocabulary.
You've already got it there.
Halosius.
Food slash restaurants 49.
Probably like those bagels are reading.
Gay stuff 45.
Oh, this audience just thrives on.
Especially the guy with the eyes.
Taki 41.
Slots and gambling 25.
Get a good machine.
That's my best advice.
Find a good machine.
And if somebody else is playing it, just knock their ass off it on the floor.
So excuse me.
And then just sit right down.
Amsterdam 21.
Used to be a very exciting place.
Now there's too many Dutch people there.
The track 12.
Now forget that.
That guy that called about Geltstein yesterday, he had to be from across the street.
Had to be.
Nobody wants to hear about the race track.
Tell Hank that when he comes back from the Woodman World on Monday.
Nobody wants to hear about horse racing.
Immigration 11.
Except a bunch of old guys that stand out near the track kicking the tickets around.
Health problems 8.
The stock market 7 and diet talk is deadliest 5.
They don't want to hear no diet talk.
They want to mind your mind, man.
Maybe that's why they didn't that toss the thing.
They didn't go over so big.
Yeah.
That I thought was a great discovery.
And that you're reading and I'm eating and beef is eating.
And a couple of others.
But they go over because they don't want to stay alive.
They'd rather just pick out and croak.
And in a lot of cases, that's not such a bad idea.
Here's today's poll question.
Of course, this is what everybody, isn't this what you're thinking about 24-7 now?
What Judas?
No, Katie Kirk.
Forget about Judas.
He was small.
He ain't going to be doing the CBS even he knew.
Now I will say this.
If they could bring Judas back to do the CBS even he'd beat the pants off of Katie Kirk.
Look, and maybe this will be the show for Judas.
Have all the things that they're throwing at us on the news.
Well, CBS even he knows with Judas is scary.
Or why can't you see it now?
Look at all the swirled their fitness.
Katie Kirk, this this Faggot prostitute Judas.
This is CBS.
Yeah.
Is there any real good about what's her name is making a comeback now over there in Aruba?
Oh, what they found her?
I don't know.
That chickener-looking body.
That chickener-rooba?
It's tasty.
Chicken and aruba.
894 votes.
Yeah, maybe that's where Hannibal Lecter was calling from.
Look, it looked like it could have been aruba, didn't it?
It's a dish you make with yellow rice.
I know.
No, but seriously, listen, remember when he made that last call?
That's right.
I could have been there.
We saw the other one.
Maybe that's the friend who was having the other one in it because it was so bad.
I remember there were the airplane the way he was feeding the little kid brains.
No, seriously.
The sequel.
How did he end?
He was on an airplane and a little kid?
Hannibal.
He was feeding him brains?
Little kid.
It didn't like the airplane food.
Hannibal said, you have very good taste here, have some of this, and opened up a little
Tupperware bowl where he had some brains in there.
Ooh, nice.
He didn't eat it to this little kid.
Should have fed that to the president.
Well, you watch Katie Curric on a CBS evening news.
That's the leaker-in-chief by the way, the president.
894 votes already.
Our goal is a thousand.
Once we get that, we're going home.
Don't watch Network News 286.
286.
32% of this audience don't watch Network News.
How dare you, now!
I don't blame you.
Waste of time.
Oh, look at that.
There's Mrs. Limbaugh.
Give me some coke.
Give me some coke.
She pushes her hair back and, oh, come on.
Stop already.
Will you?
Stop with a crap.
Katie Curric blows 225.
You said that.
That was my vote.
I wouldn't watch her if you paid me by the millisecond if there was like a meter running
with like dollar signs.
I wouldn't watch it.
Don't watch CBS now.
I won't watch her either.
207.
I used to before, a funny, dah-di-oki doki.
Oh, there's your buddy, Ludab.
He's broken.
Borders.
Send a show down the end of Steve-o.
Talk about a one-note Charlie, man.
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.
God.
I think they adrained some of the air out of his cheeks.
Watch others now.
But we'll watch her 60.
Do you believe that?
60 people say they watch other newscasts now, but they'll watch Katie.
60.
Okay.
I hate this full of 57.
Watch CBS now, and we'll watch her.
I'll continue 55.
She looks a little bit like Bob Sheeper.
And watch CBS now, but won't watch her only 7.
We put that on late, but still only.
Solemnites yet, they're not too good out of 902.
Not too great.
The guy with the eyes.
Well, that just didn't great to see where they-
Where do you think they want to be?
Listen to me.
Where are the only ones that know anything about talk radio?
See, that's the problem.
Sports talk is not talk radio.
Right.
That's why the boardoffs during those sports shows never seem to know the voices.
That's why the same people are on over.
I mean, our show, of course, we let-
You can't come more than 30 times a day.
Well, it's a good thing that the whole-
Like that woman yesterday.
Yeah, it's a good thing the whole-
Yeah, that's right.
Well, you expect-
That way to be an all fairness.
You expect the big ol' who's on from 5 to 7 in the morning.
Even the guy with the eyes is not trawling at that hour.
The big ol' who claims to be-
He listened to you since high school.
I should know who the chronics are.
No, he-
Come on.
That's-
That's ridiculous.
That's way above and beyond.
When you're as chronic as I am.
These-
No, these people haven't been traumatized by the-
This group of misfits like we have.
Yeah, they have.
They just never noticed.
Oh.
I was gonna say-
Yeah.
I bet you that Kenny would like somebody to throw him a banana.
Wouldn't surprise me.
I know somebody who might-
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-
Yeah, I know somebody who might be-
Conflicting Panther playoff games against the Marlins?
No, we won't.
Because it won't be any.
Yeah, the Tampa Bay Lightweight stay one last night in the shootout.
Was the shootout over time.
It was the shootout against Atlanta.
So Atlanta got another point, but Tampa got two more.
So the Panthers are now-
It's not official, but it's as close to official.
I mean, they're behind everybody now, even behind the Leafs.
The Make Believes got like 80, and Atlanta 81,
and the Panthers with 77.
It's not going to-
Not going to cut it.
No chance.
So when you hear those promos and those rejoins
that they're about, hey, the final four games, they're out for good of them.
I mean, go and see them if you want, but tell me what you want to get in for free.
They'll let you in.
Because if they can count you for the attendance, they'll even let you in for free, I think.
Oh, yeah, bring a whole bunch of your friends too.
We'll put that in the attendance numbers.
Makes Alan Cohen feel like a real success.
Gjaldi is the center two to four.
He'll be us back in it.
Mad Dog get Augusta at the Masters with Curtis.
I don't understand that.
In other words, he's going to be doing the-
From four to six for a 40, and Curtis will be also with the Bank and the Center.
Is that what that is?
You're asking someone?
I'm asking Josh.
I'm asking Josh.
Yeah, that's what that is.
You're asking me.
God, I'm asking you.
Excuse me.
Don't get all testing.
I just-
I just want to go to our hernia now with Norma Kent to work on your new deal now to get a little security.
You know, so you're going to have to have quite some hours.
I don't know.
That was a hit for Josh to answer, because I knew you were talking to me.
Oh, well, yeah, that's the-
Right.
Well, he's-
He wants to get paid by the word now.
He's playing hardball.
Keep it tallie.
He's playing hard to get.
That's what I said.
That's what Dustin.
Playing hard to get.
Then we got Marlon's on decades, X-40 on Q-I-M, and then Marlon's at the Mets at 710.
What a strange time to start a game at 710.
Leave it to the Mets, Mets suck.
And then the Panther preview was over on 1360 at 7 and Panther is in Penguins at, uh, uh, whatever.
I'm- I'm K-E-T at 730.
And any K from Vegas follows all of these things.
All of these things.
Any K plunge in his guts out in Vegas.
Well, if there's one thing I can't stand, this guy's who games-
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 516 Q-A-M.
And then Mike Blow.
Chris is dead?
He's a J-J-J.
No, Charlie.
Did he relate it?
That's his brother.
Good brother.
I know, Todd Steg is a J-Republican.
No such thing as a J-R-E-T.
That Charlie Chris is not gay?
That's Finisher Cooling.
He's running for governor.
Governor of law.
The lever chaps clothes.
No, no. He lasts for a while.
Jesus Christ, we're jobless.
This message paid for by Chris James with D-Grip Public and Todd's office.
And maybe Mark Follick can sit right up there in the throw next to it, Charlie.
He wins the election, but I doubt it.
Uh, 1016 at 560 W.Q.
I'm happy Friday to you.
And just a couple of things before we dive into a bunch of call.
Well, wait a minute. Maybe we'll take one.
Maybe it's the comedy eyes.
What do you think? Oh, if we're lucky.
W.Q.A.M. Hello.
Governor of law.
The lever chaps.
Q.I.M.
Yes, good morning.
Yes, sir.
Can you do something on Chronic Friday?
Oh, no. Not for not with you.
It can be all Chronic. That's Friday. How's that?
Was that good or what?
And you notice how he like-
He was cupping me from-
Yeah.
With a noise-woody. He was like this.
Right. Cup this. I hear his cup run up over.
567. Let's have-
I like that. All Chronic Friday.
In fact, we're going to kill him all today right here on the year.
Oh, God. I'd pay money for that.
Hmm. Take- take up a collection for that.
567-0560.
Pound 560 in the Verizon singular wireless lines.
Your choice for two to four now.
We've had this embarrassment going on for months.
When did most finally get-
Uh, asked to say goodbye.
Was it like in March?
Get out of here.
March is contracted in March.
That's crazy. Back in the end of January, I believe.
Okay. And here it's the-
Today's the 6th-7th of April.
Ciette. They are real.
And we're still a pochkin around.
It's gildy. It's Curtis. It's this one.
It's that one. Come on.
Let's find out who the audience would like to have in there from two to four.
Maybe we'll stick George in there from two to four.
George and-
George.
One.
For next to 15 bucks a week.
Yeah, a bargain.
And I might even pay on time, but I doubt it.
WQAM. Hello.
Hi, Neil. How's your knee doing there, buddy?
It's beautiful. It's-
I look it.
Hey, you know, yeah, think about it. WQAM. Hello.
The priest said get on your knees and play.
Yeah, I've just got through it. It's in-
It's Friday's knee show.
I don't know how is my knee doing.
It's scabby.
Sorry, I have the bandage off there. Healed up real good.
Got any pus to squeeze?
No, I don't have no pus.
No, that's on the phone. Just squeeze the pus out of the door.
See? WQAM. Hello.
I want scum for help.
And the little little little little little little.
Oh, that's over there.
Sure some-
Sure some of those brains to that guy sounds like he can use it.
For a little knee, zerid.
Man, that was good.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.
Let me take a look at my knee.
Oh, it's just like a little red mark there.
It looks like nothing ever happened.
I think-
Oh, I think it's bleeding again.
Dominic QAM. Hello.
Hi, Neil. How are you?
Great.
First of all, let me tell you, 80 curd makes me nauseous.
Yeah.
Second of all, I'm the guy who called with Van is almost correct.
He's unfortunately she had a birthday since I first heard of him.
Yeah, don't give me this 48 crap.
She's 40, and it looks a day over 70.
Well, anyway, I just called to re-interrate that.
No, we already got it.
Okay, thanks very much for pointing out that I made a bad mistake.
And we appreciate that, but don't paint yourself in the back too hard, okay?
Great. I wouldn't say it was a bad mistake.
I don't think if you want that on your tombstone,
that this is what you're known for in your lifetime,
the fact that you got Van is age almost right, you know?
That's true. However, Jonathan is that she's Miami.
What is it?
She's from Miami.
Yeah. Well, I told you there's a reason we can't stand her.
Now, she's just there, you know.
She could be there or not.
They could just automatically do the letters which they do anyway.
Just press a button.
So it really isn't relevant to anything.
She's just there except for the guys who think,
she's hot, just like Jackie Johnson.
There's a female. She's on TV.
It's just like you're always saying about, you know,
because they're on television.
Right. That's it. It's all it takes.
It's like Howard Ville. Cause you're on television, dummy.
So therefore if she's on TV or in the movies, she's hot.
And I'm gagging on. See, that is punishing me.
I think it's due to this is scary.
It's going to get me for that.
Due to this is carrot.
Due to this is carrot.
And not the course Kenny's banana.
WDQAM. Hello.
QAM.
Hey, Neil. How you doing?
Okay.
You know, George was talking about the soft news on television.
Listen, I don't know what I do without Ben Ferrara
on Channel 10 in the morning to flip in her hair back,
tell her me how traffic's on build on the farm.
And it rained last night so the streets are going to be wet.
I mean, without her, you know, I don't know why I'm doing that.
Yeah, life would be in keeping.
It's my board on it.
Mm-hmm.
She's got high breasts.
Really?
They said that.
She's got Jeff Hyggress is what I'm hearing.
Oh.
Hey, QAM. Hello.
Hey, you.
Who are you?
Okay.
Hey, Lutton. Can we talk in impeachment?
Yeah. Go right ahead.
Please.
Say all you love. So somebody hears you.
Well, listen, this is what I'm thinking.
What's the point of impeaching a president?
You have to impeach an administration.
Yeah.
So you get rid of Bush.
You put Chani up there.
You get rid of Chani.
Then you get the guy that wants to speak or frisk.
You get rid of him.
Who the heck is going to run this car?
You don't get frisk.
You get the, you don't get the sentiment.
You're really going to get the house, uh,
major, you get that fat, uh, what's his name?
Then he has to. Yeah.
All right. So this is the game when we win, send it back in November.
Well, why we get the death, the, well, me, me.
I'm personally going to work on it.
Yeah.
And then, uh, with gets the guy from Nevada,
what's his name?
Harry Reid.
He's coming.
Harry and I will.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
He's about as powerful as Greg Reid.
Okay. You keep working on a pal.
Let us know when you're done.
It's boring.
He's got a game plan.
Plan.
Something like that.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
I'd rather hear from the guy with the eyes to be honest with him.
He's, uh, totally joking.
It's just a joke.
Yeah. Let me ask you how long you think he'd be on a year.
How long do you think I'm going to show you on a year?
Two years.
Two years.
Can you start it screaming, which would be in the second syllable in the upper three?
But you're picking on the big O for not knowing that.
That's terrible.
Well, he just got done saying that he's been listening to you for a hundred years.
No, no, he said that afterward.
He said that afterward.
Don't you understand?
He probably wants that two to four slot.
So he wants me to go to bad form.
And I got nothing against him.
I think he's okay.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
But then again, when it comes to sports, who cares anyway?
It might be more interesting if he didn't know what he was talking about.
At least in his room for controversy.
Oh, there's Ted Kennedy and John McCain.
I think they're going to do something.
Look at that.
And my team is so...
So immigration compromised stalls in the Senate.
I was just going to do that next.
No, I don't have fights.
And I'd over, we're going to recess.
They're going to recess for a couple of weeks.
And then they're going to come back.
But I'm even a bit of a bit of up in two weeks after he's Easter and a face off recess.
We believe we have the votes.
Look at Ted.
Ted looks like he's going to take a nap standing up.
Look at that.
He's got his head on John McCain's shoulder.
That's the way that he's going to get some functions.
You see that?
We should have last.
I think he was holding himself up on McCain's shoulder.
He had lost about 100 pounds.
He's got a tea bag in him with this chin.
Yeah.
He kind of looks like a tea bag.
Colleges for all of their efforts on behalf of this worthy cause.
The issue is not over, but Ted says...
So first of all, I want to thank Senator McCain and...
Thank God.
...of our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats of life.
Yeah, why do you screw it up?
The immigration bill, the big breakthrough is stalling.
Now we have two week recess and they'll think about it.
But it'll be pitiful.
They'll start counting Mexican heads and who's going to vote for this one and all this other.
Maybe they can give out some green cards and voting registration cards and some
die-bold computer information.
Don't forget the ratings diary.
And some ratings diary.
Still, that would be good.
Of course, we won't get any of those.
They'll all be voting for Radio Swabby cause now even in Mexicans are Colombians.
They're listening to Radio Catacole.
Got a cool?
Yeah, do have a cool.
Thank you.
I'm John Blasper.
WKYM, hello.
Can we start now?
Can we start now?
Can we start now?
Sure.
What are you doing there?
Excellent.
The program through Radio Voice again and I appreciate you talking about my stock program.
People are still talking about that.
Who are you so-ching?
Oh my God.
How's everything?
Oh, jeez, you've got to be kidding me.
Okay, so all you got to do is mention the name and there they are.
I've just popped right out of the list.
I've got to do it up on Radio by the way.
I wanted to politics, believe it or not.
Politics.
And now I've elected official.
Where's that?
A new town called Coffin Bay.
Yeah.
I knew you'd make it big in a town that hasn't been invented yet.
See, they were ahead of your time.
They just hadn't invented a place for you yet.
I can't have that.
I can't have tried everything.
They're going through a stocks journey.
It's good here.
You okay?
Everything all right?
Yeah, everything's fine.
I guess just listen to everyone for a while.
I just wanted to say hi.
I wanted to wish you happy birthday.
Months and months to go.
But I wasn't able to get to it, but I'll do it now.
Well, happy birthday to you too whenever it is.
Yeah, that's great.
Good process.
See you early.
Take care of yourself.
Go find us, socks, scroller form, a good guy or an associate.
Now, Ernie was a guest of mine back in the days when I did all that embarrassing radio,
even more embarrassing than QAM, which is saying a lot.
With all those guests, then Ernie used to come on and do biorathems.
He was his business.
He was peddling like electronic stuff and had those little biorathem calculators.
Okay.
And that was good, except for the fact that as soon as somebody would call in and Ernie would like to do,
but to be able to do the little calculation there and all that.
Well, today your biorathem is a stink and don't go out of the house.
You're going to get run over by a truck or whatever it was.
And then of course, it's just like with psychics on here.
The phones go crazy, but as soon as somebody calls and hears their own personal, whatever it is,
at that point, they're gone.
Because who the hell cares about anybody else's deal, you know?
Right.
We don't care about them.
We care about us.
So as far as listening to somebody else, we don't want to.
But Ernie and of course, then I put them on the year to fill in,
which I think responsibility for that.
I got them on here on weekends to do something to fill in.
Oh, and happy paysoft by the way Ernie too.
Some was like a tennis player.
I forgot to ask them about his son.
Probably this as well.
26 past 10.
Look at that.
They're all lined up there.
Who the hell we got?
We had Ted Kennedy and McCain.
Who's this and what they got on there?
This and the shot.
So that means they will go to the break to the Eastern Path over the back.
They're going to the break.
You ought to go to the break too, honey.
We are.
This is Neil.
Your rush of good kick to rush right on the back.
So we've faced.
5, 16, 18, 18.
You're well-steered.
The most controversial movie of our turn,
Martin Sporceses, the last temptation of Christ,
recently became available for home viewing on cassette.
Religious groups, lifted the release of the film theatrically,
became outraged on the event of its home distribution.
And so, for your spiritual edification,
and for those who don't have these serons on a Chrysler movie ticket,
we are proud to present, live,
part one, the radio version of Martin Sporceses,
the last temptation of Christ.
Oh, ah, hey, what?
What?
Want to buy a half-starrier?
Ah, ah, gee, I better not.
Okay.
And so, the controversy continued.
Two days tomorrow from Martin Sporceses,
the second-blast temptation of Christ.
So, guess what?
We thought that Judas is scary.
It was a bad guy.
Now, he's a good guy.
Just like Galileo, we thought he was a little bit like that.
Now, we apologize.
He was, he had a stomach on it.
977 votes already.
Aren't you impressed?
It's not even, I will have our thousand before 11 o'clock,
long before 11 o'clock.
Aren't you excited?
You want to write this in your memoirs?
Ah, this in 40 cents, I'll buy about a half a cup of coffee at Starbucks.
A coffee late day.
I just, that whole coffee thing sounds awfully good to me.
979 votes.
What do you watch Katie Kuerk?
I mean, this is supposed to be bigger than God and Judas is scary at put together.
What do you watch Katie on the CBS evening news?
Like Andy really said, he doesn't know anybody at CBS that he's coming here.
He likes it personally, but you know, forget about it.
980, like I said.
Don't watch network news, 314.
32% of this audience, even this newsy audience,
even this audience has been putting up with all these news stories that you forced me to read.
And that's going to come to a screeching halt.
Just like I used to do it, we don't want to hear one there, a couple.
That's it.
Who wants here some fat, like Tom Jiccher wrote,
who wants to hear some fat old faggot sitting in his underwear in Toronto,
reading stories out of the newspaper on the radio?
What kind of a show is that?
How much entertainment value is there in that?
It's supposed to talk about something important like sports and shack and shack and shack.
And oh, and that too well.
That goes without saying.
Oh, in other words, you hear that Josh?
Mark it down the time.
He's poo-pooing the calls.
Cock-a-kaw.
Already, already we had Ernie Sochin on there.
It's only 1032 for Craig.
Well, that was a rare treat.
That was a rare treat.
I told Josh that he had moody.
He had woody on it.
And the big go-head, the guy with the eyes.
Right.
It's going to be hard to top that.
Maybe my spindle will call in today.
You never know.
Maybe Stanley J. Cohen will call in.
Or Dave Ryder.
I wonder if some of these people are still alive.
Dave Ryder.
I wonder if he was kind of CC Ryder.
He's a pretty good guy.
He hired me at WINZ.
And then right after that, he got canned.
Is there a side of this fella?
Who?
There's that of this.
Or a spider, man.
I don't know if he's still around.
Hopefully he's asleep through the fishes.
God.
Just stop and think about all the...
Oh, brother, was that a station or what?
No, and seriously, that was the station
for the radio groupies, for the talk show groupies.
The light bulb.
With Norma Kent and Mr. Ego.
And Craig Worthing, who kept getting screwed over bad there
and shoved on late at night.
And Rick Spider-Man.
And Joyce Kaufman.
And then a whole succession of people didn't belong in here.
Not to mention Mark Shimbomb.
He remember he called in.
Oh, yeah.
That was kind of a person.
It's a who you.
It was he who also was to know who he is,
which is kind of embarrassing.
I think there's more people in this audience
know who he already so-tune was than Mark Shimbomb.
Not that you're a bad guy, Mark, but don't call me again.
Oh, let's see.
Will you watch Katie Couric on the CBS evening news?
Don't watch Network News 315.
Katie Couric blows 251.
That was my vote and I second that emotion.
She sucks.
Don't watch CBS now.
Won't watch her either.
225.
I hate this poll.
64.
Watch other Network News now.
But we'll watch her.
62.
All right.
Let's move on.
Slyther yourself on the Ashley Heart.
You idiot.
Watch CBS now.
And we'll continue watching.
We'll watch her.

acred, I don't know all comparison in this project
I checked the hare fina,
but it's hard
You have to have a basket first 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Oh, but you know what time of year it is though, don't you?
It's Easter basket time.
Now there is such a thing that I just dream it or what is in an Easter basket?
Easter eggs, candy, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate bunnies.
Chocolate little bunnies.
Well, let me ask you, what is the bunny have to do with Easter?
We went over this.
It's a symbol of fertility.
It's a pagan symbol of fertility.
It's a Pagan.
It used to play shortstop for the parents.
The Christians in order to stop the pagans in.
Decorated all of their holidays with pagan trappings to kind of draw that in.
And the bunny and the eggs are symbol of fertility.
Well, isn't that sweet?
Having nothing to do with yush.
In other words, making babies like rabbits, which I've always said.
That's right.
Or my rats and eggs.
Do I have to explain that?
No.
Hey Neil, how you doing buddy?
All right, pal.
And you, up, up and only we're missing you.
Oh yeah, oh there's another re-tard.
5.670560 and the reason I'm for you too is Bernie gets to say, and another one north to charge.
They're not missing you.
I'll tell you that.
That's what a Dick Feinberg told me if we ever see that guy again.
But I've been.
WCWAM hello.
Hey, Q. Yes sir.
We revolutionized radio and stuff.
What's the story with him lately where he fades off of the year?
That's me.
Oh, and that's you popping him down.
I just got a fade amount.
I thought maybe he was like losing contact with the holes in the phone.
I was thinking their cell phone doesn't get a full charge going.
Yeah, that maybe that's the second.
Or maybe it's the holes in the head that he's speaking through.
I'm not really sure.
But Josh is like, it went into he just pots you out.
Is what it is.
It's subconsciousness from what I can see.
He just.
Double the way in.
Hello.
Neil?
Yes sir.
Uh, do you know what is the joke?
Try to keep it clean.
Do you know what Easter brought me?
Okay, we don't do Joe County show.
Okay, sir.
Call the Ted Mackinac Foundation for the amateur hour.
What was that?
Pathetic or what?
See, I told you, open these phones wide up, baby.
Put it on full throttle.
Yeah.
This business in here all the way.
I do have this very important to the media.
Not although a representative Jane Harmon, Democratic California,
American Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee has called your
presently leaker in chief.
She says if this disclosure is true, my scooter Libby, that is it's
breathtaking.
The leaker in chief, he's the leaker and an ad na ha that come that the story will be
under tomorrow.
I thought Josh gets with it.
He calls, he says, Bush takes a leak.
That's a headline on this story.
Oh, Joyce, I'm sorry.
We can Bush takes a leak.
A British judge has rejected claims that US author Dan Brown plagiarized the work of two
historians and his best selling out of the Da Vinci code.
He's rejected it when in doubt he threw the charges out.
He's rejected the copyright infringement claim by Michael Beijon and Richard Lee,
whoever they are, who said that Brown blockbuster appropriated the Brown blockbuster
appropriated the architecture of the 82 book Holy Blood Holy Grail and now they're saying
holy moly.
And I'll tell you what else they're going to be saying really soon.
Oh, wow.
Today's verdict shows that this claim was utterly without merit.
I'm still astonished at these two authors chose to file a suit at all, Brown's
entertainment, according to the AMP.
So that's it.
They threw out that lawsuit and go out there and buy the Da Vinci code about a beat,
but it moved, put it up.
And you decide, is it you?
This is scary.
It was in Jesus.
Was it Mark Anthony?
Was it Anthony?
What's his name?
It can't sing.
What is it?
Mark Anthony.
Right.
Couldn't this thing as well as a paper sack?
Oh, look at that.
Schlazer accused of cutting off the arms of, there's a story sitting around CNN.
Found Dina Swasser holding a bloody...
Look at this guy.
I mean, is this the way you do the newscast?
I don't know what this guy's name is.
Okay.
And if I say something, it'll be...
You always think we put it back on there.
Oh, it'll be the conservative and very grateful thing.
He's terrible.
He is just awful this guy.
He's another one that was hyperventilating about that just in a very vivid air.
Oh, can you believe that?
Yeah, I believe it.
Yeah, that they're a little faggot horse.
Right, that's right.
Well, how'd I talk about that?
5-6, 7-8.
You know, when you offer to go online, make it and do sexual things.
There'll be a whole bunch of people out there.
Oh, yeah, how much you want.
You know, make no mistake about it.
The world is full of loony tunes.
And believe me, you're here in the monitor showing you're going to hear a lot more of them in weeks to come.
We're going to get those numbers back up there because the rest of the stations in the Cranperman, we're in the tank.
QA and that's our motto now.
In fact, we're going to have a new Billboard campaign coming up.
It just shows the tank of a toilet bowl.
Not the seat. That would be tacky.
You know, just a tank.
And the caption...
It could be a variety of captions like,
tanks a lot for putting us at the bottom or something like that.
You know, or we're in the tank.
I still like that.
But of course, have no fear because Joe Bell is off the Naples now.
They're putting their heads together over there.
About to be put about there having big powwows.
He's taking care of George.
He's taking care of Josh.
And you know, he's making up stories.
There's all kinds of stories.
He's schmoozing.
I guarantee he's doing a lot of back slapping over there.
QA and hello.
Hey, no, how you doing?
Pretty good.
Hey, no, no.
Yesterday on CNN, I heard the Congresswoman, I guess,
and she's from California that called the president, Leaker and Chief.
That's why I just said Jane Harmon, yes.
Right. I have a problem with that because it's like, is this...
It's like they're trying to say like little slick things or little wise cracks about it.
But this is a very serious situation.
And it's like, would that be where that revelation coming out in the...
I don't see the little crashes doing themselves any justice by kind of making it a little
wise cracks about it.
I think they should have been out there raising hair like I saw on Schumer doing a little bit.
Yeah.
I think it's a very serious situation.
And I think...
That's what we need to go for justice, man.
Don Corleyon.
It's just sad and it's crazy.
It's just frustrating that you see this...
You know, it's good that these things are coming out for...
One thing about the Democrats, man, they may not be good, but at least they're consistent, okay?
Yeah.
Var.
No pun.
We have, but wait a minute.
Let me tell you who's going to be opening up a big mouth.
There's the people, how are you, Dean, man?
One thing that everyone's keeping...
One thing that they...
Once they turn him loose, man, look at her.
Yeah.
But just to finish it, I'm just...
It's very frustrating, but it's good to see that these guys are not going to be able to just hide behind.
I do all this dirt in the high-to-hand.
You know, throw rocks in the high-to-hand.
These are a lot of stuff.
I don't know.
I wish they never met Skit.
They were going to try to put Scooter back on the Scooter and send his ass out into Uranus.
I'm sending Frisk General, Crystal Frisnesia.
There you go, me too.
All right.
Yeah, you're taking it easy, man.
Send him some flowers for St. Paddy's days.
A little bit late.
Send him some...
One of the four leaf flowers.
Or maybe you just send him some booze.
You get Irishman, right?
I thought Ted Kennedy was going to like fall over right on McCain's shoulder there.
And you, it was incredible.
It was pretty cute.
I think those two got something going there.
Maybe that's why McCain's cheek is all puffed up like that.
And my Ted looks like...
Maybe they're like exchanging oxygen or something.
Because it looked like Ted, like they just sucked the oxygen out of his face
and then all went into that cheek of McCain.
Just remember what I told you about John McCain, okay?
Don't get BS by that clown.
This is this.
Funny and lonely.
And Tina's butter and jelly.
This is by 16 KF.
This is the Neil Roger show.
This is your brain.
Go, go, go, go.
Go, go, go.
Any question?
I've been everywhere, man.
I've been everywhere, man.
That's what I had my share, man.
I've been everywhere.
I've been a Reno Scargo's Parko, Minnesota Buffalo's Toronto,
Wednesdays, Thursdays, Northern Wichita,
No more coffee.
Homegrown with that, a pound of my mat of a lot.
We're gonna shout Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona
We're gonna shout Carolina and Michigan
And Lake Devon Lake, traitor Lake East Lake
I'm in a great way, man
I'm in a great way, man
I'm in a great way, man
I'm in a great way, man
And then we're gonna watch it in East China
Take back the workouts
Yeah!
Come get him, boy
He was on the boat from a full-foot screen together
in the situational room
and he just really ripped an ass
and we'll come back back back back
but the government are dean
and he just ripped an ass again
and just kept the bop-up
and he had the...
We all had that same look of
like what do I do now on this face, you know?
In a situation room
What a wimp, what a worst, man
I guarantee you he hasn't got any unit
He don't have the mail, remember
I guarantee you that
We'll flip-scree
Okay, I'm gonna change the pool at the noon
because the one from today stays up all weekend
and we already know about this Katie Kirk thing
It's boring, you know?
So I'll try it in the morning
More of these traction, more stuff and nonsense
Yeah, that's right
Who cares whether it's Katie Kirk
reading off the teleprompter
or old 85,000-year-old
but a funny idea about you
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?
I mean Elizabeth Vargas is just fine there
She... you know, she looks okay
and she reads fairly well
She don't...
She don't fumble like Lou Dobbs
Fumpy and bumble and stumble and bumble
and that should be kind of a prerequisite
for doing anchor news now
as being able to read
Being able to read the teleprompter
That would help
Here's the new pool for noon to two
Got it?
I'm writing it down, I'll fix it there
because I'm on top of things today, man
You're under a lot of pressure and stress
I'll do you got a nice vacation next week
with a fan of it
It might be nice if I can get a hold of somebody up in the hill
so I don't have to go up there
No, you got to go all the way up to North Carolina
Right, I'm going to see you guys get away
I'm going to see you guys get away
It's going to get away
It's going to get away
It's going to get away
Thanks for leaving the heater on, Ma
Ma, well don't let that...
That'll teach you to let Ma go up there, okay?
You know, you talk a good game all this hatred
You get a miserable old bitch
but you let her go up there
Let her go up there
I would change the locks and the bagels
How do you like that?
That's a good idea
Yeah, change the locks
When that bitch goes all the way up there
Oh, guess what Ma, sorry
It's a lockout
It's a lockout Ma
And she would say
Thank you very much
And you'd say your mama
All right, here's the poll
And listen, we all got our issues, okay?
Yeah
Who should get...
Well, my mother ain't going to bother me anymore
That's all I can tell you
She's not going to nag, she's not going to confess
I wouldn't surprise me if I start having dreams
Nails
Oh, brother
I told you that one day I'm on vacation
My vacation started on a Friday
And it got to be like 10-0-2
10-0-2 on a Friday morning
I'm in bed, I'm resting, I'm sleeping late
Okay, I'm enjoying the first day of vacation
Well deserved
And the phone rings
And I run out of the...
Because I don't have any phone in my bedroom
And I run out of the other room and I pick up the phone
Nails, what's wrong?
And I said, I'm on vacation
Bitch
I didn't say bitch
But I was sure
Oh
Okay, here's the poll new to two
Who should get the permanent 2-4 slot on QAM?
What's your thing?
I mean, we might as well take care of this on this show
Because management's here don't seem inclined to do anything
They're like paralyzed
Emotionally and mentally
And spiritually, they're spiritually paralyzed
That's the problem with this crowd we got now
I got your manage
Gildi
I'm going to write these down as I'm saying them
Curtis
The big O
He was sucking up to me this morning so I better put him on
Remember that about how he's been listening since he was a child
Right
I think what he was trying to say is that I'm old but he's right
Who else?
Kimba
Kimbo camper
God forbid
Oh my God
I like him a lot but God he's so boring
Who else we got around?
Oh, Lenny Martez
Len Martez
The Crow
Experienced or winning is all about that
The Crow
Show, the Crow Show, the bow show
Showing off, the bow show
What about bring back Moe?
I'm putting that on there
Bring back Moe
Huh?
I mean, he ain't coming back but bring back Moe
You never know Moe
Maybe he's got some more naked pictures
I don't know
You bring back Moe?
Oh my leave it on
I heard a start from the beginning
Joe and Joe Zagaki
Joe Zagaki by Cracky
He could crack a point to share on the bottom side of it
So that's what I'm going to face that there
And we'll put that up for the weekend
Maybe they got some other suggestions
How about Ernie Sochin?
Let's put him on there
Ernie Sochin could do some biorathems
Maybe do a show on socks
Huh?
You never know
How about Reverend Jones?
I'll tell you one thing
If we're getting more for this show
I vote for it
It won't
It won't
Oh, she invited him to your house to do the show with you
No, you try that
No
Fighters, you have no command to be
I'm sorry Reverend
Tom 560 on the...
Yeah, we got something for it
You left your charge
On the Verizon Singular Wireless Lines
It's all a call of pride, man
The leak you're in chief, my ass
O'Lean Galexpert said the president of Bush had the unquestionable authority to approve the disclosure of sequenced CIA information reporters
But, but, added the leak was highly unusual
And amounted to using sensitive intelligence data for political gain
And I'd like this to be something surprise, you know
The old smear and shmere
It's all I know how to do
Smear and shmere
Whether it was Paulo Neal or Richard Clark
Or Joe Wilson, no matter who it is, smear and shmere
Across us, we're going to shmere your ass
How do you like that?
So this is like something surprise, you know
W.A.Q.Y.M. Hello
It's the Carl Rove FN Way
Q.A.M.
Not there, that line one
And there's actually the contact was made
You know what I'm saying?
In other words, it wasn't the usual line one, it's a shame
W.A.Q.Y.M. Hello
Q.A.M. Ola
Q.A.M.
Hey, is this new or...
Who's this?
This is Mike from Boca
Oh, let's go to Mike and Boca, how you doing Mike?
Yeah, how's it going?
I was just looking at the Q.A.M. website last night
Nettel, did you pick yours?
Yeah, we sure are, Glee
And I...
I didn't know you were a profile
They put your salary, I was wondering what the deal was
No, they didn't put my salary, I'm sorry, I hate to break the news, you didn't put my salary
Well, I mean they said that you make one point whatever a million a year
Not that another thing
I was wondering why would they do that?
You were calling for a loan, is that it? Call friendly Bob
No, I'm wondering why would they do that?
Why would they put your salary on there?
I don't think that my salary is on there to be honest with you if it is
I mean you're a profile
I'm in the Q.A.M. website
Yeah, because we want to rub your nose in it, that's why
All right, I was...
Go rub your nose in it
5, 6, 7, what is he talking about?
I didn't hear a word about that
Is that on the Q.A.M. website?
I'm just touching it in right now, you don't have to play no music, I'm right here
Okay, let's see, our hosts
Okay, our hosts
You're right, oh that's the Harold article, you see this is a moron
That's an idiot, check out the Harold article and we're going to help you check it out
I'm trying to click on it, but the Harold article is on it, I guess, huh?
Click here, and there's the Kevin Baxter article and it says right there
You know, that's the article from my 30th anniversary, okay?
Kevin Baxter wrote that, Q.A.M. didn't put it on here, you moron
Jesus, God, I mean if stupidity were like worth of billions, you'd be rich
You could buy the whole universe, man
It says right on there what it is, it's the Kevin Baxter article
It says, link to the Harold article, let's go, I mean, how come the hell did he put that?
Because Kevin knows you, that's all, plus he's got to figure a little bit low anyway
If I was only making that much, I couldn't afford to support the whole universe, okay?
Kevin, you idiot, you quizzling, but then against the Harold, expect them to get it right?
No, no
Anyway, George will give you a loan, and then we checked it out today, Josh, George is the one with the big Baxter
That's right, we learned it from each other
Between you and me together, we came up with a star box
That I've made a couple of stops after work, George has got the big big bucks
He's got a load folder in his pants
Yeah, and some money too
Oh, God, load you some money
595 volts, we're gonna have 1100 before the next break on that pool
Man, we are kicking some serious big fat smelly ass today
And I knew it, I could feel it when I got up this morning, I thought, oh, isn't it 140 yet?
Is that what we were saying for a long time?
George and I were commiserating me for this show, isn't it 155 yet?
Christ, I mean, Judas, somebody QAM, hello?
So you see, if somebody calls you a Judas, now that's a compliment
It used to be a real shot, you know, like a backstabber, and the big nose, Judas
Yeah, right, Judas, Judas, somebody QAM, hello?
Oh, is this Mike and Bunkan, is this loan departed?
Yeah, I get loan from Mike
How much you want?
Oh, I don't know, 5 bucks
Oh, 5 bucks, well, put a few zeros on him, and no sweat, he's got the big bucks Mike
In Bokershmuck, no brains, just bucks, God
How come they had a faffada?
Don't ask me, I didn't tell him to put it in there, you just make it up, okay?
They feel like they know something, you know, by putting crap like they're in there
Nobody's business whether they're making 50 bucks or 50 million dollars
Okay, believe me, talking to the people in this bowzo town for 30 years
Whatever I'm making, it ain't enough, trust me when I tell you, and even close to enough
In fact, when Joel Belga is back from over on a West Coast, I got some real interesting news for him
Crank that number up, then I'll take care of you guys, okay?
I'll take good care of my people, just like chicken neck there, don't let him down, do I?
Take care of his pathetic little ass, and what's he gonna do once I'm not here, no more?
See, I keep asking that because you know as well as I do, he's in denial
Oh, jeez, yeah, well, this is a guy, this is a guy who was permanently suicidal before he started making a couple of bucks
And now, you know, now that he's got this house, don't buy a house, I told you that if you're in any way connected with this radio business, don't buy a house
That's my best piece of advice for you, okay? Like somebody once said, don't buy a house
Amen, who the hell was that by the way?
What's some collar, wasn't it?
Yes, yes, I think what we ought to do, maybe I'll do it today
Is go through this thing, maybe they just aren't that many of mine, I don't know
Because there's just too much other stuff, you know what I mean? To find those?
What is this?
What is this?
I'm a priest, I'm a priest, I'm a priest
Who is it? What's going on? I'm a priest!
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
Well, that's our new format for money, I guess I wasn't supposed to play that yet
It wasn't surprised me, that's the only way we're going to get any numbers again
And then in this market, man, nobody's speaking English, it is really scary
That last trend, how the hell did we do any good in that thing, huh?
Holy moly!
Talk about heavy duty, Espan, you know, that thing was like...
You were thought that that was the arbitrage from Havana, wouldn't you?
You were the only one from Aliens home town, which you never know what that was, I keep asking you that
And you don't know what it is, Mr. Ashkamygay, what?
What, where does he live?
Aliens, Cuba, no, no, I'm talking about, I want really onto zip code
I don't keep track, I do know he stole my birthday and on the baby Jesus
No, I think you're more like Judas, I think you talk behind my back
Yeah, 12 minutes after you're 11, I say you keep a crappy company, that's what I say
Oh yeah, here we go, here we go, starting all over again, let's go right at it
Before your vacation, okay?
Let's get into a big knockout on Dragout Brawl on the air
About who I keep company with
I keep company with good people, that's why I'm far from down there
So I'm not keeping company with any of the people you're thinking about
How do you like that?
That's a good play
A couple of more coming here next week, briefly
Hey, here's a silly question, if you tried the pizza and pasta, John and Bakers
Well, certainly George and Josh have, in fact, they got John and Bakers food coming out of their body parts
And they still can't get enough, because John and Bakers is the best Italian restaurant
This side of the university drive and now two great locations for you
Brand new in the Sterling Town center on Sterling Road, just west of Pine Island, road and Cooper City
And the classic John and Bakers in Pember Pines, just west of Flamingo
And the home depot center on Pine's Boulevard, they call it that because they carry Coca-Cola classic
And let me tell you the food is absolutely great, huge forces of your favorite home style Italian Delights
Plus, with John and Bakers lower, low prices, you can take the whole family there for lunch and dinner
Even Josh and I could afford to go there today and stay well within your budget
It doesn't cost you a fortune to go have a great meal at John and Bakers
And when you go there, just mention to your wife, just give you a free half dozen of John and Bakers
World Famous Garlic Rules, you won't believe how big and how good and juicy they are
Take out or dine in tonight, for take out in Pember Pines calls around the Baker at 9.5.4
4.3.143.15 and by the way they don't use industrial style sauce out of a can
So you're not going to be on the can all day when you eat there, the food is fantastic and good for you too
In Pember Pines call 9.5.4, 4.3.143.15 or in Cooper City call 9.5.4
2.5.2.0.09.1
9.5.4.25.2.0.09.1 in Cooper City
The best pizza in town pasta, beer chicken, sausage and peppers and all your favorite subs
Man, it doesn't get any better than John the Baker, the best in town
This is Neil Rogers
This is 5.62.8
Friday you best
Donald, I understand that Melania's breastfeeding and her breasts are huge
Yes, bigger, better, stronger, more beautiful
You gotta be thrilled
I am, they're both very, very fascinating
I have a good relationship with Melania
And we have a lot of fun
It sounds like it, Melania, your thoughts?
I'm supposed to be here
Okay, she's having fun
And so my friend, I can imagine
Are you in prison?
Okay, I get the idea
I don't know
Melania, is it any fun for you?
I don't think so
It's all I can say
Okay, I'm a little off my ear
Because I'm faxing that the second-folder
Can you hear it dialing in the background in my fax machine?
My fax machine works by the way
Or is this sometimes?
Yeah, when they paid the bill, you mean long distance
Okay, said anybody was out the middle of the week
You missed them really excited there
Because the beastly's hadn't paid the long distance phone bill
As a result, no phone in the company would dial long distance
And of course, maybe that's why they couldn't make payroll on time on the 5th too
5.670560, I'm down
And I think it's going to go through and if I hear that beat
If I hear like
You'll hear it one moment please
Come on, you can do it
Now, there it is
That means it's an Eric's hands right now in the new poll too
Pulls an Eric's hands
1113 on this Katie Kirk thing
Would you watch Katie Kirk on a CBS evening news?
Because this is going off of there at noon
At noon we switch Eric, so hop on it
Well, the other one's, you know, not that much work
Will you watch here that bitch?
Don't watch evening news, network news 350
31.5% don't watch anyhow
Katie Kirk blows 282
Don't sound too promising
Less, don't watch CBS news now
And we'll watch here either 252
But you put those first three together, it's overwhelming
Isn't it? You put those three cameras together
Got like 70-some-up percent
Watch others now, but we'll watch here at 75
They've given us a shot
Watch CBS now and we'll continue, we'll watch here at 70
I hate this poll at 69
Watch CBS now but we'll not watch here at 15
In other words, I think what they're saying is that
The other ones, what they're saying is
Could she be any worse than Bob Sheeper
At least she's a little easier on the eyes
And she's under the age of 100
She just turned 64
How do you like that guy with the advantage age thing
Calling back again today? You know, it's just
I have no life
It's just so plain for an innocent bystander
A child out there when I hear you people
They have today trying to get a vicarious life
You're calling this radio show
Come on, you got to have something to be proud of
It's so sad
He was right, he was wrong, he was too quiet
He wasn't right either, he was also wrong
I was right, he missed
He had misinformation and she still got skanky nasty
100-year-old-looking feet
Vanna
You don't ever notice her feet, but nobody make it a part
Well, she was under with their feet, they've been under the last week
See if you watch the show as close as I do
Deputy QAM, hello
Yes, sir
Of course God didn't create you
Two parts collided in the big thing
Yeah, huh, huh, Deputy QAM, hello
Hi, Neil
I think that's a solution for your two to four hour
Yeah, you set up a race in the cage fight to the death
Between Len Martez and the crew
5-670560, 0.56 in the residence of Cedar Marbara
By the way, say how did you all find the workforce too?
You have been kissed on the cheek
WDQAM, hello
I know you need to talk
Deputy QAM, hello
It puts the basket in the lotion
WDQAM, hello
Hey George, yes
Where's your house and the rest of your life? I'm going to make a mistake out there to heat off for you
What?
Where's your house and the rest of your life? I'm going to read it here
Right in between Sparta and West Jefferson, 4 miles south and out of Wilson
You know, I'm not West by Cherokee
It's up in the other end of the park
Yeah, like you're going to give your address to the house up there to these people, but you know there won't be there no more
They've got no address, we just got directions up there
There you go
Just send him the key, he'll take good care of it
We don't want to hear about it, I don't want to know
I don't want to care, I don't want to hear about North Carolina, South Carolina
Nothing to be thinking about, I don't want to care about it
That's the way I feel about that
Send West's name back there to WDQAM
This log is an embarrassment
This log is an embarrassment
Even like Moon Trine could put together a better log than this Chris, this is humiliated
But we got some real heavy hitters coming in the out bed
The beast and fat boy, those are the heavy hitters he was talking about
Then you look for the iron gate
Somebody QAM, hello
Neil, can I ask you something?
No
Why does everybody always try my rap?
Talking about my music when there's a crap like Kid Spoddowby, Durand DeWand
Little Span Dex, there we thing happen
Oh man, I need a closure on that rat
Not closed it
Somebody QAM, hello as enclosure, you have QAM, hello
Hey Neil, yes sir
You know, it's really, really sucks man, the fact that in the toilet of your career you got this choice
And you have to stop the troughs around your neck
Yeah, and I'll go on like your clown
And I'll tell you why
George Polly saw the family guy last weekend
They had like one minute of fat guys graduating on prime time
I mean different fart noises
Sure
You can't even put a drop in because this lady doesn't even know the fur on rules
And that sucks man, it's terrible
Because I'm looking at you forever
And you know, you're still entertaining but man, they take away a lot of your weapons you know?
That's right, well yeah, like Joe Bell said, how the hell can we expect you to do a show with your handside behind your back?
And of course my response to that is well, but don't expect much
He's the one that said it, he's the new general man, man
He's over there in April's end
And I'm sure he's really fighting tooth and nail for us this weekend
Not, not
Well corporate says this, and George said that
Yeah, I have never seen such a wink in my life man or whatever she says he just bends right over
He just caves right in like a noodle spaghetti, you know that blood you get in your mouth
Corporate, huh?
Yes, well incorporate your eyes
That's what I have to say to them, corporate my ass
And I can totally love her move and enjoy
And all the beeslees and anybody who ever like entered that building over there
Man, oh there's the guy from Hollywood, Blood Holy Grail lost the Michael Beijing
He lost his life
He's a good old and savour of the publisher
He lost, you could be on the hook now for millions of dollars in legal fees
Are you sorry, you brought the case
I'm not sorry I brought the case, it was a
We felt that we had created intellectual property
Another constipated Brit no wonder
So his ass just based on the way he's talking, wouldn't you?
Oh, he's also author of the Jesus papers
Yeah, he was a role in them
In fact, I think both of these guys have been smoking them
The Jesus papers my ass
When you go into 7-11 just say can I get some Jesus papers
And then I want some of that good stuff like Sigourney Weaver wants
I wonder Harris got the new podium
Let's see, oh yeah, you're something
I bet you within just seconds he put that up there
Because I am so psychic, it's scary
In fact, Monday we're going to be doing the Elijah's Psychic Show
Calling for your own psychic being
Cost you 100 bucks though
Mike and Bokka will take care of the charges
In fact, we're going to get his credit card and just charge everybody
Everybody's call on Monday and his credit card
He's the big shooter up there, it's worried so much about how much I'm making
Schmuck, I think we ought to change it right now, don't you?
This Katie Curry pool I find very boring
Yeah, I agree, I hate this boring
You know what, you know what's boring sports talk is boring
Did that take you a long time ago that the day would come when all of it
It's just not the one of those things that will run its course
You know, just like all the different music formats that come they go
Like that party radio, remember that?
Yeah, I mean, did not tell you?
I was the first one to tell you that this is going to last about six months
That's my opinion, that's my opinion
This is the double 10
The weakest excuse for a format to play in derude and what ever the other one was over again, huh?
Safry do it
Yeah, Safry do it in derude over and over again
And I've got them both here by the way, I wouldn't play them
That's my opinion, I'm like this
I mean, that's crap radio
That's my opinion, I'm like this
Have another drink Mike, man
WC feels in him, same guy
Okay, let's see
Just put it out to find a result of this
That means I can switch the pool, isn't it tremendous power?
Don't you love when you do this?
Mm-hmm
And you click that thing and you're powerful
Oh yeah, especially like the other night when Eric got refused to change it
Do we ever find out what that was all about?
It's sick, like me
No, he's been sick all week
Oh, week, he's been sick all week
Every time I turn around you tell me Eric is sick
What's the hell we go?
We can't afford to lose him
God, if we lose Eric, what do you guys think?
Whoa
Then we have to fall back on Josh for our computer stuff
He didn't know his answer from his elbow
That's my opinion, I'm like Disney
Anyway, it's just a joke, just relax Josh
We know that you're really a stuute
Thank you
I'm voting for Mad Dog
Mad Dog needs to be on a two o'clock
Oh, I would have voted for Ernie Sochino, but it's too late now
Too late to turn back now
In fact, we got some votes on there already
I just changed it, and this audience is in a frenzy
Man, it's two letting Martez won the big O-1
The first four votes
The big rock solid
Oh!
Well, he was sure kissing my ass this morning
Have you do the effort he took that stupid call?
After, I wouldn't be surprised if Greeper probably called up the guy with the eyes at home
He's probably got his number
Because it seems like Greeper would be part of that group
Oh, no, I take that back
Because those people actually are groupies of mine
As opposed to Greeper or hates me in this show
Anybody in the left of a till of the hundredth grade poison
Yeah
But he's still probably called him up at home and set it up
Turn him loose on the big O
All this crap
All Robert Greeper, and you know what I love about the sports shows at the end of the show
And they all do it
I don't know if Hank does it
Not in things that we didn't have time to do it because he's doing a crossover with me
We're doing our cross-dress routine
But they all have to thank who's behind the glass
Who cares?
The audience doesn't care who's sitting back there
Like I got to like go in the hall
Josh Cordis is after controls
And George Rodriguez is in the room there sitting there up
To smoke at a fat one
Who cares, you know?
This station does so many stupid things, man
Let me give me a charge in there for about a week
That's all I want
Just put me in charge for a week I'll actually come back down there
Man, you'll see some heads roll around
Looks like a bowling alley
You'll see some heads roll out that door like crazy
Just a head part like in Saudi Arabia
God, would you love that?
Oh, don't get me started
Don't get me started
I would clean that place out
And Robert Greeper, he'd be one of the first ones out that door
Him and his head
Yeah
Come on up there all stand tuned for the release
Yeah, I do
Oh, I found it too late
Just give me the old row of flush
Okay, here's the final total on the Yachati Kurek thing
She makes me gag this whole thing, you know?
This is the ultimate
This is where they've come out
I don't understand why they don't have what's your name from entertainment tonight or inside addition
What's your name?
She was on yesterday punctuating about
Like, Lisa
Lisa given this
One of those, you know
Very heart-man
I rather have Mary Hartman doing the news
At least she'd put a few yucks in it
And Pat O'Brien, at least he's good for some laughs
Yeah, right
He could be like drinking right on the air there
Be less of that on WKRP
Have another belt pat, actin', have another pop
When you watch Kady Kurek on CBSAV News
Final total of 139 votes
And we cut this baby off at 1125
Aren't you excited?
Don't watch Network News
359, 31.5% of this is stoop crowd
Even though the show has been very newsy
Too newsy if you asked me
Like I think I would my paycheck
He's no see, we're newsy
Too nosy, mind your own business, okay?
Kady Kurek blows 289
Don't watch CBS now, won't watch her either
257, 2 Okie-Doki, Okie-Fonoki
I almost said something else
Watch other shows now
We'll watch her, those 78 are gonna give her a trial
A trial balloon
Watch CBS now, we'll watch her, 71
I hate this poll, 69
Watch CBS now, but won't watch that bitch, 16
Kady Kurek, final, final tally
Write that down
Gonna be a big quiz on Monday
Dude, this is scary, it's gonna be asking all the questions
I'm kind of scared just thinking about it
Not a joke
By the way, this new deal now is dated around 300 or 400 AD
300 or 400 AD
A hundred years span there
Yeah, and of course this is long after Jesus and Paul and Saul

And at the bottom of the screen they keep putting on their surprise
That's what they really believe
They really believe this crap

Can we add some of the choices over there?
Yeah, I like
I don't care
Well, wouldn't that be like I won't listen anyway?
What would be the other reason you wouldn't care?
I mean, I don't care it's fine
A lot of the time
I don't talk that on there anyway
But we just put I won't listen anyway
Oh, I missed it
Doesn't that is not synonymous with I don't care what would be the other reason you wouldn't care?
If you were going to listen, do you understand?
Well, we have a vested interest
Go ahead, put it on there
Whatever I'm not going to do
I think we touched all the bases, okay?
Just like the Marlins will in New York against the Mets tonight
Wow, on AM560 maybe on QAA
We got the Panther PENGWGAM on 1360 on the CAT
Boy, it goes to show you what we think about those Panthers, man
Of course they're done anyway
Stick a fork in them

I beg your pardon?
By the way, thank you for the pasta, public hazard
And also they've had it on sale for a while, it's very good
Good, excellent, okay, go grab a whole bunch, hop it up
Get a chest in time for Paisach and Easter
And don't buy that Easter candy, man
Wait till after Easter, because then they...
All the... especially the drugstores, Walgreens, CVS
After Easter, they cut the price down, they practically give it away
Because they've got... so they're just tons and tons of Easter candy
All those marshmallow eggs, you know?
You know what I'm talking about?
Right
Walgreens are famous for that, after that...
As soon as Easter is over, man, and they just cut that down like for a dime
You can get enough candy like kill yourself with, and it's suicides
Especially the peeps
I don't like the chocolate peeps
No, the marshmallow cover with the yellow sugar
Yeah, I know, they're called peeps, I know
I've had a pee, oh yeah, I know what you're talking about
Yeah, I haven't had those in a long time, bastard
Cotty
I'd rather have my Murray James, though
I'd rather say a way that plays for some still candy
Yeah, see they got... see it says right on the website
They got candies from the 50s and 60s
That doesn't mean when they were popular, it means when they were manufactured
So they were a little stale, according to our friend Sean with a poll
76 votes on there, man, it's 21
Who should get the permanent 2-4 slot on Cume
If these people ever get off their ass, if they ever get off the dime
Good God, it's time to get off the dime
Bring back Moe has got it doesn't look at that, bring back Moe
Don't know what you got, tell you lose it, that's what Ralph Donner said
The big O has got 10, Curtis 10
Reverend Jones has got 6
I won't listen anyway for, Geltie's got 4
See he's not doing all that great and we've got him on almost every day
Because he and the clearance are doing something
The Crow has got 3, Lenny Martens has got a pair of Kimba Volkamp
We'll finally get 2
George has got 1, Joseph Gackie's got 1, you're Tawai Joseph Gackie
Hey, we can do a show together
Isn't that a feather in your cap?
I read it down
And let's see, Suds Pullman got 1
I hate this poll and there's any socion of both got the big 1 and the first 82 votes
Curtis is just a little snapshot
That's a little snapshot, you understand
Speaking of snapshots, the latest poll is looking really bad
For the leaker in chief
President Bush is approval ratings hit a series of new lows in an AP if so
It's poll that also shows Republicans are renting their advantage on national security
Green election you're news for party struggling to stay in part
You're struggling, you're struggling, where's the struggling lady where we need her
Remember the struggling lady?
Oh yeah, struggling
Democratic leaders predicted that they'll seize control or want or vote chambers of Congress in November
Republicans said they feared the worst
Unless they political landscape quickly changes
Like maybe another terrorist attack would be good for them
Remember how the first one was for them politically?
You ain't saying nothing yet
Just 36% of the public approves of Bush's job performance is lowest ever rating in AP if so is pulling
I think it's time for another emergency meeting of the car law group
The Bush and Bin Laden's better get together again real fast if they want to hang on to power
By contrast, the president's job of approval rating was 47% among likely voters just before election day 2004
And I'm whopping 64% of my registered voters in October 2002 and I was down to 36% in this poll
If that is Bush's numbers maybe Congress is our worst just 30%
About 30, man!
Of the public approves of the GOP led Congress job performance and Republicans seem to be shouldersing the blame
These numbers are scary
We've lost every advantage we ever had, GOP pollster Tony Fabrizio said
Fabrizio, prepare the machina
The good news is Democrats don't have much of a plan, the bad news is they may not need one
I'm saying like Santina said, I wonder how you come up with those things so fast other than you
Like that
The things you put your brains all over your nice side for
Or then the full one
What are you going to do?
Nice college, boy
They want to get mixed up in a family business
Now you want to go down a police station, because it's like you're in a face a little bit
What do you think is the army where you shoot them a mile away?
You got to get a post like this
The big your blood that brains all over your nice side will leave soon
Come in!
You're taking us very close
You know why we love that movie so much?
Because most other ones suck, yeah?
Because it's so great and most everything else pales in a win significance of period to it
Look at this, Jesus and Judas
I actually say about Judas
Oh every time I see her on her I say Jesus Christ, are you on again?
That misses Limbaugh, I know she's your favorite

I think I just figured out the sort of Judas thing
Leave it to me
In his grand jury test in the morning, we're really called President Bush, a Judas
You see? That means there's a good guy
So now, of course, we have to turn all the history around
And we just, and just after we said that we discovered these tablets, man
And we said, take two and call us in the morning with another fairy tale
With some more bubble miceys
And so now, Judas, who used to be the bad guy, now he's a good guy
Kathy Lee, Gifford, on Larry King, oh my god, I'll be sure to avoid that
Like the plague, like my TV's got very bubonic, very, very
At least two, and I, the story changed, by the way, this is a bad news from Iraq, we got worse news
Oh no
No, yeah
At least two suicide attackers wearing women's cloaks, blew themselves up today in a Shi'ai Mosque in northern Baghdad
Killing at least 52, was 43 before it announced up to 52, at least 52
And they're still trying to put body parts together
And they're wounding more than 160
Second major attack against Shi'ai targets in as many days
CBS News correspondent Kimberly Dozier be saying
The violence came as US ambassador, Zalme Khalilah, whatever his name is,
Warded that Iraq faces the possibility of sectarian civil war
If efforts to build a national unity government do not succeed
Isn't that great?
We don't need George Vorson, we need to be able to link him for the civil war, right?
Honest Abe, honestly
567, we're taking a million calls today, man, and having a hell of a good time doing it
Let's take a look at that poll, this is a movie in Portante poll
Because maybe we got a shot of picking somebody out, okay?
Because they sure don't, 124 votes, who should get the permanent 2-4 slot on QAM?
Jim Manditch, 29, bring back Moe, 16, that is shocking
Don't talk, don't talk
I didn't realize he had that many relatives in town
Sats coolman's got a dozen, boy, he's zooming toward the top, he's side with Curtis, they both got a dozen
We all love Sats, what are you eating now? Don't tell me lunch from how he's got there?

Oh, please tell me you're not eating no chili, oh I'm eating some chili
So maybe guys should get some practice for next week when you're on vacation because I can see you won't be coming back anytime soon
Well I mean a chili too
No, well just like I said, I want to be alone
And I think I'll get my wish
Going to be a little crowded with the two of you both in their fightin' for that one stall
Maybe you can find the twin hole around the backyard
Yeah, I can use the other one
The other guy's got a twin hole
Josh can use the tall stall, he's a tall boy
I use that stall, I like that one so I had to cover that guard
It's comfortable man
The bars are good especially if you have any growth in the room
Who should get the permanent 2-4 slot on QAM?
Man, I wouldn't let me have all see interrupted me here
Man, it's 29, sud 16, bring back most 16, Curtis 13

Oh geez, Gildy's got 5
Vote camper 3, Joseph Gackie 2, Lenny Martez 2, Ernie Sochen 1
I hate this poll, don't have any, see they like this one
This is the kind of craft that they would like to sink their teeth into
Although it finally got a vote, long with Ernie Sochen
They want a few left out
This, this is the kind of garbage they want to sink their teeth into
Makes them feel like they got something to say about some
You know, which they don't need it a week but nevertheless
Oh, I do have one story, can I do this one?
Do it
After the 2004 presidential election, Kaihoga County election workers in Ohio
was secretly scurried rules designed to make sure that all votes were counted correctly
A special prosecutor's charging now
While there was no evidence of vote for out yet
The prosecutor said their efforts were aimed at avoiding inexpensive and very public hand-recount of all votes cast
Three top county elections officials have been indicted
And Ernie County, that's the Ohio Ernie County prosecutor Kevin Baxter
Kevin Baxter, who wrote that article says more indictments are possible
Michael Vu, executive director of the Kaihoga County elections board, said workers followed procedures that have been in place for 23 years
He said board employees had no objection to doing an exhaustive hand count if needed
Meaning they had no motive to break the law
Internet bloggers have cried foul since 2004 about election results in Ohio
One of the key states that decided the election
They've been tracking Baxter's investigation with online post about the indictments
Baxter's prosecution said as I know Ohio's safeguards for ensuring that every vote is counted
Baxter charges that Kaihoga election worker is mindful of the month long Florida recount in 2000
Not only ignored the safeguards but worked to defeat them during Ohio's 2004 recount
Candidates for president from the Green and Libertarian parties requested the Ohio recount
Obviously not the Democrats because there are a bunch of whooses
State laws and regulations specify how a recount works
Election workers in each county are supposed to count 3% of the ballots by handed by machine randomly choosing precincts for that count
If the hand in machine counts match the other 97% of votes are recounted by machine
If the numbers don't match workers repeat the effort
If they still don't match exactly the workers must complete the recount by hand a tedious process that could take police and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars
But the fix was in it the Kaihoga election board Baxter says
The fix was in
Got it?
They may not be real good at governing but they sure are good at two things stealing elections and smearing and smearing
It's the Carl Roe vFn way
Well I'll tell you one thing by Monday
Oh that's where you'll be on vacation anyway but you'll be looking at this over the weekend
Who me?
Yeah you'll be checking this pull out it'll be an ego unlikely
Yeah you will look at that you're all you're almost up to I will listen anyway
Other times you put me on there I've never voted for myself
You've almost I didn't vote for you that's because you weren't on there yet
Plus you're not doing how now can you do to to for anyway
What kind of crap is that?
The kid it's moot and they're not going to hire suds and they're not going to put on a non sports show this is all moot
This is just a you know my story
It's an exercise right it's an exercise in fruitility

You and your rag head friends over there in Saudi Arabia
Let me say it again you know you believe whatever you want all united people out there
The Bushes and the Saudis man
They are as there is tight as a snare drum
There is tight as the cheeks of a witch's
That's how tight they are
So you can you know you can confabulate all you want all kinds of cockam maybe ideas in your head
The fact of the matter is that the world is being raped at it okay
But and he can come on there talking about alternative sources of energy
And do that smoking chip routine in his the fact of the matter is man
The gang rape is a real laugh to these people because that's what's going on
And of course then we just have on there the other day about the record profits these people are making
But their deposits still are good enough man
Not good enough
You're never going to satisfy exon and mobile and unicale all these other people
And of course when it comes to unicale I wonder how homicarsize doing over in Afghanistan
You know homicarsize who of a mousher of says hasn't got a clue what's going on in his own country
That's what your buddy Mousher of said last week
He said homicarsize don't have no idea what's going on in Afghanistan
That's what he said
See if they would stop beating so much deli there if they would sub-trend imitate the Jews
They may hate the Jews but they keep eating all that deli
That's why they're like that all the time
In fact his network carsize say he said the food in Afghanistan is haloscious
Which ought to be in your lexicon by now I give you that to begin to show this more
In top of the show we give you haloscious
The opposite of deli is haloscious
And if you have a mewats you don't like you might want to say it correctly in Russian
Spault near haloscious
Got it?
Got it
All right, I hope you take your oats on this because old chicken and he sure does some damn good dish
Because it's very embarrassing the bad stuff too
I don't want to correct them on it because it's funny when it's delicious
It does say they would say that it's bad
Right
Kind of like butchered ferritail
Let's talk about the Rocky and Bullwinkle what are you saying?
Now now we're talking
I mean South Park is great and the daily show is wonderful because it's scripted and he's not funny at all
But the show is scripted and he reads it well
But I think now is the time for fractured ferritails coming back to it
Let's dig up the Hans Connryne and whatever it holds on
Hans Connryne
He's taking a lot of ginger speaking for it
What?
Ah!
Oh!
Oh!
It's supposed to be the Bullwinkle show tape
Got the wrong script from the telephopsy
I think you know it's not the same
He's a hunky binky report
No, no, the Bullwinkle show
And I am your booster of ceremonies for the next half hour
Bullwinkle, he's still
I've never heard this before
I mean, whatever show has the host who sings dances, recites poetry
And has athletes
on this network anyway
I suppose you're wondering why I called you all here this evening
Well, this is why it's the Bullwinkle show
Wow
Yeah, that was worth the price of admission
Okay, that's it
One of my all-time favorites
I think maybe over the weekend I'm going to watch all those bullwinkle DVDs that chicken X and me
I would
They're great
I'm going to chuckle on my face

This is New Roger! Oh, oh, this is 5.62 am
This is Mark Morgan is the 12-1 hour on QAM
George Forsky saying, don't even prove they knew as part of the troll
But such a distinct show, 10 million folks knocking from Mexico
They're hiding in the trees when they're caught the feds just as they're free
They get paid, got these, the 30 cents from all your neighbors' lawn
Your name is a grown, your neighbor, our borders have more holes than a cloud of graces
Looks like we'll be cooking up more hot tomahe
Sometimes I wish I had a fence around me, but I need a maze from my home
When I get used to getting another body advantage and my 74-744 did the number keeps rising and rising
Other than that, oh, we're fine!
They're going hunky-dory over there in Iraq
What do they do? Like a digs-all puzzle thing?
Speaking of the immigration thing in that bit we just played, which is an old one that they resurrected because they never straighten out the immigration problem
So that bit is always good
The Senate side tracks we'd be immigration legislation today, leaving in doubt prospects for passing a bill offering the hope of citizenship to millions of men, women and children living in the US illegally
Illegally, law-breakers, people who came in illegally, not people who waited online like real immigrants, but illegal arrests breaking the law
A carefully crafted compromise that supporters had claimed could win an overwhelming majority
Remember how breathless they were yesterday?
Oh, they come up with a straight kayak
Received only 38 of the 60 votes needed to protect it from weakening amendments by opponents
Republicans were united in the 38 to 60 parliamentary vote, but Democrats who have insisted on no amendments, lost six votes from their members
Six of their Democrats lost their members, and you can tell that
What if Hillary lost her member yet?
You know, they keep talking like she's a sure thing and, oh, I know
The new party, the new party, they bought off, did the decoy party, did they play it?
Talk about a death wish
That's what the D stands for a Democratic party, death wish
God
Anyway, let's move along, Kayddo, no need getting depressed, not much we can do about that
Okay, a lot of problems out there, we're sure not going to solve them on some stupid as show on a sports talk radio show
I mean, sports talk radio station, excuse me
I bet you we got almost 200 votes on the new pool, what time we put this up, 1125?
If I'm not mistaken?
1.99?
1.99?
Aren't you excited?
And you have passed, you're making a move, mister, you're in the third place
Oh, I'm having for the big time now
You're tied with mo!
I think there's something symbolic to be said about it
I would have done a show with him if no one else would have
Nobody else would have
It would have been a pit
You would have been good all right
You would have been the champion in the shins under the table, I'm sure
That's a slot fight before
And Yanke is a piece, Yanke that muskrat
How about you if I, now, see, count your votes ahead of time
Like, die bowl of man, just like Bush and Ohio
200, right on the money man
Ernie Sochens got one for two to four Lane Martes, three, Jersey Gaki, three
I hate this poll for the crow's got six, the crow
When's the crow on today, is Yanke today? No
I'll come on to me, we'd rather have mad dog and Curtis on than the crow
What's wrong with us?
Bo Campers 7, Gildi 8, Reverend Jones 11
Even Reverend Jones has got more than Gildi
We got Gildi on every day, you whizzling clearance, you idiot
Let's see, what does that tell you?
Listen to me
These people don't get who did mo for amusement on this station
Reverend Jones or Gildi, okay?
Ernie, is there any, I mean, you know, we put that Gildi on
They get like 90 shares, this is a mafia
All right?
Remember when I talked about that?
About how they could put Bo Campers on doing the mo in Gildi show
Gildi 8, Reverend Jones 11, the big old 15, Curtis 17
They don't want Gildi enough with Gildi already, okay?
Enough of this squeaking, I won't listen anyway, teen
Bring back mo 19, George Rodriguez 19, you've moved from nowhere
From Oblivion into a tie with a mo in my eye
I got 20 so though, you must have not reached that
Oh yeah, well let me refresh it
No, I still got, let's see
No, you got 23 now?
Oh geez
You've moved ahead of bring back mo and I won't listen anyway
George 23, mad dog 35 and suds has got 36
suds away and they won't hire him anyway because he doesn't do a sports show
That's right, plus he doesn't work alone anyway
That's right
I mean, I love suds but the idea of him being out from two to four
It's just ludicrous, you know what I'm saying?
Okay
I'm just telling you, I'd rather go ahead and suds farth and most people talk
Really?
Yeah
Oh, you've never heard him farth, have you?
I don't want to hear him farth
I don't want to hear him in the lobby
I don't want to hear Joyce Farth, it's like a beatbox
I want to hear the sounded Joyce's gurgle, the gurgle
I want to hear the sound of the rly breath
That's what I want to hear, that's it
I want to hear the last gurgle from her burgl
The last, the death rattle from Joyce
Oh man, I would have a party in my pants
Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention this long ago today
I apologize profusely
Because I don't want to be too nosy but
And nobody cares about this except inside radio people, you know?
You know what I mean?
Absolutely
Michael Crushham

And isn't it interesting?
24 hours from Tulsa, Gene Pinty just died a couple days ago
You see the way these things were?
I think Michael Crushham
Kind of mysterious, he didn't wake up the next day, 65 years old
And the Pinty helped him in concerts, feeling pretty good?
He doesn't wake up the next day because I saw Michael Crushham
I'm going to testify, man, I'm going to be like Scooter Libby
I'm going to hop on my scooter and go to DC red and testify against Michael's Crushham
A queer channel in Miami, you know?
What a bunch of grave robbers, what a bunch of lunatics
Pete Rogers perfect for them, the assassinat
Let's put him on from 2 to 4 to tell some real real life stories of how many lives and careers he's destroyed
Let's put him on, be captivating radio
I mean, that's a sport for him, it's a sport

Otherwise, I'm going home

And, oh look at this, last day of the campaign in Italy
Is that where this thing is? I'm sure that, because, huh?
Yeah, the Italian election
And Burlesconi's giving him that, what do you say?
I can't say the word on the ear, we don't say it
It's that French thing, it's the buff on due
No, no, it wasn't the fondue, that was your confusing him with the Scalia
Oh, that's right, you're right
No, no, he was doing the one with the D head deal

WQIN, hello
QIN? Canada
I beg your pardon?

Even if you're on Uranus
WQIN, hello
Hey Neil, how you doing?
Pretty good
How about solving two problems?
Why don't you put chicken neck on from 2 to 4
That way we'll get a paycheck
Yeah, that's a good idea, get him off my back
No more Paul Harvey bits, no one's coming in?
No
No, I like this
Well, I'm happy for you, okay, we'll pass that along to the powers that be
Every time he calls you once you're a Paul Harvey bit
I mean some of them are kind of amusing, they're okay
Right, they're not exactly my favorite rights, but they're all right
But let me see if I can find one that's really a hoot
Do you think there's one that's really good?
Uh, let's see
Good morning, Americans, it's Paul
Paul Harvey, stand by for news
A couple had two little boys, Johnny and Jimmy, ages 8 and 10, who were
excessively mischievous
The two were always getting into trouble and their parents could be
confident that if any mischief occurred in their town, Johnny and Jimmy were
involved in some capacity
Their parents were at their wit's end as to what to do about their son's
behavior
So they heard that a clergyman in town had been successful in
disciplining children in the past, so they contacted him and he agreed to
give it his best shot
He asked to see the boys individually, so Johnny the eight-year-old was
sent to meet first with the clergyman, who sat Johnny down and asked
him sternly where is God?
Johnny made no response, so the clergyman repeated the question in an even
stoner tone, where is God?
Johnny again made no attempt to answer the clergyman raised his voice,
even more and shook his finger in the voice face, where is God?
And at that, Johnny bolted from the room, ran directly home and slammed
himself in the closet
His brother, Jimmy, followed him into the closet and said, well what happened?
Johnny said, we're in big trouble this time, Jimmy God is missing and they think
we did it, Paul Harvey
Good day, good day, sir, it was kind of cute, he liked that
Thank you, after it was fine, alright
Somebody QAM, hello
I got a suggestion for the 2 to 4 hour
How about all mobs?
Mobs?
Yeah, all mobs, all the time and all the pieces
Mobs, and then what's that guy's name that you went to see?
You who has shy fits, so whatever, right?
Yeah, who's a shy fit, plays the violin from 2 to 4?
I guarantee you could break a one share, that's what we had last two trends
with Mowazan, all this crap about brain mobs back
If you liked mobs, how come you didn't put it on when he was on it?
How come you didn't write it down?
That's the thing that I don't understand
If you liked him a lot, how come he didn't write it down?
He was good for a few yucks
Don't even add
W-Q-A-M, hello
Q-A-M, hello
Wink and suds, 2 to 4
That's why I like him
Yeah, that was Gilbert, we should put him in
No, that was not, it was
It was, it was, get out of here
It was, I thought it was somebody doing a blind mic
That was Gilbert, Wink and suds, 2 to 4
Yeah, they would talk to you, Rick would talk to you
He talked to all the losers
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
And of course there was Alex Venet, he thought he was going to make...
You know, you could roll Rick anything like, hey, you know, go bird's eyes
You know, of course, hard ass
Hard ass red-knit
That's a stock market thing, it's boring
No, you couldn't tell me anything because he was a legend in his own mind
That's why he's out in Moan Long Hospital
Who were you, and Gary
I remember how both were brought used to Moan his lungs
I think he's Moan Booker's lungs long now
He would wear his lungs well, he did it too
Really?
You know, and again, but that was the same story
You know, some people were good in the afternoon
Like Hank and Rick and suds
And then they put him out in the morning
And everybody was going well like
What?
What would you do that?
Why would you do that?
Some people are afternoon people
And they do very, very well, they belong there
And then they put him in the morning
And like, give my handy craft
And like, oh, is he, how come he's not doing great?
Right? Sorry?
I mean, you know exactly what I'm talking about
I'm talking about, I don't know, I'm still like
You're doing your little tap dance now
Just going to hear the communication next week
You're thinking the sides of the sand
So that's where the Rick and suds days before and after
And the same thing here
Right
That's the Pete Bulger School of Programming
Just shut the deck
Keep shuffling the deck, that's right
Shuffle the deck, shuffle the deck, shuffle the deck
And keep hoping that there's something lands right, you know?
No, never mind, you have a following
That's what he specializes in when he had the light bulb under his tutelage there
For a little while, Pete Bulger was under his tutelage
And believe me, from what I heard about his tutelage
Nobody would want to be under that
Like being under a dark cloud
God
And he just kept shuffling him around and shuffling him around
Oh yeah, let's put, you know, uh, what's your name?
Joyce Kaufman on in the afternoon
Let's put her on in the morning now
Let's put normal back on here
I mean, anybody would put normal on here in the first place
Needs mental health
Get with it normal
Okay, get that joebell straightened out
Get some of this stuff done and quit talking a good game

I don't really know because he's only got, he's only got knee-in votes.
And probably most of those are Robert Greeper.
Anytime you see the number, you know Robert Greeper's fine finger is in it.
You know what I'm saying? Deep in it.
Wait until you hear this story.
This is his story.
I'm going to do the story.
What's his facts?
He's going to grind some of the Brandy's tech from Monday.
He's going to grind.
He's on top of it.
He's doing his job because he's a real sales guy.
Other than that, we ain't got much.
We got Todd Dreck.
And we got Hot Shot Brett from New York.
From somewhere from Hungary.
Tacoma Washington is just talking about taking a bite out of crime.
Government lawyers tried to confiscate the gold truth caps,
known as grills from the mouths of two men facing drug charges,
saying that dental work qualified as seasonal assets.
They had them in a vehicle headed to a dental clinic
by the time the fence attorney is persuaded to judge the healthy procedure.
They were going to yank the gold truth caps out of their mouth.
The grills?
Yeah, the grills.
I've been doing this for over 30 years.
And I've never heard of anything like this.
Richard J. Trouberman, a past president of Washington
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
It sounds like Nazi Germany, when they were removing the gold teeth from the bodies,
released then they waited until they were dead.
Good point.
Oh, you can't take my grill.
The prosecutor said,
Why?
Think I'm chilling while your phone going from a grill in?
Yeah.
Let's do a little drill in.
What do you say?
Prosecutors had a warrant to seize the gold dental work for the documents
and lawyers involved in the case.
But they eventually abandoned the efforts, say they mistakenly thought
the grills were removable.
They were like a plate, like my used to have.
Right.
Customized tooth caps popularized by rappers, such as Nelly,
are made of precious metals and jewels and cost $1,000 for a full set.
Some can be snapped out of the teeth, while others are permanently bonded out of the teeth.
Flennard, teen eel junior, old flennard.
Hey, Flennie.
And Donald Jamar Lewis, both at primarily bonded grills.
Neil and Lewis, both charged with several drug and weapons violations were taken to.
They, from the federal defense incident in the US Marshal's Orifice,
whether or told the government had a warrant to seize their grills.
Oh, God, I wonder if you can make a good burger on those.
They called their lawyers as they were about to be taken to a dentist at Miriam Schwartz,
Neil's Public Defender, Miriam Schwartz.
A permanent stay at the seizure order was that day by US-Magestor AJ Kelly Arnold.
Was that day at Megazins?
Acid forfeiture is a fairly routine procedure,
and our attorney is running the impression that these snapped out like a retainer.
The defense force criticized what they said was a clandestine attempt to have the grills removed.
It would be a thrill to yank out your grill.
It's shocking that this kind of action by the federal government could be sought
in a complex and secret without anyone being notified by the federal government,
say, said Xenon Peter Olberts, who represents Lewis,
reminds me of the secret detentions in those terrorist cases.
They're going to pull out your, they're going to yank out your grill, okay?
That's what this Nazi government of ours is doing now.
They're going to get a real thrill by yanking out your grill.
So cut the crap. Sounds kind of...
You guys!
...to me.
I don't know what to do.
No, get rid of him.
263 votes on a pool.
Boy, that's in less than an hour.
This is almost like old time.
Can we do this for old time's sake?
See, I told you, man.
We got to like, start...
We can't worry about the other 20 hours.
I said that a few days ago, and then I thought, like, I shouldn't have said that.
I shouldn't have said it.
I know it's hard.
That would be a way.
You know, we like to be a team player no matter what stage it is,
and the occasion to get queues to well, you know,
near what everybody by which is crap.
You know, nobody promotes the other shows more than I do.
But, but, you know, we got to start taking care of business here from Tentative 2,
because the rest of this thing is crumbling like a smashed grill.
Yeah, ain't good.
Crumbling like that tooth of mine last a couple weeks ago.
Remember that?
That's right.
That you get some grilling when you went in there?
Oh, no.
Ice Raid South Florida head shops.
Uh-oh.
You would think that a Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement Ice
Division, formerly INS, would be busy fighting terrorism and securing the borders,
but you'd be wrong.
According, this is from a website called StopTheDrugWord.org.
According to Ice, at least part of its mission is to keep America bomb-free.
You hear that, George?
Bomb-free.
It's the bomb show.
Free bugs?
Some of its special agents spent last Friday serving federal search and seizure warrants
against five South Florida head shops all in the Gables area.
In the Moral Gables area, the range resulted in the seizure of 5,500 drug-perfinated items
worth more than 250 grand ice reports.
What if they got any grilles?
The raiders didn't limit themselves to pipes and bongs, however.
They also seized rolling papers and stash containers designed to look like commercial products
such as women's lipstick, chews and pages.
Rolling papers?
So what are we going to start writing the circle K?
They're next up a little farther.
Monday?
They got the good stuff out here.
These shops sell a dangerous lie about drugs and drug use.
They say, Jesus, Tories, oh Jesus Christ, specially did in charge of ice in Miami.
It's obvious they want people to think it's okay to take drugs.
This is simply unacceptable.
Unacceptible.
Unacceptible.
To take drugs.
Did you know that when you're smoking a fat one you're taking drugs?
I didn't know that.
Under federal law, speaking of smoking by the way, when the hell are cigars getting here?

This drill reassuring, even though it's a Brit story from London
British anti-terrorism detectives has scored a demand from a plane after a taxi driver
earlier becomes suspicious when he started singing along to a track by punk band the clash
For the other one
When they make you suspicious, well which track was it no later?
Well, we'll get to that, just relax
Detectives halted the London bomb flight at Durham T's Valley Airport in Northern England
And Haraj Man, who arrived, sounds like one of them, Shmata Head, 24 was taken off the plane
The taxi driver become worried on the way to the airport because
Man had been singing along to the clashes 1979 anthem London Calling, which features the lyrics
Now war is declared and battle come down while other lines warn of a meltdown expected
Man told British newspapers the taxi had been fitted with a music system
Wish a lot of him to plug in his MP3 player and he had been playing the clash
Prokoharam led Zeppelin and the Beatles to the driver
He didn't like Led Zeppelin to the clash but I don't think there was any need to tell a police man told the Daily Mirror
A Durham police spokesman said Man had been released after questioning but had missed his flight
The report was made with the best of intentions and we wouldn't want to discourage people from contacting us with
So if you're going to listen to the clash, London Calling, they're going to like call your ass and give it a good grilling
And then steal your grill, I like that
56670560, let's do another sweep, another phone call sweep here, a thousand in a row, okay?
50,000 calls in a row, we got Geltie from the entrance center with 2 this afternoon
Because the Panthers are playing Sid Crosby in the penguins tonight, and that promo, Sid Crosby
If you're going to do promo for the Panthers, at least get it right, nobody calls him Sid
Sid the kid maybe, but not Sid, Sid me, okay? Sid me
Remember that show, welcome back, what was that show with Tony Randall?
Some kind of a show, Sid me, I don't know
Love Sid me, if you say so, never been there though, I never met him

Hey, good afternoon Neil, how are you?
Good afternoon, when is Todd today, Sid me go?
Hey, I'm just on, thank you for the Dreamfields' pasta, I had my fiancee get some, the first week you had mentioned it

56670560, pound 5C, it's either feast or famine, you know what I mean?
First they were saying nothing about it, and now we're getting like so many calls, it sounds like a setup
It's starting to start to hurt a little fishy to me, you know
Well fishy though, was that awful and nasty stuff, what was that call?
Oh, sure, it's hockey me, it's hockey
Oh, don't ever tell anybody I had talked about that stuff, God that was bad
It was like a poop away, it was just like sneaker laces, not true laces but sneaker laces, you know white
Uh-huh, real bad
Oh, look at this chronic, chronic rust, the chronic encoco, see I told you this chronic
I'm going pulled, being conducted by AOL today, which party would you prefer to control Congress?
So far, 129, almost 130,000 votes, 101,000 votes,
Democrats 66% Republicans, 26% other 9% says, wow have a fine weekend, T.C. chronic encoco, well you know that's great but today is only the 7th of April, elections on November 7th or other, 1st week in November
And knowing that Democrat party as well as I do, and also knowing that Republicans and all these shenanigans they can pull, like maybe another terrorist attack or something convenient like that
It wouldn't surprise me to see that Democrats say, that's their speciality man, yanking defeat from the draws of victory, they can do it like nobody else
You'll see, I hope I'm wrong but don't start counting votes yet, unless you got the right machine
Somebody QAM, hello, and we know the Republicans have the right machines man
Somebody QAM, hello, not there, boy this is a real sad turn of events, you know what, it's all your fault Russ
Somebody QAM, hello, QAM
Hey, Neil, yes sir, who still use rolling papers, haven't they heard of Blanc?
Still use Blanc, there's a bastard roll you weed in today
Yeah, can we know?
All right then, shall we get rid of the roll, it won't get full
Okay, get rid of the paper man, that's not easy to do
Yeah, so you have to have a certain technique, Sigourney weaver will show how to do it
She didn't have to have to practice and she did it pretty good
Well they got machines for that, they got a good machine to do that now
Where, where those places that are getting busted
Oh, yeah all of them headshots
I don't know, they got headshots here, I don't see anybody rating or putting them out of business
I just, that's amazing to me, it's just, no it's not
It's par for the course
Thank God they don't got no other places at Amsterdam
Where you guys are going to be traveling off to with all that money that you're going to be getting back and expated
Oh yeah, they're going to put a little, when Joe Bell comes back from the West Coast
He's going to have a big stack of cash
Just like Sandy Claus, because that's what he wants to be anyway, you know
He wants to be the good humor man, he's going to be rolling or handing out hundreds here, thousands there
Wait till he gives you that billion dollar bill, that's going to be a real hoot
You know that purple one would Joyce's picture on it
Actually it's Joyce's ass on it
Dominic Q-A-M, hello
Q-A-M, hello
Q-A-M
Speak to him
Speaking
Yeah, I was looking all over the internet for finding where the Getschke ward or the origin of it
I can't get anything, can you help me with it?
Where what is?
Getschke, I love the ward that you keep viewing but I can't find it
Oh you're looking for Getschke, he's just going to the Evadec in you'll find thousands of them
Or just go to South Beach, you'll find them all over there
Not South Beach, I mean whatever the North Beach, whatever that is
It was the way Arthur Godfrey Road where that virulent anti-Semite used to hang out
And you'll see all of them Getschke's, in fact, wait till about June or July, what it gets to be about 140 degrees in the shade
And they all got the big hats and really heavy coats on and the outfits and the beards out of their knee
Well I tell you one thing, if they ever skinned any they don't have to worry about all they got to do is put their stick their beard on it
Soak up all of that blood
Getschke
And of course when I was talking about the Haseedum, I mean they're good post-toothed children
But just take a look at all the guys roll around on those magic carpets with their rectum up high in the air
So what's the difference between a Getschke and a Shmendrick?
There's no relationship with Shmendrick, he's just like a Shmuck
What Shmendrick got to do with Getschke?
Of course, why?
That's one of the askin'
Well I wish Mendrick has gotten out of religious thing
I don't know Getschke, his first name is Haim
There's always Haim Shmendrick who is like a specific Getschke
Okay
I tell you one thing, if I see a bunch of Muslims with their ass open to hear their words awfully
I could be wrong with this is meal wrong
Are they arguing on this carpets?
This is 5.62.8
And up with the Panthers already
When the hell knows the baseball season begin anyway, huh?
Jumpin' on cowsheets
He's mayor of the crowd cheer
Zoggin' a foul scienceology
He's very in cave
Who will they show their age?
Who are they new blood by our team?
Tom Cruise has got to be the king of holy milk
When he talks now, do you expect us to fall?
Thank you
The Tom Cruise should go in front of the body
Because his mind has turned into purple clothes
They lost in a black hole
Since he's split with the cold
He's getting crazier by the day
His an empty cover
Since cellar on hover
Should go a blow, act just brain cells away
Tom Cruise has got to be the king of holy milk
When for sex he's straight to the cycle war
Absolutely
Super
He makes stupid claims and calls bad law or bad name
And I know
He's simply out of his door to find a thing
Young denial of being clinically out of his door
So I call it as looking for guest seasons for our new episode
My website is called bubbygram.com
Yiddish glossary
I haven't found Gesheek for the time being
There's only about 7,000 pages on this again
Right?
The highest spelled one
How do you spell one?
Getski
I don't even know if that's how you spell it
I don't know
And most of the Yiddish words you never see in print
Anyway, it says Yiddish arose around a thousand years ago from middle-high German
And spreads throughout the ghettos of central eastern Europe
Barrowing words in the countries in which the Jews lived
Thus it incorporates words from Hebrew, Russian, Polish, other Slavic languages
Romance languages and later English
Before WWII Yiddish was spoken by more than 11 million people
Today it's spoken by perhaps a tenth that many
Many assimilated Ashkenazi American Jews
Whose grandparents or great-grandparents only spoke Yiddish
Or who spoke as their first language, barely know any words at all
This is a shanda, a shame, a pity
Many Yiddish words have entered the American English lexicon
You'll find Maven, expert and Ghana thief in most dictionaries
Words such as Schlepp, Schmachter, Naish, or regularly used in film
On TV and books and magazines without translation
The addition of Orion being with S.H.M. to donate something of little consequence
Hospital, Schmospital, so long as you're healthy
Is purely a English construct
It's got examples of syntax that Jews use like smart, he isn't
Sarcasm through innocuous diction, he only tried to shoot himself
Scorns to reverse word order, already you're discouraged?
Fearful cursive sanctioned by nominal cancellation
May all your teeth fall out except one so you've never too late got forbid
And then it goes to tell you how to pronounce CH
As if you're cleaning from your throat
As if your R is gently rolled as in a single R in Spanish or French
Now let's see, I'm looking, we're never going to find
Oh, I see these are alphabetical order, maybe I could have found Getski
I'm going to have to go back to this, excuse me, I didn't realize
Does it have Schmachter?
Well, if I'm not to the G's yet, how can I be to the S's?
I'm going to check the G's
Yeah, it's got holy cheeses
You have to eat a lot of cheeses to get enough flim in your throat
Alavai, or Abiga Zunz, as long as you're healthy
Hospital, hospital, Abiga Zunz, Alavai, it's your only happen may have come to pass
Alta Kaker, oh that's just our Florida thing
Oi, literally an old, an old Schmitt, or as we say in English in old part
Sometimes simply called AK
Years ago my mother was trying to convince my then eight-year-old nephew that they actually knew quite a bit more yetiest and he realized
For instance, you know what, another Kaker, she said knowing he'd used the word around him often
Is face lit up, yes I know that one, it means a slow driver, he said
Ghanif, literally America, oh America Ghanif, literally America the thief, which has both positive and negative connotations, Ghanif his thief
Oh, there's words on here I never heard of
Well, let's go, lay a load on it
Oh, I know, I did this skull strange, Bala Busta, I see
And if he didn't organize, I'm going to make a homemaker that Donna Reed was some Bala Busta
I just, Beria, a Beria is a regular Martha Stewart, a homemaker who puts the rest of us to shame
Byshert means its destiny was meant to be, fated to be, it's Byshert
Bissle, give me a Bissolox on my bagel, would you darling? Bissle is like, oh, little is even like a little less than a Biss a little bit
Breath, oh yeah, breath is a gag to vomit
Braca, a prayer
Right
This is the first time in my life, I'm a hundred years old and I've never seen most of these in print
Bubble Miser
Literally a gram, sir, if you want to understand this show, you better go to this website
boobygram.com slides you in the other's glossary, why?
Now this is a better company, but listen to this show, bubble Miser
Literally a grandmother's story, old wives tale, such as you better stop making that face
I know a girl whose face froze like that, basically a story of dubious truth like the Bible for example
Bubbala, an affection way of referring to someone much like darling or sweetheart, Bubbala
Bubbie, grandmother, like Abuela
Bubbcus, literally beans like what you guys are getting paid, colloquial nothing
You're gonna assume you know what you're gonna get, Bubbcus
Yeah, oh hi, my uncle, I can't believe it, but say this in print, this is the best, a regular guy, nobody special any time to cure
I do think too
Hi, my uncle, yeah, that's right, I think he's the new sales manager
Yeah, let's grill
Oh, hi, a nasty shrewish, somewhat psychotic woman
Woman, proud of all our prism anger, basically a bitch, are we a hi, hi, hi, hi, holla
Oh yeah, of course you can't even know how to pay, pay, pay, pay, so
Yeah, let's see
Oh, here you go, I do and I tell you this one, how luscious
There you go
Or feeding your sickness, also nausea and you see that dress you was wearing, it was positively how luscious
Or like bad food, it could taste how luscious
Wow, this is beautiful
Hazard, think fall boy, like a snore
No, not at all
Hazard, a pig or anyone who behaves like one, either in their eating financial or personal grooming him
Oh yeah, what a hazard, I don't think he's paid them a week
No wonder that hazard went out of business, he kicked all the profits and paid his employees' bookus
Wow, China
Yeah, I'm going to have to start printing more pages
You know, this is getting me in the mood for it
What's that?
Yeah, who fights it?
Oh, coming up soon
Sidirio, I'm going to have to print out the rest of this next 400 pages
Now what was that looking for?
Oh, Getskies
Yes, I can find that
Oh, he worked at those Indian dollars
That would be a Mahaya
That would be a real Mahaya
567 here on All Jew Radio
W-J-A-M
Jam on it
W-Q-A-M
Hello, not there
Sidir, Vizier here and all the other shores and they don't have time to hang on
How dare you?
567-0560, pound 567, they've arrived in Singular, where are the signs?
We got Geldia too in spite of property of demand
W-Q-A-M, hello
Nelson, Roger Solomon, please
Speaking, I'm from Solomon here
Listen, I'm going to speak from highly of it
Check it out, I use Nia dish all the time, I use smear
And I use Getskie and I use
Excellent
Manch and all that
But one thing is the Getskie, I think it's spelled
At the end, SKT
Because I think I've seen it somewhere before
So we've actually seen a Getskie?
Well, I've actually seen it spelled somewhere
And now there's a super-tru movie coming out too, I don't know the name of it
But it's coming out soon
Also
Okay, thanks for having me
I'll be with you as family, alright, now I love you
I'll be with you as well
Okay, let's see, let me look to see if I can find that website
I just had it on here
Do you know what I hate when you have to do that and start all over again?
I do
I even googled the Getskie in the other side, I couldn't find it, I probably spelled it wrong
To open another window instead
No, I'm just going to go back to this thing after the break
560, 560, 0560, you notice that there's no Christian language
Isn't that interesting?
What are you talking about?
Well, what's the Christian language?
American English, I'll have you know
Is the Christian language?
You boy, yeah
Since when?
Since we said so
How I see since Bush got stolen, we're going to convert the world
Excuse me, make them speak Christian
Coming to the QAM, hello
Neil
Yes sir
I have it on my bookshelf and it's on the call
Horacea Yiddish, just thinking that might be a good reference for you
You buy that and tell me the bookshelf
So the other thing is that shit craws me thing
It's almost as good as the rea commercial I heard from the organization last week
To come see Mario Lemieux
Oh yeah, he's a premarital well-deez then
I take nothing
He's not getting any penalties
I'm going to see Sid tonight, but I guess I'm not going to see him on the radio
I mean, that's unbelievable
Help me around, help me up there in the press box
I see him a big way for me
Thanks, pal
Yeah, Mario retired for the 40th time just in case the Panther organization who ever does those promos
Is up to the snuff, is up to whatever
So these are like in alphabetical order now, how am I going to do this?
How the hell does this thing work? I'm back on it
Well, I'm up to the R's
Oh, I can't screw us all on one page then goodness, okay?
All on one page at least online
You know what I mean? You can scroll all the way down
Now let's see, uh, gutten you, OEV, gutten you
Means like good heavens my goodness, Ghana
That's what we're going to do with the night
Got his long johns, this doesn't, I don't think this has got no getchkey
Uh oh, maybe it does, I'll find it
Geshry, give out a good Geshry a screen
Now give a kick, literally give a look, give a kick, glick
Glitch, there's no getchkey in here
Oh, bro, that's bad
He's been leading us down the path
Oh, here's one, give us an affinium
Literally give a dump in the ocean
That's right, I'm just telling Miguel about that
That's my favorite, get cocken off a neon, that's my favorite one
Don't let the joys hear it
Gelt, hey joys, get your oven up a minute
You know, get your oven up a minute, get your oven up already
You're shry, uh, now there's no getchkey on here
What was the other one you wanted with an S, OEV, Schmendrick?
Yes, okay
Now some of these words, uh, I don't want to say that anybody in my family ever made these up
But I think in all Jewish families there were people that made words up
Uh, let's see, here's Lemiel
Yeah, that's too open as Lemiel
Lemiel?
Lemiel, Charlie the guy with the rain cloud always over his head
When the Lemiel spills his soup
I thought that was a slut
When the Lemiel spills his soup, it's the Lemiel spills it on
I heard that, perfect, that's the thing
What am I looking for?
Schmendrick
There's no Schmendrick
Oh, there's Schmaltz
Right?
There's Schmata
Okay
There's Schmeckle, oh, I can't say that, sorry, joys, that means a little, uh, a little member
Oh, here's Schmendrick
Oh, here's Schmendrick
Schmendrick, a pathetic loser, hapless soul, an inept, nimp, nimp, poup, a Schlemiel
We do have a lot of, uh, words for such people
Think of Jerry Lewis doing his lady bit, and you think of Schmendrick?
It says
All right, got it
I've always told you that, Schmendrick and Schlemiel are basically the same
All love goings been changed, like they're in the, uh, SCH is a Schlob, the protected Yiddloch
Okay, listen, 1257 speaking of idiots, then being debated, uh, in the Senate this week
But it would be, but it would be, uh, here's Schmata, and he's out by the way
This is the new Rogers
This is 5'16", QA
It's Stavantutuawe
Hi, V
I'm Schlob, the digital agent, a transformation at Delhi
With my wife and her companions and prince, master, valet, they were stuck at 17 and we had 20-80
I went to Shabaranda, let the baby call, make it away
She handed me the coupons and my beating glasses, I had to remind her where her master is
If it's hanging over the candle, the Mercedes salad, hiding at a door like a mini-hats in the name
She said, well, that's an amazing shit, I be like you, I'm standing here all day, I might think I'm fine
I better get the hall as I record the relay, but say these on your cuney, do I leave my stuff in?
At the ladies of the big and shuffled ginseng, and the big bad little on the hub of a dredd
I only hope that this rate trades, 19 boys, dry face cream makes me scratch, scratch your hoist
I drug my teeth as well to show them the meaning, yeah, we'd better leave before my gun start beating
My wife's in poising on a marriage occasion, and just brought out a train of macaroni and cheese
I said I should be a virus, better pulling apart, they should only expect no one from a died-to-wearing pod
And I might end up a thicc on a fair light beer, as you can go right now, just living here
We know she's a decarbon, she's a dinner full of knowledge, for me to back down in a new picture cup of Irish
She said, my kids, you show me a new place, you snort, I said, try the kitchen and learn how to cook
Not that I should replace, I had enough milk to take home a doggy-bag of triceps
I'm going to go see him again, if he ever gets 60 votes on the poll so far, who should get the permit in two to four thought on a queue
And we write this poll is absolutely pointless, but it kills him good time, and it's better than the Katie Couricraft
I hated that poll, nobody cares about that
Suds call him in 68, he demanded 68, it's a flat footed even in the town
I got 70 to 68, managed in the lead
Oh, well I better refresh then, huh?
Oh yeah, man, it's 7 in a sud 68, that's very rare that you were ahead of me, because your computer's so slow
You're right about that
Poor he's got 45, I won't listen anyway 36, bring back Moe, 31, Curtis 31, the big O, rhymes with Moe, 23
Reverend Jones has got 12, kid Bo Camp or 11, I hit this full nine, the Crow nine, even the Crow is tied with Gellie
Who's slipping down several notches, he's got only nine
He's like the Panthers, he's dropping out a few notches
Joe Zagaki five, Ernie Sociens three, and Lenny Martensweath three, out of 365
This is our second poll, if you missed the Katie Couric poll, they said, we don't want it
5670560, let's get about 45,000 calls in between now and two o'clock
We've reverted it back to that phone baby, we're gonna lean on it and have you the rest of this year
We're leaning on it, aren't we?
And let's hope that the bees these pay the bills so they don't disconnect the phone
Nobody QAAM, hello?
Start near
Yes sir
About those blinds man, I'd rather he just turn to record this one or one of them
Okay, well we'll send you right over 56670560, pound 560 in the Verizon singular wireless line
I guess it must be a lunchtime, huh?
Special
WQAAM, hello?
Hey Neil, this is the grocery store the other day, and how much fruit can you fit in a can?
And...
So much
But turn it man
Deputy QAAM, hello?
Hey Neil, on Tuesday you said melodramatic, but does not make you a hypocrite because you always know dramatic about the radio station
What are you talking about? So what language are you speaking? I said, who is melodramatic?
You, I don't know who you're talking about being melodramatic, but you always know dramatic about the radio station
No, I'm not
Yes, you were just honest about it, I'm not the least that mellow, maybe dramatic but not mellow
No, you're lying man, you complain all the time
Yeah, well don't listen in
But, don't listen, he already started
Yeah, you can't stop, can you?
Why not?
Can't stop
Who said anything about stop?
No, I did, go away
56670560 by the way you're going to be deported once we pass that bill, illegal man, alien, I can tell
I don't know where you're from, I think hunger, but you're going to get deported, hypocrite
5667 melodramatic, maybe we were talking about Lou Dobbs over the top I said, who now what's that talking about?
I just, you know what I was talking about, hypocrite, WMQA, I'm hello
Neil, the other day you said something so true that people, either way you go, the other guy said I was so crap
Well, okay, great, and they love it
What was it?
It's so true about everything
Who loves what?
The people that are getting raped by the government, the gas, the gas oil companies
We all are Americans, we all are Americans, we all are Americans
Tell me how to bend over and when I should do it again
That's all right, and if you put an idea for the police how high those gas gets before people really come out to the streets and complain
I would say
But third man, I get more realistic number
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, don't be a schminderick
No, no
56670560, even the glamour speaking the edition Florida
Now one thing about New York, and you've been in New York City both of you
You've been to Josh Wright, many of you have
Even the glamour in New York speak a lot of you
And that's because there's 3 million Jews there
So if it's like anything else, it's like you notice all the anglos and stuff
Or to speak a lot of Spanish expressions, certain ones
Not certain expressions
And then that was saying that search answer
Like what?
Give me one
Oh, nothing we could say in the air
Oh
But I'm a seriously New York, it's very seldom you can find a Gentile who doesn't understand a lot of you
They've been this because they're surrounded by it
Wouldn't you think that worked?
I'd have heard it
You're crazy man, you're out of your mind
I was going to get in rabbit room on the news that time and it was a fags invaded the studio at CBS and he said the Cosa hoist
Oh yeah
They did right there on the desk, it was pretty embarrassing
You know what Dan used to say, half a loaf is better than
Somebody go away and hello
What do you think about the passing of Jackie McQueen?
Jackie McQueen?
Yeah, the great Jackie McQueen
Who they miss?
They miss the octopus, played with Miles Davis, Charlie Clark
Never heard of Jackie McQueen
Well, you should pay attention to talking about those happy crunners you're selling to
Yeah, such as
Were you talking about Whitney and then the same week from McQueen?
Gene Pitney and Jim Sandhoo, Snapping McQueen?
Who's that?
I hear you, I don't know Snapping McQueen
He's comparing Gene Pitney to this man
You better get your musical taste and order
Okay, there's a Schmendrick for you
There's a Shlamy, Loonish, Lamaazal
He was born under a dark cloud under a bad sign
The troupe of Cobbett is going to come and just nail your ass right to the wall
How do you like that?
Just like a human mazzusa
We're going to nail you to my neighbor's doorframe
Lunatic
Five-six and see I ain't sure how to call his man
It's so much better than all this other stuff
The other stuff is like work
You know?
No, I know, that's why
Can I be spotted there?
I don't want to
I don't want to do that
Just want to sit and take a bunch of idiotic calls
But if the Yankees can win the penitent, do you think the blue jays are going to be a feel of good news
That great new, a referver stadium, but there you have right
The Roger Center
Come to town they name the stadium after me
Damn, God
How you like that?
Lighty white at the
W-Modicone
W-Q-A-M, hello
Are there needle?
Yes sir
Yeah, I got a question for you
What, what are you doing?
Get out with a nonsense, okay?
In your case, just look in the mirror
Okay, that's an answer to the question in your case
What an idiot
Five-six, seven, oh five, sixty
Count five, sixty
In fact, there are a lot of people out there who would say you're the post-to-child
W-Q-A-M, hello
Yes sir
I always see Anglos using the phrase
Lighty-Cone
Yeah, it's out of Florida
No, that's because they listen to the show
Oh, okay
And they hear punks like you are using it
Yeah
Or maybe they're just
Maybe that's it
Five-six, seven, oh five, sixty, see what I mean by one track mind, that's it
That's your people
That's all they know from
It's my bone, bull, and that's pretty much an alienito
Alienito, come and come and eat that, come and eat that
There's the top four right there I think
I think I just touched all the bases
From first base all the way to home plate
Just circle the bases and touch the home
All you ask for is to touch it at home
How many hosts we got?
And then we have 400 yet?
393, we're closing it on 400 on the new pool
Boy, we have to do this a lot more
Because when we move the first pool on it gets really stale
And I don't know why that, but this is Eric
You know, a little less time to eat
Although he got, he whipped this baby on there in a heartbeat
Boy, he got to it real fast
See, one thing about Eric, as you well know
If you like, rip him just a little bit
All of a sudden he hops too
Remember hops, sir?
Yes, I do
Well, Eric, he eats a lot in the hops too
Does he say?
I don't know yet
Maybe like, yeah, who fights?
I fight you
Gotta be careful with that one

It really?
processing
Okay, I'll ask him when the joke comes back from the West Coast
They donít play no tapes
Those tapes were so bad. I especially like the one about Alien and the Pope that was my favorite. They still play that.
And of course that check better show up on Monday on the 10th.
And his clearance assures me that it will because if not and you're going to be on vacation, it's going to either be Alien and the Pope or Josh doing a show solo.
You've heard of Napoleon's solo. It's going to be Josh solo.
It'll be Josh. You're going to do a show, aren't you?
Four hours. Oh, four hours. It's a long time.
It'll be a lot of music in four hours. Say yeah.
Good on you. Oh, sure.
What? No, I'm talking about all phone calls.
Oh, yeah. You got a lot of calls. You got a lot of friends out there and ready to land. I think we have one call before.
You seen that picture and he's ready to rock and roll. Oh, yeah.
He'll be calling a lot.
406 votes on the pool. Who should get the permanent two to four spot on the quim?
Magog 75, Sud 74. We got a real battle going on there.
What's the point? Did we look up Gornish, Telfin?
George Rodriguez 54. I won't listen anyway. 42. Bring back Moe with 37.
Rams with no chance. Curtis 33. The big old 26.
Reverend Jones 12. Bring him on here so we can kill him and his boyfriend.
Kim Bocamp or 12. Gelly's got 11. He's really moving up now.
He was stuck on Yine for the longest time.
You know what? Now Gelly has moved barely ahead of the crew.
Gelly would live in the crew with 10.
Kennis Masamacho.
I hate this pool nine.
Joseph Gaki five. Ernie Soach and three and Lini Martez.
Sultimentate trace. See there you go. What I eat is she again?
There's that Scott McCullough, but a beep but a move touches on.
Now, touch this. 12 minutes after one.
Oh my God. Gelly from the Bank Atlantic Yanta Center.
We're to a clock. Well, we're sure we're working on pregame.
I don't understand it. And then Mad Dogs at the Masters.
Now, I've got it for and Curtis is at the Yanta Center along with it.
I guess they're going to be confagulating back and forth side by each, right?
Right.
Now, soon because we got the baseball game on QAIM and a hockey game on 1360.
And we're like, who's on first? And any Kien Vegas playing his brains out.
Follows all of those.
Speaking of things, if you have termites in your home or maybe you think you have them,
you better call ridded pest control the day before your house is gone.
They'll give you a free termite inspection.
Ritted pest control uses an amazing, exclusive orange oil treatment that kills termites
and termites eggs 100% on contact.
They're gone faster than you can say.
Todd Drexas Schmendrick.

The reasons why 24 rules and the soprano sucks first.
Jack Bauer incriminates and interrogates witnesses.
This is the last question you've got to talk to me about grandad.
While Tony soprano eats Chinese food with his wife.
I don't know about you, but ever since we found this place I catch myself panting with my fingers.
Me too. Sometimes you're set.
Jack Bauer abducts witnesses and threatens to kill them.
Make a sound and I will throw your brains out all over the windshield.
Wow, Vito talks about his workout routine.
Five minutes and no incline.
Then I switch to full uphill for my cardio.
Jack Bauer worries about the most important vehicle in the United States.
What's the airport for Japan?
What's the airport for Japan?
While the sopranos shills the Porsche Cayenne.
Is this the new Porsche?
Cayenne Turbo. I got the 4.5-0.8.
Look at your about the color-soy ticket shot.
How many I love it? It's gorgeous.
What a car!
Jack Bauer gets pissed.
Damn it!
While Tony soprano goes to his shrink.
You try to smother your mother with a pillow.
I'd grab the pillow, but just to keep my hands occupied.
And these are just a few of the reasons why 24 rules and the sopranos sucks at least lately.
Well, look at this. Here's a thing on his booby-gram.
I just discovered I was poxicking around with it.
Oh, there's another one.
Click here to open the entire dictionary sorted by English.
So that's what I wanted to do.
Now listen to me.
Go to this side and you click it.
Oh, there's the Torah.
Cayenne Hora.
Sorted by Yiddish.
Okay. So here's the whole...
Oh my god, this is incredible.
So what was I looking for?
Getski.
Brother.
Oh, I see.
Oh, that's it. It's too complicated.
But I'll find it. Trust me. I'll find it.
And then when we find it, what do I get to do with it?
I think the Getski's all need to be sent in outer space.
In the Uranus.
118 and 560.
WDQ, by the way, there's Scott McCullen trying to lie his way through this thing about the new leaker-in-chief.
But it moved, but it moved, but it popped while they were on-classified.
Yeah, well, he's the one I made him on-classified.
He declassified so we could smear and smear.
See, the hell with national security, let's just smear and smear.
Anybody who out dares, who has the audacity,
and Stern would say, how dare you to question their veracity.
Somebody QYM, hello?
Daniel, how's it going?
All right.
I got a radio question for you.
I think it'd be the best to pull the rod when the original show blows.
Good point.
Okay, why they on vacation?
He's always sick that line, even that line, you know,
lately as a duplicator.
No, okay.
5667-0560, 0.560 in the Verizon and Singular wireless line.
Anybody care about pulling an old rod?
No, not really.
WDQ, by M, hello?
I'll go near a hello.
Yes, sir.
How are you, sir?
Excellent.
I'm glad.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
Hey, sir.
Hello.
Wilson, George, you'll definitely appreciate this one.
Neil, you have to hear this, no wife.
Just put a recon in your voice.
My favorite, the English word is Gakas.
And with that being said, with the pro-politics,
our government and Joker, a president for a call on that,
and seems like the Joker management and your operation over there,
those who show you ails coming all shapes, sizes, and colors.
And they're all for me.
That was great.
It was doing very poorly until you got right to the end of the word.
Is that word he threw out there?
I have no idea.
Knockers?
No, and I know knockers.
Knockers?
Yeah, knockers, I think.
Which is like Polish knock-wurst.
I don't like knock-wurst.
I don't like bakwurst or knock-wurst.
Brawurst, I love.
Knock-wurst, I can live without.
You better learn your German sausage.
What about liverwurst?
What about liverwurst?
Ooh, you don't eat that to you.
I hope.
Well, think I do.
It's like eating chicken livers.
Oh, man.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
But I think about the macaroni and cheese and cheese on Friday, that somebody asked about
was yesterday or Wednesday.
Right.
And we were talking about that.
Right.
And of course I looked it up and then we all said the same thing.
They just changed it as they go along and they make it up as they go along.
And the same thing with this now.
All these years, man, with our Judas is scary.
He was the turncoat.
He was the backstabber.
He was kind of like the Mohawar David of ancient times.
Now coming to fight on.
He was a good guy.
He was just kind of letting the heaven hand, you know, for Jesus.
I mean, Jesus could have gone and turned himself in and said, Here, nail me up there.
So we can get this thing over.
We're going to get me out of this awful body and he's damned sandals.
But no, he didn't do that.
He had to have somebody, he had to have an enabler.
Somebody who could be a hated.
And he had a quarter of this deal.
And I told him that for generations to come, he'll be despised and reviled until they find this particular tablet.
I told him what a good deal.
And Meg green found that tablet.
And every time she says, Oh, we kept falling out just like that change.
Meg green on money.
Do we still have that?
I think I have it on a cart over here.
Get out of here.
All right.
Do you really?
Well, I don't want you to play it.
It's disgusting.
Meg keeps standing up and every time she falls, she stands up.
All the change keeps falling out.
Although we do have, tell you one thing we have about Meg.
Don't don't even waste your time looking for it.
Too late.
Huh?
Hello.
Randy, I don't hate you at all.
Congratulations.
Get out of here, Meg.
You want to know something truthfully, I'm happy for you.
Why are you happy for me?
Because I am going to my boat.
We're going out for a cruise.
I'm having for the four and a half years.
My first weekend's off.
I'm promoting my video.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I figured it was some kind of promotion thing.
No, no, no, not at all.
I'm just saying that I welcome you to the station.
Honestly, God, I do.
Really?
Trust me.
I'm not lying.
I call to congratulate you.
Well, Meg, I just, can I just ask you one-lousy question there?
Why on your last show?
Did you say I didn't have a chance in hell of doing anything over here at WIID?
I made a mistake.
I made a bad call.
So you have something to do.
And I think you're fun.
And I think it's perfectly okay to have, relax and have fun on a weekend.
Honestly, God, I need it too.
Yeah.
And I'm enjoying listening to you.
And it's no full.
Now, have a good day.
Have a good day.
See you.
Don't believe the word of it, man.
Stay here and trash me for an all afternoon.
A whole afternoon.
Stay here and say I didn't have a chance in hell.
I had no talent.
What the hell was I doing here?
Boy, Gary made a big mistake.
Now she wants to promote something at our tailgate party.
So she's going to kiss a little butt.
Back to him.
There you go.
I never done it my life.
That's all I got for you.
That's all we got.
That's enough.
That's enough, Meg Green.
Nobody knows from this Meg Green at this point.
I drove by your office yesterday.
In fact, huh?
I drove by your office yesterday.
Her orifice?
Yes, I did.
Where is her orifice?
She's got a big one right over here.
I was very.
Yeah, I heard she's got a big one.
Oh, she was.
I'll tell you who was very popular in those days.
And I would do is the plant guy on Sunday morning.
He was actually.
I'm not joking about that either.
I mean, you know that the audience probably thought
that's something since the joke.
You could even open wide.
What was his name?
Chris Rollins.
Chris Rollins, man, the plant guy,
it affords you to ring off the hook.
That was the other day.
Brother to Henry Rollins.
Those phones were some moken.
And so are more of his colors, I think.
You know that's the kind of,
that's the kind of gardening they were talking about.
That's right.
70 QAM.
QAM, hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Just wanted to get George a chronic home.
How good?
70 QAM, hello.
Neil, how's it going?
I'm a former Catholic.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
I want to go see my money last night so I can front her
with an affinuous thing.
I was like, why did you make me eat that crap every Friday and Wednesday?
You're really going to tell her the answer, but you know what she said?
It was good for the fishing industry.
Yeah, that's true.
That's a good point.
I mean, that's it.
I mean, she really couldn't say anything.
That's what I sewer asked because you probably got like mercury in your system now from eating
all that fish toys a week.
So I sewer asked her for parental malpractice.
And when he had something else too, I was trying to contact my old buddies being an internet.
I grew up in New York and I ran into one guy and I said, hey, how you been?
He was like, I don't want to talk to you.
He brings up bad memories.
I'm like, what are you talking about?
Can we get home?
We played ball.
And then I put it together.
He was an altar boy.
Uh-huh.
And that's what's bad to me.
He didn't want to say it.
But the Eminence Reeve brothers boy, I'll tell you.
They were in the rectory.
I'm a Catholic.
I'm not a Catholic.
Bye.
Bye.
Well, maybe he was ugly.
I never know.
26th after one.
I guess that's the barometer.
Okay.
Either that's the father had very bad eyes.
I said, maybe if you were ugly when you were an altar boy, they didn't touch your goods.
Or your bads.
Or maybe they were just busy.
Maybe they had so many others lined up.
You just were small potatoes, so to speak.
26th after one.
Of course, we know there's isolated incidents because anybody with a half of brain knows for sure.
There's no sight in the church.
Right.
Being outdoors and soft-floated means you really need some comfortable shoes because you do a lot of walking and waltz and around.
Do you do any waltz and around?
Oh yeah.
Just a slip.
So the only place to go is Brandy shoes and pomelo beads to take the best carry your feet.
Brandy's carry his major brands like Floresheim, Echoma Fisto, Rockport, Hush Puffies, New Balance.
Those are my favorites.
I love New Balance shoes.
And tons of other name brands and all sizes for men and women.
They even carry wide wits and hard to find sizes.
Brandy shoes is the largest independent shoe retailer in all of South Florida.
And when you go in there and you see the selection in Brandy, you'll understand why I've been telling you Brandy's is the best for years and years for a veritable lifetime.
Go see our good buddy Arnie.
He'll make sure you get the right to getting shoes for your feet at Brandy's.
Not like those department stores where you wait for a lifetime to get weighted on.
And then finally, whichever style you pick out, whichever one suits your fancy, forget about it.
They don't have it in your size.
You know they're going to have it for you at Brandy's because the only thing they do do at Brandy's is shoes.
So you never have to worry about size, selection, and service.
You want it? They got it.
Brandy shoes are 1290 North Federal Highway and pomelo beads between Atlantic and Coppots on each side.
You can't miss it.
Brandy's open every day of the week, open Mondays, who Saturday till 9 and Sundays until 5 in the PM.
And this week is a great time to buy SAS shoes at Brandy's.
Save 20 to 40 bucks to appear on all great men's and women's styles.
So be sure to get your ass into Brandy's this week or you can do your shoe shopping.
Sit in there on your fat pimpley ass. Just go online at brandy's shoes.com.
This is a new Roger. What's solid? This is 516 QA.
For the flagship stage, big guy.
You hate your butt and thighs.
Yeah. And that dimension is skinny arms.
So why should Lindsay Lohan and Nicole Richie have all the fun?
What do you mean all the fun?
Well over the years straight women have been glorified for being anorexicly skinny.
Thanks to Dennis Quay, we now have something called Manorexia.
And that's right guys. Now we could be skinny. I'm talking Somalia's skinny.
So how do I become Manorexia?
All you have to do is do a bunch of pumpkin starters.
But what about this hot belly I'm getting from the starvation?
My full-faction bitch. It's cool to be skinny.
No, you can hit this eight-baller what?
Cool. I can see my whole spine.
Dennis, right here.
Making even the straightest guy looks like a gay 12-year-old boy.
135, 60, 70, QAM. We have 451 votes.
We'll get to that 500 by the top of the RR.
Josh is the whole show alone next week.
Are we back here just like a little chocolate or something? What's wrong with that?
More like a go-ah. I was laughing at that bit.
I knew it couldn't be what I just said because I'm sure that with that big raise
that Joe was working up for you over there. I can't even say it.
452, you see that? They're pouring in by the ones.
They want to come to your side.
By the way, before we get out of here today, I want to thank the guy that arranged
for the delivery of the communion wafers that I've been harping about so long.
Yeah.
Realized Eucharist will be doing communion.
All right.
Coming soon to a good building.
And for Neil soon.
Good.
Show.
Whatever you just said.
5670560.
I'm going to see you in the town five 60th of their trief on the Verizon Singular wireless lines.
W.A.N. Hello.
Made from Jesus.
So Neil.
Yes, sir.
What's going on?
How you doing?
I'm all right.
Yeah.
We're starting to deal with your dad.
How you start that thing's about to.
You got a penniless?
How about your pardon?
Well, what happened with your dad?
He's dead.
How?
penniless?
You got broke, right?
You're asking me how to hold a vinyl?
You were writing a book?
No, but he was kind of funny that way.
You said it last week.
I'm asking you.
Can you, is speaking of penniless, can you afford like a real phone or you're like at a
sock over it?
Do you have a sock on it now?
No, I got a phone.
About on the phone.
Early search and sock.
Yeah.
Oh, he found the sock that Ernie lost no doubt.
What's so will you dead?
And they mind your own business, okay?
It's a radio show.
What about your dad?
What about your mama?
Okay, that's what I was going to do.
Okay, your mama.
567, speaking of sewing socks and hell.
And pound 56705, Verizon Singular wireless.
See the little Julio's man is sitting around the Christmas tree, around the mulberry
bush, and they're trying to come up with some new ideas.
Of course, basically it's a same old stale crap again.
You know what, let's face it, you guys are out of material.
Since that last great letter that we put up there on the wall on the bulletin board,
which I'm not sure which one it was.
Which one of the first, the first one was the PD Lenny one about the fat-filled sandwiches,
then there was another good one too.
And then the best part of that is that Scrooan got all whipped out and they should probably
know that.
They look at them all in the mood for each other.
Oh yeah, she was conducting an inquisition.
Of course, the QM over there has even a lot of inquisitions.
Even Turkey, my 100% up, my quick goes on there.
Every time somebody would like fart the wrong flavor, every time somebody would get like
a letter in the mail, there's an inquisition.
We want to know who the mul is.
And you know the interesting part of it, Greg reading George W. Bush.
See the similarities now?
The leaker.
Yeah, the leaker.
He always won't run around who's the mul.
Well guess what, just like Bush want to know about the leaks.
Well he's the leaker and Greg was the mul.
Mulie, mulie, mulie.
Yeah, exactly.
Mulie, mulie, mulie.
WQYM, hello.
Yes, I think we should give Bob Sheeper the true to four slot.
Yeah, I didn't know that much these days.
Well, my dog and maybe with 10 crore for a month.
There you go.
Okay, we have two old guys talking again.
We've got two old guys at 10.
We have two ancient guys at two.
Me and the old Bobby.
Hey Bobby, how's things?
Okie-dokie?
You know, this business about their numbers went up when he went on.
I'm sorry.
Maybe they're, you know, 89 plus number, you know, like from 89 years of age to death.
There's no way that anybody under 100 is going to watch Bob Sheeper doing that news.
I mean, he's just a fossil.
WQYM, hello.
Neo.
Yes, sir.
Friday.
First of all, nobody's in the feet too mad from two to four.
That's kind of the best idea.
That's the best idea, right?
And on the back of the way first, when it says the gradient, does it just say G-sys bottle?
Yes.
Body of Christ.
Body of Christ, it says under B.O.C.
Body of Christ.
Deadly sliced body of Christ.
Oh, I like that.
Quit making on our boy.
5670560.
There's that film.
I mean, I heard he's got his own TV show now.
On NBC.
That guy, that guy yesterday, man.
You people just kill me.
It's just hysterical.
They all got an angle.
If I call up and say, real fast, like, who would care?
Who would care?
You know, I gave the whole story about it the day before.
I was going to say, so TV show, I said, like, real fast, you know?
That's why I read the story about how bad it was the day before.
Very slowly and deliberately.
In fact, if you're real talk real, I saw, I read it again.
I still have it.
Well, good.
We'll read it on Monday again.
I hear him keeping it handy.
Tell me, do you know how you doing?
I don't know who I would put.
If you could resurrect anyone, I'll put Tiny up there, because I'd love to hear Tiny do a show.
You know, probably be where we got now.
Same thing.
Talked in the same register as Gildi.
Same as Squeak.
That's another thing.
You know, all these people are so concerned with Tiny, you know?
I understand.
I can relate to that.
W-E-Q-A-M, hello.
I know.
I had to go to work at two-a-M.
Okay, go ahead.
I see that.
Touch it, Agonda.
Real quick.
My bad.
You know, you're bad.
It was really important.
I'm bad.
How about the pot?
Third was smoking it.
W-E-Q-A-M, hello.
Q-A-M, hello.
Narcline.
W-E-Q-A-M, hello.
Can we do three in a row here?
I think we got a shot.
Q-A-M.
Yeah, Neil Rogers.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, boys.
You're welcome.
Your mama.
So, Saks and Hill.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60.
See, now the audience doesn't know what to do, see?
Because we were like, taking care of...
No, no, no, no, no.
You don't understand.
I'm not talking about that.
Not that they ever had any material.
But I'm just saying, now they don't want to scream or peel like banana.
Remember that guy with the eyes was talking about the banana that he was listening for?
Well, here's the deal.
They don't know what to do.
Because now we're taking a million calls on the show.
Whereas we'd watered it down to just a few here, a couple over there.
And now they're under pressure.
Like Maria Bartoromo would say, they're coming under pressure.
You know how she says that?
Yeah.
Man, she's got bags under those eyes.
Or even people that take like their whole other possessions on the plane.
Never carry bags that size.
Just unreal.
Q-A-M, hello.
Are we on the radio?
Q-A-M, hello.
Neil, this one guy I think you were left off.
Yes?
What did I ever do to you guys?
Now.
What did I ever do?
No.
What did I ever do?
Foring.
What did I ever do?
Comotose.
What did I ever do?
Suicide inducing.
At least you didn't call line I'm this time.
That's the first though.
Q-A-M, hello.
Oh, god.
You sound so stupid.
I hate to talk to you.
Oh, and you know we can't even play that anymore either.
Is it's got, huh?
Uh-huh.
It's got the VB in there.
If you missed the Neil Rogers show yesterday on 610WIOD, you missed this.
Is this the bird?
Yeah.
Bird, how you doing?
You'll see, but that wasn't even the right guy.
That's just a bird inquisitor, a bird-agitator, Jr.
Another wannabe.
You'll never make it, pal.
WQ-A-M, hello.
Is this Neil Beowelper?
Speaking.
How are you?
Can I hear a little Dwayne Stump?
Dwayne, yeah.
I think he already got it.
He wants a Dwayne Stump.
567-0560, 05-60, and the Verizon Singular wireless line.
Guess what?
He can read.
Not exciting?
WQ-A-M, hello.
He puts Matt Sundin in the basket.
Yeah, well, that's a good place for him, okay?
Because he sure can't put the biscuit in the basket.
Nice going on on a shootout, Pat.
Just put the three same guys under.
They can't do it.
Every game.
Over and over again.
They may not be good, at least they're consistent.
The old Mighty Quinn, I think he won't see him no more.
WQ-A-M, hello.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Is this WID?
W-I-W-I-D hockey talk, yes.
Oh, okay.
Who you calling?
Yeah.
Why are you asking this is WID?
When's the last time we were on WID?
About 100 years ago?
Nine.
Really?
You're not counting the seven months I got paid off.
Yeah, we're going to do it for you, sir.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
WQ-A-M.
Is everything going to go to motion?
Motion, motion, motion.
Fight of motion.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, and I think he just answered his own question.
Too many goi-a, man.
WQ-A-M, hello.
Yeah, Matt's talking the up to you.
I'm just looking at the motion, and Rick and Sudden.
It's a no-brainer.
You'll be great.
Oh, everybody wants that.
What's the problem?
Yeah.
Let's take a look at how that pull is shaping up, baby.
Shape up or shape out.
When it does, shape it out.
See, I told you, it put a good smile on your face with these
embassies.
I mean, with these great calls, 473 votes.
Who should get the permanent two-to-fourth slot of Q-A-M?
Suds Coulman 85, a mad dog 85.
They came make up their mind.
Suds Coulman ain't going to be on the beat.
You know, he boxed himself into a corner.
Because every time Rick would be in a sicker or something like that,
you don't have to go to church to pray extra to be forgiven.
Suds would go home.
They'd slap a tape on him.
He would go home under the guise that he can't do a show by himself.
Remember that?
Right.
So where is the logic that he's going to carry a two-hour show by himself?
Because he doesn't think he can do it.
And maybe he's right, I don't know.
I mean, he's fine going in there and even lunch with you on Fridays.
Now, when he comes in, do you have to guys have macaroni and cheese?
We have it.
Nice again for that music, by the way, Suds.
Thanks for the change in my life, standing in the shadows of Motom.
That's the goal.
You'll be getting a book in the next diplomatic pouch that he gave me
to give the book and to give it to you.
A book of what?
That book?
A Robert Ingersoll book, you know, the famous atheist from the 1800s?
Yes.
Good stuff.
Famous stuff.
Oh, there's nothing we know, Ayn Rand.
Oh, I hate her.
I'm Rand.
Suddoran Electro-Bitt.
I'm Farcarcher Claimicite.
Suds Coulman 85, a mad dog 85.
Moishi.
Who drew a Moishi Rodriguez got 68.
I won't listen anyway, 57.
No matter what you put on, we won't listen.
Yeah.
Curtis 38, bring back Moe 37.
The big O 28.
Reverend Jones 18, Kim O'Campre 14.
The Crow 13.
Gieldi, Sultimaente Dosey.
They can always take him in small doses.
I hate this pool 9.
Joe Zagaki 5.
Ernie Sochens got three pair and Lany Martez Sultimaente Trace.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 516-2-A.
The Yubeskies.
It's 30 a day plus gas.
Well, I ran in Lincoln.
Gashartcran and I drove up in the hill.
You want me in shirts and recall how it happened.
Well, it still gives me change.
What a weirdo.
Followed my map of star house sales.
And one shot to see.
Sitting on her front porch was Angelina Jolie.
Yeah, no, no, no.
I walked up like I knew her.
Hey, do I know you?
When I saw her hesitate.
Yeah.
But the core of porn started working and for her.
It was too late.
But her in my car and rolled the windows down.
Now she washed my queen and I made her crown.
But this is a crown of me.
And I've got Angelina Jolie in my basement.
And I think I'll keep her there with me.
Hello.
And charge her ring.
I can't ring.
Well, I hope she don't mind.
I hope that you'll find that she likes the cement.
I'll spend the time in the front.
How wonderful life is with Angelina Jolie in my basement.
Wait for me.
I want to get...
Watch your dramatic, pull her in my neck.
But I bet you'd give your last set.
Hello, babe.
To heaven, Angelina Jolie locked down in your basement.
I'll tell her my dog.
I'll tell her.
Don't her precious.
I'll hurt your dog, mister.
I'm gonna punch the dog in the basket.
146.4102.
So it's amazing what's on this website.
Bangitout.com, the Jewish caption contest.
And the reason I couldn't find Getski is because,
again, it has to do with the pronunciation with dialect,
and Getski, Shmata and Shmati, that kind of thing.
Yalika, Yalika.
If you look up Getska, that's right. Getska, you'll find it.
I.
Getska.
Getska and Kishki.
Well, play the Getska on us.
So anyway, well, that doesn't really have a definition,
but it's got a pitch.
It's got a contest for a caption for this picture,
and it shows that Orthodox Jew with the past and the hand
and the holding you facing a snowman.
Snowman's got a carrot in its mouth,
and it's got one of those hats that the Hussein wear on the
top of the snowman's head.
Would like the fur hockey puck.
And here are some of the contest entries,
one from Robert Besser in Boka.
But now here's one from Shmi Unger in Borough Park.
Yankele is convinced there's something obvious attractive
about this particular Getska.
There you go.
Oh, this stuff is incredible.
Here's something about a bris...
Boy, my God.
Oh, Shalomist, there's snowmensch.
Wanna trade hats?
Oh, you've raised me.
Holy cow.
So anyway, there you go.
It's just open up a whole new avenue.
And where did that all come from?
That came from the guy I don't know where he could
define the definition of Getska.
Just Google it, baby.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Oh, tornado on the ground.
30 miles west of Nashville, Tennessee.
It's not a way to Nashville,
because God's really peered at all in Miyahu's,
all in crackers,
for all in foreign,
in the illegal, uh, appropriate,
and whatever they're doing there.
And for closing all the delis up there,
to an Nashville. God's peered about that.
WDQA, Ann, hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you?
Excellent.
In a happy face, all by the way.
Coming back to you, back to you.
Uh, I have a shimmy request,
including with the theme today, if that's okay.
Yes?
Uh, that'll, my name is Hi.
Oh, my name is Hi.
My name is Hi.
Oh, I got it.
And in closing, then I get some
copy on the shmackle.
That's three legs.
See you.
See I was already pointed at.
Now he got me knackered down.
That's all over it, huh?
Why are you, because he stepped on it.
I drive a mercury.
That's three lanes wide.
Oi!
I can't see over the hill.
Because I'm three-foot-five.
Uh, uh, uh.
Have a drink of oxygen.
To keep me alive.
Oi!
My name is Hi.
My name is Hi.
My name is Hi.
Gotta go find for some sweet juice.
So I bought five.
When the passion told me it was only for the larger size.
I bought the thing and discussed.
After farting in line.
Yeah!
Because my name is Hi.
My name is Hi.
My name is Hi.
Make sure to always be boy for dinner at five.
The soup was cold to dark the browns
all they had was lime.
Yeah!
Love and they had the meat that check.
I left them a dime.
Because my name is Hi.
My name is Hi.
My condo sets the rules that I live by.
No younger than 92.
But still alive.
No goal reason, the fool.
But type as a fine.
My name is Hi.
My name is Hi.
My name is Hi.
Hi, Italian!
150-10-2, Bano.
Man, this thing is flown by today.
You know what I mean?
Now when you go into a good deli, you have to get a Dr. Browns.
Dr. Browns black cherry soda with your own sandwich.
What?
The light black cherry.
Oh, come on.
That's what you had.
They also make it in diet.
You can have it in a diet.
Not all types of Dr. Pepper, all that black cherry.
Get out of here.
Dr. Browns, do you remember Dr. Browns?
Dr. Browns root beer, cream soda.
Oh, like I said, they're making it into a flavor.
It is.
I'm just using it as an example.
Or this is my favorite right.
That Dr. Browns.
Well, you have the all the root beer.
All right.
And I'll have the black cherry.
We got our 500 vote.
We got 504.
We got 504 vote on our second poll of the day.
We had over 1100 in the first one about Katie Court.
And the general reaction was, fat.
Even the guy I know who that means fat.
That's what we got that in the Netherlands.
I got familiar with that.
Fah soap.
F A.
I don't know where that's not made in the Netherlands.
I don't even make soap there because they don't use it.
Fah.
For your fa.
But for the Arabs, it's fat.
I don't think the air, well, I shouldn't say that.
I was going to make some comment about the Saudis using soap.
That would be bad.
But even if they did, it would have made any difference.
That's me.
It's like the Haseen.
It would have made any difference.
Don't drop the body wash, whatever you do.
Now, you notice slowly, but surely they're coming around.
I'm looking at the last break in this hour in the show today.
And I'm thinking to myself, oh speaking of Yiddish words and all of a sudden crap we've been talking about.
I just, I don't get it.
Hey, Chris, I know you're talking good game there with that top Carolina North Carolina draw, whatever it is.
But you guys back there, man.
You need to get with you, put Brown, baby.
You got to get your, get your house and odor.
It's not just the last, look at the whole last page.
I mean, oh, I know you don't have to tell me that.
I know that.
There wasn't been one, well, yeah, there was one.
Of course, I was a trade-out, the third break in the, every other break in this hour was like two minutes or less.
And that's because I filled it.
It's, it's really, you know, the fill in.
Pretty embarrassing.
This is Joe Bell and his new way, G-Man.
He's all excited.
He's bringing a heavyweight in and he's got a couple of real heavyweights coming in.
And by the way, if there's any people who audition for a job in sales at QM today, forget about it.
That's my best suggestion to you, okay?
Forget about it.
I mean, it's like buying a ticket on the Titanic.
Look, God about it.
Right now, what anybody would have brained do that.
This is me, Rod.
Look before, goodness, baby.
This is 516 QAS.
George, we're radio is one of the Q's world.
QAS.
Thank you, Boomer.
Oh!
Don't it. I told you.
Don't bother me while I'm in here.
I, sir.
Hello?
It's Mickey Mouse.
Oh, Mr. Mouse. Good morning.
How are you?
What the hell are you doing to me?
Nothing, sir.
You're freaking killing me.
No, not.
I know, David Kelly called me every three minutes.
Why did we move the process?
Sir, you told me to move the process.
I didn't tell you.
You must have misunderstood me.
No, sir. You said move the practice to Monday.
Hey, hey, listen, butt wipe.
I'm the boss.
I make the decisions.
You take the heat.
Right.
You'll move the practice.
How are we doing with it anyway?
I am mad.
Hold on.
What do I mean?
Remaz.
Yeah, boss.
Shut the hell up.
I'm on the phone, Remaz.
Hi, sir.
Yes, sir. What was your question?
I'm killing you.
I'm going crazy over here between David Kelly and now Michael Jackson called me every three minutes.
I'm going to go out of my freaking mind.
Hold on.
Remaz.
Get in, you boss.
Stop it, Remaz.
I'm sorry, boss.
Stop the phone, Remaz.
Remaz.
It's one thing in my hand, Remaz.
That's your penis, boss.
My other hand, Remaz.
That's the phone, boss.
Right, I can't hear anything, Remaz.
Stop sawing the floor.
Sorry.
Hi, sir.
Sir, the moves are working out very well.
The practice is fourth and it's time for me to...
What the fuck?
It's time for me to even beat him to WB?
Barely.
Oh my god.
Michael Jackson was a rating success.
Of course.
Hold on a second.
Remaz.
It's the book.
What the hell are you doing with a harmonica, Remaz?
Don't play, Remaz.
I'll jam that thing down your throat.
And give that blue bird away from me.
Oh, come on, Remaz.
I'm allergic.
I, sir.
Sir, over 25 million people saw...
Shut up,izer.
Listen.
Yeah.
You see me what I'm doing here?
Sir, you're on the phone.
I know I'm on the phone.
Do you see what I'm doing?
You're the human imagination for crying out loud.
I'm moving my hands up and down.
Slide to side.
I'm the puppet master.
I say it.
You do it.
Now Fox is going to air all the stuff that you cut out of the Michael Jackson interview.
But, sir, you told me to edit out all that stuff to make him work.
That's it, that's it, that's it.
Puppet master.
Me.
He...
Oh.
Remaz.
Remaz.
Yes, he able.
What the hell are you doing now?
Listen to the flow, folks.
It's nothing wrong with the floor, Remaz.
What's this in my ear?
That's your...
Oh, Pete is both my other ear, Remaz.
Oh, that's the phone, boss.
That's the phone, Remaz.
Get out.
Get over to work.
Get off.
I, sir.
Yes, sir.
Killin' me.
Killin' me.
I'm sorry, sir.
Killin' me.
Sorry.
Killin' me softly.
Hey, listen, I was like a special bonus today because it's been such a great show, don't you think?
It hasn't.
It hasn't been fan...
Fan tabulous.
Especially the guy with the...
Getski.
Okay, let's see.
Here's the final totals.
Here's our totals from what that was her name, that little mix of the used to work at Iondi.
Halcyon.
Halcyon, how could you do that?
Halcyon, Frigga.
Those were the Halcyon.
Those were the salad days, baby.
That's when Marshaler used to bring the shallots with all the marshmallows and the fruit.
Yes, the Enbrote Day.
And the baby.
525 volts.
We're trying to figure this thing out here, man.
We can't figure it out.
Even Josh Cortis, who were nearly just a mild-mannered mind-to-zone binist, even he was shocked and dismayed by the...
Not by the hour itself, not by the programming, but by the spot load.
I couldn't believe it.
I mean, that was just scary.
But then again, these guys, once they get their feet wet, once they take off their goulashes and get their feet wet,
then we really will love you in deep crap.
Who should get the permanent 2-4 pm slot, I can't wait.
Because now we've got this revolving thing we keep putting Gildi.
Gildi's on again today, standing by the Iyenta Center.
Oh my god, with all the respect, Gildi.
And then of course the Panthers, they're done.
Don't believe those promos.
It's Sidney Crosby, by the way.
There are people who prefer to win Sid the Kid, okay?
But not Sid. Nobody calls him Sid, except in that stupid promo, which is another reason that nobody shows up.
I'll tell you one thing, at least Bruins Game last night.
There must have been at least 60 people at that game, and if I show thousands of people, this guy's as empty yellow seats.
Always a good idea in the arena where you don't draw well to have yellow seats.
Who should get the permanent 2-4 slot on QAIM when we finally make up our mind?
You remember that song by Love and Spoonful and John Sebastian?
Did you ever have to make up your mind?
I bet you got that in there.
I do, but I had to try to find out.
I already should have done that.
Oh geez, just like the phone thing I shut down up on there too.
Because I could have squeezed another quick call or two.
Suds call him in 99.
You ready for that?
Not gonna happen.
Great guy, we love him.
Mad Dog 93.
Pretty tight.
Out of 500 and some odd.
If you're a drug addict, you get 74, you're moving up, you're sliding up there, ever so, you know.
Holy but surely out.
Yeah, look out now.
My, my, my.
Was that really Gilbert?
Yes.
Oh god.
I won't listen anyway 62.
Kurt, how about Gilbert?
Let's put Gilbert on there.
Come on.
He could sure do better than Mo did.
Kurt is 45.
Bring back more 39.
The big old 29.
Kimba Volkamp are 19.
Reverend Jones 16.
Giali Solomon take Caterseh man 14.
Not too strong Giali.
The Crow 13.
I hit this full nine.
Joe Zagaki ate Ernie Sochin for.
And Lenny Martez still stuck on three.
Bye, bye, bye.
