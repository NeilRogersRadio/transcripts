And we came to the Johnny Cash Concent.
Hello?
Yes.
What about Johnny Cash?
Well, see, I never know where they're on the air.
I'm sitting here talking as soon as I left promo wins and they don't, they don't open
my pot.
They're smoking it, but they don't want to open it.
Yeah, I was going to say idiots.
So a big shake up at WTVJ.
Really?
I didn't hear about that.
Where would we hear about that?
John Fleischman's column today, page four in the air.
No, on Fleischman's column.
What a joke.
What a market man.
You know what reminds me of your buddy Tom Jicca?
Here we have this big story on Friday about the, your personal brand-new.
The first show.
Does it make it into anywhere in the Sunsetville?
No.
Does it make it anywhere in a hero that's a very jackass?
No.
And that's what you got in the market.
Maybe he was no big deal.
Yeah, right.
No, maybe both newspapers don't have anybody that writes about local radio or TV when
John Fleischman of Gossip Con has to be the one writing about V-Shake of a WTVJ.
I think it's a pretty significant story.
Well, then how come it's not on the front page for quite a lot?
What kind of garbage newspapers have you gotten so far anyhow?
Some markets don't put the television changes on the front page of their papers.
Well, how about the front page of the entertainment section?
Wouldn't that make sense?
What entertainment section?
I don't know.
Whatever the arts and arts and arts, whatever they call it.
That would make sense.
What happened?
What's the big change?
Every and Bob Weaver back?
No.
How about they do?
They let everybody else bring it in.
They bring him back?
Del Frank.
Wow.
You know I had him as a guest on my show one time.
I know this news.
He was a great news guy.
He was a very good guy.
He came from Washington.
He came to South Florida kind of like semi-retire.
Well, the weekend guy is going to be doing 11 o'clock now.
Well, that's not a news story.
I had that on days ago.
Yeah, they told me that.
I didn't hear you say it.
Yeah.
But Friday, you mean Michael Williams?
That's not WTBJ, is it?
Yeah, Michael Williams is going to be doing...
Oh, that's right.
I tried SWFOR now.
I can't keep track.
He's going to be doing nighttime instead of your buddy, cigaretteo.
And Tony will just be doing six o'clock.
Good.
That's a good step.
Now just to get him off of that, we'll be doing a real favor for everybody.
Silly guy.
And not a news guy, Tony.
You're like the Camberl Martian of news.
You're a jock.
You're a sports guy.
Go back to you, Emtony or a silly guy.
He's been doing a news for a long time.
I know, and I'm not a very good job either.
But he yucks it up pretty good.
In fact, they should have yanked his ass out of there at the same time they got rid of sloppy Veloppi.
47-year-old Jennifer Veloppi?
Talk about Ego's, man.
They both wanted to be taken to work in a limousine when they started doing the six o'clock news together.
So take their ass out of there in the limousine.
So Nesprow, age 39.
Jackie Nesprow, oh my god.
With Williams, age 47, at 11 o'clock, and then Sagittal, age 57.
I mean, next to everybody's name is their age.
Why is that?
You tell me.
How old are you, Johnny Fliceman?
How I'd say about 80?
Old bag.
Why do they do that?
Why the hell have you got to try to embarrass people?
I mean, we're old and we admitted.
But Johnny Fliceman, I guarantee you, she makes us look like teenagers that old bitch.
Bob Weaver's 76.
Well, what kind of thing is that to put in there?
She listed all the people who have left since 2003.
What about Ralph Brennan?
How old is he now?
Ralph is a...
That's what I'm saying.
He died?
Yeah.
How about Del, what that was his name?
The guy that used to do the voiceovers.
The other, the weekend weather guy.
The weekend weather guy.
Yeah, oh jeez.
He used to do all the voiceovers for WDTVJ.
Oh, what's on...
I'm a...
Not Frank one.
No.
It wasn't out Frank one?
No, not even close.
He was a weekend weather guy.
I vaguely remember Donald Frank, but that's not who I'm talking about.
Well, it'll come to me.
Like a bolt from above.
I'm sure he's dead.
He used to do the weather.
Weaver did the weather most of the time.
And his guy was to do the weather on TVJ.
Jesus.
I forgot.
Anyway, it'll...
It'll strike me.
Strike me down.
So, it listed all the people who had left the Jerry Healthman and...
Oh, thank goodness.
I like...
You know, speaking of Jerry Healthman, now, wasn't it like her family got murdered
or something one time, remember that?
Oh, right.
But it was her stepmother.
Wasn't it my father?
No, her father.
Whatever one of ours.
Her stepmother killed her father.
Well, and...
Well, there you go.
I don't want to sound insensitive.
But Jerry Healthman was working a channel 10 years ago,
and she put together a show.
It was when I left WS News to go to INZ.
And she put together a show with Dwight Ford Lauderdale hosting the show with...
I'm talk radio.
And so, we get on the stage.
There's David Gold from GBS, remember old GBS, when they try to go talk.
And there was...
Mr. Ego was on there from WS News, and I'm on there from representing INZ.
And there was somebody else on there too.
And the whole audience is stacked.
There's a little crone sitting there with his wife and family.
And there's John A-Han Levitt, my former producer from WS News,
and Tom Don't Like Us.
The whole audience is stacked with WS News people.
She invited them to bring the stack, the audience, with all their people.
And nobody from GBS or INZ was in the audience.
What a joke.
I actually got up and walked out.
Visible bitch, Jerry Healthman.
I hope you're live.
How old is she, by the way?
It says 46.
Oh, I like Jerry a lot.
I don't care.
You like her all you want.
You're the guy to try to get Kim Bo-Camp or on that 2-4 slot.
What do you mean?
I tried to get him on a pole.
I tried to get him on a pole.
You're even worse than George Bennett.
It's so easy to push your buttons to just have it so predictable.
At least you didn't try to get your buddies a gaki in there anyway.
Good God.
He has other things to do.
Well, thank God.
Oh, man.
Yeah.
Oh, we know.
Talk about a nice afternoon siesta.
Although it is kind of like a Latino and Italian kind of a tradition
that mid-aftonuncy, yes, that would work.
And then Mad Dog could be like you're human alarm clock.
I still say, Maddage 2-6, man.
That's my solution for the thing.
We got Curtis today.
And they're only doing this one day at a time.
Like that show with that awful show with Bonnie Franklin.
One day at a time.
Curtis, today we don't know about tomorrow.
I'm not big on that.
I don't know who tomorrow is either.
Well, they don't have decided yet.
Oh.
Keeping guessing.
It's the mystery host.
I say, Maddage 2-6, what do you think about that?
I think...
I say there's not a shot in the world he does it.
Why not?
I'll tell you what, take half the money they were paying Mo.
And add that on top of what very Zidians are already paying this guy.
He hardly works anyway.
And him to the six.
Why should he do it?
For the money?
He's making plenty.
Yeah.
But he's still only worked about what he's been doing for years.
Right?
He only worked about 12 weeks a year.
12 weeks a year.
So there you go.
He's got it.
He almost feels as good as yours.
He feels better than any of ours, believe you me.
I've never seen a guy like that.
It's about the 30th of December.
We're saying, oh, well, Maddage's off for the rest of the rest of the year.
Because he's done his quota of shows.
Yeah.
He's done his 40 shows for the year.
Why?
I'll tell you that joy.
She sure got us, didn't she?
Yeah.
Oh, man.
What a loser.
I don't think you will do it.
Why not?
Because I'm just...
And you lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
You lose your wife.
Yeah.
That's what it means.
Four to seven are the most important hours.
Really?
Yeah.
I got an idea.
He'll do two to five and you come back and do five to seven.
You can do a split shift.
You're only doing three hours anyway.
I do that.
You would?
You come back and do five to seven?
Sure.
You would come back and do five to seven the afternoon and do like six hours a day.
Five hours.
It's only five.
Yeah, for the same money.
For the same money you're making now.
What's that?
For the same money you're making now.
You come back and do another two hours.
That's our kind of guy.
Oh, he shows.
Oh, he shows me.
I'm not talking about an addition to this.
I said you come back and do five to seven.
Oh, it's not.
Trip to the track.
Call our CES that are.
No.
Oh, come on.
You forget Jim has a business to run.
Yeah.
So what does that have to do with anything?
He has been four a day.
You're also forgetting he used to do two to four.
Yeah.
So that's two hours a day.
Right.
Well, he wasn't going back to the office after four.
He was going home.
I'm telling you he won't do it.
Okay.
Well, I'm going to try it.
I think that's the that's the bananas.
Why don't we invent that would make us the greatest radio station in America today on AM,
which isn't saying much, but that's what it would do.
I'm not saying it's not right, but he has a deal.
Well, there's that Ray Nogginhead again, Mr. Chocolate Factory.
What an idiot.
Now, let me say this to you.
If a white guy would have said we want to make Kalamazoo, for example, the vanilla city.
You know, we want all white people here.
Can you imagine the human cry of the hysteria that would have been it would have like a try to linse a guy like that?
And Ray Nogginhead, he comes up there and says, Oh, well, the Orleans of God wants it to be a chocolate city.
Now, he's like trying to water it down a little bit with a little vanilla extract.
We have break.
Wouldn't the idiot?
The Orleans is they say.
Correct.
Back to normal for now, but they still have to put the levies.
Yeah.
The levies.
I mean, they're either the George Morton levie pace there is what they need.
Rhybred.
Rhybred and Kajron cuisine, man.
That's a good company.
The mix.
Yeah.
That Emerald Mickey Lagasse.
Well, listen, have a great day at the, uh, track today.
No, I'm not at the track today.
Well, well, let's see.
It's Wednesday.
Have a busy day today.
No, I'm not doing woodbuying today either.
I'm letting my wallet heal up from Monday.
I got most of it back, but just the shocking experience.
I will be back at the track until Saturday.
Me too.
I'll be there Saturday morning bright and early.
And I'll tell you if that this, there's this one, uh, a packing guy now who's taking a fancy
to my machine that I like.
And I'm going to like drag his ass off of there just like that Russian bitch try to do to me the other day.
I want to play 10 machines out playing.
Man, man, man.
And center the Siberia that bitch.
Maybe it's too much vodka that makes those people the way they are.
Who is it?
Oh, there was a Russian bitch of the other day.
She had like a whole bunch of machines tied up.
And I'm sitting there.
She, in her trick was she put two coins and then she'd run away for a half an hour and play on the other side.
And her coats on the chair.
And she's afraid that somebody else might win something.
That kind of person, you know what I mean?
Kind of people I want to come in and type all the good machines, man.
See, I can't take the strife at the slot machine place.
What do you mean, brother?
Well, no, you wouldn't like, uh, you wouldn't like this place because the kind of the drags of mankind come in there.
I told you they take the TTC, the bus system goes right up to Woodbine.
Yeah, and so, so a lot of the, uh, the, how do I say it gently?
A lot of the scum of the universe so I wind up in the hole.
And where do you get where we put slot machines?
No, that's not true.
Niagara Falls, man.
It falls view.
They said the finest.
And anybody that goes in there and their tongue doesn't hang down to their shoes, man.
It's got to be blind, deaf and dumb.
The most beautiful, young, well-dressed people.
I mean, it places palatial.
Really?
Yes. And they got the biggest sports book in Canada.
I'm telling you, you enjoy falls view a lot.
Look at the people who go down the busses to go to Atlantic South.
Well, that's the same thing with Woodbine.
That's what I'm telling you.
They get on the bus.
Well, you know the kind of people that get on the bus.
Yeah, but all the respect to you people out there that use the bus, or out of you folks use slime balls.
Where do you have buses?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It reminds me of Don Bussey, the great harness driver.
Well, anyway, on that note, have a great day.
You too.
And save it for a rainy day.
I'm just saying to that weather guy.
Oh, Dick Fennel.
Oh, Dick Fennel was great.
Yeah, see, he's dead though, isn't he?
I'm not sure.
Well, let's find out.
That's your assignment for today.
Dick Fennel seed.
Maybe.
He did all the voiceovers.
He was the voice of Channel WTVJ.
Dick Fennel liked him a lot.
In fact, I met him when I was on some stupid show on that channel one time.
That I was on the Jimmy Sifilow show on Channel 10 one time.
I've been around, man.
Over the years, I had the great show that Kendall Toyota show marked Jacobson and Don Cox rest in peace.
Oh, I remember that show.
Oh, boy, talk about an embarrassment.
Well, I had to do it to keep the account, you know, and then Wayne bought that place.
So forget about that.
Listen, have a great day and see how to Wayne over the ballpark.
Say, give him a big kiss and I'll sit.
I'll be there.
Yeah.
Don't, don't, don't, don't.
No.
Don't say don't say don't.
I can talk to you.
I can talk to you.
I can talk to you.
Hey, whoa.
See you around.
With a finding life in some of the town's doors.
I feel what can we know to really care.
Have you moved?
You're going fine.
Don't say anything.
Nobody wants to move.
You're back to check it.
I'm still there.
Ain't the past is easy to be.
Here is the day I bought that place.
This will be damaged once you go away.
I get you should watch well these old weary kids.
I'm dead.
Good girl, watch something that's bad.
All time stop to be around and I came on top.
Now you're just another boy's box.
I don't know why you got beaten to and are over it's day.
I had your box but I hit you.
I got you.
I'm dead.
I'm going to miss you.
I'll see.
I told you somebody would.
10-14 already.
We better do the break and get in the show.
Don't have time to waste.
I'll show today.
Well, I thank somebody thereof.
Curtis Stevenson and to the staff known in the mystery host spot.
And then Mad Dog 4-7.
I don't care what Hank says.
I think 2-6 is just fine.
Do it for us.
Do it for the team, Mad Dog.
You're a team player.
What for the team?
That's right.
One for the jipper.
10-14, a QM.

This is Neil Rogers.
This is 5-16-2-8-8-8.
No!
Neil Rogers got it.
Stop doing truth culture that is now.
What's up with that real sir?
Some days you say that he is fine.
Some days you say he has flat lines.
So come on and let us know.
Will he stay or will he go?
He worked not paid, paid, paid.
He had a stroke for heaven's sake.
I think someone is yelling lies.
Don't even know if he's alive.
Maybe he's doing just so so.
What's up with Ariel Shogun?
I mentioned that old bag, Joni, fleshman of the arrow.
She must be about 110 years old.
You know, she's over the Mathuzelist grandma.
And she's talking about other people's age.
What is that all about?
What difference does it make how old Tony cigaretteo is?
How old?
How come Joni's fleshman don't put in there?
I'm 73.
We want to know how old you are.
Joni put it on the headline in the front page.
Joni's fleshman celebrates 89th birthday.
What a cracker crap.
Such a bush-league town.
It always has been always will be.
I don't care what anybody says.
I mean, that's one thing you can take to your grave.
You know for a fact that nothing is ever going to change.
It's just a matter of degrees.
You know what I mean?
It's like the temperature, just like the weather.
Just a matter of degrees.
Anyway, an engineer was kidnapped and tenor raki's killed today.
Things are going very well over there.
Oh, where far?
I'm going to attack three vehicles in Western Baghdad.
About 30 minutes earlier, three Iraqi police and once they've hidden a roadside bomb attack on a police patrol in Al-Sania.
45 miles east of Bakuba.
It was Kuba.
Also, gunmen killed three people in a flat in Southwestern Baghdad's Al-Baya neighborhood today.
It just had a lot of killing, a lot of bloodshed, a lot of people dying.
Freedom's on the march.
Yeah, freedom's on the march.
These poor bastards, man.
He went in there and like, just turned their lives.
I won't say we turned it upside down.
We took away a lot of lives and maimed and tortured and wounded and all these things.
But nevertheless, surprise for freedom, baby.
It's a surprise to get in there.
That big American.
You put in those oil fields.
Here's the poll from yesterday, speaking of that, speaking of that,
a whole Iraqi situation and all the other situations like Northern Ireland and the Middle East.
Basically, this thing with Iran.
It's the same old crap.
The Arabs and the Jews.
What, you know what?
Castle Hoistle, both of you folks.
The all you militant.
I mean, you know, I'm not one of those Jews.
I don't care about Israel.
I don't care about any of that stuff.
I don't hate the Arabs.
I don't hate the, you know, I deal with people one at a time.
Now, birds, that's an understanding.
They all need to be taken out.
What?
I don't know what you're laughing about.
All you people with your parrots and parakeets and minor birds and kakatu and whatever else you got in the cage,
we're coming to get it.
In fact, even though you know how I feel about cats, right?
I got a cat rescue story here somewhere.
I don't want to put it where I put it.
Well, cats kill birds, so you know, that's what I'm saying.
What we're going to do to start making ziggins of cats.
We're going to have them reproducing like rabbits.
And they're going to be like 12 trillion cats.
We're going to turn them loose to kill all the birds.
The only problem is cats can't fly too good, but maybe we can make some flying cats,
are you saying?
You throw one hard nut that flies, trust me.
No, with all this great genetic engineering we have right now,
maybe they can make a flying cat.
Just wait, go up there and grab them birds round the sky.
Anyway, what's the worst thing about religion?
1710, folks.
Breeds hate an intolerance form of 82.
All of these things, 316, all of these...
All of these things that we'll get to here, 360.
We put that on late too.
All of these things except one.
Sponsor violent fanatics, 272.
Is there any doubt about that?
No way, Jose.
Stop it, a bubble mic is okay.
It's okay if it's...
You know what they do like with kids?
You see in the movies all the time.
A parent gets killed or dies from some disease.
Oh well, Danny, he's in heaven now.
What's he coming back?
He's never coming back.
He's in a better place.
He's never...
I mean, that's a lie, like Santa Claus,
but maybe that's about the only way that parents can explain death to little kids.
You know, when they're like 18 or 19.
You'll be hooking up with them later, you know, when you die.
Yeah, right.
Which of course makes the kid go forward to that same day.
Good daddy again up there in the sky.
We don't know what he's going to look like,
because he ain't got no body, no mole,
and he ain't got no heart, no brain, no liver,
and no kidneys, but other these things.
He's not doing too bad.
No pancreas, no bladder.
Anyway, Sponsor violent fanatics, 272.
It's all bullshit, 217.
Now we're talking.
That's my kind of answer.
I like the people that voted for that.
It's all pile of crap.
I will have to add, dolly dolly.
Dolly dolly.
Keeps people stupid when they need to.
Nothing, we needed badly, 81.
That percentage here dropped way down.
4.7% of his audience is that stupid, man.
We need religion, bad, or what?
Oh, can you imagine what a blood bath the earth would be if we didn't have religion?
I think we're doing a pretty good job, and then already even with it.
Right.
Let's try without it for about 100 years.
Oh, then what would we argue about it?
Well, there you go.
Politics.
Okay.
And of course, chocolate versus vanilla.
What can brown, let me ask you, Ray and Agen, what can brown do for you?
Anyway, in Pete's scientific progress, 55, I hate these polls 50.
We're going to put that on every day just for the haters out there to get out of your system.
BAM!
Get a good one of those out.
BAM!
A great waste of time in money, 31, and encourages overpopulation only vantiquantre.
I don't understand that.
Only 24.
There was a good choice.
Huh?
There was somebody other good choices on this.
No, something that got away.
That's one of the worst things.
And of course, you talk about wild, you know, and it's a family, the fetus huggers, you know,
all of that whole concept, right?
And here's today's poll, which we want to thank Mike.
Wasn't it, Michael?
Yes, Michael Ike motorcycle, who Mike, I don't want to use his last name from somewhere.
Fasted in yesterday?
For me listening to Neil Rogers is a guilty pleasure because I'm A or N, whatever.
346.
Now, not only above 225, but then we get into any meat to the matter.
A cranky old far 23, employed by another radio station, 14, uh-huh?
How do you like that?
Everybody in this market is listening to this show.
You know that.
I've got 14, you multiply that times 100, you have 1400 other radio station people listen right now.
And especially they listen to them, they want to trends in the earnings come out.
Speaking of that, when's that fall book coming out?
But is this going to be the fall book?
I don't know.
Yeah, I'm talking about December.
Oh my god.
I beg your pardon?
What do we ask now?
Clarence.
Okay.
Oh, is she off to another Hurricane game or something?
No, no, he's here.
Well, how come we don't have a date on the calendar there for when the fall book comes out?
This is not just another one that was meaningless trends.
This is the rating book.
This is our bonus money, baby.
Right out.
This decides whether you or Josh ever get another check.
This decides whether Norma can't ever get any money this year from me.
Now, I think he made a good point.
He emailed me last night about a band in pet rescue because he's oblivious to the fact we're doing the best of this for them.
As usual, he's out of touch with anything going on connected to the show or my life.
And as a result of that, I'm thinking, yeah, instead of giving him that money this year, I'll send the money to a band in pet rescue.
Look, to think.
That's a great idea.
For little dogs and kitty cats, they need my help as opposed to Norma who made Zidian sell that Fag newspaper.
What he says.
Cranky old FAR-24, employed by another radio station 15, it's moving on up.
Hawkesh Republican 14.
Ooh, Gunhugger 12.
A lot of crossover needs.
Fag-Hitter 12.
Like all those three categories, probably a mix and match.
Redneck 9.
There's another one.
Whitewing Christian 9.
And another one.
Clansman 8.
And another one.
Jamaican 6-mon.
Oh, man.
An old green tooth Cuban 5.
Orthodox Jew 4.
Five.
And a Nazi sympathizer 4.
So I think there's lines two kind of cancel each other out.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
A Nazi sympathizer 4.
What do you think about that?
That's kind of a good polar.
You know, I mean, not the above is obviously going to win because most of our people are just your normal everyday.
That's going to be wonderful folks, right?
Yeah.
Make no mistake of booth that.
I mean, I'd vote for the green tooth thing, but my teeth are yellow.
I see.
Well, maybe I'll get some of that, uh, the strips that you put on your teeth.
What is that all about?
That's the white-ish strips?
Yeah.
The paint in the ass.
I tried that once.
What is that?
Yeah.
Garbage.
I guess the worst of teeth.
I know it's a very strange concept, but brush your teeth.
That's a really good idea.
And don't be using those two-faced acut that are carcinogen.
And I remember I read the name of those that day.
Yeah, well, what was it?
I don't know.
Oh, well.
Mother Colgate's Colgate.
Aqua fresh.
I used crest myself.
And when you say that I used the one with the little breath strips, it's mine, right?
I said it was fine.
I said it was fine.
Who went to get a big tumor on your throat?
I don't know.
Who the hell knows?
Oh, you're used at Colgate with like the little breath strips and if that's kind of strange, what is that all about?
I don't know.
I like it.
He likes the strip factor.

You're a tough guy, huh?
Why, I ought to see you.
Oh, no.
You're passing here.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
You're passing here.

Let me bless you, my son.
I'm the new hope.
I'm the new hope.
I'm the new hope.

I don't like the look of her.
I don't want your tutelist over me.
You're a good boy.
You're a good boy.
I'll never bite me.
You're a good boy.
Of course it's worth working that I have lived you.
Why, I'll have you now.
I'll go home now or I'll go home.
Watch out for Mr. Whipple.
Sweet.
I don't scream.
I'll laugh.
I'll go home.
I'll go home.
I'll go home.
Look out about it.
That's what I say against my ass.
Oh, man.
I have a tear.
What an epic.
Does that bring tears to your eyes?
All of this is mushrooms.
That movie I watched again for the second time.
Improbable in what is it called?
Right in the down just in case.
All right, that's not an end.
I'm going to get it for you.
What is it called?
Imaginary Heroes.
All right.
With the Sigourney Weaver and Emil Hirsch, not related to sunny Hirsch, so it's at
Hirsch.
Right.
I'm obsessed with Emil Hirsch.
Don't look on the internet.
By the way, there's no good pictures on it.
We're old bad.
You're going to go ahead and look anyway.
I've been informed that you already checked.
I checked.
Oh, you kidding me?
I'm sure.
Why not?
And anyway, let's get to a lot of these calls here today.
What do you say?
By the way, tomorrow is the book.
Tomorrow at 1130.
How do you like the psychic vibes again?
He does it again.
How the hell is that possible?
You got it.
Start tomorrow is 1130 is the full book comes out.
Oh, I'm going to be outseeked at tomorrow.
The pressure is building tremendous.
But we never really got the monthly for November.
I have no idea.
His member always on vacation or whatever.
And so I don't really know whether we did well or poorly.
We're going to be dropping off a big September.
I know that.
So we better have a huge December.
I'm telling you right now, man.
Otherwise, Joe Bell is going to start looking at rearranging the whole lineup on here.
He might even bring in the big heavyweights like Joe Zaganki and Kimba Bull Camper.
5.670560.
Tom 560 and the Verizon singular wireless line.
You notice, remember that the blur by the head about the Hillary Clinton speech, right?
And she said Congress was running like a plantation.
And then another tried all these media including the CNN.
Oh, well, did she do herself harm by that?
What did she mean by that?
Oh, come on.
Oh, what do you people are so transparent?
You not see bastards.
You sell-outs.
You did it during Vietnam.
You're doing it again now during Iraq.
And every one of you people in the media got blood on your hands.
Your hands are so bloody.
You've never even even a whole can of comic cleanser can't scrub it off.
How do you like that?
You slime balls.
WDQAM. Hello.
Hey, is this 96x?
96x, power 96.
96x, huh?
Well, it's purely new.
Two of us need to hit that.
Yeah.
5.670560.
Tom 560, that was, I think, the Casper put that on your 96x, remember that?
I do remember that.
Yeah.
Schmuck.
WDQAM, hello.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This meal?
Sounds like me, yes.
Hey, guys, doing one-time listserv, first-time four.
Yeah.
I want to tell you guys about a movie that was very, very good.
It got very little publicity because of a lawsuit.
It's called Loan Star.
Star's, uh, Chris Conner.
Chris Christophecine, Elizabeth Sinha, and Matthew McCotany.
And the rest of us are John Sales.
And, uh, Chris Christophecine as an evil sheriff is incredible.
And you guys should Google it and see the review on it.
Uh, very interesting use of flashbacks, just a really well done movie.
A university of Miami professors sued the producers just before we were due to be released in theaters because she said they stole our story.
Oh, yeah.
That's a never-gun crowd, man.
But your hard asses.
It never got released and went directly to video stores.
Loan Star directed by John Sales.
Oh, guys, well, thanks a lot, Tally.
Sure.
Bye-bye.
I like it.
I'm going to write down Loan Star.
It's got Chris Conner and Chris O'Neal and Chris Christophe Roo.
Try to forget that it's got Chris Christophecine.
No, I don't like him at all.
In fact, Star is born.
Somebody should have been shot for we make an M movie.
Twice.
It was a great move.
No, the middle one was good.
The one with James Mason and Judy Garland.
That was the definitive one.
The original one with Fredrick March would just be on Silent Movie.
I mean, it was in the 30s, I believe.
I like those kinds of movies.
Well, I'm happy for you.
In fact, we got a channel you'd like.
I got a lot of channels you'd like.
I'll let's see.
320 is the silver channel.
The final movie.
I'm going to be on there right now.
Victoria the Great.
I'm going to go like 40s with this.
30k.
This is Godless.
Huh?
30s and 40s movies.
God-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
What's going on?
Don't know.
What's going on?
Thanks for all those Victorian attitudes, by the way, Queenie.
You bitch.
Somebody QAM, hello.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
I have a question about the Panther's home schedule.
Yeah.
February 9th, February 13th.
Do you know if they have any home games?
Probably a good idea to Google it.
Go online and do the Panthers.
Call me for the schedule to have any home games.
Do we have a Panther's schedule?
No.
Although I do understand the Panthers have several
a lot of inventory on the station.
Half of our spots are going to subsidize Alan Cohen
because he keeps making up those phony attendance numbers there.
You're not fooling anybody, Alan, okay?
We love the Panthers.
They lie a lot.
Come on.
17,000 for the Columbus game.
They must have been hanging on the outside.
Or maybe they cut all the people shopping
if the sawgrass, you think that could be it?
Could they?
Call about the Panther's schedule.
I'm like, call up a sports show, okay?
Call up for Cross the Street.
Maybe those idiots are...
Oh, and by the way, my fearless prediction
for a Democrat's Street tomorrow.
Oh!
This is Point O!
Point O!
Point O!
This is 5.16 QAO!
This is the most disgusting program.
I urge everyone to complain to this station.
Are you a methamphetamine addict looking for a
whiter smile for your three remaining teeth?
Try method and toothpaste.
When I'm spun out on crank,
I know I look my very best in my looks.
Turn it sideways.
Oh, good.
Method and toothpaste has extra fluoride protection
for the all-night tweaker who's worried about tartar buildup.
It's not a reputable brain damage.
You'll mess with that, Jimmy.
Gask if I smoke some.
No, it won't.
Really?
I'm going to try it in a way.
Your brain cells may be dead,
but your teeth will look that way with method and toothpaste
available in the recreational pharmaceutical section
of your local supermarket.
We'll just try that cool gate with the little log
of breakfast in it.
I just googled the Panther thing here
and they got no home games in the days where.
What's the name of it?
No home games in February?
No, they got February 3rd.
The Atlanta trashers are in town,
but then after that, they're on the road the rest of the month.
And of course, there's the break for the Olympics in there too,
which is where we get travesty and idiotic thing.
Nice going NHLU idiots.
But anyhow, sorry, no home pants in game in those days
for that punk they called before.
We thought it was calling a sports show, something like that.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
We're talking about great movies that nobody ever heard of before today.
I bet you nobody in this audience saw that movie
that I'm all whipped up about.
Imaginary heroes.
Did you write it down?
I did.
Why did you write it down?
Because I wasn't going to remember it otherwise.
Oh.
So another one that was brain farting things.
I was watching it and I couldn't remember the name of the movie.
Now I already saw it once before.
I saw it from beginning to end last night though.
It's about a tear to my eye, especially the email Hirsch.
But nevertheless, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Just keep your shirt on, the email, OK, cover up that here.
Palm 5, 60 isn't unusual for like a 19-year-old kid
that they have here on this chest?
Oh, it depends on what ethnicity they are yet.
Well, what would you say?
Hirsch?
What is that?
Sounds Jewish to me.
Oh!
Or Truman.
And the Germans are a squeaky clean man.
Right, hairless, are they?
They even have a hair on their...
Correct them.
Maybe a pimple or two.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Palm 5, 60, and a Verizon singular rubber spine.
How's that pool coming?
Well, you know, if we play that mow, um, good by mow bit
about four or five times, it'll be time to go home.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Oh, man.
That thing is outstanding and it is long.
For me, listening to The O'Rodges is a guilty pleasure
because I'm numbly above 284, well, thank goodness for that.
So that means that 35% of the audience though is one of the above.
Out of 435.
Cranky old fart.
We got about...
30, man.
30 vote.
Employed by another radio station, 23.
They'll be listed in tomorrow 11, 30 when those numbers come out.
Because their management keeps them in the dark, like Johnny Dark.
Is he working so hard to be able to talk to him?
You know, I don't know.
Johnny Dark.
Oh, Johnny Dork.
Hawkes Republican 17 speaking to Johnny Dork.
Gunhugger 16.
Faghater 12.
Redneck 11.
Right wing Christian 10.
Plansman 9.
A Jamaican month 6.
Oh, that's just tickles my fancy.
As they say, on pageant, it tickles old fancy.
What a pain in the ass.
She is.
Fancy and schmancy.
Old green tooth Cuban 6.
Nazi civilization 6.
An Orthodox Jew 5.
Like I said last two.
We'll cancel each other out.
Those Orthodox Jews, man, they'll get them with their...
They're just the aroma from the armpits.
We'll take care of those Nazi sympathizers.
That aroma will put you in a coma.
That's what Ariel Sharon said.
How's he doing, by the way?
Is he still a dine over there?
Oh, sorry.
What?
The aroma...
We'll put you in a coma.
Yeah, that's fine.
It will.
The Orthodox Jews in the middle of July, man, on the beach.
Oh, a moly.
Oh, they're wearing all the heavy coat and the hat.
They'll hold you there.
With a tallest and the tits isn't they?
Oh, brother.
Get a life already.
Get at least into the 16th century we've been started.
W-Q-A-N-Holo.
I'm going to put you in a coma.
That's what I'm saying.
Q-A-N.
How's he doing, by the way?
With the radio turned up real.
That sounds like me on the ear.
Q-A-N, one time.
Oh, sorry.
Just one.
The aroma.
What are you doing at coma?
Yeah, you're the gentleman.
Yeah, you're the gentleman.
Pretty good.
W-Q-A-N, hello.
Q-A-N.
Yeah.
Yes, sir?
How are you doing, sir?
Great.
I got a movie for you.
But I just wanted to call the guy who called before about lone star.
Yes.
It is a good movie, but I saw it in the theater.
Uh-huh.
But it is a great movie.
Maybe you just hate you, and maybe you say FSU fan or something.
Maybe.
Well, you know what to say about the hurricanes.
Yeah, it was.
I was going to spell a scam.
How about American splendor?
Have you ever seen that?
No.
With Paul Giamatti?
He plays an underground comic.
I missed it in the theater and I came across it on cable one night.
And I must have watched it ten times on cable and finally went out and bought it.
But it's great.
It's a sterile and kind of serious tool about real life.
I don't know if yours saw it.
No, look at it up another.
Okay.
Okay.
And splendor, I'm writing it down right now because I want to get a whole bunch of good footage for the weekend.
It's a, um, because I'm definitely not going to watch your city of God.
Yeah, you are.
No, I'm not.
Actually, you know, city of God was a good movie, but I'll never, you'll never want to go to Brazil after seeing it though.
Oh, you're already dull.
Ten minutes of it, I don't want, even without you, I don't want to go to Brazil.
How do you like that?
And you know, the other going is Karen Deer rule about a prison in Brazil.
That's another good one.
Oh, I got that.
I have to watch it.
I started watching it.
It's very good.
But very, very good.
Very disturbing already.
Excellent. Thanks a lot, Pally.
Okay.
Thanks, sir.
See you in real.
See what, uh, what do they call Cunnyval?
That's right.
Cunnyval in real mind.
Where the amendment and so or more to the women.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 10, 60.
Oh, oh, town 5, 60 leave, Verizon, Singular.
You know, there's a scene.
Oh, I got to get in the movie.
I'm going to go during a break.
I'll go in there.
I'll get a shift to you from Alexa.
All right.
Imaginary, uh, here.
Oh, speaking of stuff like that, uh, I gave a chicken neck.
Both episodes of South Park, both the, uh, the Bloody Mary one that you'll never see.
Otherwise.
Right.
And the, uh, in the closet slash signs.
I was burning up for me.
No, no, no, I already burnt them for you.
I just gave them to him to stick in the diplomatic pouch.
Oh, excellent.
So that I wouldn't have to fill out a form.
You know what I was about to say.
What was I going to say that you're going to get out of it?
I am going to do a manager here as far as, there's a scene in there at the New Year's party.
Oh, it is also a, uh, gay, very brief, but it's kind of interesting.
And then like kind of like keeps you wondering the rest of the show him and his boyfriend.
I mean, there's buddy from next door.
But, um, the New Year's Eve party, they're sitting around a guy's playing a piano.
And there's a, I don't know whether it's a woman or a drag queen or what it is.
A singer that's outrageously silly.
Yes.
Mary Christmas song.
It's just, uh, it's a funny scene.
It's just bizarre.
I have to feel.
Yes.
And just like the calls on line nine always are Q.A.M. Hello.
I got a movie for you.
Yes.
The hung in the rest list.
Yeah.
Oh, that sounds like.
Oh, we're friends.
Do it for friends.
Rest in peace, Danny.
Well, how can you be one and, uh, be the other?
W.A.M. Hello.
There is no moral on the outside.
I can show.
Seven, we're on this station either Q.A.M. Hello.
Hey, is this a meal Solomon show?
Yes, sir.
Good morning.
Hey, I just got back in the, uh,
April House Solomon speaking.
I heard, uh, the last part of your show yesterday, uh,
Howard David's not with you guys anymore.
No, he is not.
Is that he referred to?
Did he quit?
What did he do?
His contract was coming up March 10th and they made him an offer.
He decided to refuse that paid him off for the two months and, uh, no more nonsense.
And they weren't going to renew it anyway.
So he said, oh, I'll take the money for two months and buy by.
And then he said,
Oh, don't, don't, don't, don't.
It was in that.
Wow.
So can we campaign for managed from two to six now?
That's what I'm saying.
Thank you for joining the band.

Nooi, 11o305 sixty W.A. and Öx … Sherlock Man,
Musical eighteen,
Yeah, that's enough.
Go on over, do the bad taste.
The detective Kathy Collins, police spokeswoman, said the rear rest of William Amman's 18-4
lot of it was made yesterday afternoon.
Amman's was initially charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon late Monday like
Sally Fitz and was released on a $10,000 bond from the Broward County Jeb around 10 a.m. yesterday
morning.
That case alleges he attacked Raymond Perez, 49, is the homeless man privately, into the
church by the sea of the 17th-3 causeway.
And interesting was sleeping by the church and about a bing, you know?
That'll help.
Should've let's see if he'd ever been in that church at that moment.
The new Count Leges, Amman's took part in the murder of a Norris Gainer, 45, who was
beaten to death early last Thursday at Riverside Esplan Park.
According to an affidavit filed by police in the murder case against Amman's, an unnamed
witness said on a sworn statement that Amman's shot Gainer were the paintball gun.
The police statement says that Amman's admitted his use of the paintball gun to shoot the victim.
Punk.
According to a police affidavit, Amman's admitted to investigators that he and two others
have been involved in the beating of Perez and fronting Perez while he was sleeping
at a church.
Amman's the affidavit said struck Perez with a driver golf club in the head and upper
body while one of the others hit Perez with a baseball bat.
What a bunch of real gutsy kids, huh?
Although the two others mentioned the Amman's affidavit are not named, police said they
believed the three currently facing charges were involved in all three attacks.
They just danced their hobby, you know?
They go out and beat the crap out of homeless people.
Further, the rest of the name possible said Fort Lauderdale police spokesman Catherine
Collins, no relation to Dennis Collins.
Earlier in the day, a magistrate ruled that another defendant, the case Brian Hooks.
I wonder if he's came to Schmidt Hooks.
Brian Hooks, 18, would continue to be holding jail without bond.
By the way, the good news for you is that probably tomorrow you're, what is it, primal
fear is showing up.
Oh, right.
And the even better news is that imaginary hero ships out tomorrow.
I saw it.
When's my five grand coming?
When Carter runs out of pills.
Let's see.
Pull a question.
Catholic, that's a good one.
Not a full question, it's an addition for the pool.
Here would it carry or whatever your name is.
Can you read that name on there?
No.
Corey, Corey, a corny, something like that.
Well, whatever it says, Catholic is good though.
I'm a Catholic.
Why would a Catholic person of this show?
It would be called dead.
Right.
Father, a tool might get like having a wrist breakdown.
Might start running around chasing little boys.
Or even if they don't listen.
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty, pound five, sixty, and Verizon, singular, right?
Let's start over to the movie thing because that one guy, remember that?
He was very upset because he didn't like movies.
Don't you remember that?
No, I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know how it's scratch-wise.
How can there be anybody who doesn't like movies?
I can understand bad movies here.
I don't want to spend too much time watching movies.
But what kind of people do it?
That's like saying, oh, I don't want no pizza.
I don't like pizza.
I don't like water either.
What kind of people don't like pizza?
Idiots.
WDQYM, hello.
WDQYM, hello.
Oh, he can.
What's going on?
Hey, I'm a rap music listening punk.
And I listen to your show.
That's the truth.
I just got to have a fair too.
Very good movie.
I think you're right.
Yeah, I think you're like American History X too.
It's not the only two movies I've ever had.
That's right.
That's the one we are.
I wanted to put on your list.
Okay, thanks, Tommy.
Hey, save the homeless.
Use the Whippleball back.
That was great.
Oh.
American History X.
You were talking about Ed Norton and I said that he's only been good in two movies.
I was talking about Norton from of the Jackie Bleece.
That's a hard turning.
But that was his best movie, I think.
Really?
Yeah.
American History X.
No doubt about it.
You're like, well, you haven't seen Primal Fear either one of your cell.
No, don't forget me.
It's no doubt about it.
Oh, but it was just a good movie.

All right.
You're fair.
Like as he did his own movies and movies.
Maybe Dr. Travis, or as the coo-tees.
Does he win leather and carry a wig?
Or have a massive colsoir on his leg?
When you look at him, he appears attractive.
Maybe Dick Ornys, maybe O'Watkins.
Why does he need to go on the TV?
Will we find out that he has life received?
Maybe he's a chancelor who drinks ripples.
Or maybe the doctor has a third knifle.
Or is it just personal police adorks?
Is it hard to get girls when your name is stolen?
Is he blindy?
Is he tiny?
Or covered in fur?
The reason's no matter because what's done is done.
He's Travis of that show.
Hey, hey!
Love and 19.
When your name is Stork, it's hard to get the girls.
That's what my old friend Jim Stewart told me.
Not too hard to get guys, but getting girls.
Anyway, it says here are facts you know.
And look at this from University Dodge again.
I guess vote cameras where you put an info for that two to four.
He's putting on the full court press.
I think the slogan at the little bird whispered my ear was just say,
No!
And the mole.
I could be wrong about that.
I'm thinking mad dog to the six.
It just came to me in a vision.
Pay him whatever he wants.
Just give him a blank check.
Facts is from Ray, I believe it is.
You know if the quotes were on Sunday,
the NFL never admits publicly they must up that call.
What do you think, Josh?
Yeah, true.
Oh, lunches there already.
It sounds to me like how he's.
It is.
It smells like how he's too.
Sounds and smells and feels just like how he's in boy.
When it comes on a way out, you'll know it.
That's my second powers again.
Part number two often in psychic powers.
Because the ratings coming out the fall book tomorrow.
Boy!
Boy, the pressure.
I wasn't ready for that pressure.
Only the 19th.
I don't understand how that's possible.
That's good point.
But that's what they tell us.
What do you mean?
It's a good point.
Well, there's no ratings the last two weeks of December,
the first two weeks in January.
So it's not this one that comes out really, really late.
It's the January trend.
That'll be unreal.
Anyway.
Very important story.
Muy importante, baby.
San Francisco.
California prosecutor say the man and woman who pleaded guilty
in the infamous Wendy's chili finger case are grifters
and deserve the maximum sentence.
What is a grifter?
I know what a drifter is, but what is a grifter?
A colored artist.
A street lover.
You never heard that before.
Is that like the movie's called?
Is that like the movie's called?
The Gixis.
A Kermit movie.
The first three-year-old.
Right.
Gripters are the one who do the three-card monty
and they have a whole bunch of scams.
They do the full money if they can.
Python.
Anna Ayala faces up to nine years eight months.
Jamie Pascensia could get up to 13 years in prison
on this charges.
That's his unlucky number.
They pleaded guilty.
By the way, speaking of 13, that's on these two-hour day
a meaningless goal last night.
It's about time you idiot and then the leafs
to lose good ball up again.
They suck.
Anyway, these two people pleaded guilty in September
to charges tied to a pot to put a severed finger
in a bowl of chili to seek a pout.
Sentin' and of course the worst part is it was somebody else's finger.
Well, who did you work for a hour?
Sentin's in case place today.
In documents file last week in Santa Clara County,
prosecutors say Ayala called her sister from jail
and tried to retaliate against her son,
who she thought had given the police a lead.
The prosecutors say the boy remained faithful to his mother
and never told police what he knew.
In the papers, prosecutors say the couple shows a total selfishness
and perceived entitlement to other people's money.
And just like Josh Cordester,
a defense lawyer said prosecutors try to use media pressure.
See there you go, you're going to wind up copying your finger chopped off,
trying to squeeze that five grand out of my fat old egg.
This is grace.
5670560, pound 56 in the Verizon singular wireless line.
So many good movies and so little time.
So let's see, do I want to watch American splendor,
American history, echelon star, or city of God this weekend?
Well, city of God since you already have it.
But then, I would recommend American history X.
Have I seen that what's that about?
Ed Norton is a neo-Nazi who gets a lesson in life
when things don't go his way.
I'll be damned.
56705 here, distracted by something on the phone.
Sorry, sorry.
By a spot, naked people in a bathtub.
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.
Not there.
Shaman, you're probably watching the same thing.
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
For the poll, there's a 9-11 bull egg.
You can get on Canal Street, New York.
And if they don't have it, they'll say, no more.
Come back two weeks.
And the other thing is that I would put that Mandage Guy
in the same category as South Park and Rita Crosby.
Totally un-listenable voices.
Thank you.
Was that one of the worst calls in the history of talk radio?
Absolutely.
Yeah.
That's the worst.
You might have been the worst, okay, sir.
That's saying a lot.
It covers a lot of territory.
Uh-oh.
Don Ho has stem cell treatment.
Johnny Fliceman says Don Ho just turned 146, by the way.
What is that crap that put everybody's age in there
and at the WTVJ, what does that mean?
I don't know.
I think what's his name?
I'm a super ass for age discrimination.
There you go, Larry.
Had nothing to do with your age, Larry.
Just sucked on the ear.
W-D-Q-Y-M, hello.
Hey, Neil, how are you today?
Okay, Pally.
I got two things for you.
Yes.
One.
How do you feel about foreign films or subtitles?
I don't.
I very seldom watch those.
I can't stand it.
Yeah, my wife made me go to one and turned out to be a really great film.
I really enjoyed it.
What was that?
It was called sequestro express.
Okay.
I had never heard of it.
It was a limited release.
And I fought and kicked and screamed the whole way going.
But it turned out to really be enjoyable.
Very serious, very heavy with a lot of humor thrown in.
Good movie.
Second thing for you is I'm talking to a studio.
I just walked into some Arabic church.
We had a little chat and yelling at the screaming.
And nobody spoke to me to find out where you were.
Yeah, that's it.
That's the right U.A.M.
You can talk about the head gear.
I don't know if I'm going to paper jam.
Oh, damn it.
No, whistle of tune.
You know what?
Sing something, Josh.
No, I'm good thing.
You know rap is the light.
No, you do.
Go ahead.
You can do the wonder mic parts.
I got the instrumental.
Yeah, you got that on there.
Should cue that up next time he has a paper jam.
And we'll rap.
And it'll be the light.
Oh, he is.
Wow.
Man.
Woo!
See how it takes that.
I was such a bad guy.
I had to pull the drum out.
I had to bang the drum slowly.
That was a bad.
Now the paper is actually like red hot because it got stuck in air.
Man, oh man.
Talk about a paper burn.
What is this thing that you sent to me?
It says, death by...
Oh, Josh has got to say the word.
Pony up the light there.
Death by...
See you.
Yeah.
Oh, and it came over.
It came across twice.
I was very...
I was very...
Colatided.
Colatided.
Careful.
Do you ever have that Colatized?
Just this morning.
It was never the same after he wrenched his neck dodging a sizzling flying...
See you.
At Benihana.
His widow testified to me today in support of a $10 million suit against the restaurant chain.
Oh, I got it.
I don't want to rush through this.
I'll do this after the break.
This is a good story.
Do you believe this?
I have to.
It's in the new day, right?
This guy wrenched his neck dodging a sizzling flying...
See you.
At Benihana.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 5.69 AF.
This is Dan Rattich, former CBS evening news anchor man.
And now, a punchline.
My former networks inability to find a suitable replacement for me demonstrates my true genius
and complete and total domination as an amoea-talking head.
But let us speak about some of the names who have been mentioned to replace me.
First, Bob Sheeper.
Nice enough man, but please.
He's got less hair than Madonna's armpits.
And everyone knows she can't conduct the train if you use Rogaine.
Another name that has been banied about is John Roberts, who currently anchors the Sunday CBS evening news.
There's a reason he's been on Sundays for so long.
Plus, he's Canadian.
And everyone knows when the camera light goes red, he can't be a hose head.
Then there's Scott Pelley from 60 Minutes.
He was the guy who helped me make up the story about President Bush.
I think.
Plus, he's skinnier than Kelly Ripper.
And everyone knows you have to have a meaty can if you want to be the man.
And let's go from the ridiculous to the sublime.
The frontrunner to succeed me seems to be current today show co-anchor Katie Kirk.
When I first heard her name in the same sentence as mine, I threw up in my mouth a little bit.
This person thinks real news is announcing the individual weight of each of J-Lo's butt cheeks.
Plus, her head's too small, her eyes are too close together, and she reeks of gene to take.
When charged with the awesome task of replacing an icon, it's important to remember.
You can't. You can only hope to find someone who is involved.
Canadian, skinny, or so completely self-centered, if you think her name should be part of the Pledge of Allegiance.
For now, this is Dan Rather signing off and reminding you, a whistle is to blow, a gong is to bang.
And Katie Kirk has about as much to offer the world as a fraud with pins and its extremities laying on a high school lab table.
This is Dan Rather.
Don't forget Dan, she did say Navy Seals Rock.
Remember that from Furnite 9-11?
That's right. Navy Seals Rock, some of that objective news reporting about the butchery, the savagery that we're committing and permitting.
Anyway, getting back to this story about Jerry Colitis, then that Cola Cola.
Careful.
No, that's his name. COLA, ITIS, Colitis.
Jerry Colitis was never the same after he wrenched his neck dodging a sizzling flying.
See him at Benihana, his widow testified yesterday in support of his $10 million suit against the restaurant chain.
Jack will and Colitis on the witness stand in State Supreme Court in Minneapolis, New York, said her husband 47 couldn't play with his sons or enjoy vacations after entering his neck in January 2001.
I was a little nervous about that. Couldn't play with his sons.
The old berkful resident began seeing doctors until finally having surgery to move a part of his vertebrae, she said.
He didn't do anything, Jack, when Colitis said, referring to family trips after the surgery. He would spend time in a hotel room.
Colitis widow 47 claims in her suit that Benihana is responsible for his death in November 2001 because he hyper-extended his neck while trying to avoid hot food being thrown negligently by a chef at the table in the Muncie Park restaurant.
Jerry Colitis suffered from numbness and motor control problems afterward, had surgery at NYU Medical Center in Manhattan, June 2001.
He suffered from a high fever two weeks later and had an exploratory procedure that revealed nothing.
But in November he returned to the hospital with kidney failure, a respiratory infection and septic shock, according to a hospital document read to the jury by Colitis attorney, Andrey Forensiou of Roslin.
Doctors couldn't determine the source of the infection the document said. Charles Connick of Minneapolis,
and the Ola, I wonder if he's related to Harry Jr., who couldn't sing his light of a paper song. Charles Connick of Minneapolis,
Benihana's attorney, contends the restaurant had nothing to do with the death, saying the infection was unrelated to his neck injury.
He noted Colitis had other chronic ailments such as Gout and probably Colitis.
Say, he got it wrong, you're not supposed to dodge the shrimp, you're supposed to catch it.
Dodge the Y? See him. You're supposed to watch? Catch it in your mouth.
There you go. That's the way to do it.
Doug Thompson, the rant, he is my man. He's our main man, campalhealblue.com, get there or be square.
I'm telling you right now, grab onto it and the website too.
How is MLHRs doing, by the way? And then movies on the way to you. I can't believe how Jen Welsow ain't like 17 bucks.
And the other one was only like six something.
The only reason it's that much is because it's last year's movie, it's two or two thousand four.
Are there no fun with chickens in this movie, is there? No. All right, good.
No, there's no muggboy or chicken munching in this one. Not a lot of pill munching.
And yeah, it's not exactly. All the people in this movie have one thing in common.
They all chew the drugs, they're telling you. They don't have time to wait for the water or the booze to wash it down.
They're such a hurry, they got to chew it. That's right, they'll tell you to it rush.
Yeah, put them in ecstasy at any rate.
Bush often met with praise, and let me say it again, Bush often met with and praise Rob Lobbyist.
New picture of Doug Thompson on the Randy looks about. I wonder what Throne Plyschman will tell us where the dog is really 87.
Although White House spokes lawyer Scott McClellan claims Lobbyist cooked the Georgia egg remoff only met with administration staff two or three times.
The scandal of an environment influenced enjoyed frequent private meetings with President George W. Bush.
Referred to Abraham office one of his administration's greatest friends in a town where money just like a Kenny boy, remember old Kenny lay.
Oh yeah, this is good buddy Kenny lay and then all of a sudden, oh, who that we don't know who that is.
In a town where money buys influence and access, it would have been a highly unusual thing for one of the top fundraisers for the Bush White House to not have had meetings with the president.
McClellan, a carefully word to response to report is yesterday, said his personal investigation into the matter revealed that Abraham may have had two private staff level meetings at the White House.
This is the same Scott McClellan who claimed the investigative of the Valerie Plainley can total reporters that neither vice president, changing or anyone on his staff had any involvement in that scandal.
Then, Cheney, Steve, a chief of staff, Scooter, Lubey got Lubey, got staff of the indictment for giving the info to the press.
McClellan is as skilled a liar as anyone who was stood before the press and misled reporters on behalf of a president.
Failed to mention, Abraham office frequent visits to the president's ranch in Crawford, Texas.
The private meetings that the lobbyist arranged for the president on the 2004 campaign trail and at the Republican National Convention that year.
White House visitor logs are not public record and the Bush administration keeps several logs of visitors to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,
and other locations like Camp David of the President's home.
In addition, logs can offer our revised when scandal erupts and you know what the water notes he says, don't mess with my log.
I was just don't, I'm sorry, don't, I'm sorry, don't, I'm sorry.
But Abraham office raised more than $100,000 for Bush in the last campaign, promised big time donors face time with the president delivered on those promises during the convention.
In addition, he traveled to Bush's ranch in Texas with his co-conspirator in crime, former House majority leader Tom Delay.
A former Delay staffer who is cooperating with the investigation into both Abraham office and the disgrace to U.P. leader's activities has told investigators that Abraham office and Delay visited Bush at his ranch on at least four occasions in 2003 and four.
It's common for big money contributors to get personal meetings with the president.
At the GOP's annual presidential dinner in Washington, those who pony up at least 25 grand are hustled into a room before the dinner for time and photo ops with the president.
Abraham office kept the photo of he and Bush out of the Crawford ranch in his office in Washington.
The autograph from Bush said to my great friend Jack.
Del Nally, a campaign work in the 2004 Bush Chaining Relection campaign, recalls a meeting between Bush and Abraham office and campaign stop in Florida.
He put his arm around Abraham office and told us that this man is one of the administration's greatest friends, Nally, recalls.
Nally declined to job in a Bush administration return to school after the election.
Remember some in the campaign, privately calling Abraham off a sleaze ball.
That campaign taught me that I never wanted anything to do with the Bush administration or politics again, Nally.
He said, no matter how many showers I took, I couldn't wash away the stench.
Oh, how do you like that?
Huh.
That a beautiful thing no matter how many showers he took no matter how much comic cleanser he couldn't wash away the stench.
Takes forever to get that taste and smell out of your sister.
Oh, yeah, really does.
Nice going Henry.
That's Henry Barrow who just turned the 85 of the community to do any flash minute just also turned the scale at 400 pounds.
For the last time we saw him, he looked like a monster in the news business.
Yes, he did.
Perfectly round.
This is not a guy that was ever out.
I wouldn't say he was slim.
But he was like, yeah, a little normal, a little pleasantly plump for a guy his age for an old fart like him.
And then we see him years later and he like like somebody stuck a bicycle pump up his ass and just pump them pumped like the crow would say when you're idle.
He's not my idol.
Oh, you mean Henry, I thought you were talking about the crow.
I would do like Eric I will a lot.
Money by fine.
Too bad that we don't have a lot more money Python fans.
I mean, there's a lot, but it should be a lot more than the only bridge with a sense of humor beside the course, the Queen mom and she's dead.
She had a great sense of humor for an old 50.
559.
Yeah, she'd say this old Queen would like you Queens downstairs to cut the crap and bring me a drink.
She was a real hoot and a snappy dresser.
For me, listening to Neil Rogers is a guilty pleasure because I'm none of the above 367.
Oh, thank goodness for that.
65.6% of the audience aren't bigoted old Farts or green tooth, whatever these are.
Cranky old Fart 40 employed by another radio station 26.20 say Sunday like that.
Gunhugger 23.

I'll pray for you.
Redneck 14.

You're making eight.
Oh my God.
I hope they find a good machine and go back where they came from in it.
Or a green tooth Cuban 8.
Nazi Civilizer 7.
Orthodox Jew 6.
And last but not least, Catlick, we got five Catlicks out there including, of course, your close
personal friend.
This is Neil Rogers.
Good luck, Dennis.
This is Fag No One.
She's a dance.
The Mackinac.
This is Joe Ball on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the Hockey
Authority, Neil God.
Bad pit.
You probably can't find anyone who hasn't heard that he's had quite a year.
The end of his marriage and the new co-star.
So let me try some of these questions.
All right.
Let's go.
Personal questions.
Yeah.
Why did your marriage end?
She...
A pretends cough, masking and expletive.
I'd do I need to go on.
Do you want more?
Yep.
She...
Boom, take.
And, uh, yes.
I mean, I should do better now.
Absolutely.
That was nice.
Did Angelina Chowly break up your mask?
Absolutely.
I mean, what is more exciting than that?
When the time times grand fit, the interview, Ritzers.
You know, I guess I'll let you skill that expression in the mole-myster.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Everybody and their brothers love.
Absolutely.
He left that for us anyway.
And he also left...
And as well.
13-till noon at 5-60.
No for you.
Curtis Stevenson for the departed mole man.
And I'm going to have to wean myself off of that, uh, the mole-myster and all that stuff.
No, no, no.
The lyrical creatures of habit.
You keep y'all for a few years now.
The mole man, it's you.
Well, no, no, no, no, man, dead.
Manchester, Pennsylvania.
It's behind a kitty-cats.
A cat interrupted a cat in that possibly saving two lives.
Uh, I don't believe a cat's heard, ever, than a box of rocks.
Jean Poole and her 9-month-old granddaughter were dozing to the Impulse Home in the New
Berries States Mobile Home Park in Manchester, Pennsylvania.
Poole's 7-year-old cat Princess woke them up, meowing loudly.
Yeah.
Loudly.
Hmm.
For an air-disgusting cat's, aren't they?
Oh, run.
What were you playing?
Let's try to get a meow-sound effect.
Oh.
Poole got up, smelled smoke, and her crackling flames.
Faaaamnng!
She went to check the wood-burning stove in the living room and saw flames at the picture window.
With fire blocking the front door, Poole grabbed the baby, went out the rear door.
She then returned to get Princess.
This reminds me of that story.
Now, where was it that the mother left the two kids, the eight and ten-year-old kids told me to go back to bed and the house was burning down, and I think she done it.
You see that?
No.
Didn't she do that?
No.
That's one of the most grotesque things I ever saw in my life.
I'll go back to bed, go back to bed, and then she calls, she's out in the yard, and the neighbor says, what's going on over there?
And, uh, anyway.
The cat woke me up.
I don't know if I'd smell the smoke otherwise, Poole said.
A right-in firefighter has found flames, flames were shooting through the roof.
Scott Glass, my assistant, achieved with a new bird-touching fire company.
Said the blaze apparently started accidentally, and trash can outside.
Ignited the underside of the mobile home, spread inside the sighting, and broke through the interior.
There's a scene in imaginary heroes where, uh,
Sigourney Weaver is going to the house of this, uh, punk that's beaten up or kid in school all the time.
And she goes in there in the, in their mobile home, in their trailer.
Right, of course.
And she goes storming in the trailer trash, fat pig of a mother sitting there on the couch, and she gives them a lecture, and her kid is like lurking in the, uh, side of the room.
And then when, and just before she walks out, she says, nice trailer.
Oh, a little party man.
Yeah, a little stuther, a little shot right, a nice trailer, trash.
Speaking of very important stories, Ann Arbor, Michigan, Michigan, speaking of, oh right.
Don't forget to imagine it's two to six starts, come around QAM, whether we like it or not.
What was that with the Humper thing, he would advise him against it.
I say, Nanya, Nanya business Hank, just, uh, butt out.
We're trying to get an award-winning line up here.
And especially when those numbers come out today, I don't feel real good about this book.
So why, because December, we usually get scrooged by Arbor Tron.
I'm not right.
But just about the city.
Yeah, they don't like this.
I guess that's because we're not the Christmas kind of people.
All the heathens on the show.
Well, it's Christmas time and even Chinooka time and he then bastards don't fit in the ambiance of the December so.
Scrooge.
Whatever number you got will divide by two and subtract six.
Especially two.
That's right.
And Arbor Meeshigin, a pair of recent University of Michigan graduates are each $5,000 richer for being the best of a national tournament involving a campus drinking game popular among many college students.
Jason Coban and Nick Velasari, so the champions of the World Series of Beer Pond, which took place earlier this month, their last wages.
The two beat out more than 160 other competitors, but the $10,000 grand prize.
Well, a lot of degenerates went up in Vegas, you know what?
Coincidence?
Beer Pond has played this way while standing players attempting to toss a ping pong ball into cups that are partially filled with beer at the end of the table.
If the players have seen their opponents are forced to drink the beer in the cup.
Got it?
It's like quarters.
Like that.
Like you with a ping pong ball in his neck.
Back to hockey player, remember that?
Right.
Beer Pond has made the transition from house party game to being featured event in bars that host tournaments.
Well, you talk about the boredom killing business just like this poker crap on TV.
I mean, thank goodness we're reading that finally that that's in its waning days just like the insurgency in Iraq.
Companies sell custom-designed beer pong tables.
Have you ever played this yash?
Of course.
Of course.
Yeah, they, you know, it's a big college game, you know.
Well, I swear I forgot your relash.
We used to play quarters in my day, but, you know, because we didn't have ping pong balls.
Didn't have balls?
No.
Companies sell custom-designed beer pong tables and related products.
They were merchandise or beer pong, paraphernalia, healthy world series of beer pong.
Quarters say the game encourages binge drinking.
All right.
But COVID and Vassal and Revvicellar say it's not about irresponsible drinking.
They say it's a good way to have time, a good time with friends.
It's like playing darts that have our COVID-til-the-and-arbor news.
COVID and Velocera's picked up the game several years ago.
COVID was a swimmer at Michigan and all the way, you know, about them.
And Vissalar was a wrestler and you really know about them.
And they got to know each other through the athletic community.
I thought a lot of showers together, no doubt.
Yeah.
Oh, man.
When they were old enough to go to bars, they brought the game with them and played among friends and the game too.
Eventually, they too began helping to organize weekly tournaments in Ann Arbor and Ipsalanti.
Ever been to Ipsalanti?
No.
Oh, man, you don't want to go there.
Do you know I worked a week at a radio station in Ipsalanti?
That's quite a story.
I'd take you something.
I got time.
At the National Tournament, COVID and Velocera's were sponsored by Campus Area Bar, the Brown Jug.
Not the little Brown Jug, just the big Brown Jug, which paid the $550 entry-free.
The bar's owner, Perry Pericose, agreed to put up the money.
He said, COVID and Velocera are regular customers who have found an app in a pinch at the bar.
The two paid their own airfare and plan to pay back Pericose and their winnings.
They also wore t-shirts for the bar's name during the competition.
And I was excited.
And Arbor, Michigan.
That's the kind of stuff they do up there in Michigan, man.
But you need generous.
Watch out.
Watch how they'll rot.
They'll have much better weed there than East Lansing.
I think it grows like wildfire.
Like weeds?
Like weed.
Groups fire.
I got a big pile of stuff here.
They got marine downers column, which it won't cost you a dime to read it, to hear it.
It's on our website for tomorrow, I believe.
And by the way, Josh wants to apologize for the late addition of those stories under this morning.
He was busy last night.
They were up there like a swift 920.
Like I said, Josh wants to apologize profusely for.
I apologize.
Groups fire lawsuits over Eve's dropping.
Two leading civil rights groups fire lawsuits here today against the Bush administration over its domestic spying process.
The two law suits of the first major court challenge just to the Eve's dropping program.
They were filed separately by the ACLU and federal district court in Detroit and by the Center for Constitutional Rights and Federal District Court in Manhattan.
Both groups are seeking to have the court's order and immediate end of the program, which the group says illegal and unconstitutional.

Do you know that 31 days from today
The cell phone numbers are being released to telemarketing companies
Great
It starts in one month
Yeah, to get on the no call list
The number is 888-382-1222
And it goes in effect in 31 days
And that number you'll be off the list for five years
So they can't call yourself on
Thanks for that
What's the number again to get on the no call?
It is 888-382-1222
Very simple little recording
Like one minute
And last you put in your cell phone number
And then you're done
And you have to wear your 2-2 when you make that caller
And they're not going to check it out
That's a lot pal, I appreciate it
888-382-1222
And that would be said I think I wrote that down wrong
I got 382-1222
It's for this data
888-382-1222
That's what the Bishop Desmond Tutu will be saying
I wonder what his cell phone number is
He's still alive Bishop Tutu

The way I have another word about that
Coming along just fine
Is it really?
Is Miguel on top of it?
Look at it's percolating
And just make sure he doesn't put some of the stuff on there
Like remember the woman was talking about that
And I'm sure that that was a set up call
About Condor Leaser
And that's a lot going on there
We'll be here and there is no mole
No, no
That's the last thing we need to start that simis all over
Because I'm sure that there's some people out there
Would a lot of idle time on their hands?
Oh, don't talk about that
Not the most suspicious of anything like that
They would love nothing mole
But into a certain whole pile of crap again
And I say, underline again
You know the fact that he was allowed to pull the stuff
And again, most of it was off the air
On the air was certainly an asting up
But that's on the air stick
But the stuff that went on behind the scenes was so grotesque and positively unbelievable
Or like, the label
That you'd probably any of you would fall off your chair right now
Wherever you'd be sitting at
Maureen Dowd writes looking for a Democratic tough guy or girl
And we sure like Maureen Dowd a lot
All of we should take line 9 first
It'll be fast
QAM hello
This is that
See what I mean?
Maureen writes that Democrats were throwing haymakers at the White House this way
But they'll never succeed as long as they're perceived as the party in skirts
Al Gore, John Kerry and Hillary Clinton called the Bush Administration on its apparently bottomless story of Imperial sins
They made a lot of good points
They just didn't score any
The trio apparently joking for 08
They're not the best messengers
They're loaded down with baggage
Two of them were going to stop W. Andec Cheney before they undid 230 years of American democracy
Didn't because they allowed themselves to be painted as girly men
The other a manly girl
She is so good
The other a manly girl has been so cautious and opportunistic about weighing in on everything from Shaivo to Lido and Iraq
That when she finally sang out on Monday and railed against W. She sounded more soprano than Baso Profundo
It was easy for the Republicans to play their usual gender games in this Miss the Three Democrats is
Wine-E Shrewline ineffectual
After Mr. Gore and Senator Clinton went on the attack, Scram McCullan rebutted
I think we know one tends to like or enjoy grabbing headlines
The other one sounds like the political season may be starting early
He rub Mr. Gore's nose in the fact that he's not the president fighting the terrorist noting
If he wants to be the voice for Democrats on this debate over national security, we welcome it
To lead and not just conduct campaigns that tear at the liberal elite's editorial pages
You have to shape your own identity in political destiny
And ever since the 2000 race the Democrats have let Republicans caricature them as a feminine
YOU FAIRY
The Democrats have let the GOP give them their shape and it's an hourglass
There are moments in campaigns in policy debates when it's possible to knock the sword out of your opponent's hand
Al Gore and John Kerry Wift, Mr. Kerry and Senator Clinton held the president's coat as he rushed to war
This all allowed the Bush East to use 9-11 as a shield and a bludgeon
They made their own rules and cast themselves as renegade heroes
If the Democrats are like the deserving desperate housewives, the Republicans have come across like the counterterrorism agent Jack Bauer on 24
Fast with a gun, loose with the law, willing to torture the name of protecting the nation, except Jack Bauer is competent
The Democrats chronic impotence led to the Republicans' reign of incompetence
U.S. News and World Report features a menacing dick-chainy looking like a man who just swallowed a country on the cover this week with a headline Tough Guy
The story recounts how Mr. Chainy is Bush's Bush-1's defense secretary
He write it lawmakers as a bunch of annoying gnats
Maybe that's why he doesn't feel the need to pay attention to the silly little laws they make
How many things do you have to mess up in the country in the world before you lose your reputation for muchismo?
Al Gore will be laterally perhaps made an uncharacteristically bold move
He made the completely valid point that the president of the United States has been breaking the law repeatedly and insistently
To ease drop on American citizens without a warrant in prison-American citizens on his own declaration, kidnapped and tortured, then what can he do?
He told an audience on Monday denouncing Bush's power grab
He warned Republicans that they should be wary of setting these extra legal precedents because someday it leader with values of importance of them could put all that power to use
Mr. Chainy lumbering around an unreality continues to be unapologetic as the course of Democratic complaints gets louder
Above the law is exactly where he wants to be even when he can easily and retroactively get snooping warrants
He doesn't want their stinking warrants warrants are for sissies
When the all gets through tenure, when we get all through ten years from now he told U.S. News, we'll look back at this period of time
and see that liberating 50 million people in Afghanistan and Iraq really did represent a major fundamental shift
Obviously in U.S. policy in terms of how we dealt with the emerging terrorist threat and it will also have fundamentally changed circumstances in that part of the world
Yeah, but not necessarily for the better
Whatever else you can say about the Bush crowd, they stick to their guns even when they can't shoot straight
That's more in doubt, that's hurt too since
Those girly men, those Democrats man
You know, Al Gore, he's the one, he's the one you can put most of the blame on even now he's talking big time, Mr. Big Shot
Finally put stuff after all this time, just look at that scene again in the
Al Dharadeh, drag the good things of the United States of America through the mud of Saddam Hussein, torture, prison
Yeah, just look at that scene in Fahrenheit 9-11 again when they black caucus, the different members keep getting up there, one after the other
And begging and pleading for one senator to come forward and sign a resolution, that he's been certifying the result of the fixed election in 2000
And there's Al Gore as vice president, he's presiding over the Senate and he's clanging the gavel and blowing them all off
Right then in there he handed the U.S. of A over the fascists, he just handed to him on a platter
Pimit all those other people that wouldn't stand up
Yeah, all the 100 signatures that he did were all 100 senators including Ted Kennedy
And John Kerry and Al Gore himself of course being the senator, he could assign it but then again it was seen self serving I guess
But nevertheless he could have done it and he should have done it
They argue, quizzling, you fairy, pathetic
Or speaking about pathetic politicians and there are so many, Ray Nogginhead and Louisiana New Orleans, man he isn't
Well we knew he was an idiot when we saw his behavior during Katrina right?
Well he was no doubt about it, but for a few minutes and then he went all bananas
Now he was an idiot, he was a simple one, he was the one that was telling him well go to the super dome and then go to the civic arena whatever it hell or arena was
And then they got there and nobody knew what that was going on
And then of course there was Brownie Brown, well he didn't know anything about it
He went ahead of a job, Ray, anyway Ray Noggin says he apologized for urging residents to rebuild a chocolate New Orleans saying you can't have New Orleans no other way
Not only is he incompetent, he's also illiterate
I apologize! I'm really sorry that some people took that the way they did and that was not my intention to mayor said I say everybody's welcome
But the darker the better
Nogginhead had that he never should have used the term chocolate across the hurricane Katrina Roberts City and by the way it's a toilet there
It's just unbelievable and when Bush was there a few days ago I remember that
They took him through the upscale, uh, 20-20 hoods and never got really much damage from the hurricane
And he never went anywhere near all like most of the scene that's like an outdoor toilet
He wouldn't go to that neighborhood before he wasn't going to go there now
That's for damn sure, not his kind
Across the hurricane Katrina Roberts City many voices displeasure with the mayor's money remarks
And Martin Luther King's junior day speech
One website even began peddling T-shirt showing Noggin with a top hat along with a caption
Really Noggin in the chocolate factory
Sorry Johnny Depp
Woo! I love that!
Resident Alice Gerho called Noggin's comments stupid and pitiful
He used the wrong dairy product to describe us
We're more neopolitan not chocolate, you're whole said
It doesn't do the city any kind of justice
I-Ishia Johnson says he doesn't think the mayor's comments were necessarily inflammatory just out of line
He should have chose his words more carefully, she said
How about like mocha would have been better
But some residents like Ann McKendrick were angered, pissed off and fired up
You can't reunite a city here, comments are going to divide a city, McKendrick said
His remarks fall into a line of inappropriate statements the mayor has made since civil
rest attorney Tracy Washington
She said she's true trying to figure out what the mayor's going to say on off the cuff any given day
He's an idiot this morning
Let's see, here it says
Are you sure it is wise to send a private cell phone to a 1-800 number?
Could be a way for some scanner to capture about 50 million numbers
I-I don't know, I'm not getting involved
So whatever that's all about, that was the call of this because we had nothing to do with it, right?
I'm going to wait and see
Yeah wait and see, I'm sure that some legal vehicle out there, some maven will advise us on that
Remember, remember we had a call for the regular house phones, right?
The no call for on social media, they do any good?
No, because if you do any business like with a credit card company or a bank or a horror house, whatever might be massage parlor
Then they got a right to call you
And those are the ones that call you anyway most of the time, not out of ten times
And those boiler rooms, they still call you, they don't care about the law, I mean they're going to scam you anyway
Exactly, but they're here today and gone on a few days anyway
By the time they find out where the calls are coming from, there's an empty row room room and they're long gone
1213 at 560 WQAM where we got the Curtis Stevenson debut on, well we don't know what's going on, 2 to 4 today

From 19 and 566-225, I'm just finishing up a story here, look at this, 2000 and 2MWD Uranium Cell
Plan, huh?
Why I just mentioned that in passing?
I mean, what did that Joe Wilson know anyway and that the Valerie claimed the plane game?
How come I'm not here to know more about that?
Shut up, Coddy, I'm sorry.
Or I know more about Jack Abramov and all of those things, then I'll know about the Duke
cutting and the Duke.
Now when you think of the British, what do you think about in terms of teeth?
Oh, uh, bad?
Yes.
Why is it that the Brits have such bad teeth?
Maybe because of their diet, because of that bad cuisine that they eat.
See that their genes are their hygiene.
Too much toad in the hole if you asked me, but anyway, this story from the BBC will really send you.
Dennis led partner, drill teeth, a dentist from Southeast London who led her unqualified boyfriend,
treat patients has been struck off.
I don't know what that means.
If you could see the pictures of these two, yeah, the teeth, it makes the word, no, they're not the smile and they're both the moon.
Meas, uh, Pamela and Winston-Movians, they're so grotesque.
Mojjan Azarai followed her lover Ahmed Amidi Mazarai to work on more, allowed her, uh,
the names have thrown me, allowed her a lover to work on more than 600 patients, leaving many an agony.
He drilled out cavity, that's kind of like a human dentist in South Florida, isn't it?
Right, license is optional.
Right.
And doctors, he drilled out cavities without local anesthetic and plastic surgeons and installed expensive fillings that crumbled within days.
He drilled out cavities without local anesthetic.
The pair charged the NHS for the bundle working on the non-existent procedures and her beliefs were made 120,000 pounds,
it's almost the quarter of a million dollars from the scam.
Azarai 39, a Swedish Iranian, was barred from practicing in the UK by the General Dental Council for a serious professional misconduct.
She ran dental practices in Norbury and Tulsa Hills, South London, where she employed her partner a dental tap tech between 2002 and 2003.
While he was around, he let her do a lot more business, I guess.
In March 2005, Azarai from Beckenham Kent was jailed for 12 months by Southward Crown Court after pleading guilty to obtaining money by deception.
Amidi Mazarai 42, an Iranian national and a real grotesque look and creature from East Dolwich, Southeast London, received a two-year sentence after winning similar offenses.
The GDC considered claims that Azarai did not take any eradicative steps and said that Amidi Mazarai was a qualified dentist.
It was the last year that allowed him to continue treating patients, despite promising the Croydon Primary Care Trust in 2003 he would stop.
I like that.
I think it's nitpicking though, you know local anesthetic, expensive things that are crumbled in a few days.
I think, you know, maybe Amidi dentist.
I got a good dentist here though now, now I need to find a good doctor.
Because you know I'm getting ready for that big day.
For that guy out there who is hobbyist, they're going to people's funeral.
I have no life.
Man, some of these people are just really scary, isn't it?
Yeah.
Oh boy.
I mean all you got to do is listen for 10 minutes or more when we're taking a close-in show.
That tells you all you need to know about South Florida, about America, about the human race, about the future of this planet, right there.
Let's take some of these really important calls now.
Oh, not having any.
That's because I was threatening, you know.
I go on these rampages, sir, what, no, let's have you do these stuff.
And of course always at your urging, by the way.
That's right.
How do you threaten me?
56670560, pound 560 for rising in singular wireless line.
There's now one person in this audience that saw primal, no one guy saw primal fear.
And certainly not imaginary heroes.
It would never admit that.
And that was just 2004, that's a relatively new flick just a year and a half ago.
Come in to QA and Movie Line.
Hello.
QA and?
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Hi, Neil.
I got to blow my nose.
Goodbye.
Go right ahead.
OK, blow this.
56670560, pound 566 in the Verizon singular wireless line.
WDQAM, hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
And history action is very good, by the way.
OK.
My question is, are you taking so core?
Or no.
Absolutely not.
I wouldn't take any of those drugs if you paid me by the pill.
Plot it.
That's what I have.
OK, so let's plan this.
Let's cut it to Zopor.
Zopor is a cholesterol.
It's a statin drug, man.
OK, so don't even do it.
I'm not listening to my doctor.
You're asking me why you're hiding your cholesterol.
How high is your cholesterol?
I'm on my spot on my wife.
Oh, well, how high is your cholesterol?
I don't know what's the number you're in there.
Well, two say it could be like 210 or could be 290.
I mean, there's a big difference.
Sorry, 250.
Is that so?
Is it 250?
No, I think it's 135, I actually like that.
I can do this for if your wife's cholesterol is 135, then find a nice pine box, OK?
Under 140 without taking any medication, under 140 is considered like the death line for cholesterol.
I mean, what would I know about any of these things, though?
That's right.
I'll tell you what I do know is I wouldn't take those statin drugs.
I'm not giving any advice.
You do whatever you want.
I'll tell you whatever your doctor tells you.
Always trust your doctor.
That's right.
Right.
If you can find one.
Find a real one in Florida.
But nevertheless, the statin drugs are killers.
And it much more, unless you're like extremely obese in your cholesterol is really way up there.
And your LDL is really, and a lot of the stuff that I read, of course, from people who are like, you know, quacks.
They say the LDL cholesterol doesn't make all that much difference.
Unless it's really like over 200, really grotesque.
That it's a low HDL and high triglycerides.
That's the, why are you talking about this?
Because that last guy's succumbing to it.
That's right.
High triglycerides.
High triglycerides.
High triglycerides.
That can get triglycerides will be nice and low.
Or if you do balance for life and don't eat that bobbin-noosh.
WNQIM, hello.
Can I have me on the radio?
WNQIM, hello.

There's a skit you play with a lady who's driving and she's about to say it.
If I can say if I've heard in a back...
Yeah.

Do you, is that on one of your best of NEOCDs?
No, maybe I'll put that on the...

It's a contender.
It's a...
Yeah.
I haven't heard it in a while.
This is a classic.
Okay.
We'll give it some consideration.
It's in the running.
It's in the silent running.
You're going to put that on there?
Sure.
We'll do it.
I was not on one before.
To be our third.
I think it was, but you know how that goes.
Oh, boy.
The long arm of the law.

Well, perhaps you saw what focused on this selling, isn't it?
The footage will be which you read.
the flesh.
And many parts of the Muslim world, especially where folks are poor and uneducated, the
local Imam is the person many turn to for guidance on matters relating to sex and marriage.
Or at least, that makes more sense than the Catholics, because at least these people
are doing it a lot.
Right?
Over the last few years, hundreds of Islamic thought-while websites have also sprung up on
which clerics often with the uncertain qualifications answer all manner of questions that have been
sent to them by email, including questions about sex.
Some of the rancions about what good Muslim should or shouldn't do in bed are very explicit,
so readers under 18 should stop.
Here it says, while some of the advice is sensible, a lot of it is completely daft.
So remaining readers over the age of 18, they wish to get a second opinion before putting
it into practice.
Actually, it never occurred to me that Muslims might be required to keep their clothes
on during their most intimate moments until a few months ago when I was browsing through
Islam online, the website supervised by the prominent and controversial Qatar-based cleric,
Usaf al-Karadawi.
Delivering a thought-worn oral sex, a seminar in the Royal Doctor of Qatar, we describe
that as a disgusting Western practice, resulting from Westerners' hampative stripping naked
during sexual intercourse, but it continues, Muslim jurists are of the opinion that its
lawful for the husband of form coming to his wife, or a wife to perform a similar
act for her husband, a falatio, and there's no wrong in doing so.
But, if it leads to releasing semen, then it is blameworthy.
But there is no device of evidence, the size of evidence to forbid it, especially if
the wife agrees with it, or achieves orgasm by practicing it.
On this issue, Dr. Karadawi's views are more permissive than those of several other clerics
on the internet.
One states that oral sexes definitely have been, in a very potent, adding that this hideous
practice will draw the angel of the anger of Allah.
Another ask if oral sex is permitted replies, I don't know what it is, oral sex please
define it.
Nascedrubation is generally frowned upon by Islamic scholars, although they disagree about
how sinful it is, the Inter-Islam website describes it as an indecent practice that is
kept under the youngsters of today.
Nascedrubation has become prevalent on the website since because of the modern tendency
for young people to marry later, contrary to the advice of the prophet.
As a result, they feel and need to fulfill their carnal desires, but cannot do so in the
normal way, i.e. sexual intercourse, Islamic voices, tribes, masturbations, and a vulnerable
and wicked act, which is forbidden in Islam.
It harms our great, and it has a disastrous consequences, as established by doctors, not
to mention all that hair that grows on the palms of your hands.
Right.
I think I'm going to continue with this, so where I left off the university, is it really
fascinating or does it not be a perverted and disgusting?
I thought they had to do all their work under the university.
What about the Mormons?
Don't they have to keep that magic underwear on and just do like a little hole in their
side all times?
It has a flat.
That's why they call it holy underwear.
It has a flat.
It has a flat?
Or you know like the regular fluid of the looms?
I see.
Some other words if you have a spat, clothing to flat.

To to to to.
He's up funding for their levies.
Looters call thing and our key.
In a loop we made a bigger deal.
In search for Natalie Holloway.
For one white girl we trained a late.
And even asked for help from the Navy Seals.
George Bush was vacationing in Crawford.
I guess next year there'll be no Marty Grom.
Girls gone wild needs the city of New Orleans.
Or they'll have tears and their film crew to throw it up.
Oh my God.
Jason you're on QAM.
We don't have any national guards there because they're all fighting a war in Iraq right now.
Not the National Guard.
Pardon?
Not the National Guard.
No National Guard in Iraq.
No national guard.
No, of course not.
14 to 1 730 votes on a poll so far.
For me listening to the O'Rourke is a guilty pleasure because.
None of the above 478 65 and a half percent are not like fringe or humans.
But cranky old fart 46.
Hawkes Republican.
But third man.
Wow that's shocking.
I guess they're trying to monitor what the other side is saying.
Shriken hawkish of course.
No doubt.

Orthodox Jew 9.
And Jamaican 8 Mon.
Only 8 Jamaicans so far.
Of course if you multiply these.
Well what would you say the fraction like I multiply 10 to 1000?
We got 8000 Jamaicans.
75 million not Cubans.
Oh yeah.
Anyway getting back to this Muslim.
I'm not going to read the whole thing.
The whole article will be on our website tomorrow.
If Josh gets around to doing it.
Well I don't want to get in the part about that.
I'm not going to give that.
The proven medical effects of masturbation which of course include damage to the eyesight
according to the Muslims.
We're once listed by Abid Al Aziz bin Zaz bin Vaz.
The late grand musty of Saudi Arabia.
Remember the grand musty?
Okay.
And his list is reproduced on numerous Islamic websites.
According to bin Maz, masturbation causes disruption of the digestive system.
Information of the testicles.
Damage to the spine.
The place from which sperm originates.
And trembling and instability in some parts of the body like the feet.
In addition as the weakening of the cerebral gland leading to the increased intellect and even
mental disorders and insanity.
Furthermore, due to constant ejaculation, the sperm no more remains thick and dense as it normally
occurs in males.
This results in sperm which is not mighty enough to make a woman pregnant or produces children
who are more prone to disease than illness.
That's what George was thinking.
I can tell he looked like.
No that's wrong.
Other scholars argue that masturbation is basically forbidden but may be permitted if
the person is unmarried or masturbation would be a more serious sin such as adultery or
if the masturbation is to release sexual tension rather than to fulfill sexual desire.
In a fought law for Islam online, sheik Mustafa Al Zarka says, I conclude that the general
principles of sharia law go against this habit because it is not the normal way of fulfilling
sexual desire.
It is a deviation and that's enough to condemn it.
Even though this act is not formed with the category of absolute prohibition and by a way
if your ear reaches don't scratch that either.
There is generally more consensus among scholars on the question of kissing.
Males and females should not kiss unless they are related by blood or marriage.
I got that.
And they will just go for the good stuff.
Strengths, same sex kissing on their other hand is allowed as long as it is done without
lust and avoids the person's mouth.
Oh my god, can you imagine those Muslim sissy's head on the lips?
But no, we.
Hands and cheeks are well.
And holding hands though is good.
Notice all the Saudis every time they come bandar, bush neck red, they are always holding
a bush's hand.
And I want to make sure they can keep it out of their pocket.
Hands and cheeks are the third place to kiss.
Cheeks.
Correct them.
Before it is also good because the Prophet reportedly wants to give a man a smacker
between the eyes.
I see.
In this context, the ethics of, I wonder what I either talking about.
In this context, the ethics of kiss and life resuscitation are considered by Islam online.
The website quote, st.
Offmahed Muhammad Khanah, what is his name is K9, head of the infection diseases department
of the primary medical care administrator in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia.
The kiss of life is legally permissible because it means a resuscitation if all our wills.
In a coast without saying it is permissible unless absolutely necessary.
So if it is certain the victim has already died, mouth to mouth resuscitation becomes
impermissible for there is no need in such a case.
But what is wrong with kissing the dead a stiff?
What I am administering the kiss of life is Islam online as rescuers should be careful
to do it.
It needs to be lost nor with pleasure nor with doing it.
But grimace is a lot like, what do they have for lunch?
Finances is a lot more and has to do with the little sex but I am not going to.
I am not getting deeply into that.
Probably this reason.
There you go.
There you go.
Hold a bunch of stuff.
All these crazy religious men, what are my tone?
So phony.
And so the year is 2006, 2006 and they are still hawkiness and insanity.
This madness.
This is evil.
This is forbidden and this is lustful and this is a sick and this is twisted and you
are going to go, I hair on a poms of your neck and the, oh jeez.
Man.
You know what a song that is banned by the way in Saudi Arabia.
I love you a bushel and a peck.
That is the outlaw.
The bushel part is okay.
What year is that?
Before you were born.
I am sure.
Ask a chicken I killed.
In fact, maybe snookie Lancel will sing it for you and you will hit parod next time.
This American idol stuff, I don't know about you but it is going to be parked off.
What is this going to stop already?
It is done.
It is just demolishing everything and it is awake.
Everybody in their brothers all the time.
And Paula Abdul didn't show up.
No, he knows something good for who.
Who cares?
It is like that who wants to be a millionaire.
Right.
Let's put it on 75 times a week.
If it is a hit now, if it is time once a week is a hit, when you put it on 75, it is like
WSUN.
They like Neil show.
Let's play it 10 times a day.
If once is good, 10 times a day will be really great.
When it is down, let's burn it out.
Let's not go back to that SUN thing.
I will have to read Blabo's blog today.
Which I do every day by the way religiously.
Study or speaking of health.
I mentioned this yesterday but I never really got into it.
There are people out there that want to stay alive and it is not easy to understand
believe me and talk about all of us.
But then stick into it for you.
Very difficult.
Especially when you go into a story and you are not even looking for it, you see that
banana ice cream staring in the face of the hangar.
Oh geez.
You know what I am saying?
What he said.
And then when John Jira sends you some stupid as milk or candy in the mail.
He can make a joke out of it all he wants.
He wasn't.
He was a sincerely apologizing.
No, he was not.
He was.
He was crying.
He barely was.
He was like all red in the face.
He was always in the face.
He was writing his hands.
Are all Nazis all red in the face?
Well think about it.
Hermann Gehring he was always red in the face.
In his fingernails too.
In Rumsfeld.
The same difference.
How come if people watched the Fahrenheit 9-11 we didn't have it like a revolution in
this country.
It was not again last night and every time it's not I can't turn it off.
Well you don't know the last drawings of our credit leadership we have.
Is that what it is?
I mean how is that possible that people could watch that or not be forced to watch it and
just say well wait a minute how can you how can you be killing all these people.
All this bloodshed and murder and mayhem.
Every single day.
Oh and everybody's been reduced to a number.
Americans, Brits, Iraqis anybody.
Oh 1735 today 150 that one day and it's it's just numbers on a page somewhere.
What kind of a freaking world is it when nobody has any when human life means nothing just
like those punks in for Lauderdale with baseball bats in golf clubs killing a
beating the crap out of and killing homeless people.
Man I'm telling you right now they ought to put them on a new news with Angela Ray and
she can laugh her ass off while they're getting their heads chopped off what do you say?
All right.
Let her just laugh her ass off.
Yeah yeah yeah.
Like that.
We can't handle that silly person.
He kind of went up to the 73 that's what Joni Fleischman said.
Joni Fleischman my ass boy.
See he's been around the market too long as he he knows all these old hangars on like
Joni Fleischman and oh god.
You know I'm talking about all your old troll and Jim is Sarni old toad.
Sarni by the way, mostly Mohawar David and the finale I guess maybe he'll have to
write until Friday when he writes about it.
God forbid he's here right a second calm.
They probably have to pay him for it.
And Jika God forbid he should write about local radio because he's off in California
getting wind and died and roasted and toasted.
He boasted lightly.
Yeah what a jerk.
Well I didn't see anyone thinking about see the new deal with our new general manager
Joe Bell.
I'm I'm I'm only assuming this but you can feel the vibrations of it.
That's because a lot of people are scared.
This year.
And as opposed to just having a whole bunch of people show up every day and I'm
talking about everybody we have some folks who work hard try to do their job but there
are a whole bunch of other people who have been like charity cases just floating their
way through life waiting for twice a month to get a paycheck and as opposed to that
Greg weed mentality very much is like faking their way through actually now there's an
attempt to try to like do something a little bit better like actually do a job.
I know that's a frightening concept.
Be afraid.
I wish you had someone to overdo it here but some of you lung cancer back there in sales
your excuses ain't going to be cut no more you know I'm saying no more.
That's right no more.
How could you miss that Jim Sarni you idiot you silly old
goofball that's what he is a goofball.
You know the definition of a goofball.
One of those things you can't define it but you know when you see one I say it's like
that pornography thing with Warren Burger.
I don't know how to define a goofball but ball when I say like last night on Wheel of
Fortune there was a kid let's see these were college students and last night there was
a kid from Iowa State and he was a goofball.
They looked too bad and he didn't say much of getting nine grand all of a sudden lost
to the dark and collected Oklahoma chick who got the she got the I wanted the you know
the at the end of the thing okay whatever that you wait she won 25 grand if you know the
show but he was a goofball.
I can't tell you exactly what that means but if you see a goofball you'll know yeah let's
see the liberty have some some goofball seminars pretty soon.
12.56 my god is it almost one o'clock already I think I'm taking the one and two hour off
don't do it.
Taking a nap slacker.
Well if mad dog can do like four to seven days before to six thirty and he's making big
bucks and he works about seven days a year two to six baby two to six starts tomorrow.
If I'm Joe Bell I go in here this afternoon I tell the mad dog listen see you tomorrow.
We'll work we'll negotiate the terms of the deal you know whatever you want right you
have to suck that's right it sure I mean you know with all to be spent and then Curtis
can do like six till eight or whatever and of course a lot of ball games in there but
you know he had good good scheme going with that we intense a good idea right it's a great
idea mad dog that's what we need to stop right now good and mad dog in the juice well
he got there juice over there on the other stage across the street we didn't get our juice
and the toast.

A very low calorie diet can help the heart age more slowly according to researchers who release what they call the first ever human study on the subject.
We've heard this before and then of course there's some people who take it to a you know to a the ultimate degree like eating water,
or a little bit of water.
The findings confirmed earlier studies on mice and rats that demonstrate the cardiac benefits of a restricted calorie diet.
Please pass on to Boba Ghanouche.
The study looked at the heart function of 25 members of the caloric restriction society.
I bet you didn't even know there was a caloric restriction society.
Wow.
Ages 41 to 64 who consumed 4 oh I'm still early under the radar on that who consumed 1400 to 2000 officially bounds calories per day.
They were compared to 25 people who ate a typical western diet consuming 2 to 3000 daily calories on average.
The result?
Those limiting caloric intake had a heart functions of much younger people typically about 15 years younger than the rage.
Ultrasound exam showed group members that hearts that appeared more elastic than most people the rage not spastic for the rascal.
Their hearts were also able to relax between beats in a way similar to hearts in younger people.
You relax between beats.
This is the first day to demonstrate that long term calorie restriction with optimal nutrition has cardiac specific effects that delay or reverse age associated to clients in heart function said Luigi Fontana.
Lead author and assistant professor of medicine at Washington University in San Luis.
Luigi Fontana.
What if he's keen to weigh in Fontana in the mind vendors and a groovy kind of love?
The study will be published next Tuesday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.
Fontana said, no I guess it was published yesterday.
The articles from one of the book.
What number was? A couple days ago.
Fontana said, simply consuming this food is not the answer.
Members of the study group eat food resembling a traditional Mediterranean diet focusing on vegetables, olive oil, beans, whole grains, fish and fruita.
Got it?
Got it.
We like vegetables?
No.
Olive oil, okay but not look out of the bottle.
Beans, fat, whole grains, all carbs bad, fish, food and fruit, fruita, all carbs.
I must maybe like strawberries.
Call up hungry bogey.
I see we can get some of them strawberries.
See I counted the strawberries before I went to bed.
That was such a good movie.
I guess Dr. Stavrosau came you with me right?
I have not.
No, he would like to.
I would eat.
Did you think he'd enjoy that?
I think he would.
It's my little stain.
Black and white and hungry bogey and all that.
Oh no.
No.
No? It's all right. It's safe.
No, no.
I don't see what you did.
Now my cast of blankets, not that kind of movie.
It's a war movie.
I understand it.
I told George this either way.
I would talk about that.
It really needs to be extraordinary if it's a black and white film.
It is.
It is.
Okay.
Would I recommend a black and white film if we were not extraordinary?
No.
What do you know about?
I was black and white.
I would recommend Fenn the first place beside that one.
I don't know.
I don't know if it wasn't black and white.
That work was not in black and white.
I know I just said.
I think cycle was black and white.
Wasn't it?
Yeah.
I thought it had to be but it was.
But it was.
Now let me ask you this question.
Was cycle a bad movie?
No.
It was great, wasn't it?
I like it.
I like another black and white movie.
I like the hustler.
That was a good one.
Yeah.
Paul Newman.
That's it.
I don't think that's the best.
Fenn Chanke-Golissie.
He never thought the day the Earth stood still though.
It's still working on that for him.
That's a good movie.
You would like that.
Yeah, but I'm done.
I don't know.
I'm going to say that again.

can reduce risk, the studies suggest that caloric restriction combined with optimal nutrition
can do even more.
Can do even more.
You ready to reach for the yogurt now?
We're letting him in, of course, no sugar.
Fontanus, at most participants in the study, had immediate relatives who suffer heart attacks
or strokes, so it was unlikely that their genetic makeup was a contributing factor that
they're unusually healthy hearts.
We don't know how long each individual will end up living with.
They certainly have a longer life expectancy than average because they're most likely
not going to die from a heart attack stroke or diabetes that Professor John Holtz, who
worked on the study.
And if in fact their hearts are aging more slowly, it's conceivable to live for a very,
very long time.
Jony Fleischman can put it in a herald, makes you pimp it go, but it was on a 800 calorie

And I'm sure she will put that in, just to be a bitch.
Jony Fleischman, my ass.
5.6705.60, 70 old hacks in that town, my god, it's just embarrassing to me.
In order I got out, are we going to make 800 votes on a pool today?
If you push.
Yeah, we didn't push yesterday, we could easily made the 1000 today.
Well, you want to know why?
Why?
Because most of the people don't fall in these categories, they're not going to waste their
10 vote in number above, you know, it's just not for them.
So I think that if we get over 800 here, that's a feather in your cramp.
Hey, chicken says that the K and Mutiny was in Technicolor.
Who says?
Chicken neck.
It was in color?
What I said, I said it was.
I don't recall.
Yeah, I know something it was because Robert Francis was in it and he had nice rosy cheeks.
And he died.
Geez, how come all they're really, how looking guys die?
Everybody does.
Well, I'm saying Robert Francis, my god, he was even better looking than Arlene Francis.
Francis for a cop-out.
And then who is the other one from all fall down, Brandon to Wilda?
There you go.
How is my hero?
And now my new hero, I probably shouldn't say it because then what's his name is going
to die too?
See how soon they forget?
You'll get them?
No, a herch.
Emile, her.
Sunny herch.
You know who Emile, now you, did you, were you panning that movie the, the, the, the,

What about you?
I told you, I've bailed out in the middle of it when it started to get a little bit gay.
You know, so I just, I think I'm a little bit gay.
Well, when the guys weren't addressing the other guys chasing him around.
Oh, that was the movie.
He was wearing the dress right.
That was a movie, though.
That was, it was a good movie at this point.
And then daddy got all the way down there.
And of course in the end, well, I, I hope that everything came out all right for the end

How many diaries could they got back from the whole market in November?
People were like trying to get a swim back to their house and put their lives back together and get the tree off the roof and all of these things
They don't put a diary out they can't charge you right or ratings
Well, no, but they just could have eliminated that one month. They don't charge you by the trend
They charge you to subscribe for the books. Well, that's a good point. Yeah

I don't really have a great anyway Paul Craig Roberts says bushes cross the Rubicon
On his this website anti-war.com
Detailership seldom appear full fledged, but emerged piecemeal when Julia Caesar crossed the Rubicon with one Roman Legion
He wrote the tradition that protected the civilian government from victorious generals and lost the transformation of the
Roman Republican to the Roman Empire the Roman Empire
Fearing that Caesar would become a king in the Senate assassinated him from the Civil Wars that followed Caesar's grand nephew Octavian emerges
The first Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus
2000 years later in Germany, Adolf Hitler's rise to dictator from his appointment as chancellor was rapid
Hitler used the rush stock fire to create an atmosphere of crisis
Both the judicial and legislative branches of government collapse and Hitler's decrees became law
The decree for the protection of the people on state believer suspended guarantees of personal liberty and permitted arrest and incarceration without trial
The enabling act transferred legislative power to Hitler preventing him to decree laws
Laws moreover that may deviate from the Constitution
Speaking of deviates
The dictatorship of the Roman Emperor was not based on ideology
The Nazis had an avialgeous source, but Hitler's dictatorship was largely personal and agenda-based
He had an agenda
All it sounds like John Gerruss is in the room
The dictatorship that emerged from the Bolshevik resolution was based in ideology
Letting declared that the Communist Party's dictatorship over the Russian people
Ratched directly on force not limited by anything that restricted by any laws or any absolute rules
Stalin's dictatorship over the Communist Party was based on coercion alone on restrained by any limitations or inhibitions
In this first decade of the 21st century the United States regards itself as a landed democracy and civil liberty
But in fact is an insimpia dictatorship
An ideology plays only a limited role in the emerging dictatorship
The demise of American democracy is largely the result of historical developments
Lincoln was the first American tyrant
Lincoln justified his tyranny and name of preserving the union
His extra legal extra constitutional methods were tolerated in order to suppress
Northern opposition to Lincoln's war against the Southern secession
The first major lasting assault on the U.S. Constitution's separation of powers
Which is the basis for our political system came with a response of the Roosevelt's administration
The crisis of the Great Depression
The new deal resulted in Congress delegating its legislative power to the executive branch
Today when Congress passes a statute
It's a little more than an authorization for the executive agency to make the law
By writing the regulations that implemented
Prior to the new deal legislation was tightly written to minimize any executive branch interpretation
Only in this way can law be accountable to the people
If the executive branch that enforces the law also writes the law
All legislative powers are no longer vested in elected representatives in Congress
The Constitution is violated and the separation of powers is breached
The principle that power delegated to Congress by the people cannot be delegated
Congress by the executive branch is the main state of our political system
Until President Roosevelt overturned this principle by threatening to practice the Supreme Court
The executive branch had no role in interpreting the law
As Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote that Congress cannot delegate legislative power to the president
Is a principle universally recognized as vital to the integrity and maintenance of the system of government
Or deemed by the Constitution
Oh, let's add it's a piece of paper, you know
Despite seven decades of an imperial presidency that's risen from the new deals breached of these separation of powers
Republican attorneys who constitute the membership of the quarter century old federalist society
The candidate group for Republican nominees to federal judgeships
Write tracks about the imperial congress and the imperial judiciary that are breached for concentrating more power in the executive
Federalist society members pretend that congress and judiciary have stolen all the power and run away with it
The Republican interest in strengthening executive power has its origin agenda frustration from the constraints
Place them Republican administrations by democratic congresses
The thrust to enlarge the president's power predates the Bush administration
But is being furthered with a dangerous extent during the Bush's second term
The confirmation of Bush's nominee Samuel Alito
I remember the federalist society to this supreme court will provide five votes in favor of enlarged presidential powers
President Bush has used signing statements hundreds of times to vitiate the meaning of statues passed by congress
And in fact Bush is vetoing the bills he signs in law by asserting unilateral authorities commander in chief
The bypass or several side-to-law's he signs
For example, Bush has asserted that he's got the power to ignore the mechanon amendment against torture
To ignore the law that requires a warrant to spy on Americans to ignore the prohibition against indefinite detention with our
Charges or trial and to ignore the Geneva conventions to which the west is a signatory
In effect Bush is asserting the powers that accrued the Hitler in 1933
His federalist society aologist and the Department of Justice appointees claim that
President Bush has the same power to interpret the constitution as a supreme court
And Alito court is likely to agree with this false claim
Bush justice department official and Berkeley law professor John U
argues that no law can restrict the president's role as commander in chief
Thus once the president is at war even a vague open-ended war on terror
Bush is justice department says the president is free to undertake any action for suit of war
Including the torture of children and the indefinite detention of American citizens
The commander in chief rule is probably sufficiently elastic to expand to any crisis
Whether real or fabricated thus has the US arrived at the verge of dictatorship
This development has little to do with Bush who's unlikely to be aware that the constitution is experiencing its final
Rending on his watch
America's decented dictatorship as a result of historical developments and oral political battles
Did impact in Nixon being driven from office by democratic congress
There is today no constitutional party
Both political parties most constitutional lawyers and the bar associations are willing to set aside the constitution whenever it interferes with their agendas
The agenda
Americans have forgotten the prerequisites for freedom and those pursuing power for God and what it means when it falls into other hands
Americans are very close to losing their constitutional system and civil liberties
It is paradoxical that American democracy is the likely casualty of a war on terror
That's being justified than any of the expansion of democracy. How do you like that?
I have absolutely correct
Yeah
Got his son right on it baby
Now what's the constitution just a piece of paper anyway?
He's a war man. It's a wartime president. He's always thinking about war
Like a war in the brain
Yeah

Iran banned oh we lost the hipster
Iran banned CNN from working in the country due to its mis-translation of comments made by president
I have no idea how you say his name and a recent news conference
I love the way that's thrown his name around for sure how they can pronounce it
President Machmoud
Crazy bastard the indefinite ban announced money and the state run television highlighted the continuing tension between Iran and the west over to
Iran's nuclear program where is that nuclear?
In remarks that today the president Bulbler has defended Iran's right to continue nuclear research
State media have complained since the news conference that CNN translated his words as nuclear weapons and instead of nuclear technology or nuclear energy
Due to mis-translation of the words of the president
Mothmoudyab during his press conference activities in the American CNN and Tehran are banned
Until further notice set a culture in Islamic guidance ministry statement read on state run TV

Since when is gang raping?
What did you require of me?
I require you to drop your bed.
I'm not see here right now.
How about a little bed?
Drop it up, we're under it.
You like it, baby?
Get your hands up.
Get out of there.

Steps like a rat.
Don't touch my delicate substance.
I just want you to be ready.
You want to raise me.

Boom.

What are you some kind of fairy?
I'm having a good sleep.
What do you know about being queer, you moron?
I've been right to nothing or the difference.
We're supposed to be spoken about sports here.
This is sports radio over here.
We love men.
What's this point on?
I don't care.
To get paid by the toy.
I'm not going to make something out of this crazy paper.
You understand?
Then maybe later I'll pull the link sauce if you're out of my pants, okay?
It's a joke, you moron.
Oh no.
There's portions of my pants.
Oh, you're saying, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
How can it help you?
Maybe you see what I'm here?
I keep getting raped.
I can do it right away.
Thanks a lot.
Some time, some time.
I'm putting it down.
Drop your pants.
I said drop your pants.
That's a formal candle.
It just something to do while you're watching golf.
My good.
Pouring the hot liquid in your eye.
I like this.
Ah!
I like it.
No, I like it.
No, I like it.
Oh, I like it.
I like what you made me do.
Kind of.
Your pants are not pin-wise.
You want to work my show?
You do as you told me.
Now get over here.
Man, that's right.
Now, come here.
Now, get over there.
Come here.
Now, come here.
How about you?
Not there.

No, I did not steal those pizza.
Do the pizza.
Now, see here.
I ain't no pie, pergler.
Do the pizza.
I did not steal a pizza.
Oh, you know what?
You only had one slice.
Put your head close to the glass door.
See if anybody's inside.
Help me.
Close it.
Close it.
I'm a little closer.
Like that.
I'm not getting sleepy.
Oh, goodbye.
You're a tough guy, huh?
Why are you a tough guy?
Why are you a tough guy?
Come here, you assholes!
Come here, you assholes.
Come here, you assholes!
You better be right there, some of you.
Step aside.
I'm a little closer.
See you.
I stand before you now.
Let me bless you, my son, of the door.
Of the door.
Well, perhaps you'll感er mine, John.
Er, my two-dolies.
I don't want to look at that two-dolies.
Yeah, I don't want your two-dolies over me.
I'll never fight thee in this.
Of course it's more important that I outlive you while I get on.
I go home now or I'm sure. Watch out for Mr. Whipple's.
We need to run on screens.
I'm back.
I'm going to spit more.
Look at that.
Look at that.
Look at that.

The expragio sanitizing is fucking around for
you all to choose from.
I want to raise my head in the street today.
This is this tree.
Oh my god.
Just blazing.

Why am I meaning to, I get this out of my pile in this good that I can finally all
New Jersey strippers protest into a smoking van.
They're smoking it.
With curious office workers gawking and strip bar standards playing in the background,
several hundred people joined a handful of exotic dancers in front of the state house
on Thursday in Trenton, or you could smell it.
To run against New Jersey's new indoor smoking van.
About 20 of the women who took the disappointment of the crime didn't reveal anything more
risqué than their midriffs said the battle result in lost clients and lost money.
It's going to murder our business said Dominique Hernandez, 24, who dances at a lounge in Florence.
New Jersey, not Italy.
A lot of people want to get off from work, have a drink and smoke and watch some pretty
girls.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Not at all.
Apparently not judging by the looks Hernandez and tight jeans and revealing black t-shirt
received from the omeladers, the gockers.
I'm just passing by the way the orifice was referring for many men and some women in the
crowd.
Right.
You fairy.
But many said they came to protest the smoking van saying it was a violation of their rights.
What rights did he hear that story?
I just got through a reading man and say fascist state man.
Yeah.
The dictatorship.
Even the vice president's name is Dick.
But many said they came to protest the smoking van.
I've been a smoker since I was 13.
It was really against our rights to Alan Brophy, 24 of you now.
I wonder if he's related to a mic prophy from the hockey news.
Pretty soon they're going to be outlawing in our houses.
Brophy did the meant that words of strippers at the rally had peaked his interest.
The fact that there were strippers there.
Otherwise, he probably wouldn't have made it there.
The rally terminated by two radio shock shocks.
Oh, don't you love that term.
Featured signs that read the five anti-smoking Nazis and tobacco control is out of control.
In the background, a lot of speaker, typical strip cartoons such as, you can leave your
head on and girls, girls, girls.
We're standing up for the average Jersey citizen who on the roll would never be heard
said Craig Carton, one of the radio hosts on New Jersey 101.5.
Craig Carton, he's smoking it by the pack.
The ban which affects bars and restaurants, but not gambling areas of casino, is it to
be sent in law this Sunday by Governor Richard J. Cody.
As a matter of fact, this is from the this past Sunday too late.
The strippers in this importance of the oppose the ban which is designed to protect employees
and customers from second-hand smoke, because it'll hurt business.
Alan Blum, you know something?
Now, in a place like that, I think it's ridiculous.
But like in the casino, the one knock I'll give you, and Niagara Falls is pushed like woodmine.
You can't smoke it, woodmine.
I have like you go smoking areas, but not in the casino itself.
All right.
And that's about the only good thing I can say about the ambiance.
But in Niagara Falls, it's beautiful as it is in beautiful people and the, we're just
police will kind of a place.
They let smoke and go on in there.
And after you've been away from people blowing smoke in your face for a long time,
then a little sudden they're starting to, oh man.
Even if you got a good machine, you want to get up and run mine because it's just a,
and of course they can't just exhale.
They got to like blow the smoke right in your face.
What?
Or they got to stick it.
They got to stick it in the edge right here.
Just at the right angle to make sure it all wafes up right in there.
Right in your post, you know?
All smoke follows beauty in them.
Yeah.
Right.
They tell you.
I see.
Well in that case, my life ought to be smoke free.
Oh, I guess what?
Well, I'll get to that in a minute.
So I guess we gave away the, um, all of them, huh?
Yes.
Yes, very, very good.
Big conscious of my life, there is no way to call you tail.
They're going to smoke a big fat one in the Yorker magazine.
I'm going to roll it up.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
I'm a little, yeah, I don't know what my face is.
All right.
I'm a tease in the front of me.
It's for you.
I'm a tease in the front of me.
I'm a tease in the front of me.
Don't make me talk.
I'm going to cry.
In those years I've suffered.
In those years I've seen the light.
Baby, baby, you're my baby.
Yes.
Don't make me talk.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 5'16", QA.
Who smells the gildies as always in my side?
Who would you start a girl that gets so far?
I've lain others, but it's me that's so far.
Another one is for me.
From my bed I listen to my fart.
My ass sheets ran into, listen to my fart.
The sweet smell of my food.
You don't like what you're telling me.
But it's great to me, listen to my fart.
And it was an empty day.
Boy, get emotional about that.
It's 146-146-146-122.

Okay.

gains in immigrant every 31 seconds on average, mostly illegal of course, the population
is growing by one person every 14 seconds.
So that's like four minutes.
Wow, they're the candidates.
Yeah.
At that rate, the total is expected to top 300 million late this year, but with those
projections adjusted monthly and the number of births typically peaking during the summer,
the benchmark is likely to be reached about nine months from now.
You end up with the number of October said Katrina Wenger to demographer and keeper of
the sensitive here as official population clock, getting about as specific as possible
this for an advance in the field to subject the field subject to chronic,
fludging and revising.
In other words, they make up numbers.
The clock is itself a contrabonc course, but no more so than other pretext for wintertime
sexual encounter.
Rest assured that hospital publicists, county obstetricians at entrepreneurial chambers
or commerce, maybe food manufacturers, public officials and countless others pursuing
some political social or personal agenda embedded by the media are already our
guist of meaning.
We grow for eight to anoint any number of unsuspecting newborns as the mythical American
who pushed the nation's population to 300 million.
They're pushing it.
And that generally is what causes it.
They're pushing it.
In 1967, when the population reached 200 million, life magazine dispatched 23 photographers
to locate the baby and devoted a five-page spread to its search.
Instead of deciding on a statistically valid symbol of the average American newborn, the
magazine chose the one born at precisely the appointed time.
Life immortalized Robert Ken Rue Jr.
of Arlanis.
See, that was the Chinese factor.
Okay.
Whose parents a computer program, a premier, a crammer, and a chemical engineer had immigrated
seven years earlier from China.
Mr. Rue graduated Magnicom Laudie from Harvard, thank God, and is a litigator.
Now 38, he's still isn't invited with his wife Angie, who's also a lawyer and there are
three daughters.
He did feel that Robert needs to do well, Mrs. Rue said, but I think he would have done
well with your looks.
Yeah, it would have been really bad if the 200 million American women had deadbeats,
like some kind of an ass murder or something like that.
Or the ass assassin, huh?
It would have been bad.
How many QA and H.
Uncle Neil, how are you?
Sir, okay.
All right.
You're a well-traveled young man.
Have you ever been to Ireland before?
No, no thanks, lady.
No, no interest.
No.
Okay.
He's the average people, man.
There's pasty Irish.
I can see a lot of them in Boston, like Tip O'Neill.
Yeah, I hear you.
Live in there.
You're going there?
What's your story?
No, I was curious to go there.
It looks like a beautiful country.
I like to try it out.
Don't do it.
Okay, now we'll do it.
Can't walk.
I'm camping all the flight reservations.
Can't walk right now.
Listen, I have a question for you.
What a journey instead.
Germany?
Germany, trust me.
Berlin and all that.
Berlin, Calon, that's it.
All right.
Can you get Calon at Calon?
I don't know.
The French.
They make a lot of it.
They can't seem to buy any.
It's just too expensive for those very thrifty French.
That's just the price for it.
As thrifty as the Scottish, almost as thrifty as the Dutch.
Boy, those Dutchmen, man.
They make a French Canadian look like benevolent.
Oh, look what I just did there.
What did you just do?
Well, I'm not going to tell you.
Because that way you'll never know.
This is Neil Rogers.

I'm going to have to go.
I'm going to have to go and have to glue little pieces of white to this.
Yeah!
Oh, I can get a little piece of white.
Did you like that?
I didn't want to move.
When I moved it here left the only house I could get over and left the only shiny houses and houses can be huge.
Tell you, you're forcing me to do this.
Okay.
I'll find a nice Hawaiian turn.
You're...
Wow!
Oh, boy, boy, boy.
Oh, boy, boy.
Oh, boy, boy, boy.
Oh, boy, boy, boy.

Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, baby, come on, come on.
Come on, baby, come on.
I'm going to show that George hated because it was a cop show who I fight right now.
I would have had to have watched it to hate it.
Oh I see.
I'll see you there we go.
Make adjustments now.
I don't know how to do it.
I don't know how to do it.
I don't know unless you watch it this week.
It was the same as all the other ones.
You know, they catch the guy at the end.
Y-Y-Y-Y.
Yeah.
They catch the guy at the end.
Okay.
Here's the poll 8.51.
We could have done the easy 900 if we had pushed it.
But we don't want to put a lot of pressure on you in the middle of the week.
For me listening to the Elijah Zagirli pressure because none of the above 5.64 was 66 percent.
Two thirds of the audience is like general whatever.
