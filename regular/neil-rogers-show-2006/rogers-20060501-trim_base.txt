It's dangerous, Miami town
Birds have five six old WQA
We want the world for me and Jerk
We'll punch your grass, boom, be a man
The willy huts of fests and everything
And y'all, they come into America
Cut your bones and or make your dreams
Then watch your cars
Try and do it for me and the gracious star
And for the half and half and half
Don't stop it man
Oh!
Are you the way they do all the jobs
Where you want them all to get paid
And you've got the road to
We should shift them all down the average
Let them go and win the chain
Yeah!
Call your own daughter, you need your own beauty star
The willy huts of grass, the indresser's drugs
They come into America to do our shows
I don't know the smell of the fun
All they want to do is laundry clean and dust
They're water, and there's no stopping them
Let me look in for the American dreams
That's why they started to win the string
Go ahead and give them all the pizza
Let them go and win the common pizza
I think you'll hear
Yeah!
You know what's like with like, if you took your whole family
And you went to Disney World for the weekend or something
And you came back on Sunday night
And there was a whole bunch of Mexicans in your house
Yeah, and you said, what the hell are you doing here?
And I said, we just moved in
Right, and we took out your garbage and we washed the dishes
And we dusted for cheap
And we're going to move the lawn Monday morning
And we're going to all these things for next to nothing
And you said, yeah, get out of here, you don't belong here
This is my house, and they said, how dare you do that?
Yeah, who do you think you are?
What's the rights?
Yeah, we demand that, but it'll be pitiful
There's this whole thing today
I say, let's boycott QA and today
What?
Look, it ain't going to work
It's boycott day, oh I'm just, I'm going to go back to bed
My ears are still plugged up, I got the ass end of the flu
And I do mean the ass end
Yeah
I just got the flu, my ears are still plugged up, bad
And just a whole general ambiance to this place
Tomorrow morning, the ratings will be, I love in 30 in the morning
Man, that should be a real fly opener
Wow, there'll be a run, yeah
In fact, let me just give you some advice right now
You know, because if you don't want to repeat that experience yet
A few weeks ago, remember when you couldn't get in the tea room?
Oh, yeah
There'll be a line for that magic room
From there all the way to Jacksonville, I'm telling you
I'll bring you a bucket
They will be
Now, why the hell are we got calls on here already?
W-Q-I-M, hello?
Hello!
See, he's just getting boring to me at this point
You're boring, okay?
Yeah, he's been boring for years, but you're so ponderous
W-Q-I-M, hello?
See, there's nobody on that one either
And probably calling in for the latest draft information
Maybe that's what I got, maybe I got a draft
Maybe that's how I got the flu
Did we really run a Orlando tape interview again with the number one draft pick?
Did we ran again there?
Did we have to go play golf?
Yes
It's just, you know what it is?
It's unacceptable as what it is
But there's new regime we got, man, they are just scared of their own shadow
W-Q-I-M, hello?
No, that one ain't gonna work.
Q-I-M, hello?
Hey, Neil
Yes
Sounds to me like you're fading fast
I want to apologize to the dead Bobby Daron
So I'm on biography last night and for years I've been saying
How did I drink, Bobby?
And because I always thought he'd died
Because he would have had a drinking problem
Sandra D who was married to Bobby Daron
She had a drinking problem and they were divorced as a result of that
And many other reasons, whatever
But he didn't have a drinking problem
He had a heart problem, he was born with it
And the doctors didn't expect he was gonna live till...
But he did
But he did
And then it just finally had that was the end, you know what I'm saying?
You own apology, quick picking on dead people
I'm sorry, bad style
He's a sharp, big guy
Anyway, he's still dead, nobody cares
Now take a look at this, this is really something to be honest
And the first of May, these probably are all the illegals calling in
WCWIM, hola
Good morning Neil, how are you?
Okay
Hey, quick questions, give a few more people
Stay home, the traffic's great out here
Okay, oh, WCWIM, hello?
All you illegals, okay, stay home
See this idea that you're gonna say thank you to America for letting your sneakier ask in
by shutting down business and costing people economically
That's a really good way to do it, slap in the face
That's what it sounds like to me
A slap in the face to the country that you sneak in
I think it's a good idea, so we know who we don't need
I said the other day, there's no, you know, they're not gonna deport anybody
So there's no solution once, you know, the cat's out of the bag
But at least, scared and forcing the law right now
The mission's shown a big fat spotlight on a country that can't protect its own borders
And I've been saying that for 20, almost 30 years
Not 30, man
That's right, by the way, Fuddy's gone, we'll get to that
Got some really heavy duty or radio news, that's Fuddy
Yeah, you would have thought it was Fuddy's the way they were reporting it
You were the thought so, WCWIM, hello?
QYM, illegal alien line, QYM, hello?
Fuddy's leaving, why won't I?
No, we know that, just got to say that, okay?
I just got to say that, okay?
Maybe we got some mom 100 jingles, but I don't think so
Idiot
Oh, this is like a sequel to Thursday, remember?
Wow, holy moly, this is really going to be good for my last show
So many QYM, hello?
Neil
Yes, sir
Have you known the chance to see the new movie in 1993?
No, I wouldn't watch that if he paid me by the minute
You wouldn't want to see it, it's too much
I gotta tell you, it's very, very upsetting
And anyway, I'm going to go back
What's most upsetting is that it's mostly fiction, because they don't have a damn clue what was going on in their plane
They had a guy on the plane, they had a student have a fake bomb, and they beat the crap out of him
And, well, nobody remembers what happened, but anyway
Hey, that's what I just got to say, nobody knows what happened, I'm not really big on, you know
Movies that are loosely based on it, although I did see a really interesting documentary on the
The Health Channel, is it a documentary channel over the weekend about the Kennedy assassination?
Yep
New information?
No, I was just, you know, just kind of like reinforced the fact that we don't really know, but probably never will know, but
Anybody believes Oswald done it?
My Oswald said the dog done it, I think maybe the dog done it
W and Q and I am, hello?
These people are whipped up into an apoplectic frenzy there, like it, Q and I am
Yeah, I'm my friend
W and Q and I am, hello
Hi, Rady, can I switch?
Q and I am, hello?
And that Miguel
Yeah, okay
Here's line 9, here's the Eddie line
Hola, he's part of the show
Yeah, he's part of the show, huh?
We got your show right over here, okay?
It's called Cho and Tell
By the way, George came up with a good idea, B-B-G-I stands for Banjo Boy Group Incorporated
Or could the Beener Boy Incorporated, but I think that sees a history
Oh yeah, that could have just been him
That was a good run we just had there, we haven't had a run like this
Haven't had the runs like that since yesterday
It's part of getting rid of the flu, let me just tell you right now
When you got the flu and you have a wild experience like that
Not only is it good on the scale, but it's also really good getting
And getting out what else you know what I'm saying?
Or your system, it's good purge
Oh yeah, purge, that's what we need to QA him as a big purge
Well, I'm going to go play golf now, so it's been a lot of fun being with you
But I just, I don't get what's going on this during, I see Gellie all over the place
I think these people are trying like a set of message
Remember Joey Zaza was going to send a message right?
I think these people are sending a message like I told you
Waving at White Hanky after Wendu I mentioned there a couple weeks ago, they just got around to it
Thank you, power
WQA M, hello
QA M, Ola
You're good
Yeah, okay, thanks for the bulletin
WQA M, hello
Hi, sir
567 or 560, let's just take calls all day
I'm in the mood for it, man, we're off to such a good start
That was bad form, shouldn't have done it
Was it solid?
No, it was not, we just like, uh, mung
In fact, I thought it was going to be good, but it's not
567 or 560, so there's the usual 6-read card, we got them, I was going to say, out of the way, we got them for the beginning
Well, the word, over the day, huh?
The word, I know that
Here's the poll result from over the weekend
And by the way, we never had one person called in on Friday, not one, not even one, to tell us about the great Renaissance in downtown Miami
So this poll is a little bit vegetative as far as I'm concerned
2050 votes, what's your take on downtown Miami?
Date counties of foreign country
Absolutely
867, over 40%, 42.2
It sucks, don't go there, 527, that's another almost 26%
It's making a great comeback, 270, anybody buying it?
No
Anybody can verify that or tell us how or why?
No
It's become a tourist trap selling a lot of overpriced crap, 98
Never been there, 93. You're out of touch, Neil, 82. Interestingly, 4%, the same 4% we had all consistently all the way through.
You're out of touch, and you know what I say?
Thank Lord, thank God, thank God
I hate this poll 74, and downtown Miami is paradise, only 39
I wouldn't know, haven't been there in a long, long time
Since the last time I went to a Panthers game in downtown Miami, and that's got to be what? Like nine years ago, 10 years, something like that?
You tell me
Have you ever in your life, it's been a long time since we've seen such an effusive outpouring of hysteria
This is almost like aliens coming back by the way, you see what I'm saying?
Yeah
That's the last time that we ever had this kind of a foaming at the moment in the phone, I just barely sat my ass down here
Maybe one of them will be a real call
In fact, maybe this is probably a good idea, we dumped that stupid ass crossover, I think we ought to get rid of that thing
But let's just stop doing that
Send the message along to a Hank's people, we're just not going to do that no more
He's just got too many outside the activities going on, QAM always comes like about 10th on the list, you know?
It's way down the list of priorities
So see, this is my number one priority because this is where I make all my money
So as far as employment is concerned, this is my only priority, follow what I'm saying?
Yeah, maybe you need more earns in the far
No, I don't want any more irons in the far, this is a lot of fire for me
About minutes after 10 at 5.60, let me say it again, Bobby Daron was not a drunk, he was a good-upstanding guy
Good boy
With a bad hair piece, too, by the way, I learned bad about it, he had a real bad piece
Give me life, I'm hoping to trade
Between love, I will come my way
But he still did

QA, why has you seen A&S?
White House images, rightful, and the VADR is rightful
Two convinces of polls aren't low
Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow
Oh right, oh it's hot so host is shopping
So the reds are red, he's shopping
When you want your leadership to go
Tony Snow, Tony Snow, where is your home?
People totally hold bush tight
Tony's called him bad name before
But if you need a man who eats hard brides
Tony Snow, he's your home
Oh bush, thanks of these suit permative
And his views are quiet and servative
Smart move to higher hand, we don't know
Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow
Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow
Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow
Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow
Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow, Tony Snow

Marlins on decades, 30, those red hot Marlins man
They probably released some mokin baby
They are at least their consistent
What is it now? 5 and 15 is that going to be about right?
6 and 16
Oh, 6 excuse me, I missed that last one
You have to buy it if you're going to
But they're the 6's
Yeah, 6 and 16
That is just pathetic
Anyway, they're right
And I noticed that they had floppy head nut on Friday at the ballpark
But even the Eschnore is out there to enjoy for that
Yeah
Must be all the illegal aliens were practicing boycotting
Or something like that because it was announced crowd at 10,000
And if there were like 6,000, 7,000
That was a lot, even for the old floppy head
So even the giveaways aren't drawn now
David, I hate to break the news to you, not going to get no stadium
Yeah, we want to win, we want to be stadium
Yeah, well guess what, you're nobody cares
Marlins in the Phillies, I'm assuming that's a home game?
Yes it is
At 705, they're not, I'm sure it would be a fantastic turn out for that game
And then 80k follows Marlins baseball, which is like following tapes of the bigo interviewing some draft choice
A death wish
Okay, let's take a look at the poll now
I got news for you Mr. Clara Bell
You guys are just playing fast and loose with a multi-
Well there's George Poonie, you know something, he and his dad were on TV all weekend long
And they made the visit to Darfur and we're talking about the first genocide of the 21st century
And they're doing a lot of great things and he still bugs me, I just can't stand looking at it
I don't know what it is, he just bothers me
The way he cocks his head sideways when he tells me
Is that what it is?
Like a bird or dog
No, a bird or a bird
Well dogs do that for high-pitched sounds, I heard do that all the time
Anyway, he just irritates me
I know, I know, he's very on the right side politically
I mean on the left side and all the stuff and he just bugs me
Here's our poll today, the star-spangled banner should be sung
694 vote already, we'll make that 1000 easy
Easy, even after I leave to play golf
In English only 423 in English
Solemente, okay?
Solemente in English 423
60% plus
Rarely, it's a bad song, that's the correct answer obviously
It's a horrible song, 114
Most people don't know the lyrics and it's just a Honduras and it goes about a holiday
Can you see there?
Yeah
In any language, 93
Who gives a schmutz 61? That's a very good choice
In English or Spanish, Solomon Teocho
Only 8 people say English or Spanish
See that? And I hate this poll too
Big should be in Pigland
701
This is the latest, let's get everybody whipped up to Yuri
You know about what language should we speak?
And so we'll hop on, we'll bite
Speaking of biting, I hear a footy of weaving a while 100s, why I heard
I am
Better get some of these calls on though, I want to get really call intensive this week
Because we got the book coming 1130 tomorrow morning
And we'll have to dissect that and chew it up and spit it out
I think mostly spitting it out
That's spitting I said
WDQYM Hello
This is a crazy man
WDQYM Hello
You can go Andy and Camerader
721, hello
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Hey, I want to call you about two weeks ago to talk about a subject where
The news came out that Bush had released the information about Valerie Plain
And then, insanely, although it's a Bush administration
And Fox News released information that they were going to use nuclear weapons on the Iranians
For their nuclear program
I just wonder if anybody brought that up
And I feel that they released that to kind of take away attention from the Valerie Plain thing
So, let's nuke Iran deal
Well, they like changing the subject
Now of course the fact that we got all the important stuff going on
Like the chicken of Rubi, you know
Well, you know, in closing meal
I think they stole the election
WDQYM Hello
How can I hang in your back?
WDQYM Hello
If they always take a good deep breath always helps, okay?
Yeah, take that deep breath like a vacuum cleaner like a Kirby vacuum cleaner
Because most of these call so far have sucked big time
WDQYM Hello
Hey, how you doing, Tally?
Can I ask you a question?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
What is with this everybody who's called who hasn't been just an idiot has asked a question
This isn't 20 questions, what are you guys?
What would you like to say?
Well, I'd like to ask you what is the related, I know they sound leaders but what are you paying in Canada?
I know if you're driving up there but what is the relationship the course of
So, Rubi, what about the gallon?
All right, so it's all relative then
What do you want me to find us, do you?
No, I do not
Okay, because it's getting really ponderous at this point
Okay, well I'm glad to hear that
Oh my god, it's been over four bucks a gallon for quite some time
In fact, it used to be like it's expensive
And that's one of the reasons, one of the main reasons I don't have no car here
What though I want to maintain a car here and spend four bucks a gallon for gas
Although when I go out and play golf in about 10 minutes, I probably wish I had that car
And what though is this that somebody's, oh record, price low for B-B-G-I
For Banjo Boy Group Bank, look at that somebody just packed in
Thanks for the good news, woo!
Take a puke at that
Down to 6.7, 25 B-B-G-I
Oh, wow, what is it now?
It's 9.25, says record, price low for B-B-G-I
And deservedly so by the way
These people are just unbelievable
They drag their heels and drag their feet on everything
And blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Just like George and Josh's new deals, how are those coming?
Guys, I think they're fermenting
They're fermenting
They've got it over there and they're still, you know, that's right
Yeah, they've got to still up in the heel over here and there
That's correct
And how about Josh, how's your thing? Is it sign seal delivered?
Not sign and sealed, but delivered, I'm told
Yeah, it's good to go
But everything's fermenting over there on the west coast
Perkulate, it's very spectacular
Just like your morning coffee, it's percolating over there
Just like Maxwell House coffee
That's it
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop
Wow
It is just, you know, something tomorrow morning at 11.30
We got the winter book coming out
And I think people are going to reap the windfall of their incompetence
I think it's going to be just astonishing
I think we may have to strap ourselves in
WDQYM, hello
Hello
Yes, sir
Yeah, can I talk to Neil?
Speaking
Hello
Let me say again, speaking
Take it here
Neil, first of all, I got something to tell you, man
Yeah
First, I want to tell George
He showed very much disrespect for showing up to work
Yeah, yeah
And number two
Uh-huh
Rest of the crane call
How many QAM, hello
Did you hear Neil, read in QAM to go play golf?
First of all, George isn't an illegal alien
How do you like that?
So that's why he showed up to work today
Only the illegals are not showing up to work
It's a great way to say thank you, America, for letting me sneak in here
Across the border and coming in
I know that we know who all the people are
Stop, uh-
No, that's not the point. The point is this is a slap in the face
Sure
It's not- it's not just it's disgusting
And when you break into somebody's country, just like breaking into somebody's house
Like I used to be a comparison before
You don't start making demands, okay?
I demand this, right?
And I demand that, your mom, okay?
Get lost, go back and mow the lawn, get out of my face
And the businesses that are closed, those are the ones that are hiring those illegals
That is they are
So you know who to avoid in the future now
Yeah
Because those people that are hiring illegal aliens
Because they are a bunch of grave robbers
Right
Those are the ones who perpetuate the problem
Because they are the indigenous
They set out the message, okay?
They are the enabled
They set up a number of risk their lives and come across the border
So they can get these jobs
That's right, they belong in jail
I say to Vicente Fox, you crook, you gangster you
If things lie in Mexico, if people actually have a chance for a decent life there
People wouldn't be risking their lives to come across the border
They don't allow illegals to go into Mexico
That is correct
So I say, boycott Vicente Fox
That's what I say
And don't need any burritos today
Just pay back as a bitch
Don't need any burritos and certainly don't need no case ideas
All right
All the way I do like a nice case idea
Chicken case idea is pretty good
I had to say case idea yesterday
Mmm
That's it
That's it

Hey, shut the world, hey baby
Hey, I love you, Tom
I love you, Shoe Baby, but just stay quiet, okay?

Come in, I love you
Okay, I know you want me to be quiet
I said quiet, I get shut up!
I told you to shut up, I didn't want to have to do this
I said shut up!
Oh my God
1032-560-3QAM
Well, I'll teach that bitch to make all that noise
That's right
She got a dummy up while he's eating a placenta
Oh, man
But this just in breaking news, man breaking news, big news
The Supreme Court rule today that one time stripper in Playboy Playmate Annanacole Smith could pursue part of her late husband's oil fortune
They said, you go, girl
Justice has gave New Legal Impetus to Smith's bid to collect millions of dollars from the estate of J. Howard Marshall in a second
Her late husband's estate has been estimated as much as 1.6 billion
I'll take a little piece of that, please
That's what Tom said to him when he looked at Annanacole
So how do you get the piece of that?
I need to go around
So let me just look up her dress one time
Smith has been embroiled in a long running cross country fight along with Marshall's youngest son, E. Pierce Marshall
The court's decision which was unanimous means that it will not end anytime soon
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg writing for the court said Smith should have a fresh chance to pursue claims in federal court
Dressed in all black, the former stripper wept in the courtroom late in late February
As Justice has discussed Marshall and mother's he had intended to provide for her in death
Once she arrived at the court several photographers were knocked to the ground and escuffled her to take photos
It would not to the ground, they paparazzi
WQYM, hello
Leo
Yes sir
I got a question for you
Another question, yeah
No more questions, man
No more questions, man
Alright, I come in, I come in, Leo
George should not be at work
He is the punk
He is the grotto and protest
He is the star
What is he going to protest?
Everybody calls this guy going to make
Yeah, what is he going to protest?
The immigration policy, the Bush administration
And what policy is that?
Your policy at all
Uh-huh
Well, let me ask you something, where are you calling me from a cell phone?
No
Well, where are you right now?
I'm in Fort Boydale
Well, I'm not talking about what city I'm talking about, where are you in a building?
Well, I'm away to the protest now
Yeah, well, good, good, good, busy, yeah
I found a way to protest my ass
I'm bringing the gas on the floor
It's so full of it
Protests, you know, they had 300,000 people protesting against the war and all the bloodshed in New York on over the weekend
And these St. Lawrence that are out there today, that's what they ought to be protesting
Almost 3,000 Americans that, you know, the best estimate is 180,000 wounded
180,000 is what is the number they put on and not wounded
I mean, that's 100, I mean, 18,000
Well, it would be pretty soon, it'll be 180, 18,000
And these idiots, oh, you ought to be out there protesting what?
That's not what these people are protesting
They're not protesting the fact this government don't have it in immigration policy
These are a bunch of beeners out there protesting the fact that, you know, we're not going to give them some kind of special status
May it wave that magic wand and say, okay, you're Americans now, repeat after me
I pledge allegiance by Ruchata, Yuskid al-Biyah
Wow
You know, I have a feeling that the people across the street, I've got a piece of advice for them
And if the Democrats were smart, they'd take the same advice, okay?
Don't do anything
Yeah
Just sit back, no, listen, you're right
Democrats need to just sit back and let the Republicans implode, self-destruct, because that's what they're doing
And the same thing for the people across the street
Don't make any rash moves, just sit back and fumble your incompetent way along, put this will on the ear
And you'll be okay, it's coast-along
Just coast-along, that's right, because this place is imploding
Every single morning that I sit down here, there are new and shocking development
None of them good, by the way, not a single one of them good
And it's just amazing to me, and of course today is the first of May
Which means El Sincuida Mairos coming up on Friday
Now you're going to be working on Sincuida Mairo?
Punk
But tell us around with you, man, you've got to be in solidarity with your Hispanic brethren
Right, right, hey, just sit my ancestors, rates of people, doesn't make us brothers
Yeah, yeah, right, an audio-marti
I'll have a mark, I mean, it's in it, Andy Garcia's making another Cuba movie
He's more obsessed than your buddy Miguel there, just obsessed
It was Cuba, Cuba, I think he's also trying to exploit Godfather too
Because it's about the mafia and the casino is in this and that, but it would be put in all this other crap
I wonder if they're going to talk about how the fact that the T-Ce was being paid off by all the monsters
What's hope?
Which is why they had the casinos there in the first place, I doubt it
Michael?
No, he's going to be talking mostly about alien and meriscretia as and the Miami family
And all that, a lot of great chapter
WQAM, hello
Neil
Yes, sir
One question for you
No more, no more questions, all done with questions
If you start your call by saying I got a question, you are history
You are gone, just like magic, just like that
Speaking of gone, footy
The legendary software, what is that legendary?
I mean, legendary My Ass
Yeah
Where did legendary and whose mind?
This isn't a herald by the way, so I take it with four greens of salt
I don't know about you, but are you having, well of course you don't probably read the Sun Sentinel online
I don't
But I just, I can't, they're having problems with their website and it can't be me because it's the only website I have problems with
The only one, maybe Josh can explain that to me
Well, I have no problem with it, so it is you
Well, but how is that possible, why would that be?
I have no idea, I read it every morning and I just went to it right now
Really? Maybe they're watching the Canadian
Well, let's see, let me do it right now
Do it
Uh, okay, SunSendle.com
Can that
Anyway, can that too
Okay, there's the match head, there's the top part
And the rest of it, I wait and I wait and I wait
And I wait, the rest of the main page
And I'm waiting and I'm waiting and I'm waiting and waiting and the little thing is, uh, nothing's happened
And then eventually it will finally will open
And then you'll click on a story that you might want to get to the story and nothing happens
And then even I went to Firefox and I do the same thing, this has been going on for about five days now
Well, there it is, former USF professor to be deported after one and a half years in prison
A judge today sentenced former professor Sammy Allaryan to another year and a half in prison before he'll be deported in his terrorism
That's the Ashmukh Rover in Tampa, remember USF?
Right
Dolphins Taylor stabbed in the road rage incident
Dolphins defensive and outside linebacker Jason Taylor was stabbed last night in the roadside incident in his debut home
He's okay though
Now let's see if I click on, oh and look at that!
Oh, something's going on here, now all of a sudden it comes up
Hmm, I think Tom Jikker
I think Tom Jikker just took the hold off on my computer
He had a problem
He put a wicked spell on there, Canadian filter
Yeah, that's it
Well, I tell you Dolphins, man, they got Soros
Because, I think, got these culpapers
Not always, you got a real crappy attitude, but he's also got a bad knee and he's injured and he ain't going to be playable to play the first half of the season
And now they didn't want to get in Joey Harrington, did they?
Well, not yet
Oh, I sure hope they do
Because he really sucks
He is bad
He'll make them long for AJ Tussi-Fili
That's how bad he is, he is pathetic
He'd be bad
So basically they don't have any quarterback now
No, they have some Terry Burger that I've never heard of
They have somebody that they mentioned, I saw about four minutes of the draft year over the weekend
And I didn't even know who he is
And nobody ever heard of him before
He ain't even as good as Sage, Surge, Erosen, Cranced, Edelstine, Forts
So they got real, they're going to have some real-time, of course, Ricky
I don't think Ricky's coming up here though
They said they don't want him like exhaust, they want you to weed supply
So the local officials are really reconsidering letting him come up
Plus, the Dolphins aren't going to let him out of this
He's got a contract that says that he can't play anywhere else anyway
I'll be damned
Did you know that?
I did not
Well, that's what the deal is, and Nick Saban says, a-a-a, at least so far
So this business, he's coming to Toronto, he's going to play for the Argos
In fact, the article on the paper said, he didn't mention the fact that he's very fond of the wicked weed
And they're coming here, he'd be a very happy camper
Because everybody in their brother is smoking like openly here, practically gagging on it
The New Black Panther Party rallies to support a accuser

Let's get with it
Tuddy, the hero says the legendary South Florida Morning Radio host will put on his last show this week after more than three decades on the year according to CBS 4
The veteran on air personality, whose name is John Cross
Will host his final segment for the Y100 Morning Show on Y100 this Friday, the new station say
Cross, Cross, whatever his name is, and became cohost in the morning 32 years ago
Said he'll continue overseeing his charity, Here's Help, which has raised money for numerous area organizations
What else could I possibly do in radio, who to report to Brian Andrews?
You ferry!
I'm not going to go to satellite because I ain't moving and nobody wants to syndicate a guy from Miami
So this is it, you're stuck with me
And nobody wants to syndicate a guy from Miami
So you're stuck, I don't know what that means, so you're stuck with me
It's like show is Friday but we're stuck with him
Do you have any idea what that means?
I have no clue, and don't care either, care much less
Speaking of radio, we got those big ratings coming out of 1130 tomorrow morning
Bridge ratings has released its latest update to their ongoing study of consumer awareness of the two satellite radio brands along with subscription trends
The latest results go right up to this week, finding that as the study has gone on, brand loyalty and programming options have become a more important factor for consumers
The majority of whom have said that serious has superior programming to XM
However, here's the big butt, however, the power of Howard Stern to bring in new serious subscribers appears to have stalled out
After adding over a million new subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2005, there was a 26% drop off to 814,000 new subscriptions in the first quarter of this year
Looking at the same timeframes, XM added approximately 900,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of last year with another 568,000 in the first quarter of this year
A 37% drop off
In the first month of the second year, Bridge says that the Stern effect has basically stalled
Bridge estimates that roughly 1.1 million, 84% of Stern's fans have followed him to serious 8%
When Stern fans were asked to wait for why they had not subscribed to serious, 32% said they didn't miss a show enough to sign up
With 25% said the cost involved were too much to pay
Looking at what satcaster was acquiring more subscribers, they pinned on his wrong back and forth week to week between the two with XM pulling ahead for much of April
Programming options and elected commercials made the top two reasons why new subscribers made their choices
As for awareness of the two brands, this number has also gone back and forth week to week with XM on top again for much of April
Bridge ratings released at second full quarterfightings in July, so it's definitely something in July we'll find out
Ready for that is that some exciting news or what all this is exciting as footies going to hang up is a microphone
I don't even know if I ever heard him on here I do know he's a real jerk
At least I've been told I've never heard him
He did some kind of a he was working for that broad some broadcasting school
I'm not sure whether it's the one we used to advertise or who it was
I don't know
And we had some intern that came and said oh yeah he went there to one of the footies classes
And he said and the footies said well whatever you do don't be like that near Rogers
Because he he's unprofessional and don't be like that
And remember that just trashed a hell out of me sure who would want to be successful who would want to be make that kind of money and be successful and live a fine life that he's living in Toronto
And I have to be in the swill of South Florida
That's right don't be like me whatever you do footy loser yeah gone fishing go fishing sweetheart go have a great life
Torp and anyway five six seven look I said I'm going to take a lot of calls today man because you can see already
Well at least we did see a little while ago that they were forming at the mouth that's too bad about that danger boy group in Stockholm down so bad
WQ I am hello
Yeah
Yeah
Mm-hmm
Uh-huh
Well he seems to be fading badly ladies and ladies those tight suspenders
Five six seven oh five sixty boy they were on fire for a while they're worth they
They must they must have taken that guy's advice they must be all hitting the streets now get out there for that
That's worth it
They're boycotting it
Maybe they're just boycotting the show today wouldn't surprise wouldn't be the first time or maybe they're boycotting the fact we got guilty
I took it again
Why not just give him the deal okay I mean it's pretty obvious they want to put him on their everyday two to four just give it to him
Okay and stop with this game that you're playing whatever it is this kind of sadistic thing that they're doing to all of us
Just put him on there we're not going to be too happy about it but then again at least it'll be the other half of it
Very duo that we used to have in the morning now that the moment is gone
This Clara Valboa he is just a wizard just a miracle worker WQYM hello
Hello
Hello first of May
I'll go
WQYM hello
WQYM hello
Yes, Neil
Yes sir
Neil this is Marco your Italian listener for many many years. Yes, I was in either I'm back in Miami and I'm very happy to hear your voice again
I was I want to just to comment something Neil about your show if it's possible
Yeah
It looks like the audience has really dropped in quality and
They have very little interest in you know the most important things that happen in this country
No it's the same it's the same you rather it's the same for the videos
The most two things and I guess the most creative well it's very representative of America
I was very well and I have a great day and I read that Archie and Bonasetta and bye bye with the bad Tony accent
560 have an 0560 pound 560 neighbor rising singular wireless lines I wonder I wonder what time they had the meeting to set these calls up today
This was good I think they knew it was that was that was they got together with Denny's quarter table there the big right you hop WQYM hello
Yes sir
I got a comment for these immigrants and all the paint shows back let's save all the fire women
Yeah okay
Don't don't ask don't ask and I won't tell somebody Q. I. M. Hello. Hey Neil. I don't welcome back welcome back from where I'm just kidding I haven't been for a while I've been out of town
But I wanted to ask you are you're bashing your management there kids did you ever figure out what this static is usually the Mexican station now it's Russian today
Is it bad for them?
I wait we don't know we don't care how's that that's the key I'm not sure we don't know we don't care and don't bother us with such important things I'm sorry I'd rather listen to you though not the other station but appreciate it
Okay have a go have a have a lot more than of course nobody's telling us about it from the inside only the audience lets us know what's really going on you know
So I think we have to be very jackass to find out about programming decisions that are being made same thing because nobody inside probably even listen to any way they're listening to power 96
The first time in my life I ever worked in a place even if I was down there in a building if you know like have only your mad the Russians to the tea room during a commercial break and you can't really hear when the break is going to end or you know how fast you have to get back because they don't have the station on the monitors anywhere in the right just to be fair they don't have the other station on in there either
No it just sounds a silence that's right well at least the sequel opportunity in difference that that's a good acoustics in there for the other sounds you hear but you can hear power 96 on the phone
That's great they sure wouldn't want to put this on the phone oh god for big can you imagine all the people they piss off putting the Neil Rogers your on the phone we're not even talking about sports in the sanctity of the NFL draft you have to be deaf not to catch the draft
It is so and now that that's over with what do they do now on what are sports nerds do now the marlins are 6 and 16 I mean they can win a fixed game and it just they couldn't draw flies to a manure pile
And so that's done of course the Panthers their playoffs are they ain't no playoffs so what what do you got going on I'm of course leader lost again oh my god to the bulls wow that's embarrassing and they had all that controversy in that one game they go all
Disorganized in this kabubled and just falling apart of the seams I can you imagine if they should get eliminated if I can say that hey can I say that choice eliminate
Would that be something because then what so long hot summer baby between the first of May and football went once the first exhibition is game August something oh yeah August boy June July all your man oh man three solid months what the other sports are going to do there except maybe go out and play some golf
This is Neil Rogers this is my

Thank you thank you so very much so better over and over again this your interviewing some illegal ali I mean the immigrants
Is
see that this whole thing is bogus because i got to see an end day without
immigrants is what they're calling this thing today and this is got nothing
to do with immigrants immigrants are people are came in legally through the
process like what's online like most american process and right like most
people are law-biting we're talking about illegal aliens is what we're talking
about so why don't they a little bit of truth and packaging would be okay
see an end you liars you phone is you bastards you
like everybody local news every every other news outlet everyone
understand there because they're busy pandering
at that everybody
dolphins defensive and slash outside linebacker Jason how do you like my
calendar tailor was stabbed last night in a road range incident there is
maybe home to see this guy yes i did would not be bad if they lost Jason
Taylor for the season that's a room where i'm hearing
well we just made up to be the quarterback to my wife and i were the victims
of an unfortunate incident last night but we're both fine he said the
statement released by his charity foundation i truly appreciate everyone's
concern there's a guy he out he gives it 400 percent i'll say that for him
even though i hate the team like poison believe you know there's a guy goes
out there and he tries and really come back him and Zach your buddy Zach yeah
not that's that the injury Taylor sustained was arm was mine right up and he
was able to participate this morning in a charity golf tournament for Tampa
Bay Buccaneers linebacker Derek Brooks in Tampa so i'm not assuming that was
the charity golf tournament with the Humper was off to because this one was in
Tampa right right right Seth Levit who was the Jason Taylor foundation's
spokesman said tamer and his wife could treat him were driving home from
church when the incident occurred oh it's big enough church guess what else I
saw on biography last night what is the biography last night the BTK killer oh
yeah the BLT killer in Wichita right good church going there he wasn't
he was the present of the aggregation of his Lutheran congregation that's
right man be where there's Lutherans oh oh oh oh I got some neighbors by the way
we're gonna put a big flag up on front of my house gonna say he is fallen to
counteract the one that said he is risen you know he has fallen he's risen and
can't get up Taylor 31 is set to what are his 10th season with the
Adolfins Yadda Yadda Yadda Yadda but to be put a boot put about more need
health to come it's interesting the Sun's send a let's be that way for like four
days just kind of like frozen in suspended so that mentioned down here like
magic where's that magic wand you got okay oh it's good it's like back to
normal again like all the other websites on my computer that's strange I don't
want to sound paranoid or anything like that I don't want to be one of those
real conspiracy what his name is very suspicious to me five six seven oh five
sixty it's the guilty warm-up show man we got guilty it too see I think the new
format is we got a bunch of people who show up pretty much whenever it's
convenient for them is the new format all right it's kind of interesting you
got to admit nobody in other states in the country's got a deal like that keep
him guessing we got several people that's right I mean I show up whenever I'm
supposed to when I realize we got that nice posh summer schedule come up very
very soon oh not soon enough but very soon but at least we know at least we know
what that schedule is also let me just pass this along in case there's anybody
inside a building listening which I doubt at two o'clock when the idea is over
and then whatever cute stuff you put in there after the idea that's when you
chop us off not whatever you feel like it's more the ideal idea like even the
Friday as a matter of fact no it's just getting to the point now anybody the
janitor goes in there and all of a sudden he's like
Neil Rogers midday
that's what you're trying to do right now my any four-dollar day see there was a
legal idea to make up for the one we missed it to a clock on Friday yeah because
we got a quote in a field you know like the cops are like the porkers you know
we got to fill our quota because from what I'm being told this morning is we
have just you know it's kind of like a sliding rotation there they're sliding
and rotating it and whoever happens to be running the board to with somebody
different every day oh well what do I do now and is that it do we chop those
back to them probably gildies that kind of my kind of like that wouldn't
surprise me gildies got his fine nose in it WQA M Gildy line hello not there oh
it sounds good though Q.A.M. hello with the deal and our last one WQA M
hello

yes somebody got Charlie I see you know Josh on the website he's a mighty handsome
man yeah Josh Taylor yes and he's very huge okay great five six seven oh five
sixty authorities turn looking a little putty on air I told you that what's
like this Susan Sarandas revealed how she felt isolated and frightened by
death threats and verbal attacks as he criticized the U.S. presence in our
rack the film and Louise actress a long time political activist said she was
branded a bin Laden lover for questioning the U.S. invasion of Iraq and
interviewed me screened today on ITV1 in England for Jonathan Dimblebee's
program he she said that the way she and her family have been targeted by the
media in the public was horrifying horrifying Mr. Randon 59 said she believed that
there should have been more debate before the war but that anyone who questioned
U.S. policy was labeled on American of course we know that I don't think I ever
thought somebody would ever really kill me although there were some people who
said I've actually been to knock her off on the radio and stuff like that she
said well people say a lot of crap on the radio right no they don't they
without immigrants is what they keep labeling this and this has got absolutely
nothing to do with immigrants okay once again see and then totally bogus it's
just like the the great freedom operation Iraqi freedom all these other lies they
put on the screen as they do nothing but suck up to the abou shmeister call
the fascists they without immigrants my fat ass toll on American soil this is
the time to do that this window is not gonna open okay let me get in here
because you packed in about three big points right there and I was hoping to break
it up a little bit so great let me get you in here you're taking a little bit
more pragmatic approach you're saying hold on before we go and join our
Hispanic brothers and sisters on the front lines let's stop and ask the
question front lines are what if these people want to be on the front line send
to Iraq how's that that's a good idea yeah we got a shortage so cool and
policy we didn't send enough troops let's send all these protesters over there
if they wanted to help much they love America and how much they want to be in
America go over there and fight for your country for Christ's and stop worrying
about who's gonna pick the name strawberries they can be citizens over there
and other fruits five six seven oh five sixty they can probably form a new
government and pound five sixty new Verizon singular wireless line here all

Cuban station to be heard in the background we've ever done that got some very serious signal
problems too it is no longer possible to listen to your station later night as the Cuban station is
now even louder than any Kaye is the station doing anything about this no or are they going
to stick their head in the sand like they didn't South Park and pretend it doesn't exist
George thanks pal it says probably a fax from across the street no doubt from what I'm told yes

american protesters who are losing their jobs to illegal demonstrators willing to march for a
fraction of the cost these immigrants carried poorly crafted banners and signs with slogans that
aren't even written in english this nation was built on the backs of complaining americans
and united protesters union believes it should stay that way every time an illegal alien marches
in the protest line an american marches to the unemployment line please join up you and get
these foreigners off our streets and back to taking some other americans job all right it's 11-19-5-60-WQ

leaving terrestrial radio is a me or radio period from what we hear exactly he's got a concept
of that big TV career dick green are you sure that's what we heard that's what you say
well listen that's something i guess i'm supposed to be complimented by that or whatever

five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty you know there are a lot of people out there
one live in the past you know you can't do that there's no more i would be with Rick and suds
and yours truly in Phil Henry and Randy and it didn't exist anywhere that's in the past okay
that elected movie that was then this is now all these people are one live in the past not
supposed to be the old buddy that he lived in the past and you know something there were a lot of
good things in the past and there was also a lot of crap see the old people crap who want to like
live in the past and our staves are crowd they they they they their mind they siphon out all the
crap and they only think about the highlights you know which there weren't that many you know what i'm
saying oh yeah because the passage of time makes everything in the past seem oh man it was so great
you know like like under Greg Reed remember how great everything was no neither wkym hello not
there but we got a lot of those today man very impatient i realize you got to go out there and march
on those front lines baby i'll do elegals but give us just a moment of your time wkym hello
to i m wkym hello me or a girl man okay a lot of tension today don't you feel it yeah i can smell it
hey can you uh play something the light things up a little bit such as sitting on the bench and
down right again out of here that it's lighten up a little what's light about that oh that's not it
what is that i don't know sounds similar it is
sitting in front of the tube i've been sitting just a crap and you
you i kind of like that better than this this is so old and hotter it's picking up old
happy shavuels my life keep their card of war she drives my viewer again she's three feet
whoa that's enough of that vice it why i want to get a lot of important cause and nobody wants to
hear that old retread again that's gonna lighten things up a little bit selfish man you just selfish
you're like most of the other people in south way what are you gonna do for me what are you gonna
do for me i just gave you about 20 seconds of it no extra charge we're gonna start charging by the
by the word and a good idea all right i'll start keep it a tally now that Hank and Sally when the
show is after busy playing cheerleading golf maybe just start charging by the ball
wkym hello
yeah question wkym hello hello yes sir yes i'm a long time listener yes
this second generation actually my father you's the driver and yeah and i would listen to your show
and in you going to all the different stations that you want to i've continued to listen to you and
basically i love your show uh George i love your content as well i love your uh
remember to talk about yes the religious content and also the political right i enjoy that as well
in uh closing i'd like to say to the people who might be listening i work at wkym that i think
they need to really listen up because i feel that you're gonna not renew your contract coming up
well i got three years to go and i got three years to go i'm 60 and i'm sorry let me ask
your honest question yeah you go ahead how old are you i'm 31 years old okay now do you aspire to work
until you're dead no i do not would you like to work until you're like 75 or something like that i
don't want to do that either see now i'd like to work till i'm so i'm comfortable and then i
could sit there and go and enjoy life and i can do that right now i actually i could walk out of
here right now and do that i got plenty of cash exactly and you know what there's gonna be a big
black hole void in their radio station when you leave tomorrow yeah exactly and they need the
learn that this is the week for protest i think you inspired me i'm gonna do my boycott tomorrow
that's right in closing i have one uh film recommendation for you okay um it's it's
Georgia's probably not gonna agree as far as the actor but uh i i personally thought that film
content was really good it's a movie called the foreigner with students to go uh it had really
really good you never heard of it you never heard of it no it's it's what we was on
but he had really good plot content normally his plot content is not all that and he also does a
little bit over dramatic on the martial arts and stuff but if time he was very good with the plot
content and as well as the um the fighting scenes were realistic uh they didn't go aboard with that
so that's pretty much it and it was a really good talk with you Neil thanks a lot pal i have a great
thing you take it easy see there there was now that's that's it that's a great call and that's
what we need now the rest of them can be all idiots can be i think that's a 31 perfect
demographic good guy sounded like he and i q are doing a stumb and he had something to say
and i think the the most important part of that call was his suggestion that i boycott this
current regime man because they they're just killing us seriously i i think what we ought to do
is is put out a call for help remember when Lee arby as well got arrested uh huh and he said i
i can't forget the exact verbiage and i should know it because i just said i thought
the memory of the day but he put out a call for assistance he's exactly for some of the step forward
in a system because he didn't have any idea what it was all about and he's being set up and i'm
just a patty and yeah which course is true although i don't call me patty close it's patty
climb poor patty climb i think she was okay you know she had her hits she had like crazy which of
course fits right into this radio station crazy i mean well what what is really going on with
these people there i mean you know you're there are they like they're just waiting for tomorrow for
the other balls to drop when those numbers come out tomorrow morning look they're they're in a
position that they can't expect i know the position i've seen people in that position
remember in requiem oh yeah i forgot i asked to ask i've seen a lot of people in that position
they're in a position what that there's no remedy for yeah but you know something it's like
it's like it's like me with the flu you know when i first got this thing and i was uh i don't
know whether it's getting a bad cold i and to this point i'm still out here my ears are plugged up
once they pop open i'll feel uh oh when you know when your ears have to have your ears plugged
all the days of the like they have them yeah oh my god it's better than sex by far but at
least you try to do something you know you take a uh nightquil you say you do something but these
are people who are sitting around like they're in suspended animation man they're they're like
frozen in time frozen in time man they they just can't get off the pot now what i told you last week

the walls of Jericho are tumbling down Cindy she and rights mission accomplished day today
May 1st is the third anniversary of the end of major combat in Iraq it was a glorious day when George
Bush the one of the deck of Abraham Lincoln was hailed by the rapturous throngs of totally
newspersons such as Chris Matthews and that's the president looking very much like a jettia
no a high flying star he said in a hardball May 1st 2003 and Bob Sheifer who said as far as I'm
considered that was one of the great pictures of all time and if you're a political consultant you
can just see campaign commercials written all over the pictures of George Bush that was on
meet the press May 4th 2003 what a fast and clean war G Gordon Litty was enthralled with the
president's package all those women who say size doesn't count through all liars hardball may 7th
2003 and a new era free from terrorism was ushered in this is the faith based fable of what
happened almost exactly three years ago the reality based scenario goes something like this
over 24 hundred American soldiers including my son who was killed almost a year after mission
accomplished day have come home and cardboard boxes and cargo areas of planes in the secrecy of
the night thousands of young people are wounded many grievously also bust into water read
other hospitals in the dark of the night tons of rubble upon rubble in Iraq with inconsistent
electrical power still and not much clean water or chance of future power and clean water hundreds
of thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians are dead being punished for the sins of a leader who
was propped up armed and supported by many us regimes the mission mission accomplished day
or operation cod piece public relations dream for the presidential pelvic zone has turned into a
frighteningly real nightmare for so many people around the world who have had sons daughters
mothers fathers sisters brothers and oftentimes entire families wife found devastated by the
strutting and smirking terrorists who was feeling mighty chipperize that at the Washington
correspondence annual dinner as the 24 hundred soldier was being killed and as the 24 hundred
gold star mother was falling on the floor screaming for her child there are hundreds of
thousands of people on our plane who have a hard time ever feeling chipper again because of George
Bush no matter how good he looks in a flight suit now that Bush co is done such a fantastic job
with the invasion and occupation of Iraq that should never have happened in the first place
the now that it has happened is extraordinarily evil in scope and tactics he's warning Iran that if
it doesn't shape up the west is going to come and impose freedom in democracy on that country
the ra ra yes sir congress was an easy job of proving everything that George does thereby eliminating
critical thinking to pay to any semblance of rational discussion as voted for sanctions
they will need to an attack on Iran which will be devastating for our troops in Iraq and for
that poor region that had the unfortunate luck to be built upon tremendous oil and natural gas reserves
only 21 congress people voted nay on the Iran Freedom of Support Act which is incredible
considering what happened when they voted yay to give George Bush the green light for every
section against the Iraq into invaded our ran into one of the yay voters on the Iran Freedom
Support Act representative made your own and asked him why he voted that way he said because
of what he hated the evil regime of Iran I asked him about our own evil irresponsible regime
the radical president of Iran says very irresponsible and inflammatory things but viral
accounts is over a decade away from a nuclear weapon and is reigned in by the mules and the
young population of Iran to this very westernized we're in trouble with our one party system of
government which is the war party before we the people need to be subjected to another swaggering
spectacle from George after he's bombed Iran back in the stone ages and has made we the people
of the U.S. even more hated around the world it's time to rate him in ourselves congress won't do it
and the media is following a lockstep behind the murder again it's time to fire the war next
whose bloodlust could up be slated and hire people who finally use their wisdom integrity and
nonviolence to solve problems and will create image imaginary problems out of smoke and mirrors
we need to congress that'll hold George accountable not when it's complicit in the war crimes
martin Luther Keynes Jr said we must live together as brothers or perish together as fools
god protect us from the fools that we like to protect us she said Cindy she and you go Cindy

clicked on a story to print it about like three minutes ago and just as I'm talking now it's just
starting to kick out all right old style it's kicking an old style well this is the one I gave you
little tease on calling Sammy LRO I don't want to get too newsy though because that one punk he
might turn over and hear OJ of McWay talking about wearing diapers in the locker room it used to be
funny I know it calling Sammy L Ari and a liar and a master manipulator a federal judge today order
the former university professor to spend another year and a half in prison before he's deported
in his terrorism conspiracy case L Ariane 48 was sentenced to four years and nine months but it'll
get credit for the more than three years and two months he's already served while being held
before and after his trial US district judge James S Moody I wonder if he's getting a John Moody the
driver from Hazel Park James Moody delivered some harsh words for the former university of South
Florida computer engineering professor Moody said he believed that L Ariane was an active leader in a
Palestinian Islamic jihad who raised money for suicide bombings in Israel and the Palestinian
territories and lied about his involvement like Danny Gallivan would have said the Palestinian
territories dismissing the fence content that money raised by L Ariane his co-defeat and
twin support Palestinian charity said Moody said your own a connection to widows and orphans
was that you create them that's a good line that's your only that's like George Boyce that's
his only connection to widows and orphans is that he creates them very good judge you go judge
given his own show can get that damn judge Judy bitch right off the air nasty hateful
cell I like her I'm just joking five six seven as she kicks ass ancient style five six seven

I think we're going to find a really hot machine mine.
Somebody QYM?
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Yeah.
I want to tell you something, I don't know, should go on the air.
I was listening to the Air America show of ADO on the weekend.
Well, if you don't know if it should go on the air, how are we going to do there?
What am I going to dump it?
The favorite.
Oh, I want to put that here.
Hello.
Yeah, we want to hear it.
So, she said she came in contact with this new app thing that you could eat beans and
you wouldn't deal with the flat ones.
Yeah.
And then what she did was, for about 10, 15 seconds after that, she made the farting sounds
on the radio.
Well, that's because she doesn't work for Joyce.
Okay, so there you go.
That's the guy that's making farting sounds on the air because we can't.
Okay.
And she's also still all my sounders and that's okay.
Never had the original thought in her mind.
And speaking of her, by the way, I want to have our good buddies do it.
Which buddy?
Hi.
This is Jim.
That one.
Well, you know, she was confused.
I think that that's probably part of the dealer.
She was confused.
And Anna Maria still ain't interested, by the way, sweetheart.
5-670560, pound 560, the Verizon Singular wireless line.
WQYM.
Hello.
Hello.
Lucy.
WQYM.
Hello.
QYM.
Nail.
What's up, buddy?
Mexican protest day.
Yes, sir.
I know.
I know there's a lot of protests and everything going on, but what's up with the Joey
Harris and deal with?
Yeah, what is up?
That's what they're protesting about.
What's wrong with you, man?
Get with it.
That's what they're all lined up protesting about.
Those are all the illegal alien doll fans, man.
They're protesting.
They don't want no Joey Harrington, retread, reject from Detroit.
God, as he's suck.
He's so bad.
Ever see him play Josh?
Of course.
He sure can't play.
He is pathetic.
You could go out there and do a better job.
In fact, I'm your aunt here.
Even Troy DeVoy, who was running back back in the day, even he could go out there and
probably sling it better than Joey Harrington.
Joey Reynolds could probably be about a quarterback.
So all this BS that Nick Saban has played with, and, first of all, they got a reading
discontent and a hostile, banged up, injured quarterback that's going to play.
Maybe, hopefully, by the last time, by the time that they're 1-7, then he'll be ready
to step in.
You know, step back in, like Michael said.
Remember that step back in?
Mm-hmm.
And Godfather 3, which Josh did finally see, and he's out here.
Oh, and the goodness for George is your movies that has already been shipped out this
week.
Can't wait.
What's the name of it?
I forgot.
Well, whatever it is, it's the Kurt Cobain.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, the last days of Kurt Cobain, the worst movie, if you don't agree with me, that's
one of the five or 10 worst movies that's ever been made, much less than you've ever
seen.
Then you're just, you must be doing heavy-ass.
Let's play it.
There's to be scientific.
I'll get really baked before I walk into see if that chain is.
They do it even come close, okay?
Deep fried.
Might do it.
Deep fried.
Stick my head in the microwave.
Right.
WDQYM, hello.
Whatever it is, it's there.
Kurt Cobain, hello.
Now.
The worst movie.
Now.
Yeah, sorry.
Yeah.
Can I stick to middle?
It's sticking.
Neil, hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hello.
Are you a regular fan?
I said, how you doing?
I'm good.
I'm good.
This doesn't sound like Neil.
Well, what would you like me to do?
I could make them fart sounds, but Joyce won't get it as well.
Maybe they turn the radio off.
Yeah, maybe if you turn the radio off and stuck the phone to your ear instead of where you've
had it.
Yeah.
There you go.
What do you got?
Well, I just, how much is it?
It's price of what we're going to be on today.
56670560.
See it right there?
There's a reason right away.
He's from.
We're sending him back.
That's where you're going.
I'd go home and pack right now.
Okay.
Went back.
Get lost.
56670560 and pump 566 in the Verizon singular wireless line.
Guilty again today.
Oh, man.
We got guilty.
We're just petrified.
We got so much guilty.
It is really a scary thing.
And of course, exclusively on BBGI, the banjo board group Inc.
Nobody else wants it.
WDQYM, hello.
QAM.
Hey, what's up, Neil?
Yes, sir.
Hey, man.
A big fan.
This is for you for years.
I love your show.
Are you really a good two-on-most?
The things you talk about, right?
On this legal immigration thing, I can't agree with 200.
Well, what is there to disagree about?
In other words, the illegal people we ought to just let them all come in.
I've come in the law only outside of four people.
The president don't got to follow the law.
Rich white kids go to do it.
Don't got to follow the law.
Yeah.
You got to don't make no sense.
Well, what the hell does that mean?
In other words, if somebody raped somebody, they're not going to go to jail.
What are you talking about, man?
Talking crap is what you're talking.
Like Ted Bundy didn't, you know, he didn't have to follow the law.
Rich white people break the law so everybody should be allowed to.
Yeah, in some other words, when white people break the law, they don't pay for it.
Okay, just like the BTK killer that I was talking about before, who is as white as the fallen snow.
In other words, he's good religious and the president of his congregation.
The Lutheran Jesus God, the Almighty congregation there in Wichita.
You do the crime, you're a piece of slime, and you're going to do the time.
That's what it boils down to.
And if you break the law and you come into illegal, first of all, these people to show you how stupid they are,
and how they follow the leader.
Like you said before, if they were smart, they'd lay low.
Right.
They wouldn't be out there and say, but basically, the only sign they should be holding up is one that says,
I'm an illegal.
I came in illegally.
I sneaked in, grabbed me up now and get my ass out of here.
That's what they should be holding up signs.
Okay.
Truth and packaging, baby.
Illegal.
Look it up in a book, okay?
Breaking the law.
Breaking the law.
You know, not just picking the nose, not just Jay Walken.
Not just going out and diddler with their neighbor's wife or something like that.
We're talking about coming in the country illegally here.
And employers are hiring them illegally and paying them under the table, sub-minimum wage.
And of course, no taxes, no nothing.
And if that's the kind of, you know, and again, it comes back to this whole bull crap about Homeland Security.
There is no Homeland Security.
When you can't protect that border, how's anybody going to be safe?
And they build all these damn tunnels and the media is there showing us pictures of all the tunnels.
How come our border patrol ain't doing something about closing down those tunnels, huh?
Can you tell me that?
I know what would close down those tunnels real fast, okay?
Una bomba.
Let's get Richie Valens back.
What are you saying?
Una bomba grande.
I hated him.
I didn't know he could stand him.
They would make any good music at all.
No.
He had old Donna and La Bomba.
That was a middle-year-old's smash.
I didn't like them either.
No, but I would say what else do you have?
And La Bomba, that's a ripoff of like a Pope tin, so he doesn't even have credit for that.
He ain't without me good.
The battle on the banter boys, Bobby Darren and Richie Valens.
And the saddooses.
They're both skill dead. How do you like that? They're both dead. And if you play with
your balance again, you don't gonna do. I think you're at. That's right.
One-thirteen at QIM. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.16.28.
All right, this is G Gordon Lydia and they don't come any worse than Neil Rogers.
Down the town of Sayy at the Chosen Cube Cafe, I heard some trucks and stuff and
there was a lot of say. I've got a trailer for the next room.
Roll them across the marder just today. All right. Now I won't fall, won't
kill me with cross meat. Dark ones and no bubbles would read around their dreams.
I've got a trailer for the next room. If I could kill them now, I could be rich.
Made a king of mine risking her life and earning a bubble now leaving a ditch.
Just to earn a bubble now, I'm making a ditch. This could work as a bubble now, I'm making a ditch.
The one who's got his mark will work for a wall-monger.
For without the same thing as you.
I've got a trailer for the next room.
So the silver-hide is set for the right of you.
Neil has come in to a man that says, yeah, that'll seem to us.
He can work without the bill. I've got a trailer for the next room.
Mr.
...
And now we take it as a dream.
Shoot the smoke from the windshield.
Blame her job.
Or maybe get permission for her job.
There's one girl in Phoenix.
They're showing all these different periods
who's in the Phoenix and where we're else.
She's like, I guess a lot of them hold up those times.
We are the dream.
No, I think you are the nightmare.
There you go.
Not the dream.
And what this should point out to everybody
is that you got an economy which is in very large part
based on slave labor with illegal labor.
There you go.
And the grave robbing employers that hire
these people, they're the ones that are
behind bars.
It's a surftum.
Now wait till you hear this story.
As activists encourage Latinos, see there we go again.
There's that generalization now.
That's a great smear now.
Latinos in cities across America to Boycott
by walking out of their jobs, not spending any money today.
Clear channel news, talk KFI and L.A.
afternoon host John and Ken are responding
by asking what's new to do just the opposite and spend heavily
as part of their day long great Americans spend a lot promotion.
Go out there and spend until you drop.
The talk to our asking the listeners to fax or email a copy
of receipt for purchases made between noon and 7 p.m.
today at a specific time.
And we'll then enter those receipts
into a twice hourly drawing for reimbursement of their expenses.
How do you like that?
All right.
KFI.
Good play.
Home temporarily of.
Are you sure you're close personal former friend?
Huh, 1164 votes out of pool.
I mean, yeah, like I said before, the country has
that immigration policy for 30, 40 years now.
And all of a sudden there's like some rational
or some fear or some same way to solve it.
Of course not.
Why not just come up with some real laws that have some teeth
in it and just say that these people, well, you know,
good luck to you.
That's all.
We'll just look the other way.
That only because there's just too many
we can't do anything about it.
You found a whole bunch of Portuguese illegal aliens here
in Canada a few weeks ago.
Guess what they did with them deported them set it back
to Portugal.
Yeah.
No, not that there aren't plenty of illegal aliens here.
But these guys couldn't drive a cab.
1164 votes on the pool.
The star spangled banner should be sung.
And they didn't like their head gear, I guess.
In English only 693, who gives a Schmidt 169 excellent choice?
Rarely it's a bad song 156 and has a lousy beat.
Can't dance to it.
Not at all.
In any language, 128, in English or Spanish,
trace a 13.
And I hate this pool, so lamentate,
Cinque, so Tanto Cinque, five got it.
1165 vote.
We're going to go over 1200 day during the show during the show.
And you want to know why?
Because these people are pissed off and fired up, baby.
They've had it.
They don't know what they've had it about.
They know they're just pissed off.
See, if the American people get this pissed off
about things that they ought to be pissed off about,
they maybe got something done.
And we get two stolen presidential elections
back side by each.
But nobody cares about that.
And then that one early guy in the show
liked it's a big joke.
Very funny, pal.
Maybe you can get up there without president
thing next year.
Dominique QYM, hello.
Not there.
56670560.
I do like the echo though.
I'm getting used to that.
Especially from the beginning of the show.
No more crossovers.
That's it.
We're done with that.
That whole thing got so it's just, you know,
we got more important things to do with that hour.
I'm 56.
I'm just wrapping up my part cheesy game with that hour.
And pound five, 60 and leave a rise in singular wireless
line.
WDQYM, hello.
OK, two for two.
Let's try for triple QYM.
Can you get a message to the gray one for me?
Yeah, here it is.
WDQYM, hello.
NIO.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
I'm just going to give you an update.
I'm on seven street laying by my pool.
And the horns are beeping on eighth street.
Yeah.
They're beeping it off.
OK, but it is.
It's totally incredible.
Well, let me ask you something.
What are the people on eighth street?
What else has got to do with them?
Are they here illegally?
I don't know.
I guess they are on my pool.
It's a seven street beat.
Oh, I see.
It's a sympathy deal for them.
Yeah.
And they are beeping their heads off.
OK, what I just said that.
Thank you.
5, 6, 7, don't fall in.
Are they people who have been there?
Why?
Are they're beeping their heads off?
That's what I'm hearing.
They're beeping it.
No, no, Joyce.
We didn't say bleep and it was said beeping it.
You got all whipped up.
Poor Joyce.
Bitch.
WDQYM, hello.
So why aren't you and him together anymore?
No, God.
WDQYM, hello.
Yeah, there's one ought to be deported.
Send it back to Wisconsin.
Everywhere he goes, they keep sending them back to Florida.
QYM.
Yeah, one of the most amazing things to me in all of this
with these illegal immigrants is the Harold, the Sun
Sentinel, the New York.
They call it the immigration problem.
They used to even call it what it is.
The illegal immigration.
I've been saying that all along.
This is not a rally day for immigrants.
It's a rally day for illegal aliens.
Right.
I've left messages for that little mech, Tom Fiedler,
and a few others.
And I said, look, if you're not even,
I mean, the coyote of people, I did hate you like poison
at the Harold.
If you murdered Castro on nightline,
they still hate you.
Stop pandering to them.
I mean, it's illegal immigration.
I'm all for regular immigration.
But this is, and what, let me say, if you think
it's been sent to Foxwood,
saying a Mexican national anthem
with a few changes and an English.
Yeah, they wrote for that real big.
OK, pal, I agree about it.
Yeah, it's really, it's boring
as well as what it is, really ponderous.
We already got one.
Yeah, it says.
I mean, you probably made a new Mexican national anthem
for us.
Who did he?
Yeah, you'll have him.
Well, I mean, the same day I get that South Park episode
with Oprah.
I could download it right now, actually.
Download what?
The book of writing thing.
Oh, don't do that.
Because that spoils all the excitement.
It's only Monday.
We got to save something for mid week, you know,
for the midwife in mid week.
1172 votes, man.
We're like on the verge of greatness
with 1200 speaking of the great one.
The late, the late, great one.
WQAM, hello.
Hey, Bill.
Yes, sir.
What are the next two?
Do it there when they're laying off.
I beg your pardon.
What are they doing there laying out today?
What does that mean?
What do I don't understand?
It's so much the joke you're not getting it.
They don't work anyway.
Oh, that's why I didn't get it.
You could always save that up to last later if you want.
Yeah, I'll save up the life for about two or three days.
I've just thought of a real good belly laugh.
Very funny.
Dominique QYM, hello.
Hey, Mom, baby.
Yeah.
What I said before about people who think they're funny,
but it's not what he heard you talking about that day.
Yeah, right.
Dominique QYM, hello.
Yes, Neil.
Yes, man.
I think it came out with a perfect solution for this problem.
I beg your pardon?
Yeah, I saw it for president.
But what is this woman saying?
What language are you asking?
Why do you think about that?
What do I think about what?
Shavas for president.
Oh, Shavas for president.
Shavas for president.
I mean, I don't know.
So no, Chattel for president or Chavez.
Chattel for president.
Anybody with a CH?
Che Guevara.
Anybody with a yellow CH?
Pucci, Cucci.
What about what's his name?
Pugged your Rodriguez.
That's right.
His ass shrunk.
Three time.
Hey, and listen, what about the Marlins
that we got the Marlins fill the game
that I thought the Marlins have some Julio's on their team?
I would imagine I have no idea who they are.
But Miguel Cabrera, for example.
There you go.
Yeah.
Made a bigger in the game the other day.
What about Miguel Cabrera?
Is he going to be participating in the law?
I guess not.
Maybe he'll be protesting.
I guess anybody that's making like six or seven figures
probably isn't going to be protesting about whatever
is going on.
In addition to which we sure can't afford to depart.
Deport Miguel Cabrera.
No, we cannot.
Because since we only got two people on the team
that anybody ever heard of before,
ever will hear of again.
We sure can't be afford to do that.
Or we just won't get no new stadium, David.
And that's bad.
And if we don't get no new stadium,
you know what I'm going to do.
I think you're bad.
That's right.

This is Neil Rogers.
This is 516-QA.
At my junior, honey.
This is an ABC News special report.
Al Qaeda's leader in Iraq Abu Lassab Al-Zakali
appeared in a rare video released today on the Internet.
You're moving.
You celebrate what the competition is all about.
And you've moved me from the beginning.
But you've got to hand some involved performance.
Intelligence and listen Washington are examining the video.
This has been a presentation of ABC News.
1-31, Gully coming up at two.
I'm sure he's going to be able to post more to mind
that big NFL draft and on the NHL playoffs.
Any of his nose playoffs?
Pretty good games there.
How about those sabres?
I'm sure Josh is watching every second of that.
Not one.
How about that Maxif and again, Al, baby?
Yeah, he's good.
He is good.
President George W. Bush, you are.
What's the use?
It's like the band-aid boy group pink.
What's the use?
There's no point.
Crap happens, man.
Just like they keep flashing out of bottom of the screen
while they're giving this 85 hours of coverage.
This national immigrant day with that immigrant thing.
They keep saying.
They keep saying, it's not going to affect
the national economy.
No.
So what's the point?
What's the point then?
Assuming that they're right.
And it's not going to offend the national?
Well, other than proving that they can screw off
from work, we got people right here at QA.
And we screw off from work, whatever they feel like.
Maybe that's the whole idea.
Maybe that's the protest.
Oh, is that it?
Well, maybe we'll go back to work.
Somebody's going to say, hey, screw you.
Now it's turn around a bitch.
President George W. has approved Dubai's $1.24 billion
takeover of Don Casters, a British engineering company
with US plants that supply the Pentagon,
the White House and Friday.
You see, they couldn't get the other Dubai port
scale through.
So now, by hook or by crook, see the way they do it?
One way or two other.
That's right.
The decision announced by one house spokesman,
Scott McClendon, followed a congressional
uproar over security fears that sculled another Dubai state
on companies planned to acquire operations
at major US ports.
The Interagency Committee on Foreign Investments
in the US and its confidential recommendation
that the Dubai takeover of Don Casters
to Bush April 13.
Bush's decision followed around with goes on and on.
The right goes.
The Bushes and the Bin Laden's baby,
the Bushes and what's his name, Bandar Bush,
all of them Saudi rag here.
That's what it's all about.
All about oil.
What did I tell you?
Is the minute they went in there,
OIL and MONY, and people said,
what is that fact now, huh?
Nighttender that?
Yeah, you did.
And the growing international crisis over
Rand's nuclear program,
contributed catastrophic oil price spike,
sending crude prices over $100 a barrel.
Oh my God.
Senior Wall Street analysts are warning.
With prices already around 72 bucks a barrel,
such an increase could mean drivers facing prices.
Of obviously, now this is a British thing,
so I don't know what that means.
According to the Petrol Retailers Association.
Last week, Lord Brown,
chief executive of BP, one that prices could rise to a pound.
As the unveiled bumper, that's a pound a liter.
Well, that's the pound a liter would be about four pounds
and a pound is almost two bucks.
See what I'm with that translates to a gallon?
Eight bucks.
Yeah, there you go.
So if you think it's bad, a three bucks,
or three, a little over three,
how are you gonna like it with eight bucks a gallon?
See, 16 times eight is $100 a gallon.
I'm sorry, 128.
Is that right?
I'll take your word for it.
I'm so good at it, man.
Yeah, 128.
I'm so good at that.
128 bucks to fill up a 16 gallon tank.
Well, thanks a lot, Mr. President.
A single political shock could be enough
to send oil markets into panic
since Adam Semensky,
senior energy economist at Deutsche Bank in New York.
If we have one more big problem,
we're gonna have triple digit oil prices.
As he points to confrontation with Iran,
a worsening of the situation in Iraq,
or recurrence of devastating hurricanes
in the Gulf of Mexico
as potential catalyst for a major rise.
And he also said,
you're mama's those socks in the hill.
Whatever you might buy that.
How do you like that, huh?
He said, what do you think of those Saudis?
And this guy said,
hubbim and dread.
5670560, pound 560,
and they've arrived in singular wireless line.
We got 1199 on there.
The 1200 vote today gets a big prize, okay?
Do you believe it?
Not believe it.
No.
1201, see it,
but it hopped over, see a little hop over.
Went from 1199 to 1201.
Whoever was in there at 1200, we apologize.
We were gonna like freeze it right there
and check out who it was
and bring you like a million dollars cash
and small bills to your house.
But too late.
How many QAM, hello?
QAM, deadline one, man.
Mark it down a little bit of a problem.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Woo, wee, man, it is good.
It is really good to be working in this place.
5670560, pound 560 in the Verizon
and singular wireless line.
It's Banjo Boy Group Inc, baby.
And maybe your greatest invention of all time.
B-B-T-I, Banjo Boy Group Incorporate.
Where, where, where, yeah, he beat me again.
I was just, I was just, I was just reaching for it.
I love that part too, right?
I was just gonna write a strumming.
W-Q-A-M.
I love you, Neil.
Yeah.
Okay, good call.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
Q-A-M.
Yeah, hello, Neil.
Yeah, yes sir.
How are you doing?
Okay.
Uh-uh, he called me off-guard, I've been sitting on the phone
for a while.
Now I'll come back a minute later on when you got something to say.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
I'm not, I'm not speaking for someone.
Oh, there, it's not like there's a strumming on a guitar.
Is this the right thing to say?
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
That is the G.
Yeah, W-Q-A-M, hello.
Hey, nearly happy Monday, buddy.
Back to you.
I've been in that a lot, my truck all day.
Did you see the thing, I think it was in the Boston World
where something about, about how bush sign, like 750 laws
and all those laws?
It was on our website, it's old news, yeah.
No, it didn't sign 750, broke 750 laws, get it right, Schmuck.
He broke 750 laws, it's right on our website.
Even Josh remembers that story, right?
Yeah, I remember that one.
God, what is wrong with you people anyway?
That's the American, forget about the Star Spangled Banner.
That's the National Anthem and you know, something that transcends all languages.
That's right.
Even Sanskrit, it all comes out the same.
That's it, that's the American National Anthem.
Right, that'll be the Bupin about.
That's it, work on it, practice it, sing it loudly.
70 Q-A-M, hello.
Hey, how's it going?
Yes sir.
Hey, is this the Dolphin and I thought a draft post came true?
No, it's not, that's coming up in two.
Hey, are you clear?
Jesus.
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
Ar-Hali-Sto-N-O-T-R-A-E.
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
Hey, Neil.
You know, they're doing illegal stuff anyway.
Think about it, the big companies are having these phone operations from India.
Right, that's what it's called outsourcing is an ice name for it.
It means what they're doing is taking your jobs and they're giving to a lot of other
people.
Yeah, the one with the papers, at least to these people, we get some money to find some
of our products in their industry.
Yeah.
I mean, if the people in their country identify that.
So in other words, you're saying we shouldn't have an immigration policy, which is
what anybody gets here, we should just give them an honesty and have a workers program
for anybody who can crawl into the borders, you idiot.
Jesus, God.
There, there, there for another words.
As long as we're outsourcing, as long as that's bad and take it away, we're conjunct.
Let's just let all these sluppers come in here.
And by the way, make a whole bunch of babies because keep the Pope happy.
Now, that's another thing that nobody even factors in, you know.
All these illegal aliens who come from Latin America with their 17 children and each
one of them is going to have another 15, 20 children because the Pope keeps telling them
about it, but it will make a lot of Catholic babies, baby.
You know about that.
But that's why that's why.
Listen, why do you think that happened?
You think he's going to sit back and let you have go through life with one kid?
He's not going to permit that.
I didn't meet my quota.
You didn't even come close.
He was staring to think you were like Chinese or something like that.
So we put a different slant on your life.
This is Neil Rogers.
Fox solid is 5.62.
8.
2.
3.
4.
You know what I mean about people reproducing, overproduced-area classic example right there?
She's pregnant again, good old Brittany.
Maybe you can drop both of them at the same time.
It's all over for her.
I'm not good.
Try it again tomorrow.
Way fewer people hanging out at pick-up trucks today.
5667-0560, but it's business really slow with those cock fights in
Hylia.
Tom died of 60 and he was rising in the singular wireless line.
WDQ-YM, hello.
Q-A-N.
Oh, is that a nice sound?
Nice, clean.
Sound of death.
WDQ-YM, hello.
Hey, Neil, how you doing today?
Okay, sir.
I've heard something important today about my business.
Those guys didn't show up to work today and I think I can run it by myself.
I may not need them.
There you go, excellent.
Why weren't something kind of important today?
Look how much you're going to save, man.
There you go.
You have a great day, sir.
Send half to us.
Thank you.
There you go.
Maybe some of these people will show up to how unneeded they are.
Think that's possible?
Oh, sorry.
Anybody at Q-A-N not show up?
Everybody in this corner of the building.
Everybody at Q-A-N showed up today.
None of our people out there marching or playing golf or
screwing off trying to like, you know, the big O not only was he on this morning, but then
again later on right before our show.
That's right.
I'm tape, of course, but nevertheless, that's his anti-his protest.
He was doing double duty.
He was doing a double duty.
I think I heard you do that, David.
560.
460.
560.
And they've arrived in Singular.
Wireless line.
It's a big day for the Irish, baby.
The whole thing is just so stupid.
It's just pathetic.
It's just tragic.
I'm looking at these people and they got their American flags and a lot of Mexican flags.
And then they all got these pre-made cardboard signs or hold up.
And they're waving to the cameras and posturing the cameras and yadda yadda.
Oh, look at that.
There's Luis Alberto Diarrhea, author of the Devil's Highway.
Luis Alberto of the Devil's Highway.
And that's exactly what it is, man.
They got those tunnels.
I still say, man, can't they just close them tunnels up?
It makes sense to you.
Sure does.
No, they keep digging more.
You know, they're hard workers.
Yeah, it's hard work.
W-Q-Y-M, hello.
The camera's here.
Hey, Dale.
Yes, sir.
Yeah.
Shouldn't lunch live on the end jail right now.
Yes, but again, the guy to call before that was all bad out of shape about Duke and the other half.
That's the guy he should have been talking about.
Rich White guys like Lardass, Limbaugh.
Okay, Rich Pill-Pop and...
People could have called.
Like Lardass, should be in jail.
But he got a tap on a wrist and no surprise.
You really expecting he was going to do jail time or anything?
No.
Of course not.
W-Q-Y-M, hello.
Dale.
Yes, sir.
Unfortunately, the truth is they don't tell you who the organizers are among these people,
the left-wing, the communist, you know, is making some...
The New Black Panthers are behind us, too.
Did you...
What is that all about?
to New Black Panthers. What the hell is that?
What has a back and offshoot of the Black Panthers?
No, that's original, but what the hell is the need for that?
We already got Jesse Jackson, what do we need them for?
Sturvoge or racial craft? The New Black Panthers in North Carolina,
because of what allegedly happened to Duke, the alleged rape
from his brother's credibility on a scale of zero is minus infinity.
And right away, let's turn into a big racial thing.
Let's go out and attach him to La Crosse players.
What do you say? That's a plan. There you go. Let's rape him.
There, or you just take him out to the nearest tree.
They'll just be hanging for a while.
1224 votes. That's pretty damn impressive.
Yes, me.
National Anthem, man, it's a piece of crap.
It's a bad song. Even Francis Scott Key and what kind of name is that like Francis?
Except for Francis over here.
The star-spangled batter should be sung in English only.
Speaking English, speaking English, 722.
Who gives this from it? 186.
Rarely, it's a bad song. It's as little as possible, 162.
And quit that invocation at the ballgame, too, at the dolphin games, you idiots.
The NFL, with their immigrant, with their invocation.
How about an immigration invocation? Only illegal illegals can sing it.
In any language, 136, it sounds the same.
English or Spanish, still 13, Tracy.
It has moved in a long time now. Remember Tracy?
Who? And I hit this pool of five, Tracy Caracito.
Oh, yeah.
Kind of a name was that, by the way, Caracito.
That sounded a little bit like one of your people.
Oh, it was a fan, and he was a fan, you're from it's,
a fan, you're a fan, you're, he may have been spoke with a little bit of a defect.
He did, and he played Highline.
He had a Palota and a Sesta.
Wow. You know what they say? In Sesta is Vesta.
That's what they say at the Palota place.
What your sister to the testa?
Right. Well, I don't want to get Joyce all that out of shape now.
See, you almost learned me tonight.
I went down the old Hershey Highway.
It was bad. It's so easy.
Now, I kept my honor.
I restrained myself. That's right.
W-W-W-Q-A-M. Hello.
That is Q-A-M?
Yes, sir. Q-A-M.
This is really Clark.
Who's that?
I got to come into make about demonstration.
And what is that? What'd you like to say?
I like to say, we are two to become in the land of the Himphideos.
And we have to demonstrate out on the street to support long breakers.
They're excellent. Very well put, sir.
In Fidel and how with Fidel too, while you're at it.
Having a big made it. I don't think it's any coincidence.
I think this guy before would just come at least to come at this day.
Had a good point.
I think the commies are coming back. Don't you?
I'll find one under every rock.
Especially in Hylia.
Steve Faction says they just got back from Luchabai local deli.
All the immigrants were in the kitchen working away.
Well, excellent. Actually, some immigrant.
I see it's very difficult because they keep confusing immigrants or legal aliens.
Okay.
Who did know for immigration?
Okay. One delivered my lunch at the table on my way there.
I passed. What is it? I think he said past.
I pasted some other immigrants moving lawns and building houses.
I believe he means past.
He says pasted. He pasted them.
I would imagine the immigrants who are protesting.
You're just looking for another reason to have a day off.
I think that's it.
I supported an American deli.
The day in life, I'll go on with immigrants. Go to work or not.
I think if the illegal immigrants would spend as much time trying to become legal
US citizens that they are protesting, they might not be out of a day's work.
And what about the companies that are.
Yeah, that's a good point.
If these people are working for such starvation wages, how can they afford to be taken off today?
We sure as hell couldn't be afford to take it off.
They even go play golf.
I know I couldn't.
The way Jose.
Even with his new contract, Josh Cordist still showed up.
So, shouldn't they be held accountable in some way?
What a wacky country this has become and says Steve.
And Steve, you are.
I'm so resistant.
You're finger right on it and it is Steve.
He twisted away.
Twist in the right away. Who did that?
Twist in the right away.
Who did that?
Same cook.
Am I right?
I'm checking.
No, you're not going to have that.
That's, we've got to be a 50 song, ain't it?
Or maybe early 60s.
I'm going to look it up.
Oh.
That's not my sam cook to me.
It is.
It is.
62.
What a man we man.
We Sam.
Oh, you don't seem to worry about shouting the motel or something.
Okay, that's enough of Sam cook.
Who did you go to bed?
You want to know Bobby Duranau.
And he sure as hell wasn't no Dianne Woolworth.
He didn't have no psychic hotline.
This is Neil Rogers.
What, what, what solid is 516 QA?
Holy crap.
Holy crap.
The God.
We want the world for me and the earth.
We'll cut your grass for me and the earth.
Well, they have the best and everything.
And don't they come and do America to cut your lawn.
They'll make your leaves and wash your car.
Trying to avoid the ill-gracious star.
They'll boil it up and they'll stop it.
They'll stop it.
I used to wear things into one with a job.
We won't give all the kids a baby to download or two.
We can ship them all down the other end of the game.
Let them move and win if they can change.
Yeah.
Holy, open the door.
He won't be the star.
Well, they've all grown across the indiretors.
You're the color that they will never good if you watch yours.
At all the suns and all the fun.
All they want to do is want to be clean and done.
They're for the hot and they'll know stop it.
They'll make us fit for the fair and clean.
That's why they started putting on a string.
Go ahead and give them all of these up.
Let them move and win if can change.
Yeah.
All those very quite cold things that commit very serious crime.
We get away with them now.
Like OJ, for example.
Here's a good example for you.
Got some good news.
Yeah.
Common cause and non-profit government watchdog group filed a criminal complaint with the Department of Justice today against Representative Catherine Harris.
All right.
The groups complained that Harris was bribed by a defense contractor who's already plagued guilty, deriving former Representative Duke cutting him.
It led to that Harris broke the law when the contractor paid 2800 bucks for fundraising dinner to Congresswoman Hill.
And as you know, the Duke was recently since the years in prison.
Not to mention those problems with the last past the 2000s.
That's all right.
And then he ran just goes with the territory.
We got the gildy coming up next.
That goes with the territory.
And we got mad dog at Ford.
The Marlon game.
Come on.
Get out there and support the Marlon's judge.
You go over the game tonight.
No.
Why?
I can watch from TV, man.
Marlon's in the Phillies baby.
You don't want to lose in a rich waltz.
And by the way, whoever's running the board today at least please.
Yeah, we got three drops, man.
Wait for all of it.
Well, whatever.
And let us at least play the illegal ID or...
I think you're ass.
Bye, bye, bye.
