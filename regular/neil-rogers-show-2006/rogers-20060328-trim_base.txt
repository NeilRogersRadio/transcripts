All right, 958 on sports radio, 560 QAM.
Or should say 560 as we go to Neal now.
It was somewhere in a while.
Well, but if you just say 560, what does that mean?
The most important part of the day, the real 560.
Non-sports.
Oh. So how many hockey clubs you get this morning?
None.
No.
And I brought it up.
Six and a roll, man.
They win every game.
They find the way to the bar and fill the run.
And they already came out.
No, they rented a heap.
That's what they care about.
Get out of here.
If there wasn't any heated all, they still wouldn't care.
That's not so.
Okay.
Yeah, it's just not.
They just don't care.
They care about the heat, believe me.
Okay.
They care about it.
Yeah.
But he's part of the heat.
Well, how come they don't care about...
Guilty.
He does the Panther games.
Do you care about him?
About who?
Guilty?
Yeah.
He's okay.
He's no mole.
What the hell?
He's probably guilty.
You got a problem with him now?
No.
I got a problem with the New Sales Manager.
He's...
What was the other guy you called him?
He's Stiffy?
Yeah.
This is Stiffy with the Southern Droll.
The...
Yeah, that's right.
That's the only change of the accent.
I'm hearing that nasty echo again.
Air every day for like...
This is the second or third week in a row.
Air every stinking day.
Echo.
Echo.
Echo.
Let's crack it up real loud.
Oh, now I hear it.
Huh?
Well, yeah, you hear it now because I got to my...
I made it.
I created it.
So what's going on with you today?
Marlins, baby.
We love those Marlins.
They're really great.
1250 Marlins.
I'll deck them Marlins in the Metting Jupiter.
Oh, yeah.
Early day, that means off the woodbind plunging my guts out.
So while I've been on the area, I noticed that there is a resignation in the White House.
Yeah, Andy Card, big deal.
Oh.
Yeah, Bush is shuffling the deck and this card fell out.
Very good.
Andy Card, and that cute...
Yeah, like it's a big deal.
Like it's going to make a big difference.
Nobody cares.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Yeah, I'm going to tell you seriously.
Troist Radford, I very seldom get as angry as...
Yeah, you know, the sales department pisses us all off because they're incompetent.
They're idiots.
But I may just have to hire a hitman to take care of this guy.
He's just...
Everything that I've worked for 30 years, I think it's very appropriate that it's right on the heels of this 30th anniversary.
Every single thing that I've worked to a build for 30 years, they're dismantling it right now.
So I've taken down the Berlin Wall.
That's what they're doing to me.
But again, take them out into the bank.
Then I got my tax returns for my tax guy yesterday.
Yeah.
Got a FedEx package.
Got a huge, the biggest refund ever coming in my life.
Huge.
Kind of like winning the Progressive Jackpot at Woodbind.
So I feel pretty good about that.
That's good.
Now you'll have extra money for that.
Give me some good plunging money for the summertime for that tough summer schedule.
Those two at two weeks.
You know, the football players get those two at A's.
I got those two at weeks.
Do you have a plan yet?
What do you mean?
Where are you going to go?
What do you mean where I'm going to go?
I'm not going, what does that mean?
Where I'm going to go?
You've got someplace in the summer.
Oh, I'm going to Berlin.
Oh, thank you very much.
Yeah.
Well, we got the World Cup.
Ah, you like Berlin now.
I love Berlin.
What do you mean I like Berlin now?
I've been going there for years.
But you know, you like, you've talked about going to Italy.
You've talked, of course, about Amsterdam.
But Berlin seems to have replaced those places.
Berlin, Cologne.
I love Germany.
I don't like Frankfurt or Hamburg so much, especially Frankfurt.
That was horrible.
I had the best time of my life in Berlin.
Yeah, and what's not to like, man?
It's a great place.
And it's just a wonderful city.
Yep.
Well, that's a course that we bombed it into the Stone Age in the world.
And it was a great place for us.
So they had to rebuild all those things.
So it's beautiful and modern and just great.
It's very nice.
Anybody on any, anybody under the age of 40 is great.
The old people are still like goose stepping.
You know, they're still, they can just tell.
You get that feeling.
They're still all goose stepping a little bit.
Yep.
Okay, what I'm saying.
Kind of like the US government.
Goose stepping.
I don't know if I ever told you this in up.
And when I went there years ago with the doffens,
they had a preseason game there.
And I was working for a channel four at TVJ.
And I did a feature on a guy who had been watching the he watched the wall come down
He was a New York advertising executive and he moved to Germany and opened a chain of hot dogs stands in Eastern zone
Because they didn't have hot dogs in Germany. They have worst right other well every street corner is another
Brot worst store. Yeah, but worst. Yeah, well I love those bratwurst man
There's nothing like it. You can't get I don't care where you go. You cannot get the bratwurst like in Berlin
That's right, but he brought high grades over there and he was very successful and he got the t-shirt concession at checkpoint Charlie
In fact, there's one place where I go. It's right next to a big supermarket where they have
Curry worst which is you know, and they what they do is they slice up the bratwurst and then they put
Curry stuff in with an I don't want any part of the salt and they get very insulted if you tell me you want
Brotwurst. Oh, man. No, I have brought was just a curry worst
So what you do is you say curry worst without the curry. Curry worst with mustard. Yeah, instead of the curry because I hate curry
Oh
Cabbage is not bad. Yeah, they'll keep you regular. Yes
The food there actually is going
That's amazing. It's just amazing to me that Germany and Netherlands are like side by each the right next to each other
Mm-hmm, and yet Germany's got such tremendous food and
Well, I mean the food in Holland is just the worst I've ever had in my life the world's worst
Horrible you have to really search to find an edible meal. I'm not just talking about good
I'm talking about edible even Mickey D's looks good even with a rat running around it there under the fryer deep fryer
Oh, God. Yeah, there's the same rat. It's like a pet I think
On the dam rack he runs around under the deep fryer just to make you feel at home
I guess and then right next to that is killer flu chicken
That great the way that American enterprises poisoning the whole world is good. We're killing everybody
This is kind of a silent warfare
It may take a while. We're going to eliminate them by attrition
Power lack of nutrition. Yeah, kind of like a few M sales department

It had its moment US Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia startled reporters in Boston just minutes after attending a mass
Sunday by flipping a middle finger to his critics
This is the
holier than now Antonin Scalia all of he does go duck hunting with a vice president
A Boston hailed reporter asked a 70 year old conservative Roman Catholic have he faced as much questioning over
impartiality when it comes to issues separating church and state
You know what I say to those people Scalia replied making me obscene gesture and explaining that Sicilian
I didn't know that did you know that thought the Sicilian salute was with the
Well, maybe he was doing this is so you know when he was given the he was given the one finger salute
Okay, that's one of your head when the high court was caught making the gesture by a photographer
Maybe that's right. I don't know. Let's throw him on the right side. I'm just looking a middle finger to his
Well, then that's not so silly
Propaganda picture by photographer with a pilot the archdiocese of Boston's newspaper
Oh, yeah, I'm sure we'll see that real soon. Don't publish that Scalia told a photographer
I'm sure they'll go right along with that he was attending a special mass felores and politicians at the cathedral the holy cross

He'd even want to heat absolutely stunk
The interest in the panthers on a scale of zero is minus infinity

I hear so many and I like the

I like the snores that say my bad, clumsy pain
In fact I sleep through every chance to lie
I hear the guy like the snores I like the snores
1045 at 560 WM you know they it's interesting with that if I'm not mistaken that that beast snoring drop in is
Was for real for real right he fell asleep on the air and
Which is easy to do when you're talking sports hey 1046 14 before 11 o'clock talk a lot faster
We got the Marlon game in less than in two hours and what four minutes nothing we're counting holy crap
So guess what I did during that break not a douce no no nothing like that. Oh not yet right right there in the chair
Ordered a case of that pasta
I get you dream George got on there and order the dream fields pasta believe you me you'll love it
It's it tastes exactly like right like good quality regular pasta. That's all I need to know and
You know just don't go crazy. I mean all over your case you don't have to worry right now about carbs stuff like that
But it's good for you do you yeah got an issue no do you have an issue what do you do a new study from Jacobs media
Asked over 25,000 respondents from over 75 rock formatted radio stations about the response to Howard Stern's jump to serious
And they said are you cereal the result show that Stern's move the winemain. Uh oh no no
They don't want to be like driven snout now. I know what I'm trying to read. Yes somebody might say
It's uh you think it might be okay, but it's not the result show that Stern's move has indeed helped the satcaster
Patrice or pasty subscriber rate of xm among rock fans. Hi ever roughly 70% of Stern's regular listeners say they have not followed him and stuck with commercial radio morning shows
The study shows that the popularity of series and xm basically are dead even each with six percent of those who say they're likely to subscribe this year
Series does rank ahead of xm. All the xm's got 80 billion channels on arrow nose picking channels
Unsurprisingly Stern is the key factor in serious subscriptions decided by a third of respondents
However the study also shows that Stern fans who plan on switching to serious most of them already have done so
Most of his fan survey who were following him to series have already signed up for the smaller percent same
They'll buy serious later in the year looking just at markets where Stern was on the year in 2005
A fifth of those survey to consider themselves regular listeners to show have already subscribed to series with one and ten
Indicating they plan to do so
According to a Jacob study
This is a strong indicator that for commercial radio broadcasters and former Stern markets the worst is over
However the majority of Stern's formula to regular listeners have just stayed with the rest of your radio morning shows in their market
So once the ratings come out many morning shows should expect growth in their audience faces in Stern's absence
On average defections to serious for no greater among listeners of former Stern stations
However some former Stern stations were able to retain a much higher percentage of his audience for his replacements
In other cases defections were quite higher than average
It's got charts and graphs and but it'd be but it'd be but about the this station in that market
46% of regular Stern listeners have stayed with the station's new morning show whatever you know they replaced him with
Three of Stern's former competitors are their morning shows attract almost six of every ten of his ex-lushners
Acquited Jacob's this could indicate that the upcoming round of arbitrarian ratings will show some very impressive growth among morning shows in recent months
So they're kind of like flattened out
The big semester we're all going out of business big see if we have problems here at QA and it's not got under new with XM and serious
That's it right now even with that stiff competition from far out how can we compete with far out? You know what I'm saying right

I'm aware he was taken somewhere where he'll be safe far away
Deputy Attorney General Mohamed Ishak Aloko said the prize is there anybody over there not name Mohamed
Anybody said prosecutors had issued a letter calling for washmans for these because he was mentally unfit to stand trial
He also said he didn't know where washman had gone after being released but they sure like to find him for a little chat
He said Rothman maybe sent overseas for medical treatment
On Monday hundreds of clerics students and others chanting death to Christians
March through the northern afghan city of Mazir Aisha reef to protest the court decision sunny to dismiss the case

There's another one from the nearby northern city of Kanduz the Christian foreigners occupying Afghanistan are attacking our religion

You know what I'm saying?
What he said
Oh
Doug Thompson writes, the continued madness of King George
This is Capitol Hill Blue, your very favorite website
If you turn you around on that
With all the public fear over his use of the National Security Agency to spy on Americans and the near mutiny and the Republican Party over his high handed approach to the presidency
You think George W. Bush might have learned a thing or two about the dangers of arrogance
Now, not our despot in Chief King W. When he signed the extension of the USA Patriot Act in the law he added his own addendum to the law that says
He doesn't have to tell time was a damn thing about what he and his dorm troopers are up to when it comes to abusing the expanded police powers and including the bill
After the public ceremony Bush issued a signing statement that reiterated an impact Bush's belief that the Constitution is just a gd piece of paper
He doesn't feel constrained by a law or obligated by provisions of the act that require a uniform congress in a timely manner
I'm just what the FBI and other parts of his American Gestapo were up to when it comes to snooping into the private lives of Americans
The executive branch will construe the provisions I call for furnishing information to entities outside the executive branch
In a matter of consistent with the president's constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch and withhold information from Congress and of course the public
Bush said Bush says he'll withhold information if he and only he decides disclosure would impair foreign relations, national security, the deliberative process of the executive or the performance of the executive's constitutional duties
The president's latest display of I am above the law arrogance might have gone unnoticed because most of the media concentrate on the public
Trump and circumcised that ignored the real story Charlie Savage of the Boston Globe was one of the few who reported on the signing statement
Yet Savage's story fell off the media landscape with a resounding thud as the rest of the mainstream was apparently cow-toed by Bush's threats to all reporters and editors in front of grand juries if they dear
Right about his abuse of the Constitution and the use of US spy agencies to snoop on Americans stuck with reporting on the president's latest road show to sell the failed Iraq war
Frankly, I'm surprised that political scientist George Harley who worked in the Nixon and Reagan White Houses I thought the story would have legs and get much more attention
After all the debate in Congress over the need for the president to keep them in the loop he simply signs away one of the key provisions of the revised act
The revised USA Ppud Act emerged from Congress of the number of oversight provisions requiring the president to report to the Hill on a strict timetable
One of those provisions said the White House had to tell Congress just how the FBI used the expanded wiretapping surveillance powers granted under the act
Some in Congress like Senator Patrick Leahy are pissed off his health at the president's claim that he's above the law
The president's signing statements are not the law and Congress should not allow them to be the last word Leahy said in a statement issued by the Orifice
The president's constitutional duty is to faithfully execute the laws is written by the Congress not to cherry pick the laws he decides he wants to follow
It is our duty to ensure by means of congressional oversight that he does so
Constitution law professors say Bush could be bluffing but history shows that Bush bluffs first and then goes ahead and does what he wants if nobody calls the bluff
David Golov a New York University law professor and expert on presidential power
She was told a Boston Globe that Bush's actions display a mind-bogglingly expansive conception of his power and the White House's blatant disregard for the role of Congress
On the one hand they deny that Congress even has the authority to pass laws on these subjects like torture and eavesdropping
In addition to that they say Congress is not even in television information about anything to do with the war on terrorism
Golov said Bush's actions are just another example of a madman who appears determined to destroy the Constitution and a country called America
Unfortunately this madman will continue to wreak havoc until somebody puts a stop to his insanity since dark times stop the insanity

Well, you already teased it what if it's what I think you're gonna start out about Casper Weinberg. Oh no, he's dead something else. Okay
No, who cares about him? Maybe it's old enough. He was the secretary of state. He's dead long time ago
Woman gets a hundred dollar ticket for a bumper sticker that I can't say but I can spell it on the year. Okay?
B-U-S-H-I-T
Denise Queer is a nurse at Emory University. I can't say it can I though oh?
Denise Queer is a nurse at Emory University Hospital in Georgia on marks tense
He was driving home from dinner when a DeCalb County police officer pulled her over at least initially
I was just surprised because I had done anything wrong. She's it when he approached the car
He had his hand on his weapon and I was in my nurses uniform with a stethoscope around my neck
Sounds like something from crash. Mm-hmm. He asked for my license and then said any idea why I stopped you
I said no you have a lured decal on your car
He said Greer said she immediately thought that one of her kids had put something nasty on her bumper as a joke
Then he mentioned the bush thicker she said the one that says I'm tired of all the
B-U-S-H-I-T the story first reported by Joe Johnson to the Athens banner hero that says remember Joe Johnson
I was talking about him just the other day. Yes
Greer said she told the officer it wasn't lured and that it was clearly a political statement when he insisted it was lured
She said I'm not going to discuss this any further just give me the ticket which he did under offense
It said lured decals the tickets for a hundred bucks Greer has no intention of paying it
I'm so appalled that the officers attempt to squash my freedom of speech
He told the banner hurled elaborating to the progressive rear says people are wrong to view this in a partisan way
I'm not just it's not just a Democrat Republican issue. She says y'all need to get beyond that
It's my right to speak in yours y'all need to get beyond that she said y'all
Jerry Weber the legal director of the ACLU of Georgia's representing Greer the indicators are that the officer didn't like her
Views of president Bush and that was the motivating factor he says Weber says the ticketing was clearly ill legal and totally
Acceptable they labeled unacceptable. He says the Georgia Supreme Court struck down the Lut bumper sticker statute way back in 1991
In a case involving a defendant who had a Schmidt happens bumper sticker
They shouldn't keep happening 15 years later he says after the criminal cases over
Weber says he and Greer may file a civil rights claim good. Sue their ass billions of dollars. Okay bring that
Jackass down
Leave the Cal County police department wouldn't discuss the facts of the case
We won't don't comment other officers ticket set officer Herschel's grand gen who handles media affairs
The officer is making his decision on the street that's going through legal channels now
By the way, this is in the first time someone in Greer's family's gotten trouble over a bumper sticker last year or 20 year old
Sun was pulled over in Athens, Georgia for having a bumper sticker that said oh, no, I can't read that don't do it
Signed out with cyber. I'll try to do the best I can all right
Vorschux
Period cheney too
When you like that, well, that's good it is good and very sad I can't read it. It's a new story. I still can't read
Because I don't get Joyce
She says the police officer told her stun if you don't remove the bumper sticker
I'm taking you to jail so he removed it. He thought it was kind of funny
She says though she told him she'd rather hand go to jail and take her bumper sticker off Greer has a court date of April 18
How do you like that? That's a good one

Randy Beans Ma of Love Child
Yankee Ace Sui X Gallup Pal over payments for girl 16
This is in the New York Daily News
Randy Johnson, did we put him on air or not?
Yeah, we put him on air
And he's got one vote probably her, probably the daughter
Randy Johnson has a secret love child
Well, if it's good enough for Jesse Jackson, well, you're good enough for Randy, huh?
And the Yankee superstar is playing a hard ball with the girls' mom was revealed yesterday
The famous heroine left you make 16 million a year as Sui X's girlfriend Laura Rozel
for less than 100 grand in child care payments for their daughter Heather
Now 16, according to Corvip papers revealed by the smoking gun website
Oh, really, Roberto Rozel or as a Laurel's mother told that he tried New Year's Day
But told the lawsuit, that sounds like Randy
In fact, the original headline on this story was
Big Unit has a small unit
Really?
Yes, that's cute
The striking troll athletic looking teen refused to talk when she came to the door of her family's home
Overlooking a picturesque bay in Washington State
The big unit yesterday admitted fathering the childering in a fair when he was a
Lanky rookie with an asked the fast ball in a bright future
But Johnson insisted he's always tried to do right by the girl despite his mind dispute with her mama
I do acknowledge I have a daughter from a previous relationship which ended years before my marriage
Johnson for a two-zennestayman
I fully financially supported her and have made every effort to protect her privacy
Laura Rozel, 46, is working at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab in Northern California
When she started going out with Johnson, a Californian that made it in late 88
She broke up with the future super star midway through a pregnancy and called a daughter
His dark little secret in an interview with the smoking gun, his little dark secret
What do you mean?
I'm saying that a little bit on the way up there, we don't have no picture
No
Rozel said Johnson only saw the girl one soon after her birth and said that he never made any effort to be involved in her life
Nope, nothing ever she told her wife someone asked about Johnson's relationship to the girl
Court papers reveal that Johnson first agreed in 1997 to pay five grand a month in child support for
Heather Rozel, plus another 750 bucks in monthly daycare expenses
Laura Rozel claimed things turned sour last year when she asked the all started by Heather Recarr and put the bill for community college classes
He fired back with illegal equivalent of a high-hard fastball
The man named that she retired about 71 grand in daycare payments
Plus 26 grand in interest because the teen was too old to be in daycare legal paper show
Yeah, I don't think when you're 16 you go to daycare, do you?
My daughter was 16 hasn't been in daycare for at least five years Johnson said legal after they've filed paperwork third
Rozel should not have received a windfall for expenses that she didn't incur you go unit
Johnson known for intimidating opposing her with his icy stare and a hundred mile hour fastball became a board again Christian in 1992 after the death of his father
He married his wife Lisa soon after with the couples got four children
The sometimes ornery six foot ten hurler got off to a bad start with the New York media last year
When he grappled with the photographer in the TV cameraman after signing with the bombers
Observers will be funneled at Johnson with foul lawsuit over what amounts to chum change for the millionaire all while risking a wanted publicity on intensely private matter
He had an uneven season last year but is the ace of the bomber staff penciled in the start opening day
Well, he's the ace of their staff maybe they'll have a bad year with only hope and pray
Oh God, the Yankees
Oh man, oh Larry bird, okay, let's get him on there right away
Got him on her yet?
He's out there
Facts is not only is Larry bird any literate racist but he's also a deadbeat dead he needs to be on today's pool
Also, even if he wasn't a little bit or it wasn't a racist white guys who played basketball are like black Republicans, gay Republicans, female Republicans, Jewish Republicans, etc.
Complete any jackballs who should be taken out in a shot
Wow, there's no need for them on this earth
Well, what about the y'all and the Chinese guy for Houston? What's his name? Y'all mean? Y'all? Y'all? Y'all? Y'all come back?
So yeah, Larry bird, I hate him, I want to smash his face and it says I feel better not have a great effing day
Ha ha ha ha, right!
Get it out of your chest
That's the idea with these poles baby, get it out of your system, turn it loose
Like what's your name used to say, Sammy Smith, he's dead now and that song helped me make it through the night, turn it loose
That's that culture thing, you know, turn it loose and uh oh God

Oh, sorry
It wasn't a talk radio in those days or in these days
Good choice, me either
Help me make it, oh boy that was something
He had like a one book, he had a 33 share during Wittsner
What does that tell you about the old parts?
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, run to a lot of pressure here man
We got less than an hour before that pregame
57 minutes but who's counting right?
But we just weaned a few of these very important calls
Although I don't want to put any more names on this list
We got almost 1200 votes already, that indicates to me we got more than enough idiots on there for you to hate
We don't need any more hate targets right?

This is Mark Morgan, it's the 12 to 1 hour on Q8M.
So what's too crazy about the IRS man?
Not good, that's bad.
The cheating laughing when you think of him.
It's not not like you have names.
They're at the door door, let the party heard me.
They come running different classes, you can't.
No one's too crazy about the IRS man.
So I'm going to put it 5.60, that way the Q8M is a short hour.
We got 48 minutes to go, get that timer clicking, baby.
Get it clicking, click on it.
Because we got the pre-game show at 12.50.
Marlins in the message 105 from Jupiter, they're out of this world.
How about those panthers?
Oh, that was something I just think, did you get one call about
the panthers this morning, not a one?
I mean, I understand this is very little interest,
but they won 60 in a row.
They actually got a shot at a playoff, so it's like a miracle.
A month ago, people would like to laugh you off the street.
Not one, Hank says, oh, they care about the heat.
Oh, Dion Sanders, excellent choice.
That is a fabulous choice.
Do you think?
I got that one, Dion, so I can't play.
Right?
We got the one that you can't play.
Must be the money.
Oh, yeah, he gives me the shiflkeys.
Oh, Dion Sanders, talk about it.
It's tough out there for a pimpt.
He got the money of an athlete and the address is like a pimpt.
Boy, he is something.
Dion Sanders, got that neon, Dion?
Yeah.
Good.
Now, how's Dad doing?
Did she get my F thing?
Yes, she did.
Good.
Okay, just double-checking, because I don't want it to rush off to lunch
and then fight out tomorrow.
Oh, guess what?
I think God jammed into the machine, man.
And they never got it.
Yeah, right.
I always got some story.
And how come they want that today?
They's only the 28th of March last time I checked.
We got three days left in the month after this.
Or do we all get the rest of the week off?
I'll tell you what, in the way this place is going,
we all ought to take the rest of the week off.
What difference is it going to make?
Boy, you talk about floating.
My God.
They knew Ray Jean we got here.
They just floating their way through.
And did you ever see Troy Stradford today?
Thinking.
Yeah, did you ever see Chris Jones?
Did we ever get like a follow-up on a conversation from last Friday?
And here's one of the really good you split in your size laughing.
How long before you think we get those client feedback sheets?
Oh, my God.
What a sense of humor this face.
Still hasn't lost it, God.
He's a hundred years old.
And he's still got it.
Just kidding.

We got 240 votes.
I think 1240 was WGBA in Geneva, New York, I do believe.
I never worked there, but young Neil did.
I think I did like that.
And yes, we don't have any.
Jim Brown, Larry, Bird and Charles Berkeley don't have any.
Oh, how fast they forget.
What's the end of that?
The only on the on's got, uh, what was he?
We can put him on here.
Sure, we always got three already.
We realize how fast he's moving on up.
So to put him on there a long time ago.
Nice suit by the way, Dion.
Rod Roddy would be proud.
Now you talk about a nerd.
There is a kid with also the name of Skylar Bartels.
He's from Harvard, Nebraska.
Oh, anyway, and I was just telling you about seeing Dress Decre last night with Angie Dickinson.
We know the kid that played her son that was in Christine.
That nerdy looking kid with the goofy glasses.
Yeah.
Well, that's what this kid looks like.
Now why is this kid important?
Because he spent his spring break, not at Daytona, not in Cocoa Beach, not in Nolines, uh, at Walmart.
Do you see this story?
No.
I think what he's really trying to tell the world is...
I have no life.
Skylar Bartels kept looking over his shoulder.
It's a habit he picked up living at the Windsor Heights Walmart for three days.
Living there, eating, sleeping, checking out the DVDs, never leaving.
The plan was to spend his entire spring break there under the radar.
Some kids go to Cancun.
Skylar Bartels, a Drake University sophomore from Harvard, Nebraska, and looking every bit of it, went to the Garden and patio department.
The real experiment had been over for a few days, but Bartels was still in great experiment mode, as we sat in the booth in the subway sandwich shop through the front of the store.
Haha.
Oh, oh.
He glances at the friendly white-haired Walmart greeters.
Were they onto him?
Were they staring?
Bartels were still suffering from greeter phobia.
He was never out to get Walmart, he explained.
This wasn't supposed to be an expose.
He didn't burst through the door, stewing about low wages for working conditions, or the way the big chain chews up mom and pop stories.
This was part sociology experiment, part school project, part professional neurod I think.
Bartels is a writing major.
Maybe he put it all down on paper and pick up an independent study quitted, or even sell it to somebody someday.
Maybe he moved to another Walmart and produced a documentary, like the guy who weighed nothing but McDonald's for a month.
They did it.
Bartels got the idea from a commercial.
Was it true that those happy, shiny people were telling him, always low prices?
Always?
Could the biggest, most successful discount store in the world really meet his every need?
24 hours a day?
That's what the TV spots were telling him.
That was the goal, he said, to buy everything I needed at Walmart.
There's a picture of him with sister Mary Sue a nun.
And you know something hard to tell him apart.
His father told him to go for it, offered to bankroll the project.
On Sunday his girlfriend dropped him off at the front door and drove away.
The game was on.
He didn't tell Walmart what he was doing.
It's probably a good thing.
We weren't aware of this, so corporate spokesperson, when she earned a webber.
But it's not something we condone.
We're a retailer, not a hotel.
Really?
You know something?
Probably give him an idea.
Walmart hotel.
Yeah.
That was a good idea.
I think everybody could go crash at Walmart.
A great law professor gave Martel some advice to store his private property if they ask you to leave, go quickly and quietly.
Martel's walked into the big box wearing jeans and white t-shirt.
He had a cell phone in case of emergency, his heart medicine, his bank card, two forms of ID and nothing else.
He spent the first afternoon watching chicken little, the animated Disney film.
He watched it all.
The deleted scenes interview is out.
It takes everything.
They headed on a continuous loop the whole time.
I was there.
He said, I passed through the department and said, oh, it's about halfway through.
I like this part.
I think I'll watch it again.
Oh, brother.
I have no life.
Martel's decided not to buy anything he couldn't carry around the store.
He ended up with a jacket for storage space, a notepad, some pencils, an electronic voice recorder, a free pack of underwear, a coma toothbrush, and some toothpaste.
He lived off energy drinks, donuts, yogurt, and subway sandwiches.
He figured he slept four hours at the 41 in captivity.
He caught a few minutes whenever he could, and a subway booth or restroom stall, which isn't recommended, especially with the night stockers bursting in every five minutes.
Night stockers.
Remember that show?
It's a duke.
I got to the point he said where I was indebted falling asleep on the toilet seat, which sounds kind of weird.
Oh, maybe that's what happened in yesterday, the U.
Maybe the sales holes fell asleep on the seat.
They're sleeping at the switch.
Maybe they're asleep on the seat.
Well, I beat them to it this time.
Well, thank god.
You're learning your lesson, man.
Get in there early, early and often.
The best place for dosing was lawn and garden where the lights weren't so bright.
Nobody worked there between two and four in the morning.
Martel's found a lawn chair kicked back and wondered how life could be better.
Life would be perfectly discovered without the worker who showed up before dawn to stock plants.
Martel's hopped up and pretended to be looking for home patio furniture.
That wonderful A&M shift was at 80 low points.
Someway was closed.
Martel's was off in the only Walmart shopper, which made it harder to blend into cosmetics and sporting goods.
Oh, and it goes on and on.
He was sitting on a floor reading a magazine at 3 a.m. when a man shooting from the cold walked in, bought an atlas and left.
You'd see a lot of people reading to Martel said, Cosmopolitan was a huge favorite.
But nobody ever checked the magazine section and never saw anybody stalking books or magazines.
He found it strange the way the same two guys kept showing up in the middle of the night to buy movies.
They looked like the devil's reject kind of guys.
He said, but they ended up buying stuff like Charlie and the chocolate factory.
Uh-huh.
Like I said, the message is...
I have no idea.
And I'm going to be able to relate to that.
Believe you me.
We've talked to many of you and there is no doubt.
5.6.7.1. I'm not giving the phone number out. I got no time for any call.
Do I? Well, I got a call.
WDQ-A-M, hello.
See, and that's because there's no third break this hour, which there would be if we had any spots or if anybody knew how to do the log.
Or if the sales department was like on top of these things, there's more money. This hour is evidence.
Okay. Make a copy of this log. We'll produce it as evidence in court.
Peeing it away. WDQ-A-M, hello.
Maybe they wouldn't have to borrow money to buy the radio stations if they weren't peeing all the money away down the toilet.
WDQ-A-M, hello.
Hey, me, how may I do it?
Okay.
I do have one good thing. Actually, I mean, I know I always take the beesleafs and everything like that.
But they actually just open smart over here on the West Coast.
You heard they got rid of that idiot Liz Wilde. They fired her ass again.
Yeah, big news.
Yeah, well, that's good news. That's good news. Maybe they'll actually get... maybe they'll put you on over here now.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, okay.
Give it.
Top of a couple more of those, whatever you're taking.
Wow.
5.6.7.0.5.60.
They've arrived in Singular, wireless lines. What's upon the time we were on over there?
Remember those glorious days in Fort Myers?
Oh, yeah.
The salad days.
Woo! We did. We have an audience over there?
No.
Or what? My God. We were kicking big fat smelly ass.
WDQ-A-M, hello.
Money.
WDQ-A-M, hello.
Who's Q-A-M?
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah, hello.
Yes.
I, in the middle of the street, go...
WDQ-A-M, hello.
I made number one. That's unbelievable.
WDQ-A-M, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, does Q-A-M get a massive power surge when they put a Marla's game on and everyone turns the radio off?
Yeah. Yeah, we've been able to run energy there. We've cut down our FP and O bill.
Excellent.
Thank you.
Okay. No problem.
Hey, how about those Hurricane basketball games we had a couple weeks ago?
Those are really big ratings, they're killer. I mean, they're grabbers.
They were grabbing it.
Couldn't you hear them?
I heard them.
They're from the Tourland Tourland Seed.
Wow.
Gwen, Mikkelson writes in the center, you're right, no more causes. Sorry.
I told you I didn't have time.
And you're like, oh, yeah, you're good.
No, I don't.
I don't have time.
We only got 25 minutes, Mr. Plus, we got a lot of exit music, man.
Yeah, that's certainly the volume of the time.
Not bad.
Yeah, yeah.
It's the funs, brothers.
Roll band, right?
Nice.
I can put that like I could loop it, you know, and play that for like 25 minutes.
It's a possibility.
All we could alternate it, we could loop that, and then we could like, express it with...
I'm thinking that's a format.
I don't know about you.
No, I'm thinking we break that down and sample it and make a song out of it.
Yeah.
Just as long as we put on endless loop.
Right.
Something for you to think about since you want to play a lot of music this summer when
you shut the phone off.
The American people share the blame for the war in Iraq.
That was one of the messages during the Iraqi women speak out to an anti-war event that
drew hundreds of attendees to the veterans memorial building in Santa Cruz.
When you look at the lead up to the war in Iraq, I blame President Bush.
I blame Congress.
I blame the media, said Scott Ritter, former Marine, former UN Chief weapons inspector for
Iraq, and contributed to the book Neocon again, a compilation of condemnations of the Iraq
war.
But I'm not cutting any slack for the American people, he said.
Americans, he said, have grown accustomed to lifestyle.
They cannot sustain.
Many Americans have failed to engage, he said, making the American government more of an
oligarchy than a representative democracy.
As a nation, we are mute.
We are silent, Ritter-funded.
And he is absolutely correct, sir.
The event was part of a tour organized by San Francisco International Human Rights Organization
Global Exchange that sent a Iraqi women to speaking engagements across the country,
talk about their experiences and the U.S. invasion.
But the Iraqi women scheduled to speak and be sent to Cruz event, Faiz al-Arajee, couldn't
make it because of exhaustion.
For a Iraqi women are participating in the project, speaking at events colleges, houses
of worship and other places, giving local newspaper interviews and speaking on radio
shows.
Al-Arajee said Benjamin has been mostly centered, and initially conservative parts of the
country.
We found that people are hungry for information no matter where they are, said Benjamin.
Al-Arajee said Benjamin maintains that Iraqis are capable of stopping civil war if the
U.S. troops would just leave.
Others say they may hope that their children will come home alive from school each day.
Such information was one of the things that Jay Johnson and Santa Cruz came to hear.
I am interested in the war when I learned more information I can get about it.
He said especially the women's issues, that search for information also drew Dina Scopat,
a Scopatoni of Aptos.
I am waiting to find out the truth, I guess, or a little bit more of a Chibi San.
Also speaking at the event was Reyna Governe, a former U.S. Army captain who put a lot of
his articles on our website, Reyna Governe, and a former CIA analyst.
We have a detailed, not present, Bush-eyed, stepped-led Geneva conventions leading to
our publicly acknowledged policy of torturing people.
We have all heard it was a couple of bad apples at the bottom, but I have documentation
that it was bad apples at the top of the barrel, said the government, producing a memorandum
signed by President Bush that required that the detainees be treated humanely and to
the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity in a matter of consistent
with the principles of Geneva.
That is a loophole you can grab a MAC truck through, we have a set.
To extend appropriate and consistent with military necessity, my ass.
The organizers urged attendees to act by sending a postcard representative Sam Far,
Democrat of Carmel, urging him to cut off funds for the war by sending Massachusetts representative
James Pima Governe's and the War and Iraq Act of 2005.
You going to sign it?
You sign it?
We have a portrait.
You're asked so fast, even Lou Dobzoy applauding.
Between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.
Oh, God.
I mean, talk about a one-note show.
He had granted two or three weeks, all of a sudden he got religion, he became very
elucid, he was on target and the thing with the apports and Dubai and Dubi Dubi Dubi
and now he's right back to where he was there.
Just obsessed.
Not that he's not right, but I mean, Jesus, kind of like a Emmy shaper.
It was Cuban.
It was Cuban.
Oh, that whole deal again.
Oh, God.
Give me a break.
They're not so magnificent obsession, but anyway, he's your guy.
You know, Lou Dobz.
Okay, big fan.
I'll take what's his name, I'll take Doug Thompson.
You have Lou Dobz.
As far as my media hero.
Okay.
Is that okay?
Well, until Doug Thompson gets a TV show, when does that start?
1200 and it starts when they find some network that would put him on, which ain't any of the
big three or the talking hit one.
I'll tell you one thing, he's right in the arena of Reda Cosby.
You know, if MSNBC wonders why nobody watches their network, take a look at who they got
on.
Other than what's his name, Keith Oldman, oh, there's a Casper Winnieburger.
1987.
Look at that.
That was 99 and he looked 100 years old.
He was 88.
That's definitely old enough.
Don't you think?
Got the one.
That's for Winnieburg, who was 88.
That's what I just said, bitch.
Well, that's Mrs. Limbaugh.
You get Brown, Larry Burton, Charles Berkeley, he's still got the big zero.
You don't think she's cute, Darren Kagan?
Just for a moment, forget about that.
Oh, sorry, she's cute.
No.
No.
Josh, you think she's kind of cutesy?
No.
You know you're lying.
If she was married to say like Lou Dobbs, you say she's hotter than a firecracker, how
do they in the face of the sun?
No, I'm good.
No, I'm not talking about you and I'm talking about you.
You don't even know Lou Dobbs from Lou Groza.
Who's the name?
Who's the toe?
Who's the toe, Groza?
Cleveland Brown's great play skicker, baby.
You better start learning your football, Mr.
if you're going to be a professional jockmeister, if you're going to be a part of Clemens's
triumvirate.
If you're going to crack that crowd, you're going to crack the crack crowd or what?
I'm working on it.
Yeah, you better start sniffing jockstrap all day 24-7 and then you can get into a
recurrence in the beast and little Robert.
And I got news for her when Robert sniffs a jockstrap and has a different connotation.
You know what I'm saying?
You're fair.
Yeah.
That's what I'm thinking.
1231, we got Marlon's baseball in just 19 minutes.
You'll be able to hear the sound of those radios clicking on.
Is this game on TV, by the way?
They don't put the great-proof league games under.
They do.
They do, I'm like, fuck you up.
But this one I don't think is.
Well, I don't want to think about it.
I want to know it.
Okay?
So I'm going to like check the Sun Sentinel right here.
I would check the hero, but I don't believe them.
All of the Sun Settle that's a TV thing, it might be Tommy Jicke.
Well, I'm sure he's got nothing.
He's got to do with sports.
Sports.
That's out of his league.
Let's see the Florida Marlins.
Are they, how they doing this spring with their little league team?
Well, first place, but, you know, are they really?
Well, yeah, but, you know, spring doesn't mean anything.
Oh, they got a guy named Abercrombie.
Reggie, that was a horse.
Reggie Abercrombie.
He went over two against the Urels on Monday.
Drops his grave-foot league average 14 points, but he's still hitting 382.
He's kicking fat ass, baby.
Wow.
382.
What's wrong with that?
So where's the thing on here about the schedule, about who's on first and when the game
and you know, there's no way.
This, this website really blows, man.
This is so bad.
Wouldn't it be nice to know if this game was on TV or something?
Let's see, Marlins, where's the sports on TV thing?
Where's something?
What are these papers, blow?
28 to 1, a QAM, 1250 to Marlins on deck.
It will be playing some of that really great punk brothers music band with...
I see no, Reggie Abercrombie.
I see no, Reggie Abercrombie.
I see no, Reggie Abercrombie.
Roll band, I...
Roll band.
I can't say a guy's no more, of course.

Oh before I continue
So Georgia had an order of the Dreamfields pasta
Yeah, in line, right?
I did a completely different order
It was because the public's the shelf is empty where it was
Now, have we had since I've been raving about it for two weeks and I love it every day almost
There are three times a week anyway
Have we had one person's facts or call and say
You know, when I tried that and my blood sugar went skyrocketing or was very good or anything?
No, or die, no, no it's not
No, maybe they're all dead
No, because they're much ingrates
I mean, you know, would they have ever found out about it if it wasn't for
They'll come!
And I was just by the luck of their all that I found it online just to blind luck
But man, we turned down to something really great
And you're buying it up like a hotcakes there at the public's as they can't even keep it in stock
And Georgia has to order it online
But we hear nothing as usual

Then I jumped over the wall and then I thought they don't stop
You told me that I've jumped up, see your hair still, I lost a round some more
And I suspected something funny when I found a bloody glove, a bloody glove
Next thing we knew, AJ went on a low speed, from the right
Now he's in an L.A. jail charge for double on the side
And I believe it's the first degree murder easy to yell, it's because
I'm a bloody clown, I'm a sign of it

So, who are you?
What's up.
You know what they use it means, Doug, you can smell the baseball gloves.
You can smell the docks, can't you?
It's not the leather gloves.
Take those no-dos.
They've had borings coming up.
He is still doing the game, does he, Doug?
Yeah, don't be ridiculous.
David Roxy, Foxy Roxy.
Roxy will wake you up, but have a little...like that.
Marlins and the Mets and Jupiter come and have overg head mad dog after the game and then you
take a few hours in your 7 to 10 lady martes.
Particip gold figures in a clock for any kid of life.
Lady Marta is in 7 children.
We have lost our sense of humor in the face of adversity.
We still can chuck a little bit.
Take off those gloves.
It's time to get an eye.
Look at that.
Take that.
I just passed it.
Here's the bomb.
Let's go.
Here's the bomb.
