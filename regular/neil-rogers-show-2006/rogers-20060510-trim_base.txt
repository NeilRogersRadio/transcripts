Alright, time to go North.
How are things up there, Neil?
Well, that was a quick switch.
Holy crap, what just happened there?
I don't know.
Josh said, switching, and I just hear you.
Well, see, I didn't have to listen to any commercial.
That's good.
Things here are just beautiful, man.
It's sunny. It's going to be 72 today.
The origins are dropping big loads on my patio out here.
It's beautiful.
It's already like summer here.
Yeah, that's what I'm hearing.
Like 87, 88.
Now, it's a huge humidity.
Humidity here.
There's a lot of sun shines.
Beautiful day.
Two nights of a day to be in here.
I need to be heading down the road.
You know where?
What are you laughing about?
6,079, the announced attendance at the Marlins debacle last night.
10-2.
Just getting spanked by the braves.
And you know, there's supposedly all these braves fans,
so that means that there actually were about 3,000 people in the joint.
Probably 1,000 more braves fans.
That's going to say.
They must have been counting arms and legs.
Yeah.
And of course, all the ushers and umpires, coaches, players, broadcasters,
such as they are.
The Aggies had to face Josh Beckett last night.
That was the game that interested me.
The Red Sox at New York and the Red Sox at Bombing the Aggies.
Good.
Excellent.
Yep.
And Beckett had an easy time of it.
You look at the guys who used to play for the Marlins.
Alex Gonzalez had a home run last night.
Mike Lowell's hitting 340 this year for the Red Sox.
Yeah.
Pudge.
He's like me, needed to change his scenery.
Yeah.
That's a big part of it.
It probably was.
Let's see.
I got the Joel Feinberg story that um...
Oh, I didn't see that.
From uh...
What's the Ocean Drive magazine?
What a jackass.
Oh.
He says most of the most pertinent line he has, he said the fact he has all of daddy's money, you know.
Is uh... ratings don't lie.
Well if ratings don't lie, let me just tell you this man, you ain't got any.
You ain't got any Joel.
Oh so here's what I want to talk about.
I was stolen for time digging through my pile.
Well I was digging I should have played this.
That's Taps.
Oh it's Neil Young, good Canadian boy.
Oh that's the...
That's the from his new album?
Right.
Yeah.
Ricky Williams may have to take a drug test if the running back wants to play for uh...
The Toronto Argos of the Canadian Football League.
The NFL suspended William, we know that.
The CFL has no formal drug testing policy but Toronto president Keith Pellys said the team could connect its own test
if the office allow Williams to play for the Argos.
If they say okay go ahead and you know...
They're gonna decide by the end of the week I guess.
Do you have any info on that?
Just that.
Any inside dope?
Oh sorry.
They'll probably let him go up there and play.
See because one thing that the um...
It is absolutely crucial that before we would proceed with Ricky Williams he's prepared to be absolutely clean
and more importantly educate the youth at Toronto to say no to drugs Pellys said.
If he's not prepared to do that we would not sign him even if he was prepared to play for free.
Now see that's one of the things the Argos will be.
He is playing for free.
150,000 Canadian.
Yeah.
That's what he's gonna get.
Well if he don't want to do uh... do uh... no drugs and educate the youth at Toronto against drugs.
Which he could just go out on the streets of the city and say hey we all put that thing out you know.
Because they're smoking it all over the place here.
This would not be a good environment for him.
Tell Ricky I stay where he is.
Stay in a drug-free place like Miami.
Oh yeah.
Where you'll be safe.
Let's face it man.
It got belongs in Jamaica or somewhere.
You like smoking a big fat one and that's just the way it is.
He's not gonna stop.
Just ask George Hilltide he's not gonna stop.
He's not gonna stop.
For Love or Monk I mean.
And certainly enough for 150 G's Canadian.
That's all I'll be honest with you.
Let me take a look now.
I may walk out of here now if I see the wrong number.
Because it's getting pretty scary.
Thank you Mr. President for the low gas prices and for that crappy American dollar.
Oh my god.
It's just killing me.
I totally this I think when I first came up here four years ago the Canadian dollars worth only 62 cents against the US dollar.
62 cents.
So I made everything it tremendous bargain for me including my rent and everything.
And now let me just take a look.
It was 90 and a half cents this is the other day.
The euro which was one seventeen about two weeks ago is now one twenty eight against the dollar.
So that's like making a big comeback.
The pound which was about one seventy seven is now one eighty sixty American dollars.
Oh no.
Uh oh.
88 almost 91 cents.
The Canadian dollar has been a strong in years and years and years.
Pretty soon it's gonna be even steve it.
So that means if you lose the grand it would buy you really lose a grand.
You know what I'm saying?
As opposed to like six hundred and twenty bucks even if you find a good machine month.
Boy that is bad.
That's brutal.
So anyway Joe Bell got everybody's deal done.
He got the Josh all wrapped up in Georgia's contract and he was in the this morning.
Ah ha ha ha ha.
Doing this clown routine.
In fact he said something I've heard so many times before.
It's not important that we succeed but that the guys across the street fail.
How many times have you heard that?
They're obsessed.
They have an obsession.
Yeah somebody's got to get you in fact I'm sure Georgia still has the copies.
You got it George?
Yeah I got the original.
Yeah I got the original Georgia pass it on to you from Ocean Drive magazine.
The people who make Miami beat patrol here's a picture of Joe on his I guess he's riding
a Harley or something.
No I can't the pictures too dark.
Is that what he's on?
No he's riding something.
He's on a rail.
Oh he's on a rail.
I just don't know what he is.
Oh I see I didn't realize that.
I thought he was riding a Harley or something.
This is so dark he's just barely making anything up.
And Joe find we're finding the ticket to South Florida radio success.
Success?
Written by a real pose that Suzy Buckley whoever she is I guarantee she ain't no William F Buckley.
She quotes him the same.
I don't know if she goes on to say the station is official home of the dolphins with exclusive radio broadcast rights to their games.
She didn't mention that they lost three and a half million dollars the first year.
And a roster regular program hosted by some of the most recognizable names in Florida sports including Joe Rose,
Dan LaBanstra, Doge McDeffey and Sid Rosenberg.
Isn't Sid Rosenberg one of the most recognizable names in South Florida sports?
Oh this is so stupid.
It's a press release.
Yeah that's exactly right only.
Then we also got a copy of a letter that Suzy wrote to Joe.
I don't know where you got this by hook or by crook.
She says Joe I really appreciate you're taking time for the interview as you know we didn't have space around all the just the facts that we did.
I thought you might like to have a copy to keep.
And so here's some of the questions she asked that they didn't get in the article.
Ocean Drive if you have 20 minutes to spend with any person who would it be.
Joel Feinberg says my daddy on Friday when I can't meet payroll.
You must be kidding.
Listen Ocean Drive is the one thing people say about you really ticks you off.
Joel Feinberg I hit it when people say I was handed everything.
Actually I've never been handed anything it's all direct deposited.
Ha ha ha Joel laughs.
Yes perfect quack the cage is to run a baseball team.
Ocean Drive one thing about you that would shock your friends Joel Feinberg.
I'm a closet jocks nipper.
Why else do you think I started a sports talk station?
I love that locker room access.
He loves the smell of what jocks draps.
Ocean Drive wait wait these two these will send you into orbit.
If you could be an inanimate object what would you be?
Joel Feinberg my mirror.
And Ocean Drive business accomplishment you're most proud of.
Joel Feinberg taking a radio station that made money and having it lose over $4 million just 18 months.
Most people don't realize how difficult that is.
Man if we could just say I understand that lad he's proud of doing what?
You want me to read it again?
That last one yeah.
Okay.
One moment please.
Okay.
Taking a radio station that made money in other words when it was a Jefferson pilot they were like floquering it out.
And having it lose over $4 million just 18 months.
Most people don't realize just how difficult that is.
So he's proud of that?
A little self-deprecating you know what it was he's admitting that they're losing their ass.
But dad he's got a lot of money and it's direct deposit and ha ha ha.
I was daddy I put that kid up for adoption.
That was cost of me.
I got a money.
Real cheap too.
I mean can imagine that kid coming home and saying daddy I lost $4.5 million.
You didn't what?
Yeah well I guess today it's come to you.
You know years ago the old American football league Lamar Hunt Jr.
Kansas City Chiefs when the original franchise was in Dallas.
Yeah.
They lost a million dollars the first year.
But this is Lamar Hunt.
And somebody said to him what did your father think about you losing a million dollars on a football team?
And he said well at that rate in about 300 years he's probably going to get ticked off.
Yeah.
I don't know if minebergs have that kind of money.
Hey to admit I was a Buffalo Bills fan back in those days because I worked in the Batavia.
Yeah Ray Carlton went to all the Buffalo Bills games.
We had Jackie Camp and Darryl Lamonica and Cookie Gilchrist and George Sames.
Remember Cookie Gilchrist?
Sure.
He played for the dolphins.
Did he?
I didn't know that.
Yep.
Wow.
Who's the dolphins quarterback going to be this year before I then he's called Peppers a heels up.
Probably Joey Harrington.
Oh my god.
Well that's the best news I've ever had in a long time.
I always had to get stuff for you.
Holy cow, Joey Harrington.
I thought they gave up on that.
He couldn't play for an American Legion team.
That's how bad he is.
He's going to make them feel that like they're going to miss what's his name.
AJ touchy feely real bad when they get a word for him, his act.
He's both aesthetic.
Well that's goodness for Patriot fans and everybody else in the AFC.
I would be, yeah.
Yep.
It's good news.
Well I'm confused now because you said AFL.
No.
Patriots had some interest in the original.
The original franchise.
The San Deban cutting me more.
The one in the back.
The one in the back.
The one in the back.
The one in the back.
The one in the back.
The one in the back.
San Deban.
Do you know Capilletti?
Chino still does their radio.
Really?
Yep.
And so does Bob Kuzi do the way before they are self-acting?
He can't speak.
Have you ever heard him speak?
I don't understand that.
Absolutely.
He was letting Martessa on like water croncite.
I just don't get it.
Staying in the water croncite, I saw the, I didn't waste my time with the movie because George told me it was so bad.
Good night and good luck.
But I saw an on-bography lesson.
Bography channel, the Admiral Bio.
That was good.
He was something.
Yeah, he was.
I haven't seen him for a while either.
That's what we need today is another Ed Murrah.
I kept thinking that during that hour, boy.
We need somebody with some balls and we just don't have it.
That's right.
Don't have it in the media.
They're all bunch of sell-outs.
Very sad.
So Ed, I'm glad that Joel Feinberg says the ratings don't lie because, boy, you look at this last book, Joel.
And you have, oh, in fact, there's another really good line, too.
To sure, this is really outdated.
This just came out, but it's so outdated.
April 2006.
It's totally outdated.
He says, um, his arbitrage ratings recently increased 64%.
But again, that's in the fallbook when they had the dolphins.
And of course, they've dropped way back off again.
Uh, Lister's only option had been a station that between Howard Stern and the Arigis didn't start taking the talking sports until two o'clock in the afternoon.
He says, we created seven ideas a younger, hip or a newer alternative that really focuses on what people in this market want to hear about local and national sports.
Right.
Of course, you've been on that in the morning for what?
You're in a half?
Yeah.
So this is a little bit dated.
Okay.
Howard Stern, A.O. in the morning anymore, was only on for like three or four months anyway.
And obviously with the ratings I got, nobody wants to hear of somebody not not talking sports in midday.
So, you know, Joe, you're just such a jackass.
You know, just burning daddy's money.
Just have a bonfire in the back row.
Backyard.
Have a weeny roast.
You weeny.
The jerk.
I bet you my good buddy Dick Feinberg at Pompe and Aparkas, New Apatizogad with the same last name running around named Joel Feinberg.
I sure hope to turn out related.
I don't know.
They could be, I guess.
I'm pretty sure they're not.
His family is in real estate.
Oh, I don't think Joel Feinberg walks around in them Hawaiian shirts like Dick does at Pompe.
I like a pre.
I still haven't found out whether the deal went through in Pittsburgh.
I think it's probably still a number.
Was it going to buy the penguins building that arena?
There's talk that the penguins could be were.
I just saw a story about Irogen even in New York is what I'm hearing.
No, that they're building an arena in someplace.
Aliquipa.
No, some big city.
Some middlelands PA.
And that the penguins of the team that they're going to go out.
So now you wouldn't know, oh, it's East Rutherford.
I'm sorry.
I remember the answer to the question before I asked to the question.
Do I have a question?
Where the metallands is?
See, because there's a town called, and I've been there.
I mean, you, well, I don't want to go through the thing with a track again, because I got you beat on that.
But metallands, Pennsylvania, which is South of Pittsburgh, that's where the meadows is.
Yep.
The meadows.
You never been there.
I bet that's only a harness for you.
It's harness racing.
I've been there.
I have a betel-like.
There was a matter of fact.
There was a big time on cast for so early there.
It is?
Yep.
And Roger Houston, who was the first track announcer at Pompa No Park, who screams and yells and has got an ego like Joel Feinberg, he calls the races at the meadows.
With a great day of fallon driving.
And Brian Sears was driving there, too.
But of course, he went on to the metallands to East Rutherford, New Jersey.
I used to be a guest on there.
Toby Callett used to do triple crown shows from there.
Toby's a clocker here in South Florida.
And they used to bring him up to the meadows because he's from Pittsburgh.
And I used to go on with him before the big races.
Really?
Yep.
I still miss Harvey Pack.
May the horse be with you and he would throw the program at the camera.
Yep.
The end of the show.
He was still alive, huh?
Yes, he is.
And then the good news from Dave.
Dave and I had a good chat on Friday.
A stand bursting is still alive.
I guess you don't know Stan.
It's harness racing.
Yeah, I know who he is.
Viva?
Yep.
Good guy.
One of our people, man.
Stan Bergstein.
Goldstein.
In fact, I was saying the other name.
Maybe we can have Goldberg and Goldstein in the morning.
What do you think of that?
He could tweak your numbers up a little bit or at least tweak him up a little.
Gellie.
Oh my god.
We got to do something about him.
I think a hitman is in order.
He's on today as a matter of fact.
All your people out there don't say we didn't warn you.
Gellie it to a clock at just your radios.
You know, if people did have those HD sets because we're always saying,
hey, QAM is HD radio.
Nobody's got a set.
But if they did, do you imagine how that would sound in high definition?
Pyracing, man.
Philly pierced to the white socks.
Great left-handed.
I don't know what I'm thinking about.
Philly pierced.
Yankee killer.
Chico-chirous-scale.
I tell you, probably not a very well known.
In fact, the obscuri Yankee killer for the Red Scots was Russ Nixon.
Not Russ Nixon.
What was his name?
Willard Nixon?
Russ Nixon was a catcher.
Willard Nixon.
Remember him?
Willard Nixon.
Yeah, he would always beat the Yankees, man.
He was Yankee killer.
How was Big Yankee, fan, as a kid, till 63 till they stay out there?
Frank Larry was a big Yankee killer.
For the Tigers, that is correct.
Absolutely correct.
There was a Jim Bunning time before Bunning went crazy and became a right wing senator from Kentucky.
Oh, he's a nut job.
Yeah, you know, it's almost every athlete who becomes a politician is a right wing like Steve Lardgeon.
All right wing, Jack Camp.
All the Jack Camp's not that far right wing.
He's got a few skeletons in his closet.
Yeah, we hated Jack Camp and Buffalo, man.
In fact, we get it.
We get to be like in the third quarter and the people would be screaming.
We want La Monica.
Well, La Monica was good.
Even back then, man.
He was really good.
They called them the Mad Bomber.
Hartford is the city that's trying to get the penguins.
Hartford?
Yep.
They already bombed with the wailers there with the whole...
I see why keep going back to places where you failed before when it's guaranteed to fail again.
You want to get...
There's a big developer up there who wants to build a newer arena.
If at first you don't succeed, fail again.
I guess that's what it is.
It's kind of our philosophy here at QA.
But that's your old man.
What a clown.
You should have heard him this morning.
He put on quite a little of Ogville routine for me.
Oh, brother.
Well, what do you think about the 10-3?
What about the 10-3?
What about the...
What a clown.
Well, you go 10-3 and Mad Dog goes on a 3?
Yeah, there you go.
Yeah, let's go solve his problem.
It's always how much more can we squeeze out a kneel, you know, out of the old man?
Guess who else is...
Same age as me.
I just found this out last time on TV.
You know, these little things that come on the crawl.
Don Kishane.
In fact, you said you liked to show him.
Wayne Newton is 63.
So if your voice sounds better than his does then?
Yeah, and I'm a little butcher than he is.
I'll tell you that, which isn't saying much.
But Wayne Newton is 63.
Don Kishane.
Well, one of these days a testicle will drop and it'll be really dangerous.
Just like that one.
I love when I hold my breath.
I once went up in Wayne's helicopter.
Really?
He flew up the way...
Wayne Newton, I thought you meant Wayne Heisinger.
No, Wayne Newton.
Yeah.
We went from Las Vegas.
We took off from his house and went up through Red Rock Canyon up to Logandale where he has a horse farm.
Huh.
With a bunch of Arabian horses.
Really?
And he flew to the helicopter.
It was quite a trick.
Kind of like Brownie Brown.
He was in the Arabian horses.
Remember that was his thing before he became the FEMA director.
Remember that?
Yeah.
That was his claim to fame.
That's what qualified him to be director of FEMA.
Yeah, that's right.
He had Arabian horses.
That is correct.
Of course his ass, I think, describes him a lot better.
Well, this is already way past the first break.
Oh my gosh.
And I got to play that to Neil Young thing.
I think it's almost time for a...
For a...
Guilty.
By the time we get everything all jammed in here a day.
Well, this is never a great day today.
It's a real...
It's a beautiful day.
It's a good day to go out and find a good machine, I think.
And this is a great day to gamble, too, I think.
Yeah.
I really have to...
I don't know what it is, but I have to eat today.
Okay.
Because I went there on Monday, which I ordinarily never go on Monday.
You're reaching for the Gratchet, you know?
Yeah, that's right.
Find a good machine, man.
Yep.
Which is the one that pays.
I'm going to go out there and scour for it.
Hope you have some other load.
A heavy set young guy...
A nice young guy who won the regulars there.
He's always yuckin' in life with me.
And last week he won 18 grand on the $2 machine.
About 10 yards from where I was playing that super wheel of fortune
crab, this guy was 18 grand.
He put in 200 bucks in the machine, man.
And he got 18,000.
And he took the cash.
He waited an hour, but he took the cash.
They came in the exam and that machine, they brought out the...
They put in the stuff that's a scope and they like...
Oh yeah.
Hey, listen, when you went to jackpot in those places, they checked that thing out inside out and upside down.
Yeah, they don't like to pay.
No, they don't like to pay and they want to make them sure that nobody was, you know, losing a little...
Whatever.
Although I don't know what the hell you could use now, because those computers...
They go, well, since it's already time for the 11 o'clock hour, so I have a great day.
And when a bundle...
You can go.
See ya.
The music's pressed on the previous program.

New York, yes from the new a new young album called Living with War let's impeach the president
We also got a good one called looking for a leader. Well, they're all good
I'm gonna play the whole thing a little bit there. It is a little tease to what you have to play
Let's we get caught up here because that long crossover man, which I love it just gets this a little behind
Can I say behind back though? I'm sorry Joyce
So Miguel just I told you Miguel's a groupie, you know, okay?
I'll give you a number by the way for our um
About 30 man. No, no
I think I ran off to Costa Rica with the money. We probably raised 125,000. He's gonna tell us oh
What do you guys only got 25 grand? Yeah, what are people actually got the merchandise?
Mogger
Ugurant mt if they hadn't gotten a we'd be here in plenty of ho ho
That's all we ever there. That's another reason not to get involved in that crap
I I sent him my money three days ago, and I still haven't got the CD yet in the okay
Can you tell me when I can expect it? Yeah, sometime between now and next year. Boo is okay. Shmuck
Air every time we do it look at oh, I thought I said six six six eighty six hundred days pool
Yeah, got an amazing bulletin. I'm gonna break some news here in a second. Thanks to Miguel
Today's pool though. Let's lay it on him and we've also got well
We never did this exact one. I changed it changed it up a little bit and well the one for tomorrow changed up too
Little change up now for Marlon pictures could just learn to throw good change up
Maybe they would be giving up nine ten runs again. They lost ten to two that the braves last night
They're eight and 22. How many games in the Marlon's played so far?
And they want to eat. Oh, that's bad like I said
If they win 50 games this year, I think it'll be a miracle
That's what Josh said. He said they really suck
They said oh, they're pathetic and the announced crowd is six thousand seventy nine. Oh, now was it raining last night?
I heard it was not no weather. I was all the smog and fog and fires and stuff
That's another reason by the way to get out of Florida folks all those fires. Oh brother all those brush fires
Yeah, they said there was a fog warning this morning too though, but I didn't see anything
But you're just not hanging in the right hood man. It's problem get way out there by the glades get on the US
27 you'll see it you get all fogged up
Another reason to get that out of that place man even the gators moved out a long time ago
694 votes. We'll make a thousand again today easy no
Swetsky the main reason you listen to the near-roger show is to hear Neil ranting rave 373
53.7% just one hear me ranting rave
I think I'm gonna do that every day for four hours just ranting rave
Like for well, maybe that's why they liked him
And if I said big racking big D a couple of times and put me over the top right you know it oh, yeah try to
Want a package sweet
To hear the bedtime stories 85 now that's shocking. That's in second place
So that that contradicts what McGill the lovely McGill is always saying oh, you know, he is so milleted about there
If I read like one paragraph or something he gets starts foaming at the mouth
He gets all upset and that's because it doesn't have anything to with Cuba
I let me tell you this if every story that I read on the show is about Cuba
He would be glued to the radio he'd get his crazy glory
Take it off the toilet seat and stick the radio to his side of his head am I right? Oh, yeah, whatever you say
I'm saying okay, you don't you know, I'm right. I'm gonna have a conversation with Cuba bottom
But so whatever you say man he is obsessed or at least at least he puts on a pretend that that's his front
You know, I'm gonna make you guys talk about drugs and sex but besides that
Uh, listen for a few laughs now you see that I added that on late and it's moving up there 80
They just want a few last man
That's all kill four hours in the middle of they get a few chuckles here in here
They don't want to hear about all Ricky Ricky this and uh
Shack that I don't know for that craft you'll find review and he admits he's a juxtapher isn't that embarrassing
Even our people with most of them are juxtapher's even they don't want to it wouldn't admit it
I'll maybe thought that wasn't going to give him the uh, although we got it. We got all the outtakes Joel
Thanks to our insights spies you got plenty of moles there in your building
You better start looking around for the moles
For the comedy bits 49
You know those stories that Tom jicka talks about that filler material right you're so stupid Tom
It's embarrassing to me. Dear Neil ripped the colors 49
So you hear the colors only 33
4.7% of this audience tune in the show to hear the colors there what you have to say which we already know is
Present present please and
Whatever that guy does I can't do it
Right. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, and I hate this pool only 25
They like this pool 702 already boy. We're gonna have that thousand past and you can say Joe Bell is a super clown
Here's the bullet now. I think it's even deserves a little bit of a a
Dumb roll

Say, say, stop her, please hang up and just go away.
Forever, why don't you go away?

Go, and I can't be a slave for you.
There's another guy that's Spanish, Jim Scatter, what do I have to old Jim Scatter?
He's up somewhere.
He's somewhere. We needed Jim Scatter, a spy report.
I got another email from Norma Kent, who said there was rain in the game with delayed 40 minutes.
We'll get into his email in a moment. You got to wait normal for your moment in the sunshine.
Talk about a guy just desperate for attention.
He was one of the 2000s.
He's not any more though, he says he's given up.
We'll get to that momentarily. There's a little something for the audience to be hanging on.
Go practice law or go out and pick up some acute runaways and just get out of my life.
Anyway, and I'm sending them a check this week because he took Harry George's contract
because I still owe him a couple of bucks and he's going to get a big fat one,
which he likes smoking a big fat one. In fact, that's the only thing he got in common.
The only thing that I can think of at the moment.
Anyway, here from the beach patrol, people who make Miami,
corne to Ocean Drive Magazine, April Issue, corne to Susie Buckley, who went to a radio.
She enjoys, I think, her on an equal level when it comes to the radio expertise.
Joel Feinberg, finding the ticket to South Florida radio success.
I'm glad you told me that he's standing there with the rail.
I guess that's the PPP park?
Yes.
Because when you fax this to me, it looks like he's riding a Harley or something like that.
I don't know. Looks like a biker punk.
Joel Feinberg finding the ticket to South Florida radio success.
Well, I guess he hasn't found it yet. Keep looking Joel.
In the age of satellite radio and iPods, Joel Feinberg is found a lucrative niche on AM radio dial.
Look at it for somebody. It's getting all of the daddy's money.
Certainly not lucrative for them. They're losing money hand over limperist.
Nearly two years ago, he founded Prime Time Media Group and launched Sports Talk,
790 The Ticket. South Florida's only 24-hour sports radio station
to compete with sports radio 560W QYM.
And again, keep in mind, this is the April issue, but this has been long, long ago,
before the newest ratings came out the winter book and before and anyway.
His arbitraries recently increased 64% from 84,000 most news last summer to 138,000 favorite
last fall, of course, that includes the dolphins.
List is only often having a station that between how it's turned into a rarge
and didn't start talking sports until two o'clock in the afternoon, the 20-year-old Feinberg said,
we created 790s a younger, hip-roo-new world, turned into the really focusses on
more people than this market want to hear about local and national sports.
Isn't that what you guys want to hear about? From the moment I get up.
Yeah. I mean, how can you wait till two o'clock before we start talking about?
I can't. Can't wait. And of course, we don't have Howard's stirring anymore.
And we do start talking about sports at five o'clock in the morning.
It's like, all freaking night long, we got the big, and we got the Humper and...
Stop it! You know.
We got sports up the old shoot. Prior to radio, they flurred and they played golf professionally.
Before opening Capitol Real Estate Group, a full service real estate investment company
that handles everything for mortgages and titles to design and renovation.
When he felt the real estate market cooling, he began shifting his attention
to what he saw as his next profitable project, his next profitable project.
A full service sports media company that includes 790 AM.
The station is the official home of the dolphins. They lost three and a half million
at least on the dolphins in the first season of Curium Games.
And they hit the anxious broadcasting Jimmy Cifalus on there.
Hey, Jimmy.
You fairy.
Which exclusive radio broadcast rights to their games and a roster of regular programs hosted by
some of the most recognizable names in Florida's sports, including Joe Rose,
Dan LeBass, George M. McDuffie, and Sid Rosenberg.
And when I think of sports in South Florida, I think of Sid Rosenberg.
Don't you? One of the most recognizable names.
You know, Susie, whoever you are that wrote to, you may be a very nice young lady,
but you're an idiot.
Typical kind of puff piece you're reading these.
Well, Ocean Drive, first of all, is nothing but a puff piece anyway.
The whole magazine. Even Johnny Versace said he wouldn't like to ask with it.
So anyway, Joel Feinberg says, I like your good football game, but I'm not a sports fanatic.
To me, it's just a business.
But if I see something that's going to be a big success, I'll do it.
Whether it's collecting car cans or making computer parts explains Feinberg,
where race is shifted to go carts and rides motor cross in a spare time.
See, I know it. He rides motor cross.
I took a station that had no revenue whatsoever and built it into a major market competitor in a year and a half.
Major market competitor might ask you, idiot, competing with what?
The bottom feeders? A major market competitor with one and two shares.
I have the audience and they're listening to what I created.
Oh God, what an ego.
And here's the best line. The ratings don't lie.
And guess what, Joel? The ratings say you ain't got nobody listening.
You haven't got squat. I could fit those people into a foam booth and have room left over for fat boy.
Our fans are very interactive. Our phones are lit up all day.
I think you're lit up all day, Joel. You must be smoking.
Go over there and get some good stuff across this reach, George.
He's got the really good stuff. Then they got just the facts.
And that's it. That's the article.
Just the facts. Favorite Friday night in South Beach, sake bombs and sushi at Nobu.
I'll be sure Greg hangs out there for that sushi.
His dream car, 65, 427 Shelby Cobra.
Oh, maybe he goes to get it by one from Rick Riley.
Blast book you read, curious George.
Something no one knows about you. I cried in not one but two acts in coochery movies.
Favorite film, cool hand Luke. Oh, God.
Sunrise your sunset. Sunrise after and all nighter.
And here's the ones they didn't have room to put in the very short piece.
I already read these to Hank but it's worth repeating because make such an ass out of this clown.
Ego, baby. This is Suzy's note to Joel.
I really appreciate you taking time for the interview.
As you know, we didn't have space to run all just the facts that we did.
I thought you might like to have a copy to keep. Suzy Buckley at Ocean Drive.
And here are the questions and the answers.
Ocean Drive, if you had 20 minutes to spend with any person who would it be.
Joel Feinberg, my daddy on Friday when I can't be payroll.
You do that, don't you? He had to get together with with terabel because everything's a big.
Oh, yeah. Ocean Drive is the one thing that people say about you that really takes you off.
Joel Feinberg, I hit it when people say I was handed everything.
Actually, I've never been handed anything. It's all direct deposit.
Joel laughs. Ocean Drive, all time favorite cartoon character.
And there's another answer. Richie Rich, who ain't no fat rich, by the way.
Ocean Drive, one thing that would shock you. What about you that would shock your friends?
Joel Feinberg, I'm a closet jock sniffer.
Why else do you think I started a sports talk station?
I love that locker room access. He wants to get nerdy.
You guys, nation is what he's really trying to say, I guess, huh?
Boy, that's bad. Good thing they don't have the panthers. I'll tell you that.
Ocean Drive, if you could be an inanimate object, what would you be?
And his answer, my mirror.
Oh, all the ego all the time. Compass S.
Ocean Drive, business accomplishment you're most proud of.
And Joel Feinberg's response, taking a radio station that made money before
and having it lose over $4 million in just 18 months, most people don't realize how difficult that is.
Well, it's easy to spend daddy's money to be a big shot.
Greg Reed, he was very famous to do an ask for any other people's money to be a hey,
we'll pay you $10 million. It's not my money.
It's the beeslead and then of course he had that next wife.
But nevertheless, what was it that her father, Greg's ex-wife,
what was it, Marilyn's that her name?
I don't remember. Yes.
Her father invented, I think, the milk carton, wasn't it?
Okay. That's what you said. Yes.
Yes. I did just make that up and remember, he's all that family had money that hasn't been invented yet.
Oh, brother, can you imagine if you're getting like a penny or whatever you get on every milk carton or orange?
You know, I guess for every product that's made in cartons now.
Right? When you think? I would.
I got a good idea, my gosh.
Sounds like a real good idea.
1057 at 560. Oh, there's Chipper Jones.
Teamwork around the poor hot tub could save a life.
Chipper wants to go in a hot tub. Maybe Joel Feibber would like to hop in there with him.
Kind of get the elated land.
I don't think Chipper's got, I still think, I know he's got a wife and kids,
but I think he's an old smoothie. I don't think he's, there's something strange about him.
Have you ever noticed that, Josh? Have I ever noticed that he's strange?
If you watch him at the plate, is batting sent, he looks like a woman.
At any rate.
It's a pretty good woman.
No, what? I said that's a pretty good woman then, because he's pretty good.

Give up right for me.
Are we saying another way?
Hello, my name is Jose.

But at W.S. News and the old days, Barbara Stubley was last on to buy these political Wheeler dealers.
At least they thought they were.
And this one guy who was driving this old beat up Pontiac, came in his wife for all while.
And they were supposedly a Ted Candy Democrats.
But they were going to proper up the run as we were probably going to get elected to Congress.
And they had her sucking up to the Jews.
You know, oh, I love the Jewish people.
I love my love.
I love Israel.
I love Israel.
I love Israel.
It's so obvious and blatant.
And so one day these people came to the station and this guy's giving me a song in advance before my show in a hallway.
But while I'm hurting 3.2 million and once I get my 3.2, I'm going to go on by a new car, be even idea schmuck.
And he also inherited some, what did he call those like a cabana at the fountain booth at the Eden Rock?
What did they call it?
You know, those things, whatever those things are.
I don't know what those things are.
Where they sit out on the beach, you know, in the Talbois.
Oh, yeah.
In a Tikki Hut, a cabana.
Yeah, a Tikki in here, in a Tikki Hut.
Well, I get my 3.2.
Now there was a pompous ass who had nothing based on nothing, you know, just a schlepper.
Just based on a bunch of lies.
It's a name dropper and there's nothing worse than a freaking name dropper.
I'm trying to tell you that right now, that's the lowest form.
That was funny.

If you're a cigar smoker, you like to kick back with a good premium brand.
Let up a big fat one.
Then, but he has cigars by Tony Brahaniis for you.
These hard to find cigars are made with the first grade tobacco process aged up to 10 years.
But he has a real boutique cigar maker, specializing in small, batch hard to find tobacco.
But he, a gold, the flagship line gets a 91 rating by cigar fishing out of cigar insider and 9.1 by Smoke Magazine.
This rich flavored well-balanced, full-body Nicaragua once again has got earthy, hints of dark roast coffee, chocolate, spice and pepper flavors.
Also, we should try their new hot, bahia de selo, the hottest release cigar in the last 10 months.
The de selo gets a high rating of 91 by cigar fishing out of cigar insider.
It's a big powerful baby, a big fat cigar with complex notes of leather, earth and pepper.
That finishes long and full-bodied with additional spice and a noted charred wood.
For a sufferer to back in this nearby you, just log on to bahiacigars.com on the wicked web.
Our call is number two or three, and they'll tell you where to go, believe me.
1-835 bahia. That's 1-800-35BAHI-A.
This is new rocket!
God, this is 5.62 A.S.
George Bush doesn't care about black people.
Who sounds like a moron?
Yes and now.
Every time he sees you, his will wave God wants you to be.
He wants to take the city and cover it in the sweet.
Renewing can.
Renewing can.
Renewing can.
Curse he wants to make new or leads to his mood.
And I don't care what people are saying.
We are black people.
His comments are bizarre.
Surely God is rare.
He compares the hope of sewer willy-wank upon chocolate.
Yes, Renewing can.
Renewing can.
This he wants to make new or leads to his mood.
His turn's lost to come together.
This time, lost to rebuild a new era,
the one that should be.
A town, or wherever they are.
This city will be chocolate.
A chocolate in the wall.
He never takes the blame.
For anything he says.
Chocolate at the end of the day.
That chocolate is the boss of the end of the football dance.
Renewing can.
Renewing can.
Renewing can.
Renewing can?
Renewing can.
Renewing can.
Renewing can.
Don't put somebody in front of a grand jury at the end of an investigation or for the
fifth time unless you feel that's your only chance of avoiding indictment.
So in other words, the burden starts with Carl Rove to stop the charges.
Secondly, it's now been 13 days since Rove testified.
After testified for three and a half hours, prosecutors refused to give him any indication
that he was clear.
And then the third issue was, Carl Rove was identified as official A. We've looked through
the records of Patrick Fitzgerald and every single investigation, whenever Fitzgerald's
identified somebody as official A, that personal legend gets indicted themselves.
A.
How do you like that?
Carl Rove made me indicted this week.
Let's hear it.
All right.
And then we can go on with that impeachment thing.
Okay.
Oh, okay.
Who would get to that?
Somebody Q.A.M.
Hello.
Now that there was the best one we've had today, although I think the first guy was like,
he was rational.
Remember the very first one?
Uh-huh.
I remember what he was talking about because it was so, you know, blisteringly important,
but he was rational.
Somebody Q.A.M.
Hello?
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I want to comment about Hartford and the hockey plans they have there.
Yeah.
I was there.
I grew up there and the summer season was great.
We had Gordy Allen and all that stuff.
But I'm telling you.
And hearing how Neil was the coach.
Yeah, man.
That was the one and only heyday that Tom ever had.
Dave Keane.
Dave Keane.
That's it, man.
You know what their motto is in Hartford?
Yeah.
It could be worse.
It is the word.
Newark is a much better town than Hartford.
Newark is more advertising than Hartford.
I've been there.
It's a toilet, yeah.
Yeah.
They do.
They do the study and they think they could bring it at top 10,000 people to hockey game.
So it's not going to happen.
That's if they shipped in half of them from New York.
Yeah, exactly.
That's the eroding prediction.
No.
Okay, thanks, Palli.
See, it's more the insanity of this professional sport.
Oh, let's go back to Atlanta again.
You know, the flames failed there and they moved to Calgary.
But let's get the trashers in there.
You know, let's move to Florida where nobody would know a hockey puck from a stale bagel.
Just ridiculous.
But that's okay.
What do we care?
Right?
We've worried too much about things that are not going to change our lives, right?
Right.
Who gives a flying crab?
About what?
About that.
Whatever that was.
This guy's right.
Hartford blows.
How much do you think or some of it, Lodden would pay to know exactly when where the president
was traveling and who was with him?
Turns out he wouldn't have had to pay a dime.
All he had to do was go through the trash early yesterday morning.
It appears to be a White House staff schedule for the president's trip to Florida Tuesday.
And a sanitation worker was alarmed to find in the trash, long hours before Mr. Bush
left for the trip.
It's the kind of thing you'd expect would be shredded or burned not throwing the garbage.
Randy Hopkins couldn't believe what he was seeing.
Their underfloor next to a big trash truck was a thick sheath of papers with nearly every
detail of the president's voyage.
I saw locations and names and places where the president was going to be.
New it shouldn't have been a trash roll like this, he said.
Hopkins works in sanitation.
He's in Xconn.
He's worried about fallout from...
I can't read this from something.
Oh, I see.
So he does monitor exactly where he's employed.
But he also does a civic duty to report what he found.
Well, the right hand, I'm having problems with this right hand margin.
Somebody seems to get it popped off.
And you're not helping me.
I'm sorry.
He said it wasn't a...
Shouldn't be the trash hole?
Right.
Trash hole is what he said.
Oh, something like that.
What's wrong with trash hole?
Nothing.
839 on the pool.
Let's take a look at what we got on there.
I'm kind of...
Let me use by this.
The main reason you listen to the Roger Show is, oh, I got another good one on there.
I have no life.
That's a very good one.
That's a great one.
Because that's most of the colors.
So let's get that on there right away.
Pronto.
Subito.
Tear Nioh Rantan Ray 425.
50.6%.
For a few laughs, 133.
A little chuckle makes mine ease buckle.
133 for little Yuck.
Tear the bed.
That's what they say when they turn on Sid Rosenberg.
Yuck.
Tear the bed times through his 93.
Uh-oh.
Part of my 95 is to stay close around Nusmer and Abit.
Uh-oh.
And it's showing the forest fires and the smokey the bear is there and woodsy the owl.
And that's Shane and you will give it in there chewing on some palm trees.
Tear the bed times through his 93.
Tear Nioh Rip the crawlers 61 for the comedy bits 58.
Tear the crawlers 40 only 4.7%.
And I hate this pool when you're 29.
They like this pool.
839.
They actually like it.
They finally found something they can sink their teeth in when they like it.
They loves it.
Right?
Absolutely.
WQYM.
Hello.
I'm a sir.
QYM.
WQYM.
Hello.
Hey Nioh, how you doing today?
OK.
I want to ask you in Canada, in the casinos there, the flat machines.
Do they just, do they dispense coins when you win?
Um, I'm talking like a jackpot, you know, like $150 bucks.
Yes.
The ones that would buy.
The ones that the, the ones in Agra, they switched long time ago over to the paper tickets
like in Navegas.
And in Agra.
Yeah.
And woodbind is slowly, very slowly, but I'm sure they change over the tickets.
The coins I hate like Poison Man.
It's the biggest hassle.
And you got to wait for them to fill a machine and your hands get black and you've
earned the team to wash your hands.
I hate that.
Yes.
They have Vegas.
They're the same thing.
All papers, tickets coming out.
That's a way to go, baby.
Paper tickets.
They're not going to do that.
But you can cash the ticket out at any given moment and then go to another machine real
quick.
As opposed to the coins, you're trying to cash out 150 coins.
And it pukes out about 20, and all of a sudden it runs out of coins.
And you got to sit and wait for a half hour for the attendant to finally show up.
And they had that pissed off.
Look through their turkets.
They're not going to get tipped because there's no jackpot.
It's not.
Yeah.
Hey, what do you think it's going to take to really get these American people really whipped
up and really care about this country and how they're getting ripped off.
And the disarray that we're in and how are you going to do it?
I think if they took American idol off of there and then what's that other stupid show about
the dealer no deal.
If they take those off here, that'll piss them off and up to get them whipped up.
Maybe.
Maybe is the word.
Okay.
Good luck to you, Pally.
I'll see you.
Very, very much.
Okay, so you had all like the coins, man.
It's a hassle.
And then you hit 400 and they start puking up.
I can't deal with that.
I mean, I'll take the 400, gladly.
It's annoying, right?
Yes.
In fact, the ones with a machine, with the tickets, I had a thousand the other day and the ticket
comes off.
Very nice and clean.
And here's the way for the attendant.
Unless it's 1500 or more, you don't have to wait to get paid.
That nice?
Very nice.
It comes a nice computerized ticket.
Here's a thousand bucks.
You got to be careful where you put them though.
You put them in your shirt pocket and some schmuck comes along and grabs them out of
your pocket.
You got to watch yourself.
In fact, I'd be sitting on them.
I'd hide those tickets in a real safe place.
Welcome.
26 past 11 and 560 WQM.
I'm in fact, you guys ought to tell us about Josh's big birthday, Bashed at the Melting
part last night.
It was a bad event.
They had balloons.
Yeah.
The wait was saying about Happy Birthday song.
All like stylized and now were you embarrassed by this?
I was shocked.
I wouldn't say it was embarrassed because it was actually really good.
Yeah.
It was a very happy birthday Mr. President kind of thing.
Really?
Yeah.
I was shocked.
He was like Marilyn Monroe.
That's right.
She was.
Little booby action there.
I didn't get any of that.
Maybe that's it.
Did you get a different dunk it?
That's good.
I definitely dipped it in a dunk it.
I had a bunch of it.
Well, that's the deal with the Melting part.
Dip it in a dunk it to your heart's delight boy.
It is great.
This is something so different and so delicious.
I'm almost on the edge of thinking coming back down just to go there a few times.
But then again, my blood sugar would go so ring and my weight would go back up.
You see?
It's another good reason for me not to be there.
There's too many dang good joints and like this.
And I weigh about 400 pounds and I'd be in a box.
But I have a smile on my face.
For course, dining experiences what it's at with the Melting Pot start your dinner with
the Melting Pot's round cheese fondue.
It's served with three different breads, Granny Smith apples and crisp veggies.
Next you choice the salads all of the Melting Pot's homemade dressings.
I'm phrased include lobster, filet mignon, shrimp, caged and seasoned chicken, pork, portomato
or shrooms, duck and lots more cooked and oil or broth.
You'll be sitting there dipping and dunking in those fabulous Melting Pot dipping sauces.
And for dessert, this is the experience that makes sex, pale and win significance.
The chocolate fondue is to die for.
Dip your fresh strawberries bananas pineapple.
Now let me ask you do they have the dark and the white chocolate just have the dark.
Well it's whatever you order.
So we had s'mores and cookies and crepe.
So you choose whatever.
Dip it right in there and that chocolate man.
All your fruits and your cheesecake and your bread are topped off with tasty marshmallows
rolled in crepes, Oreos and graham crackers.
It's an experience that'll just set you free.
And don't forget all soft food and Melting Pot restaurants will open Sunday Mother's
Day at one.
Reservations are filling up fast so make yours today.
Don't let my mom be disappointed.
Don't just take her to some pedestrian place for a really special treat.
Take mom to the Melting Pot nearby you for Mother's Day.
Melting Pot and four Lauderdale where these guys had a feast last night.
They're also in Coral Springs, Boka, North Miami Beach Cooper City and Kendall too.

Don't know what pair of rings will do.
And I like buss of color to use.
There's a way to see me in my trailer.
And then I find you no longer here.
You found me day by night's best of failure.
And over hearts of all those forced queers.
And over all those distant sides.
Now you know the job.
It's your toes I walked in by now.
On the half of the season.
There's two lights for the radio.
The room will leave us like this.
Now only shadows we can see.
And see me in the present day for life.
Oh!
That's your moon.
Fire and gun round the door.
No wonder how調 we hide behind those doors.
Look in the back as with dragon sword.

There's some more bad news from Iraq
Why don't you ever read any of the good news from us?
Iraqi President Jalal Talibani said at least a thousand and 91 people have been killed last month in sectarian violence in Baghdad alone
That's just in April
As a much anticipated parliamentary session produced little result
Urging quick efforts to quell the raging Sunni Shi'i communal bloodshed
Talibani said we received a report from the morgue about the deaths in Baghdad
That a thousand and 91 people were killed between April 1 and April 30
We're shocked and angry at the daily reports of unidentified bodies being discovered
And if people killed on the basis of their identity in Talibani
It was quoted as saying a statement issued by his orifice
Anticozion about so many killed over here and so many air
But who's counting you know
Who's counting when you have it a great old time
Pretty good of a large on a march and this hard work you know all this other crap
This is a man who ought to be in federal prison right now your leader
You're the butcher of Washington along with his a deep

A high school student was suspended for five days after singing a spoof of untopable smoky
They put a virus and then includes the risks about shooting a teacher
Bethel Cox 16-8 junior at Peachtree Ridge High School said she had been humming the song during German class
But tonight singing loudly or directing lyrics at her teacher Phil Carroll
Mm-hmm shoot his ass
Like that. I'd had a song stuck in my head all day like the tune of it
She said this kid in front of me asked me about the song so I told him the words. I didn't say them loudly the song includes the lyrics on top of all
Smokey I'll cover with blood. I shot my poor teacher with a 44-slug. I'll write like that
That's yeah, I'll say that in great school. Yeah, loud and proud right throne with that
Put a cap in his head and it turned out he was dead and stuff like that
I'm administrators pulled trots out of class later Friday. That's why she had threatened her teacher
She was suspended Monday
Cox has had differences with the teacher in the past that her mother Suzan Cox
We feel the fact that Carol is some kind of indebted for our daughter and he used this to take a stand against her Suzan
Be saying slow and roach

And his manway lingers on, man, without the malignant presence, without him walking around
picking dingal buries in front of other people. We should have put that on to pick him
dingal buries. Oh, he's probably the only person that does that in pubic.
What's his face just here? It says, for the poll to hear the truth.
Okay, there you go. They hear the truth because the truth he'll set you free.
Well, I talk about it here. I suck up. Okay, thank you so much.
You're going to put that on there to hear the truth or put it on there.

Here's the guy that was getting like serviced a little bit who was horny because he's married to a frigid bull bike.
And you can't play in the guy. And he's under a lot of stress.
And right away, the Republicans, the hypocritical Bible thump and phony,
belonging Republicans who got all those skeletons in their closet.
They're impeaching his ass. And now we've got to get it's the butcher, man.
A butcher who breaks the laws and whatever the hell he feels like it does whatever he wants.
He wants, he feels he's got the, he's the emperor complex. The emperor with a,
it's not the emperor with no clothes. It's the emperor with no brain.
And this guy continues doing it with like computer, man. He keeps the waltz it around.
But it'll be a bit of a bit about, you know, the implorative of the other day peddling this phony Medicare deal.
Phony is an $86 billet woodbine. Down here's record hide. That's because things are going so well.

That's a shot of people like one anymore.

Speaking of that, Molly, I got Molly Evans and I got Marine Dowd.

I'm doing Molly Evans first.
All right.
I'm actually going to read these.
Oh, but no.

Oh, God no.
Oh, there's Jim Clancy.

Yeah, uh-huh.
I really want to.
Molly Evans writes the best little horror house in Washington.
Of course, I'm above sex drugs and rock and roll.
So serious.
So serious a survey of the public interest in my eye can fill you with the best.
I'm my petrude days.
I make David Broder look like paid six in the post.
I don't care what anyone smoked 20 years ago.
I've proved those who boogie till they puke.
And I don't care who anyone in politics is screwing in private, as long as they're not
screwing the public.
On the other hand, if you expect me to pass up a scandal involving poker hookers and
watergate building with crooked defense contractors.
And the number three guy at the CIO named Dusty Fago.
Dusty Fago be still my heart.
You expect too much.
Any journalist who claims hookergate is not a legitimate scandal is dead, has been for
some time and needs to be unplugged.
In addition to sex drugs and rock and roll, hookergate is right for the public interest
questions, misfeasants, malfeasants, and non-feasants.
And then he splatted moral points for the children.
Recommended for Sunday school use grade seven and above.
But for starters, let's consider the unenviable record of Porter-Major Goss of the CIA.
From the beginning of his tenure, Goss has been criticized for politicizing the agency.
He brought a bunch of political hacks with him for staff, one of whom turns out to be
the poker player called Nine Fingers.
And in the end, he was probably fired for not having politicized the agency enough.
What's the polite politicizing an intelligence agency?
So the CIO officials would get a report from some agent in a magazine, looks bad?
The first thing they'd ask was, is this an agent a Republican or a Democrat?
Maybe they really are conservative and subliber, everything in Iraq is hunky-dory.
And there's a giant media conspiracy to hide the joyous tidings.
But as you may recall, the ever-nimble minds of Donny Rumsfeld,
chopped up already tried paying public relations people to invent good news about Iraq,
and then tentative newspapers there and it didn't work.
In fact, it was so stupid it was humiliating.
Luckily, the Pentagon was once again able to investigate itself and determine it had done
nothing illegal.
So now they're turning the CIO over to a general that not only ran the warrantless
wiretapped program, but still can't figure out that it's unconstitutional.
Why do I get to feeling this is W and Carl again flipping the finger with some grown-up they
don't like?
General Michael Hayden had mixed reviews as Director of the National Security Agency.
He's evidently not a good manager, which makes him a perfect bushy.
But he is straightforward enough to have admitted that some warrantless buying has been
done for political reasons.
None of the usual Washington's side has seemed to have a beat on this.
Hayden with theoretically report to John and Grapani, Bush's supposed intelligence
are, Negrupani is widely considered worthless.
His major achievement so far seems to be organizational charts and buying furniture.
You know me, you know conspiracy theories here, but the Bush administration which doesn't
seem to be able to run much, set out to be tool to CIA after 9-11 and the Iraq War.
Problem is, everything that worked at the CIA that warrant about 9-11 and said the
Iraq War was a bad idea was on the hit list.
The Bushies wanted to eliminate the people who were right and promote those who were wrong.
This is no way to shape up an intelligence agency.
You're not to mention the White House spit fit over Joe Wilson's wife.
A spit fit.
Next we need to contemplate sincere, old-fashioned, unindulgeable greed, theft and bribery.
In the beginning there was only Duke Cunningham, the highlighting, fun-loving, super-patrered
congressman from San Diego.
His yacht was called the Dukester.
That's Duke Dash Sturr, the Dukester.
Any adnice taste in 19th century French commodes?
While we're all happy to see our elected representatives enjoying themselves in Washington,
that's real people's money.
Actually the yacht and commode were paid for by defense contractor Brent Wilkes, keep
an eye on that clear.
It was people's money that paid for the defense contract.
Wilkes allegedly bribe public officials in deligning first clients.
The former Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security Clark Kent Irvin, that
would be the VHS equivalent of a police department's internal affairs chief, tried to blow
the whistle on shady contracts at VHS and said with thrown overboard himself.
Folks will never get government straightened out again if we don't keep the IG strong and
independent.
If the Bush administration continues to fall apart of this cliff, I think we'll be grateful
for incompetences and excuse.
That's what Molly, that's Molly's take.
You got it?
I got it.
What the hell is this?
Oh this Johnny.
What is this Johnny spelled J.O.N. and Y?
Chronic.
The frog definition is interesting though.
Oh I see frog, French.
Now what is this from?
Oh from the racial slew database.
The French have said to laugh like frogs.
When they laugh at Adam's apples, bulge out of the next like frogs.
And perhaps the French delicacy of frogs legs.
Another possible derivation is the fluid elite displayed in the French king's banner in
the middle ages.
Which to the English enemy looked like a squatting frog.
That's the UK origin.
The fluid elite, which is still of course on the French can even flag.
Oh yes they do have their own flag.
You do understand?
They also sing.
The national anthem, probably will say mostly in French, a little English thrown in.
Oh what are they going to say?
Oh okay.
I beg your pardon?
What are they going to say at this page?
When they moved to Miami.
We're going to ship all the illegal aliens up there.
They moved to Dania Beach.

I bet you Johnson's impressed even the day after his birthday they're coming through for

I'll be damned.
You probably would have thought after you're playing all that the monkey business with

That's what I heard.
That's the rumor.
6,079 to Marlin Game Boy.
That's pathetic.
And of course the heater playing tonight right?
Yes there.
So you can only imagine how many people are going to be at the Marlin game.
But third man.
Wow.
Oh my god.
I can't even begin to imagine that.
It's going to be rough.
It is going to be a tough one.
So while you real die, the Marlin fans, both of you get out there and we love the Marlins.
They're really good.
Come on.
Pretend you care.
Wearing down rights, father and son reunion.
Boy, she is so good.
She's very weak on TV.
I don't know why.
But she does.
I don't know.
They've ever seen her on Monday.
Why do you don't want such shows anyway?
Right, it is.
She's not good on TV.
Boy, she's here.
Huh?
I've seen her picture.
Why don't mean she don't look good.
Boy, she doesn't really look all like her.
But who cares about that?
You know, she's brilliant.
She's great.
If she looks good, she probably wouldn't know crap.
You know what I mean?
God spreads it around.
That's what I always said.
Damn God.
That's why most great singers are ugly, you know.
Talked about it at the other day.
And most good looking like Brittany, she couldn't sing away at a paper sack.
See?
See the way it works?
Anyway, Marlin writes, and it doesn't cost anything, by the way.
One boy's did it by staying out of bagdad, raising taxes and driving down the deficit.
The other boy's did it by going into bagdad, cutting taxes and driving up the deficit.
But perhaps inevitably, the father and son ended up in an edible tango with the same spot, 31%.
After trying not to emulate his father's presidency in any way,
W. Emulated in the worst possible way.
He came out of a conflict with Saddam as a towering figure with serving approval ratings,
and ended up as a shrunken figure with scalding approval ratings.
Scalding.
In the latest New York Times CBS News poll,
W. is stunning and close and lighted him in a tie with his dad's low point in July 1992,
four months before the public traded in Poppy for Bill Clinton.
As Saddam Nagrani and Megan Thieno did in their Times article today,
there's the lowest approval rating for any president in the last half century,
other than Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter.
Even Hillary Clinton's got a more favorable rating than W.
34%.
The president can draw some solace.
John Kerry's got 26 and algorithms at 28%,
and Dick Cheney's in the bunker at 20%.
But in a new poll, even many of the party faithful are dumb.
Only 45% of evangelical Christians,
69% of Republicans and 51% of conservatives,
like the way W. is taking care of business.
A whopping 70% deemed the country pretty seriously on the wrong track,
and two-thirds considered the nation in worship now when W. took over.
On the issues that earned Carl Robes' nickname, Boy Genius,
values national security, the shift was notable.
50% of respondents said Democrats came closer to sharing their moral values,
compared with 37% of Republicans did,
and the GOP retains a tenuous advantage on being seen as strong around terrorism.
The numbers for those who think we did the right thing by invading a rack
are steadily dropping, and the numbers are rising for those believe we should have stayed out.
Many Americans have simply lost faith in the administration's ingenuity.
Only a quarter of those pulled up much confidence in W's ability to handle a crisis,
a mere 9% are sure he can successfully end the war in Iraq,
and a Paltry 4% think the administration has a clear plan to keep gas prices down.
But can Trump's list Nancy Pelosi lift their spirits for a few Nidia?
The boy's presidency has devolved into an assertion of empty will.
The White House blew off warnings from Republicans in Congress
about appointing General Michael Hayden to see IH chief.
You know you're in trouble when conservative threat that the military is getting too much power.
If W really cared about getting good intelligence for his war on terror,
he never would have appointed Porter-Mircha Goss in the first place.
That wasted more than 18 months,
that could have been used fixing this functional agency,
and drove out some really good officials.
Mr. Goss, the cheney toady, was appointed because
W and Vice wanted him to do a hostile takeover language
to clear out suspected leakers, especially tarot-intribute,
now-contents, critics of the war, or anyone else who wasn't with the program.
Before the Iraq invasion, it was about fixing the intelligence around the policy.
Now it's about appointing yes men and enforcing loyalty.
The Bush warriors didn't want good intelligence in the first place
because it would have told them they were wrong about
so that I'm as ties to Al-Qaeda and WMD.
Now they're still more concerned with turf battles and with truth-tellers
and finding someone anyone who can tell us where Osama is.
Osama, who?
Even then he has to.
The Republican speaker has scoffed at the Hayden move as a
Negropoddy power grab.
The General as a cheney pal was stood up for the White House's right to be
unconstitutional, going along with the heinous warrantless snooping.
Then it makes him one of the team ready for a promotion or a metal of freedom.
Helloed out the account, accommodating when dark cheney comes over to the
Langley to work around the enlist and oversee the evidence building case for
sending bombs, red, and diplomats to Iran.
Now that we're dealing with praised Iranian President, dreaming of nuisance
writing an 18-page letter that sounds like an Israel-hating Islamic version of the rapture,
wouldn't it be great if our spokes could stop fighting and go spy on somebody?
That's marine doubt stake.
You go, Moray, and you go, Gal.
I think she's gone?
No.
Probably the death row she keeps her in stuff like that, with this crowd we got now.
They don't tolerate such insubordination.
In fact, Joyce's insubordination, you can be fired at it and she's going to put you in a contract.
It's a good thing to try to put all I crap in your contract.
Oh, it's the standard crap which has that.
Does?
Everyone else's, yeah, hasn't the...
No, it does not.
No, it doesn't have.
When I say everyone else's, I'm talking about the normal people and not the big stars.
Well, the normal people when I have contracts, just an out of contract.
The beast don't have a contract.
What other people...
What other people can you tell me you got a contract?
Most of the people have contracts like the salespeople, the staff, they all have that.
The staff?
Yeah.
And Gossal Probe?
The student, if he doesn't already.
Robert?
Yeah.
Robert's got a contract.
Pretty sure.
Get out of here.
You're a crazy person man.
Robert, he reapers got a freaking contract.
Most of the people that are anywhere near the air have a contract.
If I told you once, I've told you at times that he...
He had something to put a contract on him.
I got news for Robert.
If you saw God, Robert III, I'd be real careful next time I put those glasses on.
Now, what was that Don's name that got the glasses in the neck there at the end?
I don't know.
I've only done an out of the belly.
Was that it? Don?
A develop?
No, that was...
I wallocked down out of the belly.
But you get with it.
You better rewatch God, Father III.
No, no, no, no, no.
Just hold your nose.
Just hold...
Just hold Sophia's nose.
Hold more than that.
Hold your water.
Don, not Don Tomasino.
That was the one with the leg bone off.
That was the good thing.
That was the good thing.
That was the good thing.
That was Don Finucci.
That was the good thing.
Godfather II, that was the black hand.
It was the...
Tiddler with the leg bone there.
And then all of a sudden...
That's a thing.
Robert the Neor just cut it loose.
I like to see Godfather II when he stole the carpet.
Him and the young Luca Bratzi, that was great.
Remember that?
Bruno Turtle, the carpet up.
Call 14 at 560.
That's a bad Godfather music.
I went out and got the hose the other day.
That's bad.
That's very unfortunate.
Well, it's a poor music from the Godfather,
but not from the original soundtrack.
It's by the Hollywood studio orchestra in St. Petersburg.
I'm going to have to watch that.
It just looks so authentic, you know?
I got a hose.
That is that...
Make you a hoser?
It's a great thing.
No, it makes them a hoser.
It sold it to me.
Sometimes it's the things that you can't see that really are bad for you.

She was hanging with another man.
But just went home now.
For a night past key mask.

But he will surely be jailed for life.
I'm out of people that are sick.
They feel bad for Roger.
They forget it, okay.
Oh, that's why.
Yeah.
Hacked away, man.
Hacked on five, they don't jail black.
They were foreshades by the news.
You were reporting.
I heard some of the votes on the pool.
I got another one for the pool.
That was it.
That was it.
I was like, I would have glasses on the K.O.
Oh, Lucio.
And who was it that gave him the glasses in the neck?
It was a collar.
Like I said, collar.
He was avenging his body.
They're not a casino.
Isn't that who he was avenging?
That is correct.
And the other one, the evil security guard was Fabrizio.

Fabrizio.
There's a waiter in my favorite restaurant in Rome named Fabrizio.
Who was a real skinny guy.
And I guess I guess grandpa died.
And all of a sudden he got all depressed.
And whatever.
And he bloomed up like a bullfrog.
Like somebody put a bicycle pump up his leg.
And then now he's lost a little weight last time.
I was there in Rome.
In La Trautlavia.
Oh, man.
Seriously, before you croak, before they stay,
I'm talking to everybody.
Not just you guys, everybody.
Before you croak, before they stick your ass in a box,
you must go to Rome and really enjoy the food there.
And you will.
Well, I promise you.
Take Josh Whitty.
Now it had a new deal.
In fact, Josh, if you're smart, you probably
would have gotten folded in there.
Maybe you folded a Rome trip.
Let's just stop it around.
Yeah, that sounds good.
Well, not just a Rome trip, a European trip.
A couple days in Amsterdam.
I hear it.
Maybe two or three in Rome, a manger manger.
And then back to Amsterdam for like to work it off a little bit.
And you will have a bread.
And then probably want to go back to Rome
because you work up a hearty appetite in Amsterdam.
First of all, the food sucks.
And then you'll be smoking at bad stuff.
Good stuff.
Work up a heavy duty effort.
I've got to be frustrating.
And one of the Dutch wind up being such a bunch of turd, you know what?
They're always starving death.
And there's nothing but those nasty fries around with that greasy brown sauce.
I have a feeling that sauce might come out of the canals from the looks of it.
Where the hell was that the other day where they have that...
Oh, a taco bell.
The bread sauce.
Because they also have...
I told you they have the KFC and the Taco Bell together side by each.
And somebody's joints.
And it was at the KFC and somebody was ordering fries with...
I don't know.
And then they had that brown...
That's big here too, as a matter of fact.
I see fries places in the malls and they have that brown gravy they put out.
Oh, good hand.
Huh?
That's good.
Is it?
Yeah.
Well, what is it?
It's like brown gravy, like beef gravy, like you put on mashed potatoes.
Mashed taters?
But those are on fries, man.
Greasy fries that a deep fried material kissed your mouth.
Whatever, the potato.
It's a bigger, organic tumor.
Oh, potatoes are the night shades.
They're deadly.
Do you ever hear that?
The deadly night shades?
Yeah.
Well, what is that?
I know.
You know, most of the nutritionist, man, they're like crazy people.
I'm not saying that they're not...
In fact, you'll never believe this.
There was a very nice young lady, very friendly, maybe a little too friendly.
Playing next to me and she kept showing me her engagement ring and she's getting married this fall.
And blah, blah, blah.
In fact, she has the jackpot.
She got the three diamonds and she got 60 under a buck.
Then she put most of it back like an idiot.
I don't know what the hell she's thinking about.
I mean, if you want 60 under a buck, wouldn't you take it and walk away?
Oh, yeah.
I would have a buck.
Just walk away.
Yeah, and have a big smile on your face.
Not this young lady.
Anyway, let's say I lost my train of thought.
We were just talking about the brown sauce.
I forget what that all was.
It was very important.
Oh, no, no.
No, no.
No, no.
I was, you know, because I'm sitting there in the servers keep coming by with the sodas, you know, the free sodas, you give them a tip, whatever.
And side drink a gallons and gallons of that caffeinated diet soda all day.
That's my big complaint.
Besides the fact that the machines are tighter than the snare drum.
But, and she says to me, oh, you drink, what do you drink?
And I said, die, folks.
Oh, and that as per thing.
She said, you know, that stuff turns to wood alcohol on your body.
I thought she was going to give me a lecture on nutrition.
Yeah, when you're in the casino, you're not interested in having somebody give you like a health lecture.
You know what I'm saying?
You have to.
Jesus, God almighty, especially some of fat old slub like me, I want her to give me, you know, what for?
I'm glad she put most of the money back.
How do you like that?
Or, narrowly, you know, if people are fairly nice, I'll root for them to win, but in her case, I'm glad she put it back.
I don't want to hear about my diet soda, okay?
I like my diet soda.
It's refreshing and I like chewing the ice too.
That's probably why I got my, although my neck problems mostly gone.
Aren't you pleased to hear about that?
That's good.
My throat problem is 100% and my neck is like, I'd say about about 90%.
I'm not sure it was that mineralized stuff, that deep ice stuff I bought.
I don't know what this guy has anything to do with that.
I think it's just, maybe I had like a pinch of nerve in my neck.
Or maybe like you suggested, by plunge and so much, there's spending so many hours, I'm working it out.
You know, I'm working out the kinks.
Pull it with the other arm for a while.
The love is this fast moon.
I know what you're talking about, okay?
I tried that.
It's like reaching across your body and then it puts you in a lot of balance, man.
It's not good.
Reaching across.
Well, it's the machine to your left that way.
Now that's a great idea.
That's an excellent idea.
I'll pay it like some of these broads that are out there.
I'll pay all the machines.
I'll go, man, some of those people I'd like to kill them.
Quick to steal them and then they'll like to kill them.
Put my stool right there in the middle and watch them all run like hell.
Watch them scatter.
Who's stool is that?
Oh, that's my stool.
Oh, geez.
Wow.
I think that girl had a point.

Bittians, dumb ass jerks.
Absolutely.
Every job has got 1.
Like 7 million made of border run.
I hear a protest for the rights of an alien.
The safest law is so.
I can't do it.
Our daily goals are Spanish speaking foreign people.
They got no reason for the event.
They even got to my school.
And as they say things like things good enough, they just sit on a corner till you fit them up.
It would change their life if they didn't make your fool.
That's where all the school is.
And it's not just politicians who are playing the fool.
We're filled with all this emotion that we can get through.
They take the kind of jobs that we do not want to do.
Give them green cards, make it legal.
Or else shut up for found it.
Come for the three we got.
I never 91 votes by the time I clicked that baby again.
We're going to be over 1000 already.
We got a long way to go.
We got all the way till the early time.
We're five.
Got some good news.
Good news from Bill Nelson.
And for people who hate what's going on in America today like poison.
Good news.
Okay.
Rejecting appeals from governor fat ass to have abortion.
Other top Republicans.
House Speaker Alan Benz, who evidently has a little sense, said today he will not challenge US representative
Catherine Eris for the party's nomination for US Senate.
She got about as much chance of getting elected as the gender to Rick the Janner.
He's not a bad guy, but who knows from him.
His specialty is like most politicians garbage.
Benz and Panama City just completed a second final term of the state house.
It has been wooed by several top party members to give the T.O.P.
primary against terrorists who is good by Bush and others is having a little chance against Democratic and come at Bill Nelson.
I've been extremely honored and humbled by the strong support and encouragement I've received from my family, my friends, and from people across Florida who I admired greatly.
Ben said they statement released by his legislative orifice today.
However, I've decided not to run for the US Senate.
He said it was confident that he could beat Harris and Nelson.
Ultimately, his decision came down to the fundamental question of whether he was willing to spend the next six, twelve or maybe eighteen years of his life away from his family and home serving Florida in the US Senate.
After much thought and prayer, I realized the answer to that question is, you never try to make a chance.
The fat ass governor said yesterday, Harris had dropped solo in public opinion polls. She can't unseat Nelson.
I just don't think she can win.
I know we did that yesterday. It's worth putting out again.
Bush pointed out polls showing Harris is running about 30 points behind Bill Nelson.
He's been dogged by staff turnover and that acceptance of 32 grand in illegal campaign condoverations from defense contractor Mitchell Wade who pleaded guilty to driving four US representative of the Duke, the Dukester, Duke cutting him.
I'd like that.
I'd like to ask the last one Harris against Bill Nelson. That's like the Marlins against the Braves.
Don't forget 730 again.
How are they going to compete with the heat?
They're not going to.
They're not going to.
I don't know what their season attendance is.
I mean, their season ticket order number is, but whatever it is, that's what the number is going to be because it'll be the actual attendance will be less.
You follow over saying in other words, there's a minimum number and that's always whatever the season tickets are.
In other words, if they're a 3500 season ticket order, they can't put less than 3500 on their correct account.
You're about ready to buy the ticket.
Yes.
Plus those who were thinking about showing up and those who may have been there in the last couple of weeks and those who might come next Monday.
I don't think they're probably playing a whole next Monday, but nevertheless, maybe they will.
And if you show up, maybe they'll be game.
Look at that. We got a thousand one votes. I didn't even click it again.
Aren't you excited about that? We got a thousand one just sitting here on my fat smelly ass.
But that's good. That is really good. I wonder how this other song's not playing the right now.
Looking for a leader?
I always say it's Bob Lumin and looking for love in all the wrong places, but that's not who it is.
Who did that song? Johnny Patriot. Now who did it? Looking for love?
Oh, you don't know?
Bobby Wolberg.
No. Come on. I always say Bob Lumin.
What time I started Bob?
Oh, let's think about living was Bob Lumin.
That's better.
Let's think about living.
Is this the song you take it up?
What are you talking about?
This is looking for love.
That's not it.
That's...
That's an aryorker.
It's a country song looking for love in all the wrong places.
Oh, Mickey Gilly.
Who?
Mickey Gilly. I didn't know you were talking about the country version.
Mickey Gilly.
What the hell is that?
Mickey Gilly, my ass.
I'll go get a fat Mickey Gilly.
Look at him for a year.
Greenock Country House.
Greenock Country House.
Greenock Country House.
Greenock Country House.
Greenock Country House.
Greenock Country House.
There you go. Good Canadian boy.
Neil Young counted like it is.
I'm going to play that in the 1 o'clock hour.
Looking for a leader.
And then we'll play Lichtenpeaks the President.
And then we'll play Prison Bits a couple of times.
We'll have that baby licked.
See, there's more one way it's just going to count.
Now, you know how many times we've talked about crap.
Crap?
No, crap.
People are stupid.
You know about silly stuff that people fetch a lot of money for.
And every time we talk about that, we mention Andy Warhol.
And justifiably so.
This is art.
And Andy Warhol canvas portraying a can of Campbell Soup was auctioned off for nearly $11.8 million.
Today, Christie's auction house reports.
$11.8 million for painting of a Campbell Soup can.
The sale of a small torn Campbell's NSA.
It's got the picture here. It's a pepper pot soup.
By the way, you'll be happy to know.
Yes.
Because according to Bokobrion, it was Bobby Wilmeck.
Oh, sorry, Bob Lumin.
Then there was Bob Lumin.
There's a version by Wailing Jennings.
And another one by Mickey Gowley.
And another one by Johnny Lee.
I think he's wrong.
Johnny Lee.
That's who it was, Johnny Lee.
Looking for love.
You don't know the song.
I'm talking about the great song.
I'm just telling you, there's five versions of it.
So, and I hate all of them.
You don't like that song?
No, I'm not.
Oh, that's one of my favorite along with the white sport coat and a pink carnation.
The pink part, you know.
That was party robbing.
Right.
Do you tell me, like I don't know that?
I interviewed Marty Garvey.
I interviewed Marty Garvey.
I interviewed that.
I interviewed Marty Garvey.
I interviewed Marty Garvey.
I interviewed Marty Garvey.
I interviewed Marty Garvey.
I interviewed Marty Garvey.
I interviewed Marty Garvey.
I interviewed Bert Larr.
Looks like we made it.
Lose control.
Looking for love.
Where is it?
Oh, Johnny Lee.
Oh, looking for love.
J. Garvey, Bobbi Womack.
That's a different song.
Looking for love.
Looking for love.
And all around.
Places 580 Johnny Lee.
It's not Bob Lumin.
In fact, I'll bet you what I said, Bob Lumin was.
Let's think about living.
Huh?
Well, I hate country.
But every now and then there's one song, you know, that really gets to you.
It's pretty good.
I haven't watched it a while.
Bob Lumin, 760, 1960.
Let's think about living.
That was almost as...
And I was okay.
It was in the same genre as I can help.
Who did that I can help?
Oh, God, why I hate that song.
And you don't know that one?
Yeah, but who is the heck of it?
I can help.
That was a medley of his smash.
There was a one-hit wonder.
Thanks, God.
Can I get back to Andy's Warhold?
The sale of small-torn Campbell Soup Can pepperpot.
A 62-canvacet a record for work from the artist's Campbell Soup series.
Artie Leroy Gaggotian delivered the winning bid for the item,
which had an estimated price of between 10 and 15 million.
He was bidding for Eli Broad and LA Collector and Finance here in New York Times and Port today.
Oh, here it is.
I can help.
Killy Sward.
Oh, I hope that that's his swan song.
And it was because we never heard of it.
Sorry, I'm so getting it.
I could remember that.
I can help.
Billy Twain.
Yeah, and they played that 8 million times in a half.
Nice talk, huh?
Here's a little bit of it.
The painting came from the collection of Irving Blum,
an art gallery director that gave Warhold his first show.
This is just...
And then there was another one, British David Hockney.
His 1967 A Neat Lawn.
It doesn't have the picture here, but I can just imagine.
Fetched 3.6 million and was snapped up by an Asian art collector.
You know, this business of art.
I'm not, no, I'm not kind of a swirr of art.
Okay, nothing about it.
I'm just an old slob.
But, you know, the idea that the suitcase can or like,
it's like that scene in the last years.
My stays.
Reminds like years.
It's like that scene in the front of the house, you know.
Right.
How long did it seem to you that how many hours did it seem?
About 30 minutes.
Let me tell you something about art.
You're just as qualified as any suit.
Right.
Because you have eyes.
Right.
I hate the model art.
What's their excuse?
Their suits.
Oh.

Top 48 at 5-60-WQ-A-M, man.
We know Joel Fienberg, that's for damn sure.
What a jackass.
WQ-A-M, hello.
Is this Q-A-M?
Yes sir.
Uh, and they went and gone radio or talking to the DJs and they're trying to figure out a song who sang it.
I know the history of it. I can't believe they don't know what song was that.
Looking for love in all the wrong places.
As Mickey Gilly, he thought it meant the movie Urban Cowboy, Remember Bird in 50,
and Remember Gilly's the Bar Gilly's.
No, that's the thing.
What I said, would it even be a champion if they don't know it?
We've only said it three times by everybody who ever sang it.
I get to last time years, he must have last year build up.
He's just trying to be helpful and you're a bust in his balls.
Well, that's right. Who do we side to head on it?
Johnny Lee. Right.
Well, they all had to hit with it.
No, we did not.
They don't follow the country charts.
They did not. Maybe in the country charts, right?
But not in the build more.
Where would you look at the country charts?
Country charts.
Country charts is for Yahoo Farts.
Okay. Mickey Gilly.
Okay. So he did it in somebody.
Who cares when you come right down?
But the guy was trying to be helpful and you're seeing he was a good car.
He sounded like he was under the age of 100.
And maybe he was representing what would go on.
He would not miss anything.
Okay. He wasn't even Miss America.
What is wrong with you?
I remember that song by Eddie Murphy spoofing it on Saturday night live.
Oh, Eddie Murphy had a hit with it too.
That's right.
Looking for that.
Could he sing or what?
Eddie Murphy.
I think that's what got to him.
And he realized that all of a sudden he couldn't be all things to all people.
He's stopping funny and that's when he got hooked up with a hooker.
Would that transvest that tranny?
Wasn't that Eddie Murphy?
Yeah, it was.
A lot of guys got hooked up with his attorneys.
Is that Eddie Murphy?
Yes, it is.
No. Come on.
I'd choice you not.
At the hood.
Thousand twenty-one hosts and the people who wrote this song, don't you?
What song is that?
This song here.
And who wrote it for?
No, Eddie Murphy.
No, he didn't write it.
Eddie Murphy singing it.
I bet you.
I don't even know what the hell it is.
It's his hit.
I did hit with it.
You know, it's good for him.
But it was written by...
Rick James.
Well, who cares?
Come on, Eddie.
Where are you, Eddie?
I'm here to sing.
And if I were to meet these days, I'd be hiding too.
I'd take a long time.
Eddie.
Eddie, you can do it, sweetheart.
He's impersonating people, see?
But I'm a big came, but he will.
We're 10 years of senior key man.
I'm a big day, man.
So you just stepped all over for Eddie.
Okay, that's enough.
I would say.
There's another guy, man.
A legend in his own mind.
He was the Joel Feinberg of music.
Trav 50, 10 before one.
Although, at least he did it with...
Now I guess he did with somebody else's money too.
I'm sure that.
WKYM, hello.
Information and links to real estate organizations.
Okay, thanks.
I would ask one of my favorites too.
WQAM, Ola.
QAM.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I was out of the loop, but I'm back.
I know.
Okay.
No, you're out of the loop and you're still out of the loop.
You'll always be loopy.
Yeah, you'll always be loopy to us.
Go away.
WQAM, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
I'm moving out of Florida.
Where are you going, Pally?
In the tunic of Mississippi.
I'm going to be damned.
Going to be a poker dealer and open up a cabinet shop.
All right, next one.
That's the luck to you, Pally.
I'm going to get another box one of these days.
All right, that's the box, man.
I'm still using it.
Thanks a lot.
Bye.
You demand.
That's the guy that made that big nice box.
Right.
So you're going to rest in there.
Very nice box.
No, it is a beautiful thing.
You're going to get all the light bulbs.
Remember, somebody sent me a whole bunch of light bulbs.
I'll put your ashes in there.
That would be a good idea.
I'll put my ashes in there.
I got four of them.
1025 votes out of pool.
Man, that pool is hot today.
It is heavy duty.
In every other song that I have heard lately,
some fellow gets shot.
Well, I like that.
It's about luminous.
I don't know why Brian said this to me.
The commission this guy starts to think about living in 1960.
I like that.
I don't know.
Let's think about living.
Okay, that's enough.
That kind of...
Yeah, let's play a country music.
You know, this station, I don't know if you remember it,
but before they finally put this sports talk garbage on the station,
you remember what it was?
I don't know whether they were cymbal casting.
They were doing like different country music.
No, no, they had their own.
And I have a QAM country bumper sticker on the cabinet over here.
My little song.
Oh, right.
Yeah, just for you.
It was QAM country, man.
They had kits on FM and country on AM, which...
You know, I mean, is that show you some amazing things?
Of course, that wasn't the measly beeslees.
No.
That was the...
What those are names?
Oh, wireless?
No, two live Jews.
Sunshine wireless, yeah.
That's what Bill called, he used to call them, two live Jews.
Bill got cancer and he was on the verge of passing.
And they sent him a message by messenger.
It was, oh, well, don't come back.
That was not even a phone call.
This don't come back.
Your service isn't no longer needed.
And we hope you, you know, died in good health.
Or whatever they said.
The two live Jews.
I forget what their names were.
Real A-holes.
Sunshine wireless, my ass.
Then Greg Reed came plopper long on the scene.
Oh, boy.
The Greg Reed scene.
And then just when we thought we'd seen it all,
then all of a sudden, Colin came clara bell.
Oh, brother.
I'm glad you guys had a good chat, though, Bill.
Yesterday.
It was a nice time.
Did you have a good time?
Yes, we did.
I never have a good time when he comes in there in the morning to talk to me.
There we had a conversation in the office that used to be Greg's.
Yes.
And I think that's the first time that I've had a conversation in there.
Really, right?
I mean, you know,
Oh, well, I was sitting in my machine.
I was thinking about the day that things were going to be.
And they called you off the show twice, right?
In the same day, right?
When they were conducting the speaking of higher pali,
the fat boy inquisition way through the bus.
Right?
That the treasure island business,
and you supposedly were like, you know, overcharging them all this other bullcrap.
And Greg, of course, did his best to browbeat you and throw you under the bus and fat boy.
And he will like listen to tires up to see if they could stick your ass under there.
That was not in his office?
No, that was in the conference room.
On a conference room?
Sure.
Remember the whole staff were assembled.
Really?
I mean, everything.
Everyone with a title.
This is the name you were out sick that day.
Josh worked.
Remember the guy that sent me that anxious facts about how I'm out of touch in Miami is making this big comeback.
And it's the epicenter of the universe.
Remember that crap?
Yeah, in the world, I believe he said it.
Oh, yes.
I said the universe.
Maybe just the world.
Well, cruise ship lines abandoned Miami as a port of call.
How do you like that?
Oh, my God.
Oh, when the Norwegian spirit set sail this evening

And by the way, all you guys stay out of there.
It will soon say it will say Bon Voyage to Miami as a port of call.
The New York based cruise ship no longer plans to visit Miami.
Even though it's the epicenter of the universe.
It's the epicure of the universe.
Epicure is still open out in the road.
Right, thank God.
They were shop at the epicure market?
Nope.
No. They don't like going in there.
No, they like anybody with money. It's a great place.
In fact, that's right down the street from where the villa deli used to be right there.
I don't know.
Soon remember the villa deli.
Absolutely.
Kishpoy.
That was good.
Royal Caribbean's grandeur of the seas will start calling on Miami in July during the series of 9 days.
It's in the race from Baltimore.
Delivering 2,000 plus passengers to local tourist attractions.
But beyond that, Miami, the world's cruise cap remains a little more than a place where people begin and end their cruises.
No ships call regularly on port every way it's in Broward.
Also a busy cruise departure point.
Now, there was a lot of people who are living but they're not going into town and spend no money.
So all those people you see at the airport, you know, they're holding the signs up this cruise line
and they're grabbing people off the plane.
They're throwing airs right on the ship to make sure they get air be last dime.
They even turn those people upside down to make sure they get every last dime falls on.
Like make green.
She used to hide a few quarters in her room.
Correct.
And then they'd hold her upside down.
They'd fall right out.
For all its glamour, South Florida has yet to catch on as a place where cruise lines pull up and encourage their passengers to spend a few hours at local tourist attractions.
Those same attractions which usually see lulls between the weekends have come to enjoy in the region's Wednesday visits as a midweek pickup.
No mo tonight is finito, baby.
That's it.
No mo.
Stacy Shonasey, a long owl in New York mom who recently visited Miami's a passenger board in the region's spirits,
says, Miami's just like New York except for those palm trees.
It's hotter and the water is clearer.
She said I rather be in a place that's more quiet and laid back.
Well, whatever that means.
I guess Miami, I don't know what she's talking about.
Maybe it's higher.
Ain't nothing going on there.
Except for a new stadium, baby.
We got the new stadium in the mall and you ferry.

Right by my best morning, Jerome Andrew.
The losing is not okay here right now.
We could sit here and say yes with the lowest payroll in the game, and half of our rockers, rookies,
and the tough situation and the really division and say, you know, it's okay to lose, but it's not okay.
It's not okay with Jeffery.
It's not okay with Joe.
It's not okay with me.
You know, we are expecting these guys to get better and for this.
I know you want to see some action, and we have been very aggressive in the past with Trace,
and trying to improve the club, and it's just not something that is really an option for us right now.
But guys don't throw a spike.

So Rude just looks at Lee the other way.
Yeah.
No, there was a guy on the other side too, but he's like him right away.

making him one of the highest-ranking former intelligence officials
to criticize the program in cubic analysts say.
This activity is not authorized in,
as part of a panel discussion on eavesdropping
that was sponsored by the New York Public Library.
The Bush Administration needs to get away from the idea
they can continue doing it, he said.
He called them the President to walk into the modern world
and change the law governing the wiretaps
or abandon the program altogether.
Quick break in the free laws.
Or go to jail for breaking the law.
Right.
Exactly.
We're getting peaked in, go to jail.

The city isn't going to pussy put around when it comes to stray cats.
And that cute little play on words there.
The city council there is decided that anyone who feeds the cutler creatures are aiding a nuisance.
Oh, amen. I'll say amen to that.
Mayor Rodney Wagner says police could photograph people who feeds stray cats.
And violators could be sent letters warning them of the consequences and be fined and it.
Police chief Arthur Sullivan said people don't understand the problem.
So Van Stewart is dead or aware of fine.
I can't believe that. Can you believe it?
Oh, that's pretty shocking.
People find those cats sweet, cutlery and lovelable.
He said it's one of those situations you're not going to win no matter what you do.
Nonetheless, however, Sullivan said something needs to be done.
The trick will be finding a solution.
We have people who feed the wild cats and the cats leave something behind.
He said, won't God be able to use this hot tub?
Oh, maybe just if he's just be smart and forget a little ear box.
Right?
I think even cats in a wild look for the litter box.
That whole notion, man.
What if he had a pet elephant, a pet gorilla?
Yeah, a hippo, you know, right?
You need a big box.
I guess.
And then you have to not only have ear plugs, you also have to have nose plugs to go with it.
A lot of people, when Gelly comes in, there are a lot of less groups who do put the nose plugs in.

I can't believe we got all these things.
How do you do that, Semener?
It's amazing.

Oh, no, wait a minute, that's not it.
I'm not finding it.
I thought he says, I knew it was you, Frater.
I knew it was you.
You got that?
No, I don't.
Sure you do.
I know it was you, Frater.
You broke my heart.
What?
I broke my heart.
Oh, I think he was like, I know it was you, Frater.
I think you broke my heart.
You broke my heart.

left and left and feeling betrayed.
I didn't even know about that, did you?
No, I missed that.
I love you a Bush in a peck.
With the help of his brother, Crane, also known online as CT Keith,
launched www.dumpcho.com,
putting the image of the kiss on page one of the websites
he hopes to bring about Lieberman's political demise.
That's dumpcho.com.
With it, the brand for president who proudly wears a button
bearing the photo, all passes out buttons everywhere he goes.
Join what might have been a passing storm, but has become a political norrister
threatening to tear it down the house of Joe, to which we say,
the go.
The feeling was there, Crane,
saying during a recent chapter, many of drinking liberally
a pro-democrat meeting group in New Haven.
I started the website.
I started going to the Democratic Rents to put the notion that everyone's ear
that it was okay to say what you mean about Joe.
That it's okay to say Joe is not acting like a good Democrat.
He's acting like a far-bisoned orthodoxy.
Since dumpcho.com made its debut last year,
he has several other blogs and websites like Tom to go.
And my left nutmeg.com.
My left nutmeg.com.
To name two, have been launched.
A dumpcho video project has been planned a type of anti-Lieberman activity
has been spreading on the Internet.
With enthusiasm and the reminiscent of the Howard Dean presidential campaign,
these Democrats plan to take down the center.
Many of them help putting off his in the first place.
Well, good.
Better late than ever.
Lieberman knows the acknowledges that antagonist but campaign spokesman Sean Smith said,
he's not daunted.
He said, hubman-drared.
He thinks the emergence of blogs is an exciting development
for citizens to engage in political discourse as Smith.
But it does get a little strange.
We're not used to this kind of opposition from our own party.
Well, too bad.
Get used to it.
He said there are no plans for a pro-lieberman blog.
It was Lieberman's opposing his own party.
He says one time supporter, James Iver,
that made him join the fight with time to go.jo.com.
All of a sudden Joe was going on Fox News.
Out of hiding the Democrats on the President's Plan for Social Security reform.
He went from someone who was his voting with Bush.
This someone who was actually attacking the Democratic base.
Once a part of Stanford's close-knit Jewish community,
which the Lieberman family belonged, in fact both families attended the same shul.
Iver, who now lives in California, said he wanted a Hitler-Liberary Lieberman
where it would hurt his war chest.
He created time to go.jo.com to raise money for any qualified candidate
to run against Lieberman's Democratic Party.
Good.
Dump his ass.
Okay.
Fully baloney.
Piece of turd.
By the way, what do you hear nowadays about Ariel Sharon?
Not a lot.
Nothing.
Nothing.
The rule was I'm hearing around the Jew community is that it was that last real hard,
home-intestiate-year-go-perm.
Erdi said something the other day.
Did he really?
No, that wasn't it.
It was more like...
I'm dying out of here.
A year of university historian is uncovered with a 1918 letter that seems to lend
a validity of the Lord that the year of university's ultra-secret,
skull-and-bone society swiped the skull of American Indian leader Geronimo.
Do you know that?
Get married that rumor.
They swiped it.
And it turned out to be Dana Bash, the old shrunken head on CNN for a sheet just.
You know what they have on there?
They have a lot of really anxious people.
I know that word is I used to say much, but they have a lot of despicable people on there.
Yes, they do.
All they found me, I think, did the...
They do, speaking of the spick part, they dumped the ricksonches.
I can't find him no more.
Thank God.
Well, there's one less despicable.
Yes.
The letter written by one member of skull-and-bone society reports that the skull and some
of the Indian leaders remains were spirited from his burial plot in Fort Silo-Klauma
to a stone to a new haven in the series of the Thubbshead Court.
It's a good place for it.
It's a burial ground for anything alive.
A court of skull-and-bones legend members, including President Bush's grandfather,
Press God Bush, that Nazi sympathizer, dug up Geronimo's grave and a group of army volunteers from here
were stationed at the Fort during WWI.
Geronimo died in 1909.
Geronimo!
I don't know that all that much about Geronimo.
In fact, I probably do a little more research on my engines, you know, before I die.
Probably fun.
Find out more about the engines.
Sure what it is.
One of the things I remember was that shameful campaign they ran to scare campaign when the
slot thing was on about it.
Oh my God, it's going to be bad and evil and bring crime in a mob and then in the meantime,
of course, they want it.
You know, they got their own bastardized version and they want it.
You know, it's one thing to get even with the white man, but it's going overboard a little bit.
But I'm saying, they'll overkill.
19-till-two, Gelly is standing by and more on tonight's big peak game.
Maybe they'll eat in the next.
Oh man, if it's like game number one, look out now.
My, my, that was bad.
And it was right there in the triple A arena, wasn't it, Josh?
That's right.
They were not white hot.
Now, they were like icy cold, like the icy cold sleeve.
Maybe they were wearing icy cold sleeve up their patch, right there.
Something.
Because they sure are played like it.
I think they want to get it.
That's you to that.
Just like audible, man, Sabre's got their number.
Trust me.
And just like what's the other one?
Caroline, they got those over their plane.
Who's Caroline a plane?
That, that, that, that.
Jersey.
Jersey.
Get with it, man.
You better get with it.
Jersey goes ahead with 20 seconds left in the game in the third period.
And then with three seconds left, Caroline and Tyson deal.
And then, when's it over time?
How do you like that?
Two goals and 20 seconds.
Against the, and the, the, the time goal against that frog, Marten, board, doer.
How do you like that?
They're maples, huh?
Marty?
Froggy?
Hey, what's better than staying cool and comfortable all summer long?

The main ritual of the unlikely allies has been underway for months.
Clinton set political tongues wagging last month by attending a Washington party celebrating the 10th anniversary of Fox News, the cable news channel owned by Murdoch.
Oh boy!
When it doubts just sell right out, bitch!
The ice princess!
I she- I I don't like her.
I could lie to you, and I think she's great, but I don't like her.
Even a little bit.
The Times quoted one on the insources describing the Clinton Murdoch connection this way.
They have a respectful and cordial relationship.
He has respect for the work she's done on behalf of New York.
I wouldn't say it was illustrative of a close ongoing relationship.
It's not like they were dining out together.
The fundraiser will take place in July.
The newspaper said Clinton is the front-runner of Yadda Yadda Yadda.
Yadda Yadda Yadda, she's worked hard to take the edge off her reputation as a card-carrying liberal.
If she's have gone so far on the other side, maybe she can look with Zoolie Bremen.
She's collaborated with congressional conservatives on some piece of legislation calling for a common ground on abortion
and cut a political figure someone left to use decidedly un-liberal.
She's just a political opportunist.
That's all she is.
That's it.
She's playing on her husband's name.
That's all she's doing.
That's how she got in the Senate.
That's what she's doing right now.
It wants to be President.
Bitch.
I don't like her.
I don't like her.
I'd rather have El Gore any day of the week.
Yeah.
Not that he's so great.
I mean, the odds box.
Yeah, but once in a while.
How dare they drag the good name of the United States of America through the mud of Saddam Hussein torture prison.
Hey, man.
You tell them now.
See, he's a smart guy.
He's got a good heart.
No, only needs his personality transplant.
He's got a nasty, bitchy wife, too, just like a tipper.
You know, we're going to censor everything.
We're going to go into music stores.
We're going to put big fat labels on everything, especially Marilyn Manson and Charles Manson and Marilyn Monroe.
Oh, there was a tipper over.
Yeah.
It's a long way to tipperary, man.
I'll tell you that.
Tipper canoe and the El Gore too, bitch.
Remember the thing there with the...
Where the hell was it?
That was the convention where it looked like he was going to do her right there on the stage.
Remember that?
The long kiss?
Uh-huh.
And I think it was kind of like the kiss that we're talking about in the Godfather.
I think I was trying to give her the big kiss off.
Maybe we're trying to tipper her over.
Oh, of course, if it gets a good wait for us, be sure and tipper.
That's what Josh was trying to do with the melting pot last night trying to tipper.
The one that flippered.
The, really?
So this was a really good experience.
I know I'm sure you went out and sloshed.
No, I did.
I went into this weekend for that.
Yeah, and that's a good idea.
Don't be going out and getting sloshed and start like Marvin Romand and showing up at about 10.45, you know?
When people can't show up on time for a gig that starts at 10 in the morning.
That's usually not a good sign.
Marvin, of course, that storage is good, buddy.
And D-fo too.
No, right.
That's speaking of clothes, speaking of engine killers.
Hey, today's Wednesday.
It's a bulletin' for you.
I bet there are a lot of you guys out there.
I haven't even thought about Mother's Day.
It was faster.
You're coming soon and you think.
It's this Sunday.
Still time to make it seem like you put a lot of thought in your gift by sending an original Vermont teddy bear.
Sending a bear gram is so much more personal and fun than flowers.
Those flowers wilt and die in just no time at all.
And Vermont teddy bears last forever.
They're even guaranteed for life.
And you can only get them one way by calling your friendly bear counselor at 1-800-829 bear or shopping online at VermontTeddybear.com.
It sounds like two ways to me.
Your mom or wife will receive a beautiful bear delivered with a free card, gourmet caramel, and a gift card in a colorful box.
The Huppie Taylor bear just for her.
Like the nurse, the teacher, the businesswoman, or gardening bear.
They'll even have a fun new bear foot and pregnant bear waiting for your for those moms to be.
Check out the all new American mom dressed in a patriotic sundress and holding an apple pie.
A big fresh apple pie, nice and warm for waiting for some cheese and ice cream on it.
And for all your mom's boys out there, be sure and send them mom's boy, maybe a little cinnamon too.
The mom's boy bear with heart-shaped moms tattoo in his arm.
And dad's that your job to get your wife a gift from the kids and the mother and cub set always feels the bill real well.
And as many cubs as needed, they'll embody your kids' names right in the outfits.
And here's a tip, send a bear to the office to arrive at a workplace on Friday.
So if you can brag about you, the work co-workers and tell them that you're a real hot shot.
It works like magic all the time.
So call 1-800-829-Bair or do your shopping online at barotetibair.com.
But don't think they'll around us Wednesday already.
Send a great deal of creative alternative flowers from other days this year call 1-800-829-Bair.
That's 1-800-829-B-E-A-R. Be sure and tell them that old Fumpir Alcole Neal told you to call.
This is Neal Rodgers. What's all this?
It's 5.16.2.8.
It's Dave!
Oh-oh!
He's Miami Town.
Yes, it's Dave.
At 5.6.0. WQ-A-R.
Back in the day when someone done us wrong, we didn't take their crap.
In Pearl Harbor, when the Japs dropped their bombs, we bombed them bad.
And now the Saudis, they hit us high.
And on our cards, our little flags wait.
At that Sony, the love and retard voice of bombers the wrong way.
We can go to the docking.
And on embarrassed to be in America, there's a really vulnerable side-cheek.
The United States of America is led by bourgeoisie sanctities, three-day madness country.
Pamela Thornton, the largest ace in the history.
I don't want to be a tax America in the USA.
What's a few thousand innocent lives?
Stop living in the past.
If you want that SUV to drive, you're gonna need more gas.
It's the greatest country in the world.
They train us to move.
And anyone who says that, obviously, is a force to be.
At that embarrassed to be in America, where we take trial of Italy,
wave of flag in what asked with our head in the sand,
that blindly follow the powers that he had bested.
And that's our surprise, our surprise.
The United States values on a 65-inch screen.
Reckos, retro, bar, everything's okay.
A brand like USA.
Bye, bye, bye!
