That fits you played yesterday.
We won.
This is not Peter King, this is Stephen King. Well, you don't dare me.
Oh God.
That was funny.
There's going to be a memorial service for Chuck Zink.
One, Monday. Let's see.
Next Monday, Monday the 16th of the Guards Memorial Park on Yamato and Military Trail in Bokeh.
I don't have the time though. Thanks to Joyce Kaufman for passing it along, but I don't know what time it is.
That's Monday.
Okay, because I've talked to Arthur Hertz from Romeco last week about maybe having one of the...
Oh my God.
Well, he was the...
I know, but it's a boy of the angel guy.
He got the memories, huh?
And he knew Chi and Chuck were old friends.
And I said, we should do something in Dave County.
And so I think they're working on the...
on the Wilson Museum as a possibility where they will add archival stuff.
So there might be something here too.
I'll be damned.
So anyway, yes.
Things are looking up, baby, for the new year.
As a Cubs fan, we've been released from the Greg Reed-Ray Jean, man, from the fear and loathing in Miami.
We got a new-ray Jean and everything is really looking good.
Before you get to that, I'm hopeful as I'm sure you are that Andre Dawson gets good news from Hall of Fame today.
Oh, yeah.
To say afternoon is when they will release the votes.
And you were a Cubs fan for a long time when Andre Dawson and...
Oh, I am Andre Dawson of the Chicago Cubs.
And this is the Neil Rogers 1-2-hour Go Cubs.
There you go.
I like that.
I like that a lot.
Yeah.
You have a Hawkely's that one of my favorites.
He was great.
He should get in.
Absolutely.
Are you kidding me?
More for the years in Montreal, but also with the Cubs.
He had a lot of big years.
He was great.
Yep.
Great arm.
Good run.
Good guy.
Satellite company has didn't like him too well.
Or what was that thing he had with his neighbor about his satellite dish?
Remember that big, flacky hand?
I don't remember that.
Flack, flack, flack jacket.
Yeah, there was some little...
There's always, you know, some pain in the ass neighbor starting to bunch of cramp.
Not where I live.
Good luck, Hawke.
No, well, you probably stay anonymous.
You stay under the radar.
Except for the little dog that people down the hall have.
Yappie.
And he starts yipping and yapping.
Yipping and yapping.
Well, there's a way to solve that.
Yeah, although there's this new dog food that was on.
Do you see that story?
That's really sad.
I had more of a dry...
You know, the dark flutty dropkick.
You're bad.
I could just see that little dog.
You know, it's the sales through the uprights.
Yeah, go ahead and buy him some...
What's this diamond pet food?
You see that the pets are dying like crazy from this.
But anyway, it's sad being the dog lover that I'm not going to...
I take no joy in seeing dogs die of wicked death.
Not the owners would have died.
We've been all right.
Yeah.
Maybe that's what you should do.
Yeah.
Probably not the little dogs fault.
Just go back to the owners.
Make them offer the camp refuse.
So speaking of that, evidently the Marlins can't make anybody an offer they can't refuse.
Because no matter where they go, they get the same response.
Oh, well, we're sure glad to meet you, but no way.
Yeah.
We're not going to give you any public money.
First it was San Antonio.
Now it was Portland, Oregon.
By the way, Portland, the mayor has been saying that right along.
Right.
But as I don't want to see Portland taking out any mortgage in our children's future,
I haven't seen any plan that allows for baseball to work here.
And in the meantime, I mean, talk about a threat to leave.
The Marlins say they'll play a dolphin stadium at least two,
but no more than five more seats.
Well, at least they're up to five now.
Yeah.
No more than five more seats.
You know, if you don't give us a stadium in 20 years, we're out of here.
Yeah.
That is, and San Francisco's were exploring all possibilities.
I never thought it would come today.
Boy.
Pretty sad.
I would say.
Especially what they got left for a ballcrumbs, pretty sad too.
Well, that's the other thing.
It's what did they got to sell?
Not much.
I say everybody jump on that Panther's bad wagon, baby.
Got a couple of girls teams come up later this week.
We got the Blues and the Columbus Street jackets.
I'm assuming those games are on the road.
It's kind of a room or team, isn't it?
That's correct.
Remember will be in town?
Well, I don't know.
It's just as the Panther's versus I'm assuming it's a road game because it doesn't really say here.
I don't know whether it's their home.
They're home against them.
They are home?
Yep.
The room will be in town to rip underneath spot-fannon ass.
That's my challenge to remember.
Say, say right to his face what you told me behind his back all those years.
Remember, bookshop a little bit about that dumb frog.
By the way, speaking of dumb people, I know you don't care about this, but two weeks from yesterday is the big Canadian national election.
Yeah.
I read about it.
The same mistake here that Americans have made all of a sudden they get disenchanted with liberals.
And the conservative is in this morning's pool, or way, way ahead.
They're going to have a majority government looks like Stephen Harper, who in the past was always considered to be a clone of Bush with his own Canadian bunch of Neocons.
And they're going to make the same mistake.
So if you love Bush, you're going to really love Stephen Harper.
What a bad mistake they're going to make here.
But they'll look through the roof of the day.
You won't move, though.
No, it's not going to affect me.
It's not going to affect me impacted my life.
I was reading where Las Vegas is going through over building.
Finally.
Yeah, you know what you think so.
Well, they're building all these condos out there and condos hotels and some of them are starting to be canceled.
Because it's a glut.
You get to a saturation pool and I don't know what that point was, but I guess they finally reached it.
Yep.
I mean, how much money is there out there?
Plenty of darts.
Well, this is residential stuff.
I bet you're not too happy about the situation in South Florida with a sloth pass.
Because anything that, you know, whether it was Atlantic City or now this,
it just keeps it in a way, tripping away.
All the time that they're missing any meals out there.
You think that that would stop anybody from going out there.
The fact that there is going to be slot machines at the tracks.
Sure.
I don't think so.
Well, I give personal example.
I mean, if I were there, if I was in South Florida most of the time and I hadn't discovered woodmine here,
it didn't spend most of my time here.
I wouldn't go to Vegas again if I could go plunge my guts there.
See, the thing with Vegas is after you've seen all the new glitzy casinos and, you know, that's it.
Once you've seen them all, what else is there to see?
Right.
Because inside when you strip away all the trappings and the paintings like in Velagio and the fountains and the water,
fishing and all that stuff, when you take that all away, it's a bunch of tables and slot machines, you know.
It could be anywhere.
It's still a destination that it's different because of shows and...
You know, the entertainment out there and...
It's a long-slept man.
It's a long-slept for a lot of people inexpensive.
The amount of money you still...
Well, still want to go away.
Yeah.
Well, a certain amount of times, but I won't see.
We'll find out.
I think there are people that go there maybe two, three times a year.
You know what?
They said the same thing about Atlantic City.
Oh, it's going to hurt Las Vegas.
Yeah, but Atlantic City's a dump.
It's a toilet.
And...
God.
Halondale.
Pompadal?
Pompadal is not a toilet.
Halondale?
Boy, you sure got to bug up your ass about Gulfstream, man.
I wasn't even thinking about that.
I'd be real careful.
I would be surprised if Rahul...
You're a good buddy there.
It shows up at...
It's a...
Halondale now.
It's at a higher level.
Rahul Martinez, your buddy.
Well, you won't see me there.
I'll be a caller.
Yeah.
It's great over there.
I agree with that.
I have no problem with callers.
Had many of them enjoy the afternoon.
They're plunging my guts out.
But...
Anyway.
No, back into my Gonzalez Jose Valerced Junior days.
You know, when they opened up Mississippi, the same thing.
It doesn't matter where they opened up.
I've never found out who Gary Cohen was, by the way.
How come I keep letting you off the hook?
Gary Cohen?
The Jackie and then Jackie agent, Gary Cohen.
Don't you remember I asked you if you...
Yeah, you did.
Was related to Gary Cohen.
Yes.
How about Marty Cohen?
Who is that?
You're supposed to ask Eddie Kay about Gary Cohen.
I can't believe that.
I forgot all about that.
Being the racing maven that you are, he wasn't a bad Jackie.
He was...
And then he became a Josh agent.
I think he got injured and became an agent.
You're supposed to be the expert on that crap.
Next you'll be asking me who Gary Bane is.
Oh, I know who Gary Bane is.
He still...
He fell to the top of the stretch, by the way.
He's somebody I put an extra.
How about Derek Acevato?
I remember him.
He went too bad.
He was alright.
He was okay.
He was...
Who's the guy that died that they had the memorial?
What the hell was that Jackie?
Don, Donald...
Donald Rumsfeld.
Donald...
Oh, what?
I know who you're talking about.
Brumfield.
Brumfield.
No.
Yes.
Brumfield.
Brumfield.
That's why I just said.
Yeah.
I thought you said Brumfeld.
Well, I said that first just to be a wise answer.
Brumfeld.
That was wishful thinking.
Yeah, Donald Brumfield.
Well, that was a long time ago.
I know.
Well, that's what happens when you get to be ancient.
But he won a Kentucky Dirty.
Next, we're going to be talking about Lowe's adustment and Sherry Pop and Pop Savage.
See, you know, there's something to be said for gay to be an old toad.
Not too much to be said for, but the one of the things is look at all the people that we outlived, you know?
And I'm not saying it was...
There were bad people like Pop Savage was always nice to me.
He was a good guy.
He was.
He's been dead a long time now.
He's so son Joey this weekend.
Yeah, good guy.
Joey works at Calder.
I thought he also works at Gulfstream.
He's not at Gulfstream right now.
No, but I used to see him at Gulfstream.
He used to work there, yeah.
But now he's a caller and he's not at Gulfstream for this meat, so.
That couldn't be Dick Stofer that I'm here and call those racists.
Could it?
Yes, it is.
Oh my god.
Well, it tells you what the horses are thinking.
No wonder I was sick to my stomach yesterday.
Well, he just...
Yeah.
Not that he's that bad, you know?
He's not great, but he's not that bad.
But just...
Personally, he's just offensive to me.
And he just bothers me.
He's an idiot.
Oh, he's certainly better at what he does than Mike Pataglia.
Mike Pataglia is a nice guy.
You keep telling me that.
I mean, there are a lot of nice guys out there, but you're not going to have him call the racists.
I ain't talking about that about Dick.
He is just awful.
Yeah, Pataglia is not the best.
He is one of the very worst.
One of the all-time worst.
But, you know, you turn on San and Need and listen to Trevor call the racists.
I enjoy him a lot.
Yeah.
I like that.
Now, he sure doesn't make any mistakes.
I'll tell you that.
But we're getting a little bit too close to the horse racing thing now,
so we've literally like chopped this off.
Okay.
It's Tuesday.
It's probably not a big racing day, I wouldn't think.
Uh, no.
Most of the tracks are dark today.
Well, I'll tell you.
I'll tell you who's open just one moment please.
All you anti-gambling people.
Oh, look at that.
We got racing from South Africa in a half an hour.
Oh.
Philadelphia, Tampa Bay, Tirith Paradise,
Kawortha Downs, Hardest, Dover Downs, Northfield Park,
Georgian Dove.
Too much harness racing for you today.
Yeah, I'm not involved today.
No.
You got Philadelphia, which is really crappy racing in Tampa Bay.
Well, I'm surprised they still track you still running over there in Tampa, aren't you?
Yeah, doing very well.
Are they really based on what?
On the slots?
I don't have.
No, they don't have slots.
I know that.
They have attendance.
They have full fields.
Well, why are they doing very well?
Is that because I'm a nice promotion job over there?
It's well managed.
I'll be damned.
Yep.
People go there from O'Cala.
They have a pretty wide base of people from different, you know, Sarasota, St. Braggington,
Gavines, they'll walk with that place.
Yeah.
No, they aren't doing well.
Temple Terrace.
Yeah, Loots.
Loots.
Yeah, I remember Loots.
Bombay.
Do you ever drive through Bombay?
Very quickly.
There is no, I'm not thinking of Bombay.
I'm thinking of two eggs.
Two eggs is a stoplight.
No, I've never seen that one.
Never seen the stoplight.
It sits the town, two eggs.
Why do you better start traveling around?
I'm driven through Barstow.
No, I've been through there.
And Brandon.
Yep.
It's where Josh is from.
Brandon.
He's not from there.
You're not from there, right?
No.
From Brandon.
Brandon, we're all here fast food joints.
Yeah.
It's like East of Tampa when you're going on 60-year-old.
I know where Brandon is.
Brandon.
They got fast food joints and have been invented yet.
Well, listen, we don't want to carry this on too much because somebody
will get very, very, very tested again and all upset and been out of shape.
We haven't even mentioned it.
Yeah, you did.
Right out of the box, you mentioned after the promo, you had some cost to conace.
Oh, I just saw it.
I just enjoyed the bit.
Means, spirit, and hateful comment.
That's correct.
Where do you guys go wrong?
You know, what's that all about?
I guess we'll explore that tomorrow.
I'll be listening.
Yeah, okay.
Have a good day.
Have a great day.
Get that South Africa Racing Form now.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm about to.
Yeah.
That's something to do.
This is G Gordon Liddy and they don't come any worse than Neil Rogers.
Welcome.
Swin so many years.
We're going around a second with a star doing something we have.
The church is getting back in there by itself.
And sure, it's better now that you're on the show.
A richer, a keel.
And road into me.
Keep it away from my picture.
I'm a richer.
Would your love like this doll be snowy to suffer?
Just head down to the pet shop or not.
I love a lover.
Come on and do the richer keel.
Richer keel.
Richer keel.
Richer keel.
Richer keel.
Richer keel.
Richer keel.
Richer keel.
Richer keel.
tem 13th reason I'm playing that is I saw an amazing movie last night.
I really, very good with Richard Gear and I watched it.
I think a lot of times when most of us make a mistake,
If somebody we can't stand is in a movie we just refuse to watch it and like sometimes we miss a really good movie
All right or sometimes we avoid

I don't think there is any number.
Boy, at least 227 US service members have died since the war started in 2003.

You know.
You come up with skirt.
with all those opening statements in the wrong
pontificator or a pontiff.
What's the purpose of that?
All he did is waste a day.
That's all.
Just one more day that the media doesn't have to talk
about what's really going on in the world.
Somebody QAM, hello?
Neil, if there's a movie you're talking about,
is that a movie with Rich Gears, a lawyer?
Yes.
And there's something about that.
Edward Norton being crazy or something,
our multiple personality?
Right, exactly.
That's the one.
That was a great movie.
It was.
Yeah, you're right about the ending.
If you let the ending happen.
Don't go into the same thing, man.
These people will come to your house
and beat the crampody.
Good movie, though, man.
Great take.
All right.
See you later.
See, there's somebody that saw Primal Fear.
See, one thing about, I've called me crazy, OK?
You're crazy.
Go ahead.
Yeah, I know.
But so many times we talk about these different movies.
And like, almost nobody has ever seen any of them.
That is correct.
Well, what's that all about?
I guess these people look at it on the house much,
is that it?
Or are there lousy excuses for shut-ins
because they don't have cable?
I see.
Now, what's your excuse?
How come you didn't see it?
I think I did see it.
I suppose about that.
Well, if you'd have seen it, they
would say, I think I see.
Now, this is what I was hoping for.
It's not an idea.
You forget all.
It's a little bit too profound, a little bit
to the ending, a little bit.
And since you're such a stickler on good endings, man.
Right.
This one would have like top-right the movie in mind.
Maybe I avoided it because of the Richard Richard.
Richard here.
And entirely fine.
Francis McDormand was in it.
She cancels it out.
Who more than that exactly?
She's great.
W-Q-Y-M, hello.
Hey, good morning, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
That was the first movie I ever saw Ed Norton in.
And I like him ever since.
I think he's a George Tony to watch the movie, American History
X.
And if you watch it, you'd never know it was the same guy.
I'll be named.
You would not know it's Ed Norton.
I didn't know it was him.
Exactly.
And Neil, I wanted to thank you for one of your sponsors,
lawyers, office, Hoffman, Leonard Agnetti.
I did a little work for me during the last year
and very professional, saving me a little money.
And I really appreciate it.
Excellent.
I don't know why you're this pal.
I don't know what's the matter with yourself, departments.
And they need to boot them on, out and bring some people.
And if they can't sell your show,
they're not with their crap.
Amen.
Thanks a lot, pal.
All right, bye.
Well, I think we got some changes coming in.
We got a great new general manager,
which everybody's just raving about Joe Bell.
And there's some, like I said, some of the charity key.
I mean, some of the people have been hanging on me.
I mean, like I said, I think it was right
to first time charity cases.
See, it's one thing to, it's like pain, you know, you get used to it.
And then, but then when the pain finally goes away,
then you think, oh my gosh, what a relief this is.
I didn't realize how annoying that was all that time.
And that was the great read era, you know, the era of paranoia
and fear and loathing.
And see, it's one thing to say, well, I'm a hands-off guy.
Well, that's one thing.
It's another thing to say.
I'm just oblivious.
And I'm in my own world.
I got my own agenda and whatever, you know,
we've got a pleasant time, believe you me.
And even though, of course, he is remaining as our consultant.
Oh, what a joke that is.
Somebody Q.A.M. Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Chugs Inc. died?
Yeah.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Yeah, he is Christ, him too.
Somebody Q.A.M. Hello.
Neil, how are you?
Yes.
All right.
All right.
Listen, how many years did it take for the Soviets
to get out of Afghanistan?
About 30, man.
Yeah.
So that's how many of these things were
going to be in Iraq?
Hey, no, no, no, no, no.
It's for a linear energy word about that.
OK.
I mean, this is a bunch of innocent people dying over there.
Don't get all whipped up about that.
It's just nobody else seems to care.
The politicians don't care.
And the animals don't care.
Nobody cares, including a lot of these parents who
think that it's really wonderful to send their kids over
to be human sacrifice.
For your father, for your father, because that's all they are.
Dying for no good reason at all.
We're in a cragmyer.
They're desperately trying to figure out
some way to get out of there.
And Donnie Hermann Gehring-Romancefeld told us just a couple
of weeks ago, we're going to withdraw 7,500 troops
this year, maybe 7,500 out of 138,000.
That's not exactly what you call a whole bunch.
Bargain.
Right.
And of course, that was before all this new violence
and mayhem and bloodshed started up again, which
every day now, you got double digit dead people.
Can you imagine?
I mean, you know, we had the 3,911, but that was basically
it.
But can you imagine if every single day in America,
we had double digit people dying from terrorist attacks
or from bombings.
And they had that bomb scare, which I'll get to it eventually.
It's in San Francisco yesterday at Starbucks.
Did you see that story?
No.
No, really.
Well, you better hear with it, Mr.
you better start checking out your Starbucks.
But that was just a hoax.
And they put a beat, but it opened everybody's all up
and arms and it was a major story.
If we had like double digit people dying every day,
there would be people would be like riding in the streets
like how come you're not stopping this?
What's going on over here?
And then of course, I guess the bush response to that
would be well better to keep it over there than over here,
you know, better than the Nush.
Of course, us, I think would include those 2,207 dead
Americans, but nevertheless, don't start again
with that anti-American propaganda.
You Canadian bastard you.
Well, the sun is shining.
It's beautiful, baby.
We got like Indian fall coming this way.
I don't know what's going on.
It couldn't be that global warming, could it?
Couldn't be like in the 30s, 30s,
in the 40s, the next three days.
Are they important?
There's such thing.
Remember, that's a liberal problem.
And Buffalo in the 50s, the next couple of days.
How do you like that, huh?
Well, if you ever wanted to go to Buffalo, I don't do it.

He'll make damn sure you get exactly what you're looking for.
The pros of brandy's understand fit and comfort.
They even specialize in wide wits as well
because some of you folks have got big fat ones

This is Neil Rogers.
This is 5.62 AF.
5 with a WRD.
5 with a WRD.
I can't stop this inside the house.
3, fucking enough, I can't stop.
5, 47 George's a ghost seed and Josh's a second animation.
Sure, I wouldn't rather watch primal fear
though before I'd watch them.
Miguel didn't really really ending for it.
No, he was talking about a different movie.
He had it wrong.
I see, good, I have to see it again since I forgot.
Well, I'm thinking that maybe I should go get you a copy of that.
It's 12 worth seeing.
The rest of us, Francis McDorman, in it.
I did the AC subs people have your movie during their Joshua?
Yeah, I'm going to be getting back knowing it tonight.
Tonight.
Today, and I'll watch it tonight.
Maybe.
I'm going to say, my how long is that food going to take to get here?
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.
I'm flying crap about the DVD.
You just want the food.
And later, City Stubbs is bringing food today.
Yes, they are.
Well, isn't just amazing.
Now, everybody seems to be in so much better of a mood now
and everything they're the sun or she even shining here as a result.
You can take them from under this dark cloud at QAM.
We didn't even realize, I guess you could, like I said,
you get used to it like pain.
And how the dark cloud has been listed.
And we can see some daylight at the end of the channel.
And in May to escape from here, I guess you also seen some daylight?
And in May to escape from the Dade County Stockade this morning,
a facility next to the Turner-Gillford Night Detention Center
that renaul the Rapala Escape from in December.
Dade Department of Corrections said they escaped and made this 25-year-old black man
about 5'9 and 160 pounds.
He was last seen in the area of Southeast Eighth Court and Park Drive in Miami Springs.
Corrections officers said they had made somehow
go out of the holding area behind the main jail building this morning.
It's unknown how the man escaped from the earth,
which is surrounded by barbed wire.
How do you like that?
Maybe he had gloves on.
Officials haven't said what the man is charged with.
The stockade is an older facility next to TGK
where accused of a rapist-reportal escape of December 20th.
We'll go out there and catch him.
We can't hold on, I guess.
Upon his return from an extended vacation yesterday,
the WOR New York Post made it official.
Bob Grant plans to retire on Friday.
After 58 years behind the mic, how do you like that?
Oh my God.
Bob Grant, old racist, the stator, cram, I said.
Heightful, hate-mongering, right-wing piece of turd, Bob Grant.
Following the announcement on his afternoon,
show Grant took calls from listeners, local celebrities,
and politicians offering good wishes to the radio veteran,
to the radio Nazi, and reminisced on his incredible broadcast career,
which also includes a stint in afternoons in WABC in New York,
where he got fired, by the way.
In the almost 60 years he's been on the air,
Bob has gained the allegiance and affection of millions of listeners,
WOR vice president General Mangler Bob Bruno said.
Bob is not only a great broadcaster,
but he's a great American and a great friend and a great racist.
The legendary Bob Grant will always enjoy the utmost respect
and sincere gratitude of WOR and Buckley Broadcasting for a job well done.
He likes it well done.
I like it kind of medium well myself.
So, bye-bye, Bob Grant, and don't let the door hitch you an ass on a way out.
I put him in the same category as Greg Reed leaving,
although at least the Bob Grant doesn't affect us.
5670560, I guess maybe we'll change the poll to 11 o'clock
to the one that Eric Scott tomorrow is, right?
Okay.
I actually have a really, really good one for Thursday.
Not that the one isn't good for tomorrow, but I really, you know what I mean?
By really good.
No, I know what you mean.
In fact, I might just change it over right now.
Really?
Well, not to the really good one.
Here's the last check of this one.
1667 votes.
What's your number one answer to?
Most people are stupid, 508.
Decent 3208.
That's awfully nice.
8 holes, 259.
Pipercrets 233.
One dimensional 114.
177.
Reasonable 72.
Rude 56.
Rude 56.
How do you like the way that turned out?
It's amazing.
That's our station.
They're going to have a big billboard campaign.
Rude 56.
We can even get some jingles, some palm jingles.
Bye, bye, bye.
Our lifeless 31, Bigots 19, Jerk 17,
pervert 16, ugly, only 12.
Okay, let me just change it right now.
I'm sure we can put a lot of things on this one.
What do you miss most about your childhood?
Do we ever do that before?
No, we haven't.
Wow, where do we start?
Okay, here's what I got so far.
Well, some of these wouldn't be up your alley.
Like baseball cards, I've put that.
You know one of the great things about buying baseball cards?
I can get them.
Yeah.
That dry stick.
It would go dry.
That's great.
Not a dry flat piece of gum that was powered by baseball cards.
It would really powder me and really sickeningly sweet.
And if you like down a bout like 10 packs of baseball cards,
which I think it used to be like five cents or a dime a pack.
So for a dollar, you could buy 10 packs.
You had it too, it was just a obligatory.
If I'll obligate, you shouldn't want to throw it out.
That'd be wasteful.
So you had it too air-vee stick a gum.
You know, and just, of course you could feel the fillings getting yanked right out of your mouth.
They only lost their flavor after like five seconds.
Baseball cards, Hollywood turquoise and treetin, Halloween,
that say Hollywood, Hollywood, Halloween,
playing sports, free speech.
Oh, I remember that.
Comic books, bubble gum, which not necessarily baseball card bubble gum,
but just bubble gum in general.
And then when you get to being adult, you're supposed to be too smart to be chewing bubble gum, right?
Right.
Spankings, some, I think some people enjoyed it.
Going to school instead of work.
See, I remember when I was in school, and I think most people like this,
when you're in school, you look forward to that day when you're in a row long run school,
you don't have to get up in the morning and go to school every day.
And then you realize you're getting the real world,
and then you gotta go to work every day.
And you think, boy, I sure wish I was back in school, you know?
At least some people.
And my old neighborhood, you miss the old hood?
Sometimes, actually, I miss my teen hood more than my childhood hood.
I'm potent for baseball cards.
Boy, I sure enjoy that.
And then you'd flip them you know with your friends, right?
I remember when I lost Dutch Leonard.
Oh my God, I don't think I'll ever recover from that day.
Big fat old picture for I believe the Cubs, I'm not sure I'll have 100 years ago.
I lost my Dutch Leonard card.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Don't you think it's like a Zinn, you know, the things you miss from your childhood?
Yeah, sure, we're gonna do that.
You have out having no worries.
Yeah, for being free.
Not having to pay bills.
Ooh, how's that?
I like that.
Yeah, my life's basically what you guys are saying.
Just paraphrasing it so much better, which is weird.
That's right.
Speciality, huh?
Just like freedom in general.
Really?
Most things that are a problem now are other people's problems.
Well, do we want to put both of those things on it?
Not having to pay bills.
Okay.
I like having no worries because you know, you have no worries.
Not around people on hand.
You have to be no worries.
They can own separate categories.
One can be part of the other one.
I mean, let's not limit this, okay?
We can put about a thousand choices on there now.
Just because the food hasn't showed up yet, don't start getting a little surly on me.
Well, I'll get a little lightheaded, you know.
Yeah.
That's what Greg always said.
By the way, time of fear is the movie that Miguel thought that we were talking about.
Oh, thank God he didn't spoil the ending of this movie before because if he spoil the ending,
it's forget about it.
But he says that it is also good and involves the church.
This is two hours and 15 minutes long.
So it's a fairly long movie and it didn't end to like a quarter to one in the morning.
So if I'm lightheaded, that's because I went a bit a little late for this whole movie.
It's worth seeing.
I'm telling you, it's pretty good.
And Ed Norton is really great.
Company QAM, hello.
Yeah, I got some for Neil Paul.
Yes, sir.
I want to tell him that Saturday morning cartoons.
Actually, I'm going to vote for that.
Thanks, Pally.
Bye bye.
You know, they have a really good theater and Rochester man.
I think he was talking about the TV cartoons, but those work too.
No, he was nice.
Saturday morning cartoons.
No, sorry, pops, but some of them remember them from the end.
Yeah, he's not old enough.
He's right.
Saturday morning cartoons.
I still have Saturday morning cartoons on TV.
Almost done.
Like one channel just like that.
And they're not even.
See, Saturday is religiously when I was a kid.
We'd go out of a friend and I would go to the cameo theater in Rochester.
And like, I think it was a dime to get in.
I remember it may be more, maybe a quarter.
And back in those days, when you went to the movies, there were two features.
And it was start out with a cartoon and the news reel.
And then there was the first feature.
And then there was like in between, it was like a cartoon or the cereal.
I don't remember the order.
And then there was a second movie.
You get two movies, the news reel, a cereal in a kind of, at least one, maybe two cartoons
for like a quarter.
News reel.
Yeah, for real.
For real.
Israel was real.
For real.
News reel.
You know what I'm talking about where they had it.
You've seen those pathane news and, uh, old people like that.
All the people who are present.
Right.
That's right.
President Truman today dropped in a Bama Grande on his damn jabs and stuff like that.
Well, it was with the days, man.
I always fantastic.
The big old cameo.
I don't remember where the hell it is.
I was.
I'm sure it's not there.
No more.
Somebody cue I am.
Hello.
Well, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I had a comment regarding Keith Overman.
Yes.
The only thing he's qualified to report is Boston 100 Detroit 96.
Yeah.
And why is that?
Is he too liberal for his edit?
No, I'm just kidding.
How about that Rita Cosby?
I don't get it.
She is so bad that, you know, sometimes there's some people hate him, some people love him.
Who can like her?
All right.
That's a good question.
Who would turn that thing on and take it seriously?
You'd have to think it was a prank.
A practical joke.
I mean, a voice alone.
I've run to the TV.
Well, she has it.
I can't complain about her voice.
She has it.
I have one.
Maybe she got slipped as a child, you think?
Oh, man.
Oh, oh.
Oh, no.
All right, I'll kid yourself.
I think she's got the responsibility.
No, no.
I'm just going to take a moment.
How about you think it, either?
Neil Rogers.
This is 5.16.2.8.
This has been Neil Rogers, shout.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
This is your brain.
Who's the 30-go?
Any question?
Yes.
Who would have a match?
I need to light my shoelace.
I don't know.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
When there's a bomb in my shoe, and the melody in my heart,
I get that you can't keep it in even, when I grow the flame apart,
you show the full that my face makes me feel so too high.
Neil Rogers worked to take aim, for my village is a prison wife,
with a bomb on my feet.
I put a wet spot on for a seat.
I'm a fool, find that I'm an outsider.
I'm a fool.
When there's a bomb in my shoe, and the night, night, night, night,
what a wonderful way to die this way.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
I'm a fool.
I'm a fool.
I'm a fool.
The thing about life.
I've got scat, uh-oh.
I've got an outsider.
I've got a really bad energy, but I won't lose your time.
Love it.
Love it.
Love it.
Love it.
Love it.
Seeing no help for coming from the sheriff, she turns to the only other person who can help
her, Jack Barone.
Marone.
A breathing father whose daughter, Lisa, was the victim of a similar sline ten years earlier.
The killer's clues are a perversion of biblical punishments for sins, stoning, burning decapitation.
Jack and Agent Hammer turned to father Patrick, a Catholic priest for help, as the clock takes
down a young female friend of Jack's kidnap and maybe come back scarcely.
The herring rescue of the young woman opens her door to dark history, ridden below the
surface, repeatedly a true identity of the killer ranch in the mystery of who killed
Jack's daughter.
And also George says American history acts as great with Ed Norton.
Right.
Now Ed Norton can act, he doesn't always do that in movies, but in this movie, like
best job ever.
Now he's sure acted in Primal Fear, I'll tell you that.
Cool.
Let's see, here's one in Phelzmeer, Phelzmeer, Florida.
I never knew there was a place called Phelzmeer, Florida.
It says, I agree with the caller for the new poll.
I miss the good Saturday morning cartoons.
The cheesy, badly drawn cartoons now really suck.
And all of them are in existence.
I think like one channel shows Yugi-O and some other cheesy crap.
Well, Josh was right, having no worries, although I noticed he didn't put no bills to
pay, which I think is a separate, it's part of that one, but I'll put it on him.
Well, I got civil for you to put on there.
No bills to pay.
Okay, he's in position.
Oh, don't tell Duff.
My allowance.
Well, you're laughing, but there's some nowadays.
Yeah, okay.
Some people got an allowance, that's why it's funny.
Oh, I see.
Well, some kids got one.
I've never forgot one or not.
I don't know.
I got something.
Diddling my classmates.
All right.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing.
Well, here you go.
Nothing at all.
I'll guarantee you, most of these people had a lot more action when they were in school
and they're getting now.
They're so married.
What do you miss most about your childhood?
Having no worries, 21.
Playing sports, 12.
My old neighborhood ate.
Oh, boy.
There are no white people in my old neighborhood.
Can you believe that?
And that was years ago.
So I'm sure.
I don't think there's even any black people anymore.
I'm not sure who does that leave left.
There's still our in light neighborhood because it was the Redlands.
Freedom, five.
Oh, remember those days when we all felt so free.
Kind of like we feel now at QAM.
Like we've had a gigantic anchor taken off our ass.
Oh, God.
Can't you all feel it?
I'm feeling something.
No, I'm serious.
Sometimes I can hear music.
What is that?
My sweet Lord?
Close.
What's that?
You'll catch up here in a second.
Oh, happy day.
Oh, everyone has concerns.
Right.
Oh, happy day.
Well, then a real pleasure, Greg.
You believe me?
Anyway, having the Worry 25 playing sports 12-mile neighborhood, 10 freedom, six going to
schools that are work five, free speech five, which is not only a fantasy, a distant
memory, Halloween, frickin' treatin' four, baseball cards for bubble gum two, comic books
two, Saturday morning cartoons one, spankings one.
I told you.
What did I tell you?
There's people out there probably enjoyed little spanking and maybe you're still doing
a little of that to each other.
Dibbling my classmates, my allowance, no bills to pay.
They just went on there for 77 votes.
This is one of the best polls.
Thanks again, Sean.
I don't want to take credit for Sean came up with this.
Our poll man.
He is.
He is the poll man.
He is the poll expert man.
Make no mistake about it.
Even though I'm not going to have lunch with him.
Also here's another one somebody's fact.
In Pedro, Pedro is getting a little chronic on a facts machine.
That's okay.
Pedro is okay in our book.
He says, believing in Sandy Claus.
How about putting that on there?
Okay.
Evening in Santa Claus.
And what about believing in God?
If you wish.
Huh?
I don't see what's good about either one of those two things.
If you wish upon a star.
Well, I always found believe in Sandy Claus for those who did wink wink at night.
You know, I mean, how stupid could you be?
Did you?
No, of course not.
We didn't have a chimney.
How did he come down to chimney when we didn't have one?
I don't know.
I never thought that crap.
Keep running around up there under roof.
You know, looking for the hole to jump down.
He couldn't find it.
You want both of those on there?
What's that?
Sandy Claus and God.
Or aren't they the same?
I think there's a great similarity there.
I mean, I realized it's a little extra work for you, Mr. Hyde.
I didn't see how that thing could be.
That's pretty miserable childhood.
That's your favorite part.
When you were believing in Sandy Claus.
I did have a miserable childhood, but I never believed in Sandy Claus.
I was, I didn't want that Santa miserable childhood.
I was thinking about you.
I'm saying.
It's functional.
Well, I can only speak from my own perspective, man.
I mean, I'm sure you never believed in Sandy Claus, but then again, you were raised in the Catholic church.
Were they knew how to alter boys?
That's kind of strange because Ed Norton plays a 19-year-old altar boy in this movie, which is a little bit old,
but the father took him off the street.
Oh, you just got a TV movie.
You just got to see it.
I can't wait.
I might go on after my conversation with our general manager.
They might go online and just jump to the generosity of my heart.
Right, send it to you.
Very good.
Where do I get an Amazon.com?
Yes.
I might just do that.
All right.
No, I think you'll enjoy it.
And it's one of those movies you'd like to have a pristine DVD copy of it as opposed to some
watching a cheesy cable version.
It's good.
Cheesy cable.
WDQ.
Hey, Neil.
Yes.
Good morning.
How about running under the old Johnny Pomp and the summertime?
The cool yourself off.
The old Johnny Pomp?
Yeah, the old Pomp.
What the old Johnny Pomp?
Never heard of that before.
I never heard that.
Yeah.
The old Johnny Pomp.
Anybody out there ever see Johnny Pomp?
Oh, God.
No comment.
What is that?
Pomp, pump, pump.
Oh, I...
I wonder what Hood He grew up in.
Maybe he's the guy from Tuwag.
I was talking to Hank about him.
Oh, man.
But we do know what he's talking about, though.
We do?
How about...
Yeah.
When you run around under the pump to get to cool yourself off on a hot summer day, of course.
You mean the fire hydrant?
No, not a fire hydrant.
It was like...
I know what he means.
What like a...
Well, like a hand pump, like a well-like on the farm?
Yeah, like that.
Like that.
Kind of like that.
You kind of like that.
The old Johnny Pomp.
You've seen it.
I've seen it.
You've seen movie Pomp.
And then I'll be glad to just had a real good one.
And then you keep rambling on with this crap.
And it made me...
Oh, what about...
I don't know.
What about the school playground?
Okay.
No, you don't miss the playground?
I do.
Well, there you go.
I've got recess.
Yeah.
Okay, there's another one.
Recess the school playground.
Well, yeah.
Recess lost the playground.
Isn't that the kind of thing?
No!
No!
You're going to go to playground during recess?
Of course you did.
What do you mean?
Of course.
We did?
Yeah.
Well, you've got...
You forget it.
It's 100 years since I went to school with Elorwano about recent.
There we go.
On computer, we used study hall.
We used study hall.
We used study hall.
I'm getting confused between recess and study hall.
Didn't you ever have a study hall class?
Yes.
But that was like in high school.
Right.
In high school, you had study hall.
You'd sit around, you'd stare at all the interesting people you liked.
You didn't do any work here.
You were pretending to be doing your homework.
But you were sitting around eyeing everybody else.
I would...
That.
Boy.
I sure eyed a lot of people in my high school.
I'll tell you that.
5670560, but very carefully, though.
That's right.
Very discreetly.
I don't want to tell that story about Jim Park naked in the locker room.
Do I?
Not again.
Go ahead, kill the guitar.
Oh no.
70QIM, hello.
QIM.
Hey, Neil.
How are you, sir?
Pretty good.
I wouldn't say the Saturday morning cartoons.
I used to love it.
I'm sure you remember those guy, M.P. Draves, were these scary movies?
Sure.
Yeah.
How about small, down friendly people?
Okay.
I was about to raise my hand.
Wouldn't that be under the category of my old neighborhood?
Yeah, I guess it would be.
You guys celebrate day and day.
And you too.
I don't think that's something like that.
I actually would be saying that not everybody grew up in a small town.
And maybe some people grew up in a nice neighborhood.
Oh, you know something in this movie that I'm trying to pedal to you?
Yeah.
Ed Norton, he played in the character he plays like a cross between Billy, Bavavivid, and Rainman.
Oh really?
He's got the...
Tisms?
Yeah.
I'm so tempted.
I'm going to ruin the movie for you.
Let's not talk about it anymore.
I'm just going to get it for you.
And then you want...
I'm telling you, I know you're like it.
I guarantee you.
You know, if this movie I'd be shocked.
All right.
And especially the ending.
Don't assume you know the ending until you get to the very end.
You're going to go, your jaw will drop your...
That's toast.
Of course, in your case, it's not a long drive.
It's probably the time for you're loving it at 5.60 W.Q.A.M.

There's a good argument when you do the God Squad.
If there was a God, how could the gas smell like that?
It's supposed to.
It's supposed to?
Yeah. So you know what to get away from it.
Oh, I see.
Thank you.

We got the molemyster with 2 o'clock to save.
Noone's sick around for a bad.
Here's a facet from Eric that says, who says,
Fire hydrants were called Johnny pumps.
Because in the old days of volunteer fire companies,
they'd fight over where the hydrant to see
would get to put out the fire.
They'd fight over it.
The rookie or the Johnny would be left at the hydrant.
He'd have to hook up the hose.
Tube!
While the hose wagon proceeded to the fire.
Many of the fight ensued between Johnny's
if those hydrants thused the term Johnny pump.
I see.
And here I thought they were talking about
when they were kind of like sprinkling.
Like those things you have at the beach, you know?
Okay.
You know what I'm talking about?
Like the public showers, the fires.
You guys look like that.
But only more cruder versions of them.
But anyway, the old Johnny pumps.
See, we learned something already.
And who said this is a highly educational show?
I see.
It feels so enlightening.
And what did I tell you about no bills to pay?
You just had it on there for like five seconds.
It's already got 13 votes.
Uh-huh.
Having no worries, 45.
My old neighborhood, 17.
I don't miss that.
No.
Now, okay, Terrace and Rochester.
Man, what a crappy neighborhood.
It was okay.
It was only a few blocks from my elementary school.
Your Watson.
Number eight school in Rochester.
And from Louis' cartoon plays.
I got a comic book place.
I guess those were newsstands in those days.
I was right.
I missed the good old passion newsstands.
Right.
We'd get your comic books and your newspapers and your bubblegum
and your guards, candy bars and your cigar.
Right.
Something like that.
We got a lot of those here.
And the Europeans didn't see a lot of those.
But not so much in America no more.
What was your favorite swiss or sweets?
As a child?
Well, you're bad.
You just brutal.
I am.
Relentless.
Just a relentless spick.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8.
All the way, you'd be honest with me.
I do like swiss or sweets.
You're okay with that.
How about I can't smoke them stories no more?
Yeah, me too.
Because I want to stay alive.
Me too.
See, am I more daring younger days?
I used to really enjoy those.
But now that I realize that it's not worth it.
I'd rather have like a big bowl of spaghetti.
Spaghetti bowl of macey, you know?
That would be a golden sauce.
That would be a big bowl of a tumor?
Yeah, no, I'm serious.
If I was going to croak from doing something from a bad habit,
I'd rather do it with something I enjoy like that.
As opposed to like smoking.
I mean, smoking in ice-dovey is enjoyable.
But not in the same category with really great food.
Would you agree?
I would.
Unless, of course, it's like one of those,
boy, that's bad.
Unless I'm missing something.
Didn't that fat dial fast?
The whole big cigar thing?
Yeah.
I felt it.
Remember all those steak houses that have the cigar rooms?
Remember that when we hit a friend,
and Broward, it went out of business, and all that other crap?
What we had been to a resultant in his life that time?
Yes, we did.
How did I ever think that he was good looking?
Man, what was wrong with me then?
How come it's mean to slap me up this out of the head?
Can you try?
He looked like Frankenstein.
I know.
I know.
I don't get it, but I'll take the word.
Well, look at what he was competing with in the past.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
You know.
Call me what are you laughing about?
You don't know what I'm talking about.
Mister football.
You don't even know what that means.
What I work in this building, don't I?
Oh, I see.
Takes it to the house.
And I'm sure Justin since it's a wonderful expression.
I mean, I will admit that I use it in different ways.
It's just this Lordy.
I'm kidding.
In a football game?
No, no, I actually used the word.
Well, that's what I'm talking about.
He takes it to the house.
Oh, and then of course that's right in line with nobody comes into our house and pushes us
Oh, please, you know, our home team is getting like a giant today.
You're getting better like 28th and nothing or whatever.
Nobody comes into our house and pushes us around.
Well, maybe on second thought.
Oops, it's kind of like that walk-off home run with you.
Yeah, takes it to the house.
My ass.
Or the head of the house.
That you would recuse yourself.
You're testimony now is that those that made a comment upon your ethical behavior new as a matter of fact that you had pledged to this committee that you would recuse yourself from the Vanguard cases.
Professor Hazard, I know, addressed that directly in his letter.
I think Professor Rotunda addressed it in his letter.
So obviously if the letters address the issue.
Professor O'Reilly, I thought it was said on the Senate questionnaire.
And the final answer we'll move on is that you saw the name band guard on the briefs.
And you're like that.
He has named Vanguard on his briefs.
What does that tell you about this new gay Supreme Court justice?
Well, listen, a Florida can have a gay governor.
Won't that be something?
We got Mark Foley and Palm Beach.
We got a gay congressman and we got the Charlie Christ for Christ's.
I want to be the governor.
He's going to be our first gay that we know of.
You know somebody I always liked a lot.
I give up.
You know, I don't know why because his most famous songs started out down the way where the nights are.
Yeah.
What song was that?
You make a farewell?
By whom?
Harry Belafonte.
Oh, Harry.
Well, it's more famous.
I was banana both.
So I'm course.
But Jamaica farewell started out down the way where the nights are.
Yeah.
Jamaica, man.
The Americans, cigarettes activists, Terry Belafonte called President Bush, the greatest terrorist
in the world yesterday and said millions are on Sunday and said millions of Americans
support the socialist revolution of the wayland leader, Hugo Chavez.
I bet you pay Robertson a two-key about that.
I bet you he probably bust up all his old Harry Belafonte records on RCA.
What's that that we got on a banana boat day or is that called day?
We have one about dough.
Hey, dough.
Is that it?
Hey, dough.
Is that like Tato?
No, we don't got one called Hey, dough.
You're getting crazy.
Well, no, that's the chorus, but I forget the name of it.
It'll go.
Give me a second.
There's do the German.
The heavens gave banana boats on.
Well, how do I ever have ever found that?
I bet.
We are from the other states.
It's not it.
But the heavens gave time.
When you look at the fours right under it.
Oh, I see.
Like I said, this is probably the one.
Hey, dough.
Hey, dough.
Well, we sure got a lot of crap.
Yeah, we did.
Let's go get more.
Let's go get more.
Chocolate boarding, but the fields.
And I come and ask me what's going on.
Suicide mom.
It can kill.
I like coming and me want to go.
Hey, Mr. Cornert, tell you a device.
I like coming and me want to go.
Well, I sure missed that.
Now, that wasn't from my childhood, but seven years ago, Jim Jones and all the cultists
who are drinking the poison coolate.
All of those great things, you know.
You saw that movie, right?
Which was very good.
What were we?
The one with powers, booth about the whole Jim Jones slide.
I did not see that.
Really?
Was Shirley boothing it, too?
I don't know, but it was, you know, historically accurate and just good.
Very good.
I'll be there.
Get back to old scary Harry Belafonte who we love his daughter deeply and dearly.
I know.
You more than me.
Belafonte led a delegation of Americans including actor Danny Glover and the Princeton University
scholar Cornel West that met the Venetian president for more than six hours late Saturday.
Some in the group attended Chavez's TV and radio broadcast on Sunday.
No matter what the greatest parent in the world, the greatest terrorist in the world's
George W. Bushes were here to tell you not hundreds, not thousands, but millions of
American people support your revolution.
Belafonte told Chavez during the broadcast except of course in South Florida because he's
too closely aligned with the unmeasullably unspeakable one, the bearded bastard.
The 78-year-old Belafonte famous for his clips on inspired music, day-o, including the
day-o song by the way.
There's a close collaboration with Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. in his now goodwill
ambassadors.
He's also been outspoken and criticized in the US embargo of Cuba.
Chavez said he believes deeply in this struggle for justice by blacks both in the US and
Venezuela, although we may not believe that there continues to be great discrimination here
against black people.
Chavez said urging his government to re-double its efforts to prevent discrimination.
Belafonte accused US news media of falsely painting Chavez as a dictator when in fact he said
there was democracy and citizens are optimistic about their future.
Dolores Querta, a pioneer of the United Farm Workers' Liberation Union also in the delegation
called a visit a very deep experience.
She didn't say how deep is your love.
Chavez accused Bush of trying to overthrow him pointed to intelligence documents released
by the US indicating that the CIA knew beforehand that this in an office in his plan a short
of 2002 coup, the US denies involvement for Chavez's Venezuelan must be on guard.
We stand on guard for the UNESCO World.
They better stand on guard for Canada with Stephen Harper coming and boys going to be really
there going to be sorry but I guess everybody wants to take a shot.
Take their little dabble in the far right.
Belafonte suggested setting up a youth exchange for Venice the waylands and Americans.
He finished by shouting in esponial.
Viva la revolution.
How do you like that?
Why didn't my Spanish really good?
Come on, it's something as simple as that.
I can handle nicely.
You will absolutely love.
I'm going to get you that movie today for sure.
Great.
Christine E. Bauer doesn't have a big part but when he speaks, when he does the punk Spanish stuff,
it's just, I'm telling you, you'll really appreciate it.
Well, he's the real deal.
I can scarface.
He actually, he's a good actor.
He is a good actor.
He's a good actor.
Oh, well, you'll see how ugly he is in this movie.
This was 96.
What year could it have been that I met him at the hockey game in the old Miami arena?
I had never met this man in my life before but because I was such a big fan of K-Pasa,
you was saying Rocky, and he was about to get out of here, which was him.
That'd be like 10 years ago.
He can't nod.
What?
The movie is 9 years ago.
No, it's more than that.
Are you crazy?
Well, I'm just a lowball.
Well, in any way, well, it made me have a lot of makeup in this movie because you looked about 100 years old.
But he came up and gave me a bear hug like I was his long lost best friend.
I thought to myself, holy moly, how come we didn't meet sooner?

This is 5-60 Q-A-WakSol.
Hang this up, baby.
Tonight on CNN ABC, MSNBC, UPN, Hacks, CNBC, Shabie Edge, NBC, Noggin, and the Fox cartoon channel.
It's hyper sniper media.
A nightline said, drop a interview, Steve, from Dell.
So you think media hype is encouraging the sniper?
Then on Larry Geng, joining me tonight is Mr. Moose.
I thought Bullwinkle was the chief moose.
And then this bit Mr. Chief Moose has away from our discitivation.
Even you be the sniper, please be the number where you'll get the reek of hell.
This is the sniper.
Thanks for all the best.
My film above is by my five.
Total.
The responsible journalism continues when your local action news puts a reporter snacking the middle of all the action.
Have you seen this neighborhood?
We'll thank for that report.
We'll keep our viewers.
I saw that a couple of nights ago on A&E or one of those.
What's that sniper or the sniper story?
What about these?
The DC sniper game.
That's the most famous one that punk and his step-dan or his sugar daddy, whatever that was on there.
Anyway, chicken neck, when you see him tell him thank you so much for this book.
I never thought I would even pick up the book.
But on the plane trips I read it, I'm still not sure with it.
Welcome, foolish mortals, the life and voices of Paul Freeze.
Okay.
Now you know who the hell that is, do you?
Sounds familiar, who is it?
Any of you there is anybody else.
He was, did all these voices for cartoons.
He was Boris Badenoff on Rocky and Volmiko.
Oh.
And the Zillions and Zillions of Voices.
And he was on Luxu Radio Theater, Danny Thomas show a million others.
Anyway, the forward is written by June foray.
She was Natasha.
I love her.
I had the hots for her.
And anyway, it goes, let's see, William Conrad, who is one of my favorites, that's because he was fat cannon.
I always liked those fatty textures.
But he was great.
He was in Gunsmoke on the radio.
He was Matt Dillon.
Okay.
Not the Matt Dillon you were thinking about.
Okay.
Wasn't that his name, Matt Dillon?
I think so.
Dawes Butler, Hans Connery.
Oh, I loved Hans Connery too, Bill Scott and Paul Freeze with the book is about it.
And June foray is the only one still alive.
How do you like that?
She got one shot and she's still alive.
At least I think she is.
Although it seems to me maybe she's not still alive because this book is a few years old, a couple of years.
And it seems to me we just had her open on her.
FORAY, June foray.
Do a Google on it.
But anyway, it's really an interesting book.
It's a permanent time to make these.
All right.
I knew I had Boris in here somewhere.
There you go.
Boris Bednaugh.
Here's Ray Faxes and said to you by chance, Catch Friday night, the new NBC series, the Book of Daniel.
Oh, I did not.
I heard about it.
A new series about a drug identity.
Yeah, that's the one I think I'd all been out of shape about.
A new series about a drug addicted minister, his drug pushing daughter, his gay son, and his brother-in-law who embezzled the church's money.
All right.
Not to mention the two bishops who are having an affair.
One of them is the minister's father, Bradley Reigns, from Guiding Light.
Who's Bradley Reigns?
I wonder what character he plays.
I guess I'll have to look that up now.
For some reason the Christians who all upset about this series, some local NBC affiliates refused to air it.
But I guess the truth really hurts.
If he missed your last Friday, I recommend you give it a look this Friday.
It's interesting.
Thank you, Ray.
The Book of Daniel.
They perverted Book of Daniel.
Well, there was a lot of beggining and begottening and beggining going on.
You know, everybody was getting something.
I write about that.
There's Ted Kennedy, you get it?
Sure.
The former chief, federal prosecutor for New Jersey.
But about been going through all of this.
It's really sad because you know he's going to get informed.
And then we'll be informed after he gets confirmed.
Here's the poll question for today.
And whatever.
And in the tomorrow, I'll spill the spill over.
What do you miss most about your childhood?
216 votes.
Having no worries, 66.
This is one of our fine polls ever.

You have a little faith.

My old neighborhood, 22.
Freedom, 14.
Ah.
Saturday morning cartoons, 13.
Now, as freedom is a kid like freedom is an adult except your old and your old and your
egg and ready to die as opposed to getting ready to live your life.
Something like that.
Like retirement.
Saturday morning cartoons, 13.
Going to school instead of work 11.
Hollywood, Tricken, Treat, and the 7.
Baseball cards, only 7.
Come on.
Just sniffing that gum, man.

Believe me in Sandy Claus III.
Bubble gum two.
Spring break.
One recess one.
My allowance one.
Believe me in God.

Maybe that's because we don't have any who believe in them then and they don't believe in
them now.
That's our crowd, you know.
Heave in bathrooms.
5670560.
Tom 560 and the Verizon Insignular wireless lines.
WCWAM.
Hello.
QAM.
Hi, Uncle Neil.
How are you?
Good.
How you doing?
Good.
You don't remember Bradley Reinson's a character's name.
That's not an actor.
He was death reigns his father.
No, that's, uh, it goes back.
And my Alzheimer's too heavy duty for him.
Oh, you'll tell us she was blonde.
She was like involved with fill-ups and, oh, man, that goes way back.
But it's, it's, you know how old some of these people are?
I mean, granted with makeup.
They make them look good.
If you saw a picture of him, you would recognize him right away.
Because he's been everything.
But like Beth, she's still a sensation.
I bet she, she's like, intermittent 50s.
Right, but that's not even the original Beth.
This goes back to like the original Beth.
Oh, my God.
Well, that's like before Jesus was a baby.
Yeah.
But it's, but you would be like.
Then it goes back to the pop-up of our days, I bet.
No, no, no, no.
That's what I was going back to.
Ah, fuck.
Nistva.
Nistva.
That's all he ever said was Nist.
I don't know what that means.
But Nistva.
I don't go back down.
I go back to like the Roger Thorpe days.
Oh, my God.
And Roger, and this is the only guy who fell off a big cliff like two different times he's still alive.
Yeah, but then the act, but then was it Richard's dad's love?
He got really sick.
Yeah, that's correct.
Yeah.
He had like, what's the thing that he get the, the mosquito that been by the tick?
Oh, oh.
Lime disease.
Lime disease, yeah.
Yeah, he got him died from Lyme disease.
Did you know that?
No, no, no, that I didn't know.
And I thought he had like Parkinson's.
No, he died on a day.
First they couldn't figure out what he had.
Then he come to find out he had Lyme disease.
And then he died.
Oh, that's wow.
Yeah, he said that.
He could have arrived here and threw up not that anybody in our audience cares.
But whatever.
And thank God that he's gone Sebastian Holtz would have no idea what that name came from.
Whatever happened to him.
He got on a plane.
He was going to kidnap a little little head there, whatever name is.
And Lisee.
And then he disappeared.
No, you know, that's a soap opera for you.
Yeah.
And thank God he disappeared.
And of course, Philip is out there somewhere.
And we're supposed to forget about that.
He's still alive.
But I guess the storyline didn't go over too big.
Is it the same after he was still playing Philip?
Yeah.
And they've been changing because I met him a long time ago.
Really?
Well, I went on the satigyding like years and years and years and years ago met, you know, like Justin and...
He looked so bad now.
He was always kind of gaunt looking.
But it looks like he's taken the skin and stretched it over a skeleton.
You know what I'm talking about?
Yeah, they kept...
All the bones in his head protrude.
They try to keep them going and going and going.
Yeah.
Like the energizer bunny.
Have a great day, sweetheart.
Love you.
Hi.
Say hi to Beth.
Now Beth's still is pretty good.
And I'll tell you who's really ancient.
You see, we see these people on TV year after year, like on wheels, squeal of fortune.
Couple of nights ago at the end of the show, I don't know why they showed her feet.
But Vanna was doing something about her feet.
Okay?
And what she was wearing sandals or whatever, better than the props pinks red slippers by the way.
But her feet were the giveaway.
I mean, you can put a lot of makeup on the rest of your body, on your face and whatever.
Right.
But it's kind of hard to make up your bare feet.
Right?
And her feet looked like the feet of a hundred-year-old bag.
I mean, oh my.
And I thought to myself, just stop and think about how many years that show been on.
About third, man.
That's why I'm here.
She's in her 50s.
You give me crap for having a foot fetish, which I don't, but it's a very telling sign to check out the feet.
I believe you.
If you've seen, I don't know how much of your in Vanna, which...
Yeah, so-so.
But believe me, if you saw the feet, you'd say, that...
Yeah.
You'd run.
You had a feet of a 400-year-old woman.
Also like Paris Hilton, also, a 400-year-old harpy feet.
Yeah, but what kind of like fits in with the rest of that bitch, so it does.
I mean, Vanna is considered hot.
I don't know why, but nevertheless, she got no boobies.
You got recently...
Yeah, she was in her life.
And then it was like a hundred years ago.
I thought I'd make a picture of her there.
And that stage, Jack, has never changed.
You notice what they do with makeup?
Exactly the same now as you did a hundred years.
Do I Google on that?
Why do you do Google in whatever else you do with Google?
That is feet.
No, no.
Yeah, Google...
That is feet.
Looks like somebody beat you to it.
No, seriously, do a Johnny pump on Vanna's feet.
Google a Wheel of Fortune, see how long that show has been on the air.
Oh, I'm just...
Well, although in the current incarnation, because it was on originally with Jack Ass,
oh, what else is his name, which I hate him, that awful, awful, the worst...
Chuck's swillery.
Okay, it was the thing.
I'm gonna use to have the ceramic delimation.
I'm gonna use to go shopping, remember that?
And they have his picture of a contestant like in the corner of the screen,
and they'd be going shopping.
I'll take the canoe for at 2000.
Oh, brother, say Jack was born in 46.
So, I mean, so he's almost 60 years old.
He's almost his old design.
He's 59 years old for Christ's sake.
Yeah, October, 46.
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
He'll be 60 this year.
Maybe he's got a drawstring on the back of his head
where they staturest face tight.
Is that what it is?
It's how they do it.
I mean, he doesn't do much, but he does exactly what he needs to do.
He's fine for that show.
He didn't do a thing, and he's making millions.
He's making millions.
And what about her?
Did they actually list her date of birth in there?
Would that be a clean one?
Well, I just want to their bios.
Oh.
Okay, well, do it after the break.

What do I tell you?
Yeah.
He's got ancient feet.
That's the name giveaway.
Where?
Where?
Wait till we get to see Pats' feet.
Oh, I don't think he's anything.
Oh, can you imagine all the toe jam in there?
Woo!
Controversial lobbyists had close contact with the Bush team.
The president signed on to the executive branch.
He'll construed the title, TAN, and division A.
In the president Bush's first ten month,
I want to give you a little flavor of the Alito hearings.
In the first ten months,
the GOP fundraiser Jack Abramoff and his lobbying team
log nearly 200 contacts with the new administration
as they pressed for friendly hires at federal agencies
and sought to keep the Northern Mariana Islands exempt
from the minimum wage and other laws record show.
The meetings between Abramoff's lobbying team
and the administration range from Attorney General John Ascroft,
the policy advisors and Dick Cheney's office
is going to his lobbying firm Billing Records.
Abramoff, while we know he's under investigation,
and it is until Abramoff's lobbying colleagues
on the Marianas won political appointments
inside federal agencies.
Our standing with the new administration promises to be solid
as several friends of the CNMI islands will soon be taking
a high ranking position to the administration,
including within the Interior Department of Abramoff,
wrote in a January 2001 letter
that which he persuaded the island government
to follow him as a client who was new lobbying
firm Greenberg Trawrig.
Ah-ha.
The reception Abramoff's team received
from the Bush administration was in stark contrast
to the Chile relations of the Clinton years.
Abramoff then at the Preston Gates firm scored few meetings
with Clinton-Aids and allowed the lobbyist
and the islands vehemently opposed one house of attempts
to extend U.S. labor laws to the territory's clothing factories.
I wonder what Kathy Lee thinks about that.
The records from Abramoff's firm
are obtained by the Associated Press from the Marianas
under an open record request.
Chronicle Abramoff's careful cultivation
of relations with Bush's political team
as far back as 1997.
In that year, Abramoff changed charge to Marianas
for getting them Texas Governor George Bush
to write letter expressing
support for the Pacific Territory School Choice proposal
his billing records show.
I hope you'll keep my office informed
on the progress of this initiative, Bush wrote in July 1897,
letter praising the island's school plan
and copying him in Abramoff deputy.
As for the number of Abramoff lobbying team contact
with Bush officials documented the billing records,
white house spokesman Aaron Healy said,
we don't know how he defines contacts.
Andrew Blum, a spokesman for Abramoff decline comment.
The Greenberg-Troward former Abramoff work
between late 2004 and 2004
is investigating Abramoff's working cooperating
with government investigations.
How do you like that?
High contacts with all the Bush crowd.
What a surprise, huh?
Shocker.
What a shock.
Birds of a feather are crooked together.
Oh, here's this Michael Zazel,
business three-week care about this.
I also the first red, what is it,
red shirt to die on Star Trek?
Is that what it says, red shirt?
I guess.
Yes, red shirt.
What is that?
Never heard of it.
The red shirts were the people
that always got bumped off in Star Trek.
Well, he was Roger Thorpe on garlic.
He died on December 1998.
Oh, it says here Lou Gehrish disease.
Lou Gehrish, now I thought he died from it.
He was the godfather of Christian Slater,
so already you hate him like poise.
Yeah, whoo, whoo, that's his name is Zazelow.
Maybe that's why he's dead.
I mean, see, I just learned something there.
I thought he died from Lyme disease.
And maybe that was one of the things they thought.
But it was Lou Gehrish disease.
That'll see you soon.
Today on the luckiest man,
somebody QYN, hello?
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
Okay, that's a great set.
Thank you, Renna.
You were off in the assignments on the Mariana's.
You know, these rich people, extremely rich.
Yeah.
All they want to do is write the floor
and keep them down.
And just, you know,
give themselves tax cuts.
So our children can pay for it.
Just make me sick.
There's a lot of people that you've just
got here in height 9-11 and about the offshore,
the so-called offices of Halle Burton,
so that they can subvert the law and do business with Iran
and do whatever they want.
And there's nothing there but like a PO box.
It's a shame and a scam and a bill doesn't care.
Right, they don't have to pay taxes.
I mean, something on the news about a couple of months ago,
it's had, you know, like 80% of the taxes 50 years ago
were paid by corporations now with the other way around.
You know, 80% of the...
And it's like the corporations are like the,
the only of country, you know?
It just makes me mad.
All right, later.
Good luck to you, Pellie.
I'll look for you at the border.
Okay, we'll keep it up.
We'll keep the...
Although quite frankly,
if they put Stephen Harper in here,
it ain't going to be too much better.
Because he'll take him back 50 years.
He'll try to...
his best on whatever progress they make,
which is a lot, you know?
How he can be like many points ahead in Ontario,
which is so liberal, only second to Quebec.
And of course, Quebec is a non-factor,
because they got their own party there.
They could becouvert.
How do you like that?
The what?
The Quebec-Wah.
I say.
Yeah, Jeal De Cep, he was in the debate last night.
He's the hot shot from Quebec.
He's the one running for our Prime Minister on the block.
And of course, they don't get any votes outside of Quebec.
But he keeps referring to it as Canada and Quebec.
It's not quite the New York.
Oh, yeah.
Quebec is a nation.
They kept the Tradye Paul Martin.
He won't refer to it as a nation.
It's a...
It's not not just disgusting.
And Paul Martin, who of course is at Quebec,
or Quebecer himself,
he don't have the balls to tell me.
You blow it out your ass, okay?
Either get with the programmer,
go ahead and succeed.
We'll pack you a...
I'll pack you a smoked meat sandwich, eh?
God.
It's, yeah, politics all over the world sucks.
It's just a bunch of quirks like the guy just said, you know?
So you do the best you can.
That's all you can do, baby.
Do the best you can, and grab whatever graph you can.
And I said, how come we never get any?
I have to talk to Jo about that.
About getting some graphs?
Yeah, there's some graph, man.
I'll kick back a little part of that.
You're gonna hit some only steppy graph, right?
Hop on board.
I'm so sick and tired of those tennis players, you know?
I avoid them quite easily.
No, you don't avoid that one.
Which one?
Oh, that one.
Oh, wow.
What do you miss most about your childhood, brascan?
I was pulled today out of fabulous pool.
Two of the 80 votes.
Having no worries, 89.
No bills to pay, 34.

Huh.
And then Jim Park was in a locker room that one day.
Didn't have any.
Well, my own neighborhood is got.

You know Mariah and Whitney, they beat the pins up Britney.
We still had some teasers, but also there was Weiser and Weiser and Sophie.
She walked in, yes, she was good for talking.
I wondered, in she's survived that, 1990, 1995.
2000 For sure Stuck Next year we'll have more love.
I can see it now, I've missed out pure Matt Hale, might even fight a cure for that guy like
O' Moore, when you feel you're SUV, that cash will all be free.
Even when it was cut to our taxes, Deppettus will still go down.
Dan Rader will not use taxes, Osama will be found.
I know there will be peace throughout the Middle East.
All things will graduate in queer eyes, will be.
So straight please let it be a great year.
I sure hated this year, don't need more doors, elections, and no more blue infections,
maybe we'll be cleaners and stargums will be leaner.
Let's all look up the bright side, it's 2000, 2000, in 2005.
2000 too, and of course people might say, well, I'll just talk about the ancient past like living in the past.
Well, you know with a bush crowd in here, you better get used to it.
That's right, the good olden days.
That's right, they turned the clock back 50 years.
In fact, pretty soon you dark folks won't be able to vote at all, maybe as soon as this fall.
And get away from that water fountain.
And again, away from that Johnny pump.
Well, that's right, we're going to have separate dark-completed fire hydrants for the dark colored folks, for their own Johnny pumps.
We'll paint it black.
Right.
I don't see, Lynn says, how about my purse being young and healthy?
Isn't that nice?
Yeah, I heard something young and healthy.
What?
We'll put it on there as soon as Josh gets back in the room.
We'll write down the ego, don't tell me he's having the food come in?
Oh, that's where he's, I'm glad he's got his priorities in order.
Just like everybody else that ever worked on this show, food comes first on the near-roger show.
Make no mistake about that, getting the free food, which I'm sure he's also got that Magnolia DVD.
That's right.
Now, if he watches that and A falls asleep in the middle of it, which it is very long, or B, watches the whole thing and then tells me it's sucked, it's just going to be devastating.
I'll tell him to lie.
No, no, no, no, I don't want him to lie.
There it is, he's holding it in his hand in the movie too.
How about that?
And if he's there under the under-resarm pit?
Yeah, I get that food in here quick, boy. I'm not following as they say in Ireland.
56670560, pound 560, and a Verizon singular wireless line.
Man, we got like a Luth and our, in our, kill.
A Luth and our kill.
Do you ever want those?
Not lately.
No, seriously, it's like, it's just, it's like we've been born again.
Baby, it's born again, QIM.
Now, maybe I'm giving it a little bit too carried away, but for what everybody is telling me and you notice, you notice how everybody is hopping too.
Remember, hop sing, right?
From Banana, or never show you what was that with Banana?
No, is that guy's name or something you do?
And now we got, we're hopping too.
Because, like, clearance is boring.
I talked about those two pieces of copy.
And before you could like, even a fart, all of a sudden they were like, a replacement copy came in.
Just like it always does.
Are you planning on a happy day again?
I like that song, by the way.
Everyone's how it continues.
It's a good song since they're so great.
It must be just coming out of the atmosphere.
Oh, it's coming from the Lord.
All right.
Good evening.
Couldn't even hear it and I talked to him.
How do you like that?
Did it bite Fior?
You used the voice.
That timing, baby.
You just speed your way to it.
That's what Stevie Wonder told me.
Okay, Killer.
WMQAM, hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, boy, where do I begin when I miss some childhood?
But I would have to say, I miss freedom from aches and pains.
You know, we eat to run around and play in the playground and you wouldn't hurt.
No, you're laughing at pain.
Laughing at pain.
Yeah, no pain.
There's no aches and pains.
Right.
And remember firm, smooth, in, no gel.
God, something else.
Who had a gel?
I do.
Everybody got it.
Okay.
Grab it.
Don't just don't forget that.
I don't have a thing, Neil.
Yes.
Please, when you speak to the new guy, please remind him about those sparsons because we're a mature adult out here and we want our parts back.
Okay, well, even little kids for it, so I'll have to remind him of that.
Okay, thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Work out those gels.
Five success, of course, my mother actually went more concerned about bowels than gels, but that's an industry.
You think it's just coincident that my mother's initials were MB, which vanquished, of course, is BM.
It must have been.
And I don't think there was no coincidence.
No, I'll believe it.
Just obsessed.
Oh, my God.
I've got to talk about a magnificent obsession, which he wouldn't have given for just before she finally met her maker.
Just one good explosive well.
7 o'clock.
7 o'clock.
7 o'clock.
2 o'clock.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, I am.
Hi, Neil.
Some of my patients need to get your list.
Okay.
I wonder if it's spring break.
Well, the way it is now, they're making it so short, you can barely, it's like a blip.
I'll still take it.
Okay, thanks.
Good to see you.
Yes.
Okay, I know I'm on here two years.
I agree with most of the people you hate on TV.
Uh-huh.
But I want to know if there's anybody you like for no-foot global news.
For no-foot watch.
Local news in South Florida right now?
Yes, are anybody watching?
No, absolutely not.
What's the left of all the e-holes?
Uh, there isn't any.
I'm serious.
I'm serious.
I keep threatening to turn off channel 4 when I'm near and I can't do it because the rest of them are so bad.
All right, well if you think of anybody, let me know.
Okay, good luck.
How about Angela Ray?
She's good for a few lives, huh?
Good or why Angela Ray?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
All those minors who are dead.
Ha ha ha ha!
She is just a film goose, you know?
How many minutes did she last in New York?
I thought turn them in.
She was there almost as long as Mr. Ego.
You will be pleased to know they gave her a chair with a back on it so that she don't fall over backwards.
No, man, you guys are real funny.
I want you to say something funny because you're my dancing bad.
Do something funny.
Party up.
I wait and do something funny.
You're my dancing bad.
Come on, dancing bad.
Ha ha ha ha!
Oh.
Yeah.
56670560, pound 5662, the Verizon and Cedar Riveus line.
What is it?
There's a new one to add to Ireland.
So yes, it was all old, stale crap.
But there's something new and exciting.
We can look forward to I'm sure just about every day for a week or two until somebody puts them out of his misery.
Or until he finds that Johnny pump.
WDQYM, hello.
I have personality.
Yeah.
Remember what I told you yesterday?
Yep.
Now bye bye.
There's a whole thing here and that sound no more.
In the 50 years that Grant Goodman is known and corresponded with a colleague in the Philippines, he's never had any reason to suspect that their friendship was anything but spectacularly ordinary.
But now he believes that the relationship with somehow sparked the interest of the Department of Homeland Security and led the agency to place him under surveillance.
Last month Goodman, an A1-year-old, 81-year-old retired University of Kansas History professor, received a letter from his friend in the Philippines that had been opened and re-sealed
with a strip of dark green tape varying the words by border protection and carrying the official Homeland Security Seal.
I had no idea Homeland Security would open person letters goodman told MSNBC in a phone interview.
That's why I learned it in the media.
I thought it should be known publicly that this is going on, he said.
Goodman originally showed the letter to his own local newspaper, the Kansas-based Lawrence Journal World.
I was shocked and there was a certain degree of disbelief in the beginning Goodman said we noticed the letter had been tampered with, adding that he felt his privacy had been invaded.
I think I must be under some kind of surveillance he be saying.
Goodman is no stranger to male snooping as an officer during WWII.
He was responsible for reading all outgoing mail of the men in his command and censoring any passages that might provide clues as to his unit's position.
Do you know what your unit's position is?
But we didn't do it as crumsily as they've done and I can tell you that could be noted with no small amount of irony in his voice.
Isn't that funny that this doesn't appear to be any kind of surreptitious ever to hear he said?
The letter comes from a retired Filipino history professor, Goodman declined to identify her.
And although the Philippines is on the US government's radar screen as a potential spawning ground for muslim-related terrorism, Goodman said his friend is a devout cat lick and not giving the supporting such causes.
They don't even go to the Hodge.
No?
Can you tell me what that is?
What is that?
What an idiotic.
A nice outfit, so by the way, we'll say that.
They're all stuck into the Hodge.
All muslims that have to go to do that once in their lifetime.
Otherwise they're not going to get to 85,000 virgins.
I do know this once you've gone to the Hodge.
Yes, they get to call you Hodge.
Is the Hodge like the Taj Mahal?
A spokesman for the Customs and Border Protection Division said he couldn't speak directly to Goodman's case, but it ignores that the agency can't really do open mail.
Some of the US citizens that originates from a foreign country whenever it's deemed necessary, phone calls, letters, all of these things.
And all mail originating outside the US customs territory, that's to be delivered inside the US customs territory subject to customs examination.
I wonder if it's from Canada, too, eh?
That includes personal correspondence.
In other words, if somebody was sending me some cough drops, they probably wouldn't get here.
Probably not.
All mail means all mail said John Mohan, a CBP spokesman emphasizing the point.
All mail means all mail.
The process isn't something we're trying to hide.
He said, noting the wording on the agency's website.
We've had this authority since before the Department of Homeland Security was created.
However, Mohan declined to outlive criteria used to determine what a piece of a personal correspondence should be open, but said obviously it's a security related criteria.
Mohan also declined to say how often or in what volume CBP might be opening mail.
All I can really say is that Customs and Border Protection does undertake opening mail when it's deemed to be necessary, in other words, whatever they feel like.
Oh, look at that.
There's one for that.
George Rodriguez, well, we know he's a subversive spick, so we're going to open up your mail.
That's right.
Now, in fact, open up some of our bills and why you're going to pay a few.
That'd be nice.
That would be a good idea.
How is the Zalido hearings coming?
But for sure, the Sherry has the responsibility to meet.
I didn't move, but I'm up.

This is Neil Rogers.
This is 516-Q-A-A-A.
I want to talk today about why we went into Iraq, why we stayed in Iraq, and why we cannot and will not leave Iraq for generations to come.
It is because of oil.
As president, I'm responsible for the decision to go into Iraq.
At any point along the way, I could have avoided war.
So we must let the American people in rightly so.
Station Iraq are high because of oil and we will not leave until victory has been achieved.
I got bless you all.
Don't forget your once-set, well start school and it's going to be big money and all you guys have better be there.
Remember that scene on the internet, 9-11?
People are going to die, but we are going to make a lot of money.
Sad part of that is there is going to be a lot of money to be made and we are all going to be there hooking up our own...
You!
All of the bad news is the Kurds got there first.
What do you miss most about your childhood?
Having no worry, I know the arsonist got there first and then the Kurds.
Having no worries, 109, oh carefree life man.
Of course not everybody had that kind of a childhood.
Right, foster children, sure, abandoned children, abused children, drug-accused parents.
Right, all of these...
All of these things.
No bills to pay 43, playing sports 40.
Oh yeah, my old neighborhood 35, Saturday morning cartoons 21,
which means one thing to some people and the Ozzolophogies means like actually at the movie theater Saturday morning cartoons and cereals.
I'm not talking about breakfast cereals, I'm talking about movie cereals.
Like what's the one that I absolutely love?
Which is a channel here that every periodically shows them all like one after the other one.
Captain...
I used to call them rocket man, but that's not the name of the...
What is it?
Commando Cody.
Commando Cody, not Commando.
Commando Cody in the...
What?
A little bit of a lot of that.
Google it.
What is that actually called?
Commando Cody in the...
Something of...
Any of that...
That funky space suit that he wore, he was one of the frontiest looking guys for a hero, you know?
But he put on that space suit with a little dial on it, it looked like an old fashioned radio dial.
And all of a sudden he had that helmet.
Remember that?
No, you're not incorrect.
It's a brief overview, the site that I'm on right now.
A brief overview of Commando Cody, aka rocket man.
Oh really?
Well maybe that's what they called it in the theater.
Maybe it was said...
I'm not sure with the universe.
Right.
Did you ever see it?
I've seen the old footage...
Right.
Oh, it was a so-can't man.
He had...
It was just a front-y old guy with a wrinkled up old suit.
I know this guy.
He got like a coffee can on his head.
That's rocket man.
Looks like a percolator.
Anyway, we had those cereals and of course they would leave you hanging and then you had to come back the next Saturday and...
And then they only lasted 15 minutes.
It's just like once upon a time there were TV shows.
I know this comes with a great shock, but since that lady started a soap opera thing...
I think guiding light was one of them, I'm not sure, but there were soap operas that run for 15 minutes.
Now can you imagine...
Then they went to 30...
But third man!
And most of them are an hour.
Now what's the one that's still 30 to one of your wife's likes that ridge that horrible?
The bold and the bold and the grotesque...
Oh, that's all I got like three characters in it.
Pretty much.
Anyway, no bills to pay for.
Play sports for 41.
My old neighborhood 35 missed the old hood.

My parents being healthy one, recess one, believing in God one, and my allowance still so lamented
you know.
Most people are real cheap parents.
You know, I remember this is going to sound really strange.
But one of the things I remember from my childhood, I think of my cousin and I, or maybe a friend of mine,
and I used to go around with like a little pale.
Okay.
No, I'm serious.
And for some reason, for some reason, in our neighborhood, there were places where people
had like, I mean, I never heard of people burying money in the ground.
But we had a couple of spots where we knew there was like all this chains, like quarters
and half dollars and so her dollars.
And we would like go around and find money in the ground.
Don't ask me how, and I'm not making that up, but it's true.
Okay.
What was that all about?
Well, what were people doing sticking a bunch of money in the ground?
Maybe they were pedophiles, hoping children would come and try to dig it up.
Is that what it was?
I don't know.
I've never heard of such a thing.
A magnet?
Well, I'm just telling you.
Just like the time I found it was 15 or 20 bucks on the ground, by right by the curb and my
knee beach.
That's the story.
That's the true story.
I don't think it was 15.
I think it was like 11 or 12 bucks, but it sure is how bought me a nice lunch that day.
Maybe it was 8 bucks.
And there might have been it.
What are the odds of that though?
You know, or ATM card isn't working or the...
At that time was the flagship bank I'm watching an avenue and it was out of order, the ATM.
That because on those days it was like there was an ATM on every street corner.
If your bank ATM didn't work, forget about it.
You were going to get an okay.
And so I was going to go hungry.
I was going to have to go back to my little tiny apartment on the beach over there and eat
like whatever.
Scraps.
And here's 11 or 12 bucks.
Like I think it was a two fives and a one or two fives and two ones.
And then of course I told you that time that I found the 80 bucks outside the door my building
here.
Remember that?
Well what's that all about?
I think instead of wasting my time here I'd be just looking for money.
Sure.
What is that thing that people use to go to the beach and they use that like a...
That's a detector.
I was just saying.
Yeah, metal detector would be a beach comer.
Yeah.
Get your shovel.
I'm going over to the Ontario right now.
I'm combing the beach and cruise the beach.
Get the sun shining.
Why not?
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
It's like panning for gold.
Right?
Very similar.
I know some guys are like...
Oh, don't, don't, don't.
They're digging for gold.
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
I have personality.
Keep it up.
Just keep it up because it ain't coming on.
It really is.
You're right.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Pound 5, 60 and leave a resident singular on this line.
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
We used to take the quarters and glue them down to the concrete in front of the pharmacy.
That was always fun.
I am.
Right.
That was right before he hit his first lobotomy.
Are we out of that support?
I'm kidding.
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
My belt's coming for me.
Which they do.
Where should I...
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I think it was the edge of night.
There was like 15, 19 minutes.
No, I don't think so.
I think that was a half an hour.
It was just before the secret storm.
I was first for tomorrow.
That was also 15 minutes.
I think that was on a 12, 30 and 12, 45 was guiding light.
Those are the two.
You know what I missed early?
Snowballs.
Okay.
Good one.
Thanks.
Thanks, Palli.
Of course, in Florida we probably won't get that many, although most of you are transplanted
from the end of the world, from some place.
Throwing snowballs.
Sure.
That's a good one.
I'm going to get a bunch of balls.
And in South Florida, they just throw up lots of balls.
And Boka, all those old coots.
Boka.
How about that, Vanna and Pat?
Is that a real...
We never...
Nobody would have known.
Who the fuck are they talking about?
Huh?
I never really thought about it.
Well, I mean, just...
You stop and think about it.
I'm like Bob Barker.
I bet she's at least 140.
Right.
How old do you say he is?
I'll say 82.
Okay.
I was going to say 80 something.
Low 80.
Yeah.
Google add.
Google old Bob and his wife here.
WQIM.
Hello.
Neil?
Yes, sir.
Oh, I got a...
I got a spy report.
The bush mic is coming to town tomorrow up here on Palm Beach.
Oh, my God.
Staying at the colony hotel.
I'll be damned.
Well, I got a little insider.
Okay.
Well, good luck to you folks.
Maybe he can go convince all those Jews that over for Pat Buchanan that he was a better choice.
Twenty-three.
I'll be your part.
1923.
So he's 82.
December, though.
What did I just say, though?
82.
Well, how about 82 in December?
Good guess.
Don't look at day-over 81.
I'll tell you that as matter of fact, it is not spring check.
He's okay.
I don't know.
I mean, he's got that, uh...
He's got his issues, but he's all right.
I like that show.
And that show, I think, I think, that once he croaks, he decides finally to hang it up.
I think that's the end of that show.
I mean, he keeps replacing the announces on there because they keep croaking, you know?
Right.
Johnny Olson, Rob Roddy.
Hey, Rob, where do you keep going to Thailand?
You know they'll try to re-incarnate it somehow.
Yeah, but it won't work.
You're just like family feud.
When I was home, oh...
Oh, they got a family feud on there.
Now, who's the host on that?
That fat face guy with a beard?
I don't know what to say.
Oh, Louie Anderson?
No, no, no.
Louie Anderson was in a room.
He was like on for about five minutes and now they got a new guy.
That makes you Jones for Louie Anderson.
Oh, come on, Ray Coleman.
We want him back.
I guess he had a nasty divorce, but then there was a reason.
I mean, somebody was talking about that.
Well, you read the story.
Somebody texted it or something.
And what was it?
He was Catholic.
He thought he was going to be the next Johnny Carson Ray Coombs.
He thought it was just a hysterical, great personality and, of course.
And not only that, but on family feud, a lot of people were pissed off because they mistreated Dawson.
There's much of a drunken, inquirerant, and eagantist, as he was.
But I thought it was okay with Ray Coombs.
He was fine.
I say bring him back.
You better be a guy to go now.
Oh, you haven't seen the family feud guy now?
No.
Oh, my God.
He is.
So, you know, you know how there are shows that if they don't have the right, it's like it's like we'll affortune.
I'm telling you, when Chuck Swillery was hosting that, she went down here, went off the ear.
Murf Griffin was like a pick and dingo berries.
He was upset.
And then they finally brought in Pat and Vanna, and they're still there.
They don't do much, but at least they don't, at least they don't chase you away like Chuck Swillery.
He is just an evil derogal.
What was the other show he was on?
One of those dating shows was it was Newlyweds, I think.
No, that was Bob, but you banks.
No, he was on Love Connection or something.
Love Concoction.
The host is Richard Karn, which is the guy from Home Improvement.
Oh, that guy.
He was the unfunny guy on Home Improvement.
Yeah, and if you thought he was unfunny on there, you ought to see how unfunny he is on Family Feud.

What the hell?
Help!
Can we open the shanty, man?
Why did you put a shanty there in the studio in the first place?
I wanted the place to look more like when it's a place.
I never open here!
Looks like I don't have to.
I'm going!
1234, if you remember that movie, Pin?
Yes.
The last movie that I had sent you.
And it was pretty good.
And you remember the ending?
Yes.
A dead woman dressed in white was positioned in a chair in front of a television set for two and a half years.
Ooh.
Because she told her caregiver she didn't want to be buried in plan to return the coroner.
So this is in Cincinnati.
I'll be right back.
Don't show my body when I'm dead.
Hamilton County coroner Dr. O'Dell Owen said Monday describing Johannes's Pope's wishes.
Don't bury me.
I'm coming back.
Pope 61.August 29, 2003.
Her caretaker and friend whose name has been released left the woman upstairs in the home with the TV and air conditioning on while the body slowly decayed and mummified authority said.
Oh, she could be one of those mummers now.
Or a hubber.
Remember that?
How much for a mummer?
Some family members continued to live downstairs in a house since her death.
Police went to the house last Wednesday after a relative went and seen a Pope in two and a half years called him.
They found a staircase behind a door blocked by a basket.
And climbed to the second floor where they found the body.
The staircase was blocked by a basket.
What kind of basket?
Oh, I don't know, but there was a little dog at the bottom of the stairs.
You know what the dog did?
It puts the large in the basket.
Right.
Probably to keep the body like anyway standing outside one could smell death.
Owen said.
They could smell death.
Discussion back.
Owen said he had not determined the causative.
But found no signs of abuse or foul play.
Authorities have worked in the term whether any problems were committed.
But Owen said they had the caretaker and family members apparently didn't benefit in any way by keeping Pope.
I keep in the body.
Kind of like Tony Perkins would have liked it a lot.
How could they say they didn't benefit?
What a conversation piece.
Yeah, exactly.
Like that turd, that toyard turd.
Here is the fact that this is a really good one.
Boy, you know something?
Pinball machines.
Are they?
Oh yeah.
That's one of my favorites.
Sure.
I never, I never got to play very much.
There was a Roseland Park in Canondag, New York, where I went to high school.
They had various games and they had pinball machines there.
But back in those days, I don't think we had like all the arcades like they had today.
Well, they still have them and they're still making them and some of them are quite elaborate.
You'll be good.
And I love pinball machines.
There's so much freaking fun I came in.
And that's one of, you know, I put that down and I changed my vote.
All right.
And the thing I missed is I wish if I had the chance to do it all over again besides diddling my classmates.
I would have loved to have played a lot more pinball.
Should I put arcade games in general?
No, pinball machines, mon.
Okay, I'm going to put machine.
They had it with you during my Orlando misadventure that I told you about the McDonald's we were trying to find out with the game room and the arcade.
I had many pinball machines.
Oh, so new and some old you'll be pleased to know.
Maybe that's one of the reasons instead of these violent video games.
Instead of this gangster rap, maybe we ought to have today's kids playing a lot more pinball machines.
Did you have a favorite themed one or something?
No, a favorite themed one.
Well, they made pinball machines out of things.
I like the naked tab 101 myself.
All right.
We want to shoot the ball in tabs.
And they had the Playboy pin machine, the Charlie's Angels pinball machine.
Well, I think that's after me.
It's based on the basic and simple.
You know what I mean?
We didn't have nothing to flip over when I was back in a hundred years ago.
Huh?
They had baseball themed ones where the flippers look like bats, you know, and they really the play area looked like a diamond.
I'll be damned.
And also we had the table hockey game, you know, a friend of mine I used to play it all the time.
Oh, yeah, the table top now with the wooden kind.
Wooden.
Wouldn't you?
The players were like, you can control each player like little metallic players.
Oh, like food ball.
Yeah, kind of like exactly.
I love you.
You used to play that for hours and hours.
I'll kick your ass at food ball.
An academic panel investigating the worth of South Korean researcher, Wang Wu's suck.
Said Tuesday, he's suck.
Oh, no, they said he fabricated data to support his claim that he called human embryo.
He was an extracted stem cells from them, capping the spectacular fall of a man.
What's loaded as a pioneer?
What an idiot, huh?
Well, what kind of a jackass does that?
The latest revelation by Seoul National University panel was another disappointment to scientists and patients who like,
Wang's claim of a cloning breakthrough had offered hope to millions suffering from paralysis and debilitating diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and AIDS.
The same panel concluded last month at Wang, falsely claimed in 2005 to develop 11 stem cell lines tailored to specific patients.
Wang did not have any proof to show that cloned embryonic stem cells were ever created the panel said in report,
disputing the central claims in Wang's 2004 paper in the paper in the journal science.
In the paper, Wang said he had cloned a human embryo and extracted stem cells from it.
But the University can't start whether an embryo was cloned, saying there was a high possibility it could have merely been a mutated egg,
which could appear to have similar qualities of an embryo.
The 2004 paper was written on fabricated data to show that the stem cells matched the DNA of the provider,
although it did not, the panel said.
However, here's the good news.
The panel of Helvet Wang's claim last year to have created the world's first cloned dog, an Afghan hound named Snuffy.
Really ugly, too.
Afghan hounds are ugly to be human.
You like Afghan hounds?
That particular.
No.
The journal nature, which published Wang's cloned dog article, said today preliminary results from its independent test also showed Snuffy was indeed a cloned.
That achievement wasn't regarded as important as the cloning of human embryos, though because various animals are ready to cloned.
Hello, Dali, and all of that crap.
The University condemned the fabrication, said they should be punished.
This conduct cannot be just seen as an act that fools the whole scientific community in the public in the report said,
just based on the facts of the fabrications that have been disclosed, the penalty has to be severe as in,
but a pain like that.
Hang his ass.
What do you say?
All right, twice.
After the break, I wanted to do that, I swear, about the toxic pet food.
That is just so pathetic, you know.
Did you see it on the news at all?
No.
And somebody's golden retriever, they had two goldens.
One of them.
Yeah.
One of the younger ones, she was only four years old.
She died, and the other one, they had like, do all kinds of massive, but they saved the other older one.
Anybody who would kill a golden retriever will.
I mean, I realized it was an accident, but the company.
They ought to be there right there with every searcher that hung it, that suck guy, because they suck.
Don't you agree?
Yes, I'm going to tell you right now, anybody who's not a dog lover will.
What's for you?
In 2019 till 1 a QA, the Amor Coast is floated as number one Asian gourmet buffet is rated by Zagat Restaurant Review.

Fuck, 30, man!

For the Amor Coast, call 954-572-3822, and be sure and tell Richard that bread.
Is he still with us?
Yeah.
That bread, or Billy, or Adam, is sent you by...
This is New Rogers.
This is 516-2-A.
George Bush keeps saying so.
He's improving the US border patrols.
For such a sick show's chameleon, folks, not getting from Mexico.
They're hiding in the trees, when they're cost-effects just as temporary.
They get paid, God-deafs, for 30 cents from all your neighbors' lawn.
Your neighbors' lawn, your neighbors' unborder, that's more the whole than a flat-dumbed cheese.
Looks like we'll be cooking up for hot tumbleies.
Sometimes I wish I had a fence around me, but I need a maze from my home.
I'm thinking back to the area, and now I'm going to read the word that would describe it, schlock.
Remember how many times we complained about the fact we seemed to be like schlocking our way through life?
No, I don't remember that.
Just put it on the log, fake your way through, and don't bother me with the details.
As opposed to the new guy who actually seems to be interested in doing business.
What do you mean?
Like doing some serious business, like the radio business, as opposed to like Greg and his friends, his personal cling on friends.
Greg and his charity cases.
But anyway, give me the dog food thing, what is this really serious?
Although I never did hear of what diamond dog food did you ever hear that bring?
No, diamond pet food thing.
Our dog has to have special food anyway.
Why is that?
What do you mean special food like pampered and spoiled?
No, like medically particular for, he gets stones and, you know, that's the thing.
He gets stoned? Well, your house has no surprise to me.
Shotgun.
Damn it.
He gets stones?
Yeah, he's made like gallstones.
Like gallstones has had two surgeries already.
Really?
So he has special low mineral dog food so that he doesn't build up stones?
Well, I'll be damned.
The US Food and Drug Administration reports that at least 76 dogs nationwide are believed to have died
as a result of eating contaminated diamond pet foods.
The company is recalled 19 varieties of dog and cat food because test showed high levels of afflatoxin,
a naturally occurring toxic chemical that comes from a fungus found on corn,
another grains across severe liver damage and animals.
The company we called products manufactured as Gastin South Carolina plant
from around September, November of last year, based on sample testing,
diamond is narrowed down the exposure to food produced on October 11th.
The FDA and South Carolina Department of Agriculture have launched investigations.
Customers have purchased the recalled diamond pet food manufactured in the South Carolina plant.
Should immediately stop using it and return any remaining product to the retailer according to the FDA,
the range of the day codes being reviewed are best by 01 through March 07,
best by 11 June 07.
FDA has discovered that some of the recalled product was exported to release 29 countries,
including countries within the EU.
These countries have been notified.
Diamond officials say they're doing what they can to help affect pet owners.
Let me give you a better about them.
Oh, yeah.
I wonder if they know Harvey and Marilyn Diamond.
It's going to take some time to take care of all these customers.
We're going to do what's said the company she's operating off is remarked Brinkvin.
Diamond has promised to reimburse pet owners for vet bills and other cost associated
with the afflatoxin poisoning, which officials now believe may include pets in Europe
and other areas outside the country where the food is distributed.
So not only are we killing people all over the world, but we're killing dogs all over the world.
Nice going America.
The company set up a call center stamp with veterinarians.
The call volume peaked at about 2000 calls a day last week, Brinkvin said.
Shanika Stewart has been caring for a alien nine-year-old child,
force feeding the animal with a syringe six times a day since suffering permanent liver damage
after eating contaminated dog food.
I haven't had any time to do anything but take care of her since Stewart and 19-year-old nursing student at the University of South Carolina.
She's the number one priority.
I get maybe four hours of sleep before she wakes me up.
Through read occasions from Army bases in Georgia, Oklahoma, Washington, and now South Carolina,
Coco has been a constant companion for Stewart, his father serving in Iraq.
When her own daughter died last year, Stewart said Coco helped her through her grief.
It was like she understood Stewart since she was my best friend.
Stewart's other dog, the two-year-old pet bull named Chulo, died last month,
just after hours after being diagnosed with liver failure.
It was only then the family learned of the recall.
I go to that company, I just played a brain job, you know, mess with my dogs too late now though.
Know what I'm saying?
What do you say?
I'm saying there's somebody mess with your dog that's in compil and lacks in whatever.
I would sue their ass and then shoot their ass or the other way around.
And set the dogs out of them.
That's right, well, kind of late now.
What do you miss most about your childhood?
This is a simulating pool.
We had a lot of really good stuff at the beginning and it kind of like Peter Doud.
Didn't it?
Well, I read it's horse maybe.
Maybe these people have crappy childhoods, who knows?
I did.
454, me too, pretty mediocre.
454, what do you miss most about your childhood?
Having no worries, 131.
No bills to pay, 50?
Playing sports, 50, 50, 50.

It's like winning the lottery, right?
Right.

Pinball machines.
Believing in God, my allowance, Solomente Uno, each has only one.
And throwing snowballs don't have any.
By the way, I was going to say, you can get yourself a pinball machine on eBay for 560 bucks.
Oh, I can afford that.
I just don't know where to put it.
I guess I could, I'm looking at the Batman Forever Pinball machine.
No, no, no.
The Colquidmans like this.
No, not for me.
I don't really care what, you know, about that.
And then never really interested in me, whatever these specifics of it, I don't forget it.
No, it's the challenge of like a Batman thing around, man.
Right?
Keep it, I think, going.
And then of course, all the nifty sounds, it makes them wait like skyrocket, salt around in there.
Gotta keep the ball up.
Exactly.
560, 7.
0560, pound 560 in a Verizon and singular wireless line.
WQYM, hello.
Hi, Neil, how are you?
Pretty good.
Okay, I got a suggestion for your poll.
Yes.
Being able to eat whatever you want and not think worried about it whatsoever, you know.
I'm a fat, all the sugar.
Yeah, all the crap we did to ourselves.
And now we think about it and we're like a suicidal.
Yeah.
Also, tomorrow's bull might be the opposite.
What did you hate most about childhood?
Like bullies and stuff like that?
Okay, that's good idea.
Well, I'm funny.
And lastly, Louie Anderson was fired from that show for a gay sex scandal.
No.
Yes, he was.
Oh my God.
He was in a hotel and he repeatedly was propositioning a room service kiddin.
Sounds like Tom Delewies now.
Yeah, it's exactly like that.
And the guy has to work since as a sad part.
Thank you.
Well, there you go.
Too bad he didn't know about that the bear back mountain movie could have been in that.
Yeah, he could have just wiped it out and said he could have been a helping hand.
Okay, thanks.
So I could have been a ranch hand.
He could play the horse.
Right.
Horses are.
Louie be a honey like that.
Now there's a little something we just learned.
Now what would he say before that for the pool about that one?
Oh, he had like a paragraph.
No, no, he had a suggestion being able to eat anything that you want to do.
That's right.
Okay, put that on it.
Eating whatever you want.
And don't miss a word.
Eating whatever you want.
And what about the other pool about what did you hate?
Have you done that?
No, but I was thinking about that.
Like what do you know?
What don't you miss about your childhood?
And I was thinking, okay, start right?
That's for Friday.
Yeah.
I can't believe we're so far ahead on pools.
We got ones for like May already.
All the way things are going.
You know, don't plan that far ahead.
Oh, now I think we can.
Now we can take a safe side of relief.
Right.
I'm serious, man.
It's like we've been given a, uh, I still say born again.
Should have a bunch of billboards all over town.
Born again QAM.
Given a second life.
After that nasty dark cloud we operate under all that time.
Mystery and suspicion and secrecy and paranoia.
I still say great read was the George Bush radio.
Consult my ass.
That's what he's doing by the way.
That's his new he's consulting my own.
Is it your ass?
Yeah.
It's a big subject.
WQA is him.
Hello.
Hey, you know, I got a question for you.
But three or four, I'd say the first time a new girl puts her head in your lab.
I'd say that's the best for a child of years.
I see.
Okay.
Okay.
And the question, I don't know if you can answer it or not.
But, um.
My wife watches that stupid ass show of the view.
Oh, I was shooting.
I just give her a little bit.
Well, she teethos it's on every night and I just go somewhere.
But nevertheless, she wanted to know star Jones has been gay or not.
I said I'd ask you if I can.
Well, she sure is hell is.
I don't mean your wife.
I mean star Jones.
No, I know.
I understand.
I just, you know, I said, well, if I call my mom asking,
he'd know I would know.
Let me look it up and I need directory right after a C.A.
Evander White's turn six.
Check your gate on.
Yeah, I'll check my door.
Okay, thanks.
Yeah, I would know.
I mean, if you're gay, obviously, you know who everybody in the world is gay.
First of all, if I ever saw star Jones again, it would be much too soon.
She is the lawyer of the view.
Oh, my God.
Is Mama Wallace still on that show?
She has a husband, you know.
Yeah, she makes canyons.
Really?
Yeah.
It's still her show technically.
She's like the other view.
She can't say it, but it's her show, the view.
I mean, it's like Tom Boko, you know.
All the other people in Don't Call On, Tom Boko, Barbara Walters,
V.E.
Oh, my God.
I'm a little bit scared.
I'm a little bit scared.
It's tremendous impediments that work.
People like that.
Rock solid.
Right.
Like Lenny Martez.
1256.
I wonder now that we got the new management.
How much more Lenny Martez we're going to be here in NWQM.
I'm looking at our schedule.
Oh, and I see Saturday.
Oh, and Sunday.
And Friday.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I said that.
Friday from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.
I guess any case going on vacation or away for the weekend or something.
And then 5 to 7 on Saturday and 2 to 4.
Like I said, now that we got a new regime, man, Lenny Martez is going to break out.
He's going to really mushroom into a gigantic star.
Anything?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
What you said.
Oh, boy.
Well, it takes a while.
You know, to correct some of these things.

The United Nations is about to speed-
Who cares?
Give me that crystal ball.
Second, he got up in the wrong size as a bunker.
Perhaps a poem will help.
Sadam, Sadam, you're one Wicked out dude and just like your oil, you're smelly and

Oh, you mean Rocky?
Sure, he's over there.

It's already on the way to Woken up in 24 hours.
Oh, right.
Thank you so kindly.
Pound will fear.

The post is probably not going to win it in like one flick of the thumb.
It would buy.
Ha ha ha ha.
Or lose a couple hundred.

Pound 5, 60, Elite Verizon and Singular.
Wireless line.
There's the Alito hearings going on.
And there's at the right winger.
You do a Supreme Court just on real.
Trials.
Trials of character necessary to serve well on this.
We're going to be better.
But I'll be out.
All this is just a just window dressing.
It was a dog and pony show.
70 Q.A.M. Hello.
The Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, I got a good one for you Paul.
It's the most obvious.
I've met everybody that works.
Missed.
Some of the cases.
I thought we put that under.
Yes, it's got the 24 votes.
We missed it, but it's on us somehow magically.
That's because I'm not reading all the other thing.
I thought I just got through reading it.
I'll do it again.
So sir, good time.
While those phones are building up to a crescendo,
you'll see not.

He just evidently was busy dialing in, don't you think?
That must be it.
Just like this one other call.
QAM, hello.
You have got to pick a nail.
Speaking.
Yeah, I just, uh, that's the sound noise you,
it's my sleeping mix getting pretty damn annoying already.
The what?
The noise.
The noise of what?
You mean, that noise?
Yeah, we're just the sound of the dial tone.
Yeah, 5.

What are we going to do?
We better go on satellite radio.
What are we going to do?
Hey, listen, we're high definition.
Maybe we're HD radio.
Nobody owns one yet.
But you just wait until somebody starts buying and will be dangerous.
I've seen one.
You've seen one.
But you know anybody who's got one?
No.
I've seen a few of the stuff has one.
The thought I want to hear about it.
It has an HD radio.
Yes.
And how do we sound an HD?
Oh, crystal queer.
No, seriously.
Does it sound different?
Yes.
It's clear.
It's clean.
And then it's gone.
We don't want to be too clean.
We'll lose the whole audience.
Somebody QYM?
Hello.
Yeah, I got one for the panel, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How about Turkey Twitch?
I agree.
But you know, cute.
And you know how fast.
Oh, yeah.
And like, and there he goes.
And there he goes.
And he does.
Mm-hmm.
Like that makes a difference.
If you see it real fast, that's right.
And then the 45 delay buttons we got.
They don't work if you see it real fast.
It's like a normal head time.
Oh, man.
Talk about it.
That poll we took the other day about stupid.
Trust me when I tell you.
WQAM, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How about that time?
I work about a 12 hour day and I'm telling you, man.
I miss the mandatory daytime nights.
Uh-huh.
A way to get to be as old as me then you'll get it back.
You don't have to wait.
Well, I grow up.
I want to be just like you.
Oh, god.
Don't say that.
Good luck to you, pal.
All right.
Good luck to you, man.
That time.
That's good.
All right.
Absolutely.
I don't remember taking that.
I mean, it's a little, little kid.
Yeah.
I don't remember that.
That's it.
He's reaching way back.
Well, maybe when he was like 10 years old, he was taking a nap.
I don't know.
Or crap.
5, 6, 7.
Don't say that.
There are joys.
It'll be all over us like stink on Greg, man.
WQAM, hello.
Hello.
Neil, I have a lot of trouble.
WQAM, hello.
Good luck to you, man.
Good luck to you, man.
Hi.
Yes.
I have something for Neil for the survey.
Okay.
What is that?
First kiss.
Either way, giving getting.
First kiss.
First kiss.
Okay.
Thanks.
The way he said that, it sounded like what the other person said.
He said first kiss.
Kiss.
He just had a little, you know.
Got my finger going.
There you go.
Just calm that finger down.
I'd stick it in the pencil sharpener while.
Sharpening up.
Real sharp.
You know.
That's a vampire.
He's having a sharp finger nails.
Aren't you always very suspicious of people with sharp finger nails?
Like, I'm suspicious of people with finger nails period.
Right.
Well, it checks you understand.
No, I'm talking about guys.
What kind of guys have finger nails?
Gay.
No, I don't think so.
I'm serious.
If you don't buy a finger or a coke beans, you must have a really little recipe.
You'll have to go if you don't buy your nails.
I mean, that's part of the, that's part of the wonders of having them grow back.
Is that they're there for you to bite off again?
I don't bite my nails anymore.
I do something else instead.
I see.
I don't know if somebody don't have time to bite his nails because you're afraid that someone
would go to the finger burrs might be under him.
All alone.
Somebody cue I am.
Hello.
Where the pole pizza parties just asked Mo, that was his favorite event.
Pizza parties.
Okay, like it.
What's that little pizza place?
What is it called?
Chucky cheese.
Chucky cheese, please.
Hey daddy, take me to Chucky cheese, please.
It's okay to go inside, boy, I wish I'd thought of that.
What?
That whole Chucky cheese thing.
A place where the food doesn't make the difference what it is and just plays through.
Yeah.
You've got your kids run wild and they serve beer and wine for the adults to get loaded
while the kids ride.
Right, right.
They just go absolutely, eight-smit, right?
Perfect.
Somebody cue I am.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
I've got an item that's at your pole.
Yes, it's Philippine.
Hebrew school.
Hebrew school.
I miss it like a tumor, man.
Mopletop.
Okay, and the happy circus.
How do you like that from some old Jew?
I mean, some old guy, Goy.
We put that other?
Why not Hebrew school?
There would be about the 10 of us Jews.
I don't miss it.
What's there to miss about Hebrew school?
All those old Giskees in there?
It's all that.
I miss that neat little schmata on my head.
See, that's the one thing when you're out Orthodox, you can wear the schmata on your head like it's like on your bar mitzvah
or a couple of occasions, but other than that, the schmit can.
I think it's the word we're just to cover the doll's spot.
In fact, I never wore another one until it was a whanny day.
Oh, those were glorious days, weren't they?
Yeah.
Thank you so much, Marvin, for all of you.
You're a good close personal friend.
And all our good friends at whanny.
Right.
Who's the fact that was a head of that thing?
Nighty Lusham.
No, no, I'm talking about the big cheese.
Oh, very dillard.
Very dillard.
Hey, very.
You fairy.
Nice eliteration there.
Rhymes in the chimes, etc.
And two times.
So Louis B. Anderson got knocked off at that family few because he was doing a little...
Yeah, thank you, Panky.
Soliciting people.
I never would have felt good.
You were...what does that mean?
Oh, you mean that people can be gay too?
Haha, I just asked Dom Delewies and James Coco, they'll tell you.
Although Dom Delewies has a wife, you know.
Does it?
Name is Sam.
WDQ way and hello.
Aquemino?
Yes.
I have one for your pull and I give a shout out to George too.
Okay.
Put on their marching bands.
Marching bands?
Yes!
Like, you never watching them.
Yes, for all the band he's out there.
But is that like his playing in them or we're just watching them?
No, playing in them.
I'll be damned.
You didn't play the tuba, did you?
Oh, no, no, no.
Melph on a lot cooler.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Marching bands.
There we go with them.
Oh, man.
Which one?
Lionel Tate's the pizza shooter burglar.
And what's the other one's name?
Uh-oh-oh.
From Palm Beach.
Right.
You want to try the teacher?
Huh?
Don't take.
Don't like.
Oh, man.
Not Cecil Collins.
Cecil was the peepin guy.
How's the peepin Tommy?
How's the peepin Tommy?
They don't come to me.
That fellow Seymour Hoffman here is so good.
He was so great.
He was so great as Freddie in that movie.
And I actually have like a little sports car there in Rome.
It's so unusual because almost everybody drives those little tiny cars
that are about to size your thumb, you know?
Or those scooters.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
That was best for us.
Oh, those best for us.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But never do you could be John Wade on one of those things and you'd still look.
Yeah.
I see.
Like Matt Dillon, you mean?
Right.
I, uh, I got a confess.
I've been like back and forth and tossing around in my head.
And I like Matt Dillon.
Oh, I got no problems with it.
Yeah.
No, I'm not saying the way you do.
I just, he's okay.
Although I'll tell you one thing in that movie, he looked awfully pasty.
He could've used a good suntan.
Remember the scene on the beach there?
Would you jump there, law?
Would you jump there?
Yeah, well, they were all pretty.
He had law.
Right.
He had hurt, hurt, hurt.
They were all hurt and Jude Law.
He had hurt, Jude Hurt, right?
It's worth it.
Sonny Hurt.
I beg your pardon?
Or they all like pasty brits in that movie?
Oh, and you'll, when you watch this movie, the primal fear, you'll notice that the archbishop has breast like a woman.
Oh, yeah.
Because before he finally gets murdered there, he's like running around almost naked, shaving or whatever he's doing.
And, uh, man, oh man.
Talk about saggy.
That dude.
WQAM, hello.
Oh, Daniel.
Yes, sir.
I miss my erections.
Well, we have on every four years, at least we used to.
What?
That's what they say.
We have four years.
It's old for that, you know.
Right.
Don't start.
Okay.
Don't start.
He started.

This is New Rogers. This is 5-16-Q-A-L.
The Miami Heat Show featuring Pat Riley, Randy Fond and all Miami Heat players is on one city.
This station presented by Ficus Suki recording game tune in tomorrow at 8.30 with Hayden and the Miami Heat Show exclusively on sports radio 5.16.Q-A-M.
It's time to get it on.
He wants to bomb all of my land.
Absolutely.
Go to battle.
That is his plan.
I think maybe he'll come once or two.
I see the president's point of view.
Sometimes soon he's going to do it.
Sometimes soon a rock will be hit.
When his beef is deep to drop by then I'll know he's not one to lie.
He friggin hates me.
Bush he friggin hates me.
La la la la.
He must be thinking we got weapons of my destruction but we got none.
Aboga rape.
Is there anything Dumber in the history of my life than Jack as Jack named?
He hate me.
I have to think about that.
That's a good poem.
I'm not just names but just dumb things.
A great hit comes to mind.
He hate me.
One 17 at Q-A-M.
Bush crash.
North of Toronto is in dozens of people including one seriously.
Today a Bush crash.
I'm starting to talk like Dave Strader and Eric Reed.
The driver was bad.
When he was ejected to the front windshield and crashed with a minivan in Caledon.
I have no idea where there is.
Most of the senior citizens of the other guy were only moderate to minor injuries.
You also have to listen to the Lord.
The bus was traveling from Kitchener to Casino Ramma.
Oh boy.
I would take them if they didn't just go out of woodbind.
They didn't like a rubber glove.
They didn't like it.
They shut the web to Casino Ramma.
Way up there.
He buried.
You buried.
So it'll teach them.
I think Hank is wrong about that.
I think a lot of people who were nearly would go to Vegas maybe a few times a year.
Maybe they'll still go maybe once or twice.
But I think some of them would like to cut way down on all the airfare in a hotel.
Because by the time you get through a pain of the airfare in a hotel,
you're already so far in a hole.
You know what I'm saying?
That's like a whole weekend's worth of getting here.
If you just go up to Pomfett or Regalstream or Danya Highlight or what's the other one?
Or Hollywood Greyhound.
You can just go over there and plunge all you want.
Unless of course you're one of those people who doesn't play slots like Josh.
Now let's see if they got at the end of course the Indians pretty soon they're going to have like that.
You watch within a year I'm predicting.
Class three gaming that have the tables.
They'll have your craps and your Blackjack and all of these things.
So who the hell will need to go to Vegas?
I don't know.
I just, I mean, if Vegas is fun and it's exciting the first hundred times.
People are low-pingles who'll go there.
People that want to see those shows, things like that.
I mean they have.
But I don't go to the shows and quite frankly those big buffets.
I don't need anymore of that to kill myself with.
So you know, in addition to what just about anywhere you go there's food.
You know what I mean?
Really?
Yeah. I know that comes in a great shock.
But people that go to Vegas for food I think need serious assistance.
It's just that not that there's not great food there because they're sure as hell is but nevertheless.
In addition to what, see I've never been able to understand.
People like, oh yeah for $6.99 you can get a primary dinner.
And then they go on a casino and lose 15 grand.
You know what I mean?
I don't understand it.
You see what I'm saying?
Right, yeah.
It's like a woodbind.
You get your points on your player card and they give you like a free lunch or a free dinner.
Big thinking deal.
Okay, first of all the food I wouldn't feed to a dead dog number one.
And number two, if you're losing another two three grand, what the, what a free for two grand?
Right, right.
Don't mix a feel bad.
I'd like to have a business like that.
Here I'm going to give you something for free.
Give me two or three grand.
You could have a business like that.
Doing what?
Or any establishment of those kinds.
I see.
All in all those establishments by the way in Broward where they were like having those phony gamming,
those scans us.
We already had a store on it.
I think a week or two ago.
They're trying to close those things down.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
Q-A-M.
Hey Neil.
George.
How you doing?
Okay, how are you doing?
All right.
Listen, you're pulled today.
You got some sort of a date cut off or something there like high school or junior high or whatever.
Whatever, whatever.
Whatever you consider your childhood.
Some of the people we talk to in case you have a notice, they're 40 and they're still children.
Well, you know, because I don't know all some of these guys are, but I kind of miss having sex with other condoms.
You know, nowadays if you're single, you can't do those things.
That's for danger unless you're going to get it.
Oh, not to mention, you know, when I was even younger, well as they would say today,
getting molested by my baby sitter.
You know what I mean?
We could put that on there.
Yeah.
Getting molested by my teacher, babysitter, priest, whatever.
Sex without a condom, that's good.
Well, if you were a child having sex without a condom.
Well, no, a child that he's talking about like teenage years.
That's what you thought about.
What?
I said, I know what he's talking about.
Well, how about like if you're five and you're having sex without a condom?
It's good enough for Pam Smart.
Oh, yeah, that picture's on there again the other night.
Yeah.
See, all new school teachers out there, we're going to fold them up with one of your students.
Take somebody at least look at them.
Oh, you know.
God, almighty.
They make the rest of us feel better.
And in fact, no, I take it back because actually that kid was a pretty grotesque but the one up in Seattle.
What was her name?
Mary Kay LaTerno.
Mary Kay LaTerno, that's the one.
Oh, my God.
The deep blue.
When did that spaceship land, huh?
What, what was that thing?
Man.
No, I'm serious.
What the hell was it, Martian?
My God, is that thing real?
Cuban American community activists and politicians land based in the U.S. government decision to repatriate 15 Cubans picked up from the base of an abandoned bridge in the Florida Keys and urged officials to review the country's wet foot, dry foot policy.
I wonder if that foot that Vanna was showing under the 80 year old foot on the wheel of the squeal of fortune.
I wonder if that was a wet foot or a dry foot, wet foot.
It kind of looked like it.
Yeah, the wet foot, dry foot policy.
If you have a wet foot, you're going back.
And attorney for the families of the migrants said he planned a file lawsuit today asking a federal judge to allow the group to retire while a local activist
rather continue a three day hunger strike protesting the treatment of the Cubans.
They were Cubans.
Cubans and therefore they must come in.
We need lots more Cubans.
The migrants, including a two year old and a 13 year old, were sent back to Cuba Monday after U.S. officials concluded that the section of the partially collapsed bridge where they landed didn't count as dry land out of the government policy because it was no longer connected to any of the Keys.
That really is kind of stupid.
Yeah, though the whole policy is stupid to begin with.
I mean, you know, make up your mind.
Not that I want to come down and, you know, I'm the same side as some of those green teeth, the lunatics.
Through a legal review of the migrants were determined to be feet wet and processed feet wet and processed in accordance with standard procedure at Costa.
It's both from the Pente off as a Dana War, sent out a statement.
They were feet wet.
How do you like that?
Oh my God.
There's a Republican administration.
You want it so much.
U.S. Senator Mel Martini is Republican of Florida called the government's decision an example of the complete nutter failure.
Nothing was pandering.
You understand, of course.
The complete nutter failure of the wet foot dry foot policy, which generally allows Cubans to reach dry land to stay and those who don't want to be sent home without an immigration hearing.
How about if they get within like three miles, you know, something like that?
Okay.
Well, I mean, the wet foot dry foot is just so stupid.
No, it's incredible.
It's stupid.
Because they reached an old bridge and not a new bridge as a judgment, they didn't reach American soil.
He asked these semantics used to be churned these men and women who have reached so much to reach freedom and are returned to an uncertain future.
Our embarrassment, Martini, is being sent.
Meanwhile, of course, you know what would be long before she'd have her four cents in there.
That bitch.
U.S. Representative Eliana Rosanna-Dandalateman called the decision absurd.
If any cram would have been committed on that bridge, the perpetrators would have been arrested and charged with violating U.S. laws.
She said the statement.
Ross Laiton, spokesman Alex Cruz, said the congresswoman would continue to follow the case.
We didn't immediately know what further actions she would take.
She's too busy at the gay bars.
The group left Monton's province in Cuba later on the night of January, second abode a small homemade vote.
The migrants were rescued Wednesday morning by the Coast Guard from the base of the bridge, just south of Marathon Key.
Mercedes Hernandez Guerrero said she initially was elated to receive a call from her niece Elizabeth Hernandez, telling her that she had her last thing we need to say to anybody else in the name ends in a Z.
Or sorry George, no problem.
Telling her that she or her husband and their two-year-old son John Michael had reached the bridge, John Michael, I wonder if he's kind of Alan Michael I'm guiding light.
I said stay there, the currents are strong.
I thought I was giving them good advice or an end as we called.
But her joy to Nises arrival turned to concern as the days pass she heard nothing from the group.
At least it doesn't Cuban Americans protested the government's decision Monday outside freedom tower in downtown Miami.
Here we go again.
Ramon Sallal Sanchez, head of the democracy movement, a real smithist derby.
A Cuban American Embassy group will begin a hunger strike on Saturday to protest the federal government's treatment of the group.
Yesterday he wouldn't stop until President Bush agreed to meet with a commissioner leaders in the Cuban Ex-Occiminity about the arbitrary manner in which the wet foot drive foot policies being implemented.
I would like to let me ask you if a bump hit peed on the bridge and they would have touched the wet stop would that be an American soil?
Yes.
Wet foot.
All right. If they've stepped on it.
Sanchez said he's also considered about the coast guards figured it would allow those pick up a sea to contact their families rather being held on the agency's boats.
Vodom. People on both sides of the ocean think their family members have died.
Sanchez and others said they were especially shocked by the speed of the repatriation.
William Sanchez, an attorney for all those of the Cuban migrants who planned to file a motion asking for the group's return, said he was on his way to file an emergency injunction to halt the return when he learned they were already back in Cuba.
Too late.
You know that the coast guard's own website states that if immigrants touch US soil bridges, piers or rocks their feet are considered dry.
Sounds like something the bridge center would say.
Soil, bridges, piers or rocks.
Well, you better know your law, mister.
Right. Because they evidently sure don't because their feet are considered dry, I, I, I, I.
But Coast Guard Lieutenant Commander Chris O'Neill said these structures of the migrants landed on didn't fall into any of those categories.
The bridges kind of misnomer said O'Neill spoke to the department southeast region.
He said officials in Washington determined the Cubans should be considered feet wet because they weren't able to walk to land from where they landed.
See if they did just swam a little faster, you know what?
Damn it.
Well, the words were strong.
Like that, there we go.
You know, soon we'll come a little faster, man. Get those feet dry.
You wet, wet, wet, wet, back.
Now what is that? How come the Mexicans get called wet backs and the Cubans wet, wet feet?
I get that all the time.
Do you really?
Yeah, they don't know. I took a plane, but what definitely doesn't make?
Funny since past 1 a QA M and sleep. Oh, how are David and David and David and David and David.
No, no, no, no.
Big game show.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 5.62 A.M.
I think is how the thing see.
Yes.
That's your moon.
Keep going, we're going to hear now.
Oh, looks like the face of a rose guy.
Now, from the body roll ball, Barbara Bush had bought himself and I suppose I've raised my bow.
It happened when she realized she raised her friend in the crowd.
Now, Barbara Bush had bought himself and I.
Did she miss me?
Oh, then grabbed me and she raised for five six times.
She's a trustee and said, stop, Rick, no, I mean why?
You said they want some, boy.
What's like these Harry-chan unfolded ball between us?
I've been asked the body's melting ice.
She doesn't mean to fall off.
I've been asked these always to rise.
These women, these dogs.
Barbara Bush had called me down the night.
We gave us your toys and chess toys.
Not just that, it's just me.
Bob and Bush, we'll be friendship back.
And smell just like the magic stars.
I'm a big nut.
Barbara Bush, we've been those owners for nine.
I'm a fair day with Marty Dallop and I.
What I'm going to do is invite you to DVD.
It's a grand total of $9.97.
See, I just discovered that once you put, I already knew this, but I forgot about it.
Once you put your info in there, Amazon.com, you can do anything.
Just pick out whatever you want.
Look on a couple of things and it's on its way.
It means you and wherever.
It's fantastic.
So that's a good news with the tax and recampable shipping in every 9.97.
The bad news is it's being shipped tomorrow, but deliver January 17 to 19.
So next week, that's five out of eight.
A lot of times they say that and it shows up like that.
They do what it gives themselves a slime.
Give them a little cushion there, a little cushion.
So like in the next book, we're going to have a 20 share.
I mean, two.
We're going to have like a zero share in the next book.
Oh, that's across the street.
A talent has he judges recommended that state center Alex D.
As they La Portia pay 8,750 bucks for election law violations.
Reject the arguments that the Miami Republican is too impoverished to pay any fines.
Administrative law judge Jeff Clark ruled that the senator enjoys a remarkable lifestyle that goes beyond the nearly 30,000.
I'm sorry, man.
He said a salary that says he says his only income.
The fine stem from the as they La Portia is 99 election to the state Senate.
The center is wage is running legal battle over election law violations with the Florida elections commission,
which at one point tried to levier then record $311,000 fine for 311 violations.
The as they La Portia contended that lobby is sitting on the commission were seeking revenge because he voted against their clients,
a charge denied by commission members.
Now the case heads back to the commission for a final decision.
The panel can accept the judges recommendation or the senator pays much as 17 grand for the 17 election law violations
that remain after an appeal score throughout the other charges again.
If he's unhappy with the commission's next decision, the as they La Portia could take the case back to an appeal score.
Noting that the commission staff saw an $800,000 fine against him five years ago, the senator called the judge's decision a major victory.
I feel vindicated said the as they La Portia, who added he didn't know whether he'll appeal again.
The shows that the Florida elections commission tried to make a mountain out of a mole hill, he said.
The as they La Portia and his lawyers had argued that the center should pay nothing for the remaining 17 violations saying that most of them were technical.
The as they La Portia also argued he couldn't afford to pay the fines, but Clark, citing documents and testimony provided during hearing's last year disagreed,
the as they La Portia's personal living expenses exceed his income, Clark wrote.
No reasonable explanation been offered for his ability to maintain this lifestyle.
The as they La Portia's net worth will allow him to pay any fine appropriate for the 17 violations of law.
Where's the money coming from, Alex?
Inquiry minds want to know where's all that cash coming from?
Maybe he's lucky it's a track.
That's it.
That could be it.
Vom found at Starbucks disarm.
Remember I told you about this and you said what?
What?
San Francisco an explosive device was found in a Starbucks coffee shop in central San Francisco yesterday.
The building was evacuated and a police bomb squad disarm the device authority said.
Unabomba, Puccinia.
A Starbucks employee found the device at about 115, 450 in our time yesterday afternoon on the coffee shop's bathroom floor.
Ever drop a bomb on the bathroom floor in a Starbucks?
No, I got good aim.
If it had detonated it would have caused damage.
It was what we consider an IED and improvised that explosive device.
That's what's called was people over there.
I wrecked those IED's AMN.
The device was not concealed.
He said, this is a police spokesman, Neville Gittens, wouldn't describe the explosives appearance.
Officers said, maybe it was like that to a yard turd.
Maybe it was as long as his arm.
Officers told CNN that police were called to investigate a metal flash line.
Determine was an explosive.
The Starbucks employee found the device told authorities and the building was evacuated along with apartments above the coffee shop.
He said a bomb squad team removed the device about 2pm and detonated in a control explosion outside the building.
The bathroom is kept locked and anyone who entered it would have needed a key from a stirrup floor who were excessive.
I was sure I had to receive any threats before I could respond to it.
Like that, they opened again this morning on their back, it didn't seem usual.
So what do you like about her?
Starbucks or Tim Hortons?
I've never had the pleasure.
Tim Hortons.
And what's the other one?
There's another chain.
And there's a coffee shop on every street corner here, every place you go.
Oh, I can't think of any of them.
Well, let's hold that.
You want to hold it over the damn place.
What do you miss most about your childhood that's our poll today?
A fantastic poll question where most of your answers have dried up a couple hours ago.
But that's all right.

He lost you, lost me, lost you.

Thank you, sir.
And honestly, left me speechless.
I knew.
The bad street boys.
The bad street boys.
I knew.
You don't ever mind me having Todd Breck.
And his performance yesterday morning.
Oh, really?
Yeah, I see a similarities there.
In other words, okay.
Do whatever you want.
Just go away.
Oh no.
But I mean, but I'm hoping you don't want to say anything.
And you weren't even able to see the dancing.
I'm sure.
There's a dance that goes on.
I, I seen it.
I've seen it.
I've got another good one for the pull.
That's going to get a lot of votes.
Okay.
What do you miss most about your childhood?
Nothing.
It sucked.
Oh, there you go.
We didn't forget that you made that choice.
I was probably looking for a place to go.
A lot of people out there had terrible childhood.
A childhood.
But I thought you were.
You guys would say childhood.
Right.
I'll set you a facts with a very good suggestion on there.
No, I didn't get it.
Oh, it's right there now.
No, it's not.
Okay.
Is it coming?
It's covered.
I don't hear the machine even yawning.
You know that yawning sound machine makes me out.
I don't hear it doing nothing.
Is really from the minister, Ariel Sherone, recovering from a major stroke,
moved his left hand and his right hand and right leg with more strength than before.
He's doctor sitting there.
You know what they got?
How they got him to move his hand?
I give up.
Because it's almost a poor him and they had a tray of humontation and they held it about two feet away from the bedside.
And all of a sudden he was reaching out and touching it.
Movement of his left hand is significant because the left hand is controlled by the right side of his brain,
which was damaged by the stroke.
He suffered January 4.
There was no immediate danger to the prime minister's life set.
His anesthesiologist, Dr. Yoram Weiss, metaphorically speaking,
were right on the edge of the cliff.
We were right on the edge.
Now we're five meters back, 15 feet.
I like that.
Next I do his right on the edge and now he's a few feet back.
That fascinating coming by the way you might want to like rescind her.
No, I had to cancel the facts that was coming through.
Somebody is sending us the cover page of your webpage on the facts machine.
And what does that mean?
I don't know.
I don't know why, but somebody's faxing the image of the front page of eelwadgers.com.
Right.
And I hear something on my image.
I'm just sure that beat that the **** like that.
There you go.
God is out of sighting.
American troops in Baghdad yesterday blasted away in the home of an Iraqi journalist
looking for the Guardian and Channel 4 in England firing bullets into the bedroom where he was
sleeping with the wife and children.
Ali Fadhil, who two months ago won the Foreign Press Association Young Journalist of the
Year Award, was hooded and taken for questioning.
He was released.
I was like, hooded.
How do you like that?
Right.
You know, the depth of hood.
He was one of the boys with the hood.
Dr. Fadhil is working with Guardian films on an investigation for Channel 4's
despac's program and it claims that tens of millions of dollars worth of Iraqi punts
held by the Americans of British have been misused or misappropriated.
How do you like that?
Must be just a coincidence they inked him off with a hood.
Boy, the troops told Dr. Fadhil that we're looking for an Iraqi insurgent and seized video tapes
he had shot for the program.
These have not yet been returned.
The director of the film said yesterday that timing and nature of this raid is extremely
disturbing.
It's only a few days since we first approached U.S. authorities and told them, Ali was doing
this investigation and asked them to then grant interview about our findings.
We made a convincing assurance from the American authorities that this terrifying new experience
was not harassment and a crude attempt to discourage his investigation.
Dr. Fadhil was asleep with his wife, the three-year-old daughter Seren, seven months old son
Adam when the troops forced their way in.
They acquired into the bedroom where we were sleeping.
Then three soldiers came in.
They rolled me out of the floor and tied my hands.
When I tried to ask them what they were looking for they just told me to shut up.
I liked that.
Who shut up?
Right.
Excellent.
I said this question and said he was investing in a lot of misappropriated crap.
Here's the facts from Jose, who says, I have a great one for the pull.
If I have not already been taken, I misreturned coke and other solar bottles for money.
I think this is number one.
I'm not a word, but it's a good choice.
I'm trying to get rid of my name and the bottom of it says Jose.
I don't understand that, do you?
I may be trying to say pseudo name.
Oh.
No, it's not going to be number one.
No, but it's a good one.
I used to do that.
Returning soda bottles for money.
For deposit, sure.
Oh, there's a lot of adults doing that now.
Going through the density dumpsters.
That's the only way I ate.
Really?
Well, that in school lunches.
I see.
I was told, four of George, one of these days, maybe on Monday when I'm off for the holiday
for the Martin Luther King Day.
Maybe Monday, you can tell the story of your childhood.
Yeah, maybe.
At least the non-excerated parts before you went to Montana and started like, you know.
What I would cash those bottles in, guess where we would take the money for a food?
Probably liquor store.
Right next door to Royal Castle.
Really?
Well, you could get a full meal, which is like that.
Well, what a concept, man.
Speaking of Royal Castle, how's Wayne doing?
It's already the 10th of February.
I'm sure he'll be letting us know.
I'm sure Wayne will be right on top of things.
Well, it's going to be great when he's the open sun as little neatly burgers.
And then Rochester White Hots, which is a hint for the poll for tomorrow.
Well, I like to poll tomorrow.
Is it one of those food polls?
Oh, yeah.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
Amy, I got two propositions for your poll.
First might live, and second might aim it.
That was cute.
I'm not cute.
What happened to this thing?
I got two sets of reps.
Great.
Somebody Q-A-M, hello?
Hi, is it George?
Yes.
Hey, George.
No, I just sent that back.
I wanted to clarify that.
What it was was I owned a company in Thunder Jose, mind if I'm lying.
I owned a company that doesn't know how to be.
It's like medical scopes that go everywhere, if you know what I mean.
Well, I've had that.
I've had both ends, yeah.
Yeah, so no, I just wanted to clarify that up.
I didn't think it would go through, but you know, I wanted to get that back soon.
I want to clean off that shoe.
You're good when you don't want to do that procedure.
What?
Hell yeah.
Oh, they have to be cleaned before we even, you know, get them in our hands, so to speak.
I would think so.
Okay, thanks a lot, Brian.
Oh, whatever name you're going by this week.
How do you like that?
Maybe that's what the Jose comes from.
Like, give him the Jose.
Hey, Hozer.
Not me, him.
Governor Kathleen Blanco left for Holland yesterday to learn how the desk created the huge club control system.
That protects the land much farther below C-level and Louisiana.
The trip means the Democratic Governoral Miss President pushes visit to New Orleans,
scheduled for Thursday.
I'm sure it's not an out of coincidence.
Lico said a trip in Launville, and scheduled when the White House informed her about the president's trip to Louisiana.
The governor was among more than 40 government business and education leaders, including senators David Vitter and Mary Landrou,
who took the trip in hopes of learning how to create levies and floodgates strong enough with stand-to-storm as large as or larger than Katrina,
which overwhelmed New Orleans flood control system.
What I'm gathering is that we have a lot to learn how to make levies that hold up under difficult conditions.
Like Hozer, I believe it'll be a very valuable trip.
Landrou, who organized the trip, said she spoke with Dutch ambassador to the U.S. after Katrina broke New Orleans flood walls in levies.
Landrou said the ambassador told her about that country's flood of 53 when 1800 people died.
He said, might I just all come over and see what we've done since then?
And spoke a big fat one.
Katrina's been blamed for more than 13.
Let me say it again. Go for the answer then.
Let's just go there once.
Just go there once.
I mean, you guys want to go and you'll go there once and say, oh, this is really great.
Okay.
If I go into Boston, if you went to Boston now, you'd say, hey, this is really great, but it's not.
Yeah, once upon a time it was.
It's like if you went to like Rochester, you'd say, this is really suck.
This is Neil Rogers.
And you see this.
It's 5.16.18.
George, we're waiting always running you boy.
You're here.
Oh, what is this?
Oh, you can get a little piece of quiet.
I don't know.
I really got no one here and I don't know.
When I wake up, I pull my open, and grab something like honey, even.
That's for you.
You're fair, you're forcing me to do this.
Thanks.
I'll buy the nice Hawaiian punch.
Sure.
Yeah.
Oh, boy, boy, boy.
Oh, boy, boy.
Oh, boy, boy.
Oh, boy, boy.

Okay, I'll see another quarter to do someday this week, but maybe Friday, what did you
hate most about your childhood as the offshoot of this one that you say?
Okay, that's what the caller said and I concur.
