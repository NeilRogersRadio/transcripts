Tommy Tommy whose voice we just heard Tommy you know production time. Oh yeah he
farted who farted that shot. So for our poll today might get your input since
you're the maven when there's that echo again boy this is getting really
over that's thinking as echo anyway who is the greatest baseball player of all
time the reason I took the poll is because Josh Cordis continues to insist that
very bonds is the greatest player of all time which I find most amusing and so
much of the audience so far we got about almost 500 votes and he's near the
bottom I thought Willie Mays was the best player I saw well so far he's
through we got Babe Ruth actually second I never saw Babe Ruth yeah you did as a
child no never saw him come over Babe Ruth 1948 when he had the lung cancer oh
yeah but he wasn't playing then no he wasn't playing too well yeah that's
another point how can how can punks you don't even know who these other people are
can they make a judgment I saw Ty Cobb I saw Christy Matyson where in my
dreams yeah Ted Williams Hank Aaron Mickey Mandel Pete Rose Joe Demazio they're
all above very bonds Lou Gehrig is below him which I find very demeaning and
that's because they don't know Lou Gehrig well Lou Gehrig probably wasn't as
great an all-around player as bonds hmm bonds was a terrific field at two when
he was high-carb is a balloon and Roberto Clemente we just put on there he was
great but I think it was yeah for bro Clemente was great yes he was he was
he was a brideweezer but he was pretty good you used to follow the pirates
in you very religiously yeah Vernon Law the Deacon oh yeah Freddie Green
Elroy face Maz Dick Stewart Dr. Strange Glove Rocky Nelson Smokey Burgess
Geosom Moli Bob Skinner Bill Hurden I mean keep going I could go with
and call the great Kent the Colvey's good big grote Don Hogue they don't how
you doing he's don't seem no more the grow went to Duke they really well nobody's
perfect how's Duke doing in that final four oh I had LSU over them I'm okay well
that's bad boy that's really bad you put the canary on your own team that's
really nasty it was money anything for a buck that's right anything for a
buck you got that right now spirit no spirit no team spirit Rob Ross
this boom Bob now this crap about George Mason who cares I think it's great what
is George Mason anyway what is that what is it when I worked in Albee in
Michigan W.A.L.M. in 1966 five my program director his real name was
Derwood Karin but is on the your name was George Paul Mason I worked for a guy
named Glenn Mason that's about as far from Derwood Karin George Paul Mason and
the most the most he was a big fat old guy what a typical radio drift your kind
of guy you know and the thing I remember most is one day I'm playing the news
open and all of a sudden Derwood used to do the news he comes waddling down
the stairs and he had just been taking a big doose and the pulling his pants up
as he's coming down the stairs they go in and do the news it was he had a
seat to believe it I just did not have seen it yeah you're right nice pretty
nice vivid description yeah it's not a pretty sight yeah so how was your weekend
my weekend was okay my was awful was it really well I was in far and I didn't
go gamble any money away I would I wouldn't gamble even believe it or not I
was in Florence Kentucky and I did the you know Lane's oh yeah like you you
get you when you open up the book in the hotel and it has a list of houses of
worship yeah and none of them have a bet something before it right yeah you know
you're in hostile territories I bet you didn't have a list of delis on it no no
but it wasn't just that it was I did the lanes and stakes and it was so cold
there and snowy and just snowy yeah yeah in Florence Kentucky we haven't had a
snow here in ages in fact this way spring is here double digits everything was
there was in a low 30s and snowy today oh brother I don't know what's going on fact
they had an auto racing event there and it was snowing but I wasn't there I
was in Florence Kentucky right across the river from Cincinnati matter Frank
let's say Thursday we got 58 coming in Friday a 61 yeah it's supposed to warm up
there by next weekend but that doesn't do me any good stand out there in the
snow and the worst part not so much when you're doing the show but when you're
out there rehearsing and you're standing around that's the worst fan I saw
yeah at least when you're doing the show it takes your mind off how cold you are
but anyway it's over with no that's good you won't have to be going back to
my next trip I'm going to Las Vegas this weekend let's see this more was the
yesterday morning not this morning yesterday morning I wake up early and turn
on the racing network and there's racing from Dubai was the yesterday Saturday
Saturday Saturday morning I thought to myself what I'm ragheads man maybe it
makes me very angry because they take it over basically the whole third
but of course industry as you know because they got all the all the top
forces because they got the money our money yeah I didn't ran it ran me like
when we were fighting the Gulf War one I didn't go to that event all those big
hot shots from Kuwait you know while we are our people over there fighting
putting their lives online to get their country back and they were over there
on the French Riviera all the visco is getting stoned off their ass and
leave the way I just having a good party today's herald editorial page
ragheads yes had letters to the editor written by four women and they sounded
identical like they were out of the same click you know that a Robert
Greeper goes throughout all the letters probably in a spare time like the
weapons of mass destruction disruption we keep saying that there were none but
they really were and that Saddam hid them in some place yeah well no you're
right Robert Greeper would have written that because he is a weapon of mass
destruction him and that entire programming department I'm telling you every
letter was written by the same person I'm sure of it right now what people
was this in today's heralded by the way your boy we had some mistakes in
his story about the marons my boy what was that a Barry oh Barry Jackass and
what would that would be a first he made a mistake made a couple like what
what we're gonna hear a little bit are you gonna get the choice again oh well
I'll take my chances and get them all from the beast that we're not supposed to
talk about the here I checked on that we're okay with that I see that was the
old sales manager put that out there because he thought they were gonna
advertise yeah they do advertise and it's a making a difference yeah a lot of
tradeouts on here nice job there Chris he's doing it this new sales guy man he
is the best but anyway he wrote that the county was not going to was not gonna
put a ballot initiative out there for a stadium well if they got wrong about
that they're gonna be crazy to do that what's the difference if people vote don't
vote for it it's over with anyway yeah but anyway they are considering it the
second thing that he had there he wrote about how Major League Baseball could
have stepped up and contributed money to their stadium effort down here when
they were so when they were only 30 or 40 million dollars apart you know what
he forgot Major League Baseball already gave him 30 million dollars when they
moved here what dynasty did Barry bonds help create can you tell me answer that
question what dynasty yeah none I am I can't hear the big news you might be
excited about this since you're going to Vegas this weekend yeah right up your
alley did you see what beastly broadcast group is acquired for 17 million the
same company that can't pay their bills on time and don't want to give a
race to a Josh Cortes or give Georgia new contract but they could go on borrow
17 million so they could buy KDWN news and talk in Las Vegas they already have
two stations are there no this they have three this is their fourth station in
the market wow exciting yeah sounds like a place where you and I could retire
KDWN work like a deal to me yeah toss of course part of the deal we have to be
gambling X X number dollars gambling money exactly every week that would have to
be it sounds appealing yeah I can handle it so we'll say nice things about
choice today so we know I have to go to the U will I sure if I won't I'm not that
easy it's got maybe seven seven figures in it I might gambling number I've been
that's even dropped dead miserable hateful bitch this is something away this
this company at least it become consistent these last couple years they keep
putting the the stations in the hands of people that are totally inept that
haven't got any it's just like this triumphant we got now with you know
clearance and Robert and the beast it's it's it's it's part of the course how's
Joe Bell do you see him lately I've been away no that's right I wouldn't make any
difference but I'm here for three days let you know if I see him I see I'm
Thursday and Friday I'm looking at the schedule even though we still don't have
our two to four nailed down I see Thursday and Friday we're really throwing in
the towel gonna be on both days wow you mean this hour no two to four oh two to
four no you got bow in other words you don't even know who's filling in when
you're out there and you know something it's good idea I should ask that's
right that's exactly right now you got it now you have perfected the all the
whole thing oh I'm into that good screw it just pay me on pay exactly Georgia's
convince me that just pay me on pay you convince me that well I got to keep
trying to convince myself it's it's not an easy you know you're forgetting
you can't provide functions yeah you know you're a perfect example of do as I say not
as I do I'll tell you how bad I'm getting you know we got the Marlon and Metz
game tomorrow 1250 free game yeah so yesterday I spent about five minutes
looking up since naturally been I'm gonna give it to me I looked up the April
Marlon schedule regular season we got three games we got on the 12th and 13th
podrazer in town both games started at 105 and on the 19th the following wins
there we got a reds game at 1235 oh oh how do you like that wow that's how
lazy I'm good and I'm still even look ahead oh yeah I used to do that I mean
these people have tossed in the towel may in fact if you drive by our building
you'll see like the windows are open and they're all waving at white flag you
know that that's a cue and building to bring in any packages buyer picking up
any prizes or crap like that just look for the building where they are waving a
white towel out the window unbelievable and so who gives a crap if they don't
don't they leave them by the hell should we we're too old and feeble to be
one other waving white towels or are you looking to replay of the Dubai races
that could be it but your shmata heads then that's something Dubai it's on the
state department's list of countries that they recommend you not visit but
other than that the racing is great they uh oh they that's why I was in that's
why I was in Florence Kentucky this weekend mom sure that because I won't go
to Dubai you didn't see it Mike Batagia by chance did you yes I did a
tear-away park yeah he's a tracking answer I know he's the worst the worst in the
world I keep bringing that up only because I just can't believe that he can
keep a job anywhere just or horrendous I don't want to hear he's a nice guy
he's just horrendous he's a very nice guy he's a terrible terrible I don't
disagree with you but he is the world's worst and he just an embarrassment he's
like a county fairer race announcer from the old harness tracks and a little
like in Sturgis Michigan someplace like that and there they go okay
okay
now there's a second race from Windsor last night with my good friend Marty Adler
good Jewish boy well listen have a great day you two what do we got on we got
Curtis this afternoon that's at least that's something yeah I like Curtis Curtis
a good job I probably they're not going to give it to him I like him too because we
need to develop somebody new under the age of a hundred on this station but they
don't get that Panthers are at Boston tonight Panthers in a Bruins by the way the
elites are going to make the playoffs that's already a good done deal even though
they won last night that they're throw throw throw in them tell so if they're
not going to make it how are the Panthers who are now a point behind the
Leafs again they're not although they have a real soft schedule but they got
these three row games coming up they can't run it game on the road that's a
problem they're at the Bruins tonight who just fired their GM they're at the
penguins on Wednesday that's a game I'd be careful of what a Canadian's
tribe like hell to lose that game to the penguins last night they tried to
give it away and so did Leafs to do Jersey but anyway don't start with a
hockey talk that'll be the end of us it's your time no that's right time my
time now so I can I can take the wrap for that I'm a hockey maven all right Mike
in the maven well you have a good a good day a very good day one I see we got
Lenny Martez on tomorrow night 7 and 10 like I said they're waving the white
hankies remember it was the who was it with the white hankies is that
recweaver yes yeah yeah it was him with the white hankies Bob prints had the
green weenies and it was you talk about wikweaver wikweaver yeah that was the
guy wikweaver I remember him oh come on he was great oh I love it it wasn't
the nicest guy to ever yeah fans beginning to blow the blow the
blue the place election yeah for the ending got a little confused but
happens to the best of them but I heard have a great day you took a guy the
music expressed on the previous programs are those of the hosts guests and
collars and you're not with those who you like that group it's staffed
advertisers for agencies

Autumn
Who's the scienceologist that turned out to be a hypocrite?
Stop!
Everything!
Who is the dude that gets nibbled and they put down some food?
Stop!
Can you do it?
Who's the cat that's making fun of every other religion?
Stop!
Not only.
This issue is one brainwash mother.
Shit, I'm not.
I'm not about to share.
Then we can do it.
These are two things go hard.
But no one understands him, but I run hovers.
Yes.
He's doing an infomercial.
He's doing an infomercial.
I saw a hit to the 70s.
I saw it last night on the gambling channel.
He's doing an infomercial.
That's how much of a sell-out he is.
That's the case.
I'll screw him and Joyce.
Did you see that episode?
They played it over the weekend.
A couple of times.
What do you mean?
I see it.
What did they kill them on?
Oh no.
It's one to see.
I'll be damned.
How many times have you been waiting for the re-run of the Out of the Closet?
You're free.
I'm waiting for that.
Hold your breath.
I won it.
10-13.
Speaking of Closet case.
The American Revolution.
Oh, the American Revolution.
Here come the Indians are coming.
And the British are coming.
You all know the name Dry Concepts.
I'm sure because I've been talking about them for over 21 years.
That's how many years I've used them in my home.
In fact, they were in my house two weeks ago today.
And made my carpets look just like brand spanking.
And it's just like they'll do for you.
Before you go out and spend thousands of dollars to replace your carpeting no matter how hopeless
they may look right now.
Give Dry Concepts a call.
Tell Troy Stratford sent you by.
They will absolutely pee in their pants laughing.
And let Dry Concepts bring your carpets back to life.
When they finish with their fabulous job, they leave your carpets vibrant in color,
soft to the touch and stain-free.
Dry Concepts is the only company that I trust the only one you ought to be trusting too.
And just in case you weren't aware of it, I'm only going to do carpet cleaning.
And we also specialize in drapery cleaning, a polyestery cleaning, deep cleaning of your expensive leather furniture and much more too.
All of these...
Are you putting leather chairs?
Yes.
They might not have to.
And that's right, they might have to clean the chair and their red token is asked out of the tea room
and let your children go in there and do an ace doose in a trace.
And pretty soon it's going to be a cattorce if you don't cut the crap.
I mean, without a doubt, one of the best things you can do for your Oriental or Aria Rugs is use a quality underlayment.
Maybe that's what you need is an underlayment right now.
Like a flying carpet underneath you or just in case.
Shower carpet.
It's essential for a stentied life and beauty of your Aria Rugs and a quality underlayment provides critical cushioning and prevents skidding and hard floors.
Oh yeah, you might skid right down the hallway right to the tea room.
During this month, during March, kid 15% in savings on all underlayment padding from drapery concepts.
As you know by now, I hope.
Always professional, always on time and always give you a written guaranteed price upfront before they do their fabulous unbeatable job.
Carp reclaining water damage restoration petal or treatments, mattress cleanly gets sicker by those dust mites and lots more.
Call the best and trust the best.
Dry concepts call them tool free.
And they brought the Palm Beaches and tell them that twice strat for a toy did you call 1-800-248-5071.
That's 1-800-248-5071 around the web, dryconcepts.com.

Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, look, here comes Weird Harry.
Why are you calling me with that, Albert?

That's right, that Albert is like school on Thanksgiving.
School on Thanksgiving?
Uh-huh, no class.
World is what we learned today.
You see, if you are an African-American comedian,

It's an 19 at 560 WQM.
He's a real laprime, ain't he, huh?
No.
So, I just heard to make it back or what?
Make it back?
No, I never got into.
I went in there during the break, and they had reloaded.
Like, there's a whole new crowd in there.
Reloaded?
Apparently, a line hit point.
No, a couple of round words.
A little bit.
Apparently, a line hit point, because Brett took forever to get out of there.
So, unlike number 42 now in the building, waiting to get in there.
George is going to take a number 42.
That's how much I can't wait, too.
I can't wait to see exactly what that consists of.
Good Lord.
I think I'm going to run down these little, these bad bits.
Pimp.
I guess it makes it funnier the fact that they're supposed to be sound bad, and the drop-ins
are like,
Pimp.
Pimp.
Pimp.
Pimp.
Oh, it's tough off there.
It's tough off there for a Pimp.

You know, the joy set it's?
Pimp.
Oh, could he build out an ounce of sound or what?
They're wringled.
Pimp.
You know what I mean?
Let me play that again.
You know what I mean?
It's the S from Star.
They did these purposely, so sloppy that it's.
Pimp.
Oh, my kind of edits.
Here you go, Joyce.
Take those and shove more to Mundo and show him.

They lose her in the mountains somewhere.

What's going on?
With very bombed.
From sports, he was treated right to the devil.
Well, everybody saying I take roads.
You know, you just inspired me before you're coming about how everybody hates him, which is true.
But for a pool of water, I'm going to push tomorrow's pool back to a Wednesday.
Yeah.
I'm pushing things back.
I'm talking about Josh, not you.
Okay.
I'm pushing some things back, until tomorrow.
Okay.
So you're pushing them back in the next week.
Wow.
You sure going to have a whole inventory of stocked up there.
Take a keep busy.
A lot of material.
Wow.
In other words, you went back in there again.
Is that what you told me?
I went back and somebody's some different person.
Is there the same person?
Is all like...
What's going on there?
What is going on in here?
This is one of the great scandals of all time.
They're all lined up at the tea room and they're all on the throne.
No, I've got to say this.
The handy crapper is open, but I can't use that one because...
Oh, I like that one.
It's big in the bars, which is nice, but the seat sits too high.
Oh, that's right.
A little midget like you can.
You need to look like a step lighter to climb up on it.
I need to firm foothold.
I can't go over my feet or dangling.
Oh, well maybe somebody just holds you up above the right spot.
Maybe I'll take a stool with me.
No, anyway, Josh inspired me.
Don't you think that's a good pull?
Who's the most hated at?
And who's your most...
What athlete do you hate the most?
Josh, you think that's good?
He will win.
Very bonds?
Yes.
More than OJ?
Oh, I don't know.
That's a problem.
See, in other words, I wouldn't do the pull if it just to make great bonds look bad,
which he does a good job of themself.
But OJ, you think he can beat?
I think he can beat Rose?
No, he won't be.
He won't be.
He won't be.
Maybe Pete Rose will give him a run for the money.
Yeah.
Well, we'll do that tomorrow.
I like that pull.
Okay, anyway, the greatest baseball tire of all time.
That's the one for today.
Let's stick to the day first.
Okay, let's not get too far ahead.
Although George has been making a run to the head and they're doing much good.
644 votes.
Babe Ruth 130.
That was my vote.
That's what I told you on Friday before we took any of vote.
Baby Ruth.
Great pitcher, great hitter, great starter.
Not the fastest of foot.
But nevertheless, and I was back in the day of the dead ball.
I suppose the live ball, all this water down expansion, all these girls teams.
Babe Ruth 130.
I hate baseball 105.
Yeah, we figured.
Willie May is 82.
Say, hey, Willie.
I hate this pull.
69.
We hate.
Ted Williams 58.
The splendid splitter.
Hank Aaron 47.
Hammer and Hank.
Mickey Maddle 36.
PD Rose got 30, man.
$30 bills stacked up on the table.
They're at the track and they'll all be gone in about a half an hour.
Very bonds 26.
So he's in.
Let's see.
If you take off the eight, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven place.
Do it a magic or 24.
Just too behind.
But very bonds never had Marilyn Monroe.
Lou Gehrig 16, Thai Cobb 14, and Roberto Clemente 9.
I mean, the fact Thai Cobb's only got 14.
That's a time timeline thing.
See what I'm saying?
Yes.
Most people don't know from Thai Cobb.
There would no Thai Cobb and Kornama.
It's just a whole from Eddie Cobb.
What do you mean?
I'm saying, right, that's where we are right now.
And you're not doing so great, you're guy.
I didn't expect you to buy that book yet.
What are you shmerkling about?
You're waiting for me to send it to you, aren't you?
Why would I buy that book?
Because you're a big fan of very bonds and you know, if you had open mind.
If you want to hear the truth, if you want to hear the truth,
they'll set you free.
Who came?
My Georgia's waiting for the truth to send him free.
It doesn't matter.
The truth being that somebody finally vacated the tea room near me has got the green one.
You're going to have to send a scout before I bother walking over there.
I cannot believe.
This has been going on for an hour now.
Right.
That poor little Georgia's just been trying to make it for a couple of pounds lighter.
There's no light in there.
So, you know, like in the old building, in the old radio station,
you could be people who would sit in there and be all be all be all be.
What do you mean by that?
You mean, IOD?
You mean, you could be places you've been before have good lighting in the toilet.
Like in a real radio studio.
So, people sit and read all day.
Do you know that at INZ, Slice Zeta, some of us, some of us hot shots like me,
we used to get to use the executive tea room.
Ooh, which was right adjacent to the big, little mangoes orfers.
That's the one where that's snake on the floor.
Okay.
A little, a small, little snake.
Hey, listen.
How about joking?
I'll brave a python or a terrestrial or anything.
Well, what do you think, Rayan?
Like, look at that snake I'm sitting there on the throne.
I see this thing and it's a very, very small terrestrial by the way.
I thought, oh, it's getting a little crowded in here.
I think I'll evacuate.
A way.
New York Times obtained secret memo of Bush and Blair meeting me for our rack war.
Oh, we should take a call or two before we start heading into my big pile.
Then we got that Beasley story about the Beasley's who can't afford to give you guys an extra dime,
but they can afford to borrow 17 million to go and buy another radio station.
What about your clowns you people are over there, man?
Clowns.
But they keep paying me.
That's all I care about.
W.A.M. Hello.
I get work.
Yeah.
Oh, he should be under, though, shouldn't he?
As much as I hate golf.
I mean, that's a game.
It's not a sport.
But let's put them on their Tiger Woods, right?
Right.
Even a whistichoman.
W.A.M. Hello.
Q.A.M.
Hey, put this Pope robot on the list.
Put it on my ass.
Get out of here.
Probably got a Biff Poke Robo blow up doll.
I did like him a lot though.
The New York Times reports that a secret memo from January 2003 reveals the President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair.
Agreed to invade Iraq even without you and backing Ross story has learned.
There's that Ross story again, man.
The article written by Don Van Natt, a junior.
I wonder if he's kind of Don Irvine, junior.
Addresses of the January 31st, 2003 memorandum, which is linked to British author and reference in February of this year.
The New York Times was able to obtain a copy of the secret memo and confirms most of the reports.
Two senior British officials confirm the authenticity of the memo, but declined to talk further about it.
Sighting Brian's official Britain's official secret act, which makes it illegal for the violence classified information.
I was thinking of Brian Siria, I'm sorry.
Van Natt's article contains many quotations from the memo that haven't been previously disclosed and refers to it as striking in its character's characterization of Frank almost casual conversation by Bush and Blair about the most serious subjects.
Bush expected Iraq's army to fold very quickly and also told the Prime Minister that he thought the Republican Guard would be decimated by the bombing.
As for the future government of Iraq, people would find it very odd if we handed over to another dictator Blair as quoted as saying.
According to an article on the memo published by the Guardian in February, Mr. Bush made it clear the US intended to invade whether or not there was a second UN resolution,
and even if UN inspectors found no evidence of a band of Iraqi weapons program.
The diplomatic strategy had to be arranged around the military planning regarding a report on the Bush-Tool Blair.
The diplomatic strategy had to be arranged around the military planning.
The Prime Minister of said to have raised no objection.
He's quoted as saying he was solidly with the President ready to do whatever it took to disarm old Sodom and Gomorrah.
The memo also said to reveal that President Bush suggested flying YouTuber commissons aircraft planes with fighter cover over Iraq, painted in new and colors in order to provoke Saddam to shoot on them, therefore putting Iraq in breach of UN resolutions.
The memo was first obtained by Philip Sands, a professor of international law at a British University, and probably a distant relative of Tommy Sands, who had a teenage crush.
I like that.
The evidence is all there, but don't confuse the public with the facts.
Remember Tommy Sands' capital records, teenage crush? How about orange crush?
They still make that, don't they?
I think so, and it's a lot of places.
Orange crush?
I mean, I think they make sugar-free dammit.
They do make sugar-free Dr. Pepper, but not can't feed free.
I do like Dr. Pepper.
I think they make sugar-free crush.
They do?
I think so.
Well, I'll be damned. I'm going to go out and scout for it today.
You haven't got your pasta yet.
No, I haven't.
I'm trying to turn my life around.
It has turned my big fat ass around.
Wow.
It's right there.
Dreamfield's low-car pasta.
It's right above O.J. and the O.D.
The O.D.
I'm going to do it.
You should do it.
It's no different.
I mean, it's exactly the same.
I mean, look who you are.
I got no complaints from you guys.
I got no complaints from you guys.

You've been awake for 10 minutes and already you put fake vomit in the sink.
Fill the sugar bowl with salt, put plastic wrap over the toilet,
and bake doggy-do on the doorstep.
You arrive first at the office, unblogged everyone's computer monitor
and distribute a fake memo about switching from casual Fridays to bikini Fridays.
And don't forget your fart machine.
You found a good one with a motion sensor...
So the next time you thank you, I can escape him.
What do you, you, you, that superg路, with my microphone?
When I get on the step, I'm gonna hurt you down like a dog Mr. Overzealous.
To go to the jumper, a real American hero.
Mr. Overzealous, panic, go go go.
I don't know how, anyone?
Somebody help me please.
I mean, that's why Brett was in the team room so long.
He's putting the SRAN rap over the toilet seat.
Well, now George isn't trouble because he's in there.
All right.
Well, maybe he bring back AS Pesseman.
It's 10.45 at 5.60 p.m.
WQAM.
So here's the deal for $17 million.
Visley Broadcast Group has acquired news talk, KDWN,
from independent Broadcaster Radion of Adacorp.
The deal gives Visley its first A.M. in Vegas.
And it's fourth station in market number two,
32, one of the nation's fastest growing markets.
Oh, Vegas.
Visley intends to fund the purchase of KDWN
with borrowings under its existing credit facility.
Oh, God.
This acquisition broadens our presence in the fast growing
Las Vegas market and is consistent with our long-term strategy
to develop our clusters to their fullest potential.
Visley Chairman and CEO George Visley said,
oh yeah, you're developing my cluster.
I've said it that. It's called Roids.
The addition of KDWN improves an already great cluster
creating additional economies of scale while enabling us to provide more choices for our listeners
and any more robust platform for our advertisers.
Wow.
I expect to close early in quarter three this year.
So by the fall we ought to be in Vegas.
All right.
Isn't that the big improvement for you guys?
Yeah, what?
And with the big money Josh is making from that new deal.
So how was it in there?
I'm actually the only one who can put you in a coma.
Oh, yes!
Wow.
I didn't care.
I didn't care.
Well, I would imagine at this point you wouldn't care.
I feel like it was right a mile.
So the coast was finally clear.
Woo!
The coast was there in the highest.
And hour and a half of squeezing for good reason.
Oh, I forgot to mention right after that we usually do the dead celebrities red to beginning,
but who the hell knows Buck Owens.
Buck Owens co-host of televisions Heha.
Right.
And who shaped the side of country music with hits like Act Naturally is died.
He was 76.
He had more than 20 number one record.
Did you know that?
No.
But I'm sure that must be on the country chart.
Not like.
Yeah.
The cause of death wasn't immediately known Owens in the ground.
Stroke cancer.
Surgery in 93 was hospitalized with pneumonia in 97.
It sounds to me like a smoker.
I couldn't be wrong about that.
Sounds like a big smoker.
Probably.
The real Heha anything that I have in here says.
What is that?
The Heha Gospel quartet.
Oh, singing.
Wait a little longer.
Please be.
Oh yeah, wait a little longer please.
Oh, it's speaking.
But I was thinking of the 40.
Jesus.
Let me just make a little a center message along here on the air to my neighbor who keeps,
you know, Jesus.
There are no Jesus Christers in my house.
Okay, present past or future.
And they're not going to be.
So stop leaving religious books on my doorstep.
I'm going to tell you seriously.
This is what people, this is what pisses people off about the religious nuts.
That's right.
You just can't leave other people alone.
You want to believe any crappy one.
You want to put up that he has risen flag every other day.
Every other sookists, whatever you want, fine.
But leave in religious books on my doorstep.
They're get away.
Go away.
Can I have your answer arrested for trespassing?
You crazy people.
Anyway, Bucco and Square was one of the most phenomenal in country music with a string of more than 20.
Number one records most released in the mid 60s and mid 70s.
Well, I got to look that up.
Right.
Well, I'm sure that means number one in the country charts, not in the pop charts.
There's no way in the country charts have courses.
Course.
Of course.
But there's Roy Orbison, nice shades.
And the Osman.
So there's Regio and the Manhattan spiritual.
Well, I bet you don't have that.
That was a good song.
Two, it's two, 58.
Regio and.
Sorry, no.
In instrumental.
No, no, no.
Great record.
Who am I looking for?
Oh, Bucco ones.
Oh, it's a matter of fact.
He never had anything on the pop charts.
He had won the song.
It was number 25 in 1965.
We got a Tiger by the tail.
Bobbi was number one country.
It's for five weeks.
See?
All of his big hits were in country music.
No, it's picking redneck charts.
Yeah, nothing comes up on my computer.
Yeah, of course.
Hop.
Strictly crap.
His hits were recorded with a hockey-talk twang that came to be known throughout California.
The Bacus Field Sound, named for a town 100 miles north of LA, that owns called home.
The Bacus Field Sound.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I think the reason it was so well known and respected by younger generation of country musicians,
because he was an innovator and a rebel, said whoever this is.
Somebody, Jim Shaw, who played keyboards in Owens band.
The Bucca Rooz.
Oh, that's where I was Buccoons in the Bucca Rooz.
He did it out of the Nashville establishment, had a raw edge.
Oh, God.
Buccoons is dead and believe me, none too soon.
Who cares?
Oh, and how about that guy that got co-bound there at Homestead this weekend?
You see that?
Yes, I did.
Well, that is what it's all about, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Although it's going as round and round.
He had as fast as they can.
No, it's proud to see you.
Fire-recrapt.
It was a proud who was the only impractist.
I know that.
He had the decency to wait for that round.

Who has to go to work every day?
She said, is desk making clothes for Kathie Lee?
Loves the work but doesn't love the pain
They are the kids who make the clothing
They are the ones who make the bucket days of week-home planning
It's just clothes and making
The kind you love to buy is sure they make a bucket day with Kathie Lee
And there's everything so on, by the way, all this hoopla on all this carrying on around the country
Many people were protesting against the illegal war in Iraq and all these dead people
Then I'd say, hey, you go for it
But all these people that are running around carrying on
All they're doing is saying, hey, we're breaking the law
We're legally, we want to be legal
We want you to change the law so that illegal aliens can become...
That's what it's really all about
That's re-warred lawbreakers
That's right, let's re-warred people for like digging those tunnels and coming through your legal
So that all your big business can have a bunch of cheap labor
And maybe Americans would do those jobs if they offered them a decent wage
Maybe the Haitians would do it
There you go
I just said that for that kind of Haitian invasion
I had a Haitian fix a flat tire over the weekend
Nothing wrong with the Haitians, man
They saw them baseballs real tight so very bonds could hit some home runs
I'd tell you what he told me but we'd have to dump it
Oh, really?
Yeah
You don't have to do it like a blood clot?
No, I'm not that said you're making thing, I'm sorry
That's right
Well, some kind of a clot
Anyway, just look up, Ma, were you shut up?
Ma, did you know that Ma's makes...
Well, we knew three must-goot tears, right?
You know that Ma... See, Ma's was the family that invented this stuff that's killing us
They killed people for years with their addictive candy
M&Ms, did you know that Ma's made M&Ms?
No, I didn't
God, a wheeler needs some crap today
Man, you kids out there, this is as educational as it gets
You learn more on this show in a half an hour than you were in school in 15 years
What?
I belched
Oh, here they got a nicer website
Today Ma's is an 18, they ought to have, it's an $18 billion business
Oh, and speaking of that, our total on our fundraiser, $220,755
Ooh, wait, man, it's just pouring in by the dollar
I don't care
Good
Perhaps more surprisingly, unusual for business of our size, we're still privately owned
making us one of the largest small family businesses in the world that says here
And it goes on and on and on
And it's got a picture of... I can't tell what that other thing is
It's got a three must-goot tears bar
And I don't like three must-goot tears, kind of like mooshy
You know, not like mooshy candy
True, yeah, exactly, it's all with mooshy
You don't have anything exciting in it
That's right
As opposed to a Mars bar, now Mars bars when you put them in a freezer
Ooh, they got the shredded coconut, and I'm like crazy about that
Shredded coconut?
Don't think? Mars bars?
I don't like shredded, that shredded coconut
No, that's almond joy here
You better get with it, Mr. You don't need any meaty bars
I'm going to tell you the Mars dinners
I think they're going to call in here pretty soon
I want a second opinion
What? I think they both have shredded coconut
Let me say it again
Mars bars doesn't have any coconut
I'll tell you what, during the next break
I'll go across to the convenience store and I'll get one
Okay, that's good
I won't eat it, I don't want it
I don't want it
No, I don't want no candy bars
Here's a very amusing, this fact is very funny
And you want to know why, look at the header on it
Yeah, I know
Oh, it says Neil, although I know this is a chronic regular
So it's obviously a fake header, the whole thing is fake
Although there's no doubt that Barnes is a Hall of Fame player
Probably 200 of his home runs are tainted right now
Chances are he would have done 500-500 for a career
Great stats, but certainly not nearly the best ever
Certainly Willie May is my vote was truly the greatest player
No, I wouldn't say certainly, but they're your entire, that opinion
And Babe Ruth had more home runs than entire teams during the dead ball
Or a butt
Never faced blacks or his spanish, Babe Ruth
And then the header says the Vesquez family
Well, how's Hasinto doing?
Still having trouble finding the finish line?
Hasinto Vesquez my ass?
God
Now here's the, what is this thing? I'm supposed to be able to read this
This is a good, lucky, lucky, lucky
How are we good in this commentary?
Like I want to see?
Just throw it away
Yeah, I'm going to throw it away
Officials here, Robert Gack there
We were, we were, I've talked about this a long time ago
This is old news
This is old news about the way the state of Florida is punishing this guy
For trying to, you know, get the voting machine straight now, Ma'am
I am Sancio
How many stories did I have about this?
About third matter
You know, sending me this ancient crap
You people need to get with it
You're interesting and he might have some ancient crap
Not anymore, man
No, thank God
Whoo
From the Paleolithic age
Wow
I just buy that shocking to me
Because knowing the lay of the land there
And of course to show you
Maybe they're starting to lay down some real serious threats when that sales core, you know?
That could be, it was right after that sales meeting
Good, that's it, and they're all in there
And believe you me, those guys ought to be doing a green apple quick step right out the door
Twice strapped from near the front of the list by the way
Here's a guy inherited a bunch of accounts that have had on the year for years
And he is working selectively one by one to destroy them
And as far as service and account and copy, forget about not in his lingo
It's not in his lexicon
Is nobody's driving lexicon?
Oh, I don't forget if you drive a lexicon, you can park free at the Panthers starting July 1st at the Amacarina
But if you don't, it's going to cost you $100
The greatest baseball player of all time, we've got almost 800 votes already
This one is turning their fancy shmancy
How do you like that, Josh? We got the 758
I bet you got very bonds that are bad in the 758
Babe Ruth 157
Now have you ever seen like Clipskillm clips of Babe Ruth?
Yeah, I was in
A little bit tight and well aware of Babe Ruth
Actually, I don't know, he might have been tall, but he was a tub
He was tubby, yeah, he was fat
Yes, you are
He looked about as much like an athlete as a baseball player, Mickey Lola, you know, fat
He could play some, his fair share of positions though
Couldn't run, but why do you keep saying that?
He played, he was a pitcher and he played right field
I don't know, any other position the ever player than maybe prone
We might have played first, like, okay
No, I don't think so
I can't believe he played first place
He did with who?
I said he might have, a little bit
I can play first place
You know, you're starting to really frost my ass
Lightly frosted
And I'm not that think of a Babe Ruth fan, it's not like I was alive
You know, I'm even as anxious as I am, just a minute
I'm Googling, man, I'm Googling over here
Oh, yeah, don't worry
Baby Ruth, here we go
Let's see, the official Babe Ruth website, how do you like that?
Yeah, he did play first place also
He did? Yeah
Well, I mean, all these guys when they get to the end of the career when they're totally immobile
But he was never very immobile in the first place, they put him like a statue on first place
No, I mean, like in the middle
Kind of like where a mousse scour used to be
In Johnny May, you know, like 13 games
How about Johnny Mays?
Was he Chapliber or was Robert Johnny Mays?
Are you anti-Samanthic or something?
And what about Al Rosen speaking to Jewish ball players in Hank Greenberg?
And Bugsy Solomon
Who? I don't know
769 votes on there, and Barry Barnes is still sucking wind
In fact, Pete Rose passed him, Joe Demagio passed him
Look at Jolton Joe's got
I mentioned Marilyn Monroe's name, Jolton Joe got some more admiration there
Oh, Jolton Joe
Oh, we know it's not a crowd, it's listening to the crowd
Good, God, what does that mean?
It's another two-league-old party
To get the flow to this end today
I see, only old people
Okay, let's take a poll if you're under the age of Florida, how's that?
First of all, how to, like a 20-year-old guy
What does he know about great baseball players?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
He kept teasing before commercials
He was going to talk about the situation with my buddy Neil
And he still is my buddy
He said he ran something on your 20th and 25th anniversary
And there's nothing left to say
And then an anniversary is not an entitlement to get you name in the newspaper
Oh, I see, I guess the Harold must not feel that way
Not an entitlement to get you name in the paper?
Well, what is that?
So in other words, he had to put it all up after he wrote the big pieces on the 20th and 25th anniversary
I see, that's it
Well, you know, it's for you Tom
He also said it gals me that Neil says I get paid to do this show
I don't care whether I don't give a crap what you get paid or not
As if anyone would pay to put a monster's the factor but I digress
He says that would be a conflict of interest
They never take money even when he does other radio shows on other stations
And it isn't right about any cave because they, um, what?
They shower together
He also said to ask you if you once said that reading on the air was boring
And that polls were weak
Mike and Mel Boy
Yeah, reading on the air is boring on us on the one it's doing it
And polls are weak and less word on ones are doing
I like that Tom
I got news for you
There's more entertainment in the first five minutes
And just during the crossover with Hank every day
There's more entertainment than any 400-year comms put together
How do you like that?
Speak it a week
Speaking of boring
Just just Google Tom Jic on a SunCentral thing
There, you just go on a SunCentral website and Google Tom Jic and
And look at the last 50 comms and see if everyone is in another puff piece
Another one of our standard puff pieces about some stupid ass network TV show
All the same, not one line
Forget about me, how about the other people that worked their ass off in his business for years and years?
Nothing, Zipety Duda, Tommy
To matter of fact, I'm going to place something on or him
Oh, I'm dreaming of a...
You know?
Yeah
See, there's more humor in there than any of Tom Jic's 4000 comms put together
Plus their Q and A on Sunday
We finally had to admit that he got the information wrong about Greg butel last Sunday
And about the fact that he got an email from Greg and he's not an Alabama
Or he's still an Alabama, what a banjo on his knee and he's also on 640, whatever that is
Oh God, just unbelievable
It's one o'clock in the morning when there's nobody awake and he's on you ripping me and I go ahead and Tom have a good time
I'll take my paycheck, no problem
You take yours and he still has a fine looking sun
Evangelical teens rally in San Francisco speaking of young people
More than this is so, this is pathetic
I'm going to save it for after the break because it's long and I want to interrupt it
To tell you what's going on, it's a goi shavelt, isn't that what they say in China?
It's a goi shavelt, I think that's what they say
And they know they're going over there, believe you me
I still don't understand how people who are biologically constructed the way the Chinese are have made a billion people
That has to be probably the greatest miracle in the history of human race
The quantity, not quality
Now, I'm just telling you, I just don't know how they do it
I mean, I think you've got a general idea
This is Neil Rogers
This is 560 QA4

Oh, my heart's the greatest, is asking us to present you up, please
I think my knees are not here
Oh, thank God
Does anyone have any bangie?
Basic instinct too
Hot, the sequel with a few new raincoals
I see what's wrong
I need to unsrap my money, a trust first
But now, oh wow

I have to break just as Tom calls it
To fill in Indian
1160 and 560 WDQM, I got news for he, no sherry woods, he ain't rolling the Thornton
That's for damn sure, he is what he is
Oh, and by the way, more good news from Iraq
I don't think we got this in the first bulletin
At least 30 people
About 30 men
More killed and more than 30 others wounded today
By a suicide bomber outside of Northern Iraq recruitment center for security forces
However, the Iraqi Ministry of Defense said 40 people were dead
So, you know, 30, 40, who's counting?
It's unclear who might have suffered casualties
But US military spokesmen said no Americans were injured, thanks God
That's what it says right there in the CNN story, thanks God, in parentheses
Here's that story again about them evangelical teens
What is wrong with you people? Are you crazy or what?
Oh God
More than 25,000 evangelical Christian youth slanted Friday in San Francisco
For a two-day rally at AT&T Park against the virtue terrorism of popular culture
And they were greeted by an official city condemnation in a clutch of protesters
Who said they were a vending man to a fascist mega-pepper alley
A fascist mega-pepper alley
You know it
Sounds like a cabinet meeting in the White House
Vattle cry for a generation led by a 44-year-old concord native Ronald Lewis who wants God's instruction book
To guide young people away from the corrupting influence of popular culture
Lewis whose teen-manual organization is based in Texas
Kicked off a three-day reverse rebellion to a Friday night
And tended to counter a popular culture that he says glamorizes violence and sex
The $55 advance ticket for two days of musical performances and speeches were sold out

Let's see him no more
I want to talk about the concert though I gotta say
He was marching
He was sitting in the first three rows
He was marching with Moishi
After stops and detroit in Philadelphia in the next few weeks
Lewis wants to unleash a blitz, a blitz of youth pastries and the communities
And he said to everything for more for the homeless to find new ways to bring others to Christ
He challenged youth leaders to double their size of the groups next year
And let me say it again if my neighbors leave any more Jesus books in my doorstep
Anyplace else, I'm gonna stick them right up their ass
God, what a bunch of maniacs
I mean this is what it's all about, they just won't leave you alone
They just won't stop
You'll thank them from heaven
Maybe I need to put up a banner there
Jesus isn't welcome here, okay?
Go bother somebody else with your crap
There you go
And then
The loose plans to return to San Francisco next year to chart the progress they're making
Oh yeah, that's a good place for it
That's bad news to Assemblyman Mark Lino, Democrat of San Francisco who told counter protestors at City Hall on Friday
There while such fundamentalists may be smaller number
They're loud, they're obnoxious, they're disgusting, they should get out of San Francisco
And I would say he is
Absolutely correct sir
Loose didn't flinch in the face of the counter protest
The author hosted the acquire the fire TV cable TV program, acquire the fire
And a president push a party to a federal anti-dragabuse commission wants teens to find Bible based solutions for the spread of sexually transmitted disease
Teen pregnancy drug abuse and suicide
That's right, in other words the messages go screw your brains out and then pray like hell to God that you don't catch anything
And that the way it works?
That's the way it works
Yeah
Bible based solution, pray a lot, put your hands together and pray
Now Ruchatah said once and then he'd do a couple of brahues there on that concert
No, he sings them though
No
The villains loose said range from the promiscuity and sexualization of young people on MTV and the popular online meeting hub MySpace.com
To a corporate culture that spends millions trying to woo the under 21 crowd
Woo and a womb
Battle cry will try to bring them back to God through two days of religious rockers
Speakers and the debut of what loose called a Christian alternative for MySpace.com
This is more than a spiritual war loose said it's a culture war
Military metaphor is about to lose the description of the struggle
He tells young people how an enemy has launched a brutal attack on them
At a pre-battle cry rally Friday afternoon in the stiffness city hall
Loose told his mostly teenage audience that terrorists of a different kind
Advertisers were targeting them that they were caught in the middle of the battle
Are you ready to go to battle for your generation? He asked the young people to roar
Yes
And some way triangular red flag thrown from long media evil looking poles
Oh God there's nothing like a long media evil looking pole
I've seen a few of this
Conservative leaders from Reverend Jerry fall while the Fox News commentator
The anxious Sean Henneley much of these statistical backing for the horror

Which is funded by conservative foundation since this is the Lyndon Harry Bradley foundation

Those alliances weren't lost on the 50 protests
He's representing a rainbow of San Francisco is left from abortions rights advocates
To anti-war protests activists to atheists who stage Friday's kind of protest
There is a real intolerance to homosexurabi in a lot of these organizations had Peter Cobb
An organizer would not an hour name
Earlier this week the board of supervisors passed the resolution condemning the act of provocation by what it termed
Anti-gay anti-chorus organization that aimed to negatively influence the politics of America's most tolerant and progressive city
Loose said it was the first time on the end of the course that's where very bonds plays
That's just a coincidence? I think not
Loose said it was the first time one of his events has been officially condemned
They battle cry invitation teenagers may plan the symbolism of gathering in San Francisco for a pre event rally
If the very city hall steps were several months ago game marriages were celebrated for all the world of sea
I bet your Bobby bonds is rolling in his grave. They hasn't been there very long either
Same sex marriage is another side of the end of the time, end of time
So here we go. Oh, it's the end of the time
I remember when I was a little kid back in the early 50s
Those your homies witnesses would come on the knock it on the door with that watch tower
Oh, the end of the year

I'm not here to hate anybody Scott Thompson said this isn't about bush or gaze or anything other than being here to worship together
They were all going
Oh God
That's not how some liberal leaders saw it even if it's done by a Barnum and Bailey crowd with a tent and some snake oil
I think we need to pay attention to it supervisor time Amyano said
The one of the condemnation resolution we shouldn't fall asleep at the wheel
Separated by barricades and six feet of neutral sidewalk in front of six city hall
The two sides traded to amplify calls to arms on Friday
On one side of the barricade was a girl carrying a sign that said instead of porn show us Godly relationships
On the other woman held one that said I moved here to get away from people like you
Great
As battle cry organizers walk through the crowd of young people telling them don't engage with them
One rain so counter demonstrative deal and next time come back in the summer
Loose said they will we're going to be back here in a year to see what kind of progress we made he said we're going to be back at AT&T Park or whatever it's called then
How do you like that for a shot?
I moved here to get away from people like you right?
Yeah, something I think I'm going to put that batter up on the front of my house
Or else I might just put a sign on my neighbor's house
I moved here to get away from people like or I moved away from here to get away from people like you how do you like that?
In my case, huh?
I got out of here to get away from people like you good God

I do want to understand the thing with Tom and me.
It's not personal, it's business.
I like Tom.
Tom's OK personally.
I've had some nice lunches with him.
He's not a bad guy, right?
He's a little step on.
He's even shorter than you are.
He comes up to your kneecap, I think.
About two feet tall.
No, that's not personal.
It's strictly business, Tom.
Don't see.
You notice he said that.
I'd look forward to that spy report.
I'm surprised we don't have a whole bunch of spy reports.
Aren't you?
Absolutely.
I think that everybody in town would have been up 1 o'clock.
I wonder what he was talking about.
I'm looking for an indication.

She turned me.
So this is a joke.
And I thought, this is their dead serious.
Yeah, it's a big task for you, Gil, who's what it is.
And she just, she couldn't believe it.
She's, I said, this is, this is what's running the country now.
No, no, that's what's wrong with the world.
It's been on the world ever since the beginning of time.
That's the world for you.

I'll tell you that.
Benny, you ain't lived until you seen Benny Hinn.

No.
No, no.
No, see what you want to do is make Barry Barnes a winner.
So just leave OJ and say, see, yeah, you.

And he says, that guy is a money loving greedy S.O.B.
You know what I mean?
He has all he cares about.
Of course.
It's all he cares about.
You can tell.
He's dying in his rings and his bracelets and the Rolex watches.
Well, that's why he's always smiling though because he's business is good.
Exactly.
And I have a request.
Anything from Paul Harvey, Neil.
Okay, sir.
Thank you, sir.
See you.
Yeah, for real.
I mean, it's not, again, not personal.
I don't even know him that well.
I mean, he's one of those people you couldn't get him to stand still long enough to like having
an intelligent conversation or even a stupid conversation.
I mean, he was exactly the same off the earth.
He is on the earth.
No difference.
And the thing that really gets me is like the beast.
Who's the other one?
They go when he was in Atlanta.
Well, the beast was Atlanta for some ballgame and they stopped by and hung out with
for real.
Well, what's that all about?
Wasn't for all the one that was always talking about how he wanted him off of his show
and he was the one that just like with Moe.
You know, it was the same thing.
Oh, every, every problem he had, every failure was because of the beast and get him out.
Wasn't that the right just dreaming that?
I don't know.
I don't remember that.

How much they're living?
How we've done?
Yeah.
Now, there is something.
Okay, see Tom, little Tommy.
It's not just that polls are boring.
It all depends on what they're all about.
But what a guy goes on to hear.
It says, anybody got a new watch?
Anybody buy an interesting watch?
Or how about that Milky Way dark?
Let's talk about that for three hours.
This is the new Roger.

Good morning, Americans.
It's Paul Harvey.
Stand by for news.
Bill and his wife Buffy were sitting in church.
Bill sleeping, Buffy, nitting.
The priest asked who created the earth and man.
A Buffy poked Bill with her knitting needle and Bill screamed God.
The priest looked at him and said, that's right.
Then he asked, who is God's son?
Once more, Buffy poked her husband.
Then Bill, with her needle, he screamed Jesus again.
The priest said correct.
Finally, the priest asked, what did he say to Adam when she didn't want anymore children?
Well, Buffy poked her husband Bill again, but this time he screamed,
poked me with that thing one more time and I'm going to rip it off.
The priest said that's right.
Paul Harvey.
Good day.
Good day.
11.45, boy. It's a good thing we don't hear from him much anymore.
You know what?
You'd probably be our committance sausages.
Paul, are you kidding?
He's felt the middle of the pack with this crowd we have.
That's right. He's one of our better colors.
Hey, little Tommy, there's a...
That's not an invitation though.
That's not an invitation.
He'll be on there.

The Reverend Lonnie Luke Latham 60 was charged with a single Mr. Meenor kind of ludeness last month
after propositioning an officer in a hotel parking lot.
Latham had been a public opponent of the same sex marriage and urged gay men and lesbians to change their sexual orientation with the help of Jesus Christ.
Oh, yeah.
Although Latham has pleaded not guilty and insisting that he was attempting to minister to the undercover policeman,
he was just going to minister to him.
He was going to give him an oral presentation.
He was going to administer.
He also filed a motion last week to dismiss the case based on constitutional arguments.
And a separate friend of the court briefed the same day.
The ACLU argued that Oklahoma's ludeness statue is overly broad and complicit with the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling striking Sodomy laws in Lawrence, versus Texas.
In that case, the High Court extended the right to privacy to encompass private, consensual, and non-commercial adult sex, including homosexual sex.
The Oklahoma ludeness statue didn't turn out laws, the giving or receiving of the body for indiscriminate sexual intercourse,
filatio-cutdling, masturbation, anal intercourse, or lascivious lustful or all-ascension conduct with any person not his or her spouse.
Good God, what a catalog.
Sure is, it covers a lot.
So there you go.
Of course, to show you all you closet, closet queens out there, all you closet pastors, especially you saw the backties, don't be going in pedaling or buying wears in Oklahoma.
Here comes Farma Height 9-11, controversial filmmaker Michael Moore is targeting the drug companies.
Send me your healthcare stories, reads the appeal, the stark request, heads a letter from Michael Moore, the controversial filmmaker published on his website last month,
which asks for real life examples of people's bad experiences of hospitals, insurance companies, and drug makers.
Sounds to me like kind of a remake of hospital with George C. Scott.
Yeah, except this one ain't going to be a drama.
No, it's going to be a tragedy.
Right, well, I'm the medical care and the murder of his a tragedy.
Renowned for his documentary, Farma Height 9-11, which he took on the Bush administration of the Warnarack.
Moore's latest target is the healthcare industry and long overdue work on the film, which is called SICO, has been in progress since 2004,
and it's finally expected to be premier later this year, but already speculation about his content has split the industry on the offensive.
They're pretty offensive, all right, because most of you doctors are butchers.
Well, let me give you an educated guess.
You couldn't diagnose a hangmail.
If executives at healthcare companies where they might come off badly in the film, Moore's letter leaves little doubt.
Have you ever found yourself getting ready to file for bankruptcy because you can't pay your kids' hospital bill, and then you say to yourself,
boy, I sure would like to be in Michael Moore's healthcare movie?
Moore says he'll read every letter if you've been abused in any way by this sick greedy, grubby system, and it's caused you where your loved one's great sorrow and pain.
Let me know what he says.
Exactly as in the West of the fourth coming film is a cause for concern, but most are resigned to the fact that Moore is unlikely to take a balanced approach.
Oh, geez.
The film is a concern, but Michael Moore has very little credibility with mainstream Americans as Ken Johnson, the senior vice president of the trade group pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of America.
For every horror story, Michael Moore produces, we can produce a thousand success stories, but he's not interested in them.
Nevertheless, however, it's just not Moore's on the attack.
Other films such as The Constant Gardener, all what a piece of garbage based on the novel by John LaCarrie about the corruption in the industry in Africa,
which one, Britain's Rachel Weiss and Oscar is best supporting actress last month, and the book Hardsell, the evolution of a Viagra salesman by a former Pfizer employee,
who only edited the industry's woes.
Woe is me, Melvin's Woe, with Joe Mars Jr.
Actual drug scandal, such as withdrawal by Merck of Viox, its pain reliever two years ago, after concerns about side effects on which has triggered widespread litigation against the company,
haven't helped the industry's relations with the public.
Most executives start to think that Tracer Edford's on the payroll across the street, just odd, I mean, the middle of this story.
Most executives privately admit that industry still has problems communicating what it does, that it's not just playing greedy.
According to Johnson, unrelated to Moore's film, the industry itself has become more aggressive and responding to criticism, and of course, in buying all those spots on the evening news every night, between 6.30 and 7.
One after the other after the other, you notice that?
I did.
Every single night, just one after the other.
I asked you a doctor about Levitra.
I asked you a doctor about the crestor, and oh, on and on.
Among other things, the Association has signed Montel Williams.
Oh, God.
And any award when he's syndicated tacos to promote awareness of existing drug assistance programs.
The efforts have paid off, according to Johnson, the past six months, the industry has improved its favorability rating from 45 to 54%.
They just turn the numbers around, that's all.
Companies have also become more proactive.
Blackstone Smith Klein, your of his biggest drug producer, for example, has launched a value of medicine campaign under which its sales representatives are encouraged to promote positive aspects of the industry, like not everybody's dead yet.
A spokesman says the thinking behind the campaign was put in place before the reform of the Medicare system, the state-run system which provides coverage for the elderly, which took effect this year.
Blackstone Smith Klein has also launched a new ad campaign in the US.
Catch lines such as, it's easier to put someone on the moon than develop a drug, and today's medicine's finance tomorrow's miracles are decided to promote awareness of the work drug companies do.
Right. And all the money that they're paying, the detail men are paying to the doctors so they can poison you and kill you in early age.
All of these things.
Can't wait for sicko.
Although I think we hear from them every day, don't we?
879 votes on the pool.
We got a little battle here to get to 1,000 only.
Not really.
Who is the greatest baseball player of all time?
Babe Ruth 178.
I hate baseball 144.
Willie May is 148.
What kind of pansy's hate baseball?
I hate baseball now.
Or I'm not going to say I hate it, but I'm just having no interest in now.
But I mean, what kind of a person like over the age of like other than George who's just a hard ass?
I don't hate baseball.
And I didn't go see there you go.
He wouldn't vote for that.
How was a fine player in my day?
Well, there you go.
What's the hate?
As kids growing up, most of us like baseball.
And then of course we got the sour on it because of the money and the greed and the watering down.
And then I'll be because of all the expansion or you realize the boring to watch other people play that.
I mean, you don't want to see the Paduca pirates, right?
Willie May is 114.
In fact, who wants to see the Pittsburgh pirates?
Obviously not too many.
I hate this pool 90.
10,75, the splendid spitter.
Hank Aaron 62, Mickey Mendel 43, P. Rose 40.
Barry Vaughan still in Pete's wake.
Barry Vaughan's 36.
In fact, he's much closer to the bottom.
He is near the top.
Joe to Maggio 33, it's the battle between Barry and the Jolton Joe.
Lou Gehrig 22, Tai Cobb 22, and Roberto Clemente, Solimente Vente, only 20.
These people just have, they have no passion, you know, that's his problem.
How many times have I said that?
Just this hour?
Five, third, and mid.
South Florida, the place with no passion of Talbotov Pinty like Jean Pintny would say.
Oh, we're not going to hear that.
Are we? Please.
I like Jean Pintny a lot though.
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty.
Talon five.
I think he just played it last week.
Don't knock yourself out.
How about 24 hours to Tulsa?
How many QAM?
Hello.
I don't have it.
It hurts me in love.
Yes sir.
Mars bars exactly like a Snickers bar, except it's got shut up, dragged, uses the bomb and
it's going to be nuts.
And they're awful.
No.
It's not just like a Snickers bar, Snickers bar is loaded with caramel.
Mars bar and loaded with caramel.
I think it's not a little caramel.
Nothing but a candy bar.
No you're right.
It's true to Mars bar.
Although I won't tell you this, the Mars ice cream bar is pretty good.
Yeah, actually any of those ice cream bars are better than the actual ice cream.
I do actually a candy bar.
However, that having been said, the ice creams itself, the candy ice cream, they suck.
I would.
Well I don't acknowledge the amount of things you do, Neil.
Don't go well believe you don't get it either.
Okay go ahead.
They've eaten these suck so he's turned into a little cute, clever little shot.
No they're awful.
And the fact of the matter is that briars make most of them and then they're still bad.
Now how can briars make bad ice cream?
Isn't it briars that make those?
I don't know.
Like Mars bar ice cream and Snickers are all that.
They say you're going to accuse me of doing this.
You know, you brought it up again.
No, no, no, no.
This is having no impact on my appetite for any of this stuff.
And especially the candy ice creams, they're all garbage.
M and M ice cream have you ever had that?
No.
Oh after you tell you want to have an M and M.
They are a blue, a blue, a poisoned very animal.
Horrible.
Oh look at this.
Work stoppage is over immigration.
More protest is going to be too bad.
All you will legal aliens go back where you came from.
Okay.
We're going to put you on a banana barge.
Oh there's nothing like a nice banana barge if the dairy queen.
See that guy got me started.
What?
You ever have banana barge?
No, but I'm aware of it.
Yeah, banana barges for those people are such pigs that even banana split isn't big enough for them.
So they have to go to banana barge.
Oh, real porkers out there, you know.
If I must go to the...
They won't have a banana split in a bathtub.
Which is what it's for.
Well, we're going to see it in add facts.
Employment insurance premium refunds.
Oh, what is going on with this one?
You know what?
Next thing you know your neighbor is going to be leaving you religious tracks on your front doorstep, on your stooping the operative word.
Don't you people over there understand there are no Jesus Christers in my house.
Okay, they're not welcome in my house.
Don't you understand nothing is more important than saving your heat and soul?
Oh, God.
I can just imagine.
Imagine what?
Because, huh?
Well, because somebody's family was over there visiting for 12 long, excruciating days and just got their ass out of there today.
So the neighbor across the street came over and evidently had a chat with the family.
Well, somebody was out there.
Yeah.
Which I guess resulted in those religious tracks being at the family, the fanatical Catholic family.
Oh, boy.
Which I once told the mother the reason that there is a shortage of priests and ethogos because there's a shortage of author boys.
It's funny, because it's true.
It was a great line.
And you're right, it probably is true.
And anyway, 891 votes on the pool.
Who is the greatest baseball player of all time?
I just read this tonight.
Yeah, I just did it.
We don't want to overdo it because then Tom Jickel write a whole column about it.
Oh, you know, see, here's the thing, Tom.
You hate to show now.
You don't like it.
You don't like my reading the bedtime stories on here.
You can't start the fact that it's fact we take better polls than you rat, rotten ass newspaper does.
You can't handle that.
But you don't have the balls to write about.
And here's the guy who said, oh, well, Leo's going to have a tough time or keeping in touch with local.
This man would know local from his ass.
You don't write about local.
I'm not the one that's out of touch.
You're out of touch.
So guess what, Tom?
Touch this.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 560 QAM.
This mark, Morgan, is the 12 to 1 hour on QAM.
If 9 o'clock on Sunday nights, and I'm going to watch HBO, I'm so tired of desperate housewives with a tea in Carmellacore.
I have had to wait nearly two whole years to see Junior AJ and Metal.
I'm sick of getting screwed when I turn on the tube.
And they're playing that dope that was show.
Cheers.
Gumbah, Gumbah, da da da.
Gumbah, da da da.
I waited too long for the soprano's man.
It's time we got on with this thing.
I want to see Pauli and Stylio in the back room of the bottle being.
Been so long since the last episode.
There's so many things I forgot.
Is Christopher on smack?
Cause Adriana got whacked and this Tony still sails us in guts.
So I pick up the latest TV guide and that's when I stop feeling fine.
But Johnny feels bringing back the day goes.
He should ever be Sunday at night.
But about bringing fire.
Yeah, it's about bringing time.
Bravo to it.
There's StuGots radio.
But that's the wrong one.
That's cross street.
Does he still sail the StuGots?
Oh, good God.
Thank God I never got out of that show.
Do you have no idea how many people asked me.
Do you watch sets of prinos?
No.
Yeah.
And based on what you're saying, I'm probably not missing much right now either.
No, at the point.
Although it picked up a lot of times.
How about the potential papers?
Anybody got the financial papers?
Huh?
That's all those time pedicule bits.
All the same.
Probably all him.
97 votes on a pool.
And the most interesting thing to me.
Look at it like I told you.
It's very bonds in Jolton Joe.
The Yankee Clipper.
There are nose to nose.
Oh, if somebody wins by a nose, I think it'll be the Yankee Clipper wins that battle.
Norm St. John?
Yeah.
Boy was he, was he ugly or what?
Man, he wasn't just regular ugly.
He was, he had a nose like a rhinoceros.
Jody.
Yes, he did.
He was grotesque.
But he was married to Marilyn Monroe.
Yes, he was.
And a lot of ugly guys too, like Arthur Miller.
Well, it's what she married to, only ugly guys.
Right.
She was never even married to anybody looked like human or like a particular.
It was about the particular.
Zed it.
That's what Bobbi Kennedy said.
That's right.
1203 at 560 WQA and a top advisor to former HouseWept Tom Delay received more than the third of all the money collected by the U.S. Family Network, a nonprofit organization.
The advisor created to promote a pro-family of political agenda in Congress according to groups of counting records.
Oh, God, are they?
They're the stealing and broad daylight, man.
Even the biggest brinks robbery of all time never came close to what's going on now in the public is, who do you remember like that?
Public's waxing the supreme or reruns.
Delay's former chief of staff Edward A.
Everyone Buckham, who upcreate the group, our stolen Delays employee and his wife Wendy,
with the principal beneficiaries, the group's $3.02 million in revenue, collecting payments totaling $1.00 million during a five-year period ending in 2001.
The group's revenue was drawn mostly from clients of Republican lobbyist Jack Abramov, according to which records.
From an FBI subpoena for the records, it can be inferred that the beer was exploring whether there were links between the payments and favorable legislative treatment by Abramov's clients by Delays' orifice.
Oh, brother.
That's all I should just make it up, right?
Just to tell me, Pinko, plot.
Two more of Katherine Harris' top employees quit.
Oh, well, she's got a real service.
I hope she just flushes.
She had to take that $10 million and her didn't just flush it down the toilet or give it to us.
We could have a couple of the time with the guaranteed party.
Representative Katherine Harris lost two more top staff members this week, one from her campaign orifice, and one from her congressional orifice.
It's time for me to move on so Leah Pits, the deputy campaign and the finance director of operations for Harris.
Pits is the fourth member of Harris' finance team to leave the staff in the past three months.
Leah Pits, I wonder if she's keen to Elijah Pits?
The departures come as Harris tries to rejuvenate her US Senate campaign, which is suffered from slow fundraising, bad poll numbers,
and controversy over illegal campaign contributions.
Since December, the long-boat-key Republican has lost two finance directors and a campaign treasure.
Months earlier, her campaign manager quit, and two pollsters also, VAMUST, with the Moussy Man.
Her congressional office lost its second employee in his many weeks.
Deputy Chief of Staff Peggy Evans quit last Thursday, a week after press secretary Kara Bory left after seven months on the job.
Staff turnover has been a problem for her since she was elected to Congress in 2002.
And we still want to know if they still make Clark Boris.
I believe I've already been through this.
Sam, where did you Google Clark Boris? They still make him right?
They do. You just don't see him anywhere. Thank God.
Great. You ever had you like Clark Boris?
I can't remember the last time I had him, or the first time for that matter.
Yellow raster I have. Right. Yellow raster. They look like.
They got to get to the Clark Boris.
No, I don't think so.
No, they have no peanuts. You know, between you and your damn...
I told you to remember?
Oh my God, with your coconut and amaris bar and peanuts in a Clark bar, man.
But you know what you like.
You better get your notes straightened out.
Oh, sir, sir.
They're straight.
That's what I thought.
That's an arrow.
Man. You better get your nuts in your...
They're in a rig.
Coconut straightened out.
But you're coconut straightened out.
I think you've got a problem in your coconut.
Well, sometimes you feel like it is.
Clark Bar, did you Google it? I'm sure they still make it.
They still make it.
Well, let's get a bunch.
No.
I just approved that I'm not here to try to be a PR man for the Canadian government or the Canadian people.
I would say most of the people here around me are civilized.
They certainly seem to be, but...
But, just to prove that Canadians can be just as barbaric as anybody else,
the annual seal hunt is going on now, eh?
Sick.
Really, really sick.
But you should see some of these...
Oh, God, these new fees, some of these strange people,
including some of these frogs that are busy up there hunting the baby seals.
Up to 325,000 young harp seal puffs could be killed in the coming weeks.
Celebrities such as former Beatles, Sir Paul McCartney and his wife have joined animal rights groups
in condemning the colors of barbaric and unnecessary.
Even though you don't like him, you hit him like poison, probably the...
Peta.
People are involved too.
Protesters, the anxious Steve and Harper's have Canada was victim of an international propaganda campaign
and insisted the color be carried out humanely.
Right.
When you like to get...
If you're going to choose a way of dying, when you like being clubbed to death,
and that a good way to do it, that are a machete.
The color is started with an OJ crap again.
The color which reportedly earns $16.5 million in meat and pelt sales
is an important source of income for fishing communities in Quebec and Newfoundland
that have been hit hard by dwindling fish stocks in the Atlantic.
The hunt is an annual harvest that's based on economics.
It is harvesting animals on sustainable basis, Roger Simone,
of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans told the BBC.
The Canadian government says the call is also necessary to control CO numbers,
saying the CO population is almost 6 million, nearly triple level of the 70s.
Well, how come they don't do that in China?
Huh?
That's a good idea.
Yeah.
Clubs.
It recently increased the total allowable catch by 5,000 to 325,000 poor widow baby seals.
The first day of the call has begun in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence region in Quebec.
I say let's club their frogs that have this sound like a good idea.
Those French Canadians.
I think we could call them.
On your tea, we could take a vote in South Florida, be unanimous.
Some 90,000 sealed pumps in the air are expected to be killed before the hunt moves on to Newfoundland,
where thousands more will be cold.
Oh, such a sea-killed, cold-sea sounds to say, but cold is so much more antiseptic sounding.
Cold.
That's right.
Well, kuchi kuchi koo, let's call you.
But if we say we're going to kill ya, ah, everybody runs like a bastard.
On the first day, sealers and protesters came face to face, sparking confrontations at one point,
a sealer flung the carcass of a skin seal at an inflatable craft carrying protesters and journalists.
They threw carcasses at our zodiac and became rushing at us in their boat and tried to capsize us in the wake.
Said Rebecca Aldworth of the Humane Society of the United States.
This is standard behavior out here.
The sealers feel that they're completely above the law.
That's behavior spell IOUR, of course.
But the sealers say they misunderstood.
Right. They're killing them lightly.
Mark Small, president of the Northeast Coastalist Corporation, has been sealing in Newfoundland waters for about 40 years.
I think the Canadian public realizes these are coastal people.
Yeah, barbarians who live off the sea, depend on the hunting survival of small communities where the fish docks aren't there.
Coastal communities have to live too.
Well, I have one question about that. Coastal communities have to live?
Why?
Yeah, why is that?
Screw ya.
Anyway, Paul McCartney says we're absolutely committed to making sure that this is the last slaughter of baby seals in Canada.
Anyone will ever have to witness, you said.
Well, just don't look.
You're just Canada to consider a win-win plan to win the Huff-Wall Compensating Fisherman for Lost Revenue,
some of the campaigner Brigitte Bardot also asked the Canadian government to halt the call earlier this week.
The call.
Canada is a rich country.
It doesn't need to sell skin, oil, fat and powdered seal premises to make aphrodisiacs for countries in Asia.
You can't continue a genocide of animals like this, the 71-year-old actress said she used to look good a long time ago.
But Mr. Harper, who refused to request to meet with Bardot, dismissed this suggestion, because she's old and saggy.
We don't harvest the pups.
He said referring to an 87-band of killing newborn seals and white coats with white coats pictured many anti-hump posters.
Unfortunately, we're descended with the victim of a bit of an international propaganda campaign.
He said, we believe the country's acting responsibly will make sure all rules are enforced.
You butcher your murder, that's another thing he's got in common with George Bush, Stephen Harper.
Another butcher, which is blood on his hands.
Only his case is baby seal blood, and in George Bush's case it's human blood.
Man, even a Freddy never had as much blood on his head.
Even Jason.
Mother.
Nice hockey match, though.
Never had that much blood.
Even a guy from one of Stranger calls.
I don't know what his name was.
He's a mouse.
930 votes on the poll.
The greatest baseball player of all time, Baby Ruth 193.
A rose in the baby Ruth.
I can't believe he never heard that record.
No, sorry.
I might have heard it.
I might have heard it.
You're kind of music at all.
That's right.
That's right.
Some singing G.
You would have liked it.
You would have liked it.
The rock and G.
Was he good?
It was very good.
I thought I'd clip this morning and then look at him.
I'm not into reggae really at all, but this is very good news.
I'm only into the gay part.
That's what I heard.
I'll take a break.
What's the spaxi disemnely here?
It says, I saw your poll although I'm a lifelong Yankee fan.
The only right answer is Ted Williams.
The splendid spitter.
And like I said last week, I have so much more respect for him now when I read those stories
about how he's to spend a spare time shooting pigeons in Fenway Park with a BB gun.
Nothing more annoying than a pigeon plus the Pus A.
He might have saved us from the bird flu.
You realize that?
That's too bad.
He had a good head on his shoulders.
He missed five and a half prime seasons due to WW2 in Korea.
He volunteered.
He didn't have to go back.
If not for that, add 200 plus home runs to his 530 something.
And he's the all-time leader.
He retired in 1962 after hitting 325 lifetime in home runs and maybe everything else that says.
By the way, Babe Ruthik Horner's official biography was a catcher until what we didn't want to get personal.
Until sometimes to clear a little high school, he grew up in an orphanage for boys who couldn't be controlled by his parents.
So we also played that position so that Josh is right.
He was a catcher, first base, pitcher and right fielder.
Yeah, how many positions are very bond plates have been he over in the Alachor and Prudisteroid shot in his face?
How many positions he played?
Josh.
What is he doing?
Oh my.
He's starting to come up with a good answer.
How many?
I'm going to cut up answers here.
Solomon, well why is it going on?
You just decided that's the end of the quiz.
There's no quiz.
Look, because you don't have any answers.
That's what I have my opinion.
It's going to get a chance of your opinion.
I think Babe Ruth was definitely ahead of his five-year shot.
He will agree with the very bonds as the greatest baseball player.
It's laughable on the face of this laughable.
It will be like saying that Mario Mendoza was the greatest baseball player.
You know what?
It's just silly.
No, it's not silly.
It's silly.
It will be like saying Mark McGwire was the greatest baseball player of all time.
Oh, it's not even close to for Sammy Sosa.
You didn't hear the stat that I gave you.
I'm a huge Miami of the...
I keep getting him confused with what's his name?
500-500.
Who's the one that did I love you Miami?
That's Levant Hernandez.
Levant, Levant.
Levant.
Even out in Zog this.
Zog into the song about him.
You know, he walked almost a thousand times more than Babe Ruth.
Yeah.
And he still is doing what he's doing.
Well, that's because he's doing what he's doing.
He's doing what he's doing.
Well, that's because he's doing what he's doing.
He's doing what he's doing.
He's doing what he's doing.
He's doing what he's doing.
He's doing what he's doing.
He's doing what he's doing.
He's doing what he's doing.
He's doing what he's doing.
He's doing what he's doing.

He still does what he does.

forecast is projects a two to one chance two to one chance this is from the eighty-case school of a meteorology
that a category two system will slam south Florida this season with the i hitting Palm Beach County in September
can't to but it's a big time no small time
small category two is nothing that's like uh... just a little blow their prediction high ever wasn't derived under the
street scientific process of analyzing dozens of atmospheric indicators rather was coupled together with a lot of
gut feelings spiritual inspiration in touch of incense what incense or i see that's because these four casters are those
question of biggest odds makers a terror card reader and a psychic who normally maybe refer to Emma was in on this
who normally predict ask her when a football games and future romances but the south Florida sunsend also wise
them to stretch their clear voice skills and for tell whether another rough summer is in the offing
i don't see any reason why this year would be any different last year said we now on route
the biggest gambling press the partner stator who would know whether man from his ass
can he white owner of the biggest sports consultants puts the odds a two to one that another hurricane similar strength
a woman will hit here oh god please no on the other or a handy forecast and overall slower say you know what what
kind of story is this what kind of swill are you putting on the air about which craft and uh... which doctors although

Can't take this scum.
You...
You won't want to scum.
Oh, how about...
How about Keeshawn Johnson?
Keeshawn despised by all.
And what kind of a name is that anyway?
Keeshawn Johnson.
I just...
These names just send me right to the bull.
Maybe that's why George was running this morning.
Maybe he had to do a Keeshawn.
Hey, I just did an on-cord during that last break.
No, get out of here.
An on-cord performance.
That's right.
Standing ovation, too.
And I heard it was an open house.
Now, here's a good idea.
This might brighten your day, George.
Here's an idea for you.
All right.
A Muslim couple in New Delhi, India, have been told by local Islamic leaders they must separate after the husband divorced his wife in his sleep.
So, Hila, I'm sorry, told friends that her husband, Aftah.
Wait a minute.
All right.
I got my gun.
How did this...
Her husband...
As soon as I saw this story, I knew who I thought of.
Her husband, Aftah, been under the word Talak or divorce three times in his sleep.
Talak?
Talak.
T-A-L-A-Q.
T-A-O-K.
I don't know what's that really.
T-A-L-A-Q.
You know what I mean?
Talak.
A court published in newspapers today.
I know you like it a lot.
When local Islamists got...
When you listen to this, when local Islamic leaders got to hear they said Aftah,
the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,
they said,
the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,
they said, the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,
they said, the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,
they said, the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,
they said, the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,
they said, the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,
they said, the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,
they said, the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,
they said, the people who were forced to divorce under the word Talak,
they said, there is divorce in property and herds.
This is a totally unnecessary controversy in the local community leaders
or whosoever said, our totally ignorant of Islamic law
said, Zarafool Islam Khan and Islamist scholar,
editor of the Millig widgets a popular Muslim newspaper,
thought my mother wrote that, the Millig widgets the law clearly says
any action under compulsion in the state of intoxication has no effect.
The case is someone uttering something while will sleep
fall under this category.
We'll have no impact whatsoever, consult over it.
You give it a try, I can't hurt,

fat one converts the abundant policy is a rebel omega-6 fatty acids in the
coveted omega-3
the nucleus of pig eggs was then removed and substitute with the nucleus from
these
engineers cells following the now classic method of animal cloning that began
with dolly
in i-6 and louis Armstrong
with that hanky wiping a sweat off his fat face
research is prime a mistake a better understanding cardiac function
or hogging human are strikingly similar to you know that
well i guess you've seen the
uh...
i did know that
we would use these animals as a model to see what happens to hard health if we
increase the omega-3 levels in the body
it allows to see how that helps cardiovascular function

Not that I know, but okay
I hate him
Roger Clemens, fat, big mouth, obnoxious
Retired 400 times
Some of the interesting ones, they're like NCAA
And I'm not putting these on tomorrow
But three most handed figures, NCAA football
Steve Spurrier number one, Bobby Bob number two
And Phil Fulmer number three, I don't know who Phil Fulmer is
Who's that?
I know who that is, hold on
I'm holding it
I think he's the head of C coach
I think I'm gonna look it up
NCAA basketball is three most handed figures
Wait to hear who number one, especially the timing is perfect
Dick Vitale is number one
Most handed figure in NCAA basketball
Amen, amen
Baby
Coach K is number two
They don't want to put out your chef's he said they put Coach K
And JJ Redick is number three
And NHL's three most handed players
Well look at that, yeah he's a Tennessee football coach
Todd Bertuzzi, which I put him on our list
Derrius Casparitas and Yarko Routou
Ty don't even need to make the list
And as far as most three handed figures
Kurt Bush is number one and then after that
It says in conclusive, nobody
Now I'm gonna vote, they got their own little poll on here
I'm gonna vote for, well just to make you happy
I'll vote for Dick Vitale
Here's the, it says who is the most hated figures in sports
All sports then the choices are Todd Bertuzzi, Barry Bonds, Kobe Bryant
Kurt Bush, Teraloans, Steve Spurrier, Dick Vitale
Or I'm putting Dick Vitale, okay?
I voted and here's what it is
Or you'll be pleased to know it was close
They got almost 3,000 votes
Teraloans 38%, Barry Bonds 36%, Kobe Bryant 19
And after that small put it is Dick Vitale only 6%.
Well if we're going guys like Dicky V, it's the part
Are we gonna do, no no no
Most of the athlete, he's no athlete
No, God, maybe at the dinner table, that's about it
He's not awesome, baby
Yeah, he's awesome when it comes to being despised
Makes me nauseous, God
And then there's a whole bunch of Dicky V wannabes too
You've noticed that, I don't know what their names are
And who do I care?
Anyway, I looked up Calypkin Jr. and he already has two votes
His lifetime batting average was 276
Which is okay, you know, it's all right
And his lifetime home runs 431
Which again, it's a respectable figure
But certainly doesn't put him anywhere in the category
The only thing he's got going for is he was the Iron Man
That's all I broke who Gary's record
That's just a revolve
And that's it, that's it
Good ball player, solid, I would say he was rock solid
But that's about it, certainly not in the same categories these other
But we put him on, he's got two votes already
Probably relatives
New poll shows that Democrats lead by 9 points
So there's plenty of time between now and elections to blow that
Time magazine survey shows unhappiness with the GOP
But can Democrats translate that into a power shift?
Well, you know them
Like the Leafs in the Canadians last night both desperately trying to blow those leads in the last five minutes
Times latest poll finds American voters heading in
November's election to satisfy with the Republican-dominated status quo
But I'm necessarily convinced the answer lies in voting Democratic
The poll conducted March 22 and 3rd finds Americans unhappy with the performance of the Republican-controlled Congress
39% approve versus 49% who don't
And give the Democrats a 9-poly when voters ask to stay
Which parties candidate they choose for the House
50% said Democrat-41% Republican
Votes favor Democratic-controlled Congress by 49% to 38 who want Republican-controlled
And it goes on but it'll be put there you go
Time magazine for what it's worth about 50%
56670560, 0560 in the Verizon Singular Rival Sline
So here's what I got for tomorrow so far
The athlete, the all-time athlete, you dislike the most pretty big list
OJ Simpson, Pete Rose, Dury Bond, I hate sports, I hate this poll
Kurt Warner, Mark McWire, Jose Conzucco, Raphael Palmer, Owing Gretz,
Gneetlenose, Kobe Bryant, Keeshawn Johnson, Kurt Schilling, Terrell Owens,
Ron Arthest, Ty Dohme, Mike Tyson, Todd Bertuzzi, Brian Cox, John Rocker,
Old John Rocker, Ricky Williams, Michael Irvin, Ray Lewis, Phil McElson,
Peyton Manning, and Roger Clemens, Fat, Roger Clemens
Come on, retire already, Roger, it's enough, enough for the BS
W-D-Q-A-M, hello
People feel the ball with the 20-year-old people
Q-A-M
They're never talking about it, so Korea, they're a, uh, amusement park
And they were 50-nots of people, they were gonna let it all in free
To ride the ride, and all the little kids here have fun
That's for real
Oh, great, that was for real, I'm out of my mind
Yeah, great
W-D-Q-A-M sounds the same as usual, Q-A-M, hello
Hey, Neil
Un? Listenable, yes
Um, I think Gal Ripkin will be inducted in the Hall of Fame next year
Barry Bond's, he won't even go in on the first bow
But is Sam usual on your list?
No, he got all of God
We can put him on it, well when we, oh God, Sam Usal wasn't known as much of a bass runner
Who is as slow as molasses, he was a, you know
Yeah, compare him to Mickey Mishmple
Yeah, you compare him now, I wouldn't put him in the same league with Mickey Mantle
Not even the same ballpark, we'll really measure Mickey Mantle, are you kidding me?
We can start putting on like Andy Pathco and, uh, you know, uh, some of those guys
How about Yogi Barra?
Well, I don't know about him
Really, I do, he's, uh, likes the F-Lac Duck
And he said it ain't over until your call is done and believe me, it's done
But that was that guy talking about, he said Elsen Howard
You can even put Stan Musal on there if you want
But then, see we can put all the great players on there
And then we'll have a list of like 50,000 names
And that's not the point
See, the question is, who is the greatest baseball player of all time?
I mean, if you would try to tell me Stan Musal is better like Babe Ruth or Ty Cobb
I'd look you in the face and go, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
I mean, there are other great players we haven't put on there because of the generational thing, you know
I mean, Ty Cobb is from 800 years ago, but how about like Walters Johnson?
How about Roger's Hornsby, huh?
How about, uh, Gabby Hartnett?
Gabby Hayes, right?
Huh?
Hank Greenberg?
W-D-Q-A-M, hello
Who wants to put Stan Musal under? What about Al-Kalai?
Q-A-M, hello
Yeah, how about Ron Santa?
Anyway, hey, Neil, how's the mouthpiece?
I'll tell you that
Commander of Chimps was running around the nation talking about the success story of Cal Afer
and now Rack, we're heading cleared out all the, uh, the surgeons
Yeah
Uh, bombing there today, suicide, killed 40
Oh, right!
Yeah, we've had that on before
Yeah, that's the success story
We're doing it, baby, don't forget mission accomplished, MI, mission accomplished
If that's the success story, where's the failure, right?
Uh, everywhere, okay, thanks
Yeah, the, uh, it's working, it's working with Chimps
Doug Thompson writes, your favorite, do I have time for this?
Yeah, I'll make time
They tell the right, it's your format
Move by that
No, I don't think I got time, this is for real
Well, I, see, when I do that, it's a bad idea
Because then Tom Jik is right, then reading these bedtime stories is bad
Because I rush through them and I fumble and bumble
And then nobody even gets the, the drift up, you know what I'm saying?
Nobody even gets the, uh, the gist
Can I say that?
Oh, sorry, Joyce, nobody gets the f*** of it
Can't say that
Careful
It's called with a G, Joyce, Joyce with a J, just with a G
Just, uh, cut the crap, Joyce
We got a thousand and fifty-three vote on there, did we put Stan Yucil?
We did, yeah, we don't have any votes
Yeah, that guy I vote for
You heard what he said, oh, God, when I said, oh, he's on it
Oh, God, like, like, I mean, how can you do that?
Like Joe Cunningham will be on there next
I mean, what about Red Shandies, huh?
What about any Matthews?
Boy, I sure liked any Matthews
What about Dale Murphy, huh?
What about Raphael, uh, what the hell was the short stuff for the Braves?
Raphael, uh, he was terrible
You know who was the announcer that really bugged me the most?
Who's that?
What's the thing about this? He has the Ernie Johnson with the Braves?
Yeah, remember Ernie Johnson?
I do
The ex-pitcher?
He was so annoying, uh, he was Raffi, he was Raffi, he was Murphy
He just said the way he talked to me, he just didn't, he just didn't belong on here
And then he would, he also retired about a hundred times
Even Mary Olamu never retired as many times as Ernie Johnson
God, almighty
And then every time some of the Braves games were wide up on another one
There was Atlanta cable stations that there would be Ernie Johnson and they'd drag Shleifah out of here
They've had some of the worst announcers other than Skip Carey
I was chip working with him on a game so I'm watching a baseball, I guess it's Skip and Chip
Yeah, yeah
They're good, but other than that, that Pete Van Wearing, man, he's just horrible
They've had some of the most awful announcers there in Atlanta and Ernie Johnson
What the hell was that short stuff? Raffi, uh, uh, uh, Ramires
Oh, what, what a mind, what a brain, Raffi, uh, Ramires, am I right?
Josh, uh, when, when are you talking about?
Just a few years ago, oh, Google it for Christ's sake, what is wrong with you?
You're, you're giving me an argument about Gary Bonz is the best player of all time
You don't even know Raffi, old Ramires?
Next thing you're gonna ask me who the hell Ryan Sandberg was
Okay, ridiculous, huh?
The hell's right, and what are, how come Ernie Banks is non-disclist?
Let's get some Cubs you son here
C Stan Newseals got one as Harry Carey would say Newseal, I don't know why he said that
He always said that
Ernie Banks, right? Let's play ten
Okay
Now, certainly you remember, certainly Ernie Banks?
Of course, yeah
How about Willie McCovie? You're a big giant scott, as very Bonz crap, Willie McCovie
You wanna get him on there, he was good
Okay, Willie Stargell, what do I want?
Let's Willie Stargell, Dave Parker, Phil Mazurowski, Dip Grote, listen, maybe I should rock
Hoppe, Austin, copy all the major league players that have already been there
Now we're talking, there you go, let's do it the fair way
Stop that, everybody achieve
Everybody achieve, right?
This is Camila Pascale, Pedro Ramos
It's Hurricane Hotline, 1397 from Furny Coast, R. St. Austin, South Miami
Top college hoops with head coach Frank Hay, here on 560 QAM
You're bad
Oh, Dave, you know I never made them personal
Oh, I saw you stare at the way they do
I wanna go get nowhere at you
I think it was one of the first times
Oh my God, I'm so unlucky
Really?
I'm a man of girls
I have a wonder
I have a wonder
I can't remain tall
She meant her
I'm in a laced roof full of hair
And all her teeth were flat
She smelled like wine and turbid tines
And had a big cold water bath
I'm totally uncomfortable
She's Willie Erick
She's Willie Erick
She's Willie Erick's size too
And if you saw her, I'd say
In a crowded place
You would throw up in your mouth
30, 30, 30
Can you give me a chance?
Can you come to home?
She looked like a sick crackle
Sort of like gently ringed nose
That's a shot
Once they see me QAM, Al-Cythe Conspirator is the carious or is it Zacharias or who cares Musawi?
We decor the sack
The Musi man
Testify today that he and would be sure to Zach watch your back Zach
Testify today that he and would be shoe bomber Richard Reed was both Isaac the fifth heir plan on September 11th and fly to the White House
Musawi's testimony on his own behalf
Stunned the courtroom as he disclosed details he had never revealed before
It was in stark contrast to his previous statements in which he said the White House attack was to come later
If the US refused to release a radical Egyptian chic or is that shake in prison on earlier terrorist convictions
Shake Yaboodi
Musawi testified he lied to investigate is when arrested in August of 2001 because he wanted to let the attacks on 9-11 go forward
Yes, you can say that he said when the prosecution asked if that was why he misled them
The statement was the key to the government's case that the attacks might have been averted
Had Musawi been more cooperative following his arrest
He told the court he knew the attacks were coming sometime after August 2001 and bought a radio so he could hear them unfold
Which he sure is helping to be listening to QAme if he was Miami or across the street which they were on the area
Specifically you see that I'm thinking during this last break and I saw this story
And I think about when we were at QAED and it was like any like a hurricane you know Andrew or like some major news event
You know the OJ trail everybody in town would tune to us to hear it and we had the news department involved
And we're like all over like stink on Greg you know remember?
Yeah, I remember I'm trying to forget
Oh and now just like on 9-11 when Gully said oh well what are we gonna say about it?
Come on building strong. Well, we're gonna say come on we gotta talk about sport.
sport
God I can't we ever live that down. No
Specifically he said he knew the world trade center was gonna be attacked but certainly he wasn't part of the plot
And didn't know the details. Taken the stand in his own defense and his death penalty trial
He said he declined to become a suicide pilot in some future attack when asked by senior Al-Qaeda official in 99
I had knowledge that the twin towers would be hit he said I didn't know the details
Asked by his Laura why he signed his Gully plea in April as the 20th hijacker he replied
Because everybody used to refer to me as the 20th hijacker was a bit of fun
Sorry, testified commonly his death penalty trial but against his Laura's wishes
Before we took the stand his Laura's made a last attempt to stop him from testifying but failed
The fence attorney Gerald Zirken who looks like her Gurken
I argue that his client would not be a competent witness because he has contempt for the court only recognizes Islamic law
And therefore the affirmation it takes it be meaningless as by Zirken if he was supposed to be one of the men who would pilot a plan on 9-11
He said no adding I'm sorry. I don't know about the number of planes
But I was not the fifth hijacker about his Gully plea he said I took a pen I signed it
There you go that's a curious and mousseau is a Lucy man
Press reports the UN says he's seeking asylum outside of Afghanistan
That's not sitting well in the home front though even after the Taliban becoming Christian renouncing Islam
Is a capital offense under Afghanistan's Islamic law often is caused triggered outrage in the outside world
Death to the Christian
5-6-7
Yeah I'm going to try to argue with that
Oh man 5-6-7-0-5-60
On you crazy religion to go kill each other and leave the rest of us alone already
We want nothing to do with it
We're not part of your fight
1075 votes the greatest baseball player of all time and isn't this appropriate?
I've appropriate now the baseball season is going to be starting any moment now
What's opening day Josh April looked to her
Yeah I mean the marlins don't start the season on the road
They come home
Yeah but the good news I told you were you in there when I was telling you this morning about the schedule
I never know when you're in there you're always very sneaky and required
He did it out
That's me I'm sneaky
Anyway April 12th which that's a Wednesday not that far away either
At 105 the podraisers in for two afternoon games 12 and 13th 105 both days
Yeah which is their first home series
Oh and the 19th the following Wednesday the reds game which I'm sure must be in Cincinnati
12.35 pm that sounds like a noon exit for us on that day
This is good
See I spent my time since they have about to give me the
Oh the schedule yet I spent a little bit of time about five minutes yesterday researching the April so there's three days in April
That we get like an early exit to which we say
Not that we don't want to do our part and do our duty but you know
We don't have the chance to get out early you know that's right
Like for example Hank's going off to Vegas
They don't see him on a schedule on Thursday or Friday or I'm saying
And then two to four on Thursday and Friday I'm seeing
And I want to kill myself I just want to appeal myself on a sharp object till I keep in mind what you said
And then just forget about it
Yeah
And see it's the only means of surviving
But that's right that's right even he knows
Don't get it on you
Oh
Doug Thompson Campbell Hill blue says just a little old-fashioned karma coming around
He says the right wingers call it a witch hunt the left wing calls it justice
Whatever you call it blogger bend Dominic and Washington Post dot com both got what they deserved
You have to wonder what the suits at Washington Post dot com were smoking
When they decided to create a right wing blog called red America and then hire a 24 year old want to be book editor
Who brags about not being a journalist to write it that was a shallow move by so-called journalistic entity
Dominic short lived 10 year at the post website came to an embarrassing and Friday when he resigned after the blogging community uncovered multiple cases of plagiarism
By the answer who works as an editor at the other right wing
Regnery press resigned as Washington speak for fired it
I want to apologize to national review online my friends and colleagues here at Red State
And to any others that have been affected over the past few days Dominic wrote Friday under his pen name Augustine on the red state website the right wing web
Trivia to start I also want to apologize to my previous editors and writers whose work I used inappropriately without
Attribution there's no excuse for this there was there any excuse for any obfuscation my earlier statement
Obfuscation Dominic speak for I got caught and tried to weasel my way out of it didn't work
Now he tries to contrition a little bit too late the apologies that red states hate Dominic will take some
Need time off from the website that's their double speak for banishment our critics can raise their glasses and toast to what they think is success
Turing down a flawed conservative the red state masters posted Friday
But they realize their greatest weakness destroying a conservative is not to destroy conservatism and while they put all their energy
Inventing this campaign it's worth remembering that for all the noise
They have yet to present a real alternative to an America that rests on the foundation of freedom free markets and family
Against that the only answer they have is yet another personal attack
All the hypocrisy of politics it's a personal attack when the other side does it red state like most partisan blogs on both sides of the political offense exists primarily to attack the other side
Most of them conservative or liberal are too busy bashing each other to offer any real alternatives
Red state is where Dominic called Coretta Scott King the late wife of civil rights legend dr. Martin Luther King a communist
He later called to claim a joke that I've learned after too many years of dealing with the right wing that most of them lack a sense of humor
Dominic also claimed to use material originally written by author p.j. O work with a works knowledge and permission that came as quite a shock to work who told me or times he's never heard of Dominic and didn't remember ever meaning him
I wouldn't want to swear in the court of law that an ever-methe guy worked hold at times but I sure didn't give him permission to use my words under his byline no
In Arlington the suits of Washington Post dot com scrambled to come up with a plausible something explanation for this group
While some of their own applauded the demise of Bend Dominic
Excuse me if I shed no tears over the elimination in the first round and he practically the opening tip off of the new social conservative blog red America
Written by this cat who claims his name has been Dominic writes post blogger Joel Ockenbach I guess to be a blogger with a poster name has to end in CH
Apparently he saves time when writing by using words right off the shelf by produced customized writing when there's so many perfectly good words already crafted
Dominic is supposedly 24 but I'm betting right here and now that he's a junior in high school Ockenbach continues all this other investigation
His blog red America didn't contain anything would make someone thinking was the second coming of William F. Buckley indeed this whole affair seems like a spoof of prank
To make all the real authentic rock rock rib hard-headed if perhaps slightly lizard hard to conserve his look bad
Of course they say that about the entire last five years of the American government
During an online chat session Friday post humor calmness Gene Weingarten observed journalism is journalism when you need people who have an idea what they're doing
Even if they're just full-maning on the web amen but the message is lost with the bosses at Washington Post dot com
In the past 24 hours we learned of allegations that vent Dominic plagiarized material that appeared under his by-line and various publications prior to Washington Post dot com
Contracting with him to write a blog that launched Tuesday Washington Post dot com executive editor Jim Brady brought on the American blog Friday
And investigation of those allegations was ongoing and the interim Dominic has resigned effective immediately
Brady continued when we hired Dominic we weren't aware of any allegations that he had plagiarized any of his past writings
In any cases where allegations such as these are made will continue to investigate those charges thoroughly
In order to maintain our journalistic integrity sorry, but the post journalistic integrity went out the window when they won decided the website needed a right-wing
Blog and too hard an amateur to write it there was a stupid move and the post is there's all the shame that comes from such incredible
Incredibly stupidity and people like them can't afford to be made to look stupid or ridiculous
That's what Marlon Brando said all the time I heard yeah now who is it that said that cap or something that was Jack Waltsitt in the gun font
Right I said at the time Hagen just before he went to horse heads in New York I'd take it one thing if there any people alive and haven't seen the grandfather
We don't want to talk to you. We don't want to know you that's right. You want to see it's like a touch for me right it's like a checkpoint right if you haven't gone that far
We don't know somebody's pulse right oh you didn't see the Godfather. Oh, you're a dead man. You got no problem. Don't wait for me. They're in clean

And he looks like he's sucking on a quince got an sf the cap on his head
It couldn't be very bonds good at the oxidative but he didn't win

Why put him on our pool just you know we're going to left out AJ Przenski and he need his father in the balls

Yes, I did not know oh well that's what it says here
It's followed by me those AJ I'm gonna put it on here
I mean you got who's spelled that right you know yeah right there what nothing what
I said you're gonna spell that right and I said oh you got it yeah because I'm going to throw
I'm copying it right up here Phil Michelson other pros think his image is all phony
But it's working with most people bonzy wills actually like a virus on off the court
I don't know who that is he plays for tennis obviously no he's basketball player
Oh bonzy well correct I don't know who that is Michael Iconnelli America's biggest
BOWICE is a fisherman so it's his bass hole oh we can actually say that oh I like that
I might pick up on that you bass hole that's excellent but when I when I put no fisherman on here
Kobe Bryant selfish broke up a potential dynasty and I mentioned selfish it says
for Kurt Schilling very full of himself some diamondbacks actually think that he doctored that
the famous bloody sock bloody sock you know what was that when he pitched in the world series
that kept showing a bloody sock oh I missed that thank god
Kurt Bush number three criticizers teammates and like thinks he's about like above everyone
else Kurt Bush two very bonds have you heard any good things about very bonds from teammates
has the world's biggest hip-on in shoulder it says and number one to row one's way we need to
begin it says so there you go a one and a two I don't think you have to worry about it because
with T.O. on there and also of course with the O.J. who's not in here because uh you know he hasn't
played in a long long time plus these people are probably intimidated city hall banishes the Easter
Bunny the Easter Bunny is becoming human rights issue in Minnesota at least according to the same
policy council see I don't understand but I guess it's the same as Christmas though because Christmas
supposedly was going to be like a real religious holiday and then they they jazzed it up with all
kinds of like chatskeys you know like tree the tree with the pencil and the star or pagan stuff
there's the balls again see every story there's balls hanging yeah and the same with Easter I mean
this is this is Jesus getting uh coming back isn't it right when he's crucified I forget
I guess crucival and then he comes back shortly thereafter right I get my crucifix is uh get
accruciated by the party comes back on Sunday which doesn't sound like three days to be what was
he do when I'm chavis huh all he he probably would buy him probably was in the show anyway so Easter is
about this very solemn thing which of course is the basis of the whole fairy tale Christianity
about how he was crucified and then resurrected and he rose again we're written by people lived
a hundred years later but nevertheless and yet when you think of Easter don't you think it like
the Easter bunny and Easter egg and like I know I'm a house a laundry and Easter eggs and
those catberry eggs that are so yummy and they don't get anywhere near me because I can't stop
eating after the gold fertility pagan fertility symbols oh excuse me that's right man all that
silly craft the Easter bunny the Easter Bunny is becoming human rights issue Minnesota at least
according to the same post city council after the city human rights director tyrone terrell argued
it would be a good thing to move all Easter references from the city hall lobby council president
Kathy Lancia or today display celebrating the popular holiday to be taken down
according to the mini apple saint Paul start to be in the items and question included a cloth
rabbit and pastel colored eggs they read happy Easter oh what's the big sentence with that I mean
even as anti-religious Zion might just get so you know because see the important stuff they ignore
but the silly little nonsense like this they get all whipped up about you know is it X-Men
is it Christmas is it yeah all this other nonsense people got a little too panicky on this when
council member david toon said I think people should be encouraged to express their beliefs
so long as they're not proselytizing amen quick pride of break people's arm okay including my
neighbors cut the crap a council secretary purchased the items for their own money in for more than
a decade is reportedly brought other holiday items for display mr. terrell told the apino when
it complained about the reason display he told us to contribute on Thursday not as you wasn't about
the rabbit or the egg it was the sign on the door this in happy Easter just like just like in the old
testament it wasn't the apple of the pair on the tree was the pair on the ground that's what
god got pissed off about what they were doing we talk about diversity respect inclusion when you
put that on the front door of a government office it could be offensive to someone who's a Muslim
a Jew and atheist what have you see thank goodness the atheist at least came ahead of what have you
that was me what have you not much that's my job to bring it to someone's attention mr. terrell
