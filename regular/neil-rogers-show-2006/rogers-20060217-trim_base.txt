Hi!
It's a good toy!
I'm here in the old man, I'll tell you that. I finally figured out how you tell when you get old.
I have a lot of ways.
No, no, I got one way, the best.
I'm experienced yesterday. It was freezing rain yesterday.
Yesterday was one of the few nasty days we've had here in a long time.
It's all gone today, but freezing rain.
So, oh, I don't know about 430. I decided to go to the drugstore and pick up a few things.
How come I'm hearing that echo in the back?
Echo!
But anyway, so I go across the street and I realize that season is really slippery.
Every step you take, you like, slip and slide a little bit. Plus it's windy.
So you're like ice skating with no skates.
So I go and I get my stuff and I got about 5-6 items in a bag and I come out of there.
And while I was in there for 5 minutes, I guess the temperature must have dropped like about, you know, a little bit.
To the point where everything was just frozen solid, like a sheet of ice.
So I come out and I get almost to the curb and all of a sudden I realize I'm like ice skating.
I'm moving, the wind is blowing me around and so I made a bad mistake.
Instead of just getting my bearings, I grabbed onto a pole.
There was a pole, like a bus at the bus time.
I grabbed the pole and the pole was like a sheet of ice too.
So that caused me to slip a little bit and boom, I go down on my knee.
You know, not like a bad fall.
I go down. So about 3-4 items out of my bag go flying on a sidewalk.
Well, I stood up and then I realized to try to bend down to pick up the items,
the wind is blowing me and I'm thinking if I actually reach down to pick those up, I'm going to go flop on my face again.
So here comes a guy with say about 70, very nice man, tagging guy looking guy.
And he comes by and he picks up the items and he hands into me, I open the bag and I said,
do you think very much? And he reaches out, this is it.
He reaches out his hand for me to grab onto.
I'm already standing up, keeping my hand.
That's like he's lifting me up for him to help me across the street.
I said, oh no, that's okay, thanks very much.
And I thought to myself, wouldn't that be something to be helped across the street by a 70-year-old man?
Yeah, and I thought to myself, man am I older or what?
Absolutely.
You know, that's not just an age thing. I was never good at nice and slow.
Well, you know, the other thing that didn't make me feel so bad is as I'm standing there,
and he's picking up the items, there's two kids, two teenagers, and they're about a half of a block away.
And they're like, oh, and you hear all the noise and you look and one of them went slipping on his ass,
and the other one was like sliding, you know, a slide like he was on skates, but he wasn't.
I mean, it was, I never experienced anything like that.
That's why I always hated that weather.
When you had ice and snow, and you're out there trying to negotiate that walking.
Always good for a flop, you know.
I remember one time, only once in my life, I think, I ever did that on the ice,
and I was walking down the front steps of my house to go to high school,
to walk through school, my arms full of my books, and zip there I went down the stairs,
and there were books going to fly in all the directions.
There was a long time ago, about a hundred years ago.
That's the only other time I remember slipping on the ice.
This was impossible.
I mean, I'm watching the people out there, and everybody's like skidding,
and I had good walking shoes, you know, new balanced good shoes, but I don't know.
But it's all gone now.
So there was a real lesson in life for it.
You don't want to be helped across the street by an old guy.
It's older than you are.
A very nice man, but he's, I was just thinking if we had ice and snow,
Florida, can you imagine that happening there?
How about people driving there?
Somebody would have probably come by and picked up the items in rain like that.
Hey, our driving is no fun in that view.
Yeah, icy road.
Yeah, well that's true.
In fact, they have what they call, well, you probably remember black ice.
Yeah.
You know, when you can't see it, you don't know that it's there, but especially on the bridges.
You know, on the bridges.
Stuff freezes up and you can't see it, because you get just the right temperature when it's raining.
When it's like right between rain and snow.
And you can't do anything about it either.
And I remember one time when we were driving back from some ski place up in Vermont,
going back in the city when I lived in New York and there were four of us in the car.
And we hit that black ice patch.
Yeah.
And we started a skid and the guy driving said, well, here comes the accident.
And we just were going to have an accident.
There was no way to stop it.
Yeah.
And we did.
We wound up bumping into a part of a toll.
Skidded right into it.
I'm going to another brief great story.
It's a miracle I'm still alive.
This is speaking of the racetrack.
Many, many years ago, I've been in Detroit.
I'm working in Kalamazoo, which is 150 miles from Detroit.
But what's that when you're going to the track?
You know, I used to go like five, six nights a week.
Sure.
So 300 miles around the trip.
But in those days, the speed limit was 70 or 75.
You could go 90 easy.
So I'm driving on the Interstate I-94 from Kalamazoo Detroit.
And I'm about two thirds of it away there and it starts raining like hell.
And I'm going pretty damn fast too, because you got a hot day at the Hazel Park.
It's going to be a lot of fun.
I'm going to get a flat tire right there in the highway.
Well, you're going that fast in the rain.
You did.
And so now I basically I gave up because now I totally lose control of the car.
And this is like about, oh, I don't know, six o'clock in the afternoon.
It's like what's going to be rush hour.
And so I actually let go of the steering wheel because I couldn't steer the car anymore.
And I went across the highway to my left and then back across to the right without hitting anybody.
A miracle.
And then off the off the shorter of the road, there was like one of those metal.
I don't know what to do.
We call those things.
The things that the side of the road like a guardrail.
Yeah, very good.
Like a guardrail.
Excellent.
What is more on I am?
Well, I had that old age episode.
And the guardrail stopped.
Boom, I just stopped right there.
So somebody just pulled up and stopped.
Some goods and Mary said, boy, I wish you could have seen that.
It was the scariest thing ever saw in my life.
I said, well, I was in the car.
So I kind of relate to it.
Were you driving a sports car then?
No, I was driving a white cutlass.
Not a sports car.
Well, to make a long story short, I still made it.
I still, yeah, I got it towed to a nearby garage.
And I called and got a red car.
And I, well, wasn't that far from the airport?
You know, the pre-metry airport.
And I got a red car and I made it to the track for post-time.
Let's hear it.
That's the real degenerate.
Okay.
Now since you brought it up, I think I'll go gamble today.
Oh, no charges against waiting his wife.
Yeah, I saw those charges against waiting in Mrs. Wayne.
Well, isn't that sweet?
I still say that they gambled their brains out.
And probably illegal too.
I have nothing wrong with gambling, as you know.
I don't hold a grudge against people that plunge their guts up.
But nevertheless, it's just, you know, it's all for a crap.
I guess the gambling is not illegal.
It's taking the bet that is.
I see.
The bookmaking part is illegal.
But you can't prosecute the bettors.
The bettors are called as witnesses.
And I'm going to call up Mokzie Solomon.
See how he's doing.
The dead for a long time.
Yeah, check him out.
Well, see, the problem with him was, he was a good guy and he'd give people credit.
You know, he's just an old saffy, you know.
And get, uh, wind up getting, holding the bag, as they say.
Kind of like, you know, somebody else we never, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
He's to hold the bag.
We're at least clippin' on the side of the chair.
Somebody was telling me a story about how they were in, uh, Omaha,
for the college world series, and sunny, uh,
asked them if they wanted to go to the races and, uh,
it wasn't like Sarbin, it was someplace else.
Or no, a tour casino was a casino.
Really?
And, uh, I want to go play a few hands of Blackjack.
He says it's not too far from here.
Who is 200 miles away.
Of course.
The good drive and the drive, where is this place?
No problem, I'm sure.
For a few hands of Blackjack.
Yeah, no problem.
That's a real degenerate for it.
That was sunny.
Well, see, in Kalamazoo, the great thing that we had going is that it was like midway
between Detroit and Chicago.
So once in a while, if I was in a right mood, instead of going to Detroit,
I had a couple of friends used to go with me.
When instead of going east, we'd go west, and we'd go to the sportsman's park,
or, um, Washington Park, or Washington Park in Chicago.
Yeah.
And stop in Grand Rapids.
They had, uh, Wind Shoe was restaurant.
They were one of my favorites.
And stop for dinner, and then go to the track in Chicago.
And did pretty well in those days.
Two of my side, you know, everybody, not everybody, but most people in life,
who are gambors, they have a period of time when it just,
everything goes right.
You can't do anything wrong.
I remember one time I had 24 consecutive winning nights at Northfield Downs.
I've been on both sides of those things.
Oh, well, yeah.
There's no question about it.
They make up for it.
It's like it would buy it.
It's the same thing.
You have a couple of good days, and then they get it back real fast.
But nothing that gambors are the most unthorned species there is.
That's correct.
You're right about that.
Absolutely correct, sir.
We just keep coming back to track.
They'll drive through a blizzard to get to a track.
Gambors are a lot like cats.
You can pick it up and throw it against the wall, and it comes back for more.
Just, uh, no way to say no.
It won't take no for answers.
That's right.
Well, it's an over too much this weekend, kind of like, uh, you know,
I'm plunging my guts out.
I'm plunging my guts out.
I'm plunging my guts out.
I'm plunging my guts out.
I'm plunging my guts out.
I'm plunging my guts out.
I haven't made a bet in a week.
I'm ready.
Well, that's right.
You got the hurricanes in Florida baseball game tomorrow.
That's the big one.
I won't be betting on that.
No, that would be a real sickle.
If you told me you were betting on that, I'd have you GA,
you'd have to drag your ass away.
Or, nor will I bet on spring training baseball.
Oh, good.
I knew a guy.
He used to call me to ask me if I knew what the pitching rotation was going to be for the Orioles,
on a particular day, because he was betting exhibition baseball.
That guy would end up.
Well, he needs a little action.
That's all it is.
Everybody could use a little action.
Yep.
Well, have a great weekend.
Hey, you too.
I'll see you Tuesday.
I'm taking Monday off.
Don't take any wooden nickels.
OK.
I'll be there.
Be well.
Friday, you bastard.
Absolutely.
Oh, what's the problem, officer?
Deploy from the rear.
If you're caught driving without a seatbelt, you will be removed from your car and shot.
The police now have the authority to enforce seatbelt safety under the new Patriot Act 2.
The new law is in effect now.
So click it or be shot.
Officers don't like doing this.
They are only following orders.
It's for your own protection in the never ending fight against terrorism.
Terrorists act such as mouth noise.
Herpes and fighting.
But be annoying to others.
So under Patriot Act 2, eating will no longer be permitted in restaurants.
Anyone eating outside the designated eating area will also be shot.
It's the law.
We like saying that.
The law.
The law.
The law.
The law.
The law.
You said it.
I love that story.
I mean, I mean, it wasn't a great experience.
It's kind of a helpful feeling.
Try and like eat your bearings on a sheet of ice and you can't take a step, but spit it all around.
Getting an old man holding his hand or offering me to give me assistance to cross the street.
Oh, I can't roll it.
I need it.
Wow.
That was really a wake up call.
And I know a lot of people are saying, well, you always used to make fun of the old people down here.
What are you saying now?
I know they're in a old code.
I got news for it.
It's not for them.
I'm still like a teenager.
No question.
Did he get to be about 90?
Just about everybody's a hell of a lot older than you are.
You've got a walker yet, so.
Not yet, Sonny.
No.
Especially the one.
I like the ones with little wheels on them.
Oh, those are the best.
Well, what are those?
I don't understand what that is.
I guess that's for people who don't have the strength to like, um, pick them up and get up like they could go.
And that's right.
You just screwed it along.
Oh, and I forgot to mention, oh, geez, what the hell is wrong?
We got all whipped up and that thing about the gambling and old people.
The marlins I want to talk to the Humphre about that.
Continuing to explore relocation of hell discussions with the top official from Oklahoma City.
But having decided what to make a visit there.
Well, it's kind of hard to like make a move unless you're going to talk to some folks, you know.
Oklahoma who attended Governor Mary Fowland City yesterday, she's spoken four times to Marlins Vice Chairman Joel Male about the team relocating.
And sent information about the market's demographic economic development.
She initiated the conversations by reading letter to Marlins president David Sampson last November.
Fowland said the Marlins requested information about a stadium financing plan, potential stadium sites, Oklahoma City's AAA baseball team,
their Red Hawks and the city's climate.
I've asked them several times to visit and they said after they receive the packet of information, it'll be considered.
Fowland said there's no planning place to help fund a stadium, but she and the governor are willing to consider it.
Right. In other words, it's all pie in the sky.
What is this casino they keep showing on the certainly Nazi news network? Where is that? Is that in the galaxy? Oh, Harris.
Here in September. Taking a gamble on the return of gambling in the big easy.
Oh, it's in the Netherlands. I didn't realize they can handle it because you know, did you know that?
No, I didn't know.
Well, how come I wouldn't talk to the hopper about that? I thought it was in the galaxy that we're showing us.
They got Harris into Orleans. Well, maybe there might be a reason to go there.
I'll tell you one thing. What won't be a lot of competition for the machines mine. You get a good machine.
Of course, the other thing is they probably got them all set to pay out about 3% because they're not handling a whole lot of money at this time.
At 2.25 yesterday morning, bowling green police responded to a loud party at the Alpha Gamma Roe House at 1436 Chestnut.
I got to figure out where the hell this is. This Orlando during the investigation.
No, this must be a, I don't know where the hell this is.
During the investigation of the agriculture fraternity, police discovered a goat in the basement.
It had no photo water with standing in its own urine and feces.
They took the goat for the Humane Society and charged WKU freshman 19-year-old Trenton decoded Jackson of Henderson with secondary cruelty animals.
Where's Henderson? Is that in, I don't know why I had it.
From WKO13, but I can't figure out on this where to hell what state or what the place is.
Very unusual. Anyway, Brian Peyton is the president of Western's Alpha Gamma Roe chapter.
He says the goat was brought in on a whim as a prank to make some pledges. They would have to have sex with it.
But Peyton says it wasn't a hazing related. No one was ever going to have sex with the goat. Right.
WKU's director of media relations at the university has notified the AGR's national offices
to spend their chapter activities while they investigate.
See, there you go again. The fraternity craft we were talking about here states almost as having sex with the goat is almost as exhilarating as running naked on the beach with your frat bar, our buddies.
But not quite. This is what I'm not nearly right. What the, where is that WKU? Well, somebody read it.
Maybe it's Western Kentucky University. Does that sound logical?
Okay. I'll buy it.
I think it's got a shot. What are you saying?
From minutes after 10, let's take a look at that award-winning schedule.
They we got GELDIETOON. Wow. That is a good way to squeak your way into the weekend.
We got Mad Dog and Gatsby's and Davy at 4. Curtis Stevenson at 7, who is absolutely rock solid and then any K-10 o'clock tonight.
From minutes after 10, we got yesterday's pool 75. Oh, and you know what? I left off yesterday.
I wonder what apologize were off the bat. Obvious ones. Well, there are a lot of somebody cartoons.
Blondie and Dagwad. Oh, yeah. Isn't that bad? That'd be bad. And Andy Cat.
Right. I think well, was an Andy Cat mentioned or did I bring that?
No, he was a handicap. I see. But not Andy Cat. My favorite drunk and wife, Peter.
Right. There you go. Well, you're going to start with those drunk and Irishman comments again. We better move along.
I think it was British. Andy Cat? Yeah. No. Trust me. Andy Cat was British? Pretty sure.
We'll see. I learned something already. I think it was Irish.
When it comes to mattresses, there are a lot of gimmicks out there. The latest are so-called sleep numbers.
Otherwise known as air mattresses. They are called hot air mattresses because they're only warrantied in full for two years.
They squeak like hell. They pop just like that. They can lose their setting during the night and they cost you an arm and a leg.
If you really want a high quality brand name mattress, it'll give you a great night's sleep and will last for years and years.
They call our good friends and dial a mattress like I've been doing for a very long time now. Just call 1-800 mattress.
Because when you make that call, you'll get no run-arounds, no showrooms shenanigans, just factory direct prices and the best brands you know trust and love.

Reese in the sack because you go black you don't go back
I'll be looking down from heaven that night watching the o-horts on less satellites
If we still win well then the heavenly choir will help me bring a ring of fire
Hello I'm Johnny Kitch
Hi Johnny's
Maybe that's why they call them man in black I never really thought of that no more that makes sense before anyway here's a today's pool what movie had the worst ending of all time I'm sure George voted for Magnolia no I did not I added the Blair which
Oh that's right George added to the old one of the top wasn't even on there last night my bad lots because I haven't seen I would say the overwhelming majority of these and I think
Probably just as well you are a lucky man that way yes I am we got 686 votes that means we're gonna go over a thousand during the show again today
Just mention that and passing for those who keep track of these things it's very important for the record book for the anals of American history and the human race
Worst ending to Blair Witch Project wasn't even on there and you added on about I don't know 8 30
8 o'clock 7 45
Okay and it's gone from nowhere to number one 70 hands down man well it may not have been a good ending but at least it was consistent all the way through from when I hear
Easy writer 66 I did see that but so long ago I forgot what about the bad ending war the world's 59 unacceptable
Contact 54 AI artificial intelligence 48 vanilla sky 42 a apocalypse now 31 never got that far and never got close to the end of that
Prandt of the aves 29 is that the part where writing McDowell comes out?
Yeah, they might be talking about the most recent version. Yeah, I'm sure they are which is horrible
I understand but that would have had nothing to do with writing McDowell saving private Ryan 28 to village 25
Magnolia. Oh my god you people's man
Magnolia 22 the abyss 17 Jacob's like see a lot of people don't like Magnolia for getting about the ending
Our people that when they go to a movie they want they want a story that starts here and then's got a middle and there's like some tension
There's some in the drama current and ends here and everybody's got a big smile on their face
Like at the ending of improbable in heroes, you know imaginary hero right which the you know, it's a great movie
But the ending is a little yeah a little severe but it's fine. It has a conclusion
No, no complaints I got no complaints about right, but that's not how all good movies are or even most good movies are like that
It's like for example American history actually does not have what you call the end goal, but man
But it's you know, it's real crap the abyss 17 Jacobs ladder 13
I did see that a very long time ago. I tried twice to watch that, but it's so long. I forget about the bad ending the birds 12
Yeah, the birds well see now that movie is camp because the special effects are so bad
You know, I could draw I could draw little pitches of birds and be a
Dictaneous shot at least shot at better looking birds and nose didn't always hit him
But and then the ending where they just kind of drive off and hear the birds are looking
Oh, you know, it doesn't leave it to your imagination
You wonder what what that'll happen after that, you know, maybe maybe that was like the beginning of the bird flu
You think that could be never thought about it fight club 12 Donny Darko 12 good movie with a horrible ending
I'm not well. I'm acceptable ending. Did you get through watching it or did you not waste your time?
No, I watched it you watch the whole thing. I thought you said you don't watch the end. Oh, you know, you did watch the end
Not good. Mulholland drive 11 talk about bizarre now. There's a movie that's all over the place
Interesting but strange the natural 10 cold mountain nine Chinatown nine looking for mr. Goodbar nine
Well, that's a bad candy bar. You ever have a mr. Goodbar?
Hmm, I love mr. Goodbar. Let the one with the pirate here
Your taste is in your taste, mr. I can't believe it. It's not a good candy bus toffee. What do you call it? Heath bar?
No, and even even those Hershey bars with toffee hmm the anyway stop stop please
The natural 10 cold my just got through in a fish called one to nine the game eight
Another game that was wrong with Michael Douglas, right?
I don't know. Yeah, that was where it's bad. No, it's not the movie is bad. No, it's not the ending is unacceptable
It's a movie is not bad. Get out of here boy. You go eat your air mr. Goodbars
Minority report eight crew is eight Superman two seven the color of money six LA confidential six LA story six boy
A lot of bad endings in LA believe me blade runner five clue for platoon for the contender for 40 days and 49's four
That's what Josh Hartons said the end of the tune was great. What are they talking about the ending?
They didn't like I got most most I got a lot of these off list of bad endings on the internet and all of them had
Explanations of why they hated but I wasn't gonna go through all of that
I even ask you the same question where some of these don't make sense to me
Well, I mean, I'm not I can't speak for other people's taste in a lot of movies that they're pissed off about I didn't see anyway
So the hell of it to just on the list and listen to what some other people agree so they're getting votes the contender for 40 days and 49's four
Just grab it already Josh not you but Josh Hartons just grab it and get it over with the big Lebowski for as good as it gets three
Army of darkness three start us memories three pushing tin two. What the hell is that pushing tin?
It's a air traffic controller movie. I think the close cages in it. Oh you can't cage
God it sounds like something that Jackie Bales were the said pushing tin and Bosnia the heart rate kid to
Four Jackie Bales. I wonder what ever happened to her murdered by death to 12 Angry Men 1 and Red River
Don't have any other 733 vote. It was on somebody's list though red river
12 Angry Men was a great movie but the ending they said that they didn't like for whatever reason and again
I'm not gonna go back to the hole never stop that stuff to find out what why you know who
Kill some good time. No, absolutely no. I got I got a huge pile here today. Maybe I could me got a big fat pile
WQ I am hello
Yes sir
Neil Rogers
This is a movie you keep talking about the motel movie right?
One of the early Atlantic records. Yeah, I've seen that and if you like Layla
I mean that's outstanding when the guy goes to Layla how he produced it. Yeah, that's I thought Layla
American fat stomino
There's a
Cold the criminals with a guy that looks like he more either hot thing whatever that guy's aim is
Looks just like him, but it's not him. Yeah, he looks like
Which is the same movie in French. What is it?
Nine Queens
I know it nine Queens
Clifters was some of that is that a good movie or just a bad ending?
I'm standing and you gotta read the subtitles. You know, I can get by that
No problem if I could handle it in the city of God. I can handle that and criminals is an American movie
We make a bad I guess yeah
I
Know the Greg Reed gang
I
Know you want to leave me I'll tell you what if you have a watch standing in the shadows of motel go out and steal it today and watch it this weekend
I just I just don't know what to say. I mean, I know a lot of people have gone out there and got it
Thanks again to suds for the 4,000 time, but this is just it's like a part of my life
It's more than just a movie. It's a part of my life, you know, I mean because it's motel and of course have a lived in Detroit
Oh
Anyway, go out and get it. I might just play the whole
Joe Nazborn thing
I it works me into a sweat when I listen to that thing
I just can envision her singing it and real in a movie, you know, well play it and go get a towel and all those all those clips
Of course, I guess they're from that concert that they had and I still don't understand what they don't go out touring
And why they don't make a mold for it. They're just not as a party with Joe Nazborn and then just the the band
And I don't know who they're using his vocal. Yeah, but why don't they take those vocalists that they had in there
They're also great except of course for track icon except for her well because they're big names and have careers and what's the other the other chick
That was in her whose name I can't she got all all consonants in her name. She needs a vowel movement Michelle
The one that they use good head right Michelle in DG in jellicol or something like that. Is that how you say archipelago?
It's still in DG O C L L O N X L L S M F T that's right. He's flying tobacco. Michelle mixell clicks it. L S M F T in a lucky strike means flying to

What time is the food show on them?
I don't know, not soon enough for us
I think it's probably going to be slobbing both you all over the mics
Eating those fluffy, constant suts
Sounds awful good to me
WDQYM Hello
Hello, Neil
Yes, sir
How you doing?
Good. I'm wondering if you've had a chance to check out Mr. Lasseter's blog in the last week
I just, you must be psychic because I just exchanged emails with him in the last day
And then I got a response today
He's not doing well, which I'm very sad to see
Very sad and it also, you know, I can't put myself in his position
But he sounds like he's quite down and it's unfortunate
All right, but I can easily understand why he's quite down
But he can reassess whether he wants to do the dialysis or whatever
And it's up to him
Absolutely, well I was very sad to see it
And I'm kind of glad that you guys had a chat on the air a few weeks ago
It was nice to hear, but I do wish him well, he's a good guy
I agree, okay, thanks, pal
Bye, bro. Yeah, I just got a nice response to, I mean, email them last night and then I got a response this morning
Which is nice when people respond to your emails, you know that?
Do I do?
5670560, pound 560
And again, like I admitted to him in my email last night
You know, when I first, remember I first found out that he had all the health problems from the diabetes
You know, you get on the air and you talk like, yeah, we talk
Anybody can talk, but it means, but it means everybody talks
Anybody can talk a good game
It's another thing to practice what you preach
And it's another thing to break life long, bad eating habits or smoking habits or drinking habits or gambling habits or all of these things
So I told him I said, you know, I've been doing the best I can
They lose a couple of pounds, but every now and then I stole it, you know
Because I don't care what anybody says, you can argue all you want
To me, sugar and you find carbohydrates are just as addictive as any drug ever known to a man and woman and child
No question
I mean, it's just addictive
And at whole, the proof is in those pringles spots, you can't eat only one
And that's the idea because they're loaded with chemicals and with stuff that do a tap-drag tap dance on your taste buds to make you want to eat more
So you took, right? If you don't eat any, you're okay
But once you eat the first one, you're screwed, you're going to eat the whole box
By the way, it lays
What?
You can't eat the only one?
I thought it was pringles
It's not a slice
Pringles is once you pop, you can't stop
Yeah, but that's a sexual fact
And just to prove them wrong, the last time I encountered a bag of Lays potato chips
I mean, I haven't had another one
But I don't even like Lays potato chips
I'm serious
In fact, I don't like potato chips in the first place, but in spite of that, if I got one of those tube
A tube of pringles, I would eat probably the whole thing
And you can't say you don't like them?
Pringles, I said
Yeah, I like pringles
No, you don't understand
And I mean, I don't like potato chips, but it's not something I would never go out and buy them
That's what I mean
In other words, it's not like bread
I don't really care that much for bread if I never had it again, but if I go into a good restaurant
Like at Ruth Chris or one of those places, they bring you a bunch of warm bread
With garlic butter
I'm gonna have the bread, you know?
Yeah
Right, here you go
A little less than good garlic rolls like John and Baker's bringing you guys a little while
For your father, for your father
No, for me
Thanks, but no thanks
That's Chicago's answer to the invitation to submit a bid to host the 2008 Republican National Convention
They already had that problem with Nazis in Illinois and Chicago was severed with Skokie
Remember that a few years ago?
Mm-hmm
So they said, well, we had enough Nazis in Illinois already go someplace else
You Republican National Committee said yesterday, Chicago went 30 other cities
Not 30, man
We're selected to submit a bid explaining why they'd be a good choice to host the 2008 Convention
But a spokesman for Mayor Dick Daily said, city hall ain't interested
Jackie Hurd said, city officials are more focused on whether the pursuer campaign was the 2016 summer Olympics
Chicago hosted the Democratic National Convention 96
But there you go
No thanks to the Republicans, the American Nazi Party formerly known as the Republican Party

The worst movie ending you've ever seen
You know, then, and to me, it's just, it's deflating
You spend an hour and a half, two hours, maybe even two and a half or more, hours of your time
Especially you think, huh?
If you actually bought a ticket, you know, and drove all the way out there
That's even worse, or a $20
Even worse than that, if you went out and you spent like 20, 30 bucks for the DVD
You know, that American History X, that wasn't a two for $30 a bid in 50 bucks
Yeah, unbelievable
Oh yeah
We got these HMV, I don't think that's in, you've gotten the States to the HMV record source

Another movie that did not need to be remade, that somebody had to be murdered for doing that
The original you, they get a lot of laughs out of it, trust me when I tell you
I trust you
Especially the scene where he's dressing up like, like mommy
Oh
And where he's eating, where the, I can't go in there, eating the soup and it's got the pictures of the young boys
Frollicking as he said at the young children frollicking no girls, but in the soupables that you know those queens
They gave very artsy fartsy right

And of course they didn't even ask to take breathalyzer test because what would have been employed like the next morning right by the gun cagey
Huh? Right?
What would have been employed?
Couple of old geese go bird hunting in the shooting fishing in barrel with a couple of chicks that aren't their wives
And you know had a little bit snuckered in the afternoon
In fact the only thing that Woodington said is that there was no drinking during the hunting
Well what about before the hunting?
You know how about in the car on the way up to the...
There you go
That's exactly correct
So they got a little sloshed and were like staggering around there and about bang
Yeah, Taney saw something move
And I was that
And I will never get the real story

The color of money 6 LA stories 640 days 49 is 5 and even with Josh Hartnett in there not doing it

It was about air traffic controllers but I can't tell you about the ending I never made it halfway through
Oh that good huh?
I did sit through a snatch last night on Georgia's My Sun's Recommendation
It was pretty good, now I was glad I watched it till the end
Did I watch it? I know I got it in the other room, did I watch it?
You didn't you didn't you would have said so
No, you didn't even tell me about it
You didn't even tell me about it
It's a combination of oceans 11 pulp fiction and Hannibal with a touch of a touch of fight club
That's a good good work and then keep the spirit of Moe alive, chomp chomp
It's just down the floor
Yeah there you go, there's a story
Keep in his spirit alive, okay?
You don't even know me that you bought that movie?
I beg your pardon?
Snatch, you didn't tell me you bought that?
I got it, so I've had that for a long time
Really?
A long time, I've got some of the few movies in there, I bought
What's about Tony gave it a try?
In fact let me go, I'm gonna grab a movie right now, play a little thing
Because I wanted to tell you, it looked, I was in buying stuff the other day
And I don't know about you, well you're a shlupper so you can't afford to do it right?
If I see something that looks interesting to me, I'll just grab that and put it in my pile
And I'll buy that too
Yeah, it must be nice
So, it's a play a little like Ditty or something
And I'll get tired of this, because I had to Ditty
It's Ditty Gritty
Now that you mention it, there's Ditty
You got your jugg, you got your moot head, you got your air
It's called Say Nothing
Okay?
With William Baldwin, Natasha Kinsky and Hart-Bockner
And on the back it says, obsession can't keep quiet
Grace Natasha Kinsky is a beautiful ice model whose merit suffers from a husband, Matt, Hart-Bockner
loses a job and turns to drink
Alone on a chance weekend away, she meets a mysterious stranger William Baldwin
And in a moment a weakness he seduces her
On a return home, Matt has a new job, everything seems gritty
And she suppresses her girl, the size of the best to say nothing, that's the name of the movie
But the passionate stranger has no intention of being forgotten, hillist, for everything that gets in his way
And she's not the target of his danger of obsession
Sounds like fatal attraction, or it sounds like they missed the format, one of those jilted, you know what I'm saying?
By the way, now that you got the movie with her name on it written in front of you
Please sound it out, because I think I've been mispronouncing it my whole life
Natasha Kinsky?
Well I've always said Natasha, but apparently it's Nastasia
Oh you're right, I didn't look at that close to him
All my life
Yeah, it's got an S, Nastasia, yeah Kinsky
And Natasha wouldn't be with the J anyway
Right
Well Josh knows that, he knows his Natasha's
Yes he does, and his name is Russian Chicks
Nastasia, Nastasia, whatever name is Kinsky, but anyway, so I looked it up after I brought it home, I haven't watched it yet
And I'm a little bit of a leery of watching because I looked it up on the IMDB, 5.1 stars
I mean, it's got to be pretty weak, and you know they're all saying, well you've seen fatal attraction, you've seen it's the same old, you know
But it looks like a pretty good cast, right?
Right? You don't think so, huh?
I don't know, it looks interesting
Well maybe somebody in the audience knows what I was doing, saying nothing, and I would have to waste my time watching it
How long is it by the way? So, hour and 34 minutes, and obviously to me that's fine, hour and a half
That's just fine, and I will say this because I also brought this in the same time
A hundred eleven minutes is what, hour and fifty-one, and almost two hours, imaginary heroes
And yet the last time I watched it when I went out and bought this disc, I bought it at IMDB and I watched it again
And it seemed like about 20 minutes, that's how much I enjoyed that movie
It does it right on by, I just like it
56670560, pound 560 on the Virginia and the Alaska wireless line
There is a Santa Claus Virginia, there is no God, but there is a Sandy Claus
Just talk on his beard, he'll scream like hell
Somebody QYM, hello?
Hey, Neil
Yes, ma'am
I wanted to add one to your poll if I'm named
Okay
Unsafeful
Okay
You've probably never seen it for the Richard Gears in it
Oh my God, thank God I didn't see that
The guy in lane is in it and it's the most unsatisfying ending ever
Okay
You know, it can be riveting it some, George, did you ever see that movie?
I don't know
Oh, okay
Another movie
The Richard Gears in it is so it's unlikely, you're probably not
Yeah, I think you only saw the primal fear with him, but I've never seen that one
Okay, thanks
Thanks, have a great weekend
You too
Okay, you see you didn't see say nothing or she would have said something
I've mentioned nobody's seen it
So I guess I'll just one of these very, it says being faithful can be unfaithful can be deadly or whatever it says
It probably sucks
I know, it just looked interesting, you know, I just thought you were reading the blurb on it and that's so William Baldwin was in it
I thought that's probably pretty interesting, you never know until you watch it
That's for sure
In other words, why read those reviews and pay attention
Just like City of God, I enjoyed it very much and read it, I finally did watch it
I give it like a good seven and a half star
A thumb and a half up
Well, that Roger Ebert, he's always stuck in a thumb somewhere
A rectum and usually somebody else from this room
A straight guy on that show
Oh God
Yeah, sure Mr. Jean, that goes to show you there's no God
What was the guy's name, Jean Asiskel?
Yes
He's dead and he had a Roger East
And he was a good guy
And Roger Ebert, just like what, with the last thing we use another mincing queen movie, Critical, okay, give me a break
And then remember who married that black chick for about ten minutes, so for tax purposes
You don't have a crap like that, that scam he had going
Hey Roger, you ain't fooling nobody
In fact, I would be surprised if he's in there with Tom and the John Revolver
This is Neil Roger
You failed
This is 516-Q-A-Z
How far is Falcon?
In theaters now
When a stranger calls
Hello?
Hi, this is Paul from Surprise, Mike Sutter
We have great news for you regarding the content, Andrew
You must be Jill, we were so thrilled to find a baby Sutter at the last minute
That's Paul?
This is Rachel and I'm calling you calling me, actually it's one that you had spelled out at
Keeps I'm calling you safe inside the house
Why are you doing this?
Now what do you want?
Unfortunately, it's time again that we have to finish
Stop calling me
Jill is the police, we traced the call, it's coming from inside the house
Hear me?
She's coming from inside the house
This guy's actually one of our top four major prizes
Who is it?
Oh, yeah, the promo they're sure when I call
It's coming from inside the house
So, my father goes to you and they already tip you off the whole story
Plus, the remake is really bad out here
You want to see the movie Go Get The Original One
When a stranger calls with Charles Durning, you'll love it
It's very good, I give it like eight stars
Now, I think it's bad news for me on say nothing with William Baldwin
Because I just looked at the first review here on IMDB
from Table Addict from the USA
Two out of ten stars, he says E-Gads
E-Gads
I used to think Keanu Reeves was the worst actor in Hollywood
I'm not so sure anymore, Willi Gius Keanu, some stiff competition
with his on made of plaster performance in this movie
Combined that with the fact that he's almost no plot
And on a single likable character
And it's pretty hard to recommend this turkey
Natasha, he writes, not Nastasia, he writes Natasha
Say most people love him
Try your best, but even Julia Roberts couldn't say this flick from obscurity
Avoid it unless it's really late and there's nothing else on
Oh heck, in that case, just read a book
Wow, I can't be more condemning and damning that
And here I got a bitch who has spent 15 bucks maybe more than that
But third man
For this piece of garbage and say nothing I guess
Well, put it in your survival kit and use it to signal planes
There you go, you could spend it on an island
Okay, and just let it across the ice yesterday before Melton
Join George's through our afternoon from 1 to 3pm
Advanced pro shops off I-95 in River Road in Daniel
One to three tomorrow afternoon
And George is so anxious to see everybody
So we get some more of these deals
That he's even welcoming the guy with a funny character
Guy with the eyes, Jack with the hands, that guy with the agupi hand
The firemen were juggling chainsaws
Stop by this filthy opportunity
I'm going to chance to win some really crappy free prizes
The ones that didn't get auctioned off on eBay
5,670, 560, pound 560
And they've rising in singular wireless lines
And sure got quiet on that island, you know?
All much of this info must be over here though
It's just whiter

823 vote
We're going to make it to a thousand, although not...
Not spectacular
Probably because I need to take a lot more calls, get more movies on it
Well, I got too much stuff here right now
Law enforcement officers harvested a dubious record last year
Enough marijuana plants to rank the illegal weed
Is Washington states number eight agricultural commodity
Eging out sweet cherries in value
OOOOOO
The 135,000 plus marijuana plant seized in 2005
Or estimated to be worked to 170 million bucks
A record amount that places the crop among the states
Top 10 agricultural commodities
Based on the most recent statistics available
And I'm sure that the chief timonies son is very proud too
We're struck by the amount of work they put into it said rich Wiley
I wonder if he's kind of Wiley Coyote
Who is the Washington state patrol narcotics program
He's an ARC
Just like they've hit in imaginary heroes, an ARC
It... ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
That scene was great once you won't see it
But he's...
Sigurani Weaver is the best
It's very labor-intensive. They offer run individual drip lines to each plant
They're out there fertilizing them
There you go
A single tank can produce as much as a pound of processed marijuana
Worth an estimated two grand, he'd be saying
So go out to Washington state
And then you can go up to... you can go right up the Hershey highway
To Vancouver, into BC and smoke it there
Right out in public
Dog Thompson, your buddy at the Iran, at the Acapital Hill Blue
Says those bagpipes you hear playing in the background
Provide a much-needed funeral dirage for a freedom which died this week
At the hands of the United States Congress
Freedom has been on its deathbed for about five years now
Mortally wounded and post-9-11 of frenzy that put political
Expeediency above the Constitution and gave paranoid
A supremacy over what used to be guarantees of individual rights for all Americans
Freedom went on the endangered species
Less than the hours following the 9-11 attacks when President Bush turned to attorney General John Ascroff
And said, John, take whatever steps you feel are necessary
To make sure something like this never ever happens again
Turning a zealot like Ascroff, loose on the Constitution, is like giving Bill Clinton the keys to a sorority house
Someone is going to get screwed big time, in this case it was collectively
The whole concept of freedom and individual rights in this country
Ascroff crafted his personal vision of a new America, one ruled by a police state
Reported in ways of a territory in government and called it the USA Patriot Act
It sales through a shell-shot Congress like a fraternity on a panty raid
And gave Bush his gang of thugs all he needed to create a new American Gestapo
Detaining this nation's citizens without due course, spying on Americans without warrants
And setting the country on a headlong rush to ruin
The abuses of the Patriot Act proved so unerased that even fair-brand conservatives like Bob Barr
Joined forces with uber liberals like ACLU to affight it
Late last year, spurred by anger over Bush's admission that he authorized the warrantless spying on Americans by the NSA
The Patriot Act appeared to face serious opposition when it came up for renewal
Congress twice granted temporary extensions and promised to add new language to protect the civil liberties of Americans
But as happens all too often in Washington, these promises vanished into thin air as the Patriot Act this week
Cleared hurdle after hurdle and heads for permanent renewal when the goons who call themselves our elected representatives
Returned from the president's day recess
In the end, in the end, the White House negotiated a set of meaningless changes with a handful of Republicans
And the so-called compromise sailed to the Senate Thursday on vote of 96 to 3
Even worse, the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee successfully blocked attempts to open an inquiry
into Bush's use of the NSA to spy on all Americans
Not that Democrats did that much to stop it
Even those who spoke out about Bush's spying on Americans said they supported the cons that put only a post how the president went about it
As long as he got warrants, they said they didn't really care who the NSA snooped on
And a bunch of Democrats joined Republicans yesterday to keep rights-rapping USA-Pingradect law of the land
Which means virtually no one, Democrat or Republican, conservative or liberal, left or right can claim the high rule when it comes to destroying freedom in the USA
Only Senate or Russ Fine Gold, Democrat or Wisconsin, seems to realize the dangers of the act, continuing to fight and save the law even as amended
Allows the government-fishing expeditions and out-right-allows the government-fishing expeditions had an outright assault on the Constitution
For the most part, the rest of Congress sold out the people elected into office
All Americans who depend on Congress to serve as a check-in balance on the excesses of the White House and the Constitution of the USA
Yes, Freedom did die this week and just about every one of the bishops and bachelors of serving Congress should take a long hard look at the blood on their hands
They stand guilty of high crimes and treason against the U.S. of A. Their trade isn't should be treated as such
Let's send him all the...
Abu Gharr... Ravel K. for this, banking anyway
I'll grab the bus
Got those pictures on our website if you want to really get grossed out if you want to see a bunch of naked and blot it up by Iraqis
And then you want to see the guy with that third foot, that's kind of cute
But I think most of the weekend you'll be spending time to go and duck hunting with a vice president
You want to have to shoot a little bird in the brush
Can't stop that once you get on that thing man, you just can't stop because you can keep picking them off one by one just a beautiful thing
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 and leave a rising singular wireless line

Got a lot of bap bapai to do today
A man on a mission like Howard Beale, I'm saying
A man on a mission
So let's go fishing, all right
WQAM, hello
Hey Neil, I was listening the other day you had a Yiddish lesson on about the roots of the word Fagalong
That's what the chain is buddy, we're hunting, Fagalong
Wow, I'll put that in my pocket to allow later
Well let's get child I'll come and see if he can decode that one
This is Neil Rogers
Oh, this is 5.62 AF
Friday you bastard
And now another verse of celebrity poetry
Here's a tale of lunacy backed by Scientology
No brain cells left in Tom Cruise cupboard for they were stolen by Elron Hubbard
When Tom speaks his mouth it forms affirming his love for Katie Holmes
Up on the couch he jumps with B he thinks he's saying remarkably
His mind looks like a red-war mural prohibiting Katie and epidural
He says others don't use their brain when it's Tom himself who is insane
He calls Matt Lauer cold and glib when it's he who needs a dribble bib
His lady friend smiles her clueless smile she's no smother than bathroom tile
Her eyes too close to teeth as few perhaps she has the avian flu
Feel free if you must to disagree with the teachings of Scientology
But on this my friend we can find common ground their level of brain damage is profound
The facts are strange the future shady for crazy Tom and fiance Katie
This has been another verse of celebrity poetry
I don't know if you saw yesterday but both CNN and headline news they're appendage
They both had a story about that right magazine story that Tom and Katie have split up
About the vehement to mouse and guess what clip they showed on that story from South Park
Oh did they? Oh yes in the closet clip or the other?
That is correct
And I just peed my pants out of so hard it was great
Even the certainly nasty news network and they said all Tom's having some tough times these days
Because everybody knows you're fairy
You're in a closet Tom come on please
Joe Bell puts out a couple of members first of all office hours

Yeah and like Tony Randall did before he finally went to his dirt nap
But Ray Perry just turned 85 and he got a 70 year old son let's hear it for Ray
So it's not a bad idea we like Ray a lot he's a good guy and make sure I get those Panther tickets or whatever it is

No I didn't
Just got that we knew a notice for 2006 and 2007 for next season in the mail
Oh yeah send us some money and we'll give it like 7,500 free tickets
And we'll give you like a whole carton of condoms and a bunch of toothpaste and body wash
Oh I got myself two new flavors yesterday three
Really?
Well that's remember I told him I started going to the drugstore and my sack fell when I slipped on the ice
And I got let's see possessed has got a new one it's called Tangerine or Tango or some crap life
That is really neat stuff all the one I opened it to smell and get the aroma of it I was in the shower
And I farted real bad and so I'm like well I messed everything up you know
So I had to close the container real fast because I want to miss anything good
And then the other two are acts let me ask you if you check those out yeah
I've seen the axes I've used them yeah but these are new ones these aren't in that black container these
There's a green one and there's a blue one
Yeah
In other words they're transparent bottles and the other ones probably the ones you use is in a black bottle
Yeah I go to the ones where the nozzles are kind of angled like a
I've seen a few angled nozzles yeah so I'm thinking yeah they are
That's the part of the investment they have angled nozzles
Quite a bold cleaner there's another product that's what they're in there with me
Anyway acts and they're pretty good I kind of sniffed them both
Jason Leopold writes truth out dot org
Gonzalez with holding claim emails why I got so much stuff that I feel very compelled
Not as not as entertaining as that last caller but pretty good
Sources close the investigation to Lincoln covert CIA agent Valerie Plain Wilson revealed this week that Attorney General Alberto V05 Gonzalez has not turned over
Has not turned over emails to these special prosecutors or office they may incriminate Vice President Dick Cheney and Zayds
Another White House officials who allegedly played an active role in unmasking claims Wilson identity to reporters
Plain Wilson more over these sources said that in early 2004 Cheney was interviewed by federal prosecutors investigating the Plain Wilson leak
And testified that neither he nor any of his senior agents were involved in unmasking her under cover CIA status to reporters
And that no one in the Vice President's office had attempted to discredit her husband of vocal critic of the administration's peor iracking intelligence in other words smear and smear
Cheney did not testify under author under penalty of purgey when he was interviewed by federal prosecutors
The emails Gonzalez is sent to be withholding contained references to Valerie Plain Wilson's identity and CIA status
And developments related to the inability to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq more over
However according to sources the emails contained suggestions by the officials now the White House should respond to what it believed were increasingly destructive comments
The Joseph Wilson they've been making about the administration's pre-war Iraq intelligence smear and smear
I mean why does it have to have all these committees? I mean anybody with an IQ over four can see what that was going on
Yes, well the committee has a national security or the safety of the CIA people write this other crap
It's all smear and smear man just like Nixon with the enemies with the same craft
We're gonna smear him and smear him and if we have to out her in the meantime that's the way to work and to score you know that would be
Got some bad news for you xm people out there looks like Stern maybe I put serious an xm may just vanish and all will they talking with him?
But they got Oprah. No, that's the serious guy is an xm the kind of yeah, well that's right that maybe that's why they're losing the man
The truck driver said fat doing part to increase quarter for ad spending the countered Stern's January debut on rival series
XM's quarter for net loss rose from 190 190 million a year ago to 270 million in fact the increased spending
Drill of XM subscriber acquisition cost from 64 bucks a customer in quarter for 2004 to 89 dollars in quarter for 2005
However, their CEO Hugh Panero said during yesterday morning earnings conference called the company maintained
Yadi yadi all day but to me put a boot put a bob anticipation of a late year media blitz to account comat Stern
And in the litter said to xm chairman gary Parsons pierced Jay Jack Roberts resigned his post and xm's board due to concerns that his

I guess the public out there must be a very alert maybe they all have a list of movies you must
absolutely not watch like broke ass mountain for example and speaking of that yeah little
this harmony going on there does there see I want to preface this by saying all this and I
granted I only watched half the movie but all this big simmiss about Heath Ledger and his great
acting well let me tell you this he may be a great actor but it sure wasn't because of anything
he didn't that movie because he was he was as wooden as a totem pole I mean he was just
you know down an expression was it into the role that you're about to do a little bit you know
didn't do anything but he sure opened up a big mouth let's see now what does this say the red
violin the red violin yeah I've heard of it but I don't know what it's about sitting at the
doctor's office this morning two eighty five year old old conkers are sitting there mentioning
a Rogers and the idea that CNN is evil they call me a moron and said why would you listen to that
mischugana the old people hate you well what else is okay now I'm delighted to hear that I'm
released stimulating their juices to flow a little bit in their bag Ledger says cloney not

hands clean that was a little bit daunting I see I mean you get it all over you man and what
about the pizza you know you know how it is when you tangle with sausage Heath Ledger surprised
the packed Berlin film festival news conference went to that when he remarked that he believes George
Clooney deserves the best supporting actor Oscar this year for his performance in Seriana I'll get
back to you Seriana Jake Hillenall who appeared in Prokback Mountain with Ledger who himself was
nominated for best actor Oscar is also one of the best supporting actor nominees Ledger's remark
came after reporter no to that Clooney had told an earlier news conference at the festival
that he didn't expect to win any of the three categories for which he been nominated he's also
nominated for director and screenplay categories for good night and good luck adding there's been a
lot of uh broke back mountain stuff whatever that means Ledger appearing at the festival to promote
his latest film the Australian produced candy expressed a life that he'd been able to make five
films back to back over the past year and credited director Terry Killian for showcasing his
talents in the brother grim thereby opening up more interesting choices for him he said he found
that working on Australia on candy incredibly liberate it was incredibly liberating in the sense
of it the first film I've done to use my own accent in about eight years he said one one reporter asked
what the difference was for him to be making love to a woman in one film and woman in another he
replied the stubble to which we were told what is that yeah the stubble well he didn't say
where the stubble was you know I say not the first thing how do you like that so he's given a little
stucco to Jake Gillianoff I guess he's probably PO you know and I really don't know which one killed
which one film the movie so maybe that has something to do with it one of them killed the other one

this is Neil Roger and it's Miller this is five six oh like me
Friday you bastard
and now the show that's the antidote to those liberal media distortions of our government
it's the West Texas wing my fellow Americans I come before you tonight to explain why it's okay
for me to easy drop on your telephone conversations you see I only listen to the calls of suspected
outkiter terrorists I'd never listen to the calls of good honest godfair and patriotic Americans
oh oh by the way if Betty Dubois from Pueblo Colorado is watching tonight your husband's cheating on
you with your sister and that nice guy who just moved in across the street he ain't divorced
he's gay but but there's nothing wrong with that you know unless he's a cowboy come back next time
for a fair imbalance compassionally conservative view of our government and action only on
the West Texas wing 1233 27 to 1 a.m. US history judge Marsha Cook refused to set bond today a bond
today for accused terrorists Jose Padilla who used to be Jose Padilla but now he's Jose Padilla
Padilla's lawyers had challenges pre-trial detention and requested that the alleged
jail cutoff would be allowed to stay as mothers Rauer County condo
under 24 hour house arrest cubic defender Michael Caruso argued that Padilla never trained in
any terrorist training camp as the government has alleged and he's not a danger of the community
moreover Padilla's defenceless said the federal magistrate ordered pre-trial detention
should have considered Padilla's three and a half year detention military custody is an enemy
combatant but a beat but a boop but a bomb trial the schedule will begin early September for Padilla
who was charged along with four other men as being a dirty bomb uh slimeball I'ma said deba
can't say deba it's in deba we can't say deba that's what most do do do do do do do do do do do
I am a psych man to do that Eric Alderman writes mainstream reporters tend to see both liberal and
right wing critics as a bunch of winters who just don't get it and in many cases they're right
but being mainstream reporters they tend to believe nay know that they're always right in fact journalism
is just about the only field whose practitioners routinely justify themselves on the basis of the
fact that they receive criticism from both sides the possibility that they might be screwing up in two
or more ways simultaneously appears to be beyond their imaginative capabilities during the past
generation these same mainstream journalists have lurched to the right thanks in large measure
to an extremely well-funded well organized and well disciplined conservative political assault
compromising essentially two tactics a willingness and ability to make life miserable for those who
don't go along and a determination to shape the zeitgeist in such a way that those who do go along
may not even know that they're doing it in other words what Tony Siprano cannot accomplish
leave to Antonio Gramsci while most fair minded observers ought to agree with the above especially
in lot of the rise of the far right media empire of Rupert rush or Riley talk radio etc it's still
pretty difficult to prove most academic studies of media content are compromised because even with
the best intentions it's impossible to control for independent political variables as as for the
decades old studies purporting the show that reporters vote democratic when not by us in the first
place they tell us nothing about the content of the news a number of Rupert Murdoch's top of the
tenants came to be liberal democrats a lot that matters and remember this study does not include
fox covered all this is reason to welcome the new study by david brox media matters for america
hey david do fairy titled if it's Sunday it's conservative mma conducted a content analysis of
ABC's this week with jord step on top of us CBS's face the nation with okey dokey and NBC's
eat the press with a red face to goofball tim rusher classifying each one of the nearly 7000 guests
from bill Clinton's second term George w wishes first term and 2005 is either democrat republican
conservative progressive or neutral it's key finding the balance between democrats sliced
progressives and republican slash conservatives was roughly equal during Clinton's second term
with a slight edge toward republican slash conservatives 52% of the ideological identifiable
guess were from the right 48% from the left but in bush's first term republican slash conservatives
held a dramatic advantage outnumbering democrats sliced progressive 58 to 42% in 2005 the figures
went identical 58 to 42% for the Nazis in addition more panels tilted right a number of republican
a greater number of republican conservatives and democrat progressive been tilted led for every
single year of the study in some years the gap was as high as four to one more over congressional
opponents of the rack war were all but banished from the sunday shows especially in the period
just before was launched when supposed people for the shows were contacted to explain this to
the disparity they claimed that they go where the action is and today the action is republican
slash conservative which should be noted that face the nation was considerably fair than meet the
press or this week but of course were that true then the Clinton years would have been just
until the favored democrat progressives as the bush years have been toward republican conservatives
but of course they're not even close think about it the show is still empowered to engage in a
devastating discussion with the panel of mostly right wing politicians followed by a journalist
panel which conservatives are paired almost exclusively with down the middle reporters rather than
a writer or thinker who might credibly represent the liberal side every week a politically newter

why ask the ma studies author paul walden with the producers of the shows believe that a William

with 27 or Dan vaults with 22 what's more despite having been produced by liberal think tank the
studies grading of the guests where the rubber hits the road is extremely generous to the right
wing side and therefore precludes any credible complaints that it's a product of liberal bias
for instance liberal hater joe cline together with war supporters peter binaid and jorge packer

salon in these times mother jones or even the liberal remnant inside the new republic when you
think about it say tribute to the american people that the remain as receptive to liberal arguments
as they do given how infrequently they hear any of them how do you like that that's what arick alderman

who smells it there this has always been my style
excellent
me
The sweet smell of my food
You don't like what you're telling me
But it's sweet to me
The sin to my father
And he was an empty day
Oh speaking of that
Last week I'm sitting in Woodbuy and there was a young lady who sat down next to me
I swear to you some I don't know where she is from
You've voiced me not some Asian bitch
She sat down next to me and I swear to you far would be an understatement
I think it may have been a lot more serious than that
And just and I sat there I thought for sure I was going to swoon
I mean it's and it just kept getting more and more intense
And usually if you just hold your breath and I put your head off to the side
It'll dissipate after a few seconds and you'll oh thank god
This just kept getting more and more intense which indicates to me that it may have been a little more serious than just a little
Gantt maybe it's a blessing to you
Perhaps a little Hershey Kins back there
Maybe a rosebud
And this guy likes to miss a good bar
Okay
Maybe that's the one
I think you want to see Mr. Goodwrench
Anyway Tracy in Kendall says this is a sad facts
One question about the pull is the worst ending the same as the saddest
No not really
Because if we would have said the saddest in American history
X would have been on there right
Right that was the person
That's the first one
So I have a couple of nominations long lines of million dollar baby
Which I want to because you were George revealed ending
Must have enjoyed that and see it
My nominations are the House of Sand and Fog
Right very much along those lines
Along with Sad or Bad
Sad and pointless
Like why are you getting me involved with all these characters' lives
Just a rip mic
The sun gets inadvertently shot by the pull
East the parents kill themselves
And yet her colleague goes to jail
And for rent
With its ending full of addiction and death from AIDS
Both let me literally depress for hours afterward
Rent is it right
Everybody has AIDS
Yeah yeah yeah
Tracy said
Not to get sad face you says
But I'm one lady listening with things you and George are the greatest
I appreciate how you keep me informed and entertain
Last week it was time to put my 15 and a half year old golden retriever
Hobbs to sleep
And listening to you help keep my spirits up
And even life on such a mild calling day thanks
Very sorry Tracy because there ain't nothing like a golden retriever there
Better than most human beings I've met my life
Yeah trust me
So I'm sorry about that
But the thing that is got to get you a new one right away
I'm not there
If I could have
Well I wouldn't want it
It's too much responsibility
Especially for an old man like me that keeps falling down
You know
But
If I could have pets
You know I'd probably give me a dog
A little dog
Like another minpin like tiny
Not effect
Why don't you get yourself a dog sled
And you want it to worry about falling down
That's a good idea
You know seriously
That's the first time in my life
I'm a hundred years old and that's the first time I've ever been
Outdoors where you couldn't walk
I mean I'm not joking
Oh you
They're got that
The ice was like
Uh huh
Like flickering and snot
Yeah exactly
Yeah
Look at that snot
It's not a sidewall but it's not
Frequently yeah
Good God it was banned
And the old man extends this hand
And we could take my hand
I don't know
I don't want to take your hand pal
They get
But isn't that typical of these people
It's just being a nice guy
It picks up the items
I fell out of my bag
I opened up the sack
He put them back in the very
And I was wondering to myself
How come this old guy is standing
You know
How come he's moving around
And he's not flopping down
Maybe he had gulashes on or something
He probably has some grippy shoes
There you go
W-A-M had a maybe teeth
Q-A-M hello
Hello, Neil, how are you
Good
You're doing a good job today pal
I'm always doing a good job sir
I'm sure
Just asking how
The biggest heartbreaker
The ending of the movie is a terminal
I just thought that he was going to get the woman
And I just thought it was going to be beautiful
But it was that one
Yeah
You know Tom Hanks
No, I wouldn't see a Tom Hanks movie if you'd been
I got a tragic beginning when I started
And I thought it was Tom Hanks
Oh yeah
That always ended for me
And then for all you football fans
Friday night lights
Just a terrible ending
Okay
Or just a terrible
Okay, thanks paly
Thanks Neil
What do you mean just terrible?
You saw a football movie
I saw a football movie
Oh no
And it sucked
Why
It was armed
I mean you're a guy that won't watch a football game
Why would you watch a football game
I don't want to lose my games
But I will watch movies
You see
About people playing games
And that's the important part of the movie
You want to take golf
But maybe you watch golf on TV
Now you're going to finally admit
You have the closet on that
No
No
No
It's a movie
You understand it
It's a movie
And the fourth part of the club
The club is the jack Nicholas story
You'll go and see that
The time you go to the store
I'm going to get
A movie about golf
Right
I'm going to camp out to get the tickets for it
Right
I'm going to tell the people
You know what I'm going to see that
What about the Eddie Koalor story
By the way
The movie Friday night lights
What about the Volmar story
What about
I can go see the Bob Volmar story
Bob Volmar was a driver at
The Potato Downs in Buffalo, Raceway
Dick Fienberg will tell you all about Bob Volmar
He'd open up about 15 lights
Leading the backstretch
And in the stretch
They'd have to bring out a tank of oxygen
For the horse and the driver
That's called puking in the stretch
What is that that you're playing
It sounds like once upon a time in America
Close, it's Andy in pipe music
But that's made by Andy
I'm never the scene
Yes
It was an opium trip
You just wasted four and a half hours
If you watch the unexpergated version
Once upon a time in America
It's a great movie though
Noodles
It's a great movie
That really
Every time I think of noodles
It's a long movie
You don't think it's a great movie
No I thought it was adequate
But it's just way too long
Oh my god
Addiquit my ass
That's not what I heard
No you're confusing it with
That one with Dale Puccino
Dog Day F Newy
It's Addiquit
He said way with the Hanky
Addiquit
Everything
It took me three tries
To get through the long version of it
And then he said
I'm dying on my face
So now two
That's what I went
That's what I had to endure
Is it because it's to that
To get through
And as you didn't like when James Woods got ground up
In the garbage truck at the end
There were a lot of things I liked about the movie
All the way through
But as a whole
I didn't like the thing where he calls him
You know he missed your
You know
But because he's a big politician now
And he like pretending that they don't know each other
Well what's that
Well what is that
There were a lot of good things about the movie
But overall it was overblown
In addition to which when you told me that James Woods
Was Jewish after his poor performance in her
But that Puccino took us
Well what kind of a Jews is Puccino took us
I don't know maybe Jesus really
Well I explains it
WDQYM hello
Hello Neil how are you
Pretty good
Do you have anyone tell you about saying anything yet?
No please do
What do you want to know
Well how is it? You saw say nothing
Oh yeah say anything
That's what
Well what do you want to know about it?
It does have a sad ending
No I'm not talking about that
I just bought the movie because it looked good
I was in the videos of the story you know
And I bought it and then I read the reviews
The reviews all absolutely say it sucks
So I'm just curious is it worth watching or not
Well that depends on you
I mean it's about a couple
And stuff like that
I don't want to ruin it for you
Well I was going to scale up 10
How many stars would you give it?
I would say probably a five or six at most
I'll give it a shot
My containing was sale give it a shot
By the way the last American Virgin does have a very very sad ending
Okay
But it also has a lot of great music in the late 70s and 80s
And George was right
The guy did Hawk the stereo
To get the role and abortion
Yeah I like George Borschted in Texas
What's wrong with that?
Okay thanks a lot Pally
Really he has the stereo too?
I don't know he hucked the Chinese
5670560 you self-hating Jew
Maybe hucked the loose W people really cracked me up
That goes to show you when you eat too much kosher
You know
Little kosher is okay a little bit of deli is good
But too much kosher you'll be doing oil or clogs
All over your life
You'll be doing quintupled bypass pretty soon
Especially on those cheese blunts
Man I sure love those
Oh god
Do you ever have cheese blunts?
Of course
The great
What do you mean of course
Do you remember the villa deli used to bring out this?
Oh boy
That's brilliant
Never be the same man
It's the villa deli closed life will never ever be the same
Oh my god
They had a kishki that would just tear your kishki
So just the food there
Right
The system believe it
That German food sure is good
I beg your pardon
You know blunts is

I know that we're trying to like extend a hand of friendship to this floor to crowd
It's like that even on the Friday man
Sunny shining here all that ice is melted away to now to not a flake us
No, it looks like the middle of summertime until you walk outside of course
Wonder what the temperature is right now. I'm sure that
Castor Nova is taking notes on the Toronto weather
Let me take a peek at sunny. It's beautiful. It's minus five. What is that about 26?
I would say that would be my guess. I'm not too good at it minus stuff
I know all the plus numbers
Yeah
Again to minus 20 is like 28
That's even be like 24 or something like that
And windy so it feels like yeah about 10 below zero
But other than that looks really good. Nobody Q a m. Hello
Hello. Yes sir
Yeah, yep
The worst ending ever
The Truman show
Okay
Harris's character should have had the sap killed off
Okay, thanks. That sounds like a Jim Kiri movie to me. It is that it works
I know whatever I know what it is and the same thing he's happening over and over and over
And I never saw it. You want to know why? Because just like we feel about
Tom Hanks actually about Jim Kiri. Well, maybe not exactly the same
No because once upon a time I actually liked Jim Kiri a little bit
I used to like Tom Hanks. That was a long time ago. I liked him in the fish called Wanda
That wasn't the movie. It was in the whatever it was with the the mermaid splash splash
Well, that's pretty complicated. Splash. Who was in that who played the mermaid? Darryl Hanna. Where Darryl Hanna?
There you go. What's he from a Hanna Barbarra? No. Anyway, she was that was pretty good. It was cute
It wasn't a good movie but it was cute, you know, and she was in there and I'm sure you like that
But that was it and after that he shouldn't just gone away, you know, just like Greg Reed

And want to bring up I'm sure you heard the hermaphrodite polar bears that are from the pollution. Have you heard about them? No
Okay, well up in the Arctic the polar bears have
mutated and a lot of them become hermaphrodites because of the
air pollution
flying up there and then falling in rainwater into the food source and then they eat it and they become poison
We're murdering everything up in the Arctic
The glaciers are melting a twice the
My pile whose matter-fac Greenland's the glaciers I got to sit right on my fist. Yeah, and
Basically we're destroying the planet fine
Wouldn't it be great if it would be selective in its retribution because you know
We're getting killed by global warming and
Cal and crazy bird and all this both
Wouldn't be great if it just
Unloaded on all the bastards that are actually doing the damage and the people in power
Well, the repair is serious. Well, it's fine. Just keep that in mind. He works in mysterious ways
Just one thing conservation dot org the conservation international you could donate to that
I think they do good stuff for the environment. I'm pretty sure they're a solid organization
They work with big corporations to get them to do good stuff instead of screwing everything up
So you might want to link it on your website. I want to check it out
But I figured I'd give you the heads up on that. Okay. Thanks. Thanks. Okay
Hulgettry for Jesus, baby because they destroyed a planet
Greenlands later glaciers are dumping more than twice as much ice in the land. Do you see the store in the news on this last night? No, scary
Ah, they're dumping more than twice as much ice into the Atlantic now as 10 years ago
Because glaciers are sliding off the land more quickly researchers said yesterday
This could mean oceans will rise even faster than forecast and rising surface air temperatures appear to be the blame the researchers
Reported today's issue of the journal science
glaciers around the world are disappearing fast several researchers told a meeting of the American Association for the advancement of science
Greenland is probably going to contribute more and faster to see level rise than predicted
Eric Rigno of NASA's yet proportional lab at the California Institute Technology told news conference
Between 96 and 2006 the amount of water lost from Greenlands ice sheet has more than doubled from 90 cubic kilometers
Our kilometers to 220 cubic kilometers a year one cubic kilometers the amount of water LA uses in the year 200 cubic kilometers
Of water is a lot of fresh water Rigno said other experts agreed this could mean that scientists have underestimated how much the sea level rise in the future is the planet warms
At 1.7 million square kilometers at 656,000 square miles up to three kilometers nearly two miles thick and little smaller than Mexico
The Greenland ice sheet would raise global level sea level by about 22 feet if it's not completely
22 feet in other words
Bye-bye Florida
Forget about New Orleans bye-bye Florida
And of course bye-bye Amsterdam and bye-bye a lot of places, you know, right in the York L.A.C
There you go the state of Nantes, Florida is causing the rising air temperatures in Greenland
But most scientists agree that human activity notably the burning of fossil fuels is playing an important role in global warming
Is it the right doubt is if there has to be debate on this
They've calculated that Greenland contributes about two hundreds of an inch that's half a millimeter
A silly little millimeter to the annual one-tenth of an inch rising global sea levels since 96 southeast Greenlands
Outlet glaciers have been flowing more quickly and since 2000 glaciers far the north have also sped up
And then of course someday somebody will write a story about how God got angry again
And we had the big flood everybody drown. Hey, Noah get the arc ready. Okay, maybe get a hammer and some nails
And start grabbing you know a pair of zebras and a pair of hippopotamai and you know
pair of this and a pair of that and don't pick Tom Cruise on there either if you want to like
Perpetuate the human race. They sure you get a pair of keats. Yeah a pair of what? Oh keats
I thought you said with a tea. Let's take keats with a tea pair of those a good two
Yeah, always have one of those on there too kind of like stimulate a little bit reproduction something

I mean, there's about as much chance to get in the truth out of that story
Just like a yo Kennedy came back after chape aquatic the next day and decided to show up at the police station and make up his own story
Well, that's what's going on here
No one will ever know the amount of carousing and boozing and smoozing and cruising and losing

This is
Pericolves the watch boobs and butts and boi
I'm driving all day long and sometimes it's all the world
Like a
You know
vä
But
There's a reason why chucks don't cover the dare we hear.
I'm a home on the rain just where.
Like a perfect house.
Oh, speaking of that story, about that kid that died in Panama City.
Authorities raised a videotape today showing guards restraining a boy
to juvenile detention bootcamp just hours before he died.
The parents of 14-year-old Martin Leanderson believed the footage
from a bootcamp security camera will show that guards beat their son to death.
They were viewing the one hour 20-minute tape at their lawyer's office in Tallahassee
as the FDLE made it cubic.
How do you like that? There's a love tape for it.
And there's that chaining.
There's another very prominent building.
God. Oh, and there we go again.
The shooting was the worst day of my life.
I quote, I had a very long weekend.
Thankfully, Harry's on the man.
They didn't catch us with the brawds.
I didn't do the breathalyzer because we made him a staldermil next day.
Get out of here. You lion sack of garbage, you man.
I'll never forget as long as I lived there.
I wasted all that time before in 2000.
I read pages and pages of that book about this guy a thousand times worse than bush.
This is the evil doer right here.
The other one's just a knitwit.
He's just along for the ride on his name.
There you go.
And of course, you know where this is, no, it's just in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
Right. That's in his hood where he'll feel safe.
56670560.560 in the Verizon.
See, look, they got it.
So yesterday those 39% of America who just refused, don't confuse them with the truth, you know.
Nasty, bigoted, right winged, obnoxious, Bible, Fump, and hypocritical, closet, queen, bastards.
Whatever the hell they are. They all got their thing.
WDQA Am hello.
Oh, God. Yes, sir. How you doing? Great.
I am really appreciate the Eric Altraman article that was terrific stuff.
It was good.
I got to tell you in the next six months with the 2006 election coming up, it's
we're going to hear all these stories about how China is building up their military.
And I ran, building up their new...
I say, let's bomb everybody.
Oh, you know.
I got one question for you.
And I think you mentioned the talk about it.
Did you hear the story that he was with, that Cheyenne was with this ambassahor or something?
Old bag, yeah. She looks like Harry Wittington. She looks just like the guy he shot.
Yeah, well, I sent a state department an email on that so they could verify the whereabouts
as one of their ambassahors.
I haven't got a reply yet.
Yeah, I guess I'm going to be registered soon.
Yeah, I know it, bro.
And they probably have, listen on this call right now.
I guess we'll see.
Thank you.
Don't answer the door.
In fact, if I was him, I'd be packing a piece.
Piece of what?
And look at that bitch, Kira Phillips.
Seriously, her and Tina Bash.
I don't know which one I'd like to bash their brains in if I could find them. Probably in their ass.
Oh, I can't see it. Thank goodness.
Why don't you check out one thing?
I don't want to hang out there or other side and Dick Taney on the other.
I got a baby bitch fest.
I couldn't prove it to them on the side.
And I mean, I did it on the other side.
What he's doing is he comes out of a hospital, a little dog in a pony show, another photo off.
He's showing that he's still alive.
And there's Taney on the other side.
And I'm going to try to do a little damage control here.
A lot of damage control.
And now we get rid of them off the screen.
Now we have to look at this bitch.
Oh, seriously, she makes Eva Brown look like a good Samirin.
Kira Phillips.
Oh, I bridge painted her dangles from the Jamie Bridge in St. Louis, Missouri, just in the CNN.
And also another dog got lost.
Really?
Oh, my God.
Now, here's some good news for the wife of Dolphin's lineman will not press charges in that domestic violence case.
Gotta get the correct update.
Okay.
Damian McIntosh.
I'm sure he's one of Josh's favorite football players.
Yeah.
The Dolphin's offensive lineman was arrested at his debut home yesterday when they charged with domestic violence.
For literally knocking his wife to the floor was released from jail today and his own reconnaissance is there.
That's today.
Or I mean, yesterday, McIntosh 28 told officers he and his wife were arguing and he pushed her to the floor.
According to a police report filed after his arrest, 1041 Wednesday morning, McIntosh told police his wife hit her head pretty hard.
His wife, precious to Thomas McIntosh, was taken to Cleveland, clinic in Western, released the same day.
Precious to Thomas McIntosh.
Uh-huh.
I wonder if she's keen to fancy on passions.
Precious fancy.
I'm Thursday.
Precious McIntosh said he wouldn't press no charges.
But I mean, put a book around itself.
And I do like to part about how when they got there after she called from the back room, McIntosh led them to the bathroom where his wife was unre-sposited with a face down on the floor.
No charges be a lead.
Okay.
WDQYM.
Hello.
Bill.
Yeah.
Hey, I just want to let you know Jimmy Hopper.
The mock is red in Bluefield Township, Maple and Calligraph.
Yeah.
And then last night I made a Rio accident.
790s of ticket.
Yes, 790s of ticket.
Was broadcast in Olympic hockey game, US versus Latia at 12 midnight last night.
Wow.
That's how you get good ratings.
I don't do it every time.
Man, that US live field game.
Well, I would say if I don't know, I stayed up.
Uh-oh, four workers run a bridge when a scaffold broke there in San Luis.
Okay, it's big news.
Let's hop right on it.
Everybody start running around and circle.
Don't forget.
When in question or in doubt, run in circle, scream and shout.
And should I say, don't want to get money?
Don't, please don't go see that broadcast mountain.
Don't rent it.
Don't buy it.
Don't watch it.
And it's, and it's got, it really has nothing to do with that.
That part of it.
That's the least of the problems.
The most of the problem is, ponderous and it is slow.
And it don't go anywhere.
The acting is as dull as a 40-year-old razor blade.
Okay, it is just bad.
I mean, let's, you know, we get excited about watching about the sheep running up and down the mountain.
And the dog, the sheep dog.
If that turns you on, man, you'll love it.
If that's your cup of tea.
Otherwise, forget about it.
W.A.K.Y.M. Hello.
Hey, Neil.
I just got an update on Dick Cheney.
Yeah.
Yeah, he suffers from TCB.
Yeah.
Typical crack of behavior.
Okay, excellent.
What do we hear at that?
Wow.
Yeah, you're the one, man.
I'm the one who said you're the one.
You said, take us in and these calls are going to be fabulous.
And you're right there.
They are.
I wouldn't say fabulous.
I'd say there is special.
Each one is special and so on right.
You wish you could put like a little package and put like a little ribbon on it.
Welcome back, Ray Perry.
By the way, thanks, Ray Perry.
Back is a good guy.
We have no idea what he used to do, but now he's actually going to do a little bit of work.
This is Neil Wright.
How this is 5.60 Q.A.K.
A consultant?
Yeah.
Absolutely.
I like to go fishing inside the shower store.
Slipside and I go fishing.
And slapper off the wall.
I've been going over for quite a few days at my place.
But I must do small, tiny things all the way here.
Boy, you're just on my list.
Where they could shower, where it's going, far away.
I like to go to the shower.
And square, square, and square.
Making a go to the shower.
I like to go to the shower.
I used to drink a damn beer before I start to scrub.
I used to rub my wee wee with a pair of blue products.
When we look at the clothes, they feel so wet and warm.
I used to see these as a street.
When I came myself in my own order, you can act as I just started.
When I came to a shower, I started to play.
I like to go to the shower.
I don't want to say that these appearances, these speeches are contrived.
But there was Chinese speaking in China and my woman in his own place.
And look where your president is speaking right now.
In Tampa, Florida, with a group of steppered wives.
And you notice everything he says, they're all like nodding,
just like the steppered wives and guys.
To enable us exactly in Tampa, no less.
And you can be sure that they were all like cherry picked and brought in by invitation only.
And Frist and whatever else.
Okay, moving with the worst ending, here's the top by handful.
Do you want a small handful?
The blabbered project 99 that was George's pick was nowhere this morning.
And now it's on top.
Easy writer 88, given it a little run there.
War the world's 87, we got a good battle going on, man.
Contact 71, AI, artificial intelligence 64, and vanilla sky rhymes with AI 57.
Apocalypse now 43.
I hate this pool 42.
I know it by the way, only S31.
Okay, so that's where we are right now.
I think it's a good pull.
East the J didn't fasten it.
It is pulled really sucks today like yesterday.
What was wrong with that cartoon pulled yesterday?
Nothing at all.
The only thing was wrong with it was I take full responsibility.
We left off Andy Camp, but especially Blondie and Dagwood, my gut.
My whole childhood.
From the time I was like old enough to look at the funny paper like in the Godfather.
Two about 50, you know, when I was no longer a child.
Every time you open up with the comic section at the bottom of the front page would be Blondie.
Right? Right?
Wasn't it always?
Maybe not.
Maybe not every newspaper editor, but sure and a Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.
Which we didn't get the Times Union because that's a bunch of Republicans, okay?
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Find a wheel.
That's what that sounds like.
Oh, is that?
It's not.
It's Blondie, baby.
Oh.
Oh, Blondie, oh, no.
Well, you brought it up.
I wasn't bringing up them, okay?
Just, okay, that's Blondie.
Now, I guess that's where that thing came from, the Dagwood sandwich.
Yes.
I know that.
I'm just saying, just don't.
I mean, because you were eating at the sloppy sausage.
No, I had all that good stuff from Dr. On the Baker.
Like I said, baked ziti made it in their vest.
And Josh was eating the same, huh?
Yes, I don't understand why you guys don't get different stuff and like mix and match.
You know, it's sweet.
The flour is like mustard
or salt.
When it's sweet.
I mean, it's, like, the soft industry.
Like vaisager though, you know, rich folks like beginning to make the building safe and
Yeah, but, you know, I wanted to admire you guys because I could add that trainers would
Right I just want to have them as toothbrushes and that kind of example or like one of
and then the other guy went in the middle he goes to the parenthouse and he can
smell a big shirt so stupid oh my god he's definitely sure oh my god
bloody the bloody shirt they have to fight in it was so at least it is if his
pantaloonies is VVD's anyway thanks for the band is so he's the victim of
gay bashing yeah well I see that's the interesting part of it is because
both of them got married you know so it was like George is always saying that
a guy who's straight can they only can wander around on the side is that what
you're always saying yeah that's what I'm always saying with the sheep so he got
killed and I'm like a genius like what's always the movie with Harvey
Firestein and Demantue Browderick towards Andregy now you know that but you never
saw the movie no you don't want to see the books of it around all the time
that I just want to be loved is that so long we've seen that a billion times

bird inside okay Europe puts poultry indoors is bird flu cases multiply you know this
this really cracks me up the the way that they're getting us just everybody hysterical about this

Europe threw up protective zones to keep the ever expanding bird flu from spreading the humans
and devastating the continent's poultry industry even as researchers warned a future pandemic could
kill a hundred and forty two million people worldwide a future pandemic could kill or not Romania
was deemed especially at risk of human infection the WHO announced today with bird flu reported at
thirty one separate sites Romania runs the risk of human contamination any moment a WHO expert
Guinalr Rodier said at the end of a four day inspection tour but even though it says runs the
risk of human contamination that still doesn't say or even imply human to human contamination follow
that okay and I mean they're not even putting that in the stories anymore have we read about one

elections allowed die-bowl election systems to operate its touchscreen voting machines during
the state's 2002 gubernatorial election and the 2004 presidential primaries before the state
agency actually certified the controversial machines according to recently disclosed documents
and come to find out they weren't good machines mine that is a violation of state law according to
the shady I wonder she's kind of slim shady executive director of trueboat MD dot org an election
integrity group election integrity is not like an oxy moron what is Barbara star she's a guy to
one quote that say so I'm saying it's a guy shade shade whatever name is discovered the
document among thousands of others she recently acquired through a lawsuit filed against the
Maryland state board of elections in 2004 after almost two years of public records of request
and attorney wrangling she we see four boxes filled with email conversations faxes and contracts
between the elections officials and die bold the anxious die bold well I got to play that so far
we've only gone through one box and have just started the second box she said Wednesday we've
specifized much more meanwhile republican uh governor Maryland Robert early junior delivered a
scathing letter to the state board of elections Wednesday lashing out of the agency for
intended to use die bold systems for the upcoming 2006 election while Californian Pennsylvania
either desertified or refused to certify the voting systems which recent studies show can
easily be hacked to manipulate votes that that that I no longer have confidence in the state
board election they conduct fair and accurate elections in 2006 the republican governor stated in
a four page letter how do you like that the republican governor of Maryland no longer has confidence
in die bold because the fix is in
just
I'm thinking of Captain Harris. What was the vision Tommy's planning of her, uh, Theresa
Newer? Theresa Lapur would those, uh, butterfly ballots, although butterflies are free. I think
people ought to give a Theresa maybe a butterfly kiss right on the, uh, on the ass. You stop and
you think back to all that and then of course those maniacs from out of state who got
sent in. What else then? What else in? Dave County pounding the doors down because they wanted
to make sure the fix was in and it was two fixed presidential elections in the world. Confidence
is low for the outcome of the, uh, midterm elections this fall. In fact, I got news for it because
of these special powers that, uh, your president and vice president keep, uh, asserting that they've got.
I think they might just decide to call them off altogether. Wouldn't surprise them. We've got
an important fish to fry. We got to attack Iran and China and Syria, Canada. Jesse Jashin and
Condo Leisure Rice get the top support among Blacksassed and Indonesians. Most important Black leader,
according to an AP AOL Black voices pool next come Roland Cole and sell out Powell and Barack Obama.
Many Blacks question whether any one person can wear leadership mantle for such a large and diverse
group of people. Even Mickey Mantle couldn't wear it. That's why Willie Mays had to come along.
At the same time, two thirds of the polls that leaders in their communities were effective
representatives of their interests. When Blacks were asked to come up with the one person they
considered the most important Black leader, 15% chose Jesse Jashin. Nobody picked Reggie Jashin or Michael
Jashin. Who did mold a civil rights activist who ran from president in the 80s, uh, Jackson? Well,
like we need to find out who wrote this APU idiot. While 11% picked Condo Leisure,
8% Colin Roland sell out Powell with his vile comments and 6% named Barack Obama Freshman
Democratic Center for Illinois. About a third decline of all interior name like we don't know.
Less than one in five of those pulled only 18% said the current Black leadership's doing a very
effective job. A representative Black community. They are absolutely correct. I'm kind of dissolution
said, retiree John Manning who says the leadership is somewhat effective somewhat. The
Democrat from Port Charlotte Florida added they seem to be going in different directions.
There doesn't seem to be a cohesiveness and that's because they're all busy grand standing. Wait
to hear your well-scottes and votes. You're going to pee in your pants. You're going to have a
wet spot on it's here where Randy left that stain. Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan got
4% talk to Oprah Winfrey got 3% King who was killed Martin Luther King's union 68% got 3%
I don't understand. He's dead. Still dead. And former Democratic presidential candidate L Sharpton got
2% 14% picked somebody else. 3% said Oprah Winfrey is the most important Black leader in America
today. I can't even what they probably already read that book. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.62.8.
Neil God.
All right. Don't lie. All the Harper.
Oh
Red.
I don't know how to talk about that.
That pre-tarded damn witch.
Absolutely.
You don't have a talk about that.
Oh, you're not TV.
He's President of the fucker.
Republican muscle is in our table.
It is.
I don't know why they want this young,
but no, he's the only person who's left for you.
Rectum.
President of the fucker.
Republican.
Republican.
Oh, what I get to,
the vote goes wrong.
And get to we go vote it wrong.
Did you want this?
Don't know, no.
It's rummaging stupidity.
Don't know, no.
Oh man, this drunk in rich kid.
Don't know, no.
He's even.
Over them me.
He's President of the fucker.
Yeah, don't care what it does.
You got him in by hook or croak.
The Christian.
Right.
Don't know what the fucker you and I
are but you're no fear.
We're about a great leader.
President of the fucker.
President of the fucker.
Abugaro.
Rem.
Do do do do do do do.
Abugaro.

Bye bye bye!
