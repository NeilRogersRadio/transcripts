Everybody's life on it,
that we still beat the crap out of those idiots across the street.
And by the way, hit the very beginning of the news to you, Joel,
but your team really blows.
You know?
I mean, see, I'm one of those guys
when my team stinks the joint out like the Patriots lives.
Like, I'll tell you, they were pathetic.
It was an embarrassing loss.
They can't be done, but even in a fixed game.
This is just one of those things.
Huh?
I said, this is true.
And the same with the Josh's team.
They're the stunt to join out and play with the game.
They were the team and the game.
They were the team and the game.
They were the team and the game.
They were the team and the game.
They were the team and the game.

I don't know. He's no more paper in there so you wouldn't have to compare for this.
one moment please. What an idiot.
Jesus.
Jesus.
Jesus.
Jesus.
see, Anthony, do we even care about these, I mean, we'll kill some good time.
I don't think the audience cares about this.
Here's the poll from Friday.
Who's your favorite communist or commentator?
By the way, do you know Molly Ivans has cancer?
No, I did not.
Oh, she just buried her good friend and Richard, and she also has cancer, but she's okay.
For now, who's your favorite like Carriva?
Favorite communist or commentator?
Keith Olberman kicked ass, baby.
He just wiped the for up with a competition.
500 and seven.
We have 1659 votes.
Don't have one, 290.
Maureen Dowd 179.
Michael Moore 85.
I hate this poll 80.
Molly Ivans 54.
Bill O'Reilly 53.
Oh, Doug Thompson, capital hill blew at 53.
Al Franken 51, blue, dobs 44.
Rush Limbaugh 38.
Paul Krugman 35, Greg Pellas 33.
Frank Ritz 33.
Ariana Huffington 29 and colder had 18.
Oh, what would we like to find them to?
Round him up.
Tom Hartman 16.
How about that crowd of the dolphin gay man yesterday?
They must have been mostly were like invisible ring coats.
They have about 16,000.
Wow.
Every day.
I didn't watch much of it, but every time I flipped over there,
there was like, oh, they must all got out of our burger or something,
because there's nobody there.
Thomas Friedman 12.
Katrina Fanden Hovel 10.
George Will 8.
Robert Novak 6.
Fast.
Robert Fisk 6.
Michael Medved 6.
That's disgusting.
David Korn 4.
David Broder 3.
David Brooks 3.
Ed Naha had to.
Bill Press had only one.
And John Nichols out of almost 17 other votes had none.
So they don't read.
I guess there's no point in us putting his articles on there from the nation
because they don't read them.
Or maybe they like him.
Okay, just not as much as say like, you know, and colder, the credible people.
Right.
Let's see, three to 7 p.m.
I'll radio on more.
Well, we must have had a really bad, the August, you know what?
And of course, now we got the story.
We can say, oh, well, that's when we chapter that, that's when we got where that
format we changed it all around.
So just wait till next time.
Of course, next time we'll be losing drop off that big June.
So I'm thinking the summer book is going to be at the disaster.
But that's just what I'm thinking.
You know me a little bit too honest for comfort.
Look at that.
Afternoons, or 2.2 for INZ.
That's a scare America and Q.
I am a 1.3.
Oh my God.
Well, that's because they got all the old parts and waxy a 1.1.
So we just barely edge them up.
But again, nobody cares about persons 12 plus.
I have no idea where they're with my facts paper.
Gotta cut down all these maple trees.
Very depressing.
Why do I see the panties lost again last night?
At least they're consistent.
They have one next division.
They're only a submission game.
They have one one yet though.
It'll be nice to win one.
You know, it'll be good just to make it look good.
Any interest?
No.
Wow.
Marlon's made a hell of a run and by the way,
Joshua apologizes for giving me bad information
and making me look bad on Friday.
When I try to tell him the schedule is wrong.
The schedule is said they played at Philly on Friday and Saturday.
They've been at Atlanta on Sunday and Josh jumps right in there.
Oh no.
It's that's right.
The schedule is right.
They know.
And I guess what?
Listen, I trust it.
It's the way I'm scheduled.
That's my world.
You mean you haven't learned your lesson by now?
Clarence wouldn't know a schedule if he shoved it up his
and it would be the first time either.
Let's see.
Seven of midnight, do we care about that?
No.
And then who the hell did I hear going on about?
Oh, it was Kenny Walker or poor Kenny.
About how you know the Marlon's doing great
with their numbers on radio and TV.
You know, they're not.
They're doing great with their numbers on radio.
What numbers are you looking at, Kenny?
It's one thing to suck around, man, but cut their crap.
I had high hopes for him too, but now I realize it's a sports show.
By the way, Ben Laden's dead, Castro's dead.
Our morning show is dead.
I've been mad.
But boy, we got mad dog at two.
We got, we're back from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
And we're going to kick some ass, right?
In this next trend.
When did we start August 20th?
Maybe that last month of the summer book
is going to goose us back up there again.
Because when you look at 12 plus and we're tied for like 24th.
Overall tied for 24th.
Do you have any idea how embarrassing that is?
Or did I make a mistake on that?
No, I know we're 23rd.
Excuse me.
We're 23rd.
We beat out, Erica by a full tenth of a point.
12 plus 1.6 to 1.5.
Boy, how the mighty of fall.
Nice going, Joe.
I'm telling you, one good thing about this crew, man,
they don't waste any time.
They come right in.
They run like a house on fire.
And they really started making moves and doing, no, they didn't.
And they still haven't got a clue.
That's a sad part.
Here's our poll today.
Against not really all that sexy, I guess, you know?
You're going to have to come up with some great poll ideas for us.
The politician I trust the most is.
And, Eric, I don't want to bust your balls, Eric.
Beginning of the week, but it's not supposed to say nope.
It's supposed to say none as in none of the above.
And he writes nope.
They're all crooks.
And I didn't have the heart to call them on a Sunday.
They say, hey, you idiot.
You slub.
How can you put no?
And I looked at the facts.
I said them.
It's very clear.
NOINI, Nana, Nunn.
They're all crooks.
296.
Bill Clinton, 185, who had the balls to tell Chris Wallace were to stick it.
Nice going, Bubba.
Algrouw 101.
Russ Finegold 74.
Bob Graham 48.
Barack Obama 27.
You want Osama?
Giddo Bama?
I think Osama's dead.
Or maybe not.
LBS Fischer 19, George W. Bush 19.
2.2% out of the first 847 votes say George W. Bush is the politician they trust the most.
That's pretty sad.
John McCain 17.
Rudy Giuliani 15.
And I hate this poll only 12.
Ted Kennedy 12.
John Kerry 10.
Nancy Pelosi 7.
Swillery only four.
Hillary Clinton.
Wow.
Bill is fist one and our inspector of the magic bullet theory family.
He's got the big O. He's got none.
The biggest name.
So the best challenge to the business.
He will be your partner.
He's more 20560.
He's your A.
Yeah.
Roger.
Now inside the dish in the George the new movie Death of a President.
Have you seen it?
I hadn't seen it.
It's a fictitious movie about, I haven't seen the movie.
About your dad.
Do you know what the word fictitious means?
Not really.
It means not real.
Because you're not dead.
I know that.
Yeah.
Some people say that you're brain dead.
I simply do not agree.
What's your IQ?
300 billion.
Really?
What's your IQ?
13.5.
Whoa.
I don't have intelligence.
That's a problem.
Oh, we don't have a problem.
Let's ignore it.
The investigation will be right back.
I'm sure it's just a coincidence.
It's just like those dropping, rapidly dropping gas prices.
Pretty soon the room I'm hearing is the week before the election
are going to give you a dollar a gallon.
Excellent.
Instead of you, Penn, they're going to pay you a buck.
No, Tommy, there's more numbers coming over there.
I can't imagine what it would be because they got the many team plus
which is very depressing and very bad.
What are you sending me now?
Person 2554.
Oh, just for fun.
I ain't going to be no story either.
I ain't going to be no thing.
Boy, oh, I'm going to be a little bit more than you.
Oh, boy, I'll tell you what.
It's a good thing that they knew management.
We got to wait until the audience was just about gone
and they had destroyed the whole radio station until they finally got off their dead ass.
What they did?
Huh.
Man 18 plus.
Let's see.
We're number 800, man.
And we're pretty proud of it.
And the guys across the street are going to be saying,
see we're making some real inroads.
I don't notice them doing months.
They cracked a two in one day part of 2-2.
Big deal.
No, I think they got a two-two in two parts.
Big deal again.
Let's see.
Man 18 plus the overall week QAIM has got a 2.8.
We're number 16 on QAIM.
That's a 6-am to midnight.
In men, I'm a sports station, number 16.
Is that incredible or what?
And you see, they don't want to get the message.
It's like the Marlins make this big run, you know?
Unprecedented run.
After being 20 games under 500, they've damned their pull-out
a wild car playoff spot.
And they gave it a good shot and they ran out of gas.
But, uh, and is there anybody been going to the games?
There's no interest.
No interest, man.
You could go bowling at those games and have your whole own section.
Just like that dolphin game yesterday, all this whip-up frenzy.
Oh, there's already somebody curious about it.
There's nobody there.
Sell out my ass.
I wonder what kind of a skin they had a pole to say
that that game was sold out.
Maybe Wayne had to, uh, well, of course, I hope he's got some money to bail his kid out.
Yeah, I mean, if they're like the Marlins, they'll just buy the tickets themselves.
Yeah, that's it.
That must be the deal.
They just make the numbers up.
Your eyes were deceiving you.
All that sea of orange you saw, that was just a lot of people dressed up in orange.
Anyway, and Waxies number 23.
Now, what were we?
16 years ago.
16, oh yeah.
They went from a 1-1 to a 1.6.
And that's even before the dolphin stuff.
They're on the move across the street.
Baby, they're moving it.
They're shoving it.
They're pushing it.
God.
Mornings, many team plus.
Hot 105 is number one by a mile.
7.6.
They've been number one for a long, long time.
They're still number one.
Isn't that Tom Joyner?
They hardest work in, uh, whatever he is?
That's him.
Duke Ball.
WSDJ.
Oh, I like that.
Totally.
Holy-o's in the, uh, spos and shows.
6.5.
Number two out of nowhere.
WSDJ is number two.
In the morning.
Man.
Radio Mambe.
Number three.
Radio Mambe.
No speaking English.
A key.
Radio Amor.
Also, no speaking English.
Ayee.
5.6.
They're number three.
Big.
They're still doing it.
They can still do it with Noah Stern on here.
Ron and, uh, well, now that we got our morning show on, man.
Now we got the new sports show.
When you think that these people would get the message, I'm not going to go into it.
I'm not going to get excited about it.
Yeah.
Tied for third with Radio Amor is big.
Ron and Old Paul, man, or whatever their names are.
CMQ FM is number four in the morning.
QBA.
No speaking English.
Radio Swave.
That's the Colombian station.
No speaking English.
So on the first page, you got, you know what you got.
Mid-days, man.
We're dropping like a rock.
Sorry about that.
What?
Hey, listen.
You still got, you still got, I'm sure, more than morning and afternoon drive combined.
Did I even get, I never even got to the QM, and I did I?
I'm not even that many pages into it yet.
In fact, in the morning, I guess the guys across the street, Joe Rowe's little dog had a 2-2.
Up from a 1-5, and we had a 2-2, down from a 2-3.
So it's the damn good thing we made that move when we did, because boy, we were dying there in the morning.
Is if that was a bulletin, just dying.
A terminal death.
We got a sports show on now.
Anyway, mid-day is radio show CMQ FM.
No speaking English.
Number one in man.
Radio Mambe number two.
But again, against MN 18 plus, it puts a lot of old parts.
Hot 105 has got a 4-6.
They're third.
Radio on Lord.
Boy, you talk about heavy duty, ethnic man.
Do they talk to anybody who speaks English with these diaries?
No.
WIOD is fifth, fourth, times for fourth.
QA missed sixth.
We're number six in mid-day, and then four-four.
But that's 10-3.
So if you go 10-2, we probably got a five, right?
Right.
And then that's 18 plus.
Afternoons, many, teen plus, radio on Moors number one.
Did I tell you what they had crossed the street?
They made a big move there.
We got a four-four.
They got a one-seven.
Oh, from a day?
Yeah.
They won from a one-one.
From 25th to 22nd.
You're moving, Joel.
Big time.
That's the kid.
And in the afternoon's radio on Moors one-fuller by Love 94.
That's pretty sad.
Love 94.
Holy cow.
Kind of a man listens to that.
Yeah.
Hot 105.
Big.
Radio Suave.
This is all I've spoken.
Whatever.
I suppose.
In the afternoon's 3-7 pm and this trend is as June July and August two-thirds of the summer
rating book, Kiss That Bonus Money Goodbye, guys.
Yeah, especially Josh's big bonus.
Damn.
Two-seven for INZ for SCAR-America.
Maybe they won't go over the edge with that bankruptcy.
QAM 2.5 down from a two-seven in the previous month, two-five, time for 19th, and Waxia 2.1.
So the man dog still lives in the mountain.
It includes that three to four hours.
It's probably a point-something, zero, whatever.
And of course, Kenny Walker going on about the great radio ad, the great ratings the
Marlins have had.
I'm pretty sure it was him that was saying that.
Maybe I just had a nightmare.
Well, they do well on TV.
And TV ratings were good.
Yeah, but the radio, saying why would anybody listen to an I came on radio when it's on TV
for free, you know?
2.9, time for 12th at night.
I mean, not no great.
So you're certainly better than the Panthers are going to do.
The Panthers will have a point-something, zero.
And what did they have across the street at night?
Can I find out if they on the list here?
They even come make the cut.
Oh, yeah, zero point five.
Wow.
27th.
Save the juice, baby.
Hey, Joel, save the juice.
Turn it off.
Shut that baby down.
Do some transmit or maintenance.
Goose up that nasty old signal there, will you?
God.
We got 900 for votes on the pool today already.
And of course, now that we're not taking calls anymore, I guarantee you, we're going to
be done to a one share pretty soon.
You know what they deserve it?
How low can we go?
That ought to be our goal for the rest of the year.
How low can we go?
In a limbo.
Limbo rock?
Oh, and I got all these pages of print.
And you're running out of a toner or something over on your end.
That's how I got the originals I can't see in my cut.
Oh, very, very nice.
Very nice.
Very nice.
There's a version of 2554 overall.
QAM is type for 20th.
Oh, my God.
Nice going, Joel Bell, baby.
You know what's like?
It would be like, let's go out and find out this spot where the Titanic, you know, finally went down.
And let's start throwing some life rafts.
I know it's a little bit late.
You know what I'm saying?
Uh-huh.
You follow my drift, so to speak?
Are you drifting?
Yeah.
Oh, and thank God they got that game in the whirlens to them.
And they got the superdome fixed to hospitals in the schools and all those neighborhoods.
Now those people are still off-sourced, man.
They got nothing.
But thank God we got the superdome fixed to that ballgame tonight.
There was a ball about that.
So I was going to play football.
I'm going to try to win.
There's a ball, but he's pissed off, man.
Chris Wallace.
Good.
Somebody didn't pull out a gun and shoot him right there on National TV.
That would have run good.
And it would have been great.
That would have been.
I'd have just played that over and over again.
And that would have been, but shoot him again.
Chris Wallace, my ass.
Anybody that's a sellout there on that Fox garbage, man.
I ought to be ashamed.
Now let's see.
Persons 25-50.
I guess I'll do this after the break.
Continue.
We can kill 50 minutes or so with this.
That's what I don't have a very fine pile.
The biggest name.
Oh, the best title of the game is for the way.
You get the real girls team.
They play a little bit blind.
You'll see them next week.
The whole lot of joy in the whole world is for you.

You're holding, Moli.
Huh?
I said, Eesh.
And of course, Clarence has never bothered sending me the monthly because, you know, we have
nothing to do with sports.
He is just, you ought to go, both you ought to go in a hallway right now, grab him and just
tie him up, put him up on a ceiling somewhere and everybody take a baseball bat and just beat
the crap out of him.
Just hang him from the ceiling, like a piñata.
Yeah, that's right.
Everybody comes back.
It's a free shot or two.
Yeah, that kind as well.
Go, go right up 441 or stop at the pawn shop and get a few pieces, five easy pieces.
Just blow his brains out, wouldn't it idiot?
But of course, Joe and the Joyce, they're sold on Clarence, man.
He's the era parent.
He's the, uh, our fearless leader.
Now, he never even bothered sending me the monthly.
So this is basically meaningless anyway.
I think I'm afraid we had a humongous June and when that wraps off on a whole summer book
comes out, we're going to have a minus in front of our number.
Great.
Hot 105 is number one in person's 2554.
WQA, man, and that's our target demo is men's 2554, but in the trends, they don't separate
them.
So we double it.
We don't, we subtract a little tiny, but because we don't have any women tied for 20.
If let's hear it or tied for 20 with a two point, uh, what does that say?
Two point oh, I can't read these numbers because the black stripes are like right down
up the numbers.
Uh, waxy on the other hand has made a big move, man, from number 27 and number 25, a
point seven to a, oh, point nine, man, are they doing it or what?
No.
So in other words, they basically gotten this trend was a bunch of old men.
Nice going, Joe.
Well, old men, Christ, even I don't listen to that crap mornings.
Do we want to take a look at this?
Sure.
Why not?
One of a couple of minutes here.
The audience, all day long.
I think you're pardoned that formula.
What?
That you use it works all day long.
The sports formula, that numbers formula that you do.
The problem formula.
Yeah.
Let's see 1.5, 2554 morning at 1.5.
So that's about a three share in minutes week on a sports station and waxy at 1.3.
So it would be about a two five, two six.
We just edge them out.
Just barely.
Boy, it's a good thing we got to humber back in the safety of the afternoon.
I'll say that.
Man, we're going to be safe.
We have B-O.
They're in the process of reprinting this.
Do you want the legible?
No, don't waste anymore of my, for example, waste anymore.
What?
They can't read it either.
I mean, that's how it goes.
I don't care.
I don't want to read it.
I can make it out.
You know, I mean, I can just barely make it out.
I'm holding it up like, I'm squinting at it.
And believe me, when you've got numbers like these, you'd squint a lot too.
Midday's, prison's 25 to 54, hot 105 is number one Estacion in a market.
Baby, with a 7.1 share, who in their right mind would listen to that crap?
Radio Amor is number two.
Anybody believe it?
No.
Coast number three.
Life.
Life.
The music of your life's slush.
See, everybody who gets in the doctor and dentist office, they get five diaries to fill
out their own.
Listen to life.
We're listening to me.
Michael Bolton records.
CMQFM is number five.
Love.
QAM.
Midday's, number seven.
Prison's 25 to 54 down from a 4.6 in the spring.
But a 3.9 is almost, oh no.
In the spring book, we had a 4.2.
And here's a 3.9.
So I'm not going to have that.
And again, keeping in mind that that 2 to 4, that 2 to 3 hour is an abortion.
And abortion, you know what we had on mostly between 2 and 4?
That's it.
An abortion man.
Whoever did that deserves a spanking.
Let's see, 3.9.
What did they got across the street?
I'm sure they had a gigantic number in this demographic.
Prison's 25 to 54.
I'm looking.
I'm looking.
I'm looking on this page and looking on the next page.
Even wins had a 1.2.
Wins, scare America.
Is there any sales?
There they are.
A 1.0.
A 1.0.
Oh, that's a solid number.
That's up from a 0.6.
So they're going to say, oh, we got a story.
We got a story.
I have a story as you guys still suck.
You got to end the boy.
That team you got, man, I hope you don't lose as many millions as you are in the
offenses you had last year, especially with a little girl Jimmy Ciflis calling the
games.
Had a squeak by.
Had a squeak by a bunch of blind kids.
They played yesterday, man, from Tennessee, the school of the blind.
So we didn't do all that bad, George.
You didn't.
I'll take a little blame for it.
Three of this, of course, asking for a show off the phone and we have that great lead.
And now that new sports show we go where they're talking high school football.
That's going to change everything.
You think?
You're so negative, aren't you?
If they fail, it's going to be your fault.
I don't.
I like Kenny Walker.
I think he's going to be here.
You know, he could be pretty good.
I like Kenny Walker, I wish they would let him do the show.
He wants to.
Yeah, wish they let him do the show that he could do by, you know, a real show instead of
this.
So the dolphins, this and the dolphins, one of your people going to wake up there already,
when you're going to take clearance, you're going to hit man and get him out of there.
Take him out in the field and shoot his ass somewhere and stop with these sports nerds
controlling our destiny, our lives, man, unbelievable.
You are.
Remember that song?
You are my destiny by Paul Anke.
The kid with the canker.
Afternoon, this is, I'm not going to waste my time with it because especially now I can't
read any of this.
EDR, I see his number.
No, are they?
I don't know.
I don't know.
No, I'm on the wrong page.
My bad, I guess.
Here it is.
Three to seven.
When you can't read the number, it kind of like his little bit confusing.
Radio, I'm more as number one in person, 25, 50, 40 afternoon.
The, I'm more, we listen, the, I'm more, we get sick, I want to puke our guts out.
Oh my God, probably playing a lot of, what's your name, Rick?
I see that cruise.
Celia Faint.
That's what Joe Bell and his crowd did to us.
They see a larphate.
And Chris Jones, man, is he doing a heck of a job, heck of a job, Brownie Hound?
They're parling every, every piece of business I ever had on this show into a oblivion.
Let's be getting ready for the new format.
It's called OTA, you know what that stands for?
Out of town, out of town.
Out of the year.
Oh.
QAM, number 27.
Yeah, I can't read it.
Can you?
Number 23 with a 1.2.
What, that's afternoon.
That's up to three to three.
So you double it.
You got a 2.0.
Oh, that's, that's, and Racy is right under us.
They're right behind us with a 1.1, I believe.
Mm-hmm.
So both stations you put them together and you still don't have a number.
Is this a market for sports or what?
Oh.
It's not a sports market.
It can't support one sports station anymore, much less to.
So that's the hell of a job you've done there, Joel.
Basically, what he did is he took a week number divided by two and out everybody's sucking wind, okay?
That is really sad.
Although, wait till you hear the stories that Allison was telling us about.
The biggest names of the best.
That's how hard we're going to do over there.
You're Rogers, sports radio 560, 2AM.
You're Rogers, God.
Sir, do you have any liquids?
I'm not telling.
No, you must be jealous.
Oh, does that make me a fella?
Hey, no need for yelling.
Let me get my supervisor, Ellen.
Sir, are you jealous?
Oh, your question is from Ellen.
Let's see what the Jones has, Ellen.
You are so jealous.
Oh, you taught me your infidelence.
Let's go and get him, oh, you'll be dwelling.
Oh, my God.
That's enough to make me want to listen to Blind Melon.
That's 25 and 560.
I got some Blind Melon in the drawers over there.
Good band?
Yeah.
Whoever said you had bad music tasting.
I'll show you a thing or two.
What is it?
Where's that blind door?
I'll get it done during the next break.
This might be piled over by the water.
Anyways, thinking of that bit I just played,
the government's relaxing his van against carrying liquids and gels
onto the airliners, instituted after a plot to bond just about about a bottle of phony plot.
The Homeland Security Department officials speaking, of course,
on condition of anonymity,
I'll say that most liquids and gels that air travelers,
persons in secure areas of airports will not be allowed on planes.
In other words, you go through your security check point,
then you buy your liquids at the airport,
stores, take them on to your plane, and it's going to be okay.
Okay.
So the goose up business is real good,
and probably there'll be a whole bunch of little shops,
convenience store type places opening, you know.
You know what I'm saying?
I have to go to the security.
Uh-huh.
Because then you'll be safe.
Wow.
A document drawn up by the French DGSE Intelligence Service
and made public on Saturday alleges that terrorist massed your mind.
Osama Yamama died in August of Typhoid.
French President Jacques
Sherrock confirmed the existence of the document which was published by the French regional daily East Republican.
When he told journalists in the city of Kompien,
I'm surprised that a confidential document by the D.S.G.E. was published, he said.
He surprised.
And a guy, did you see the interview this guy who was behind the story?
No.
And he stands by it.
They say, but a beep, but a beep, but a beep, but a beep, and the Saudi say,
you're fuller, you're mama, and all of a sudden,
it says, according to a usually reliable source,
the Saudi intelligence services are said to require the information
that Osama bin Laden is dead.
The information gleaned by the Saudi's indicates that the head of Al-Qaeda was victim of a very strong attack
of Typhoid in Pakistan, August 23rd of this year.
The document goes out and said it had been lodged as geographic isolation
rated all medical assistance impossible, and that the illness had caused a partial paralysis of his legs.
It also says the Saudis are waiting for more information notably about where bin Laden was buried
to make an official announcement about his death, and also they want to notify the family,
because they're all really tight, you know, and the Bush family can be over there and pay their last respects.
All of these things.
Does it really make any difference whether he's dead or alive?
Of course not.
It's all symbolic, and I don't think he was engineering too many attacks from the cave, you know, from the back cave.
All of them maybe here, you know, in the back cave and Batman they had all that fancy, shmancy stuff, you know,
all tight-tech crap.
Uh-huh.
So maybe in the bin Laden cave there in Tura-Bora-Bora, they had a bunch of crap, and of course you know what Bubba said.
He said, don't feed me no more bubble mice.
He's no way tol Chris Wallace.
He said, what do you think I was going to do just to see him make a monkey out of me?
When you were president.
So you did Fox's video on the show.
You did your life's little conservative hit job on me.
I think it is so he took enough crap already from them, okay?
He isn't taking any more crap, is basically what he's saying.
He ain't running for nothing anyway.
Plus he'll probably do whatever you can to send back his aspirations all over.
He probably wouldn't be, what might be the first guy.
What would you call him?
What would you call him?
Uh-huh.
Besides Bubba, the first gentleman?
No, I've heard no better.
They call him a gentleman.
The first man.
I thought the first man was Adam, and then there was Steve and God created Adam and Steve.
971 hosts on the pool.
I read the number one we get to a thousand, but it's pretty impressive already, isn't it?
Especially when he said, yes, Dave was all that NFL stuff.
I thought there was supposed to be a game last night, but one of the teams missed the bus to the stadium.
Yeah, it's one thing to get beat bad like that.
If they could beat it at home like that, real bad.
Oh, God, that's Denver, man.
They got your number.
They do.
Tom Brady is one in five lifetime against the Broncos.
If Denver tried to lose the game, if they tried to fix it, they could take it, still couldn't beat him.
If they gave us a handicraft, you're like about a ten-point lead at the start, still find a way to lose.
Leaked, oh, there's a Hugo Chavez, you're new hero.
It's disgusting to see a head of state come to our country on the...
Oh, cut that crap.
Come to our country and call it, yeah, and tell the truth.
So nauseated with these people.
And that's a guy from Sikko.
What do you expect him to say?
Or is Brian Murray?
You know, he would call it, he wouldn't call it Sikko.
Don't say it.
Leaked intelligence report rocks Bush election stance.
US fire agencies have dropped a political bomb show six weeks before the National elections.
Oh, my God.
Would the leak of a classified report, including that the war in Iraq has spawned a new wave of Islamic radicalism
and increased the global threat of terrorism?
The intelligence document yesterday rocked the central pillar of the Republican Party's campaign platform
ahead of the November elections, that the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the after asylum
who stayed made America safer, not weaker.
Guess what?
Wrong.
As if this is some surprise, as if it takes some kind of a study to figure this out.
With opinion pool showing President Bush's party possibly losing control of both houses of Congress and the midterm polls.
All right.
In large part due to one happiness over the war in Iraq, the report states categorically the opposite
will make for painful reading at the White House.
Bush is argued repeatedly in pre-election speeches that Iraq is the central front of the war in terrorism
and that demands for US troops withdraw from the country by officers and Democrats underscores
while the center left party should not be trusted with the nation's security, center left party.
The security of the civilized world depends on victory in the war on terror and that depends on victory in Iraq.
Bush said in one speech, August 31, such assertions were looking decidedly shaky yesterday.
After the New York Times and Washington Post released details of the classified national intelligence estimate,
the most comprehensive assessment yet of the war based on analyses of all 16 of America's intelligence agencies.
The report, called Trans-Englobal Terrorism Implications for the US, says the Iraq Wars made the overall
terrorism problem worse and official with the document told the Times.
The Washington Post said the report described the Iraq conflict as the primary recruiting vehicle for a violent Islamic extremist again as if we didn't know that.
As if a blind deaf and dumb dog couldn't already tell you that.
While the US has seriously damaged the occurred and disrupted its ability to carry out major operations since 9-11 attacks on the American Washington,
it noted radical Islamic networks have spread and decentralized.
And wasn't that the ICE shot-moo share of federalized?
I was talking about how the Taliban are much worse than ever before and how they've reformed and reshaped and are like worse than I'll try to do.
And he said that last night, right? Dream that.
No, he said that.
After Katie Currick did her licky-licky, licky-licky, kissy-kissy with Tadaliza, that was the worst suck piece I've ever seen in my life.
It was portographing, it was disgusting.
Katie Currick, my ass, and this is a journalist.
She's got credibility, not...
Oh, forget about journalists on TV.
You can count them on one hand.
Chris Wallace.
Sean Hannity.
Bill O'Reilly.
Democratic leaders were quick to jump onto reports conclusions as clear evidence of the failure of Bush's policies.
The intelligence documents had put the final nail in the coffin for Bush's phony argument about the Iraq War.
Senator Ted Kennedy sent a statement some day.
Then he said,
The fact that we need a new direction in Iraq to really win the war on terror in the American safer could not be clearer or more erred urgent.
Yet the administration stubbornly clings to a failed state-of-course strategy.
He said,
Kind of reminds me of Joe Bell in this station, man.
Month after month after month as the audience was vanishing, jumping, running away from this radio station like we had radio leprosy, like we had berry berry.
Like if you test that knob on five-sixth, you'd get like a sense of tumor.
The White House, while reiterating its traditional stance of not committing on classified reports of the New York Times story,
is the representative of the complete document.
We've always said that the terrorist are determined keeping the pressure on and staying on the offensive is the best way to win the war on terror a White House spokesman had arrived.
But the leak intelligence report is hardly good news for Bush and Republicans coming on top of a messy revolt by top Republican senators against the Bush plan for legitimizing how the US interrogates and prosecutes and tortures terrorist suspects.
The Senate rebels,
rebels who include possible candidates to succeed Bush in 2008 reached the compromise agreement with the White House late last week.
But the unseemly Rao already deverted attention away from Republican efforts to present a unified front on the issue of national security during the final stretch of the election campaign.
Their stretch in it, baby.
The Republican leaders tried to brush aside the intelligence document which they said hadn't been seen yet.
And Senate Majority Leader Bill Spist expressed confidence US voters would not be swayed by the intelligence report.
Right, she lives so long.
Next thing, you know, they're going to be talking illegal aliens on Lou Dodd show on CNN.
They're going to be killing, they're going to be shooting aliens right there and Lou's going to be doing the shooting too.
Can you just see them there with a sick shooter just like just like a white burp, man. Can you see it? I'll just like Gabby Hayes and Roy Rogers.
Shoot him up, Lou.
993. Wouldn't be great to see Lou do a little kung fu.
Like who made you and sticky old screw it all in illegal aliens back across the border.
Shoot, shoot, shoot.
No, shoot. Yeah, shoot him away like a fly swatter.
See now you're going to get into now. You're going to start picking out of Mexicans again. I know you've got that predilegeuse.
Oh, yeah.
Now, I know how radio swabby is getting a little bit of a number there with that. Well, when's the Mexican station going to start doing a number?
We are going to have some Mexican stations to where we might as well. We got all these other stations those beginning ways.
And they're doing your sternarily well. Hello, Bob. I don't know where to.
Thank you very much, Joe Bell, for bringing us down for allowing clearance to drag us down into the depths of the spear.
And once we have that June drop off, I'm telling you, man, if parents had the falls to bring you the monthly you would puke.
Because knowing that July, August and September is the summer waiting book, and we're going to drop off that big June, we haven't got a Chinaman's chance in purgatory, man.
And speaking of Chinaman's chance, I got a big article here. You want to hear the headline is from the BBC.
All right. Beijing's penis in Poryom is the headline. Really now. And now we do the subheading. It says there are many thousands of Chinese restaurants around in the UK, and everyone has their favorite dish that's favorite with the you.
But only in China itself, and the chef's specialized in a range of slightly more unusual delicacies.
And of course, in Spain, where they like those bull fights, you know what one of the LBCs is there besides fried pig ears. I'm not going to say it.
It's called fried bull. Absolutely.
F***ing sh**.
Man, thousands of two votes. Let's hear it. Now we can go home. I'm going home.
Well, it's only a trend. You know, it's just two-thirds of the summer book. I bet he doesn't have to also bring it to the monthly list.
I'll put it in a request.
Put in a request for the monthly list. I just can't wait. I want to see men 25, 54, and many, 18 plus. I want to see those monthly list for the last three months.
And when you see him, what a big month we had in June, man. We had such a bonus. I mean, such a great month in June.
And when that thing drops off to a lot of August and September, man, you are going to be able to find an audience with a search party and Charlotte home.
I thought I'd find Charlotte who's 14-year-old Roger. He's selling work when he'll be able to sell you AM.
This is the Neil Roger show.
This is the funny one.
Any questions?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
So deceptive.
They had to use a photo shop to take off the way that I got to put CVS on top.
I need to look young and hot. Whoa. When they use the photo shop on my publicity shot.
Jimmy Kerbsett, I don't got. Hey, guys. Thanks a lot. Whoa. Go on a diet. Don't be a joke.
I won't say no my stomach like Al Roper. Airbrush my waist so I don't look fatter. Make me sexier than Dan Rather.
Here's a new slash. This just in. They also erased my extra chin. I love 20 pounds over night.
I just got hit on by Walter Cronkite. So bust out the photo shop. And don't you ever stop. Now that I got the anchor slot.
I need to say young and hot. Whoa. Katie Kerg in his house. And we see they're not those.

Only common people come here and get drunk in the lab.
But she does offer me a deer blood and vodka cocktail which I decide to skip.
The restaurant's grizzly menu was dreamt up by a man called Mr. Ghol, he's now 81 and retired.
After fleeing China's civil war back in 49 he moved to Taiwan then to Atlanta, Georgia,
where he began to look deeper into traditional Chinese medicine and experiment on the appendages
of man's best friend.
Apparently they are low in cholesterol and good men in their pictures.
Great.
Good nights is for boosting the male sex drive but for treating all sorts of ailments.
Lack of trickles through the walls of our dining room.
Government officials said Nancy, two of them upstairs they're having the penis hot pot.
I'll bet.
Most of the restaurants guests are either wealthy businessmen or government bureaucrats who
as Nancy puts it have been brought here by people who want their help.
One better way to secure a contract than over a steaming penis fondue.
Discretion is assured as all the tables are in private rooms the good-seated one has gold dishes.
Some of them like their food served raw sushi like sushi but we can cook it anywhere you like.
Not long ago a particularly rich real estate mogul came in with four friends, all men,
women come here often so they shouldn't eat testicles as Nancy solemnly.
The men spent $5,700 on a and especially rare dish something that needed to be ordered
months in advance tiger penis as Nancy.
The illegal trade in tiger parts is a big problem in China.
Campaigners say they species is being driven toward extinction because of its popularity
as a source of traditional medicine.
I mentioned this doubly the Nancy but she insisted all her tiger supplies come from animals
that have died of old age.
Anyway we only have one or two orders a year she says.
So what does it taste like I ask?
Oh the same as all the others she says blightly.
And does it have any particular potency?
No people just like to order a tiger to show off how much money they have.
Welcome to the People's Republic of China.
Tigers beware.
Oh yes she has the same group also ate an aborted reindeer fetus.
Very good for your skin and here it is.
Oh boy.
Another nutritionist walks in bearing something small and red wrapped in cling film.
My appetite is heading for the airport.
Still I think it would be rude not to try something.
I'm normally okay about this sort of thing.
I have had fried cockroaches and sheep's eyes so there's a small bowl of sliced
and pickled ox penis on the table.
I pick up a piece with my chopsticks and start to chew.
It's cold and bland and rubbery.
Nancy gives me a meat and meat and meat and smile.
You could have this one.
This one you say should be in every day.
Oh my god.
You know what they say a day keeps the doctor away.
Who says that?
I don't know some people I know.
That's what what's his name told me.
James Franco.
By the way I apologize to myself again for that freezing geeks thing.
I'm sending back.
Anybody want it you can have it.
I watch five minutes of one episode.
That's for like little kids.
It's pathetic.
It's like a whole bunch of little Robert grippers on there.
You know it's just tragic speaking of Robert.
Nice going.
I know so like Waxley had a big month there in August.
Can you imagine a big party there having over there.
Look at that.
Overall and men they had a two five.
Of course old though.
Many team plus 2.8 in August.
Two oh and June one eight in July and a 2.8 in August.
You know it's bogus.
A mid days they had a one four one three and then a two four in August.
Oh boy they got some wire diaries in August no doubt.
Three to seven one nine in June one eight in July.
Two six in August.
They're on the move baby and at night.
Oh my god.
At night in July they had a one point.
Oh and then August what a turnaround at 0.1.
Oh.
That's a real turnaround.
You know how there we say that oh we did a real turnaround.
Yeah from a 1.0 to an 0.1 you can't turn around much more than that.
And how did we do with the marlins from a three nine to a two eight in August.
It's in August when they were making their big run Josh when all those exciting games
run and they were like right there within a couple of games at a wild card or close to
it that is correct sir.
Two eight.
They stunk squat.
And what did we have in August three oh but that's 10 to three keep in mind okay 10
to three includes that two to four those two hours of dead air transfer to maintenance
that we still have no idea why the hell they insisted on putting him on in your old time
that was clearances call I guess.
So when he the one that made that decision to put that on the air is good little funny.
What in other words if clear if you're tight with clearance man you get a lot of air time
even if you have like a minus in front of your number like minus six here six below zero
that's the way it works here at QM because he's got the keys to the kingdom and the
naked pictures make no mistake about that he must have he must have they're enchanted
with him he would know a radio if you stuck if he took my old RCA my old Emerson radio
and stuck that in there and shove that in there with a with a crowbar.
Well it's all the small amounts of liquids and gels to be allowed now.
Travel size three ounce containers of eyedrops lip gloss makeup shaving cream whatever you
need that fit and seal comfortably into a one quart or less zip top baggie.
The second change concerns drinks you buy before you board your flight because we are
confident in our increased security measures throughout the airport passengers will now
be allowed to purchase drinks and other items in the secure boarding area to the checkpoint
and bring them aboard their flights.
For instance you may buy bottles of water, cups of coffee, shop of duty free as long as
it's bought in the secure boarding area past the checkpoint those are okay to bring
on board your aircraft.
So two changes that recognize some common sense security point.
Oh yeah.
Small container.
Everything stays in the size and in limited amounts don't pose a real threat.
There you go.
We got to relax the thing because it's even close to that election we want people like
they're like oh look at the great job they're doing baby they're doing a hell of it.
They saved our lives and now the inconvenience is going to be a lot less than the gas prices
they're giving us a dollar to take each gallon and everything is just great.
All right.
Wait till like November 10th when it's like five bucks a gallon and when they say they're
going to like strip you naked before they let your ass under plane.

Oh, I.M.
Oh, right.
I support watcher.
I.M.
I support watcher.
Looking at having their butts now.
Welcome.
And I was a boy.
I threw away by dollhouse toys.
When I saw my first game.
I got a swell.
Most then, most insects.
They tried the wear a dress.
Watchin' the S.P.A.D.
In fish and sond.
Oh.
I.M.

Oh, there's the indignant old cave man on the back of his spot.
I.M.
I support watcher.
You know the indignant cave man?
That's right.
Watchin' the over.
It's the over and underweigher.
Right.
You know what.
Give me a classic example.
I guess today it's the off-and-tenancy game.
We're still lucky we're in hell to win.
And if we weren't for the penalty, they would be on three.
What is there to say about that?
Is there any more that needs to be said about that?
I've been there wasn't what it was. It was a piece of crap and they're lucky you're in hell
I have a win and it means nothing and they suck what else is there to say Josh?
Well, you could go the route of and this is just going out of limb
This is not what they were talking about on the morning show or anything
But you know Dante, you know his confidence is gonna be up now
He sucks because he ran that ball in for the team
He's his mobile is the statue of liberty and he went head first. So, you know, he's got confidence now for the next week
Okay, that was on a morning show. I thought it was supposed to be an entertainment show
Are you telling me it's a sports show?
I just paid that up. Oh, what that was our trouble now
You don't take a pay down to Georgia's book and be a schmitters. It feels it'll be Josh's fault. That's correct
Just write that down folks. If the morning show our new morning show fails
It's gonna be Josh Curtis's fault because he would use the rule on with a corporate boy. Look at that obvious man
Oh man our wow
If you believe this then I must have got a lot of wire diaries across the street
A one for in the morning in men a one point four reaching a new low
I guess that's because they knew that you know was the the hopper was a lame duck in the morning or dead duck
And anyway move it along. Can we move along get off that stuff?
I mean what's the point of just you you're never gonna talk these people into what out of it anything
We just there are as stubborn as a muzzle stubborn as as your mother and my mother as stubborn as the mother in that movie trans
American that is good movie. I don't think Josh is ready for it
Did you say you you keep telling me different mixed signals either you saw you think you said pretty sure I saw some of it
It's it's really actually pretty good and what I saw it. Yeah, it was very interesting
And though I was not put on or anything. Oh, no, it's I mean it's not like that only a short moments
Blair turned blind eye to a wreck intelligence and bush meeting says the London dependent Tony Blair turned a blind eye to win
Intelligence and failed the challenge George Bush over claims that
Sodom was saying was developing nuclear weapons according to news claims published last week
I know of a private meeting between mr. Blair and president Bush in January of 2003 shows that Blair failed a confront Mr. Bush when he claims
Sodom and tried to buy aluminum
For nuclear weapons productions
Mr. Blair did not contradict the president despite having received private briefings
Which indicated that the aluminum
Chewbets were more likely to be for conventional weapons according to the new edition of a book by the international lawyer Philip Sands
Published today the claims in a new US edition of the book lawless world will raise fresh questions about whether Mr.
Blair played a secondary role to president Bush when Bush and Blair discussed the aluminum cubes after White House meeting on January
31 2003 they appeared to have done so by turning a blind eye on a never
Forget to get my blind melon
David to intelligence that have been made available to them but was on help from their chosen course of action to both says
Assuming this to be the case I can only reinforce the suspicion that mutual convenience
Puzzle to leaders to misrepresent the intelligence to show up their claim or well you can play it there
I don't want you to find my
Discs
White you better look for it
Alright
Brother with it
Brother with it
What does it get chunky?
Who writes the words of you?
Not this game
All the girl we chose
All one cares and no one knows
Who is?
I'm not sure how you're going to find it
Something always strange
My food cares and there's a plot
I'll not find the plot
I'll not update
What do you go for?
Don't see your show for
Tell it to you
Go to see those beautiful days
Are you letting the cow to the bed again?
You're telling the new format?
That's not the our new morning show starting next week
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Are we yelling with black melon?
What are you selling?
I bet you're smelling
Oh you're right
All I can say is that my life is pretty fine
Okay, that takes care of that
At least I found it
That's good because it wasn't in a place where I was supposed to
But I still can't find my standing in the shadows of Motown CD
And I'm pretty peered about that
Pretty porky about that
Okay, so there's the monthly is which means I don't know
What does it actually say?
Huh?
But it beat but it booted about?
Right
In other words, July we done fine
Let's see how you done
This is mostly you and this summer bookie that mine was only on two days a week
July we were spectacular
Five points for man
What were you doing in July?
I was like, oh my god
It's been a big cause you were taking
Oh yeah
But then in August down to a three point
Oh and it's not so exciting
Oh no, I guess it got old
So we got July August and so it's all September's worth hanging
Okay, then keep in mind that's 10 to 3
I'm going to tell you what they did to us with that 2 to 4
And then having poor mad dog following two arms of dead air
Remember I kept saying you off the air
When are they going to move him up already?
I mean they could have put him on 2 to 5 anytime they wanted
They could have put courtesy in between 5 and 7
Did they do it?
Did they make a move?
They acted like they were like paralyzed
Paralized
Terrified to make a movement maybe
He who hesitates is lost
So we'll find out September whether you guys across the street continued their gigantic move
They made in August which I'm sure that they're all jumping up and down doing a kazansky over there
Hey more power to you guys whatever you know
Try to talk yourselves into it
Convince yourselves you're like broadcasters
This story here
It makes you want to just throw your arms up in the air
And say what's the use?
Okay when I saw this and I put it on our website although I don't think anybody's reading it
Why do we you know something Josh maybe we ought to just take the weekends off
I agree
You know what's how there's some websites like on a weekend they don't really change much of anything like Capitol Hill Blue
Pretty much leave stuff on a weekend
Because nobody reads them
Let me let me take a look here on our stats page and see how many people read the stories that you and I worked our brains up
There goes blind melon on the floor sir
Oh no
There we go again
Wow that's enough
Let's see posted on yesterday how many people read that 162 the most reads 135
There's four and I didn't say that many this weekend to try to like make up for that bad day
When I sent to 800 stories
And Saturday there was one story bush rage is I'm not feels above Lord of sulfur
203 people read that one and I guess it's okay son of dolphins only gets jail time 183
That's because you know we got a mean-scored at bunch out there
The wish Wayne would pro anything that bad happens to Wayne. They like it. I go along with that
So I guess we'll continue but just not so many I guess you know just a couple here a couple of you

After they get them pounding up on Houston little girls team. I think the game after that is the one in the England

Really?
Yeah, I want to alter my early season my my preseason prediction

Was I discovered jazz diet Pepsi
You haven't seen this?
No
Well, this goes in, I've been telling you for many years now
It's the Chef Royard de Mantell
Do you take basically the same product

Jazz diet Pepsi, strawberries and cream
Fraze a quim
Weathe
Yeah, see everything here

And now we got some jazz
And they got the sugar free I like that
Keep that back, keep that back
Mmm
Oh man
It gives you like a real good clean griff
I like that
And I'll get to the bad news now, sorry
Couldn't put it off forever
A recent New York Times CBS poll reveals among other things
That nearly a third of Americans
Still believe that a Iraqi former
Recki dictator, Saddam Hussein, was personally involved in the 9 Love and Terror attack
Oh my God
I heard he was quarterbacking the Juts yesterday
You realize how many close games there were yesterday
And not because it was good, because teams are so bad
Just like your game
I mean, I disagree with you on that
But a lot of bad games and a lot of bad quarterbacks
Oh my God, so many bad quarterbacks and so little time
You don't agree with that?
No, I don't think that there's a lot of bad teams
But oh there are
And yours is one of them
I can't argue with you there
Last month President Bush stated in the press conference that the former Iraqi dictator had nothing to...
In fact, we got it
We got him a sanded
And then making a difference
What he says, what anybody tells them
We can stick it right under annual
What in the racket do you have what?
Nothing
Nothing
Nobody's ever suggested that the attacks of September the 11th were ordered by Iraq
Last month, he stated in the press conference that the former Iraqi dictator had nothing to do with the attacks
Despite previous statements by Vice President Dick Cheney
The Boston Globe in 2003 said Cheney asserted the administration is learning more and more about connections between Al-Qaeda and Iraq
Before 9-11 attacks, surprising analysts and officials at the time who reviewed the real intelligence reports
The White House also has a web page which credits some of the confusion
The former CIA director George Tenant
The lengthy Times CBS survey was just over a thousand Americans found
But what was their average IQ?
Over 80 questions covering a wide variety of political topics, highlights
When asked if they approve or disapprove of the way President is doing his job, 56% disapproved, 37% approved
When asked the same about Congress, 61% disapproved, 25% approved
60% of things are going worse today than there were five years ago, only 18% of things were going better
19% of the men's amends about the same
One question asked the respondents was what they thought was the most important problem facing the country today
He over numerous choices, 14% chose the war in Iraq and 14% terrorism in general
7% of the economy, 4% including Ludov said immigration, 2% health care, 2% of the environment, education religious values rated only 1% of respondents
The highest percentage, 20% was for other, you know like other crap, like not getting laid enough stuff like that
As for the November elections, 96% said they would definitely vote only 3%
96% are going to vote
Now what are they going to say after we have like a 40% turn out, what are the other 56% say, oh I lied, I lied
Talk about giving a PC answer to polls, that goes to show a polls are full of crap, including ours, they're full of crap
Polls are for Poland
The expectation for November among the respondents was that 54% believe Democrats would win more seats
32% felt the Republicans would have the upper hand
Probably a hand from a king there and at movie Tristan is old, they haven't seen that yet
What is it that you saw that was so bad, oh you said you saw a fly
I always did, everything you said
And Josh had you citizen Jackass instead
He called you a Jackass for watching that
Both
Well James, what's his name, Franco was in it anyway
He was alright, I mean he did everything
He never stole a freight train, he was pretty good
In Thomas however did not fare well, 77% of the respondents felt it's time to give new people's a chance
Only 12% supported Congress for election
42% felt Democrats were more likely to make the right decision about the winner, rack 37% Republicans
Respondents to better decision making regarding terrorism of the GOP, 42% versus 37%
Torture, which has been proudly featured in recent news, is never justified in the opinion of 56% of those polls
While 35% said it was sometimes justified and 5% said it all depends
Abu Gharrah or the Jun Allison standard by with the fresh box of the pens
59% felt the president is mostly telling the truth but hiding something about how things are going for the US and Iraq
While 12% feel he's telling the entire truth, 25% felt he's mostly lying
Although when asked if they thought of themselves as evangelical or born again Christians, nearly a third said yes, 68% said no way Jose
No way, you crazy best dog to grow you, by the way happy, he was new year and happy Ramadan
And the Pope says he takes it all back, oh they sure got to him fast didn't they?
He is stuck in a heavy duty now man, to mend those fences just like Kenny Kirk was stuck it up to kind of lesalize that
That was one of the most disgusting pieces and if you don't believe the way they manipulate the medium take them over or you don't believe nothing
Just pathetic
Wasn't bad enough they got Danny rather not only off the news but also off the 60 minutes
But now we got this tough piece bitch on there with her black eye who's not only doing the CBS even he knows
But now she's doing suck up puff pieces on 60 minutes. Oh my god. I wish you would have seen that. You would be used to be
I'm still be vomiting glad I did you weigh about four pounds now from just you can your guts out overnight
Man, what what a puff piece Christ why not just come right on say the president's bull like secretary of state
You know why not say it huh? Oh, yeah right out there Katie for America in the whole world
No good God even Mikey knows she's dyke and he likes any that's cute brother of course
You know now that we're gonna have a gay governor in the state of Florida Charlie Christ. What's wrong with that?
It's good around we're taking over and we're the Jews and the gays
It's pretty good. He's taking over next one. I'm gonna tell you right now if you want Osama if he is still alive and does making a difference
You want Osama you better like Obama
He's done a couple of things that I thought were like you know, I haven't agreed with last few months but nevertheless
He's the man you mark my words. He's gonna be big. He's gonna be huge. Huh? I'm all for it. Yeah me too. He's got my vote
Certainly better than that swirly. He could win a fake. She couldn't win a fixed alike. There's too many people
She you know what she is she's like they a female Michael DuCoccus guaranteed loser
Yeah, you can just see the Republicans rubbing their hide legs together like a big grasshopper
Just hoping that she gets the nomination. They're praying for it because that what they were rubbing their rubbinum just like Katie Kirk was sitting there with kind of Lisa
That only knows what the hell they were scrubbin and rubbing. God. How this stuff gets on the year
And I mean this is these are all over the world people are watching this like this is a representation of something for real like this is for real
Is real and of course that never got mentioned there either about the slaughter of all these people
Which he's got plenty of blood on her damn hands too
In fact would have been appropriate if Katie would have said well see how come the face in the rest of you seem to be a little black but your hands are all blood red
That would have been a good question yeah, but you see there's very people got the big few bigger homes to go off and like I want to know
I want to know it was a perfectly legitimate question but I want to know how many people in the bush in the administration
Do you ever watch rock and his son they say believe you asked him and we ask plenty of questions
You didn't ask that did let him have it published stick it to him pull out our ship and just stab him right to the heart of my gun
Which I doubt because you're not allowed to have a heart if you work on Fox News 18 to noon a few and we got the mad dog at 2

They say they're not really mean
All those weapons are mad at them
Then it's six feet
Then it did six feet
What did he say
The make those weapons are way
And act that way
Maybe it's because
He's from Germany
It dies to choose a little Nazis
Then it it's six feet
Not ever tested in cash
They're all going insane
It's the problem's no harm
They say the folks be vain
All over the Middle East
They're burning every cheese
All those weapons are mad at them
Then it did six feet
All those weapons are mad at them
They're burning it six feet
But he's sucking up heavy duty now baby
They want to get along
They want to get along
He wants to stay alive
He don't want no more dead Christians
At least Catholics anyway
Born again Christians
You can kill them
If not the Catholics please
That's what he said
I'm going to tell you something
Did you send me this?
What?
This piece of copy
I did
It was in the box and I sent it along
I already got it
This particular piece
Even though you're blaming on somebody
Didn't have the big black stripe on the middle of it
When you got the original copy of it?
No
Well it does now
It's got to try to tell you that before
But being the hard-est that you are
You won't listen to whatever I say
You like my mother
No matter what I say to you
You only go in one of your now in your career
There's a big black stripe
Right down the middle of it
Time to change cartridges
There you go
Time to go
Good thinking
I can't tell you that
I mean you
I already got it anyway
Thank goodness
And it's a horrible piece of copy
By the way the new Hank
Not Hank Goldbear
But our new Hank was named Guerrero
What if he's going to Peter?
I don't know
I think he's going to Peter O'Guerrero
But anyway he's a coolist
Shulis and Kulis
And I'm probably this Chris Yozman
We got him sales
Remember the last sales manager?
The lumped whatever we call him
Stiffy
Stiffy, that was Hank's name for him
The little Stiffy
Stiffy is a genius compared to this guy
And didn't speak with a sudden draw
Y'all
I just call me a bigot
And I am
But that thing with a sudden draw
I'm always kind of getting some hackles
They hear on my back of my neck up in a
Hand
Wow
We got over 1100 votes on the pool
Politicians you trust them
148 most people say they're all crooks
Or at least 34% said that
And that's the right answer
Anybody who thinks that there's some altruistic
Wonderful person out there
Just waiting to save us
You're full of crap man
Because they can't get anywhere
Being honest in politics
And going to get anybody in place
That may be a very very you know
A cynical view but it's also the correct one
Jeff Cohen, no not the pizza guy
The founder of the Media Watch Group Fair
And author of cable news
Not confidential my misadventures in corporate media
And you know why I love this article?
Remember how I used to talk about
Crossfire, remember Crossfire
Yes
And how they always put a real weak liberal on there
Starting with that old toad Tom Braden
This is great
Jeff Cohen writes for Anna Smirking-Chimp
For two decades I've been preoccupied
With one issue above all others
That both ends of the political spectrum
Got there say in the media
One reason among many that I worked so hard
To retire George W. Bush in 2004
Was my nightmare that a defeated John Kerry
Would be hired by cable news
To represent the left day after day on a TV debate show
Fox News Channel often gets blamed for the standard format
That pits forceful, articulate, right wingers
Against wimpy, halting liberals
Fox's pairing of righty hard-throwed Sean Hannity
With backpedaling barely left the center Alan Combs
Is a prime example of this lopsided format
A mismatch depicted in Al Franken's book, Henry and Combs
But it's wrong to blame Fox for television centered right
GE to GM spectrum
That format was firmly in place years before there was a Fox News
The real culprits have been CNN and PBS
Take Crossfire, started by CNN in the 82
Is the only nightly form on national TV
Reporting to offer an ideological battle
Between co-hosts on the left and right
Crossfire's co-host on the left for the first seven years
Was a haplessly in the factual center's Tom Braden
A guy who makes Alan Combs look like an ultra-left fire brand
In CNN's eyes, Braden apparently earned his left discredentials
By having been a high-level CIA official
Ironically enough, in charge of covert operations against the political left of Western Europe
Braden was paired on Crossfire with the ultra-rightist Pat Buchanan
During the Braden Buchanan years, LSD guru Timothy Leary told the reporter
That watching Crossfire was like watching the left wing of the CIA
Debating the right wing of the CIA
It may have been Leary's most sober observation ever
I guess it's several times on Crossfire with the tired 70-something is my alleged ally
Once as I took my seat on the set, seeing Braden totally caked up with makeup
My first impulse was to reach over to take a pulse
My second impulse was to flee the studio
In an 1988 Crossfire appearance when I criticized the conservative tilt of TV
Punditry and debates restricted to right versus center
Buchanan could not only affable the fence of Braden
What do you think is sitting next to me? What do you think this is a pot of plant?
A healthy fight gets observed and Mother Jones writer would add more balance
The taboo against genuine progressives as host was even clearer when Crossfire needed substitutes on the left
And shows CNN shows beltway centrist like Jodie Powell, President Curtis Press Secretary
And Martin Kondraki, yes the guy who is now on Fox, and no he was no more progressive then
These were men who would never declare themselves to be on the left in real life
They seemed to wince when CNN made them say it on television
On both CNN and PBS, one of TV's longest running standings for left has been Mark Shields
Even while his promo material denied any ideological leanings
Mark Shields is free of any political tilt they would say
When John Roberts became our country's chief justice, Shields wrote a scolting attack
Not on the right wing judge who we actually praised, but on a feminist leader who opposed Roberts
Shields is a smart, articulate guy, but he's no more an advocate for the American left and Mel Gibson is an advocate for reformed Judaism
Seeing liberals on TV backpedal night after night in the face of the Buchanan's in hand
And these helped create a public image of the American left as weak, evasive, lacking in values
And the American right as clear, form and moral
Punted TV is to find not only a skewed spectrum of debate, but a roadmap for the feat of liberal politicians just as go and carry
Imagine if the American right have been represented the year after year on TV, not by the Buchanan's in hand at these
But by Republican pundits allied with Christine Todd Whitman and Arlen Specter, moderates dismissive of their party's activists
Now imagine that the American left had been represented on TV, not by the braiden's kinsley's and combs's
But by progressive pundits like Barbara Ironreich and Jim Hightower
New version area is easy to imagine, which has a lot about the real bias of TV news
Oh, there's no bias in TV news, that's why Katie Kirk was on their suck-up to kind of lease on 60 minutes last night
Kissy, kissy, kissy, kissy, wow
I got that story about Katie, I think it's time to let the break even the inquirer stuff
Okay, well they like that
Yeah, I want to, they want to stink their teeth into a baby just like I thought Katie was going to stink her teeth into a condolisi
I'm sure that something was going to happen something sexual was going to happen right there on the spot on the set
Maybe on the piano, maybe they're going to do it on the piano
I think it's possible because condolisi was sitting there tinkling away
I'm a fan of it, tickling the key and Katie was tinkling all over
Four minutes to limit QM, we got the mad dog at two
Oh, right, thank God, it looks after that August month, man like we made our move just in time or maybe like I said a little bit too late
Like I've told you, I've been using dry concepts in my home for 21 years and you wouldn't dream and either what I've been using anybody else if you've got a brain
Don't trust your carpuses as I'm a slack-meister that you find in the yellow pages
And don't forget, just because you can't see the dirt and mold in your car but it does mean it's in there
It's in there, I'll write deep, it's in there deep
In South Florida, we tend to go along periods of time without opening windows which can breed unhealthy conditions
More reasons to dry clean your carpuses on a regular basis
Your carpuses last longer because it takes the crap out of the fibers deep in your carpuses
This copy, I so helped me, God, I'm going to kill somebody who ever wrote this
It is so bad, remember what I had to go through to get this copy?
Yeah, I just want to sit here and put my head on the table and cry
Don't cry, anyway, your carpuses stay clean or longer because they get even the deep down dirt and the fibers you're carpeted up
And they will last longer too, comes out softer, the colors come out looking brighter in your house smells like many fresh afterward
And dry concepts has got a plan to make frequent cleaning easier to freshen up the cost of regular cleaning for you too
You'll never have a dirty carpet again if you call my good friends at dry concepts
They will do it for you and they'll give you a written guaranteed price up front before they start doing their unbeatable job
Tell them that Hank sends you by them and they will pee in their pants, that's Hank Guerrero
Call dry concepts at 9.54, 3.70, 7.78, that's 9.54, 3.70, 7.78
Don't forget clean today and entertain tonight with dry concepts
The biggest name of the best talent in this is the Eurotrists 4.2560
This is Mark Morgan, it's the 12 to 1 hour on QAM
At 5.60, WQAM, your advertising dollars will be well spent in the capable hands of WQAM's correct sales staff
Thank you, Eurotr, I gotta steal some cigars for me
Yeah, oh this is my big chance, Gil's gonna hit something time boy
Hello
Hello, and I'm interested in buying spots on the George Rodriguez show
I'm in the other eye, I might not be a good idea
Why?
Well, he's not a proven talent and he can't be proven with only two shows away
And why isn't he on every day?
That would be unacceptable, see?
He doesn't uphold the high moral standards of the WQAM sales staff and we'll say, how about some nice things?
You wouldn't want to buy any spots on reruns of Neil's show, would ya?
Evan, we already heard all those shows
Well, sure, there's so much easier to sell and I'd really like to go home now
No thanks
Wait, wait, we're running a special on all best of tapes with Alan Burke and Mark Shindbaum
Hello, hello, Valorah Holler
Oh, not again
Only WQAM has tapes and tapes and tapes and tapes by time on tapes and it'll help make our job easier
Cove or two, ya make it easier, I don't think they got any job anymore
I just looked on the drag concepts website, you know, dragconcepts.com
Yeah, this piece of copy, somebody ought to be behind bars for what they're doing
I'm not ready to stage, there needs to be a major, forget about what's happening in Iraq, what's happening with Iran, forget about all who killed Kalk Raven
There needs to be like a major congressional investigation into what's going on over there
Because I just only had the Broward number and I thought to myself, I'm sitting here wondering
Well, is there some kind of a change over there? No, there's not, in Dayton Palm Beach
They still got the same tool free number, 1-800-248-5071
And their website is still dragconcepts.com
Not what you of course made this excuse for a piece of copy
See, that was where I made the first mistake last week when I started bitching the truck
Yeah, come, I don't have a, that was where I made the first mistake
Careful, it wasn't for you
Because copy aimed us with this new regime we got
Seriously, this is scandalous, you ought to be up and running up and down the hall right now
And I was screaming like a child, like a war person
I'm bigger part, maybe if I cared
Well, I hate to break the news to you, but some of these accounts I've had on here for like 20 and 25 and 30 years
I love your ideas, I love them, they're great people
And so do I
And I'd like to hang on to what little I got left
Man, oh man, I got news for you, okay Chris Jones, whatever kind of crap you're playing back there
It's unacceptable, it is absolutely unacceptable
They have turned a case of the king, what have I been telling you since way back early part of the year?
And you're like, and you're right, I don't care
Sorry, I forgot I don't care
But when it comes to stuff like that
Katie Fumes over newsroom buzz about the new co-anchors says this week's October 2nd National Inquirer
Katie Kirk is seeing over rumors that are bosses at CBS want to bring in a heart-hitting news veteran Christiana Amman Poole to booster-sagging ratings
You know that old bag Christiana Amman Poole?
See, who just turned 95
What was that?
Oh my, lunch
Christiana Amman Poole, who know look at day over 98
Has worked for CBS in 60 minutes
Might be teched as a special correspondent or in what would be a major embarrassment to 49-year-old Katie
As her co-anchor on the CBS-AV news sources say
Oh my God
Christiana is a tabloos-sev-that-you-round Katie said the source
Katie hates being compared to a hands-on newswoman who does more than look cute and read the news out loud
While her much-hyped and publicized September 5th debut put CBS in first place in the network evening news race
She slept the third place by 9-11
She took back the lead the next day but it's questionable whether viewers will stick with her and of course they did not
To be fair, it's too early to know if Katie will turn out to be the ratings move
Miracle they're banking on other CBS-insteaded told the Inquirer
In the newsroom Katie is all smiles but the last thing Katie wants to hear is buzz about a secret backup plan including Christiana Amman Poole
Other Christiana has a contract with the Atlanta Bay CNN
Her name has been floating around at CBS since the summer when a top secret survey revealed the viewers favorite Christiana over Katie is a trusted news source
Trusted news source my ass Katie Kurek is a trusted news source
Ha ha ha
CBS denies any survey took place as the insider but the whisperers exist that Katie can't pull off a ratings win without a solid news reporter on her team
All of others can't even more than introducing Christiana's an even news correspondent is the idea that CBS could bring her into the New York periodically to co-anchor the program
For the time being CBS is sticking with Katie said the source but the world of television you can ever say never
They're sticking with it she found one like three weeks after their panic on you understand
Ha ha ha
Ha ha ha
Ha ha
Seriously is that Hank Guerrero anywhere around there because if he is I'm authorizing right now to put a bullet in where his brain is supposed to be

You may have heard that some girl has taken my spot on the CBS even news now unless you've been living under a rock
You know it's kitty Kirk. I've only met Katie once
She's pat upon me not on purpose perhaps but she pops her piece and when she does
Stip lies in every direction. Let's just hope the cameraman
Aware and sneak shields do not take my complete and total honesty for bitterness
Well, okay, take it for bitterness. They put me out to pasture and kitty Kirk sits there in my chair
With my butt imprint and says we're gonna give you a different way to look at the news

Christ
Funny past noon. I'll take the Lord's name and fame like that Danny Boyle. They'll get your ass off the air
Anyway, DNC chairman Howard Dean is applauding president Bill Clinton for standing up to Fox news is right wing boiling and propaganda machine
I do like that in that he didn't interview with you yesterday morning on Fox. So see here
This show you did your last little conservative hit job on me
What I want to know
I'm a question it was a perfectly legitimate question
But I want to know how many people in the Bush administration asked this question
Do you ever watch Fox News under sir? I believe you asked him and we ask plenty of questions
You didn't ask that did you know you did not use right wing suck up and a statement sent to raw story
Did you clear as the president Clinton that exactly what Democrats need to do in this election?
I told you how is the man, baby? We got Joe Bell. We need Howard Dean. We got Joe and Chris Jones man
I rather have Joe Jones remember Joe Jones you talked too much you talked to him. Yeah, you do
How about you got that song right there? I'll be a little stash your craft
How he deans his Democrats need to stand up to the right wing propaganda machine until the truth month
There you go Joe Jones
And Chris Jones and Hank Guerrero man and what you've harvested a glim we got back to its sales
I'll be doing 10 to 20 from personning the salesman. Oh man
Shameless
Why does that keep doing that oh because that keeps stopping it. Oh
Washington me out could you try to screw me up Washington Republicans attempt to twist history and recast the truth
Did not help us win the war on terror bring us closer to capturing or saw me a mama the mastermind did not allow the tax dean continued
President Clinton stood up for the misleading tactics of the right wing propaganda machine Dean said as the natural intelligence
Estimate that was reported on today showed the Iraq war and the Bush administration's failed policies have hurt our credibility
Winner war on terror and fact made us more susceptible
But what was a more dangerous place?
Gonna take a genius to figure that out. No, it did not
Let's see and look at I think we're gonna change the cartridge in there
Your cartridge
No, there's nothing wrong with my cartridge. Don't you understand? I just put a 200 cartridge in there a couple days ago
It's not on this end. That's what I'm trying to explain to you all right on this end. There's all right
So let me ask you something. When was the last time there was a technical problem on this end? What what what's
Doesn't mean it's not gonna happen someday, but it hasn't happened yet. It isn't happening now. Okay, there's it isn't happening now
Brown cows say repeat after me. Okay, but there's really nothing on machine can do to generate that line on this end
Okay, I'll say you what have Eric facts me something. Okay. All right anything
You're telling me that this
Lada and didn't you tell me on the log that there were all these black lines before anyway before you said it to me
No, no, I'm waiting white lines. We kept going back and forth. I said that it's faded out the lines that they were giving me were faded out
Please add this you rep start list down in street dot org you knew we'll love it. Okay. Whatever you say
Are you gonna have Eric your facts me something just the facts I just told him
Bush's church urges pull out of US troops from Iraq. How do you like that? Bush's church says when in doubt pull them out and the troops too
President Bush's own churches called for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq and his urging direct action to end the war
writes mark show junior United Methodist Church later helped launch a week of protest and
Civil disobedience against the war in Iraq by sending a declaration of peace in the capital
urging President Bush to pull US troops out of the country
The declaration of peace and on September 21st is described as a call for nine violent action when the war in Iraq
The Washington DC if that was one of 350 stays nationwide if we want the peace initiative
More than 500 groups almost happen in faith organizations are involved in the Declaration of Peace ever
Which recently retired Bishop Susan Morrison said includes acts of moral witness to seek a new course for our country
We need a moral witness. We need the parliaments to sing. I want to testify
By signing the peace document in front of the White House the United Methodist and other protesters also hope to influence congressional races in November 2006
By forcing candidates to outline where they stand in the war
Speakers of the DC rally accused the president of lying about Iraq
Possessing weapons of mass destruction and launching what they called illegal offensive better late than never
Our demand is a movement is to end the war now to Bishop Morrison the declaration calls the situation in Iraq and endless fire consuming lives
Resources in the fragile possibilities of peace and this all coming by the way one of generals are telling rumble that they need billions more for the army
And they're away way billion short and that he's a crazy person to see that I saw it
Where's that facts Eric? He said it would take him a minute because his machines got a warm up. Whatever that means
34 protesters attempting to deliver the peace statement to Bush in an active civil disobedience
Disobedience were arrested and charged with the certainly conduct
None of the United Methodist protesters participated in that portion of the ways activities
The declaration of peace initiative provides a way for the faithful to vent their anger about their rack Morrison said
There are a lot of frustrating that a methodist out there. We don't know where to channel it
They're pissed off and fired up
They like that his own shirt says cut the crap
And they won't do it. They won't cut the crap
Course not
Frank rich writes stuff happens again in Baghdad
Well, this is long perhaps time to read it now before the break course of that
I do have time to read how can any Christian support the GOP. That's a good idea. I get advanced in your pants
I'll take a chance. This was on smirkling temp. All right. Should any Christian support the current version of the GOP
This might seem like an odd question considering how so many have come to things you O.P. stands for God's own party
The evidence refuting this notion. I don't have time to do this. Okay. See. Why did you let me start doing that?
I don't know. I didn't know how long it was sabotage and Eric still hasn't said the facts now
There's a lot riding on this facts when this comes over my machine if it's my machine
It's got a recently put in their brand new one what you call the drum drum. It might just need to be a shook-in or something
Shaken. Well, let me ask you this if that's the case. How come the log came to there like nice and pristine Christine? Huh?
I don't know but he wasn't doing it then. Who was doing it? I'll say I did for what it's worth
I just unplugged the plug guard back in took the cartridge out shipping around
I'm gonna tell you know that Hank Guerrero in sales. Yes. I would take that plug have him drop his pants
Then right over and stick that plug and the whole of a fax machine right there

You're still doubly as a bite, and somehow I think you're there just for sure.
See this before it happened all the time, you'll never make this within real is the better stage.
This scene is full of time and still, things won't get better over there in one day.
Coming days to right, or making a sacrifice I know
The notion of somehow politics that might not be the prime expression are some kind of a thing that might find your past.
Yes, please won't be nice, but this is what this video will go.
If you go so smoothly, she will surely make all the needs of people to notice these fires, don't hesitate to let reason two catch the people.
She is to order fairers, or what Katie Kurik is to her journalism.
You got it? Con of reason? She fixed her teeth at some point.
Who's that con of Rosalie there? They stole all Gappy.
No, no, she's got all new teeth now.
I think she took some of them piano keys, and she snapped him on her.
I guarantee that one of them had an orgasm during the interview last night on 60 minutes.
She is. Maybe both.
Anyway, Eric's facts, and I hate to break the news to you as usual.
I just know one of your mother hates you like boys. That's all I know of life.
And your kids. And your dog.
Right.
Here it is from Eric, and this page is as white as your pasty face other than the print on there which I read very clearly.
It has no black stripe. It's got no smudging, no munching, no problem.
It's a clean machine, man. I'm trying to tell you this.
Okay.
And yet everything you just haven't even been there long enough to realize that everything in that place is a piece of turd.
Don't you understand that?
I do understand that.
Don't you get it?
Having you had enough experience with that machine there, man sitting to your left, that piece of crap, but see that's not generally the way things work.
Except at WQAM. In fact, you know something in life.
And that's pretty much the way it goes.
Things, the way things work in life are generally not the way they work at QAM.
A lot of facts, machines will print a stripe on your teeth.
Just like when you asked somebody for a piece of copy for an account that you've been doing over 20 years on here,
and that they would go back and they really would make sure that they had all the correct information on there,
instead of just putting a bunch of words on a piece of paper to try to pass it by me, which is the new routine there where the sales crew.
And by the way, when was the last time Chris Jones came in there with those updates and how all these accounts are vanishing like crazy up in Eric?
Yeah.
This is not just the gang that couldn't shoot straight. This is the gang that ought to be shot is what it is.
Shot. As in Marge.
Remember her?
Drash does.
Yeah.
And you remember Marge shot?
Sure.
So there it is. A nice clean page.
And he arranges in Toronto, but September 25th, I've got a...
Thanks Eric for identifying my existence, okay?
Because I've always got to keep proving this to you.
It's not on this end. Don't you understand?
God.
You're still not hearing it.
No, I heard what you're trying to say that there's no way that you can generate that.
Well, guess what?
Something in that, my favorite line.
There's no way that that's not usually the case.
When you've got a print thing like that, it's usually on your printer.
But it's always on that end.
This is in the first time this has happened.
This has happened many, many, I would say...
About 30,000?
About 30,000 times. This has happened. It's always on that end.
Don't act and I won't tell.
Am I supposed to be some kind of a maven on facts machines, on generating black lines on white pages?
What kind of line-o about such crap?
Not at all.
All I know is I have two fine machines here, man. Both identical.
And they both work just fine.
You know what I'm saying?
We're fine.
I'm saying cut the crap.
How many votes we got on here?
Cut the crap, Hank, you're weirdo.
By the way, I want that child in there tomorrow morning.
Before the show.
Okay, let's play the pipe machine back in there.
I'm just telling you.
I want to have a discussion because this...
I may say to you I don't care, but there are certain things that you can't not care about.
When people are spending their hard earned money and some jackass back there is just things that
I put in a bunch of words on a piece of paper that that's getting a job done.
Bringing somebody off the street, okay, and putting them at a desk doesn't make them a salesperson, okay Chris?
I hate to break the news to you people.
That's not the business, that's not the life we have chosen.
Maybe it's the life that you have chosen.
What I want you to do is at two o'clock, I want you to call Greyhound.
And I want you to find out how much it is for you to run away...
Listen to me.
For one way trip to Raleigh, North Carolina.
From Miami.
Okay.
I'll pay for the ticket.
Okay.
Put it on my credit card.
Does it have to be bust?
Pack up two Salami sandwiches with Swiss, make sure it's safe.
253 votes on the pool.
The politician I trust the most.
None of them, they're all crooks 429 over a third.
Over a third I got the wisdom to say that and the courage.
The car horns man, the big balls, the big sweaty balls to say it.
Bill Clinton 279.
He's still P.O.D.
A lot of people have to ask all.
Tell the truth.
I would.

Whatever has we get me sure I like
I'll be trained
So this breakup I feel
is the best thing for me
Those strippers are mine
Absolutely
I feel self-intentioned
when they seduce me or Jessica
I do
She don't you
Yes
Of the rest of my life
I'm in another half-wise
I do
She don't you
She didn't talk to control
I guess I'm just in a hole
I'll wait until she say this to you
If they displate that's leaving me first
Yes
Yes again I attended my suit a few wounds
I guarantee he was cheating on her for a long time
and that's as with girls either
Really?
Well you know he wears an earring and he's not
1247-13-1
and by the way I have no idea why you wasted another sheet of my thanks paper
Because I remember two
Because all the work and I used it in the air hose
In the air hose
I showed the air
I spritzed it out
I would say this way the black lines down the middle are somewhat less than it were before
I mean still there but if not quite as dark as it used to be
Kind of like when the airbrush the OJ picture on the front of the time magazine
Well they may be able to do it going to be more thorough
Yeah
I blow a little harder this time
Maybe stick the tube
They're a little bit deeper this time
There you go
When the doubt clean that baby out
And of course all of these things contributing
Here's the evidence
You know like if we were in a court of law
Here's the evidence he's blown it out and it's cleaning his act up on it
And the fact that Eric sent me was so the page was so clean man
You could have lunch right off of it that's how clean it was
I've gone Eric thanks
And of course he had to warm up his machine a little bit
Haha
Hi
You know picture this hand crank Russian made with two bags
Well he's in Orlando you're forgetting now
They don't have a new fangle technology either
You know like thanks machine
Things like that
Don't be knocking Eric Oki
That's Josh's department. Leave that to him
And just in honor of that I'm gonna send Josh 400 stories for that
No matter if it's a matter of fact I think you're good right now
I think you're pretty much you're done
Are you excited about that?
No because I know you're lying
Well no I mean look if there is
Okay
You're gonna fix your ass
You're gonna fix your ass man I'll send you 600 stories
I'm gonna send you a story from the weekly reader
From readers digest
From better homes and gardens
From men's life that'll teach you men's life
You know the kind of people read that magazine
Yeah
Why not all the Democrats do what Bill Clinton did right?
Senk Yuger
He's co-host of the young Turks the first liberal radio show to Air Nationwide
Again a serious satellite radio is first original program
And is now nationally syndicated available on iTunes
Oh it's speaking about tools what happened to all our stuff on our my
Did we find out about that on my space?
Find out about what?
How come everything disappeared on our my space page?
Oh let me check it
What do you mean let me check it?
It's gonna still be the same
It's like cleaning and pristine like all day
You they were probably doing some maintenance that happens a lot
Oh my space?
Yeah
Well Scrum your mama
Your mama's so socks in hell you idiots you lunatics
In addition to which yesterday we had 619 the friends
Now we got 618 we lost one maybe somebody died
Hmm
Maybe chicken that go back
It is?
Yeah
Oh, totally
Anyway this is short and sweet right to the point of what we were both just saying a moment ago
Is there anyone who wants to build Clinton if you want Fox News Channel who didn't cheer?
Is there anyone who thought wow that seems like a bad idea I wouldn't want to do that?
No everyone loved it
So if everyone loved it why don't all the Democrats aggressively challenge the right way media like this?
Amen
It's about freaking time
What are they afraid of?
There's no excuse for not taking these guys on we have the facts on our side
We should be crushing them like this on a daily basis and sir you happen to be
Absolutely correct sir
Sank
The reason everyone is having such a positive reaction how Bill Clinton took on Fox News Channel during the interview
Is because we're star for it
All the current politicians do is soft pedal them capitulate
Kick their ass for the love of God
We love it aren't politicians supposed to do things that appear to people?
I know one other Clinton who might be able to learn a thing or two from this Clinton
Now that he's led the way again
Please pick up on his cue in fact as Marcella's Wallace would say in pulp fiction
Pick up a lead pipe and blow torsion. Let's go to work on these guys
I love it
If you didn't see the Clinton interview and then it's got some clips on it
We've seen it
Anybody hasn't seen it's been
Been busy you're watching football
Watching Michigan's table or 400 point lead against Notre Dame
But at least my boy Brady Quinn came through she I can always say that right even though I don't believe that
How can you keep trying I mean they're just there are just some teams that have a curse
You know on Michigan state always blows big leads to Notre Dame
And of course they what happens is they get on the backbone with the Pope and he says a couple of broccas like that
And then they put the curse they put the Vatican curse on there even though the game was right there when he's lancing
Same thing with a papiates and the Broncos man Jake Plummer's got their number
He's probably got naked pictures of Tom Brady
And I'd like to see him
Comment on 88 votes on the pool will have right up around 13 ever by the top
They are we can do 14 today would that be nice to start out the week with 14 hundred that'd be something
And by the way, we can sure use a lot more pool ideas
So got some good ones here still from a Sean and I last to thank you very much on God bless you
But it ain't easy you're right about that. That's the only tough thing. It is plus following another sports show
That's not easy either. Well, I'll tell you that August month. Wow. Did you see what we had in the morning and August?
Yeah, according to the ones some holy moly a one-eighth I believe men
Wait, we could do that listen
From 60 ten in the morning
But even the song just the center
So it didn't rain down
I
Would you think I didn't like blind melon I played that before I don't know because I'm not that well
I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about Josh
He was in a back he was shocked well because I know your music taste is old yeah, yeah
It's not new I know 90s buddy. It's my yeah
But if you think I'm gonna sit here and start playing hip-hop crap say that rules man, you're crazy. I'm not playing that garbage
I I don't disagree with you. Well good. Good. Thank God for that. I always I always knew somewhere
There was like a ray of hope. Can I please read this article my very Gary Vance in your pants
I wonder if he's getting a David Vance you know the advance used to drive a buffalo raceway and Vatavie down
That would be a real hoot some days to like rent a car and drive down the buffalo and drive down a hamburger to Buffalo raceway
Wouldn't it be something I wonder how Duff is doing the destroying that account there at Pompano Park
I wonder if they're still open wonder if my buddy Wally Hennessey's still having a great year
Nice going a Wally what a percentage he's got I know it's been I'm sure you've been watching that
Sure he's not getting parked the whole mile like Brad Pramer out there come on Brad hit him again
Beat him with him
See don't start with that harness racing for the many just blow the whole audience away when you do that
It's bad. It's really bad. Next you're gonna be talking about Hollis and Billy Rieger on here
And the audience is really gonna get upset Gary Vance
They should any Christian support the current version of the GOP this might seem like a not question considering how many have come to things
GOP stands for God's own party the evidence refuting this notion has become overwhelming the times come for Christians of every step to reconsider
Who may endorse and vote for many democratic candidates have become more open about the religious faith during this election cycle and an attempt to appeal to a Christian values
You're in voting block critics on the right ridicule of severed is being nothing more than shadow in since your religious
Grandstanding these skeptics are obviously fearful of even a minor exodus in the ranks of the once loyal army of
Conservative Christian voters will cost them dearly they should be afraid very afraid the GOP record is
Become so broadly defiled that every genuine Christians should readily disavow support for the Republican agenda is the democratic agenda
Any more compelling to voters with Christian values than the Republican one the answer is yes
In spite of the fact that many Christians view most Democrats as being on the wrong side of issues like abortion and gay marriage
Those same Christian need to wake up and realize our Republican Congress and President having passed
We can propose significant legislation on those vulnerable issues the democratic positions on poverty health care human rights
The environment men and women's church and equality for all citizens are much more compatible with genuine
Christianity than what the GOP offers the GOP has been perpetually deceiving Christian voters with empty talk and promises
Meanwhile they go about their dirty business of encouraging the rape of our environment
Waging an innocent necessary war under false pretence illegally spying on American citizens while immorally detaining and torturing prisoners and secret
Guilags they do all this while cutting taxes for the wealthy denying a living wage to the working poor creating unprecedented
National event and slashing funding for vital programs assisting the poor second elderly
This is the harvest reap from six years of our Republican controlled federal government
Jesus said we would recognize as followers by their fruit Democrats can and will do better when he say Jesus was a fruit
Jesus Christ there is nothing Christian about this current perverted version of republicanism GOP insistence on flying the Christian flag over
Green and evil of this magnitude only shows them to be cynical hypocrites at best and blatantly
Antichrist at worst
Elantichrist go baby. Oh my god George W is the Antichrist
How do you like that? Is that like LDablo? LDablo. What's that? Who you go?

Yeah, now maybe automatically mine goes to like Wikipedia dot C or some I don't know
But are they rate I did see that it's cute
Yes, it was very cute although mine still has got those cost of comments about you and the fact that although you did a
Helvet July man August they got a little tired of you and I actually the whole
Space was way down in August if you can't when a whole thing goes down like that means we just didn't get any diaries
They got some wired diaries across the street, you know what I mean?
Well, make it look at Blaineport in other words like once every year and a half they get a month
You know what I mean sweet and wait another year and a half and by then they'll be well

But nevertheless, it can bet on me
Retired military officers today are going to bluntly accuse defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld of bombing the war in Iraq
And say US troops were sent to fight without the best equipment and that critical facts were hidden from the public
How do you like that?
Absolutely correction
Or in other words
Absolutely
I believe that Secretary Rumsfeld others in the administration did not tell the American people the truth for fear of losing support for the war in Iraq
Retired Major General John RS Batist will say today based on remarks prepared for a forum conducted by Senate Democrats
A second military leader retired Major General Paul Eaton will assess Rumsfeld as in competence strategically, operationally and tactically
Although other than that he's great
Mr. Rumsfeld and his immediate team must be replaced or we'll see two more years of extraordinarily bad decision making
Not just bad decision making but extraordinarily bad decision making a statement prepared for the policy forum said
The session is being held six weeks before the November 7th midterm elections in which the war is a central issue
How do you like that?
That's extraordinary
Where did George go?
Is he doing an asin-dos?
No he's busy on the phone right now fixing the facts machine
I'm getting a lot of money
Well I'm getting a facts repair thing I'm almost done
Oh okay
Take your time
Because that's a bad machine mom
There's nothing worse than getting stuck in the back of my team
Taking a party to insurgere on it?
Yeah
Give it a good blow man
Cute
That's it
Speaking of blow
Jerry Falwell, blow hard
Big fat face turd
Nothing will motivate conservative evangelical Christians to vote Republican in the 2008 presidential election more than a Democratic nominee named Hillary Clinton
Not even a run by the devil himself so he says fat face jury
That was the sentiment expressed by the Reb and Jerry Falwell long time evangelical icon in other words
Blah blah blah blah blah
Crazy person
And father of the once powerful moral majority during Prepper Marx Friday to church pastors and activists as part of the values voter summit hosted over the weekend by the country's leading Christian conservatives
In other words, aka farbicinagoyam
A recording of Falwell's comments was obtained by the LA Times
I certainly hope that Hillary's the candidate Falwell said according to recording she has 300 million so far
But I hope she's the candidate because nothing will energize my constituency like Hillary Clinton he says
Cheers and laughter filled the room as Falwell continued if Lucifer ran he wouldn't
Whatever that means I guess in other words he wouldn't energize as much as Hillary
Got it got it
Falwell's voices then drowned out by hoots of approval
But two people in attendance including a Falwell staff ever confirmed that Falwell said that even Lucifer the fallen angel synonymous with Satan in Christan theology
Would not mobilize his followers as much as the nearest senator and former first like in other words even LD obelow
Wow wouldn't motivate them as much as swallery
I totally they hate that bitch
One critic who's been observing the conference said Saturday that Falwell's words offered a rare glimpse in how religious conservative leaders are planning to inflame opposition to the Democrats with below the radar messages
He was calling Hillary Clinton a demonic figure and openly arguing that God is a Republican said the Reverend Barry Lynn director of the Embassy of the Americans United for Separation of Church in state
It's hard to know where the people thought he was joking or serious but once you start using religious imagery and invoking a politician this way it's not funny said Barry
And a default said Saturday the Lucifer reference was an off the cuff comment and that Falwell had no intentions of demonizing her
In the past he's described Islam's prophet Muhammad as a terrorist and said abortionist feminist gays and lesbians were to blame for not loving attacks
In other words he's a crazy person as if we didn't know that
Falwell's remarks about Clinton were part of a 40-minute address at a private breakfast that included the assurances that God would preserve a Republican majority in Congress
And then moderates such as former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani cannot be allowed to win the GOP presidential nomination
No, we have to have right-wing fanatics just like what we got now like Bill Fist people of that oh my God
Who is this pasty faced brought who looks like she's got a mustache or what?
It's actually captured in Indonesia in 2002 with being she's got a pretty with a little bit of makeup but she's got a mustache
There last year British forces are now saying that they killed him in a raid in the southern city of Washington
Oh British forces killed his suspected terrorist who'll be there's one of the Holy Month of Ramadan
It is normally a time of peace for Muslims across the world but here in Iraq
But here in Iraq Ramadan weekend is only brought more violence and actually very little hope amongst Iraqis that there would be peace
I guess somebody forgot to give her the memo. Do you know the memo I'm talking about? No.
It says unlike previous years when maybe Ramadan was a time of peace now it's a time to kill some people
Right. I like that. All right. All she was a very attractive whoever that broad was but she had a mustache
Maybe she was in that movie Trans-America I was talking about. I think Josh might actually like it
I don't know. What?
Oh, you have a pretty good track record of recommending movies to me. Not all of it. I think you might like it. It's cute. It's funny. It's got some very funny stuff in it.
Anybody anybody who has secured their masculinity as you are isn't going to be worried about. I saw Trans-America. Who cares? You know, you know like it's funny
It's got a 7.7 baby. How many movies on IMDB have got a 7.7? That's a high number man. It's got a high number. I give it a knee-eye

And the office name is a God 800 letters in it from the Washington Post details how L. Paul Bremmer and his underlings enlisted cronies and
Apparachics rather than those who might actually know anything about the country's people or their needs.
Thus we settled a rack with Bernie Kerrick, GOP fundraisers and politically connected young
ideologues, chosen over more qualified applicants in New Arabic.
They saw Iraq as a guinea pig for a relevant and doomed experiments including an anti-smoking campaign and an elaborate American style stock exchange.
The book, while nonfiction is as chilling in a dynamic of America's tragic cultural myopia as Graham Greene's prescient 1955 novel of the American debacle in
Indochina, the quiet American.
Our diplomacy efforts were equally toned after Iraqis and their neighbors in the early going to state to permanent hereday Madison Avenue
Whiz who made sunny TV testimonials about America's love of Muslims.
These ads won no hearts or minds but wasted tons of money in even more valuable time.
Now this job belongs to Karen Hughes, the presidential flak, who's paganizing photo up toward the region last year and mostly ridicule.
Our broadcasting outreach there is supervised by a long time Karl Rowe-Pal Kenneth Thomlinson, who last month was filed by state department investigators to be using his office literally to run horse racing operation.
One of Mr. Thomlinson's thoroughbreds is named Karzai and supposed it honor the Afghan president.
I think I better stop at that point. It's too long.
I'll finish it after the break.
But first, yeah, I said another test. Did it come through?
No, nothing happened.
Okay.
How long would you do this?
Five minutes ago.
How long?
Like five minutes ago.
Five minutes ago?
What do you want to hear what it says on my fast machine?
Nothing. There's no facts on it. There ain't no nothing on it.

No.

Great.
1336 votes on the poll we need 64 in 47 minutes to get to 1400 during the show today on a Monday.
On the first day of Ramadan, on the right after Russia's Shana,
when everybody's getting ready to blow the chauffeur,
I think it's pretty damn impressive.
No, you? Yes, it is.
And above and by the way, it's still like foaming at the mouth.
They love it. So in that clip, who did Fox's video on the show?
Yes, he did.
You did your last little conservative hit job on me.
What? I want to know.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm asking. You know, no.
I'm asking.
No, it was a perfectly legitimate question.
But I want to know how many people in the bush and the rest of you ask this question.
There you go. And of course, do you ever watch Fox News?
Of course, I'm sure you would say, I don't think so.
My sister's got that kind of like, super loud.
The biggest name, so best talent to be this is
the Euro Rogers Force Radio 560.
The UAM.
The brother of the father of the father.
They weren't the buffer man.
They weren't the buffer.
I think it's something.
That's a crap.
In the face of the first dress like a bad day, I did you.
I think that dress and drag the dream to be changed.
It's an exact day.
It's called a brainless circle that lay in the air.
It seems all you got is you.
It's just that C-O-N-A.
Who writes a dash of talent into the Alabama.
Welcome.
Kane's girl is the don't wear a hat.
It's meant to tell the Alabama.
I want to tell the Alabama.
And we'll take your back.
Got a smelly bug right?
We'll build it with sound.
I want to stand for you for a while.
I want to know that we can better never argue first.
I'm afraid I think I'd give out my name
with what I call a blowering.
It seems to be the thing that is the Alabama.
As a bug drag hero, we can't live the Alabama.
It's a bug for the Alabama.
And it's got a sound.
One 19 at 560 W.Q.
There's your buddy Hermann During Rumsfeld.
I'm going to be a big chuckle.
I'd like to ask you about the decision to extend the deployment tour of the first game,
the first armor.
Oh, yeah.
He's going to tell us anything that the mighty resemble the truth.
So you send me three coffees of this test.
And the good news is each and every one of them are just absolutely as clean as a whistle.
Obviously, I wasn't planning on sending you three coffees.
It just was the reason that all of a sudden it cleared up so nicely.
Well, I want to thank Mark.
It couldn't possibly be that I was right.
And if the problem was on that end, you're a bad machine man.
Could that be it?
It's possible that you were right.
And my machine was dirty and Mark from J.M.R. laser industries called up and said that
I needed to clean my strip.
So he told me where to find it.
And now clean up your act.
It's clean as a whistle now.
Thanks, Mark.
Thanks, Mark.
God bless Mark, man.
Thank goodness we got somebody out there who knows his ass from my elbow.
You are so freaking stubborn, my God.
Clean your strip.
Clean it.
Get out that long tube.
And clean that baby out.
And I don't know why it wasn't faxing.
But when I plugged it back in, that's when it sent everything that was in the buffer.
Well, it was it was it was resting, man.
Does that it everybody needs a good rest like me.
I'm going to take a few months off.
The kind of plate my life with these bastards.
No, seriously, that thing.
I want that sales manager in there tomorrow morning.
I'm telling you right now that this business of playing hide and seek like his predecessor,
that's not going to cut it with me.
Can I get back to Frank Rich?
It's a long column, but at least it's worth it's worth.
I know they're not paying attention to it anyway.
All they want is to hear the sound of my voice.
There you go.
See the song.
All right, as long as they know they hear my voice and they know they're still alive.
That's the South Florida test.
How do you know you're still alive?
You hear a radio.
Our broadcasting outreach there, he's talking about a rack of course,
supervised by longtime Carl Ropeh out Kenneth Thomlinson,
who last month was found by state department investigators to be using his office
literally to run a horse racing operation.
One of Mr. Thomlinson's thoroughbreds is named Karzai and supposed
an honor of the Afghan president.
If that's his idea of lifting America's image in the Muslim world,
he might as well be on Al Jazeera's payroll.
On Wednesday, ABC News reported the bottom line of such PR misfires,
a confidential Pentagon survey found that 75% of Iraq's Sunni Muslims support the insurgency
up from just 14% three years ago.
Speaking before the event last week, one may be the run up to our new war,
Mr. Borsch was still on his battle for civilization kick,
flattering Iranians as much as he had the Iraqis.
We admire your rich history, your vibrant culture,
and your many contributions to civilization, he said.
All Iranians have to do is look at the Baghdad Museum today to see that such words are worth no more now than they were in 2003.
It's symbolic of the energy throughout Iraq's capital at the museums' entrances are now sealed with concrete
to keep out new hordes of killers and thieves.
But the violence which seems as spiral with each declaration of new security crack down is old news.
More revealing is the other half of the museum's current plight,
it's found hands of Iraq's version of the Taliban.
That said, development is another symbol standing for our defeat in the larger war of ideas.
The museum changed hands in August when Donnie George, its longtime administrator,
and the chairman of Iraq's official antique sport,
fled the country fearing for his life and for the pressures in his care,
both at the museum and the country's main archaeological sites.
Mr. George is a Christian and had good reason to fear.
The new government minister placed in charge of the museum,
a dentist, is an accolade of the radical Shiite clerk, Moktada Al-Sader,
who goes to make or whack a fundamentalist theocracy.
The minister of Sader and his followers, the museum's legendary Islam antiques,
talking back to the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, are infidel idols to be sacked.
You might think, given Mr. Sader's radicalism, that he's a fugitive terrorist on the lamb as say,
Abu Moussavela Zerqawi was, after all, Mr. Sader's militia,
they mocked the army as they fought of death squads, and for the sectarian warfare.
He's an enthusiastic ally of Hezbollah besides,
but he is instead a major player in the democracy we've installed in Iraq,
controlling at least 30 of the 175 seats in the parliament and cis-government ministries,
including the power centers of transportation and health.
Back in 2004, maybe he's kin with off my child by too,
he's probably a good buddy with him, Bunkbut buddy.
Back in 2004, the Americans made plans to take down Mr. Sader,
but as Larry Diamond, a senior advisor to the coalition authority in Baghdad,
writes in his book, Squandered Victory, those plans were shelved for various reasons,
including political calculations in Washington.
American forces arrested some Sader aides last week,
but such periodic skirmishes notwithstanding, his influence continues to grow.
He is a crucial ally of the Prime Minister, Nuri Al-Maliki,
who would not be in office without his support.
In the past few days, both Tony Snow and Condi Rice have reaffirming
that the administration has what the Secretary of State called,
enormous confidence in Mr. Maliki despite Washington's shadow of the contrary.
Not that you would lie, you understand, through those teeth.
One of the first Westerners to warn strongly that danger of someone like Mr. Sader
was Gertrude Bell, the legendary archaeologist,
explorer author and British political officer,
who masterminded the unlikely carbon together of the modern Iraqi state after WW1.
She warned that a Shiite theocracy in the new country would be the very devil.
As it happened, it was also Gertrude Bell,
a creator of the Iraqi National Museum in 1923.
The fortunes of her museum once considered the finest in the Middle East
have been synonymous with the fate of Iraq ever since.
That's because, like any such national institution,
it's not merely some building that houses art,
but a repository of a country's heart and soul that America has stood helplessly by,
as Mr. Sader folds the museum into his orbit of power,
as his ominous appredicator of what lies ahead in this war,
as was our callous reaction to the looting of 2003.
For all of America's talk of stamping out a murderous ideology
and promoting civilization and democracy in Iraq,
we're now handling the very devil, handing the very devil the keys.
El Diablo, here's the key sweetheart, drive safely.
How do you like that?
I'm trying to el-sotter my ass.
A lot of devil stuff going around.
Yeah, a lot of devil's, baby. The devil made me do it.
The devil's in the details. El Diablo.
1361 votes, we're going to make it to 14.
How do you like that?
You know, you can try to live on that one month again.
This is a year and a half after that bogus April they got in 2005 across the street.
Like I said, they have a hoot on our weed of talk, you know.
Talking deep parts with ones and twos.
What kind of numbers that even Lawrence Wilk is doing there? One and a two and like that.
Yeah, that's what he's doing.
In his gravy's rolling over thinking of ones and a twos and even like a...
Oh!
At night, that's crosses three.
What's that?
Lawrence, well, baby.
Get out of here.
Oh, alright.
Our schmaltzie, huh?
This was a hit.
Is there something that four people appear?
Calcutta.
That's the name of the song, Calcutta?
Yeah, 1911.
That's riddle in four people appear.
I know that song.
It was, I'm sure.
It's a movie.
What's that?
Calcutta, which is now known as...
Now what is Bombay now?
Mumbai.
Mumbai.
Mumbai.
Mumble jumbo?
Yeah.
It was good with gumbo.
It's like in Orleans.
Man, we got the game in New Orleans.
I thank God they got the Superdom, I'll say, for the New Orleans Saints in the NFL.
People in the hospitals, high schools, grade schools, people living in their racquetty houses.
Those people are still off tours.
But man, we got the Superdom, ready.
The biggest name.
It's got economy, though, like in the days.
The wheel Rogers.
Sports radio 560.

For nothing.
I have a dream.
A dream that one day, there shall be a failing reality show called Survival.
And a sale this show, they shall take little white children and little black children and little Asian children and little Hispanic children and say,
they'd drug eight down from one another, I have a dream.
I have a dream that please children will one day live on an island where they will not be judged by the color of their skin,
or by their ability to eat a dumb beetle without vomiting, I have a dream.
And when this happens, blacks and whites, Hispanics and Asians will join hands and sing in the words of Jehovah's.

Yeah, hell it's not.
We're gonna have a book out. You both are you.

Never never thought of that in a million years.
There was a medal here. They were one at wonder.
There it is.
Now what's it called?
Reach out in the darkness.
Nice laugh up.
With the president general pervert was
Shareful way understand the trip to the US and Canada A at a time

Many Pakistanis speculated he'd been overthrown and have sent you but the chairman of the

Thanks God.
Information Ministry officials accompanying with share from his visit announced on

Chris they wouldn't have far to go.
The Islamabad the capital is quiet late in the night and there were no signs of

But for hours with power flickering on and off in Islamabad and have the country
Still without electricity by late evening.
Maybe they thought I all got moved to Iraq.
Rumors continue to swirl away possible coup against Musharraf.
The army general who seized power from Pakistanis last elected leader in 1999.
As part of that good democratic aircraft that we're trying to build up in that part of the world.
Army generals who seized power and and coups things like that.
Kings like Insadi Arabia and in Jordan.
Good old Middle East and democracy.
Like in Israel where they blow up lesbians on into little pieces and butcher a whole bunch of people.
So the oldest cluster bomblets that are all over the country now like any olive trees.
So thick and it'll teach them to attend.
Yeah they're like slim pickings.
Speaking of that bit we just played three former college football teammates as senator George
Allen of Virginia say that the Virginia Republican repaintedly used an inflammatory racial epithet and demonstrated racist attitude toward blacks during the early 1970s.
Surprise surprise.
Allen said he came to Virginia because he wanted to play football in a place where he knew blacks knew their place.
So Dr. Ken Shelton they white radiologist in North Carolina who played tight end for the University of Virginia football.
He when Allen was quarterback he said he used the N word on a regular basis back then.
He wanted to play football in a place where blacks knew their place.
A second white team made his book on the condition of anonymity because he feared retrovution from the Alan campaign.
Separately claimed that Allen used the N word to describe blacks.
It was so common with George when he was among his wife friends.
This is the terminology he used.
As in the jig is up.
Oh that's not good either.
What I'm with.
You thought the white team can contact it separately also spoke on condition anonymity out of fear by being attacked by the Virginia senator.
Said he too remembers Allen using the N word though he said he couldn't recall a specific conversation in which he used it.
My impression of him was that he was a racist the third team.
He said no. Makaka.
Shelton also told Saland that the future senator gave him all these like Jesse Helms and all these other strong thirmin.
Why is this such a surprise to anybody?
I guess these people have never been South of Binghamton right?
Right.
It's not a surprise and everyone's pretending like they have been putting on a big act like they just have been.
If you're from the South you're usually in word and you're a bigot and a racist and a narrow minded hateful piece of third.
Shelton also told Saland that the future senator gave him nicknamed wizard because he shared a last name with Robert Shelton who served in the 60s as the Imperial Wizard of the full clock's plan.
The radiologist said he decided earlier this year he'd go public with his concerns about Allen for reporter ever called about four months ago when he heard that Allen was a possible candidate for president in 2008.
Shelton began to write down some of the negative memories of his former teammate.
He provided Saland excerpts of those notes last week.
Yesterday morning, Saland spoke with David Sinepp, a spokesman for Allen Senate office to ask for response to the recollections of the former teammates.
Email and phone message were also let for Bill Bozen they spoke to the on campaign and decked bottoms the campaign manager needless to say.
As a matter of fact, Chris Levy they consult today on campaign hung up when a salon reporter reached him and he can't be drafted in who he is today.
Additional attempts to contact the pain were on successful.
Let me say it again.
The racial attitudes of Allen a once formidable presidential contender for 2008 to become an issue in his higher consented election campaign against the web former Marine and author last month.
Allen videotape calling an Indian American college student Makkaka and have spear word for monkey that is also used as a racial up the thought in some parts of the world.
And he's trying desperately to backtrack.
You know, he's kind of like it's in his hind legs like those grasshoppers.
You know, just like the Pope. Oh, I didn't mean this night. I didn't mean sure he did. Okay.
Why not at least be honest. Come on. Say you're a big it's just like the Pope come out and say it. Okay. And on his clergyman. That's right.
Just like a ferricon. All right. If you're going to call it a gutter religion, at least don't pack away from it.
Aren't they all low? Brain has to be in the gutter. Really these bubble mice. These baby all these fairy tales.
All these people dovetting in and went all these silly. Oh my god. And we're all we're trying to do is live out our little lives in the midst of all this madness.
That's all the rest of us. Just leave us alone. Please. That's all we ask is leave us alone. Count us out.
Remember the song count me in by Gary Lewis and the playboy. Count us out. When in doubt can leave us out.
Have all your religious wars kill each other. Have a good time. Do what?
Do you want to leave a little something on the plate for the rest of us and leave us out. There he is. Gary Lewis. He's Jewish and the playboy.
Now when he came back from being not with the traumatized, there was a trauma because he found out that Jerry was his daddy.
We're going to say he came back from Vietnam and he was in the speak for like months. That not a whirl. Yeah.
Shalshaka. Either the battery found out that the Jerry was still alive. Lady. You know, you'd be a Shalshaka too if Jerry Lewis was his father. Especially when his head blew up.
I was speaking of that. Well, I don't have time for that right now. I got to do the break. That's some things.
I don't want to get back to that inquirer stuff. I wasn't very impressive this week. You know, except for that part. And then Josh got with you all bent out of shape about what's your name?
I mean, I love it. Huh? Mixed new squeeze and NASA. Mania. Medea. Manio. Okay. Don't have to get angry about it now. Man. I haven't heard him so animated about anything.
She must be a fairly a lukewarm. Huh? He's all over the head of that. But okay. Well, there's two pictures of her. Now I re-analy here. She is.
Now the one she looks pretty good. But the other two she looks nasty. She looks like J. Lowe on doggy downers. She doesn't look like a he-mean while starting to look really.
Oh boy. Little on the porcupine side. Yeah. Of course, after all that time with Jessica, that would drive just about anybody crazy. Maybe he ate too much of that the chicken of the sea chicken.
You think that's it? No comment. 1380. Had a line. But now did you see the picture of her and I'm sure you did because you got the inquirer. Thanks to me. She looked pretty sultry. Yeah. When you agree, she's all right. Yeah. She is our. How dumb she is. Right. 1389 on a poor.

team of Ireland, they're ecologically diverse. They're like little strange
animal. They're like little monkeys. Some of the habitats in which they've
been found are primary forest, disturbed in secondary forest and river
riverine and the coastal forest of Nipa. I have no idea what this is of
mangroves. Longtailed macawkas are most successfully
and disturbed habitats and on the periphery of forests. In Thailand longtailed
macawkas occur in ever-reinforced bamboo forest and deciduous forests. Oh
God, I haven't seen that word since high school deciduous. Not exciting?
Thrill, I have no idea what it means but I see the word deciduous. Now I know
why they taught us that word because there's some day you may be reading some
boring crap on a year and it'll be deciduous. The body for a longtailed
macawkas tends to be gray brown to reddish brown. The noses, the sliders and
nostrils are narrow. Oh, I don't want to give them too much of that. Wow, that's
not good. More of that George Allen crap. A mature modest and almost
scandal-free George Michael for this age in his first solo concert in 15
years aren't you excited? But the pop star couldn't resist making another
controversial dig at George Bush. At the end of the first set Michael sang his
2002 controversial anti-bush song, Shoot the Dog. During the Nubrite enormous
balloon depicting a cartoonish George Bush rose out of the center stage
drawing whoops and yells from the crowd but the real surprise came when Michael
leaned down to ones at the balloon's trousers and out popped a British
bulldog grape with a uk flag. The dog was stuck to the balloons and played a
crotch wagging its tail. Think there might be a message in there? Maybe?
There you go. Let's see, here's the facts and I can actually read it. Now the
thangs of Michael or whatever the guy was. Mark, Mark in the dark. Hit one out of
the park for us. Spuddy or nasty, hostility. It's on your land. It couldn't
possibly be on this end. There's no such way it can transmit you right. You've got
to try. It was my script. Your strip? Yeah. But I'm dressed now. Sorry. Now what

Susan McDougall by the way, there is a lady with the biggest pair of balls in

in solitary confinement for civil contempt of court. After refusing to answer
three questions from independent counsel, the Amtis Kenny star before the whitewater

book is available at Barnes and Noble for additional information called Elna
Lawn at five six one six eight six twenty six. Or go to Elna Lawn. I can't
read all that. At any rate, tonight, seven thirty at the Kravitz Center

one of the truly great Americans, somebody who had the guts to stand up and was
willing to, you know, for the courage of our convictions, not make up a story to
satisfy Kenny star. She's somebody, in fact, we ought to vote for her as writer
in for prison, wrote writer in for something writer in for governor. Hey Charlie,
how's Charlie Kristo and is he still? Oh, nothing was anything wrong with that. Oh,

Although a good triple cheeseburger, bacon cheeseburger from Wendy's sounds awfully
