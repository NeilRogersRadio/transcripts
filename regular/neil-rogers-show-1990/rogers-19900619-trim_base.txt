Hello.
What is that chronic idea?
Okay thank you so much.
I would agree with that.
What is just out of control and just pathetic.
Let's see did Mark tree for man figuring some stuff out here you know because our programming department can't figure this stuff out.
Let's go to four lotterdale W.Y.O.D.
Yeah the the brown chair is out there opposing his record store.
Yeah.
The sound like copies of two I crew that was right.
Well I got to raise some money you know.
Time's good.
Listen I got a good idea you want to know how they could straighten out radio stations.
It could open up radio stations.
Yeah.
Open up a station called W.Y.O.U.
Yeah.
Meaning that.
Well very keen.
Very keen.
Very keen started one called W.I.O.U.
I was going to say that next but you took the words right out of my shoes.
But anyway you know you have people coming in and they request their songs for a day and you're like winners.
For a day you can enter a contest.
Yeah.
And then when you win you go in.
But if you don't like the idea then forget about it.
I know what I'm gonna forget about it.
I know what I'm gonna forget about it.
I know what I'm gonna forget about it.
I know what I'm gonna forget about it.
Okay Tim that was Tim William was a little distraught that jaded and picked up those DTR listeners.
Okay you'll be okay Tim.
20 so new in a W.Y.O.D.
We have an open line in Dade, one in Brown, one in Palm Beach.
I feel like we're sitting here for something they like the numbers.
Let's go to Volka and there's nobody there.
I don't think anybody there wants to do that.
That Volka line.
I don't think so.
If my recent memory remembers W.Y.O.D.
Yes, Laura, please.
Who is it?

Laura?
Yes.
Laura's long trip.
W.Y.O.D.
Okay let's try Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hey Neil how are you?
Okay how are you?
Well I got a phone to pick.
Everybody in this damn office makes a fun of me for listening to you and calling you all the time.
And I think they're all a bunch of douchebags.
What do you think?
My mom would come to me.
What do you want sir?
What do you want?
I'm gonna put on you trying to put on a show to impress your friends sitting there.
Is that what it's all about?
No.
Well what the hell do you want?
Talk intelligent.
Talk some issues.
Talk something meaningful.
Issues.
Like capital punishment.
Why?
For people who make calls like this.
Why?
Because that's what this show is all about.
It has some substance.
I like it better with the fun show like you know.
No sir.
Well the fun ended.
The minute we punched up your call W.Y.O.D.
Hold on a minute.
That was Randy.
She's practicing W.Y.O.D.
What is it?
Right.
Right.
Brian.
Yes.
What do you want Brian?
Brian.
You son?
Okay 1142 at W.Y.O.D.
And speaking of that time to talk about Charod right now, they're waiting to serve you a fantastic fresh lunch right now.
And now for those of you watching your weight like FedRick, well, all what people around the country.
Okay.
We've got all these ridiculously bad numbers.
We have a depressing day in Johnny Dark, who can't keep his own nose over at the coast, comes in here to relate to me that he just had a call from Super Dave.
Okay.
Now if he had any brain, he would have put the call on the phone on a receiver immediately as soon as he heard that voice number one.
Okay.
So if you want to know who keeps encouraging Super Dave to bug us and that you agree what?
The what do you talk to him for?
Can't you say goodbye or is that lonely over at the coast?
And he's telling him about some obscure video guy and some stupid thing from WNWS.
It's got a thing on it.
It's got my name and it's really Steve Kane and people are going to be watching this all over the country.
What the who cares?
Who's going to see it?
Six drugs in which it's on?
Get out of here.
Go away.
Go away.
What do you want?
Oh no, are you even getting women numbers?
We don't have anyone listening to this station.
Do we have anyone on these women?
Hello?
Yeah.
Hold it.
Hello?
Yeah.
Hold it.
Hello?
Hold it.
Are you a mobile?
No.
You're a mobile, right?
No, no, no, no.
Hold on.
Hello?
Hi Neil.
We have a lady right there, I told you.
That's one out of four.
So that means that 25% of the women in the market listen to WIOD.
You got it.
Right?
You got it.
Hey Neil, what's going on with Waxi in love 94% of any parts?
Do they want?
Do they have any ratings?
Do they have any numbers now?
No, I don't.
I don't.
First of all, it doesn't mean anything yet because Videl was there during this whole thing, okay?
Yeah.
So you want to start to see that for...
How I see what the little man and the hat's doing?
The little man and the hat?
Well, let's see.
Let's just take a look at 18 plus the little man and the hat in the afternoon.
I went from a 32 to a 42.
He is kickin' butt over there, okay?
They have turned the corner.
They're going to destroy the market.
Yeah.
Greg and Rick together we're getting stereo.
The picture is they call them yesterday, I like that.
Okay, thanks so much.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Nice hearing your lovely voice.
Thank you.
Bye.
1147 at WIOD where we're dying over here.
WIOD.
Okay, good one.
Let's go to Hollywood.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yeah.
Would you please...
Sir, would you like to give us your name and address?
We will send you a WIOD promotional paper played in the extra charge.
I already have a picture.
If you send us the stamp.
Can you believe that?
Big time radio station, we go out, our promotion where people drive all the way from a steward.
Talk about loyal listeners from a steward.
Do you know how far a steward is, sir?
That's like in Yannem'svelto, the Chinese would say, okay?
They drive all the way down, sounds of the falls.
And we autographed the back of a tool for 15, 10% paper play.
And we say thank you for listening to WIOD.
Would you put it on any side of the one that got caught and got an answer?
Sir.
Sir, are you out of control?
I wish.
Can you take a leave of your senses?
I wish.
Don't you realize that it's trashy crap like death that's caused us our entire sophisticated listening?
Any audience with WIOD?
I can't believe it.
Clear.
Thank you.
Well, I was driving down 9.95 the other night.
Somebody nearly cut me right off the road.
I decided what I'm going to do any good to get mad.
I wrote a song about him and said, it goes like this.
First people, and then for, or did you work it, it's your whole life.
Any other way, it worked out fine.
It's your assholes and dies.
Get your name, FFH OLE.
Don't you try to blame it on me.
You deserve all the credit.
You're an asshole tonight.
You're an asshole.
You're an asshole.
You're an asshole tonight.
I got a feeling.
You're being an asshole when the whole of your life.
You're an asshole tonight.
I was talking to your mother.
And in the end, you told her, tonight.
I told her, I caught your an asshole tonight.
I think you're right.
And all your friends are apples.
Because you know they have your whole life.
Somebody so mean.
You've got an apple for life.
For you more than apple.
Or did you work in your whole life?
Either way it worked out fine.
Or you're here in it.
You're right.
Holds nice.
Okay, let me 51, and WGW, thanks for the help, Gary.
Let's go to Miami. Hello.
Hello.
We couldn't have done it without the programming brain trust.
Yes, sir.
How you doing today?
We're doing it.
We are doing it, sir.
Can you play something?
More than what we're doing.
What's that?
We're dying over here.
I'm dying over here.
Good.
Can you play the Burp commercial for us?
The Burp commercial?
Yeah, I haven't heard it for a while.
I heard it on Rick and Puts.
Yeah, Suz is really hurt.
What do you mean by that?
He's just...
He's bothering me.
I don't know.
You're not the one that called him up the other day.
That moron that called him...
No, I heard it on the other day.
No, that wasn't me.
Well, a lot of negative colors, you know, this...
I keep trying to emphasize.
I know it's a waste of time.
But like the old Cubans, man, when they get the diaries...
You can listen to me.
It's like voting.
Okay?
You understand?
There's like a loyal listener.
They're obsessed.
We here at WYOD, we've got these like wishy-washy
and they're all bitching and complaining on what they want.
And they're not loyal.
They don't support us.
And one of these days we're all going to be gone.
We're all going to be digging bitches out in the middle of Y75.
And they're going to want...
Gee, whatever happened to all our good fun and crap and stuff, you know?
Right.
Just ragging on them.
Never mind.
I've never really disliked them.
Never real life.
But they're doing a good job.
They're fine.
Can you play the burp?
I've got it now.
I'm waiting for you to say goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
One in seven Americans suffers from a terrible affliction.
And while others find it funny, to those who have it, it's no laughing matter.
It's called frequent burping syndrome.
It's terrible.
I'll be on a date or a business meeting and...
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Do you want to have it?
Frequent burping syndrome.
It can ruin your life.
But it doesn't have to.
Now there's a clinic that can help.
Trained specialists sensitive to the needs of compulsive belchers.
A special place known as burp hinders.
Gosh.
Burp hinders saved my life.
And Joanne and I were in love.
I really wanted to ask for the marry me.
But I just knew that when the moment of truth came, I'd let out with a big ripper.
You know?
Burp hinders.
No shame.
No guilt.
No more tummy rumbling.
Smellied belches.
No more stopping and mid-sentence.
The one for a big cheesy blaster.
Just carrying professionals.
And they help you need.
Still a plate.
Here's the number to call.
By...
2, 8, 7, 7.
That's by...
By...
Burp hinders.
Burp hinders.
Calls a day.
And stop being so gross.
Let's see.
Here's women 18 plus in the morning.
And of course, that's love 94.
His big thing is women 2.5 to a 27.
Now Greg, you never had any numbers anywhere.
You're not going to have any now.
So join the rest of us.
We're getting used to it.
Let's go to...
See, I guess Alice was right about that.
Number is me nothing.
Right?
That's what Joy always says.
But you know this.
It's always the people who don't have any who say that.
Like me.
Miami.
Yes, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Question.
Why is it every time the book comes out?
You always go through it.
It's arbitrary.
It's supposed to be arbitrary.
When I'm supposed to worry about that, your team is so far to radio.
Yeah.
What are you worried about?
Yeah.
I'm not worried I say I was worried.
No, no, I'm not.
But you read it all the time as if it means something.
It doesn't mean something.
It does mean something.
Sure, it's our livelihood.
I was on it.
I don't have.
Yeah.
I was in the business.
And I went to number one in Northeast Louisiana.
Oh, man.
That is what I always wanted to do that.
Be number one in Northeast Louisiana.
Yeah, especially a town called Talula.
Yeah, that's my favorite.
But I mean, tell me.
I mean, this stuff doesn't mean anything.
Yeah.
Tell that to the people in Atlanta, okay?
A cops broadcasted.
Well, they got to have something to go by.
I just like the cops got to stop you and...
We did have it.
We just got to call from Atlanta.
You know what they said?
What?
They're phone with you and looking.
Yeah.
They say.
What did I mean?
You know what I mean?
What it means?
I'm dying out of here.
No, it's fine to me.
I think I got a lot of money up there.
They don't care.
They love us.
What I would like you to play for me, even though I've never requested anything.
Yes, sir.
The Rambo is Barry Manolo.
If you can find out, I know it would be an oldie, but goody.
Rambo is Barry Manolo.
Yeah, that was one of the old burges to play that.
Who?
The guy he used to have.
Rambo is Barry Manolo.
Yeah, Barry Manolo.
And Rambo and Rambo, we don't have that.
Yeah, it do.
With the Barry Manolo, I want to just play, but that's not the same one.
No, it's an oldie.
We don't have it.
No, no God.
No God, sir.
No.
Oh, well.
See you to get out.
I try anyway.
See you in pre-ord.
Huh?
I say, have a nice day.
Bud load to you, buddy.

A good trip.

mass occurred in germany and made fun of in Miami now they're here live for one night only
two live juice boys boys boys we were posting up some bigot justice people as you please
when in washer of curbs said hey you'd be bankrupt these they dragged the fool away they thought
of the best i said hey were you two Jews are going there be plenty of luck
new live Jews catch the door before they get caught
new live Jews take it's available at all belly counters and how take the master locations
another concentration camp production
okay now this i want to pass it along i think this will impart to the audience what year
he just came in and sat down and Diana agreed to a cut very sharply under the neck
and uh he said to me with a smile on his face what do i think now what what can i think i think
that the next trend will go up dramatically because Rick and Puss will have been here and things
are in place i did say that last time but we have to keep saying that until we get canned okay
well no i do think it's going to go up there all we're trying is always about a month behind
in this market no i never see the purchase why the purchase is an increase well who's got it
the same in all well please can i why don't you pull it off the wall so we can
the propaganda is here in pretend we're really doing it a birch is so bogus anyway we never do
anything in birch what do we got like a two so the birch is hanging in the hallway boygaria is
going to rush right in with it and we're kicking ass in birch but anybody with a half a brain
knows that birch is bogus but i got an idea if we're doing good in birch let's start saying we
think that they do a great job over birch and we're really doing it as birches a joke okay let's
see here we go my any four-letter day what is this for this is the new uh the one fall to winter
well what the hell is that mean i don't like this number so okay well listen are we on the list
i don't see us my any four-letter day i'll the right column what is this man talking about w i
the three seven fall of eighty nine it's missing oh man i'm looking at numbers that are so
microscopic look at that like a three seven go ahead and don't be confused by borgia or he's
to head brain damage it for man oh excuse me okay well i don't need my glasses anyway to read these
microscopic numbers i mean my magnum vision reading glasses from rn area now i got them i got them
i see fall oh i see the winter part is missing that's what it is i od 18 to 49 in the fall
two nine winter of three nine this is what he's trying to pedal okay like somebody's really going to
believe this zeta fall of eighty nine of four four down to a three nine in a winter zeta is
dropping and they have no excuse what is ap we don't have a call in the bat line from peter borgia
to try to alibi for their crappy numbers over at zeta okay i mean we know alibi about ours i
mean we just think all right we admit it but the zeta has no excuse because gtr's going to
weigh the wind did you ever listen to gtr bayon in the coast yes really hey listen when you
going to get your haircut over it the dions placed over the hercelon you'll be able to hear all
that wonderful stuff they're playing on the coast because they're doing it their music is great
it's outstanding and in his mild but if he gets that stuff off the wall i'll be able to tell you
what a great job we're doing here at six ten w i do we moved all the way in twenty five to
fifty four according to birch one two three four fifth well so what's a big deal about that
oh that's overall i see that's the whole station okay can i reach this far you think like
hi alia hey how you doing okay i reached all the way over and punched up highly i'm pretty proud of
myself what a guy yeah what a guy did you see the you know what they said in hi alia
but soon with the unlucky i'm gonna eat the commonly that's exactly what they said they said the
nick the bottle rules mon did you see the piece about with approval setting the the turf record
world turf record no sir yes with approval candidates 1989 horse of the year posted a world record
two ten and one fifth under jockey Craig Perett well i was sadder the sunday best ever for a mile
and three that was sunday that was the race that that was my one winner at calder still is the
gussama cast from belmont i wasn't yeah i didn't make it out they didn't know he had a whopping
four sixty but it's better than tearing the ticket up but he really did all right yeah great
and they bet the new york crowd but in fact it called her to they bet that seven horse with
santo's down the way down to six to one or seven to one and he ran a gray race and with approval
sent behind him the whole race and then came out in the stretch and uh... kind of drew off but uh...
santo court did a good read huh you paramount no sir uh... i can't believe calder didn't turn that
perfecto around you're not about that he never does he used to and he's been doing for two years
now he keeps saying well i'm gonna go back and bet the way i used to i don't know how in the world
you can but i can understand if you've got a heavy favor like the one you just mentioned on top of
like two or three different horses then you don't turn it around if it's a lot okay but where you've
got two horses that are pretty good price and you bet a ten dollar perfecto how can you at least
not put a five or ten dollar perfecto the other way around unbelievable and he will not do it he's
just a stubborn old me yeah yeah yeah yeah uh... there's a card i haven't heard in ages
gillenslock beer oh jeez you're not going to believe it i can't believe you're asking for that
you got a regular hand no i don't but i know i do not a couple of weeks ago when they were begging for
cards because we were also begging for paper plates and cards at the same time um
i cleared out a bunch of cards and i thought we'll never play this again so it's history i mean
it's not it's on a it's on a disc somewhere but i have to card it up again what is it so in other
words don't hold your breath well but thanks for the fine thanks for the thought okay thank you
yeah fine let's go to see if i would have had it then i would have been honest about a
day and i would have had to stop you from cutting my hair and turn around and go through the rack

quick one of this i want to emphasize if you never bring to char-hut if first of all if you've

the brower county cops world best to give me fifth he said you go to jail boy i said what do you mean
he said the brower county sheriff's this rattan is the scene he said you swear he's gonna jail

nickbrain nickbrain or get lost on a nickbrain on the mind of a nickbrain
dictated by a nickbrain as they pulled me from the car they slammed the store on my soul
i yelled instead of dirty word a word we all know so many threw me some ground and he hit me with
a stick he said you better watch your mouth just dirty little dick i said respectfully
you know what i thought the whole thing stuck he said you should have watched your mouth
because now you're really stuck he's a back he's a squad god and off to jail quick
this brower county sheriff's guy must really be a nickbrain nickbrain or get lost on a nickbrain
from the mind of a nickbrain dictated by a nickbrain
i'm the way to jail the couple of cups of him and caught i said you guys better watch your lips
remember where you are he said we swear if we want to there's nothing you can do
this lawy man for justice man for punks like you when i went with the judge he asked
this cop what did i do they both said i was charged with players too loud
screw up say come on you gonna drop the case this thing is really sick
the guy who thought the whole thing up is nothing but a lawy man nickbrain
worked at the laws by my name reign from the mind of a nickbrain
there with me is a man reign
i'm a man
he may be the body of man reign
this law was called a pie of man reign

pro 46 at w.i. do we didn't have a mobile and four-lotter day on they cracked out
because we were playing that thing they want to spend the money cheap skate
w.i.o.d
yeah nil
your back this was you right
yeah nil let me ask you something i'm calling for my car i'll make it quick
you're going on vacation can i ask you what area you going to
what area i'm going to
say in the country you going to Europe between the earth and Uranus
really you think it's advisable i mean you were ill for three weeks you were out
you think it's advisable still to take off this time considering the ratings and everything
what is it and are you like a programming expert
no i'm just asking i know for job security i mean if my job is questioned
i don't know let me say two things to you okay first of all i'm not insecure
and secondly i have a contract okay uh-huh well in that case you don't have a
nice vacation and play out of trouble okay bye bye sweetie
what uh what a oh man kvech what a kvech job security
like while i'm away they're going to have randy you know it's going to take over the show
i mean she's a very nice young lady and she's fun and you got a good sense of humor
and she used to be married to jfk so please have pity on her
but i mean i'm not worried that i mean of course when boy gary is at the helm anything is possible
and if they want me if they want to write me a check for the rest of the year and a half
that i have to go that's fine i don't think they want to do that i don't think they're panicking
although it is interesting when he comes in here and he says what do you think of it
i'm not the program director i haven't molded this operation okay
i mean everything is relative and this show still has the highest numbers on the station okay
not what they used to be by any stretch of the imagination but it's that shrinking your
audience syndrome again and next month when the entire spring book comes out if it doesn't go
back up all the way around then then this time to get insecure and start to give your subred hot
dog stand tamarack gone see and i'm not even going to say it i'm not even going to say it
doca on the line seven nobody there okay is that a good example now this see i could go in and
tell him what i think what the problems are but it would be pointless because where there's no
sense there's no feeling because you can keep repeating the same things here for like a year or
20 years and as rhanerius found out you're better off just keep your mouth shut and you know leave
right off when you get off the air every day and not say anything because they don't care
w-i-o-d you're not gonna speak neoport speaking deal how you doing okay long time we're

strategically uh like i'm gonna analyze what i'm gonna i'm going now because i need the rest
right hey some of these people don't understand life is more than a job whether it's this job

Elvis for me and do you have the Elvis is everywhere no i don't know i don't i have that's on a

a job here and see what i learned to recognize the early warning sign twitching lift
that's the end of the drama when i wake in here i'm all shook out incredible weight gain more
weight because at Elvis and out of this we understand but impersonating Elvis is not a career
it's a disease will be tender will be sweet give us all the prairie so close so much you can to
l a no if members to the city and thank you thank you so much you like a little

many times can you listen to the same song over and over and over again but in other words you don't
like music no i like music i just don't like the same stuff over and over and it's almost
like that is laxie no not even close close to the cast julie what the coast is outstanding uh i
i don't like it at all i mean this is the only station i listen to is well i'm great well you

where that's the same guy that says Rick and putt suck oh i know that's that's the alcohol guy
the one the alcohol guy oh it's i heard his nephew yeah camera hello yeah man here yeah all right
Neil all right this question is a little bit for me i can see your opinion it's a little one
a little less track than what you're talking about right just like what what are we talking about
i don't know if you know what's just going to be a bad call is that it
no it's not hold on a second hello
okay now zimp and that was zim far a long distance on air but i'll let him hold for sayon what is it
i got some trouble over the weekend for the first time my life um my early 40s i was arrested
all right they're my third defense and i like to know it to you know my concern if you get
if you guys a judge and he said you had your probation for the first time do you think you get a
criminal you get a criminal record or will you just be in it and so the rest of your life
yeah for you're on branded is the criminal for the rest of your life there will be a little
ball and change your front door your ass is grass pal listen i came into explaining something to
you mr doom and gloom what what are you what is it now i'm gonna buy the numbers the book
he came into explain the numbers no i know you know what you're talking about but i want
all the ladies i read if you'd have been sitting here yeah and looking at boy gary sitting in that
chair with that stupid idiotic glia she'll look on his face yeah saying what do you make of it
and then bringing me the birch the birch is so birch is so funny that you can have a hernia
laughing okay mean birch you know actually does good in birch yeah i rather have birch
beer any day that birch joke but i can't explain something we were ready to go down in the afternoon
you know why we only have one more ready to go down but i mean in the book okay we only had one
month it started April 24th right we started here April 23rd so this is one month and two months of
Alex now Alex was not going to morph like med for right i hate to bring the news to you what but i've
been here a year and a half no i just came in here to protect my butt however i will remind people
that you were here most of my vacuum when i was sick in the hospital okay well then sure in those
down numbers roll it to the chart well i mean you're trying to cover your hands with that two nine
no what i was going to say is it started we started April 23rd yeah and the last three to the
book last month started April 24th yeah Alex if he had a three and a two and a one which probably
left with about a one okay the average would be a two for the last book right well even if we
brought the next month up to a two we were lost the three so even with us being here we were ready to go
down do you follow that that's what we're going to do follow that first of all all i can say of this
when the spring book comes out the whole book okay if we don't go all go back up the whole station
when it occurs when area was smart he knew this was going to happen you just signed for three more
years yeah but like you guys and me and of course stand with history anyway it doesn't know it
um if we don't go back up they're never gonna crank out your records you're gonna go back up
that's what i'm trying to tell you i feel great i feel great about one i was expected to go down
do you understand that do you understand what i'm saying is anybody under what the hell am i
talking about do you understand that yeah you do yeah okay well we were expecting to go down
the fact we went up a tent is just marvelous miraculous unbelievable yeah but when you go up a
tent from a two eight it doesn't mean much no but at least we didn't go down see what we have to
hope see might disney is now on the like headhandshoek committee with arbitrage and like since that's
happened since he's been on the committee they can no longer find the i.o.d listeners every trend i
mean used to be like you get one bad one okay yeah every book then we started getting two now we
get three now you know they're out there because i've been doing this a long time i mean just look
at the phone you know they're out there hey and they're among 100 people with the sponsors in the
response they get and look at their most yeah and yet the new deal with arbitrage and look at look
it looks like it's an umber is look at a wacky well arbitrage makes the Spanish language and the
ethnic sampling that's going on between the Hispanic and black sampling there are no white people
who get diarrhea exactly okay and the white ones don't and the white ones don't send them back
except the middle 90 who like those uh those blues in the wipes that Alice is selling in a
moment why would you think for that if you to hurt that spot you better like them we may all be
talking about well we may be using them pretty yeah but do you follow what i say we've got a lot
of hair here before you see this listen you didn't have a lot of hair to leave it right in the
front it's on the floor you see this okay i see there's a little average right there that's Alex
yeah i see that too barely so like you see three two one okay you don't have to
spread it out okay this is also includes March so let's say we brought it back up listen
to me yeah this whole thing for all of us also includes exactly you can't fly arch was an
unmitigated disaster for the whole station it was the Alex Bennett Memorial Month okay and when
the whole book comes out would you an included March will be gone so if June is pretty good the
metal goose this whole thing up right at least a point okay now i got news for you if i go back
up over a five yeah next when the whole book comes out i'll be ecstatic you will you guys will
have to like a three five you should kiss we will you and when Yuri goes back up like about a
four eight or a five hill kiss Roger on the lips i mean that'll be great are the trends weighted
just like a ledge now are there used to be but they are alleged now i don't believe that yeah
but you see why we're expecting to go down even if we brought that up that the average between
this you that don't understand we've been expecting you'll back up for a long time we keep expecting
and expecting and expecting and expect to expect to wait i thought i thought this one there was no way
after the station got to a three six year they think we'd be going down again he was he might
as well drove away with cattle prod he did he's only been we've only been here a month you blow
away a lot quicker than you think a batch of cast on this well so there's that hex upon us all
it'll wear off in fact uh he was last seen before went back to frisco climbing one of my billboards
trying to punch those enormous teeth out my god damn throat i heard it's true if he had the ability
you would have done it yeah yeah well so do you understand this is a great day i want to say
i was not a great day i want to explain something to you i'm leaving
private i'm going to your bed how much back do we you're going to be happy and i don't really care
okay i mean i care but it's not like the issue this is my new home so i care so you should be happy
because i'm not unusual because i quite frankly i've never worked at a radio station where you
went out on a remote and people came from north Miami and steward and bokeh they don't they wouldn't
take any other decision i have let me finish i was there all the way down to south bay almost a
p-rime and we signed the back of gefs paper plates from the pizza long so it's pretty bogus
not even our own paper plate bogus so the evil twins in our programming office in there
not only have they are they overseeing the falling of the Titanic the sinking but they're
promotional between the billboards in the paper place we're going to have a poll on that tomorrow
and the next remote we're going to do is take the pictures on the billboards and put them on the
back of the paper plates so you can sign like on the teeth and roll down the mold with one year rule
uh...
well i hope i hope they're listening because i've been full agreement
wait a minute are you still there
uh...
i'm telling you i can't just
uh...
okay we're going to give them far side her shoes home phone number maybe you can call him up and
cheer him up a little bit is a little under the weather
so i feel real good i just came in to say well i'm sure happy that you came in now get the hell out
by the way you think reyny martins upset because i took a little up hope that um
no see i want to bounce this off because you know what i'm at with uh... boy giri is already all right
and i have a feeling because i said something to her the other day we're kidding around she's got a
good sense of the word and i said boy i bet you'd love to do this all the time and her face lit up like
a hannaka bush like she's uh... got it in the back of her mind or the front of her mind that she's
gonna be like my sidekick you know now i want to emphasize i work alone now i've been
and these numbers in spite of that one in tempered call from lakeland have nothing to do with the
bird the bird was a detriment the numbers on this show started going down before the bird left
and a lot of that has to do with stuff that went on here last year okay we can't and won't talk about
right okay right i'm in total agreement but um... so reyny or nice person but i know she didn't come
into that all i don't think that's and i think she may be able to listen if that's gonna get her
no cry yeah to yourっちゃ
right here
okay i want to talk about them every word
mobile
oral
f
from
handsome and
Falon
getting
by
said
b
yeah
so
business
The lawyer said she wanted big bucks and the plaza hotel.
The son of Donald Sonson walked into his room.
All that to find is big for a baby.
The first call comes to me.
I love his kids.
He wants a big heart.
He'll be that big.
But not only this,
like that he's keen,
by making her style a bring up shoe.
So cheer man,
to cock your flat,
to make Donald look by the silly.
To the calmness friends,
the whole ugly end,
like Donald takes with his willy.
Oh, don't want to smart.
He will make things easier.
And fun to laugh that was fine.
Yeah, just like that.
To do, to do,
to do, to do,
to do, to do,
to do, to do, to do,
to do, to do, to do.
I'm about to ask that.
You dare to bond him,
mess your match.
Take the cash,
the Donald's only a scratch.
And you'll be better,
you'll be better,
just as soon as this is over.
And I'm Donald's cycle.
So I'm back in his room,
finding more plans to do,
and reliable.
The post that Donald is gone,
a bladdering bomb.
And I don't need some
and every following one.
You say, what?
Just do, just do, just do,
come on down,
and we'll just do, just do,
just come on down,
and we'll do, just do,
just do, just do,
just do, just do,
just do, just do,
just try to get my stuff to go.
But when would you look at?

Meal.

Yeah, I had to tell you about this
mung brain friend of mine.
He's a cable man
and win more of all things.
Mm-hmm.
Anyway, he was telling me
about these oxygenated olive oil

We already played it today, sir.

I met her at an office.
I give anything to hear it.
You ride her orifice?
Yeah.
Okay, it's in the machine right now, sir.
Thanks.
Anytime.
Sure, because I have a feeling

That cart.
It's getting close.
It's like bubbling under Duane's stop.
Kendall.
You know, if we could pull that number up,
can you imagine what the station would look like then?
Yeah.

He's sick?
Yeah.

I don't know, he didn't stick at the coldest of the...
Or is he just spent a lot of time in the head?
I don't know.
Okay, I'm planning to call you.
You never heard before?
No, he just told me to let you wear it to hear that song.
I called his name.
Who's whistling on the other end there, sir?
I don't know.
It's probably my sister.
Okay, well, tell your sister to get lost.

Okay.
