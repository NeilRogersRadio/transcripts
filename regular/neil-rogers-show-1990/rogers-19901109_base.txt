Well, I drive up to Tonsamay, do truck in coast to coast.
I like my rig, I like the rule, but it's not what I love most.
There's a gal I'll left in Fresco, a sweet young fine name rose,
and the best dang fine about her. She lets me wear her clothes.
Well, I'm proud to be country transvestite.
And I love to wear the girls clothes all day.
Home day!
Lazy bra, a frilly blast, a silky negligent.
Now I'm still a macho tough guy in a hoop you'll understand.
I was born with a big black mustache and a six back in my hand.
But when I go out for more, I do it well for twins.
All worse, strapless evening gown and a nose gay on my wrist.
Yes, I'm proud to be country transvestite.
And I love to wear the girls clothes all day.
Home day!
I close my lips, tease my heart and sleep and lost a ring.
Now I like the way I'm living. Don't just be by my clothes.
I'm an old American, he man, I love legs, can he hold?
So don't look at me funny or I'll punch out your lines.
And the last thing you'll remember is a trucker in fishnet tides.
Just I'm proud to be country transvestite.
Travestite!
And I love to wear the girls clothes all day.
Home day!
Painted lips, padded hips, my shaved legs on display.
Yes, I'm proud to be country transvestite.
And I love to wear the girls clothes all day.
Stouled in muse, something views, well it sends us all my way.
Yes, I'm proud to be country transvestite.
I guess these panties hold on here.
Hope I don't get a run.
You know I hate that, I hate that.
You know when you chip your nail, nothing's like so far just terrible.
You know what I'm saying?
I could use a bubble bath, I really could.
And I'm going to go to the shop, I am.
I wasn't starting to play that because I see Randy as playing a thing tonight.
Country music, why do they have such fanatical fans?
She asks, I'm sure you're very concerned about that.
Guests include the program director of Kiss Radio.
As in Kiss this, the Nashville network and interviews with Marie and the
Osmond Larry Gatlin and Genie C. Raleigh and many more.
Ooh boy, maybe Randy's going back to Kiss.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Oh, oh, wait a minute, how are you going to let it go?
Finally, the baby has returned to the dance floor.
Oh, I don't care what my father says, I want you to hold me.
But now she's got a brand new partner.
Be quiet, jealousy, I'm trying to use the phone.
Yes, it's Jennifer Gray and Pee Wee Herman together again for the first time in nerdy dancing.
Hey Jennifer, what?
How about my big shoes on?
I know, oh, you stepped on my budget, jerk.
I know you are, but what am I?
Pee Wee, you always got to be so obnoxious?
Oh, not just that's the word of a dance.
No longer in a movie.
It's an excuse to release another soundtrack album.
That's so funny, I forgot the last nerdy dancing.
Now, showing it a playhouse near you will write.
T. Races in different, marijuana, deliciously different, marijuana.
Okay, that's a good point.
Come, drop them down the street.
We gotta use these walkers, cos we gotta be old bad people.
Hey, hey, we've got old monkeys, the children don't run us all over.
They say we smell candy funky, and they're all stupid and grown.
Pee Wee, make money from rarans, on that kebukhavi.
But I just wanna stay home, fix a nice dresser thing with no women.
Hey, how you were old monkeys, and here all who's in our hair.
This week we're on that TV, next week on Medicare.
Yeah, then right now, you're in Buddhism's home.
It's the mug, day morning meal, rudges show.
I'm see the floor.
Okay, that's great.
1118 at WID, you know you're still there?
Yeah.
What happened?
I don't know, you thought I was West Palm or something.
Well, where are you?
Boca, I said.
Boca, a roton.
Mod's close enough.
Yeah, what ever happened to Stan Major?
Whatever happened to him, he's alive and well in plantation, and life goes on.
Is he working at a station?
For Mike Wayman, I got a signed little autograph here when you're a big star, when you weigh 450 pounds.
I heard that last night.
The only station you'll see Stan had is probably Amico over there in Brord Boulevard.
But he's doing okay.
I heard you were mentioned on Larry King.
Yeah, you didn't hear the tape?
No, I heard it like around 450.
But will we have it on tape?
Do you wanna hear it?
Yeah, yeah.
Now, will you hold on?
Yes.
Then you'd come back and come, and I'll put you on hold again.
You're probably used to it by now.
Hold on a second.
Ashford and Simpson off.
That's not the right time.
Well, I've done that twice today.
That's three mistakes.
That's for that old bitch that called before.
Have a great life, Mike, and book up a little.
New Rogers.
Oh, he must be jealous.
He's jealous, isn't he?
I guess.
You know what they did today?
They said anybody here in Miami who's owed money by Larry King turning their headlights on.
I'll tell you what, I look like the full dam tower was going to the funeral.
I feel sorry for Neil.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, well, if you knew the whole story, he said.
But yeah, he doesn't make a lot of money, and he's been in that market a long time,
and he really would rather probably, he'd rather ride on his horses.
So he gets kind of sad, but he's been jealous the long time.
I haven't seen him in, uh...
What is this, 1990?
The last time I saw him was in 19...
77.
I only raised it back in 1977, and then he called me the day the near admittedly was a homosexual.
Uh, on the air he called me to thank me because I had had Sergeant Maclubick on the air the night before,
and he had heard Sergeant Maclubick.
His name is Matlovitch.
Matlovitch Larry.
Since passed on with AIDS.
Encourage people who were homosexuals to come out of the closet, and Neil had heard the show,
and came out of the closet the next day on his own radio show, and then called me to thank me for having Maclubick on.
And so, last time I've ever seen him, I was told him to.
And then I've heard some people like yourself saying he does this, but I feel very sorry for people who are kind of caught in that local web of jealousy.
Oh, I know, sad.
And I heard he weighed like 400 pounds, but I haven't seen him.
You know, the last time I saw him, I'd say weighed 350.
Okay, that's it.
Now, are you a homosexual now?
Uh, today.
Oh, this is Mr. Radio?
Oh, my God.
We went to, you know, wondering hung on so long.
That's Mr. Radio.
21 after 11 at WLD, and we have an open-line in Broward, 5249463.
Maybe pansy would be, I'd live up to that.
We have an open-line in Palm Beach, 655.
I can't believe it.
Now, listen, you always call from Daytona. He wasn't called from Maboka.
He called from Daytona Beach and lied about it.
You make a sick Mr. Radio, okay?
6, 10, 10, 15, 16.
Watch the matter, dear.
Oh, Grandpa.
Man can be such a...
Oh, here, honey.
Why don't you try some of this nice hot Luther Campbell soup?
Luther Campbell soup?
But Grandpa, we just had two lives, too last night.
I know, but this is all a different, that's all.
It's got the whole alphabet in it, see the little letters.
Hey, you're right.
Look, there's a bath and a you...
Yeah, you just try it, honey.
No, it's completely tasteless. Why would anyone eat this?
Why? You know, me so hungry, that's why.
Luther Campbell's funky soups.
Holy Cooked taste so funky.
You'll be tempted to eat it with a poop.
No, what was that you said in the home?
I said, fuck.
Oh, yeah.
Ooh, bad, bad,
Luther Campbell's the dog.
A word.
Okay, 1126.
Wow, we're doing it, you know what?
Let's just put that on Endos loop and go home.
Let's try Tamarack.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
I was at Pompo last night making my weekly donation.
Yeah.
And I ended up with a spy report.
I think week is my word at Pompo, no, this year, that's W-E-A-K, I've been real week.
I haven't even come close this year.
No, I just don't know the screen reader banana.
Do you remember Hinsdale Raceway?
I've never been there, but a new hamstring, man.
Yeah, rocking ham.
I've been there many, many a time.
There's Pugboy and Bucky Day.
Bucky Day, that's right.
In a desperate drive, Bobby Huntress.
Do you remember General Washington?
There's Beckwith, what was his name?
What?
No, Beckwith.
There was Ted Wing.
Ted Wing, Alex Winger.
Uh, where we go?
Vincent?
Do you know how much the audience hates this when we do it?
That's why I like to do it.
How about Steve Warrington?
Called, Steve Warrington's good.
He's that whole Warrington family man.
They can drive a horse about...
How about...
You know what Larry King said?
I'd rather be riding a harness horse.
That's what Larry said.
How about Green Mountain Raceway?
In Vermont.
Longsons closed, innit?
Roarongson, Scalhegan.
What?
Scalhegan, Downs and Main.
No, I'd never been to Main.
They got those great tracks like Cumberland and Scarborough.
Right, they do a 235 mile up there.
Yeah.
The, uh, but I have a spire report for you.
Okay.
Allen Finkelson's son.
Mike.
Fell off of a golf cart.
Yeah.
While working in Valley parking.
Might knock some sense into him.
No, it knocked money into his pocket.
He's on work as compensation.
When was this?
Uh, it happened last week.
I saw him at the track left.
You saw him?
Yes.
Saw.
Yeah.
And he was complaining about the fact that he can't go back to work in Valley parking.
Mike's always complaining because he never, he hasn't cashed a ticket in 20 years.
No, he hasn't.
I can't find the Hank Goldberg cart.
Isn't that enough to really may have frost your ass a little bit?
How about...
How about Pine Hollow's Stoodfong?
Does that frost you?
Who?
Pine Hollow's Stoodfong.
Don't know it.
Martin Feinder?
Yeah.
Harold Dancer Jr.?
Yeah.
Dr. J?
Dr. J.
I just thought I'd sneak him in there.
Okay.
I would like to take this opportunity to call two of my friends Oscar and Joey who will be playing rocket ball this afternoon.
Yeah.
Dooshbags.
Okay.
And I look forward to seeing you at the track.
I'm coming up tonight at the end of the lunch.
I'm coming up there tonight.
I'm playing El Ambaro.
Stay the hell away from me.
Okay.
Go away.
But I go down here.
Thanks for your money for Camilla's house.
Now just stay away.
Don't come anywhere near me.
Just stay up there.
You're a little table and Shmoos with Alan, the assistant major, de up there and leave me alone.
Hey, I got a great idea.
He's like a kisser that all I got to do is see him.
And immediately I just can't pick my nose.
Why don't you have a race up there for Camilla's house dinner?
Well, I'm going to talk to Alan tonight.
A Finkelson tonight is about doing something for Camilla's house.
You're all well.
We'll make donations and go up there and get a night of racing.
I got news for it.
They could build their whole new building with the I've left it pompin' already this season.
Don't leave me left it pompin' though.
You bet.
What about wheeling down?
Good luck.
Goodbye.
See ya.
Another Hylia call?
Hello there.
Yes, sir.
Five hours of sports talk.
All right.
Here we go.
In other words, you haven't even heard what Hanks's going to do yet.
You're already passing judgment.
Which is right next to passing gas.
Is he going to stay on sports talk now or is he just...
No.
Well, I find his own show he never appears there anymore.
Well, I wouldn't say he'd never appear there, but he's not going to be on that show.
Okay.
He's got his own thing.
They got their thing and he's got his thing and ever the twain she'll meet.
You're going to make him promise not to talk sports.
No, he's going to talk some sports, but he's a well-rounded guy.
And if you've seen him lately, you know what I'm talking about.
Very around.
Now, Hanks a fun guy.
He'll develop a thing.
Oh, speaking of Steve, you'll never guess who's new best.
Well, let me ask you this question before.
I don't want to try to sway you, but who'd you rather hear from me to 11?
Randy Martin or Hank Goldberg?
Stan Major.
Okay.
Okay.
Now, what is it about the thief?
His new best buddy in the world.
Besides Rick Siderman?
Alex Bennett.
Yeah.
Yeah, they met up there and while they share this one contempt, you know,
anybody who's hostile toward me is Steve's best buddy.
That's his whole thing in life.
Rick Siderman and Bob Kunst and Ellis Ruben.
That's the only guy that he knows that I like and it likes me as Norm Kent.
And that's his new motivation for why he's out to get Rick Riley.
Oh, yeah.
He's just a...
You know, I'll be honest.
I punch him up at all yesterday.
I think for about 30 seconds on a way home.
And what was he doing yesterday?
Open phone.
I don't remember what it was, but whatever it was, it was so terminal.
And I just punched it out.
I told you the novelty wears off very fast, okay?
Now, now he's grasping at the fact that Rick Riley stole Alex Bennett's job.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Well, he stole somebody's job over there at FTL.
He brought in, in fact, he did it in the most devious way of all.
He brought in his own sponsors and he blew somebody out.
Whoever was doing midday because they moved Mike Roberts up to 10 to 2.
So somebody got blown out to make room for him.
But he's still making 250 value a year.
At least.
Maybe half a million.
That's what he said.
I said, how's it doing working on commission?
Hey, you said...
Let's say you make 250,000 a year.
Oh, God.
Well, you can't teach an old dog new tricks, sir.
That's true.
Have a great life.
I'm going to give you a little bit of bread load.
11.47.
I'm going to give you a little bit of bread.
I'm going to give you a little bit of bread.
I'm going to give you a little bit of bread.
I'm going to give you a little bit of bread.
I'm going to give you a little bit of bread.
I'm going to give you a little bit of bread.
No, not yet.
I won't enjoy it supporting those.
Well, actually, any of Steve's sponsor's actually.
And then I was listening to Rick and Sides and he had a guy talking about pirated music
and Evan called.
Who did?
Evan, one of their...
Oh, Evan.
I got to apologize to Evan.
He was over at the remote at specs on Wednesday.
And I didn't recognize him.
He's got this funky little go-tee now and he looks so bizarre.
Well, he had...
What's up, Evan?
Yeah, he said he's an assistant manager at a record store.
And being in the industry, he knew quite a bit of what they were talking about.
By in paper the beer.
I'm glad you found that one, Neil.
Isn't that great?
I feel a lot better now.
Well, and I, like you say, I don't think Hank is going to do five hours of sports.
No way.
There's no way.
I mean, he'll do...
He'll enter Spursala Sports just like I do an issue, but it's not a sports show.
Sure, he has to get all his food topics in and he's big with the women, too, so...
He'll...
That's what we hear.
Yeah.
I think it's only a rumor.
I think it's only a rumor.
Well, you have a good day.
Only his hairdresser knows for sure.
That's true, and before I go, I'd like to call John and Jim Adouche back.
Okay.
Thank you.
See?
It won't come any better than Angleberg.
Turned about.
Bad house, doubt.
Listen.
Stand still.
All right.
Hello.
What earth's warm, huh?
I'll say.
You come your often, pardon me?
Have you been here before?
No.
First time.
What's your name?
Three way.
Three way.
That's nice.
I'm a bigot.
We have to meet you.
Bigot.
Right here.
You were here to get clean, you know what?
Oh, I don't know.
You were work around here?
I'm a waiter, but Ashley, I'm an actor, you know.
Yeah, you know, I know.
What could happen?
You probably need to rely on you.
Well, I'll say, but you know, with everything that's in the news and all, it's just...
Hey, you can start relaxing right now, freeway.
I brought something.
Ooh, she, hmm.
And freeway.
Not just any sheep either.
Look.
Wow, gold lame.
Pretty kicky condom, huh?
But here's the most important part, freeway, in the Pro-Teched Label.
Pro-Teched, huh?
Aren't those in Doran's?
By the City Council of San Francisco?
Absolutely.
You know the Pro-Teched slogan, don't you?
I sure do.
Certified, safe, by the city.
By the bay.
Well, what do you say?
Doran, look at that.
I dropped this soap again.
I'll get it.
You bet your life he will.
And with confidence.
Because freeway in Spiket have condoms.
Don't let worry, spoil those chance meetings in public showers.
Always carry Pro-Teched.
Pro-Teched.
PROTC, ECT.
Keep my mind free, SMB.
PROTC, ECT.
Been down with no apology.
I can't do this, I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I can't do this.
Don't doubt.
Know what it's all about.
The Pro-Teched sheep.
So they won't send you a re-protect condoms.
I've division of Black Flag House in Garden, that's from Golden Division.
Keep the situation safe since 1887.
Hollywood.
Hey, Neil, what's happening?
How you doing?
I'm fine.
All right.
I'm okay.
I wish you had a birthday and happy anniversary, even though it is a little bit late.
Well, thanks a lot.
Okay, listen, I got something for you to hear.
It's only about a minute long, can you hear it?
Now, what is it?
Give me a little hint.
It's called the rubber song.
The rubber song?
The rubber song.
Am I going to have to dump it?
No, no, it's clean.
Okay.
All right, hold on.
Sometimes I feel...
Here we go.
Okay, we're ready for it.
Okay, it's 11-hp.
Wow.
I always liked those, especially when they're like real far away in that case, I think maybe a little farther would have been better.
Hello.
Yeah, I got a big report for you, Neil.
Going with North Miami Beach and Ernie Hickey's a douchebag.
All right.
Short and sweet, which we needed.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
It's in, tough to play on, thing.
If I had the ability to do, I'd take you out here right now.
Tick your goddamn teeth in, San Francisco.
Good morning, Neil.
Are you really in the city by the bay?
Yes, I am.
Come on, put you down a little.
Okay.
I woke up listening to Alex for maybe 20 minutes.
Yeah.
His guest was Mary Wilson and his supreme.

Okay, let's go to
Daniel
Okay, I
Turned out Steve Caves here. He sounded like yesterday and the first color guess who it was
No, Gilbert
In and Kelvin. Oh, no
Yes, they're sucking up on thing how great they are how happy they are that he's back now
I want to tell you something if I always told you about watch out for the chronics
There a bunch of phony but suckers and they fly around like butterfly
I create like a bumblebee they flip from one perch to another I hope that I'm
Pollinating everywhere those two of the biggest phonies they were on with Rick and suds in the beginning doing their little
Joint at the hip routine on the phone and sucking around with them and then they came over here and they ruined our Wednesday
Lunches and now they're all of a sudden sucking around over there. Yeah, they were they were basher Rick and suds two things
They called them Steve cane junior or whatever
And I'm believable
Oh, I guess you must have been the one
Don't like Rick and suds you just give them positive things
Well, you know, it's really interesting that he makes those things up because I have never I haven't spoken
To Steve since they came here. I've the only time I've spoken over been right here on the air
I've never said that it's totally untrue and it's another if he said that which all I have is your word
It's another one of his lies just like just like the thing about the Disney telling us we can't put any callers on who mentioned his name
Steve why do you make up so much BS? Let's let's send Steve a big shovel okay?
Ask you and you were to answer honestly on scale of one to ten you being a ten how
Rick and suds are doing and you were to be totally honest you would say no more than a one
Oh, yeah, that's when they got a four seven in the last book
What was Steve's last number here a three five with some very embarrassing demographics?
I know Steve Keyes was thinking he is totally boring and that'll be the last time I ever listen to that now you'll turn it on again
No, I swear I won't know Rick and suds are great. I agree with that okay, okay
But just keep making it up Steve just keep desperately flailing around trying to cause that big controversy because
It just ain't happening. I mean like I said I wish him all a luck in the world and I his his success or lack of it
Is gonna have nothing to do with Rick and suds or this station?
I mean the only thing the stations got to do with it is we've given a more promotion than over there
Which is nothing because they haven't got two nickels to rub together at FTL
But that's about it. So we certainly can't blame us for we've given him a big send-off
But geez you got to make your own thing you got to do your own show
You can't try to siphon off from the rest of the world forever. You have to stay at any your own two feet
Be a man
Like Marlon Brando said and we still want to know what the Helenos about it
United States
has no quarrel
With the Iraqi people
Our quarrel is with Iraq's dictator and with his aggression
Iraq will not be permitted to annex Kuwait
Just the way it's going to be
The way Kuwait and me
The Iraqi people
The Iraqi people
Up to his head
And blow away this key
We want to be unplayed
To fight
And get down play
And I'm gonna die
And I'm gonna die
And I'm gonna die
And I'm gonna die
And I'm gonna die
And I'm gonna die
And I'm gonna die
And I'm gonna die
And I'm gonna die
And I'm gonna die
And I'm gonna die

Continuous Rock and Roll 97 GTR
She's gone, we lost her, the struggling lady is gone
She's been wild all day, we can't get her on a year
Come on honey, just one time
Same old belching and the same old fetching
Come on, give us a break already, hold on for a second
Okay, let's start in Broward, the sun to be great
Hello
Hello
Yes?
Yes
Well, I got a button for Larry
A what?
I got a button for Larry
When your memory goes, you can forget it
Great
Listen, I knew him when he was in a showboat
And front of the big hotel in Miami, beach
But he was just a shlipper
That's when he went in the back part right there
Yeah
Instead of playing the horses, he rode up
Mm-hmm
Boy, I tell you that was a good idea
Wish it was down there to put my lights on yesterday
I'm going to do it that
Oh, now we're going to do it
Yeah, good enough
Have a great life
Wow, 109
At WIOD, what is all that stuff?
Do we have any mail by the way?
Plantation
Hi Neil
Hi
It was my anniversary of the day
So I called Rick and Sud's show
And they said
I was trying to decide between the melting pot
and the armadillo cafe
Yeah
Rick said go to the melting pot
I think it's because he lives in Pearl Springs
Mm-hmm
And Sud says go to Armadillo
And I heard Armadillo on your show
So we decided to go to the Armadillo
And it was outstanding
It's outrageous
Oh, it's great, it's orgasmic
It was a good night
What'd you have?
I had the seafood diablo
And it was outstanding
And we had the black and white soup
And we had my husband had the yellow tail snapper
Oh, it's terrible to go there
Did you have one of those here?
Yeah, and then again
Did you have the dessert?
No, I didn't have any room for dessert
We had that mocha creme brulee
Oh, man
Now I could not force another thing
And we had the nachos beforehand in the soup
And then we had the appetizers
And that was funny
They give you lots of food
That would
But no way, I couldn't eat all that
I want to go back and try salad and dessert
Well, try that
When you try dessert, try that mocha creme brulee
It's got like a real thick crust on it
In fact, next week, Marwan's going to go out and put some of that crust
From the mocha creme brulee and somebody's pants
I believe it
But it's tremendous
But don't tell Rick
I won
Yeah, because I just want him to know that Sud's had the better suggestion
Some other
What are both great?
Yeah, but I lived close
Being in Plantation Armadillo was closer
And I was not disappointed at all
From the outside, you'd never in a million years
You would never know was anything there
It's just like that kind of Yahoo Davy
It's a heckley like I need to go get some muffler parts
Well, I'm sure you're not
Right, right, while you're pulling up your horse up to the hitch and post
That's the right, this I'd heard Randy mention last night
That she didn't get a memo about how much was collected for a cold milk
She actually sat on the air how much you had collected
Great, well good for her
Yeah, she's getting her peas and cheese down
Well, we're working extra hard on it
Because she'll probably be over there pretty soon, so
We're doing our best
Oh, Neil, it'll be fun to have Hank though
Yeah
But I'd like to, did you read the article about Rick and the Herald?
I've just been perusing, yes, I've just been picking little spots
And realized when a nice guy was
Who said that?
The Herald
He talked about it, does that mean he has some personal things in his mind?
Oh no, and that respect the out, but don't let it fool you
But I do agree that he has gotten a little bit
Less of a homer, listening to him on the radio can be
While he's, uh, it's said he's going to loan him his compass
Which direction should he go?
Exactly, where is that ball?
Have a great weekend
Thank
Okay, 114
The classic 1010
10 rocket more classics in a row
On 97 GTR
You don't play the running sisters
Oh man, there's some heavy-duty stuff in there
And here's one that doesn't even have a label on it
It's probably blank
Get ready with your finger on that button
Fort Loddell Florida
Hello
Hello Larry, first time caller
Hi
Listening on WIOD610
I mean, my old station
Yeah, your old station
Two two things I wanted to get your comments on Neil Rogers
Both professionally and personally
What, I gotta tell you this
This is, people will never believe this
This cart hasn't even got a label on it
And I had no idea what it was
It's in the bottom of the thing
There were all this GTR stuff
And there it is
It's almost like an old man
And also
How would you go about getting into talk radio
And I'll hang up and listen
Someone called earlier
I haven't heard Neil in years
I have no idea
I remember the time when he came on the air
And came out of the closet
Yeah
And then I left my army shortly after that
I have not heard him
Since
Uh, he does a kind of shock value
It's not my kind of
I'm told he does a shock value
He showed it, you know
What can I say next to shock you
And that's not my kind of speed
As a worker, but I haven't heard him in
13 years
Nashville, hello
Hahaha
Hahaha
Wow
Boy, thank God we saved that
119 on a very Larry King intensive Friday
It means there must probably
I'm probably winning $50 tonight, right?
At Pompedow
That's what it sounds like
Unlabeled old GTR carts
And finally Michael, I know it's a holiday
And President Bush is vacationing
And Kenny Bunkport main
And join the day off from the White House
But hey
I still want to give him a call
And say happy Fourth of July
After all, it is the nation's birthday
Okay
Well now, Jury's still out
Sure, spray cans
Maybe bad for the ozone
But
Do you go and take away bars, Cam
The VO5
Well
She'll look just like Edgar Winter
Boy, we got some wild stuff
A little channel 7 car there
It's incredible
And speaking of wild stuff
Daniel, are you doing?
You'll never guess who's on the phone now
Boy, this is pretty heavy duty
Pretty heavy duty
I'm not just stop
I'm not just stop
Alright, first of all, you're shouting
Okay, we can hear you
I know you're emotional
And you're trying to flex your muscles
I want to be on the beach
I know how it is
But just relax, take a deep breath
We've got lots of time
Okay, okay
Let's just aimalyze the entire situation now
I'd fight it exactly
If you guys are as disloyal and uh
Well, I just want to say one thing to start
I didn't call Ian calls
Buy himself alone
You're not there, didn't know about that
We didn't know about that
Buy himself alone
What?
Wait a minute, hold on a second
What line is out?
Quick
She's gone
Oh, she's gone
That was the old bag, she hung up
Hello
Yeah, go ahead, I'm sorry
Yeah, well like I said
I did not call him, I never called Ian calls
Yeah
That's not bad, I mean
I'm just gonna call him
Yeah, but weren't you on with me
With Ian a couple of weeks ago
With news broke that Mr.
A pain was coming back on the air
Yeah, but I wasn't as deep before
And you were saying
Oh boy, we are so ecstatic
And boy, this is gonna be great
Those guys are okay, but we're all okay
And weren't you the same guys that came on with them
In the beginning when they first came on in the afternoon
And sucking around and calling together
And I mean, I don't understand
What kind of loyalties you guys have got
Well, I want to help you see you
Nice, oh, geez
You know, this is incredible
This is even such a standard with his mouth down
It was to the thing down there
And the other of you can't believe you
How can you call guys on the air
And go on about how great they are
And become a little superstar
You're like a radio butterfly
You're like a butterfly
Aren't you embarrassed
I don't know, I have nothing to say
No, no, that's not an answer
Well, no
Calvin, but you're up a little bit
I know it won't be easy
But what is it?
Why, isn't it if he came before Rick and Sub came on
Yeah, and then
Well, that is never gonna stop
But I always been listening to you
No, no, don't say
Oh, you sound like Steve
You're sucking around me
And that's not gonna work
That doesn't play with me
But we're not discussing me
We know this show is great, okay
Okay
The bottom line is two to six in the afternoon
You've got your choice
You can let's have some fun with Rick and Sub
I'm gonna talk on some
Or you can listen to a man
Making a living on the air
Self-promoting with 85 minute breaks and traffic
And the trying to figure out how to get out of that little room
And if you want that's fine
But I don't understand why
One day these guys are great
And you're having a great time
And the next day you're like
Sucking around
Is that what you want to be known for all your life
Is sucking around
I don't look fine
Come on
All right, okay
Stand up for yourself
Don't be such a wimp
Just because he has got you
You know
In a submissive kind of an attitude
Well, I do, I do like Steve Kane
I mean, that's a thing now
What do you like about him?
Uh, he's a fundamentalist
Fun?
Yeah
How about that show Tuesday
The four-hour funeral for Mayor Cahoney
On air, did you listen to that show?
No, I didn't listen to that one
Why not?
Because of Tuesday
Tuesday don't listen to that anymore
Oh, would you have listened to it?
Uh, oh, we not, really
Oh, why not
Cause that probably wouldn't have been boring
Oh
And what's going on?
I'm not saying he's great
And like he's not saying he's the end of the world
I'm trying to have a conversation with you
I'm not trying to sell one way or the other
Cause to reach its own
If whatever makes you happy
Yeah
What about when Ellis Rubin is going to be on
Would, uh, is that going to be fun?
Oh, it's going, Mr. Newell, see
What about when Rick Ciderman is
And what you've heard all those
Guest of a million times
If you're a Steve Kane listener
Haven't you?
Yeah, but I don't know
Remember what to have to say
Oh, the next three laps
Surely what I'm saying
Absence makes the parts grow fonder
Yeah, you might be right
But they
Doesn't have a lot of commercials
I will say that
Yeah, it's bad
Great
All the time
Well, why don't you, when we just take
Have a telephone
A collection and take up the money
And, uh, you know, maybe you can do a show
Yeah, I'm a kid
But I'm a kid
You're Waffling Kelvin
I know
Well, I'm frustrated
You should be flustered
Rick Rallye is wounded
He's heard he's a sensitive emotional basket case already
And you guys are like, uh, butterflies
One day they're great, now Steve's great
And if like, uh, some real famous person
Like John McHugh comes on the afternoon on QA
And he'll be calling him and say, you're great
Why don't you
Why don't you
No, definitely not
I think the least you can do like Monday is a holiday
Is come over here and take your clothes off in a studio
The least you can do to make up for it
Ah, how about Tuesday
Okay
Okay, Tuesday
See you
All right, bye
Let's try Fort Lauderdale
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
Okay
I heard a room where I want to know if it's true
Yeah, I heard you were a Faggot, is that true?
A what?
A Faggot?
Pansy
Oh, Ian is on the phone
How you doing, Neil?
Oh, boy
You guys are just out of control
You need to get like a life transplant, you too
I was listening in the car
I want to tell you, Rick Riley and Sutscomb
I'd like to come to your house and beat the crap out of you with a 2x4
Calvin needs to push up a little bit
Yeah, well that was a wimpy call
I mean, what at least admit that you guys are butterflies
And you're insincere
And you're like, uh, suck around everybody
Uh, that's not true
Mostly each other
Markets up 30 points
I would never fly away from you, Neil
See, you're doing the same thing
He was doing, I'm not impressed by that
That's the oldest chronic talk radio uh,
Tactic in the world, to suck around with the host
It, I see through that, see
You're not talking to Alex Bennett now
No, but it's just you
I never spoke to Alex Bennett
Yeah, right, but if you would have, oh, Alex, you're the greatest
Can we come down to be in your live studio audience?
So can we come down and suck around
Eat your food and ruin your show?
Of course, he didn't need any help
No, but okay, well, you won't believe it, but
I don't believe you already
Because when you preface the statement by saying you won't believe me
It's pretty obvious that you're full of it
Well, because you don't believe me so
I preface it
Well, what's uh, what's the philonia statement
I know it's just to say that, you know
I mean, I'll be listening to you and Steve Kane
Originally, that's how we knew Steve Kane before
What does that have to do with Rick and Putt?
No, it's really nothing to do with it
I mean, I don't have nothing against him
I don't really care about him either
But the point is
See, you both are missing the point
If you were just like
Kind of like casual callers
And you were part of the vast audience
Out there, the passing parade
That would be one thing
But I have a good memory, okay?
And I remember back in the beginning
When these guys first came on his station
The two of you always entanned him
Like joined at the thing
We're always on the phone
Just heaving
You're relating all over them
And just carrying on
And oh, I mean, you were just
It was just phenomenal
It was mind-boggling
And then all of a sudden
The first day Mr. Contrivedigo comes back on you
Oh boy, they're okay
But boy, he's really
And then I ask your pal
What's so great?
What do you enjoy?
Did you hear this?
Oh no, well, I can't listen on that day
And oh no, if I heard this, it would probably be boring
Say, on your doing is you're just
I don't know what you're doing
What are you doing?
I don't know
What do you want to be?
Trouble makers, is that?
No, I don't want to be trouble makers
A trouble maker
Trying to get Rick Riley's blood pressure up
And cause him to have some kind of a cardiovascular accident, sir
At least he's got a nice car, though
Play some good music today, Johnny
What is it?
At least he's got a nice car to go home in, though
Rick
I'm not kicking you out of here
But it's time to go on to your, Johnny Dork
There he goes over to the coast
Right
He took a big, a big thing of helium before it went over there
Okay
It's 82 along the coast
I can hear it right now
He's going to be great today
I don't know
He's last day
I want to tell you
No, no, don't try to change the subject
We still have about a minute to go here
I want you to try to explain to these poor guys
Why you are a turncoat
I mean, no reason
You're like the Angus Allen of radio
Or was it Ethan Allen
Or Ethan, whatever his name was
No, I'm not like, I mean, anything like a Gilbert
I'm not even close
I listen to you
Your turncoat
I listen to you
Rick and Suz
And Steve Cato
Or Steve Cato
I've ever listened on AM radio
Yeah, well, you're still not responding to our question
Well, I mean
I mean, why did I turn on him?
Is that what the question was?
Yeah
No reason, really
I still was listening to them
So Steve Cane came back
Yeah
Well, that's really it
Did you like the Myra Khan issue?
No, that was that day I didn't listen
Are you going to listen when Ellis Rubin is on?
Actually, I think Ellis Rubin is kind of in it
I don't even know who that is
Oh
I mean, I know you
How about Reverend, Reverend Unic Polis
I actually like I told him yesterday
And you run lady into that?
That's kind of
Because I know the British are into that tea in the afternoon
Well, I don't know
Yeah, I think you guys are kind of like
Spend a real club
Maybe go up to a New Hampshire or something for the weekend together
We wait one day
Kind of cozy up in front of a warm fire
And discuss this under less pressure
When you're away from all the
Immediate pressures of this radio market
And kind of gets your thing together
You know, like in January, I might be going out to University of Maryland
Oh promise
I'm going to be depressed
How about I can listen to you every day
Well, you can pick up FTL up there, I'm sure
Have a great weekend, Ian
You too
You're full of it
Okay
Wow, boy, a couple of radio phonies there
They're not full in any of you folks
You're a lot too sharp for that, right?
