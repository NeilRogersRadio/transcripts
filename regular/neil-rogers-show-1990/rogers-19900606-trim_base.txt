New stock Radio 610 WIOD presents Neil Rogers to get a touch and talk call 751 WIOD in
day.
524 WIOD enbrower or 655 and 278 WIOD in the Palm Beach.
Other areas may call collect.
The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the
station.
Now here's Neil Rogers on New stock Radio 610 WIOD.
1007 WIOD is a great day for the Irish A.
Unfortunately they're all on vacation and we got Bill Cosford coming up at noon today
today.
It's my only guest.
They can steal my cards.
You can steal my material but lay off my goddamn blues way to choose.
Okay guys, put the crap.
Man, do you believe that?
Also, I noticed the same thing they did but they were sharpened up to a mentioned on
the air about Greg V. Down the article that Tom Jicca wrote in the slum sentinel on Saturday
and it's in turn to page 7D or whatever it was to continue and it was nothing there.
It was gone.
History.
And so this morning because the sun sent those great American newspaper, they finished
it all off and quite frankly they had the better idea the first time.
There's not much there.
I want to congratulate Dave Caprita on getting a job being in town.
He's probably listening right now unless he's one of those programming meetings.
However, I listened a little bit this morning and I'm not making this up.
I was heart pressed to punch out the coast because they kept pulling a lot of records
that I liked but I did punch over there and I heard Caprita with noodles.
Dave, I'm happy for you and good luck.
You know what I mean?
Like Laxala and the music they're playing on Gloves 94 that esoteric obscure jazz
that nobody ever heard before gets serious.
I mean that stuff is went out with low button shoes.
I mean, forget it.
But anyway, good luck Dave.
I'm glad you're doing the thing and we got the ball game tonight.
We got concerted noon.
Lots of heavy duty stuff.
We also have any minute now, any day at the arrival of the program director for a
coast, Fleetwood Groover.
Now, there are people in the audience holding their sides and thinking that I'm making that up.
Oh wow, me.
But I got news for it.
That's his name.
Now, you know that nobody made that up, right?
Fleetwood Groover who's coming to us from WBT in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Hey.
Oh, I bet you he is some heavy duty stuff.
So he'll be in for a real shock when it gets to this place.
OK, 1009 at WIOD.
We got a bunch of calls on the board already, which is really great.
Neat Keen swell.
And we don't care.
FPL will be changing next Monday, by the way.
The big band sounds will be coming back.
Uh-huh.
They'll be great.
Granny, get your teeth out of the glass.
So we can chew it over.
Big bands are coming back to FPL.
What a joke.
What a travesty.
And isn't it interesting?
I guess it's just the coincidence that King Paul with the big schnauz, the guy who owns
that station went out of town Friday before the massacre takes place this week and left
other underlings to tell everybody how to use our rivet d'arch your asses can.
Isn't that nice?
King Paul, you make me sick.
You make me want a bar.
His nose is big as Patsy Montana, you know?
What else?
That about it.
Don't forget tonight.
We have big things doing.
Collect from Cleveland.
Hello.
Are you serious?
Oh, semi-serious.
Actually, I'm in Columbus right now.
You're in Columbus?
Is this Christopher?
Christopher.
Uh.
The Italian, the Jewish sailor?
Is that one?
Christopher Columbus?
How are you, Neil?
Okay, you're in Columbus?
Yeah.
Sionto Downs.
I was in Cleveland.
Ohio State University.
Kent State University.
The United States Trotting Association.
Have you ever been in this room?
No.
Have you heard of it?
Yes, sir.
Beautiful track up.
So what do you want?
I don't know.
You just talk to somebody from home.
Boys, Johnny Dirk over there next door,
they got that music at the coast crowd.
I mean, I like the music, but not while I'm on the air.
They got to cranked up again, loud.
That's it.
Cut it down.
See, he's listening, so he cut the crap.
Don't ever go to Cleveland.
I've been there.
Have you what you think of it?
Cleveland is like a cesspool.
It's dirty and schmutzy.
I turned on this.
I turned on the channel for the news from my hotel room.
Yeah.
It's just bright space, I suppose.
Dan Coglin.
We couldn't get rid of him in Miami, channel three.
Well, what the hell are you doing there?
Oh.
Because this call is just, I had a lot of calls on the board
when before I punched this up.
Hey.
So you were beloved copies in Pittsburgh last night?
We don't discuss baseball on the show anymore.
With 40 degrees outside.
Uh-huh.
I had a call at home in the middle of the game.
Norm Kent, a maniac, was calling me from three-rovers stadium
in the stadium on a payphone.
Yeah, but that's where I was.
I was, I was president, right?
To where I was.
Yeah.
I wish you would have run into him with the tractor.
It was only a dozen people, it was so out there.
He says, what's wrong with the cubs?
What's wrong with that?
I said, get off my phone, you jerk.
That is a fish to the game.
Yeah.
Have a nice life.
Take a bite, sir.
I can't take a bite.
Needless to say, this is correct.
Have a nice life.
Bye.
Uh-huh.
W-I-O-D.
Hello.
OK, panic, panic city.
W-I-O-D.
OK, two panics in a row.
We got a little trifecta going there.
I-O-D.
What do you want?
What is it?
Oh.
Yeah, phony voice, crank.
Hold on.
We'll get to you.
W-I-O-D.
Hold on.
W-I-O-D.
Hello.
Speak up.
Or forever hold it.
OK, W-I-O-D.
OK, we got some business to do then.
I'll talk about the game tonight.
We'll take a few calls.
We got Cosper at noon.
W-I-O-D.
Really?
Hold on, sweetie.
OK, let's tell you about Low Jack right now.
If your car is important to you, like mine is to me,
then you better do something to protect it.
OK, because the auto thieves are out there.
We have an epidemic of auto theft in South Florida.
As they say over in the Gables, word number one.
OK, that's right.
An auto theft in the country.
And that's why you have to protect that big investment in your car,
your truck, your van, whatever the hell it is.
Low Jack really works.
It's proven protection.
That low-jack transmitter that they installed in your car,
they can do the installation by the way,
while you're working in your office,
or home wherever you want.
They'll come right to you and do a good professional quick installation.
And if your car is stolen, you go out there,
and you say, holy cow, what the hell am I going to do?
You pick up the phone, call police.
And out of their computer, all they do is punch in a couple of numbers
that activate that low-jack transmitter and sends out a homing signal
that they zoom in on in just a matter of minutes.
And generally in 30 minutes to 90 minutes or less,
they have that car back in one piece
while it's still worth getting back before they strip it down.
And it's gone forever.
And you have like a nightmare on your hand.
So if nothing else, at least pick up the phone,
call this toll free number, get all the information.
And I think you want to make an intelligent decision
by getting low-jack protection.
The price is right too.
Call toll free, 1-800-53-Low-Jack,
and ask for Elaine.
That's 1-800-535-6522.
Ask for a lane.
Get all the straight dope on low-jack.
But on MTV, there will be 20 seconds of dead air.
I know you're not going.
You wouldn't leave us, especially before the trip to Chicago.
W-I-O-D.
Marvin?
Yeah?
Let's speak with Marvin, please.
Speaking.
What do you want?
What do you want?
I want to talk with Marvin.
This is Melvin, Hovann.
The solar-flex spot is on it.
Also, I do want to warn you that the picture,
some of the cable here is erratic.
And of course, I know that's unusual for cable,
because usually it's crystal clear.
And the picture is unpredictable.
Now this morning, it's clear as a bell, the picture.
And if the boogie board spot that was on yesterday,
if that should come on MTV during the show at any time,
you will hear a long pause, OK?
Like the guys Golden Retriever with a long pause.
Speaking of a place to have a great time, watch a little TV,
maybe watch a ballgame, sit back, meet your friends,
and just have a great afternoon, or midday, or evening.
Whatever the hell you want to go over, fat Tuesdays.
Rick and slut were there a couple of weeks ago,
and I was there to join in and kind of rub elbows
with some of the people so to speak.
You know what I mean, Pat?
And we had a great time down there.
And you will too.
It's the place in that neck of the woods.
In fact, it's about the only place in that neck of the woods.
It's in the Miracle Center at 3301 Coral Way.
They're open every morning at 1130.
They have a great happy hour every afternoon between 4 and 8.
Every Wednesday night, including tomorrow night,
is college night at Fat Tuesdays with tutors, shooters,
yellow shots.
And of course, that largest election in the world
are frozen specialty drinks.
Whichever one fits your personality, like the headbutt,
or the white Russian, or the strawberry collater,
the purple passion, or the tropical itch, or the 57 Chevy,
or for our senior citizens, the triple bypass.
There's something for everybody.
And a great time waiting for you every day,
seven days a week.
Never cover charge either.
At Fat Tuesdays, you tell a meal and Rick and Sluts
sent you by their in the Miracle Center,
3301 Coral Way in Miami.
The Sixth in W.
The Sixth in W.
Summer 1990 is the summer of Dick Tracy.
You'll see the movie.
Listen to the soundtrack,
where the T-shirt, and read the comic book.
And now, just in time for Father's Day,
you can enjoy the fragrance that was inspired by the movie,
the soundtrack, the T-shirt, and the comic book.
New Dick Tracy Cologne.
Why smell like other guys?
Now you can smell like Dick.
What the hell are you talking about?
1026 at W.
I.O.D. Now, let me do the thing about the game,
or we're never going to get this in, okay?
Because we've only got an hour and a half,
and then Bill Cosford, the movie cryptic of the hero of...
No, don't panic, because we're not just going to talk about movies.
We'll find out what Cosford hated the bird,
and why he's so evasive and elusive,
and why he pretends to live here when he lives in Jersey.
It'll be pretty interesting.
Tonight is W.I.O.D., Neil Rogers,
Wayne's plus knight at Pompa No Municipal Stadium,
the game between the miracle and a West Palm Beach expose.
Game is at 705,
and the pregame autograph signing at 630,
and it's easy to get there.
It's north of Atlantic Boulevard west of Federal Highway.
But I guess...
It's like off Federal Highway, right?
You can see it from Federal Highway.
Yeah, you get there, no problem.
Gilbert's going to sing a God Bless America
before the game and take me out to the ball game
during the seventh inning stretch,
and the first 750 fans who show...
Don't forget, if you want to come to the game tonight,
bring about your people, just mention my name at the gate,
and you'll all get in free, okay?
Because we do have a lot of free loaders out there,
and just mentioning the word free, of course,
immediately we'll add another couple thousand people.
The first 750 you show up will get a miracle pen and free,
and a coupon good for a free,
there's that word again dinner.
When you buy one dinner at either wings plus location,
87 West Prospect and Fort Lauderdale,
98 East Samperot and Oral Springs,
Tom Deneburg will be there,
and you can beat up up on him too, okay?
We might even sing Tom Song for him at the ball game.
So be sure and come out tonight.
We'd like to have a good crowd,
make it look respectable, okay?
1027, we do have a line that just vacated in Dade County,
pretty depressing, 751, WIOD.
Now, what I was going to ask before,
is everybody out of school now?
No?
Just Broward and all the college punks, right?
Okay. A lady in Pompano.
Hello there.
Yes, ma'am.
I want you to know that I'm a Pompano Park supporter,
and I've heard Alan Sinkelson is going to be
at the baseball game as Miracles,
Stadium this evening, maybe?
Well, it will be a miracle if he shows up, you're right.
Well, he claims he's the real baseball supporter in the area.
Yeah, well, look at...
He's the Yankee fans, what does that tell you?
Well, he's a miracle fan now.
Is he really?
Yep.
Well, that's great.
Thanks.
Okay.
Thanks, what?
Did that make any sense to you?
I must have been one of Alan's friends.
WIOD.
Yeah, Marvin, please.
Marvin?
Yes, sir.
What do you want?
I want to speak to Marvin.
About what?
I'm going to Buffalo.
Yeah.
But Joey.
Let me tell you something.
What's that?
The bus leaves in an hour.
Right out here in front of the 79th Street Causeway,
and Sally's going to come along, too.
It ought to be a really exciting ride.
Sally Ride?
Wasn't she the astronaut?
Huh?
Yeah, how do you like that?
Now, she wasn't the one that got killed though, right?
That was the school teacher, as Reagan said.
WIOD.
Yeah, hi.
I just heard they announced the game for tonight.
I think you better check the schedule.
I think it's at 605.
What?
The game.
It's double header.
Okay.
Because the game last night.
The game was right out last night.
Well, I got news for you.
Okay.
We better get that straightened out.
Because I'm not going to be doing, you know,
I don't want to sound like Mr. Primadana,
but I don't think I'm going to be up there doing PA
for a double header or the Gilbert can sing twice, you know?
You may have to call Harry in for that.
Yeah, they were rained out last night.
Yeah, they were rained out, right?
Yeah, so before you show up at 630, you know, I check it.
Well, maybe we could get Mr. Deneberg to find out
because as usual, anytime we go out and do something
of this radio station, it turns out to be a disaster, as you know.
Because nobody lets us know what the hell is going on.
So we'll find out.
Well, I get that.
Hopefully, hopefully we'll see you there.
Thank you.
Hey, yeah.
Okay.
Did you hear that, Melvin?
We don't know what the hell is going on.
Okay, get a hold of that little pimple head.
Okay, that little zit, that walking zit in the sales department
and give his head a squeeze and see what happens.
Excuse me.
W-I-O-D.
Who's this?
Melvin.
Oh, Neil.
Yeah.
The miracle game tonight is actually going to start
at the regular time seven o'clock.
They call me Sustidobus.
Who's this?
Who's who?
You.
Oh, this is the ledger sports reporter.
The what?
The ledger sports reporter.
The ledger's what?
The wrong information on when you were going to be there last week.
The Jewish ledger?
The Jewish ledger.
The pompano Jewish sports ledger.
Great.
We got a story about Sandy Kofax's where Ann Al Rosen.
What was his name?
Joel Herschorn?
No, not Herschorn.
He's a lawyer.
Joel Herschorn.
No, for the white socks.
Joel.
Oh, gee.
The Jewish pitcher.
Come on.
Come on.
Anybody from the world with no words?
Joel Herschorn.
Joel Herschorn.
That's true.
Cubs don't have any Jews on their team.
For any of you.
The pepper, Ryan Sandberg.
Sand, Sandberg.
It's just a little joke.
Now what is it?
The game is a regular time?
The regular time.
Seven o'clock.
Normally they are at six if it's a double header,
but due to the fact that you're going to be there,
I guess the miracle kept things on schedule.
You're sure of this?
Call them this morning.
You're positive.
But it will be a double header.
That's true.
Starting at seven?
Starting at seven.
Of course it's a double header.
The Zemmy 1 game is a seven in the game?
Both games are seven in the game.
Oh, thank God.
I don't know.
Okay, thank you, sir.
By the way, Ellen Finkelson, the great baseball player.
The great BS artist, yes?
Has never been to a miracle game.
No, I'm sure of it.
I'm looking forward to seeing you tonight.
I'm also never still afraid to train.
Absolutely.
Okay, thank you.
Adios.
Shalom.
1031 at WIOD.
Well, we have some conflicting information there.
I'm sure one of them is right.
WIOD.
Hi, I'm Ivan.
Yeah.
I'm on the scan tonight to get tickets.
What do we have to sign up for?
No, just mention Eels' name at the door and I'll let you in for free.
Okay, thank you very much.
Okay, no problem.
Why do I keep answering that line?
Nobody else will get on.
Like this guy is still holding.
Are you there?
Do you think he's still there?
I better put him back on hold.
He's been out a long time.
He's busy in the office.
WIOD.
Marvin.
Yeah.
Is my package ready?
Yeah.
It's in the bag.
Two, okay.
Okay.
Bye.
See ya.
28-11 at WIOD.
So we'll get that straightened out.
That'll be another little hook to keep you tuned in for at least another five-teminence
until we absolutely for sure.
This guy from the Jewish ledger, he sounded like he knew what he was talking about.
WIOD.
Yeah, can you guys give me directions to Arnold's Royal Castle?
Yes, sir.
Where are you now?
I'm on 95 headaches now.
What planet are you on?
Zero, are you on the Earth or Uranus?
I'm on.
This must be in the already guy.
Yeah.
You're on I-95 whereabouts?
I'm just south of Dakota.
Dakota?
Yeah.
Dakota?
Yeah, I'm up in Florida, but I'm heading towards Miami.
South Dakota?
Yeah.
No, come on, where are you?
No, Dakota.
I mean, you know, the design center for the Americas around the Florida airport.
Around the Fort Lauderdale Airport on I-95?
Yeah, south of there.
You're also by Griffin Road, you mean?
Yeah, we're on Griffin Road.
Why did you say that instead of Dakota, it sounded like you're in the state.
Okay, well.
Okay, so you say, you keep cal- oh, you got a way to go.
Okay.
You come down not that far.
You come down past the Golden Glades, right?
You know where that is?
Yeah.
Can you handle that?
Yeah.
And then you come down to 125th Street.
That's 125th.
Right.
Okay, I want to spell that out for you.
Okay.
You get off there, you go west.
One block.
Just one short, like half a block.
Half a block.
And right on the corner of 441 and 125th Street, there will be Arnold's Road Castle.
There will be all kinds of signs about nearly this and nearly that.
And Neil here and et cetera.
Okay.
Leave a lot of money and have a great lunch.
All right, we appreciate it, Neil.
And give away in a big kiss for us.
All right, hey, do you want me to have some jill or something?
Uh, Cospor's going to be here at noon.
No, I don't know, because he's kind of a picky.
Yeah, I haven't sent a bunch of stuff over.
I'm not going to eat any else.
Yeah, I know you're not eating anything out.
I'm going to bring some diet soda, but I have lunch at Mommy's today,
because it's Tuesday, but yeah, Cospor, I'm sure I'll pick out a little bit.
Okay, well, let's go and shoot a win-luck to away.
I want to call my friend Dennis and four-large nail to his bag.
Okay, sir.
Thanks a lot, Neil.
Enjoy it.
Bye-bye.
Okay, boy, we're really instructional today.
Guns and roses.
Oh, look at that sweet child of mine.
Are they grotesque or what, huh?
Great record, but they just, hmm.
They look like schmutzon wheels.
I tell you, I shouldn't have said that because all those punk kids are out of school.
Dade schools are out on the 20th.
Broward is out on the 14th.
I don't think so.
Today is what?
The fifth?
Well, how come these kids in Broward are like calling in?
You called?
Well, don't start sucking around just because you're leaving.
Okay, we have an open line in Broward.
524, Melvin.
524, WIOD.
Want to tell you about Toyota of Hollywood.
If you are in the market, if you're thinking about trading for a new car, please check out those
beautiful, those well-made, those incredible looking 1990 Toyota's.
And the 91 Prevy of Van, the biggest, the most luxurious van that Toyota's ever built.
And the 91 MR2 and MR2 Turbo, the one that drives like a Ferrari at a 5th of the
cost.
And it is, I know that sounds crazy, okay?
Because the MR2, like a little sports car.
But when you drive it, you are going to be shocked at the new 91 MR2 Turbo.
It is fast.
It is luxurious.
It is incredible.
And as Rod Roddy would say, the price is right, okay?
So go over and check them all out at Toyota of Hollywood.
They'll treat you with velvet gloves, man.
They'll give you a great personal service.
No pressure.
No games.
No gimmicks.
Just great prices, great value, and the best in award-winning service.
Always waiting for you at Toyota of Hollywood.
That's what's made them number one.
You'll find them on 441 right between Taft and Sheridan Streets in Hollywood.
You tell Patrick Murray, my good friends over there, that Uncle Neil sent you by for a
hell of a deal at Toyota of Hollywood.
I am just wasted in cloud.
I am just space out and down.
I'll hold on to street.
Please bring me around.
I'm wasted in cloud.
It's hard to believe.
Got a thing in my mind.
I do what you want.
My face is just blank.
All of the time.
I am just wasted in cloud.
I am just space out and down.
You could call me an emotional guy.
I am just space out and down.
Okay, so we got to worry.
This is a double-headed man, but it just started 7 o'clock.
What the question is, in a 7-in-a-game, when is the 7th inning stretch?
That's important because Gilbert is going to have to know what is saying.
Take me out to the ball game.
We have to get a lot of these things straightened out.
I have another Donald Trump one.
I know we played that one at the beginning called Donald Tycoon to the tune of Rocky Raccoon.
I am tempted to play it right now, but I won't.
Are you still there?
Yeah, wow.
I know.
I stuck with it through about four different chances.
They were assuming that you were busy.
That's incredible.
Not too many people would do that.
Well, the last few drinks with Fleetwood Groover, we were camping out about two weeks ago.
Groovy.
We were talking about a white sail that was coming up.
And besides that, how are you talking about?
We were looking for some clippers to put those little nails of the gerbils.
Cute.
Is this what I've had you hold all this time waiting for?
Yeah, because we're in the same team.
Don't attack the new program director in Coast 97 until he at least gets here.
You ask him, he's into gerbils.
Okay.
1040 at WIOD, we have an opening in day one in Broward now.
751 WIOD in day five to four WIOD in Broward.
Oh, excuse me.
Hello.
Hello.
WIOD.
Hi.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What do you want?
I just want to talk to the WIOD.
WIOD, what do you want?
Hold on.
WIOD.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Mobile.
Dale, yes, mobile.
I can hear that ringing sound.
Yes, the Miracle Game tonight starts at nine.
And at the double header, I just got to do this.
What?
AM or PM?
The 9 PM, 9 PM and each one is going to be 11 innings.
Okay.
So it'll be a little bit of a draw.
Oh, yeah, the couple don't cry that if we played enough innings, you might score a couple of runs.
There you go.
Maybe they're waiting for enough people to show up to start.
Yeah.
I think they're having a waiting for a quorum before they start the game.
Right.
So that's why they're waiting for nine if they don't get it.
We're going to have a lot of people there, sir, even though you won't be there.
Let me ask you something.
Yes.
You notice when I said, even though you would be there, you didn't say, oh, yes, I will.
See, I know your time.
You're right.
Absolutely.
It looks like a 20-pooper.
Rick and Puts.
Is the English translation of that Rick and Dick?
By the way, you know, he said something the other day.
What are you getting all panicky about?
He said his name was Richard.
I was driving home and he said his real name, Rick O'Reilly, is Richard.
And I was thinking, of course, a lot of people whose name is Richard.
They're called Dick.
Now, if we called him by his name and he still had Puts with him as a sidekick,
that would be, I think, maybe a little bit too much, even for this audience.
Well, I don't know.
I think they could handle it.
Have a nice day.
Have a nice day.
1042, am I right?
Just their name?
Hey, listen, we can't change people's names to suit a bunch of old parts up in Washington.
Our paranoid and hostile and psychotic, right?
You're damn straight.
Well, we have an opening in a date county 751 WIOD.
We're having a great time until Bill Cosford gets here at noon.
Hopefully, when I will have a little food from Wayne to pacify him.
Cosford's always better when you show something in his mouth.
Poor Lauderdale.
Hi.
Yeah.
I'll be attending the game tonight.
Outstanding.
Starts at midnight.
No, it's like, I believe it's around 7 o'clock.
7 p.m.
Don't accept any wooden nickels.
Don't listen to any of these O'Jahm provocateurs.
These are all promoters for the dogs or something.
Don't pay any attention.
The game starts at 7 o'clock and we're going to have a gigantic crowd.
I want everyone to bring banner that say,
Hire a super Dave and Mystery.
Okay.
We have an opening in there.
So help me, God, if he shows up, see I didn't know who that was.
Did you hear who that was?
You aren't paying any attention.
That was that slime ball, super Dave, okay?
And I'm going to tell you something right now.
If he shows up, his ass is getting tossed right out.
Trust me.
And will I fat-rich there to make sure of it?
1043 WIOD.
Oh, Neil, please.
I mean, is that chronic when you just can't get rid of somebody that's a pan in the ass?
They just won't go away, sir.
Is that chronic or what?
That's it.
That's it.
That's the epitome of being chronic.
It thrust my ass a little bit.
Exactly.
Neil, please.
What's going on, Harry?
I'm here.
I'm doing it.
Gilbert.
Gilbert sings.
Yes.
Come on, Neil.
Come on, what?
Gilbert two steps.
Oh, geez.
Are we going to do a request again?
We only got a limited amount of time here, sir.
We've only got a short amount of time.
We got a very important guest coming at noon alleged.
I'm just, I'm killing a little time to find it, okay?
Oh, okay.
Can I just sit here and understand?
No, because I found it.
I just found it.
Have a nice forever, you're even.
Now, put you on hold for what?
Gilbert.
Did anybody ever tell you you were a little bit pushy?
No.
Well, guess what?
What?
You are.
The singing sensation of the 90s radio legend and talk show groupie, Gilbert, sings for you.
Wow, wow.
Get out, I get out.
Bloody woman, walking down the street, bloody woman, the kind I like to meet.
It's Gilbert's magic from A to Z.
Wild thing.
You make my heart sing.
You make everything gloomy, wild thing.
You get every record ever recorded from the animals to the zombies.
Who could forget this timeless classic?
These foods are made for walking, and that's just what they'll do.
One of these tasty foods are gonna walk all over you.
And the song that said America's romantic heart on fire.
Strangers and the night, exchanging glances, strangers and the night.
They're all sung just for you by Gilbert.
Every song ever written, every song ever recorded.
Interpreted just for you by the golden throat himself, Gilbert.
Love me, tender love me, too.
Planned out man, love, saying woman.

Remember, if you want it right, it's got to be Gilco.
You said it. Don't say it again.
10-46 and W.I.D.
It's this little preview of what to be hearing at the ballgame tonight.
Probably have a little stirring pre-game speech by Alan J.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm Alton from Alton Road.
Who?
Mike Spindell.
Oh, please.
Mike Spindell.
Nick Siet.
Does he still have that trivia show?
One of the stations down here.
Mike Spindell.
Well, he was on weekends on FTL, but I don't know what's going to happen.
It'll probably be out with the laundry over there.
If anybody trying to pick an FTL and day counting together,
because they're sting those like...
They're stingable.
You could do better by wrapping your finger in your pop-up toaster
and standing outside and screaming loud like Lee Fowler
could have a bigger audience in the studio.
There are industries disaster.
They're almost as big of a joke as QAM, but not quite.
Maybe when you're on vacation, cranking film for you instead of...
Possibly.
Possibly.
I do want to mention G Michael McCay will be filling in the first day I'm going on a Friday.
And then Stan will be here for part of the time.
And then some others.
I do want to also mention that Joey will not be among those filling in officially.
Trust me.
Neil, doesn't...
Go to the bank on it.
Doesn't a guy from 10 or 2 in Saris have no job in town?
I mean, one day working in Rays Station during a week is not going to make a living for him.
I mean, that's ridiculous.
Why don't you go back to Buffalo?
I mean, I...
He tries to be anonymous driving that truck, you know, that big purple truck.
He was horrible on she, Neil when he's on she...
We have to discuss that creature, sir.
We have to discuss the...
No, just mention...
Have a little respect for the dead.
No, I just want to know.
I just want to thank you.
I got a card from you, the other thing, the mill.
With a picture you're saying now is, no more fans.
This now, I just want to thank you for the card.
Where'd you get that from?
In the mail from Rays Station.
Yeah, sure.
I'm serious, I'll show you.
You're dreaming.
No, I'll read it to you right now.
Okay.
You don't want to really hear it, do you?
Why is it something personal?
No, no.
It's just...
Unless one of my friends played a joke, but I don't think so.
What does it say?
It says from, you know, WRT Rays, you're Steve to my number one fan.
Thanks for listening to my show every day.
No, I would never write that.
Well, where do I get it from?
Who's picture is it, Alex Ben?
Your picture.
My picture?
So we'll picture yourself without the bird.
And what languages are written in Hebrew?
No, not Hebrew.
WRT 610, trunk radio.
Oh, that's not us.
No?
Have a nice day, pal.
All right, thanks.
We're going to help you get that.
Are you sending pictures out in the programming office without my knowledge and forging my signature?
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.
These people in there look out for that man.
I'll tell you, don't ever drop the soap when they're around.
We have an open line in Dade County, 751 coast and one in Broward, 524.
They're both ringing.
Look at that.
WIOD.
Guns and roses, rural aros and it sucks.
Okay, pal.
Just looks straight down.
WIOD.
All right.
Hold on.
Okay.
What was that?
Are you there?
Yeah.
Well, hold on a second.
Don't get panicky and surly with me, sir.
WIOD.
Yeah, let the call Chris at the beach back.
Well, hold on.
It will give you the opportunity.
Sir, after we do a very important commercial break here on 610, WIOD,
you can see where your signature can never be your own.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's pretty nice to see Chuck Meyer in here again talking baseball and at 10.51 at WIOD.
You see any time the pirates win, man.
He's in here like a flash after they lose about 3.4 and a row.
All of a sudden you couldn't find him with a magnifying glass.
But that's all right.
When Steve Blas starts tonight, you'll be sorry.
Anyway, we're going to take a call from Hollywood, I guess, hey?
Yeah, near how you done.
Okay.
Let's make a summary to ask you about 5, 6 weeks ago you were talking about the who.
You said they had some song.
There was about two aside.
You never talked more about it.
You have any idea what I'm talking about?
Yeah.
Well, I want to know what song you were talking about.
What song I was talking about?
It's a...
Oh, I don't remember the name of the album.
It's an old, old album.
It's all that's morbid, depressing stuff.
And there's one song in there.
I can't...
Somebody will call it and tell you.
Okay.
By the way, the rest are going to win the World Series this year.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, good luck to you.
Somebody's well, just called it all off the way things are going now.
All right.
Just have a forfeit.
Yeah, I got one other question for you.
Yeah.
Yeah, I was the latest you heard on that.
There's a wild.
On what?
On Liz Wilde, number her.
Liz Wilde.
Yeah.
From She?
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't think she's given any more interviews.
I know that.
Now, I used to work there.
And she?
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Now, what do you sound so depressed?
Wow.
There's a pretty ugly scene over there.
Woo!
Did you suggest you're not having a dinner?
In Tonegly, every chase you up and down the hall with a hammer?
Which one?
Tonegly.
The daughter.
Really, with a hammer, huh?
Well, we'll find out.
We'll get answers to all of your questions, sir, because that's what we're here for.
All right.
Okay.
Have a good life.
See, now I put it together.
I want to know the song about suicide, and he used to work at Chi.
It all kind of fits together.
We have two openings in Broward, which is a shocking, I think everybody's at a school,
and I don't care what Marvin says.
In Broward 524WYOD, he knows the name of the album?
See, I told you.
Dear Field.
Hey, how you doing now?
We're mostly the people in Dear Field are suicidal, especially if you're under the age of 100, like this color.
Well, you know, one or two of us.
The name of the album is...
It's from the movie, The Quadraphineal.
Quadraphineal, that's the one.
It's a great album, but it is very modern.
No, more morbid, and there's one cut on there, man.
I can't think of the name of it.
It's something like Steeley Dan.
Are we out of gas?
Something like that.
I'm not.
It's real depressing.
Hey, I sent you a shirt a little while ago.
Yes.
But I sent you a double X, and I thought I heard you say the other day that you're down to a felt little like 18, you said?
No, I'm not 18.
Tire is 16, sir.
16.
18.
You're practically a ballerina now.
Yes, Cloth.
That's good.
So, the next shirt...
Very tight.
What?
I should send you the next shirt.
I should send you, like, a heart.
What was it?
Excuse me?
What was it?
Well, I sent you two, but I sent you one with a whale on it.
A whale on it?
Yeah.
What was it?
Like a Debbie Ellis t-shirt?
Yeah, there you go.
No, it was on the front and the back.
I don't recall getting that.
Well, it was kind of like...
You know, you have like...
All kinds of thieves, I think.
I know it.
And we have people that sign my name, forge my name to stuff here.
I'm beginning to find out what the hell's going on here.
Well, it's good, because it was kind of a company shirt, and the company's not mine, so it doesn't matter that you didn't get it.
Good.
Anyways, double X, so I'll send you a, like, a large one.
I'm going to, like, triple X.
Seriously, what size will fit you, I want?
As in Debbie does Donald's stuff like that.
Large, just a regular large.
Oh, that one.
Regular normal person size on the...
Oh, and you know something else?
What else?
In reference to last week, the deadhead they called in and said they're all Smith's sucks.
Well, we have a few of those.
Well, people with no taste.
Any would taste in their nostril.
Well, I happen to be a deadhead.
And anybody that is a deadhead that will say something like that about arrow Smith, you know, obviously isn't all the way there yet.
They get some space to grow.
They have Gary Garcia disease, that's their problem.
Well, I like the dead, and I also like arrow Smith.
All right.
And nobody's perfect.
And the album that I fell in love with was...
And Stan would say half a meat loaf is better than on it.
The Dream On album that...
Outstanding.
Mama Kinn.
Yep.
That's the song.
Okay.
Hey, Neil, talk to you later.
Have a good day.
Glacix, it will probably be like a three horse field.
Well, it's an ever great day.
Let me tell you something.
Quickly, quickly.
I have to leave here every 14 years.
I've left to go to work.
Worrying about whether you'll be here when I get back.
This year, I don't have to worry.
I'll be here.
Thank God.
Okay.
By the way, speaking of racing, I spoke to a great gentleman in the business.
Phil Saltsman yesterday.
Big news from New York.
Marshall Cassidy has been put out to pasture.
He's going to become a racing official of some kind.
Any kind will be good for us.
And Tom Durkin will become the New York Racing announcer at Belmont,
an aqueduct in Saratoga, starting August 29th.
So thank God for good news.
Okay.
Here's Henry Barrow, who says thank God for good booze.
Newstalk Radio 610.
WIOD presents Neil Rogers.

All that to find is space for bed.
The host calls him sleep and all his tears.
He wants to say hi to be well-peded.
But normally seems like that is keen by making her sign a greener shoe.
So cheer man, concoctured flat, to make Donald look rather silly.
To total columnist friends, the whole ugly end.
And I don't think this is really...
Oh, Donald was smart, deal of makingses are.
I have fun, the life that was trying to hear.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I sort of was drunk at lunch and I was like you know playing beer-��zoned girl driving
And I don't need some imagery by the way.
You can't go.
Come on down it.
Well, do do do do do.
Come on down it.
Well, do do do do do.
I saw it down it must have the soul.
I love it.
It's 11-08 at W.I.D.
I know you don't like it, but that's too bad, because I don't really care.
Bill Costford, the movie I'm even from The Herald is just a real rock contour and general
pain in the ass will be here at noon.
And Wayne Arnold will be here at 12.30 with some food so we can keep him occupied.
Don't have to listen too much of his BS.
And then Rick and Puts will be along at 2 this afternoon.
What do we got?
We've got a schedule here somewhere we hope.
Yes, sir.
Sunny and Joe on Sports Talk at 6.05.
And another great performance by the Yankees.
Man, are they doing it?
How the Red Sox and the Yankees 7.35 from Fenway to night, okay?
We do have an open light and brown.
Oh, don't forget the ballgame in Pompodo, a beach tonight, weather permitting, double
headers starting at 7 o'clock and you get two games for the price of none.
If you mention the arrangers at the gate, okay, they'll let you in free all your degenerates,
W.I.O.D., nice talking to you.
Probably another order.
A West Palm Beach.
I'll come you don't like Mr. Radio.
What?
I'll come you don't like Mr. Radio.
For the same reason I don't like you, get off my phone, you creep as somebody would
say who's no longer here and who's on the verge of losing his job, W.I.O.D.
Hey, good morning, Mr. Neal Rogers.
Yes, sir, Mr. Mr. Mr. Mungata.
That's what they call me.
What are we going to do with Mr. Super Dave and Mr. Radio with those two?
Where are we going to bury them?
We're going to kick their tupuses out of the stadium tonight.
Exactly.
Oh, so help me.
Super Dave's here because I've seen him at, I've seen his fat face in body at Pompodo.
We don't want it in here.
He shows up there.
We don't want him there.
Just find something else to do, okay?
We're sick and tired of people imposing their presence when they're not the desired.
Instead of a 17th impression, we'll have a 17th inning kickoff.
Okay.
We'll kick their butt right out of the stadium, okay?
Right to the old gold post, say?
Can I be a part of that, Joe?
Right to the crossbar.
I'm ready to roll.
I'm like an SNM caller here.
We ought to play the marquee desan for this guy.
Hey.
I just want to play these cards.
Do you realize that we, uh-oh, new kids on a block, so you're going ahead.
Why is this video in black and white?
I want to say this.
Let's discuss that with cost for it.
I'm going to put that down.
Hey, it's a three-mooring subject.
But this blood, these are too crafty.
Shoot it on, oh, it's not in black and white.
It's a bit like, crap.
Part of it's in black and white.
Over that crap.
Look at which part.
Over that crap that Alex made it was doing.
What was it called?
Mailbox movies?
Where do you have black lines?
Letterbox, letterbox format, which is the most depressing and annoying way.
And it looks like it's all squeezed in, you know, like it's squoes.
Is that like, like somebody squos it too hard?
God almighty.
What was I thinking about when I first saw this group?
I must have been, my vision must have been real bad.
You must have been playing with the dog.
Is this the hooter man?
Yeah.
Oh, Melvin recognized you.
I wasn't paying any attention.
Yeah, yeah.
I was thinking about those lyrics to that Johnny Mathis record when he was singing something
about Low Over Jordan.
There you go.
I didn't get a chance to talk Dirty with Melvin today.
Oh, really?
Well, that's why he looks a little depressed.
He easily picked a little deprived.
He easily picked something.
He easily picks up and we compare worse stories, you know?
Yeah.
But anyway, we're having Jordan going to be in here on Thursday.
Who do you?
From New Kids on the Block.
Oh, no.
Don't lower yourself, dude.
Don't lower myself?
Boy, I got a good line for that.
That's what Johnny Mathis was saying.
Something about Low Over Jordan.
Yeah, but remember, you're going to have a piece of the rock for that.
Yeah?
Well, I'm not going to touch any of your materials here because you're a filthy disgusting,
perverted sick, grotesque person.
And we hope you call soon.
But you like me.
Have a nice day.
It's 11 past 11 at W-I-O-D, where we're sick as hell and that's why you listen.
We have an open line in Broward, 524 at W-I-O-D.
That is an interesting thing.
This video starts out.
I never really paid that much attention before, but I'm paying a lot closer attention now.
It starts out in black and white.
And then it like blossoms into full color.
And then there are like portions of it that are in black and white.
Like I said, only moments ago, I think this is pretty clever and pretty, uh,
intellectual for real as opposed to pseudo-intellectual.
And don't forget one of the great suits in the history of South Florida, Bill Cosfiddle
allegedly be here at noon and we'll believe it when we see it.
Miami.
Hello, Neil.
Yeah.
How you doing today?
OK.
Hey, somebody was calling before.
Swazies restaurant is Mall Howland Drive Cafe.
Right.
That's right.
It's in the water, uh, ways.
It's right there.
But it's got nothing to do with the unicorn.
It just happens to be close by.
That's right.
Well, that's that guy was in the ballpark out about it.
Yeah, right.
And my cup, Jay, the ballpark.
How 96 is sitting in, huh?
Well, I guess he's not from Palo 96 anymore.
Well, no from FPL most recently.
That's right.
And you guys have something common.
I took both your pictures.
Oh, is that all we have in common?
Well, we don't want to go into that.
Well, you guys both probably like arosness.
Yeah.
And you know how I feel about arosness, but I don't want to go into that.
And new kids on the board.
New kids.
My kids got some of those new kids cards.
I'll start saving you the double.
What is that?
No, they baseball cards.
Are they coming to pack?
Now they've got the new.
Are you serious?
Where the God, he came home with two yesterday.
He came home with two.
What cards are the group?
For the kids.
Well, yeah, they're personal friends about that.
Oh, that's OK.
The packs of cards.
And the gun was pretty good, too.
Uh-huh.
Oh, I used to love that boy.
When I was a kid and got those baseball cards,
I'd get like 20 packs.
And I would feel compelled because people were starving somewhere
in the world.
I feel compelled to chew every watt of food.
Beetle piece.
Your dentist like it.
We're going to, even some of the people are in color.
And the boy, this is interesting, the way they photograph.
Yeah, quick photography.
And some of the people in the background are black and white.
This is fantastic.
See, I'm getting into this arty, crafty stuff.
You know how they do that, don't you?
No.
Well, it's filmed in black and white.
And then they just add in the color.
Oh, they bring Ted Turner in.
Ted Turner.
You colorize new kids on a block.
Ted, you should be ashamed of yourself.
Can my two-year-old say hello to you?
When they're going to start showing those brave games
in black and white, they're really going to do it.
Yes, go right ahead.
No, you're too scared.
OK, good one.
You like that?
Excellent.
You know, talking about douche bags,
that lead story today, that guy that shook that kid,
I think we should get him like somewhere
and also some stones.
Yeah, with the Super Dave and Mr. Radio, all in the same bus.
A Greyhound.
I'll see you later, Neil.
Be closing.
Yes.
Tarosmiths, they don't really suck.
They're just not great.
Bye.
What does he know?
W-Y-O-D.
How you doing?
OK.
Done right.
OK, son, right?
Hold on.
We have an open line in date, one in Palm Beach,
two on the board at the same time, not a very happy site.
These are not happy moments at W-Y-O-D
because the video just ended.
A 751-9463-751-W-Y-O-D in Palm Beach.
I see, all of this, I guess these guys are passing
now, right, because the assumptions is much hotter.
They're like only making about four million a day of peace now,
instead of like 20 million.
See, I can't relate to that.
I don't understand what that's all about.
A Palm Beach W-Y-O-D in your mobile.
Neil.
You're on the air right now.
Can't touch your sony.
What's happening?
What?
I want to be a part of your six shows.
Yeah.
Yeah, you got a good start on this, Carl Sir.
Yeah.
How about you?
Hello, baby.
How about getting your head out of the muffler, pal?
Yeah, I'm trying it.
It's right in there, though.
OK.
Wow.
That was a caller for Rick and a mutt.
It's 1115 at W-Y-O-D.
We have an opening in Palm Beach where Mr. Music just hung up
655 W-Y-O-D.
I just, I can't get over those two slabs, man.
Mr. Radio and Super Dave keep calling back
and calling back.
It's like there are people like that I've
mentioned it many times before.
There are people who will just not go away.
You tell them I can't stand you.
You're disgusting.
You wrote tests.
You're obnoxious.
We hate you like poison.
The audience wants you up.
Hold it.
The boogie board spot just came on.
It's 1115 at W-Y-O-D.
We need somebody to fill this space.
Hi, Uncle Neil.
Hi, do you want, buddy?
Guess who?
How many guesses do I get?
Mori, boogie.
Yeah, I'll be very happy to fill and play a spot when you're gone.
Mori, boogie.
Yeah, well you're, Gilbert.
Well, you got two chances of that, Gilbert.
What's that?
None and much less than none.
Oh, because.
Yeah, oh because, yeah.
Yeah, because.
You're not about as much chance of filling in on my vacation
as blind Mike has doing morning drive on QAM.
Oh, I say.
Yeah.
Well, I guess, yeah.
Gilbert, tonight's the big night, eh?
Yeah, I know.
I'm looking.
Now, when are we going to have you sing and take me out
to the ball game?
Because there's seven in the games.
And there will be no seventh inning stretch.
We'll have to do it like in the middle of the fifth inning.
Well, I'll be my happy to.
The fifth inning's ready to go.
Yeah, you're ready to go.
You're ready to go.
You're ready to go.
Good.
And I guess you probably heard me on Sunday, right?
No, I sure didn't.
You mean you didn't hear the, uh, how?
No, I sure did not, Gilbert.
When my life gets that empty that I have to listen to WKAT on Sunday,
we'll be the day I pull the trigger as Roy Rogers.
Oh, because he, he out invited you over to it.
So, he said, he said, yeah, good luck.
I'll be so.
Good luck to him, Gilbert.
I, I say.
We don't slum around.
It's sub, substandard.
The douchebag radio station is like the cat, OK?
Yeah.
Got it, Gilbert?
Yeah, it's like a real looking flood on the outside.
Well, we'll see you tonight, Gilbert.
Yeah, and also next Wednesday.
We'll see you tonight, Gilbert.
OK.
OK.
Like I said, for just a moment or two there,
to fill that spot.
But briefly, it's 1117 and WIOD.
We have one opening indeed.
WIOD.
Anyone?
What is it?
Hello?
Yes.
Got a, a version of your song for you here.
Hold on, and we have an opening in Bokinon,
and everybody will be happy.
2789463.
What song is it?
Matt Hissin-Eyed.
Oh, he didn't even wait.
Hold on a second.
Are you there?
And he hangs up.
Man, then I'll use your, whoever that was,
you are so dumb that it's frightening, OK?
You are so dumb that you make like, I'm
trying to think of a real dumb.
You make Bart Simpson seem like Albert Einstein and drag.
OK, sir?
I was going to put you on over just a second,
let you show your ass to the whole world, do your thing,
and he puts it on in the middle,
and I'm trying to talk to this idiot and he's gone.
And you can hear some little baby wailing
in the background pathetic, that little child
in the background here has got a higher IQ than you do.
That was so weak, so bad.
But we enjoyed it.
WIOD.
I'll fill your opening.
Cute.
It's 1118 in WIOD.
Now, see, that was a pervert.
I know who that was.
You know who that was?
That was that pervert.
I know him.
He's a real screamer.
Anyway, let's talk about char-hut right now.
If you're in the mood for a great lunch,
char-hut is the place to find it.
Lunch that is, if you live in Oral Springs,
Coconut Creek, North Lauderdale, Marguerite,
or any of the other seven location areas,
that's kind of a little awkward, right?
If you live by char-hut anywhere,
you got to get over there and try some of the new things
on the menu.
For example, well, these aren't new things on the menu,
but it's a new deal.
It's the Neil Deal at all seven soft Florida char-huts,
two of their delicious Buffalo-style jumbo hot dogs,
those gigantic weenies cooked on the grilled char-b-world,
just the way you like them with your choice
of fresh delicious toppings,
and a large soft drink, just $2.99.
That's the Neil Deal every day at char-hut.
And if you're watching the wait like some of us are,
then I'll have a 296 calorie quarter pound chicken breast.
For those of you who have to kind of watch what you eat,
that they cook on the grill exactly the way you like it,
like they cook everything,
or if that's not enough, if you're a real big fresher,
they introduce the half pound double chicken breast
to like more breast for lunch, okay?
It is just unbelievable, and it's waiting for you only.
At char-hut also brand new, the new kids combo, kids 12 and under,
get a hot dog or hamburger, fry in a small drink for half price.
At char-hut right now, the best ingredients cooked exactly
the way you want it fresh on the grill,
you can't beat it with a stick.
At char-hut open every morning,
early at 10.30 for lunch dinner and great late night snacks,
inexpensive, the food is delicious,
and sure beats the hell out of those fast food joints, okay?
Seven, stop floating char-huts, you'll find them in Tamarack.
Sunrise Hollywood, Davey Oakland Park Miami,
and the newest char-hut at 306 North State Road 7 in Margate.
-♪ Six in, up to fire, young man. -♪
I don't believe you, Johnny Dark, you are a shameless person, okay?
Go back and play some of that good stuff.
They are playing good music over there, it's frightening,
not as good as we do, but pretty damn close.
Do not play this yet.
Next move.
Excuse me.
Is that a bugle in your chains?
Why, yes, it is.
Get in.
I know flight of the bumblebee.
And I bet you know, Splitwood grew her too.
It's 11.22 at WIOD, where we're just having one hell of a day.
Hey, don't forget the ballgame is tonight.
I keep reminding you that because God only knows we hope we have a few people show up.
At Pompatome Municipal Stadium, 7 o'clock,
double header will be there for the first game,
A, between the Miracle and the West Palm Beach Expo's.
And just mention my name at the door or Gilbert's name,
and you get in free in the first 750 fans who show up,
get a free Miracle pennant, and a coupon good for one free dinner
when you buy one at either wings plus location.
Sounds incredible.
Miami.
Yeah, now.
I have to call Steve a lady, a bunch of knuckleheads.
Yeah.
And I'll see you tonight.
OK.
Good one.
Kendall.
Oh, Neil.
Yeah.
Hey, do I have a spire report?
OK, sir.
Rocks guy to fight over in Texas.
No way.
Yeah.
You're joking.
I swear to God.
For what?
I don't know.
Usual stuff I would imagine.
I'm not just in self-centered.
OK.
But I'll check it out.
What's the chances of him being hired now at WIOD
with maybe two to six making an adolescent trio there?
None.
What a schmendrick.
OK, there's the call.
You can do four hours on that, guys.
Those guys are doing great.
Leave them alone.
OK, cut the crap.
Nick just brought me in.
What magazine is this?
Oh, the Center Tammant Magazine, the one
with that ugly grotesque Arnold Schwarzenegger on the cover.
He may.
Let's talk with Bill Cosper about Arnold Schwarzenegger
for about two seconds.
Oh, is he just, he represent, he's
like a step above.
And I do say above our Sylvester Stallone, just one step.
And that Maria Schreiber boy, she
must have seen something that the rest of us can't see.
Because boy, what, what a, what a couple that is, huh?
Here's a broad with no chin at all.
Maria Schreiber.
She's attractive, except like down to the lip,
but under the lip, there's like a chin missing.
And here's him, who's like, it was probably good in the sack,
but other than that, I mean, what a great intellectual coupling.
But anyway, inside this magazine,
here's the thing on New Kids on the Books.
It says, some people are calling New Kids on the Block,
the hottest pop property since the Beatles, who,
three of New Kids books are on the paperback best
analyst, the lives and loves of the New Kids on the Book.
And there's a picture here.
And of course, the four on the left, they can all drop dead.
But there's Jordan wearing a, what do you, like,
coveralls with nothing underneath?
Isn't that disgusting?
And Johnny Mathes is thinking something
about lowering over Jordan.
New Kids on the Block, a block scrapbook,
and the other one is New Kids on the Block period.
That's it.
No, not with a period after block.
Well, it's kind of interesting.
Nick, not too sunny, but save the picture.
25 past 11 at WIOD.
Let's go to Coke and a Creek.
Deal.
Now that we've discovered MTV, man, life is worth living.
Yes, sir.
Neil, listen to your buddy from Rochester, New York.
All right.
Now we're talking.
Let's talk some shwagos white hats.
I had some.
I just got back yesterday.
Let's talk about Vick and herbs.
Let's talk about some real stuff.
And Dona Bob's.
Let's talk about the.
The chocolate almanac cream.
Oh, yeah.
And sense of recards.
Oh, wait, did they really change an Emadonna Bob?
They're original.
Oh, I mean, the one out didn't the bright.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I didn't go there.
I went to the one that the lake.
I didn't realize it was there anymore.
But he's still that's your regional.
That's what Don Barbedo started many, many.
Oh, I understand that.
But I used to live in Brighton, sir.
I went to school right next door to Dona Bob's in Brighton.
I've spent, I don't know how many days they're just shoveling
that stuff down my throat.
Yeah.
Well, then he sold that wants to, uh, I'm
trying to think.
The guy from Wendy's who's destroying that place.
He's.
Oh, it's terrible.
I don't go there anymore.
I know.
He's just.
I don't know that one.
But I go to one now down that sea breeze.
That's a.
Does he still, they're still doing it there, huh?
You can't believe it.
It's such a, it's such a dreary place.
The big thing is they go down by the marina there where the boats are
and the bugs are and that's the big deal for the whole weekend there.
Yeah.
Wow.
That's good.
They bring a few lilacs down here and sniff the flowers.
Yeah.
You know, we, you, uh, you were very nice this year when we, uh, I invite
you to the Rochester picnic at the T. Y. Park, you know,
every Tuesday, but we won't be having that till next.
Well, what did he know was very nice.
I didn't show up.
I don't.
Yeah, well, next year, and then we start after Thanksgiving, uh, next year
and every other Tuesday, we're going to have the picnic there.
And here you and mom are always invited.
Great.
Well, we're going to show up on these times.
Yeah.
And I'll have to listen to you.
Want me to bring it back to.
No, no, sir.
I can't, I, I approached you at it, but I can't to mess around with those things
right now.
And if I could, Wayne Arles got him already a ship's in from.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Yeah, you told me that the place on 125th Street, that's a seven.
You bet you.
Did you know Pete Pavia?
No, sir.
I know Joe Pavia.
He drives it.
Pumpano.
Yeah.
No, the Pete was the NBA referee in basketball.
No.
He had a setback.
No, I knew less Harrison.
Oh, who did that Jack Harrison and Mugsy Solomon and met your uncle.
Right.
Right.
That's right.
It wasn't.
Let me tell you, he was one classy guy.
Yes, sir.
And he never stole a freight train.
No, he was great.
You know, I was going to tell you that Pete Pavia and Nick on 11th, they're going to have
a banquet form that guy has in remission.
And he's been, you know, pretty sick.
But listen, everybody watches their like, oh, the red wings are the Niel.
The red wings are in first place.
They're doing it.
Oh, yeah.
They're doing it.
I'm going to take up an internationally.
Forget the Cubs.
I'm going to the internationally.
Listen, I, I, I got something for you.
I got a shirt and I was trying to send it here.
I got an accident.
I got her pretty bad, but I'm okay now.
Okay.
I got one of those shirts that you know, wearing a house.
I got the Cubs shirt for you.
Great.
I can't wear it in the John.
Get, bring it down.
I'll wear it in the bathroom.
You want me to bring it down there at the station or anything that makes you happy?
Where's the nervous convenient for?
I want to tell you, let me, Rochester.
I go up there because I got grandkids and my mother-in-law there.
Otherwise, it's just a big waste of time.
The weather wasn't 84.
The weather stinks and the lilac smell and just not what you can't go back.
Well, listen, have a great day.
Listen, nice talking to you sometimes when I got a kid to you, but I just call the station
and give you some, or come down.
Give me some what?
Neil?
What?
I'll bring this shirt down.
I come down.
Great.
We'll look forward to it.
All right.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
Get that other call.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, thank God for call waiting.
29 past 11 at WIOD.
We got two open lines in Broward.
I can't imagine why.
524, White Hot.
524 at WIOD.
Boy, this is a pressure building now.
Bill Cosper is supposed to show up.
He won't be here.
No way.
Sunrise.
Hi, Neil.
How are you?
Okay.
I'm calling today to talk to you about golf.
Do you know anything about it?
No, sir.
Thanks for the mic, and here is your show.
I have no interest in golf.
I know nothing about it.
It's boring.
It's tedious.
It's clever.
It's terminal.
Call me here.
He's a golf.
What is it?
I understand that coming from you, but I have to, I need a favor from you.
But I'm my good friend Todd Monahan.
Just shot a 79 Sunday on a golf course.
At a boy, Todd, you're a great American.
At a way to go, man.
And I'd also like to call a 3-back for a 26-hole.
No, that was for 18.
All right.
And I'd like to call Bill, Todd, a douchebag.
Great.
And Todd, can I please have another ass lipid?
Have a good day, Neil.
Okay.
Good one.
I wonder if that was figurative or literal.
Well, we'll find out, I guess.
1129 at WIOD.
We have two opens.
Broward's been a little strange today.
A little spotty, a little spotty.
The way things have been going lately, we don't expect this kind of thing.
524, WIOD is that Broward number.
Chris, they're all waiting for cuss for the show up, then they're all going to disappear.
WIOD.
Back to talk to Neil, please.
Sure, hold on.
You'll be on about the three hours.
WIOD.
Neil, please.
Speaking.
I can talk to Neil, please.
See, I know it.
I just always have a thing that I knew which ones are ready and which ones are full of crap.
WIOD.
I want to talk to Neil.
Yeah, sure.
WIOD.
Broward.
Yeah.
What do you want?
Who is it?
Adam.
Adam from where?
From Water Hill, not Marimond.
Oh, that Adam.
Okay, hold on Adam.
WIOD.
Is this car talk?
What is it?
Car talk, yeah.
I literally probably was my 89 books wagon.
Yeah.
Who's this Ted Bundy?
Parking in Lakeland would be a good place to park it right out in front of ABC Lickers.
Uh-huh.
And there's little bugger all come out and he'll get a start to run up for you.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Little, uh, little guy.
Not bugger.
Booger?
Is that on the corner of the...
Oh, jeez.
Now I'm really depressed.
Here's, uh, what's his name Van Halen?
Oh, he makes me sick.
Is that Eddie Lee Roth?
David, yeah, Eddie Lee Roth.
David Lee Roth.
Oh, jeez.
I can hear his grotesque.
Here's, uh, man.
Do we have to get started with David Lee Roth again like we did on Seda?
I hate him.
I just, he makes me want a barf.
Uh-huh.
And he's, uh...
Stop living, stop breathing forever.
Stop the compared arrow Smith through.
I beg your pardon?
Did you say arrow Smith and the same breath with David Lee Rothser?
Yeah, arrow Smith.
That's a short call.
And it's 1131 at WYOD.
We have an opening in Broward again.
Broward seems to be like a little cantankerist today, aren't they?
Or is it just the canker part we're looking at?
WYOD.
I hope it pours tonight.
Do you?
Yeah.
Why is that?
It's your stiff.
Oh, okay.
You're a stiff.
But you're out there listening, pal.
Mr. Stiff, you wish you were a stiff.
WYOD.
Yeah, Neil?
Yeah.
How come, uh, I call the other day from Detroit, I call it.
Oh, no wonder we shouldn't take any calls from Broward.
Speaking of stiff, man, everybody's call from Broward is in the bag.
You call from Detroit the other day?
Yeah, and they wouldn't take the quite call.
I call it pop-up.
Of course not.
We don't want to talk to a bunch of boring people in Detroit.
It's a crappy place.
Well, that's not it.
We've got enough of them here, sir.
I thought you liked Detroit.
From years ago, yeah, it was great.
Okay.
Before pre-derriate, it's okay, pre-67.
Anyway.
So, that's, uh, I was just, uh, you always say call at one and I try to call.
Well, hey, don't look at me.
I didn't answer the phone.
But blame Melvin for it.
He's the one.
Oh, no.
The thing was the operator went even let the call go through.
She says, they're not.
She said they don't take call at calls on their line.
And I said, what?
Well, do you tell that operator?
She can spin on this.
Okay, tell her to drop it.
Okay, I'll do that.
Okay.
Okay, thanks.
What a jerk that ran the operator too.
1132 at WIOD, we have an opening and brow art.
Brow art.
Brow art.
We keep sending like a stuck record, like something in the time, like in the Holland tunnel.
WIOD.
Inbrow art.
See?
I mean, that was for, wait a minute.
Hello.
Hello.
Nice talking to you.
Sunrise.
Why are we staying on the brow line?
Why do you keep putting all these brow art people on?
There's nobody there anyway.
WIOD, crankline.
See?
Let's go to a paring.
Is that...
Hey, now we've got some real people here in paring.
Let's start Cubs Baseball.
Let's not.
Hold on.
WIOD.
Crankline.
IOD.
Hello.
What is it?
Yeah, I should speak with Neil, please.
Well, how come there was like that long pause?
I don't know.
What was it?
It was strange.
Yeah.
What was it?
Is that on your end?
I'd probably heard it in my head.
Yeah.
Check your end.
Hold on.
WIOD.
Yeah, for Neil, please.
No, we'll...
You're a mobile?
Yeah.
Well, let's get right to it, sir.
Okay.
What do you want?
What's your story?
Oh, Neil, I just call him and get directions for an Arnold's little one back.
Can I just get him and he's eating there?
No, you didn't.
You could never have gotten there that fast.
Hi, kid.
It was delicious.
But I had your favorite white hots and some of those castle burgers or whatever.
Ray.
They were fantastic.
Neely Burgers.
Well, castle burgers.
Well, Neely Burgers.
There you go.
Arnold Burgers.
But I am stuffed to the gill and I'm hidden down towards the Kindle now.
For what?
Well, I'm doing business.
I'm one of those sweetly sales mv.
Oh, good.
Good.
I wish I had the card out to play for you, but right now I don't have the energy.
It's been a very stressful morning.
Well, when you get a chance, play the 95's, so I'm for you because I had to fight that hell.
I just drive down here today.
Okay.
Well, I'm glad you did see Wayne.
Was he there?
Yeah, he was there.
What do you say?
Actually, he served me.
Well, Arnold served you personal?
Yeah.
Wow.
Did you hear your call?
Yeah.
He must have been pretty impressed, huh?
Yeah.
He was the glad that you gave directions.
Well, that's great.
You're saying that advertising is saying all the same tips, sir.
All right.
Come on.
Okay.
Don't call us twice again, ever.
W-I-O-D.
Oh, Neil?
Yeah.
Speak up.
Speak up.
Come on.
Are you doing today, man?
Okay.
Hold on, pal.
W-I-O-D.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Yeah, okay.
How you doing today?
Great.
I want to ask you something.
I'll bet.
What do you think of that?
The answer, whatever it is, the answer is no.
Let me ask you something, dude.
When you go home, do you go home?
What, why did you say, do I want?
When you go home, do you take 79th all the way to the express army to 95th?
Well, what other way would I go?
Well, you can go far.
No, I take say, man.
I take say, man, I'm straight up here to like the, uh,
bay.
Okay?
Why?
When you take a quick ride, I take, I take off to like a place for steak, okay?
But when you go up there, I take a quick ride and I go fat and I just floor the vent.
I get up to about 135 miles an hour.
That's as fast as I go.
I'll say, well, why, why waste a,
Can you suppose to say you go like a bat out of hell?
No, I don't say that kind of thing on here.
Well, I don't say that kind of thing on here.
Anyway, what I'm trying to get at is, I was driving up 79th.
What the hell are you talking about?
I was driving up 79th.
Yeah.
And right at the railroad tracks there, just east of the bay.
Oh, speaking of the railroad tracks, I'm coming to work this morning and there were like two freight train cars, two cars.
And they screwed up the traffic, and people were getting exasperated.
The bars were down, you know, the railroad things.
And people were going around them and this guy, he gets out in the middle of the street on the tracks with the two cars and it stops there.
And then he backs up, I mean, you people between the guy with the bridge up here who's a rear lia, who in the guy with the train,
You people ought to be just impealed and oil is.
Well, guess what's right by the railroad tracks?
You're the skewer.
Guess what's by the railroad tracks?
What?
They got this new billboard of you.
You're talking about sickly teeth.
Oh, no, not the one with the soap.
No, the new one?
On the new one?
Man, you guys, your teeth are, uh, on the old car.
My point is, uh, no.
Oh, no.
Man, I'm telling you.
Oh, geez.
You're talking about Steve.
No, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I'm bisqin in 79th.
What the hell kind of a place is that?
Oh, that's an appropriate place to have a big mouth.
Well, all right.
So the railroad tracks are like two blocks up from there.
But I mean, what kind of an area is that for my billboard?
There's nobody in this.
Nobody who drives that area listens to this radio station, okay?
They can draw the metro.
All of them are all listening to radio and Moscow or something.
They're a bunch of Kamalistas.
I'm telling you, you should see.
Right by the immigration building, they're all the people
looking off the boat and see that billboard.
That's it.
And those teeth, man.
Those teeth.
Oh, geez.
They look like big kicklets and big, big pieces of the sidewalk.
Like an earthquake happening in your mouth or something.
They're all jagged and crooked.
I tell you, or at the down this nightmare.
Wow.
It's really something to see.
Melvin sawd all he sees, like, puking in the air.
I figured they put it there so you could see it.
But I said, oh, maybe they don't know.
Well, I still have, I must be, I must be dynamite,
because I haven't noticed it.
Well, go straight on 79.
Don't turn it on.
Don't turn by where?
Well, that's right.
No, I don't.
Oh, I see.
In other words, it would be going west on 79.
See, I go, no, I, now I understand your question.
No, I go on the first three.
I go 80 first, because it's a much less travel.
Oh, going up 79, speed.
You got to have your head examined.
That's horrendous.
Well, you got bulletproof.
Oh, I know I don't mean that.
I'm just talking about the driving.
Man, there is so slow.
By the way, this video, this video by heart,
all I want to do is, you would all over you,
and that video is a killer.
That is sensational.
Well, let me say Steve Tyler and Mick Jagger
have nothing, can't hold a candle to you in that poster.
You damn right.
What a mouth.
Okay.
All right. Thanks for the warning.
22 till noon at WIOD, your incompetent station.
For the 90s, let's tell you about shells right now.
If we can, today is Tuesday.
Yeah.
You may not know it.
But today is the anniversary of the marquee desad's birth.
So I suggest we bake a birthday cake in his honor.
First, crack open a couple of eggs and separate them.
Search them right.
Then beat those yolks.
Yeah, beat them good.
Then whip those egg whites until they're fluffy
and you're feeling good.
Flamat together with two cups of flour and a pinch of nutmeg.
Now take a sharp knife and slice up the cherries.
Really chop them.
Then let's crush some nuts.
Grind or pulp and dump the whole thing in the batter
and throw it in a blistery hot oven.
You bake it till it burns up.
Then you eat your feet by get juved all over again.
Happy birthday, marquee desad.
Sometimes I feel myself.
1141 at WIOD.
You're a fun station for the 90s.
WFU in.
Let's go to Palm Beach.
Hey Neil, how you doing?
Fun radio.
IOD where you want.
Yeah.
I love that.
And that was pretty good.
That was pretty good.
Actually, I'm going to take that big job in Buffalo
and you might be hired, sir.
15 hour at all the Kilbasa he can handle.
And a date with Paul Isle.
A date with Paul Isle?
I'll get back to you.
Wonderful, a wonderful liel of dreams.
So what's going on?
Well, we're having a great time.
Bill Cosford will be here at noon,
which ought to be pretty damn excited.
Yeah, right.
No, seriously, we got a lot of people out there
into movies now.
No, nothing about that.
No, nothing about that.
We got all the good stuff.
Because I got all those channels on my satellite
that I watch movies on.
So how are they?
Right?
No, a cost for it knows about movies.
It's fit into a...
Temple and room for the Soviet Army left over.
Robert Scott's grape stain.
Got it. Is he there yet?
No, he may ain't going to show up.
If he does show up, he'll be late.
I like to give him a piece of my...
Wait a minute, sir.
The juicy fruit spot is just coming on now on MTV.
Oh, gee.
Well, that's the end of my day.
I can't handle this, okay?
No wonder they want to ban MTV and Hellen Day.
Amanda Pacemaker's law short circuit over there
if they saw any of this.
So what's this about you and Michael Jordan?
Oh, gee.
What is it?
What's this about you and Michael Jordan?
No, not Michael Jordan, sir.
We stick with winners on this.
Okay. I told you the pistons would kick their ass tonight.
Oh, yeah. Well, yeah.
We had a last before Don concludes.
I was like, what was it? Like, almost 20 points in our last game.
What did 90...
Yes.
19 points.
That Portland was going to kick their ass.
Nah, I get Portland, are you?
Oh, you're even...
The cervical.
The quail blazers get out of here.
They're up in front.
They're a bogus bog club, sir.
Don't know about on a team with uniforms like that.
And speaking of that, did anybody see the college world series
getting this in the Citadel that grubby, grimy, greasy team that beat us here?
They beat Cal State Polarton.
Yeah, I was watching parts of that game.
What was it? 12 innings, I thought.
Yeah, they went 11 or 12 innings yesterday.
12 innings, I think, they won.
8 to 7. It was just nail biting.
horrendous poorly played game.
And who won the LSU game?
I don't know.
When the LSU was there, like Skip Burmese?
Was that guy?
Yeah, and what Skip Burmese coached down here?
Yeah, a system coach for the Kings.
Yes, sir, and a wonderful guy, and he could eat a good meal.
And it looks like he's eaten several since he lost all that weight.
So, once you know, I'm a trifecta.
I've called you from Dave Brower to now, Palm Beach County.
Not today.
No, I understand.
Like over a...
Oh, gee, Gremlins, too.
Here's the spot for it.
Don't you think Gremlins one was enough?
I liked it.
This one was pretty funny.
Well, I thought it was kind of cute.
But cost for it's going to rip it up and...
Yeah, you know.
He's going to rip everything.
Because, first of all, it's in English, which he doesn't like though.
Secondly, it was not made in Vienna, Austria, or somewhere like there.
So, he's going to rip the hell out of it, and they will not show it
at the International Film Festival in... in Can.
Yeah, now you want to know that?
That's his slogan. It's in the Can.
Ask, ask, cost for it about Ron.
And that's where I think he spends most of his time writing his reviews in the Can.
Right.
Ask him about what?
Ron, the movie Ron, with the Japanese director, Akira Kurosawa.
Oh, yeah, Akira Kurosawa.
So, man, you may say that.
That's his favorite.
He loves to say that over and over.
Yeah, I know he does.
Because that makes him sound like a real sued.
Yeah, he gave that four stars, and I stayed up at midnight and watched it on P.M.E.T.
because he said it was so good.
Yeah, anything with Akira Kurosawa, he just goes nuts over that.
Two hours and 40 minutes, Neil.
Yeah.
And it was a...
But I'll tell you one thing.
I'll tell you one thing. He loves this show though.
He's obsessed with the show.
You don't understand it, though.
Through Akira Kurosawa?
Yeah.
In concert.
He's obsessed with the show.
I mean, like...
He's so far beyond just Neely.
I mean, he's like 20 stages beyond that.
He can't help himself, like the four tops.
Yeah, you tell Kurosawa that I said I was coconut smile and...
So...
See ya.
Okay.
Okay.
Good calls today, huh?
No?
1145.
What would you know about a good call?
You wouldn't know a good call if it bid you on a must-deaf.
We have an opening in Palm Beach.
655-Covac.
655-Eurny-Covac.
That's so marvelous.
It looks like the Erny-Covac.
Of course, he got killed.
Let's sit it out, please.
LSU.
So LSU lost.
What a bad break.
I can't believe that.
Yeah, they weren't looking too good.
I saw a little bit of that.
Then, unfortunately, the Cup game came on.
And I watched some of that.
Not too much.
I didn't tape the game last night because I knew right from the beginning they looked flat and useless and useless.
You can just tell with them.
They just like they're going through the motions.
And then I saw the last 20s of the Metz game may be very...
See, it's not important that your team wins.
It's important that the Metz and the Yankees lose.
Okay?
Just remember that slogan.
Are you young people who are listening?
It's not important that your team wins.
It's important that the Metz and the Yankees bite the bag.
And a little twerpy but Haroldson.
Man, what the hell is he going to do?
What is he going to do?
Light a fire under those guys?
They suck.
And a David Cohnhead?
Man!
Get cereal.
Against a bogus team like the Expose.
Let's go to Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
In you, I do it.
Wait.
Just going back, getting back to the flow of things.
You're getting back at us?
Yeah.
Well, I mean, I haven't listened to you guys in like about a month.
For what?
You know, I've been...
I got a new job here and you know, it's been like really busy.
It's the first time that I'm sneaking a peek here.
You're sneaking a peek, huh?
Yeah.
What do you love?
