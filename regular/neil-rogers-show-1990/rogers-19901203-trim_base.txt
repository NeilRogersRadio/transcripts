everything sir in fact maybe if I loaned rick some glasses my glasses he could see the game it's
excuse me I'm sorry Henry it's not reenries bitter because rick kicked him out of the games and
he's really upset you're trying to change the subject oh I'm not I'm talking about the subject

you knew you you were I have laid on and wrong about what rick is a good guy rick I have always
set up until the season for years that he was the best in the business the best in the NFL ever I've
always said that I always met it this year he's gone through uh some problem and what about
sending in the bars of coast soap and all that remember all that he used to have some fun with
him sir like we always do and we'll continue to do okay because he's a fun guy and if you find

but load 1217 to w i o d here's a mobile on the turnpike okay
you know i had a radio accident here on the turnpike just north of open park highway
open park highway that's in Florida medical center uh went out all the old people from
allen dales now a highway is it really you need it uh in any case i was listening to you as i
usually do and paying the tolls that are over inflated on the turnpike and i passed a radio station
w r b d 1470 on your dial yeah rocking big daddy that's the one yeah and they completely
drown you out on my radio yeah for about for about a block what it was great and i turned back
to the station 1470 just to see how far these guys go yeah they didn't make it the Florida
medical center one block that's why they don't show up in a ratings that's all i have Neil okay see
up yeah there's a lot of those stages cause you've heard of drive thros at fast food joints these
are drive-by's you have to drive by the tower in order to hear them i don't want to mention any other
ones that do by the way in spite of what some hosts have said erroneously i mean i'm sure it wasn't
alive it just must be a lack of technical knowledge all directional stations a m stations change
pattern at sundown sundown of course changes each month depending upon the time of year and as
any idiot knows november december jayne where for berigit at this time of the year the days are
shorter and sundown is earlier right like this month it's about five fifteen something like that
and as a result those stations that are a little more powerful the daytime sometimes much more
powerful might come sundown uh whoop there they go and all this hum and puking and crapping
depending on where your listening starts coming in so anybody that knives that is either an
ozha provocateur just a liar a mobile pig report any how you're doing or they show out there
today yes sir yeah if you travel westbound on eight thirty six right after you go into the
farm matter to pick sir hiding on the eastbound side but the eastbound side is higher up you know
it's like thirty feet higher than the westbound right so you can't see them unless you're going east
bound so if you go westbound you got to be cool the pigs are hiding folks pigs are hiding today
yep yeah I uh I heard Steve last week and he was convention about rick and suds and that all they do is
they put uh uh shaving cream in guys pants or whipped cream and all that stuff and he says you know
some people have a mind and they like to have it stimulated so I I called him up and I asked him
I said well let's assume for a minute that what you say is true where do you come in because if
if let's assume half your audience wants their mind stimulated you waste an all that electricity
to stimulate I'll tell you one thing to show you how desperate he is after I give those numbers
out where they had that great trend this morning rumor has it that he was over at records buying
up all the Gillette foamy he could get he may walk in with some heavy duty with a real load the

early we went at 10 o'clock yeah and it wasn't too bad then but the guy one of the guys in the
food court told me that they're sitting on the floor eating because it does get pretty crowded

go with the flow all these people that say oh no big deal I mean what do they want it's not
you know most of the other malls have basically the same kind of stores and the same stuff this

Sometimes I feel myself

We were on the ground, we're always in control
And when you say Miami, you're talking super cool

So that's a go, I talked to the event, of course, is in charge of the entire radio station
And she said no problem, we'll get it all set up, we'll get all the sizes
And the t-shirts too
And here's a little card, isn't that something?
Oh, this is before the, looking forward to seeing you
It's for what kind of male delivery is this?
Oh, she had no zip code, that's why it took longer
She mailed it on November 6th, though, six days ago
Oh, it was my back in 185
Oh yeah, when we last got that free, I get time
There must be a better way, then always asking us to pay
Don't raise the rates, cause if you do, I've got a pitfall
You're let he will too
You always keep me waiting, Mr. Postman
Oh, it's all constricted, mate
I said my hands, I'll get well later
But when he got that, she was already dead
Please, Mr. Postman
But man, I'm so poor, yeah
I get a point, even please, please
Mr. Postman, I want to see you make me nervous
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's not that simple, how bad you're serving
We're paying more, you're doing less
Soon you'll cost more than federal extra-hairs
You raise the rates, but service ain't faster
I'll tell you where you can skip your left-hairs
Rates are rising, rates are rising
Rates are rising, rates are rising
Rates are rising, rates are rising
Rates are rising, rates are rising
Rates are rising, rates are rising
Rates are rising, rates are rising
Rates are rising, rates are rising
Rates are rising, rates are rising
140 at WIB, we have an open line in Palm Beach
for what it's worth, which ain't much, 655 WIOD, Fort Lauderdale
Yeah, can you tell the DJ to play a Vicky Car, must be him?
Thank you
Okay, we'll get that right on for you
142 at WIOD, call from Orlando?
Yeah
Orlando?
Yep, how you doing, Tony?
I'm missing the boat here, what happened with F-T-L
F-T-L?
Yeah, Steve's on or something?
Yeah, Steve's on from two to six in the afternoon
You can pick it up on your pop-up toaster
Who else is on?
That's it, they're playing big bands the rest of the day
Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller
Vicky Car, and it must be him
Johnny Mattress, and it must be it
What do you think about Madden and Summerall?
You like them?
Great, I think
That Summerall is outstanding, he's great
John Madden is hysterical, knowledgeable, but funny is all get out
that they're good, they're at the best
Walsh is an old fart, he does
Walsh is just, oh, he's got a personality
like a dead frog in heat, man
and he is just terminal
That was a good game yesterday
I mean, the first half was sloppy, but the verdict was in doubt
You know, there were a lot of exciting plays
He doesn't know what Zellbo from is that?
Exactly, in fact, if you notice
you never saw Zellbo the whole game, so maybe he was sitting on it
I'll see you
Okay, that was from Orlando, are you serial?
Or was that just, it was collect?
Huh
Well, he shouldn't have anything exciting to say
like I'm up here in Orlando, and it's Mickey Mouse World
and everything, nothing, just like a regular call, what a guy
Okay, we've got five calls left on air, six now
I think that might carry us through the rest of the show
We could play that new Nelson record
after the reign, the title cut, which is their new single, but we're not going to do it
They're going to be here, don't forget the end of December
All your real horny people out there
Thank God I'm not ready to see them
They're going to be here December, okay, 30th and the 31st New Year's Eve
And we're going to try desperately to get them here into the studio
and maybe never let them out
Maybe we can auction them off for Camilla's house
Huh?
Boy, I know who's going to make the first bid on that
Miami, where's my checkbook?
Hey Neil
Hey, how about another Larry King's spy report?
Are you ready for this one?
I don't know if I'm ready or not, you know Larry
I called him up first ever
and I was talking to him and he goes, yeah, I love Miami
You know how you always said
Yeah
And then I hit him with a line and said
If I was you, what would I say to Neil Rogers?
And he already did
Thank you, lovely reading
Yeah
He hung up and then I had to turn the radio on real quick
Yeah
And he was saying Neil Rogers, I haven't heard about that guy
Since he was doing baseball
Yeah, blow me 50 dollars
Unbelievable, that's usually one of his line
Either that I want to be a harness race driver
I was doing baseball, a UM baseball
He likes to pretend that I'm some little underling somewhere
That's making about a buck and a half an hour
And they can't have two nickels to rub together
I'm just jealous of him and his big schnauzerness suspenders
And the sloped shoulders, but that's what I think
Quite frankly, all, you know
Hey, let me tell you something
Hey, you know that commercial you have for Giffy Loub?
Did you have to go to Giffy Loub to get a Giffy Loub?
Have a nice day pal
145 at WID, no wonder Larry gave him a rough time
I don't blame him, I said Jackass
Where should we take our next one from?
How about a mobile in Boka on the Starline?
That's me, what's happening Neil?
We're here, we're ready for it
You guys are doing great in the ring, congratulations
Has it not come as a major shock?
No, not all
Of course not, we knew we were kicking it
That's right
And tell by all the Black and Blue marks
Look at that, suds is eating subway today
I can't believe it, he's in there eating subway before he goes on the air
I cannot believe it, what is it?
It's a sub, of course
What kind?
What kind is it?
What kind is it?
Otuna, ooh
Okay, go ahead, I feel better now
I mean lunch with Tommy Denenberg today
Sir, I'm going out to a little sup and salad place today
I just wanted to bitch about the police again
Yeah
Because up there in Florida they give me a ticket at 123 am
Yeah, when I'm sure there was a lot of traffic around
Exactly
And danger in everyone's life
It was worse than that, I was parked at confetti's
And they're parking me, they have a two per limit on the meters
Who stays in a club for two hours on a Saturday night?
Exactly
I mean the strip shop in center is no merchant, there's no nothing
You can't put like $5 in the machine
Because they're not going to turn the damn knob
Yeah
And they say they're just a bunch of complete morons
I like to call the meter made a douchebag
But they only put their names on the ticket anymore
Well, that's miss douchebag to you, sir
So I just want to get that off my chest and you guys are kicking ass and keep it up
Have a great life, pal
You too
So you haven't heard this in a long time
Oh
He is still world's biggest asshole
Tom Denenberg
Tom Denenberg
Great reading, great
Thank you
You're back here
Okay, 147
13-2 on your incredible station, 6-10
How's the tuna?
Tuna, sub
Oh, geez, that's a goyish, I think
Yeah
6-10
Toppy on D
From the producers of Rescue 911
Comes an all-new emergency drama
We've got difference
Yes
Help me, I've been shot
Help me, I've been shot
The show were victims of mindless violence compete for valuable cash prizes
Where have you been shot?
I in the buttock
That doesn't sound very interesting, sir
Well, there's a lot of blood
Oh, good, don't touch anything
Okay
Remember, these are not re-enactments
These are actual people who've been shot by actual guns
And you'll see it live on tape
On help me, I've been shot
You guys better hurry, I'm fading fast
Don't worry, sir, the camera crew is on its way
Is this mean I win the $10,000?
We'll let our studio audience be the judge of that, sir
Help me, I've been shot
The audience participation show
Where a bullet in the butt can mean money in the bank
Sunday night on five
Poppano
Is this now?
Yes, sir
No, this is super good
Oh
Here's a mobile jets fan
Yeah
You guys did it to me again
Yeah
I was drinking, taking you with me, my hands off, dear
I went to the game, let me tell you something outside to state him
It was freezing
The wind was blowing, it was unbelievable
It was incredible
I was down in the end zone, I was right down in the corner end zone
I've seen where the, you know, that disputed play was
But what are you gonna do?
Yeah, it didn't make any difference
You know, Bill Walsh kept ripping quarterbacks for bad passes
But the fact is that with that wind blow and it's a miracle, anybody completed anything
All right
The wind was just going nuts
It was unbelievable, I didn't think it would be that cold
But it was, it was like a buffalo
But, you know, probably not as cold up there
Didn't you see the tapes from the buffalo game?
I see it, I see it when I got back back
Oh, I know, I believe whatever it was at East Rutherford
Was nothing compared to Buffalo
I mean, it was snow and sleet
And just wind was, it looked like Windsor Ontario on a bad day
Now I'm from Utica, so I know how that weather
There you go, same difference
But, uh, well, you guys beat us twice this year
Well, once the ghost of Joe Walton and Lou Holt's kind of
Disappear fate in the woodwork, you guys will make a comeback
Right, well, I'll raise you next year
Okay, okay, buddy
