Let's check it out. Boy, they're gonna be, you think they're gonna be upset?
Ah! Who was it, girl? This is me, Waylamin!
And a secret word today is...
Transvestite!
Huh?
On a scale of ten, I'll give that about a minus eight.
Sweet, bad and salad thought for dinner and for lunch.
Week. Now here's a good one. This would talk about big and high alia.
And high alia and sweet water, Pee Wee would be number one with this kind of stuff.
Ah! Who was it, girl? This is me, Waylamin!
And a secret word today is...
Cockfile!
The number one half, if you had a pirate station and played at in the high alia, right?
And about ten grand of bed on it.
Do you think this mobile Steve here on the Starline?
Hey, Dale. Yeah.
I think it can't flip your show much in, uh, yesterday.
Yeah. Who bad, go out on a great show yesterday?
Yeah. The market's down eight and a half points.
Did anybody call?
Did anybody call about, uh, Monday Night Football?
What about it?
Did you see it?
No.
You missed, uh, allows you game with real, allows you appreciate.
Yeah, we know.
Yeah. That was probably the worst I've ever seen.
Ever.
Yeah. You didn't miss, you missed it all, huh?
I had no interest in it. Why would I watch the...
I knew the Bengals would beat the cramp out of the grounds.
Why watch it?
Two very, two very boring teams.
Yeah.
There was a, it was a boring game, but uh, the officiating was exciting.
Yeah.
That's what I heard.
I heard it took them five minutes to figure out what down it was.
Yeah, that was one part, but uh, then they made up some rules, though, right there.
Oh, that's good.
Yeah, they're trying to make it a little more exciting.
Yeah, I guess the rules are now written in pencil.
Uh-huh.
Anyway, all right, that's about all I had to say.
Sorry I missed it.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Maybe next time.
Yeah.
Now Spencer, what do you want?
Give you what?
You want to, you want to do something to the side of my car with my key?
Yeah.
How to see it?
Yeah, key this.
I got your key right here, Spencer.
You're giving me, you're giving me coffee.
Oh, quit acting like such a child.
Will you grow up already?
I thought you didn't want me to do your car anymore, Neil.
Grow up, will you act like a man?
Like he said in the Godfather, remember Marlon Brando?
He slapped El Martino in a face act like a me a man.
Grow up, what's up?
And don't mess up my car Spencer under penalty of death.
We'll sit you in Sally, Finss is cheerful two hours.
It's worse than Bundy.
Anyway, it's 1029 and WI-O-D.
We got three calls on the board already this morning.
We're off and running, right?
We're doing it.
Also last night, speaking of TV,
were we speaking of TV, WI-O-U-D?
They had a thing on the Disney Channel, which I bet you there isn't one person in this audience.
I saw once before, but I watched it again.
And it was a David Nelson documentary about his brother,
about Ricky Nelson.
Did anybody see it?
Am I the only one in this entire audience in this entire community?
We saw it on the Disney last night.
It was pretty good.
I've been needing the word to say,
when you say it on stage,
nobody else would need it.
And in the last couple of minutes, they had Rick Nelson's daughter.
What is your name?
Christie.
Christie McNichol, Jr.
And she's cute.
I don't know what she does,
but she was on there talking about her dad.
And then they had the Nelson twins on there.
From, and this thing was from like three, four years ago.
And boy, I'll tell you,
they had to revive me with oxygen after I saw that segment.
Man, unbelievable.
It was pretty good, but I'm sure nobody else saw it.
And how about the, how about the Randy Martenshow?
Wouldn't you think if this was any kind of a community at all,
knowing the tremendous popularity of that program,
that as soon as I mentioned that it,
like 1007 this morning,
every line should have been lit.
Everybody in this audience should have been critiquing that show last night.
Sick career, but desert.
Don't give our a map.
Okay, but they don't care.
Let's take a call from Boca.
Hi, Newly.
Yeah.
How you doing?
Okay.
What are we going to do with those women in the locker room?
What are you going to do?
I'm not going to do anything with them.
What about you?
I don't know.
What should we do with them?
Well, if the cart would have queued up again,
I could have told you, but it hasn't queued up yet.
Okay.
Well, I got something for you, no?
I'm listening.
Okay. Well, that sperm bank was it.
Let's go to a dear field beach.
Hello.
Yeah, I was a,
I was a chronic in.
I was wondering about the double standard of justice.
That was Stein's column today.
Now during the 10th thing, he wouldn't obey the judge,
but he's going to obey the judge until I've crewed.
But there's another article there about Jay Leno.
How he gets his material for his books from the newspaper.
Oh, God.
But, uh, hey, Leno.
On the front page of the Sun Sentinel.
What is the story with Jay Leno?
I read the list of the Jay Michaels and he's not even on anymore.
Yeah, the lantern, Judd, comedian.
Terrible, awful.
But it's never said a funny thing in his life.
But there's a big, the big headline on the front of the Sun Sentinel is about
the thing that they know is real, not letting their ribs in.
Don't give them a map.
Yeah, they killed a bunch of Palestinians yesterday to get even.
They just still, you know, yeah, but then he's right over there at the end of the fall.
They put the sections of the back page and there's a full page ad by L L L.
Come stay with friends.
Yeah, right.
And I just thought that that's I right.
Yeah, my mother yesterday says to me, she said, boy,
tourism's really hurting over there.
I said, that's a real surprise.
That's a shock.
I understand Bay Rune doing too good either.
The Bay Rune Hilton.
Well, you know, it's it's a.
And how about the Saudis, man, they hear Saddam Hussein goes in and he rips the whole country apart
and Kuwait tear it just devastates, trashes the whole country, kills all the people,
destroys the whole country.
That was, hey, listen, we'll give you a little piece.
We got Maddie Hall with us.
We got plenty.
Maddie Hall was on today with Joe Dodgiollo this morning.
He's coming back on NBC.
Maybe he can be the negotiator.
Maddie Hall?
Yeah.
He's already doing it.
Nobody's well, yeah.
He's already on. Well, I know.
But I mean, he's already on.
But he's back temporarily.
He said they brought it back to give it a big send-off.
Yeah.
It's called.
He looks like he looks like Rick Weaver.
He got the same that white here now.
He looks just like Rick Weaver and drag.
I can believe it.
And he brought his own chair with him too.
I was just thinking.
That's why he's always standing up on it, Choke.
There's only one chair he'll sit in.
Listen, and as far as Iran goes, I guess if no one here is, no one can come in.
Now, there were people listening.
Believe me.
And I don't want to hear from that one guy,
her son-in-law, who that is that calls her.
Oh, she's so great.
You're back.
I want to hear some honest answers, you know.
I can see it's going to be.
We had a great Monday this week for some reason.
And then yesterday was a pretty active,
but today's Wednesday.
And they're just not going to play the game day.
And you know what?
I don't care because I feel great today.
You're centered.
I feel outstanding.
I don't know why.
Probably because the gate...
The gate is Toronto.
Probably because the blinds are closed
in the control room.
And I can't see Boy Geary or anything.
No, leave them closed.
I like it much better this way.
You can't feel great because it's Toronto.
Who?
Yeah, those are...
Have a great day, sir.
See you later.
Okay.
We don't talk hockey on this show.
1033 at WIOD.
We got three lines.
Let I'm not going to love beg for calls
or give the numbers today.
Because I feel outstanding.
And of course, say an ad.
Look at Dave.
Nothing.
Zippity-nuda.
Okay.
We love you, too.
I still away.
Go get on the rubber ramp.
Adios.
We got your passport right here, pal.
We have a...
Now what does that mean?
I was going to take the break,
but I'm so fascinated.
I don't want to lose that call on six.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
Is this Neil?
It's a spastic female on the board.
That's what George wrote about you.
What makes you spastic?
Neil, I wanted to tell you.
I always thought you were a ditch bag.
And my boyfriend got me listening to you.
And now I think you're wonderful.
Isn't that something, huh?
Isn't that a myth?
How your boyfriend can kind of change your direction.
Every day of my life.
Yeah.
Up, down, backwards.
Yeah, that's what we heard.
Ugh.
Are you going to be okay?
Um, I think so.
So Neil, how about some dog-
You know that in a former life, she used to be a, uh,
airplane propeller.
What is it?
Wait, I don't have any tickets to give away.
That's what the whole audience is waiting for.
They don't want to waste their call down
because they figure out playing...
I got nothing to give away today.
I'm not buying the audience anymore,
but if I had, am I giving to you and your boyfriend?
How about some food?
I got your food right here, baby.
What do you want?
There she goes.
That's it.
She couldn't handle it, okay?
Well, I was pretty good,
but that's about as brave as she could get for today.
Look at that.
Two calls on that whole board.
Are you ready?
And guess what?
We got this whole thing cute up here.
No, and I Rick Nelson.
Get him out of there.
He's not feeling too good.
He was great.
Nobody saw that either.
Nobody is in anything today.
Okay?
Then bother me.
We got all the Rick and Suds material right here.
How about this one?
Just a second.
Stick around the desert.
Coming soon to a theater near you.
He's been on the road with YouTube for 12 years.
Playing guitar and writing songs.
But he really misses his mom.
And only she gets postcards from the edge.
Dear mom, how are you?
I am fine.
Wish you could write back.
I don't have an interest.
Because I'm wearing the streets.
Have no names.
Move the edge.
A film inspired by the genius of YouTube's
the edge's writings.
It's postcards from the edge.
Dear mom, follow that jerk.
Says you are drunk when you named me.
Cump the edge.
PS.
Busy schedule ahead.
Hook through Christmas.
All is quiet under your day.
Week.
Really, week.
Almost as weak as YouTube's music.
Yeah.
Oh, man.
That's what I've missed about having stand on the year the most.
Okay, stands a great guy.
But his taste in music on a scale of zero.
The best.
It's glorious.
Right?
Yeah.
Randy Marge sucks.
Well, listen, at least he was right to the point.
Okay.
I like people who are directed.
Don't beat around a bush.
Sixth career, the desert.
Oh, man.
Don't give our a man.
Anyway, it's 19 to 11.
A good old W.
There's only one Frank Sinatra.
And now Krapco introduces his latest live album.
Perfectly, Frank.
This one goes out for that crazy Irish broad,
Shine Herald Connor.
She gets stranger every night.
She's taking chances as our anthem fights.
I got the answer.
Send the broad back home.
Maybe she'll change her tune.
Old blue eyes tells it like it is.
Shane, go, shane, go back where you belong.
He's the chairman of the board.
And you will be too when you hear perfectly Frank.
She shapes her heads.
Each morning at eight.
And she don't even think that the star spangled banner
to create.
Stink career, the desert.
And don't give our a man.
If Frank Sinatra, live, live it, and perfectly Frank.
I think the lady will have Krapco.
Today, baby, no one compares to you.
Thank God.
Okay, 1117 at WID.
Can't wait for that Larry King special.
I'm sure that everybody in this audience is on the edge of their seat.
Roger brought me in the thing.
I have no idea what magazine this is from a clipping.
All about Larry King's NBC special.
This Sunday, 28th man, is that going to be great or what?
And Larry says it's a shame that variety shows have gone out of style.
Will a special change all of that?
They ask he says, I don't know.
I've been in the industry 30 years.
And the big secret is nobody knows a damn thing.
I'd never do it that.
That's what he says.
Boy, you've got to miss that or what, huh?
God, you could dance the kazansky right on his schnauz easy.
Miami.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi, I'm a first time caller.
Great.
This is Terandi for a little while last night while I was wandering last on the turn.
She was great, wasn't she?
Oh, tremendous.
Something that you had to be there.
She was talking about a letter that she received air mail from the Bahamas.
A pornographic letter by gentleman who described his body in great detail.
And she was going to save it as evidence.
So I think we need to hear this.
She was going to save it as evidence of what?
I don't know.
She wanted to let the guy know that she was going to save it.
Yeah, she's saving it all right.
Well, I could only take her.
But then I switched over to Jerry Wittner for a moment.
I had a radio accident.
Yeah.
But he was talking about something that maybe you know about.
That one time, a guy ran over him with a truck.
Oh, I wish.
He was saying that it really happened that a guy called him and threatened him.
And then when he was leaving work that night, he was actually run over by a truck.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
I thought so too.
I'd like to see that Camillean, uh,
rugga, his changing color that night.
How can you imagine?
How old is he anyway?
Wittner, 163.
I thought so.
You can hear him.
He talks about all that time he was in the war.
He's talking about the Civil War.
Exactly.
I don't have to tell you which side he was on.
Do I?
Oh, no kidding.
Yeah.
That could have been slave days.
That's why he likes driving that Dixie highway.
Yeah, and is that...
If you catch my drift.
What does he call his motorcycle?
Does he have a name for his motorcycle?
Oh, it's a crotch rocket.
Crotch rocket?
Yeah.
Crotch rocket.
Mm-hmm.
Well, when you get to be that old, I guess it starts sitting in, you know?
That's our guy.
So anyway, I guess Jerry and Randy are neck and neck.
So to speak, nose to nose.
If Jerry was on against Larry King, they'd be nose to nose.
I'm a, I'm a, I don't know.
Love me $50.
Right.
Well, you're going to watch that show Sunday night,
the Larry King Variety show?
I don't think I can...
Man, is that going to be a gut-wrenching show?
Don't eat a big dinner Sunday.
I had enough of him during the Seattle game.
I couldn't take it when he was doing the TV thing.
Oh, that Ted Turner crap, yeah.
Oh, God.
And the sporting events were not bad, but I just couldn't take it.
Yeah, he can do it, man.
If you want to go on a diet of nutritionism,
isn't enough just to watch his show?
Exactly.
It was terminal.
Have a great life.
You too.
Talk about it.
You have two things?
Well, that's a good story.
No, for real.
The first thing, the Citramami cops,
the Latin cops, they're prejudiced against everybody.
Sticker in the dead.
I'm serious.
You see that 7-Eleven file for a bankruptcy yesterday?
Now, doesn't that tell you people at farm stores,
you better govern yourselves accordingly
and see the handwriting on the wall,
like Daniel and the Lions, then, okay?
Let me ask you something here, yet.
That's what happens when you take out those highly profitable playboys
in Penthouse and Hustler and all those other disgusting,
grotesque, wonderful magazines.
You start going in a crapper, okay?
So thank heaven for 7-Eleven going bust.
Nobody deserves it more than they do.
And those right-wing religious nuts from plant city.
Okay, that's my first day.
Neil?
And Chris Sabo.
Do you ever see Chris Sabo Raymond Berry
and Todd from the newsroom together?
No.
What does that tell you?
Go ahead, I'm sorry.
Okay, Neil.
That's my first thing I was upset about my second day.
Oh, what?
The pigs?
They're cops.
They're sitting by me cop, they're Latin cops.
That's a lot of that.
I think that everybody's trying to have it more.
So I don't know, every time he gets pulled over,
he's happy,
majorly.
Yeah.
Okay.
That's the first thing.
My second thing is,
I don't know if you like soccer,
but the United States team has a good soccer.
Do I like chocolate?
Soccer.
Soccer.
You know, with a...
Oh, jeez.
The USA has a good soccer team.
Every time they play.
Soccer is sucks.
Yeah, but don't you respect United?
The little guys running around and showing the whole country.
They keep picking the wall out of bounds
and the referee keeps waving his little hanky.
I wonder why he said hanky in the left pocket, too, by the way.
Have you ever wondered about that?
No, but I was wondering.
Let me tell you.
Walter, they wear the earring in their right ear
and they keep the hanky in their left pocket.
I think that's like a little message.
Why don't they support their own team?
United has a good team.
They may own the way.
They literally the world cup the first time ever.
And every time they play over here,
they're always pulling their stance.
Full of footers for the team, for the other team,
for the Latin team.
Half of the people in America is like half the people.
Yeah.
I mean, maybe you should promote a little bit of soccer.
You don't have to take JRS in 1994.
The world cup's going to be here.
OK, you feel better?
I feel I hope from now to 94,
to every once in a while, I feel some about soccer.
You feel better?
I feel better.
OK.
Thanks for that, buddy.
All right, we're going to start.
Down tonight, what will you do?
Here's the dignity, battle, bitty,
and my city, not as old as that.
But she shirt as printing.
Oh, I tell you, it's quite a bit deep.
Lift the none alone, none, stutter, secure, tick.
She's not texting.
It's the true set up.
Walked in by the door in her brand new get up.
She trips.
She falls.
She tries to call.
I fall in it.
And I can't get up.
Oh, I fall in it.
And I can't get up.
Yo, man, didn't I see you in one time?
I'll make you a nod.
Yo, yo, yo, yo, me and the crew used to polo then blue her.
And now she's not allowed to dance.
They drove her away in an ambulance.
Make it get commercial.
Make a bit fudge.
I fall in it.
And I can't get up.
I fall in it.
And I can't get up.
Calm down, Randy.
1151 at WIOD.
Cheryl was nice enough to bring me George's lighter,
which you'll never get back.
That's it.
And I take him home.
Miami.
Hey, big boy.
How about a big Halloweeny?
OK, we got one for you here.
Let's go to Miami.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
First time calling.
Great.
I was like the many unfortunate souls
to have to listen to Randy last night first.
Boy, see, I told you all these closet people are
swinging that door wide open and flying.
Oh, by the way, can I tell you this?
I'm going to close it about a rumor.
We just heard an incredible radio rumor.
Sir, you'll be the first one to hear right to your ear.
OK.
This Friday, the massive changes at WS News, the talk disappears
and the music starts alleged.
That's the rumor.
That's the opposite.
That's my radio.
Yeah.
Anyway, I think that's what I'll tell
and Montevati in stereo.
Uh-oh.
Doing it together.
The I listened to her last night.
I'm not sure, but I think this was the topic of that evening.
And the market's up four points.
It was exciting.
Which superhero could have sex in which couldn't?
Oh, yeah.
I think that was her top top discussion.
Rubberman was pretty good.
Plastic man.
I think she went and should have been rubberman.
It would have been a lot easier.
I think she found interest in the four superheroes,
the one that was on fire all the time.
She said something like she would like to get a hold of him,
but I wasn't sure that she'd
like to get a hold of anything.
Uh, the same person.
When I see you attacked one of the fire hydrants up on 79th
on the way to work, you have to be able to embarrass him.
I've never been to a King's game.
Any way we can get those tickets on this way, please.
No.
Good try.
Bye-bye.
See, if you ask for the tickets,
that's a guarantee I hang up on you immediately,
because you should know that we don't do that.
The way we do the tickets is we get all the lines filled,
which works every time.
And then when I'm ready to do, I'll get out my little bag.
Let's see if we got my sack in here just a second.
Oh, yeah, we get out our real classy paper bag.
It's got our little eight numbered slips in it.
We pull out a number and it was ever on that line.
It gets the tickets for the Hurricane Panther game.
Now, we'll say this when we give the dolphin tickets
there's a little more hysteria on the line.
George is busy touching around,
so he's not answering this line whoever it is.
Are you there?
Yes, I am.
Do I want to hold?
Yes.
Yes?
Be sure.
OK.
Let's go to a plantation.
Yes.
Here.
Yeah.
Who the hell are you that keeps destroying people's lives
like they're in here?
Where is it?
Where is it?
Who the hell are you?
Sir, Sirius wrote.
That's right.
Alex is no good.
Andy's no good.
Alex is no good.
The fat lady's no good.
Andy's any good.
You know what?
No one's any good but you.
You're good.
For something.
It's 1154.
It's 2.
Open lines and brown.
Look at that.
How much is give those tickets away now?
If there's nobody on 4 and 6, we'll just give them away
to 4 and 6.
It's for free.
We like it.
You know what I'm saying?
OK.
Guess what number it is though?
It's number one.
Hello?
Hello?
Yes.
I like to speak to Neil.
OK.
Hold on everybody.
Yes, ma'am.
Speaking.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, ma'am.
Let me say it again.
Hello?
Hello?
Yes.
I want to speak to Neil.
OK.
Hello?
Yes.
You speak to somebody else?
I'm speaking to you, ma'am.
Right now.
Is this Neil?
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, no, Neil.
How are you?
I'm fine.
You know, this is the first time I'm calling you.
I've been listening to you right along.
Great.
What a great day, huh?
Markets up almost five points.
What more could we want?
Yes.
How are you?
Just terrific.
How are you?
I'm fine.
Thank you.
How you doing?
Well, little idling around.
Yeah, little idling like my car.
And they can come on out.
How come a Spencer never brought my car keys back, did he?
They can come on out.
They can come on out.
Vanjula?
Yeah.
You got a Jewish periket, huh?
Yes, a Jewish car.
Does he eat halava?
OK, he eats everything.
Yeah, I know somebody like that.
Yeah.
Listen, you have a free date in your place.
When you eat for nothing.
Yeah, isn't that great?
That's great.
We need to feed you a bengal over here.
We got something from the...what is it?
Where are you at?
Located.
We're on the 79th Street Causeway, right over from Miami Beach.
Oh, right on the causeway.
Yeah, on the causeway.
I'll be coming and see you at...
I like a...
Free food?
A eggplant?
A eggplant.
Oh, that's my favorite.
Oh, that's great.
Too bad it's all gone.
We invite you to come by.
Oh, yes.
Well, you have that every day?
No, when we feel like it.
We kind of vary our thing, you know?
Uh-huh.
You're terrific, guys.
One day we eat eggplant.
The next day we eat something else.
I love you.
Well, that's great.
I hope you and Benji have a wonderful life together.
Oh, yeah.
That's the only one I have in my life.
Well, thank God.
Just like my dog.
I love you.
Yeah, me and my dogs.
That's all I got.
I just go home and lock that door and I talk to those dogs.
You have a woman.
Oh, I have a woman?
A woman, a wife?
A wife?
Yeah.
Boy, that would be shocking.
Those wouldn't it.
Why, you don't care for any wife.
I don't care for any wife or even a husband.
You have a girlfriend.
Lots of them.
Well, I need a nice boy.
Tom and Jerry and Joe.
What is it?
I can find a nice boyfriend like you.
A nice boyfriend like me, yeah.
Yeah.
How to find.
Yeah, they sure are.
Tell me about it.
Yeah.
You know what they say?
A good man is hard to find.
A hard man is even good or to find.
Well, listen, you have a great day and you have been here.
You have good kids on the beak for me.
I'll be going down to Subbie Nice.
Yeah.
I'm bringing that bench over down.
Okay.
Well, we'll be looking for you.
You in the bird.
Yeah.
Okay.
Have a great day.
Wow.
1213 at W.I.D.
So those of you who wanted the tickets, guess what?
You lucked out.
I'm going to put that right back in the sack.
That number and shake them up again.
But she was a very nice lady.
She don't want no tickets.
She just wanted to talk about Benji and have a nice time.
And she was great.
So after the break, we'll do the thing with the tickets again.
I told you we could milk this for about another hour.
Trust me.
Right?
You bet.
1226 at W.I.D.
As far as that old fart that called about Randy Martin
and about my destroying her life, isn't it interesting?
She came in here like a vulture, like a barracuda
after Stan Major's job, right?
Is Stan here anymore?
I don't hear this guy fetching about poor Stan
who's got a family to raise and feed over there in plantation
who's dying over there, dying on the vine,
desperate for work, starving to death.
And here we got this barracuda with her hair up like a, you know,
in a thing, in a bun, in a bun on the run.
And she's on there tonight.
You could put her talent in a thimble and have room for all of mosquitoes
inside floor to left over, okay?
I don't hear it.
I can't handle those people who come in here like vultures
and stand over your shoulder and wait to get somebody else's job.
Oh, geez, I ain't healed her here.
Excuse me, Rick.
Talk 27 at WIOD, Fort Lauderdale.
I just call it tell you I didn't listen to Randy last night.
Thank God, that's why you sound like you're in a good mood today.
Jesus.
Why do these people make these mistakes over and over again?
They all had these radio accidents.
Everyone is, that's too much of bigger numbers than you.
Everyone who listens to you, call it listen to her.
Number two thirds.
Oh, that's good.
You've got a point six.
Point six?
Special.
So anyway.
So anyway.
I don't want to take it to you there.
Good.
So can I have?
No.
We just gave him away.
So?
We got something for you.
You know what it is?
Special.
Dial tone.
1227 and...
9 and WIOD.
Let's go to Coral Springs.
Good afternoon, Mr. Skinny.
How you doing?
Okay.
Listen, I'm sharing the road today with a celebrity.
You're sharing?
I was sharing.
I was driving down to Turnpike at the Joe Robbie Stadium.
Coming up to the toilet.
How long you been talking like this?
What's that?
You've seen Jackie Mason lately?
Why you're talking like this?
Oh, I don't know.
Okay.
I rolled up next to you in Pluto Horn,
but you made sure you looked straight ahead.
Oh, yeah.
Yes, I...
Why waved to you, sir?
Oh, you did?
Yeah, I said you're number one.
I was in that yellow...
Yellow...
B there.
The one?
Yellow cab.
St. Career, the desert.
Don't give out that.
I thought that was pretty good time in the audience.
I saw you at the Joe Robbie Stadium.
And at the pole booth.
How old the same time?
People are starting to talk.
I thought that was incredible.
It was great.
Have a good one, Dale.
I'm the same to you.
Oh, man.
It's almost empty.
The door.
And from where I sit, you can look out in a hallway where the mailboxes are.
And Mr. Executive is out there with his suspenders.
Oh, geez.
Marvin with suspenders.
Man, you talk about a complete sellout.
This guy...
He used to be just like a regular one of the guys.
Okay, he used to come in late every day.
He used to be just a general pin in the ass.
He had no attention to anything.
Now he's a superstar with suspenders.
Hey, Marvin.
I want to tell you something.
Only assholes wear suspenders.
Okay?
And if you don't believe me, go into our programming office right now.
Take a look at our illustrious PD.
Suspenders.
Man, they went out with high-button shoes.
Are you kidding me?
Unbelievable.
He's in there dressed up like Lord Foughtler, right?
Would suspenders like Mr. Executive?
Forget one, yeah.
If I should, we bet.
Why should anybody spend millions and millions and millions of dollars to build a new stadium?
Well, we already have one in a great location when they put in the retractable seats.
It's going to be tremendous.
Okay, granted.
That's a point.
However, Neil, have you ever sat in the Joe Robbie's bands?
Not in the air-conditioned press box on your ass?
Yes, I have.
I sat in the first game.
You know how unbearingly hot it is there?
Well, let me ask you this, my psychotic friend.
Baseball, what if they played almost all night games?
Oh, is that right?
Yeah, that's what a lot of teams do.
They play night games like in Texas.
Play night games on Lake LaSerne and bike crack rocks on the way out of the stadium?
Oh, you know, it was really rough getting out there.
Thursday night, I thought it was going to have to be moded by 40 crack dealers stopping the car.
Sir, you're just a negative jerk.
And here's this one for life, W-L-Y-Death.
Man, you're a part of the select segment of the South Florida population that's been chosen to participate in a research project on radio leasinging.
Your opinion is important and will help shape the type of programming that's offered to the South Florida radio audience.
Your assigned station is W-L-Y-F at 101.5.
Please listen for at least an hour and then complete the opinion card.
If you can't listen at least in this week, be sure to note the week you were able to lease in.
Oh, man, who the hell are they killing?
What a bunch of crap, okay?
152 at W-L-Y-O-D.
I understand also the coast.
They spent millions and billions of dollars.
They sent this expensive mail-around three colors with all this crap about what do you like and what are your three-fraver records and this Johnny Darker Slob and all this other crap.
And they got the TV spot that's on in the Joe Robbie Stadium eight million times a game and it's on during the news at least 400 times the newscast every year station may have spent billions of dollars.
It's unbelievable.
What do we get over here? We get a billboard with 16 ugly teeth like chicklets. That's what we get.
And we're still kicking ass.
Mobile.
Hey, my green girlfriend. How are you, man?
Oh, my God.
Remember me?
How are you doing, Desi?
Good. What's happening?
We're doing it.
You know, my name is Faddle right here and it looks like a Joe Corroyo.
Corroyo is having a meeting with the sheriff Navarro because the sheriff he carried a little boys and girls here in Broward and then he got rid of all the rappers.
Now he wants to carry a little boy to the community.
So he's asking for Joe Corroyo.
What? Are you nobody told him?
He's those coffee animals.
Yeah.
Those coffee?
Okay, you break it up, palsy.
Audio is sastiluago.
Astamanyana.
Oh, look at that.
Look at this.
Woo!
Suspenders at all with a tie.
With his came art suit.
Unbelievable.
He went shopping with Wayne Arnold for clothes today.
Oh, God.
So when a guy with a suit and suspenders comes up to you and wants to stick 14 watermelons in your pants, you'll know who it is.
Unreal. I can't believe this guy.
He's consorting with the management now.
Now he wants to be one of those.
He's been an underling long amount.
Now he wants to be one of those management types.
He wants to be Mr. Hachach.
I pretty soon will have his own orifice.
Miami.
If I had this ability, I'd kick your ass down your throat and sell your teeth.
Okay.
Here's a mobile on the Starline.
How you doing?
Great.
Listen, there's a bunch of cops on motorcycle on 595.
And I was just driving down 95 and this asshole coming off.
Can you play him something?
What?
Can you play him something?
You have, we had time when we'd play him something, okay?
Have a great life.
We don't have time to play that now.
Okay, sir.
The show is almost over.
