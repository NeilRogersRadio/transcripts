and it's like entertainment oh yeah
they had on an hour you can't refuse and it was fantastic all kinds of
in-depth interviews with on the set and uh... with all the stars
uh... i won't mention the name of the world don't do that we don't want to give people
upset no but uh... if they if they play it again which i'm sure they play those things
usually a hundred times it's fantastic great in-depth interviews about this and
possibly a four and all kinds of things
it really really interesting i thought about you when i was watching
i was very upset reading those stupid uh... soot intellectual reviews in a paper
yesterday your end stuff and they give their top ten lists and we got number nine
or ten or something good fellows i'm sorry like i said it was a very good movie
but it is it's not even the same league with any of the three godfather so i don't
uh... i don't know what the hell it's all about don't let them get on to the
you know top ten this tell me somebody already got under the skin of the kid in good
fellows i'll tell you that one man he got more zits in about five seconds no not Tommy
so that uh... whatever his name with Jimmy yeah the techie guy yeah
and listen no he got it also what
what about the zits that this guy had up get with it wake up and get the flowers
picture i got out on that yearbook uh... nil did you see family Smith on the sidelines of the
fsu uh... pens they came no i didn't i didn't watch the game
he was running up and down the sidelines it would jump on top of boudon it was it
but he did run pretty good did i think he ran for hundred yards at the end
uh... he's not a game is great on the sidelines
i have to laugh at these people they made a player the game to give the game ball
and he's talking did you hear him on our sports this morning when i'm driving in i just
i quite a mess that is showing a lot of larias about uh... oh you know anybody says
he's not a good player you don't know what they're talking about and he thinks he's
pathetic you know i was watching the uh... Atlanta
a Dallas game the other day
and boy i'll tell you that micro seer did he and you know if you're gonna try to tell me
Atlanta's got a great offensive line and that's why he runs like that there's no way they think
that Falcons are pathetic everybody knows that and that guy was incredible yesterday
micro zero i mean almost every team in the league has got a tremendous breakaway
powerful runner who just uh... almost unstoppable like christian a quay by the way for
a Kansas city that we're gonna have to stop on Saturday tremendous runner
and sammy you know he has a couple of good games against some really craft defenses
the crappy teams and right away that's supposed to make up for all the rest i don't
want to sound like i'm uh... wine and cuz we had a great year but he stinks
but by the way in the herald today they have the greatest
or i'm dolphin with the silver anniversary team
oh sammy must be on that uh... he doesn't fall in there
oh what's the price?
most of marz pony nayson and jim kick make it in running back
uh... and you get zonka nodding ham and boulos at fullback
but we still have never in the history of the franchise they have never had
are really great running back and you know zonka's in a hall of fame and all of
that but he was a you know the way he used to run three yards in a cloud of dust
and carry people on his back but he wasn't a
he wasn't a classic
fullback type runner like a jim brown or a water paton or a gale sares or
uh... very standards any of these people you know he was just a bowl
what's the same world of paton
no wonder patons another one
anyway we should have been here and uh...
okay by thanks a lot
leeway kelly we can go on forever
anyway ten thirty six at w i d we have one open line and day one and brown one on
the starline where fumbling our way along it's going to be a pretty a
gruesome day we don't care we're ready for we can handle anything
we can handle this music
you know
what i'll tell you car mine you are brutal anyway let's do a little uh... just a
little piece of business here will be right back
tonight on the movie of the week
just another day in small town america
ob i've got fresh cherry pie i left it to cool on the window
and then it happened
it's gone
something snapped in the old girl's brain what kind of scum would do this
now she's killer bee
why there ain't bane white gober that a cherry stain on your cover all
now just little trains mason flu
she's a cold blooded killer insensible shoes
cheese killer bee
now lord i've got to ask you one question
did you cut my pie into six pieces or only five
i have to
miss me be
miss me be
how
matter than a horned
even matter beneath the hammers
now i pay
we got place around it
you know
i call
he just may be
don't be skillet
right after Charles manson in charge tonight on the movie of the week
i heard she made a canola could be wrong
ten forty one at w.i.o.d my amy beach
yes
yes sir
yes i'd like to clarify something if you would for me please sir
i know that the
dolphins have the home for advantage against cancer city right
the home field advantage yeah
okay now if we win that game there's no way that we can have the home field advantage
a second game is right
no way right
no because the buffalo
buffalo
and it just that somebody told me that they know no chance buffalo and the radars
have got the home field advantage for the second game
because they drew by an average ground
right they have better word one and one they have equal one and also i can put that with the vision
jaykin
well thank you very much you bet
anyway all i know that isn't correct is it that's not now how come fat rich had
two now i'm confused because he had tickets for two games
ten
ten
that now confused i'm totally lost
well i see some other words like if we wind up playing
anybody other than
buffalo or the radars in a conference championship came and if he conference
championship came that would be the game that he's got the other ticket for right that would be the other home game
because we'd have the better record
am i right?
who knows
anyway let's take him one at a time we have an open line indeed seven five one one and
brown or five two four let's go to Jupiter
hello Neil
yes sir
how you doing?
great
hey on that song on that sound track that you have a movie don't want to give the name to
yeah
i was i just got back from Pittsburgh and i was driving through north carolina got a newspaper
and they were talking that
from the movie that Francis Ford had shown to the previewers and stuff
yeah
they really bond his daughter
so he went and reedited
and cut out all the parts where we mainly just her
her part was smaller than is initially intended
thank god for that
yeah really
really
but so that could be where that song came from
and also that song
what do i don't understand what does the song got to do with her part
always just to probably the background to one of her scenes
oh i see
no i'm looking for the song where
or where her song pulls out the guitar
right exactly that's one of the most poignant parts in a whole movie and he's singing
in it in italian
yeah
the godfather theme and he's sticking back to apalonia and his earlier days in Sicily
and when he was hiding and all
that that's one of the highlights in movie it is not on the soundtrack so
so far the soundtrack i give no stars i mean it's really a piece of crap
i thought it was a good movie i mean i like when they had the opera and they were playing
out the scenes of the opera and then they were doing all their
listen i'm as tired of all these critics and all these experts and all these mavens
and these pseudo intellectuals
i know a good movie when i see one
in fact there was another list of the worst movies yesterday
and they had my blue heaven in there
now i'm gonna touch did you see it
uh... yeah
with steve martin
i thought when you started talking about it
then you thought it was bad
i thought it was pretty good
i thought it was outstanding
it was too long i'll grant the last half hour drag
and it said idiotic
well eh... who name a movie that steve martin was ever in that isn't idiotic
but it was funny as hell i thought it was great
and she listed in the sunset on one of the ten worst movies of the year yesterday
these people out of the shot they had to line them all up and shoot them
and let people go out and make their own choices
instead of listening to all these experts
i said that's it i don't worry about the experts
i mean in this town what they think funny is Dave Barry is funny
as i was on yesterday morning what a way to wake up on a sunny morning
my call putty has got Carl Hyerson who's a great writer but a boring guest
and Dave Barry who the only thing he ever said
the funny in his life was
where is Larry King's check?
i mean the game had his not funny
he's pathetic
well this is also a time of think family's mess is a great way to go
exactly well just read Dave Joseph's column on the sunset this morning about the fans at the game that should tell you
everything you need to know about this town
have a great new year
like that school teacher
that's another reason i didn't go yesterday
all i need to do is see that school teacher
see it's one thing to be enthusiastic
but be enthusiastic at the right time
not just bouncing
and another thing you know the wave went out with high button shoes
okay the only place they still do the wave is in Atlanta
and the only reason they do it there is because the braves are so bad
that at least it gives them something to do and they ignore the game
okay all of a sudden Miami found the wave
forget it
and even when the place starts again
they're still doing the wave and the aromas are all up in front of your face
you're trying to see the play
i mean grow up already
whatever they said about the fans at the dolphin games
absolutely right man there's there's a few thousand of them who know football
who are there to enjoy the game and get excited at the right moments
and root for the team
and arrest them and they don't know what the hell are stories
they're just there in la la land
i'll never understand what
and especially when it cost that much money
to go there and just wander around
and the kids are running back and forth
and the parents are schlepping back and forth
and back to the concession stand
not at half time or not at times when it would be appropriate
but like it can be the most exciting part of the game
and they're getting up and running in front of you
up and down the aisle and off to who knows where
i don't understand people at all
it's like a social gathering place
instead of going because you're into the sport
into the team and you want to see a great game
or not as a case may be
the weather sure is nice in it
what a day today huh it's going to be 83
84 maybe even higher
paradise
we need neutron bombs in his town
get rid of the people leave the buildings
and leave the palm trees and the weather
and the gators and all his other crap
not the gators that was the wrong choice of words
1047 at w-i-o-d
and how to take that Joe Paturno
you slime ball
i'm so sick of Joe Paturno
man am i sick of him
thank god they got beat
and they got a bunch of sissy uniforms
anyway Penn State don't they they're pathetic
they look like a high school team
even piper high could beat them
wobel and poor lauderdale
how you doing good how are you
i'm doing great
if you i got a pretty much a breakdown of the playoffs
if you want me to tell you how my amic can have two home games
okay the only way it can happen
which is possible is for you
then to make it to the AFC championship against my amic
right because we have a better record
well because they're a wildcard team
well we're a wildcard team too
right with with a better record
but we also have a much better record than the bangles
but they're a division winner
so even if the bangles
if the bangles make it
you know but the only way it happens is if you've been beat since an adi
and my amy beats Kansas City
what happens is my amy goes to Buffalo
and uh... you can go to Los Angeles
so the only way it's going to happen is if my amy
my amy all have to go to Buffalo
and beat Buffalo
which is not going to happen
pretty remote
well who knows i'd love to see it happen but uh...
uh... who knows man you never know what's going to happen to you
did you see that i realized yesterday this game was meaning
did you see their performance against the redskins
and who is this kid they brought in this ten year old kid is quarterback
oh man i thought it was our guild broot
yeah it uh...
with a helmet on he looked the same
yeah i'll tell you one thing wild build kody for hewston last night play the hell of a game
you know that was ridiculous man the guy was like a superstar
i couldn't believe it
and i'll tell you who else played a damn good game
was this kid for a sandy eagle what is his name
oh uh... freeze
freeze yeah like he must be related to gene freeze
who used to play for the pirates
freeze who the hell is it all of a sudden he comes in there damn near one the game
give them a battle royal yesterday
i'll tell you i was really rooting against the raiders
i wasn't
it would have brought the raiders here
well who the hell wants that
who the hell wants that
i'd rather play a team that's got a quarterback
who's got pins in his hand who can't even uh...
did you see that game where they kicked the crap out of the bears on Saturday
did you see his hand on the ball
and he kept handing off the ball and every time he had off the ball
or running back with smack the ball and it was hand as he was taking away and he'd be stay there just holding his hand
and screaming and pain
it was incredible you know
i was at my folks house and i was watching the game with my mother
and she was like couldn't watch
and when they showed the picture of his hand on tv
with the pins coming out the side
and it looked like it looked like it where it's easier here
it was it it was gross man i thought i was going to puke
yeah but they had a rough time because he kept slicing the ball out they had to keep uh... bringing a new one in
really and boy speaking i bring a new one in mic tom zack you talk about guys who have lost it
mic tom zack is the steep blast of football he just totally has lost it
he's absolutely inept and then once in a while when he would hit the receiver they would just drop it
like in disdain as if to say hey you're so bad we're going to show you i mean if it just like uh... hold it and drop it
look at him like screw you mic
yeah but the black was a decent picture of tom zack was never a decent quarter
i died disagree with you when uh... what's his name when old uh... number of
brain there used to it mcman used to get injured all the time he came in a few
time for it for a fact one season he played pretty well yeah well he was the underdog but when he came in as
the starter for getting yeah he was hopeless
but anyway have a happy new year kneel and you gonna be on tomorrow

well that's right does that start around midnight tonight the cover starts

bull tomorrow cuz that's what new year's eve is ladies and gentlemen and we got a blue moon and

it's been a hundred different restaurants in last five years and this play three months tops
i mean how is it that people go into big huge expensive buildings pay fortune some money

two wasn't well we could get used to that listen to that this we'll really see what kind of
dolphins we have on the first playoff game in robby stadium they could have filled that blockbuster
bowl twice down here i know what we'll see what traffic on the turnpike friday night it looked like
the end of the world looked like they were dropping nuclear weapons and everybody was trying to
evacuate it looked like it was thought that joe robby another part of the country didn't right
so let's see what these fans are like we're finally they get in the playoff they get
i i send section one forty two i got a bird's eye view of the whole stadium on the other side
and it's a shame to see them in the empty seat you bet it's depressing i mean what do they want
them to do be thirteen and three and they'll come out fifteen and one exactly well we'll find out
this uh... weekend we okay i have a good holiday you too yeah wonder what the situation is going to
be up in our sky box you have any idea of course you don't care George because you have about
a much interest in football as i do in um... sockered anyway we got a little mail here i see some more
mail to add to our total if you join us late friday we went over the hundred thousand dollar mark
and our driver comellus house all i know what i wanted to say all boy i could really get started
but it's new years of day
what is this herb title men in coconut creek
from the big corporation there's a big box i wonder if this is pens
was it's either pens are can only
if it's pens would not be great boy pens are just everywhere you go in offices
radio stations in my house no matter how many pens i go out and buy
they just disappear i think the dogs are eating
or somebody
anybody would come on the air and say that the homeless are bums
and just use that as a blanket statement for his refusal
to have any interest or don't i mean i mean i don't know not everybody uh... is
interested in the same charities i understand that not everybody supports the
same causes and then to talk about stepping over the bodies during the commercial
break at fifty five when i left here on friday
and i punched over to you know who
and somebody with the same guy who was trouble making called here making trouble
was calling over there and i think that's basically what they're going to have
is all the old yenta is back in fourth over that place
and uh... start up this thing about the wife steve didn't give any money to
comillus house and the challenge of this net and how i said he was trying to
exploit it and on the one hand he said oh well he made the challenge and he would
have forgiven the thousand and a senate now and then on the other hand he said not
a charity cares about he cares about kids and if it was good in other words there
are no homeless children and about how when he lived in the york used to step over
to homeless in the drug addicts and bums and winos uh... anybody would just make
that kind of a statement is such a jackass it's pathetic and i mean unless you
don't read anything other than the national inquirer
anybody knows that we have just thousands and thousands of homeless mothers with
little children teenagers all kinds of uh... kids which i guess is his interest
but the thing that i'm curious about talk about hypocrisy if you're not
interested in the charity to begin with why would you make a challenge to give a
thousand dollars that's what i don't understand
unless you were doing it for ego oh excuse me twenty eight past eleven let me get
this box open okay well we take our next call see there might be something
good in them or maybe you just might
do that
do
do
do
do

step past caller
but let me tell you where's the time going it was just last year that dicky farrell
brought in the new year for w i o d and he was talking about
what an impact he was gonna have and how long could he last after the new year in
the old about two months six minutes six minutes that's it and then you had
joey randles and rady martin in the list
they the endless loop list goes on and on hopefully night
nineteen ninety one we don't have to listen to that that joey randles at a
randie martins but i sure hope ang does real great at night but it would be
uh wonderful like i said the other day if he's ever on that would help a lot
yeah yeah you want the same thing to him they did to stand they did the
they just they have taken from like eight o'clock till midnight on his radio station
and they just write it off i don't know what they're all they're thinking about
they give nobody a chance in there and as much as i hope you and basketball
develops and get some support i mean a number of people listening to those games
you could put in this studio and have lots of space left over believe me i don't
know what these people are thinking about right i agree with you i want to
percent about that i mean how the hell is the guy going to ever make an impact if he's never on
right what's the thousand dollar challenge you were talking about with Steve came
we don't have any challenge okay
Rick and suds put up five hundred bucks which is one of the biggest donations for
Camilo souse was very generous of them and mr. vgo as usual has a big mouth and nothing to back it up
right absolutely have a great holiday 1133 at wiod we have an open line in brown
at five two four let's go to coral springs again i need all happy new year to you and the
same to you you know i've been listening to your show on and off but i haven't wanted to
listen too much because i haven't seen godfather three and i don't want to hear the whole
you haven't seen it yet now i know you must be the only one left
what am i the only one left i think so well that'll be great and i have a theater to myself
you can have a command performance you mentioned that al martino's in it is he singing again
a roll out here i'm ready with this song in the rain i'm trying to sing you're so bad that he has a
song you sing especially for al patino and al walks out of the room when he starts saying goes
into the kitchen what do they have another wedding and has a gastric attack now they're having a big
party because uh uh uh michael corleone is being honored by the uh community because he just gave
a hundred million dollars to the vatican just a little donation a hundred million speaking of that
did you read the fort laurel news today i thought it was the most stupid column i have ever read in
my life you're talking about the how it ties in with the history yeah the vatican storyline as
really try to make it sound like oh well it's just that we all know it just make believe in the
guide the people in the church uh say it's just a fiction of course and who the hell are they
kidding exactly you know these people in the media are so terrified of organized religion that
it's really uh it's it's embarrassing just pathetic oh i'm really looking forward to see it and i
also read those uh movies that they now may for the top ten people are quite appalled all the pseudo
intellectuals get together and uh isn't it interesting that the ones that they like are not the
ones that the public supports most of the time exactly what i was going to say it's the public
just goes and eros it to take a box and they have they're off the wall with these things right
Edward ciz are hands and all the i haven't seen it but i'm not going to ridiculous it looks
obviously but i noticed you don't have a lot of women calling it no not the last a couple of
weeks they're all busy uh making excuses or something well i'm hoping next weekend where did you go
maybe maybe once when they get their rid of their husbands and they get them all back to work or
or wherever they're they belong maybe then they'll have some time you know there's something to that
yeah there's certainly yes but where did you go see it the godfather uh the second time
when i actually enjoyed it was the amc eight which is on the corner of pine island and stay
road eighty four it's a magnificent theater big good sound big screen excellent honor where you
mean and the whole crowd was under the age of a hundred it was great oh well that's that's a
plus two because they can really start talking yeah that's right what did he say
or he said or what's gonna happen right that's even better yeah i've gotten excited i don't even like
to go to the movies anymore i want to rent it but i don't want to rent that one now you got to go
