You got all these people out of position. You still don't have a catcher and it's a joke.
You got some guys who can hit the ball. There's no question about that.
But baseball has got to be more than one dimensional. And you got some great pitching too.
But again, when they pitch a great game and you don't score any runs and the guys are throwing a ball all over the place
and Jeffries is making 80 years, you can't win games that way.
Some of those holes have been caused by injuries, but they still have the best talent and they should win.
Well, I mean, everybody's got injuries. My god, Tuckmith missed almost the entire season for the Cup.
He's one of our top two or three pictures. But that's not an excuse. I mean, we suck this year, okay? And I admit it.
The pirates can definitely be repaid next week when they go to Shade Stadium and playing Monts-Free-All next, which has beat up on them.
Eight out of 12 times. That is correct. Monts-Free-All is beating.
So, Monts-Free-All is beating.
So, Monts-Free-All is beating.
So, Monts-Free-All is beating.
I think it's a match, if the match would have swept the three games series that just been included.
I think we'd have like, we would probably need 30 extra phone lines for all the match fans calling and gloating and being obnoxious.
And I'm not saying you're obnoxious, but I mean a lot of them are. And they're going nuts.
Would you agree with me or not?
I would, but that leads me to my next point.
Okay.
I would think that there's a lot more match fans listening to your show than there are pirate fans, co-pans and meta-haters put together.
Which seems to me as a little self-defeating as far as you're attitude on that team.
So, I'm not going to just pander. I'm not going to develop my attitude because it's like religion.
Most of the people in this audience, and in any audience I've had over the years, belong to some part of organized religion.
And I still think it's the greatest nightmare in the history of mankind, because there's more grief and more hate and more anything than any other cause in the history of the human race.
I'm not going to stop saying that just to pander because people don't want to hear that or they don't agree with it.
I don't care. I'm just giving my opinion.
Well, my thing, I love listening to your show, but I must admit there are times where I have no choice but to listen to that crap on FM because I just can't handle somebody putting down the meth one and start to...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. In other words, you are so...
I mean, look, I am a cub fan. You know how I feel about baseball. I love baseball.
I even watched the cub game last night, which tells you a lot.
But I'm going to tell you something. It's just a game. I mean, I love...
Like, just like I used to love the pirate years ago.
But it's just a game. You have to somewhere along the line, draw the line.
You can't turn it off because you can't handle somebody who says you're a team of sucks or they don't like them. It's a team. It's a game. It's fun.
A leg. It's business.
Basically, I think that maybe it might have something to do with the fact that the games all on QAM are in direct competition with WI.
Oh, gee. Like I really talk up, I really talk up the Yankee broadcast, right?
That's what I'm saying. You know, BIOB's got a bunch of crap on it, and they can't compete with the Med broadcast on QAM.
Hey, listen, it was up to me. I'd much rather have the Med games on IOD because obviously they're going to get a much bigger audience.
Whether I like them or not, I'm not arguing with that. But I'm not telling you by the end of the meds because we carry the Yankee games.
What the hell is that guy to do with it?
Well, I just wish that I can't do it.
Can't do it.
No, but can't you accept the fact that there are people who don't like the meds?
I mean, does that make me a bad guy? It's just for it.
It's a bad guy.
You hate about them.
Everything.
Most of it comes from their fans and you, you're not obnoxious like a lot of the others, but the fact that you just, you can't spend or you can't yield at all.
It's like, if we don't suck up to the meds because there are a lot of New York people out there and a lot of meds fans, then I'm doing the wrong thing.
I don't like the meds.
Okay, I just don't like them.
I mean, you're a sports fan. You know that there are certain players. Can you name me a player in baseball that you hate?
I hate?
Right.
Bobby, that bond guy there.
Okay, very bad.
All right, see now that took you like two seconds. All right?
That's the nature of sports.
But you keep it in perspective. Like I hated Pete Rose. I hate a bunch of players because they always kill the cubs.
Or I hate people because they don't like their attitude. Like him, someone I don't hate can suck up.
But I sure don't like him because he's a smart, me guy. I just don't like him.
But it's a sport. You got to keep it in perspective.
All right.
Don't feel better next week.
Hey, listen, we agree on the hurricanes in the Donalds and hopefully they're both going to kick some butt this week.
Let's hope so.
All right.
Okay.
1147.
Well, I'm Jesus.
That was a very traumatic experience, but I think he came out okay.
Did it?
12 minutes still.
No, that's WIOG.
I don't like them.
I see them.
And you know, after after Dady Johnson left and then they were like having this big research and it was obvious the cubs are going nowhere.
We're just trying to stay in fourth place.
And I said for a while, I said, glad.
You know, I'm kind of an umbrella. Don't hate him as much as I did before.
And then when I turned on the pirate game, not last night, but two nights ago, the first game of the double header, when Dan Smith pitched the one hitter, which I hate to keep bringing up again.
And Viola, I how he squeezed his way through there.
I mean, the pirate sports like the cubs, every inning that the bass is loaded to him and I'm they couldn't score anyone.
And at that point, I said to myself, hey, guess what? I do hate to mess.
I mean, like poison.
But is it only me?
Why is it that everywhere the next place, every time strawberry comes up to bed, the crowds are...
Why does that happen? It's because they like him because they like the sound of his name because they hate him like poison.
Like arsonist.
But he's all right.
It's 11 till noon. We'll be right back.
1151 at WIOD Miami. Hello.
And Neil, how could anyone like to mess with a guy like that?
No wonder they so many people hate him.
Well, it's just, I mean, such an agonizing thing just to have him make the slightest little concession.
I, look, I could bore everybody by going into the tail because I'm really a very not so baseball fan.
And like last night in the med game, in the inning when the pirates were breaking the game open,
situation in the pirate's got to run around first.
A guy gets a bass hit to right field.
I think what Jeff King was on first.
He goes to third. They got no chance.
No chance to get to run over third.
Strawberry over throws the cutoff guy throws the third and they hit her winds up at second base.
Okay, and eventually both runs wide up scoring.
The fundamental unsoundness of that ball club is so glaring.
It just stares you in the face and you say that.
Oh, jeez.
I don't understand it.
I mean, if somebody says to me that like Dwight Smith is an unsound ball player and makes stupid throws
and gets picked off, fazing, I'm not going to argue with that because it's true.
Right.
Even if I'm a cup fan, I can handle that.
We got a lot of holes, okay?
Absolutely. Anyway, I want to talk about your favorite, your hometown, next door neighbor station.
Yes, sir.
Anyway, it seems like they're turning the corner on their format.
They're toning it down.
I don't know if anyone mentioned this earlier, but last night they said they had a tape
of actually someone getting killed.
Did you hear about that?
No.
Yeah.
Was it enough tape?
Yeah, exactly.
They showed it and they said, okay, we're going to show this tape and they had some warm-in with the gun and a guy tied to a tree.
No.
And this gets out.
Come on.
No, absolutely.
I'm not joking.
They had a guy tied to a tree and they said, we're going to show you this tape.
And right up until the second, where she was going to pull the trigger, they squeezed, framed, and stopped it.
They said, okay, we're not going to show anymore because this might be too much for you to handle.
And now, it's time for our long-distance dedication.
It's from Sally Fitz.
Who wants to hear?
Good vibrations.
Can you believe it?
Yeah.
I believe anything.
I mean, it's unbelievable.
With Rick Sanchez bringing from ear to ear when they came back, was he like chorling and saying a lot of like semi-literate thing?
Oh, yeah.
It's like, yeah, right.
Shaking their head up and down, going unbelievable.
Don't you think she would have been good in the exercise?
She could have done better than Linda Blair.
She could have spun around like about 180 miles an hour.
But, you know, now they're stupid and showing enough tapes on the news.
I mean, how much lower can you get?
Well, I'll listen.
If anybody can find a way to do it, I have full confidence.
Yeah.
I got one more story for you about the Brownshire.
Some friends of mine came down to visit me and they were staying up in Port Lauderdale.
And they said, hey, we want to go down this strip.
We haven't been here six or seven years.
We heard, you know, they remember it from six or seven years ago.
This was on a Saturday night.
The place was completely empty to rule a Berlin ball down A1A.
Yeah.
Anyway, we're driving down there and they have a blockade on A1A.
And they pull us over and they shine the flashlight in the car.
And I said, hey, what's the problem?
They said, hey, we're searching all the cars.
We're looking for open containers of beer.
You bet.
You bet.
We're looking for open containers of cooling, okay?
Because it could be a Jim Jones plot.
It could be Guyana revisited.
Well, I mean, they were saying, hey, we don't remember Port Lauderdale being like this.
We're remember it's a front time.
And then my friends said something to this woman, TIG, up there.
And then we started to say, hey, why are you happy?
If we're not doing anything, hey, we're just doing our job.
We want to protect the beach and protect every one of these dogs.
Okay. You're really struck a raw nerve, you know why?
Because earlier I was talking about the show that Rick and Sudden said yesterday
and all these idiots calling in with opinions about who did the murders.
And the things that we can do something about or should do something about,
like the repression and the way they've destroyed Port Lauderdale in almost dollar-browered counties.
You know, you're making a comment.
Get a couple of people a bellyache about it.
But most people just accept it.
Okay. Instead of going out and just, they ought to be marching in the streets.
They ought to be recalling, sure of Nick, they ought to be recalling Bob Cox.
They ought to be going nuts in Port Lauderdale.
They've destroyed a beautiful community.
They've destroyed the beach.
He didn't like the young people.
They didn't like the old people because they were spreading their prune juice on the street when they were crossing.
Nobody cares.
So in other words, people will shoot off a big mouth and have a big opinion on things that they have nothing to do with
that doesn't really affect their life that they can do nothing about.
But on things like what you're talking about, they just hit back like a bunch of sheep and they let it go on.
That's what makes me sick about these.
It's been years since I've been up there and I'm not going to go back up there again.
Who the hell would?
I mean, I mean, you wonder why everyone's going to South Beach.
And I mean, I know you say South Beach South.
No, hey, listen, that's where that's the only place there's any life left in this town.
You know, at least the police down there don't have to be.
I mean, there are new day-athers on the beach.
You can go drink a beer and no one's going to bother.
I mean, you go, you go drive down A1A and it's like the hassle and then we were driving away in this female pig when my friend sets up to her.
She gave him the number one sign.
The pig did?
Yeah.
He unbelievable.
You ever heard of such a thing?
Well, in poor Lauderdale, nothing would surprise me.
Okay.
I wouldn't even surprise the number two with both hands.
Yeah, well, I don't know.
You could try for you to get the hell out of Broward.
Yes, sir.
I'm moving to Miami Beach for about a week, like I always do.
Okay.
Have a great weekend.
Okay.
Don't make them a mistake again.
I'm never going back.
I'm never going north to the border.
Well, you've got a lot of companies.
See you.
Okay.
1156 and WIOD.
We have an open line.
Well, let's all call in.
I think the Butler did it.
I think the Maiden.
And I think that little midget with green ears did it.
I mean, see that's human nature.
People shoot off a big mouth because they like the gossip and they like the yinth and they all got opinions.
And like I said, that's okay at the barber shop or at the beauty salon or over the back fence.
You know, everybody's like, well, yeah.
Because it's in the news.
It's a big story.
Everybody's talking about it and thinking about it.
But in the media or where people have a forum.
And you know, this we're just doing a fun show.
But I'm just talking in general because I've done these shows for many, many years.
The things that people ought to care about and the things that people can change and the things.
In fact, it's interesting on top of a clock radio.
Most of the talk is about larger national international issues.
Things that you really have almost no control over from abortion.
Although that gets more to a local thing.
You can elect certain people.
But like the budget deficit.
Things that are just out of our grasp.
But the things that affect your life every second day, which is like close to home.
The lower the level it is, state politics, local politics, the less the interest is.
And that's just human nature and the same with elections.
Whether the presidential election, even though it's nothing to write home about, we get our biggest turn out.
When it's just a statewide election, smaller turn out.
And when it's just local elections, the smallest turn out ever.
And it's just dumb.
And it's because people know nothing about civics.
They know nothing about government.
They know nothing about anything really other than just surviving.
And what time is the assumptions coming up.
And basically that's it.
And how people, and I'm not going to get excited about it because I've been here too long.
Okay.
But how people can a lot of markets of 21 points can allow people like Nick Navarro.
And Bob Cox and the geriatric, the dying, the king, redneck, old, festering craft that's up there that's still there in Fort Lauderdale,
other parts of Broward, all those termites who are festering there.
To just take everything that took years to develop and just throw down a drink.
And nobody says anything.
Oh, we don't want spring break.
Send all those kids to Daytona.
Too much shirt problems. Too much.
Too much anything. Too many people.
Too much money. Too many tourists.
I can just see the people of Disney World say, we don't want all these tourists.
They were making too much money.
And it's too crowded.
And the lines are too long and all the attractions.
Let's stop promoting it.
Okay, let's tell people it sucks here.
Okay, let's get a bunch of old people that got them up here.
And instead of having like a Mickey Mouse will have Eddie Cantor.
You know, we'll have somebody doing Eddie Cantor and Jack Benny.
Oh, man. It's just pathetic.
In this town, and that's why you call me negative, call me whatever you want.
But it's frustrating because this town could be like paradise.
And all these people, hey, we just were at the Excalibur.
We were just at the Marais, we were in Vegas. We had a great time.
Why do we have to get on like two planes and slip 3,000 miles out in the middle of the goddamn desert to have a good time?
Oh, it's gambling.
Okay.
And all these people that are going to go out today and tomorrow and try to win the $50 million.
And they might as well take the money and have a burning party in the backyard.
Hey, that's not gambling. See, that's fun. That's an investment or something.
I don't know what the hell it is.
But anyway, what the hell am I talking about?
We've got Elaine. It's all here.
Elaine, of course, who can eat with the best of them.
She's got the new W.I.O.D. news.
A sud and rick.
The emotional, hysterical, psychotic, rick-rally, a man with a temper that seldom seen in the history of Irish behavior.
They'll be here from two to six. Hank Goldberg on sports talk that on Chula show at 605.
Yankee is in the A's at 7.30.
The news talk radio, 6.10.00W.I.O.D. presents the Neil Rogers show.
To get in touch in talks, dial 751.00W.I.O.D. in Dave. 5.24.00W.I.O.D. in Broward.
6.55.00W.I.O.D. in the Palm Beach.
And if you use a bell-stop mobility car phone, it's a free call at star I.O.D.
The opinions expressed by the host guest or colors are not necessarily those of this station.
Now here's Neil Rogers.
There's only one Frank Sinatra.
And now Krapko introduces his latest live album.
Perfectly, Frank.
This one goes out for that crazy Irish broad, Shine Heddle Cunning.
She gets stranger every night.
She's taking chances as our anthem fights.
I got the answer, sends the broad back home.
Maybe she'll change her tune.
Old Blue Eyes tells it like it is.
Shunne, go, Shunne, go back where you belong.
He's the chairman of the board and you will be too when you hear perfectly Frank.
She's shaved her head.
Each morning at 8.
And she don't even think that the star's final battered.
To drink.
Think of the desert.
And don't give her a map.
If Frank Sinatra lives, live it, and perfectly Frank.
I think the lady will all craft.
The name, baby.
No one compares to you.
Thanks, I.
From those six.
That's already number two with a bullet.
We've only played it twice.
There's an open line on that star I.O.D. line.
I think we're developing very rampartly kind of like a love hate relationship on it line.
Because I know I hate it.
Surfside.
Yeah, I do.
Okay.
I was only a real couple of years ago.
Not so long ago.
But here in the county had a killer.
I think he was accused or he's in trial for possibly 32 homicides.
It killed these processes here in the county.
They said he was my auntie.
Bigly.
Yeah.
Well, he never got any press coverage on that.
I mean, he was like on the local paper.
He was like maybe in the front page.
Maybe watch your fights.
And they died off.
And here are all these people from the meat of this jump on the bandwagon.
You know, you guys sooner or later got a chance.
Well, maybe it wasn't sexy enough.
Yeah.
And you know what I have.
Channel 7, I know what they need as one of their people on the streets.
The neat day, Dave.
Yeah.
And he could cover the town like a blanket.
He had to suit on either day.
If they could put him in date and Debbie and Broward, they could cover the whole town like at the same time all at once.
They had to, I thought they came in and they had to stack it on.
And he turned around on the camera.
And his ass and that flat on the back of his jacket.
But just stick it up, you know.
There's like a terrorist shoot right there.
Yeah.
It was unbelievable.
He's the best.
That's why I had to go out and buy that the new big screen TV.
Oh, that's a joke.
I was going to call my boss, our main for the line of high to douchebags.
Yes, sir.
You have a deal with Neil.
Have a great one.
Thank you.
1208 at WIOD.
We got this newsletter now.
There's no stop on this now.
And guess what?
Yes, what?
The best news of all.
The best is yet to come.
Where did I find it?
Boy, there's so many pages on here.
That was about the, um, okay, the Nilees in the US Air Force.
Wow.
Tuesday, September 11th at 7.30 p.m. at Brian Piccolo Field on Sheridan Street.
West of the turnpiking Cooper City.
Another Nilees softball, extravaganza.
All the games are fixed.
So have no fear and come out.
The mouth.
Here's the piece of news that was the exciting thing.
Mouth billboards are going down.
Add new billboards are on the way promoting news.
Traffic.
And weather.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
That almost inspires me.
Oh, and I got a story for you.
Oh, man, you will never guess.
You, you're not prepared for this.
Okay, you think you are.
George will, he will either fall on the floor or get up, walk out and never be seen again.
You remember vaguely Steve King, WABC New York history fired.
Now, I have this on pretty good authority.
The person they finally hired, they had these two bimbos on their news people filling in.
And they conducted the usual nationwide search that we always hear about in broadcasting.
And they replaced Steve in the morning on WABC 7750,000 watts.
That's once great radio station with his board.
Who has never done a show before.
So Bill McQuig, you've started a trend in the business.
You're a great American.
Congratulations.
Where did that film, a quick card?
Huh?
I got to find that.
When I heard that, I didn't know what the screen or each a key to banana.
I'm telling you, I just thought I would lose my mind.
I'll find that card.
Bill McQuig from O, that's my favorite.
Oh, buddy.
Okay, 10 pass, no, let's take your call from Jupiter.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Listen, you know, I saw Al Goldstein in the Donut News show a couple of days ago.
Yeah.
Did you see him?
No, I didn't see him.
Oh, okay.
He looked, ooh.
Big.
Oh, my God.
Those gold chains and everything.
Yeah.
Ooh.
And then I got an insight for you.
I think maybe you know already, date.
Oh, and woman, he's going on vacation.
You're probably going to get a new job somewhere.
I wouldn't be surprised.
Oh, also speaking to that, the word is that Sandy Payton is going to.
She's bought a condo in Vegas because she loves Vegas.
She loves to gamble.
And the rumor is that she's going to be moving out there when they, when they pulled the plug.
You know, you know, I thought she was going to go maybe to Colorado.
Because she goes there a lot.
And she always felt about it.
Now, she's going to Vegas from what I understand.
Really?
You know, I read Sanchez.
You know what my dad thinks?
Every time that he sees Rick Sanchez on the news, see, we are a fan.
So he tells me all the time.
He said, when I looked at Rick Sanchez, he said, I can't even understand when he talks in English.
Because he said, I think he, he looks like he's got a potato, something he's mouth.
Or something, yeah.
And I think, you know, where they should send Steve Cain to?
Maybe to Chicago where Ed Killin.
Oh, man.
Ed Kill, you really know how to hurt a guy.
Just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just tell me what your problem is.
Well, anyway, tell Bill Carter, say hello.
And, you know, I hope that maybe he'll get, you know, somewhere.
I know that Jerry Witton is going to be in your station.
Oh, doesn't that, doesn't that just to make the hair on your head and stand straight up?
Yeah, but they, they should have got Bill instead of him.
You know, I mean, I like Jerry too, but I like Bill.
Well, we're going for that real old crowd, you know, the post-death crowd, post-gary metric.
So they own, own woman boy.
She, I tell you, she's really, I don't know where she's going to go, but oh God.
Well, probably a big state like Montana, Alaska, someplace that can hold her.
Maybe, maybe she'll go with Miss Piggy.
Okay, have a great week.
Okay, bye-bye, Bill.
See ya.
12 minutes past noon at Good old WIOD where we just stir the pot.
And, quite frankly, here in some of these colors, I think they're smoking it.
We have an open line in Broward 524 and one in beautiful pod beach at 655 Jack Cole.
655 WIOD will be right back.
First, it took a little girl.
Your mother served lunch in here.
Then, it was that the priest left you my child.
Now, it's taken over the refrigerator.
Honey, would you like a little parking margin on your muffin?
What about, honey?
I said you want some parking.
Honey, I think the job on the table just...
You fireball leave-and-fuck.
Metro Golden Margarine presents, exorcist, four, starring Molly McButter
and introducing Polly Unsaturated as the tormented housewife.
Honey, would you like some butter please?
Breakfast will never be the same.
You will believe it's not butter.
And, it doesn't stop there.
Hey, it's me, Sandra.
You're cloud on fire.
As it was for now, melting at the Citadel Plex II, plenty of free parking.
Okay.
Somebody stop Sally's chair, okay, she's out of control.
1216 at WIOD, mobile on the Starline.
How you doing, Neil?
Yes, sir.
I'm pissed off about this town, too.
You know, we have some friends, really good friends of ours,
good-gagging, or lesbians.
And they're telling me, oh, we need equal rights, we need equal rights.
So the other day I go out and vote for the equal rights amendment, right?
Or the human rights of women's amendment.
So I go home and knock on that door and say, hey, did you guys vote?
Oh, we don't vote for that because nothing is going to happen.
That's just my God.
Now, for the other midfans down here in Florida, they're blind.
I'm a midfan.
These guys came play fundamental baseball.
Exactly.
They cannot, they're not score or run.
When they lost one nothing to the car, they could have manufactured a run.
Listen, listen to me.
First and second, nobody out.
Keith Miller pinched running at second base.
Tommy, her bunstable 30 feet foul.
Not even a fair ball, he bunstied foul in the air.
And Keith Miller takes off like somebody just lit his uniform on fire.
And they throw him out by 15 feet for double play kills the inning.
And ends basically the game.
Well, let's go back two weeks ago, what Magnus was running on a hit and run play.
That guy couldn't run his favorite's life.
Exactly, he's a statue.
They cannot play fundamental baseball.
They don't, you know, there were all these people say the pitch in the pitch.
And the pitch and fell apart in the last month.
And yeah, they had some good games when they hit 93.
But they're through.
They are finished.
Well, you said that.
This is that 26 or 7 games to go.
So I wouldn't say they're finished.
The pirates now are right in the high.
They're going to win the least one game in New York, the pirates.
And they're going to, what's this schedule tonight, the pirates?
They're playing Montreal for it.
Montreal's been killing them all years.
Yeah, but up in Montreal?
No, in Pittsburgh.
No one's going to win two or three.
What if I win three games?
I think, I guess.
Okay.
And they have the, they play in sound baseball.
They're doing everything good.
Jose Lee is playing a great second base.
He made a tremendous play the other night.
Yeah.
He killed the route.
Okay.
Well, I think that guys try to mess up your phone connection.
We're dying, but the good luck found.
Okay, guys.
Thank you.
1219 in WIOD.
Star IOD is open at the Uplifting Star Line for the Bell South and the Biblity folks.
South, whoops, South Miami.
Hello.
Yeah, hello, Neil.
Yes.
How you doing today?
Okay.
Sounds like you are.
This morning your best friend was on Regis and Cassie Lee.
Hank Oldberg?
No, but close.
He introduced him as a great sky.
Al Goldstein.
Larry King.
Oh, geez.
Yeah, and he was plugging his new book.
He was doing why?
He was plugging his new book.
He's published a new book, apparently.
Yeah, you know what the name of his new book is, don't you?
No.
Let me see it off.
Ah, gee, I see you're on the whole thing.
Let me see it off.
Yeah.
Anyone can guess that.
I guess.
Yeah, especially here in Miami.
Okay, Neil.
Larry King was on there.
What a self-promoting.
Just a slimy, wormy, weasel, just the...
You know, he writes that column in USA today.
And he's always taken a little digs.
He never mentions my name,
but he's always taken a little digs about the talk show host
who don't have any guests and the only opinions he hear
are the hosts and it's boring.
I'll tell you, you can just hear the sound of him kissing butt on it.
I'm both of those shows that you can hear it from coast to coast.
I'll tell you what he deserves.
He ought to have Debbie Ellis and Dave Game on his show.
I'd like to see him kiss that butt.
You have to have a lip transplant.
I guess this space can't be performed anymore than that.
I think he went to the David Johnson School of Interviewing.
Have a great weekend.
Larry King.
Oh, man, don't get me started.
Don't get me started on Larry King, okay?
In fact, it's highly a closeness, which I hope they don't ever do that.
But if they do, they're going to have to have you know they talk about making a name museum.
They will definitely have to have as one of the attractions.
The Larry King Memorial Dora, where they have all those bad checks that he used to write.
I know, let's do it that way.
21 past noon at WIOD.
Let's do a little business here, George, and we'll come right back.
Now we're cooking.
A 1223 at WIOD.
One of our listeners in Lake Placid of all places sends me.
I just opened it up.
A painter of a new thing.
It's called Enhanced Bios Life Diet.
The only patented biogar.
What the hell is that?
And it's like one of these powder things that you put in a water or juice or something.
And I opened it up and it just smells incredible.
And it's got all directions on the back.
I guess this is one of those things to fill up your stomach so you don't eat so much.
It says, so the first three days take one.
Once a day before the main meal, sprinkle one flat tablespoon.
An 8 to 10 ounce glass of water, juicer, your favorite beverage, Henry.
After the first three days, allow the system to adjust to the fiber.
Take one flat tablespoon, three, that's flat as in flatulence.
Three times per day, and I, 30 minutes before meals.
Warning.
Do not take more than one tablespoon at a time or more than the recommended daily usage.
May produce a slight, laxative effect the first few days.
On the fourth day, if you take too much, the effect may get worse.
And on the fifth day, if you continue the overdoses, you could be out of control.
Okay, I'll tell you, we could go take this to Halendale and sell it and be tired by the end of the day.
Better than when it went into lottery.
1225 is WI-O-D. Let's go to all boys, surfside.
Hey, Neil, how the hell are you?
Okay, it's the Eli Targaman Jr. I bet.
Hey, remember me, I'm one of the surfside boys.
Hey, what's wrong with everybody with these mats here?
Putting them down.
They just won seven in a row. They're in a pennant race.
They just won seven in a row?
And they lost three in a row.
But they're not seven in a row.
And everybody's riding high.
As soon as they lose a couple of games, everyone's all over.
Yeah, well, probably because...
You never meant to call it that.
Probably because there were the three most important games of the season I would imagine.
What's that?
Well, see if you would stop talking and listening.
You would have heard what I said.
I said probably because there were the three most important games of the season up to this day.
That's all right. I don't have another series with Pittsburgh.
No, they have two more series with Pittsburgh, okay?
So what? I mean, your cubs are over here in the cellar.
No, we're not in the cellar, sir.
We may be close, but we're in fourth place, okay?
Things guys are putting the mess down. Let's do right.
Well, yeah, because they suckin' because of that.
They're listening. They're greater.
We admit that.
18 games over 500.
How many teams are 18 games over 500?
Well, that's wonderful.
I mean...
There are three and a half games out.
Two days ago, they were half a game.
In fact, three days ago, they were half a game ahead of my memory is correct.
Yeah, they were.
So what? They lost four.
I mean, they weren't playing very well.
Right.
They could turn around and win 10 and a row and stick it right in your eye.
Okay.
Hey, listen, Doug, my mother make no difference to me.
I'm not a pirate fan.
I mean, don't start getting personal and hysterical and abusive against you.
That's the only reason you're always putting them down.
Another classic example.
You're whining.
You're hysterical.
You're becoming personally abusive and it's just a ball game.
I know that.
I like the matter.
But you just answered.
You just answered the question that you asked yourself.
Why is everybody putting them down?
Why is everybody hating?
Because of people like you.
No, because people like you fat boy stuff.
No, okay.
There we go.
Fat this foul.
27 afternoon at WIOD.
We have an open line in Dave County.
751-946-3751.
There's no hope for met fans.
Believe me, no hope.
There's like a smattering of them out there who are decent enough and intelligent enough
to cope with reality.
And like I said, there's like 25, 26, 27 games left.
Anything can happen.
I'm not, I'm always said.
It's going to go right down to that last three games in Pittsburgh, October 1st, 2nd and 3rd.
That's what I've been saying.
And possibly will.
And you try to become an objective and rational.
And these people are not calm or rational or objective.
They're just obnoxious.
And then like at the end of the call, we got to make it into a personally abusive attack
because you don't like my team.
Oh, geez.
I mean, give me a break.
What year?
28 past noon at WIOD.
Hollywood.
Yeah, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Why are you giving Jerry a hard time?
What?
Why are you harassing Jerry?
What's your name?
Harassing Jerry.
Yeah, you're cut.
I'm not harassing him.
I'm promoting the fact he's going to be doing nights at WIOD.
Oh, is he moving to this station?
That's what I said.
That's the rumor.
Oh, really?
I like him.
I think he's got a lot of talent.
Well, when's he going to start using it?
What's that?
His talent?
Yeah.
I don't know, probably when you start using yours.
Okay.
Okay.
Clever.
Yeah, well, I think he does good.
Uh-huh.
I'm glad to hear your station if I'm having a house in plants.
Yes, sir.
Well, that's going to add a little touch of class, but I'll tell you.
Well, maybe your ratings will go up.
Okay.
Okay.
Good luck to you, sir.
Let me know when you get a life, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
28 past noon at WIOD.
We have an open line in Broward.
524 Red.
524 Next.
Let's go to a Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Good morning, Neil.
What is this?
That guy from Surcise.
What a moron.
Yeah, that's Eli Purgamon, Jr.
He's just another one of these misfit, malcontents, former New York type people who are here
in just miserable and rotten and, uh...
And just to go back home.
Yeah.
Um, month ago, I sent you a ski channel.
I was wondering if you ever got it.
Yes, sir.
I forget your mail.
I have it right in a very special place.
Oh, okay.
But right around my dog's neck and every time he does something bad, I give him a big yank right on the thing.
And it's joy to show what we juky yesterday with the exception of Mr. Appaite.
It's your history.
But in our first psychotic, just to come in here and put on a performance scene,
only the last time I was seen by Dick Farrell.
Right, he's that was where I called.
Do you have that tape of when Ferrell threatened jica?
Yeah, it's in here somewhere.
Would you mind?
What I'm mind what?
Not the scene.
Now you're running in the call.
Sorry.
We've gone.
I can't hold it.
We're actually going crazy.
Now without people laughing into this request crap.
I wasn't a request.
I didn't say that word.
Okay.
Have a good weekend.
And the same to you.
Can't control themselves.
1230 at WIOD.
We have an open line in Broward County.
524, the Mets fight the big one.
524 at WIOD.
See, even like when jica was here, it's the end time.
It's a good guy and a good sense of humor, but he's a Mets fan.
And so we only talked about the fact that that double hit.
1242 at WIOD.
During the break, I was looking at the daily info sheet that we have with all the promos.
So, Judge and Rick are really getting topical.
You think that the Gainesville rumor line yesterday was something today?
The poll question is, is the market really going to crash?
What do you think?
Unbelievable.
Okay.
We have an open line in Palm Beach.
655 WIOD.
We have a former celebrity caller on the line now.
You come on here and you bash me.
And it's very obvious you two guys are out of work and want the afternoonship
around here.
It's the most tasteless thing I've ever heard in my life.
Driving home the new.
And I'm driving to work.
I have a show to do.
And I'm getting picked off.
And driving home the fourth and whether.
All the different views.
If I had the ability, I'd take you out of here right now and take a goddamn teetre.
He'll help you through the traffic.
Just smile or two.
I'll be calling.
I'll drive and home with you.
Well, chief.
I ain't held a hear.
I'm the car no driving home.
I'm from Ray Special WIOD.
You know, I saw when he came in here.
He had a hear up his nose yesterday.
You know what?
I had that figure yesterday calling and trying to do Bob the car.
He should get his own material.
You got several imitators out there.
I guess that's the epitome of flattery.
That's what they always tell me when everybody in the market riffs off all my material.
That should be very flattered.
Yeah, almost tossed on the floor when you played that way.
Well, we at least are hearing from Alex Jr.
We sure haven't heard from Robert anymore after he was left off the track.
You know what I saw him?
Yeah.
I saw him at school.
After his mom to disaster because he was here when he was supposed to registering for school.
He was walking kind of weird when I saw him.
Maybe his mom got to him, you know what I mean?
Really?
Did a little 19, mom?
Did you talk to him?
No, he was going to go talk with him.
And there was a bunch of people around him.
But I come back here to like disappear.
I guess he saw me and he hated Robert.
Probably, yeah.
Split, you know what I mean?
Well, he wants to pretend that he wasn't the one that was really here.
You know, that's how it goes.
There was some other guy.
There was some other guy.
I have another Robert.
I almost plot on the floor here today when you played Bob Lester imitating our ghostings big.
It was great.
Bob Lester, boy, where do I know that name?
Where do we know that name?
Where's that car?
Where's that car?
I haven't ripped you off for a long time.
So, I would you find a buffet?
So, I would you find a buffet?
So, I would you find a buffet?
Yeah, that's the number one question.
Yeah, I know.
It was great.
Okay, I hear your tube is doing okay.
So, my what?
Your tube?
Oh, yeah, my tube is doing great.
Maybe, maybe.
Every time it makes little noise like that, I think of you.
Yeah, well see, when I'm watching Channel 7,
like about 10 o'clock,
that noise comes out through the speaker of my TV.
Is it a little reverbed?
Yeah.
When Tally starts spinning in the chair?
Yes, sir.
It's the same sound, and I can't believe it.
Well, Alex, I'll tell you, it sounds like you're out of material.
Well, I was out of material when I first saw it.
You ever offered a big kiss for all of us?
But, once I saw him, he's not paying attention to mommy.
He's just over hormonal and psychotic.
Well, his mom and his brother must have done a little tag team on him, you know?
So to speak.
Have a great weekend.
So, you can easily handle that.
I'll leave it there, yes.
Okay.
1245 at WIOD.
We have an open line in Dave County.
Look at that.
Boy, this is just almost more than I can deal with.
There's a mobile in Jupiter.
Yeah, you don't like anybody on WABC?
I what?
Do you like anybody on WABC?
I don't listen to WABC because I live in South Florida.
Is that right?
What about Bob Grant?
Oh, gee, talk about bad wigs.
Wow.
And he does have a bad wig.
Bob Grant is going to be dead for 20 years.
He used to be great, and then they performed this operation out of them.
And they debulled him.
And he has never been the same.
He's like so mellow now.
Yeah.
He's like malignant but mellow.
Better than bud, then.
Bernard Meltzer.
Oh, and Dr. Bernard?
Oh my God.
Is he still alive?
Oh my God.
Oh, it all.
Geez.
I have forgotten about him.
I wonder if he'll sick all of a sudden.
Bernard Meltzer?
Yeah.
Wow.
That's a true story I've just said about the Bordop.
These Bordop replaced him.
I mean, is that the ultimate slant?
No, it's not.
It's not.

He's fine.
Maybe you can answer.
Why are the mettre so bad?
No, no, no, no.
I don't care about the mazz.
There was, there was a picture of a professional, you know,
I thought they called it a blooper pick.
Well, they do or the ephus pick.
I don't know.
Was it Hoyt Wilhelm or did that?
It was one of those guys who threw all that junk.
But it was a good picture at one time.
And have this one ball that used to go like an overhand softball pick or an underhand softball
pick, but it was sort of overhand.
And what about the other ball?
I don't know.
It's kind of hung around, I guess.
OK.
Well, I don't know.
It might have been Hoyt Wilhelm.
Why don't you think so?
He was a knock-o-doll.
I thought you were going to tell me.
No, I don't remember.
It's like an old timer.
It's not that old.
No.
Not bad.
Must have pitched for the mess.
Yep, might.
Maybe it was John Matlack.
No.
Somebody will call in.
One of our baseball maven's, Hank will probably call in.
He knows it all.
I know it wasn't Bob Feller.
He threw a fastball.
Well, I know that it was, and I've been trying to think of it.
And I asked my father-in-law who was an old, high baseball person.
And he said, yeah, I don't.
I don't understand.
No, I know what you're talking about.
They called it the ethos pitch.
It's just like a big, like a lollipop.
Yeah.
Oh, man, I can just see him throwing a tune out up there.
And it would penalize them with that.
And when you're right, it wasn't that long ago.
It was, you know.
Now I'm getting upset.
See, you shouldn't do things like this.
Yeah, I had to think of it so much.
You have sleepless nights, and you lay there awake thinking,
oh, gee, I can see him throwing that thing up there
and then trying to take the swing.
Not Rick Rushall.
But some fat, out of shape, old timer, it'll come to me.
Or somebody will call him.
OK.
And if we don't get the answer, you know he ruined my weekend.
I'm sorry.
That's OK.
Bye.
119 at W.I.O.D. I can see it.
I can see him just throwing that big lollipop up there.
And it just drops.
Like in the old timers game, they pitch like that.
Anyway, 119 at W.I.D. maybe it was Frank Biola.
Hi, Alia.
Yeah, hi.
I think it was Carl Hubble, first of all.
No, this is more recent.
Carl Hubble is an ancient.
David LaPoi, as you pitch for the Cardinals,
then went to the Yankees, and he's still stunk.
Yeah.
But anyway, I don't have a pig report,
but I got a lifeguard report for you.
So, in that old popular one, they call the macho gay down
on the beach.
Well, he quit now, and he's working at Taco Bell,
and he changes name to Nacho Ray.
So I just wanted to tell you
that, and as far as that guy that worked for...
Wait, when somebody said Dave LaRosa,
the tiger's dead is not corrected.
Now, this is somebody very well known.
It's like...
I think it was LaPoi from the sixth.
No way.
And then he threw a lot of crap, but that's another story.
As far as that guy that worked for Muhammad,
I don't work for Muhammad, so I'd like to call him a colostomy bag.
OK.
Is that so, right?
Is there any truth to the rumor that's telling the bag, Dad?
Is there any truth to the rumor that Sally Fitz
is a fun liking for produce?
I keep hearing that rumor around.
Have a nice day.
OK.
That was a cute call.
A cute call.
Twenty after one, we have an open line in Dave County.
There he is, ladies and gentlemen,
wearing a bright yellow canary yellow shirt.
Look at that.
The ambiance of his presence here today.
He is just a roast.
Really?
One of those faded jeans in that yellow.
You look like a Yahoo today.
You've been working on the cobra?
Dave Parker, the cobra.
I think I'm one of those Bob Prince tapes.
If she calls Dave Parker, the cobra,
you'd be excited about that, even though you know.
And I loved your play by play when you
routed your Robbie Steadin' for that embarrassing
remote last Friday.
And you were doing a baseball.
It's low to the outside for a strike.
Now, not Ripsool.
Ripsool was like 100 years ago.
Oh.
We, uh, ain't back there, boss.
He didn't throw them very good, Bob.
It's 18-all run balls.
I don't like the three of Brod number 19.
Yeah, so what on?
Now, come on.
Sortin' what?
I'm glad.
Sortin' Kipper.
How about Bob Kipper?
How about Chuck?
Chuck is very good.
Chuck is very good.
Chuck is not very good.
Chuck is great.
And I wanted from that.
I don't want to.
And I, when we have things like this,
I like to pull him in here because he's the only guy who speaks the truth.
And that's exactly what you.
But would you yank him into an embarrassing?
Didn't you hear him?
No, he was the one.
He went on a great length.
I beg your pardon, embarrassed.
I didn't yank him.
I am.
I said you yanked him.
And people are starting to talk about it too.
Wow.
He maybe wished I would.
Yeah.
No.
And it's more of those little kids on the show.
And as far as your friend, Mr. Jekin,
I stress you are friend.
The last time he was on you said,
well, I was surprised he didn't come in early and come in and spend some time.
So I thought that was like the invitation.
So I did.
I came in.
No problem when you've come in.
But he just said,
Well, he has such a screaming yelling.
Oh, I'm hearing that.
We had such a great show yesterday.
Well, I didn't realize.
I didn't realize he did hate me.
But I realized that when I sat down, I probably did put a damn phone.
No, I don't think he does hate you.
But I think that once you started calling him a short slob or something like that,
he started getting rid of that.
He was gravising.
It's sort of like I walked in the river.
And what are the hell is that I have that when you dripped that calzone all over his back?
And when I was piping high, you just put my crew away.
He was so happy about that.
That was my tongue.
Was it?
Yeah.
Well, he was smiling.
Yeah.
But he's alright.
He can handle it.
Well, that's funny.
But you see, you have this facility.
You never deal with specifics.
You are the greatest smoke-floor I have ever seen in my life.
The name is wrong.
No, but just like, for example, I see I went into specifics about this protest display that you guys have.
And I just said that.
Oh, what you were wrong, I just said that.
But I mean, like to think about the 4-7.
I had a nine.
No, it's 4-4.
Oh, what?
We weren't talking about you.
I know you had a nine.
I know it's come on.
You know, a good friend of mine, another one mentioned Stan's name.
But he used to get into this thing.
Oh, I used to have a five.
But nobody cares what we used to have.
It's water over the dam.
All those listeners have moved to Louisville or somewhere.
But the fact is, he was a radio reporter and he missed a great story.
What great story about it when we left YXC?
The fact we had the highest ratings in the fire.
He missed a great story about the cancer, which just happened two months ago.
And he's not going to print anything as I said.
So he missed a great story.
And as far as why do they see a lot of people right about me?
Good and bad.
You didn't write about all of your friends.
You didn't...
He is your friend.
I have other than a high at the track.
I have never had a meal with Tom.
I don't socialize with him.
And I would speak to him as long as he calls from the office.
I don't call him a host.
I don't say.
He's your friend.
Perfect.
You allow.
Yeah.
And you want to tell me that.
Nothing.
It'll like it would be better because there are a lot of people.
You like poison, okay?
Like poison.
I don't want to mention Charlie Whitehead.
I don't have that.
I just got the grute and people.
Well, of course not.
Right.
And Tom hates you.
I have more hatched jobs in this town.
I mean, do you remember Trappiag Magazine?
You weren't here.
Somebody had a set up on it.
That up set up on it?
Well, I am.
No, I'm not.
No, as long as he's spelled your name right or even close.
Like, K-N-E-E.
When the hero puts in K-N-E-E-L, and you know there's no like it too much.
Well, I tell you, life anyway, let's get back to what were you talking about?
Forget about Tom.
Okay, that's...
That is just all ready done.
Yeah, if you want to apologize.
Oh, that's too much of a wrong idea.
Whoa, I like it.
Okay.
My discussion was about that in temperate...
The thing about games for this, then you kept saying we want to get everybody up today.
We don't want to present.
Exactly.
And then you had all these rumor-mongering assholes going...
Oh, I think the mage did it.
I think a woman did it.
Okay, answer me.
It is, huh?
I don't care what they think.
Okay, and then the guy called Chuck and then there was a woman and Chuck reamed him in earlobe,
man.
As with half the colors.
You don't care what they think, but you don't know what they think.
So you get them on here and then you have a woman.
But what did you think that you see her like Johnny?
You only wish she had his money.
And so do I.
You know, he brings all these people on there this morning for one.
What are...
That's what are they going to tell us, but the same thing with our audience.
You know, our audience knows something that police up there don't.
Meg, give you an explanation why I did that.
Okay.
Because I think after so long that this is going on.
Wow.
Magnety.
How long did the funding murders go on?
How many years?
But in the Hillside Strangler and the Green River Kill.
We talked about all this.
Okay.
But the fact is, like you said, how would you like to be the one who says,
okay, they got the guy go back up there and then you find your son at seven pieces.
When they're close, okay, but wait.
I took the other side.
I don't think they have the guy.
And I think they're loathing people into a false sense of security.
But why?
And I just wanted to discuss that with Josh.
That's why.
And I really don't think they have the guy.
And I think that if people think that they do, they're just illusioning me.
Okay.
I don't think that you think that they think that we think that nobody thinks what you think counts.
The fact is it's news and it's hot news.
But no, no.
What you think is not news.
That's the difference.
Now, Johnny, Darce has got some news because he's got the news lettering his hot little hand.
He's about to eat it because there's no food in here today.
That's the right color, Johnny.
Listen, I'll even make a pledge to stop talking about what a slob and pig you are.
If you'll go out and buy a shirt, just one.
You can wash it every day.
He wears the stave.
I didn't realize that.
He wears the same two shirts.
I've known this man for years and he...
But you know, they all go well with food.
Yeah.
You could ask stuff on him.
No, they don't go well with food.
That is food.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I just...
You're not going to get off that easy with me.
I just...
I almost called in.
I think I'm going to put up a shirt.
I'm going to put up a shirt.
I'm not going to start doing it.
I'm not going to start doing it.
I'm not going to start doing it.
I'm not going to start doing it.

Let me tell you another little rickweaver story about a one was it about the eight months ago or so we were it was like the last two weeks
We were collecting all the money for the Camilla Sounds which we raised seventy-six grand this last time.
And I was sitting out in front which I never got in the lobby, but the mail was so overwhelming
I was trying to keep up with it.
I was sitting out there was about nine thirty in the morning and there was a whole box full of checks.
And I'm sitting there opening them and missed through.
