That was the days of Anita Bryant and all that.
I've admired you ever since, but anyway.
December 17, 1976, so it's like almost exactly 15 years.
Yeah, and a week.
But I had a dream last night.
I had a dream that Miami Beach was filled up and they had to see those.
Yeah, but he was having a good time.
I think Delusion would be the word out of dream.
And, uh, all the time.
And at Mickey McNickel, what nine races Wednesday at a pompadot park, you also dreamed that.
Yeah.
Just a joke, Mickey, relax.
Okay, it's only a race.
You know, if there was one good thing about Alex Bennett and here comes Raymond Scholar on the far outside.
You ready?
Yeah.
It was one good thing about Alex Bennett.
I got the so it's here to Alex Bennett.
I got to see the studio.
Oh, you were in the live studio audience.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was one of two and I got to see Tiki Farco and Tom Jicke and I actually got to see a.
Inside working of a studio, whatever.
And it was fun.
Uh-huh.
And he is as bald as you say you and wrinkle and old.
Yes.
Yes.
And in closing, I'd like to call Bob and BD, a douchebag and Frank and Rosalie, my parents.
Thank you.
Okay.
Good luck to you, pal.
No, do it again.
Well, this I don't this chord.
Can we I mean, this is supposed to be a real radio station.
I say supposed to be can we get a chord in here that isn't got a short in it?
I like to kind of like stroll around the room here and the roll around on the floor on this
roller and go from rack to rack and pretend like Mr. Hotshot.
And every time you like tug on your chord here, it starts crackling.
You ever have that problem you start tugging on your cord into crackles.
A pay phone from Keebus game.
Hey, how you doing?
Okay.
You know, I've been waiting for this for a long, long time.
Got five or three finally.
We got a game got father.
Oh, that's good.
That's good.
Yeah.
You kill me every time you do it.
Anyway, every time I do what?
Every time you play the music.
Yeah.
You know that they're seeing when when Michael goes with K, the last one.
When the Godfather starts into the Marlon Brando.
Remember, he's telling him that whoever comes in who can kill him.
Well, he is not in that scene.
That's out in the gardener in the backyard.
Yeah.
Well, the next to the last one, when Michael starts into...
Whoever brings you this meeting is there with Trader.
Just remember that.
Hey, Marlon Brando and Michael are following on here right now.
Ready to music?
No, I'm good.
Okay.
It's planned.
Hey.
Michael.
Michael.
How's your family?
Is anyone with them?
Yeah, cause it's a little man takes care of his family.
No.
Why is my genie big?
Well, it comes to you that I die with.
You know what?
You know what?
Man, man.
And boys can be...
be me killers.
But man, kid.
And I will choose to be a foe in all.
I will choose.
I will always run in Michael.
I will run this field.
I will always tell you to be put in this field.
Santa Rogers.
Santa New Rogers.
Santa New Rogers.
I will leave you here.
I know you've done a good job.
I hope your first child is a masculine child.
I love what you then you are.
1225 at I.O.D.
Boy, anybody who says that that isn't the most powerful movie in the history of the film industry is full of crap.
Okay?
It just kind of like permeates every cell in your body and every cell in Arcadia, at BCC, not BCC, BCC, JL and BCC.
Most of those kids at BCC couldn't get arrested.
Fort Lauderdale.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Yes, Mr. Rogers.
Yes.
Have you seen the Godfather when they put the boat together and you see all of the scenes what cuts out to both movies?
Yes.
That is incredible.
You know where the guy who blew up the car with his wife in it?
Yes.
And he finds him in a TV...
Fabrizio in New York.
Fabrizio, prepare La Manca.
Hey.
Listen anyway, I have a whole story.
It's going to crawl to you.
It's going to win by a head.
Have a great life, sir.
Boy.
By the way, how about that guy from England, the other day, Frank?
He was okay at the mode.
He was a good guy.
He won the Zuba pants.
And he was going to go back and show him off to the Queen.
He was good.
There were a lot of people there who were real good of all kinds.
Well, that was a great remote.
I don't want to just overdo it, but the charcoal's remote was fabulous.
We had a great time.
We had a just fabulous group of people there, including several that we're going to get personal invitations right to our studio.
Miami.
Neil.
Yes.
I just wanted to correct one more point.
There.
Anzo was the baker's helper Nazarene.
Was the name of the baker?
Yeah, the baker was a...
Nazarene was the one that came in.
His daughter was in love with this guy.
The kid that was going to be deported because you didn't know that was Anzo.
Oh, that was Anzo.
Yeah.
Oh, and Marlon Brando says, give this to a Jew congressman from the Bronx.
Not one of our people.
Remember?
Right.
For him to be a citizen.
To get his green card or whatever it was that time.
Right.
The other thing I was going to say, I also think that I heard Rick Sanchez singing in that Godfather.
This sounded like him in the background.
Could be.
Yeah.
When he slapped him in the face and he said, butch up a little bit.
Exactly.
By the way, Rick Sanchez has a new album coming out.
It's called So Many Pedestrians So Little Time.
It's going to be Big and Halibale.
It'll be a big hit, I think.
You bet.
Yeah.
One other thing I was going to say.
But I've never been able to listen to your program during the day because I teach school.
Isn't this a real tweet?
It sure is.
But I don't know.
I'm one of the tape gang.
Each night I manage to listen to the preceding one hour tape.
Usually 10 to 11 o'clock.
Great.
Well, I put all the good stuff in between 10 and 11.
What you usually do is the introduction to the program.
Right.
It's very enjoyable.
All the four play.
Right.
Could I wish my cousin, Don Michael Barrett.
Don Michael.
Don Michael Barrett, the douchebag.
Happy holiday.
Okay.
Thanks a lot, Neil.
Nice job with Camilla now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Have a good one.
Yeah.
Well, I don't understand.
I want to get to baseball intensive.
Although it isn't that far off.
It's almost January.
So we only got about a couple of months.
Spring training will be getting underway.
I can't believe it.
Incredible.
A couple of months hurricane baseball beginning started.
No Sam Jankovich.
Boy, is that open up a couple of doors?
Huh?
Although Sunny gave me a dirty look this morning.
I don't know what that meant.
Give me that great check for Camilla Sousa on the back.
Was it out?
Keep your nose out of the baseball.
I don't remember when we meant by that.
Now, Sunny is a good guy.
But baseball right around the corner.
What I don't understand though is the cups have made some...
They picked up three free agents.
But what I do not understand is what are they going to do with three catchers?
And with two outstanding catchers.
I mean, we've got Hector Villanova who weighs 700 pounds but can hit the ball.
We got Joe Gerardi who I improved dramatically this last year.
And of course, we got Damon Berryhead.
Berryhill.
They got to make a trade.
I know a team that desperately needs a good catcher.
I don't want to mention the Metz desperately.
Boy, what they could do with Joe Gerardi, I'm telling you.
Now, we don't want too much.
We'll take good and maybe.
Viola, we don't want.
I guarantee you Viola will not...
But this is my prediction.
Frank Viola will not win 15 games for the Metz this season.
He is garbage.
I know he won all those games and all those...
But they're going to catch you onto him.
He throws balls.
Okay, he doesn't throw strikes.
And if he lay off that crap, all those fork balls,
low and away, way out of the strike zone.
If you just use some patience, man.
This guy gets in serious trouble.
And he's got to bring that fat one in there.
Right in the wheelhouse in Sanberg.
He hits it about 700 yards out of the ballpark.
I was watching the other day, the...
Just out of sheer boredom.
The game against the Giants in Wrigley Field,
where Sanberg hit the home run that they first called fair.
And then they called it a foul ball.
And Zimmer went crazy and got thrown out of the game.
And was kicking dirt on Harry Wendelstad and put on about a 20-minute show.
It was tremendous.
And they kept showing over.
And over the ball was clearly fair.
And the third-based umpire called it right.
And then Wendelstad called a little conference after Roger Craig came bitching and winding.
And a reversed and called it foul.
As it turned out to make any difference because the Cubs won the game.
But it was one of the great argument scenes of the season.
And Zimmer, we may not win the penit,
but at least Zimmer puts on the best show of anybody.
You've got to give him that.
And if you had a steel plate and your head, you'd be uh...
Serly two.
1242 at WIOD.
I mean, he's no Davey Johnson.
Now look who we have on the phone ladies and gentlemen.
A voice from Christmas past.
White at day.
I feel just like Ebenezer's Scrooge in the heat.
White at day.
Yeah.
You uh...
Catched the Johnny Depp report and names and faces in the Sentinel?
No.
I sure did.
Well, he talks about his worst nightmare.
Yeah.
It's being chased by the skipper Alan Hall Jr. from Gilligan's Island.
And he's chasing me and chasing me and he's in his bathrobe.
And I jump over a set of bushes and he jumps on top of me.
And then I wake up.
What?
And then it turns out it's not a dream, right?
Wow, Johnny.
All in the interhairs.
Yeah, look out for Old Scissorhead.
He went Bobby O'Heeder.
What a team they would make him.
Talk about chasing.
Yeah.
Well, listen, I call him.
He could be the governor of Rhode Island again.
I call him my mom.
I call him my mom.
Jack and Chafee.
Wasn't that his name?
Wasn't he governor of Rhode Island?
Come on.
You're not as sharp as you're supposed to be on Christmas Eve Day.
Governor Who?
I don't know.
Governor Corleone.
Senator Corleone.
Well, I call him my mom.
Another president of auntie.
I call Grandma Lena Sestin, Palermo Sistalis this morning,
to assure Mary Christmas.
And let me tell you, she's real pissed off about the opening tomorrow.
Real pissed off.
She said the enemy scene is not accurate.
There's one thing about the same grandma.
It was real big on Antibas.
I don't know what the deal was.
But on the Jewish grandma, there's our experts,
high-colonics, animals.
They're sloganists.
It's in the bag.
Well, there's supposed to be one of those types of scenes in the movie.
So there'd be something to look at.
Is there really?
I don't know.
Grandma Sestita tells me that.
So we'll find out.
Anyway, listen, I want to wish Stan and Laurie and the kids of Mary Christmas
and happy holidays and the same to you.
And everybody stay safe.
Good day.
Good day.
See, I thought I was kidding when I said we were going to play this over.
And it's not getting old yet either.
Just kind of warming up to it now.
Okay, let's take a call from Sandy and Kendall.
Hi, Neil.
The lovely, the voluptuous, the brilliant, the incredible, the tacky Sandy.
How are you?
I'm doing okay.
Happy Hanukkah.
How was your thing so far?
My thing's been good so far, but I need a little motivation.
I've got to buy...
Well, this is your motivation station?
That's why I said before I leave the house, which I can't do.
I'm not the bike.
Before I'm more Christmas present.
And I just can't do it.
I just have no motivation to do it.
You know another great scene?
Remember what Tom Hagen was out there shopping for Christmas presents?
No.
And Salotto and his men pulled him over.
They said we want to talk and they shoved him into the car.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
And then Marlon Branda was out there buying that fruit.
Yeah, that's right.
How about when the scene was going to be...
It goes to show you, Marlon.
Keep your hands off the fruit, baby.
When Michael and Fredo are in Cuba and it's new years.
Oh, yeah.
And he finds out the best scene when he gives them that big kiss.
When he gives them that big kiss and he says, I know it was...
I know it was you, Fredo.
You broke my heart.
You broke my heart.
What a great scene.
And the other thing...
And if I don't see you, I'm going to die.
And the other scene is when Diane Pete tells him she had the abortion.
That's another good scene.
It was a boy, Michael.
It was a boy.
Yeah, and I had it aborted.
It was in a...
In just like our marriage.
Yeah.
You know, that was a good one.
Was that my other line?
No.
Oh, okay.
Now it was just probably the CIA tap.
You know the mob there in the CIA.
They're everywhere.
I know.
It is my other line.
I know these people.
You don't want it.
I know.
Probably some opinion he asked me where the family looking for something for the home.
No, long-lost friend.
We haven't heard from all year.
Now if I answer the phone, I got to buy them for Christmas present.
Oh, speak.
Can I tell you a little story because I feel like I know you.
Okay.
Now months ago, months ago on this show, I mentioned the fact that I went to college with a
sir...
I don't want to mention his name because it would be in Porteis, with a certain person from Philadelphia.
Uh-huh.
And somebody called in because I was telling a funny story about how he couldn't handle his
beer and he puked all over the hall and he swept up and down the hallway and we were...
Our shoes were getting stuck and all.
Well anyway, to make a long story short, somebody called in and they knew him.
And he's written these books and he's bapapapipa and all this other.
So, he called me.
In other words, uh...
He gave him my number and we got in touch and he started calling me.
And you never said his name on the air?
Yes, I have.
Oh, you know.
But I'm not going to mention it now.
Okay, okay.
But to make a long story short, the guy has had a rough life and he's been through drugs.
It's a real messy divorce and just his mind is like Marshmallows.
And he calls me...
What would they...
I'm sitting there watching...
Who knows what?
And he calls me out of the blue.
In fact, it was just before I was getting ready to go to the track and he calls me up.
And he said, I don't know what they...
I didn't make any sense and he said,
Do you...
I'm sure you know what, I'm calling.
I need to get a...
Can you help me with a couple of tickets?
And you know what he...
Oh, he started with a story about how he was leaving the house to go to a wedding.
And his best friend, whose white, is getting married to a black woman and the fam...
I mean, all this pseudo-socialogical and do I know where he can put up a couple of well-behave kids for the night?
And he's calling me. He's in Philadelphia. He's not here.
That's incredible.
And I'm going to tell you, I have no idea what he was talking about.
And it was so scary because he was...
Probably had a few too many before he called you.
He made no sense at all.
I mean, I think he was swallowing perkadan by the bottle for something.
I don't know what it was, but...
I just love those unexpected phones for people you haven't heard from.
Yeah, and I don't know what his story is.
I mean, he's into like wooden mushrooms or something.
I don't know what the deal is, but his e-mails are.
You don't know.
You know, and it's too late.
I mean, like his whole life went by and he's got his thing and I'm doing mine.
And I just... I don't need to know.
I mean, it doesn't fit anymore.
It doesn't fit anymore.
It's okay to...
It's okay to...
It's okay to...
It's okay to...
It's okay to...
It's okay to...
I mean, I've been in the film in 30 years and now it's turned into like a human walking vegetable.
You know, I can't deal with it.
I know what you're saying.
Oh, it was strange.
What did you think of such Christmas present?
What was that?
He's going to be a daddy.
Oh, you know, is that for real or is that a joke?
He's being real-frighted.
Oh, my God.
He's getting here.
I called him out.
Oh, I heard Rick...
Rick was on his way to the airport.
Doug was alone from 530 to 6, and I called him.
And I was the first to give him my sympathy because everybody was congratulating him.
And it was...
It was a definite yes.
Oh!
So, Rick is going to rip him.
Oh.
And what is it Wednesday?
I can't get over it.
How about he can?
It's a definitely yes.
I mean, he's an old guy.
He's in total shock.
It was his family.
Can you imagine that when his kid is about like eight years old and going to school?
It's going to be a big day.
And they say, well, what your...
Does your daddy do?
And they say, oh, he's in a nursing home performer broadcasters?
Oh, God.
For a son.
He's in with vegetables.
They say, what do you mean?
He's in a produce business.
No, he's in a nursing home with a bunch of vegetables.
Yeah.
Did you listen to Larry King, the Saudi Arabia show?
What did they stick him in the desert?
No.
You didn't hear when they projected life to Saudi Arabia through the Army broadcasting and the mutual.
They had it set up.
So for like three hours, like the family would call in.
And it was being heard all over the country.
Oh, and another one of those deals.
No, I didn't hear it.
The first time I heard the man show...
The deal brought this kind of show and say dirty words.
That kind of broadcasting has appealed to a certain element that I do not desire to appeal to.
And you don't?
Is that a recent cart?
Yeah.
I don't know.
I guess so.
Yeah, about a week ago, Manny, who worked so overnight with that.
Well, he actually cried on the radio during the show.
I couldn't believe it.
Well, you know why?
Why?
The makeup mirror in front of him, because it was being televised on C-SPAN.
And we looked in the mirror, he stayed, broke down, he couldn't handle it.
He was practicing his acting skill, huh?
No, he saw his image.
Well, that'll do it.
That'll definitely do it.
Neil, before I go, who's going to the Super Bowl?
I haven't heard you say who's going.
Dolphins and 49ers.
All right.
How's that for confidence?
Good.
And now ask me if I believe it.
I like that.
Well, listen, once the playoffs start, you never know.
Okay, let's hope for the best.
And you know what?
And then maybe Joe Montana will get the kidnab by Lou Holtz,
and they'll go off and get married in Ireland or something.
And we might have a chance against Steve Young, you never know.
You know what?
On your tape, I never did tell you, but my favorite song on your tape
is the Ballad of Neil.
I love it.
And I just want to let you know.
The Ballad of Neil?
The Ballad of Neil.
Neil's Ballad of Neil.
Oh, that thing, yeah.
I love that.
The Resolution of Neil.
That's it.
Whatever the hell it is.
The Ballad of Neil.
Well, I might even play it now.
You should.
I love it.
Okay.
All right.
We're going to have a great New Year.
Your Bobby, a big kiss for all of us, okay?
I will.
And have a great time.
You too.
Bye.
That's Old Sandy from Kendall.
It's a 12.51 at WIOD.
We have an open line in Dade County.
We're not doing too bad for a holiday today.
I can't believe it.
I thought everybody would be like sitting around the fireplace,
roasting their chestnuts, checking out their acorns.
Anyway, if you're wanting to...
Let's get with it.
Well, listen to that cart rattle.
Isn't that good?
751 WIOD.
Let's go to Peppy.
Hello.
How are you, Peppy?
All right.
Listen up.
I tell you why I called.
Yes.
I've listened to you for many, many years.
Seems like a lifetime.
So, yeah.
But many times I've been very upset, very angry.
About what?
About things that you say about the elderly people,
and how you say it.
But let me get to the point.
I'm calling you because I'm calling you to praise you.
I can't get over the fact what you're doing for Camilla South.
I happen to be a fundraiser myself.
I find it so hard to raise even a thousand dollars for courses.
I know.
But what you did, for the courses you did,
all my anger, all my being upset as a raised away,
I just think you are marvelous,
and I would like to give you a donation of $50.
Thank you, Peppy.
That's great.
And I really...
I just cannot get over it.
I'm amazed how they had to do this.
Approved by the following you have,
and in the long run, you're a nice guy.
How about that?
Okay.
Thank you, Peppy.
All right.
I'll send the $50.
I'll tell you why I'm doing it really because very recently,
I had a luncheon of the needy people,
and I omitted the Camilla South,
so this is my chance to make it up through you.
Great. Never too late.
Okay. Thanks, Peppy.
Good work. I just can't get over it.
Bye-bye.
12.56 at WIOD.
By the way, did we miss BuDells?
Checked that coming while I was on vacation,
because I know as soon as I came back,
I had a big check from Ricky Tiki for a couple of hundred.
I want to say it again, sunny hers came through with a big check,
250 this morning, super, just like he did last year.
Great guy.
Hank Goldberg gave me a big check.
So there's some people conspicuous by their absence, right?
What about Tanner and Cox over there at Power 96,
who every never fail, every year come through big time?
What happened this year?
Time stuff over there?
They dying over there?
Let's go to a Pompo-no.
Paulie sold out the old man.
That's through it.
Yeah.
Hey, listen, have a call.
Paulie.
Paulie.
You know what the end of the...
Paulie won't see him no more.
You know what the end of the second movie they show the scene
where Michael tells me and rolled in the army?
Yeah.
Well, let me ask you something,
because I didn't see that making of the movie.
Was that filmed during the first movie
or did they bring it back like James Conn and those people
during the filming of the second movie?
How did they do that?
Ah.
They didn't make that clear.
It must have brought them back.
You think?
Oh, I would think.
Because it looks like it might have been filmed
at the beginning of the first movie they just never used.
Oh, well, that's true.
It could have been footage.
You're right.
That's true, because there's two of them
whatever they want with.
You know, the interesting thing in that HBO special,
they're talking about Michael.
You know, in the first movie when they come to the wedding,
you know, and he's sitting there with Cain,
he's wearing his military outfit, whatever it is.
And in the...
These clips that they're showing,
they must have been when they were all auditioning.
And he's wearing about two or three different uniforms,
none of which are the ones that he wore in a real movie.
But it's some of them are like comically looks ridiculous.
What is that show going to be on again?
I don't know.
You have to look in the TV book.
It's on HBO.
And it's really, it's an hour special.
And it's funny.
The outtakes are hysterical.
I mean, just...
There was one part where they kept telling Al Pacino
that he's going to laugh.
Before they started filming,
they said, you're going to laugh no matter what you do.
And they did.
They all could do ball and James Conner.
All seen there just puking their brains out,
laughing over and over again.
It's hysterical.
I have another question for you.
I've seen the second one about maybe three times.
Yeah.
I'm still confused.
Who tries to kill him in his bedroom?
Is it Pantangely or is it the Jewel Miami?
Oh, yeah, it's Marlansky.
My hymen law.
I'm sorry.
I say Marlansky.
My hymen law.
Same difference.
Yeah.
Frato sold him out.
Right.
And Michael doesn't even...
Isn't really sure until Frato says that in the bar in Cuba.
Right.
Yeah.
You got to admit the second movie is pretty confusing.
Yeah.
You got to see it about a hundred times before you understand.
That's the idea. That's why we've all watched it a hundred times
because we're still trying to figure out what the message is.
Exactly right.
Okay.
All right.
Oscar Manion.
Thank you.
Well, kind of a little defensive part of the music now.
And I think this is a perfect time for us to lead
into our Pensive 1 o'clock WIOD news.
But the very Pensive and Area Knight, Elaine Etor, who's standing by
to bring it the latest and the greatest and the greatest.
And then we'll come back with our gigantic one to two hours.
Don't miss that.
Two o'clock this afternoon we have a radio history in the making.
The Daddy to Be.
Suds and Rick.
Boy, that is incredible.
Are they going to have stilts for that baby or what?
Rick ensuds the best stuff from two to six.
We got a brief, a dolphin...
What is there to say?
A recap on 605 and then we got Christmas music, of course.
Okay, one on nine at WIOD.
Let's go right back to these exciting calls.
Oh, is we going to have a bummer on the first call of the hour?
Surfside.
Hey, now.
Yeah.
Well, that's not your place sometimes.
That little piece from the Parkage family.
It'd be happy.
Something.
What's the exact title that's on?
Come on, get happy.
Come on, get happy.
Is that a nice show of 45?
Was it what?
A 45?
Yeah.
Okay, just wanted to find someone trying to get a habit of seeing it.
Okay.
Okay, let's see.
Oh, I thought it was going to be Eli Turgerman.
See, I'm very nervous.
Any time we get a call from Surfside because Surfside is basically a bunch of douchebags.
We have an open line of dates, 751 and one on a starline for our bell-soft buddies.
Our pals are slime balls star I-O-D.
Four-lotterdale.
Hey, Paison.
Yeah, Paison.
What's the happen?
Hey, you making me wait so long, my ears.
You go to sleep.
Well, that's a good.
Give you some rest.
Hey, listen to part three.
It's a Godfather meet a proper to proper, yeah?
Yeah.
Hey, listen to that too.
Mya Lasky wasn't talking about a whole friend.
He's hiding a rock.
Could you use your hymena rock?
Yeah, mya, hymena.
He had a dream about a pasta.
Solid hemas.
I want to make a big city out in the desert, but something happened to him.
Tell me what happened.
Mo Green.
And what happened?
He went from a size.
Have a good time and tomorrow, Neil.
Okay.
I'll be off.
Okay.
It's 11 a.m.
What?
I'll tell you.
They're going to be lined up for blocks tomorrow, even though it's going to be thank goodness.
It's on Christmas day, right?
Early, they'll all be eaten, right?
There won't be anybody in the movie at the early.
Huh?
Now, they'll all be eaten.
They'll be stuffing their faces with turkey and ham and pala vaude.
Yeah, they'll be stuffing oranges, oranges, oranges, oranges, peels in their mouth.
Chasing little kids around in the flower garden.
Did I punch up line four by mistake in Pemberpine?
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you, guy?
Okay.
Listen, I got a good store for you here.
Okay, we can find one.
This one.
Remember, I told you in about all month and a half, like I told you, over Miami.
And the guy, the cop, is all pissed off about.
No, you don't want to be.
Listener, this guy.
Yeah.
Back to your other car and all the other crap.
Uh-huh.
So I got off from the judge the other day.
I got my Neil shirt on.
And once he got your remote, I'll print this back in the phone, right?
Yeah.
I bought myself 10 tapes for Christmas presents, which are going to make real good Christmas presents.
Right.
So I'll stand in there.
And the judge turns out to be a Nelly.
Wow.
He's heard of James.
And listen to you whenever he gets a chance.
There's the else.
I'll explain my case to the guy, right?
I told him I said, look.
I ran the yellow line.
It is my fault.
Well, you know, we got all the judges in our pockets, you know.
Damn, right.
I told him I said, you know, I'm not trying to beat the case.
I did run the yellow line right back to it.
But you know, this guy is not after professional at all.
I said, the guy said, Nelly, to rap to me, telling me that he did know.
I'm offended him because my radio is on.
And he don't like listening to this Neil Rogers guy and all this other crap.
And I got my Neil shirt on.
So the judge turned around and did.
Through the case, I told him I said, look, I said this guy.
He said, to spend the descendants.
I said, spend the descendants.
He said, he turned around.
And I said, look, I said, this guy Neil Rogers, I feel like I'm the only guy in the city right here that's doing stuff for the people who ain't gotten nothing to eat.
People who ain't got no place to sleep.
This Camilla House project, the guy's got almost $100,000.
I contributed $200 in my own money to buy taste for Christmas presents.
If I turn around and said you paid your, you're just due right there.
There you go.
What a judge.
Hey, that son.
Hey, listen, you know that guy in light, lady?
Wolf, where's she the fox, huh?
Who?
The guy in light, lady.
The one that gives you your updates on the guy in light.
Did I meet her?
Oh, she found her, uh, she found your photograph on her, uh, on your picture out the remote.
The guy in light, lady.
You mean the not-slanding lady?
No, the guy in light, lady.
The guy in light, lady.
The guy in light, lady.
Yeah, you remember, she only caused one short flight.
I mean, she got long black hair.
I'm gonna sit right next to a pink with fine kids.
Did she tell me she was the guy in light, lady?
I think she did.
In fact, she said she was gonna take the shows for you when you couldn't see him.
You remember that?
I said, back in the middle of house going on.
Okay, have a good one, pal.
Thanks.
114 to W.I.
If Don Corleone had all the politicians and the judges in his pocket, he should share, right?
He must share.
Naturally, he can present a bill for a services because, after all, we're not communists.
Who is that actor that played the Don Barzini?
What is his name?
Very well-known actor.
Oh, now, so, now there's a good trivia question.
Is Chuck Meyer-Listing dead or alive for that actor who played Don Barzini?
He's not, he wasn't like somebody obscure.
He's a very...
Oh, geez.
I mean, we got far enough with Don Tomasino.
You got it already?
No, we don't have it yet.
Okay, and if we ever get Line 5 picked, somebody could have called in on Line 5 and Broward
with the answer to the question.
Oh, gee, there's a B in the name.
Who's with a B?
Get Mickey Dane on the phone right away.
Who's with a B?
In 19, at W.I.
They were just seven-oat.
But went by pretty fast today.
I'll tell you that.
It is really zoomed by 87,000, 843,
our Camille House total plus.
Who knows how much in-house somewhere.
I mean, T.C., you must have a lock in the closet, all the mail from Friday.
And then there's a whole bunch from Saturday and today and no mail tomorrow.
So Wednesday, we ought to have a flood.
Even Noah would be impressed by...
Even Yonic Noah would be impressed by what we're going to open up on Wednesday in the mail, too.
So we should be over 90,000 easy.
In fact, by the end of this week, we'd be up there 95, maybe pressing that $100,000 mark.
I think next week is the week we go over.
And of course, a week from this Friday, in a week and a half, on the 4th of January,
we'll be doing our next remote at Calder Race Course.
We'll be doing our whole show there live from 10 to 2.
Bring your money, plunge your brains out, and to bring some for Camille House 2.
Del Ray Beach.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
We have a little present here.
From President Bush.
Okay, that's his second call.
Remember the first, like the first two or three minutes?
Okay, have a great day, pal.
And stick your record with the Mondo and Shine.
Miami Shores.
Hey, Neil.
How you doing?
I'm doing fine.
How you doing?
Excellent.
Listen, did you, I know you loved the Godfather movies.
Did you ever read the book?
Yeah, the book was better on movies.
Oh, great.
But the movie was one of the closest movies to a book I've ever seen.
Yeah.
The book is always better.
Yeah, I want to read high treason.
Boy, you're really ought to.
But, see, I'm like 35 years old when I'm 36.
And 20 years ago, I figured out that Nixon was like basically behind the whole thing.
Can't stand that, man.
You have two cards.
You have to pick one out for me.
I'm trying to quit smoking.
One of your front-age cards that haven't heard since a long time is like the band that's playing smoke until you choke.
Yeah.
That's hysterical.
That and the one with a guy with, you just played the guy with the bandit, the person or the room.
The one you just played a few minutes ago.
Yeah, the guy's brother.
Yeah.
Okay, that's the one with.
By the guy with a jail and all that, which is hysterical.
Yeah, just played that last week.
Oh, it did.
That's Dick Prick.
And another thing, I'm real sorry about Bill Paulder.
Yeah.
My wife used to work at the station there.
She says he's one of the nicest guys she ever met.
Sure was.
And we're missing.
And you have a happy Chanooka and all the other stuff.
But if you can get one of those cards, either one, I'd really appreciate it.
And have a good day off tomorrow and we'll listen to you Wednesday.
Okay, have a good night.
Okay, 122, no chance.
We have an open line in Dave County, 7519463.
We'll go to North Miami.
Mo Green lives.
Yeah.
I don't think Mo's going back there for a rub down.
That's right.
I think I really had to save you.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
See you.
Well, it was, it was appropriate.
Ah, is this audience on top of things or what?
Richard Coday played Don Barzina.
Richard Coday's like, you know, big time actor.
He's been around a long time.
Character actor.
Very good.
And fit that role perfectly.
And also the old guy who played the guy with the horse's head, the Hollywood producer.
He's another one.
Character actor been around.
Everybody and their brother was in that movie.
And that's the point they made in that HBO special.
And making Godfather 1, 2 and 3 is that just about everybody in the world.
It came in audition for those parts.
Everybody was, you know, the one thing I'm not hearing anything about and maybe just as well.
One of the only person I see in Godfather 3 other than Coppola's daughter, who makes no sense at all, is George Hamilton IV.
I cannot stand George Hamilton IV.
The sight of him makes me nauseous.
He is just something about him.
He's halosious, okay?
And they couldn't get the Robert Duvall because he wanted too much money.
He wanted a 3.5 million or something.
They didn't want to cough up the money because Coppola's daughter needed the bucks and his father and the whole family.
So they bring in George Hamilton IV to be the new family lawyer.
And I just can't see it.
I just can't not envision it, okay?
Unless they got a bag over it.
Maybe he'll be the bag man.
Starline and Broward.
Yeah, that me.
That's you.
Oh, hey.
Um, am I on the air or what?
It sure sounds like it.
Oh, hey.
That's my first time on a call.
Incredible.
How was it so far?
Pretty good.
Pretty exciting?
Yeah.
We're on high 95 coming down from E-Ha Junction.
Yeah, how the E-Ha is doing?
Yahoo's.
Very, very good.
Pretty boring.
You know, I call if I'm supposed to get.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm from Orlando and we just drove to that earlier.
This morning, that's going to be hell when it gets down here.
Nah, it's going to be like 73 tomorrow and it's going to be back up in the mid-70s and
then by the end of the week up in the 80s again.
Well, it's pretty miserable in the rain.
Up there.
Yeah, that's Orlando.
It's a Mickey Mouse town pal.
Yeah, Mickey Mouse.
It's a Yahoo place.
A bunch of red necks in the douchebags up there.
Yeah, you got that right.
A bunch of orange pickers.
Yeah, I'm a native of the town Miami.
Now you're talking.
You were here when it was the real place.
Yeah.
Well, listen, have a great holiday.
How are you, too?
Okay.
Hey, listen, that's it.
124 at WIOD.
We have an open line on the star line.
It's star IOD.
I should recap some of the stuff I mentioned at the beginning of the show because it's a holiday
and people are busy.
They're busy doing stuff.
Okay, they have a life today for a few days.
This is the one time of the year when many people have a semblance of a life.
Not much, but a little bit.
And our horse at Pompoonopark, our WIOD Stable Horse Christmas list.
Great race Thursday with Vilfe driving Camino a second, just barely beaten second.
It has made almost, let's see, made 4,500 and 1,257, 150 bucks in just three starts.
We had 700 people who showed up Thursday with their passes.
So they're still 700 alive to assure that Jack, Jackpot at the end of April.
And I think this coming Sunday, next Sunday, which is the last Sunday that we're racing at Pompoonopark,
who is going to be his next star.
But I'll let you know toward the end of the week for sure.
And we told you the Camino's house total.
It seems to me like I'm forgetting something.
Like, and suds is going to be a father.
That just knocks me off my ass. I can't believe that.
God, just a little bit of caution.
Let's go to a lady in plantation.
Bonestata.
I had.
Bonestata.
Bonestata.
That was John Morley that played.
The Hollywood producer, right?
And who's dead as a door nail?
So Richard Conti is dead too, but okay.
Are you serious?
Okay, Chuck Meyer, two great dead of relives.
That's right.
Richard Conti, he was very good.
Excellent actor.
Well, everybody was good and Godfather won.
There was nobody who was marked that.
That's one exception to the role in the eye, I think,
where the movie was better than the book.
No, I don't know.
You read the book?
Of course I read the book.
And you thought the movie was better?
Yes, absolutely.
I thought the movie was one of the best of all time.
Oh, there's no question about that.
The movie was just beyond belief.
Tessio, it was great.
That was Abe Gota, right?
And Clemenza was Richard Castellano.
Right.
Is he dead?
Yeah, he just died recently.
Yeah, that's right.
Well, one a little bit too much pasta there.
Remember, he was no too much sugar in that sauce.
And a little too much red wine.
Throw in your sausages and meatballs, too many canollies.
And that's a little bit of red wine.
Yeah, he would have left the canole in the car with Polly.
There you go.
He'd still be alive today, probably.
You'll remember him part two when he goes to seek revenge
on the death of his father.
Right.
Do you remember his father's name?
His father's name?
Yeah, it wasn't Corleon.
That was the town they came from.
Right.
Your member's father's name?
Oh, wait a minute.
George does.
What is it?
What is it, Mesa?
Andolini.
There you go.
Vito Andolini.
Alberto.
Alberto?
Alberto Andolini.
And this is for you.
Yeah, he says an Italian.
My name is, oh, my name is, or no, I'm here for, uh...
I'm here for my father.
Alberto Andolini.
And this is for you.
And he takes the knife and he's right up the puppet up into the...
Oh, and the blood comes just squirting out.
It's wonderful.
It sits back in the chair like he's got bad heartburn.
I don't think he's going to get up from the chair.
Oh, that was great.
I am looking forward to tomorrow with great anticipation.
Yeah, I'm afraid though.
It's, you know, after reading the review,
although, you know, these movie reviewers, they don't know from nothing.
If the public loves it, which we probably will,
then they'll say, well, you know, it's going to be an epic
and a classic and right in line with one and two.
Yeah, they don't know.
What the hell?
It's got to be good, Neil.
Yeah.
I mean, you know.
I only wish, though, that Robert Duval.
I know.
That would have been the icing on the cake.
Instead of that sappy daughter of his, you know?
She meets Kaito Watt.
Yeah.
She's got a schnauz, and make Larry King and Beres.
And lip.
Yeah.
Like St. Louis.
Anyway, Neil.
You guys threw last week like a pro.
Yeah.
Really?
Got a...
I had no choice.
It was a very difficult, but, you know.
You're a munch.
Life is for the living.
That's what they say we've got to go on.
There you go.
Have a wonderful holiday.
And you too.
And can't wait for tomorrow.
Okay.
Town-yell.
Boy, boy.
128 at WIOD, one of our rear, but very welcome lady callers.
Today she was outstanding.
All of Broward lines.
Both of the ones that are working are open now.
524 WIO.
Springs.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How's it going today?
Excellent.
Very good.
And the same to you in Happy New Year and whatever.
Likewise, Happy Hunter.
Uh-huh.
Listen, what...
I heard Hank had the trouble out in Santa Monica,
writing a car.
He did?
You hear about that?
I didn't hear it.
He, uh...
We're going to write him a station wagon or a van.
Yeah.
And, uh...
That just wasn't up to his speed.
He needed a nice car for...
Uh...
hitting the Santa Monica night spot,
to the hot spot,
to where he put it.
Right.
Now, you know, what is it with Hank and the women?
I can't quite...
I can't quite get a read on him, like Larry King was saying.
What is it?
Yeah, I mean, he's always bragging about, you know,
all getting all these blinds and...
Well, you asked me a question.
I may give you a one word answer.
If you would please.
Uh... fantasy.
Okay.
I don't know.
I have no idea.
Hank is a great guy and all of that.
But I don't know anything about his, uh...
personal life.
I know he's always said that, like everybody else,
if he wants something, he's willing to pay for it.
But, you know...
Okay, that makes sense to him,
because I remember back in 1983, I was at the forage.
Oh, in other words, I think he's bisexual,
if he wants it, he got a buy-in.
But that could be why.
I don't know.
Gotcha.
And Neil, do you remember your trip?
I'm not talking like a hooker on 7.
Nice, we'd I'm talking about a little more,
a little more respectable.
Fantasy.
Out of the phone book.
There you go.
I'm with you, because I saw him at the forage back in 83.
Like Angel's fantasies.
One of those great places, you know.
Yeah, he had the greatest blonde I'd ever seen.
Of course.
You remember your trip up to Tampa with big day from Highline?
From Highline?
Yeah, big day.
So you've been answered Highline?
Dave Lennon.
Right.
Big day left.
Well, which trip to Tampa?
We made several trips to Tampa.
You made a trip up there.
I guess it was you, him.
Dave Lennon.
For Hurricane Hillsport.
You went to Bird's Daycow.
Yeah.
