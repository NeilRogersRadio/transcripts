Summer 1990 is the summer of Dick Tracy. You'll see the movie. Listen to the soundtrack
where the T-shirt and read the comic book. And now just in time for Father's Day,
you can enjoy the fragrance that was inspired by the movie, the soundtrack,
the T-shirt and the comic book. New Dick Tracy Cologne. Why smell like other guys?
Now you can smell like Dick. And don't forget tonight's a big night down in
Fantzoo's days with Rick and Clutz from 8 to midnight. Rick and Clutz and Dick.
It's 1016 at WIOD. Let's take a call in Boka.
Deal. Yeah. How you doing? Okay. I don't want to come on too heavy here.
Friend of mine. Well, don't worry. You're not.
Don't want to be 20. I don't know if that counts.
Friend of mine just got a job as a political cartoonist.
First cartoon he did was
was about flag-burning.
I wanted to let you know about it. It's split into
two different sides of the panel. The first side shows an American hippie, so to speak,
burning the American flag. He's considered a communist anti-American,
anti-patriot. The second half is a picture of a Chinese student burning the Chinese flag.
He's considered a patriot. Yeah. Defender. Yeah.
What were we gnashing our teeth in? Didn't we cut off relations with China until
Georgia discovered it wasn't such a good idea? Exactly. Because they were doing that,
because they were attacking all those kids and shooting them and taking away
their right of free descent. You see the problem in this country is lack of education.
I mean most people must come either farthest they can go is the Simpsons and Murray Tyler Moore.
And that's about the extent of their mentality. So don't confuse them with a concentration.
Because they don't even know what it means. Right. They think that the first amendment means
that anything is okay as long as they approve of it. And anything they don't like should be banned.
And that's America. Okay. I mean this I got to be honest with you.
This is a pretty second rate country. It's name what it used to be. Okay. It's pretty embarrassing.
Right. I really mean that. It's a second rate embarrassing country.
Exactly. You know, and everybody's so excited about Europe. They laugh at us.
They think we're like a laughing stock word joke. Right. We look at each and Europe going,
oh, it's great. Everybody's going to be able to say what they want to say and do what they want to do.
Yeah, but not here. Exactly. Maybe we have to move to Yugoslavia. Right.
Exactly. Right. You know, this whole two life cruising after playing the
game in your home, what happened there? Can the police come to your door?
That'll be next. When Sheriff Nick sticks his head in the door to start slipping around to see if he violated that ordinance.
You're going through your CD collection to somebody on the walk up the sheriff Nick and say, oh, by the way, Nick.
Sheriff's cheek. Um, I'm sick. SSI CK. Seek. SS for short, sir.
So he's not just not see pig whisper in his ear. Nick. I'm thinking about who that crew.
You don't understand that the powers in Broward, because they're just going, now they're having a field day now.
They would love dearly to go back to the days. I don't know how long you've been here.
But years ago, uh, Broward was noted. People ran there together. They didn't want Jews.
They didn't want blacks. They certainly didn't want Hispanics.
The good. Of course it's ironic that Nick. I guess he thinks he's the token Cuban for all of Broward County.
So he's okay, but nobody else has permitted because basically that's where this mentality comes from.
Right. Try to clean up. Even in a locust colony, they never saw so many wasps.
Okay, that's how I'm burst. They're trying to get all the undesirable. That's correct.
And you know, who does that, you know, who does that preclude most of us?
Right. Have a great day. Thank you, sir.
What the hell are we getting serious now? See, we had such a good time.
It's spec yesterday. Life is great. Everything is wonderful.
And I and I now I feel like I'm going to start expending all this energy again and get sick for nothing.
It's not worth it because nobody gives a crap. Okay.
They're all in their own little stupid lives and are too ignorant to understand what the hell these things mean.
Oh, gee, you can't burn the flag. That's unpatriotic. That's how bush got in the first place.
Running around all the flag companies, holding wave in the flag, you know, with Martha Washington standing next to him with the white wig or Betsy Ross, whoever the hell she is.
That's not his wife. That's Betsy Ross.
Palm Beach.
Yeah. Yeah. Unbelievable.
Yes. I tell you it's not going to change. You know, it's going to happen.
Yeah. I may ask something. What they sell those dice days and dice man, aren't they? Yeah. He's white. He be white.
He's white. What what what that's one of the scenes? What are they talking about? I got pulled out.
No, William Consel was on this morning. I can't mention the other person he was on with on the CBS morning news.
So you can use your own imagination. But William Consel was on there and he put it right on the money. Nothing should be obscene.
As far as adults are concerned, I mean, yeah, what's going to be next? You can't go into a bookstore and buy lady chatter at least lover of the traffic of cancer or patent places.
That could be next because they're full of all those words. I mean, everyone I'm interestingly enough.
It was the guy from the focus on the family who uttered all the four letter words on Donnie who this morning and the show aired yesterday afternoon live and a half a dozen
made your markets all over the country and film made him a apology. No, it's not okay. And feel they apologize and made an ass out of
them later in the show because here he's attacking all these other musicians and he's the one who had the audacity would not having any idea how many
millions of people I watch in life. He had to be compelled to use all of these four letter words, including the F word on national TV. Very nice.
Very nice. Well, I say douchebag right away. They're having a nervous breakdown. What about the whole of these hypocrites kidding?
Huh? Look in their own closets, man. That's where you'll find all the skeletons right in their own closets.
And look at Texas hot on the bandwagon. I say it's actually next to be next to what's the next state of Hawaii where you got Texas.
Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Missouri. Don't you understand? It's a redneck Yahoo country.
It's a bunch of racist, anti-Semitic disgusting pigs. That's what this country is deteriorated into. Okay?
Well, I say it's certainly not that have a nice day.
Hmm?
22 after 10. I think we cut them short there. Well, I don't want to get hysterical about this. Is it worth getting my blood pressure up again? No.
This is what I did for 12 years and what the hell they're giving me got me a stroke. What the hell is it going to accomplish?
Getting all these people hysterical.
Crank it up. Open that window. Crank it up as loud as it'll go. Okay?
Even in the house. Maybe they'll come into your house and bust your ass. Okay?
Anybody with a brown shirt comes to your door today. Lock the door and don't call the police.
I don't want you to stay on pause. I've got pop up.
What do I got to take issue there? See, when he starts in with our sitting at a hall, I think maybe they've got a point.
23 after 10. It's just a joke, Luther. Don't get all hysterical. It's just a little joke.
Because basically, I think your music is garbage, but what I think is not important. Okay? See, that's the whole issue.
That's the whole point. I mean, a lot of people who think that all these forms of art are garbage too.
And they just use that as an excuse for the bigotry. All right?
Everything is subjective. If you don't like it, don't buy it. Don't watch it. Don't listen to it. Okay? Simple as that.
Attention, K-Mont Shoppers. We have a lost little girl. She's 19 years old, all-burned hair, green eyes, 36, 24, 34, and answers to the name event.
She said she lost her daddy and needs a new one. Will all prospective dandies please form a double line outside the manager's office?
And please have a recent bank statement or stock portfolio with you. Thank you.
Thank you, Ernie. 27 after 10 at WIOD Miami. Yeah, Neil, where is this? Where is this? I'll refer into the...
You know, I don't know what I need to say to make it clear to you. Okay? We don't make references to him. We went through two years... I went through two and a half years of hell. Okay? I'm not going to do it again.
Let somebody else be the great crusader in this community. We aren't going to talk about him, okay? We can, but we won't.
Because we've allowed prudence to take over where emotion used to rule. Okay? If you want to grieve, you go deal with him. Okay? I don't.
And either does management. Okay? So it ain't going to happen. Miami. Neil. Yeah? How you doing? Okay. I just want to change this up.
It's a little bit. Yes, sir. I just want those mats, huh? You shouldn't bring that up. Yeah. I just want to say...
Let's raise it. Both those teams really bite the big one. Let's be honest about it. Next topic. Okay. I just want to say a real short call here.
Sometimes that gets bad. You know, you're in specs and you should keep the good work up. You look fantastic. I'm doing pretty good. I'm doing great.
You look fantastic. Well, I wouldn't go that far. Oh, really? It's all relative. We had a pretty interesting crowd on there yesterday. Good crowd.
Well, I think I wonder how many came for the food and how many came for Gilbert. That's the problem. Well, that's probably true.
But I just want to let you know you're doing a good job and keep up the good work and you look great. Thank you, sir. Okay. Have a good bye.
29 past 10 at WIOD, your friendly station for the 90s. We have an open line indeed. WIOD.
I'm looking forward to seeing Dick tomorrow. Hold on. No, that's tonight. WIOD.
Neil? Yeah. You're a very friendly guy and everything like that is the way I know. WIOD. Yeah. Yeah.
I sent you a package from an old version. From what? I sent a UPS a couple days ago.
What package you want? A 40 inch tape for the old bird version of sometimes I feel. Yeah, I just got it.
Okay. It's great. And make your day. Okay. Thank you. I like WIOD. Airborne.
Okay. One open line indeed. One in Broward 751 WIOD and Dave and 524 in Broward. Well, in fact, what? Oh, there's a tape over there. I haven't had a chance to WIOD.
Is this Kelvin? Get out of here pal WIOD. Hey Neil, I do it. Okay. I got some to tell you. You know, when you were playing at
me so horny on the radio, I pulled into my car and it was a sheriff's car. Yeah. And I turned a brilliant
loud put my way down. Yeah. The way to him is to give me the finger. All right. He said you're number one.
He gave me the finger. All right. What does that tell you? That tells me the anti-racon coming in my cake.
Exactly. I couldn't have said it. I agree with you. Seek Navato sir. That's it with an SS in the beginning SS IC case.
Seek Navato. I couldn't believe it. I'm going to step. I'm going to step. I'm going to step. You know, it's amazing to me because
somebody was telling me yesterday at their motor. I don't know if you were listening, but on radio mum be one of these hysterical right wing
Cuban stations that we have in Dave County that somebody brought my name up the other day and a commentator started in
this big harang and I'm a clansman. I'm this a communist. You know, it's amazing that the same people who allegedly came here,
these old line old Cubans, the ones who listen to R. H. C. and Cuban radio radio mum be these that is like Nick.
Seek Navato. These are the same ones that come here. I want to impose repression on everybody who doesn't agree with
them. You know, it's in this big. That on ever since I can remember the old line right wing Cubans who think
Batista was great. Fashion is great. Everybody to the left of the Attila. The hon is communist. The communist. The communist. The man
it is old and his ponderous give it a rest. I couldn't believe it. The man I got in my car, you started playing it and I
I must have went three lanes over just to get his face. Good. Turn it up. He gave it a finger. Excellent. I can't believe it.
Well, you got to a pound. I want his badge numbers. Okay. I want his belt buckle numbers. That's right. I want his drawer.
And says 69. You got it, man. Good luck, you sir. Take care. Frank it up, folks. Frank the window, Donna. Frank it up loud.
So for your 1205 this afternoon right after noon news, we're going to play this in its entirety or at least how much of a time we got.
I'm glad you want to just get in the hop in the car just to tool up the highway all over South Florida because it's the clean
version they can. They try to name your ass. So the crap out of Mokei. That's what we need right. Well more lawsuits for playing obscene
material in the car, right? Well, I'm telling you this town. This is nuts. This state is nuts. We ought to have it like a new
symbol. Are you going to cart that up for me? It's the least you can do. No, that's the birth one. What we do? Well, give it a listen.
Okay. I mean, we can't play all your material. I noticed you've got it all lined up there like in a row. Like we're going to have like a tribute.
It's all great, but let's get serious. What's that going to say? Yeah, let's have a new male. Are you okay now? You're going to be all right. He's not well.
He's just so emotional and hysterical. Just ask Johnny Dark. He knows it's all a bunch of crap. Johnny Dark, by the way, added the element that we needed to
build. It's called psychosis. That's just what we need. It was Johnny Dark around here. Let's have somebody make a big map of the state of Florida.
Just the outline of it with a big swastika like right in the middle. Like about where like Okitobi is. Okay. I think that would be good.
Let's go to a mobile in Boka. That's gone up yours. Coral Springs. Hello. More and Neil. Yes, sir. If you're going to put one of those maps
on the floor down there, you better you better make sure you cover it up. Otherwise, it'll probably be deemed well. You're right. I never thought about that. The
phallic element there probably get the lot of people very upset. Very nervous, especially right between Dayton Palm Beach counties. Oh, Neil, you know,
talking about the censorship thing in the Miami Herald or the Wavel Herald in the English edition on page 1G below Dave Berries.
Colin, there's a great article in the Herald. That's unusual. I know. But it's about devil worship, you know, with these little kids that want to put on a
place. And you were talking about the first amendment, you know, being an education thing. And I think after you read about maybe the first six
pair of asses of this article, your whole focus will come right into view. I mean, what they call education in this country. My dogs would laugh at.
Okay. People in this country have no concept of what the first amendment, anything about the law about the bill or rights about anything.
There's no nothing period. All I know is about MTV and a lot of stupid crap and the Simpsons and whatever happens to be hot on a given day.
You know, and inside edition and outside edition and who slept with who? And it's it's pathetic. And man, we're going to pay a wicked price for it.
Okay. Keep your passport handy, sir. I'm hanging on to it tightly. I'm hanging on to it too. Thanks, Neil. See you later, but not too tight. W.I. O. Dean.
If anybody wants to get a copy of that, recycled records. Yeah, I know. We don't we don't talk to a super day or Mr. Radio or anybody who knows them W.I. O.D.
Yeah. This is now in calling for Neil and Carl Springs.
Elven and Carl Springs. Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We'll be right with you, ma'am. Briefly. 1034. I can't believe that at W.I. O.D. we want to tell you about Low Jack right now, ma'am.
Don't die.
It's not the end of the day.
Why is it going to be fine?
Don't die.
Oh, wait a minute. Are they rapping? Is that like a rap?
Let's get the judge in here to decide before we continue.
It's not the end of the day.
That's why it's it's going to be fine.
Oh, why is not a bad word?
It's 1038 at W.I. O.D. and let's W.I. O.D.
Hello.
The vaunted vocal line.
Yes. This is a... this is... hello.
Yes, I'm here.
I can't hear you.
How about now. Is that better?
No.
How about now? You hear me?
Much better.
Okay. What do you want?
I don't know.
Well, good. Let's go to Elven and Carl Springs and get it over with. Yes, Elven.
Oh, hold on a second. We got a mobile in Broward. Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Aren't you glad I discovered that? Yes, thank you.
I'm Buck Rogers.
Yeah.
And my first album is this dirtier than they ever could be.
And my first song is Beat Nick with my stick.
Okay.
I'm going to make a million dollars and we'll get a watch.
No, 10 million.
Okay, great.
Okay. See ya.
I'll get half.
Okay, Elven. I'm sorry. That was very important, Carl.
Hi, Neil.
Yeah. I tried to call you yesterday.
Hold on, Elven. W-I-O-D.
Hello. What a funky meal.
Oh, you're mobile, right?
Yeah.
You'll wait right, Elven.
Yeah, I'm still here.
Okay. Yes, sir.
Hello.
Yeah.
Let me say it again. Hello.
Yeah.
These mobile colors today.
What are you all brain dead or what?
Yeah, man. Who's this?
Who the hell do you think it is?
Is it Neil?
It's Hick Navato.
Okay. I have my SS belt on right now.
Okay.
Hick Navato.
Come onista, come onista, come onista.
Yeah.
What do you want?
Hey, you're going to spy reports.
Okay.
You ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.
Okay.
Well, if you don't get to it pretty soon, man,
we're going to pass out.
We're going to pass out.
What is it?
It's a deal.
Okay, I'll go ahead.
God.
It's not enough just to make you have an apoplectic fit.
It's along with these people.
They're nuts.
Anyway, I have to choose.
What's your story that you use?
You're brighten up your day, Elven.
Yeah, I'll bet.
Oh, here's the bookie boy's practice.
I don't want to post the call.
This is Jason's mom.
Yeah, I know.
Okay.
Hold on a second.
Hold on a second.
I'll.
W-Y-O-D.
Yeah, I'll.
Now with that's phony voice.
W-Y-O-D.
Hold on.
Okay.
What is it now?
I helped him board in my court vet and thought he'd surprised me and get me a new convertible.
Uh-huh.
I won't give the name of the age and say, Chris, I said what's your story?
Oh, hold on a second.
W-Y-O-D.
Yeah, Chris, we can go for it.
Sure.
Okay.
Now what is it?
So he boarded in the car.
Got a new one.
Beautiful red convertible.
He went to work and came back later in the afternoon to pick up the car.
Mm-hmm.
The car is sitting out front with the top down.
Goes to my old car, gets all my stuff to bring him to the new car.
Oh, well.
And he turns around to the salesman and says,
if someone's sitting in that car out there, who's there?
I don't worry about it.
It's nobody.
Turns around talkroom, turns around again.
Cause gone.
Never saw it again.
That was the one you bought.
It was gone.
The one he bought.
The one he bought.
Wow, there's more.
There's others.
Yeah.
Well, the salesman was at least concerned about someone sitting there.
Well, maybe he had a load jacket in it.
That's what they needed.
So I finally got the new one.
That we could out.
Uh-huh.
But they never found the car.
Oh, that's good.
They weren't getting stolen.
They weren't getting stolen.
Well, I got it in my garage.
Don't let the word out.
No.
Go as nice to have a spear.
Yeah.
How you feeling, Neil?
Very good.
Yeah.
It sound great.
Oh, well, that's okay.
I'm glad you got it.
I just thought I'd brighten up your day with my little sword.
Yeah, it sure did.
It made my day on.
I'll tell you, I'm just ready to dance a jig.
Yeah, well, don't you love the Corvette, though?
Yes, I do.
I love it.
There's nothing in a world like a Corvette.
Nothing.
I love my Corvette.
I'm obsessed.
I love going to.
Okay.
Well, it was a nice talk and see you.
See you, Alan.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
1042 at WIOD.
We have an opening in Broward, where if you move very fast now,
524, I've seen.
Whoops.
WIOD.
1042 at WIOD.
Oh, he said Luther.
Well, I couldn't hear.
I cannot see if you...
If I can understand what you're saying, it helps.
Okay.
I don't want to see him paranoid, but I'm just taking all per caution.
WIOD.
Burk and be jerkin.
Yeah.
Let's go to Lake Worth.
Hello.
Hi.
It's a snail.
Yes.
Hi, Nailed.
I'm a first time caller and I just want you to get sick.
You have to stay healthy to try to be in charge of this ridiculousness.
In charge of what?
Oh, just...
Keep in our spirits up against all these crazy people.
I guess what I'm calling about.
I watched Donahue and got totally absolutely insane.
I don't want to talk about it.
Okay.
All right.
You have a good day.
Don't you understand?
I can't talk about the one Neanderthal.
And that's it.
I mean, there's no point in time.
Donahue was a show.
They're just making a circus out of it.
Don't you understand?
You can see them all screaming and carrying on and having a nervous breakdown.
They're just making a new aside show like Sally Jessie, like a freak show.
Well...
That's not the point.
The point is we're living right here in the middle of it.
That's what I'm talking about.
It's like this state has been transformed into a Nazi Germany.
Absolutely.
And to make my point is that the one thing I can't remember is named that things about suicide.
I very much for it.
Let's get with this.
This is real stuff.
I had a son that committed suicide.
Let's keep brushing all this under the rug and keep singing Mary Pop and songs.
Let's get real about what's happening with life.
And I have a son that's a punk rock singer.
And I'm for...
You know, this is real stuff, folks.
You can walk around and put on your little church hat and act like nothing's happening.
But there's some real stuff out there that people want to get real.
Okay, if you don't...
Well, in the world of Reagan and Bush, we don't...
We just say, don't say no to drugs.
Just say no to drugs.
Just say no to everything bad into the tooth fairy and all this other thing.
Everything will be just fine as somebody used to say.
Everything will be just fine.
That's why we need you to stay well so we can at least...
Well, I'm here to have a good time.
I'm not going to be...
I'm not going back to that stuff anymore.
Don't have to get sick.
No way.
Okay, hang in there.
Okay, bye-bye.
I'm hanging.
I'm going without running.
My heart's about to die.
It's love good.
Okay, let me ask you this.
I want to give you a hypothetical situation.
You're in your convertible.
And you're much more than convertible at a stoplight.
Okay?
And it's a bomb, kind of, a breezy day.
And maybe they're these old farts sitting next to you in their big continental or their big civill.
And maybe they got the window cracked open because they're too cheap to run a air conditioning.
Okay?
And you and your friends are having an animated heated argument.
And one of you others, a few F words.
And another one says the SH word.
And they're feeling like a bunch of explets are coming.
What's the difference?
Are they going to arrest you for that now?
Public obscenity by uttering words?
You see, this is the war.
You remember the movie The War of the Worlds?
Now we have the War of the Words, the Dirty Words.
Okay?
This is so juvenile and so childish, it's pathetic.
Pathetic.
Miami.
You know they haven't been in the hour of our Bruce Lee.
Yeah, I know.
They're whole, that's radio's broken.
Sure.
Whatever you want to hold.
Briefly.
Opalaka.
Good morning, sir.
When is this?
Come at least I can tell.
Yeah, you know, I think sure I can smell one a mile away, sir.
I can smell a commie pinco pig a mile away.
But I think sure, if that's really it's out to grab headlines and press coverage.
He's just a self-promoting fool, sir.
He's just a self-promoting jackass.
Yes, I do.
I remember when he ruined that drug bust because they put it on national TV and they had to throw the case out of court.
And then of course when he was going to put the tent up and the federal judge threatened to throw his stupid ass in jail.
And he had a back down on it.
He's nothing but a publicity grabbing jackass, okay?
I don't like your nose.
Yes.
Facebook.
I'm a part of that.
Like I said.
You're a cup fan.
They both suck.
But I love the game.
Why do two?
That's what it's about.
I didn't love it too much so yesterday, I think, because I got home and it was still ahead.
I got home just in time when we were starting to get the crappy out of the seventh inning of the first game.
I know.
It was pretty grim.
It was, but still, if the game is great, it's the institution.
The only thing worse than watching the way we're pitching is that any of Harry made a good point yesterday.
We got Sandberg and Dawson and Dunston are having like career years.
I mean, they're just going crazy.
And it's all, you might as well throw it down the toilet because when you score six, seven, eight, ten runs a game and you still can't win a game,
you've got a problem and it's called a bunch of minor league pitchers.
It's probably when I play when I was younger, if we get out there and get a good hit, get all the way around the third and then everybody strikes.
That's right.
That's the way to do it.
It's like they've parked standing there on third base.
Help me!
Help me!
Now, better luck to us all.
Take care.
Adios.
10-47 at WIOD.
We be doing it today. I'll tell you that.
Let's go to Hellendale. Hello.
Hey, Neil, what's up, man?
Ficking your fascist places. Let's go to Hellendale.
Yeah, I'm out here torturing the old, you know, running my mouth.
Good.
So, I think we should just nuke the church ladies and move to Australia. How about it?
Okay.
All right.
Well, no doubt under. Can we say that?
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay. We'll talk to you later now.
I bet. That's what I'm afraid of.
10-47, I think still. Well, that was along 30 seconds.
And we have an open line in Hellendale, another.
And you notice the interesting thing.
We were at the remote express yesterday, which is down in South-Dade.
And I'm not forgetting all of the problems in Dade County.
However, I will say this, having lived in Broward now for about the last five or six years,
many of us who moved to Broward used to look at all the division in Dade County
and all this right-wing hysterical communist, all this crap that's going on.
And now, Dade County don't look so bad.
You know? All those well-closed middle-class, middle-upper class,
reasonably intelligent people that were at the remote yesterday,
like with an IQ of over 100 or at least over 20,
and Broward, in the meantime, is beginning to look worse by the minutes.
And now the people in Dade, the wormhead and what go-thor-round, come-thor-round.
The people in Dade are like holding their sides with laughter.
Look at those fashions, take a look at those.
They all moved out of Dade to get away from it.
And now there are a thousand times worse than it ever was in Dade County, communist.
It's 11 to 11 noon, until noon, boy, God, this show is moving like lightning.
Isn't it? I did that yesterday, too. I think that's called swishful thinking.
11 to 11. We struck an actual here at W.I. The Dean.
You'll strike an actual, pen 53. If we can divert for just a second here,
I have a shocking bullet in the pencil on following a brief stint at W.I. O.D. Miami,
former KITS San Francisco AM driver, Alex Bennett.
We've heard the warnings at the New Rock Station one day, June 11th.
At a boy, Alex, he's back, working a lot.
Somebody, still somebody loves you.
Just tell me what your problem is.
You're nobody, still somebody cares.
The Bay Area will never be the same. Let's go to Miami. Hello.
Hey, Neil. Yeah. In the last two years, have you ever had the thing that happened in Georgia that went to New York?
A dog. Illegal positions, sir. Bad bumper. That's right. Fashista. Fashista. Fashista.
Okay. From the Joseph Gerberal School of Ronchan. You're on a birthday party and shit your dog because it annoys us too loud.
How about this nine-year-old kid that got arrested the other day for having a fist fight with a kid in the school yard? How about that?
I'm telling you, hey, everybody's getting busted, sir. Everybody's getting busted.
We're just going to take all of my steady building weapons because the Soviets are now like our buddies.
So instead of all that military budget, we've got to get the people doing something in the Pentagon.
We're going to build enormous prisons all over the... We could call them camps, I guess.
And put all these criminals in jail where they belong.
Okay, to make it safe for the other 50 countries. We have sanks. We have sanks.
We are going to hell in a hand-bask, it's, sir. But haven't I... But haven't I stay? W-I-O-T.
Yeah, let me touch the nail when you get there. Speaking.
This is a nail?
Yes, you're mobile and I just had a feeling that you want to get on right now.
Was I right?
That's correct.
Because you're on the vocal line and they tend to be impatient anyway.
Very impatient. Is that the remark you said? It's pretty wild.
Yeah, we had a good time.
You mean you came all the way down from up there?
Sure did.
Well, what a long way, wow.
What a guy. Yeah, by four peers.
Four Myers.
Right, five talent out.
I see what you're talking about, little jelly, man.
What about him?
I don't know, he's pretty interesting.
Oh, in other words, you were one of those lyches there that was looking there leering.
Well, I wouldn't worry about him because he and Rick are real busy these days.
I don't know what that's all about.
But if Anne is listening, I think Rick is expanding his horizons.
Not in the female market, eh?
Don't be lycharist, sir.
All right.
But you do have a good... There were a lot of interesting people there of all persuasions yesterday.
I was there in the front most of the time. I had those like hold...
Well, I had hold on my jeans.
You had holes in your pants?
Well, you could have been that great, doc, because I sure didn't notice.
Oh, man.
I don't miss much.
Have a great day.
All right, talk to that guy about yours.
Shameful.
I think this is a good... This is a good stop for him, too, I think.
1056, don't forget.
Now, 12.05 today, I want everybody in their car and their pickup truck and their pop-up toaster and their van,
whatever out there on the highways and byways in South Florida.
Right after the noon news, we're going to put that sucker on and we're going to play it.
And I want everybody to open up the windows, open up the...
Even if you're in their house, crank the window open.
It's a nice breezy day. It's only about 95.
And crank that sucker up, okay?
It's the clean version, man. It's the clean version.
Two live crew.
Crank it up.
And I'm going to say it again.
I think there's stuff sucks, okay?
I think it is garbage. I think it's just crap.
But what the hell difference does it make? That's not the point.
I think Ron Jeremy looks like crap too, but that don't mean he can't make those grotesque disgusting movies with hair all over everybody's face.
A payphone on the vocal line.
Neal.
Yeah.
During all this stuff with two live crew and the song from the beat.
No one's mentioned anything or heard in the news about that new law we're all made need now.
It's probable suspicion, not probable car.
There's an editorial in the Sun Sentinel, they got the article yesterday out of the paper.
Yeah. Well, this is where we're going now. We're going further and further to the right pretty soon.
The people on the Supreme Court instead of wearing robes, they'll be wearing SS uniforms.
Yeah, but notice on that, that was in the media. It's all this two live crew and you don't hear anything about that.
Well, because the other stuff isn't sensational. It's not juicy enough.
So most of the people are too stupid to understand the law. So we have to put something juicy on for them.
Like Madonna. You know, I don't know if you saw any of the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, when the economicayot went down, no matter what the present was.
The pandemic worried that after I was, the same thing that, a doctor had identified that it was a dementiaaebuzzer, it was, a lady trying to figure out here that it was a Jaquette style kaderry.
How you doing? Okay. Hey, if I so enough of this serious. Yeah, let's get off of this crap. Let's just lay back and be morons. Okay. I enjoy it. I was listening on a garden in the morning to our end.
How? Yes. Yes. He had Kenny Daniels on. Any comment that about her earring. Yeah. He told him, would you, what you could wear them? He said, well, if you like him, you can wear them. Yeah.
All right. He didn't answer that. He quickly went on to something else. Well, she's probably got a couple of wrong. I would imagine. And then he's sitting there asking her questions about Sally Fitz, like he's going to tell the truth. Yeah.
Like she doesn't screen the new. Well, you know, the shameless self-promotors that run around, you know, and that's the stuff that sells inside all the sensational crap. That's what people want today. You know, they're just a bunch of sensationalistic yellow journalistic minded.
The more such a people out, listen, how many times are they causing the key beat and what if that keep the dead horse? Well, they better stop beating it.
It's really should stop beating because they're going to come get exactly. Amen. I'm glad you got your head on straight. Yeah, I'm over here playing. I have to drive over over to hear the plantation. Thank God, I got changed over. I was going to. I was supposed to stay here.
And run a story here, but luckily, I've been told that now I'm going to be in Miami.
So congratulations. They're welcome to the free country. Yeah, have a great day. Henry Barrow standing by Henry, of course, has got his little uniform on this morning.
Henry would look good in one of those outfits with a little arm band. He was just what he's got the appearance and we'll come back at 11.05. Whether permitting.
751 WIO D in day. 524 WIO D in Broward or 655 and 278 WIO D in the form beaches. Other areas make all collapse. The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station.
Now here's Neil Rogers on new sock radio six pan WIO D.
This is.
Oh, yes.
Super.
If a little fun film.
The sugar coated moves.
Say, like little shoes, they're going to get you off on your way to work school or play. Go on. Take a bite.
Woo.
Listen, they make your ears ring.
No sugar ludes.
From the two burger companies.
Woo.
Inside of every box is a free set of very high headphones.
This is.
The.
With the sugar coated.
There's the final record.
It's no young girl.
It's a long.
What the hell are you talking about?
Good question. Oh, it's still going on.
Who is sugar ludes? It's a smart new way to start your day from Pillsburger. Does it ever end?
It's 1107 at WIO D. Boy, Henry, he's good little cantankerist too, isn't he? Henry's going to be banned on our next newscast.
West Palm Beach.
Did you read the inquire?
Or every day.
Larry King's fifth marriage is on the rocks now.
No, he just got married like four minutes ago.
I know it's already.
She's in Philadelphia.
He's in Washington.
They see each other on the weekend.
They do it by nose.
You know, and also did you ever see Batman cereal?
It's made by Roast and Perina.
The people that make cat food.
You know, in the plant, say something gets screwed up.
They put the cat food in the Batman cereal.
Yeah.
And you would be eating cat food.
So what's wrong with that?
Well.
Henry's newscast is getting dull.
It's time for us to have to be replaced.
Are you automation?
Yeah, okay, sir. Nice call.
1108 at WIO D. And Henry loves you too.
He's going to bring a big bottle over for you.
Right over your head.
Let's go to Miami.
Hello.
Oh, that's right.
Well, how long are you going to hold, man?
You're going to tie up our line all day?
Yeah.
Wouldn't it be much better if he just went out and barred somebody's radio?
No.
Okay.
Let's go to a QAM spy report.
What a piece of gum on it.
Okay. Let's go to Bokeh.
Hello.
Hello, welcome.
How are you doing?
Okay.
I was out here in Bokeh when you were a big fan.
By the way, that was Nick that cut you off.
I didn't do it, sir.
Nick did it, and I congratulated him for doing it.
What is it?
So this is Bokeh when you were a big fan.
Yes, sir.
Come with me.
Come with me.
Come with me.
Go ahead.
Is there going to be jerked off the shelves now?
That's what just move along, sir.
Don't be like a parent.
Repeat everything you hear.
I think he's doing a hell of a job in there.
That's right.
Who does that Saturday show show show?
Anybody who can do...what is it?
Who does the Saturday show before...
Chuck Meyer.
It is a great show.
I'd only get a show on the weekend.
I understand Chuck came back yesterday after the Pirates won a game and came back to work.
So you had a good time yesterday, huh?
Yeah, we had a great time.
Good and make it.
Wow.
A big of a track.
From where?
From Parker.
Well, that's what you say.
Yeah.
I told Stan the other night I happened to be listening in there.
And those people who said, back in, he gets a KHJ, must have been listening to something else.
He had nothing encouraging to say about you at all.
Well, so they almost had been lying, huh?
Listen, let me just say this to you, okay?
Even if he didn't, the fact is he's become so chronic that I just don't go for the chronic.
So I really don't.
And I've tolerated him for a very long time.
See, he's a creation of Stan.
He's not one of my people.
He was from back from INZ.
He's one of Stan's creations.
So let him kind of hang out and he can call him when Stan is on, which is only once about every 10 days.
That's ample for him, okay?
Yeah.
That was a fun show Stan has, uh, really, right?
Really?
Yeah.
Well, glad you enjoyed it.
Yeah, I did.
Don't get past in the old love your show too.
Okay.
Don't be sensitive to this stuff.
Yeah, I'm not sensitive.
I'm just here.
Okay.
Have a nice day.
Bye-bye.
10 after 11 at WIOD.
Here's a car in Miami.
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
Okay.
I thought a show yesterday was real good.
Yeah.
Real good jobs.
Yeah, but okay.
Listen, uh, Lisa?
Listen, I think the, uh, the news cap for hysterical when they did the stories about the banning of the
thongs, the thongs.
The thongs.
The thongs.
The thongs.
The thongs.
The thongs.
Like, with the thongs in my heart.
You remember that one?
Right, exactly.
The thongs in my heart.
They showed them all.
They showed them all.
They showed them all.
Pictures of the thongs of TV.
Pictures of the live crew album.
While they're telling how it's being banned.
It's okay to be on TV just not on the beach, right?
And I'd like to know.
Everything is illegal in South Florida.
So just keep that in mind.
And like this could be the last phone call you're ever allowed to make.
I want to do that.
That's true.
I want you to know that we are overtaking it in the country becoming number one in the country.
We're overtaking Arkansas in the end of the thongs.
That's right.
We are already number one in the worst education and most dropouts.
We're right, we're right with Louisiana.
The two are battling neck and neck.
Now I think red and neck.
Arkansas has always been one of the leaders in education and red neckness.
And I think we're overtaking it.
No, I'm telling him.
I'm not joking.
Louisiana is number 50 and I think we're number 49 in per capita spending on education.
Yeah, I think we're getting our money's worth.
Trust me.
Absolutely.
And by the way, I want everyone to know that Henry Barrow was the best sideline man in the business.
Exactly.
Okay.
Keep it up.
Till Rick Weaver took his ass out of there.
While listen, when you clean out the booze box all the time, him and King, they had to do something about it.
Okay, it was cost-instation of fortune.
Phil Costin said, you ever let Henry back in that ballpark and we'll cut your things off?
It's W.I.O.D.
Yeah, like cut your water off.
Okay.
We'll cut your water off.
And it's 11 after 11 in W.I.O.D., we want to tell you about Arnold's Royal Castle right now.
No, it's true.
I heard the stories about you and King passed out up there.
Like, where is the more, where is the more bottles?
I've heard all the stories.
Anyway.
Okay, listen, very important news now.
And I heard that Tom Jicca had called Mike Anthony, who used to be the assassin here.
And all of the stories about W.I.O.D. are Buffalo and he denied.
And he said there was nothing to it. It was all a lie.
I'm Mike Anthony.
And here's Radio Management Weekly Magazine, one of these subversive commy-pinko rags.
NBC's anchors away at W.I.O.D.
Mike Anthony, news anchor and business news reporter at NBC Radio, is heading for the PD post to W.I.O.D. in Buffalo.
Etc. Etc. Etc.
We're taking a pair of his former Miami staffers with him.
Talk host Paul Lyle has been named executive manager of News and Talk as well as Morning Hosts at WGR.
And another former Miami Dug, I was only doing research young, will join WGR as executive producer of News and Sports.
He, of course, formerly was an executive producer at WJNOS Palm Beach in Nicaragua's desperately trying to get that job.
It's a lot of housing coming.
Why do you want to leave here? Why would you just because there are a bunch of idiots back there?
We're just starting to like Nick and now he wants to leave us, okay?
Now that Steve's been gone a few months, Nick has finally turned into a human being.
And now he wants to leave.
Marvin wants off the show. Nick wants to go to West Palm Beach.
Pretty soon we'll be sitting here all alone.
With Johnny Dark.
Oh, what a thought that is. Okay, let's go to Miami. Hello.
Hi, Neil.
We're just bad folks, that's all.
How you doing?
Okay.
Did you read this little blurp in the paper about the guy who got arrested for the T-shirt for 10 days?
No.
And the front page?
A little burp.
Yeah, this is really great.
It says that in Invernist, Florida prosecutors drop charges to the man.
He gave him 10 days in court.
Anyway, he wore a shirt in the court that says hauling ass.
Oh my God.
It says with a drawing of a pickup in four buttocks of singing over the tailgate
and the judge dropped their original charges and gave him 10 days in jail for this.
Is that crazy?
I wouldn't give anything if I had a little dorks lined up or all of a song card so we could play.
We could get used to it.
We could learn the words to it.
Okay, I got it.
You know, it's kind of like onward Christian soldiers.
It's got the same kind of meter to it.
I got it.
I got to tell you this one.
I'll go on.
Yeah.
I was coming home the other night on Westix, the highway in the North Miami area.
And they had a sign up in the middle of Westix, the drug check at 11 o'clock at night with flares in the road.
Oh yeah.
And they pulled everybody over.
It didn't bother me because I got an old Honda but I got to tell you I was thinking of you.
I thought if they learned to fake dogs, starts slaubing in the front seat of your vet.
Looking for drugs.
You had a gone crazy.
Now wait a minute.
Where was this?
This was on Westix, the highway in North Miami.
I live in North Miami.
I was coming home from work.
I'm out of my truck at night.
Oh, no, what does that mean?
What the hell does that mean?
It's a sign.
Three by three, at least six seven police cars, about four dogs on leash.
It's big German shoppers and it's a drug check.
They pulled everybody over.
They asked you to step out of your car.
You drive your license.
You're a voter's registration.
And they let the dogs go through the car.
And there's a big dog, starts slaubing all over the place.
I got news for everybody.
I think they're going to take any big dog, let them sleep in my dogs, don't get in the Corvette.
If they think they're going to slaub her all over my car, they can slaub her all over their butt.
They're crazy.
Imclosing.
I like that.
My guy said don't think Browards back because they just is bad.
Imclosing may I call my brother Dr. George a super douchebag?
See.
Thanks.
Adios.
Come on Easter.
Come on Easter.
Oh man.
What are those little boots I hear marching in the back?
Are they marching on the building?
W-I-O-D.
Yeah, I just do it in the right place.
Speak softly sir, because they're listing.
Well, they're monitoring out there in radio land.
The fascist pigs are monitoring our conversations.
Yes sir.
Don't say it to a lot, whatever it is.
Am I on the air?
Yes.
Do you know that?
Quietly.
Okay, I'll be very careful.
From the Joseph Gerberal School of Propaganda.
Come on Easter.
Come on Easter.
Come on Easter.
You probably know that your name was mentioned on a done a usual day.
Yes.
But do you know that?
We aren't discussing it.
You know that Larry King mentioned your name last night?
Larry King don't even know who I am.
Every time somebody plays one of my things, I don't know who that is.
I don't know who that is.
Let's just about what?
So I find it very convenient.
And then to do it that.
Yeah, right.
That's just about what he said last night.
What?
Somebody called him up from Florida and said that some club show host was advocating
using card stickers that said, how to fly reking those you money.
Great.
So Larry King said, who's the talk show host and they called him here?
I remember doing that.
The call said Neil Rogers.
And he said, Neil Rogers.
He said, have a card about him in about 12 years.
All right, this is Larry King.
And they don't come any better than Neil Rogers.
Yeah.
I don't know if he's still on radio, but I know he's been doing that.
I've heard that.
I've heard that.
I've heard that.
I've heard that.
I've heard that.
I've heard that.
How clear it is.
All right, this is Larry King and they don't come any better than Neil Rogers.
And I'm going to do it that.
Yeah.
That's what he said.
He said he hadn't heard of that in 12 years.
The West think he heard you would do in college baseball.
Right.
He said it.
It was on a radio show and a number of questions.
His response is always a put down of anybody else because he can't stand the fact that people expose him for the
piece of crap that he really is.
Well, he can make a hundred million dollars here and you know what?
He's still a piece of crap and he still didn't pay anybody back in his town.
He's still screwed a lot of people over and he's still garbage, okay?
I, okay.
I've always got a big note.
It was on your station, by the way.
And he wears some flanking suspenders.
Oh, I know it.
It was on IOD.
Well, no matter where he is, he's still a piece of crap.
Maybe you can get a recording of it.
Oh, listen.
Listen, I could, I mean, if that's my biggest story in my life, I got a real, I have no life.
Well, you were famous guy.
Yeah, sure, I am between Luther Campbell and Larry King.
I mean, and then to do it that.
Well, thank you, Larry.
You're getting national exposure, though.
Yeah, so to speak.
Have a nice life.
Thank you.
It's 1121 at WIOD.
A while it's still legal, it's specced music.
Okay, I hope you were listening carefully of that Rick and Puts promo.
That was the radio sued that I was referring to earlier, called me yesterday.
And at the end of that call, he went into this big thing about all how he agreed with Rick.
And he just absolutely disapproves of profanity on the ear.
And I wish when he hung up, he would have said butt load, okay?
I think they would have been a perfect ending.
Here's a mobile and brown word.
Neil.
Yeah.
Oh, good thing you put me on hold because you allowed me to get into the safe zone.
I was south on the US one.
I was in the brown word.
Oh, there is no safe zone.
Didn't you hear the guy was just talking about the drug surge?
Oh, yeah, the drug surge.
Yeah.
Surgeon Seas, pal.
Well, I got to watch out.
Get out of the car and get on your knees because we're going to search and we're going to seize.
And I'm afraid of what they might seize, you know?
I'm trying to search and please get the fashions.
Fashions, round shirt, pigs up there, okay?
And they're not fooling me on I-75.
The only reason, I mean, there's a little bit of resurfacing, a road-poor repair.
It's going on in very little limited stretches.
And they've still got that hole like 10 or 15 miles, like 45 miles an hour.
So those pigs can sit there and write business.
Who the hell are they kidding?
Who the hell is who?
Turning into a police state.
That you've very scary signs column in the four-large on the news.
Yeah, he and the Ray Retrieve write a lot of good stuff, but it's just it's like howling into the wind.
It's pretty light.
Wistling into a wind storm.
But he has something neat left.
We've got to know if he talks about it.
I don't usually get to listen because I'm working, but today I have to be driving.
And on license plates, in Florida, the number of license plates.
Now what we need to do is get the legislators to get rid of all of them.
And just take your swastik idea and put a swastik on the state of Florida license plate.
Yeah, that's right.
And maybe get a couple of circles with a slasks or a bathing suit for a...
Or maybe some more of the...
Donscap would be good.
That would really define Florida, maybe a little hood.
And I always wanted to ask New Jersey the garden state to see that on license plate.
Nothing to do with it, but...
Well, if you ever smelled it, you'd wonder what kind of a garden.
Well, maybe they had a lot of fertilizer, but that's what you smell in Jersey.
I'll tell you that.
But they play around Newark and Trenton.
Mmm-hmm.
But we got to do this with a license plate.
And a Roma that could really turn your life upside down.
Anyway, watch out for Nick the stick.
Okay.
No, that's not...
And that's Seek.
Seek Navarro with two S's as an SS.
Oh, I like that.
You have to say with a civil and sound like...
Seek.
Seek.
And when he hears a little civil and sound, that'll make him real nervous too.
Seek.
Seek.
Seek.
You got it.
Okay, see you.
27 after 11 at W-I-O-D.
And now, public access presents...
Men on film.
Hello, I'm Wayne Edwards.
And I'm Ted Juan-Mary Weathers.
And welcome to Men on film.
We're going to be reviewing the latest film from a male point of view.
First up is that controversial movie, Do the Right Scene.
Now, I really like Little Spike Lee's courage in making this film.
I especially like the way he makes the racial tension with the violence in order to get his
message.
Do the right scene.
Come on out the closet.
Don't be afraid to be who you is.
Black, white, whatever.
And that's a truth, Ruth.
Now, I'd like to talk about an exciting little film, Corotic Kid Part III.
It's all about men working out these columns in a very physical way.
It was all so primitive.
And you know, I really enjoyed Mr. Miyagi played by Lil Pat Marito.
And that Ralph Marshall, three words, bad you love them.
Boy, I hope I look that good when I'm 40.
So.
But I have to disagree.
I just agree that's just too much violence to this movie.
Don't get me.
You better give me back my song.
Don't make me because I'm beautiful.
They went all wrong.
What's all this chicken about?
This is a movie about relationships.
This could have been a beautiful picture about the special friendship between a major
mature masculine older man and a tender, ripening, consensing young man.
See, I think America's ready for that.
You know I know I am.
I bet you is.
Now I'd like to talk about a film I've been agency-weighting to see great ball-of-file.
I ain't gonna touch it.
But the pattern alone gets too smith.
I'm gonna touch it.
Now let's talk about some films that I soon come out on video.
First up is Black Widow.
Dying to Risa Russell and Deborah Winger.
There it is.
Also coming out is Liz Firecracker.
Is that Gene as me raised with a movie?
Holly Hunter.
Hey, did I finally have dangerous live-on?
Star and John Melkovic and Glenn Close.
You know, John Melkovic is like every movie going fantasy.
I found myself just alone and I just think about him.
Intensity.
What do you think of Clay Close?
Oh, I love him.
And I really have to invite a producer for Dan to cast a man in that role.
I mean, that really made the picture for me.
Hello? Glenn Close is a woman.
Touch the pearls when a snake is in here.
Well, it looks like we almost out of time.
When you join us next week, when we talk about Mel Gibson's lethal weapon,
I hope it's loaded.
What the hell is that?
Oh, I see. That's dead.
Anyway, 11.31.
I'm dying on the hair.
Okay, 11.34 at W.I.O.D.A. mobile in Boka.
Oh, my God.
And they're actually there. I can't believe it.
Over 10 minutes, but they get worth it.
I know it.
Listen, I went to your remote.
I'm from Fallout A Day on.
I went down to your remote.
It was a nice little remote.
Yeah, we had a good time.
The Gilbert was great.
Well, now he is.
That's the only time he's any good.
Although, Kevin, we need to give Kevin a long rest.
Okay?
I heard him call Rick and Krud yesterday afternoon.
Kevin, you need desperately to get some semblance of a life.
That kid, I mean, he's just like beyond chronic.
There's 100 yards beyond front.
The guy that was behind you with the tie and suit
was that Tom Dennerberg with the gray suit?
No, that was Scott Schwartz.
Oh.
No, Dennerberg was a little midget guy
that put the news around his neck
and everybody started plotting and foaming at the mouth
and they ran the hell out of there.
I walked into the stuff that I guess Gilbert was around.
Tom's still hanging out there, by the way.
Listen, one quick question.
I know you.
I don't know if you mentioned it, but you said something about Don.
You said something about Don.
You said something about you.
You said they were talking about you?
No, Luther Campbell, not Donnie.
I was a gunner.
You don't know me from what he put it.
Was it good?
Yeah.
Oh, really?
That's great.
I just want to know what they said, you know?
No.
Oh, no, they said.
No.
He said Neil Rogers is horny.
Something like that.
Have a great day.
Yeah, baby.
W-Y-O-D.
Yeah, hi, Neil.
Speaking.
Yeah, hi, Neil.
Peter, how are you?
Peter?
Did you see that?
Do I know who you are?
How I saw you once at Jimmy's in the Sunrise.
Jimmy's?
Yeah.
Jimmy's pizza?
Yeah.
Oh.
Many years ago.
Have it, Emily?
Yeah.
Did you see that article in Charles Whittaker article on...
In the Miami-Heraldle Swatting?
About.
About the crew?
No.
You should take a look at it.
It's very interesting.
About everything is obscene.
You can't do a thing.
That's correct.
It's not the same.
You can't even breathe.
Well, listen, we can all keep talking about it forever.
But I mean, it's just nobody's going to do anything about it.
We just sit back and we allow this to go on.
And we got living in a very...
We keep talking about how Gorbachev keeps freeing all these formerly communist...
Soviet dominated countries and they're having free elections.
And now we got the Berlin Wallas come down and all this other crap.
And in the meantime, we're going in the opposite direction.
It's been there all going to be democratic and free.
And we're going to be sitting here in a Nazi concentration camp somewhere.
It says here, article 8847001.
He says, you cannot live with somebody if you're not married.
You can't do this.
You can't do that.
That is correct, sir.
I welcome to Communist America.
It's terrible.
Well, I hope you feel well.
Keep your passport handy.
I will.
I can't.
Okay.
1037.
That's why I only advised everybody to just keep your passport out and keep a credit card.
A good one handy, certain via quick airline ticket.
We have an opening in Boca and Palm Beach.
They're both open now.
I just can't believe that.
I don't think we give the numbers out yet today.
Have we?
No.
Well, that's okay.
2789463 in Boca and Del Rey also, WIOD.
How many stars?
Yes, sir.
What is this?
Two letters, dear.
Ah, I can't pass.
I'm here.
I'm going to go.
No, I'm going to go.
Yeah, that's what you think.
You better start learning, pal.
If the shadow of Seek gets his way.
Good morning, my radio friend.
Yes, sir.
A little thought for you.
I'll bet.
I agree with you about all this stuff about skin out of control.
So here he goes.
Go ahead.
I'm listening.
20 seconds of that.
And it's giving you.
No, I'm listening.
I just don't want to do your voices.
There's certain drone in it.
You know what I'm going to want.
So you're right.
Too much censorship is bad.
I agree with you all on that.
But there's a big bug.
I don't want the dead be all of the size.
But burning the flag is touching.
When you do that, OK, what going into a cap?
Here I am.
So I am so astonished at your saying.
You are so juvenile.
That's beyond.
You're bouncing a nerve with the point you're going to play.
Sir, can I say something to you?
Sure.
When I see literature from the Ku Klux Klan or the American Nazis, it touches a lot of nerves
in me too.
But that doesn't mean I'm going to run around saying that they should be suppressed or
made illegal or they can't express their grotesque, disgusting opinion.
That's what makes this country great is.
It's a pluralistic nation.
Diversity of opinion, no matter how unacceptable it may be to you or me, that's what makes
it a great country.
Once you take away political dissent, whether it's burning of a flag or making a speech
or marching on a white house, you're talking about fascism, OK?
But it's different.
It's not different.
Are you that stupid?
I'm not.
I'm not.
I mean, I can't believe that somebody who sounds fairly intelligent.
No, I can't believe.
But the important question is ways to express your dissent, the fact that I'm in the country,
the murder.
You're not in a position to decide whether it's intelligent or not.
Whether you agree with it or not is not the point.
And you didn't listen to what damn thing I just said.
I heard everything where you said.
I agree.
A little bit, but I just think about that.
There's nothing to disagree with.
You think it's necessary or not isn't relevant.
Nobody's going to ask your permission.
If that's why they want to express their dissent or they just want to do it for the
hell of it, if I go out and buy an American flag for ten bucks in Kmart and I want to take
it home and burn it in the backyard.
That's none of the government's guy damn business.
Okay, it's my property.
It's not hurting anybody else.
It's not hurting anybody else's property.
It's not taking away anybody else's rights and it's nobody's damn business.
You're it.
Okay, including you 21 till noon at W.I.O.
Do your friendly station.
What the hell am I getting it?
This is just like old times.
I don't work in W.S. News anymore.
Let them scream in a holler.
I don't want to argue with you.
Okay, pal, you're an idiot.
You're an idiot.
You're a moron.
You're one of those George Bush sick offense is going to follow him all the way into the
into Shabez Reveen.
A mobile invoker when it's this.
Hi, how are you?
Okay, I'm the word for today on this show is agitated.
Agitated.
I can relate to that because after reading the paper and I'm going on with two live crew.
I'm even more agitated.
You know, 25 years.
25 years ago and I'm in my 40s.
My parents bought bill bars and Pearl Williams records.
Yeah, she and red fox.
I'm telling you and in those days you couldn't get anymore obscene than that.
And you boarded over the county.
You took it home.
Nobody said blue.
And if you wanted it, you played it.
Yeah.
Now they're doing a blood test for no reason.
Why you have to play it on a pornograph?
Exactly.
If you're if you played in your car, you could be arrested.
But they're taking the wall down overseas.
And I think they're putting it up on 995.
No, they're putting it up on a 1a and 4 lotterdale mayor Cox and the
she'll speak are going to be there together to not break a bottle or two over it.
It's unbelievable.
I mean, you're right.
You got to keep a passport out.
This is just unbelievable for no reason at all.
I mean, when this guy called before about the drug check in Dave County,
how they're pulling everybody over, get out of the car and the dogs are sniffing around.
See, that's the new Supreme Court ruling.
They don't need reasonable cause.
They can just come and for any reason at all.
Why don't we think maybe you look suspicious?
Maybe you got some crack in there.
And that's it.
But here you can burn the flag.
This makes sense.
I mean, I personally don't care because it's not a thing.
The burning that look, the burning the flag is, you know, I mean, even this right wing Supreme Court can't hold
that one up.
Okay.
Exactly.
You were a last guy that called it.
So it's offensive.
Well, that's tough.
Tough to bananas.
Okay.
Yeah.
But I'm saying if you want to burn the flag, that's an opinion.
You can do it.
But yet the bottom line is where are, where's the freedom?
You want to play a role?
Well, we don't have any.
We talk a lot about it in this country, but we don't have it any.
And what annoys me is they're arresting shop owners for selling the record.
Yeah.
To adults.
Not the modules, but to adults.
But so how about if you go into a bookstore and you buy the traffic of cancer?
Okay.
With all those four letter words and all that sexual like every other word.
Are they going to arrest you for buying a porn or an obscene book?
I have to get an elementary school student to interpret it.
Maybe we have to have a judge gun dollars who will on all of these books.
He's going to be real busy very soon.
Judge Gonzalez, I have to start reading all these books and seeing all those movies.
They can be like the dictator for all the rest of us and decide how to get nice.
What we can read, what we can watch, what we can listen to, what we can play in our car.
I'll tell you one thing.
I really hope they have good attorneys and they wipe the streets with Navarro.
I want to tell you something.
Bruce Rogo unfortunately is the local attorney for two live crew who is a sad
pseudo intellectual walking around with a pipe plunge between his teeth.
Mouthing a lot of pseudo intellectual crap that nobody understands.
With Bruce Rogo as their attorney, they'll all wind up in a slammer.
Okay.
He is hopeless.
Tragic.
They need some guy like like Consteller was on the CBS this morning.
Right.
He's firing Brimstone who will take the gloves off and go right in the trenches with all these pigs
and really let them have it.
That's what they need.
They have to because there has got to be constitutional rights.
I mean, the fact that they're telling innocent people like you or I or anybody else out there,
what we can play in our car.
I mean, don't you think he's gone a little far?
Let's hear a seek to you, man.
Have a nice day.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
That's in our SSE 1143 WIOG, the land of the free and the home of the grave, man.
We're going to have a little drug check at noon.
And then if everybody passes at 12.05 right after the noon news, we're going to come back
and crank it up and piss off.
Share a seek the viral and everybody in the car is just open a windows.
Crank it up real loud.
We'll play three, four minutes of it.
And see if anybody gets busted.
It's the clean version.
And you know, as much as I think there's stuff is really garbage.
I will say this Luther Campbell had a very good point on Donnie who this morning.
And that is they are the only ones.
The only group with all this other crap that's out.
What happened to the front label of this?
How did that disappear?
I don't know.
Oh, it's in the basket.
But they've got that.
I mean, you have to be blind not to see it.
It's right across the cover as clean as they want to be.
And it's got a big thing across the front covering all the butts, all the cheeks.
This album does not contain explicit lyrics.
And the other one, which of course you can't buy for lover money now, is just the opposite.
It says as nasty as they want to be.
And it's a warning that it does contain him.
Okay.
So if you don't want to be offended, you don't want to hear the explicit lyrics.
Don't buy it.
Simple as that.
And to think that adults can't pick and choose what they're going to be offended by or what they're going to.
And listen to.
Just get your little, just get your little sewing kids out and start embroidering those swastikas right now.
Miami. Hello.
Bill.
Hi. I call.
I call the response that got to call the earlier about the call to Larry King.
That was me and you should hear this.
What?
You will not believe the ignorance.
I wanted to expose him for what he was.
And if you have one second, you're going to see where the one part ties it to the other.
Okay.
If I can play this for one second, we're one part ties into the other.
So what's the answer to the question?
On fact, I'm the one that has the stickers.
My brother has the stickers made up.
The one's about his his bumper stickers.
Well, how come we don't have a bunch of them to set out?
You want some more?
Hi.
Your loan is approved, right?
Yeah.
What's the answer to the question?
If you can, if you can give me like 10 seconds, one part I talk about him being prejudice.
And I'm going to expose him and you come in in the last minute and you'll see what I mean by this.
You're going to do it that.
Okay.
I hear nothing.
I am.
Hey, there.
Very high.
I'm going to ask you, sorry, for two quick points.
First of all, you say you cannot understand prejudice.
Do you deny having one prejudice phone in your body?
And then I have any prejudice phone in my body regarding race credo.
That's all I do.
You mean so you've never said, uh, pertaining to someone say if they're
Breckled or they are, if they're fat or skinny, that's prejudiced whether it's a particular race or no.
That that is unappealing to me.
When I don't worry, you know, your parts coming up.
That thing that people are inferior or superior to skin.
But if you're that, yeah, this, I don't like rock.
You know, people with big noses, but I'm not prejudice against broccoli.
Well, if you are going to like your tools, broccoli is not a person with feeling.
Okay.
I think that is not a good quote.
Oh, you don't have to look at promise.
I think that people are high.
Your loan is approved, right?
You want to call that prejudice?
No, but it's just a call around when you're trying to come across who's saying that you don't have a prejudice.
What's the answer to the question?
It means I'm not prejudice.
Are you prejudice?
I'm not prejudiced.
The only thing is he's not prejudiced.
Well, why don't we go to get to the good?
Okay, I'll come.
But notice me.
Calls you.
Notice what he calls me.
Let me ask you one more thing.
I just moved here to Miami a couple of years ago.
And I, there's a talk show host and he talks about you a lot and then he said that there was a bumper sticker.
And then, Mark and Larry King owes you money.
Did you tell me what that is?
I had no idea.
Who is those?
Some guy named Neil Rogers.
I last saw him about when he was when he easy admitted, he came on the air and said he was homosexual.
Yeah.
And the last time I've ever heard Neil Rogers, which had to be 13 years ago.
I remember who it was.
He's still on the air?
Yeah, it's actually supposedly just ratings are very high.
I never heard him.
But he was always trashy, and I just didn't know.
Well, there's a lot of people in due address that jealous.
Why does Larry King, they don't come any better than Rogers Entertainment report?
Okay, sir.
Great.
Lone 47 at WIOD and we want to tell you about Toyota Hollywood where they're having some big nuances.
All right, it's Larry King and they don't come any better than Neil Rogers.
Excuse me.
Is that a bugle in your jeans?
Well, yes it is.
Get in.
I know flight of the Bumblebee.
Okay, let me 501 at WIOD and let's... what do you mean Delaware?
Delaware?
Yeah.
There's Melbourne out there again today.
No, Melbourne worked this morning.
Oh.
Renere is up in Orlando.
Why are you writing a book?
Well, it sounded like what do you want in Chippapom?
Exactly.
Well, I just called...
I'm not gonna knock in Nick.
He's like right on the edge now.
He's got a great job offer in West Palm Beach and he's anxious to work with Lee Fowler.
Really?
We're gonna exchange all of them his news stories.
Are you gonna go to the joy?
Go ahead, sir.
What do you want?
Anyway, I called the letter and I got home all right.
Great.
And I heard on the way home that you didn't have a good night last night.
Cubs lost both games.
I had a finite last night.
Okay, my life isn't determined by...
If my life was determined by whether the Cubs win or lose, I'd already be six feet in the ground.
Yeah.
Everything is wonderful, okay?
It's just a ball game.
I heard a story on the way home that I didn't know whether...
God.
But you want to know the answer to this.
I don't know anything.
Does it like...
I mean, I have to...
If this call is exciting as your last call, it's gonna be so short that you'll be seeing stars in your eyes.
I will listen.
I heard on the way home.
On the way home?
Yeah, about ten years ago there was a school teacher by the name of Alice Cooper.
Yeah.
That all of her students drove her berserk and she ended up in...
Was that a collect call by the way Nick?
You can call it and don't ever accept a call from him again.
He is so boring and so terminal, you can hear the dies clicking all over town.
I think it's a setup.
Because right after noon, probably Sheriff Seat got him to call in, okay?
And chased the whole audience away so it was 12.05 and we played that thing and asked everybody to crank it up.
Nobody will be listening.
Let...
I don't know what that means.
What did he say?
I couldn't hear what he said.
What?
Oh, that just means school.
Well, he said a square-loud, okay?
And he didn't even know what that is.
I didn't hear what he said.
So I just took...
You know, never take any chances on this show.
Because here at WIOD we're pretty damn nervous.
And have very right to be.
Well, I don't know. What is it?
Oh, geez.
Oh, man on MTV.
Is that MTV we have on?
Oh, God.
All I can say is...
I'm dying on my hands.
Man, I'm going to tell you.
It's like a creeping illness.
Miami.
How are you doing?
Okay.
Great. I got a billboard report for you.
Look at that movie.
The blob where that ooze was just oozing over and spreading.
And that's how this soul businesses.
It's just everywhere.
Well, it's just why I'm trying to divert from it.
Good.
Let's be diverse or perverse or whatever you want.
Whatever you want to do.
I'm open for anything.
I'll bet.
If I can say that.
But I was cruising up the palm metal the other day.
Don't say cruising.
I...
I'm sorry.
I was driving up the palm metal.
And the billboard that was up for you just below 103rd street has been replaced by radio,
Mombi.
Oh.
Covering yourself according to...
Well, I hope a lot of old Cubans drive by that one, man.
I really love it.
Well, highly, you know.
Yeah.
Hang in there.
Okay.
ZKyle.
1154 here at Radio Facista.
We have an open line.
Yeah, that's going to be the new thing.
No more of these radio Mombi and radio.
What do they call that?
The other one.
I think I'll have their little slogans.
Now we're going to have like Nazi radio.
And you're going to have people speaking in German.
Let's go to a mobile and browser, WIO Dean.
What was that?
What's going on in your car, sir?
Is this anything else?
I say what's all the noise in your car?
I'm only hanging out of it.
What are your old stomping grounds?
The publics?
Yeah.
Over here in Claire Avenue?
Oh, great.
Yeah.
Good.
Well, since we come back after the news, crank it up real out.
Okay.
Maybe you can get yourself busted.
Get on the front page of the paper tomorrow.
Probably make $50 million from it.
Please go down with me.
Yeah.
I heard that.
Are you going to bet?
I hear it.
Really?
What's going on?
What is that supposed to mean?
Sir, are you in coherent?
Oh, no.
What do you want of the bag boys that just got canned?
Is that it?
Negative.
Okay. Good luck to you.
Let's go to Miami.
Hello.
Yeah.
All right.
I want to ask you something about Sally Fitz when you're talking about her vibrating.
Let's go to Boca.
Hello.
Boca?
Be gone.
Miami.
Let's try a pot beach.
Yes, there's one thing she has any favorites for.
Let's try a Davy, W-I-O-D.
NEO, how you doing?
Oh, well, I thought we were doing pretty good.
There's about 60 seconds left.
I thought you had to fall off after the news, didn't that?
Yeah.
You know, it was that call from Delaware that did it for me.
Does it every time?
Down.
Every stinking time.
Down hill after that.
Yeah.
I just moved down here in November from a piece in the evening.
Well, where did that Tony shower?
The only boom boom is a lot of talk like that.
Don't talk like that anymore.
It's a laugh at you.
I'll keep it there.
And you'll probably get arrested.
That's right.
As a matter of fact, I think that...
Oh, make any shibbolin sounds.
I don't want to sound paranoid, but I think the Broward ESO, as they call it,
here is the problem here around.
I don't blame them.
What is this?
This is unfortunate.
This is a fascist state, isn't it?
Yeah.
And then I hear these...
Are you a parent, sir?
Are you just repeating what I've been saying all morning?
Actually, I'm...
What kind of any material of your own?
Well, what I want to tell you is we've got these people who are calling you up.
If they do anything about their constitutional rights...
They don't.
All they care about is what's bothering them.
Yeah.
And when they're on little vacuums here, they're in their own little worlds, okay?
That's America.
You know what I mean?
The next thing you know, I'm going to be saying, I'm dying over here.
Yeah.
Right.
All right, Neil.
As the governor Martinez would say, is that America?
That's...
Have a nice life.
The 1157, that is what he would say, isn't it?
If he knew what it meant.
We have an opening in Broward, 524, William, W-I-O-D.
Okay.
Let's go to sunrise.
Hello.
Home of freedom.
And aging.
Meal.
Where you're free to be old and miserable, yes sir?
How you doing?
Okay.
I think someone would have fit Sheriff Nick down and tell him that banning these bathing...
Sheriff's...
Speak.
Speak that SSICK, SS.
Okay, well tell him that banning bathing suits does not solve the crack problem.
Cute.
1157 at W-I-O-D, Miami.
Neil.
Yeah.
Good morning.
Yes sir.
I'm jogging right over to win more and I'm going to twist up my radio and all right.
Fine.
But I got a question for you.
You have some wonder mugs sir?
Please you're in hand out the wonder mugs while they're out there calling the cops.
If that was declared illegal, where you're playing, how do you have permission to play it without getting your trouble?
Not illegal, it's the clean version.
It's only the nasty version that's obscene.
Okay.
This is the sparkly clean as they want to be version.
Mr. Clean.
Yes.
Okay, I'm going.
I'm going to...
I'm going to Rolly.
Okay sir.
They used to say on GT Army they're resting please crank it up and piss off everybody.
Okay then.
Okay.
1158 at W-I-O-D we have one open line indeed.
One in Boka.
I can't believe it.
There's Guilbrite.
Yesterday at the remote I had no idea what time it was who was doing the news and as it turned out it made no difference.
W-I-O-D.
Hello.
Hello?
Yes sir.
Neil.
How you doing?
Is the Eggman?
I don't know if I can say that.
Wow, real fast.
Hold one egg.
I think Neil...
Although if you drive up in a pan hell you might drive through two eggs.
I think they're going to make them change the name of the town.
I think I can't...
I can't...
Where am I going?
The little crew suggested for this state sir.
I can't where my shirt.
I got an egg painting in my shirt in the front.
Yeah well they might confuse it but something.
I'd like to share up to brain that's about the same size.
Hey I saw when you were...
Only his shell is empty.
That's true.
I saw you at the remote.
Well you were leaving in your limousine.
By the way Eric signed this yesterday just dawned on me that he said down the field.
He keeps doing that all the time to me.
Eric you're not fooling anybody kid.
We don't miss you.
We had a good time anyway.
Great.
Okay and the other amount of material.
Okay.
Thanks a lot Neil.
I'll read the nudge.
Okay and over you right after the news will come out of her...
And we want everybody to get in their car right now or get in somebody else's car.
Just roll the windows down.
Little air go through there.
Of course don't make any grotesque gastric sounds because you can bust it for that too.
But we'll crank it up and just play it for four or five minutes and see if anybody gets busted.
It's a clean version but how the hell are they going to know?
That's the whole point.
See that's how ridiculous it is.
It's just...
It's a mess.
Okay Gale Bright's got the new NYOD news.
We'll come back with two live douche at 1205.
And then of course the Rick and Puts are almost forgetting about that.
But I don't think I have a sheet here.
What are they doing today?
Nothing that's just their usual crap.
Okay.
Sports stock at 605 and the Yankees at 730 tonight.

Girls don't end that soon.
I'm both old, but just famous, wrong baby.
Don't put me in the mud.
Because my leg just hit a ride.
And then you shouldn't be a man.
I'm all over your mama.
Just don't let you have.
I know you'll need a good baby.
You need your cool woman.
You need your mama.
Just don't let you have.
I'm all thinking of you.
I'll go without you.
My appetite is low.
Good, me.
So hardy.
You know I'm so hardy.

You can think I'm just pretty.
You can call me Presorted.
But you think I'm a dog when I leave you lost into 30.
I'll play with your heart.
Don't let you know it's a shame.
I'll be blowing your mind.
Don't touch your wings to the end.
I'm just like that man.
They call Georgia.
It's a pie.
I'll break their girls heart.
And I make them cry.
I'm like the dog in a sheet.
I'll break your girls heart.
And I make them cry.
I'll break their girls heart.
Hey.

I'm five guys.
We walk around them,
And we steal or hum their rise.
We are MAN,
Show them to Mummy,
Notice time with Anne Goodbyes,
Lou Peace,
Can you tell us
what happened?
We're on an agreement.
I am thinking we should talk this thing over.
The German Mickey Mouse Club Sunday to 9 after Master Race Theater.
And this time no more Mr. Lice Guy.
Who is this?
A nutty Mickey Guy with a bathrobe on MTV.
We'll check that out.
It's 12 minutes past noon at WIOD.
Thank you.
Sometimes I feel myself.
12, 14 at WIOD.
This mobile's got to be gone, right?
No, it's still here.
I can't believe it.
How are you doing?
I don't believe you're there.
Yep. Try and...
Uh, quit.
Enough of this obscenity stuff, but it brought to mind.
I want to ask you a question since you're an insider.
You might know the answer.
I'm an insider in one.
Your Jezone Fernandez is great looking at...
She looks on TV in person.
Better.
No, I'm serious.
I'm serious.
You just asked me a question.
Okay. I think you're a wise guy.
You're giving honest answers.
She's a better looking person than she is on TV.
This is wonderful.
Okay, here she is.
Did you see her last night?
Look, right?
No.
Even John was like...
In the middle of the story, he was like snake in a pig.
It was ridiculous.
Yeah.
But what's the story with her?
She's single.
I only hear a joke and she's...
You're called up.
Date line.
Okay, I'll find a good date for it.
12, 15 at WIOD.
We have an opening in Brought.
There's nothing that just turns me off more than these people.
Let's sit out there gaping into their damn TV sets.
Getting all hoarded and excited about some beautiful looking babe or something.
Now, who the hell is this guy in the bathing suit though on MTV?
Anybody know?
WIOD.
I want to talk to Neil.
Okay, hold on a minute.
Okay, pal.
Let's go to Miami.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Can't we?
Okay.
Okay.
You know, I'm done first.
I'll cut.
Well, I've been cutting my liquid.
There's a water shortage here.
Um, but you know,
I don't know.
Do you have been well?
I understand.
But I think you look mad.
What the hell are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
What do you mean I haven't been well?
I had a stroke that's like two months ago.
I know.
I know.
Well, um...
What are you talking about?
What's up, Doc?
Yes?
Um...
Oh man, talk about restraint.
Do you have to go ahead and say something.
Anything.
The restraint's all off now.
Yeah.
The restraint's all off now.
What do you want?
Camper early.
Are you hanging out with Henry now?
No.
Is this like an early eloquent lunch?
I want to say, I just want to say...
Say what?
I love you, Jim Hansen, wherever you are.
Oh, God.
It's 1217 at WIOD.
Talk about plowed.
Even the field never got plowed like she is.
Let's go to Miami.
Hello.
Hi.
Never trust a woman with a raspy voice, okay?
Because it means she's changed smokes and she drinks like a fish.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Go ahead.
Hi, um...
You know what I mean?
A cool friend of mine, a douchebag.
What is it?
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
Who is it?
What's the color of a friend of his douchebag?
And that's it, he's gone.
First of all, I thought it was a woman.
It turned out to be a little punk kid.
I hope those kids back in school the rest of this week.
Send them back to the show, alright?
Boy, thank God I'm going on vacation next week.
Uh...
Let's go to lighthouse point, WIOD.
Hello, Neil.
Yeah.
How you doing?
Okay.
Yeah, we were done at, uh, pumping old things and seeing you wanted to thank you for trying them, uh...
Miracle things.
You'll be back there again?
Oh, yeah.
When you coming back?
Well, I don't know yet, I'll let you know.
Okay, great.
Thanks a lot.
Okay.
See ya.
Wow.
1217 at WIOD.
You can see we've made a tremendous impact here today, WIOD.
Yes, the canal.
Speaking.
The canal.
Yeah.
That broad was wasted.
Yeah, she was good, wasn't she?
I thought you never touched a woman with a raspy voice and, uh, in coherent.
They're just the spastic.
She was...
She was a...
I don't want to generalize, but I think you'll find it's true.
Always.
I love you a long time.
Chain smokers, big drinkers.
Heavy diet out there.
This thing with women who drink like fish.
Oh, here's the guy in the bathroom again.
Look at that.
Drinking green stuff out of a cup.
Out of a blender.
What is...
What's the story?
What do you want?
Sir.
Just a say aye.
Okay.
1218 at WIOD.
We have an opening and I think they're all on some heavy duty stuff right now.
Broward 524 WIOD and Palm Beach.
655 WIOD.
I could just put that on the endless loop and play that till two o'clock.
I'd enjoy it.
WIOD.
Good one.
Okay, let's do a little break here.
Boy, I'll tell you this is something.
I think what you're hearing right now is so perfect for this community.
WIOD.
WIOD.
Hi, Neil.
Yeah.
Long time listener, first time caller.
Uh-huh.
I was wondering, you guys doing another remote?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Are you doing another remote?
So what are you doing with it?
Listen.
Can I ask you a question?
What?
We are promoting these remote.
I mean, tell us, coming out of my ears.
Okay.
So you know we're doing another more.
You know, they're doing the thing at, uh, at that Tuesday tonight with the Dick Tray.
Night out.
You're going to be...
We're all doing the thing at Vincent's Camera on Saturday.
Now, you already know that.
Isn't there something else you can, uh, offer to the, to humanity?
Yes.
But I don't think I can give it to you through the phone.
Okay.
1219 at WIOD.
Let's tell you about specs, speak of the devil.
Specs music.
I'm dying on my hair.
1222, another mobile and brown, hello.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
I want to talk to Neil.
Speaking.
Hi, Neil.
How are you?
Okay.
Listen, I was a new young girl last week and I haven't been tuned into how it's turned.
And, uh, basically, if you could believe what he was doing on a radio, he was asking having a, uh, a specs show.
I was just wondering how he was doing.
So what's new about that?
He does that every day.
Yeah, he has a, uh, a hypnotist gone.
Yeah.
And they were just going through everything.
I mean, it really made it sound just going up at two hours.
Yeah.
How, how would they allow to get away with that?
Well, it seems to be so much, uh, things you don't allow to do.
Because they're in New York.
They're not down here.
Okay.
They're in New York, Philadelphia and Washington.
They're like in places they're almost civilized.
They're not in this deep southern Ku Klux Klan.
The end of the fall, fascist ultra right wing paranoid, psychotic place.
Does that answer your question?
That answer your question.
One more question.
You were playing the two live crew song before.
Are you allowed to do that?
I get the feeling what we need here today is a parrot.
I just keep repeating the same thing.
But if I just turn it a little while.
It's the edited version.
It's not the nasty version.
Well, you think I'm going to play the other one on the air here?
I was wondering.
I was wondering.
I was wondering if the point I heard in the middle of that.
The point I'm trying to make is that the stupid thing in Broward,
where if they hear you, if they put you over to give you a ticket,
and they hear you playing a two live crew on your stereo,
they can arrest you for that.
And my point is how the hell did they know which one you're playing
unless they listen all the way through?
Or they confiscate the CD or the kazami?
What the hell are we talking about?
That's the point.
One more thing.
Did you see Ted Coppoli of the night?
No.
He had...
I know.
1224 at WIOD.
Some of these people, man, you could repeat the same thing over and over a million times.
They absolutely don't hear it.
It does not penetrate their skull.
An open line in Broward, 524, Kamikaze, 524, WIOD.
Let's go to Pompato.
Hi, Neil.
Hi.
I hope that this isn't repetitious.
I did tune in a little late.
I was wondering on the dawn of hue this morning...
Repetitious.
Repetitious, yeah.
Luther was screaming at that man to say...
Yeah, we are not going to discuss it.
Okay, we're not going to discuss it.
WIOD, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yeah.
How's it going?
Okay.
Ventureships, huh?
Yeah.
How do you like it?
Hey, Michel, Neil.
Hey, listen.
WIOD.
Hello.
WIOD, what do you want?
Hi, can I talk to Neil?
How old are you?
Ten.
No chance.
Two open lines are both in Broward.
524, 946, 3, 524, WIOD.
But, you know, I went through that whole little exercise there in noon.
Which isn't a big deal.
But I mean, to have this is the response to it.
You just have to scratch your head and wonder.
I think you get what you deserve, okay?
WIOD.
Hey, you need to talk to Neil.
Yes, speaking.
Hey, Neil.
Do you want to know so much about your remote?
Go ahead, it's going to be a shot.
Go ahead, go ahead.
It's going to be remote that the Cubs ever would again.
Cute.
Very.
WIOD.
Where's notis?
Yeah.
What's happening, ma'am?
Two open lines in Broward.
524, 946, 3, Miami.
Hi, Neil.
Yeah.
How are you?
Okay.
Good.
What a group of calls.
I know.
About like the last 30 minutes.
I feel like I can do no wrong at this point.
I just wanted to know if I may.
Oh, I'm the air called Nick, a wooden tampon.
Mm-hmm.
Once.
Is that possible?
Yeah.
All right.
And I'd like to say hi to my husband, Eric, who loves your show.
You have a great day.
Okay.
Good luck.
WIOD.
I'll need it.
Yes.
Hello.
Yeah.
No, we don't talk to more on Sir.
WIOD.
Hi.
Can I talk to Neil?
Speaking.
Hi.
I think that everybody should just get in my bunch of G-strings and park it on the WARS
yards.
Right.
And crank the record.
We'll play the record on the radio.
Crank it up.
Why not?
He's got hormones.
He probably likes to see a couple of G-strings.
Yeah.
Oh, no.
Maybe that's what he needs.
He's a crotch wall.
Okay.
Thanks.
WIOD, the home of the great intellect.
Deal.
Yeah.
What are you song for so upset today with going on?
WIOD.
I-O-D.
Hi.
I'd like to speak to Neil.
Speaking.
Neil, how are you?
Great.
You know that Nick, he's really missing out great opportunities.
I really get some cue and just acting nasty on the TV on Sunday night or Saturday night.
Sabado, he gone to you ever watch that?
Yeah.
They even sing a song.
Waila, la colita.
Oh, I don't want to go into that.
Volca, hello.
Leo.
Yeah.
Play a song again.
They have the infectious quality to it.
Well, sure beats you.
How are these calls?
I'd say to that.
I never used to like it.
I'm beginning to think, hey, not so bad after all.
I have never heard such a bunch of mindless morons.
And this proves exactly what I've said.
That's why I gave up doing those kind of shows three years ago.
I wouldn't go back to it if they paid me $1,000 a minute.
Okay.
Because it's a waste of time.
The message out there are asses.
They're morons.
You know, they think it's all a bit- everything is a big joke.
Okay.
These punks out there, everything is a big stinkin' joke.
And they don't care about anything, okay?
So when they come and card them off the camp, like, hey, don't bother me with it.
I can't be bothered.
I'll be busy.
But you got to be on the plane across the sea.
You got to admit, Leo, it sounds like it's the beginning of a rosional freedom.
You had the beginning, right?
Mm-hmm.
Okay, sir.
Good luck to you, too.
You'll need it.
We haven't opened it.
Oh, geez.
You know, I'm just sitting here.
I could just squeeze my head like a big zit and just let it all squit my brain, squish out.
What's left?
Listen to these comments.
It sounds like it's the beginning of the rosional freedom.
Yeah, right.
Right.
That's what they said at Treblinka, too.
Let's go to a mobile in Miami.
How do you like it?
Okay, great.
What is this?
Welcome to Stupid City, sir.
Yeah, I've been here for a while.
We're having a sale on stupidity today, okay?
It's like a buck 14 a pound.
Well, hopefully I can make some intelligent comments.
Like a buck 18 a ton.
Neil, I've been listening to all this talk about the flag burning issue.
And of course, it's very interesting.
Sure, there is no issue.
Yeah, I understand.
There is no issue.
The only issue is created by idiotic, neanderthal politicians like George Bush.
Well, I can't solve the other problems, so I've made it into a problem.
Well, let me just comment on that if I might.
Did you see on the other night on CNN when the Supreme Court, which by the way was only five before decision,
one more liberal dies and we're in big trouble in the country.
One more liberal just as dies and we're in big trouble.
He puts his hand over his heart.
He says, I know in my heart, this is the right thing.
Yeah.
And here we are.
And I've heard anybody make this comment.
It's the only reason I'm calling.
We're going to spend a billion dollars of legislative time in the House of Representatives.
Right.
While people are living on the streets, sleeping on cardboard, board boxes, and facing their ass in the winter time on the streets and the sidewalks.
Right.
And we don't have the money to deal with that.
But we do have the money so we can go fight the big constitutional fight.
And have a constitutional amendment requires them.
It requires two thirds of the states ratified.
That's right.
I was going to take more effort, more man hours, and more goddamn time than you can check a stick at.
That's what the people of this country are all about.
Stupid, idiotic symbolism.
Simplistic answers to complicated problems.
It's the age of morons.
That's my comedy.
We've spent billions of dollars of legislative time when we had to deal with it.
But there's no point in getting excited.
All you've got to do is listen to the calls the last 40 minutes.
And that should tell you everything you need to know.
Well, you know, I'll take it.
And then Rick and Putsk it on the afternoon and Rick and I said,
Where have you got a vote?
And we got to get back.
I mean, what the hell are you people talking about?
Okay.
In fact, most of these people, you do a service to keep them at home and don't let them vote.
Well, you know what you have to have that.
Because they're dangerous.
You have a great mass of American morons in this country.
They keep putting these people in office.
And before you know it, we're going to be right in the crapper.
We're already in the crapper, sir.
And everybody's too stupid to understand it.
It's like the horse is out of the barn and five miles down the road.
And everybody said, oh, he might get out.
He might get out.
He's gone.
Isn't it sick?
You know, we're going to pass the law so you put one guy away.
We're going to, you know, we went through this whole thing with the FCC and this Al Sykes and all these right, right wing,
Ultran, Neanderthals up there at the FCC.
And now they're like finding people and they're going to turn what we can say and what we can't say.
And they're all concerned about words because they're going to hurt, who the hell have ever heard that words hurt children?
Where did that come from?
Who made that up?
Well, the same people that are running your government.
Not my government, sir.
Unfortunately, it's our governor.
Yeah, good luck to you.
Not mine.
1231 at WIOD.
We have an open line in the day.
751 camp.
751, Deutschland.
Let's go to Miami.
Hello.
Neil.
Yeah.
Hey, is there any week for that burping syndrome tape?
WIOD.
There's a lot of the news, please.
Speaking.
Neil.
Yeah.
Neil?
Yes.
A new.
Yeah.
Come on.
You can do it, sir.
Blur it out.
When in doubt, alert it out.
Blur it out.
Blur it.
Okay, sir.
Good one.
WIOD.
Yeah, I want to speak to Neil, please.
Speaking.
Neil.
Yeah.
This is Ray from Miami.
How's it going?
Okay, Ray.
Listen, I just want to let you know.
Let's go ahead and hear it.
Eastern Airlines, like you show on every day.
Well, that's good.
You'll hear you sound good.
Yeah.
I like when you're passing.
1232 at WIOD.
We have an opening in day cutting.
You wonder why the East-Earns have problems?
751.
WIOD.
751.
9463.
Ray, I got news.
I got news for you.
Boy, if brains were dangerous, you could be the runway.
Okay, that's how safe you would be.
Anyway, Father's Day coming up in just a couple of days on Sunday.
And today here, it's Thursday already, and if you're still in believe it or not,
you're behind your teeth.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
You know, it's really, it's just incredible.
I was sitting here thinking during the break.
Thank God, I gave up all that crap.
You know, and every once in a while, I get something in my mind must.
Go like twisted or something, like twisted sister, and I lose track of where I am.
And I get off on something like this, and then I realize that it's just an incredible
waste of energy and time.
It's like talking to the dead.
One in seven Americans suffers from a terrible affliction.
And while others find it funny, to those who have it, it's no laughing matter.
It's called frequent burping syndrome.
It's terrible.
I'll be on a date or a business meeting and excuse me.
See what happened?
Frequent burping syndrome.
It can ruin your life, but it doesn't have to.
Now there's a clinic that can help.
Trained specialists, sensitive to the needs of compulsive belchers.
A special place known as burp hinders.
Gosh, burp hinders saved my life.
I'm going to join and I were in love.
I really wanted to ask for to marry me, but I just knew that when the moment of truth came,
I'd let out with a big ripper.
You know?
Burp hinders.
No shame.
No guilt.
No more tummy rumbling.
Smelly belches.
No more stopping in mid-sentence to unblock a big cheesy blaster.
Just carrying professionals.
And to help you need.
Don't wait.
Here's the number to call.
555-2877-1555-
Burp hinders.
Call today and stop being so gross.
I have no life.
I know.
1237 at WIB.
This mobile in Miami could be there.
Hello.
And it is.
I need you.
How you doing?
Good.
Sorry I missed you.
We're right in my neighborhood yesterday at 6.
But you know, one of those things.
Yeah.
Well, we'll be back down there again Saturday at Benson's camera.
Oh, okay.
And I'll get to see you then.
Anyway, I am the most liberated person.
I have two daughters.
I don't want them to be virgins.
I mean, I know they're not.
Well, listen there.
If you want to leave your number.
No, it's like the way...
A lot of guys in the audience would be calling.
But yesterday I was in the car with my daughter.
You were off, so we put on a station.
And on comes Madonna's song.
And I like...
I couldn't believe it.
That hanky, panky.
Yeah.
I love the tune.
I mean, it's like I find myself looking for it and wanting to sing it.
Yeah, I find myself looking for it too.
Yeah, right.
But the bottom line is like, what do you say like to an 11-year-old or something that's listening to this?
And you hear, you know, time me up and thank me, you know, and I love it.
I mean, like, how do you explain something like that?
And I'm very liberal.
You know, what do you say when they say, oh, what does that mean?
You want the answer?
Yeah.
Oh.
That would do it, I think.
That'll do it?
Yeah.
It's a great song, if you heard it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, it's good.
I think it is.
That would do it.
Give me a break.
Have a nice day.
I'm fact, when you were picture of somebody that I think you'll enjoy when I get back to my office.
Really?
Yes.
In fact, what's the best number?
757.
Yeah.
751-6.
751-6.
Okay, great.
Have a good day.
Okay, see you.
1238 at WIOD Palm Beach.
Hey, how you doing?
Okay.
I think I've regained my senses.
I think I was losing it there for an hour or so, but I think I'm coming back to Earth.
Well, I think you started to hedge towards issues.
Yeah.
God forbid.
Yes, definitely.
I'm looking at you to hedge toward tissues.
Yes.
Ampathy is alive in World of America.
Don't start getting serious, I'm not sure.
We'd like to be totally out of touch, ridiculous, and demoron.
Definitely.
I think that the blessfulness in Broward County is attributed to ignorance.
I would like to, yeah, bet.
That was Casey Kasey doing a thing on a dog that had died.
Yeah.
I'd like to dedicate that to Sheriff Nick, and if you've got it, could you run it?
For sure, if you speak.
Hey, you speak.
It's a technique.
Speak with 2Ss as an SS.
Yes, definitely.
Bernie soon will be goose stepping all the way through Browardville.
Or, while certainly not using, maybe goose stepping.
Have a nice life.
You too.
Now, we're up to our long distance dedication.
And this one is about kids and pets and the situation that we can all understand.
Whether we have kids or pets or near.
It's the same thing.
It's an adio hyal.
And here's what he writes.
Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request, but I'm quite sincere,
and it'll meet a lot if you play it.
We feel there was a death in our family.
He was a little dog named Snuckles.
But he was most certainly a part of, let's go and try it again.
From coming out of the record.
Play the record, okay?
Please.
See, when you come out of those uptempo damn numbers, man,
it's impossible to make those transitions.
And then you've got to go into somebody dying.
You know, they do this to me all the time.
I don't know what the hell they do it for, but damn it.
If we can't come out of a slow record, I don't understand it.
It's down on the phone.
Okay, I want a damn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a f***ing uptempo record.
Every time I do a damn deaf dedication.
Now, make it, and they also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week.
It's a god last damn time.
I want somebody who's a f***ing brain to not come out of a f***ing record.
That's uptempo, and I got to talk about a f***ing draw of dying.
What is this f***ing?
What is this f***ing?
Embondorous, man.
Pondorous f***ing.
Embondorous.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Call 41 at WIOD.
Here's a Miami call on the Palm Beach line.
He's a family man.
Yes, sir.
Wasn't it a green call yesterday?
That person that did Henrietta with Gilbert.
Henrietta.
Remember that call?
It was, I don't remember, it was like 22 or 25 or 22.
You said Gilbert, you know, that he owed money and all that.
Oh, yeah, that was good.
There were a lot of good calls.
I'm funny, it's exactly the same.
They were real good because they're good and hear most of them.
That's why, like, going out on remote sets is the best part.
You can't hear most of the calls.
They're like, often, they're like,
like, that, and you like that.
How many people were there if you took a guess?
I don't know.
A couple hundred, three hundred.
All together, I don't know.
My girlfriend, your wife, she saw this parking lot was full.
It was packed. It was real good.
Good people, too.
I don't know where they are today, but there were some good people
who are here yesterday.
I mean, real good.

Be grateful that it doesn't last all year.

He's about two feet tall and has head this size of a Humpty Dumpty and a little tiny
body about three inches tall.

here's a mobile and pond beach.
When is Nis?
Boy you gotta relax.
Can you say Josh fine?
You gotta relax your making me nervous.
Why?
Good.
You're gonna get sick over the airway.
No, get out of here.
I'm as mellow as a cucumber.
Yeah, well it's pretty mellow up here.
Nice ride on the turnpike.
Uh-huh.
And uh.
That's all just be oblivious and dumb and just passive.
It's a good word.
That's a little bit of good word.
That's a beautiful day after, I guess.
Uh-huh.
So what else is going on?
That's it.
Yeah.
We're just passive.
We're just hanging.
Well, so you've got our goggles.
That's what they've heard that a lot in the deep south.
We're just hanging.
We're just thinking the hugging game was in Rower County
and the players started swearing.
They dragged off the ice.
Yes, sir.
Putting the damn boney.
Uh-huh.
And if they found out they played with a puck,
they'd really get upset.
Yeah, well, can't I'll be nice, guys.
Hang in there, Neil.
Okay, sir.
Good luck to you.
May the good news be yours.

655 Auschwitz.
Let's go to Hollywood.
What is this?
Yeah, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Don't they call private cops private dicks?
Yes.
Doesn't that make Sheriff Nick a public dick?
Yes, sir.
Isn't that obscene?
No.
Just remember.
Okay.
W.I.O.D.
I had some mobiles there a long way to talk to Neil Rogers.
A long way?
Is it?
Is it?
Sir, if you don't turn that radio down,
you're going to have a long way to get on.
You don't sound like yourself.
What are you screaming about?
I can't hear myself.
Yeah, well, you know something.
If we're lucky, we won't be able to either.
Oh, I think that's just happened.
1255 at W.I.O.D.
Sunrise.
Hello, Neil.
What is this?
Neil, I know how you do it.
I know how you do it.
Yeah.
You're, you got to be on valium to put up with his biggest collection of
rectums I've ever heard.
Sometimes I feel that life is passing me by.
This is absolutely.
Hey, you know, I just got my paychecks here.
It's Thursday.
Yeah.
And I looked at it and I calm down real fast.
You know what I mean?
Hey, listen to the least.
At least I can buy a plane ticket out of here.
Quick.
And you will.
Yes.
This is absolutely absurd.
Sometime.
Well, you can't mess with it.
Don't ever overestimate the intelligence of the American public here
because they'll shock you every stinking time.
And do me another favor.
Sometime.
When my son from KPX, Matt calls.
Yeah.
Don't let him on anymore.
Matt.
I'm sick of hearing.
Wait a minute.
Who is this?
This is Matt's old man.
Yeah, this isn't Lou.
No.
Oh, that's a different Matt.
Different Matt.
Okay.
Yeah, Matt was down at your station with the sunrise KPX class.
Oh, yeah.
When they coming back.
And he's the one who calls you and sounds an aeza all the time.
And he's the one who really doesn't care about KPX at all.
Oh, I know what you're talking about.
Yeah, he sounds like a little, uh, not a kid.
Yeah, he is.
Mm-hmm.
He is.
And I was driving down 95 the other day.
Oh, I got a great car we can play for Matt, okay?
Yeah.
I got the great ones his birthday coming up.
Uh, his birthday's not until October.
Well, that's not that far off.
I got a great one.
You hang up.
I got a great birthday gift idea for Matt, okay?
But you're something to keep him occupied.
Keep him off the phone.
Okay.
Have a great life.
You have a good vacation.
Thank you.
Bye.

Mm-hmm.

When naughty, Susie catches a cold.
She needs a real life.
Not.
Just like real babies.
But that's not all that's not as Susie will do.
Put her over your shoulder and pat her back.
And she burps real baby birds.
