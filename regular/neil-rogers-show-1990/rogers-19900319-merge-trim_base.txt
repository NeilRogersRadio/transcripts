This comes across the timeline passes off to the top of the key taken by Julius E.T.
Bob Oh, Bob, what an electrifying one-handed windmill dam!
Oh, the Dr. E.T.
This is the doctor.
And when I'm on a fast break from the usual breakfast routine, there's only one place for me.
Slam, dunk it, don't knock.
Check out the All Star lineup.
They got Dale Dawkins, Chackloth Thunder, Donuts, Will Chameleon, Finger Rolls, and even Moses Malone.
One-handed jam, Bill Donuts.
Hmm, hmm.
Hey, Doc, how about a box and one to go?
Yeah, baby.
And give me a cup of coffee.
My one, medium one, a lardewon.
A lardewon.
But no Korean, please.
Oh, that's bad.
So make your best move to slam, dunking Donuts.
We stub off food in your face.
Oh, terrible.
Get it off, okay?
Stop the cart.
They suck.
They're terrible.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
Crank.
I love those.
Man, that's my favorite thing.
And the whole world is when we get them when they're calling in.
And as soon as they realize they're on the air,
they go into a cold panic.
W-I-O-D.
Hey, Neal, how you doing?
Okay.
Did you ever get tested?
Wait a minute.
Wait, uh, see, I can see the way these little games.
Just keep talking real fast so I can't keep you on hold, right?
You're not fooling me.
Go ahead, though.
The technique worked.
All right, it's quick.
I promise.
You weren't fooling me, though.
Did you think you were fooling me?
Well.
You know, what can I say?
Yeah, don't even take a breath.
Just keep spewing it out.
When and down, spewing it out.
That's what Joey says.
Hey, you got to watch when you're spewing things out.
Now, what do you think of Bill Marshall being our new sidekick, so?
Oh, he's an asshole.
Thank you.
He's an asshole.
Get him out of there.
Don't hold back.
I like this real audience a lot.
No wonder I stick around in this God for sake in hell.
We got a great audience, you know?
They don't beat around the bush, Bill.
They come right out.
This fact thinks you're an asshole, Bill.
It's Miami-Man.
And he's only got very thin hair, too, by the way.
Oh, yeah?
He probably hangs out with Alex and Eric Lambert.
Yeah, they can go to those hair transplant, but together.
And then, you've ever find that MSU fightsong, you got to play it in the other end of the sweet 16.
Oh, don't start.
I'm going to call it that.
I don't know where it is, though.
I don't know what the hell stand did with it.
Yeah, you got to get on his butt, so to speak.
No, thanks.
Yeah, okay.
Not for me.
Okay, well, my-
I don't know how big around here.
I don't know where the hell it is.
Okay.
How about those Michigan Wolverines, huh, Mandage?
Oh, I'll tell you what.
Woo!
Yeah.
Oh, I loved every second of that one.
Yeah, they can take a shower for a long time.
149 points.
149 points.
Yeah.
What the hell is that?
Boy, Ellen Merrimaut, it's a good team.
I'll tell you what, I didn't really underestimate it.
Yeah, they are good.
They can shoot.
They can shoot.
So to speak.
Yeah, so to speak.
Okay, Neil, we're all behind you.
Oh, what is that name?
I just did Joe.
Okay.
I'll get emotional.
See ya.
W-I-O-D.
Neil.
Yeah.
Guess what?
I can't hear you.
Hello?
When you're going to spew whatever you're about to spew, at least make sure we hear it.
I know, you're great.
I know that.
Could you put me at home?
Sure.
See, butlicker.
See, that butlicker, I don't go for that.
The engraciators out there.
Does Joey like that?
He likes it, doesn't he?
Yeah, he likes to be stroked.
No, he likes to.
So to speak.
He likes conflict?
Yeah.
When's that going to start?
Oh, you mean with management?
Well, they've been going on for a long time.
Over the ratings.
Boy, he's worked in a lot of places for a guy 70.
Okay, we have an open line in Dade County, 7519-463.
If you want to take any cheap shots at Joey, now's the time to do it, because Bill is here.
None of you know who Bill is.
Or you can call him take cheap shots at him.
All of the one guy did a good job.
There were more than well-known.
Well, that was pretty much a generic cheap shot.
You can call anybody an asshole.
Yeah, but in your case, he meant it.
Here's a mobile in...
How did the remote go Saturday, Chuck?
Good?
Where was it?
Chuck, good to the Saturday.
We can magazine show.
I forgot.
Well, actually, I slept.
I can't believe it.
I slept till 20 till noon on Saturday.
I haven't slept.
Usually, my dogs give me up at about 1.7, which they did do.
But then I went back to bed and I just slept like a baby.
I haven't slept that late in years.
Well, I used to do eight to midnight.
There are a lot of nights I go out to eat, come home and watch a little TV, go to bed at three,
and sleep till 10 or 11, even noon some days.
But now, that's a change.
Since I did that morning show on Zaden, beat the crap out of Joey.
I mean, here's a...
You didn't have to beat the crap out of Joey there.
Wait a minute.
You hear that?
You hear the racket coming from FM?
It's a low rumble.
Does that happen on Saturday?
No.
No, sometimes from this side.
If they're producing...
Sometimes.
Okay, here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
And that also frosted my butt when he had what's his name?
Larry Brenleron here.
And the guy called him wanted him to play the Bill Calder song sometimes on the...
on the...
What is that he plays?
The flute?
What is that thing he plays?
Whatever it is, the mouth organ.
And he wouldn't play it.
Malice got all bent out of shape.
What is his problem?
Okay, why can't he just warm up a little bit?
Okay?
Am I right or is it my imagination?
Melvin says I'm right.
Chuck, of course, also says I'm right, which is surprising because he's a newsman.
He tries to be near the middle.
What?
And what do you say, sir?
I say you're right.
Okay.
Uncle Neil.
You're just a butt-looking.
What is it?
Uncle Neil, the news...
The news can't say a few moments ago.
This Tommy Mercer says that all the Canadians are happy.
That baseball is going to start.
Why don't they just go home?
Yeah, well that's what they're excited about.
They're going to be playing in Toronto and Montreal.
They're all on their way home right now.
Go home for hockey.
They'll leave us alone.
That's right.
It's almost time for the Stanley Cups.
So put on your cups and head north, folks.
Get boot of here already, A.
Yeah, A.
Joey will take him.
A.
Put him on the A train.
The A train, and we'll listen to...
With Joey S. Conductor.
You would love to sit here in life at my material because mine is funny.
And I don't have three by five cards, Bill.
Okay, listen, have a great day, sir.
Thank you, sir.
All right, 12 minutes back.
You don't have to knock Joey just because he's not here.
Where's he?
He in town?
I just came in to get some promotion because he's in town.
He's talking about Joey and...
Well, what the hell is there to talk about?
He's a potty mouth-old man with no act and no show.
And he says, faggot every 30 seconds.
Has that show?
Exactly what it is that gets folks to listen.
When you rip him.
What?
That's it.
We think that's one of the...
One of the gonna start writing it down.
It didn't help but the she...
I talked about him incessantly over there and his numbers dropped like a rock.
Oh, wait.
He went down to a one-three.
You know what a one-three translates to.
It's like...
We had more kids in this room than we're listening to Joey and Morning Drive.
Well, that was a great inside job over there.
Management, submarine that show,
much more effectively than even competition could have.
Oh, here we go.
In other words, these guys that blames the management.
Thank God I never do that.
It's 12th, 13th at WIOD.
We'll be right back.
See what's in.
Double-dry fire, dig.
Trump, the monster ego.
Live like a king.
And frolic twid, some new-byel chicks.
And had himself a fling.
Little wife, Viva, no.
Sood that arasco, Trump.
And soop the house, and 20 mill.
And other fancy stuff.
Oh, together they would shut her.
Buying anything for sale.
Viva, no kipped.
Oh, look out, perched.
Wild Trump went out for sale.
Starlit spam sent in bows.
Wood bow and air he came.
I rate Pimps wood lord, their price.
When Trump roared out his name.
Oh, Trump, the monster ego.
Live like a king.
And frolic twid, some new-byel chicks.
And had himself a fling.
Then one night it happened.
All the papers gave the score.
Trump's game was a doatery.
To Ivana, this meant wolf.
Castles and casinos.
Trump would all retain.
Por Ivana got the shaft.
Pre-Nup chose made it plain.
Without his lifelong friend.
His marriage on the shelf.
Then Trump's that monster ego.
Gladly made love to himself.
Oh, Trump, the monster ego.
Live like a king.
And frolic twid, some new-byel chicks.
And had himself a fling.
Trump, the monster ego.
Live like a king.
And frolic twid, some new-byel chicks.
And had himself a fling.
Too long.
Too long, ponderous, weak, pretty weak.
1218 at WID.
What would you get down there?
Scale of 1 to 2.
Oh, definitely towards a 2.
A 1?
On a scale of 1 to 2, it would definitely be on here or 2.
Up near a 2?
Boy, this man is profound.
You've been hanging around with Joey too long.
Yeah.
What do you mean not that song?
That's his latest, more than Joey plays.
That's right.
If he'd start playing, he might get a 2.
I doubt it.
But it's worth a shot at this point.
1219 at WID.
Bill Marshall is hanging out in the background, making guttural sounds.
Here's a mobile on I-95.
Are you there?
Yeah, I know how you're doing.
OK.
I got a question for Bill.
That was pretty weak, wasn't it, that ACN bit?
No, it was great.
Crapie.
No, that's all right.
Bill was an Alex.
Listen, Bill, whatever happened at Guy Lary that was doing the show,
the weather reports, and all that.
You remember on the sheet?
He's living at a home in Philadelphia.
Is that guy, or is that guy?
That's like a retirement home.
Is that guy for real?
Old folks home.
Yeah, that guy is honest to God for real.
That's that guy's fond of.
Well, it was.
That was the highlight of the show as far as I'm concerned.
Well, it sure wasn't Joey.
It's like an idiot Savon type.
Knows every oldie ever recorded.
That was what he was fond of.
What do you mean an idiot Savon?
You mean literally?
Yes, honest to God.
Yeah, you were.
He was.
He was.
He was.
Are you serious?
I mean, Joey was exploiting somebody like maybe Gilbert.
He was exploiting someone.
Yeah, can you imagine?
Yes.
Well, Neil, do you know the guy I'm talking about?
No.
I don't know if there's a card around or something.
That guy is funny attack.
Well, great.
He's got a weird voice.
Mm-hmm.
Yes, he does.
Easy.
Well, that's going to be our joy for the show from 2 to 6.
He's going to be exploiting mentally handicapped
and retarded people.
Maybe they ought to have a guilt or playoff with that guy.
Him and him and Larry.
Okay, sir.
Thank you so much.
That's a revealing 20 afternoon at WIOD.
We have an open line in Dade County where Rainman just hung up 751.
9463, 751 WIOD.
One is the Oscars on.
Is that Sunday?
Saturday, Monday.
Next week?
Next week?
Monday?
Oh, well, we don't want to talk about it anyway.
I'm sure we'll hear lots about it in the afternoon.
Anyway, let's go to...
I'm serious.
I never really dreamed that I would get to the point where I'd be hostile
and bitter with this guy, but I am.
It's not a joke anymore.
He just bugs me.
You don't like me off.
No, I didn't say I don't like him because I don't even know him.
But I just...
He just says such frustrating stupid things, okay?
Okay?
Okay.
Good.
Here's a...
Mobile in Palm Beach.
Oh, that laugh is just...
There just ends chills up and down my spine.
Is it irritating to me?
You sound like a cross between Lee Fowler and Paul Harvey Jr.
You really do.
Yes, sir.
Hello.
Don't be intimidated by this spaker, sir.
Not at all, I am.
He's been sent here by Joy Reynolds.
He's an Ojrán provocateur.
I got a little bit of a Joey Spire for it for you.
Okay.
Well, actually, I want to talk to Bill.
Billy, you there?
I'm sure, sure, Ann.
Okay.
Yeah.
I go along with Ann.
Bill, I don't know if you remember.
I gave Joey a call on Saturday and I was at it.
Can you guys...
You're the one.
Yeah.
Well, I just Joey up.
I was at the Joey Wine.
He thought Neil ripped him so much all the time.
Yeah, you really didn't seem to have an answer form.
Because he sucks, sir.
Is that an answer that...
But see, Neil, the one thing he did say was that you have a key or a G-Go.
Almost like a...
No, I don't.
I just Steve Kane type of...
No, I don't have any E-Go, sir.
I have no E-Go.
I work with management that's brutal and I have no E-Go.
But why do you consistently rip, Joey?
Maybe Bill can answer something.
I just answer the question because I think he sucks.
Because it's something to do.
No, not at all.
I think...
What do you mean?
Didn't you just say before that I haven't been talking about him lately
and you came in to try to stir up a little publicity because he does...
Absolutely.
And nobody calls and you couldn't buy a show with the million dollars.
Oh, it's so difficult.
Something like that.
I would say something positive.
Hey, I think we're nearly...
I think we're nearly just a great job.
He goes up every morning and he's a big member of his own business.
He doesn't use anybody else's material.
Why not rip the personalities at the other stage?
I think Hayd Goldberg, my best friend, is wonderful.
He tells it like it is.
I think Chuck Meyer is a great American.
He's a wonderful newsman.
He's got a...
Would just die to have two to six in the afternoon?
He would.
He won't admit it.
But he wants to be a taco so bad.
And he would be good.
He would do a good job.
That's a great show on Saturday morning.
If nobody listens.
But Neil, how often do you do this except to make a point?
Look at Meg Green, for example.
She's a legend in her own mind.
Now she's going into TV.
She's lost control of herself.
She's gone nuts.
She is.
She's a legend among the blue hairs.
Well.
Every day when they go down to see the CD rate,
they have their little Meg Green picture in their wallet.
See how?
Look at that.
Meg said, don't worry.
It'll be okay.
Would you see Neil the plug that you just get into a bridge?
I got to make Green much better than what you gave to Chuck.
All right.
Joey's great.
Okay.
Joey's got the best.
It's like his of death.
Don't do that.
You're the one that brought him up.
You're the one that brought him up, sir.
I brought him up.
You've been ripping him for the last hour.
If I've been ripping Joey for the last hour, why?
First of all, let me say this to you, sir.
I have a question.
I didn't even think about Joey until his sidekick
muscled his way into the studio.
He worked there.
And now he's accomplished just what he wanted.
You're complaining about it.
He's happy about it, okay?
He worked there.
He needs the publicity.
This station don't give anybody any promotion.
Say goodbye, sir.
Who was that?
24 afternoon at WIOD.
We have an opening in Dave County, 751 WIOD.
If you have an opening in your teeth, then call
ProSmart Cosmetic Dentistry.
But what a segue that was, huh, Bill?
That was close.
That was pretty sneaky, wasn't it?
Very, very.
You have a little space there between your teeth.
I do.
And also in your forehead, I noticed.
But anyway, ProSmart Cosmetic Dentistry, these are
micro thin shells that they adhere to the surface of your natural teeth or caps.
Porcelain laminates.
There's no pain, no drilling, no slicing, no strain.
It'll make it a pleasure almost to go to the dentist.
That's why a lot of people, even people with money, walk around in a smile
and their teeth are, you ask yourself, how can they look like that?
Because people are terrified of the dentist, right?
They are.
You're not too crazy about going.
No.
No.
It's a halftime.
But anyway, ProSmart is endorsed by the American Deadly Association.
They did a whole hour on the Donahue show, which I saw the tape, and it's amazing.
The before and after, like it takes like 20 years of, in fact, joy might help him.
Take 20 years off your age.
You can look like 60.
And affordable payment plans are available.
It comes with a lifetime guarantee.
So if you're really disgusted with the chipped cracked teeth and the gaps between your teeth,
or whatever the problem is in Admouthe viewers, you call ProSmartle.
And if you tell them that Neil Rogers told you to call, you'll get a consultation,
absolutely free, and I'll show you what your teeth can look like.
Here's the number to call.
1-800-940-Smile.
They have offices in Dade, Broward and West Palm Beach.
You call them right now for your free consultation.
1-800-940-Smile for ProSmartle.
3-610-2-I-O-T
Listen, more fun on the number one sound.
In town, the wonderful radio, 61.
OK, next time Ron St. John calls, let's play that before he does his talk up.
It would fit right in 28 past noon.
Been a very pressure-packed Monday.
First, we had the two groups from Piper High outstanding.
Boy, they were great, some greater than others.
And then we had, what's his name in here?
And he just left, by the way, he'll be pleased to know that.
We froze him out.
See, that works every time.
And we got it so cold in here you could hang meat from the ceiling.
And we froze his ass out, so to speak.
So Bill Marshall's gone, and he was, what can I say?
What am I going to say?
Am I going to say that the guy was in here.
I told him to his face that his laugh made me, it made my skin crawl and the joey sucks.
And what else am I going to say?
I'm not talking just now that he left.
That's what I'm saying.
He's terrible.
Okay, dear field, hello.
Oh, get out of here.
Will you go to it somewhere else?
Here's a pay phone.
Bill.
Mr. G.
Was that BM next to you?
I beg your pardon?
Was that Bill Marshall?
BM, yes.
Well, that's why those are his initials.
Did you listen to him Saturday?
I heard about ten minutes.
They were ripping you with Dave Game.
Don't ask me what?
Dave Game?
Yes.
I'm not that big.
I know.
But speaking of that, we're having a march for the fat people.
Are you available?
A march for the fat people, only if Champagne Lou shows up.
He said he'd be there.
I'll bet.
So how's it going?
Okay.
Not too bad.
What's the purpose of your call?
You seem to be all over the place here today, kind of like Buc shot.
Or Buc me.
That's what they call me, Buc.
Yeah.
Buc him up.
Well, listen to me, I'll keep it in your pants.
Okay.
See ya.
See ya.
Round Bucca.
Yes, is that the Marshall and any relation to Peter Marshall?
Yes, that's his brother.
Oh.
And what are the nephew Pete LaCocke used to play baseball for the Cubs?
Right, I remember him well.
Just don't repeat his name.
I won't.
Okay.
Okay.
Excellent calls.
Now that we're stimulated this older crowd, it sounds like Joey's audience is tagging along now.
W-I-O-D.
It's Bill Marshall.
What is it?
Everything's fine.
Cuck.
Cuck.
Cuck.
That's the, that's getting close, boy.
His laugh is, you notice he restrained himself in here today, but on Saturday.
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I can't duplicate it.
It just makes your skin and crawl.
It's like somebody is scratching their fingers not on a blackboard, but on your back with real sharp like Elvira's fingernails.
Although I know a lot of you guys are into that.
A West Palm Beach.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How's it going?
Okay.
So baseball's finally going to be played.
Isn't that great?
Isn't that you excited?
No.
I'm offended, Neil.
What can I say?
I'm offended by what?
Oh, come on.
I mean, you got this crap going on in baseball and now Marino with the dolphins.
Forget about Marino in the dolphins for a while.
Okay, forget about football for a few months.
This is baseball.
But it's all the same in pro-span.
No, it's not.
It's all big business, but we don't care about that.
Oh, come on.
We're victims of our own childishness.
Tennis is lousy.
You got mac and row.
You got 30 year olds.
Who cares about tennis and about these 13 year old little pimpleheads that they want to make superstars out of?
You know, I figured it out.
Everybody in America is a star for five minutes.
Okay.
That's what it's all about.
Everybody's on inside edition and more public for five minutes.
And then they're most of them become obscure.
And now we have another star.
Did you see that?
That ought to be the national anthem looking for a hero.
Instead of the star-spangled banner, the people in this country are so into idle worship that it's frightening.
They're going to have a new hero every couple of minutes.
And then they want to tear them down and find out something disgusting in their background and then destroy them
and then make a new hero and then destroy them and get another one.
Right?
Exactly.
Did you catch that golf tournament yesterday?
It's disgusting.
Vile Vogueur.
What is it?
Golf tournament.
Are you crazy?
Oh, come on.
While the cubs were playing the Cardinals on WGN, I'm going to watch some stupid guy chasing a ball.
These are real gentlemen.
I'm talking about a real pro sport.
Oh, spare me the pain.
Will you please, sir?
No, seriously.
Real gentlemen.
That's the most boring.
That's not even a sport.
Listen to this.
Chasing some little ball around in a silly card.
Get out of here.
Yesterday.
We can go out to win more into the go out to Jack Arrandon, see all these 90-year-old farts chasing around their balls.
They're gentlemen out there.
Who cares?
They're gentlemen.
They're all got so much money that the skins game and this game, I'll give you a game.
Get out of my life already.
These people are like Nicholas, man.
If they were dropping bombs on Palm Beach County, he'd be talking about that short putt.
You know what I'm saying?
I listen to this for gentlemenly.
I'm serious.
That's all these guys care about.
Why don't they retire already?
Give somebody else a chance.
I listen to this, Neil.
I can't get hit on these balls.
Like seniors baseball, like these hockey guys.
That was so embarrassing a couple weeks ago when I had that old-timer senior hockey.
I'm not joking.
I couldn't believe it.
I thought it was a joke.
And here they had these old maple leaves out there.
They were clapping along on their skates that could barely stand up and no checking, man.
If they breathed on each other, they would fall down.
Here was the norm all men out there.
He's only 106 in Paul Henderson.
My God.
I know I'm rambling because you got started with a stinkin' golf.
It's pork.
I'm trying to say anything to avoid listening to you talk about golf.
But there's only one thing I can do when that's hang up.
1233 at WIOD, right Ron?
Grapefruit.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait. Wait. Let's give you the right answer.
Listenin' for fun on the number one sound in town.
The wonderful radio.
Sixty one.
That's right. 1233. The home of the jingles right here on A1A.
Rossing, John, I had got a little dedication to Ricky Tiggy and Joey Reynolds.
Everybody do it with the WDKR Twins.
All the DJs in the movie too.
The WDKR Twins.
Ron's getting here anyway.
Now this is an ACN, is it?
Okay, put him...
Oh, I cut him off. Wait a minute.
Are you still there?
He's still twisting.
Okay, 1234 at WIOD.
It's not on every show in town. You get Ron St. John.
You don't have to listen to magic to get the real Ron, okay folks?
And look at this.
Ron St. John, I hear you have Ron St. John on.
That's right, Rick.
Oh, listen to who this is.
It's Mr. Shine. He's shine.
No, you know. He's calling on the podium.
I left it.
He's doing his Ricky Tiki imitation.
I left it.
I left it up to my buddy Stan.
Yeah.
You know, I thought that you got it.
Left it up to your buddy Stan.
I thought I got the message through to you.
What?
I had like a real life that week.
I had to work.
What does that have to do with Neil Jr.?
I mean Stan, what does that have to do with him?
Because I left a message with him.
I called him and told him to relay the message.
He didn't relay any message.
Well, that's because he likes to...
The only time he leaves me a message is when it's something morbid and depressing.
Oh, God. When I hear his voice on an answering machine, I want to blow my brains up.
Believe me, I would have left.
Probably something sinister and depressing and morbid and really...
Oh, God.
More than less of that?
Down.
Oh, he makes less of it or seemed like a good humor man.
No, believe me, I would have rather been in there.
You know, you don't start making up stories.
I understand.
You would have been rather been in there.
We didn't need you. We had a bunch of good-looking guys.
I know. I realize this.
By the way, when are we going to start having more of these classes come in here like we did this more?
Now, that was some fun.
I know, I'm serious.
We had a good time here, right?
I did.
That was a hell of a time.
That was pretty interesting.
Got a couple of numbers, too.
Not just a little joke.
It's just a joke.
Hey, listen, I was radio-action.
I want to get all those homophobic maniacs hysterical.
I can't even say it. I'm forming it them out.
There he is. He's trolling again.
He's trolling.
Yeah, it's better to be looking at a dance party at 12-year-old girls on a year, right?
That's okay.
I don't read it.
I don't know.
And not only that, they're all pigs.
They're the ugliest kids I've ever seen in my life.
They got about 500 girls and four guys, and all the girls are dancing with each other,
and the four guys, they're dancing with each other because they don't want nothing to do with the 500 girls.
They're all little pigs.
They're piglets.
Honest to God.
Hey, where's that show from, too?
What's that?
Dance party.
I have no idea.
I think Tallahassee.
Yeah.
I had a radio-action the other day.
It's out of Philly.
Oh, that explains it.
Oh, those people in Philly are so ugly.
Woo.
I don't know if you heard this.
I'm sure you did.
Like, Joe.
I had a radio-action the other day.
Are you, what are you in slow-mo today?
Are you on doggy downers?
I'm already two minutes over on a break, and you're like, one word at a time.
I'm listening.
I'm listening to the guy that follows you at around five to five.
Speaking of shine, yeah.
And he goes to...
And he goes to...
You know, he waxes his head before he comes in here.
It's a true story.
He shines up his head.
He goes to the body shine shop before he comes in here.
I can't...
Anyway, David.
Have you ever heard of Nusson's like Mount Everest?
What is it?
I'm not a gylimatic auto.
You ever heard him go to his Tommy traffic thing?
Yeah, when he goes to the traffic.
No, well, it's always awkward.
It's never like...
There's never a transition.
Tom always comes on like, oh, okay.
I can see my own.
Exactly.
Oh, that's what it's supposed to be.
It's like a fumbling, bumbling...
Like Friday, it was like 10-2.
Do you have any idea how long the last break in this hour is going to be?
If you don't get to the point, we're going to be like an Allen.
Burke, 9-minute break.
All right, all right.
All right, let me...
He goes to Tommy traffic and he wasn't ready.
So there's like a minute of dead air.
And then all of a sudden, you hear Tom Roberts come on.
He doesn't think he's on the air.
We've got an important hernia center spot standing by here and you're patching around.
And Tom Roberts comes on.
He doesn't think he's on the air.
He thinks he's talking to the program director or whatever.
And he goes, let's forget about...
Oh, I heard that.
Yeah, I heard it.
That's when I was listening.
Surely after the ripping of ACN and Mark Mosley.
How was quite interesting.
Well, you know that.
Well, you're a no-talent too, okay?
How do you like that?
I know, I do those...
All those stupid song parodies.
You don't even sound like Elvis.
You suck.
Yeah, I do.
Take a few lessons from Eric Lambert, okay?
The attack of the stand-up comment.
You can grow some hair and be a chronic pain in the ass too.
And so that's going to be a movie, the attack of the stand-up comment.
Good day.
Take care.
22-till-a-one at WIOD.
610-cub-d-i-on-d.
Oh, no.
Now, not another one of these.
Oh, scary tales can come true.
It can happen to you.
If you're carry-haw.
Well, that's Wica, that's bad.
While the white dwarf is away.
In the townhouse you play.
If you're carry-haw.
I'd rather sing a little bit for you today like that old black magic.
A big price you'll pay.
It with a weapon you play.
Not once, it was twice.
You were caught with misrides.
Has me in a spin.
You're really not too smart.
If you can't stay apart.
Now you won't be president.
Carry heart.
You won't be the president.
No.
Carry heart.
Ah, guys, every day.
I didn't even have to tune in.
I heard the show yesterday.
Same old douching in the same old talking.
Come on, give us a breath.
Same old song parodies.
1243 at W.I.D.
Here's the collar in Hollywood with these joys funny.
Boy, it's amazing that Bill got to a pay phone so fast.
How you doing, Bill?
Oh, Bill's even changing his voice now.
First time I ever heard Joey Reynolds with yesterday.
Well, that's funny because he's not on.
He's not on yesterday.
Okay.
I listen to you all the time.
So I get to hear you all the time.
Can I ask you what kind of phone this is?
Well, it's a Southern bad phone.
It's a Southern Baptist phone.
Southern bad phone.
Boy, this phone don't have a prayer.
I'll tell you that.
Listen to the quality.
Woo!
Sounds like you've got 14 Nylons over the phone.
Can you hear me?
Well, I can hear you, but it's real muffled.
Okay.
I'll try to speak louder.
Boy.
Anyway, so I finally heard him say it at all.
I had his voice and I thought it was funny.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know what's going with him.
He's, I don't either.
I've been trying to figure it out for 30 years since he was a kid.
I'm not that bad.
And I wanted it.
You know that bit you just said about the old lady that, uh, you know, I have the same old thing.
Yeah.
She sounds just like Ruth Gordon.
It is Ruth Gordon.
Is it?
Yeah.
Uh.
No, it's Jack Gordon.
Well, he sounds just like...
Well, he's right.
What are you doing?
No, no.
It's nice and cold in here.
Melvin, don't turn it up.
Then you'll get, once his name out here, he'll turn it down to 50.
I like it nice and freezing.
I want to get pneumonia so I can take a couple weeks off.
Right?
Hello?
Hello?
This is the first time I ever called you.
Well, it's okay.
You'll notice that when you call it, it's like four different conversations.
Okay.
I also think Ruth and Fred do it for me.
Yeah.
Well, look, at least you're consistent.
And I think Eric Bennett is kind of, he talks about the same thing all the time.
He talks about what?
Oh.
Everything.
Well, that's because he can't remember what it's like he's trying to keep the memory alive.
Okay.
Okay.
Have a nice one.
Get a new phone.
Okay, that is the worst phone I've ever heard in my life.
Yeah, let's try it.
It's 12.45, those phones are not coming on too well.
It's 12.45 a.1 a.m.
We got all the cheekbones you have in one ear.
Tone it down a little, Ron.
Let's speak about some old guy now.
Overmodulating, Ron.
Oh.
Everybody's got this.
We're going, we're going.
We're making, we're going.
We're going, we're going.
Okay, good job, Ron.
It's 12.45 at WIOD and let's go to Miami.
Hello.
Neil.
Look at this here, Aldi.
Rochester, Amher, coaches in their records starting with Joe Crozier and Rudy Migue.
And Steve Kraftcheck.
And they even have the roster for Rochester and Buffalo and the American Hockey League.
Isn't that exciting, sir?
Neil.
There's Geet Trotje.
Hello.
And Ron Ingram.
Yes, sir.
Go ahead.
How you doing, Neil?
Okay.
Okay.
Neil, first to get something out of the way here.
Johnny Bohatch, Jose and Julie are all bunch of douchebags.
Okay.
Number two.
There's Ron Outwell.
Yeah.
Dennis Hextal.
Number two.
Ronco Horvath.
Uh, spy reporter from Gilbert.
You don't know where I saw him.
I'm afraid to ask.
I have a softball game.
Uh-huh.
He plays softball one of the guys here at work.
Great.
Well, he seems to play ball with all the guys.
Yeah.
If he catch my drift, sir.
But he doesn't get into the game too much.
Mm-hmm.
Nope.
I think he plays the field.
And I saw his mom in the game.
Uh-huh.
She showed up with a fur coat.
Great.
With 80-degree weather.
Well, that's what you get.
Yep.
Anyways.
Is that it?
That's it, Neil.
Oh, I bring back Bill Marshall.
Yeah.
Have a great day, sir.
Okay.
Oh, what a call.
1247 at WIOD.
Let's go to...
Hi, Alia.
I got one.
I can't help it.
Yeah, good.
Go back to sleep.
Let's go to Boca.
Hello.
Boca.
Go on.
No obling lace?
Adios.
Miami.
Oh.
Yeah.
Yes.
Hello.
That must be from Homestead.
Can you believe that?
Here's a lady in plantation.
Neil.
Who wonders what this is all about?
You got that right.
Friend Healy and Ralph Kiner.
Oh, God.
Friend Healy.
Friend Healy giving new meaning to the word illiterate.
I just can't believe that man.
He is...
He makes Kiner...
You beg.
You pray for Kiner to come back on the game.
And that's saying a lot.
That's right.
Oh, friend Healy, I'd forgotten all about him.
That's why I'm dover.
Oh.
Yeah, how could you forget about him, guy?
Well, of course, Le Grand Orange.
Don't forget about Rusty Stab,
who's busy cooking gourmet cuisine in the kitchen right now.
Oysters Rusty.
And I wonder who's in the kitchen with Rusty,
but that's another story.
What a rope.
We'll ask Steve Thone.
He'll probably tell us.
Thanks, O.
I know so.
Really?
Believe me.
How much is that, that?
No, ma'am.
Steve Thone is Jewish.
Did you know that?
Among other things?
Yeah, I did not.
He's great.
He's okay in my book.
He keeps Harry on these straight and narrow paths.
Or at least part of that.
Harry's a great guy.
He is.
So anyway, in closing.
Anyway, one thing before I go.
If Alex Minnett is in Manage's Word,
and he's leaving, he says he is.
He's not going anywhere.
They'll call her in my radio.
Two to three.
He's not going anywhere.
Don't you understand?
He's just putting on that sympathy act.
Like you're picking on me and cutting it out.
And if you don't stop, I'm going to leave.
I'm okay.
Like a little petulant child.
You know, he's not going anywhere.
Really?
No.
Well, anyway, in closing to that.
Lovely way.
If he ever left us, how would we know what good taste was?
We wouldn't know how to dress or what to eat,
or what to listen to, or what to watch,
or what movies to go to.
He's terminal meal.
I tried.
I gave him a shot.
Well, we're going to drive him down to the bus terminals,
as a matter of fact, a little later on,
and see if he gets the hint.
Now, he's okay.
He's just a pain in the end.
He's not sad at all.
But he's so during the weakest.
Well, that's because he's got those 9 or 10 dunderheads in here,
and he does the whole show for them.
Have you ever noticed?
What was the show I was watching the other day?
Oh, it's that amazing discoveries.
Have you seen that?
Oh, with the setting, the car on fire,
and their washing, their hands, and their body parts,
and selling these products,
and they have that phony, live studio audience.
Then they give you the offer.
No more, more, we want more.
This is the new thing in America now.
Everybody will act like a hyena.
It really started on a more downy junior show,
when he had all these animals in there from the Bronx going,
and he was like, oh, oh, oh.
That's all loaded in the producer, I think.
Like, what is it?
The all loaded in the producer.
Yeah.
Or they pay, I think they pay him off is what it is.
They have to.
Absolutely.
And that's what we have basically in here,
no matter what's going on,
it's like, wow!
You know, I just, I don't know.
He's live studio audiences, man.
They're all on doggy uppers or something.
Just a few years ago, it was funny.
It's not funny anymore.
Have a nice day.
Wait, Neil, Neil, I think you're like saying closing.

and they laugh like it was like the last thing
well it's one thing I wouldn't be called dead having somebody sitting in cackling
in the background of my show
that for sure not even you're right
yeah by the way Chuck Myers on the weekend
he is great I like he's a great he's a good talent man
how he ever wound up at this radio station is one of the great mysteries of all time
he was a great newsman he's got a gift to gab
he knows a lot about sports and about news and about anything
he can talk he can speak
he's showing Saturdays I enjoy it
doesn't take any crap from anybody
he does play a lot of my cards though I noticed that but that's okay
by the way I have a Joel Jr. the guy who always calls and imposter's me
my part wait a minute imposter's you
yeah well he's the imposter always calls and say that's Joel
yeah he's right here right by me one part of him
no no no no no we don't want to talk to him
tell him we don't talk to phony's we only talk to the real we only talk to the real
thing oh shut up you're not for honey you see what I mean
yeah hopeless all right you better take care of him right away
I want to take care of him right now good luck to you
115 at W.I.O.D. we have an opening in date where Joel just hung up
Joel's taking grammar lessons from Luther's skywalker I think
Luke what is his name Luke skywalker I doesn't really make any difference
what do you call him that's still the same end result and if Michael
Putney is listening or anybody who knows Mike I want to say it again
because it really merits extra consideration that show yesterday morning
on channel 10 at 11 o'clock the worst the pits tragic
embarrassing okay but other than that it wasn't too bad
look at that phone we're down to four stinkin calls now boy don't ever
let that Bill Marshall in the studio again it's having a residual
effect that's probably going to filter on all the way through stand show
tonight it's a good excuse stand
there must be a better way and they're always asking us to pay
don't raise the rates because if you do I've got a pitful your lady will too
you always keep me waiting Mr. Postman oh so confident
wait I'll send my hand okay well later but when he got that she was already
dead please Mr. Postman oh yeah I got a body between his boys

in gentlemen a guy who's desperate for exposure who just can't measure up to
Eric Lambert I like Eric Lambert a lot I think he's very funny
and got a lot of hair yeah this is kind of embarrassing because when I went
mark mostly ladies in gentlemen from power 96 let's hear it from our studio
audience weren't you weren't you hearing that just a couple of weeks ago when he
was tinkling all over you when you were in the studio no no he was he was kind of
tinkling on madty oh who was it was with us but he has a habit of doing that
I the thing about it was I think what I said was taken completely out of context
it's kind of it's well he hates you like poison now kind of embarrassing because I
really like Eric Lambert I think he's really funny are you sucking around now
more I'm well if I was going to suck up to anybody it wouldn't be Alex because
leaving but I would be sucking up to you but I from day one I thought Alex was
just really tremendous I think no I really do no I really believe that I said to
myself I heard him the first day was on this guy is going to bring a lot to
Miami yeah he did and here in a box and he keeps trying to paste it on every
day and that's why he's got that glossy head now listen we have a celebrity
collar on one that Marvin wait between you and me this is not the air right
wait no it's just a dry run mark I think the guy is really good I'll
explain it yeah then taxi where have you got your finger while you're saying these
things I think the studio audience thing it's it's dynamite prize nobody else has
ever done is a mark it's a list and all right stop before you have to go to the
hernia center just hold on one second we have a very important celebrity online
one okay hello hi Neil this is Eric Lambert how are you man great good to know I
just say hi to a big admirer of yours Eric I heard market I'm Eric Eric how
you doing hi Mark are you nice to hear from you man good I think you're really

I really do I listen to your show a lot I really think it's very funny I like it no
you were just we're you know just going back and forth if you would like ever to
come come over and do some time I'd love to see you do some time for my
I've heard most of the people at power 96 have done some time yes we have now
you you you are a stand-up comedian also you perform stand-up comedy right yeah I
haven't done it and and quite a while because when you do the morning show it's
hard to get out to the clubs and the well you'd be great on the Alex
Benichoke because he hasn't done it quite a while either by the way speaking of
comedy I have here for you man the top 10 reasons the Joey Reynolds show sucks
we have if you want to kneel if you want him hey listen I got nothing but I think
I'm gonna have no doubt no don't do it don't do it no we have don't leave me
along with this man we have number 10 sucking long Reynolds family tradition
number nine Joey Lister's have habit of not wearing dentures when calling in
number eight constant cletching about soaring prices of laxatives in
Canada number seven nine out of ten doctors prefer Joey Reynolds show to
Nike will number six constant sound of cold source scraping against
microphone number five only radio personality and history to be upstage by
Gilbert number four ratings too low to be measured with whole numbers number
three lengthy discussions of sex with Yenthas number two continually daydreams
out loud I could have been heraldo and the number one reason of the Joey Reynolds
show sucking is slam some of sexuality because of deep guilt over secretly
wearing bra and panties on the air miss one with young lucky and there they are
yeah there they are for your perusal and amusement ladies and gentlemen let's
hear it from our live studio audience
man oh yeah oh and Ali grab some lay down comedians in here okay the ones
who just laid on in the corner go to sleep one thing one thing about Alex
the show is he'll have a he'll have a guy on that he'll say that is really funny
yeah and then for whatever reason whether Alex has got like too many people in
the studio or whatever too many guests at one time you'll never hear the guy say
one thing yeah until at the end when he's getting ready to leave Alex will say well
thanks for coming you were you're really funny guy but you never had that you
know it was never proven to you because you never get to hear you know stand up
comedy our radio is kind of like doing bowling on radio you know that they're
just misses something in a translate very few guys that can do that that there's
very few stand up comics that translate well on radio in fact maybe we can have
Rick weaver come in and do a play by play on the stand up comedians because he's
done bowling on radio oh look at that a solid ten pin well listen to tell tell
Alex and Eric they can say whatever they want about me just tell them to
remember to say the call letters power 96 WP OW many times okay yeah tune in

but I've been holding for long time to come from Miami on the Palm Beach line
and on your dime yeah oh yeah go ahead oh wait a minute you don't mind do you
you mind yeah okay he says he doesn't mind but kind of grudging me I think he's
a little p.o. I'll make it short and sweet okay when you're talking to the
about the garbage in your yard I got a great idea you got to do from now on when
you move to new area like that you got to interview everybody in a neighborhood
make sure that's where you want to live yeah I mean that's the bottom line you
got to interview you know what they're like and what they don't like what you
realize that you'd be living in a pup tent if you did that in this town you
never move anywhere because they all hate each other well I mean I'm not kidding
man my neighbors they all and not just little stories I mean venomous stories
like I don't want to see your ugly face I'm gonna build a fence they hate each
other like poison well that's true most stuff Florida but anyway a friend
years might even help you out a guy that you haven't talked to in a while and who
is that he called me yeah good luck to you have okay well I'm sorry you had
a wait for that that was depressing well I don't depress enough up here in
deer field I would believe it oh these guys are putting me to sleep hmm who's
that Eric and the mark mark and Eric they're going on the road they're taking it
on the road together well they should go on the road as long as they take
Alex with him just a joke Alex your old can our book you just a pain in the ass
exactly just a a grouchy grumpy old man that's all that's basically the
bottom line is a grumpy old guy well what can you do it doesn't have a sense of
humor he takes everything personally and he starts attacking and leash it
lashing and leashing out that's because he just got attacking ACN satire and
song parodies and then all those other interpretable marks he made that I
won't even repeat yeah yeah well I just want to call Mitchell and George
couple of douche bags okay sir okay thank you glad we got to your important
call 28 after one at W.I.O.D. we have an open line in Broward County 524 9463
524 douche Davey Davey yeah Johnny Pallet has he been in that studio I thought

wasn't a studio but Tom Dennyberg stepped on him is he the same fella that
does the ship of foods the yeah he was in the ship of food ship of fools what
the hell is that a little harmonica player he's about a hundred years old if

it was like the whole point of her coming here was to turn on this show I don't

better things to do than listen to the radio and call in talk shows and
critique there and that includes the people who call in who who just think all

are you doing listening to the radio and calling talk shows what kind of a

Benini was so mad how come they want fighting together on the phone them too I don't
know I have no idea I know they're not mad it's just Alex's thin skin and all
you got to do is criticize any of his little core see the problem is if you go
by that theory you could never criticize anybody because everybody is Alex's
best friend and he just had lunch with him a couple of weeks ago and he's
reciting something and don't what isn't mostly didn't even say anything bad no
no all he did was make a little poke a little fun at the Lambert and right away

contrive controversy yeah what i like to don't realize this most entertaining part of his show is
just listen to him get up a lot like when someone tells him he sucks i mean it's that's about it
that's his show well that's something yeah it's on better nothing i know i'm not look i'm not
trying to say he sucks okay all i'm trying to say is that why does he come off with this and i
you know i got these two faxes i don't pretend to be an authority on anything there's some things
i know a little bit about little about sports a little bit about this i don't claim to be the
beginning and all on anything but this man whether it's music whether it's movies whether it's
food whether it's comedy it's like hey this is the definitive answer and that's it i mean this is
uh where it's at this is the cutting edge and this is what's hip and this is what's uh i just i
just i just drives me nuts that's what's a crop all right now i'll see let me let me just tell you

it has been up until today but after the a's i went nuts with the a cn thing i mean that's i mean
he's entitled to an opinion but god almighty the station pays thousands of dollars a year for it
