You're not necessarily those of the station.
Now, here's Neil Rogers, a new sought radio 610 WIOD.
I'm a Cub fan and a Bud fan and I trust you are too.
This is the NBC Radio Network. I'm Mike Anthony.
Sometimes I feel that life is passing me by.
Sometimes I feel that people don't want to smile.
But when I listen to your show, you make me smile like a shy.
And you can tell me that by my friend, Mick O'Leary on my radio.
Mick O'Leary on my radio.
But yeah, Henry's still, well, Henry's already my baby.
Okay, Bill Cobbers here, we're gonna have to do the show.
We've only got two hours today. We've got a lot of spots to get in.
Which of course is the main reason we're here.
Nice little hot job on the end of that record, of course.
And we got 48 versions of that.
So he had a little tired just letting me know I'll pop one in there.
And I brought you a new one today too.
Which we're gonna, oh yeah.
Well, you don't have to play it, man.
We're not all of it.
There's a little gift.
There's a little good memory.
You wear geeks bearing gifts.
That's what I've always said.
Exactly.
Well, sometimes I feel this is the boss.
Like life is passing me by.
Yeah, it sounds like Disney.
Anyway, Bill Cobbers here, he's got some great stories to tell.
He's gonna rip QAM a new ass.
Aren't you?
Listen, right?
He's gonna show you people who think you just Mr. Mello,
that underneath Vanir is Carson Renny used to say.
There's a vicious, nasty, back-fighting, wonderful guy.
And also Bill Cosper, I guess, while the luck again,
is Nick showing up today or what?
Because Nick's gonna have to call Cosper and tell him no way Jose.
Sorry.
We just have the toughest time connected with that Van Cosper, you know what?
It's fate.
Are you gonna introduce me or to what?
Well, I mean to call it.
You're a little like a Hanukkah boy station.
If you are.
First of all, you're people don't know who I am.
The first call is gonna be, hello.
Bill, I'll be this stupid.
What? Trust me.
Hello?
W-I-O-D.
Hello.
Yes.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
It's the heart, lady.
It is?
Don't harp on it.
Everyone, it's a day.
Is that it?
That's it.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
She's so emotional she didn't want to talk to you.
W-I-O-D.
Yes.
How about...
Hold on, sir.
W-I-O-D.
The Bill Culver Show.
I'll bill you so well.
Hold on, ma'am.
See, I told you that was Randy Martin throwing the Royce.
That was it, Randy Martin.
Mike Melody.
Mike Knight.
So anyway, Jay Michael starts over there pretty soon, I guess.
W-I-O-D.
Okay.
Blind checker.
Fowler.
Good.
That's your buddy, Lee Fowler.
And I'd like to say a little few people this morning, Thomas.
You've got a minute.
I have a minute?
That's more than anybody ever gets on the show.
That's true.
No.
I'm not only ruptured.
I want to say a little to all my doctors.
But I'm not going to give their last name.
Okay?
Yeah.
I want to say hello to Frederick and all of the people.
I want to say hello to Mike.
I want to say hello to...
Yeah, I don't know.
This isn't Wheel of Fortune, you know.
This is...
Well, I just want to say...
And of course, my dear friend, Sandy, my physical therapist, who's helping me dance again.
And he leads at this point in time, Andy Payton.
And you know, I just want to say a little...
They mean about her as their big Sandy Payton fans in this building.
How used to work here with her?
I love that bitch.
Anyway, introduce me.
I'm not going to introduce you to all of the directors in the band.
I'm Andy Balejian.
Andy Balejian.
We've only got two hours.
We've got the Keynes game in noon.
They're playing the Citadel.
And then if Miami wins, which we know they will, at four o'clock, they'll have a second game.
This could be my life show.
WIOJs are praying that the Keynes win today, that they suddenly became big ball game baseball fans.
This could be my life show.
WIOJs.
Mine is...
I just said that before.
As little note, my bot says, be sure in...
And also food, I made sure the food comes at 11.
Oh great.
From American Stake and Pizza.
So whatever you want, and Melvin, and just to help yourself, and we don't want to force it on you.
Okay.
And also, if Mommy's listening, and I see...
We leave it noon.
I'm taking you home and dropping you like in a sidewalk.
And then I was going to go right to Mommy's for an early lunch, but I forgot my pill.
Okay.
And when you're old and alien like we are, if you don't have a pill man, you can't even move.
You have no movement.
That's my problem recently.
No movement.
So I'm going to exactly...
So I'm going to have to go home, all the way home, up to plantation and back to Mommy's around.
I don't know.
I'll get there what I feel like at Mom.
West Palm Beach.
Hey, how you doing?
I'm the bill caller show.
I'm WIOJs.
Don't say that.
You antagonize your audience.
Yes sir.
I'm antagonized.
You know who this is sir?
This could be your Roger.
No, I mean who is sitting in the seat.
I have no idea who Bill Caller is.
Exactly.
I thought they named the racetrack after him.
Yes you do.
No, I really don't.
Don't you?
No.
I'll get lost.
No, I don't want to talk to people.
Don't over you.
Are we voting?
Yes, we can't.
There's only four or five people listening to your show.
We're esteemed from Hollywood, WIOJs.
Marvin?
Yes.
Bobby.
Bobby.
Yes.
Oh, it's the Guava Goose Bay.
What do you...
He can tie...
Yes, I can tie.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hold on.
But you know who Bill Caller is?
I can't help Bill Caller.
You sound like one is listening.
Hold on Bobby.
WIOJs.
I'll keep it up.
Keep it up.
I'll let you say hello to Bill Caller.
Sure.
Hold on please.
Okay.
You bet.
Okay, they're all ready for your bill.
You go right down the line, don't you?
I don't want you to run.
What do you mean I'm running out of four calls?
Seven.
This is in a big time like QAM or Q410 line.
And literally speaking of QAM, I have a good idea that my...
QAM...
Knight.
WIOJs.
Oh yeah, like the whole football.
Motor please.
Sure, hold on.
Who might night?
No, I have a...
I have a feeling...
He hates me, by the way.
I have a feeling that Bob McKay is taping this.
Oh.
Orders from higher up to make sure that if I say anything, you know, that they consume me
for over there, that they have it on tape.
That's what the Bill Vines thought, too.
Oh, he don't want to bring that up.
Anyway, it's 12 minutes.
I hate to interrupt you, but we've got to do the melting pot.
We don't have a lot of time today.
And if we don't work out great, this is going to go by so fast you ought to come back
and do it again.
You and I have been paid at the melting pot.
How about Saturday, 10 to 2?
How about that?
Huh?
Everybody in the building says, hey, good idea.
You know, good.
No good.
Slime ball.
I go to the track, so you don't.
Anyway, we have eaten at the melting pot as a matter of fact.
And now they've got something new.
They've got the great cheese fondues.
Okay, let's take some of these calls.
If we don't have a lot of time, we can't...
But before we take the first call, you must tell.
Now, people call, well, when's Bill coming back on here?
Is he going to be on another station?
And I mentioned a couple weeks ago that he was talking to another station in the market.
I say station very loosely.
And it didn't pan out because they wanted to pay any money.
And the station of course was WFTL, which might as well be off the air, basically.
And...
Well, they were the first person to call me.
But they had...
They were the only person to call me.
You've got to envision big time radio in the owner, King Paul, who of course is the maven of used cars and all that crap.
And they invite they'll call it a breakfast.
They have all a hot shows.
They've got the owner of the station and the program director and the operations manager and the janitor and all these people at breakfast at Denny's.
And I was...
My appetite is great.
Okay, I think you're making this up.
It's a no-no-serious.
And my appetite is great, right?
And the only thing I could say is there was a time not too long ago when I wasn't eating very much.
And now I'm eating like I'm just like a horse.
Anyway, to make a long story short, because I know you have a lot of calls.
We meet at Denny's and everybody's there.
The manager, the program director, a girl who's like the operations manager and King Paul is there.
And I told my wife, no cereal this morning, nothing.
I'm going to pick out.
We're going to get a free breakfast.
Well, we go to Denny's.
I meet the all-comman.
Here comes King Paul looking great with his dayglow leisure suit on and everything.
And I'm going to eat, right?
So they start with King Paul and they say, the waitress said, we like to order.
He says, um...
What can it toast, dear?
She's well we have rye, we have a little toast.
You go to the general manager.
That's a good one.
I'm some toast.
I pick a little toast and maybe a couple slice of bacon, but toast.
We go around the table, everybody has shows.
I'm starving.
And I ordered nothing.
You have no backbone.
Oh, God's incredible.
You know, you get the feeling that like King Paul had a $5 bill in his pocket.
There were like six people sitting at the table.
Oh, that was fun.
You wanted to make sure that it came like four.
And I was hungry.
I mean, I was...
I was like...
What did he give me an idea of what the offer was going to be?
Coconut grove.
Oh, hi.
Good morning.
Yes, sir.
I hope you have the widespread TV in the studio.
We have MTV on.
We will not turn on C-spec.
I tried to get him to turn it on, sorry.
What did you do?
I was going to have a three TV here and he still won't fit.
Exactly.
We have just a little Sony in here and there's no way she's going to...
Maybe her pupicle beat on airs about it.
I couldn't handle it at this time.
Why is it on her face, Maggie?
Exactly.
Okay, guys, have fun.
Okay, W-Y-O-D.
I want to talk to Bill, please.
The bill called her show.
I want to talk to Bill.
Okay, hold on.
You know what that is.
Mr. Depression.
W-Y-O-D.
Yeah, I want to speak to Neil.
Neil?
Yeah, Neil Rogers.
Oh, sure.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello?
Sir?
Hello.
Yeah.
This is Bill.
Bill Cola?
Yeah.
Hey, Bill.
Montana here.
Montana, how you doing, kid?
Right.
Why is he a voice again, Bill?
Well, it's good for me to hear it, too.
I haven't spoken in three months.
Well, I hope we get you on another station very, very soon.
Well, I'm running out of stations here as Joe...
It's Abernathy.
Joe Abernathy once said,
I'm Mike Ampeningham.
Ha, ha, ha.
Now, listen.
It's good to talk to you.
Okay, Bill.
Okay, take care.
Okay, Bill.
I'm on an off-fast on the show.
We don't want you around.
W-Y-O-D.
Hello.
Tom Beach.
Here with it.
Get lost.
Miami.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hello.
How are you?
Great.
How you doing?
Good to hear you again.
Thanks a lot.
Listen, Neil, I make it short and sweet.
This is Tom from Miami.
I'm the one to give you your cup tape up at the bizarre.
Yes, Tom.
Neil, I'm not messing with you tomorrow morning.
I am on my flight.
I am going to Chicago-based ball haven.
That's a bad news for Tom.
Bad news for Tom.
Mike Harkies on the 15-day disabled list.
The 30-nighters in New York, they took him on the fifth inning
and they brought up Kevin Blankenship from the minor leagues
who will start tonight against the Giants
so don't get your hopes up.
I'll be there tomorrow, Neil.
I'll be there for Tomara's game at two o'clock.
We don't even have a pitcher for Tomara's game.
Well, don't be there, at least.
Don't want to still be thrown out of that game.
And by the way, the ball was spared by five feet yesterday.
I want to go into a big thing about that.
The Cubs telecast cut it beautifully.
They showed it over and over again.
They put a circle around the ball as it left the park.
Right.
Fair by five feet.
Harry Wendell said is the biggest piece of crap
whoever stepped out of a baseball diamond, okay?
Well, you take a long time with baseball calls.
You know why?
It might not be as bad as everyone said.
Right.
Neil, listen to me, please.
But you know something, the highlight.
If anybody saw that game because it wasn't he has been,
the highlight is when Zimmer goes nuts.
That's what's the price of admission.
He is the best.
Eyes go popping out of his head.
He's the best.
Neil.
And you could read the lips too.
And he's wearing his hair shorts.
Yeah, I like that.
He got that Bob Cox here to.
Yes.
Neil, listen, I'll be there for the Cubs and Sanford.
He only said that to me.
Already said it.
I have my video camera in hand that a friend of mine has.
He knows which is he really is.
I'm not coming in these old ladies for you about calls.
Sir, what's the bottom line in your calls?
Carson Renny was right.
The first line is that I'm a Chicago baseball knight.
And I'm going there.
I live here in Miami.
We don't get to see professional baseball in person.
Are you kidding?
You haven't been over to Danny Maduro Stadium?
No, no, no, Bill.
I don't go over there.
You know, twenty-thirty years ago when I was born here,
yeah, we used to go over and watch you.
Okay, sir.
Have a wonderful trip.
Neil, I will.
I'm going to get here.
I don't say it all over again.
Say you're going to take your camera to Chicago.
I do.
See you, Frank.
Okay, get a while.
Okay, twenty-one past ten at WIOD.
The Cains in the Citadel, sunny in Joe,
from a mark-light stadium in noon today,
and then hopefully, man, we all got our fingers and legs crossed
if they win the first game, then they get into the championship game at four.
And of course, we'll have that here on your sports obsessive station, WIOD.
You know what Zagaki?
You know him at all?
I know Joe very well.
As a matter of fact, can I tell you a quick story about Joe five seconds?
That's about all he can do on him.
No, seriously.
When I left here, when we all got bounced out for the jet copter,
you don't remember that.
Yes, I did.
Anyway, we all got bounced out for the jet copter,
and Joe is a lot better.
I got to tell you this, but publicly,
Joseph Gack on the WIOD.
Hello.
Hold on.
Okay, go ahead.
I got to get, listen, he and me.
Hey, this is Boni.
Are you crazy?
Joseph Gackie is one of the few people who called me up and said,
I'm sorry, what happened with that classic exchange of luck.
Anyway, 22 after 10 at WIOD,
Char Hut is doing it, boy.
If you're living cram going every my own sweet time.
All right, hey, listen to me.
I was just trying to help you out there, guy.
I know.
So this night to your bill, where he has come out of?
A shell.
Sounds like he's been up for a while.
Do you have any idea who he is?
Sure, he's the guy that named the racetrack after him.
Exactly.
Okay, let's go to Fort Lauderdale.
Oh, man.
Oh, hold on.
Okay.
Oh, gee, do we have to put him on so soon?
I'll let him wait there on three.
Bobby.
Oh, Bill.
How are you?
I'm like the last one.
I have missed you and missed you.
I was in Texas.
My husband called me and said,
Bill, callers going to be on and I came home a day early.
I brought more pecan,
so when you're in good health and ready for pecan pies,
with the little flags, they'll be ready for you.
In the meantime, I'll take more of everyone,
more of those minutes to pecan pie later.
Yeah.
And you're truly missed, honey.
You really are.
And we're so prayed so hard and we're so good.
And Neil, that you're both feeding better.
You're both, and I'm on the Neil Maus since you're going.
You're on the Neil?
Yeah.
We heard, yeah.
Yeah.
And say hello to your mom.
I've always ever, too, is just to see you.
Got on your ground.
Who builds mom?
She's not feeling too well today,
but I'll say hi to her anyway.
Okay, do you have one you good brown shoes?
Who?
You.
Neil.
Yeah.
Okay, because mom likes you to wear the good brown shoes.
They were black when I came into building,
but coming through the hall here,
they give brown real fancy.
Okay, real good.
Okay, Bobby.
I've got plenty of pecan pies when you get back.
Okay, see you, Bobby.
Okay, see you, Bobby.
Bye.
Nice talking to you, Bobby.
Bye.
Do I feel, do I feel, do I feel, day, day, day,
day, day?
So tall that we're so tall,
although not we're so tall.
Soимся no te說, you know.
Nejah.
So pouvoir, olfas, du выпол,
dou kalo, dano ai jen denon yn Christmasy!
You know, none of those yeas销未,
RJgeda, resolving.
You know,
New happy graduation!
Somebody's got to keep this alive.
Oh, you know,
never do I OD.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
I'd like to say hello to the CEO.
Okay, you're on right now, sir.
Oh, my goodness, right through.
My no bill.
Hi, ho.
Welcome back, guy.
Hey, thanks a lot.
I know who this is.
Bill, I, I understand QAM.
Did Walt Disney buy QAM?
Did one?
Walt Disney buy QAM?
Walt Disney?
I heard it was a real Mickey Mouse operation.
Now listen, I'm not going to trash QAM.
I put the corn flakes on the table for me until I couldn't get into the studio.
I'll thank him for that.
Yeah, I'll give you that nice, certified letter that said,
we're sorry, you're not feeling well and don't ever come back.
I'll never forget that meeting when I said, I can't do it.
I can't do it.
And one of them said,
if you got a two, could you do it?
It is.
It's true.
We haven't talked.
Yeah, I'm on the good.
All hard.
I said, I can't do it.
I couldn't do it for $100,000 a year a minute.
And maybe for a half hour.
What have you got a two?
And that tells a lot about this business.
Oh, yeah.
What's this like here?
I mean, there are a lot of people in this building still think that I had a hang nail.
They don't understand.
I had a stroke.
They think, oh, it's five, six weeks ago, and we'll run him over here and run him around like a maniac.
They don't understand, boy, these things take time.
They're nuts.
Yeah, that's true.
It's true.
You know, let's get all the people to bring the food in again.
They're out of their minds.
Over there.
And nuts.
What kind of food coming?
I'd like some toast.
Not a lot of it.
King Paul is going to be bringing it in personal.
I called you in Neil.
Just a you in Neil.
Just a toast to you.
Hey, it's great to hear your voice.
Who really is?
Well, good guy.
He's a piano player in a cat house up in Bocawreitz.
You got that right.
No, he's a piano player.
He's a real good guy.
And he's nice to call.
I appreciate it.
Welcome back.
Thanks for the lunch.
How do I sound?
Great.
Honest.
Listen, you've been on a roller coaster thing and you know, you sound terrific.
Okay.
Okay.
Good job.
Thank you.
Roller coaster.
Okay, we have an open line in Broward, one in Bocaw.
I just mentioned that.
We haven't given any numbers out yet.
And we probably shouldn't have to.
Is this a mobile again?
Can I speak to Mike?
Mike?
Isn't that Mike Miller?
Mike Miller is here.
Yes, sir.
What kind of soda are you drinking?
Oh, it's just diet.
Diet cherry?
It's just the radio show.
That's correct.
Bill, how you feel?
It's not.
You feel a real good, just wonderful.
That's fantastic to hear.
So, when you take an overstand slot at night, did I say that?
Sorry.
Boy, that was your audience's vicious.
Hey, just ask Alex Bennett what Neil's audience can do.
Did I say that?
Sorry.
Yes, you sure did.
I don't want to get that.
That's what brain me for it all again, right?
Just like when Joey gets cancer, I mean, trust me.
Can you play a medley of the bill calls or hits at some time today?
I think I can make for the whole audience.
I say we want to hear it.
Well, that's the same deal.
Don't play a role on the phone, those are calling phones.
Wait, but this is for you, though, sir.
Don't take it first, I want to.
I don't think I feel myself.
1031 at W.I.A.
Jose and we'll see another time like Don't Call Us, we'll call you.
It just never works out.
I think fate has a lot to do with that.
You know, that's over at the hero where they still think the hurricane's lost that game two nights ago.
But nobody told them.
We got the kids coming up at noon, and I want to remind you of that.
But in the meantime, we want a lot of people to go over there because the cash is corded by fast.
Last time we came in a summer shining, blue skies looks like the weatherman's going to cooperate.
Soap or was smiling, or is that something unusual?
So we're going to be in a big crowd over there at Mark Height Stadium.
Can I interrupt you for a second?
I'm even bigger crowd listening because it's on my time slot in Rick and Puss.
What is it?
Somebody asked me to please tell the story about how you and I met and how you can...
Oh, it's no good?
15 years ago.
Yeah, 15 years ago.
And you have to look the same.
If you went out in the sun for a couple hours, got a little color, you'd look exactly the same.
Honest to God, yeah.
Look at me, I looked better.
You look no, not really because when I first met you, I was skinny, I'd lost no your arms.
No, you lost it after you met me.
After I was in limbo, I was like, I wait about what I do now.
Neil Rogers had a lime green jacket.
I did not have a lime green jacket.
Bill Toulin got me a lime green jacket on the trade-out in Palm Beach.
Right, and Turing.
And he used to wear a lime green suit.
I'll never forget the day we were playing in a Pro-Am golf tournament and I was writing with Bill Toul, the general manager.
He had a great attitude, another great human being.
And we're sitting in a golf area off school of management.
We're sitting in a golf cart waiting to hit the ball and he looks over at me and hear all these celebrities and people playing golf and everything.
He says, what are we doing here?
Oh, like he was beneath him.
I'll never forget that.
Yeah, are you working selling radio equipment or business, billvines and my company, Joe Abernathy, Bill Toul?
Or when you bite the hand that feeds you, you wind up his guest on this show.
The Casper.
Poor Lauderdale.
Bill saved us from the two defeats, but load.
Okay, let's go to a celebrity caller on three.
Yeah, good morning, Uncle Neil.
How are you doing?
Gilbert.
Yeah, what's the say?
How you doing, Gilbert?
Oh, fine.
I miss you so badly.
Failure made by say by coming on the program.
Thank you very much, Gilbert.
It's good to talk to you.
Yeah, and happy luck when I was talking with you and Uncle Neil when I was in your seat like that.
Happy talk to Randy.
Yeah, it's about a fact that I had to be talking to Ernie.
Yeah, well, I mean, I had to be called Alice.
Yeah, yeah.
How about Debbie?
How about Paul Isle?
Yeah, I spoke to Paul Isle.
I'll be on the East Bend right now with Debbie.
You can be a national star, Gilbert.
Yeah, I saw him feel and I'm watching.
How did she look?
You had a big screen?
Oh, yeah, she's really great.
Yeah.
And then he has to see if he's a true character.
I like the very tip of morning radio.
Yeah, it's about a fact.
I saw Larry Kent since like, loving.
They did a lot of things.
That was great.
That was great.
I was very quiet.
He was very quiet.
He wasn't able to do it.
Oh, I saw him yesterday.
How about Larry Kent?
Larry Kent, you'll be talking to him.
No, because he doesn't want this since I was right.
He doesn't have an 800 number.
He doesn't have a 500 number.
He collects when you call me 50s.
No.
And I wish Bill you were to be on night, believe me.
How about, let me ask you, Gilbert, how would you like to be on Saturday and WIOD
from 10 to 2?
Well, I picked out when you got a character.
Don't get me into trouble.
No.
I'm not going to use your drum.
Start out slow.
Start out with a weekend thing.
What I'm going to do.
Yeah.
I'm going to get out the Meg on Sunday and you have two days there.
No, no, no.
I would never come back to work here.
But so I am.
Different regime.
You could write in your memoirs if you worked for six different regimes at WIOD.
Let me tell you something.
You said that before.
I came back to work here in Nick Fragoni with just at the, I have a cardiac arrest.
Well, you know what Dick Feral said about you.
Dick Feral.
Yeah.
Oh, no, Mark.
Yeah.
What did you do?
Yeah.
He said, you know, I really enjoy your show.
I guess there's no, no, no much coffee that anymore.
You can see how much color is for him in this market.
Who's sorry?
Well, let's say you've done a lot of fun, but I'm closing.
Oh, I'm going out.
Out west side.
I'm going out with Kevin for a month.
Yeah.

I'll see you.
And don't forget we'll be at the ballgame over next Tuesday.

Yeah.
And also actually we both on the first day of the year.
It's going to be great.
Isn't that Gilbert?
Yeah.
Sure.
I'm going to hit you on that.
I'm going to hit you on that.
I'm going to be in a suitcase and drop you out of the plane.
Okay, Gilbert.
Yeah.
Kevin and I are going to party this tomorrow.
You're having a big kiss for me.
Great talk to me, Gilbert.
Okay, bye.
Bye.
Bye.
You know, it's not too bad.
24 to 11, a WIrdee bill called us here.
We're going to be here on noon all day today.
We've got a short show.
We've got a short thing today.
And some of us are going to use to the course.
But we got the ballgame.
The Hurricanes and the Citadel.
It was Frank Galloway.
It was driving home yesterday and the name came back.
Well, it mean nothing to anybody.
Mark Baton pitched for me.
I mean, Frank Galloway for the Citadel in 78.
I think it was the first year that I was born.
And the game went 16 andnings.
Right.
And they won the Hurricanes.
They won the court.
One team scored a run.
You know what that is.
Did I get out of it?
Yeah, and another team scored a run.
That's generally the way it works.
Anyway, we're heading in this summer.
We're better time to make a resolution to lose that fat,
that excess glob that you, in fact, if you want to...
How could you do that to me?
I'm over there.
Don't we get C-span on this cable?
We do.
What number is it?
I can't get it.
I can't find it.
Okay, let's give some of these calls,
because we've got a lot of people calling.
We've got a short show today, wonder, a lot of pressure.
Bill Caulders here.
We want to make them look good, which won't be easy.
Miami Lakes.
Hi, I just want to say hi to Neil and to Bill.
Great.
It's great to hear your voice again, Bill.
And I would just let you know that I mailed you up
and to get well-carned after you left QAM.
I wonder if they ever forwarded your mail to you.
You're probably not.
You wonder if why?
If you ever got some of the mail that...
Oh, yeah, I got it all.
Oh, they...
Yeah, I got it all.
How about your cards?
Did they give those all back to you?
No, as a matter of fact, thanks.
Whoever might be listening.
If there's anybody listening,
it did send me a card or anything.
All right.
Did they concern that maybe you didn't get it?
No, no, no.
As a matter of fact, the hospital forwarded all my mail
to the Columbia School of Broadcasting.
The Columbia School.
What about QAM, though?
Yeah, she said she was going to bring your mail over to you, did she?
Did what?
We sent it to QAM.
Did we...
Yeah.
As a matter of fact, Steve Raity,
who also did not bring me my card of...
You depressed me,
was kind enough to drop by and bring me my mail.
He's a great guy and I'm...
I'm miss working with him.
He's a delightful fellow.
Okay. Well, you are sorely missed.
And I just hope that we'll hear you run a steady basis, Bernie.
Well, don't forget Saturdays, 10 to 2 on WIOD.
Right. Saturdays, 10 to 2.
Okay. Have a nice day.
Okay.
Just a little bit.
You depressed me.
Say I'm right and then you always second-guess me.
But I can't believe it.
I don't write a white friend.
Hollywood is not on the phone yet. WIOD.
Sometime.
Hold on. WIOD.
Okay. Line checker on the book.
That's Fowler. Believe me.
Trust me, sits at home with that sharp finger.
This says Hollywood.
It could be. Hello.
Hello. Hello. Hello.
Welcome back, Bill.
Thank you very much, sir.
Well, you're quite welcome, sir.
As a truth, you're going to be on 10 to 2 on Saturdays and then...
Don't start this.
And I came in here today just to find out if I could
sit up straight for two hours.
You look pretty good so far and he sounds great.
He would be good on Saturday.
If I slide ball off here, then we'd get Russ O'Ace's off here.
Let him go do some of those screaming car spots.
Get off the air.
You notice Steve, you notice how I've become a pawn once again.
And not Steve.
Yes, it is.
It is?
I'm on a good phone for a change.
I didn't recognize the voice.
You're kidding.
That's what you're nearly usually do.
I easily do.
There's one thing that Steve...
One thing Steve can do that will always identify him to you.
Uh-oh. What's that?
Stutter.
Yeah.
Well, he's still listening to that guy we had on the afternoon.
Well, I know when I played golf with Billy Kayleigh, he used to kiss you that all the time.
And then he gave you a guy to bathe in the back.
Well, you're so damn hyper, Steve.
If you just be here, I'm feeling like me and relax.
Yeah, he got me so intimidated on the golf course by saying that about my bop bop bop bop bop.
Exactly.
I never beat the guy.
I played him quite a few times and he always ends up winning.
It's too chill.
Oh, wait a minute.
Is this he's fancy?
He looks pretty good there.
Oh, that was a big mousse and elk.
Well, I don't want to take a bloody time, and then you have a short time.
I just relax a second.
We're trying to find Debbie on the C-SPAN here, and we can't find her.
What channel is it supposed to be?
Ten?
Now we took it off.
We don't want to see that crap.
Okay, just give me back my MTV on 16 in Quetz-Gruinerama.
But Melissa and Steve, it's been really something you haven't started once.
What channel is C-SPAN at your house, Steve?
I don't even know.
I'm not my start.
I'm pushing friends.
But listen, let me just say one quick thing for you.

Right up to the ball game to the first pitch.
You're right.
I got a couple of recruits in the car.
Yes.
Could you do me a favor?
What's that?
Is this a request?
No, I'm kind of.
You're not a Spartan alumni though.
I thought you could do a form.
A Spartan alumni?
Yes.
How's that?
Oh, no I got...
What do you want to hear?
I got two young kids in the car room.
What? Are you going to get in the trunk?
No, there's one driving.
Oh. What other?
But 12?
Are you leaving from Joey's house?
They're like 18.
Okay.
And I'm trying to get them to listen to you show.
Great. Well, what do you mean they don't know who I am?
Long just introducing them to them.

Okay, thanks, man.
Have a great life.
Oh my god.
See, he's first of all, he's full of crap.
He don't have anybody in the car.
These people are creative.
I'll see that they come up with more ways to try to con you
in a plane at symbol crap.
And actually they work for Dennis Collins.
So they're not fooling me.
It's a 1048 at WIOD.
There's one of the cockiest people in the history of broadcasting
and they're now with a big smirk on his face.
Five runs in the bottom of the knife and in the last
sort of is impaling himself with uncooked spaghetti right now.
I can't believe it.
Mr. Pirate in there, Chuck Meyer.
You know how Chuck Meyer did.
No, I've never met him.
He's a great fan of it, too.
A great newsman, Miss Guy, baseball fan.
Very bad city of person.
Chuck Bill Caltor, CLV ER.
He's doing King Paul the Saturday, Dead or Alive
on the Saturday morning show.
Would you like some toast for every toast?
I don't know, sir.
In fact, after the show we're all heading out to Ctobia
to toast at this game Boulevard.
Now the toast.
Toast.
Don't you remember the toast?
Oh my God.
Yeah, a shame.
Yeah, a shame.
And mother, things to buy time, as a matter of fact,
that was Larry Kent's account.
Was it really?
A monster account.
Yeah.
Anyway, would you stop it?
It's 1049.
Carson Renny was right.
You're vicious and disgusting and backed by any other party.
No, I'm not.
Even here for all these old ladies.
He's a vicious douchebag.
Anyway, let's talk about shells right now.
May we either celebrate in the long and royal day weekend,
which is still like kind of simmering over,
because it's Tuesday.
And tonight would be Lomston Night anyway.
I was going to play that burp vendors,
but we don't have time.
We'll do it after the news, okay?
Remember Pines.
Bonin, Bill.
How are you?
So nice to hear you voice again.
Thank you so much, sir.
You're talking about me or Neil?
I'm talking about you.
Wow.
You can hear me anytime.
You've ever voiced?
Probably not.
My name is Buck.
Chuck?
No.
With a beat.
Cluck.
No, with a beat.
Victor?
Buck.
Anyhow, it's so good to hear you voice again.
Thanks a lot, Buck.
I'm hoping that you'll be back.
It's a QAM listener.
Yeah.
Hey, Buck.
All the QAM people are named Buck or Cluck.
Well, whatever.
As long as, well, just watch your articulation and stuff.
But some things you can't play on the radio.
There's a lot of things you can't say on the radio, sir.
And I'd like to take about five minutes and go to over all of them.
I'd like to salute a lot of people who have been instrumental.
In my downfall in this town.
I'd like to say what I really think, but I can't, sir.
You know, like us decorum is better than my company.
Can I ask you a question, please?
Did you ever move back into your house?
Yes, sir.
I'm back in my house.
Not only they move back in, but they've really done it up right.
Well, it looks great.
Oh, OK.
And I'm jealous.
I was there this morning for the first time in a while since they fixed it back up and looks great.
Oh, really?
Yeah, we did a lot.
I would've got that tenet out of there.
I lived right down the call, right down the street from you.
Really?
We'll stop by anytime.
Have some toast.
Yeah.
He's got some leftover from that big FT.
I'd breakfast.
I ride around on my bike hoping sometimes I see you're walking your doors.
Do you walk your doors around there?
Well, I haven't been walking them lately because if they pull a little too hard, you know.
But you are feeling better now.
Yeah, I feel great.
Just great.
How do I sound, Buck?
You sound great.
You sound terrific.
OK, you were sound a little bit puny before.
Yeah.
So puny.
That was thin.
Is that a good word?
Hey, Buck.
Yeah.
See ya.
Right.

Man.
Ross is steakhouse and Mr. D.
See, players really, I mean, it's nice to be in the college world series, but nobody cares about that.
They want to go back out there and go to X-Car Band of the track and go to all those great steak houses and just a great place.
Really, even though there are a bunch of yahos out there, it's a great place.
West Palm Beach.

You never guess who called me the other day.
Beware!
Yeah, he should call today because I didn't want to talk to him.
You would talk to him for a half hour.
Beware!
Isn't that incredible?
Has that been from the old days, when we had an audience at the ANC?
A pay phone in vodka.
Mr Rodgers and Mr Caulder, how are you today?
Frank from Scotland.
Yeah Frank.
How you doing?
Great.
Good, I want to sing that song.
You want to sing it?
Yep.
Which one you depressed me?
No, sometimes I feel.
Well just a minute.
I need a cheese, I don't know which one I...
Well let's try this one.
Here we go.
I'm ready to the guy who wrote that song.
He's called us.
I'm ready.
I'm ready.
I'm ready.
It's ready.
I'm ready.

I'm ready.
Wait a minute.
Don't get ahead now.
I'm ready.
A guy.
A guy who wrote that song.

A guy who wrote that song.
Wait a minute.
In the tube, in the rainbow.
You call it, all I want is this girl.
And I'm ready.
I'm ready.
You call me, you know.
I want to ask you one thing in closing.
But where is this pay phone that you're on?
I'm uh, no, because you're coming at me.
No, no, I'm serious.
Where are you?
In a shopping mall?
No, no, but I got guys.
Why?
Why do you ask?
No, because you're just thinking.
See, everybody's laughing, but the main reason I'm laughing is I envision like standing in
the middle of the Bokit Town Center.
Well, not everything holds my nose.
Oh.
Doing this and they're laughing too.
Well, everybody here was holding their nose and they were saying, well, you're a Bokit
we can understand.
And it's the call, then.
Yes, closing.
How are you, sir?
Thank you so much.
Good, I'm glad to hear you back on the radio.
And listen, you and Neil should be sidekicks.
Oh, yeah, well, we've worked at Lawrence and ended in divorce.
Tick me on the side.
One of the other.
I already have a pain in the side.
I never worked.
I worked a little.
See you, Frank.
That's fine, you are.
Miami.
Yes, sir.
Good morning, Mr. Colman.
Yes, sir.
This is Gary.
Hi, Gary.
This is a power of day to the good debt strategy for West Platform up in North Carolina.
Oh, boy.
You're going to see?
That's one of the things that put me in the hospital.
Now, come on now.
Well, you sent me that fruit from up there.
Those good tomatoes and those peacats.
Yes, sir.
So, you've been here, you're, uh, when we're doing too well, if a lot.
That's right.
Are you getting that?
No.
No.
I was great until 10 o'clock in the morning.
Yeah, it's actually when you walked in here.
When you were in the middle of the night.
Especially when you walked in here.
Well, when they take your theme song and they plagiarize it and, uh, and then take your name
out of it.
I know.
I insert some, uh, yeah, and then this one, uh, Johnny, uh, on the, uh, he just reads, uh,
how do I feel myself?
How do I feel?
Yeah, they're up here.
It's disgusting.
I mean, I don't know.
I don't know why they love me.
I'm so excited.
I feel myself.
I mean, that leads to people, you know, that there's no radio is changed.
Is this what?
There's thousands of people talking to me and talking about the, you know, the other guy
understands us.
Uh, it's disgusting.
It is.
It is.
I don't really know where.
I don't know where the radio's going, you see.
I, I tell you where it's going.
Right before.
What is on the maze?
And it's like, I just seem to be a William.
It's a pool.
I know.
Well, with any earth is made of, with no distress.
Why am I alive with no replacement?
Sorry about that.
We're gonna save in order of toast, okay?
All right, uh, one, one thing.
The opposite.
Yes.
Implosing.
Important.
closing. I watched C-SPAN this morning with WR. Was it big? I have a 13-inch screen and I
had to turn the TV off because it wouldn't fit inside the TV. Well just kind of slice it off on the edges.
I'm going to go back. Okay. Well that's going to do it and I saw you like that. The first
hour is over already. We've got one more hour than the ball coming on. I'll take you and drop
you off on your front yard. No, no. And you're rushing up to my house and get a pill and go to
mommy's for lunch and if he's listening it'll be around probably 130. Oh, it's going to carry me
over the threshold. Yeah. I'm sure everybody in the neighborhood can take them. Maybe your wife
can take some more of those good pictures of that. The ones that have the headshot. Hopefully.
That's it. Speaking of having your headshot up, Henry Barrow is standing by with our 11 o'clock

to those who have it, it's no laughing matter. It's called frequent burping syndrome.
It's terrible. I'll be on a date or a business meeting and and excuse me. See? See what happens?
Frequent burping syndrome. It can ruin your life but it doesn't have to. Now there's a clinic that
can help. Trained specialists. Sensitive to the needs of compulsive belchers. A special place

seconds. Oh. And his friend's feed. That is. He's been soliciting both of them for so many. Anyway. Oh.
No, but anyway, he was talking about the race. Now he's forgotten about it because easy goer ran a
crappy race. Right. Right. Oh, I loved it because I hate Pat Day with the like poison on his track
to a Belmont. That's his track. Housebuster had it all away and then what was the name of the horse
that won the Longshot criminal type? Yeah, the one that just won the Lucas entry. Just one that
part of the Lucas entry. Pimlico special. Who is it, Jackie? Who wrote him yesterday? Uh, Santos.
That's correct. See you didn't see the race. Well, and Horosow came in 1880. Yes, PN.
Yes, PN with Demi Ellis and to pay 1880 and just beat Housebuster by and that can you imagine
that he was a death wreck. Third 18 dollar easy goer was a desperate third like about a length
and a half to length. Who else was in the race? Anybody else? Oh, King of Dance. Remember that
like who was in there? He ran kind of a sickly race and uh, now there was much else in there.
Hey, listen, we only got a few minutes left. Let's move along. What do you think, man? Hello.

I'll do it to go to work. Yeah, go to work. Okay. We don't want to get personally, son. I first fall.
Could you play um, behind 95 songs? Well, you know, that's like a, you know, who built call to
get well, I heard him this morning. Yeah. And he's my guest here. And if I play that, it takes like
about three and a half minutes. I'm like, I got to sit through that. Essentially a lot. I'm going to go out
and have some toast. Yeah. He'll go out to King Paul's and have toast if you do that to him.
Okay. Then you don't have to. What's your husband's name? Roger. Roger. We will say a high Roger.
And the shoe fits where it. Okay. And speed it up a little Roger. Half hour is pretty slow.
I was wondering, Roger would tell me that you were in the hospital a little while ago.
Yeah, man. That you're diabetic. I'm also diabetic. Uh-huh. Are you on insulin or the
drug? No, I'm not. I'm on the pill. Oh, you're on the pill. Oh, yeah. Okay. I'll just carry you.
But every time I get up, it drops out. Okay. How about you? Are you on insulin? I'm on insulin. Wow.
It's too many of years. Hmm. You got everything under control? Yeah, everything is going on.
You can say she's on the pill. She's on the pill. And Roger doesn't know it.
I'll have a great day, Lisa. Your husband's okay in our book. Okay. Thank you. You too.
And good luck, my father. Thank you for the little more, my daughter. That'd be she don't know who you were.

to hear from you. You have no idea. He sounds wonderful. Oh, really? No. No, it's nice to talk to you.
I miss you. Well, thank you. Thank you. Uh, George,
I know for those of the people listening, don't know who she is. She's a waitress at the
Denny's over on the floor. I get that. That's how it's ready, George.
I was waiting table since I was 14 in my uncle's diner. Well, that's great. Well,
no, I'm just good to talk to you, but we're on Neil's show and you know how you get.
But Neil is allowing you to accept. Well, the key part was a big tipper. That's what I heard.
I wouldn't know. I'm just a new Billy. That's all. A Billy. Yes. Thank you. Well, that's great.
And I'm putting your Neil's feeling better. I sent you a get-well card. I hope you got it.
Well, thank you. Yes. He does feel a lot better and amazing. It belies his appearance. Yeah.
I looked like him, but I feel like he looks great. He's lost a lot of weight. Let's find him.
But what a way to have to lose weight though. Oh, wait a minute. We just got a special flash here.
Debbie's TV show is not in delay on C span. So in other words, if she taking calls and it's not in
delay, okay, just makes it up. Oh, let's call her. Before you do that. Call her what? I must mention
something. Are you guys? How about Lardas? That would be good. Yes, you're good. I know. You're right.
Okay. What is yesterday? I was at a remote of one of your competitors. Station's been in the FPL.
Oh my god. Oh, I saw that. Ping-paw. No, Gilbert. Really? So I have a Gilbert's
fiery body. He made a comment that I would say that. Great. But the funniest part I have to tell you
is that he had his transistor radio and he was listening to you while he was there. Yeah,
while Gilbert's loyal. Okay, he likes to spray the oil. Oh, I'll just say that's really
loyal. Okay, George. Janice, it's been a long time. I know, but I've had to say hi to Bill.
Okay. Thank you. Say goodbye to Bill. Okay, Bill. Bye and I'll follow you wherever you go.
Okay. Saturdays, 10 to 2, WIOD. Oh, you're getting me intro. Don't let's see it, George.
Bye. No, it's in the same giving him a show. Now he can come on Saturday because I saw you
doesn't talk about me for four hours anyway because you got no show and no acting. He's got that
pathetic symphony. Hey, let me tell you something. Neil, come on and say, see you're right.
Neil always tries to get all his friends jobs and get everybody fired. You're right. See that. I'll take
on something. There's other things I like to talk about the Neil Rogers. I'm sick of hearing about
Neil. Me too. Me too. How about Bill Toul? How about Larry Beranoff? How about Ray Marsh?
How about you lambda Parapar? How about, uh, well, that's staff me. That one right there.
How about Phil Kostin? Hey, let's get those tapes out. That caused me to have that
stroke. Oh, I heard that. That was fun. That was some funny stuff. Anyway, we're going to do the
Fat Tuesday spot right now. Pat happens to be here just to coincidence and he was there at Fat Tuesdays.
Look what it's done for his life. Now he's here in the building. We have no idea why and he doesn't
either. And the gutter knows what will happen next. Anyway, Fat Tuesdays is a fun place.
After a tough day on the air like this, a good place to go and unwind, right? In fact, the timing
would be perfect if we left right now. It's 1113. They open at 1130. Oh, you know, we could make it
and Henry could drive us down there and get any of those incredible tropical drinks like
by the way, Pat said if any more imitators call it on Rick and Puts and pretend to be him, he's
going to sue their ass. And Nick just came in. You had a little meeting with first time you met him
in a long time. You had forgotten him, which is easy to do in this case. But you worked with him for
a week at W. Snow. That's right. That's it. When Fred of Astory, I left to go to W.I.N.Z.
Yeah. I was in limbo waiting to go to court, which everything's going to turn out okay.
And I was allowed to go to I.N.Z. Thanks to a wonderful judge. And anyway, you went,
you did, because I wasn't going back there, you took the job nights in W.S. News.
Eighth from midnight. And I like what happened. You know what happened after that?
Well, I remember I was in your house with you in Mary Sue the night you called Alice Rantell
and said I'm not coming in. I can't cut it anymore. Your people are crazy and you, you know,
what the hell you want. And at first they wanted to just come in and be you. Don't try to be
new. Just do your thing. And then like the second day Luke Krohn was wondering,
oh, you got to get a little more time ago. You got to meet a little more, uh, come on. Let's
talk about the Jews and the humans. Come on, Bill. And they're what they want to use immediately.
Got the hell out of that thing. Remember that. You remember that when all the people were calling up
I bill, you know, or there wasn't at the time somebody called you up on the air and said,
I hope you dropped it or something like that. Well, the first night it was the first night you
wore. Oh, yeah. It was almost one of the most vicious calls I've ever gotten. It was probably
cursing many. What is that? Is that actually Bill? What is it? It's your pill. Wouldn't that be
something like there was a pill in a box this size? I bet even Debbie couldn't sit on that.
Miami. Hello, sir. Yes. Bill, I can hand hatching an egg, you know.
Bell and Neil, I've been waiting a long time to have a bill because I never heard him before.
Well, you never heard him before? No. And I've been singing that song, whiplinng it everywhere.
Everybody in this town when I get in the shower and you start singing that before they drop the
coast. Yeah, how you doing, sir? What is your name? Uh, Eligio. I'm sorry? Eligio. That's the
thing. Eligio. Eligio. Eligio. Eligio. Eligio. So, I don't like Alice. No, no, no. Eligio.
That's fun. What nationality are you? Eligio. I'm from Puerto Rico. Not Eligio. Eligio.
Newton. John. L.I. G.I.O. What did you say it again? L.I. G.I.O.
What do you mean? Eligio. Eligio. Eligio. Eligio. Eligio. Eligio.
Yes. All right. Let's get on with the Eligio one.
The end of the video, sawed Neil Rogers' program. Yes.
See for your. Now I can't get over how much it sounds like Sam Major.
What a job that was. Maybe we can put him in there.
You know what this is in his box? It's a Bart Simpson doll. Look at that. Isn't that cute?
With little flipper on. Oh, I hate Bart. It's a Bart Simpson doll.
Like the ones that you put on your car in a windshield with the little cups. In fact,
he's wearing a little cup under his skirt. You think that's unlike Sam Major's?
Yes, he does. God. Chucked a little bit. Now the other one.
Listen, have a wonderful life, Eligio. And I got a suggestion for you.
That is a compliment, I got a suggestion for you.
Right. Find a new name, pal.
Okay. I think.
Eleven, nineteen, and W.I. and deep-villacalters here.
All we got to do, have you ever eaten at the Armadillo Cafe?
No, but I've been dying to.
Well, before you die, please eat there. Because they'd be very upset if you didn't.
It is tremendous. Not far from my house either.
It's right up the road to pieces, right up the Davy Road extension.
On a corner of Davy Road and Griffin.
That's the word of the job.
You know the other little strip shopping center there.
It looks like kind of a Yahoo place.
Like you can take your horse up there and tie it on a...
Wait a minute. It's 22 after 11.
What is that? Oh, look at this.
This is what you've been waiting for.
This is like we've been building up to this.
How many are menna?
Okay, cocking up and y'all think.
Okay. Well, that's great.
Yeah, Bill will be translating that in noon.
Now, Cass is still been questioned because Melvin just told me the good news
that it's raining at Marklite Stadium where, of course, we know it never rains.
And the game is supposed to come out at noon today, which means we're supposed to leave it.
I'm also wondering what is that our food isn't here yet, which I'm not going to eat,
but Pat and Steve and I have to go.
Oh, well, you have to go.
Well, you said I have to go at 12. Raise your hand.
But my question is, do we have contingency plans for what's going to happen?
Because I'm not going to like...
What does that mean?
Yeah, share old do the show.
By the way, did you hear us tell the story about when Bill worked at WS News for that week when I was in limbo
until that wonderful judge?
Let me go to WIs you did here.
That could. That was for your benefit.
No, I'm asking a serious question.
They all stand there with a dumb smile on their face.
What? What is the answer?
You. You what?
You want to suppose that you're riding a 1230?
You sound like somebody from David.
You what?
Coral Gables.
Neil.
You say what?
Hey, did you have an overstatement?
Look what it's been for her.
You what?
You say what?
I got a Debbie Eleanor's.
I got a Debbie Eleanor's.
I got a Debbie Eleanor's.
You what?
Debbie Eleanor's fire report.
Okay.
She's live on television.
We know that.
So we've been talking about it all morning long.
Well, I'm a wintered one.
What do you got like a 50 inch Sony?
For me?
Yeah.
Well, how the hell can you see our old body?
If you don't have a big screen.
What's Nick Novaro?
He's the center of attention.
I'm feeling.
I'm on the North Carolina.
You see on the show?
Yeah.
I should have.
They highlighted her big zits yet or what?
Nothing.
They could make her born.
Okay.
My father said she'd get enormous zits.
At least I thought that was the word he said.
It could have been something else.
They have to go either way.
Yeah.
Did you ever get a good one to watch in the Simpsons?
No, sir, but I do have my little Simpson doll here right now.
I heard.
I know.
With the little pantaloonies on him.
It's home.
He makes the show.
Okay.
Oh, so.
Is it with this homo?
Homo?
Yeah.
This is the Dwayne's Domconic.
Oh, yeah.
I'm not going to request Dwayne's Domconic.
Good because we don't have time for any requests because the show may end at noon
or not as a case may be.
We may have to fill a hole for it.
Wouldn't that be something after we cancel the concert if we were here, too?
That would be great.
Can you imagine that?
But we may be standing by.
What do we have?
Oh, no.
Hey, I'm on the floor.
The over-daffy out.
Greg needs your help, Phil.
The employment search.
What do you want?
The employment search.
Do you know that Bill Calder is sitting here,
sure, while you're rambling on and going?
No, let him go.
Let him go.
No way.
Okay, we have the line open and brown.
524 Calder.
524 W.O.D.
We don't have time for these, and there's no mix.
Jupiter.
Oh, hi, Bill.
Hi.
You know, the last time I talked to you,
you were down in New Orleans.
Oh, yeah.
They got out of there.
And I moved down here about a month ago.
I mean, where?
I used to listen to you all the time.
I'd meet night.
Well, I'll be done.
I don't know if you remember me.
No, I don't.
Oh, okay.
Well, I was listening to you all the time.
Well, you're the charming voice.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you for being charming.
Thank you for getting out in New Orleans.
Oh, well, you know, those little things
that you eating in New Orleans,
those little crawfish,
they're called crawfish, yeah.
You know how we call them there?
We call them mud bugs.
Mud bugs.
That's right.
You bite the, you suck the heads.
Yeah, it's all time.
And anyway, I, you know what?
I can't talk.
One of my famous restaurant critics
used to do that often,
but we don't get them that.
Well, I do.
You know, wait a minute.
Hold it.
What is your name, man?
My name?
My name?
My name?
Why did Pat get all red in the face
when you asked that question?
What is that all about?
I think there's something.
What is your name, man?
Maria?
Maria.
Oh, you know who this is?
No, it's Maria.
A whole lot of men are Maria.
I want to tell them about mud bugs, a crawfish.
Oh.
The people that really get into those fish,
they actually suck the heads
and it's delicious.
Yeah, sometimes it is.
Sometimes.
Okay, I know.
But anyway, you know,
I met my husband, Tuneer,
about seven years ago.
Seven years ago.
On a day,
I met him Tuneer in the...
I remember this call.
Incredible.
Well, listen, Maria, in closing.
You know, my husband is Greek.
A Greek?
Oh, my God.
You're the people that live in the house
sput and fort Lauderdale.
No, we live in Jupiter, Florida.
Yeah, but you used to wait a minute.
Didn't you?
Did you used to love your rings?
I used to live in Florida,
we used to live there in the house.
That's right.
And he used to cook Greek food.
Uh-huh.
Or you cook Greek food.
That's him.
I met him to meal.
Am I right or wrong?
I'm married to John Lennon.
You're right.
I used to get a geek.
Hey, listen, let me tell you.
I remember it.
I didn't find him.
Well, listen, what a call this is.
You can get him, I'll tell you.
You still have that amount.
We got him off there.
And you manipulate them.
No.
Listen, Maria.
There's that music.
Oh, okay, Bill.
Nice to meet you.
Okay, hey, good day, Maria.
Say hello to your husband.
Good.
Okay, I will.
Bye-bye, Neil.
Bye-bye.
28 past 11 in WIOD.
We're kind of like in limbo.
This is a comedy plot is what they love it or leave it.
Yeah.
And I'm ready to leave it right now.
We have an opening in Broward, by the way.
524 WQAM.
WIOD.
Hi, Neil.
Bill.
Who is this?
How is the G-man?
How are you?
Uh-huh.
Who is your lady?
That was Maria.
Maria.
Yeah.
How old is she?
I think she just brought your demos away.
She's adorable.
She's a, uh,
Latin American who's married to a geek from Uranus.
A big geek, it sound like.
Yeah.
And she cooks Greek food on Jupiter.
What is Greek food?
Like greasy stuff?
Yeah.
Yeah, greasy stuff.
Yeah, sure.
It's like little uh,
crawfish that you suck the head on.
That's right.
Do you agree to crawfish, sir?
Let's move forward.
Not backward.
What is the crawfish?
Okay, crawfish.
The meaning of the crawl is I want you
and Bill to sing a song for me right now.
Yeah.
Good luck to you.
Come on, Neil.
Now we aren't going to sing for you,
but we have a guy who used to work here as a matter of fact,
who does a hell of a job.
Wait a minute.
Who Alex?
Well, you shouldn't have said that
because we can't mention his name.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, it might change your whole outlook on life, okay?
Please.
Here we go.
Mr. Bird.
We don't do this for Christmas.
It's the fire.
Wait a minute.
Nobody is there somebody else.
Somebody is nobody.
We're nobody.
It's your thing along.
Nobody loves me.
Ex-self, Neil Roger.
And he really does.
Thank you.
The world is hard, Joe.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's what happened here.
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah, we're getting back to that part.
We're really in a small city.
Okay.
Yes.
The world is over.
The world is over.
Here we go.
Okay.
Next to the...
Buzz.
Buzz.
Buzz.
Buzz.
Somebody.
Buzz.
Buzz.
Buzz.
Buzz.
Buzz.
Buzz.
Buzz.
Buzz.
Buzz.
Buzz.
Buzz.
All right.
That was good for you.
Speaking of that, you know, I play that.
You know why?
Because it's the old story that I never had a chance to tell.
Well, you worked with this man, we can't mention Alex Bennett in Houston, like in the 1800s.
Long time ago.
When he came here, the first time Phil in for me said he was 49.
Then when he came to work here, he was 44. By the time he left, he was 18.
And by now, he should be like pre-embrotic at this point.
Now that was what year in 1963?
Well, my first year in radio, so the 63 years said.
Yeah, well, that's why he's 27 years ago.
So if he's 44, that means he was 17 years old when you work with him in Houston.
No, he's a lot older than that because he knew words that I didn't know, that nobody that was live in Teen or 18.
Like that, he's good, he is great.
Isn't that true, man?
I'm feeling...
Okay, hold on, this has been it.
We have an opening at Broward 524 Alex 524 WYOD.
Okay, good kiss there from a pet, that was the imposter.
Or maybe with Swarpat.
The 655 WYOD in Palm Beach, Phil Cauver's with us, we're going to be a new one.
The ballgame is allegedly starting, but I have a feeling we've gotten sucked in to a real deal here today.
See, when I tell you, hey, two hour show, no sweat, you leave it no one, everything's going to be great.
Then all of a sudden, hey, it's raining in the ballpark and you're like to stand by.
Somehow, I don't sometimes I feel like we're getting sucked in, but I could be wrong.
I'll pay phone in OJIS.
Hello.
Yes.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Yes, sir.
Neil, Neil, I haven't talked to you in, it's been like three years.
Thank God.
Yeah, I know, well, I haven't had any material, I've already had a good material in the three years.
But I think this is something that I needed to say, I don't really want to interrupt your show, but this one I think.
In other words, this is not a call from Bill Cauver.
Well, it's, sir, tell him the truth, you never heard of me, you don't care about me exactly.
To tell you the truth, I've heard about you from Neil, but I never heard of you.
Exactly.
That's right.
I knew it wouldn't, I wouldn't lie.
Hey, what is your first name?
But I should, my first name is Paul.
What is it?
Paul.
I never heard of you before.
How about some toes?
Can you ever heard of your OJIS?
Lightly buttered?
Can you ever heard of your OJIS?
No, you sound like a good caller to me, Paul.
I used to be, it's just that I haven't called in such a long time.
Well, I've been off the air for a couple of months, and I haven't taken any calls, and to me, you sound good.
Well, yeah, well, it could be, but I don't know if this is going to be good or not.
No, it might be.
There's a shot building up here somewhere, Paul.
I get the general's riff.
Now, let's get right to it.
Let's not beat around the voice.
It's actually about something that happened in the Middle East.
Last week it was a...
Something that happened in the Middle East, and you're calling this show...
Well, it's...
What was it?
A brisk, and Arab got a brisk in the Middle East.
What is it, sir?
The two countries of North Yemen and South Yemen...
North Yemen and South Yemen.
North Yemen and South Yemen.
Right.
They joined together to...
Yeah, sir, let me make a suggestion to Paul.
Can I make a suggestion to you?
I'll probably...
Happy Shavuas.
1133, and you know something?
It is Shavuas.
Right?
Oh, yeah.
I think somebody will call in and provide today's Shavuas, which is why Bill Carter's here.
He only comes on on the Jewish holidays.
W-Y-O-D.
Yeah, could I say how to bill?
Sure, hold on.
W-Y-O-D.
Okay, that was following again.
He just went for 27 minutes.
You watch.
After knowing he will not think on no more cranks on me of Palm Beach Line.
Time for times and labor.
Hail.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, somebody mentioned that you might be...
Or served time or did something in Rochester.
Serve time?
I'm serving time here, sir.
Hey, Mrs. Fitz, were you in Rochester?
Yeah, I'm born there.
You were born in Rochester?
You were born in Rochester?
I didn't know what this was.
Yeah, I was a Jew.
I know I know it's not too far from Annaculair, but what war were you around?
What war was I in?
War.
War.
By 19th, or 10th, or...
What the hell was I in there?
I was a kid.
How the hell do I know what war I was in?
Well, can't you discuss things in more or less political terms?
Well, were you there during the 1951 NBA Championship?
Yeah, I was nine years old.
Okay.
Sir, how old are you?
You don't sound very old?
35?
Yes, so what do you know about you?
What are you even born yet?
Well, my day keeps feeding me left here.
That year in Jan, oh, less Harris and my uncle was the first coach of the Rochester
Roswelln and were the Rochester Siegrams, and less Harris and played for him in 1944.
How do you like that, sir?
And probably Bobby Wonser.
Bobby Wonser and Bob Davies, Bob Davies and Arnie E. Arisen?
Yeah.
And all those go in.
And Barer, Arnie E. Arisen was a Jewel, excuse me, right?
Commonly shorter with the Montreal Royals.
Barer with a Buffalo Bison's.
And Havana Sugar Kings, who was that pitcher that pitched for the Havana Sugar?
Was it Pedro Ramos?
Pedro Ramos.
And Camilo Pascual and a partridge and a pair of three.
How do you like that?
What war did you live in?
Can't you just talk in a less clinical manner like we're part of the city?
What are the city to grow up in?
I don't know.
Okay, Terrace, there was off Holland Beck Avenue.
Holland Beck Street, or by Avenue D, Avenue D.
Over by Conkey Avenue, you know, that was number eight school.
And Brighton, right, by the 12 corners, by Don and Bob.
Do you know anything about Rochester, sir, or do you go by everything your father tells you?
Because I think your father is a real honor.
I grew up in Rochester.
You did?
No wonder you're all so good.
I think it's Don and Bob's anymore.
This cold little room.
Sure.
I hate to break in those.
But if Don and Bob's is right next door to Brighton Elementary, okay?
There's a little refill there, and I was there last summer, and it is Don and Bob.
You're wrong.
It's the original Don and they changed the name because they changed the ownership last year.
They changed the name when?
It must have been very recently because I was there with them.
I've been an article in Homer's, let me send it to you.
When did they change the name?
It's called the original Don.
When did they change the name?
Within the last year.
The less than that.
Very recently, it's right there on Monroe Avenue, sir.
What difference does it make?
What the name is?
They still have the porkers and the ground rounds.
It's still the same.
What is the guy that bought it?
Is ruining it.
The guy from Wendy's.
Yeah.
Right?
What a workout.
Well listen, have a nice day.
We'll see it on St. Paul Street, okay?
On St. Paul Street.
An Eastman Kodak.
Oh, well.
St. Paul Street.
St. Paul Street.
St. Paul Street.
St. Paul Street.
St. Paul Street.
An Eastman Kodak.
You served time there.
Yeah, I was in Monroe Prison or something.
What the hell is this man talking about?
maniac.
Well, don't take it out on me.
I'm a guest.
Normally one of your people.
Anyway, Margate is where they're really doing it at Charhaut now.
And in Coral Springs and Coconut Creek in North Lauderdale,
and all seven South Florida trots.
But the newest Charhaut is in Margate, which is a prestige joint, right?
Margate, that's the place to be exactly.
And if you're kind of hobbling around Margate looking for a great place for lunch today,
they're open every morning, early at Charhaut, for your early lunch people at 10.30.
And now they've got the Neodeal, a special everyday this week.
And for the next couple of weeks, two big buffalo sea Rochester.
We work in upstate New York.
Two buffalo-style jumbo hot dogs.
Charb world exactly the way I come on the grill.
And a large soft drink.
Only $2.99.
That's the Neodeal at Charhaut right now, including at the newest location in Margate on
441 South Atlantic Boulevard.
Margate, it's fast, it's delicious, it's fresh, they use the best ingredients.
They grind the chuck every day.
They grind their pork butts every day.
And not everybody will do that.
And they take the bone and skin off their chicken every day, which is quite a delicate
other ingredient.
So you head for a fast, inexpensive, delicious, succulent lunch at Charhaut or dinner or snack
as the case may be.
In some rise, Tamarack Davey, Hollywood, Miami Oakland Park, and the newest Charhaut at 306 North
State Road 7 in Margate.
So, Davey, get the fire on the food.
Boy, now don't start getting personal with my guest, Scalter.
The food is here from American, steak, and pizza, and these guys are picking out Steve and the
Pat.
This is the real Pat, not the imposter.
And the bill is going to dig in with something.
Oh, that's weird.
Now, what's the word from the ballpark?
This is turning into a real what?
The game is on.
Everything's great.
Good.
Because I'm leaving it alone.
I have to deposit Mr. Calder back in his place.
WIOD.
What are you looking at?
A basket, sir?
What is your story?
What kind of a phone are you on?
That's better.
I was on a speaker phone.
Well, get off it, pal.
I don't know.
I'd like to sing.
You like to sing?
What do you want to sing?
Oh, nobody.
Till somebody does that.
Okay, hold on.
We'll get to you.
WIOD.
Hey, with that guy knows about Rochester.
You could put in a symbol.
And have room for a potion alarm left over.
Steve Rees and Bouchin Lombs.
Yeah.
An empire born from the world.
What Lord did you live in?
Do you know Bill Calder, sir?
Yeah, he's great.
Right.
He's right here.
Yeah, a greatest pal.
Is that it?
No change in his hand.
No changes pal.
What the hell is going on here?
Man, look at this.
They got enough food for the Chinese army.
You guys are crazy.
Look at that.
Hi.
Look at that.
Salas and I can't eat anything.
But thanks to the memories.
No, I can't eat it dear.
Like I told you.
I have to take a pill.
It's a big process when I eat.
This is good.
I want to worry about running downstairs now.
Exactly.
We brought a little container for you there.
Yeah.
Just don't dribble on the carpet in place.
W-Y-O-D.
Exactly.
W-Y-O-D.
Hey, how you doing?
Okay.
What's going on?
We got the serious figureplor on the term spike.
Okay.
Lay it on a spell.
We got very short on time.
A lot of pressure here.
A lot of pressure.
Go ahead.
Okay.
We got, just as you come over, Okchov, there's three of them right in the row waiting for you.
Three pigs?
They're out there.
And what the hell is the deal with I-75 now?
If anybody knows about that, you know they've got the 45 mile speed signs up there.
I know.
So there's no construction.
There's nothing going on.
They just want the pace to be able to put you over.
Everybody's going 65-70.
I come down there this morning.
45 speed limit on the row that's out in the, in the boondocks.
I know.
It's a joke because they line up there too.
And don't point over if you go 46-47.
Yeah.
For going too slow.
Hey, did you hear Gover down the Rineri show this morning?
Yes, sir.
I sure did.
Oh, God.
He's just everywhere.
Look at the food that's coming there.
These people out of their minds.
Cheese.
New place.
It's American steak and pizza, sir.
It's great.
They got pizza.
They got fillies, steak sandwiches.
We got salads.
We got tons of stuff.
And I got to see how much everybody shoveled down their throat.
Oh, God.
That's a killer.
Thanks for the reports, sir.
Mr. Calder.
Yes, sir.
Good luck, T.A.
And I hope you feel better.
Thank you.
And now, Tony can burglety.
Okay, Tony.
Hi, everybody.
Now, wait a minute.
This fat pig, Johnny Dark just come in here, now that we haven't seen him hide in the
area from the coast all morning long.
The food comes in here and this.
Look at how ready he is in the face.
This man would no shame this disgusting, cowardly, radio-drifter pizza.
He never comes over to say hi to him.
Over here from the coast.
And all he could sniff it through the damn doorway over here.
I can never see anything like it in my life.
You are a disgrace.
Have some food, Joe.
Um.
Or are you still waiting to sing?
How are you doing?
Sir.
Hello.
Are you still waiting?
Yes.
Okay, okay.
Um.
How about you, man?
Are you okay?
How's the world be all those readers disappeared?
I'll tell you.
Okay, here's a mobile in Miami.
Yeah, on the Palm Beach line.
Okay.
On the way.
Get in.
Big spender.
I'm the first, uh, yeah, calling my distance on a mobile.
What?
Great.
I've called you a couple times that you've always hung up on me and I don't know.
Well, no.
Okay.
Let's see if we can do it again.
Let's work on it.
Uh, what I like.
What do we do?
Here's a listen.
I have to take this man home.
I have to go to Mommies and Mr. Disney already thinks that I'm going to the ballgame.
They're sorry.
I can't go.
I can't go.
Okay.
I can't go.
I've got 85 people.
I've got 4,000 pounds of food here.
People are crazy.
I just had a stinkin' stroke, sir.
If I have the line.
I should sound sick, then they'd have a little more sympathy.
See, everybody would go, you hope you feel it better.
I just had a goddamn stroke.
If I have a line.
Yes, sir.
If I have a line with you now.
I just want to ask you a question.
You're a great painter.
I don't want to be excited.
I'm a great one.
You're a great entertainer.
A great painter.
And you definitely have to work on it.
This is going to be a shot.
We're having such a good time here.
You want to, you want to, you want to, like, sell the negative depressing crap.
I just wonder whether when you talk to your personal friends, and I know you have hundreds,
do you talk to them the same way you talk to your listener?
They're damn right.
That's why I stay alone all the time.
Otherwise, when you're on the phone at home, you got to go home.
This is just a radio show.
Okay, sir.
I can't understand it.
Now I know why you usually hang up on you.
Because you just don't like sitting there.
Oh, radio show.
When you're at home, do you have like a microphone in front of your coffee table?
Yes, I have a big thing right on my coffee table.
Because you can't say that on the radio?
A big thing.
Yes, I'm right.
Well, I just want to whether you're like at home.
No.
Ask Bill Carter.
He'll tell you that off the air.
I'm a wonderful, warm, sensitive piece of crap.
All right.
You can't trace this clock because I'm on a mobile right?
That's what you think.
Uh-oh.
See, have a nice day.
We were really doing it there for a while.
How is the food coming here?
Have you had anything yet?
Or have you taken it with you?
Bill, no.
I'm not just sitting with you.
I've asked you.
Amazing.
I know.
Well, the guy from Rochester and this guy out of Github, I hope they run into each other in a highway
and the pigs nail their ass.
Hollywood.
Hey, Neil.
How you doing?
Good.
Pay a question for you.
Sometimes a friend of mine has two original 1956 World Series.
Does this have to do with our guests, sir?
Yes, does.
I'm an old titan.
Oh, okay.
1956 Yankees versus the Dodge.
John Larson and Don Nukum.
But the bill is sound magly.
Two baseballs with the name names of all the team members.
Johnny Padbury.
Say what did they make?
Joe Collins.
Sure.
Yeah, you bet.
Like how much?
I don't know.
I know.
I'm having a nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
I'll see you in the New York.
Who?
I don't know.
Now, what's your question for Bill?
Who?
Let's go with one who, uh, that's your sword.
Yeah.
Hollywood.
Hey, how you doing?
Okay.
Hey, I've last year at Chirua.
As you tell me, calling you next Chirua, so.
I'll share a coming next Chirua, WIOD.
Yes, let's speak to Bill please.
You bet.
You know who he is?
Uh, Bill Coler.
That's right.
Good.
Well, he's here right now, sir, and he's desperate to talk to somebody
knows who the hell he is.
Okay.
Because we sure don't.
Thank you.
Go ahead.
Hello, Bill.
Yes, sir.
How are you?
Oh, great.
Um, do you think we can talk, um, heavy or light?
What?
Heavy.
What do you want to talk about the Middle East?
I'll take Middle East.
Yeah, I'm on the chart.
Yeah, man.
People coexistence.
Yeah, let's talk about that grape stain on Grubochau's head.
Maybe the Soviets can lick on that for a while.
You're the good-natured.
You're just going down.
Yeah, what the hell is this?
Is this a fun color?
Or, you know, the one with these morbid douchebags, sir?
Bill, Bill, do you want to talk politics?
Yeah, that's up his house.
Sure.
Boy, that's my strong suit.
This is the red horse of the apocalypse.
Do you remember me?
He's giving me a blank look like who the hell are you?
I'm going to be a twilight zone.
Oh, listen, sir.
I hate that.
I hate to move on, but we have an important call here.
You're not going to believe who's on a phone now, who we heard, uh,
concerning with, uh, what's your name this morning?
I'm WQAM.
All right.
Think of Debbie Ellis.
Okay, we got that fish in your mind.
Right.
Big fat.
Right.
Fat.
Rotund.
Is that a good clue?
Mike.
No.
You're going to pay Lou any messages?
Oh, my God.
How you don't bill?
Uh, hold me.
How are you?
That's enough of that.
Bill, how you feeling, buddy?
Okay.
I feel great.
And I want to tell you something.
Lou, who I love is not going to leave on.
Why is passing me by Lou and Lou gave me a bottle of champagne.
And I think that I was going to open it up when I moved back into my house.
Yeah.
And, uh, I still haven't opened it.
How about when you get your next show?
Yeah.
That's at a day's 10 to 2 on 610 WIOD start on this week.
You know, I'm not allowed to talk to you.
That would be terrific.
That's correct.
That's the luck to you.
But they don't say thank you so much Lou.
Think of dance all the way, baby.
Thank you.
Easy go, boy.
Desperate third.
Pretty disappointing for his backers.
But then what do you expect?
The full of his money are soon parted.
Miami.
On the vocal line.
Is it gone?
Okay.
Very good luck to you.
All right.
It's 11.
Till then we're going to do our last break of the hour.
At the ball game coming up.
Right?
Is everything okay at Mark Light Stadium?
Everything's okay.
Hunky Dory.
The game is on.
Fist.
What was passed?
Well, almost done.
I'm not a chance to say anything.
Why have you eaten anything yet?
No, I'm going to.
I'll ask you.
I do.
These people respect your privacy.
They want you to eat in peace.
They don't want you to be a slum like me.
Need on the air and then start grudging and burping on the air.
I'd have bring in some of your phone messages and play them on here on the cassette.
No, they get an idea.
Well, I'd be glad to see you.
I have a few of what I could use.
Anyway, those of you who are just here.
They want to thank our friends at American Stake and Pizza.
They're 24-86 North Federal Highway and Lighthouse Point in the Freddie's Plaza.
They have raw wings and affiliate steak sandwiches and chicken and sauce and all kind of stuff here.
And you know this is not going to waste, right?
That you're like dribbling all over the place and they're chicken too.
Miami.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Is this Neil?
Yeah.
I want to ask you a question.
You want to ask me a question?
Yes, sir.
Does it have to do with our guests?
No.
No.
Okay.
Let's go to a deer field.
Yes.
Hello, Neil.
How are you?
When is this?
I want to ask you a question regarding Bill Colder.
Yeah.
If they woke him up at 2 o'clock in the morning, would he cook like Gabby Hays or like himself or what?
Elmer Fud.
Let's go to a tamarack.
I'm dying over here.
Okay.
See these easier people starting to come in now.
Let's go to Hollywood.
Oh, yeah.
Bill.
Yeah.
How about a problem?
Could you help me with it?
Yes, sir.
What about life?
It's about a palm-peamatory gestulation.
Oh, really?
Yes.
Well, listen.
Put it away.
We'll talk to you later.
Let's go to Broward.
Oh, I know who this is.
How's Tom Dworkos moving around so much?
Hold on, Jim.
W-Y-O-D.
Bill.
Yeah.
How you doing?
Okay.
Hello, Bill.
Good memory, Donna.
What does it say?
Still called her.
Oh, yeah.
All right.
Hays is like doing bad radio, sir.
He's eating on the air.
Oh, they all eat on the air.
They think they eat on the air.
It'll like rub off, you know.
Wow, it'll be nice to have you on from six to from 10 to two on Saturdays, Bill.
Yes, you're starting this weekend, I think.
I hope so.
That's the rumor we're starting.
Now I know why he brought me in here today.
Now I just don't done me when you were sitting there.
You sound great.
You do.
You sound excellent.
If it don't Joey's chair real good there, would you bring a Bill Marshal to the lampage
your material?
There's a feature on how shots might.
Who is this?
Who's your hot shot's might?
It's like you have those tapes?
What a look of recognition on your face like.
Who the hell is it?
What tapes were they, sir?
Oh, tapes of all kinds of weird old music.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Now you remember, right?
Yeah.
What do you, don't say it.
You do.
Who's your hot shot?
There you go.
And that's not happening.
There's no hot shot, son.
I'll do it.
I just jumped in a chicken wing.
Oh, try one.
Just think that the who's your hot shot's got you all choked up.
Listen, we're real short on pen.
We want to get to all these great colors before that big ball game in the sky descends.
All right.
Well, I hope that you're soon, Bill.
Okay.
All right.
See ya.
See it's a communist plot actually.
Joey sent this stuff in.
Oh, this is good stuff.
Mobile in Pompato.
Yes.
Hi.
Good morning.
Buenos dias.
I am from Hylia.
But anyhow, I just wanted to say hello to Bill and tell him I missed him.
He used to wake me up every morning at 6 o'clock.
Thank you.
It's really good to hear that you're doing fine.
Well, I don't know.
You know, I never did know what was really wrong with you.
I just knew that you went for some tests and then you got sick or something.
But I was OD on radio.
Anyhow, I just wanted to say I was nice to hear you on Neo Show and I missed you on the radio.
Thank you so much.
And I'm in the early Annabelle.
Okay.
Thank you.
I'm Ray Lyon.
All right.
Bye-bye.
Wait a minute.
What is that?
What?
What is that?
What do you want?
What the hell do you want?
Is it giving me like speed up, out time at 57?
You tell me that now?
Why the hell didn't you tell me that before?
You shmendrick?
Why didn't you tell me that before?
It's not on there.
You don't believe it?
We got like 41 seconds to say goodbye.
Well, thank you, Bill.
It's been a real of three to three hours and thanks for the opportunity to expose myself to you.
Okay.
Put it away.
The same to you, Pat.
The people that you've got to talk all over the building.
Oh.
Speaking of that, the hurricane's going to take some serious ass.
They're going to be considered ill.
Hopefully coming up in a different couple of seconds here is a matter of fact.
Thank you, Bill.
And if they win, the second game of the championship game at 4 o'clock this afternoon, we pray we hope and Rick and Puts are playing.
They're in shul and honor of Shivu is playing.
Thanks, Rick.
For a hurricane, double victory today.
Okay.
Any time.
I really enjoyed it.
I'll see you around the block, say hi to Bill's tool, and no, really.
Thank you, Pat.
And don't forget to toast to it in your way.
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow at 10 here on 610-W-I-O-D.
