I gotta go my brain muffin just kicked in.
I'm gonna run you back to me, man.
I'm gonna run you back to me, man.
I'm gonna run you back to me, man.
I'm gonna run you back to me, man.
I'm gonna run you back to me, man.
Okay, 10 out of 7 at WYOD.
If anybody was at the homeowner's meeting at Mayfair last night,
I'd sure like to find out.
I would have liked to have been a fly on the wall there,
but I didn't go.
I could find out what transpired.
Probably nothing.
And I have some more to pass along about that little later on.
Also, not planning, of course, was on last night.
We'll probably get our not-slanding people.
WYOD.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
Hello.
Who's this?
This is Joanne.
Joanne?
I have been to be the niece of the people that Leo is living
is staying at their house.
Really?
Well, this is Neil, Joanne.
Hi.
How you doing?
Good.
The not-slanding lady told me that I should call you.
Yeah.
That you've been trying to get in touch with my aunt, Nunkal.
Yeah, hopeless.
Hopeless.
I don't think they exist.
Well, I think.
I'm not sure, but I think that they're in Hong Kong right now.
They're in Hong Kong?
Great.
Well, that's nice.
They're also really never at home.
They're always at their shop.
Don't you have that phone number?
Yeah, I sure do.
Have you tried reaching them there?
Yeah.
They're not there.
Yeah, I was talking to your neighbor who lives behind you.
Oh, yeah.
If it's some pretty nasty things, it's not here.
You know something?
I haven't done anything to the neighbor who lives behind me.
They act like some kind of psychotic recluses or something.
What is their problem?
What's their problem?
Besides a satellite dish, which was none of their business in the first place, what's their problem?
Well, I was talking to her yesterday and said that it's making the neighborhood look crappy and stuff.
It makes the neighborhood look crappy?
Yeah, that you have your satellite because she couldn't keep her boat there.
No, I don't have a...
Nobody sees the satellite.
It's got a patio on it.
There's nobody sees it.
Right.
I know that's a problem.
And you know something?
And you know something?
They have an awning, then umbrella, just same kind.
It's not open, but they have it over there patio, table two.
Same colors.
Right.
Now, what's the difference?
I don't know.
I told her that it makes the neighborhood look crappy.
How come nobody else in the neighborhood thinks it looks crappy?
I don't know.
Yeah.
I just told her that I think all the neighbors should just leave you alone.
So what are all the other...
I'm sure the audience would love to hear.
What are all the other nasty things they had to say that we can repeat on the air?
Well, just that it looks crappy and she's mad because she can't have her boat there.
Why should she have a boat?
What's the comparison between a boat and a patio umbrella?
Is this woman...
No.
Out of her mind?
I don't know.
They can't have their boat, so I can't have my dish.
See, do you see how childish these people all are?
Well, that's what I thought.
Do you see how juvenile it is?
I'd like you to deal with that with my uncle.
Well, you know what?
Let me just tell you something.
Once I take the dish out, which I have another 11 days before I have to remove it.
Okay.
And then I'll take it out.
Once I take it out, the umbrella is going to stay there just out of spite.
And there's no log against having a patio umbrella.
Okay?
There just won't be anything underneath it.
So they won't have accomplished anything.
Right.
Well, it's just like the neighborhood food trash on your lawn.
That didn't accomplish anything.
Yeah, it accomplished something.
All right.
It got everybody crazy.
That's what it accomplished.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's wonderful.
It's a wonderful complex.
It's just a wonderful...
Just tell your aunt and uncle when you talk to them next time,
just for them to kiss the ground that they don't have to live there.
I'm sorry.
I'll tell you what, I'll take the dish out and I'll put a boat in my backyard.
How's that?
Will that make her feel better?
No, that'll piss her off.
Good.
Good.
Only won't be a real boat.
It'll just be a replica, like of the Queen Mary.
How's that?
And we can have two queens.
Okay.
But anyway...
If I talk to them, I'm going to tell them that you're trying to get to them.
Yeah.
I'll call you.
Well, what are they going for?
Like a year or something?
I think they were going for a few weeks.
They're really nice.
Yeah.
Boy.
The neighbor was saying that they're supposed to be moving back, too.
But I didn't hear that.
Well, the neighbor sure knows an awful lot, don't they?
They're not moving back for three years.
That's what I heard.
Yeah.
So the neighbor's got some bad information.
The neighbor's awfully nosy is what I think would be the bottom line, right?
Got a nose like serenote a burger rack.
Like Joey Reynolds.
Well, listen, what's your first name?
Joanne.
Joanne, thanks very much for the information.
Okay.
And next time you talk to my lovely neighbors, give them a message for me.
Okay.
Tell them up there.
See ya.
Okay, bye.
Bye.
What a great first call.
Outstanding.
They don't want me to have the dish because they couldn't keep their boat in their yard.
Now, I think it's pretty obvious.
You know, you see the similarity between the patio on it, like maybe an alligator or a boat or a rhinoceros or hippopotamus or
you know, a 40 gallon tank with piranhas.
I think there's a lot of similarity, don't you?
Boy, just incredible.
Shocking.
Shocking.
Anyway, boy, that's some pretty good information.
See how you have to find out through the radio show.
You can't find out anything else, you know, just through regular channels because they're in Hong Kong and this one's on the moon.
And that one's on Uranus or whatever.
It's 10.16.
Well, people are starving.
Okay, just everybody relax.
Boy, that first call, we might as well go home now.
That told me everything I needed.
No.
By the way, if you're interested in becoming the Miracle Baseball Team PA announcer for all Miracle Baseball Games at Municipal Stadium in Pomano Beach, call 7-8-3-21-11 for more information.
Now, what does anybody know what that is?
The Miracle?
Okay.
In other words, if you call, it'll be a great deal.
Okay, let's go to the Notz Landing Lady on 5.
That's the Notz Landing Boy.
Well, the Notz Landing Boy.
Well, I saw Notz Landing and I assumed.
Are we going to wait a minute?
Hold on a second.
She's on 4.
Yeah, I'm on 4 now.
And he's on 5.
Why don't you put him on?
We can put him on together.
Hi, Notz Landing Lady.
Hello, how you doing?
How's that?
Good.
What do you think?
I thought it was pretty decent.
Yeah, it was okay.
It was okay.
Can you believe some people that honestly that they're showing how many women are there?
Yeah, that's really nice.
Can money really buy that many women at the same time?
Anything that moves, he's into.
He really is.
And what about Danny?
And Paige's mother is pretty much anything too.
Yeah, she's always been like that.
Yeah, all over everything like that.
Yeah, blanket.
Exactly.
That was the only really good part of the show.
Yeah.
Is when he was just about starting to curl Anne's hair and a little locks around his finger and Paige walked in.
That was good.
It was good.
I had a few good yucks over there.
And of course, Michael had a lot on the show.
I figured out something about Michael.
He's like on the outside of everybody's existence.
He's like a little lemon looking from the outside in.
It really is.
But he doesn't have any life.
He's not into anything.
He doesn't do anything.
He just goes to work.
He comes home and can only imagine after that.
But that's it.
Yeah, he looked good last night.
Yeah, well, yeah, for about six seconds.
What about Danny thinking that he owns the house now after that?
Danny is kind of guy.
You know, something I think Danny used to be in radio management.
I really do.
How does he get to own the house after just moving?
Well, he just kind of like moved in.
She moved out.
So he's there and she's not.
You know, they say possession is 90% of the law.
That's it.
Like my neighbor's boat.
Did you hear that about my neighbor's boat?
Is it, you know, really stop and think about the comparison.
See, this is sour grapes.
We can have our boats so you can have your dish.
You should have figured that out.
After the prank.
It's ruining the looks of the neighborhood.
What are these people thinking about?
And they are so mysterious.
Now every time you go anywhere outside, they all of a sudden close the blinds
and the lights all go off.
It's like, man, it's the most bizarre scene I have ever seen.
It's almost like you should write a book called Mayfair's Land.
I'm beginning to wonder if Danny ain't hanging out with them.
That might be it.
Maybe he's the relative.
And he could be.
And how about these speaking of broadcasts?
And how about Michellee's groupies?
You know anything about any of that stuff?
That one hairy guy is like Gilbert almost.
See, I thought I was losing my mind because I looked when they caught hairy eyes.
So that's not the guy that they kept showing before.
And it wasn't.
And the other guy is kind of lurking outside.
He had one regular and one not so regular.
Yeah.
Well, in this business, there are always some weird psychopaths out there
who get all hopped up, you know, just can't control themselves.
Take it a little too seriously.
Yeah.
So I think probably what's going to happen.
This is my prediction.
What was that?
Was that one of Val's kids again?
Yeah.
Val Valin.
Val Valin.
Yeah.
Anyway, my prediction is that the last episode of this season,
somebody's going to shoot.
This guy's going to shoot at Michellee and then it's going to be like,
we'll have to wait till September.
Like, close hangar.
Remember what they did with Val last year in the last show?
Well, same thing.
Every last episode has to hang on a shooting.
Yeah.
That's true.
I think Val and Gary may be a...
An item, yeah.
Yeah.
No question.
Well, they're a match made in heaven.
And Olivia's been held by...
I noticed that Val had a Ryan wanted Gary's horses too, so...
Yeah, did you see Olivia come in this morning on the bus?
Yeah.
How did you like that shot of Miami International Airport?
Isn't it nice that they've changed the facing on the whole airport?
That was the most phony shot.
I guess for six seconds they weren't going to come all the way down here to shoot on location.
Wouldn't that be something if they did come down here and shoot part of the show on location?
Show where on your show.
Yeah, and then maybe Michael will come down to get his money from...
What's his name?
Harold, yeah.
That's a good idea.
You went to do a show together.
I'll sell him a bus ticket.
Well, listen, excellent job.
You've analyzed it perfectly.
And you're becoming quite a match yourselves.
All righty.
Okay.
We'll talk to you next Friday, Neil.
Bye-bye.
Okay, there they go.
Mr. and Mrs. Frickin' Frack, ooh, I like that.
Can you do it in there?
There we go.
Okay, 21 past 10, W-I-O-D.
And it was okay last night.
I wasn't one of the great barn burners in a history of not slandering, but it was okay.
It wasn't Tom Broke on the Nightly News.
I'm sick of that.
I'm sick of that.
No, this is the day of the year.
Would everyone do me a tie or this?
Say, Colleen, would you be wanting to come over to my place to help me wax my shell?
Ooh, now this I would, my compatriot.
If you be wet in the clean.
I know there's a smart lassie.
Please make sure her lad is wearing the Kelly Green prediction of leprecha condoms.
Don't be wishing I'd afford to live clover.
I'll fall in for the gift of gab.
Especially if you plan on kissing some blindy stones.
And what have you?
The doublet in your prediction.
With leprecha condoms they're strong enough for a man.
But I like him too.
So take yourself a leprecha condom.
And you won't be catching anything else.
Okay, we have a very distraught collar online.
What is it?
What's 6?
Are you there?
No, there's that ticking sound.
Nick's probably going to be happy about that.
You know who that was.
That was Nick's buddy, his number one fan.
I had something special.
I'll plan for him.
But he'll have to call back before I'll play it.
Okay, we have one open line in Broward and one in Palm Beach on a very mellow Friday.
Don't you feel just like laying back today and just taking a little nap?
Just that ambience.
Thicing warm outside.
And the wind is blowing in the breeze there in the trees and between your knees.
And it's just kind of one of those weekends.
Let's try Haya Lea.
Hello.
I'm Neil.
Good morning.
How are you?
How are you?
Okay, what's the twinging?
Oh, I just woke up.
Oh, man.
What a beautiful dway.
Day.
Dway.
But it's so beautiful.
Yeah.
The sun is shining here and the gorgeous Haya Lea.
You're not in Haya Lea.
They wouldn't let you in Haya Lea.
I'm in Haya Lea.
I'm party.
What do you do?
Shop at Miami Springs at the video store.
Oh, man.
Who's that?
Who's that in the back?
Are you all sleeping together?
Yeah.
We all wake up together this morning with a start, I bet.
We are.
This is what.
This is what gives new meaning to the phrase jumpstart.
Oh, I knew.
They are.
They're all there together.
They think they're funny.
They what?
They think they're funny.
Okay.
But do you have funny?
I told you that's a funny radio.
No, they're getting out of hand now.
They're getting out of hand?
Well, that's about time.
Wait, wait, wait.
Where you guys stop it?
You guys are showing me twer.
Neil.
Will you get them out of the sack?
No.
Do you know what time it is already?
It's out of my sweeping bag.
It's 10.30 already.
Get them out of the sack.
Okay.
None of them work on corn wheels.
And have a great weekend.
Okay, that was Elmer Fudge, Jr.
28 past 10 at WIOD.
Okay, there's an opening and date.
And we'll answer Broward right here.
Won't we?
WIOD.
I'm sorry.
What happened to you?
I just couldn't take it though.
Everybody was happy and I...
Listen, listen.
This is going to make you feel better.
Okay, listen.
Just don't say anything yet.
All right.
All right.
Don't be a nigg head.
Lock it in.
Have you feel better?
Thank you.
I have some bad news though.
What?
I'm going to read a memo.
You ready?
Go ahead.
You might start hyperventilating when you hear this.
Go ahead.
To AM programming at NewsStab from Boy Geary.
Thanks to Nick Lawrence's quick action and eyewitness
to the Miramar plane crash was routed
to the 610 WIOD newsroom, allowing us to get the story
on the year first.
For his quick action, Nick will be enjoying a dinner for two
at Bert and Jack's Nice Going Nick.
Come.
Carbon copy.
Nick Lawrence.
I hate him.
Good.
I knew I'd get him in the right frame of mind.
One hat, by the way, yesterday on Alex's show in the midst of
a 600-other hate calls, he had the guy who did this card.
This guy, boy, his voice is so recognizable.
I haven't heard him other than on this card until yesterday.
If you missed the Neil Rogers show yesterday on 610 WIOD,
you missed this.
Is this the bird?
Yeah.
Bird, how you doing?
Okay.
Listen, do me a favor, play anything because I can't stand listening to you.
You start like a douchebag.
Do you just need me a favor, play anything?
Well, can I ask you a question before you go?
Oh, God, you sound so stupid.
I hate to talk to you.
Yeah, go ahead.
Why did you call me?
I didn't call you.
You're not just to tell you not to say anything.
Just play something.
Oh, God can't stand it.
Well, then why are you listening?
I'll play something already.
Why won't you answer me?
Oh, God, stand it.
You won't see he won't talk to me.
Oh, we got a car here.
Hello.
He had turned it down to about 60.
I'm ready to really freeze in here.
I'm serious.
Turn it down, make it as cold as you want, man.
That's a way to do it.
I want to be like Disney.
I want to be on ice.
Mike Disney.
Mentally that is.
Anyway, it's 10.30 a.w.i.o.d.
It's a wonderful Friday.
The Nuts Landing people have called.
And my land lady's niece is that what it was called.
And it's been pretty productive.
W-I-O-D.
Okay, probably next friend again, getting a little distraught.
W-I-O-D.
That's what I said.
Yeah.
Hello.
Are you on a phone?
Are you like between a rock and a hard place?
Who is this?
This is Neil.
Who's this?
You are on the radio, sir.
There's a seven-second delay.
Now, did you call to speak to me or hear yourself on the radio?
I called to speak to you.
Okay, now are you in the car?
Where are you?
You're on the radio.
You're on the radio.
Sir?
How can you always talk bad about Florida?
About Florida?
Yeah.
Have you ever seen a map?
Yeah, I've seen a map.
Do you see the shape of the state of Florida?
Sir, are you listening to me?
Yes, I'm listening.
Have you seen the shape of the state of Florida?
Yeah, what about it?
What does it look like?
It looks like a panhandle.
It looks like a panhandle?
Yeah.
How can we not go back up north this Florida?
Sir, let me ask you a question.
Do you know what a panhandle is?
Yeah.
Do you know Oklahoma?
Do you know anything?
Yeah.
I know where I work.
I don't care where you work unless you want to give me a free plug.
Excuse me?
You want to give me a free plug?
What do you sound so surly about?
What is your problem?
Why are you so surly?
You people listen to this show every day over there, don't you?
Yeah.
Then what's the problem?
Unfortunately, we listen to it.
Oh, in other words, somebody is forcing you to listen.
Yeah.
Who is it?
Is it somebody?
This guy named Rick Paglino.
Rick, is Rick over there?
Yeah.
Put Rick on the phone.
Hold on.
Slime ball.
Come here.
Come on, Rick.
Rick, come on, Rick.
I want to talk to Rick.
I don't want to talk to this guy.
Guys.
Hello, Neil.
Is this Rick?
Yes.
Who is that guy?
He's one of the workers here that I want to talk to.
I'm out content.
What is his problem?
He, uh, I don't know what his problem is.
I've been listening to you for a long time.
And I come to work over here.
I want to listen to you on the radio.
And they always want to turn it off to another stage.
Yeah, because you're a bunch of do-do bags, Rick.
Well, that's exactly what they are.
And now listen to you right now.
And he said, well, I'm going to call him up.
And I said, you can't even get through.
And he called up and you got right through.
Sure, on a Palm Beach line, no sweat.
Yeah.
So I like to listen to you.
And my mother listens to you all right.
Yeah.
Well, you know, I asked him what the state of Florida looks like.
He said a panhandle.
I mean, this guy's got the brains of a monkey.
Well, he's got a fart in his brain.
He's got a brains of a two-inch monkey.
He's got the brains of a three-year-old pig me.
Exactly.
I couldn't have said it better, Rick.
Well, listen, don't take any crap from these y'all.
Who's just telling them to bug off?
Tell them the reason they don't like the show is they're too stupid to understand it.
That's their problem.
I know everything that's going on.
Exactly.
You know, when you say something, they don't know what you're talking about.
I know what you're talking about.
Right.
Well, that's why they feel left out.
It's just like my neighbor with their boat.
They can't have their boat, so I can't have my dish, right?
Right.
Same crap.
All right.
Well, you have a good weekend and don't take any crap from morons, Rick.
Okay, no more crap.
Okay.
Thanks.
See ya.
There's a kind of guy we respect in Palm Beach, who stands up for his rights and tell you,
what's the state of Florida look like?
And he says, a panhandle suit.
Don't you understand the panhandle is the handle and the upper part of the state and the upper part of the peninsula?
Or is that word too big for you, sir?
All I see, he wouldn't understand what the state looks like because he probably don't have one.
Anyway, it's 1034 at WIOD.
Let's go to Miami.
Hello.
Hey, you know, the best part of not planning is pages ass.
Well, there's something for everybody on that show, sir.
Yeah, I'm telling you.
You've obviously been watching very closely.
Yeah, and how's your panhandle doing?
Is it hanging there?
Yeah.
Well, obviously, there's somebody in Palm Beach who was born without one.
Well, let me tell you something new.
You're so suck.
I know.
But you know what?
What?
You love it.
You're right.
Okay.
1035 at WIOD.
You see that stuff for Alex.
Don't waste your time with me because I've been here too long and I know better.
The Palm Beach line's ringing again.
ATT operator, we've picked up from BJ.
BJ in the Bahamas.
Where's BJ?
Where's it call coming from, Oppa?
It's from Delaware, sir.
From where?
Delaware.
From Delaware.
Yes, we certainly will operator and have a wonderful weekend.
Thank you.
You too.
Okay.
Hello.
Hello.
Who is this?
It's BJ.
Great.
How come you sound so quiet?
Well, you hung up on me the first time.
Why is that?
I don't know.
I probably because I'm calling the Palm Beach line.
I hung up on you when this morning?
No, just like when you entered a second ago, you said the Palm Beach line is ringing again.
Yeah.
No, no, we had a call from there a minute ago.
I know, it was me.
You answered it and said you called back.
No, no.
We just, we just, when you listen to me, dunderhead, we just had a call from there.
Just talk to somebody there.
Oh.
Rick.
Well, I just called on there too.
It is buzzing buddies up there.
Well, listen, so you're on now.
Don't quench.
Don't belly ache.
You've been down here too long.
Just think you're in Delaware.
Think what heaven you're in.
Now you're going to hold on a second, right?
All right.
Because we're paying for it.
We've got to do a little business, but we're paying for it.
Sure.
Unless you've got something else exciting going on up there.
No.
Like maybe you ran into a peninsula.
And we'll win if there's a car coming down.
Okay, hold on.
One car.
Okay, check out, see what kind it is and we'll be back to you.
All right.
Okay, we'll come back to Delaware in a second.
It's 1036 at WIOD.
Come with me to my weekend place.
We're going to be doing new things.
This is the weekend to do things.
We'll hear the big games and all the big names.
It's your game.
It's my place.
It's some place special.
WIOD.
Now, doesn't that bring back great memories of home, sir?
Yes.
Boys all choked up about it.
Either that or falling asleep.
What are they?
Would you wake up, sir?
Oh, well, I know you're in Delaware, but that's no excuse.
Let me ask you.
Delaware, like a...
I don't know where I'm going to car, too.
Is Delaware like a...
An insula or a panhandle?
Say what now?
Just ignore it.
So what's going on?
Not much.
Boy, you are so exciting today.
Now, usually you give us at least a little something.
Well, you're giving us something today.
It's called constipation.
I'm looking forward to a little bit of that.
I'm just kind of getting over some salmonella poisoning.
Oh.
You know how you look forward to the...
I thought Sal played for the Oakland A's, third base.
Huh?
I thought he played third base for the Oakland A's.
Yeah, but they're locked out right now, so.
It's...
It's...
What?
Boy, they're...
We're getting sabotaged by Hispanic provocateurs.
Oh, did the TV Martina or whatever go on today?
TV Martina, yeah.
Oh, so that's probably what it is.
Castro has probably increased the power over there.
Trying to knock WI of D off here.
So anyway, boy, this...
I'm telling you, people are just falling under the floor from this call.
I figured out about the guy in Palm Beach, by the way,
the call earlier, he took shop in high school.
Go ahead, sir.
See you don't understand any of it, because wouldn't you be better off on hold for a few minutes?
Um...
I mean, it's up to you.
It's your call.
What is the reason you called, besides the point of view of a coma?
I'm disappointed to hear the red call on the Palm Beach line,
because I really was calling to say that I think you ought to change this line from the Palm Beach line.
To the Delaware line.
To the Delaware line, because it's the only line I ever call in on.
Yeah, okay.
Have a nice weekend.
Okay, you too.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, God.
Let's rip him and ask now, okay, you can't hear us.
That was pathetic, wasn't it?
That could have been one of the worst calls of all time.
One of the worst in history.
1041 at WI of D, but we got a humor, right?
So if there's anybody who took shop in Palm Beach called 655,
isn't...
Now Jews don't take shop in high school, okay?
Trust me.
But there are some people out there who take shop, which means basically...
I don't want to get into it.
You know what it means.
Carol City.
We can't call watching quite a lot of tales.
Talking about how bombs are stealing 95 per miles.
When Suggles Lee was a bulletin to dish up onto the screen.
He was partner and bishop.
He said just in.
The eyewitness known.
He's covering the Martinez and the two lies.
We'll have more dissails coming up at 5.30.
He pulled them from the stores.
So they sold 13.
Oh, they sold 13.
Oh, they sold 13.
Oh, they sold 13.
They cursed Parvatar.
Oh, they sold 13.
Oh, they sold 13.
Oh, they sold 13.
They cursed Parvatar.
I'll have heard the album.
And he was a Paul.
He said, thank you, Janet Reno.
I'm glad that you're called.
We got to take a stand.
I guess it's 13.
Ron, the side is really close to election.
His brother, Judge, friends that I will not fail y'all.
He'll send for any mention.
Oh, Janet, failed y'all.
They're selling six tickets going through to Turkey.
The two lies.
Yeah, they sold 13.
Oh, they sold 13.
Oh, they sold 13.
Oh, they sold 13.
They cursed Parvatar.
Oh, they sold 13.
Oh, they sold 13.
Oh, they sold 13.
They cursed Parvatar.
He kept rap a butt.
So he had guts.
So most of the people said, this guy is a butt.
He ripped on land a fat noise pollution.
Even though it went against the Constitution.
And what did he lose to?
Throw him all of his jobs?
So can thousands more copies?
At 12.95, people are brand new more fadies.
He's really perky-driven into the bank.
Because he sold 13.
Oh, they sold 13.
Oh, they sold 13.
Oh, they sold 13.
They cursed Parvatar.
Oh, they sold 13.
Oh, they sold 13.
Oh, they sold 13.
They cursed Parvatar.
Outstanding.
Thank you.
What is that?
Huh?
Who did that?
Me and my brother's here.
No.
Come on.
Where'd you get that?
Is it a record?
I borrowed it from Tanner.
Tanner, did that?
Yeah.
Yeah, see, I knew it wasn't from GTR because it's too good to be there stuff.
No GTRs, you know.
Mark Mosley did it, right?
GTR gives us out of the garbage.
Well, how come we don't have a copy of it here so we don't have to have you play it over the phone?
Well, because those scumbag can show there don't send you one.
They will.
They will.
They will.
In fact, Cox, that's, he owes us that for all these chronic calls that he makes on our show.
John Cox's name applies to what he is, huh?
Well, what can I say?
If the shoe fits were it.
Exactly.
Have a great day.
Thanks.
Excellent job.
That was great.
10.45.
But we'd like to have our own copy, Tanner.
Okay?
So we can play it loud and clear.
We'll give all the credit in the world to Mark Mosley and all the great people at Power 96.
I guess.
Anyway, there's an opening in day at 751.
W-I-O-D.
Yeah, I'd like to.
Can you?
You'd like to speak to Neil?
Neil Rogers.
Neil Rogers or Mr. Rogers?
Already Rogers.
Do you have your sneakers on, sir?
Hang on.
Let me lower my radio.
And your sweater?
Why is it up on the ceiling?
He's lowering his radio.
Oh, there it's on the floor now.
Hold on, I can't seem to catch it now.
Really?
How about the radio?
Hey, did you hear Alex show yesterday?
Yes, sir.
What a moron with that.
I'm going to block your call.
Yeah.
He's a chip off the old block.
I heard a saying.
He's a chip off the old block.
All you have to do is call the operator.
Listen, operator, let me say this to you, sir.
Let me say this, okay?
The audience has been brutal to this man.
Now you know that.
They're brutal, too?
Yeah.
Like, they had two brutus?
Yeah, eight two brutte.
Why is that?
Why?
Because he's terrible.
Did you call him 40 times yesterday?
No, I just had the pleasure of hearing people calling him
and telling him he sucks.
Oh, okay.
Do you like him?
Personally?
Yeah.
Personally, is that what you said?
Yeah, he's a good guy.
Yeah, I think he's a good guy.
He's just unfortunate.
Let me ask you something.
Let's change the subject, okay?
Peninsula or Panhandle?
Fry or Handle.
Okay.
Have a great weekend.
All right.
1046 at WIOD, we have an opening in Dade County, 751.
WIOD.
Yes, let me speak to Neil, please.
You want to speak to Neil?
Oh, Neil.
Who's this?
It is Rick.
I knew it.
I knew it.
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah.
Because we all love you madly, okay?
Some of us more than others.
But why do you sound so happy?
If I were you, I'd be a little psychotic unless you got some good news.
Oh, yeah.
You got good news?
Pretty good news.
What? It's not your baby?
Yeah, man.
No, it's not my baby.
How do you know?
No, she's not pregnant.
I told you.
You kids get so hysterical, but it should teach you a good lesson.
In fact, Rogers got some bags in the other room right now that would come in handy the next day.
They're a little big, but they're...
I'm sure you could handle it.
Thank God.
Next time.
I'm telling you, don't be messing around.
Get out those lepros condoms, man.
I guess so.
And try somebody legal age might be a good idea next time, you know?
Yeah, right.
Get through that breakfast this morning with.
How many guesses do I gillbert?
Yeah.
Oh, Rick, come on.
You're getting like Tim now.
You notice Tim's too embarrassed to call anymore?
No, we just have breakfast.
He paid for it and everything had a good time.
And is Tony listening right now?
I think so.
I mean, I like your brother.
Tony is a nice guy, but he invited himself to come in here.
And Tony weighs 490 pounds.
I don't want a big fat guy's in here.
We want you to come in.
Not Tony.
Don't take it personally.
It's a nice guy, but, you know, I can look at big fat ugly guys.
Are we going to have fat rich come in?
Or I can get a big mirror on the wall.
See, Tony, did you give Tony a little lecture on what this show is all about?
Yeah.
Has he understand now?
Uh-huh.
Okay, well, he won't be coming in there.
It'll be nervous.
I'm right.
But nothing to worry about, Tony.
Trust me.
Yeah, right.
Tell him, and he just got to put him in your core bit.
Yeah, that'll be something.
And you're talking to him.
He has an anchor.
He could be the anchor on the Queen Mary.
No, don't take it personally, Tony.
Come on.
But he used to be a big fat guy, huh?
Yep.
Why are you always so happy?
And I'll be side the fact that you work in a video store
and you just sit there watching all those triple X rated movies all day.
I don't know, because gosh, it's great.
This is a great life.
Right, right.
Yeah, I guess so.
I'm a very great life.
Get paid for watching Mimi Does Mimie Springs, I guess that's pretty good deal.
But anyway, what was it going to say before?
Oh, you used to weigh 210 pounds.
Yeah.
Anyway, how much is that about 140?
50?
Yeah, 150.
160?
Yeah.
And you're how tall?
63?
And that's a, so you're like Svelte.
Yep.
This guy used to weigh 210 pounds.
He used to be a big fat slob like his brother, Tony.
Yeah.
Don't take it personally, Tony.
But us fat people, we got to embarrass each other and lose in that weight.
So we can all be thin and beautiful like Rick.
Yeah, right.
Now Rose called in yesterday and she said she's ready.
She said she did?
She said she's ready.
She said does she admits it?
She's into young guys and she'd like to take you out for a little ice cream.
I'm telling I'm willing and I'm willing.
Ready willing and able.
Okay.
She said don't worry about it.
She's beyond that point.
Yep.
So what are you doing today?
What am I doing?
Yeah.
Well, I'm going to do a little show here and then I'm going to go with Tom Dennenberg.
You have a little lunch.
Uh-huh.
And then I'm going to go home and I'm going to, what I'm going to do, I'm going to go to Lionel Play World.
I'm going to buy a little toy boat and throw it over my fence into my neighbor's yard so they can have a boat in their yard that they always wanted.
I'm serious.
I'm going to attach a note to it.
And I'm going to say here's your boat.
Hope you're happy now.
To get poor gasoline all around it.
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that thing though about, they don't want me to have my satellite dish because they can't have their boats.
Like little children.
Oh my gosh.
Well, give them the boat then.
I'm giving them a boat.
Free.
Free.
I'm giving it to boat of them.
Well, Rick, I want to tell you now you coming in one day next week you're going to keep playing hard to get.
So to speak.
I'll come one day.
Have you ever looked at a map?
A map.
Of the state of Florida?
Now what would you say the state of Florida looks like on a map?
Can say.
Okay.
But you have a pretty good idea.
Yeah.
It rings a bell.
Yeah, it rings a bell.
Okay, so what is it Monday you're coming in?
Monday?
Yeah.
All right, I'll go in there for a couple hours.
Okay.
That's what you said Thursday too and you shine this that second day because your boss is a pinhead.
Okay.
Now we'd like to have you around here, Rick.
Just, you know, just to look at and kind of find a little bit.
Yeah, I'll go and I'll surprise you.
Okay.
You know, promises, promises.
Have a great weekend, Rick.
Yeah, one more thing.
You know what Gilbert was?
He was a guest host at the Long Randy Martin.
Oh, no.
Oh, Bill's going to have a relapse.
A relapse.
Oh, man.
Have a good one.
Yeah.
Give me a call, Rick.
Okay, no problem.
Breathe heavy on the phone.
Not now, little see ya.
10.51 at WIOD.
He's just...
10.55 at WIOD.
Look at that boy.
We're getting way behind her.
So, did anybody see the Larry King interview with Louis Ferrican last night?
That was the most embarrassing but looking interview I've ever seen in my life.
I got friend Louis Ferrican.
And no matter how much Ferrican lied, he just sat there like a statue.
Oh yeah, okay.
Okay.
The only interesting thing he said was...
Go on me 50 dollars.
Okay, here's a mobile in North Miami.
Hello.
Go on.
Oh boy, I love that sound.
Coral Springs.
Hey Neil.
On the Bokeh line.
I can't wait to get the bill for this one.
It's going to be a good one.
My not-slanding material is old.
It's used.
We might as well forget it.
Yeah.
But, uh...
No, I'm not in my opinion of, you know, the shape of the state of Florida.
If you really think about it, it's like the shape of a severely swollen hemorrhoid.
Yeah, that's true.
Yeah, it's pretty much the same with the people here too.
And it is, and the state does tend to be a pain in the ass.
Uh, definitely, but, uh...
No, I think, uh...
Let's see, as far as, uh...
Let me just throw a not-slanding thing to you.
I'm hoping that the disease that, uh...
Who is it, uh...
Ah!
Greg Sumner.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That he has patches on of a shell Phillips and a boob drop off.
Yeah.
Well, I think she's only got a sonon anyway.
Well, I tell you, but I didn't realize that was Michelle Phillips.
Yeah.
I had no idea.
Sure is.
Well, we like Michelle.
We got Michelle Lee.
Yeah.
Michelle Phillips, and, uh...
Maybe we'll have Michelle Gillin on it, and...
Okay, it could be.
Yeah, we're happy.
And in the tradition of, uh...
She could pay some on, because she don't have any.
Yeah, and in like Michelle Lee, like, can we write you letters?
And can we get pictures of you and your letters?
Don't need 50 dollars.
Hmm, interesting.
Thank you, Neil.
Have a great day.
1057 of Good Old WIOD.
It's a fabulous Friday.
God, what a great day to be alive.
If you could all be as happy as Rick in the video store,
life would be worth living, right?
I think there's something going on.
We don't know about.
Dear Field.
Yeah.
Uh, Neil, the big...
On the Broward line.
Isn't that interesting?
The big race tomorrow in Hurnie and Dale.
What's your opinion on, uh, Florida Derby tomorrow?
I don't have any opinion, because I haven't paid any attention to it,
and, uh, that's the name of that tune.
I will get the thing out though here, if it'll make you happy.
I mean, you got nine horses, so it's not like 12.
Yeah.
While I like the smaller fields,
would like two or three horses, then you got a chance.
Yeah.
Let's take a look here, what we got in the Florida Derby tomorrow, shall we?
Where the hell is it?
And I know you don't like Pat Day, and he's riding the favorite.
I hate Pat Day.
It makes me nauseous.
It makes me sick to my stomach.
Um, where the hell is it?
Where's the field for the Florida Derby?
On the front page.
Of the Sun Sentinel?
No, the Harold.
Oh, the Harold.
No wonder.
Oh, the sports.
Yeah, I would think so.
Uh, here's the business section.
No.
Here's the local section.
Here's the sports section.
Boy, this is quite a project.
Okay.
Um, Liptin, tennis.
Nobody cares about that.
Schulis says marinos going bye-bye, maybe.
Uh, here it is.
Oh, Ed the Pope.
The Pope.
It's Ross's warning.
No chance.
Sonny served.
Top snobbudgeri.
Bailey.
Bailey.
Unbridled with Pat Day is the Chalk Country Day with Valiente.
Rowanoke with Craig Perret.
Slavic.
I don't like that horse at all.
Single dawn with Lafitte Pink Eyes.
He's back riding.
He got injured, you know.
Yeah.
And run turn with Farraggo with the Rowanoke with the Craig Perret.
Rowanoke.
Yeah, just to be different.
Well, I got my bank book here and I'm going to take all my money out of my flagler federal today.
I'm going to put it on Rowanoke.
Excellent.
Okay.
Okay, good luck to you, sir.
Thanks a lot, Neil.
Just remember one thing.
What?
A fool and his money are soon parted.
Well, that's why I called you.
Good luck.
Bye-bye.
Okay, you'll need it.
Anyway, that's don't forget Derby Day.
The track opens at 9.30 tomorrow.
The gates in and the first race is early at noon because they've been on the track.
They've got the Florida Derby and all the festivities and the activities.
The big day of the year at Gulf Stream tomorrow is so get the whole family together and get out there.
Okay, and just, you know, like this guy, go to the bank today and take out your life savings and leave it all there tomorrow.
But you'll have a real good time.
Oh, look at that.
Aunt Rose is going to be on in the next hour.
That ought to be really fascinating.
We'll have a little time to kind of finish off the tale from yesterday.
So to speak, Henry Barrow's got the 11 o'clock WIOD news.
And then we'll come back.
Maybe Henry could be the PA announcer at Miracle Baseball.
They'll let him in that stadium anyway.
We'll come back at 11.05.
Alex Bennett would just tons of guests to this afternoon.
Sports talk and Stan Major from 8 to 11.

The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station.
Now, here's Neal Rogers on New Stock Radio 610 WIOD.
I have no life.
My name is Barry.
Sing like a fairy.
I write bad songs about romance.
While I'm wearing standard pants, I'm trying to shrink it.
My songs are with me.
I had a series of big hits.
But that was back in 76.
Now no one wants to hear.
They only laugh and steer.
They won't admit that they own my albums.
But my songs are queer.
Got a nose game.
Like a banana.
My two fans both live in my tenor.
Got a nose game.
Like a banana.
Of my notes you could fit half on the city of Atlanta.
I write the song.
Like a banana.
I've got a hunker.
The size of younger.
When I get a stuffed up nose, I be sad in a hoax.
But now I'm on the cake.
My life is back in place.
And so I'm singing again and sticky.
My snows in your face got a nose shape.
Like a banana.
My two fans both live in my tenor.
Got a nose shape.
Like a banana.
Of my notes you could fit half on the city of Atlanta.
I write the song.
Like a banana.
Like a banana.
Like a banana.
Like a banana.
Okay it's 1107 at WYOD and Aunt Rose is on the line.
I love that thing.
Hi.
How you doing?
Okay I know why Rick is so happy.
And why is that?
Well I can't blow any...
Something we can talk about.
No I can't blow any secrets.
I'm not touching at like this.
Just a joke.
I just like joking.
Okay.
Now where did we leave off yesterday?
You called at the end of the show.
We ran out of time.
Hold on a second Rose.
WYOD.
Yeah I'm on a car phone.
Oh jeez.
Hold on one second okay?
Good thing.
One second.
This guy says he's on a car phone Rose.
What do you think?
No problem.
Well if he is go right ahead.
Okay you sure?
Sure.
You're not going to be...
No I'm not under pressure anymore.
Good.
Oh really?
Hold on.
I guess she's free.
How you doing now?
Okay.
I'm calling from Bordam Beach.
From Bordam Beach?
Yeah.
I guess everyone else called this pointin beach.
What?
A horrible place.
A horrible place.
A horrible place.
If you want to boat in your yard move to Boynton Beach.
Yeah there it is.
Then you can have ducks in your yard and pick up trucks and shotguns and black cats.
I'm embarrassed.
Bumpin' that lady after that line.
That was a pretty good line.
Yeah.
Not bad.
Well listen she's been hanging out with that young stuff.
You know look out.
What can we say?
Anyhow.
I just call to say hello and see how things were going.
But let me get that lady back on.
She's down to real interest and I really have no material.
Okay.
Well you're a hell of a guy.
Have a good weekend.
Thank you.
Okay.
See wasn't that nice?
What a guy.
Yeah.
And if you're used by your material, it's easy to please.
Oh I'm telling you.
I think the state of Florida looks like a gun.
What do you think?
A little bit of a gun with a shorthand?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Okay.
Well there's always been something phallic about a gun.
All those national rifle association people.
You know all those guys that have to have their gun in their hand.
Yeah.
That's what I was for.
Something very, very deeply psychological about that.
Freud would be embarrassed.
Yes.
Deep citizenship functional feeling.
No.
The thing is, Jane Polly had an interview a show called Jane.
Why do you think they call it a sick shooter?
Rose.
Go ahead.
I don't know.
Uh-uh.
It was called changes.
Okay.
And they had one lady.
You work with the Camille House and I'm sure you appreciate this.
They talk about the changes of how people...
What changes...
What changes they go through, what they do with their lives.
And if...
Couple, they had...
They were very well off.
And they had a daughter that she grew up and they were happy but something seemed to be missing in their lives.
And what they did was...
Oh, the lady worked...
I'm sorry.
The lady works at an interior decorating place.
And she saw that these people were coming in and they had...
These ladies were losing sleep over what wallpaper do you use?
And like a flash, it came to her.
She said, those people out on the street losing sleep because they have nothing over their head.
And in other words, they just kind of stopped it all in and opened the shelters and were boyzies or something like that.
But what I needed to say was that there was quite a bit of positive and you know there have to be, you know, with the Camille House and stuff like that.
And I just...
I can't stand the festival that we're in but you know I have to look for the good.
Oh, this...
So philosophically...
I just needed to say that it really moved me.
It moved you?
It did. I wish you could have seen it. I think you would have appreciated it.
I'm sure would have.
What the two people were doing for these people up in Idaho.
You were just very nice.
Well, you got to understand the whole world's an insane asylum. I mean, you don't understand.
I know. And that's why I need to look for all that truth.
I mean, people are sleeping on the streets and I have neighbors who are worried that they can't have a boat in their room.
That's what the world has come to.
I know. That's why I wanted to not share this with you but tell you about that.
I needed to tell you about that.
And that's about it. And I just want to give it a positive note because there's so much negative and I just want to say something happy.
Well, wasn't that great?
Well, I hope so.
Well, Rick said...
I'll think of something better later.
Rick said, love and kisses.
Oh, and smoochies and smoochies.
Exactly.
Okay. He said he's ready.
No, you said I was ready.
Well, he said he's ready.
I guess everybody's ready, Rose.
We're all ready.
Have a great weekend.
You too. Bye.
Bye.
Wow. 12 minutes past 11 at WIOD.
We have an opening in Dade County.
Seven...
WIOD.
Hi.
Hi.
How you doing?
Okay.
Great.
Do you want to hold?
Sure.
Okay. Why are you so happy?
I don't know. I just am.
I'm just the first time that I've ever called and you've picked right up.
This is just amazing.
Great. Well, hold on.
I'll make your way to WIOD and you come back to Err...
I'll inspect the good old days.
Okay.
Let's go.
It's coming across the time my pass is off to the top of the key taken by Julius.
He drives the stop.
Oh, I want to electrify one in it.
Windmill's there.
Windmill's there.
Hi.
This is the doctor.
And when I'm on a fast break from the usual breakfast routine, there's only one place for me.
Slam, dunk it, don't knock.
Check out the All Star lineup.
They got Dale Dawkins, Chocolate Thunder, Donuts, Wheels, Chamberlain, Finger Rolls, and even Moses Malone.
What had it jammed, feel, donut?
Mmm-mmm-mmm.
Hey, Doc. How about a box and one to go?
Yeah, baby.
And give me a cup of coffee.
My one.
Medium one.
A Lodge of wine.
A Lodge of wine.
But no Korean, please.
Oh, that's bad.
So make your best move to slam, dunking, donut.
We stub off food in your face.
Okay, 1117 at WIOD and let's...
Oh, I know what it was, the soda.
Very simple.
Do you think that the Sherols got sodas and her thing?
See if there's anything in Sherols thing up there.
North Miami Beach.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yeah.
Hey, I've been holding over an hour.
Oh, wait a minute.
I wasn't going to do that other guy first.
Oh, you can't leave me holding any more.
All right, just a second.
Just a second.
You don't mind, do you?
No, not at all.
And you just called it anyway, right?
This is...
I'm still not over yet, so please.
Yeah, so what the hell do you want?
Okay, hold on.
Okay, he's the wait.
And he just called.
Oh, hey, Neil.
I've been holding since at least an hour.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, I must be getting a kind of black and blue by now, huh?
Hey, well...
The phone, I mean.
I'm your listener from BCC.
Great, you're the only one we got left.
Yeah, my name is Larry, by the way.
Well, that's good, Larry.
Everybody wants to be a big celebrity in a superstar and now you're a writ.
Oh, thanks.
You're writ, Larry.
Well, I just wanted to say, I, you know, I've been holding an hour.
I haven't even done what you say.
Yeah.
Well, that's why we didn't get to you.
We knew you didn't have anything to show here from BCC.
What do you made you're in shop?
I don't know.
Oh, oh, you're just hanging out there.
Yeah.
Like most of those kids.
What do people take at BCC?
Like wind surfing and basket weaving?
Window washing.
Shop?
Yeah.
Do you know kids who took shop in high school?
Yeah, I was one of them.
Did you?
Yeah, and I'm Jewish, can you believe that?
Oh, no.
Here's a Jewish kid who took shop.
Thank you, Marvin, in high school.
Oh, God.
Oh, you are really a reject from the human race.
No, seriously, a lot of kids are not too bright
and they're going to be, but they are mechanically inclined.
And they take shop.
There's nothing wrong with that.
And then all the rest of us kids used to like line up and laugh at them.
Oh, look at that. He's doing wood weaving and woodworking and...
And cross building.
Well, somebody's got to do that manual stuff, okay?
But, geez, Jews doing manual labor, Larry.
What kind of stuff is that?
I don't know.
Boy.
Well, you know what the penance looks like?
Well, be careful now.
Okay.
What is it?
It looks like we're urinating on Cuba.
Well, there are a lot of people who'd be happy to do that as long as they're illiterate.
Well, just wanted to pass that along.
I'll bet.
Well, listen, Larry, you've been quite a caller now.
I want you to do a little assignment next week, okay?
Because back in the Zaytadays, we were really hot at BCC.
But we had everybody.
We had... we had them all.
Well, I'm on spring break this week and there's absolutely nothing to do.
Oh, really?
Oh, is everybody on break this week?
From BCC.
Let's see, it's March 16th.
Yeah, they're all up in Daytona and in Mexico.
Right.
And in Texas and all other kind of places, but not here.
Nothing to do except to go through shuffleboard.
Yeah.
Well, you'd probably be good at that.
You're mechanically inclined.
You could get that little thing right whereup along.
So, you know what I mean, Larry?
I know.
Catch my drift.
Well, listen, have a great weekend and when...
No, when does school go back again?
This Monday, I was off this whole week.
All right, your assignment is to scour up other Nileys at BCC.
That just... maybe you can get some of them to call in.
I'll let you know next week.
I don't think you'll have...
I don't think you'll have much success, but give it a shot.
Okay.
Well, don't lose it, Neil.
Well, and the same to you.
Okay.
Take care.
See you.
Well, look at that.
Somebody who takes shop who closes the call by saying,
Zagazone, how do you like that?
What the hell is this world coming to anyway, huh?
And that Yitzhak Shamir?
I don't like... he's a little puny guy.
I don't like him anyway.
He's got a crappy attitude, you know?
Sometimes I feel...
Sometimes I feel...
I feel...
Anyway, let's look at the guest list for the Alex Bennett Show.
But I tell you what, I want to see a tremendous studio audience in here.
It's Friday.
We got all the college kids who are out on break.
Most of them haven't got a damn thing to do because there's nobody in town.
You notice the season never happened here this year.
The only thing we got was traffic, but no business.
Everybody tells me that.
Where's the season?
When is it starting?
I hate to break the news to you, but it never showed up.
Anyway, film critic Mike Snyder, a Sean O'Connor for St. Patty's Day
and the lookalikes, whatever that is,
and then Comic-Con, Kevin Meeney,
the rock band Nuclear Valdez, and many more guestises.
How many more guests can there be?
So let's have a gigantic tumultuous, overflowing studio audience
for the Alex Bennett Show today.
Come on down and just hang out, okay?
Let's get the season, tough to fire your feet.
This is the Neorajer Show.
Whoo!
It's...
This is the Joy Reynolds Show.
Any questions?
Who did that?
Oh, good idea, but the execution isn't...
Like they said with Ted Bundy, the execution isn't quite there.
Anyway, we have it opening in Broward at 524WID.
That's an at line 6 where somebody just got cut off.
Kendall!
Nail.
Yeah.
How you doing?
Okay.
That's really cool.
I'll just say it for the OV burrito surprise with beans.
Great, or with beans?
You know what that means?
Yeah, I do know what that means.
Okay.
27 after 11 at WIOD.
Let's go to beautiful Pompo-no, hello.
Nail.
Yes.
Little me $50.
Come on.
Okay.
Here with it.
I'm a little larger from England.
Your mother, I bet she's a hell of a cook, huh?
Oh, she's...
Oh yeah, if it has tasted, it means that somebody made a mistake.
Don't be such a loud.
You got it.
Listen, she says you're rude and you'd be thrown off for any one five minutes.
That's not rude.
We'll call you a douchebag.
Yeah.
Her name is Connie.
Would you do it for me?
She is a douchebag.
Connie, the worst.
Thank you.
Plus you couldn't cook a bean.
You know, pot.
The only thing she makes any good is your chip pudding.
Oh yeah.
I have no comment on that.
Yes.
And listen, I was in the bathroom before taking a shower.
Yeah.
I looked down and I saw the state of Florida.
I believe it.
Okay.
Just a member of Panhandle.
Panhandle, right?
See you later.
Could you give me a favor?
Yes.
If you get a chance, would you play that Donald Trump song?
Oh sure.
Okay.
Yeah, it takes up two minutes.
Okay.
See ya.
Thanks for that.
Oh yeah, we'll play that.
Anything that's long.
Like the state of Florida.
It's 28 after 11 at WIOD.
That was Pompano.
Let's go to plantation.
11, 28 with Ron Sageon.
Hey, why are you on your music?
Where the fist for if it continues?
This guy with a grassroots man.
Let's play the whole thing.
What is that?
Oh, it's Gary's birthday.
It's not great.
Okay.
Okay.
I know.
Okay.
Let's put Ron Sageon on a hold there for just a second.
He's on your music way.
A1A.
Uh, I know.
Hello, I'm a lady on the sixth in Miami on the Broward Line getting very confusing.
Hello.
Hello, is this Neil?
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah, listen, I have a story to tell.
I was in New York on the eighth last week.
You were in New York?
Yeah.
And I was in the audience on the Phil Donahue show.
And they had as their guest and as their topic, two live crew.
And they performed their song.
Yeah.
And I don't think that the songs were edited at least at the time or in any way.
And they had a panel discussion.
Okay.
And they mentioned Martinez and they mentioned the situation in Broward.
And I called Channel 10 when I got back and said, when are you going to, you know, basically, when are you going to air the show?
You know, I called him this morning because it hadn't been aired in Miami because I've been watching every day.
Yeah.
And Channel 10 told me, normally they air the following day, which would have been last Friday.
So I'm sitting here saying, what's going on?
Why aren't they airing this show in Miami?
And they're not giving you a reason?
No, they told me to call back on Monday and see whether, you know, it was going to be scheduled for next week.
So it sounds pretty evasive to me.
That was a little fishy, doesn't it?
Yeah.
So I just thought I'd call and tell my story and see if anybody knows anything about it.
I don't get it.
You think that they'd want to have that on its local timely?
I know.
And I don't know what the problem is.
The only thing that I can think of is, I mean, the lyrics to the song were rather, let's say, we're going to...
Well, there's no way that they would let it go.
Anything that was risque would be dumped anyway because it's, you know, on tape.
Yeah.
We'll see.
When I heard it live, tape during the taping, I said to myself, I can't believe they're going to put this over there.
They're not.
But then I thought maybe they're going to believe it.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, dump it.
But there's, you know, so I don't know if the show's been aired all over the country and just not in Miami.
Or I don't know what the situation is.
Well, I saw a promo for it on maybe it was on my satellite.
I don't know what channel I was watching.
I did not see the show, but I saw a promo.
So it sure aired someplace.
Yeah.
So I don't know what's going on.
Well, we'll find out.
We'll get to the bottom of it.
Where are you really?
Even if we have to jump into Anbishop's truck.
We'll find out.
I would appreciate it.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
Bye.
It's 11.32 at WIO Dean.
We have it opening in Broward.
If you move very fast now, 524, Judge Grossman, 524, WIOD.
How you doing, is this Marvin?
Yeah.
How you doing, Marvin?
Let's see.
It's who?
Ken.
Oh, Ken.
How you doing?
Ken O.
Ken Hall.
Oh.
I sat in there with you one time.
Okay.
Terry Mariamann's by report.
Okay.
Hold on, Ken.
Okay.
Let's leave him on hold for a long time.
Plantation?
Yes.
It's 11.30 at WIO.
Holy crap.
We're going to stay quain.
A1A with Ron C.
Yeah.
Come on, Ron.
You can do the talk up.
Boys 9-0, man.
He's going to reach your record.
He runs those nut to a muscle in there.
He knows to let the old pro handle all the talk ups.
Don't step on it.
I'm all the world man.
You know, digging, you'll be dead.
You'll be dead.
One thing about Ron St. John.
He's into the guest who, big time, isn't he?
11.30 at WIO.
D's got good taste.
Miami.
Hello.
Hey there.
How you doing?
Oh, you're still there, right?
Yes, I am.
Boy.
But I've got a couple things to concede.
You have a couple things?
Well, that's good.
That's a good start.
My first thing is shape like Florida.
Yes.
Along the lines of that Donnie who, lady, who called.
I think some of these right wing fundamentalist types need to keep an eye on other things than
the radio and TV.
I work for an international parcel delivery company.
The initials are PUS but not necessarily in that order.
Hmm.
And I see you.
Yes.
Well, that's appetizing right before lunch at school.
Well, anyway.
Who is that?
Is that Val's child that you got there?
That's mine.
Oh.
Screaming has had off.
Anyway, I received numerous packages from questionable companies.
Actually going to questionable companies, they have somewhat explicit suggestive names.
And every now and then I can call you and let you in on one of them.
Today, one of them I noticed was called, KO For Men.
I don't know.
Make what you want of it.
No, that's alligator tail.
I guess so.
Yeah, that's frozen, go make a scene.
They get lots of packages.
Let me tell you.
Huh.
So what's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that?
Well, hey, what's wrong with the little tail going on here and look at these people losing their minds?
Well, listen, you can't, you can't, you can't, oh, just relax.
Okay, you can't deal with those people.
They're immovable and intractable and they'll kill you with their kindness and they got all the answers.
The only problem in the countries that all the other people are like laying down and sleeping.
That's the problem.
They've all gone into a coma, all our great liberal and moderate friends and all these people are having a field day.
That's what I mean.
Yeah.
That's just a modest proposal to keep an eye on the mail system as ridiculous as possible.
We're going to even have to start censoring the cartoons on Sunday morning.
Exactly.
You know, you can't keep control over everything.
Tony Dow is upset because they want to censor the reruns of leave it to beaver.
They think it has a suggested title, yeah.
Leave it to the other hand.
The other thing is you're complaining about a week or so ago about no advertising and it's true.
I don't see any advertising for your show.
No, no, wait a minute.
Let's clarify.
There's a lot of advertising on the show.
You mean no promotion?
No, this doesn't promote anything except the morning show.
Right.
There's hardly any promotion for the neorodges program.
No, I don't say that out of peak toward Mike because Mike and I get along great and he does a good job and all of that.
But you know, they only promote one show which is kind of bizarre.
Right.
Well, if you're getting with the little amount of promotion that you're getting, this could upset you.
So, power 96.
I saw a Metro bus advertising for Kramer, the midday man, the other day.
Oh.
I know.
It was kind of a...
Oh.
Yeah.
You would have thought they would have taken care of that.
That is tacky.
Well, listen, now that you've revealed that, they really got to give me one of those records.
That is, horrendous grotesque.
Anyway.
Okay.
Well, listen, you really got me a depress now.
Have a great weekend.
You too.
See ya.
Yes.
6, 10, 12, 5, 6, 10.
Just you by your peak.
Mmm.
Trump, the monster ego, lived like a king and trollicked with some new biolchicks and had himself a fleeing.
Little wife, Viva, no.
Sood that a rascal, Trump.
And soothed the house and 20 mill and other fancy stuff.
Oh, together they would shut her.
Buying anything for sale.
Viva, no, kept a look out, purged while Trump went out for sale.
Starlit spam sendin' bows would bow when air he came.
I rate Pimps would lower their price when Trump roared out his name.
Oh, Trump, the monster ego, lived like a king and trollicked with some new biolchicks and had himself a fleeing.
Then one night it happened, all the papers gave the score.
Trump's game was a doldery to Viva and her disment war.
Castles and casinos, Trump would all retain.
Porri Viva and her got the shaft, pre-knuffed shows made it plain.
Without his lifelong friend, his marriage on the shelf.
Then Trump's that monster ego gladly made love to himself.
Oh, Trump, the monster ego, lived like a king and trollicked with some new biolchicks and had himself a fleeing.
Trump, the monster ego, lived like a king and trollicked with some new biolchicks and had himself a fleeing.
11.41 at WIOND, we have an opening in date, county, I can't believe it, 751.
Trump, 751, WIOND, what do you think, Ron?
11.43 at A1A, and a new district.
Ron, Ron, Ron.
11.42.
Ron. He left me in an untenable position there, Ron.
Don't ever do that again, okay? WIOND.
I stepped all over the Buckingham, sure.
Excuse me?
Don't worry about it, just try to keep up with this.
All right.
What's going on?
Yeah, Neil said to Kalka, anybody that took shop?
This is Neil.
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.
It is?
Trust me.
Would I kid you?
Well, yes, you would, actually.
Would I yank your chain?
Well.
Possible.
So anyway, you took shop?
Yeah.
So what's wrong with that?
Well, I'm asking you.
I don't think anything's wrong with it.
I think you have to stand up and be a man, right?
Well, yeah, I guess so.
What do you do for a living?
I'm going to school.
Oh, you go to school?
Yeah.
So what's wrong with that?
I'm in high school.
Well, you're in high school.
Yeah.
You're out of school today?
No, I just came home for lunch.
Oh, good.
Yeah.
Just I had a catch you on the radio.
Well, that's good.
That's an excellent lunch hour to listen to this show, right?
I'm one of the very few.
Now, how do you know that?
Why do you tell your friends you listen and they make faces
and they tell you your number one and stuff like that?
Oh, no.
It's just that in my school, you know, it's a lot of power.
I need to take care of that.
Yeah, all that crap, man.
It's enough to pollute your brain, right?
Yeah.
Who needs that garbage?
Yeah.
Well.
Well, that's good taking shop.
You don't have a lot of pressure, right?
Well, just everybody likes to, you know.
Just two projects and all that kind of good stuff.
Yeah.
It's not so bad to me to tell you.
Yeah.
Kind of work on cars?
Yeah, I get to work on cars and all that.
Learn how to hot rod cars, steal a few forrari's and stuff like that.
You can be retired by the time you're 25.
Actually, Mercedes, but you're...
Oh, there you go.
That's not bad.
It's okay.
You know where to sell them, huh?
Yeah.
All of a sudden have a wonderful day and a great week.
What's good?
What's good to go to?
Well, self-manmy senior high.
Oh, outstanding.
All right.
It is.
Okay, me.
One of the all-time greats.
Yeah.
Say hi to all my pal over there, okay?
All right.
Have a good one.
Okay.
Five.
How do you like that?
1143 at WIOD, the home of the free and the land of the grave.
And that's where we are folks.
It's dead town.
There's spring break going on in Daytona.
But we have the senior break here.
They're all out there with their metamuse soul and their walkers
and their kale pectate and their sweet and low.
And they're all making life miserable for everybody else.
That's Florida ladies and gentlemen.
Look at the map.
It's shaped like a big phallic thing.
And if you live here, you get a giant screwing at no extra charge.
See, that's why Alex came here.
Is he heard that and he didn't understand what they were talking about?
It's 16-till new in the WIOD, right, Ron?
Yeah, they've got it right on the one hand.
You're music way.
11-4-E, Jack.
Today I'll hear his cutting of branches.
Oh, from spring break.
Okay, all those kids who are out there at Fort Lauderdale.
Close your eyes and pretend.
Oh, this is great.
See, Ron, let's me do the talk-up.
That's what I really appreciate.
Ricky Tiki would never do that.
He'd have to do the talk-up himself.
It's 16-till noon.
And let's go...
Remember where the boys are for Lauderdale in 1956?
Spring break, people living and breathing.
Just a few years ago, I remember.
Just wall-to-wall people all out of the age of 100.
I don't know if you're going to have a good time.
You know, a little crazy, but what the hell?
We don't want that here.
We want senior break.
We want to have them out there in their little golf shorts
and their caps in the South Florida uniform
with their blue hair flowing out from underneath.
Let's go to West Palm Beach, shall we?
Uh-huh.
Neil, did you listen to...
Is this a call from Cemetery Village?
Oh, it's almost time for the Maasjog tournament.
It's Faldi.
Don't miss out.
Do you remember...
Did you listen to Alexio yesterday about three o'clock
the guy that laid into the bird, calls him up?
I mentioned that before.
I'm way ahead of you.
I even played the card.
I hate the bird, yeah.
No, that was great.
You could recognize that voice anywhere, couldn't you?
Listen, how come we never see Peggy Lewis
and Manuel Noria get the same time?
Well, that's a good question.
The same reason you never see Ann Bishop
and I'm trying to think of a good one here.
Martina and Avartel over together.
Well, listen, I want to call my friend Tim and Nugget
and Kenny DiAtolla and my wife, Len, I'll do special.
Okay, thank you.
See ya.
It's 1146 here at WIO Dean
and we have it opening in Palm Beach at 655-9463.
655-WIOD.
Here's a lady in Miami.
Hi, Neil.
How are you?
I'm fine.
Guess what I've got.
This is a lady?
This is Ms. Globettelli.
Oh!
Hi, Neil.
Oh, you're sure putting on a good voice for today.
Oh, I have lots of them.
Do you?
Yeah, I'm about 10 of your callers.
Come on.
Sometimes I think there are only about three callers out there
and just do voices.
You know, they do stick.
Oh, I did me West once.
Did you?
Yeah.
Well, how was it?
Well, don't tell us, don't tell us.
It was pretty good.
Let everybody fantasize.
Okay, well, guess what I taped yesterday.
I'm afraid to ask.
I taped the conversation between Alex
and that guy that did the bird call.
Oh, do you have it?
I have it.
Great.
Would you like to hear it?
Oh, I'd love it.
Okay.
Hold on.
Keep in mind who this is now.
Okay, yeah.
No, he does.
He does.
Really, he does.
How many of you think I suck more than Steve?
Yeah.
How many of you think I suck less than Steve?
Let's look at the suck meter right now here.
Steve Kane was entertaining.
Here's his entertaining, them boring, his tail.
Intertaining, boring, his tail.
Hey, you're not going to have to put up with me much longer.
Well, that's what my call was about.
That is why I'm calling.
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
I'm going back to San Francisco.
You're kidding.
Why'd you come?
Or why did you come?
I was, I find it very enjoyable.
Okay?
No, but why did you bring yourself down here?
Because I assumed that there was an intelligent population down here,
ready to be given high quality radio entertainment.
Oh, come on.
I was sadly mistaken.
So you're running back home?
And when I'm gone, you know, who's replacing me?
I'm just figuring it out now.
Kane, all right.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Sorry, you're not that lucky.
It's going to be a, they're going to put a team in here.
Dick Farrell and Joey Reynolds.
What about Gilbert?
Huh?
What about Gilbert?
Gilbert?
No, Gilbert is not a radio personality.
Oh, well, I don't know.
He's sort of entertaining.
You're really running away?
Well, me, I say.
Oh, now he's really running away.
Well, I mean, you come down here a few people call and say,
you stuck, so you run home.
I mean, that just causes commotion.
That's what, you know, you're supposed to do.
That's what, you know, I mean, the more commotion,
the better your ratings, you know,
I mean, why haven't I listened to you all during my career?
No, when I needed you to make it big.
Well, I can help you.
I can help you.
Yeah.
He's the one.
What did he say that being a Cayman and then he'd suck?
Well, I think it's because people like you calling
over the flip times.
Sorry.
You're a sweetheart.
Yeah.
Where'd she come from?
She's from San Francisco.
Can't you tell?
Yeah, go on back there.
She is going back here.
I thought you said she was funny.
Is this who is this?
Gary.
No, this is Boris.
Boris.
Yes, this is Boris.
Is it Boris?
Call me what you like.
I mean, can we, can we, can we like block his call?
No, we can never call the station again.
Why would you want to do that?
I think we'll do that.
Let's do it.
Why would you want to do that?
This block is called.
I mean, not that I...
Do I suck?
Not that I...
Do I want to haul this again?
You can get out of this.
We can either block your call or you can tell me I don't suck.
Okay, honestly, you suck.
Okay, block his call.
Block his call.
He's blocked me.
I don't have a block.
I have to lie.
I have to live with myself.
Okay, excellent job, Gary.
It's 1149 at WIOD.
We have an opening in Dade County where Guava Jelly just hung up.
751-946-3751-WIOD.
Hey, one, hey, I've got a dedication from Mayor Fort Lauderdale.
Remember this Mayor Cox?
Oh, right here on the best there's no question about it.
Okay, more big hits from Rods A. John and just a minute or two.
But I wish he'd fix his watch.
Okay, if you're Gary Hart, a big price you'll pay it with women you play.
Not once, it was twice.
You were caught with Miss Rice.
You're really not too smart.
If you can't stay apart, now you won't be president.
Gary Hart.
You won't be the president.
No, Gary Hart.
What a rendition.
That guy ought to be on the Alex Bennett's ocean, didn't he?
With Eric Flambert and Larry Brendler.
It's 1155 at WIOD.
Here's a mobile on I-95.
Hey, Neil.
Yeah.
Let me tell you where I'm heading up to Ocean City, Maryland.
All right.
How depressing.
Martin.
What are you going to do up there?
Well, I'm going to go up there and get my apartment for the summer.
I live up there all summer long.
Well, I don't blame you, sir.
I'll say it's fantastic.
But what am I going to do for the next week and a half without you?
I mean, I don't know how to survive.
Well, what, you're on I-95?
Yeah.
I'll catch you up to you.
Give me some suggestions.
Just put on your headlights.
I'll catch you up to you.
Okay.
Hey, can you do me a favor?
Yeah.
Look at that Santa Claus Elvis thing about heating all the time.
Oh, man.
I know it's that the thing.
Oh, man.
I mean, I just played Gary Hart, which is a little outdata, but it still has a message.
Elvis Claus, you mean?
Oh, and it's what?
Are you there?
Boy, he's got the crampiest mobile phone.
Well, sir.
Oh, like here.
Like very much.
As there is the king.
I don't have him in around much.
For a while.
But I want y'all to know what up here in Rock and Roll Heaven.
I'll do a thinking of you.
But it's Christmas.
And I have to give y'all a special Christmas message.
A message of peace.
Like, how about a little piece of that pie going by?
Thank you.
I got it right.
A block of a slam.
Christmas is a time of hoot.
A time of joy.
A time of eleven.
And I sure would love him.
Take slides.
That feature you got there.
Like it.
Oh, we're lost.
No, we're lost.
Oh, yeah, Christmas.
Christmas to me means family.
Family means friends.
The friends means getting together.
And getting together means eating.
I'll pass me that drum to take.
Which please?
I'll flake you.
I'll give you one more.
Now, just a little slater here right now.
You know, I'm maybe a big star.
Maybe too big.
But ain't nobody so big.
You can't reach out a helping hand.
A helping hand.
Would you hand me a helping of those mashed potatoes over there?
Which I believe?
Like it.
Like it.
Like I was trying to.
Ain't nobody so big.
You can't stoop to help a friend of neat over the holiday season.
Speaking of season, you won't pass me that self-sugger when you get the chance.
Like it.
Yeah.
Just don't screw the cover.
That's right.
Like it.
I got one more.
So this Christmas, why don't y'all take a tip from old A.O.
No, no, leave those stick tips right where they are.
You know what I mean?
No, I appreciate it.
I want you to remember, we're all part of God's great big family.
You know God made man into his own image.
And look at the mirror.
I'd have to say God must be a big, big son of a gun.
You know what I mean?
I like you dear.
But I especially want y'all to remember this one last thing.
When y'all is homeless Christmas, springing that popcorn up on the tree.
Save a big, big bowl for the can.
Next to butter, no more money.
I like you dear.
I like you.
I like you.
