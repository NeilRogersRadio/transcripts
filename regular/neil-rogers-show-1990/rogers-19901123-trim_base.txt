From the twisted minds who brought you Halloween comes an entirely new dimension in horror.
Don't look in the oven or you'll experience the stock naked terror that is.
Thanks, Kiwi.
A family just like yours eats a bird that was once alive.
More stuffing, Thomas.
And they eat until they feel like they're going to explode.
But it doesn't stop there.
Uncle Luther.
Now it's time to entertain the inlaw.
Is that fish I smell or the dog?
I'm a lazy kid now.
And you'll think they're never going to leave.
So where do I put these suitcases?
And just when you thought you could escape by watching TV, you'd discover there is no way out.
Now game number two of our holiday NFL quadruple header.
Thanks, Kiwi.
The annual terror is back.
Class data griddle am?
Oh.
So playing in a dining room near you.
Wow.
Oh, hi here.
Thank you very much.
As here is the king.
I don't have them around for a while.
But I want y'all to know what up here in Rock n' Roll Heaven.
I'll do the thinking of you.
This Christmas.
And I have to give y'all a special Christmas message.
A message of peace.
Like, how about a little piece of that bag, old boy?
Like it.
I got it.
A lock of a slam.
Christmas is a time of joy.
What time for a living?
And I sure would love it.
It takes lots of that feature you got there.
Like it.
What, we're more.
We're more, we're more.
Oh yeah, Christmas.
Christmas to me means family.
Your family means friends.
Your friends means getting together.
And getting together means eating.
I'll pass you that tone to take.
Which please?
Well, flaky.
I'll get my voice.
Now just one slate of you right now.
You know I may be a big star.
Maybe too big.
But ain't nobody so big.
You can't reach out a helping hand.
Better a helping hand.
Well, would you hand me a helping of those
my data's over there?
Which I believe?
It's like it.
Make a remark.
Now I will slam.
Ain't nobody so big.
You can't stoop to help a friend of neat
over the holiday season.
Speaking of season, you won't pass me that soft sugar.
When you get the chance.
Like it.
Yeah, just, just those screws of color.
That's right.
Like it.
I got one more.
So this Christmas, why don't y'all take a tip from old?
Hell, it's not all.
Leave those steak tips right where they are.
You know what I mean?
You know, I appreciate it, flaky.
I want you to remember, we're all part of God's great big family.
And you know God made man into his own image.
And look in the mirror.
I'd have to say God must be a big, big son of a gun.
You know what I mean?
I think he did.
But I especially want y'all to remember this one last thing.
When y'all this home of Christmas stringing that popcorn up
on the tree, save a big, big bowl for the can.
Extra butter to what I mean.
I like your deer.
I like you.
I like your muck.
Okay, the word is out.
He's a reporter for Channel 6.
Have you ever seen Elvis and Dave game together?
Son of a-
Son of a-
Hello.
You mean our first caller is already gone?
Okay, nice talking to you.
Another one.
Another refugee from Thanksgiving Day who overdid it.
Let's try Kendall.
Gobble, gobble, be y'all.
Okay.
Miami.
Neil.
Yeah.
I need a favor from you.
I'm a high school student.
I wonder if you could play that better that you had about Miami Bice.
Because I need to like a song thing I want to go along with.
I want to use it.
You think you could play for me?
You want to what?
I want to use that little bit that you had about Miami Bice.
Use it for what?
You want to plagiarize it?
Steel it and play it on like Piper high radio is that it?
More or less.
What bit?
Down Johnson.
Down Johnson.
Which one?
Which one?
Hellendale vice?
Right.
Hellendale vice.
Well that's what you got to say.
We've only got 3,000 carts in here.
Okay, I'm sorry.
No problem.
Don't get defensive.
It's in the machine, sir.
Do we deliver or what?
Hello?
We're like dominoes.
We deliver.
You got it?
Yeah.
Have a great day, pal.
Boy, I thought I was out of it.
Now I know what it's going to be like today, huh?
How do you like that start?
That's what it takes to wake me up.
Boy, I haven't heard a couple of calls like that in a long time since the Alice Benucho.
Let's talk about all those laser discs, huh?
With the blah, blah.
Have a great day, Roger.
Up yours, okay?
Yeah.
Have a great weekend.
He's looking to his watch saying, well, we're getting out of here real quick, huh?
Guess what?
We got a special ball game we're putting on.
Nobody knows about it.
It starts in 20 minutes.
We're just going to make one up.
Anyway.
There are two Miami cops with a hot newbie.
They're on the street, fighting crime.
Hey pops, that's a handicap face, sir.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
In Allendale, Vice.
We get a problem.
The grey gang is up to the early tricks.
Lieutenant, isn't that the group of senior citizens who went around trying to get the early bird special after seven?
Yeah, they're backing down.
Let's go get them.
They'll stop at nothing to clean up this tree.
Hey lady, you can't cross here. You'll have to cross in the light.
They're determined to clean up this muddling business.
All right, sister, you're under arrest.
Oh, so now you're under arresting my wife, what's the charge?
Session of powder.
Coming in first time, let's see that white stuff.
Yeah, just a thought.
She's got over 100 bags in here.
Oh, what?
Sweet and low.
From that restaurant, she just came out of.
Let's take a minute.
Yeah, there can look in Miami cops on a hot newbie.
In Allendale, Vice.
We're mirroring this form on MBC.
Okay, any use of that material, by the way, is prohibited penalty of death.
It's a 21 past 10 at WIOD.
We're off to a rousey start this morning.
It's going to be great.
I just woke up, though, because Murray is on his way from Arnels.
Now, how soon are they going to be here?
1130.
1130?
Oh, man.
That's pretty far off, isn't it?
I bet they could be here by 1115 if they really put their hands together.
We got a kid in Kendall.
Hey, Neil.
Yeah.
Yeah, the dolphins look real good against the reds on Monday.
What is all right through their defense?
Yeah.
What team are you on?
What team are you on, pal?
What?
Raiders, man.
Raiders, what?
Raiders.
Where do you live?
I live in Kendall.
You live in Kendall?
How long you live there?
Oh, I've been on my life, really.
How long is that?
14 years.
14 years, and you're a Raider fan based on what?
Based on anything.
They beat the dolphins.
Based on what?
I was supposed to go to the bathroom, but they got cream.
I don't believe that.
Oh, I see.
So if we lose one game, you're a fan of whoever, how about a Giants fan?
They beat us, too.
You like the Giants?
I like the Giants.
Huh?
Why not?
They beat the crap out of us.
How come you don't like the Giants?
I don't know.
They're too big for me.
They're what?
It's too big.
Yeah, big is a word.
Okay.
Look straight down.
You'll see what small really means.
Okay, pal.
You idiot.
There he is.
14 years.
All his life.
Who was it?
Oh, is Henry wandering around with a bottle out in front, back in the building.
Henry, okay.
Cut the crap.
You didn't hear that little kid with his raiders.
I got your raider right over here, pal.
I got Al Davis's head on a plate.
You little piece of crap.
I hope all your friends in school, when you go back to school on Monday, know exactly who you are.
And just take you out in the backyard at school and beat the crap out of you.
I hope you look like a big walking wealth by the end of like second period, okay?
Slime ball.
W-I-O-D.
George is doing a monologue.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Sorry about number.
Okay.
A-ha-ha-ha.
Likely story.
Oh, did we catch you with your pantaloonies, dog pal?
Wrong number, my butt.
W-I-O-D.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I wish the whole world was for this little bunny rabbit.
W-I-O-D.
I, uh, hold on.
Let me turn off down the radio.
Okay.
Turn down your radio, sir, and cut the crap.
I'm ready for him now.
I just woke up.
I just realized.
W-I-O-D.
Play me on the rain.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, hold on.
That's Millie and Vanillie.
It's my mother and Gilbert.
Bokeh.
Hello.
Goodbye.
Miramar.
Hey, E-L.
Yes, sir.
I called you a couple weeks ago, told you about a cut-of-fine who's going to have the Camila's house.
Yeah.
And I got everyone's psyched and everyone's going to do it.
And, uh, I'm hoping to get a little bit over a grand.
Great.
That's going to be good.
Let's, by the way, yes, since I got your ear, I got a mid-E solution.
You want to hear?
We'll let them all fight it out.
Nook each other.
We went to live with the fallout.
And we buy our oil from whoever wins.
Sound good?
We have an open line in Broward, 524, W-I-O-D, and one in Palm Beach, 65-W-I-O-D.
Yeah, this is sunrise.
I want to speak to Neel Rogers.
Sure, hold on.
That's going to be a real winner.
Trust me.
Let's do sunrise on 5.
Hello.
Oh, boy, all the weirders are here.
Yeah, love it.
I'm ready for this today.
Just kind of fits in with the ambiance of the whole day.
You should do something about that kid.
I mean, they're the first.
I told you.
I'm going to find out what school that kid goes to and on Monday, boys.
He's going to have a little tomato surprise in his pants when he gets out of there.
I mean, I've been a season ticket holder for a number of years now,
and I'm finally glad to be able to see them in the playoffs.
I mean, how do you like you ask somebody?
How come you're a raider fan?
Well, they beat us.
They creamed us the other day.
Right.
They scored a whole 13 points.
Yeah.
By the way, we'll beat the Browns 28 to 6.
I just scored just came to me.
I had a pretty good Thanksgiving at the Pactor House, all.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
But it was a bad omen.
This is how I walked in his baby.
Some started screaming as that off.
Oh, him and his brother Steve and his town.
So they're real nice.
Well, that's great.
I'm happy for you.
I mean, nobody in the audience cares, but I'm happy for you.
I know, but they're listening.
And they're...
Yeah, I mean, I don't want to do one of these shows.
Well, how was your Thanksgiving yesterday?
And what did you have?
Do you have cranberries?
Do you have the smashy potatoes?
Do you have black beans?
And nobody cares about that?
No cranberries.
Well, you know, it all comes out the same, sir.
Right, me.
That's true.
And by the way, you made...
Oh, wait a minute.
Speaking of that, now, if Murray and Jeff, because Jeff called from pizza loft, and they're both bringing it, so keep in mind, we don't have like a whole staff of people here today, okay?
So it'll bring more than 20 pounds of food a piece.
Oh, yeah, pizza loft is great.
Yeah.
But you mentioned yesterday about Bill Marshall, Joey being on the air on my athletes.
Yeah.
I immediately called Bill Marshall and he knew nothing about it.
Mm-hmm.
So that's interesting.
It's curious.
Yeah.
Well, it's about as interesting as Thanksgiving at Rich Pactors House, I would say.
Hey, what do you want, you know?
It's all day.
Yeah.
Anyway, thanks, Neil.
Have a great life.
You too.
Don't ever call us again.
1032 at WIOD.
Now I have a feeling this is going to be an award-winner today.
At the beginning, I just...
I'm sorry, I just could not get into even being here.
WIOD, Georgia, smoking a big, uh, cheap Stogi.
Hello?
Come on, you can do it.
You can handle the pressure, can't you?
No?
Okay.
Let's go to Miami.
Hello.
Hey, Neil, I hope we get caught.
Right on.
1032.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Ah, right.
I echo those sentiments.
400%.
There's an open line on the Star Line, Star I would be.
We have another pinhead in Fort Lauderdale.
Hello?
Uh-oh.
Yes, sir.
Am I on?
Yes, I think so.
Sounds just like you.
All right, um...
Now you're not going to give me that raider stuff, are you?
No, you know, little punkle call I go to at school.
Yeah.
And I'm going to kick his butt on Monday.
Good.
Knock his teeth down his throat.
Let me tell you something.
The golfers are the best team and they're going to beat Cleveland.
And let me tell you why.
They lost one stupid game and that little kid better watch out.
Yeah.
Little idiot.
Right.
Gonna stick that football right in his poop and then inflate it.
You tell him, Neil.
Make a size of a watermelon.
All right.
Okay?
Okay.
Good luck to your pal.
You don't go to the school at kids and brow the other kids in Kindle.
But he's got good intentions.
You're full of crap, kid.
1038.
But these are good because these kids who are like future callers on radio talk shows,
because most callers are full of crap anyway.
So good practice, kids.
Don't you love these days when the kids are out of school?
That's what I love.
And they call in, they make like little jackasses out of themselves.
It's great because someday you'll be a big jackass.
And you call in and pretend like you know what you're talking about.
We know you're all full of it.
Right?
Yes.
Neil.
No.
Call me off guard, everybody.
I know.
We like to do that.
North Miami.
It's called one-upsmanship, sir.
No matter what you're doing, we're always like way ahead of you.
Yeah.
So you think Steven was good.
He ate the bird pretty good.
Yeah.
I hear that.
Yeah.
I had a good bird too.
Well, I had to give it.
My parents did me a favor yesterday while I was there.
They gave me an inch telephone answering machine.
Oh boy.
How's it about making me a great tape here for the machine?
Okay, I'd be delighted.
All right.
You're on.
Okay.
Goofball in here right now.
But if you leave your name, number, shoe size, and the measurements,
we'll get right back to you.
Okay.
Have a good day, y'all.
Thank you.
Okay.
1039 at WIOD.
21 before 11.
That's our Nashville correspondent, No Doubt.
He was hatched under a rock back by the Hermitage Under Andy Jackson's old house.
WIOD, Georgia's weight deed.
Hello.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah, I like to talk about the game between the dolphins and the Los Angeles.
And the Los Angeles what?
The football game.
The Los Angeles what?
What's their nickname?
Um, used to be an Oakland.
What I want to talk about.
Used to be an Oakland, Darrell LeMonica, Penny Stabler.
What is it?
What is it, sir?
You can do it.
Come on, squeeze it out.
Okay.
I love it.
I love it.
Man.
It is so great.
99% of these people when you pick them up cold, man.
They don't let it a scream or turn into a banana.
It's great.
Oh, another kid from Kindle.
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Rogers.
Can you say Raider's suck?
Yeah.
Okay.
Good one.
Good call, pal.
I had another line for you, too, but you're not old enough to hear it.
We have an open line in Dade County.
Suck was part of it.
10.52, let's go to North Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, ma'am.
How are you this morning?
Great.
Listen, I am down here on the holiday weekend.
And I'm just listening to you.
From New York?
No, no.
From Philadelphia.
From Philly.
Well, that's close enough.
Yeah.
And I'm just listening to you for the very first time.
Are you cereal?
I am cereal.
Come on.
You're pulling my chain now.
I am oatmeal.
I am cereal.
Okay.
You said a few minutes ago that you are a little psychotic today.
Yeah.
How psychotic?
Because I'm listening to this and these people that are calling in seem to know you quite well.
Yeah.
Well, that's because they're crazy as I am.
Uh-huh.
So this is the way your show usually goes.
Well, I mean, there's no like predictable pattern.
What does that mean?
In other words, you expect, is this the first time you've heard the show?
Yes, sir.
And you expect to listen one day and you like have your finger on it?
Well, no, but that's why I'm asking.
That's why I was asking.
Well, it's hard to say this is a very bizarre, very volatile town.
It goes whichever way the wind is blowing just like the football fans here.
Uh-huh.
Well, I am a dolphin fan, but I have to tell you my allegiance goes with the Eagles.
And I understand they'll be there.
Well, we understand that.
And we'll kick the crap out of them.
But, uh-huh.
You probably will.
You're right.
Well, they're a little erratic.
Okay, I think they would be the kindest word I could use.
Unpredictable erratic.
Uh-huh.
It seems to me they've got the talent.
They just can't come together.
Oh, I will say this.
Unless we have a better pass rush against the Eagles than we had against the Raiders,
Randall Cunningham is going to run a set of the ground.
He's dangerous.
He's dangerous.
Yeah, he's dangerous.
I didn't see any pass rush to the dolphin fan.
No.
We're going to injure him in the first quarter and get his ass out of the game.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
All right, well, it was a very interesting morning I've had listening to you.
Because we've only been on less than an hour and already you're kind of like trying to
analyze the program.
And I think you have to give it a little more time.
Uh-huh.
It's like if you listen to Howard Stern for five minutes, you wouldn't get the drift of it.
That's true.
You would get the four words, but that would be about it.
All right, well, I wish you a happy holiday.
And the same to you.
And take good care.
Okay.
And don't be too abusive to the kids.
They don't know any more.
Exactly.
After we beat him up, we'll clean him off and put him back in school again.
Nice guy.
See ya.
All right, bye.
Give him a little bath.
Feed him to the dolphins.
We have an open line in date county, 7519463, 751.
W-I-O-D.
Here's a mobile on the turnpike on our star line.
Well, I'm up.
Magnal, Neil.
You're what?
The AC.
Oh, another bad phone.
Bad phone, man.
If I had a dollar for every bad mobile phone we got in this town, I could retire.
I could go in the desert myself.
Is he gone?
Look at that.
Not only the phone was so bad, it like one of those immediate disconnects.
Sorry, it wasn't us, sir.
It was your crappy phone.
Sorry about that.
Anybody who knows that guy buy him a new cellular phone for Hanukkah or Christmas or a Purim or something.
Okay.
That was pathetic.
We get a whole bunch of those.
And they start out in the media.
They're already crackling and puking.
And like, Marconi is rolling in his grave and then like after three, we're in the middle of a sentence.
Woop.
Just like having a Ted Bundy.
Hollywood.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
There's no longer Hollywood.
Well, what do you mean it's no longer Hollywood?
It's little Quebec.
Yeah.
I'm boxed in on each side now.
We.
A.
We A.
I got one on each side of me now.
Two, brick-a.
But down here, they got the satellite dish.
Yeah.
One channel.
Yeah.
And like, they ruined the holiday for us.
The worst thing's given me ever had.
They're all out in the back yard.
Yeah.
You know, with the baby.
I don't like that one as well.
I like the one where the guy is singing, you know.
It has a little more schmaltz to it.
With that organ.
Watch what he does with it, too.
Okay.
Now, they were all out in the back yard with the baby and suits.
Six sizes, two small and the stomachs, forty sizes too big.
I want to know one thing.
Are there any French Canadians who are under the age of a hundred and look on a scale of ten better than a minus two hundred?
I mean, they are just so old and grotesque and cheap and disgusting and drive and reverse.
You all make a sick go away.
They went away now.
They went into where my niece, she's a waitress, right?
Yeah.
Forty eight dollar bill.
One two left.
What can I have?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Ah!
Yeah.
So now here's the best part is when you ask him something, they don't speak English.
Yeah.
But when they want something, they know his re-wee.
Now they speak real good English.
You're in lead, you would love those French.
By the way, I want to take something back.
Now I put words in Henry Barrow's mouth yesterday about the late great restaurant critic Peter Clayton.
And I got to admit, not seriously because I know Henry used to hang out with him at all those free wine tastings and all of it.
He said, Peter really knew his crap.
That's what he said.
Ah, I guess.
Now seriously, that's what Henry said.
One other thing before I go.
Yeah.
Up at Pompo-no.
I bought them guys on the four floor.
Why don't you get them guys to send in a check.
You know the ones that leave the bartender, 50 dollar tips and stuff.
Listen to me, sir.
I am trying desperately to get the people at Pompo-no park anybody to come up with some cash.
And so far Kelly Shepard, who is O for a lifetime, the season is the only guides giving me a check for 50 bucks.
And I've challenged all the other trainers and drivers and horsemen and horse manure to come up with some cash for Camilla's house.
So far, Zipety doodah.
So when I get up there on Sunday evening for my usual weekly plunge, Alan Thickelson better have a gigantic check from all those plungeers up there.
Okay.
That's the least they can do.
Really?
For all I've left up there and all the promotion we give him.
I'm out in a very least they can do.
I'm out in a money order because I was afraid of check with bounce.
Yeah.
Probably right.
And by the way, Mickie McNickelson's in a money money order is only no checks, Mickie.
Oh, he was, he was racing last night.
He was finishing the last race from Sunday.
Yeah, right.
And he's still in the year.
Have a great day, pal.
Yeah.
Why is the level so low on that?
Oh, geez.
That's enough.
Okay, it's, we got a pig report on the star line.
Hello.
I think I'm calling for another guy with another third pike.
They're on him for just out to make 36.
All of Turkey's are out the day.
Everything's giving, ladies and gentlemen.
It's the end of the month.
You know what that means?
They got about 10 units out there.
10 units?
10 units.
Yeah.
Yellow and black ones.
Boy, I'm shining.
You believe that?
Yeah, I believe that.
You're going to want that newer past clock and I see him up there.
He's in a big car.
Yeah.
He's in a talent deal.
He's the alpha clocker.
Well, I don't know.
Hey, if you get stopped by, I'm just asking instead of the speed.
I'm going to take it to the state troopers ball.
Okay.
They don't have balls.
See ya.
10.58.
Boy, I'm Tonya.
They all got material today.
If you find anybody today's got material, just walk up to them and say, can that be felt?
Zimba.
Master of the romantic smile, this one.
And rock on my junior legs, that's what I'm doing.
Together for the first time.
Zimba and Seppler, rock on my junior.
Master of the romantic smile, this one.
A Sam and Sepp world, it'll take a land out of your business.
Well, I don't understand it.
Ticker on the, on a financial channel was moving again.
It was down three and a half.
Now it's back to where it was before.
What the hell is going on up there?
There must no Joe Brennan.
11.26.
Welcome to our post Thanksgiving Day.
A little, uh, pick out here.
Man.
On outs only down 1.24.
It's all over the place.
It's Wiggle Wobbling with less Cooper.
Crawl Springs.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Good.
Did you hear my new dog I busted today?
Yeah.
Oh, man, you're doing the Wicked weed.
They had like two little flakes.
And they busted them both.
They're wacky.
They're wacky.
Yeah.
Did you hear a spy report from some man yesterday?
About.
About some guy on another radio station announcing that this is the first time he's going to do a contest on WIOD.
He aired.
What?
He aired.
I don't understand.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm mentioning a bond.
You're a radio station now, sir.
Who?
Come on.
Two to six.
Yeah.
He said he's doing a contest for the first time on his new station WIOD.
Think about it.
We're thinking.
We're chewing and we're thinking WF-T-L.
He got to let me.
Oh, you mean Mr.
You're a pain, said that.
No.
No.
No, wait.
Wow.
It's 1128 at WF-T-L, at WIOD.
We need a lot more of those little pimple-headed kids to call in and make fools out of themselves.
And we'll trace those calls and find out what school they go to and on Monday, man.
They're going to just get beaten into a bloody pulp.
They look like survivors from some of those teenage horror high school movies, you know?
Let's go to Mayany Flakes.
I'm dying over here.
Week.
Week.
That wasn't the doc for anybody who hasn't tuned in for a while if you're off for holiday day.
That was not the doc.
That was like a cheap imitation except it not.
There's an opening in day, 751.
Kendall.
Yes.
Hello, Minion.
Yeah.
It's about time those dolphins sell out a game.
Yeah.
And about Monday night.
Butch up and use your real voice, okay?
Before you take your little stupid shot and go back to New York kind of bus, use your real voice.
And about Monday night.
Yeah, I wouldn't use it either.
I'd be embarrassed also.
The markets have nine and a half points.
When other people don't act the way you want them to, does it frustrate you?
Are you tired of the press writing stories that tell the whole truth about your incredibly
sorry life?
Want to know a great way to get back at all those scumbags?
Well now you can, at the Abe Hersfield School of really disgusting behavior.
Learn the fine art of totally ignoring people.
Excuse me, sir.
What kind of salad dressing would you like?
Sir, what dressing would you like on your salad?
Sir.
Get helpful hints from the master of rude on how to act like an asshole to almost everyone you meet.
Mr. Hershfield, I've heard so much about...
Oh!
Hey, wait a minute!
At the Abe Hershfield School of really disgusting behavior, you'll also learn direct from the master of the disgustingly obnoxious.
The fine art of harking up a big greasy clam right on the face of unsuspecting reporters.
Just think how much fun you'll have watching a huge flamboyle running down the face of some too-bid low-life reporter.
Act now, and you'll also receive the Abe Hershfield book on how not to sell valuable property in eight seconds or less.
Yes, you too can be really disgusting when you attend the Abe Hershfield School of really disgusting behavior.
And roll now for classes that start in just a few short weeks.
Sorry, sensitive kind, respectful human beings need not apply.
Maybe you could throw that spinner for the cups next year, right?
Here's the diddy about a bitty in my city not as old as dirt, but she sure is pretty.
Oh, I tell you, it's quite a pity, livin' on a loan on social security.
She's not acting, it's a true setup.
Walkin' by the door in her brand new get-up.
She trips, she falls, she tries to call.
I fall and I can't get up.
I fall and I can't get up.
Yo, man, didn't I see you in one turn?
Oh, man, you had no idea.
Yo, yo, yo, yo, me and the crew used to polo that blew her.
And now she's not allowed to dance.
They drove her away in an amber lamp.
Make a get commercial, speakin' bit-buck-sup.
I fall and I can't get up.
I fall and I can't get up.
Well, we're having a little chat in here.
George just relax, it's holiday.
Just have a little party.
11.53 at W.O.D.
What's more important, my eating or a being on the ear, okay?
That's what Henry said.
My drinkin' or being on the ear.
Poppano.
Is that the click?
I don't hear the click.
Oh, there it is.
Okay, thank God.
North Miami.
Happy holidays, Neil.
Happy Hanukkah to you, too, sir.
I have three poop scoops, little ones.
Okay, you wanna hear them?
Yeah, I thought I had something to do with Jeff's new dog.
He was just tell me about his puppy.
No, that's what I think that's what they found on Rick Weaver's chair after the game.
Could be.
He did say that, by the way.
I wanna reiterate again.
He did say that.
He did?
Did you hear the tape on it?
I don't know, but I mean, it just got too many ear witnesses.
He said the 73,000 people, the largest crowd ever to see the dolphins lose.
He said it.
Well, the epicent of Hyatt, he can call people names.
He said it.
I am very upset about the way he's been talking about the dolphins.
But this past Monday, when I went to the game, as with the tailgate party,
I had the chance to have a TV radio with me.
So I listened to ABC instead of having to put up with Rick Weaver.
Well, he sure took a lot of heat this season.
Well, you know, the guys got problems with the show.
And the server would have mixed it up with business.
Exactly, that's true.
That is true.
That's you got a very valid point.
Yeah.
Anyways, Muhammad Ali is going to Saudi Arabia to talk to Saddam Husqar.
Good.
Stick him in the desert.
And also Bill Wyman.
And you know, he was dating that girl that he got married to from the Rolling Stones.
Good horse.
Bill Wyman, he was dating her when she was 13 years old.
Yeah.
Well, it's all over now, as Mick Jagger would say.
Yeah.
And all of a sudden, last but not least, our favorite guy in the United States, Kweil,
is donating his old glove to the Little League Museum in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.
Yeah.
His glove is very much like his head.
They both have a big hole in the middle.
Well, it's been a definitely great pressure listening to you and keep up the
excellent show.
The pressure is all mine.
Okay, thank you.
Have a great day.
Oh, wait, have we have Sandy on the line?
Sandy.
Hi.
You're not going away, are you?
No, last day.
We'll get to you.
Okay.
Because you're a celebrity now.
Okay.
You sure you're going to hold on?
Sandy.
Yes.
You sure you're going to hold on now?
I'll only hold on for you, Neil.
Wow.
Not too tight.
It's an asshole celebration and they're all out on the street.
See them on the sidewalk.
Oh, here they're shopping at the feet.
That's 40,000 assholes doing an asshole from the maid.
Step aside and good at people.
There's the assholes on the parade.
We've got the assholes for freedom.
The assholes for fun.
The assholes for Jesus.
The assholes for guns.
The assholes for justice.
The assholes for crime.
The assholes for asshole.
The assholes for all time.
We've got assholes making money.
We're making all the rules.
We're taking all our jobs.
We're filling up our schools.
The assholes on the water.
The assholes on the sky.
The signs are such hell wanted.
The assholes need to fly.
Oh, teacher, won't you tell me?
Have I really made the grade?
Am I held my class or am I just another asshole on the parade?
The assholes get the orders.
The assholes get elected.
The assholes get the vote.
I want to start a fun battle.
The assholes never die.
They just lay in bed and multiply.
The assholes in the morning.
The assholes every night.
The assholes are letting.
The assholes get the praise.
The assholes get the praise.
The assholes from the land.
The assholes get the sight good people.
The assholes on the parade.
Well, and people are starving, right, Sandy?
Right, listen to me.
We got a whole cheese pie here that nobody's even touched yet in a half of a pepperoni from Jeff.
Hey, you guys are peeing out over there, aren't you?
And some white hots and some hot sauce and a whole bunch of eggplant parmesan and a couple of garlic rolls left.
How was your turkey yesterday?
It was outstanding.
Your mom ate it.
My mom of course got an empire kosher turkey the best.
Oh, great.
And made this incredible herbal, herbal almond stuffing.
Great cranberries.
Well, I got to find out from her what kind of cramps you buy in the store.
Is that like frozen, Sandy?
What?
When you get cranberries?
I think so.
Or you come in a can.
No, I'm not talking about...
Oh, yeah, even the mashed up kind coming in a can, too, don't I?
Yeah, they're all canned.
Are they?
Yeah, they're making so.
Oh, these were incredible.
You know what?
I don't want people to start to talk and say I'm totally chronic, but I have a reason for calling to them.
Sandy, you can call.
And you and Bobby can call any day you want because you are celebrities, you are stars, we've converted you.
It's almost like with Laura converting.
Thank you.
Well, listen, my brother-in-law, he's in town today.
Okay, and he's leaving Monday, so he's listening to you today because I'm making him.
Yeah, and what does he say so far?
Well, his name is Ernie, and he likes Steve Kane.
Oh, no!
And I make him stay here.
You don't believe me.
Yeah.
So I told him you have to listen to Neil today.
No, Steve Kane.
First of all, you can't get it in day because you need a proper poster which we don't have.
Exactly.
Maybe he's got a pacemaker.
You could stick his stick in there if I work.
That's right, and second I told him I promised him I was going to call him a douchebag on the radio.
What a slime ball.
So this one goes out to my brother-in-law.
Yeah.
So Neil, that's what I really called for today.
Tell him to put it in this pipe and smoke it.
I will.
Where's Cory going?
Cory just zoomed up out of that chair and took off like a bat and heat.
Well, you're doing it, Neil.
You're number one.
We are doing it, Sandy, and you're number one and one half.
Yeah.
And Bobby is one and three quarters.
Bobby is a turkey. He's working today.
Really?
Yeah, I got today off, so I'm not risking my job today by calling you.
Well, you're a great American, Sandy.
Have a wonderful weekend and kick your-what is he your brother-in-law?
Brother-in-law.
Brother-in-law, brother-in-law.
Kick his ass out of there.
I will.
Stick him out in the middle of I-75.
We'll speed it up on the way home.
I'm afraid.
Have a great day.
Love you.
Bye.
Well, markets up 10 points.
The food is fantastic.
From Wayne Arnold at Arnold's Royal Castle.
At 125th in Northwest 7th Avenue right off the 125th Street Exit of I-95.
And the pizza loft in Jeff Cohen, one of the great Americans in history,
who blew all that money on that stupid stuff on the game.
You gotta go to pizza loft this weekend and help them make that money back,
so we'll have plenty of money to buy a Hanukkah gift, okay?
Like for me.
1215.
Or W-Y-O-D, where the food fest continues.
Boy, I haven't eaten that much.
I have?
Yeah, I have.
I had eggplant.
I had four Neely burgers.
Four.
Well, that's not much.
Two slices of pizza and a little sliver.
That's it.
I'm finished for today, okay?
That's it for me.
Although there's a...
We'll save the White Hots for suds.
What do we got to...
Oh, look at that.
Two big ones.
We're up to our long distance dedication.
And this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand.
Whether we have kids or pets or neither.
It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio, and here's what he likes.
Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request,
but I'm quite sincere, and it'll meet a lot if you play it.
Recently, there was a death in our family.
He was a little dog named Snuggles,
but he was most certainly a part of us come start again.
From coming out of the record.
Play the record, okay?
Please.
See, when you come out of those up-tempo damn numbers,
man, it's impossible to make those transitions.
And then you've got to go into somebody dying.
You know, they do this to me all the time.
I don't know what the hell they do it for, but damn it.
If we can't come out of a slow record, I don't understand it.
Is down on the phone?
Okay.
I want a damn concerted effort to come out of a record
that isn't a f***ing up-tempo record.
Every time I do a damn death dedication.
Now, make it, and I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week.
It's a god-lass f***ing damn time.
I want somebody who's a f***ing brain to not come out of a f***ing damn record.
That's up-tempo, and I got to talk about a f***ing tour of dying.
Boy, this f***ing ponderous, man.
Ponderous f***ing ponderous.
Rose and Barbie, it's all she can.
Can't fit in the melancholy band.
So Rose and Barbie doll looks and acts just like the TV pig.
Just pull her strand of spaghetti.
I never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, ever, ever, ever.
And look what happens when you press her little fat belly.
Rose and Barbie, it's all she can.
Can't fit in the melancholy band.
The new Rose and Barbie doll.
Can't carry it so separately.
Say her back, your favorite Jewish rock and roll nostalgia band.
It's Russia, Shanana with their greatest hits album, Sakaapathasinigag.
My whereby's back is gonna super-send my baby.
Or my, or my, my whereby's back.
Yes, Russia, Shanana is reformed to bring you 12 kosher cuts of hoppin Hebrew hygiene.
That joy is a good for you.
This album should be in every orthodox rocker's collection.
Rolling Stone gives it five stars of David.
If I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, who wrote the book of Job?
Sakaapathasinigag, new from Russia, Shanana, available in all record stores.
We'll talk twice when you get here.
Don't pass over this album.
The heat.
Okay, it's 12.40.
There are two open lines in Broward.
Look at that.
I think that's the first time that's happened since a week ago, Sukers.
I'm Ted Couple.
And this is Punchline.
There's been a major breakthrough in the science of male contraception.
ABC's Barbara Walters has more.
Ted, I'm here at the University of Louisville, laboratory with Dr. Richard Robinson
who's invented a new birth control pill for men.
Dr. what is this pill, Joe?
Well, it's actually very simple, Barbara.
A man puts it in a shoe and it makes him limp.
Ted?
Tomorrow night we cross a praying mantis with a termite
and get an insect that says grace before it eats your house.
I'm Ted Couple and this is Punchline.
We land, the zoo is flat.
Up and minus zero, it's a war.
Scary tales can come true.
It can happen to you if you're Gary Hart.
While the white is away in the townhouse you'll play.
If you're Gary Hart.
A big price you'll pay if with women you play.
Not once, it was twice.
You were caught with misrised.
You're really not too smart.
If you can't stay apart now you won't be president.
Gary Hart.
You won't be the president, no.
Gary Hart.
What a shame, eh?
126 at WIOD.
The Palm Beach Line is just sitting there waiting for you to do it.
655-9463-655.
WIOD.
Okay, I'd plunge at least a thousand on this one, right Phil?
Absolutely, maybe two thousand.
There you go.
I can't believe what a great call for the post that was.
We got it together now.
We're not going to just do a flock this year.
We're going to give you the big presentation.
Absolutely.
Well, I'm ready if you are pal.
You picked Marissa's knife, right?
In the third race, what is that kid's first name?
Alpha.
Jose.
Jose Alpha.
Jose, can you see?
Right.
All right, here we go.
There's a quarter of a mile to go.
They turned for home.
They went to half and 46 and three.
And Marissa's knife opens up with two lanes.
Please, that fire missed toward the inside.
Is second with lovely visions.
It's back to Randy's Liberty.
Then comes Tika's star looking for him toward the inside.
North spurs to his neck and then shy little girl.
They move past the eighth pole.
Marissa's knife extends her lead to four.
Tika's star toward the inside.
Now comes on second.
Link to that back to step fire, Mr.
then North spurs with lovely vision.
A 16-a-mile to come.
Jose Alpha res is driving over old noise today.
Marissa's knife draws off by herself.
Tika's star second is North spurs.
Comes on third.
They come to the wire.
And Marissa's knife, the Neil Roger's special.
She wins it by four.
Tika's star at distance second with North spurs.
Third.
Incredible.
Incredible.
And six eighty Neil.
Hey, I'll take it.
That's a six dollar horse on Monday.
And the six eighty today or whatever day that was Tuesday.
Yeah.
And six eighty today.
Right.
One day.
And what a rate of respon your loss for the weekend.
Two out of three in our first picks, right?
Not too bad.
And this one.
And amazingly, I usually look,
Dirk Ackerman's got the greatest entries.
And he picked her fourth, whether I told you.
But I saw Alpha res at six to one.
I forget there's a good shot.
Absolutely.
And this kid can ride.
She can and she ran a hell of a race today.
Evidently.
Why are the wire?
I'd bet at least a thousand.
And now the guy, see, this is what's going to confuse these people.
I was going to say I'm holding back on them and I really know something.
So on Tuesday, when we pick next, he'll want to go out and put 500 on a horse I pick.
So I'm going to pick a real stiff on Tuesday.
Oh my god.
No, don't say that.
No, I'll do my best.
I always do my best.
You did very, very well the last time we did these.
Yeah.
Now listen.
That's right.
It goes to show you.
Now I want to go in no racing form.
I just take the paper, pick a name.
I was going to start having a racing form sent over to you.
No, hey, that'll kill it.
Now listen, swirling funnel.
Remember I told you the guy called in yesterday?
Right.
But the more I reflect on it, I think he called after 11 o'clock.
Uh-huh.
So the race was already over and we forgot about it because you had that extra early post yesterday.
So I have a feeling he might have just had the post.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so too.
And they're one of those after the race experts.
Right.
You know, anyone can do that.
But let's say that you did it before the race.
Yes, by 20 minutes.
Right.
So anyway, look, I hope you have a great weekend.
You too.
And how was Thanksgiving, by the way?
Thanksgiving was fine.
I mean, maybe I did it.
Oh, the best.
You betcha.
All right, panel, listen, have a great weekend.
And I guess I'll talk to you on Tuesday.
Okay.
All right, take care.
See you, Phil.
Bye.
Bye.
How about that?
Draw it drawing off and winning all alone.
Marissa's night with Alvarez.
I told you, 680.
Anyway, here he goes sliding the microphone over again.
Ladies and gentlemen, a man who is desperate to speak to the world.
How's your neighbor doing?
He sucks.
Okay.
Can you eat?
You ate in a big turkey, I say, right?
I didn't eat a lot yesterday.
No, I had Thanksgiving dinner, but I didn't go crazy at all.
No.
No.
Very, very judicious.
We did eat that we picked out today.
I noticed.
I'm doing fine.
Why do I look fat?
You all of a sudden look like you lost weight.
I think I'm lost.
Yes, I have.
I've lost back about six or seven pounds.
I'm almost back to where my lower point was.
I still have a little way to go.
I'm not doing so bad.
I just couldn't think of eating today.
In fact, this shirt is way too big.
I'm starting to wear bigger shirts, so I look even slimmer.
You what?
Well, yeah, because you picked out yesterday.
You cheated.
You went off.
You went off the deep end.
He's wearing his deep ends today.
He's wearing deep ends yesterday.
Oh, boy.
Well, you know that's not real.
You know that that'll even out over the weekend once you get back on a straight narrow path.
But Monday you'll look like Elaine.
Anna Rexic.
Boy, she is so hysterical for Cory and her.
She was just crawling on the floor and clawing at the helium tank there.
Look at the other scars on that tank there.
Man.
Anything.
She said she would just give millions to just get anywhere near his body just for a little
a feel.
He's way too young for that.
Exactly.
He's under 100.
Miami.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
What's the name of that record store that has all the Uncle Bond's I records?
Blue note.
Blue note.
It's North Miami Beach.
163rd right next to a peaches as a matter of fact.
Oh, okay.
All right.
I think I know where that is.
Can you handle that right across from the 163rd Street Mall?
Okay.
I'm going to give a presentation on Tuesday on censorship.
Yeah.
And I'm going to talk about you and how your WIOD got slapped with a fine.
Right.
So in class, I'm going to play the song.
Uh-oh.
Not in Broward.
Oh, no, that's why you.
Oh, thank God.
Not a BCC.
No way.
El Sherriff would have you in a whose gal in no time, man?
You and Luther.
Yep.
Okay.
Anything you want to say for the record store the class?
Get a life.
To defend yourself.
Get a life.
See you.
That's what they're going to say to you.
Okay.
Thank you.
Bye.
147th to defend myself to FIU.
I mean, are you kidding, sir?
Speak at the English and butcher up.
That's all I can say to that guy.
And just remember to have an application.
You're guilty until proven innocent.
That's what Johnny Dark found out.
He is guilty.
His neighbor is a slime ball.
His neighbor is going to spend 20 years in Arcadia.
Norman Kent's going to have him put away for life.
Right?
I thought the Nazis were gone.
I mean, I just didn't realize that they were still in existence.
Foolish me.
I'm going to say.
I'm going to say.
I'm going to say.
I'm going to say.
