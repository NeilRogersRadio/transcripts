of I-95 and we got it all for today boy we've got some real serious crap here today we've got
the t-shirts both kinds both the unbelievable t-shirts those beautiful things that the t-shirt
Bob designed and the Rick and Suds snooze cruise t-shirts we've also got the best Neil tapes

you want and also we've got some stuff to draw for so anybody that's here and that's going to be
coming in be sure and fill out one of those entry blanks because we have some stuff we're going
to be giving out including 20 dollar Bizarre box certificates that are good in any of the 500
merchants here at the Bizarre so we'll be drawing for those we've also got some passes for Friday

Community College and this is where 25 bucks for the pair I have no idea what it is somebody
sent it to me in a southern bell envelope nobody knows what this is somebody I'll come and
explain to us what it is and then they'll come in like crazy and sign up to win those also a
pair of tickets to off Broadway on East 26th Street their current production at Wilton Manors
1444 North East 26th Street and if that isn't enough everybody that comes by while they last
today we have a collector's item that we're giving out absolutely free in fact we might pay
everybody a buck to take one from last year the bird lives what we need TV for these I'll tell you
the bird picture are those beautiful or what in fact Georgia may model what you really
supposed to do with these look at that the total we've already we haven't even started yet we
got almost a thousand dollars already is that possible six hundred ninety dollars and we just sat
down so let me add that to our total for Camilla's house because that's really we're here for two
reasons today and that is to bring a lot of people out to the bizarre and spend billions of dollars
and also of course to raise a couple billion of our own for Camilla's house that puts us already
oh that's a softball game the dolphins oh so that is the dolphins and the firefighter all stars in
West Palm Beach so anybody who comes down like from Northbroward or Palm Beach County who might
want those will draw until we find somebody who's going to use them 43,153 and counting already
for Camilla's house so already like in the first few minutes we've done about seven hundred
dollars here today we invite you to come on out there are just everything under the sun that
you could imagine for your holiday shopping here in the bizarre they have over 500 shops they've got
you name it they got it from jewelry to handbags to shoes to clothing and everything else under the
sun name brands discount prices and we're set up here in the food court which you will always
kind of like being here because that's why we have fat rich set up over there on the end of the
table just to make sure that everybody gets sampled just a little bit from kosher from Delhi over
there to Italian food to Mexican to sausages and chili dogs and yogurt and everything else under
the sun so come on out bring a lot of money and let's do a little piece of business then we'll
come back naturally we're going to have thousands are going to let me ask you something there's
somebody conspicuous by his abs and so far crowd all smiling hoping praying some people are already
genuinely reflecting in praying that maybe it's an old man you think he'll be here okay Rick
rally and suds Coleman also promised they're going to stop by I'm sure Johnny dark will be stopping
into snorps and free food and also put on a big song and to dance about the coast and give a
couple of free plugs now how come I'm curious why isn't that the coast gets all the free plugs on
the a m on i.o.d and yet if they're mentioned neo-rodgers on the fn they go into cardiac arrest and
fleetwood groover starts breaking CDs over his knee I don't understand it but maybe when Johnny
