If I had the ability to do I take you out here right now kick your goddamn teeth in.
Looks like some young guy has a new girlfriend, okay?
And he thinks she is the hottest thing since sliced bread, okay?
And gorgeous and just fabulous in every possible way, okay?
And he takes you out on a date and he runs into a couple of friends of his, okay, at Club
New.
New.
And they take him off the side.
And I say, you know, Joe, he's okay, but you know, she's got that like low on her cheek,
you know, and her ass is just, just not like one cheek is bigger than the other one, you
know?
And I just don't understand how anybody can be that like, oh, here's another one, he's
got it in the attic and he's in the basement.
Can you hear it?
Okay, good job.
Okay.
Okay.
Or is it an eight?
Yeah.
Fine.
Okay, now this ought to be pretty exciting, okay?
Oh, and through.
Okay, now just secondly, put that a hold on a year on and that's on.
I don't hear anything, do you?
No.
There it goes.
This could be great.
Or not.
And it's ringing in the nose.
It's not busy.
835 in San Francisco.
I just got up that early.
You're nobody.
They're not answering it.
Mom must be like, here, you didn't take any calls.
I can understand why.
Mom has got that live studio audience.
Right.
You're nobody.
Boy, I wonder if he's got a, like a border.
Or are you just sitting there holding it himself?
No.
You're somebody.
Love you.
You're nobody.
You're somebody answers the phone.
Come on, Alex, pick the phone up.
Well, yeah, now what are we going to do about this?
I don't know.
And this could be pressing.
I can't sound so early.
He does mornings.
Oh.
He does like six to eights morning dive.
Drive.
Just tune in when you said if anybody wants to call.
Oh, yeah.
In other words, you didn't hear the article I read?
No, no.
About how he's 50 years old?
No, I didn't hear that.
Now, he's only been, now, didn't he say when he was here?
He was 44.
And I kept saying he was lying about his age.
Now that he's back there, he's admitting to at least 50.
Well, he was, well, first he was what, 48, then it became 44.
Yeah.
And then when he left, he said he was like 36.
And now all of a sudden he's 50 again.
Except he's not even there.
And I'll be honest with you, between you and me,
it could pass for 60 easy.
OK.
No, seriously, he's got like a wrinkled up head
and he looks like he said a rough line.
I saw him.
You were here?
Yeah.
Well, I'm going to call it back a little while
because that's annoying here.
That ran.

News talk radio 610 WIOD.
When the radio comes, I'm from beautiful North Bay Village
where he was busted by the police department
for being a total loser.
It's a salute to our Spanish.
The man who constantly exercises neck
by looking over his shoulder.
The man from California who didn't have a tan.
The man who founded great fun to rip his fellow workers.
But when ripped himself turned into a smithling, crying,
complaining candy ass.
The man who finally chose some semblance of intelligence
when he packed his bags and got the hell out of town.
One of the few men who could actually go back to an old job
in an old town telling old jokes and doing even older bits.
We salute you, Alex Bennett.
South wind has never seen a bigger paranoid.
A bigger backstabber.
A bigger cry, baby.
Alex Bennett, nor a complete asshole.
All right, a little salute to our man in San Francisco.
We're going to continue trying to calm because it's only like
9 o'clock in the morning out there.
Stay tuned for the news.
We'll be back.
Now let me ask you a question.
Why is it that when you call lines busy?
Every time I call, I get right through.
It's like calling this show.
They never any busy lines get right through.
Come on, Alex.
Pick up the phone.
I know you're old, but crawl over to the phone
and pick it up.
Will you?
Man.
Have somebody in the live studio audience pick up the phone?
Yo, nobody.
This is a guy who graduated high school at the age of eight.
He became a brain surgeon at the age of 11.
He left here.
He was 44.
And in just three months, he's turned 50.
Let's see.
4 times 6.24.
That means in another year, he'll be 74.
And in two years, he'll be 100.
Even the Fuzla couldn't match that.
I'm calling the right number.
I know that.
It's not busy.
And nobody answers.
And he's got a boring show.
Now let me ask you a question.
If I put that on hold, is there nothing?
What?
What is she shaking her?
What the hell do you know?
If I put that on hold, do we feed the program on hold
on the bat line too?
OK, so I'll put it on hold.
And just in case they pick it up, they'll know what's here.
Which would be great.
It'll piss them off.
You're calling what?
For a sonny.
Or...
Yeah, that's a number.
That's what I just dialed.
Meathead.
What?
You're calling it busy?
In other words, you don't think I can dial the damn phone.
Is that what you're saying?
I think if it's a contest between you and me,
I don't think it's...
We need to take a vote.
Kendall.
Nail.
Yeah.
Till Alex rubs your forehead.
Duh, duh, duh.
I'm afraid of what?
If you ever rubbed his forehead, you'd have to start at two o'clock
in the morning and go to a noon.
Here's a forehead from his chin to his poop.
11 afternoon at WYOD, where we have a morning show in the morning,
a midday show in the midday,
an afternoon show between two and six.
We give the time, the weather, the temperature, the sports scores,
and all kinds of information.
And a lot of corny ridiculous promos
that our consultants think are going to really dazzle you,
because they're boring and terminal.
How come they don't answer at the switchboard either?
Boy, I'm telling you, what a station they got.
I thought we were efficient here.
All right, let me try one more number here.
All right, six to five.
I mean, this place, they're all out to lunch
and it's only like 10 after 9 a morning out there or something.
How far good morning?
Yeah, I've been dialing the...
This is WYOD in Miami, New York, New York.
Roger's calling, we're on the air.
Uh-huh.
And we've been dialing on the airline
to try to get a hold of Alex Bennett, our good buddy.
Uh-huh.
And nobody answers the phone.
All right, hang in there.
Let me see what I can do for you.
Yeah, just for a second.
Are you Nick?
I'm Nick Rogers.
I know, you just called, right?
No, this is Neil Rogers.
That was Nick Lawrence, I just called.
Okay, hold on.
What was Nick doing?
He was calling, he was calling asking to speak to, um, lawyer, Alex.
And I had to inform her that they were doing the show
or something that would pass with them.
Well, we're doing a show too.
You and I are on the air right now.
We're just pretty exciting, right?
Well, that's great.
In Miami, even though Alex didn't like it,
we're not that bad.
Let me find out what's going on.
Well, wait a minute.
Let me ask you a question.
You want to ask me a question, okay?
Is that okay?
Sure.
What's the temperature there today?
The temperature right now is about 60,
oh, about 65.
It's rough human here in the city.
And it's going to get up in the 70s today,
which is like a heat wave for you guys.
Yeah, plus it's human.
We don't use the health community.
Well, it's like 87 here now.
Of course, it's 1213 here.
It's only 913 there.
Uh, we actually had a thunderstorm
and lightning in the south bay last night,
which is the rear.
Man, it sounds like pretty lousy weather.
Well, it's, it is lousy.
But, you know, it's exciting to us right now.
So how's Alex doing?
So how's Alex doing?
He's setting the world on fire there,
right? He's very big in San Francisco.
Yeah, he's doing pretty good.
For an old guy.
Yeah, he's doing pretty good.
Right now they think, um,
I don't know, some, we had a long show today,
and I don't know what really was happening,
but hey.
How about that studio audience?
The audience is good.
They've been pretty quiet though this week,
yesterday and today,
but usually they get kind of rowdy
and they get really excited and stuff like that.
But it's a good thing that they have going.
Yeah, well, like how many people come in every day?
Uh, let's say it's about 20,
as much as the studio can hold,
the studio isn't that big.
20 sun?
Uh, maybe one, not a, about to maybe 15.
How about like, can we go for five?
No.
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm poor.
You wouldn't like it.
And like, what are these like,
because the show starts at what,
536 in the morning?
6, 610, yeah.
So these people come in, what time?
Um, they usually, I guess, get here about to quarter of.
Quarter of 6?
Yeah.
And they line out, you know, I came by.
What are they like, street people?
Is that it?
Oh, wow.
I think what it is most of them are basically
to work in the evening or students or something.
Or the generous.
It's a different crowd.
Yeah.
I think, boy, you really have got that place pagged out.
How long have you been working there?
Um, I just came in.
I just came in about.
Oh, well, that's why you're so refreshingly honest.
About three weeks ago.
You haven't brainwashed you yet,
and they're giving out a lot of phony propaganda.
Right.
I used to, I used to.
In other words, you're doing okay.
But you wouldn't say.
I used to work in radio though before.
Another station.
What station was that?
Um, well, I...
Well, you can say it.
I mean, we're not on the air in San Francisco or on the air in Miami.
Oh, wow.
Are you still at KIA?
Okay. Well, that's a big station.
KIA, can you say for a while?
Well, the most Syracuse used to work there.
Right now.
You do?
Yeah, I know.
Did you ever, did you ever hear Joey Reynolds?
No.
Oh, thank God.
Is that you?
No.
I'm Neil Rogers.
You never heard of me either.
Oh, okay.
I hope.
Unless you listen to Alex bash me on the air out there until...
No, no, he doesn't bash.
No.
Alex loves Miami, don't he?
Yeah, he does.
No, he doesn't.
He hates us like poison.
He does love me.
No, he just celebrate what he's doing.
He just missed a barrier, I tell you.
He just celebrated.
He missed the gay area?
He's celebrated.
He celebrated it.
That's part of our show you should not say.
That's part of your show?
That's part of what he's going through this morning.
What is that?
Some article went on the air or something and...
What about how he does all that?
Some article was written and...
How he does all that gay bashing on the air out there?
Oh, yeah, and it's actually not him.
It's some...
We have different communities.
It's all those like Andrew Dush Clay and the...
All those people, Sam Kinnison, all those slimeball homophobic people.
Oh, oh, oh.
You don't go on here and...
Yeah, I'm going for it yet.
A bigger burden?
You should be in San Francisco right now.
I should?
Yeah.
Why is that?
They probably shoot you.
For what?
For what you just said.
They don't...
Well, not...
I'm not saying the whole San Francisco is like that.
For what did I say?
Probably get phone calls.
Andrew...
Where would you say that is?
Andrew Dush Clay.
Andrew Dush Clay.
Well, what's wrong with that?
That's like said with affection and love.
Oh, okay.
Now, anyway, you sidetracked me.
I can...
I talked to people like you before.
You like put me off on a witanja when I was really getting the heart of the matter.
Okay, so do you think we can get them on the air for a minute?
Well, yeah, let me try, okay.
Let me try to find its producer for you.
Yeah, and listen.
When you say neo-rodgers and if he starts throwing things,
don't get hysterical, okay?
Because he's a very emotional man.
I'll just tell him, look, I had a great conversation with him.
Yeah, we had some fun here, right?
Yeah.
I'll just tell him I had a great conversation with you.
Let me find him, okay?
Can I ask you a question?
Yes.
Because you and I have been talking now for what?
About four or five minutes?
Yes.
And am I keeping you from any other calls that are coming?
I can't believe it.
It's not ringing.
I know.
And if it's like a commercial radio station, right?
This is real.
Or is this just like a high school station or something?
Are you holding on my clothes or something?
Yeah, we put them on hold.
Did you?
All right.
Now let's see what Alex does.
Let's see when you mention my name.
I want to find out what kind of object he throws.
Let me run in there now and tell him why he's not in there.
Okay, because he'll go nuts.
Hang on.
Hang on.
This is great.
God, I haven't had so much fun since Joseph Yankee went left for vacation.
It's 1217 and WYOD.
We do have some open lines here.
I'll tell you that.
People are dropping off.
Now I got news for you.
If you think I'm going to preempt this great call for a lot of your crap,
you're dreaming.
We haven't talked to you anytime.
Is this not the show?
Does he play music?
He plays...
Why should I ask?
I thought...
What does he do?
In other words, he doesn't do a talk show.
He never did a talk show.
Oh, these bozos here, man.
They brought this guy in.
All he does is that...
Reducing is coming.
He'll be right with you.
Don't fall.
Wait a minute.
Are you busy?
Yeah, I have to answer another call.
Okay.
Hold on.
Okay.
You're on nobody.
Feel somebody.
I better get the right cards in the machine now.
Somebody loves you.
Oh, nobody.
Feel somebody loves you.
Get in the right mood.
You're nobody.
Feel somebody's hurt.
If I had the ability to do, I'd take you out here right now.
I'm taking your goddamn teeth in.
Here?
Yes.
Lori, how you doing?
I'm fine.
Let me hold on a second.
Yeah.
Take me to the back.
Down the water.
Yeah, cut that back a little bit back there.
We want to hear Lori.
We don't want to hear all that rock is rock.
Right, Lori?
Yeah.
We don't want to hear all that noise.
We call to speak to you.
Okay.
So what's going on, Lori?
Am I on the air?
Yeah, we're on the air on WIOD and Miami.
Alex's favorite station.
I see.
I see.
And there's this big article that somebody brought in from the Marin
Independent Journal, which I guess is one of your really big papers.
Yeah.
But it's actually been numerous papers.
Yeah, Alex is just that he was on TV, I guess, on Friday or last Friday.
I don't know.
He's just all over the place.
It's amazing.
And since he loved Miami so much and such a big fan of the station and me in particular,
I thought we'd call him and check in with him.
Well, actually, Alex can't talk about because he's on the air.
But I'm on the air too.
Well, I know, but he's going to be sure right now.
I don't think it'll really be appropriate at this time.
But I do appreciate your calling.
Boy, are you like blowing me off, or is that what you're doing?
I am because he can't really do it right now.
Well, wait a minute.
Did you tell him that I was on the phone?
He knows.
He knows I'm on the phone and that's why he won't come to the phone.
He said he doesn't do Smiley Markets.
He doesn't do smaller markets?
Well, I have his resume here and it seems to me that he once worked in Reno, Nevada.
Well, I'm just on the phone.
In San Rafael.
That's just what he told me.
Yeah, Alex.
I appreciate your calling anyway.
Well, wait a minute.
In other words, you're ending the conversation here because I have to get back to this.
So I can't ask you like what kind of a show he does out there.
He plays a lot of music or...
No, we do love it interviews.
But you don't really take phone calls on the air.
I'm sorry?
I say you don't take any calls on the air?
On the change we do.
But you just don't get many, right?
We do at times.
We can't really take all the calls because, you know, we're in a conversation with celebrities.
Right.
Well, like who's on today?
We had Roger Craig.
We had just one neighbor on the other day.
Wait a minute.
Like Roger Craig from the Giants?
Right.
Uh-huh.
Well, that's pretty exciting.
Well, they're doing it.
They're doing it.
Yeah, they're moving up a little bit.
And you had who?
You had Cisco and the E-Bird?
One E-Bird?
Boy.
Boy, you guys don't monkey around.
Well, tell them we're going to work real hard so one day we can work in a big market like that too, okay?
Okay.
Give them a big kiss on it, forehead, and tell them happy 50th birthday.
That's all right.
Okay.
Thank you.
Bye, Laurie.
Okay.
What a piece of crap.
A 20 afternoon at WID.
You know, it was a run of hope.
You didn't talk to smaller markets.
I got news for you.
The biggest market you were in in your life was publics.
Anyway, we have an open line in Palm Beach at 655 in the fruit section.
655-9463.
And we also have star IOD.
Talk to Cisco and E-Bird and Roger Craig.
Woo!
And the same day.
Boy, we had what the hell we need that.
We had Mike DeCello from Midway Airlines on it.
We don't need that crap.
Boy, oh boy.
So in other words, that...
Now, does that sound like a little hostile call to you?
I mean, would that be the understatement of the century?
Just a wee bit of hostility?
God, that sounded like talking to Rick Edwards.
21 past noon at WID.
And let's ask you a little question here.
Are you sick and tired of paying through the nose?
A guy who can't even have a little bit of fun.
A condescending mong head.
That's what we're dealing with, okay?
Okay, we've got lots of open lines.
I know that took a long time.
We've been screwing around, but that's too bad, okay?
Because to me, there was a lot more entertaining than talking to a bunch of skinheads.
We have an open line in Broward, 524WIOD, 1 in Palm Beach, 655 Fowler,
and the star IOD, of course, it's $400 a minute.
Let's go to a mobile and four-letter mail.
Wh...
You're still there.
I can't believe it.
I can't eat it.
I must do.
But it was well worth it, though, wasn't it?
I got a cheap car phone.
I can afford it.
I mean, what an experience that was.
Star I'm experiencing, Alex.
She sounded like his twin sister.
Surrily, hostile, inhospitable, humorless, psychotic.
God, I'm glad he went back.
You should have stayed.
He's done well if he continued.
Boy, I tell you, those people out there, they really know their entertainment, don't they?
They know the hot stuff when they hear it.
Alex's problem is I don't think he knows what big is, Renel.
He doesn't know what?
He doesn't know what big is.
Well, I don't want to get into his personal life.
Well, I know.
Oh, well.
That's what I tell you.
It's the greatest bitch you've done since you've been back.
Wherever the hell you went.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm still trying to figure out what the hell's going on.
Well, I was in San Francisco, hanging out with Alex in his crowd.
I thought I had a good time.
Must be very careful, Neil.
See him.
Take care.
26 past noon at WIOD and opening in Broward 524WIOD.
Who's that on the bad line?
Is that Alex calling back begging for our forgiveness?
That's a private corner.
WIOD.
Hi, I'm Conquaniel.
Sure.
Hold on.
WIOD.
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
Great.
Hey, listen.
You just got me in the mood for this, um, Neil Bogd for what?
For this, uh, what did they call it, uh, movies with their slack on top of the bread?
Letterbox, letterbox.
Come on, get weathered.
What kind of a slob are you?
I'm ready to do an expert.
I want to go watch a letterbox movie and send a coffee house, listen to beatnick music.
Yeah.
And ams to them.
There you go.
Moking heavy, heavy duty crap.
Hey, I never even seen a letterbox.
Smoking soap on a rope without the soap.
What is it?
He talked about that letterbox every day.
Well, I don't want to bring that in there.
It's like, uh, it's kind of like letterman.
It's the same thing.
It's like DCs.
Yeah.
All right, Neil.
I wish you would have got a hold of him, right?
No, to be honest with you, this was more fun.
It was.
In other words, we got the same effect without having to put up with his whiny, uh, crappy bull.
What did you say we can't speak to people in small markets?
He doesn't do small markets.
And he's got something that's small as a market.
Yeah, that's correct.
Have a good day.
Holden wrinkle, too.
And I don't mean his forehead.
See ya.
28 past noon at WYOD.
There's an opening in Broward.
If you move real fast enough, you want to get down on the hit parade.
And if you're real nice to me, I'll give you a Steve's numbers again from WABC.
That's cruel.
Why am I doing that?
Because I don't really have any big deal with Steve, but, uh, Puts wants to hear him again.
And of course, Puts wishes he'd have been in here to talk to Alex because he's one of his favorites.
He is so fond of Alex.
Uh, I got to see you.
Are you seeing this article?
When you get to that part about his 50th birthday, you'll really enjoy that.
And he's still, he likes Alex so much he has that picture of him right in his briefcase.
The one with the circle around it and the bullseye right over the middle of his forehead over that big bald spot.
Hollywood.
Hello.
Yes.
Hollywood.
Isn't that a...
No, this is Neil.
No, that's Neil.
This is Hollywood.
Sir.
Neil.
The amateur comics go on the Alex Beddetson.
I realize you've been...
You're right because I've been...
Oh, you're not nice.
We'll bring Eric Lambert back in with, uh, what's Larry Bremler?
No, I'll do that.
Would Larry Bremler in stereo?
No, I'll do that.
Okay, Neil.
Yeah.
Two things.
Where's Gilbert?
What is that supposed to be?
Yeah, all right.
Second off, on, on, on the point of Gilbert.
No, I don't want to, I don't want to discuss Gilbert.
Gilbert will be at our remote on the, uh, 24th of this month over at, uh, the stadium up there.
And we're doing the, another miracle game.
I just want to let you in on a little hint here.
Yeah.
He's been giving out stock tips.
And I've gotten two from him so far, and they both went up.
Well, I'm delighted for him.
Tickle to the second.
Call me green.
No, no, no, no, no.
I don't like her.
We have an open line in date, 751 Gilbert, 751, uh, yeah.
Uh, yeah.
Neil.
What do you want?
W-2-A-M.
This could be the worst call, even worse than Super Dave.
Okay, and that's saying a lot.
This is one of the worst calls in history.
W-Q-A-M.
We're talking about other people.
Talk about yourself.
They went to fishing.
Stopping like a quizzling, stopping an underling of other people.
Be a be your own person.
If Q-A-M went to 50s, does that mean IOD is going to 60s?
And NWS is going to 70s?
We're going to 1860s right after this call-ins, which is right now.
1230 at W-I-O-D.
Three open lines in a board.
Boy, which we were as popular as Alex Bennett.
What I wouldn't care.
I left my heart.
We have an opening on the star IOD line at $4,000 a minute.
If you have the guts to stand out in the crowd, see all you people are doing is hanging back and waiting for the day that I come on a year and say,
Hey, Bell South mobility finally got their finger out of their butt, and they got their act straightened out, and you can call that line and we pay for it now.
Now I got news for you.
We may not live that long.
Okay, any of us.
So I wouldn't hold back and wait.
Kendall.
How you doing?
Okay.
Hey, you know what?
Shortsman hasn't improved at all.
Shortsman?
Yeah.
That is Shortsman.
That's correct.
There you go.
Yeah.
And you know what?
Is producer?
She's great.
She's almost as similar.
Yeah, almost as pleasant as he is.
Yeah, we're Nick Lauren.
What a bitch.
No, I had got news for her.
Nick is a prize compared to her.
Oh, they're out there.
I mean, Nick wouldn't have wasted all that time and had just said, dropped in and hung the phone up, but she enjoyed digging and clawing.
Well, I have to get back in there and go in the air.
I think I'm going to, you know what I'm going to do in a few minutes.
I'm going to call the switchboard operator back up because she hasn't been there very long and she's the only one friendly enough to give us the real info.
There you go.
Because when I said, I hear he's setting the world on fire.
How's the show?
Oh, pretty good.
Pretty good.
Like, you could tell the way she's set it.
Like, they're not, you know, knocking the doors of the Golden Gate Bridge down there.
Well, how's the man?
There's something in the map.
I have to say whether it's going to be a year.
I heard there's a rumor that he's going to be doing the show with the live studio audience from Alcatraz that they're going to reopen it pretty soon.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
That's a great idea.
You know, Roger Craig.
I'd pay to watch that.
Yeah, Roger Craig is as big as comeback has been it.
Now, why would you say that?
Just because he's got a big snows like Joey is it?
I mean, he's a good buddy of Don Zimmer, so he can't be all bad.
Even though he's a boring guy.
You don't show someone up at the all-star game.
A boring guy and he brings out his own guy, Bradley, to lose the game for Cranae Island.
That was pathetic.
Anyway, let's not discuss baseball.
Okay, my team is one, two games in a row where she were just glowing in the aftermath of another great victory.
And we're doing it, boy.
We're only 16 games behind in about, I think, 15 under 5, 14 under 500.
What's wrong with that?
I'd rather watch the Cubs on a bad day.
We're full game ahead of the Cardinals and the hottest race in the National League.
We're a full game ahead of St. Louis.
What do you want from us?
Yeah, you don't mention the Cardinals, eh?
Well, I'd like to mention them a lot.
What a piece.
Just to remind everybody that they're a lot worse than we are.
And then, of course, there's the Yankees who are like 19 games under 500.
Or no, 23 games, I think.
Well, listen, can you give Bennett's new address on the air at that radio station so I can send him a piece of right-
Yeah, just send it to Alcatraz, Siamford, Cisco, California. It'll get there.
1233 at WIOD. There's an opening in date, 751 Bennett, 751 Alex.
Here's a mobile on the IOD line at 10 grand a minute.
Yes. Good afternoon, how are you, Neil?
Pretty good.
I have a question for you, please.
My wife finally getting into the show.
And I'm taking it this afternoon to get a Corvette.
Of course, a white one which you don't like the color.
Yeah.
I have never...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Who doesn't like the color?
Well, it's standard colors. I didn't get the green or whatever. I'm getting whatever most people get.
What's wrong with the white one? White Corvettes are beautiful.
Okay, well...
I have a white Corvette.
I, well, that's what I like. All my cars are white and this is another one.
Pedestrian.
I have a question, please.
In other words, you're kind of a boring guy.
Oh, well.
That's all right. You probably like vanilla ice cream, too.
Yes.
Vanilla bean speck ice cream like Johnny Dark.
Which I still have at my house from three summers ago.
But my question, please.
Yes.
2000 mile demo, untitled.
About what should it go for?
Untitled.
Untitled.
It means that they were driving it around.
Rather, you know, the wherever the deal was driving it around.
Yeah. Right.
What is it, a coupe?
Yeah, with the top that comes off.
