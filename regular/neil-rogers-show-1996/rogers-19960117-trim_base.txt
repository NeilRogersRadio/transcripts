This station stands for nothing.
The worst talk radio I've ever heard in my life is on WOT.
This is the most disgusting program.
I urge everyone to complain to this station.
Yes!
I don't believe her show.
Well, baby, just pack up all your things and go, go, go.
Go, cat, to go, to go.
Don't do the show, no.
Please go, cat, to go, go.
Just go, cat, to go, just go.
If you ain't that good.
She says the television is a big waste land.
Stop talking about your kids and you're done husband.
Don't clear me old Frank is a love machine.
You said I want more time and baby, I'm gonna scream.
A Monday night football, he's as good as dead.
That ain't much going on a little Frank.
He's head, go, go.
Go, cat, to go, go.
Let's reach to the show, no.
Just go, cat, to go, go.
Go, cat, to go, go.
Nobody's that good.
Go, go, go.
Go, cat, to go, go.
1106 at WIOT, we're only 24 minutes away from T-Day, baby.
I'll guarantee you everybody in the business is gathered around our radio right now.
They got the speaker cranked up so loud that it's just about giving them those goddamn good vibrations
that they're not getting from their drugs this morning because all the booze and all the pills
won't do it on ratings day, okay?
We got to crank the radio up and wait for Neil to give those numbers out.
Oh man, it's going to be ugly.
It's going to be a disaster.
It's going to be incredible.
And Neil won't like it.
That's what our PD says.
If it's not good, it's because Neil don't like it.
Here's Cooper City.
Hello.
You son of a bitch.
No, that's good.
That's worth waiting 45 minutes on air for.
That was really good pal.
That's that asshole again.
Two open lines and Broward five.
Here's the guy.
I want you to stop and think about this.
Here's a Julio up there wherever the hell he is who listens to the show every single day
who has no evidently no life, nothing to do.
And so his idea of calling the show is either to start calling and swearing and carrying on
or to repeat some little line like a little Julio Pyrrachite because he's gotten
an original idea in his mind.
So thank God I deserve like 50 bucks.
Oh and a male just started coming in by the way.
Just went through our first batch of male today and guess how many checks we got?
Oh, it's at zero.
Zipity new to Anada.
You would have thought yesterday after my impassioned plea that they would be running out,
rushing out to get their checkbook and poppin' those $20 checks in the mail to get us over
$150,000 total for center one and say thank you so much Neil.
We love you and certainly your show is worth a dollar a year for 20 years.
A bucket year.
That's a pretty good deal.
Two open lines and Broward five two four nine four six three two on the green lines one eight hundred nine four four W.
I.O.D.
Here's Miami Beach.
Hello.
Hello Miami Beach.
Yes sir.
Okay speaking hey God bless those customs agents but I think you should get a big bump in salary just
because you can speak English.
Yeah.
But that's another thing.
So you start with the bilingual thing you're already sure is that what you want to start about I heard Rick talking about
that you want to start a hawk and a china with this bilingual business which is the only kind of thing
people want to talk about in this town.
Now let's go back to the traveling.
Yeah.
Okay this is the place not to visit unless you already live here and you don't have a choice but to visit it all the time.
But as far as bubbling over toilet this could be it.
We have an open line at day 751 W.I.O.D.
We got two and Broward five two four nine four six three and two on the green lines one eight hundred nine four four oh God it's bad.
Hi are you afraid of going to hell and burning forever?
Are you afraid that you committed too many sins and that you will be turned away from the face of God?
I'm not.
If you listen to the Phil Henry show five days a week two to six in the afternoon on six ten W.I.O.D.
it won't happen.
Phil Henry two to six PM on news talk and entertainment radio six ten W.I.O.D.
I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.
He was son of a bitch.
1116 at W.I.D. I'm just reading in kings you see because I have a red this crap in many many years and it's just you don't know
what the laugh or cry when you read this stuff.
A wise ruling about the two prostitutes who came to the king.
Did you read that? Have you ever read that thing about the two hookers?
I mean so anyway just there seems to be an awful lot of beginning and begotting and prostitution and all this other and of course the
pillar assault and all this stuff and Sodom and Gomorrah and the the snore.
Let's do the handmaiden.
Yeah well you first.
Okay here's plantation.
Hello.
Hello Neil.
Yes sir.
Listen I was in the bathroom and I was digging a crap and I was wiping my ass and I decided to call.
We have an open line in Broward 5249463 and what on the green line?
1-800944.
Here's 4 Lauderdale on the purple line.
Hello.
Hey Neil.
Yes sir.
How you doing?
Okay.
I just wonder if anybody told you about sports talk on Monday night.
About what?
They actually had Doug McLean on.
Yeah.
Did you know that?
No I did not.
I was a shocker to turn the radio on the sports talk and not your football.
Well that's funny because I was driving out of the game last night.
I was listening to Hank and DeFos switching back and forth hoping to hear something about hockey and I did not.
I kept hearing about basketball and football and about this Hernandez kid.
Now we ought to have all Cuban players on the Marlins and nothing about the hockey game that was coming up that I was on my way to see.
It was like between 6 and 630 Mandage and Jeff were having a phone interview with him.
Yeah.
It was pretty good.
It was a nice change.
Uh huh.
All right Neil, deal with it.
What did Mandage have to say to Doug McLean?
I asked him a couple good questions about the players and what's happening and you know how being on a long road trip like that and coming back and all that.
It was pretty good.
Let me ask you how many games have managed in the DeFosena season?
I don't know.
Uh huh.
Do you want the answer?
Oh!
That's what I was going to get.
Oh!
That's it.
Okay, thanks for the good news.
See, it's good to have the coach on and start at least giving a little, you know, plug for hockey and the fact we had the game last night, that's good.
But if you would actually go see a game and have some idea what it's all about, then you're starting to move in the right direction as opposed to that little numb nuts over there on QAM
who in the morning, you know, goes to the game and sits up in a sky box up there with his buddies and schmuzzes with everybody while the game is going on and comes on to your next day to tell us what a great game Eddie Jovenoski played.
Who gave the puck away about three times, including a breakaway and nearly us, you know, and was also out there.
Any ice by the way in the last 30 seconds while the beas are got it screwed out of his shutout and did not play really that well last night.
But hey, we got some knowledgeable people down here.
I wonder what does it say in the chronicles about the hockey game?
Here's Palm Springs North.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Did you happen to listen to that to the show last night?
Would feel in Reverend Paul?
Yes, I did.
I heard it on the way to the game.
That guy was incredible.
What guy?
Reverend Paul, wasn't he?
Yeah.
I mean, he acted like he was some kind of a god.
Reverend Paul?
Yes.
And?
I just can't believe they could have someone on the show like that.
So in other words, you believe there is such a person as Reverend Paul.
Is that what you're saying me?
You're as dumb as those people that were calling and getting all of a sudden about whatever is made.
In other words, you believe there is such a person as that man that was...
You heard the voice you heard on the phone.
Is that what you're telling me?
The guy that was on the station last night.
The guy that was on with Phil last night.
You believe the one that started hiccuping and crying and boozing and whatever else he was doing.
You believe that there was such a person.
Is that what you're saying, sir?
No, the guy that was talking the pasture.
The pasture?
Yes.
I think you ought to see greener pastures, Paul, because you're a moron.
How do you like that?
All I had to do was start reading a little from the Bible here and he's talking about this pasture
that was on with Phil last night, huh?
The pasture.
This guy's grazing for information is what he's doing.
Oh, Phil, Henry, I'll tell you one thing.
My friend, my genius of a friend, which he is.
We'll never run out of material in this town.
They manufacture morons.
They got a plant somewhere.
They got a gigantic plant in sweet water.
And it's like stamping out God damn my pennies at the mint, at the U.S. Mint.
They just stamp them out by the million.
Morons.
Idiots.
Oh, God, Almighty, help us.
Please, somebody throw us that rubber raft before it's too late.
He's upset about the pasture that was on last night saying all those things.
Incredible.
Incredible.
News talk.
An entertainment radio.
Sixton, W-I-O-D.
Kill the Coal.
Here's unacceptable sacrifices, by the way, from Leviticus.
The Lord said to Moses, speak to Aaron and his sons into all the Israelites and say to them,
I want you to follow this because a lot of you aren't paying any attention, okay?
If any of you eat through an Israelite or an alien living in Israel, is that illegal alien?
Presents a gift for a burnt offering to the Lord, either to fulfill a vow or as a free will offering.
You must present a male without defect from the cattle, sheep or goats in order that it may be accepted on your behalf.
Now I understand why the people in Lutz have been reading their Bible.
That's why they're so close with their sheep and their goats and their cattle.
Do not bring anything with the defect because it will not be accepted on your behalf.
When any offering to the Lord to fulfill a special vow or this is the best part or as a free will offering,
it must be without defect or blemish as to be acceptable.
Do not offer to the Lord the blind, the injured or the maimed, or anything with warts or festering or running sores.
I guess that leaves war, man, out.
Nothing with warts or running sores.
Even if you bring them like a little hunchback, it has to be the most perfect hunchback that you can find.
And a male.
Oh, and a male, of course, because we don't want to sacrifice no women or children.
Well, that comes later.
Here's Miami. Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
What's up, man?
I'm a new listener, you know.
I mean, I listen to Phil for like a year, but you know, I'm just home early this week, so I've been listening to you.
You're great, man.
Yes, I am.
Now, I'm a good Jewish boy, and I'm just like you, you know.
Yeah.
Oh!
Well, at least this guy is clean anyway, circumcised.
George, he's not walking around with his own.
Lemon.
He's not walking around with his own.
Lemon, he's got his own.
Even the Lord in here says he tells you, he tells you, he's got.
He's not walking around with his own.
He's not walking around with his own.
He's not walking around with his own.
He's not walking around with his own.
He's not walking around with his own.
He's not walking around with his own.
He's not walking around with his own.
He's not walking around with his own.
He's not walking around with his own.
He's not walking around with his own.
He's not walking around with his own.
He's not walking around with his own.
He's not walking around with his own.
That's the thing you've been saying about those checks.
What are those for?
The checks.
What are they for?
Is that for center one?
That's right.
Okay, because I bought Phil's CD yesterday.
Right.
And, you know, I just thought it was a little expensive, but I didn't know it was for a good product.
For charity.
Oh, okay, then, then I'm going to.
In fact, Phil's at 20 bucks, Phil's CD is like the greatest bargain in history.
That's true.
It's so funny.
I listened to it last night.
Of course, I noticed you didn't buy mine though.
I'm going to buy mine though.
No, no, no.
That's okay.
I don't take those things personally.
I'm going to buy the best.
It's hysterical.
It's funny.
I have your tape from last year.
Oh, I see.
Okay.
That's good.
That's a good friend.
Yeah.
And I'm going to go buy yours.
Please.
Do it today.
Why do you got all this time on your hands?
I got it.
Cash, you know.
All right.
And happy porn to you, pal.
Bye-bye.
Have a great life.
Andy's walking around here with a real psychotic look on his face.
We have an open line data.
Are they coming down yet?
Are they downloading or what?
Haven't seen him yet.
But those numbers.
Oh, well, let's start reading from numbers.
Thank God for left his Bible.
I still got my Bar Mitzvah Bible somewhere in the house.
I'm going to dig that thing up.
And inside that Bible, I told us to fill yesterday and it's a true story.
Inside the Bible, I have saved four.
Let's see.
How many years was it?
16 years now.
1980.
Dick Casper, the general manager at WNWS, received a letter from Archbishop McCarthy
of the Miami Catholic Archdiocese who besieged him, not to renew Neorodger's contract.
Because he is so sacrilegious and disgusting and vile, invulgar, etc. and so on.
At which point we signed a new deal.
How do you like that?
Here's the Archbishop of Miami trying to bring pressure on my boss.
Don't rehire him because he knocks the church and what he tells is too painful because it's true.
In addition to which a lot of these closeted priests are getting real nervous.
And it's muscling on their time and their action.
So I think I'm going to have to dig out my own personal Bible.
Because I got like, see, one thing I did do.
I didn't tear that one up, but I have a lot of stuff marked in there in ink.
Like different, really interesting passages.
So I don't have to waste my time like I am today going through this kind of pristine look in the Bible.
Nice one that fills God.
Here's Daniel B.
Hello.
Hey.
Yes, sir.
How you doing, man?
Okay, sir.
I think that, well, I don't think, but who do you think between Shane Thomas and Joe Zagaki?
Who has the title of a vagina?
We have an open line in Broward, 5249463, 524WLD.
Something we'll probably have to think about for a while.
Here's Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Can't hear you.
Can't hear you at all.
Yes?
Can you hear me now?
Yes.
All right.
I got a little report on the beautiful traffic down here.
Can you hear me?
Not good.
I don't know.
I'm at a hospital pay phone.
Oh, pay?
A hospital pay phone.
Take it into intensive care immediately, pal.
It needs surgery.
Actually, I'm going to be going up there soon.
Yeah.
Listen, up some down in the hospital in North Broward.
I'm behind the car.
So when you get out, the wheeling, I guess,
you're husband and a wheelchair towards the car.
If you walk around open to the passenger door,
then I put him in the passenger's head.
No.
Can't understand a word you say.
There's another good.
Sorry, I had to cut you off, pal, but I'm sure you had a great story.
Well, maybe not.
But can't understand a freaking word you're saying.
Another pay phone, like I said, there's one of the biggest scams going.
Is anybody going to do anything about it?
No.
Put your cord in now.
That'll give you about 30 seconds worth of conversation.
And I'm sorry, but you're a quarter.
The operator comes down with that stupid message.
You've got to keep popping quarters in there.
Like on to the goddamn video arcade, and you're about halfway through the movie.
Oh, sorry, no more change.
And all of a sudden, you don't even feel the change no more.
Do you know what I'm saying?
Let's go to a mobile in Croll Springs.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Here you loud and clear.
Hi, Neil.
This is Mike, your buddy from the hockey games.
A few rows below you there.
Yeah.
I just, I didn't know if you addressed this issue.
I just turned John this morning, but I just want to say the worst part about what I feel is a lack of fan support and enthusiasm over the panthers.
It's the worst part about it in three months when they're in the playoffs.
You're going to see all these jackasses jumping on the vanway.
Right.
And you might even see clowns like Mandage and D-fo and some of these other sports guys who never can't have been in three years to one single game.
All of a sudden, they'll be starting to show up because they're going to be covering the playoffs.
And they'll pretend like they know something about it like they really care.
And they're going to be experts on it too.
And maybe even fat hank.
Anyways, just wanted to throw in my two bits. Have a good day.
Okay.
All right, follow up.
We have an open line in Broward.
5249-463-524.
But the people there are very set in their ways.
They're recalcitrant.
They don't like trying new things.
They're not even into like a prego spaghetti sauce because they don't like trying new things.
Okay.
They like that generic stuff that comes out of a big can.
Here's West Palm Beach.
Hello.
Hey Neil.
Yes sir.
What's happening there?
Not much.
Good.
I was at the game last night.
Yeah.
Strong game, but he shouldn't have gave that one up at the end.
He shouldn't have gave that one up.
The goal of the last one.
How about the fact that team shouldn't have been standing around like they were in a coma
the last minute and a half and blowing a shutout for him.
How about that?
That's true.
It's happened many of times.
They stood around there and I kept saying what is going on here.
They're going to blow the shutout.
Yeah.
You could smell it coming from a mile away.
Sure could.
Hey listen.
I'm based on the arena.
Right?
If the chances were they ever built this one out in sunrise.
Yeah.
Which I don't think they ever will.
Probably not.
The attendance with Skyrocket.
Skyrocket basically.
Maybe.
Yeah.
The arena.
The Miami.
That's Skid Row.
No kidding.
You just discovered that?
Is that a bulletin?
The arena is not in a good neighborhood folks.
We just had a call about it.
You said it's Skid Row.
You just discovered it.
Listen.
I think we're going all the way to play off.
I'd say.
I would go into the playoffs.
You're predicting that like that.
You're going out on a limb?
No.
We got 60 points already.
We got 60 points 83 or 4.
I'll make the playoffs.
We can lay down and close our eyes and make the playoffs now.
Yeah.
But just like that last guy said, come time to playoffs.
Everyone's going to drop the ball.
All the phoneies will be out there.
Yeah.
All the real big fans waiting to jump on the bandwagon.
Manwitch and your other friends.
Yeah.
They'll all be there.
Even Fat Hank will be there looking for a free manwitch or sandwich.
For a free hot dog.
Exactly.
All right, Neil.
See ya.
Yeah.
He'll be looking for a free weeny.
Well, maybe so.
Where's the numbers?
What is she shaking her head for?
Not yet.
Not yet.
What?
It's 1133 in the Eastern time zone, sweetheart.
They were supposed to be coming down at 1130.
That said, go look.
Come on.
I know you didn't have a stressful drive to work this morning.
You should be in a good mood.
You're going to get some pretty soon.
If you pay me enough to shut me up.
I'm going to smile on her face.
Oh, she met a wonderful guy.
A guy.
Yeah.
Try a guy this time, will you?
Those Jews will kill you.
Especially the ones that are, well, I don't want to talk about the engineer like that.
We have an open line in the purple line, pound Iodine.
We have one on the green line in Palm Beach.
1-800-944-9463.
Where are those numbers, boy?
They're sure dragging us out.
I know a lot of you out there think I'm holding back.
I'm not.
I mean, take your Pepto Bismal right now and also get the Maylocks ready and get your guy
down a little squeeze bag.
It's going to be a real nervous time.
I know that the people over at Waxe are listening.
My friend, Mike Rineri and Henry Barrow and Roger Magdalene and Ron Harrison and all those
go in.
And people from Lightball probably know him.
Kent, who fancies himself as a broadcaster, which he is not.
He's listening right now.
And everybody else goes, see, at the other stations generally speaking, they don't tell them what's going on.
Especially stations that can't afford to subscribe to Arbitron and don't even have the book.
So they don't really get too much information, although maybe they get it out of the newspaper,
like a dare to later.
I wonder how Melissa Ruggieri and that other bitch, how they're doing right now.
Maybe Debbie Wilker, right another column on the radio, if Howard breaks the five this time.
So see, it's not just me.
Howard's lost touch with his audience and Rick and suds have lost touch with theirs.
And I'm losing touch with mine, which I'm looking for right now and Phil has certainly lost touch with his being the heathen bastard that he is.
Although we do know that he is a deep abiding faith in the Lord and Christ.
Remember the guy the guy called and told him that?
In fact, that was on the voicemail, the fact that being a real Catholic, the way that Phil is, he has a great faith in, oh Jesus.
Seriously, if you could sell stupidity by the ounce, you could sell this town for like a trillion dollars.
Here's South Miami. Hello.
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir.
Hey, what's going on?
Yeah, that was pretty good. Why not?
And he won't be on the air again.
Ever, ever, ever again.
Because you know, they reach his point.
When you get, you just don't have anything else to do in your life that finally there has to be some way to discourage it like just dump it out, when it doubt, dump it out.
Because we're tired of your pad, you're a jerk, you're a schmuck.
You are an asshole.
We have an open line on the green line, 1-800-944-9463-18944-WIOD.
Did I mention more of 138 grand for Santa one now?
That total is creeping up.
We keep finding like little checks on the floor on the ground, little over here, little over there.
138,042 bucks. We still have like 14 days, which is two weeks to go to get to our goal of 150 grand.
I'm pretty sure we can do it now.
And of course, those $20 checks for Santa one that you're going to send into me.
I bet you that mail bag is going to be loaded, baby.
Thank you for 20 incredible years on here in Miami.
Here's a dollar a year, $20 for that great charity, Santa one.
Just to say thank you, Neil.
I bet you those checks to WIOD, Miami, 331-41 are going to be pouring in here every single day from now to the end of the day.
You think so? No?
Here's a Jamaica lady. Hello.
Wait a minute. Where the hell is she? Hello.
I'm going to call my mom. Can't hear me. Can I call her?
I beg your pardon.
My mom's going to hear me. Can I call her?
What do you mean she can't hear you?
I have to get her. She's on the patio.
She's what? On the patio.
She's on the potty?
Patio.
Is this a potty line?
Or are you a potty mom?
How about you making a person, Miami?
I am on.
What?
I said, yeah. What would you mean you got to call your mom for what?
Does she want to talk to me or something?
You said me when you talked to her.
What is it? You said you.
No, I don't want to talk to her.
Oh, look at the look on her face.
Did you look at him?
I got a glimpse.
Do you look at it?
Yeah.
Well, she's all smirking, which can mean one of it.
Well, these are 35 to 64. We're starting out with the...
Oh, look at that. We got a little nudge here.
We got a little nudge.
I knew it would come back around.
No, you did not. Yes, I did.
No, you didn't.
Hey, we could only go up.
Based on what? The tremendous response we've had on the phone lately?
Based on we couldn't go down.
We couldn't go down.
We couldn't go down any.
With this guy at the helm here, we couldn't go down.
I can't even find the damn thing.
So 35 to 64, radio romance.
It's another spick book here.
7.8 radio romance is numero uno.
I mean, there is so far ahead of the rest of the pack.
Maybe the rest of us might start taking Spanish lessons.
Buenos dias amigos.
Como está.
Happy Oho Deano.
Life is second. 5.3.
Hot is turd. A third. 5.0.
These are 35 to 64. In other words, these are...
W-A-M-R. What is that?
I don't even know what that is.
Do you know what that is?
W-A-M-R-F-M?
Huh?
Oh, it says...
Oh, that used to be W. Supercube.
They used to be QB-A-F-M.
Now it's W-A-M-R. If anyone went up from a 360 to a 49.
They're like number four. They're like hovering right under their hot.
So in other words, of the first four stations so far,
three of them are ethnic and the other one is slush for dead people.
Life.
Now, of course, this is 35 to 64.
Number five is magic. With a 4.9 about static,
they had a 5.9. Well, let's start looking at the N-W-Y-O-D went from a 39 to a 42.
Oh, 35. So we got more old people.
Let's start doing topics again.
We've lost touch with our younger audience.
Let's start doing the topics.
Oh, Rick Riley, you're out there listening right now.
Aren't you, Rick? Hang on tight.
I think their bonus is based on 35 to 64 if I'm not mistaken.
Hallelujah. Oh, happy day. There is a God in spite of what I've been saying.
Oh!
From a 3-8 to a 4-3.
All the way up to number one, two, three, four, five.
Number five. Just behind... Oh, look at that.
What is AMR? Did they also change format?
QB AFMers, it's still a campy supercue because they took the cue out.
What is their format? Floor mat.
We don't know. We'll find out. They got a 6-9.
They must be doing something heavy duty because they used to do crap and now they're like rocket and rolling.
Amigos.
Radio romance is tied with them number one in the morning, 6.9.
Radio Mambe is... Look at that. We got all spick stations out here.
And right behind them is the EDR.
So of the non-ethnic stations, 835, 64, Rick and Suds are number one.
4.3, 35 to 64.
Howard's down there with a 3.3.
What can I say?
How about midday? Do we dare take a look at this?
Uh-oh.
From a 5.2 to a 5.8.
We got lots of old farts out there.
Let's start being nice to the old people.
We love you folks.
Just because you got a colossal new bag and you're walking around with a walker
and you're out there driving 10 miles an hour, we love you.
Radio romance with a 7.7 and life with a 7.1.
The only ones that beat us out were all the way up to number three with four bullets
in 35 to 64, followed by the coast, followed by a radio AMR.
We got somebody, some spick please call us in and tell us.
What is it?
Line two.
Important information.
Okay, hello.
Neil. Yes sir.
A AMR is doing the same thing as a radio romance.
Radio, so we got two radio romances and they're both kicking ass.
Listen.
Are they playing Luis Miguel?
I've got only no.
13 non-Hispanic LA stations headed by KLOS
are taking Arbitron to task for over sampling the Spanish format stations.
Oh, all right.
And you know something, if the management in this market had any balls,
they would do the same thing.
So that looking you January 22nd, RBR.
Okay.
But I'm fact yesterday.
Thanks.
Okay, there's a radio guy.
Closer radio guy.
So okay, let's see how about Phil Henry.
I bet you know, where's Andy?
Is Andy on the floor?
Andy says Phil goes to pieces with these numbers.
Andy is hyperventilating and making gurgling sounds.
Well, Phil had a little increase there from a 3.4 to a 3.8.
Oh!
But we got radio romances.
The number one in the afternoon and then a life and hot and the magic and coast and T.
T.M. T.M.
My.
Oh, Scotch, what a God.
With a 4.7 in the afternoon.
They're all listening to classes.
They're listening to Beethoven and Bach.
Can you believe that?
And then WXDJ.
What is that?
That's Russell Ways is another one of his pieces of crap.
Isn't that also a Spaniol?
I think.
And then kiss.
Oh, Kiska.
Now what about QAM?
How are they doing?
3564.
I haven't seen WQAM anywhere here.
Are they still on the air or what?
Oh, 1.8 down to a 1.6.
They're dropping.
How can they afford to drop anymore?
My.
My.
I'm going to owe points.
And what about Reniri?
Now this is more Mike's demographic.
Let's see how about Waxi because they begged me.
Please give us our numbers.
I would if you had one, but I don't.
All right, let's go to come on.
It's got to be on here somewhere.
FTL in the morning.
Norm can't.
A zero.
He's got a 0.5.
Nice number there.
Normie.
And this is your.
No, I'm sorry.
This is 35 to 64.
We don't have the death plus 10 demo yet.
I'm looking.
I'm looking.
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
He's got a 0.9 down from a 1.1.
But he don't care.
He's making some money.
Good luck to you guys.
Okay.
Congratulations for getting out of here.
And how about the sex bitch at night?
35 to 64 is too old for.
How about the weekend?
Oh, the weekend ought to be real interesting now.
Let's take a look at the weekend numbers.
The weekends are deadly on WIOD where we must have gone through the roof.
I can't find this.
Well, let's.
Let's try the night at first.
Okay.
She went from a 3802.2.9 at night.
Well, that's these old parts.
They don't want to hear about sex because they can't do it anymore.
They get depressed.
How about the weekend?
Okay, we're not on the first page.
Oh, we got a 2.8.
That's with the dolphins.
That's with a whole fall book of the dolphins.
We went from a 2.5 to a 2.8.
So I guess the PD is safe for another book.
God damn it.
It's 11.
But where's the right one?
She gave me this one thing.
Where's the rest of the stuff?
Come on, Cheryl.
She brings me the one demo that we probably did good in.
The rest of the stuff they just dropped in the toilet
and somebody accidentally flushed it.
Use talking entertainment radio.
610.
W-I-O-D.
Okay, 11.55 at W-I-D.
What the hell is wrong with the sex bitch at night?
I'm actually a lesbian.
It could be a problem because she's the only one she went down.
Yeah, there he is.
But his arm's up in the air.
We got a kiss.
We went up.
We had a book.
But I don't see no 25 to 54 yet.
Did those go up too?
Were you open up that thing, twerp,
and let's hear what the other twerp's got to say.
Did they go up?
Is that it?
That's it.
Talk.
You're huge.
No, I'm not.
You want to see.
You'll change your tune real fast, sweetheart.
What do you mean?
We had a good 25 to 54.
All right.
Oh, geez, man.
I'll tell you how much did we pay the guys off this time, huh?
You just know this is bogus.
Like I said, we knew we were making a big comeback.
We were out here taking off his pools up and everything
and everybody said, in fact, feel already called in sick.
And now we just said he started feeling better.
12 plus we had a nice, if Rick is listening,
put away the mill town.

Okay, 6 to 10 in the A.

W.
No, we finally got a kiss, okay?
We got some wired diaries in here.
We made out.
All right.
Now we're having a party.
Okay.
Who's doing it in the morning?
12.
Let's see.
Howard must have gone.
Howard went back up from a three five to a four point.
Oh!
So that'll be a big story.
That'll be something to write about, huh?
Although it's not the four point four we had during the summer.
And during the midday here, 12 plus, from 10 to three,
from a four eight to a five point one,
between 10 and two.
We're doing almost a six year here.
12 plus.
which is number three in a market with a five one and which is right on the heels of life and
Aradio romance we can't compete with a slush station and we certainly can't compete with a
spick station but other than that we're like kicking everybody's ass alright even though we've lost
we've lost touch and contact with the audience on this show how do you like that feel Henry from
a two eight to a three one plus but the sex bitch what the hell is the problem with that

the blues we know we're in the toilet but the numbers are accurate they're all accounts except there's
too many Julios with diaries out there getting five bucks for an ethnic diary and too many black people too

tell Mama Sita and Papa Sita that you really are straight you just you know got confused it was

so anyway 12 15 at w i o d rick riley is so excited about these numbers i just have never seen
anything that vivid and that massive i'll bet especially in the morning but anyway look at
that six to ten a a men 25 to 54 we they don't have the overall like they're doing this piece
meal and she'll keep making up stories because they're trying to figure out if we made the bonus
or not and then if we did they're gonna hide him when we will never get the number men 25 to 54 in
the morning let's see howards down oh looking at howards down from an 8.8 to a 7.7
zetas from a five two all the way up to a 6.5 i told you the podcast you know what was the talent
didn't i radio amor that's what w a m r f m is that's uh oh look at that they went from a one
three is qba fm to a 6.1 look at that they battered the crap out of radio romance they're probably
playing more lewis mighel probably all the facts are list i mean the amada kona's i mean the
6.1 and then fourth with a 5.5 rick and so i'm from a 4.8 man in a summer book where we just uh
the spring and the summer just go into crapper you know what i'm saying but in the fall we make a big
comeback because some of our people come back from out of town maybe that's what it is maybe our
people just all go away like those fun places like uh santo domingo like la dominica la la republic
a dominica and uh jameka man and stuff like that anyway w i o d in the morning 5.5 and how it's got a
7.7 and men looks like they're getting closer and closer every second maybe they don't like those 20
minute breaks that how he's doing then from 10 to 3 in a midday in men w i o d number one as we
always are in men in the midday i got my men i'll tell you that that's all i got but i got my men
from a 6.9 in the summer book to a 9.4 which means between 10 and 2 we're over a 10 in men it rhymes it
sounds good to me zeta is next w x d j hot kiss radio romance no i don't get that how come in the
morning uh more is big but they don't want to do it in the midday uh how's that radio roll where
the hell is it uh it's not even oh it's like with a 3.6 i guess and what do they got on in the
morning they got like people on there like personalities like celebrities like bow and uminty
bow jangles or something like that oh i'm sorry they got fired at power let's see men 25 to 50
40 afternoon radio romance beats everybody to a pulp with a 6.1 that's when they start heavy duty
Luis Miguel rotation edr a 5.8 hot 5.7 and the number one english language stationed in the
afternoon and men with a 5.7 is the Phil Henry show yeah but but nothing no buts baby so it's safe
to come in fill the coast is clear night time know what are we going to do about that poor sex broad
you know what i'm saying in men from a 4.5 down to a 4.2 just uh just kind of like uh fun a little
long there but that's you know that's okay even though we can't sell that show so there it is we're
still waiting on a 25.50 for which is the only number i really care about and George is like hanging
out there with his tongue down to his puppet because we want to see if we really got lucky big time
and got a little bonus coming but she don't want to bring that in here she don't want to bring that
in here because uh all kinds of excuses all kinds of stories you know what i'm saying there's all
kinds of stories on the street that's what clemenza said look what it did for him that fat clemenza
we have two open lines in brown or five two four w i do this is a day that everybody in the audience
should be celebrating dancing in their pants all our loyal iod listeners both of them is that finally it
you miserable it's not her fault though but you are close and convenience it was easy to take it out on
it oh here's women well we can kind of figure it out can't we i bet you we did a zero in women huh
oh my god look at that we got screwed George we got screwed 1.6 in women
a what 1.6 so that's an 11 but that again keep in mind that's from uh 10 to 3
so we could be right on the verge there you know what i'm saying we could be doing a 5.5
we're gonna get screwed you can just smell it you can feel it we're gonna do about a 6.25 to 54
thanks to the fact we got no women we went down in women from a 2.5 to 1.6 see the one time we get lucky
the one time we get a break the one time we get a kiss we get our big kisses from men which is a
hell of a lot better to me but the women don't want to give us no kiss i told you there's no women
out there we can't find a woman for love or money look at that in the morning we probably don't
have any women either i'm on a second page i'm on a third page i'm looking frantically for some
women rickan suds a one nine down to a one three in women the women have let us down too much sports
that's okay we're gonna talk sports coming out your ears because the man wanting here sports
they men are macho and probably the few women we got listening are pretty butch too
isn't that a kick in the teeth from a 2.5 and women if we just kept our 2.5 we'd have it linked George
but a 1.6 and what about fill in the afternoon those women who've got to have a great sense of
humor right they don't hot with an 8.0 oh do you got all ethnic women feels not on a second page
either one five down to a one two so we all went into crapper with the women and what about Aaron
how maybe she found herself a girlfriend seven of midnight Aaron summer show q a m with a point
four at night oh of course that's women 1.3 from a one seven to one three so the entire radio
station with the women disappeared if we don't had just just a just a reasonable our usual mediocre
number of women we would have kicked everybody's ass if we just do it i had our usual reasonable but we
don't now what else am i looking for whom i leave it out here oh yeah what about q a m what about
the men in the morning on q a m let's take a look for them overall they went from a 3.0 to a 2.7
and men there that's the sport station that's the male intensive station now let's see what about
q a m in the morning i don't see them on the first page here where the coast is on the bottom
i don't know look at that 3.2 to a 3.4 which they went up like a fraction marginally but they
came to four they head back in the winter but it's still a little bit better so the little dogs
got the only number and men there in the morning on that station that's because they'd like that big
gap in his teeth what about in the middle of the day to wait to a 3.9 oh the sports bitch she's
the one oh that must be lardass i betcha that's what that is lardass must have finally found an
audience to wait to a 3.9 you know it's not the sports bitch that's for damn sure and like what
oh no wait a minute what what what no no that's not right that's not even it six to ten it
Bob Green is put six a m to seven p m in here somebody go shoot him will you we don't care
about six a m to seven p m what about you the rose mice do there in the morning okay six to ten
the little dog the guy with a big gap two three to a two four i should have known better okay
now what about ten to three in the mid oh this thing is all screwed up this thing is all
screwed up is what it is six to ten in the morning is this boring you folks too bad we don't
care we don't care you're used to it q a m six to ten in the morning men it's the sports station
okay i'm waiting to get to Hank q a m in the morning i'm looking and i'm looking and i'm looking
and i'm looking here Joe i can't find your number Joe i don't find it nowhere here it is
two eight that was right two eight to a 3.9 now that's in the morning two eight to a 3.9
he's a hit he's a hit Andrew asking the woods and Joe Rose to wait to a 3.9 in men
now in the midday how come we can't find them in midday with q a m are they still on the air or what
two three to a two four i see that's what it is so larga didn't go nowhere in the sports bitch
ain't doing nothing and what about in the afternoon now let's see feels got a five seven in men
what about the fatso over there what about mr hot shot that's gonna go on here and open them
up today like he got a book five one to a four four filled beat him by like over a point
huh so that's uh the way that's the lay of the land boy that was sure boring wasn't it and
she still hasn't brought in the twenty five to fifty four which it's gonna be about a five four
to a five six ten to three we're like right on the edge we're right on the borderline of greatness
of like a few extra bucks and cash but it'll never happen they'll finagle it you know how they do it
Hence
When they tell me call me melanoma I tend until I'm almost in a coma
How I eat my amy and they never ever use any sunscreen
Sun with me, tan with me, hope we don't mind I'm a little broccoli
I ain't this until we get melanoma, we date like a bun you can sell the aroma
Our lights are all long but there's nobody more
We're planning that when I get off on go tanning
I get naked and fake baked kids
How much longer is my skin gonna take it?
My astrologist and numerologist have to help me find a dermatologist
If I in the sun till we get melanoma
We bake like a bun you can sell the aroma
Our lights are all long but there's nobody more
Hey melanoma
We lie in the sun till we get melanoma
We bake like a bun you can smell the aroma
We got lunch on our skin bigger than a metroidoma
Hey melanoma
We don't care if we get melanoma
We got the best tan from here to Arizona
We're livin' don't have genital condoloma
Hey melanoma
1228 at W.I.O.D.
So anyway 25 to 54 there's that big head-on match between what's his name
But the him and fat hamster the the a hammer
And 25 to 54 persons overall fill his God
What does he got?
Look at that.
She went down at 934 to a 2A 254 the sex broad
Since they find since he said that thing about being a lesbian
And they have flown away from her like
So anyway W.I.O.D.
In the afternoon 25 to 54 up from a 27 to a 3.4
And the hammer the hamster over there he's got from a 26 down to a 2.3
So filled beats delivered pants off of him
As he should but by a much bigger margin of this racquet which it is not
Because anybody that would choose to listen to the hammer over a fill Henry and the ingenious stuff
He's got on here has to be a total moron or just like fat people
W.I.O.D. midday from a 4.1 to a 5.4 from 10 to 3 which means we're doing we're pushing about a 6 from 10 to 2
Which quite frankly that ain't too shabby on this guy day on an AM station with no promotion
And all this and on this a stayed place in which we work that don't have a billboard a TV spot a goddamn
Jervil out there running around nothing
So I think we ought to be pretty excited about that and Rick and spot even in the morning
Which is really a miracle considering if you've heard that show
Rick and sorry Rick
Rick and suds in the morning from a 2.8 to a 3.3 3.2.5 to 54
Oh!
And what is that?
What is it? It's a per oh you got more stuff here boy
I'm telling you 25 to 49 if you keep coming up with enough different demos see everybody all keep them coming okay
It'll kill some real good time
No, I don't what do you mean no I don't
I don't yes, I do yes, I do the women by the way sucked and George said that's good
Oh 18 plus no, I don't have that I got 12 plus the women really bit the big one 25 54 if we would have had just our usual
Two point whatever we would have been just raking in the door we would have kicked him ass
But we can't find women for lover money
Doesn't bother me
So anyway 25 to 49 WIOD from a 3.2 to a 3. So this is the CDs oddball demos nobody cares about this
Even the people on the year don't care about that what about 75 plus what about the FTL audience can we find that one
See if you can find 100 plus for norm
Here's Jupiter hello
Jupiter
Speak to us is just a asshole in Jupiter yanking it. Here's the lady in Miami. Hello. Neil. Yes, ma'am. Good afternoon. How are you?
Buenos tardes Buenos tardes. Come on stop. We be in gracias. Oh
Multibany. Oh, I'm married to a Julio. That's why I speak Spanish. All right
He doesn't listen to radio amor or radio romance does he? No, I make him listen to you
Good for you and feel Henry is he circumcised? No, how about Phil? I don't know
Do you know if you ever saw he looks like kind of a skinhead to me, but we'll find out
Okay, listen. I went to the hockey game last night and my gourd Murphy. He played awesome
You're gourd Murphy. Yeah, how did he?
Murphy is definitely our best defenseman make no mistake about that. He is awesome solid is a rock
Yeah, I'm getting educated on my hockey and I got a book and I read about the Stanley Cup great and
Originally it was bought in 1890s by the governor of Canada for $50 right?
I don't know where he got it from and he went to the King of England and he said
don't be 50 dollars. Oh
Yeah, and
There's some really cute legends and there are some guys that were celebrating with the
The cop and they had in the trunk of the car and they got a flat tire
Yeah, took out a trunk to put on the side of the road the fixer tire and they left and they forgot to take the cop and when they came back
Yeah, Jim Manard told me one time he left his cup and the truck and had the same kind of experience and I put it on right out there on God
They mind I'd be five. Oh gosh people were in shock. What could I tell you not much?
Okay, so what are we gonna do about finding some women sweetheart? All these women are calling?
I'm trying my best. I'm not just talking about you though
We have to like more than a couple we got to go out there and get some women with a sense of humor
We're all watching those two the one good thing for us is all the TV talking head shows are going off
Yeah
So the fact that the all these sleazy that Danny Bonadoosh back and all that crap is going off
Maybe some women will turn the radio back on like over to a.m. Okay, hopefully please put the word out
Okay, okay, tell all those huliett women out there start by covering in a closet with their girlfriends. All righty
Thanks, we don't okay take care. Bye-bye
We have two open lines in date
Yeah, if we could just ever tap that enormous closet huliett and hulio audience we got out there if we could ever bring them out of their little
Closets those real macho cowards man come out wherever you are hulio
751 W.I.O.D. and Dade Palm Beach which doesn't count in the book for date and Broward. Thank God is
Dying over there. We don't have even no response even to say hey you guys are still on here. You did great
We're real happy for you not even that I
Bet you if I try to give away my bond Jovey CD again these days I bet you we can get a response on that
Three days I didn't have one asshole yesterday called in the beginning of the show when we had no calls
I wasn't gonna give in nothing away when we had no action here
Are you dreaming when we got a big audience alleged like this and
Steve Nichols running around there told you I told her they like us. They love us. They want us. Yeah
He's doing it. He is really doing it. See most of his handy work has been like at night and on the weekend
And I hate to break the news to you
But those are the day parts that are broken real bad and are way way down as in in the toilet. I mean they're bad
They are real they're not just weak. They're bad. They are brutal
You know I'm talking about no
So our person's 25 to 54 hot is right up there on top radio romance
See how we survive here not only are we on a m but we don't speak of Spanish. We don't got no
Afro I mean how do we make it
Hot is number one 25 to 54 in this market overall followed by a radio romaine
Well they're tied with a 6.8 tied for number one. We got a a black one and a white and a Hispanic one
Of course hot is right up the hall here. So they ought to be raking into bucks
EDR is right behind him with a 6.4. So there's another black station
So two of the top three stations in day in Dayton, Broward are black
How is that possible? How is it possible but only like 17% of the population are less than that is supposed to be black
How is it that they got everybody listening because they don't listen to nobody else?
They all be listening to them
They must not be serving our 10 black people then a radio amorous 4th 5.1
So the top four stations are all black and Hispanic in this market and we're supposed to compete we're supposed to have a number
I
Think quite frankly what we've done here is a major miracle and we want to give Steve Nicolala credit to these ears for it at a voice
Steve
The coast is after that so look at that we got hot is number one the coast is number five
But they like play you know English language speaking once in a while when I'm not doing glory as Stefan at bitch
They got a 4.8
And then WXDJ. I'm sure that's another Julio stage that that's that Russ Oasis thing where they change the call letters
It's some I don't know what it is and then life which is slush and then love 94 which is more slush and jazz
And then you have to come all the way down a y 100 with a 4.0
Boy, oh boy the the ethnicizing they they see they did the census again in the fall
They do this every year they are every whatever how many years they redo the census and then they readjust the ethnic thing
Oh, there's no white people there that's big English
In that county and so then everybody gets screwed even Howard look at this. Oh, no, that's not Howard
That's big boy. I'll tell you once he goes off there. They might as well shut that station off
But anyway W big 3.9 and kiss and the XMXJ how sunny Fox do them by the way and more let's see how sunny is on
Hi, how's that? Bottoms up sweet aren't
Sunny lost a lot of weight on the atkins by the way. Just out of what mention that did you thank me publicly for it or what
W M X J. Oh
What's been going on over there? They've been on a little slide over there at magic the only old East station left on the dial
3.8 down to a 3.2. I guess Sonny's not going to be sending me no check to say thank you for the atkins
And it's a good thing he's on the atkins although I tell you no stakes and lobster man
It puts a little dent in the pocketbook
So somebody sent a donation to sunny Fox. Okay, and tell him we're sorry about solfus
610
W I O D
This is your boy and the voice of the Toronto may believe they don't come any better than Neil Rogers
These the most respected boys in America today his measured words and thoughtful commentaries have stirred a nation
Change the tides of political fortunes and made him a pot full of money. He is lush
Limba
My courage on
Every day on this radio station direct from the DID network that
Grinks
And broadcasting
You can hear the kind of political rhetoric that makes you think I think
That I think is all operation
Lush limba striking at her and scoring direct hits on all his political foes the first lady is a
Feminine
Oh
Boxy she learned not seen after
When you don't care about facts when you just want to hear what you want to hear listen to lush
Okay, here comes my oh I thought you had a penny for me again
Come on at least a quarter this time
It's at least you can do here comes my bonus for this book what he got a little small change
21 cents all right
For Bob Green they don't come any more generous than Bob Green so we lucked out again, huh?
Got some bogus diaries in there nice going Bob anyway
1240
Everybody's happy around here and people are out there say well, what are you getting all nervous about a bunch of numbers
I got news for his sweetheart. This is how we have to live
It's one hell of a way to have to live ain't it when the top 75 stations our stations that have either got people
I can't speak English or extremely been out in the sun for a long time you know what I'm saying
That's the top 85 stations in this goddamn market. There's only like 35 so where the hell do we belong
And we still manage to squeeze in there somehow
We still manage to overcome the goddamn smoke this show. How do you like that?
And those toys for goi am show we got on a weekend
Which by the way is gonna go down on the davi gravy lines on the light bulb going head to head
Pretty heavy duty competition over there. Of course. He's got his own equipment to bring on there
But that's another story
Anyway 1241 at the W I O D. Let's do a mobile in the sunrise. Hello
Good morning Neil Roger. Good afternoon sir. Oh, well, that's bad of it and back to you
I'm going to stand on West Palm Beach and I already made it to
Praise isn't that great you did what I told you when I wasn't West Palm. Yeah, you made it
And you made it all with a sunrise well, you're making some serious progress. Wait till you get down here to Miami, man
Get your piece out
While the reason I call you to say hi now one of the phone
Graduates on Miami's all been spanned on their new coach. I tried last week, but you must have been very busy. Yeah
We're not talking about that's old news that we're talking about congratulating Neil and Phil and Rick and everybody at W I D
Except for Aaron about their great ratings book. That's what we're talking about today
We don't care about Jimmy's Johnson. He's a old news now
All right when he starts with when he starts winning when he starts winning a few games
That's what we'll say hats off to Jimmy. Okay
Okay, that's a good deal. Okay, pal. See you on the 50th line. Get a new phone. You sound like you're Lloyd Bridges
We have two open lines on the green lines
I'm getting my season tickets renewed right now. I have renewed energy and faith in life now that we got a lucky kiss finally
We've been going along since like almost a year now. We've been dragon it and dragon it and dragon it and dragon it
Everybody's been getting suicidal and getting depressed and taking all kinds of mind-altering substances here and doing
Mill towns and pro-zacs and goddamn two and all's because god almighty how to hell are we ever gonna make it especially with you dead heads out there
And we're trying somehow to measure are we still alive? Do we still have a goddamn life here?
Have we been totally cut off from this stupid audience
Underline the stupid part. Here's the last what is it many 18 plus? Yeah, we got
Yes, it is
We are look at that whoo. We're like right up there with the radio romance, okay
Only they got Luis Miguel. That's the one we want
They're on top. Thanks, you're over the 5.8. We're number two and men with a 5.6 course the dolphins in here again
The dolphins that must be what put us over the top. Let's see how the weekend many 18 plus looks okay and find out if it's really just a bogus thing with those stupid dolphin games
Because we know that builds in for in Jimmy demand, which that's what really puts us on top
I bet we're like number one on the weekend. I bet we're kicking ass. I'm we're not I don't see us on the first page with the dolphins
Oh my god, we went down
Okay, for all you hot shots out there that are plotting how you're gonna get the dolphin games away from us after this upcoming season
I hate to break the news to you, but W.I.O.D. went from a 3.1 to a 3.0 on a weekend and men 18 plus men. That's like the dolphin audience
How do you like that?
We went this big gigantic increase in men and it's not from the dolphins
Yeah, pretty funny course if you ever heard zimphard do a game you'd understand they want to watch it on TV instead
That'd rather hear almost anybody even destocked into the game instead of listening to zimphard
So anyway, how are we doing men 18 plus like in the morning? I bet your Rick and suds are just pulverizing the crap out of everybody
I knew they could do it not really didn't to be honest with you
I was kind of like hedging my bets
Well, you know, they were really nervous and Rick was getting ready to leave
Okay, oh Howard with the 5.9, but you know something Howard you're still like uh you're like a point behind last summer
Howard what's going on over there and that like the listenership is a little on the weak side and Rick and suds
I'll be honest with you if Rick and suds had his like the listenership they would like be right up there with them
He's got a 5.9 they got a 4.8 they're like number 5 in men in the morning 18 plus who could be number 1 and made in the mid-day
George how many guesses do we need?
Okay, we went from a 7.9 to an 8.9
many 18 plus
Which means over 65 we don't have too many old farts listen
And what about what about the mad dog there? The big dog. What is it the little dog?
Many 18 plus Rick and suds in the morning of a 4.8 now. What about the little dog over there? Q.A.M
He must have a gigantic number in men, huh? He must have about a 20
He's got 035 which is up that's not something that's pretty good for them
That's the biggest number they've had the little dog continues growing and growing and growing and if you ever feel like
Gap in his tooth he might have an audience over there god damn it especially since that brilliant Andrew Ascender woods has been on air
Talking about who's got the biggest hooters in town. They're really growing big
I mean the audience now let's see about from seven o'clock to midnight and of course Hank
You see one thing that kills me about fat Hank
You know how he always comes on here and tries to defend the fact he knows nothing about hockey and it's boring and nobody cares
And anybody who talks about it. It's a tune out
How did we all do all these big numbers because nobody talks about it more than I do
Do you know what I'm saying?
How did I do all these gigantic numbers since I missed their hockey puck face, huh?
How did I do such a number Hank?
Since that's one of the main interest that I got one of the greatest things in history man
Kind of just because you were dummy in a lazy slab and don't want to learn about it
How come we did so well with all the hockey talk?
Leafs have scored two goals with six attackers on the east this year
At the point, Gila Shah, everybody draw down who's ball for
And I'm gonna shot six goals
Oh
David Recherk, Tensley, Skame and Prince
Too much hockey talk, baby, it's killin me, Hank
All right, the thing was again on the pound, I'm gonna throw a turkey back on the table and let's move back to center
Turkey's on the table, I'm gonna throw it over to Wolf Simelson
Simelson and Len Berry working in the points
France is digging for the puck moves into the fire zone
And Tammy is trying to slow him down goes all the way to the far right wing quarter to
To Yarmher Yager
And at the right point area, all Simelson
Gives the puck a Yager right down the line, here he comes, that Steven's almost goes to France instead of Steven's
Heavey
Jones and Scott
Oh, Kevin Stevens on the power play
And the penguins lead three to one
Oh, scratch my back with an X-R
That was funny
Yeah, too many, you don't know what it's all about
1246 at WIOD, we got the two lines on the green lines in Palm Beach
You people should be ecstatic, baby
You should be calling here and shaking my hand and saying thank God we're talking to a real ballsy guy there
That got a good book finally after all this time that was on the verge of extinction
After 20 goddamn years in his town, he's still alive
And he's still got the numbers over there in spite of all those far-bison agglame
Like us too bad
1-800-944-9463
Even our good close personal friends up there in Palm Beach who allegedly are so involved and cares so much
Even they don't extend their hand of friendship, how do you like that?
Did they offer your friendship? Did they ever invite us to their house for a cup of coffee? No
Instead they come to my house on the day of the goddamn fall book coming out
And ask me to be a goddamn murderer
Okay, 1250 at WIOD, we got the green lines are still
Look at that we're still waiting for it to call off and say congratulations
We love WIOD. We're happy for you guys. It's about time. He got a little bit of relief and a little bit of something
Nothing
So let me just tell you this right now and I mark this down in the counter anybody in Palm Beach ever on days
We give away like those adult videos or anything we ever give away ever if we finally get a million dollars from the sisters and cash to give away
If you're in Palm Beach, forget it no chance
Mark that right down in solid gold
Here's Miami. Hello. Thank you sir
Congratulations, you deserve it. Mocha's classiest amigo you wouldn't feel
Can you do me a big favor? Yeah, my wife is very sick and she wants to hear the dolphin farm. What do you mean?
She's very sick. Well, she had that that flu thing. She's got the trots
Yeah, yeah, and all she wants is just to hear the Brian Clark song
Oh, the right thought you meant the dolphins fight song that was
Oh, I thought you now you're talking about something entertaining that we might all enjoy huh when you get a chance
Like now would be good
Thanks, but that's enough. Thank you, buddy. Okay. Hope she's feeling better. Thank you. Okay
Rude I'm not just falling distasteful the dolphins are cursing and man. It's disgraceful because Brian Cox and the rest of them are saying
Words of love they toss in the microphone the dump button just can't seem to be left alone and all of
This is because they like saying
But they play for
Well, they make it to the super
But with an attitude as bad as there
That's all sing our hopes down the stairs. Oh man, dude. I'm not just
Dispaceful the dolphins are cursing and man. It's disgraceful because Brian Cox and the rest of them are saying
Yes, they're saying
Like
Now what kind of a disgusting
Triple X rated scene is this on a young and a horny were watching right now. It's too bad they're both so ugly
You know what I'm saying?
What kind of a scene is this and she throws her head back. She said Danny never had nothing like that
In fact, Danny never had nothing, but that's another story. What do you expect from her?
So anyway, here's a plantation hello
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Congratulations to your rating. Thank you so much. You know, it's just like Fox
It's not like sunny Fox not
In coherent
You talked into one dish and I'm probably gonna get a second one and keep some going all right fighting the city
Anyways, you know, this ratings thing reminds me of Wall Street. It's a jitter isn't it? Right
It's right and you have no control you have no control no matter how good of a job
You think you're doing no matter how hard you work at it no matter how much energy you put into what you're doing
It's just it's the luck of the draw you know whoever happens to get the diaries
Whatever mood they're in and if they care enough to fill it out and if they get them in the right zip codes and people
That like speak the same language and especially in this market where it is so ethnicized now that you can't find like
Like like I've said is when you get in your car
Maybe you've done this and you're driving around especially on a highway on a turnpike
And you look around at the people in the other cars and I say to myself
There's no way they're listening to the w-i-o-d
There's no way they like nothing you know I'm saying
Well, I understand exactly what you're saying
You know, it's a hysteria. It's like to like the earnings report coming in on Wall Street
Right. That's right. And there goes the thing index goes up and the index goes
So it's just a matter of luck you just sit back and wait and for the luck of the draw. That's it
Remember you got the aimless about out there right that will tell you whether you're rating is good
By the way, and there was only one short subject and I'm gonna keep it short. Please. How about? Yes, please
I know how about relocating the studios from instead of going to Hollywood right at the sawgrass right next to the new hockey arena
Well, there is one good now that's that's the arena. I'm talking about the
W i-o-d studio we took one into Roma and one into Amsterdam. There you go. How's that beautiful? You get your passport ready
I always have mine ready on the passport too. Have a nice day. Okay. See you. Bye-bye
We have an open line in Broward five two four the green lines
How about if we gave you a thousand dollars a piece in Palm Beach to call in and say congratulations guys
Even if you don't mean it, okay? How about if we gave you five thousand dollars to call in in Palm Beach
See we don't got nobody up there you book of people are a bunch of clowns man
Even that one guy don't want to mention his name on here that sends us all the faxes that's you know
We don't listen don't to go out of your way to call us, okay?
Our good close personal friend up there right
He should be having a party in his pants right now, okay? Because one more bad book one more bad trend and man
You'd be here at Hungarian maserca's on a year here like tomorrow. I guarantee you that
They were starting to clean out some of the orifices around here. Why do you think they had that mess down?
There's this morning work was talking about huh?
So here's a pember pines wait a minute like I said here it is hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Hey. How you doing? I'm doing great
Congratulations on your good rating. Thank you so much. We finally I got the luck of the draw man
Let me tell you that you got the luck of the Jewish they should be happy to have you let me tell you they are
Listen, I wanted to ask you. I'm interested in begin wanting your tapes. Yes
How do I go about doing that? Do I get it from you your company there or your your radio show or do I have to go to a store?
You can go to borders
You can just sit there on your ass and call five six one oh seven eight and they'll be able to out to you five six one oh seven eight right
All right, I'm gonna go ahead and get one of those all right
All right, pal have a great life sir. Have a happy and back to you. Bye. Bye. There's a guy that sounds pretty happy
He's like enthusiastic. He likes this. He's just got no problems. He didn't have no clever little punch
You know what I'm saying? Just a good guy out there that sounds like his brain is bigger than his penis
Okay, that's a good move in the right direction man
We just had a few more like that instead of that guy that calls before about you know that pastured at the Phil had on yesterday that past year
Yeah, Louis past year. Is that the one you're talking about?
Like the day that the Phil was you know talking about his Jimmy John was done shul a more important than on rico Fermi and Louis
Pastore and Jonas Big Salk and these people are called and say ha say what who?
I mean what seriously how stupid I've always asked a question you about people with money like Wayne
How much do you need which I noticed Defo was stealing that line again on sports sock last night cut the crap
Well, yeah, Defo. Let's see what your number is sweetheart
But the same thing is true here. You know what I'm saying? I mean how how much stupidity is enough?
How dumb can people get before they're satisfied at their level of stupidity?
How ignorant is it possible to be before you're like you know
You're like quenched with ignorance and you like desiring some kind of knowledge
See people are want to learn something they like either go into a computer or they read a book or a newspaper a magazine
You know and of course nobody does that anymore unless of course the book is like one of those stupid novels or one of those stupid romance novels that the women are all reading
Oh, that's where it's at. There's so romantic. Yeah
Here's North Miami Beach on a purple line. Hello

Now what is it?
People really do appreciate you

Well
You know what I'm saying? This is a town where they love you but they like they sit around they don't want to tell you
Well that's Miami
Yeah, they're like a little indifferent
Yeah but well I don't know about anything else
They love you quite
They really do think you're great
And they just need a little patience
Okay sweetheart
Alright thank you

She was nice
We have an open line indeed 751

Remember that one book Hank said
Oh yeah, I almost got as many men as Neil
Well we don't want to get too personal Hank
But anyway
Where is the men like
Where is that men thing
Where is the men the man thing
Men 18 plus here we go
Now what do we have
What do we have there we got oh that's men 18 plus what about 12 plus
How about that was that possible
What was that number 02554 okay
Men 25 to 54 that's the up
A bigger partin?
It was a 9 4
Yeah but I don't know what he's got
A 9 4 from 10 to 3 which means we're doing about a 10
Between a 10 to and a 10 5
Between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. See the day part is 10 to 3
But between 10 and 2 we're doing over a 10 share in men
Now what's fat so got over there in the afternoon it's always talking about he's got all he's doing this he's doing that
Who the hell are you kidding Hummer
A 4 4
That don't sound like even half
And it don't sound like anywhere near the 5 7 that Phil is got which is like
1.3 higher and rising every day as more people are finding out that's where the entertainment and the humor and the fun stuff is as
Suppose the pompous bull crap with the way of bogus predictions
So eat your parts out Humster

George Burns
George Burns
George Burns
Real close
Like right on the cusp
Couldn't even make that birthday party

My good close great friend Alan Finkelson smoked cigars
Every day of his adult life
Dead

This is going out on the limb
Okay

Everybody and I don't want to get that cigar Dave upset
Because that's a great show we got
Everyone who smokes cigars
Will die

Hi this is Sunny Fox and I listen to you, Rodious
Because I can hear the word asshole
Ladies and gentlemen
Please welcome the two newest New York Yankees
Darrell Strawberry
I'm the Doctor Gooden with it
And the personal coach Steve Hall
Hall
That's what I'd like to know
Not goodens in the lineup
The straw man snorts the lineup
He's ruling like a dog who heard a bell
He's high as a lab rat
From smoking the crack at a bat
He doesn't like cocaine
Just likes the way it smells
Snort and A
Balls, Darrell's rolling up the 20s
Snort and A
Balls and he's giving good and plenty
They lick the 20 dollar bill
Their teeth are grinding like a peppermill
Goin A
Balls
Oh, alcohol and pills
Jesus
Steve Hall is in the bullpen
His nostrils are wide open
He's so f***** up beating
He's on the braves
He gets advice from Doc
And Doc prescribed some rock
So first he blew a line and then he blew the safe
Snort and A
Balls say abused the magic powder
Snort and A
Balls sprinkle it on their clam chowder
Prescriptions got the pet your world refill
They do it in the pool if they had gills
Goin A
Balls
Oh, alcohol and pills
All that money
A
Balls
Alcohol and pills
I like to welcome you all aboard
Is your manager?
Oh, high block
118 at WID buck be gone by the way
But hey, they don't know it
So I'm looking at the little dog there
And in the morning at that 2.25 to 54
And I'm beginning to realize I'm looking at the average quarter hour
Is actually down to 100
And the quam is like down like 9,000
So they got a little kiss there in men
But generally speaking little dog
You're not whipping enough
You're not whipping it in the shape
Probably that Andrew Asinwoods
That's putting them over the top
And if they could just get a few more
Pimply-faced kids
And who is that Goon that sits there with a humster in the afternoon that they brought in from ESPN
That keeps talking back and forth
That to me seriously
Hummer you're killing yourself with this guy
It sounds like it sounds like light bulb radio
It sounds like what they do on a light bulb
Where they sit and play Goosey Goosey with little kitty board ops so back and forth
I mean that is just
I mean it guy is like on Mike
It's like they do it a two man, a five man show
Hank and this other guy
He's killing the hummer
Let's all geez
Oh boy
Congratulations
Thanks Greg from Boynton Beats
I'm upset now because I just had a talk with George off the air
Listen can I say something to you?
I'm not like George has been trilliquist, okay?
So whatever you talk to George about
Keep that between you and George
But now you and I are on the air
I'm on a very important highly rated radio show
I expect you to conduct yourself and behave you know in a certain decorum here
Like an adult
Whatever little problems you got with George
I'm sure you guys can work it out if you know it doesn't have anything to do with George
It has to do with you
It does
And he's telling me that you really
I mean I haven't called your show
I haven't been bothering you
Yeah
You're certain to see now you're cletching again
You sound like a misfit when you go into this routine
Well you had some
Instead of when you call one of those snappy little songs or something clever and unique and useful
Now you sound like you're regressing into that cletchedic egregor
Oh you can all get good mood until I talk to George
Well I am too every day
How do you like to have to work here?
I would try to
What's the military going to have to say now that we went through the roof especially on this show
You disgusting bitch
Yeah that's what I'm saying
She better once she gets those ratings she better say something good
I'm going to burn that building down
And it looks to me like howard's got a 5 6 25 54 in the morning and between 10 and 2 when we extrapolate
And we're going to have about a 6 which means between 10 and 11
I wouldn't be surprised in the least bit if we beat the pants off of them again
As we have every month every trend going on now for like a year and a half
How can we do some investigating on the you know the ethnic stations
You talk about there's only what's the percentage of the ethnic audience?
1%
Where is only one tenth of 1% Hispanic and the black and Dayton Broward
It has to be some type of a half
There's only 16 people that are Latin and black
There's a scam going on and someone's got to get to the bottom of it
Right you're the guy to do it, pal
I am
Listen, get on it
No
Or get off it
You mentioned it
You mentioned a couple weeks ago CBS
And I don't want to call too much but I had to save this up
You see I got to save this up
You're already saying he doesn't want to call too much
Yeah
CBS, I've never had CBS on my TV
I don't know anybody to listen to that watch is that station
I mean when you got shows like Murphy Brown and what's that other old bitch that's on there
That's awful that channel
Mary Tyler Moore
I don't know what tells you she must be because they always have around CBS this morning
So that stiff show is must been on CBS
Oh I listened to the curse team this morning
Yeah
Joe Rose had a...
No it's the Hearst team
He had a meat of my eye on there again
Oh did he?
Did he still look in front of the house?
No, no, no, he's now he's trying to set up for Ed Jovenowski
Oh yeah
Yeah, they're having a third of a fight
And here's a big edit he really needs that guy with a big gap in his teeth
He's helping getting laid, I'm sure of that
I hope Joe Venosky comes by with that stick and just gives him a good elbow to the push and shuts his push up for once
So we'll see you Greg
No the passion lady yet night
Yeah
Now that Don's got some time on his hands maybe he could fill in boost that number a little bit
That's a good idea
And congratulations Neil
Okay see you Greg
See you
Get out of here
Okay three months
We have an open line on a green line
And 1-800-944-WYOD
It's 122 at your very successful and famous station
Where we keep bouncing back like Bobby V in a rubber ball
Let's hear it, come on Bobby
And Phil Henry says Bobby V sucks
How do you like that?
Fill your a brilliant guy
But some things he just don't know
You don't know your Bobby V
You don't know your rubber ball
And the night has a thousand eyes
You know when you're hungry when you're Jonesin' for the best in seafood and shellfish and pasta
There's only one place you need to think about
That shells of course
You'll want to try shell shrimp pasta
That's a bowl full of sweet tender shrimp sauteed with linguine and a pasta cream sauce
With just a hint of garlic or shell seafood pasta
It's a bowl full of scallops, mussels, shrimp and clams with linguine and shell's fabulous pasta cream sauce
If you tried shell shrimp primavera yet it's the perfect light taste as shells mixes garden fresh vegetables with imported pasta shells
And sautees them in a shell pasta cream sauce with a hint of garlic
There's always the shell's traditional shrimp and cheese tortellini
A heaping gigantic humongous portion of shrimp mixed with tortellini
Stuffed with the blend of Italian cheese and spices
Sauteed in shells pasta sauce
It is mouthwatering, it's incredible
There are over 14 different shellfish and seafood pastas
So when you're in a mood for great casual seafood, it shells
You'll find a shells in candle 117th and sunset in the TJ Max Plaza
Or in Sunrise University Drive just north of Sunrise Boulevard right in our neck of the woods
